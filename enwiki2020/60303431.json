    "text": "Steven Bruce \"Steve\" Dodge (July 12, 1945 \u2013 January 17, 2019) was an American telecommunications and media entrepreneur, environmentalist, and philanthropist. He co-founded and was the founder, chairman and CEO of five companies including American Tower, American Radio Systems, American Cablesystems, Windover Development, and Beverly Crossing. Dodge was inducted into the Academy of Distinguished Entrepreneurs at Babson College in 2002 and the Mobile Infrastructure Hall of Fame in November 2018. Throughout his career he served on numerous boards, including Sotheby\u2019s, The Cabot (Beverly, Massachusetts), the Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Endicott College, and Montserrat College of Art. Dodge died in Bonita Springs, Florida, after being struck by a vehicle while crossing a road with his bicycle. At the time of his death, Deborah Parenti, publisher of the trade journal Radio Ink, wrote that Dodge was \"an extraordinary human being who made people proud of their work.\u201d The Boston Globe added that he was \u201ca serial entrepreneur en route to becoming one of Greater Boston\u2019s most successful businessmen.\u201d ==Early life== Dodge was born in New Haven, Connecticut, to Nelson Dodge, a sales executive, and Betsy (Adams) Dodge, an artist. The senior Mr. Dodge died when Steve was 9. His mother married Donald Bradley (The Hotchkiss School, 1925), a banker, and the family moved to Cheshire, Connecticut. Dodge graduated from Hotchkiss (1963) and from Yale University (1967) with a degree in English. He attended Navy Officer Candidate School in Newport, Rhode Island, and served the Navy for four years, most of his time aboard a destroyer, rising in rank to lieutenant and chief engineer. \u201cI did more learning and growing up in the Navy than anywhere else\u2014before or since,\u201d Dodge said in a 2018 interview. \u201cActions produced tangible outcomes that mattered, and working hard became a habit.\u201d ==Career== ===Bank of Boston=== Back in civilian life, Dodge joined the Bank of Boston in the commercial loan officer training program. Selected from the program by bank executive William L. Brown, Dodge was asked to research and later lend to a new industry, cable-TV. \u201cI fell in love with it,\u201d Dodge said. He became the senior lender for the bank on the Continental Cablevision account, among others. He enjoyed commercial lending but said, \u201cI wasn\u2019t cut out to work for other people for very long.\" His exposure to the cable TV industry and its players \"convinced me that they were just normal guys, not that formidable.\u201d Dodge decided to leave the bank to launch his own cable company. ===American Cablesystems Corporation=== In 1978 Dodge founded American Cablesystems Corporation (ACS), initially headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, moving to Beverly, Massachusetts, in 1983. ACS built and operated cable franchises in Massachusetts, New York, Florida, California, Illinois, West Virginia, Virginia, and Tennessee. Dodge was Chairman and CEO from the company\u2019s founding until its sale in 1988. He found it challenging, saying, \"All of a sudden, I had to learn to buy paper clips and do payroll.\u201d The company\u2019s initial public offering was in May 1986 and priced at $14.50 share price (AMEX:ACN). In October 1987, ACS signed a definitive merger agreement with Continental Cablevision for a per subscriber price of $2,100 and a per share price of $46.50. The transaction, valued at $723 million ($473 million equity plus the assumption of debt), closed in February 1988. ===American Radio Systems Corporation=== In February 1988, Dodge founded Atlantic Ventures (later Atlantic Radio L.P.) with a small team from American Cablesystems, led by executives Eric Schultz, Joseph Winn, and Michael Milsom. Atlantic purchased radio stations in Boston, Rochester, and Syracuse, New York, and Burlington, Vermont. By 1993 Atlantic had sold all of its stations except Boston, where the company owned Mix 98.5, Eagle 93.7, WEEI, and WRKO. On November 1, 1993, Atlantic merged with Multi Market Communications, Inc. and Stoner Broadcasting System Holding, Inc., forming American Radio Systems Corporation (American Radio) with Dodge as Chairman, President and CEO, Winn as CFO and Director, and David Pearlman and John Gehron, and later Don Bouloukis, as co-chief operating officers until its merger with CBS Corporation in 1998. In June 1995, American Radio completed an initial public offering at $16.50 per share, with proceeds of $70.4 million. By the end of 1995 the Company owned 24 radio stations in eight markets. In April 1997, the Company merged with EZ Communications, adding 24 radio stations in eight markets, for an aggregate purchase price (including assumed debt) of $830 million. By the end of 1997, the Company owned 100 radio stations in 21 markets, and had also acquired 760 wireless communications sites. ARS became the country\u2019s fourth-largest radio group. Dodge was on Radio Ink\u2018s \u201c40 Most Powerful People in Radio\u201d list in 1996 (at #7) and 1997 (#6). In June 1998, American Radio became a wholly owned subsidiary of CBS Corporation pursuant to a merger agreement. American Radio shareholders received $44.00 per share plus one share of American Tower (NYSE:AMT) common stock in a transaction valued at a then-record enterprise price of over $2.6 billion. ===American Tower Corporation=== While operating American Radio in 1995, Dodge recognized the opportunity in the wireless-communications site industry. ARS owned towers and wireless companies began approaching it for space. \u201cIt seemed obvious to me that wireless was coming,\" Dodge said, \"so we started building new towers to see what kind of business they might attract.\u201d In July 1995, American Radio organized American Tower Systems Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary. When the early towers filled quickly and became profitable, Dodge added, \"We knew we were onto something. . . .\u201d On June 4, 1998, American Tower Corporation became a standalone public company (NYSE:AMT). Dodge was Chairman, President, and CEO of American Tower Corporation from its founding until 2004. In 1998, American Tower Systems Inc. merged with its competitor, American Tower Corporation, and acquired Gearon & Co., Inc. At the end of 1998 American Tower operated 3,200 towers in 44 states. Dodge retired as Chairman at the 2004 Annual Meeting of shareholders. At the time, the Company operated approximately 15,000 communications sites in the United States, Mexico, and Brazil. ===Windover Development, LLC=== In 2005, Dodge founded Windover, a custom builder of luxury homes on Boston\u2019s North Shore, later expanding to Bonita Beach, Florida, and adding Windover Construction, a full-service construction management firm focused on residential, commercial and institutional projects. In 2017, Windover Construction was purchased by its employees, led by CEO Lee Dellicker. ===Beverly Crossing LLC=== In 2016, Dodge founded Beverly Crossing, a real estate development group that creates, owns, and operates residential communities in Massachusetts, and in Florida, where it serves the Gulf Coast from Naples to Ft. Myers as Windover Development of Florida. \u201cBeverly has become our main area of focus,\u201d Dodge said in 2018, \u201cas we are replacing the City\u2019s dying or dead industrial core with a new community of apartments, restaurants, and related amenities, with bustling Beverly Depot at its center.\u201d ==Personal Life== In 1974, Dodge married Anne Nordblom, whom he had met at the Bank of Boston. The couple had three children, Thomas, Kristen, and Benjamin. Dodge and his wife were benefactors of Brookwood School, Brown University, Middlesex School, Milton Academy, the Boston Renaissance Charter Public School, and the University of Vermont. \u201cThroughout his professional endeavors and personal relationships,\u201d Dodge\u2019s obituary read, he \u201crepeatedly demonstrated the importance of maintaining genuine humility, selfless generosity, and a sense of humor. Despite his extraordinary success, Dodge is remembered and revered most for his quiet leadership qualities, specifically his ability to mentor and instill confidence in others. Countless people regarded his guidance, which he offered freely, as key in reaching significant life decisions.\u201d Dodge\u2019s launch of Windover in 2005 was a result of his personal interest in architecture and construction and an opportunity to create spcial places. He artfully enhanced landscapes in Massachusetts and Vermont featuring weathered fieldstone fences, newly planted trees, and classic New England structures. Surveying Dodge\u2019s work, a neighbor once remarked, \u201cIt\u2019s what God would have done if he hadn\u2019t run out of money.\u201d Dodge was a lifelong Red Sox fan and an avid reader. His favorite getaways included fishing the mountain streams in Chile and motorcycling in Sardinia. \u201cWe biked there because they had no speed limits,\u201d he said. When asked to describe what makes a good entrepreneur, Dodge replied, \u201cRemain humble, approachable. Pay attention to what\u2019s going on around you. Learn how to listen more than your talk.\u201d ==References== Category:1945 births Category:American chief executives in the media industry Category:Yale University alumni Category:Cycling road incident deaths Category:2019 deaths ",
