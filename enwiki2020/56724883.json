    "text": "A map of the current official Gaeltacht areas in Ireland in 2020 The Gaeltacht Act 2012 () is an Act of the Oireachtas of Ireland. The Act redefined the traditional Irish-speaking areas or Gaeltacht in the Republic of Ireland on linguistic criteria instead of on geographic areas which had been the position until 2012. While the traditional Gaeltacht boundaries still exist the Act sets out ways where areas outside the Gaeltacht can be formally designated as L\u00edonra\u00ed Gaeilge (Irish Language Networks) and Bailte Seirbh\u00eds\u00ed Gaeltachta (Gaeltacht Service Towns). In 2016 it was announced that Galway City, Dingle and Letterkenny would be the first recognised Bailte Seirbh\u00eds\u00ed Gaeltachta under the Gaeltacht Act 2012 subject to them adopting and implementing approved language plans. In February 2018 the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Foras na Gaeilge announced that five areas- Belfast, Loughrea, Carn T\u00f3chair, Ennis and Clondalkin- were going to be designated as the first formal L\u00edonra\u00ed Gaeilge areas under the Act. Foras na Gaeilge have said that they expect the status to be given to other areas also. The Act also brought the process of the introduction of Language Plans in the Gaeltacht into existence and gave statutory effect to the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030 by \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta in the Gaeltacht and changed the process by which the board of \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta are elected. \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta are responsible for the implmentation of the Gaeltacht Act 2012 in the Gaeltacht including the Bailte Seirbh\u00edse Gaeltachta and they also oversee the implementation of the 20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010\u20132030 in the Gaeltacht ==See also== * Gaeltacht Irish speaking regions in Ireland. * \u00dadar\u00e1s na Gaeltachta The Gaeltacht Authority. * Bailte Seirbh\u00edse Gaeltachta Gaeltacht Service Towns. * L\u00edonra\u00ed Gaeilge Irish Language Networks. * Official Languages Act 2003 * Irish language outside Ireland * Scottish Gaelic Gaeilge na hAlban / G\u00e0idhlig. * G\u00e0idhealtachd Scottish Gaelic speaking regions in Scotland. ==References== ==External links== Gaeltacht Act 2012 from the Irish Statute Book.
