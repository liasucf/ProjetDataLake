    "text": "\"The Truth of Fact, the Truth of Feeling\" is a science fiction story by American writer Ted Chiang. It was first published in 2013 in Subterranean Press. ==Synopsis== In the near future, a journalist observes how the world, his daughter, and he himself are affected by \"Remem\", a form of lifelogging whose advanced search algorithms effectively grant its users eidetic memory of everything that ever happened to them, and the ability to perfectly and objectively share those memories. In a parallel narrative strand, a Tiv man is one of the first of his people to learn to read and write, and discovers that this may not be compatible with oral tradition. ==Reception== \"Truth\" was a finalist for the 2014 Hugo Award for Best Novelette.2014 Hugo Awards, at TheHugoAwards.org; retrieved January 21, 2017 Charlie Jane Anders compared it to Black Mirror,This new Ted Chiang short story could change your life, by Charlie Jane Anders, at io9; published October 25, 2013; retrieved January 21, 2017 and Gary K.
