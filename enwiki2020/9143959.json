The screenplay concerns the hardships faced by a widow and her eight-year-old son on a rugged Canadian ranch. == Plot summary == Mary Sharron (Susan Hayward) has lost her husband to a forest fire. To help her run the ranch, she hires handyman Fred Carter (Stephen Boyd). A handsome, but taciturn man who has known much tragedy, Fred works hard for her. Robbie Sharron (Dennis Holmes), the woman's son, resents Fred, and when he learns that his mother is planning to marry him to quell ugly rumors in town, the youth is unhappy. After the wedding, the stepfather treats the boy harshly, not out of cruelty, but because he wants to prepare the boy to survive the tough life ahead. This creates friction and frustration. Sometimes Fred beats both Mary and Robbie. On the day that Mary learns she is pregnant, Robbie and Fred get into a violent fight. Fred goes to the local saloon and ends up jailed for brawling. A month later he is released. When he gets home, he finds Mary has moved his things to the barn. A natural disaster changes the family's lives and relationships, and after much turmoil, honesty and pain gives them a chance to heal and start anew.http://www.allmovie.com/work/woman- obsessed-130013 == Cast == * Susan Hayward as Mary Sharron * Dennis Holmes as Mary's son, Robbie Sharron * Stephen Boyd as Fred Carter * Barbara Nichols as Mayme Radzevitch * Theodore Bikel as Dr. R.

Powell, orchestrators. The film was shot in Big Bear Lake, California. == Reception == Writing in The New York Times, reviewer Bosley Crowther panned the film: \"Perhaps we should not blame Miss Hayward or the fellow who plays the husband, Stephen Boyd, for faults that should be laid to the director, Henry Hathaway, or particular to Mr. Boehm. (The latter also produced the picture, so he is liable to double jeopardy.) But their efforts are so clearly indifferent and wanting in basic skill that they are deserving serious censure for such an utterly foolish film.\" == References == == External links == * * * * Category:1959 films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on Canadian novels Category:1959 romantic drama films Category:American romantic drama films Category:Films directed by Henry Hathaway Category:Films scored by Hugo Friedhofer Category:Films shot in Big Bear Lake, California Category:1959 drama films ",
