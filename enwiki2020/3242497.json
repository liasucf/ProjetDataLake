It consisted of two airframe variants, one for detection gear, the other for weapons. The Guardian remained in service until August 1955, when it was replaced by the twin-engined Grumman S-2 Tracker. The Guardian was the largest single-engine piston-powered carrier aircraft ever to see service. ==Design and development== An AF-2W from VS-37 in flight circa July 1957 The original design concept for the aircraft that would become the Guardian, the XTB2F of 1944, was for a twin-engined aircraft with a warload and a range of 3,700 mi (5,950 km).Kowalski 1991, pp. 2\u20133. This was considered to be too large for practical use from an , and was cancelled in 1945, replaced by a modified Grumman F7F Tigercat, the XTSF-1. However, this too was considered impractical,Norton 2008, p. 120. and another alternative, the internally developed Grumman Model G-70, was selected instead, being given the Navy designation XTB3F-1. This was designed as mixed-power aircraft, with a Pratt & Whitney Double Wasp radial engine in the nose and a Westinghouse 19XB turbojet in the tail. Originally, the Westinghouse engine was to be the new X24C which was to emerge as the J34 series. When it became apparent the X24C delivery schedules would not meet the airframe schedule, the 19XB-2B was substituted. This was found to be unsuitable, and the jet engine was removed without ever having been used in flight. The XTB3F-1S carried a crew of two seated side-by-side and an armament of two 20 mm cannon and 4,000 lb (1,814 kg) of bombs, torpedoes and/or rockets, and made its first flight on 19 December 1945. On 24 December 1945, the Navy changed the role of the aircraft from torpedo-bomber to anti-submarine warfare. All the required equipment could not be fitted into a single aircraft, consequently two variants would be produced, one as a \"guppy\" (hunter) and another as a \"scrapper\" (killer).Kowalski 1991, p. 16. The hunter aircraft would not carry any armament,Donald and March 2001, p. 46. but instead two additional crew members and a ventral radome for AN/APS-20 search radar and electronic countermeasures (ECM) consisting of an AN/APR-98 countermeasures receiver and AN/AP-70 bearing indicator.Kowalski 1991, p. 18. This aircraft, the XTB3F-1S, first flew in November 1948. The \"killer\" deleted the cannon of the torpedo bomber, but retained the bomb bay, added a third crewmember, a searchlight, and short- range radar, and (as the XTB3F-2S) first flew in January 1949. ==Operational history== An AF-2S in the colors of VS-25 pictured while owned by Aero Union Corporation, circa 1978/79. Redesignated as AF-2W (TB3F-1S) and AF-2S (TB3F-2S), the Guardian entered fleet service on 27 September 1950 with three aircraft delivered to VS-24,Kowalski 1991, p. 14. with full service introduction shortly after with VS-25.Wagner 1982, p. 498. A total of 193 AF-2S Guardians were built. In 1952, the AF-3S (hunter) was introduced, fitting a magnetic anomaly detector (MAD) for the detection of submerged submarines; 40 of this variant were built. The last Guardian was delivered to the Navy in March 1953, with a total of 389 built.Goebel, Greg. \"Grumman AF Guardian.\" VectorSite, 2009. Retrieved: 16 January 2011. The Guardian saw service in the maritime patrol role during the Korean War, however it proved unpopular with pilots, being underpowered and heavy on the controls; the aircraft suffered from a severely high accident rate. Shortly after the end of the war, it began to be replaced by the Grumman S2F Tracker, the U.S. Navy first purpose-built ASW airplane to combine the hunter and killer roles in a single airframe.Donald and March 2001, p. 50. The last AF retired from active service on 31 August 1955, but it remained in service with the US Naval Air Reserve until 1957. ==Variants== The underside of an AF-2S showing its opened weapons bay ; XTB3F-1 :Prototypes of two-seat torpedo bomber powered by one 2,300 hp R-2800-46 engine and a Westinghouse turbojet; three built. ; XTB3F-1S & -2S :Two modified XTB3F-1 prototypes with turbojet removed and ventral radome, later redesignated as XAF-1. ; AF-2S :Production variant with 2,400 hp R-2800-48 engine, 193 built.Swanborough and Bowers 1990, p. 246. ; AF-2W :Hunter variant with search radar in a ventral radome, 153 built. ; AF-3S :Hunter/Killer variant similar to AF-2S with retractable MAD boom, 40 built. ; Grumman Model G-90 : Proposed combined AF-2S/-2W version, cancelled. ==Operators== Grumman AF Guardian in Aero Union colors at Pima ; * United States Navy * Aero Union ==Surviving aircraft== AF-2 Guardian on display at the National Museum of Naval Aviation Grumman AF Guardian at Pima Air Museum After disposal by the U.S. Navy five Guardians saw many years service with Aero Union based at Chico, California, in the forest firefighting role, the last being retired in 1978. ;Airworthy ;;AF-2S *126792 - privately owned in Ocala, Florida.\"FAA Registry: N9995Z\" FAA.gov Retrieved: 24 July 2014. ;On display ;;AF-2S *123100 - National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola in Pensacola, Florida.
