    "text": "Bust of Aristotle, whose Prior Analytics contained an early discussion of this fallacy In classical rhetoric and logic, begging the question or assuming the conclusion is an informal fallacy that occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. For example, the statement \"green is the best color, because it is the greenest of all colors\" claims that the color green is the best because it is the greenest - which it assumes is the best. It is a type of circular reasoning: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.Herrick (2000) 248. In modern vernacular usage, however, begging the question is often used to mean \"raising the question\" or \"suggesting the question\". Sometimes it is confused with \"dodging the question\", an attempt to avoid it. The phrase begging the question originated in the 16th century as a mistranslation of the Latin , which in turn was a mistranslation of the Greek for \"assuming the conclusion\". == History == The original phrase used by Aristotle from which begging the question descends is: \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03be \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2 (or sometimes \u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1fc7) \u03b1\u1f30\u03c4\u03b5\u1fd6\u03bd, \"asking for the initial thing.\" Aristotle's intended meaning is closely tied to the type of dialectical argument he discusses in his Topics, book VIII: a formalized debate in which the defending party asserts a thesis that the attacking party must attempt to refute by asking yes-or-no questions and deducing some inconsistency between the responses and the original thesis. In this stylized form of debate, the proposition that the answerer undertakes to defend is called \"the initial thing\" (\u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03be \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1fc6\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f78 \u1f10\u03bd \u1f00\u03c1\u03c7\u1fc7) and one of the rules of the debate is that the questioner cannot simply ask for it (that would be trivial and uninteresting). Aristotle discusses this in Sophistical Refutations and in Prior Analytics book II, (64b, 34\u201365a 9, for circular reasoning see 57b, 18\u201359b, 1). The stylized dialectical exchanges Aristotle discusses in the Topics included rules for scoring the debate, and one important issue was precisely the matter of asking for the initial thing\u2014which included not just making the actual thesis adopted by the answerer into a question, but also making a question out of a sentence that was too close to that thesis (for example, PA II 16). The term was translated into English from Latin in the 16th century. The Latin version, ', \"asking for the starting point\", can be interpreted in different ways. ' (from '), in the post-classical context in which the phrase arose, means assuming or postulating, but in the older classical sense means petition, request or beseeching. ', genitive of ', means beginning, basis or premise (of an argument). Literally ' means \"assuming the premise\" or \"assuming the original point\". The Latin phrase comes from the Greek (', \"asking the original point\") in Aristotle's Prior Analytics II xvi 64b28\u201365a26: Aristotle's distinction between apodictic science and other forms of non-demonstrative knowledge rests on an epistemology and metaphysics wherein appropriate first principles become apparent to the trained dialectician: Thomas Fowler believed that ' would be more properly called ', which is literally \"begging the question\".Fowler, Thomas (1887). The Elements of Deductive Logic, Ninth Edition (p. 145). Oxford, England: Clarendon Press. == Definition == To \"beg the question\" is (also called ') to attempt to support a claim with a premise that itself restates or presupposes the claim.Welton (1905), 279., \"Petitio principii is, therefore, committed when a proposition which requires proof is assumed without proof.\" It is an attempt to prove a proposition while simultaneously taking the proposition for granted. When the fallacy involves only a single variable, it is sometimes called a hysteron proteronDavies (1915), 572.Welton (1905), 280\u2013282.In Moli\u00e8re's Le Malade imaginaire, a quack \"answers\" the question of \"Why does opium cause sleep?\" with \"Because of its soporific power.\" In the original: Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire. Le Malade imaginaire in French Wikisource (Greek for \"later earlier\"), a rhetorical device, as in the statement: * \"Opium induces sleep because it has a soporific quality.\"Welton (1905), 281. Reading this sentence, the only thing one can learn is a new word in a more classical style (soporific), for referring to a more common action (induces sleep), but it does not explains why it causes that effect. A sentence attempting to explain why opium induces sleep, or the same, why opium has soporific quality, would be the following one: * \"Opium induces sleep because it contains Morphine-6-glucuronide, which inhibites the brain's receptors for pain, causing a pleasurable sensation that eventually induces sleep.\" A similar example: * \"Everyone wants this new Hero Man action figure because it's the hottest toy this season.\" This form of the fallacy may not be immediately obvious. Linguistic variations in syntax, sentence structure and literary device may conceal it, as may other factors involved in an argument's delivery. It may take the form of an unstated premise which is essential but not identical to the conclusion, or is \"controversial or questionable for the same reasons that typically might lead someone to question the conclusion\":Kahane and Cavender (2005), 60. For example, one can obscure the fallacy by first making a statement in concrete terms, then attempting to pass off an identical statement, delivered in abstract terms, as evidence for the original. One could also \"bring forth a proposition expressed in words of Saxon origin, and give as a reason for it the very same proposition stated in words of Norman origin\",Gibson (1908), 291. as here: * \"To allow every man an unbounded freedom of speech must always be, on the whole, advantageous to the State, for it is highly conducive to the interests of the community that each individual should enjoy a liberty perfectly unlimited of expressing his sentiments.\"Richard Whately, Elements of Logic (1826) quoted in Gibson (1908), 291. When the fallacy of begging the question is committed in more than one step, some authors dub it ' (reasoning in a circle)Bradley Dowden, \"Fallacies\" in Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. or, more commonly, circular reasoning. Begging the question is not considered a formal fallacy (an argument that is defective because it uses an incorrect deductive step). Rather, it is a type of informal fallacy that is logically valid but unpersuasive, in that it fails to prove anything other than what is already assumed.The reason ' is considered a fallacy is not that the inference is invalid (because any statement is indeed equivalent to itself), but that the argument can be deceptive. A statement cannot prove itself. A premiss must have a different source of reason, ground or evidence for its truth from that of the conclusion: Lander University, \"Petitio Principii\". == Related fallacies == Closely connected with begging the question is the fallacy of circular reasoning ('), a fallacy in which the reasoner begins with the conclusion. The individual components of a circular argument can be logically valid because if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true, and does not lack relevance. However, circular reasoning is not persuasive because a listener who doubts the conclusion also doubts the premise that leads to it. Begging the question is similar to the complex question (also known as trick question or fallacy of many questions): a question that, to be valid, requires the truth of another question that has not been established. For example, \"Which color dress is Mary wearing?\" may be fallacious because it presupposes that Mary is wearing a dress. Unless it has previously been established that her outfit is a dress, the question is fallacious because she could be wearing pants instead. Another related fallacy is ignoratio elenchi or irrelevant conclusion: an argument that fails to address the issue in question, but appears to do so. An example might be a situation where A and B are debating whether the law permits A to do something. If A attempts to support his position with an argument that the law ought to allow him to do the thing in question, then he is guilty of '.H.W. Fowler, A Dictionary of Modern English Usage. Entry for '. == Contemporary usage == Some contemporary English speakers use begs the question (or equivalent rephrasings thereof) to mean \"raises the question\", \"invites the question\", \"suggests the question\", etc. Such preface is then followed with the question, as in: * [...] personal letter delivery is at an all-time low... Which begs the question: are open letters the only kind the future will know? * Hopewell's success begs the question: why aren't more companies doing the same?.\"beg the question\". Collins Cobuild Advanced English Dictionary online, accessed on 2019-05-13 * [Universal access to all-female schools is] an appeal bound to elicit sympathy, especially from guilty liberals, but it begs the question of whether the daughters of the rich benefit from single-sex education. * Spending the summer travelling around India is a great idea, but it does beg the question of how we can afford it.\"beg the question\" Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary & Thesaurus online, accessed on 2019-05-13 Prescriptivist grammarians and people versed in philosophy, logic, and law object to such usage as incorrect or, at best, unclear. This is because, it is claimed, the classical sense of Aristotelian logic is the correct one.Brians, Common Errors in English Usage: Online Edition (full text of book: 2nd Edition, November 2008, William, James & Company) (accessed 1 July 2011)Follett (1966), 228; Kilpatrick (1997); Martin (2002), 71; Safire (1998). == See also == * Ambiguity * Catch-22 (logic) * Circular definition * Consequentia mirabilis * Euphemism treadmill * Fallacies of definition * Open-question argument * Polysyllogism * Presuppositional apologetics * Regress argument (') * Spin (propaganda) == Notes == == References == * Cohen, Morris Raphael, Ernest Nagel, and John Corcoran.
