During his youth he became involved in the European Agudat Yisrael youth movement, of which he later became chairman. After immigrating to Mandatory Palestine in 1934, he remained active in Agudat Yisrael. As a prominent member of the organisation, Loewenstein became a member of Moetzet HaAm (later the Provisional State Council), and signed Israel's declaration of independence in 1948. However, he later claimed: :It ignored our sole right to Eretz Israel, which is based on the covenant of the Lord with Abraham, our father, and repeated promises in the Tanach. It ignored the aliya of the Ramban and the students of the Vilna Gaon and the Ba'al Shem Tov, and the [rights of] Jews who lived in the 'Old Yishuv'.Wallish and the Declaration of Independence Jerusalem Post, 1998 (republished on Eretz Israel Forever) He was elected to the Knesset in the country's first elections in 1949 as a member of the United Religious Front, an alliance of the four major religious parties. However, he lost his seat in the 1951 elections. Loewenstein rejected the idea of a constitution for Israel, stating that: :\"if it contradicts the Torah of Israel, it is a revolt against the Almighty; if it is identical with the Torah, it is superfluous. A constitution will lead to an uncompromising fight... a Kulturkampf.\"Perpetual Dilemma: Jewish Religion in the Jewish State S. Zalman Abramov, pp 139 In 1972, Loewenstein became chairman of the Committee for Spiritual Salvation. He died in 1995. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1904 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Danish emigrants to Israel Category:Danish Jews Category:Israeli people of Danish-Jewish descent Category:Members of the 1st Knesset (1949\u20131951) Category:Signatories of the Israeli Declaration of Independence Category:United Religious Front politicians ",
