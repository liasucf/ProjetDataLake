    "text": "The District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would have given the District of Columbia full representation in the United States Congress, full representation in the Electoral College system, and full participation in the process by which the Constitution is amended. It would have also repealed the Twenty-third Amendment, which granted the District of Columbia the same number of electoral votes as that of the least populous state, but gave it no role in contingent elections. The amendment was proposed by the U.S. Congress on August 22, 1978, and the legislatures of the 50 states were given seven years to consider it. Ratification by 38 states was necessary for the amendment to become part of the Constitution; only 16 states had ratified it when the seven-year time limit expired on August 22, 1985. This proposed constitutional amendment is the most recent one to have been sent to the states for their consideration. ==Text== ==Legislative history== Representative Don Edwards of California proposed House Joint Resolution 554 in the 95th Congress. The United States House of Representatives passed it on March 2, 1978, by a 289\u2013127 vote, with 18 not voting.124 Congressional Record 5272\u20135273 The United States Senate passed it on August 22, 1978, by a 67\u201332 vote, with 1 not voting.124 Congressional Record 27260 With that, the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment was submitted to the state legislatures for ratification. The Congress, via Section 4, included in the text of the proposed amendment the requirement that ratification by three-fourths (38) of the states be completed within seven years following its passage by the Congress (i.e., August 22, 1985) in order for the proposed amendment to become part of the Constitution.In Dillon v. Gloss, , the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Congress's authority to impose time limits on ratification. By placing the ratification deadline in the text of the proposed amendment the deadline could not be extended, as had been done regarding the Equal Rights Amendment. ==Ratification history== thumb|300px| Ratification by the legislatures of at least 38 of the 50 states by August 22, 1985, was necessary for the District of Columbia Voting Rights Amendment to become part of the Constitution. During the seven-year period specified by Congress it was ratified by only 16 states and so failed to be adopted. The amendment was ratified by the following states: #New Jersey on September 11, 1978 #Michigan on December 13, 1978 #Ohio on December 21, 1978 #Minnesota on March 19, 1979 #Massachusetts on March 19, 1979 #Connecticut on April 11, 1979 #Wisconsin on November 1, 1979 #Maryland on March 19, 1980 #Hawaii on April 17, 1980 #Oregon on July 6, 1981 #Maine on February 16, 1983 #West Virginia on February 23, 1983 #Rhode Island on May 13, 1983 #Iowa on January 19, 1984 #Louisiana on June 24, 1984 #Delaware on June 28, 1984 ==Effects if it had been adopted== Had it been adopted, this proposed amendment would have given the District of Columbia full representation in both houses of the Congress. Also, this proposed amendment would have repealed the Twenty-third Amendment. The Twenty-third Amendment does not allow the district to have more electoral votes \"than the least populous State\", nor does it grant the district any role in the election of a president by the House of Representatives (or that of the vice president by the Senate). In contrast, this proposed amendment would have provided the district full participation in presidential elections. Finally, the proposed amendment would have also allowed the Council of the District of Columbia, the Congress, or the people of the district (depending on how this proposed amendment would have been interpreted) to decide whether to ratify any proposed amendment to the Constitution, or to apply to the Congress for a convention to propose amendments to the United States Constitution, just as a state's legislature can pursuant to the Constitutional amendment process. The amendment would neither have made the district a state, nor affected Congress's authority over it. ==See also== *District of Columbia voting rights *List of amendments to the United States Constitution, amendments sent to the states, both ratified and unratified *List of proposed amendments to the United States Constitution, amendments proposed in Congress but never sent to the states for ratification ==References== Category:Unratified amendments to the United States Constitution Voting Rights Amendment Voting Rights Amendment ",
