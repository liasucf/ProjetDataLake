    "text": ", Buddhist name , was one of the six senior disciples of Nichiren and was the former chief priest of Kuon-ji temple in Mount Minobu, Japan. Various Nichiren-related sects based in Japan claim to have been founded by Nikko, including Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b and some lineages within Nichiren Shu. Various Nichiren Buddhist schools recognize that Nikk\u014d kept meticulous scholarly records during his lifetime, along with keeping a highly organized religious practice, and is responsible for much of the records that survive todayNews n\u00b0153, Nichiren Shu.. Nikk\u014d singularly upheld the doctrine that Nichiren was the True and Eternal Buddha in the Latter Day of the Law (Mapp\u014d) and therefore is considered by schools stemming from Nikk\u014d such Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b and the Soka Gakkai, the sole legitimate successor to the ministry and legacy of Nichiren. Other schools reject the claim that he is the chosen disciple among the six senior disciples of Nichiren. Nikko established the Head Temple Taisekiji at Fujinomiya in 1290, as well as enshrining the Dai Gohonzon image. In 1332, four months before his death, he designated Nichimoku Shonin as his successor. The grave of Nikk\u014d remains today in Kitayama Honmonji, Omosu, in Suruga Province where he lived for thirty-six years, establishing a Buddhist seminary in the Nichiren-sh\u016b religion. The Koshi-E memorial feast of his death anniversary is commemorated on February 6 (Nichiren Shoshu O-tai-ya) and February 7 (Gosho-to-e ceremony). ==Early life== The Seppo Ishi, a boulder where Nikk\u014d is said to have once preached at the Taisekiji Temple Nikk\u014d was born at Kajikazawa in Koma District of Kai Province. His father, Oi-no Kitsuroku was from Totsumi province and later moved to Kai province while maintaining his samurai career. He died when Nikk\u014d was a child. Nikk\u014d's mother was Myofuku Tsunashima () and was from what is now Shizuoka Prefecture. He was raised by his grandfather, Nyudo Yui. As a child, he entered the Tendai temple Shijuku-in, in Fujiwakabacho, Iwabuchi. He took the acolyte name, \"Hokibo\" and received his education here, which as well as Tendai doctrine, included Chinese classics, Japanese literature, poetry, calligraphy, as well as other subjects. ==As Nichiren\u2019s disciple== In 1257, Nichiren visited Jisso-ji Temple closely affiliated with Shijuku-in Temple where he studied various Buddhist sutras in its library for his treatise Rissh\u014d Ankoku Ron (\u7acb\u6b63\u5b89\u56fd\u8ad6, \"Establishing the Correct teaching for the Peace of the Land\"). Nikk\u014d served Nichiren here, and vowed to become his disciple. In addition, Nikk\u014d also accompanied Nichiren on his two exiles. Nikk\u014d is also credited with preserving many of Nichiren's voluminous writings. He was particularly careful to ensure the survival of Nichiren's many letters written in simple characters (Kana) for uneducated followers. He was also instrumental in gaining Nichimoku to become a junior disciple of Nichiren, later appointing him as successor of the Buddhist treasures confiscated from Kuonji Temple, and the appointment as third High Priest of the Taisekiji temple. On 8 October 1282, Nikk\u014d became one of the six senior priests whom Nichiren designated to carry on his faith after his death. According to various Nichiren sects that claim Nikko as their founder, on October 13, 1282, Nichiren further designated Nikk\u014d the chief priest of Kuon- ji, the temple at Mt. Minobu in Yamanashi Prefecture, where Nichiren had spent the last years of his life as purportedly recorded in a transfer document called Minobu-zan Fuzoku-sho (\"Document entrusting Mt. Minobu\"); however, the authenticity of this document is disputed by some Nichiren sects. Later that same day, Nichiren died at Ikegami, now part of Tokyo. Following Nichiren's 100th day funeral ceremonies, Nikk\u014d left Ikegami on October 21 to carry Nichiren's ashes back to Mount Minobu, arriving on October 25. On the centenarian anniversary of Nichiren's death, Nikk\u014d, the other five senior priests, and their disciples conducted a 100th-day memorial service, after which the others departed for their own territories where they were most active. Nikk\u014d carried out his duties as chief priest of Kuon-ji, teaching disciples and looking after the laity. Central to his work was attending, cleaning and maintaining Nichiren's tomb, and collecting and cataloguing Nichiren's many writings for preservation and perpetuation. ==Isolation from other disciples== An image of Hagiri Sanenaga, patron of Shinto, enshrined at Minenyama Kuonji temple. The Stupa and grave of Nikko, located in Kitayama Honmonji of the Nichiren Shu sect, in Fujinomiya, Shizuoka Prefecture. Latter feelings of animosity and discord grew after the second death anniversary of Nichiren's 100th Day Memorial ceremony (23 January 1283) when, according to Nikko, the rotation system agreed in the \"Shuso Gosenge Kiroku\" (English: Record document of founder's demise) and Rembo Cho (English: Rotation Wheel System) to clean and maintain Nichiren's grave, was being abandoned by the other five senior disciples. By the third anniversary of Nichiren's death (13 October 1284), Nikk\u014d claimed that the other five senior priests no longer returned to Nichiren's tomb in Mount Minobu, citing the deer hoofs and other signs of neglect at the gravesite. In addition, Nikk\u014d accused that after Nichiren's death, the other disciples slowly began to deviate from Nichiren's teachings. Chief among these complaints was the syncretism by some of the disciples to worship images of both Shakyamuni Buddha while admonishing other disciple priests for signing their names \"Tendai Shamon\" of the Tendai Buddhist school in the subsequent documents notarized and sent to the Kamakura government. Furthermore, Nikko alleged that the other disciples became condescending towards some of Nichiren's writings because they were not written in Classical Chinese, but in the katakana syllabary, which was deemed inferior at the time. The steward of the temple district, Hagiri Sanenaga, who had been converted by Nikk\u014d, also began to commit unorthodox practices which Nikk\u014d deemed to be heretical, such as the following: # The crafting of a standing statue of Shakyamuni Buddha as an object of worship. # The donation of noren shrine curtains and horses to the Mishima Taisha Shinto shrine, at the time an honorary shrine of the H\u014dj\u014d-clan shogunate. # The procurement of bamboo lumber for the Shinto Gassan Shrine. # The attendance of a memorial service dedicated to the stupa of Amida Buddha along with giving monetary donations to its Nembutsu priests in Fukushi ward, Nanbu, Yamanashi Prefecture. The Kuon-Ji Temple of Mount Minobu, in Yamanashi Prefecture, where Nikk\u014d formerly administered as its chief priest. These controversial acts received tolerance from another senior disciple, Mimbu Nik\u014d (\u6c11\u90e8\u65e5\u5411, 1253\u20131314) to be acceptable due to having been done ordinarily with the knowledge of Nichiren while he was alive. Accordingly, Hagiri Sanenaga provided his own personal reason that it was customary for his political family to make homage to the Shinto shrine of the Kamakura Shogunate, as well as reasoning that he had provided monetary donations to other Buddhist sects even when Nichiren himself was alive. Such developments eventually led Nikk\u014d to conclude that Nichiren's enlightened entity no longer resided and continue at Mount Minobu. Furthermore, he felt that Kuon-ji was not the place for perpetuating Nichiren's teachings, causing him to pack up his belongings, and allegedly some relics belonging to Nichiren, to depart, never to return. Nikk\u014d left Mount Minobu with a group of select disciples in the spring of 1289. Nanjo Shichijo-jiro Tokimitsu, a lay believer residing near Mount Fuji offered them sanctuary to stay, later donating a tract of land for a new temple that became Taiseki-ji Temple. Taiseki-ji is today the head temple of the Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b school and, since its founding on 12 October 1290, has been a major center of the K\u014dmon-ha (\u8208\u9580\u6d3e, also called the \u5bcc\u58eb\u6d3e: Fuji-ha) branch of Nichiren Buddhism, as the schools stemming from Nikk\u014d were traditionally known. Upon nearing death on 10 November 1332, Nikk\u014d named his disciple Nichimoku (1260\u20131333) as his successor and passed onto him the Ozagawari Gohonzon, inscribed in 8 April 1308 for the memorial honor of the martyr \u201cJinshiro\u201d, approximately 14 years after the persecution of Hei No Saimon Yoritsuna. This mandala is now enshrined inside the Dai-Kyakuden, along with his Juzu beads made of Crystal and Shimamenu Onyx which are now preserved in the Gohozo building of Taisekiji. For the remaining 36 years of his life, Nikk\u014d then retired a few miles away to Omosu, Suruga Province where he founded a seminary and temple, Ikegami Honmon-ji belonging to Nichiren-sh\u016b sect, and concentrated on training disciples until his death in the second lunar month of 1333 at the age of 87. A grave claiming to house the ash remains of Nikk\u014d Sh\u014dnin is located in Kitayama Honmonji Temple in Suruga Province. After his death within this same temple, a statue of the solar goddess Amaterasu Omi-Kami and the protector god Hachiman was enshrined, donated by some early Hokkek\u014d believers. Such sculptural images are considered only decorative in present teachings of the Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b school. ==Buddhist articles claimed to have been brought to Taisekiji Temple== According to the doctrinal beliefs of Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b, Nikk\u014d Shonin left Mount Minobu with several articles pertaining to Nichiren, namely the following: * The Dai Gohonzon Mandala * Transfer inheritance documents of his legitimacy as chief priest of Kuon-ji and as successor * Several Gohonzon mandalas inscribed by Nichiren * Remaining partial bones (17 pieces) and cremated ashes of Nichiren * The Onikuge, a piece of tooth belonging to Nichiren * A dragon candlestick, koro incense burner and vase Nichiren used when summoning rain during times of drought for the peasant devotees. * The Namamiei statue (Mieido) and the Sacred Treasure (Hoando) statue of Nichiren Daish\u014dnin == Claim to Nichiren's successorship== Some followers of the Nichiren schools stemming from Nikk\u014d, in particular the Nichiren Sh\u014dsh\u016b sect, as well as the Soka Gakkai, view Nikk\u014d as the sole legitimate successor to Nichiren. They base this claim on a document dated the ninth lunar month of 1282 called the Nichiren ichigo guh\u014d fuzoku-sho (\u201cDocument Entrusting the Law that Nichiren Propagated throughout His Life\u201d). In this document, Nichiren entrusts the \"entirety of his lifetime of teaching\" to Nikk\u014d and names him the \"Great Master of propagation of the essential teaching\". These documents contained in a treasure box are alleged to have been stolen by clan head Takeda Katsuyori on behalf of the Nishiyama Temple, a faction of Nichiren Shu during the 15th century via force. Other Nichiren lineages based on the other original five senior disciples vehemently reject this claim of successorship, as they claim the surviving document does not exist in Nichiren's hand or any of his immediate disciples, rather copied down by Nikko's extant disciples. Instead, such schools claim that Nikko was only a resident priest in Kuonji Temple before 1285, and later became the Chief Priest of that temple from 1285\u20131289, just before he moved to the Fujinomiya area. Some of Nikk\u014d's direct disciples also eventually spawned schools that deviated to some degree or another from his own doctrines, often due to political pressure or internal power plays going back and forth to separating or rejoining the Nikko-related temples of the Fujinomiya area before and after the Second World War. == Original Japanese terms == #\u8eab\u5ef6\u5c71\u4ed8\u5631\u66f8, also called the Ikegami s\u014dj\u014d (\u6c60\u4e0a\u76f8\u627f) \"Succession document [written at] Ikegami\" #\u65e5\u84ee\u4e00\u671f\u5f18\u6cd5\u4ed8\u5631\u66f8: Nichiren ichigo guh\u014d fuzoku-sho #\u65e5\u84ee\u4e00\u671f\u306e\u5f18\u6cd5: Nichiren ichigo no guh\u014d #\u672c\u9580\u5f18\u901a\u306e\u5927\u5c0e\u5e2b: Honmon Guz\u016b no Daid\u014dshi ==References== == Sources == * Nikk\u014d Sh\u014dnin Nichimoku Sh\u014dnin Sh\u014dden (\u65e5\u8208\u4e0a\u4eba\uff65\u65e5\u76ee\u4e0a\u4eba\u6b63\u4f1d: \"Orthodox biography of Nikk\u014d Sh\u014dnin and Nichimoku Sh\u014dnin\"), Taisekiji, 1982 * Nichiren Daish\u014dnin Sh\u014dden (\u65e5\u84ee\u5927\u8056\u4eba\u6b63\u4f1d: \"Orthodox biography of Nichiren Daish\u014dnin\"), Taisekiji, 1981 * The Life of Nichiren Daishonin.
