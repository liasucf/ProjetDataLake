    "text": "Mental Models is a book published by Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc., in 1983 . It was edited by Dedre Gentner and Albert L. Stevens, both employees of Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc. at the time. It appeared at about the same time as a book by the same name by Philip Johnson-Laird. According to the acknowledgment of the book, it resulted from a workshop on mental models held at the University of California, San Diego in October 1980, that was jointly sponsored by the Office of Naval Research and the Sloan Foundation. ==Chapters== #Some Observations on Mental Models \u2014 Donald A. Norman, UCSD #:Dr. Norman describes the properties of mental models \u2014 that they can be contradictory, incomplete, superstitious, erroneous, and unstable, varying in time. So the job of system designers is to help users form an accurate and useful mental model of a system. And the job of researchers is to set up experiments to learn to understand actual mental models, even though they may be messy and incomplete. #Phenomenology and the Evolution of Intuition \u2014 Andrea diSessa, MIT #Surrogates and Mappings: Two Kinds of Conceptual Models for Interactive Devices \u2014 Richard M. Young, Medical Research Council, Applied Psychology Unit, Cambridge, England #Qualitative Reasoning About Space and Motion \u2014 Kenneth D. Forbus, MIT #The Role of Problem Representation in Physics \u2014 Jill H.

The American Journal of Psychology reviewed the work, stating that it would be of interest to \"those who are concerned with what is new in cognitive science\". Instructional Science also wrote a review, writing \"Mental Models succeeds as an introduction to the vigorous, multidisciplinary attack on the ethereal problems surrounding knowledge representation. Whether mental models will prove their mettle in the earthly settings of instructional applications remains an open question.\" == References == == External links == *Preview at Google Books Category:Science studies Category:Cognitive science literature ",
