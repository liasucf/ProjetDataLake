Peru's participation in the Olympic Games forced the authorities to suspend the Peruvian football league for 1936. ==Football controversy== 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics team. Front: Adelfo Magallanes, Jorge Alcalde, Teodoro Fern\u00e1ndez, Jos\u00e9 Morales, and Alejandro Villanueva. Back: Carlos Tovar, V\u00edctor Guarderas Lavalle, Juan Valdivieso, Arturo Fern\u00e1ndez, Segundo Castillo, and Orestes Jord\u00e1n. Austria played Peru in an astonishing game leading to a huge political row. Time Magazine reported: In Lima President Oscar Benavides of Peru last week addressed an angry crowd: \"I have just received cables from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay and Mexico supporting the Peruvian attitude against the crafty Berlin decision.\" The crowd, which had already torn an Olympic flag, gathered to listen to more speeches at the Plaza San Martin. Later it threw stones to the German Consulate's windows until police arrived in trucks. At Callao, Lima's seaport, workmen on the docks refused to load two German vessels. The \"crafty Berlin decision\" concerned a soccer game on the fortnight in which the Peruvians overturned a 2-goal deficit against Austria to take the tie into extra-time and win the match 4-2, with a goal scored in the last minute of extra-time. After the game, Austria argued that Peruvian players had manhandled them, and that spectators, one of them brandishing a revolver, had swarmed down on the field. FIFA ordered the game replayed behind closed doors, so Peru's whole Olympic team of 40 promptly withdrew from the Games in protest; the game was awarded to Austria by default. Said Miguel Dasso of the Peruvian Olympic Committee: \"We've no faith in European athletics. We have come here and found a bunch of merchants.\" ==Athletics== {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heat !colspan=\"2\"|Quarterfinal !colspan=\"2\"|Semifinal !Final !rowspan=\"2\"|Rank |- !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result !Rank !Result |- |Antonio Cuba |Men's 100 metres |align=center| |align=center|5 |align=center colspan=6|Did not advance |- |Francisco Valdez Bravo |Men's 800 metres |align=center| |align=center|7 |colspan=2 |align=center colspan=4|Did not advance |- |Carlos Marcerano |Men's 800 metres |align=center|2:00:8 |align=center|6 |colspan=2 |align=center colspan=4|Did not advance |} ==Basketball== Roster: Miguel Godoy, Luis Jacob, Roberto Rospigliosi, Koko C\u00e1rdenas, Fernando Ruiz, \"Canon\" Ore, Jose Carlos Godoy, Armando Rossi, Rolando Bacigalupo, Manuel Fiestas, Willy Dasso, Antuco Flecha (Coach: Pedro Vera) First Round \\---- Second Round \\---- Third Round Peru was awarded a bye to the next round. \\---- Fourth Round Poland won by walk-over and was awarded 2 points. \\---- Fifth Place Match Uruguay won by walk-over and was awarded 2 points. ==Cycling== ===Road=== ;Team Peru finished without a time during the team road race. ;Men {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Rider !Event !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Manuel Bacigalupo |align=left|Road race |no time | |-align=center |align=left|Gregorio Caloggero |align=left|Road race |no time | |-align=center |align=left|Jos\u00e9 Mazzini |align=left|Road race |no time | |-align=center |align=left|C\u00e9sar Pe\u00f1aranda |align=left|Road race |no time | |} Times were not recorded for any of the four competing athletes because they finished after the 16th place. === Track=== ;Sprints {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Event !colspan=2|Round One !colspan=2|Round 1 (repechage) !Round 2 !Round 3 !Semifinals !Final !Bronze medal race |- !Opposition Time Speed (km/h) !Rank !Opposition Time Speed !Rank !Opposition Time Speed !Opposition Time Speed !Opposition Time Speed !Opposition Time Speed !Opposition Time Speed |- |Jos\u00e9 Mazzini |Men's sprint |align=center| L, L |align=center|2 |align=center| L, L L, L |align=center|3 |align=center colspan=7 |Did not advance |- |} ==Diving== ;Men' {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Events !colspan=2|Preliminary !colspan=2|Semifinal !colspan=2|Final |- !Points !Rank !Points !Rank !Points !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Alfredo Alvarez |align=left rowspan=2|3 m springboard |align=center colspan=5 |DNF |24 |} ==Football== ;First Round \\---- ;Quarter finals Due to a pitch invasion, the match was declared null and void, and ordered to be replayed on August 10.
