It was then called \"Cebu Normal School\" and was located on Osme\u00f1a Boulevard. In 1906, the school became an adjunct to the then Cebu Provincial High School (now Abellana National School). In 1924, the school became independent of PNS, obtained the normal school status and moved to its current site in Osme\u00f1a Boulevard, Cebu City. In 1926, it produced its first batch of graduates as a new educational institution. === CNU during World War II === The CNU campus was used as headquarters of the Kempetai or Military Police of the Japanese Imperial Army during the second World War. On March 26, 1945, Allied forces landed on Cansojong Beach in Talisay, starting the liberation of Cebu. The United States Army made CNS their base. === Conversion into college === In 1952, the two-year general curriculum adopted in 1946 was changed to the four-year Elementary Education Curriculum, which was later changed to Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE \u2013 Elementary Education) in 1954. This led CNS to become a tertiary institution. In 1959, BSE was changed into Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education. The Graduate School was opened in 1960 and produced its first M.A. graduate in 1966 \u2013 Rosemary P. Gellor.
