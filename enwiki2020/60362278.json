    "text": "Knockgorm, an Anglicisation of the Gaelic 'Cnoc Gorm', meaning The Blue Hill (probably because the soil is light blue), is a townland in the civil parish of Templeport, County Cavan, Ireland. It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of Glangevlin and barony of Tullyhaw. ==Geography== Knockgorm is bounded on the north by Altshallan and Curraghglass townlands, on the east by Legatraghta townland and on the south by Slievenakilla townland. Its chief geographical features are the oligotrophic lakes- Munter Eolus Lough (Gaelic meaning The Descendants of Eolus) and Knockgorm Lough, mountain streams, waterfalls, forestry plantations and gravel pits. The townland is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 341 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. A deed by John Enery dated 13 December 1774 includes the lands of Knockgarrim otherwise Knockgarrin. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Knockgorm. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list six tithepayers in the townland.
