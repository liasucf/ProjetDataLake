    "text": "The UNESCO/Guillermo Cano World Press Freedom Prize, created in 1997, honours a person, organization or institution that has made an outstanding contribution to the defence and/or promotion of press freedom anywhere in the world, especially when this has been achieved in the face of danger. The prize, worth US$45,000, is awarded each year on the occasion of World Press Freedom Day on 3 May. The prize is named after Guillermo Cano Isaza, the editor of the Colombian newspaper El Espectador, who was murdered in Bogot\u00e1 on 17 December 1986. Cano was a vocal critic of the country's powerful drug barons. Each year, an independent jury of 14 news professionals selected by the UNESCO Director-General selects a winner from the many nominations submitted by non-governmental organizations working in the field of press freedom, and by UNESCO Member States. ==Award Winners== {| align=\"center\" class=\"wikitable\" |- !
