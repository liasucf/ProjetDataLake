The race was the second round of the 2019 FIA Formula One World Championship and marked the 15th time that the Bahrain Grand Prix had been run as a round of the Formula One World Championship. ==Background== === Championship standings before the race === Heading into the Grand Prix, Valtteri Bottas led the World Drivers' Championship by 8 points over teammate Lewis Hamilton. Their team, Mercedes, was holding a 22-point lead over Ferrari in the World Constructors' Championships. ===Entrants=== The drivers and teams were the same as the season entry list with no additional stand in drivers for either the race or practice. The main title sponsor of Ferrari, Mission Winnow, returned from this race, after it was not used by the Scuderia at the previous race in Australia for legal reasons. === DRS === Before the race, it was announced that an extra drag reduction system (DRS) zone would be added to the circuit. In addition to the DRS zones between turns 15 and 1 and between turns 10 and 11 an extra DRS zone was added between turns 3 and 4. This change was expected to increase the number of overtakes and promote more pit stops during the race. == Free practice == The first practice session happened without major incident and ended with a Ferrari one-two with Charles Leclerc leading Sebastian Vettel with Leclerc comfortably beating the next fastest constructor by nearly one second. The second and third practice sessions also ended with a comfortable Ferrari one-two although it was Leclerc who was leading Vettel in third practice. ==Qualifying== Charles Leclerc got his first pole position of his Formula 1 career in the 2019 Bahrain Grand Prix Weekend with his Ferrari teammate Sebastian Vettel in second with a time 0.3 seconds slower. After Ferrari looked substantially ahead of Mercedes in free practice, Mercedes did manage to close the gap to the Italian team, but still qualified on the second row for the race on Sunday, with Lewis Hamilton ahead of teammate Valtteri Bottas. Max Verstappen was 0.5 seconds adrift from Valtteri Bottas in 4th place with Kevin Magnussen only 0.005 seconds slower than the Dutchman. Carlos Sainz Jr. split the two Haas cars in 7th and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen continuing his longest streak of Q3's in Formula 1, qualifying ninth just ahead of Lando Norris\u2019 McLaren in 10th. Pierre Gasly missed out on Q3 once again in Bahrain in the Red Bull, qualifying 13th behind Daniel Ricciardo in 11th and Alexander Albon in 12th, Sergio P\u00e9rez qualified 14th, 0.3 seconds quicker than Daniil Kvyat in 15th in his Toro Rosso. Nico H\u00fclkenberg (Renault) was the shock exit in Q1 in 17th place behind Antonio Giovinazzi\u2019s Alfa Romeo and ahead of Lance Stroll, who qualified 18th. Williams once again qualify on the back row, the lead Williams George Russell 1.5 seconds away from Stroll and Robert Kubica qualified in last place with a 1:31.799 compared to the fastest time of 1:28.495. === Qualifying classification === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" |Driver ! rowspan=\"2\" |Constructor ! colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:#eaecf0; text- align:center;\" | ! rowspan=\"2\" | |- ! scope=\"col\" |Q1 ! scope=\"col\" |Q2 ! scope=\"col\" |Q3 |- ! scope=\"row\" |1 | align=\"center\" |16 |data-sort- value=\"LEC\"| Charles Leclerc |Ferrari |1:28.495 |1:28.046 |1:27.866 | align=\"center\" |1 |- ! scope=\"row\" |2 | align=\"center\" |5 |data-sort- value=\"VET\"| Sebastian Vettel |Ferrari |1:28.733 |1:28.356 |1:28.160 | align=\"center\" |2 |- ! scope=\"row\" |3 | align=\"center\" |44 |data-sort- value=\"HAM\"| Lewis Hamilton |Mercedes |1:29.262 |1:28.578 |1:28.190 | align=\"center\" |3 |- ! scope=\"row\" |4 | align=\"center\" |77 |data-sort- value=\"BOT\"| Valtteri Bottas |Mercedes |1:29.498 |1:28.830 |1:28.256 | align=\"center\" |4 |- ! scope=\"row\" |5 | align=\"center\" |33 |data-sort- value=\"VER\"| Max Verstappen |Red Bull Racing-Honda |1:29.579 |1:29.109 |1:28.752 | align=\"center\" |5 |- ! scope=\"row\" |6 | align=\"center\" |20 |data- sort-value=\"MAG\"| Kevin Magnussen |Haas-Ferrari |1:29.532 |1:29.017 |1:28.757 | align=\"center\" |6 |- ! scope=\"row\" |7 | align=\"center\" |55 |data-sort- value=\"SAI\"| Carlos Sainz Jr. |McLaren-Renault |1:29.528 |1:29.055 |1:28.813 | align=\"center\" |7 |- ! scope=\"row\" |8 | align=\"center\" |8 |data-sort- value=\"GRO\"| Romain Grosjean |Haas-Ferrari |1:29.688 |1:29.249 |1:29.015 | align=\"center\" |11 |- ! scope=\"row\" |9 | align=\"center\" |7 |data-sort- value=\"RAI\"| Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen |Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |1:29.959 |1:29.471 |1:29.022 | align=\"center\" |8 |- ! scope=\"row\" |10 | align=\"center\" |4 |data- sort-value=\"NOR\"| Lando Norris |McLaren-Renault |1:29.381 |1:29.258 |1:29.043 | align=\"center\" |9 |- ! scope=\"row\" |11 | align=\"center\" |3 |data-sort- value=\"RIC\"| Daniel Ricciardo |Renault |1:29.859 |1:29.488 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |10 |- ! scope=\"row\" |12 | align=\"center\" |23 |data-sort-value=\"ALB\"| Alexander Albon |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |1:29.514 |1:29.513 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |12 |- ! scope=\"row\" |13 | align=\"center\" |10 |data-sort- value=\"GAS\"| Pierre Gasly |Red Bull Racing-Honda |1:29.900 |1:29.526 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |13 |- ! scope=\"row\" |14 | align=\"center\" |11 |data-sort-value=\"PER\"| Sergio P\u00e9rez |nowrap|Racing Point-BWT Mercedes |1:29.893 |1:29.756 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |align=\"center\" |14 |- ! scope=\"row\" |15 | align=\"center\" |26 |data-sort-value=\"KVY\"| Daniil Kvyat |nowrap|Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |1:29.876 |1:29.854 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |15 |- ! scope=\"row\" |16 | align=\"center\" |99 |nowrap data- sort-value=\"GIO\"| Antonio Giovinazzi |Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |1:30.026 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |16 |- ! scope=\"row\" |17 | align=\"center\" |27 |data-sort-value=\"HUL\"| Nico H\u00fclkenberg |Renault |1:30.034 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |17 |- ! scope=\"row\" |18 | align=\"center\" |18 |data-sort-value=\"STR\"| Lance Stroll |Racing Point-BWT Mercedes |1:30.217 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |18 |- ! scope=\"row\" |19 | align=\"center\" |63 |data-sort-value=\"RUS\"| George Russell |Williams-Mercedes |1:31.759 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |19 |- ! scope=\"row\" |20 | align=\"center\" |88 |data-sort-value=\"KUB\"| Robert Kubica |Williams-Mercedes |1:31.799 |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A |style=\"background: silver\" align=\"center\"|N/A | align=\"center\" |20 |- ! colspan=\"8\" |107% time: 1:34.689 |- !colspan=\"8\"|Source: |- |} ;Notes * \u2013 Romain Grosjean was given a three place grid penalty for impeding Lando Norris during qualifying. == Race == Charles Leclerc started from pole position but lost two positions to his teammate Sebastian Vettel and the Mercedes of Valtteri Bottas, who managed to get ahead of his teammate Lewis Hamilton in the first corner. Romain Grosjean and Lance Stroll tangled on the first lap with Stroll hitting Grosjean, giving the Haas damage. By the end of the first lap, Leclerc was on Bottas' tail and passed the Finn into turn 1 on lap 2, which also allowed Lewis Hamilton to take third place from Bottas. On lap 4, Carlos Sainz Jr. attacked Max Verstappen on the outside in turn 4 but the two collided, giving Sainz a puncture. On lap 6, Charles Leclerc overtook Vettel for the lead of the race into turn 1 and began to pull away quickly. Antonio Giovinazzi sent Daniil Kvyat into a spin at turn 11. Hamilton was catching Vettel throughout the race and eventually caught up to him on lap 38, making a move around the outside at turn 4. Vettel went into a spin on corner exit, saying he got surprised and lost the rear of the car. In the process he flat-spotted his tires, causing severe vibration leading to a front wing failure. Pitting to replace the front wing dropped him to 9th place. The Renaults were running 6th and 7th and made contact while battling for position into turn 1, with Daniel Ricciardo left with front wing damage. On lap 46, Leclerc was cruising in the lead but then reported an engine issue and slowed significantly. It was later revealed that one of his engine cylinders had stopped working. On lap 48 he was caught by Hamilton, who took the lead. On lap 54 Leclerc was passed by Bottas dropping Leclerc to 3rd and it was looking likely that he was going to be overtaken by Verstappen. However, with 4 laps remaining the two Renaults retired with mechanical issues and brought out the safety car, which stayed out until the end of the race, making it only the 8th race in Formula 1 to finish under a safety car. As a result, Leclerc managed to hold on to 3rd place and claimed his first ever podium in Formula 1. Leclerc also had the fastest lap of the race, giving him and Ferrari one extra point for their respective championships. === Race classification === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" |Driver ! scope=\"col\" |Constructor ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Time/Retired ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" |Points |- !1 | align=\"center\" |44 |data-sort-value=\"HAM\"| Lewis Hamilton |Mercedes |57 |1:34:21.295 | align=\"center\" |3 | align=\"center\" |25 |- !2 | align=\"center\" |77 |data-sort-value=\"BOT\"| Valtteri Bottas |Mercedes |57 | +2.980 | align=\"center\" |4 | align=\"center\" |18 |- !3 | align=\"center\" |16 | nowrap=\"\" data-sort-value=\"LEC\" | Charles Leclerc |Ferrari |57 | +6.131 | align=\"center\" |1 | align=\"center\" |16 |- !4 | align=\"center\" |33 |data-sort-value=\"VER\"| |Red Bull Racing-Honda |57 | +6.408 | align=\"center\" |5 | align=\"center\" |12 |- !5 | align=\"center\" |5 |data-sort-value=\"VET\"| |Ferrari |57 | +36.068 | align=\"center\" |2 | align=\"center\" |10 |- !6 | align=\"center\" |4 |data-sort- value=\"NOR\"| |McLaren-Renault |57 | +45.754 | align=\"center\" |9 | align=\"center\" |8 |- !7 | align=\"center\" |7 |data-sort-value=\"RAI\"| Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen |Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |57 | +47.470 | align=\"center\" |8 | align=\"center\" |6 |- !8 | align=\"center\" |10 |data-sort-value=\"GAS\"| Pierre Gasly |Red Bull Racing-Honda |57 | +58.094 | align=\"center\" |13 | align=\"center\" |4 |- !9 | align=\"center\" |23 |data-sort-value=\"ALB\"| | nowrap=\"\" |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |57 | +1:02.697 | align=\"center\" |12 | align=\"center\" |2 |- !10 | align=\"center\" |11 |data-sort-value=\"PER\"| | nowrap |Racing Point-BWT Mercedes |57 | +1:03.696 | align=\"center\" |14 | align=\"center\" |1 |- !11 | align=\"center\" |99 |data-sort-value=\"GIO\"| |Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |57 | +1:04.599 | align=\"center\" |16 | |- !12 | align=\"center\" |26 |data-sort-value=\"KVY\"| |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |56 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |15 | |- !13 | align=\"center\" |20 |data-sort-value=\"MAG\"| |Haas-Ferrari |56 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |6 | |- !14 | align=\"center\" |18 |data-sort-value=\"STR\"| |Racing Point-BWT Mercedes |56 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |18 | |- !15 | align=\"center\" |63 |data-sort-value=\"RUS\"| |Williams-Mercedes |56 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |19 | |- !16 | align=\"center\" |88 |data-sort-value=\"KUB\"| |Williams-Mercedes |55 | +2 laps | align=\"center\" |20 | |- !17 | align=\"center\" |27 |data-sort-value=\"HUL\"| |Renault |53 |Power unit | align=\"center\" |17 | |- !18 | align=\"center\" |3 |data-sort-value=\"RIC\"| |Renault |53 |Power loss | align=\"center\" |10 | |- !19 | align=\"center\" |55 |data-sort-value=\"SAI\"| |McLaren-Renault |53 |Gearbox | align=\"center\" |7 | |- !data-sort-value=\"20\"|Ret | align=\"center\" |8 |data-sort-value=\"GRO\"| |Haas- Ferrari |16 | | align=\"center\" |11 | |- class=\"sortbottom\" |data-sort- value=\"ZZZ\" colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" |Fastest lap: Charles Leclerc (Ferrari) \u2013 1:33.411 (lap 38) |- ! colspan=\"8\" |Source: |} ;Notes * \u2013 Includes one point for the fastest lap. * \u2013 Nico H\u00fclkenberg, Daniel Ricciardo and Carlos Sainz Jr. were classified as they completed more than 90% race distance. ==Championship standings after the race== ;Drivers' Championship standings {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" ! ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Driver ! scope=\"col\" | Points |- |align=\"left\"| 10px |align=\"center\"|1 | Valtteri Bottas |align=\"left\"|44 |- |align=\"left\"| 10px |align=\"center\"|2 | Lewis Hamilton |align=\"left\"|43 |- |align=\"left\"| 10px |align=\"center\"|3 | Max Verstappen |align=\"left\"|27 |- |align=\"left\"| |align=\"center\"|4 | Charles Leclerc |align=\"left\"|26 |- |align=\"left\"| 10px 1 |align=\"center\"|5 | Sebastian Vettel |align=\"left\"|22 |- !colspan=4|Source: |} ;Constructors' Championship standings {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" ! ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | Constructor ! scope=\"col\" | Points |- |align=\"left\"| 10px |align=\"center\"|1 | Mercedes |align=\"left\"|87 |- |align=\"left\"| 10px |align=\"center\"|2 | Ferrari |align=\"left\"|48 |- |align=\"left\"| 10px |align=\"center\"|3 | Red Bull Racing-Honda |align=\"left\"|31 |- |align=\"left\"| |align=\"center\"|4 | Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |align=\"left\"|10 |- |align=\"left\"| 10px 4 |align=\"center\"|5 | McLaren-Renault |align=\"left\"|8 |- !colspan=4|Source: |} * Note: Only the top five positions are included for both sets of standings. == See also == * 2019 Sakhir Formula 2 round ==References== ==External links== * The race on Formula1.com Bahrain Category:Bahrain Grand Prix Grand Prix Bahrain Grand Prix ",
