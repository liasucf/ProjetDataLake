Some moviegoers claimed that they bought tickets for My Bebe Love but instead, were given tickets for Beauty and the Bestie. SM Cinema confirmed through its Twitter account that this incident occurred in SM City Bacoor. According to SM Cinema, the incident was \"a mistake due to high volume of tickets purchased\". They also assured the public that this transaction will be counted fairly for the gross sales of My Bebe Love. These tweets were later deleted for unknown reasons. On the other hand, the Metro Manila Film Festival committee released a contrary statement regarding this issue. It is stated that they \"strongly denies the existence of such\" incident and they called the issue \"baseless\". The House committee on Metro Manila Development, chaired by Quezon City Representative Winston Castelo, started the probe on the disqualification case of Honor Thy Father and the ticket-swapping incidents in January 2016. ===Honor Thy Father disqualification=== On December 26, Honor Thy Father, was disqualified by the Metro Manila Film Festival Executive Committee from the Best Picture category after the film failed to disclose its participation as the opening film of the 2015 Cinema One Originals Film Festival. On the contrary, Dondon Monteverde, the film's producer, revealed that they did disclose this information beforehand. He attested that its premiere at the Cinema One festival didn't generate revenue which complies by the rules. He also questioned the timing of this decision, one day before the awards ceremony, and he demanded an investigation. In an interview dated on November 2, 2015, MMFF Executive Committee member Dominic Du revealed to Philippine Entertainment Portal that the film did comply with the rules as the Cinema One premiere wasn't a commercial screening. On December 28, Laguna Representative Dan Fernandez, who is part of the cast of Honor Thy Father, filed a resolution that directs the House of Representatives to conduct an inquiry regarding the disqualification of Honor Thy Father. The committee on Metro Manila Development, chaired by Quezon City Representative Winston Castelo, started the probe on the disqualification case of Honor Thy Father and the ticket-swapping incidents in January 2016. ===Pullout of Nilalang and Honor Thy Father from some cinemas=== Nilalang director Pedring Lopez and co- producer Wesley Villarica expressed dismay over the pullout of their film and co-entrant film, Honor thy Father from some cinemas in favor of My Bebe Love and Beauty and the Bestie. Villarica noted that his film, was shown in 20 cinemas in Metro Manila and 7 theaters outside the metropolis in the opening day on December 25, but by next day less than 20 cinemas are screening his film. Honor Thy Father writer Michiko Yamamoto said that her film was pulled out from ten theaters the day after the opening day of the festival. ===Conflict of interest against Dominic Du=== During the House probe on the MMFF irregularities, it was revealed that Dominic Du, a member of MMFF Executive Committee have a conflict of interest with the Best Picture winner, #Walang Forever and 2nd Best Picture winner, Buy Now, Die Later. Dominic Du owns the company, Axinite Digicinema, that helped promote the said two films. He also serves as a legal counsel of Joji Alonso, the producer of both films. ==Box Office gross== The Metro Manila Development Authority was criticized for not releasing official earnings of each film. This led to some film studios releasing their own earnings. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text align: center\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !rowspan=2|Entry !colspan=6|Gross Ticket Sales |- !December 27 !January 7 |- |Beauty and the Bestie |data-sort-value=\"2\"|\u20b1 131,000,000 |data-sort-value=\"1\" style=\"background:#BFFFC0;\"|\u20b1 428,000,000* |- |My Bebe Love |data-sort-value=\"1\" style=\"background:#BFFFC0;\"|\u20b1 159,000,000* |data-sort-value=\"2\"| |- |#Walang Forever |data-sort-value=\"3\"|\u20b1 36,000,000 |data-sort-value=\"3\"| |- |Haunted Mansion |data-sort-value=\"4\"|\u20b1 29,000,000 |data-sort-value=\"4\"| |- | |'''''' |\u20b1 1,020,000,000 |} == References == == External links == * Category:Metro Manila Film Festival MMFF MMFF MMFF MMFF MMFF Category:December 2015 events in Asia Category:January 2016 events in Asia nl:Metro Manila Film Festival tl:Paligsahan ng mga Pelikula ng Kalakhang Maynila ",
