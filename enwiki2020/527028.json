    "text": "This is a list of frigate classes of the Royal Navy of the United Kingdom (and the individual ships composed within those classes) in chronological order from the formal creation of the Royal Navy following the Restoration in 1660. Where the word 'class' or 'group' is not shown, the vessel was a 'one-off' design with just that vessel completed to the design. The list excludes vessels captured from other navies and added to the Royal Navy. All frigates built for the Royal Navy up to 1877 (when the Admiralty re-categorised all frigates and corvettes as \"cruisers\") are listed below. The term \"frigate\" was resuscitated in World War II and subsequent classes are listed at the end of this article, but the individual ships within those classes are not listed in this article. ==The frigate before 1660== The initial meaning of frigate in English/British naval service was a fast sailing warship, usually with a relatively low superstructure and a high length:breadth ratio\u2014as distinct from the heavily armed but slow \"great ships\" with high fore- and after-castles. The name originated at the end of the 16th century, the first \"frigats\" being generally small, fast-sailing craft, in particular those employed by Flemish privateers based on Dunkirk and Flushing. Subsequently, the term was applied to any vessel with these characteristics, even to a third-rate or fourth-rate ship of the line. In this list, the term is restricted to fifth rates and sixth rates which did not form part of the battlefleet (i.e. were not ships of the line); many of the earliest ships described as English frigates, such as of 1645, were third-rate or fourth-rate ships of the line and thus are not listed below. As the Royal Navy was not officially created until 1660, vessels from the preceding (Commonwealth) era are only included where they survived past 1660. Prizes taken from enemy naval forces and added to the Royal Navy are also excluded. ===Fifth-rate frigates before 1660=== Fifth rates were essentially two-decked vessels, with their main battery on the lower deck and a lesser number of guns of lesser power on the upper deck (as well as even smaller guns on the quarter deck). * Vessels of 1653\u20131656 Programmes: ** \u2013 launched 23 February 1654 ** Islip \u2013 launched 25 March 1654 (wrecked 24 July 1655) ** Fagons \u2013 launched 22 May 1654, renamed HMS Milford in 1660 ** Selby \u2013 launched 22 April 1654, renamed HMS Eagle in 1660 ** Basing \u2013 launched 26 April 1654, renamed HMS Guernsey in 1660 ** Grantham \u2013 launched 1654, renamed HMS Garland in 1660 ** \u2013 launched 11 September 1655 ** \u2013 launched September 1655 ** \u2013 launched 22 September 1655 ** Cheriton \u2013 launched 16 April 1656, renamed HMS Speedwell in 1660 ** Wakefield \u2013 launched November 1656, renamed HMS Richmond in 1660 ** \u2013 launched November 1656 ** \u2013 launched 3 September 1657 ** Bradford \u2013 launched March 1658, renamed HMS Success in 1660 ===Sixth- rate frigates before 1660=== Sixth rates were single-decked vessels, with a battery on the (single) gun deck, and usually some lesser guns on the quarter deck. * Vessels of 1651 Programme: ** \u2013 launched 1652 ** \u2013 launched 1652 ** \u2013 launched 1652 ==Frigates from 1660 to 1688== ===Fifth-rate frigates from 1660 to 1688=== Charles Galley was an early galley-frigate with a bank of sweeps above the waterline, the last of these types (Royal Anne Galley) being launched in 1709. * Vessels of 1665 Programme: ** \u2013 launched 1665 ** \u2013 launched 21 March 1666 ** \u2013 launched 1666 *Vessels of 1668\u20131669 Programmes: ** \u2013 launched 22 December 1668 ** \u2013 launched 31 March 1671 * Vessels of 1670s construction: ** \u2013 launched September 1674 ** \u2013 launched 29 June 1675 ** \u2013 32 guns, launched 1676, rebuilt 1693, renamed HMS Torrington in 1729 after two further rebuilds ===Sixth-rate frigates from 1660 to 1688=== * Designed and built by Anthony Deane at Harwich ** \u2013 launched July 1666 ** \u2013 launched 24 July 1666 ** \u2013 launched 1666 * Designed and built by Anthony Deane at Portsmouth ** \u2013 launched 28 October 1669 ** \u2013 launched July 1672 * Designed and built by Sir Anthony Deane at Blackwall ** \u2013 launched 11 June 1675 ==Frigates from 1688 to 1719== For ships before the 1745 Establishment, the term 'class' is inappropriate as individual design was left up to the master shipwright in each Royal dockyard. For other vessels, the Surveyor of the Navy produced a common design for ships which were to be built under a commercial contract rather than in a Royal Dockyard. Consequently, the term 'group' is used as more applicable for ships built to similar specifications (and to the same principal dimensions) but to varying designs. ===Fifth-rate frigates from 1688 to 1719=== *HMS Mermaid 1689 \u2013 32 guns. *Experiment group \u2013 32-gun fifth rates 1689\u20131691 **HMS Experiment 1689 **HMS Pembroke 1690 **HMS Milford 1690 **HMS Portsmouth 1690 **HMS Sheerness 1691 *HMS Adventure 1691 \u2013 40 guns. *HMS England purchased 1693 \u2013 40 guns. *HMS Charles Galley \u2013 32 guns, launched 1676, rebuilt 1693, renamed Torrington in 1727 after two more rebuilds *Shoreham group \u2013 32-gun fifth rates 1694 **HMS Shoreham 1694 **HMS Scarborough 1694 **HMS Sorlings 1694 **HMS Winchelsea 1694 *Lyme group \u2013 32-gun fifth rates 1695\u20131698 **HMS Lyme 1695 **HMS Hastings (i) 1695 **HMS Milford 1695 **HMS Arundel 1695 **HMS Rye 1696 **HMS Scarborough 1696 **HMS Looe (i) 1696 **HMS Lynn 1696 **HMS Fowey 1696 **HMS Southsea Castle (i) 1696 **HMS Gosport 1696 **HMS Poole 1696 **HMS Feversham 1696 **HMS Hastings (ii) 1698 **HMS Lowestoffe 1697 **HMS Looe (ii) 1697 **HMS Southsea Castle (ii) 1697 **HMS Bridgewater 1698 **HMS Ludlow 1698 *Lark group \u2013 42-gun fifth rates 1703\u20131706 **HMS Hector 1703 **HMS Lark 1703 **HMS Greyhound 1703 **HMS Garland 1703 **HMS Folkestone 1703 **HMS Roebuck 1704 (40 guns only) **HMS Sorlings 1706 *1706 Establishment group \u2013 42-gun fifth rates 1707\u20131715 The Navy Board ordered sixteen of these vessels between 1705 and 1711 as 42-gun vessels. The remaining pair\u2014Looe and Diamond\u2014were not ordered but rather the Navy Board purchased them on the stocks from the shipbuilder who had commenced building them \"on spec\". All the vessels were armed under the 1703 Guns Establishment with a main battery of nine-pounder guns. Under the 1716 Guns Establishment, a 40-gun ship with a main battery of 12-pounder guns superseded the 42-gun ship. Hence, the last six of the ships listed below were completed as 40-gun ships. **HMS Ludlow Castle 1707 \u2013 broken up 1721 **HMS Gosport 1707 \u2013 broken up 1735 **HMS Portsmouth 1707 \u2013 broken up 1728 **HMS Hastings 1707 \u2013 sold for breaking 1745 **HMS Looe 1707 \u2013 sunk as a breakwater 1737 **HMS Diamond 1708 \u2013 broken up 1721 to rebuild **HMS Sapphire 1708 \u2013 sold for breaking 1745 **HMS Enterprize 1709 \u2013 sold for breaking 1749 **HMS Pearl 1708 \u2013 broken up 1723 to rebuild **HMS Southsea Castle 1708 \u2013 broken up 1723 to rebuild **HMS Adventure 1709 \u2013 broken up 1724 to rebuild **HMS Mary Galley 1708 \u2013 broken up 1721 to rebuild **HMS Fowey 1709 \u2013 renamed Queenborough 1744, sold for breaking 1746 **HMS Royal Anne Galley 1709 \u2013 wrecked 1721 **HMS Charles Galley \u2013 launched 1676, rebuilt 1693 and 1710 \u2013 renamed Torrington 1729, broken up 1744 **HMS Launceston 1711 \u2013 broken up 1726 to rebuild **HMS Faversham 1712 \u2013 broken up 1730 to rebuild **HMS Lynn 1715 \u2013 broken up 1732 ===Sixth-rate frigates from 1688 to 1719=== Before the \"true\" sail frigate came into being in the 1740s, the equivalent was the single-deck cruising vessel of the sixth rate, armed with either 20, 22 or 24 guns, which established itself in the 1690s and lasted until the arrival of the new \"true\" frigates. Before 1714, many small sixth rates carried fewer than 20 guns, and these have been excluded from this list. For over half a century from the 1690s, the main armament of this type was the 6-pounder gun, until it was replaced by nine-pounder guns just prior to being superseded by the 28-gun sixth-rate frigate. *Maidstone group 24-gun sixth rates 1693\u20131697 **HMS Maidstone 1693 **HMS Jersey 1694 **HMS Lizard (i) 1694 **HMS Newport 1694 **HMS Falcon 1694 **HMS Queenborough 1694 **HMS Swan 1694 **HMS Drake 1694 **HMS Solebay 1694 **HMS Seahorse 1694 **HMS Bideford 1695 **HMS Penzance 1695 **HMS Dunwich 1695 **HMS Orford 1695 **HMS Lizard (ii) 1697 **HMS Flamborough 1697 **HMS Seaford 1697 **HMS Deal Castle 1697 *HMS Seaford 24-gun sixth rate purchased 1695 *HMS Peregrine Galley 20-gun sixth rate 1700 *Nightingale group 24-gun sixth rates 1702\u20131704 **HMS Nightingale 1702 **HMS Squirrel (i) 1703 **HMS Squirrel (ii) 1704 *Aldborough group 24-gun sixth rates purchased 1706 **HMS Aldborough 1706 **HMS Nightingale 1707 **HMS Deal Castle 1706 *Flamborough group 24-gun sixth rates 1707 **HMS Flamborough 1707 **HMS Squirrel 1707 *Gibraltar group 20-gun sixth rates 1711\u20131716 **HMS Solebay 1711 **HMS Gibraltar 1711 **HMS Port Mahon 1711 **HMS Blandford 1711 **HMS Hind 1712 **HMS Seahorse 1712 **HMS Rose 1712 **HMS Bideford 1712 **HMS Success 1712 **HMS Greyhound 1712 **HMS Lively 1713 **HMS Speedwell 1716 *HMS Dursley Galley 20-gun sixth rate 1719 ==Frigates from 1719 to 1750== For ships before the 1745 Establishment, the term 'class' is inappropriate as individual design was left up to the master shipwright in each Royal dockyard. For other vessels, the Surveyor of the Navy produced a common design for ships which were to be built under a commercial contract rather than in a Royal Dockyard. Consequently, the term 'group' is used as more applicable for ships built to similar specifications laid down in the Establishments but to varying designs. However, from 1739 almost all fifth and sixth rates were built under contract and were thus to a common class. ===Fifth-rate frigates from 1719 to 1750=== * 1719 Establishment 40-gun fifth rates 1721\u20131733 All thirteen were rebuilds of earlier 40-gun ships (Torrington and Princess Louisa were renamed when rebuilt from the former Charles Galley\u2014first launched in 1679\u2014and Launceston respectively), although Anglesea and Adventure were authorised as 'Great Repairs' rather than as rebuildings. ** 1721 \u2013 broken up 1742 ** 1723 \u2013 broken up 1744 ** 1724 \u2013

Allin, 1749, armed with 20 nine-pounder canons on the upper deck and four three-pounders on the quarterdeck \u2013 wrecked off the Coast of South Carolina on 06.01.1760 Two nominally 24-gun ships \u2013 the Lyme and Unicorn \u2013 were built in 1747\u20131749 with 24 nine-pounders on the upper deck but also carried four smaller guns on the quarterdeck. There were no more guns on the lower deck that was lowered to the waterline; the pair were designated as 24-gun ships (disregarding the smaller guns) until 1756, when they were re-classed as 28-gun frigates. However other 24-gun and 20-gun ships continued to be built, with either 22- or 29-pounder guns on the upper deck. *Lyme class 28-gun sixth rates 1748 **HMS Lyme 1748 \u2013 wrecked in the Baltic off the Swedish Coast on 18.10.1760 **HMS Unicorn 1748 \u2013 broken up 1771 ==44-gun fifth rates from 1750 \u2013 by class== Those fifth-rate ships were not frigates in a stricter sense, being two-deckers, but they were mostly used in the same way, e.g. convoy protection. In addition they were too small to sail in the line of battle. Thus they are listed here. In the middle of the 18th century, those ships had a more powerful armament than the frigates at that time (these were nine and 12-pounders equipped), that consisted of 18-pounders on the gun deck. Later in the century, with the advent of the 18-pounder frigate (the first British 18-pounder armed frigate, HMS Flora (36), was launched in 1780), those ships became obsolete and ceased to being built in 1787, when the last one, HMS Sheerness, was launched. Many continued to serve until after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, most of them as troop- or storeships. * Phoenix 1759 \u2013 wrecked 1780 * Roebuck class 1774\u201383 (Thomas Slade) ** HMS Roebuck 1774 \u2013 hospital ship 1790, troopship 1799, floating battery 1803, broken up 1811 ** HMS Romulus 1777 \u2013 taken by France 1781 ** HMS Actaeon 1778 \u2013 hulked 1793 ** HMS Janus 1778 \u2013 troopship 1789, wrecked 1800 ** HMS Charon (I) 1778 \u2013 sunk 1781 ** HMS Dolphin 1781 \u2013 hospital ship 1781, troopship 1800, storeship 1804, broken up 1817 ** HMS Ulysses 1779 \u2013 sold 1816 ** HMS Serapis (I) 1779 \u2013 taken by John Paul Jones' Bonhomme Richard 1779 ** HMS Endymion 1779 \u2013 lost 1790 ** HMS Assurance 1780 \u2013 troopship 1791, transport 1796, hulked 1799 ** HMS Argo 1781 \u2013 troopship 1791, sold 1816 ** HMS Diomede 1781 \u2013 lost 1795 ** HMS Guardian 1784 \u2013 sold 1791 ** HMS Mediator 1782 \u2013 storeship and renamed Camel 1788, broken up 1810 ** HMS Regulus 1785 \u2013 troopship 1800, broken up 1816 ** HMS Resistance 1782 \u2013 blown up 1798 ** HMS Serapis (II) 1782 \u2013 storeship 1798, broken up 1819 ** HMS Gladiator 1783 \u2013 hulked 1807 ** HMS Experiment 1784 \u2013 troopship, 1793, hulked 1805 ** HMS Charon (II) 1783 \u2013 hospital ship 1794, troopship 1800, broken up 1805 * Adventure class 1784\u201387 (William Hunt) ** HMS Adventure 1784 \u2013 troopship 1799, hulked 1801, broken up 1816 ** HMS Chichester 1785 \u2013 troopship 1787, storeship 1794, sold 1810 ** HMS Expedition 1784 \u2013 troopship 1798, hulked 1810, broken up 1817 ** HMS Gorgon 1785 \u2013 storeship 1793, floating battery 1805, broken up 1817 ** HMS Woolwich 1785 \u2013 troopship 1793, storeship 1798, troopship 1813, wrecked 1813 ** HMS Severn 1786 \u2013 wrecked 1804 ** HMS Dover 1786 \u2013 transport 1795, accidentally burnt and then broken up 1806 ** HMS Sheerness 1787 \u2013 completed as troopship, wrecked 1805 ==Sail frigates from 1750 \u2013 by class== Following the success of the Lyme and Unicorn in 1748, the mid-century period saw the simultaneous introduction in 1756 both of sixth-rate frigates of 28 guns (with a main battery of 24 nine- pounder guns, plus four lesser guns mounted on the quarterdeck and/or forecastle) and of fifth-rate frigates of 32 or 36 guns (with a main battery of 26 12-pounder guns, plus six or ten lesser guns mounted on the quarterdeck and/or forecastle). The American Revolution saw the emergence of new fifth rates of 36 or 38 guns which carried a main battery of 18-pounder guns, and were thus known as \"heavy\" frigates, while the French Revolutionary War brought about the introduction of a few 24-pounder gun armed frigates. In the 1830s, new types emerged with a main battery of 32-pounder guns. ===9-pounder armed post ships=== After 1750, the official Admiralty criteria for defining a frigate required a minimum battery of 28 carriage-mounted guns, including such guns which were mounted on the quarterdeck and forecastle. The Admiralty categorized the smaller sixth rates, of frigate-type construction, but carrying between 20 and 26 guns, as \"post ships\", but seagoing officers often referred to then as \"frigates\" even though this was not officially recognised. The post ships, generally of 20 or 24 guns, were in practice the continuation of the earlier sixth rates. The Napoleonic War era post ships were later re- armed with (many being completed with) 32-pounder carronades instead of nine- pounder guns; after 1817 most of the survivors (except the Conway class), were re-classified as sloops. *Gibraltar class 20 guns, 1754\u201356; built to the lines of the French privateer Tygre captured in 1747. **HMS Gibraltar 1754 \u2013 broken up 1773 **HMS Biddeford 1756 \u2013 wrecked 1761 **HMS Flamborough 1756 \u2013 sold 1772 **HMS Aldborough 1756 \u2013 broken up 1772 **HMS Kennington 1756 \u2013 broken up 1774 **HMS Lively 1756 \u2013 captured by France 1778, recaptured 1781, sold 1784 **HMS Mercury 1756 \u2013 wrecked 1777 **HMS Scarborough 1756 \u2013 foundered 1780 *Seaford class 20 guns, 1754\u201357; built to the lines of HM Yacht Royal Caroline of 1749. **HMS Seaford 1754 \u2013 sold 1784 **HMS Rose 1757 \u2013 scuttled to block Savannah Bar 1779 **HMS Glasgow 1757 \u2013 accidentally burned 1779 *Squirrel class 20 guns, 1755\u201356; like the Seaford class built to the lines of HMY Royal Caroline. **HMS Squirrel 1755 \u2013 sold 1783 **HMS Deal Castle 1756 \u2013 lost off Puerto Rico in the Great West Indian Hurricane of 1780 *Sphinx class 20 guns 1775\u201381; designed by John Williams **HMS Sphinx 1775 \u2013 broken up 1811 **HMS Camilla 1776 \u2013 hulked 1809, sold 1831 **HMS Daphne 1776 \u2013 taken by France 1795, retaken 1797, sold 1802 **HMS Galatea 1776 \u2013 broken up 1783 **HMS Ariadne 1776 \u2013 sold 1814 **HMS Vestal 1777 \u2013 foundered off Newfoundland 1777 **HMS Perseus 1776 \u2013 converted to bomb vessel 1798, broken up 1805 **HMS Unicorn 1776 \u2013 captured by France 1780, recaptured 1781, broken up 1787 **HMS Ariel 1777 \u2013 taken by French l'Amazone in 1779 **HMS Narcissus 1781 \u2013 wrecked off New Providence 1796 *Porcupine class 24 guns, 1777\u201381; designed by John Williams **HMS Porcupine 1777 \u2013 broken up 1805 **HMS Pelican 1776 \u2013 wrecked in a hurricane near Jamaica 1781 **HMS Eurydice 1781 \u2013 hulked as receiving ship 1814, broken up 1834 **HMS Hyena 1778 \u2013 captured by the French 1793, retaken 1797, reclassed as 20-gun ship 1798, sold 1802 **HMS Penelope 1778 \u2013 cast away or foundered in the West Indies in November 1779 **HMS Amphitrite 1778 \u2013 wrecked off Livorno 1794 **HMS Crocodile 1781 \u2013 wrecked on the Scilly Rocks off Prawle Point 1784 **HMS Siren 1779 \u2013 wrecked near Beachy Head 1781 **HMS Pandora 1779 \u2013 wrecked off the Coast of Queensland, Australia, in 1791 while carrying the surviving mutineers of HMS Bounty back to England for trial **HMS Champion 1779 \u2013 hulked as receiving ship 1809, sold 1816 *HMS Myrmidon 22 guns 1781; built to the lines of Amazone a French privateer captured in 1745 \u2013 hulked 1798, broken up 1811 *HMS Squirrel 24 guns 1785; designed by Edward Hunt \u2013 hulked as a receiving ship 1812, sold 1817 *Banterer class 22 guns 1806\u201307; designed by William Rule **HMS Banterer 1807 \u2013 wrecked in the Saint Laurence Stream 1808 **HMS Crocodile 1806 \u2013 broken up 1816 **HMS Daphne 1806 \u2013 sold 1816; became merchantman and last listed in 1824 **HMS Cossack 1806 \u2013 broken up 1816 **HMS Cyane 1806 \u2013 taken by USS Constitution 1815 **HMS Porcupine 1807 \u2013 sold 1816; became mercantile Windsor Castle and was broken up at Mauritius in 1826 *Laurel class 22 guns 1806\u201312; designed by John Henslow **HMS Laurel 1806 \u2013 taken by -France 1808, retaken and renamed Laurestinus 1810, wrecked in the Bahamas 1813 **HMS Boreas 1806 \u2013 wrecked on the Guernsey coast 1807 **HMS Comus 1806 \u2013 wrecked at Newfoundland 1816 **HMS Garland 1807 \u2013 sold 1817 **HMS Perseus 1812 \u2013 hulked as receiving ship 1816, broken up 1850 **HMS Volage 1807 \u2013 sold 1818 *Hermes class 20 guns 1811\u201316; flush-decked sixth rates based on the lines of the French corvette Bonne Citoyenne (1794) taken in 1796; only the last two of the class were given quarterdecks and forecastles in 1820\u201321, making them post ships **HMS Hermes 1811 \u2013 grounded and burnt by her crew near Mobile, Alabama, 1814 **HMS Myrmidon 1813 \u2013 broken up 1823 **HMS Ariadne 1816 \u2013 post ship (26 guns) 1820, hulked 1837, sold 1841 **HMS Valorous 1816 \u2013 post ship (26 guns) 1821, broken up 1829 *Cyrus class flush-decked 20-gun sixth rates 1813\u201314; the design was based on HMS Myrmidon of the Hermes class above, so can be considered a development of that class.

radically change the nature of the frigate. Initial trials were with paddle-driven vessels, but these had numerous disadvantages, not least that the paddle wheels restricted the numbers of guns that could be mounted on the broadside. So the application of the screw propellor meant that a full broadside could still be carried, and a number of sail frigates were adapted, while during the 1850s the first frigates designed from the start to have screw propulsion were ordered. It is important to remember that all these early steam vessels still carried a full rig of masts and sails, and that steam power remained a means of assistance to these vessels. In 1887 all frigates and corvettes in the British Navy were re-categorised as 'cruisers', and the term 'frigate' was abolished, not to re-emerge until the Second World War, at which time it was resurrected to describe a totally different type of escort vessel. ===Paddle-driven frigates=== Although iron hulls were used for some warships in the 1840s, almost all the paddle frigates were wooden-hulled. The exception was the ill-fated Birkenhead. * ' 1839\u201344 \u2013 second class, originally classed just as 'steam vessels' ** 1839 ** 1843 ** 1842 ** 1844 * 1844 \u2013 second class, originally classed just as a 'steam vessel' * ' 1845 \u2013 second class, originally classed just as 'steam vessels' ** 1845 ** 1845 * 1843 \u2013 first class, originally built as a sailing frigate in 1829 * 1844 \u2013 first class, originally classed just as a 'steam vessel' * 1845 \u2013 first class, originally classed just as a 'steam vessel' * 1845 \u2013 first class * (ex-Vulcan) iron-hulled frigate 1845 \u2013 second class, launched as a frigate but completed as a troopship in 1847 * 1846 \u2013 first class * 1846 \u2013 first class * 1850 \u2013 second class * 1849 \u2013 second class * ' 1849 \u2013 second class ** 1849 ** 1851 * ' 1850 \u2013 second class ** 1850 ** HMS Resolute \u2013 cancelled 1850 ===Screw-driven frigates=== In the mid-1840s, the Admiralty ordered four iron-hulled, screw- driven frigates from specialist shipbuilders; however, the Admiralty then rapidly lost faith in the ability of iron hulls to stand up to combat conditions, and all four (Greenock, Vulcan, Megaera and Simoom) were converted while under construction into troop transports, although the Greenock was promptly sold for commercial use. Following this unsuccessful experiment, though iron hulls were used for some warships in the 1840s, almost all the screw frigates below were wooden-hulled. The exceptions were the final three below \u2013 Inconstant, Shah and Raleigh \u2013 which had iron hulls. *HMS Amphion 1846 \u2013 the prototype screw frigate *HMS Arrogant 1848 \u2013 first class *Dauntless class 1847 \u2013 second class **HMS Dauntless 1847 **HMS Vigilant \u2013 cancelled 1849 *Termagant class 1847 \u2013 second class **HMS Termagant 1847 **HMS Euphrates \u2013 cancelled 1849 *Tribune class 1853 \u2013 second class **HMS Tribune 1853 **HMS Curacoa 1854 *Imperieuse class 1852 **HMS Imperieuse 1852 **HMS Euryalus 1853 **HMS Aurora 1861 **HMS Forte 1858 **HMS Chesapeake 1855 *Liffey class 1856 **HMS Liffey 1856 **HMS Shannon 1855 **HMS Topaze 1858 **HMS Bacchante 1859 **HMS Liverpool 1860 *Diadem class 1856\u201357 **HMS Diadem 1856 **HMS Doris 1857 *Ariadne class 1859 **HMS Ariadne 1859 **HMS Galatea 1859 *Emerald class 1856 **HMS Emerald 1856 **HMS Melpomene 1857 **HMS Immortalite 1859 *Mersey class 1858 **HMS Orlando 1858 **HMS Mersey 1858 *HMS Narcissus 1859 *Bristol class 1860 **HMS Newcastle 1860 **HMS Glasgow 1861 **HMS Bristol 1861 **HMS Undaunted 1861 ** Ten further vessels to this design were cancelled in 1863\u201364 \u2013 Tweed, Dryad, Belvidera, Pomone, Raleigh, Briton, Barham, Boadicea, Bucephalus and Dextrous. *Ister class 1865 **HMS Endymion 1865 ** Four further vessels to this design were cancelled in 1863\u201364 \u2013 Ister, Blonde, Astrea and Dartmouth. *HMS Inconstant iron-hulled frigate 1868 *HMS Shah iron-hulled frigate 1873 *HMS Raleigh iron-hulled frigate 1873 ==Modern frigates \u2013 by class== The term 'frigate' was revived during World War II for a new type of escort vessel and has been employed continuously since that period. Note that, unlike the previous sections, no lists of the individual ships comprising each class are shown below the class names; the individual vessels are to be found in the articles on the separate classes. * River class \u2013 138 ships, 1941\u20131944 * Colony class \u2013 21 ships * Captain class \u2013 78 ships * Loch class \u2013 26 ships * Bay class \u2013 21 ships (redesigned Loch class for anti-aircraft escort) * Type 15 \u2013 23 ships (full rebuilds of World War II destroyer hulls) * Type 16 \u2013 10 ships (partial rebuilds of wartime destroyer hulls) * Type 41 Leopard class \u2013 4 ships * Type 61 Salisbury class \u2013 4 ships * Type 12 Whitby class \u2013 6 ships * Type 12M Rothesay class \u2013 9 ships * Type 12I Leander class \u2013 26 ships (subclasses: 8 Batch 1, 8 Batch 2, 10 Batch 3) * Type 14 Blackwood class \u2013 12 ships * Type 81 Tribal class \u2013 7 ships * Type 21 Amazon class \u2013 8 ships * Type 22 \u2013 14 ships (subclasses: Broadsword 4, Boxer 6, Cornwall 4) * Type 23 Duke class \u2013 16 ships * Type 26 City class \u2013 3 ordered, 8 ships planned * Type 31 frigate \u2013 at least 5 ships planned ==Sail frigates \u2013 alphabetically== Note that frigate names were routinely re-used, so that there were often many vessels which re-used the same names over the course of nearly two centuries.
