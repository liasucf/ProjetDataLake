    "text": "The 1970 Washington State Cougars football team was an American football team that represented Washington State University in the Pacific-8 Conference (Pac-8) during the 1970 NCAA University Division football season. In their third season under head coach Jim Sweeney, the Cougars compiled a 1\u201310 record (0\u20137 in Pac-8, last), and were outscored 460 to 231. The team's statistical leaders included Ty Paine with 1,581 passing yards, Bob Ewen with 667 rushing yards, and Ed Armstrong with 488 receiving yards. Due to the fire at Rogers Field in April, all home games were played at Joe Albi Stadium in Spokane in 1970 and 1971\\. AstroTurf was installed there in the summer of 1970. For the second straight year, Washington State played a full conference schedule and went winless. The only victory was in September over neighbor Idaho in the Battle of the Palouse, the sole meeting in a three-year span. The annual rivalry game was not played the previous season (and in 1971) to allow the Cougars to schedule all seven conference opponents. ==Schedule== ==Roster== : ==NFL Draft== For the first time in five years, no Cougars were selected in the 1971 NFL Draft. * List of Washington State Cougars in the NFL Draft ==References== ==External links== *Game program: Idaho vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 September 19, 1970 *Game program: Stanford vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 October 17, 1970 *Game program: USC vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 November 7, 1970 *Game program: Oregon State vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 November 14, 1970 * Game program: Washington vs. WSU at Spokane \u2013 November 21, 1970 Washington State Category:Washington State Cougars football seasons Washington ",
