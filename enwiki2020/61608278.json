    "text": "Little Nightmares 2 (stylized as Little Nightmares II) is an upcoming puzzle- platformer horror adventure game developed by Tarsier Studios and being produced by Bandai Namco Entertainment. The game was announced at Gamescom 2019 as the sequel to Little Nightmares, and will feature a new player character, Mono, with the protagonist from the previous game, Six, as a computer-controlled character. The game is set to be released for Microsoft Windows, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 11 February 2021, with versions for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S released at a later date in the same year. == Plot == The game takes place after Six escapes from the Maw. She later meets Mono, a boy wearing a brown paper bag as a mask, and must work with him to navigate through the Pale City and reach the Black Tower, which is controlled by the mysterious Thin Man (who was previously seen at the end of Secrets of the Maw possibly creating this story). Locations found throughout the Pale City include the Wilderness, the School, the Hospital, and the Black Tower. There will also be new enemies and other characters to be discovered such as the Hunter (who Mono rescues Six from at the start of the game), the Teacher, the Students, Mannequins, a monster that resides in the Hospital, the Viewers, and the Thin Man. ===Premise=== A young boy named Mono experiences a dream where he sees the door with an eye at the end of a hallway. He wakes up in a dense forest near a TV. After covering his head with a paper bag with eyeholes, he proceeds to make his way through the Wilderness. While exploring the forest, Mono encounters many traps and corpses of people who accidentally fell into them. He eventually reaches a shack owned by the taxidermy-obsessed Hunter. He finds Six (without her raincoat), who had somehow made it shore following her escape from the Maw and was apparently captured by the Hunter, imprisoned in one of the rooms. Although he offers to help her, she immediately runs away, rejecting his help. In pursuit of her, Mono discovers people who have been turned into effigies. Near the attic, he catches up to Six, who agrees to work with Mono upon realizing that she cannot escape alone. Together they escape from the shack, but the Hunter, who was skinning an animal, hears them leave and pursuits them, taking a shotgun and flashlight with him. They are able to lose him by jumping under a small cliff up ahead, but he moves forward and stands in a spot, looking for them. Mono and Six gain courage by holding each other's hands and carefully evade the Hunter until they make a break for it, nearly killing them until they both duck in a small hole. == References == ==External links== * Category:Bandai Namco games Category:Upcoming video games scheduled for 2021 Category:Horror video games Category:Nintendo Switch games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:PlayStation 5 games Category:Puzzle-platform games Category:Survival video games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Sweden Category:Video game sequels Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Xbox Series X and Series S games ",
