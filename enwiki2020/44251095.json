It stars James Mason, Neville Brand, Kate Manx, Rip Torn, Warren Oates and Brendan Dillon. It was released on September 16, 1962, by United Artists. The film, set in the early 18th century, is about a poor family homesteading on a remote Carolina island, leading to encounters with seagoing vagabonds, good and bad. It was filmed on location on California's Santa Catalina Island, which is much hillier and more arid than any actual part of the coastal Carolinas. ==Plot== == Cast == *James Mason as Jacob Weber *Neville Brand as Kingstree *Kate Manx as Devon Mainwaring *Rip Torn as Nicholas Gates *Warren Oates as Wayte Giddens *Brendan Dillon as Thomas Mainwaring *Dean Stanton as Dixey Gates *Robert Sampson as Enoch Gates *Morgan Mason as Cullen *Darby Hinton as Jafar *John Hudkins as Bullock *Bobby Johnson as Pound *William Hart as Meggett == References == == External links == * * Category:1962 films Category:1960s action drama films Category:American action drama films Category:American films Category:English- language films Category:United Artists films Category:Films set in the 1710s Category:Films set in North Carolina Category:Films set on islands Category:1960s historical films Category:American historical films Category:1962 drama films ",
