    "text": "Neil Terence Columba Blaney (1 October 1922 \u2013 8 November 1995) was an Irish politician. He was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in 1948 as a Fianna F\u00e1il Teachta D\u00e1la (TD) representing Donegal East. Blaney served as Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1957), Minister for Local Government (1957\u20131966) and Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (1966\u20131970). He was Father of the D\u00e1il from 1987 until his death. ==Early life== Neil Blaney was born in 1922 in the rural Fanad Peninsula in the north of County Donegal, in Ireland. The second eldest of a family of eleven, Blaney's father Neal had been a commander of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Donegal during the War of Independence and the Civil War. He served as both a TD and as a Senator between 1927 and 1948. It was from his father that Blaney got his strong republican views and his first introduction to politics. He was educated locally at Tamney on the rugged Fanad Peninsula and later attended St Eunan's College in Letterkenny as a boarder. Blaney later worked as an organiser with the Irish National Vintners and Grocers Association. ==Early political career== Blaney was first elected to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann for the Donegal East constituency in a by-election in December 1948, following the death of his father from cancer. He also became a member of Donegal County Council. Upon his election Blaney was the youngest member of the D\u00e1il. He remained on the backbenches for a number of years before he was one of a group of young party members handpicked by Se\u00e1n Lemass to begin a re- organisation drive for the party following the defeat at the 1954 general election. Within the party Blaney gained fame by running the party's by- election campaigns throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He introduced the concept of cavalcades after his election victories in his constituency together with roadside bonfires. At the time this was an alien political concept in Ireland. Blaney also adopted wearing sunglasses, chewing gum and wearing bright ties and colourful suits. His dedicated bands of supporters earned the sobriquet 'the Donegal Mafia', and succeeded in getting Des O'Malley and Gerry Collins elected to the D\u00e1il. ==Ministerial career== Following Fianna F\u00e1il's victory at the 1957 general election \u00c9amon de Valera, as Taoiseach, brought new blood into the Cabinet in the shape of Blaney, Jack Lynch, Kevin Boland and M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in. Blaney was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, becoming the first government minister from Donegal, however, he moved to the position of Minister for Local Government at the end of 1957 following the death of Se\u00e1n Moylan. Blaney proved to be an innovative minister and his first task as minister was to prepare the groundwork for the referendum to scrap the proportional representation electoral system and replace it with the first- past-the-post voting system. The referendum failed to be passed, however, Blaney was retained in the post when Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959. In 1963 he introduced the Planning Act to rationalise planning throughout the local authorities in the state. This act also created the agency, An For\u00e1s Forbatha, to bring planning experts together. His department underwent a very large programme to provide piped water to rural homes. In 1965 Blaney introduced the Road Traffic Act which required that motorists take a driving test in roadworthy cars. During his tenure it became possible to pay rates (property taxes) by instalment and he also introduced legislation which entitled non-nationals to vote in local elections. In 1966 Lemass resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna F\u00e1il leader. The subsequent leadership election saw George Colley and Charles Haughey emerge as the two front-runners. Blaney was unimpressed with the choice and, with the support of the like-minded Kevin Boland, he threw his hat in the ring, declaring himself to be the \"Radical Republican\" candidate. However outside the Northwest and apart from Boland, Blaney failed to attract much support. After some pressure from Lemass the Cork politician, Jack Lynch, entered the race and was deemed to be an unbeatable candidate. Haughey and Boland withdrew in support of Lynch, however, Colley forced a contest. He was defeated heavily with Lynch becoming party leader and Taoiseach. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Blaney was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries. ==Arms Crisis== In 1969, when conflict broke out in Northern Ireland, Blaney was one of the first to express strong Irish republican views, views which contradicted the policy of the Irish Government, in support of Northern nationalists. Blaney was a native of Ulster and was affected by the outbreak of violence in parts of his home province. He was concerned about the plight of the Nationalist majority in West Tyrone and in Derry, areas that bordered his constituency in West Ulster. From around late 1968 onwards, Blaney formed and presided over an unofficial Nationalist group in Leinster House popularly known as 'the Letterkenny Table', so named because this group of politicians used to meet at a certain table in either the D\u00e1il bar or the D\u00e1il restaurant. The group was dominated by Blaney up until his death. He had also been one of a four-member Cabinet sub-committee set up to decide on government policy to Northern Ireland together with Haughey, P\u00e1draig Faulkner and Joseph Brennan. A fund of \u00a3100,000 was set up to give to the nationalist people in the form of aid. However, those involved have denied that the government supported the importation of arms. There was general surprise when, in an incident known as the Arms Crisis, Blaney, along with Haughey, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the IRA.RT\u00c9 Television \u2013 Hidden History Opposition leader Liam Cosgrave was informed by the Garda that a plot to import arms existed and included government members. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the D\u00e1il next day if he didn't act. Lynch asked for Haughey and Blaney's resignations. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then advised President de Valera to sack Haughey and Blaney from the government. Boland resigned in sympathy, while M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure that he was not the Minister for Justice when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Des O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a Belgian businessman who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. After trial all the accused were acquitted but many of their critics refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although Blaney was cleared of wrongdoing, his ministerial career was brought to an end. Lynch subsequently moved against Blaney so as to isolate him in the party. He was defeated by George Colley in a vote for the position of Joint Honorary Treasurer at the 1971 Ardfheis, while his constituency colleague, Liam Cunningham, had been appointed a Parliamentary Secretary in the cabinet reshuffle. In the D\u00e1il Blaney abstained on a motion of no confidence on the worthiness of cabinet minister Jim Gibbons for office, sponsored by the opposition. Paudge Brennan and Desmond Foley acted similarly and, while the government survived, they were all expelled from the parliamentary party. When Blaney and his supporters tried to organise the party's national collection independently Lynch acted and in 1972 Blaney was expelled from the Fianna F\u00e1il party for 'conduct unbecoming'. ==Independent Fianna F\u00e1il== Following his expulsion from Fianna F\u00e1il, Kevin Boland tried to persuade Blaney to join the Aontacht \u00c9ireann party he was creating but Blaney declined. Instead, he contested all subsequent elections for Independent Fianna F\u00e1il \u2013 The Republican Party, an organisation that he built up, chiefly in the County Donegal constituencies from disaffected members of the Fianna F\u00e1il party who remained loyal to him along with a large number of Republicans. Throughout the 1970s there were frequent calls for his re-admittance to Fianna F\u00e1il but the most vocal opponents of this move were Fianna F\u00e1il delegates from County Donegal. At the 1979 European elections Blaney topped the poll in the Connacht\u2013Ulster constituency to the annoyance of Fianna F\u00e1il. He sat in the Technical Group of Independents and served as chair of the group along with the Italian Radical Marco Pannella and Danish left-wing Eurosceptic Jens-Peter Bonde. He narrowly lost the seat at the 1984 election but was returned to serve as an MEP in 1989 election where he sat with the regionalist Rainbow Group. He also canvassed for IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, in which Sands was elected to Westminster. Blaney held his D\u00e1il seat until his death from cancer at the age of 73 on 8 November 1995 in Dublin. In the resulting by-election on 2 April 1996, the Fianna F\u00e1il candidate reclaimed the seat. However, Blaney's brother, Harry Blaney, was elected as an Independent Fianna F\u00e1il TD at the 1997 general election. He was replaced by his son, Niall Blaney, who was elected at the 2002 general election. But in July 2006 Niall rejoined Fianna F\u00e1il. This was opposed by other members of the Blaney family, including all seven children of Neil Blaney and his widow Eva, who issued a press release prior to Niall Blaney's decision castigating the Fianna F\u00e1il party and disassociating themselves from any so called 'truce' with them. ==Legacy== A road in Letterkenny is named the Neil T. Blaney Road in his honour. ==See also== *Families in the Oireachtas ==References== ==External links== * Category:1922 births Category:1995 deaths Neil Category:Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Independent Fianna F\u00e1il TDs Category:Independent MEPs for Ireland Category:Irish farmers Category:Members of the 13th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 14th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 15th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 16th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 17th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 18th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 19th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 20th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 21st D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 22nd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 23rd D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 24th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 25th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 26th D\u00e1il Category:Members of the 27th D\u00e1il Category:MEPs for the Republic of Ireland 1979\u20131984 Category:MEPs for the Republic of Ireland 1989\u20131994 Category:Ministers for Agriculture (Ireland) Category:People educated at St Eunan's College Category:Politicians from County Donegal ",
