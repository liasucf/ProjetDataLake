    "text": "Skylitzis Chronicle. Bolli Bollason (also Bolli Bollison) was a key historical character in the Medieval Icelandic Laxd\u00e6la saga, born around 1000. He grew up in Orlygsstadir, at Helgafell on the Sn\u00e6fellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. He divided his time between Helgafell and Tunga, the home of Snorri the Go\u00f0i. He was held in the highest regard among the contemporary Scandinavian rulers, and also in the Eastern Roman Empire. It is believed that he had reached the rank of manglabites in the Eastern Roman army,Heath, p 38 and on his return to Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name \"Bolli the Elegant\".Thorsson, p 419 His importance in the literary context of the saga is his prominence as the son of Bolli \u00deorleiksson and Gu\u00f0r\u00fan \u00d3sv\u00edfursd\u00f3ttir, the two central characters of the work. He is mentioned at the end of the Sneglu-Hall \u00fe\u00e1ttur (The Tale of Sarcastic Halli), and is also the subject of his own tale, the Bolla\u00fe\u00e1ttur, which was later appended to the end of the manuscripts in the early 14th century. ==Laxd\u00e6la saga== ===Background=== A page of Nj\u00e1l's saga from the M\u00f6\u00f0ruvallab\u00f3k, the same vellum manuscript containing the Laxd\u00e6la saga and the Bolla\u00fe\u00e1ttur The Laxd\u00e6la saga or Saga of the People of Laxardal is an Icelandic family saga written sometime between 1250 and 1270, possibly by a woman author.Thorsson, p 270Thorsson, p 274-275 \"Vast in conception\", the grand sweep of the saga's action spans well over a century from AD 890 to 1030. Alongside Nj\u00e1l's saga and Egil's saga, the Laxd\u00e6la saga makes the strongest claim of any Icelandic saga for literary greatness.Thorsson, p xii Shaped by continental literary traditions and several types of saga, the characterisation \"highlights nobility, splendour and physical appearance\", although: The saga is also a feud saga, in which \"feuds escalate from trivial local squabbles into unstoppable vendettas. The male protagonists are splendid figures who die heroic deaths, while the women are strong characters who engineer much of the action\".Thorsson, p lxi Many manuscripts of the Laxd\u00e6la saga have survived, although all printed versions have been based upon the M\u00f6\u00f0ruvallab\u00f3k (dated 1330-1370), the only intact vellum manuscript.Thorsson, p 275 Historiographically, the distinction between narrative and history did not exist at the time when the sagas were written.Thorsson, p xxx However, the sagas develop a \"dense and plausible\" historical context,Thorsson, p xxxv with the authenticating detailsThorsson, p xxvii and precision necessary for the narrative.Thorsson, p xxxvii The world within which the local and detailed stories of the individual sagas exist can be confirmed by archaeology and comparison with histories in other languages.Thorsson, p xxxi ===Account=== ====Family and early life==== Sn\u00e6fellsnes, where Bolli was born. Bolli Bollason was one of the People of Lax\u00e1rdalur, in the Western Quarter of Iceland. He was born in 1006 to Gu\u00f0r\u00fan \u00d3sv\u00edfursd\u00f3ttir, the winter after the killing of his father, Bolli \u00deorleiksson. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan had been courted by Bolli \u00deorleiksson and his foster-brother Kjartan \u00d3lafsson, but although she preferred Kjartan, she gave herself to Bolli \u00deorleiksson on the basis of a false rumour that Kjartan was engaged. The consequent hostilities between the two foster-brothers ended with Bolli \u00deorleiksson killing Kjartan, and then he in turn being killed by Kjartan's kinsmen. Bolli Bollason grew up with his brother Thorleik, who was four years his senior, and his mother Gu\u00f0r\u00fan in Helgafell, after she exchanged homes with the renowned Snorri the Go\u00f0i. Gu\u00f0r\u00fan remarried, this time to Thorkell Eyjolffsson, who became a great chieftain in his own countryside and took over the running of the household at Helgafell. This left Bolli able to spend his time both at Helgafell and with Snorri in Tunga, and Snorri became very fond of him. Thorkell was fond of both his stepsons, but Bolli was regarded as \"being the foremost in all things\". Thorleik journeyed abroad to Norway, and stayed with King Olaf II for several months. When Bolli was eighteen years old he asked for his father's portion, as he intended to woo Thordis Snorradottir, the daughter of Snorri Go\u00f0i. He set out with his stepfather and a good many followers to Tunga. Snorri welcomed them, and the wedding feast took place that summer. Bolli abode at Tunga, and love grew between him and Thordis. The next summer, Thorleik returned in a goods-laden ship to White-river, \"and the brothers greeted each other joyfully\". The two brothers made peace with the sons of \u00d3laf, Kjartan's kinsmen, at the Thorness Thing; it is not known how much money was exchanged in compensation as part of the agreement, but Bolli received a good sword, and after the assembly \"both sides were thought to have gained in esteem from these affairs\". ====Travels abroad==== cog of the type that Bolli might have taken to Denmark. Bolli's later travels abroad with his brother Thorleik are well documented and notable for his role in the Varangian Guard. They departed Iceland, taking \"a great deal of money abroad with him\", and reached Norway in the autumn. They stayed in Thrandheim for the winter, while King Olaf II was wintering in the east in Sarpsborg. Bolli soon became highly thought of in Norway, and his arrivals at the guild meeting- places were noted for being better arrayed as to raiment and weapons than other townsfolk. Early in the spring the brothers prepared their ship and went east to meet the king. The king thought Bolli \"a man of high mettle,\" \"even peerless among men\", and \"the man of greatest mark that has ever come from Iceland.\" Bolli boarded a trade-ship bound for Denmark, departing King Olaf in great friendship and with fine parting gifts.[Note 2] Thorleik remained behind, but Bolli wintered in Denmark and became as well regarded as he had been in Norway. Travelling next to Constantinople, he spent many years in the Varangian Guard; \"and was thought to be the most valiant in all deeds that try a man, and always went next to those in the forefront.\" The saga also records the finery his followers received from the Roman Emperor (most likely Romanos III), and the influence he held after his return to Iceland, some time after the death of King Olaf II:Thorsson The right to bear a gold-hilted sword was one of the privileges of the court rank of manglabites, and is taken as an indicator that Bolli held this rank. In Iceland, his finery and recognition earned him the name \"Bolli the Elegant\". His return to Thordis was joyful, and he took over the manor of Tunga when Snorri died at 67 years of age. Bolli had two children with Thordis: Herdis Bolladottir and Ospak Bollason. ==Tales== ===Bolla\u00fe\u00e1ttur=== The Althing at \u00deingvellir, which Bolli attended the same year he killed Thorolf Stuck-up In Norse literature, a tale or \u00fe\u00e1ttur referred to a short narrative often included as an episode in a larger whole, such as part of a saga.Thorsson, p 757 The Bolla \u00fe\u00e1ttur Bollasonar, or Bolli Bollason's Tale, is such a narrative about an episode in the life of Bolli Bollason, taken from the 14th century M\u00f6\u00f0ruvallab\u00f3k which contains the Laxd\u00e6la saga.Thorsson, p 422 According to the tale, a man called Thorolf Stuck-up had a bull which wounded his neighbours' farm animals, damaged haystacks and caused \"a great deal of trouble\". When an upstanding local farmer named Thord saw the bull damaging the stacks of peat on his farm at Marbaeli, he lunged at the animal with a spear and struck it dead.Thorsson, p 422-423 In revenge, Thorolf killed Thord's seven- or eight-year-old son Olaf, to the disgust of Thorolf's wife and kinsmen.Thorsson, p 423 Thorolf fled and eventually secured the protection of Thorvald Hjaltasson, a prominent leader who lived at Hjaltadal.Thorsson, p 422-424 After Christmas, Thorvald secured for him the safekeeping and support of Starri of Guddalir, who often sheltered outlaws.Thorsson, p 424-425 Thord's wife Gudrun, a first cousin of Bolli, asked him to take over the prosecution of the case.Thorsson, p 424 Accompanied by Arnor Crone's-nose and a large company of men, Bolli attended the Hegranes Assembly.Thorsson, p 425 Thorvald and Starri intended to block the prosecution \"by force of arms and numbers\", but when they realised they were outnumbered, they withdrew and Bolli successfully had Thorolf outlawed. Passage out of Iceland was obtained for Thorolf aboard a merchant vessel at Hrutafjord.Thorsson, p 426 However, Bolli believed it would have been improper if the outlawed Thorolf were to escape, and having ridden north to Hrutafjord, he drew his sword Leg-biter and \"struck a blow right through\" Thorolf, killing him. ===Sneglu-Halla \u00fe\u00e1ttr=== Bolli died during the reign of Harald III of Norway, as is recorded at the end of The Tale of Sarcastic Halli. The tale makes reference to Bolli's military prowess, in ironic contrast to the tale's protagonist: ==Notes== ==Footnotes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Translation in English by Muriel Press (The Temple Classics, London, 1899) *Text with modern Icelandic spelling *Laxd\u00e6la saga in an English translation by Muriel A.
