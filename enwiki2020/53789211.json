O'Neall stood for re-election as mayor. The main challengers to O'Neall were John Akerman, a Republican, and former mayor Edwin M. Capps, a Democrat. Also contesting the race were Andrew Swanson, a Socialist, and Robert McNair, an independent. On March 23, 1915, Akerman received the highest number of votes in the primary election, followed by Capps. Akerman and Capps advanced to the general election, while Mayor O'Neall, who received little more than half the votes of the front-running Akerman, was eliminated from contention. On April 6, 1915 Capps received a majority of more than two thousand votes more than Akerman in the runoff and was elected mayor for a second, non-consecutive term. ==Primary Election results== ==General Election results== ==References== 1915 Category:1915 California elections 1915 Category:1915 United States mayoral elections Category:April 1915 events ",
