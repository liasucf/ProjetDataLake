Despite this, the country is in the grip of a salami addiction crisis. International Agents Blackstone and Blodgett (Clark and McCullough) are hired by Nikki (Charles Irwin), the Prime Minister, to find out who is smuggling 4% garlic salami into the kingdom. Blackstone and Blodgett accidentally intercept a secret message that reveals that the illegal salami is being delivered to the Wiggle Inn. Posing as waiters, they capture the smuggler Disputin (Francis McDonald) at the inn and attempt to interrogate him, but he refuses to talk even after being squirted with seltzer water. Leaving Disputin tied to a chair, Blackstone and Blodgett report their progress to King Pfui (Ferdinand Munier), who is impressed but suggests that a fire hose might be more effective. Little do any of them suspect that Queen Olga (Leni Stengel), with her Ladies in Waiting, is the mastermind behind the smuggling ring. When nobody is watching, she unties Disputin and takes his place in the chair. When King Pfui is led to the captive, he is outraged to find the queen tied up, and threatens to have Blackstone's and Blodgett's heads\u2014but they are saved when the ceiling collapses under the weight of the six tons of salami hidden there. As masses of contraband sausage rain down on the group, Blackstone declares the whole affair \"just a lot of baloney\".Internet Movie Database Leni Stengel with Bobby Clark and Paul McCullough in Kickin' the Crown Around (1933) == Cast == *Bobby Clark as Blackstone - The \"Diplomat\" *Paul McCullough as Blodgett *Ferdinand Munier as King Pfui *Leni Stengel as The Queen *Francis McDonald as Disputin *Eddie Baker as Manager - Wiggle Inn *Neal Burns as Messenger *Charles Irwin as Nikki, the Prime Minister ==References== == External links == * * Category:1933 films Category:American films Category:1933 comedy films Category:RKO Pictures short films Category:English- language films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American comedy films Category:Comedy short films ",
