One of the monkeys on the mosque grounds Saka Tunggal mosque is located in Cikakak, Wangon, Banyumas, Central Java, approximately southwest of the regency's capital Purwokerto. It is about from the main road, over a paved road which, , is badly damaged. The site lacks public toilets or other facilities for tourists. Near the mosque is a graveyard where Kyai Tulih is buried. This graveyard is surrounded by a bamboo fence and divided into three parts: the upper, middle, and lower cemetery. Each part of the cemetery has its own juru kunci (caretaker). Every year on the 26th day of Rajab, the bamboo fence (jaro in Javanese) surrounding the cemetery is replaced in a ceremony known as Jaro Rohab. Men replace the fence, beginning near the grave of Kyai Tulih then continuing on in the direction of the mosque. Meanwhile, women prepare food for a ritual known as slametan; the ceremony is done by the cemetery's three juru kunci. The Jaro Rojab ritual is intended to commemorate the Night Journey of the prophet Muhammad and to spiritually cleanse the participants. It attracts Muslims from much of Central and West Java, including representatives of the Surakarta Sunanate in Surakarta. The area around the mosque is home to thousands of monkeys. These monkeys often come to the mosque area, though they are not supposed to be fed by tourists. The monkeys are considered sacred by the local residents, and thus may not be killed or injured. During the dry season they may attack residents' homes, stealing food or other objects. ==See also== *Mosques in Indonesia ==References== ==Works cited== * * * * * ==External links== * Category:Banyumas Regency Category:Mosques completed in 1871 Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in Central Java Category:Mosques in Indonesia Category:Tourist attractions in Central Java ",
