    "text": "Hoeyang County is a kun, or county, in Kangw\u014fn province, North Korea. It was established in a general reorganization of local government in 1952. ==Geography== The county's area is primarily mountainous, with the Taebaek and Kwangju ranges both passing through the county. Two basins, the Hoeyang Basin and Changdo Basin, interrupt the rugged terrain. The highest point is Piryubong on K\u016dmgangsan. The chief local stream is the Pukhan River, which flows south and east into South Korea. The climate is continental, with extremely cold winters. ==Administrative divisions== Hoeyang county is divided into 1 \u016dp (town) and 23 ri (villages): {| |- | valign=\"top\" | * Hoeyang-\u016dp * Ch\u014fngong-ri * Ch\u014fnhang-ri * Hagyo-ri * Hy\u014fl-li * Kaj\u014fng-ri * Kangdol-li * K\u016dmch'\u014fl-li * K\u016dmgong-ri * Kwangj\u014fl-li * Kwirang-li * Maj\u014fl-li | valign=\"top\" | * Obong-ri * Orang-ri * Pongp'o-ri * P'och\u014fl-li * Ryongp'o-ri * Singye-ri * Sinmy\u014fng-ri * Sinp'y\u014fng-ri * S\u014fndae-ri * Sop'ung-ri * Tonam-ri * Yu\u016dp-ri |} ==Economy== The chief local industry is agriculture, although the terrain does not permit rice to be cultivated; instead, local crops include barley, wheat, oats, millet, maize, soybeans, and potatoes. Cattle are also raised. The maize-based y\u014ft candy from the district is widely known. Local mines work to extract the deposits of tungsten, barite, molybdenum, graphite, gold, silver, and lead found in the county. ==Transportation== Hoeyang is served by roads, and also by the K\u016dmgangsan Ch'\u014fngny\u014fn Line of the Korean State Railway. ==See also== *Geography of North Korea *Administrative divisions of North Korea *Kangwon (North Korea) ==External links== * Category:Counties of Kangwon Province (North Korea) zh:\u6dee\u967d\u90e1 ",
