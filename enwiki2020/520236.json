    "text": "Frank O'Connor (born Michael Francis O'Donovan; 17 September 1903 \u2013 10 March 1966) was an Irish writer of over 150 works, best known for his short stories and memoirs. The Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award is named in his honour. ==Early life== Raised in Cork, the only child of Minnie (n\u00e9e O'Connor) and Michael O'Donovan, he attended Saint Patrick\u2019s School on Gardiner's Hill and North Monastery CBS. O'Connor's early life was marked by his father's alcoholism, debt, and ill-treatment of his mother. His childhood was shaped in part by his mother, who supplied much of the family's income by cleaning houses, because his father was unable to keep steady employment due to his drunkenness. O'Connor adored his mother and was bitterly resentful of his father. In his memoirs, he recalled his childhood as \"those terrible years\", and admitted that he had never been able to forgive his father for his abuse of himself and his mother.O'Connor, Frank, My Father's Son (Pan Books edition 1971) p.136 When his mother was seventy, O'Connor was horrified to learn from his own doctor that she had suffered for years from chronic appendicitis, which she had endured with great stoicism, as she had never had the time nor the money to see a doctor.My Father's Son, chapter 16 p.133 ==Irish nationalism== In 1918 O'Connor joined the First Brigade of the Irish Republican Army and served in combat during the Irish War of Independence. He opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921 and joined the Anti-Treaty IRA during the Irish Civil War, working in a small propaganda unit in Cork City. He was one of twelve thousand Anti-Treaty combatants who were interned by the government of the new Irish Free State. Between 1922 and 1923 O'Connor was imprisoned in Cork City Gaol and in Gormanston, County Meath.McKeon, James, Frank O'Connor-a life (Mainstream Publishing Edinburgh 1998) p.49 ==Literary career== Following his release, O'Connor took various positions including that of teacher of Irish, theatre director, and librarian. He began to move in literary circles and was befriended by George William Russell (\u00c6), through whom he came to know most of the well-known Irish writers of the day, including Yeats, Lennox Robinson, F. R. Higgins and Augusta Gregory. In his memoirs, he pays tribute to both Yeats and Russell for the help and encouragement they gave him. In 1935, O'Connor became a member of the board of directors of the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, founded by W. B. Yeats and other members of the Irish National Theatre Society.My Father's Son, by Frank O'Connor, Black Staff Press, (Belfast 1968), p.153. In 1937, he became managing director of the Abbey. Following Yeats's death in 1939, O'Connor's long-standing conflict with other board members came to a head and he left the Abbey later that year.My Father's Son, p. 188. In 1950, he accepted invitations to teach in the United States, where many of his short stories had been published in The New Yorker and won great acclaim. He spent much of the 1950s in the United States, although it was always his intention to return eventually to Ireland.My Father's Son, note on the author, unnumbered ==Death== O'Connor had a stroke while teaching at Stanford University in 1961, and he later died from a heart attack in Dublin, Ireland on 10 March 1966. He was buried in Deans Grange Cemetery on 12 March 1966.Frank O'Connor profile, wiu.edu; accessed 9 November 2014. ==Family== In 1939 O'Connor married Evelyn Bowen (who had previously been married to the actor Robert Speaight): they had two sons, among them Oliver O'Donovan, and a daughter.McKeon p.122 They were divorced in 1953. O'Connor married, secondly, Harriet Rich of Baltimore, whom he met while lecturing at Northwestern University. They had one daughter.McKeon p.162 ==Work== O'Connor was perhaps best known for his varied and comprehensive short stories but also for his work as a literary critic, essayist, travel writer, translator and biographer.Frank O'Connor Page; accessed 2006-10-26. He was also a novelist, poet and dramatist.Frank O'Connor's Collected Stories, Introduction, Knopf: New York, 1981. p. xii From the 1930s to the 1960s he was a prolific writer of short stories, poems, plays, and novellas. His work as an Irish teacher complemented his plethora of translations into English of Irish poetry, including his initially banned translation of Brian Merriman's C\u00fairt an Mhe\u00e1n O\u00edche (The Midnight Court). Many of O'Connor's writings were based on his own life experiences \u2013 notably his well-known The Man of the House in which he reveals childhood details concerning his early life in County Cork. The Sullivan family in this short story, like his own boyhood family, is lacking a proper father figure. In other stories, his character Larry Delaney, in particular, is reminiscent of events in O'Connor's own life. O'Connor's experiences in the Irish War of Independence and the Irish Civil War are reflected in The Big Fellow, his biography of Irish revolutionary leader Michael Collins, published in 1937, and one of his best-known short stories, Guests of the Nation (1931), published in various forms during O'Connor's lifetime and included in Frank O'Connor \u2013 Collected Stories, published in 1981. O'Connor's early years are recounted in An Only Child, a memoir published in 1961 which has the immediacy of a precocious diary. U.S. President John F. Kennedy remarked anecdotally from An Only Child at the conclusion of his speech at the dedication of the Aerospace Medical Health Center in San Antonio on 21 November 1963: \"Frank O'Connor, the Irish writer, tells in one of his books how, as a boy, he and his friends would make their way across the countryside, and when they came to an orchard wall that seemed too high and too doubtful to try and too difficult to permit their voyage to continue, they took off their hats and tossed them over the wall\u2014and then they had no choice but to follow them. This nation has tossed its cap over the wall of space and we have no choice but to follow it.\"The Kennedy Library, Boston, Mass., Speech of 21 November 1963, Dedication of Aerospace Medical Health Center, San Antonio, Texas. O'Connor continued his autobiography through his time with the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, which ended in 1939, in his book, My Father's Son, which was published in 1968, posthumously. It contains valuable character sketches of many of the leading Irish literary figures of the 1930s, in particular Yeats and Russell (who wrote with the pseudonyms \u00c6 and \u00c6on).McKeon p.174 ==Frank O'Connor Festival and Prize== Since 2000, The Munster Literature Centre in O'Connor's hometown of Cork has run a festival dedicated to the short story form in O'Connor's name. The longest established annual festival dedicated to the short story form in an English-speaking country, it regularly hosts readings, workshops and masterclasses for contemporary practitioners of the form, as well as celebrating the work of O'Connor and other local short fiction writers such as Elizabeth Bowen, Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in and William Trevor.Munster Literature Centre Festivcal, munsterlit.ie; accessed 9 November 2014. The festival has hosted readings by: Richard Ford, Julia O'Faolain, James Lasdun, Alasdair Gray, Dan Rhodes, Eugene McCabe, Bernard MacLaverty, Desmond Hogan, James Plunkett, Lyudmila Ulitskaya, Rebecca Miller, Anne Enright, Mike McCormack, Etgar Keret, \u00c9il\u00eds N\u00ed Dhuibhne, C\u00f3nal Creedon, Samrat Upadhyay, Philip \u00d3 Ceallaigh, Rachel Sherman, David Marcus, Panos Karnezis, Nisha da Cunha, William Wall, Bret Anthony Johnston, David Means, Claire Keegan, Miranda July, Rick Moody, Jhumpa Lahiri, Yiyun Li, Julie Orringer, ZZ Packer, Simon Van Booy, Wells Tower, Charlotte Grimshaw and Kevin Barry among others. It also has a tradition of encouraging younger writers at the start of their career, Jon Boilard for example. The Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award, is awarded to the best short fiction collection published in English anywhere in the world in the year preceding the festival. The prize is also open to translated works and in the event of a translation winning the prize is divided equally between author and translator. The award is described as \"the richest prize for the short story form\" and at \u20ac35,000 in 2010 is one of the most valuable literary prizes for any category of literature. ==In popular culture== O\u2019Connor's short story \"Guests of the Nation\" has been filmed several times. The story is set during the Irish War of Independence and chronicles the doomed friendship between the members of an I.R.A. unit and the two British Army hostages whom they are guarding.McKeon p.80 The first film was a silent in 1934, directed by Denis Johnston and featuring Barry Fitzgerald and Cyril Cusack. Neil Jordan's award-winning film The Crying Game was inspired in part by this story. ==Bibliography== ===Short story collections=== * Guests of the Nation (1931), including the famous title story. * Bones of Contention (1936), including the story \"The Majesty of Law\", a short story adapted as an episode of the 1957 film The Rising of the Moon. * Crab Apple Jelly (1944) * The Common Chord (1947) * Traveller's Samples (1951), including the classic story \"First Confession\". * The Stories of Frank O'Connor (1952), including the first publication of perhaps his most popular story \"My Oedipus Complex\". * More Stories by Frank O'Connor (1954) * Domestic Relations (1957) * A Set of Variations (1969) * The Cornet Player Who Betrayed Ireland (1981) * The Collected Stories (Edited by Richard Ellmann) (1981) * The Collar: Stories of Irish Priests (1993) * A Frank O'Connor Reader (1994) * First Confession (1950) *My Oedipus Complex (1950) ===Novels=== * The Saint and Mary Kate (1932) * Dutch Interior (1940) ===Autobiography=== * * ===Poetry from the Irish=== * The Wild Bird's Nest (1932) * Lament for Art O'Leary (1940) *The Midnight Court (1945) * Kings, Lords, and Commons (1959) * The Little Monasteries (1963) ===Irish history=== * The Big Fellow, biography of Michael Collins (1937) ===Travel writing=== *Irish Miles (1947) * Leinster, Munster and Connaught (1950) ===Criticism=== * The Road to Stratford (1948; revised edition published in 1960\u201361 in the US as Shakespeare's Progress) * The Mirror in the Roadway: A Study of the Modern Novel (1956) * The Lonely Voice: A Study of the Short Story (1962) * The Backward Look: A Survey of Irish Literature (1967) ==See also== * Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award * List of people on stamps of Ireland ==References== ==Further reading== *Irish Writers on Writing featuring Frank O'Connor.
