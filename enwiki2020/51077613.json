    "text": "\"Sei bellissima\" is an Italian ballad song written by Claudio Daiano and Gian Pietro Felisatti and performed by Loredana Bert\u00e8. During the years Bert\u00e8 claimed to be the actual composer of the song, but that at the time she was unable to sign it as she was not a member of SIAE. According to Bert\u00e8, lyrics were inspired by her relationship with Adriano Panatta. The musical arrangement by Vince Tempera was inspired by Riccardo Cocciante's \"Bella senz'anima\". The song premiered at the 1975 Un disco per l'estate, being eliminated from the competition; nevertheless, the single was a commercial success, peaking at the thirteenth place on the Italian singles chart. The song was the first hit for Bert\u00e8, following the commercial failure of her debut album Striking. The verse \"a letto mi diceva sempre non vali che un po' pi\u00f9 di niente\" (i.e. \"in bed he used to say 'you are not worth a bit more than anything'\") was initially censored and replaced by \"e poi mi diceva sempre non vali che un po' pi\u00f9 di niente\" (\"and then he used to say 'you are not worth a bit more than anything'\"). A version with the original lyrics was eventually released the same year. ==Track listing== *7\" single \u2013 CGD 3247 :A \"Sei bellissima\" (Claudio Daiano, Gian Pietro Felisatti) \u2013 4:50 :B \"Spiagge di notte\" (Daniele Pace) \u2013 3:00 ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Italy |align=\"center\"|13 |} ==References== Category:Loredana Bert\u00e9 songs Category:1975 singles Category:1975 songs Category:Compagnia Generale del Disco singles Category:Songs written by Gian Pietro Felisatti ",
