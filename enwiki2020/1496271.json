The name Honeoye is from the Seneca word ha-ne-a- yah, which translates to \"lying finger\", or \"where the finger lies\". The name refers to the local story of a Native American who had his finger bitten by a rattlesnake and therefore cut off his finger with a tomahawk. ==Course== Honeoye Creek emerges from the north end of Honeoye Lake, one of the Finger Lakes, in the town of Richmond, Ontario County. The hamlet of Honeoye within Richmond is located on the creek where it passes under US Route 20A. As Honeoye Creek flows northward, it is joined by the Hemlock Outlet Creek and then becomes the border between Ontario County and Livingston County. The stream flows into Monroe County, passing the village of Honeoye Falls in Mendon, where it flows over a waterfall. Honeoye Creek then continues in a westerly direction and enters the Genesee River in West Rush, near Avon. ==See also== *List of rivers in New York == References == == External links == *USGS hydrology information Category:Genesee River Category:Rivers of Livingston County, New York Category:Rivers of Monroe County, New York Category:Rivers of Ontario County, New York Category:Rivers of New York (state) ",
