He moved with his family to Melbourne at the age of six. Growing up, Vasiljevic played soccer, tennis, and cricket, and did not begin playing basketball until the age of 12. His father attempted to mold him after Croatian basketball player Drazen Petrovic and enrolled his son at the Australian Institute of Sport.

He posted 9.0 points and 2.5 rebounds per game as a sophomore, while shooting 41.1 percent from three-point range.

As a junior, Vasiljevic averaged 11.8 points and 4.5 rebounds per game on a team that finished 14-18. Following his junior season, Vasiljevic considered turning professional, but was persuaded to return by coach Jim Larra\u00f1aga. On 21 November 2019, he scored a career-high 25 points including the two clinching foul shots with 1.2 seconds remaining in a 74-70 win over Missouri State. As a senior, Vasiljevic averaged 13.2 points and 4.2 rebounds per game. He scored 1,271 points in his college career, ranking 21st on the Hurricane\u2019s all-time list, and is second in made three-pointers with 272. ==Professional career== ===Sydney Kings (2020\u2013present)=== On 17 July 2020, Vasiljevic signed a three-year deal with the Sydney Kings of the National Basketball League (NBL). ==National team career== Vasiljevic has represented Australia at several international tournaments.
