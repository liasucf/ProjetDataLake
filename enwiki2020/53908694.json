    "text": "Liturgusa krattorum is a species of mantis that was discovered by Dr. Gavin Svenson and Cleveland Museum of Natural History. These species of mantis are mainly found in Peru. They live in tall trees, are ambush predators, and are also fast runners mainly because they hunt other insects. The species was named after Martin Kratt and Chris Kratt, the hosts of Kratts' Creatures, Zoboomafoo, and Wild Kratts on PBS Kids, as well as Be the Creature on National Geographic. == See also == * List of mantis genera and species ==Wild Kratts== In 2017, a special episode of the PBS Kids' original show Wild Kratts with the same name of the animal was dedicated to this event, and was released on PBS Kids featuring the animated counterparts of the Kratt Brothers adventuring with the species named after them. In the live-action closing of the episode, the episode featured a special thanks to Dr. Gavin Svenson. The brothers personally thank Dr. Gavin Svenson for naming the bug after them. == References == Category:Liturgusidae ",
