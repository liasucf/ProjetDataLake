    "text": "Flashback is the fourth studio album by Swedish singer/songwriter Darin Zanyar. It was released on 3 December 2008 in Sweden and became Darin's fourth top 10 album. It features the physical singles \"Breathing Your Love\" and \"What If\", plus the digital singles \"Runaway\" and \"See U At The Club\". This is the first album to see Darin contributing both musically and lyrically, this occurs on all but one track. The song \"Karma\" feat. David Jassy was released to the Swedish radio station \"The Voice\" and held the position 12 at the \"Voice Topp 20\". ==History== In summer 2007 Darin went back into the studio to start work on his 4th studio album with producers such as Murlyn Music, Johan Bob\u00e4ck and RedOne, who have worked with acts such as Akon and Michael Jackson. Flashback has taken longer to complete than any of Darin\u2019s previous albums, and he has also taken part in writing the music and lyrics in a completely different manner than before saying \"I have been writing songs since I was 14 years old, I have taken part in writing and co-producing all of the songs except for one on this record. It is important to me that people understand that I write my songs myself, since many don't think this is the case\". Speaking on his official site about some of the tracks written for the album Darin says of the songs... Darin enlisted the help of American singer Kat DeLuna for the lead single Breathing Your Love which was produced by RedOne with whom DeLuna had previously worked. The single was released in October 2008 and charted at number 2 on the Swedish singles chart. ==Track listing== # \"Breathing Your Love\" (featuring Kat Deluna) 3:53 (Darin/Bilal Hajji/Novel/RedOne) # \"Seasons Fly\" 3:02 (Linda Sundblad/Johan \"JB\" Bob\u00e4ck/Darin) # \"Road Trip\" 4:45 (Ilya KnocDown/David Jassy/Darin) # \"Dance\" 3:33 (A.
