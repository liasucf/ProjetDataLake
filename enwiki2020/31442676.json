    "text": "Calostemma purpureum, the garland lily, is a long-lived perennial flowering plant that is native to South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. Flowers may be cream, yellow, pink or purple. Related to the common daffodil, garland lilies were once common in large colonies in grassy areas, in particular the plain on which the city of Adelaide now stands. Due to urbanisation and grazing, the garland lily is now rare, only occurring in small pockets in parks on the outskirts of the city. Leaves form from the bulb during winter, and die off during spring. The plant flowers during summer when there are no leaves. Calostemma purpureum bursts into flower in the midst of the heat of an Australian summer, when most other plants are not flowering. The flowers are purple-pink in colour forming in an umbel of 5-10 showy flowers. They appear on a stalk around 30 centimetres long. The flowers are replaced in autumn by clusters of large, berry-like seeds. The seeds may germinate while still on the plant. They germinate very readily but it may take three or four years before the new plant first flowers. ==Image gallery== Image:P2208182 Calostemma purpureum 01.jpg | Flower head Image:P2208182 Calostemma purpureum 03.jpg|Large colony near Gunnedah, NSW Image:16 Calostemma purpureum - Narrabri 01.jpg| Differently coloured flowers Image:16 Calostemma purpureum - Narrabri 02.jpg|Bicoloured flowers Image:16 Calostemma purpureum - Narrabri 03.jpg|Field of mixed colours Image:16 Calostemma purpureum - Narrabri 04.jpg|Developing fruit == References == ==External links== * * Category:Amaryllidoideae Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Flora of Queensland Category:Flora of South Australia Category:Flora of Victoria (Australia) Category:Plants described in 1810 Category:Taxa named by Robert Brown (botanist, born 1773) ",
