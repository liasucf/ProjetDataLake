    "text": "\"Take a Chance on Me\" is a song by the Swedish pop group ABBA. It was released in January 1978 as the second single from their fifth studio album ABBA: The Album. The song has been featured on a number of ABBA compilations such as Gold: Greatest Hits. ==History== The working title of \"Take a Chance on Me\" was \"Billy Boy\". Written and recorded in 1977 by Benny Andersson and Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, it opens as a cold intro and was sung by Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog and Anni- Frid Lyngstad, with F\u00e4ltskog delivering the solo passages. It has a constant uptempo throughout the entire recording. It was one of ABBA's first singles in which their manager Stig Anderson did not lend a hand in writing the lyrics, firmly establishing Andersson and Ulvaeus as a songwriting partnership. The song's origins sprang from Ulvaeus, whose hobby was running. While running, he would sing a \"tck-a-ch\"-style rhythm to himself over and over again, which then evolved into \"take-a-chance\" and the eventual lyrics. The song's B-side was \"I'm a Marionette\", which, like \"Thank You for the Music\" and \"I Wonder (Departure)\" (the B-side to their previous single, \"The Name of the Game\"), was part of a mini-musical entitled The Girl With the Golden Hair during their 1977 concert tour. ==Reception== Billboard Magazine described \"Take a Chance on Me\" as \"one of [ABBA's] most busy, fast paced productions.\" \"Take a Chance on Me\" proved to be one of ABBA's most successful chart hits, becoming the group's seventh UK #1 (and third consecutive chart-topper in the country after \"Knowing Me, Knowing You\" and \"The Name of the Game\").Oldham, A, Calder, T & Irvin, C: \"ABBA: The Name of the Game\", page 122. Sidgwick & Jackson, 1995 It was also ABBA's final #1 in the UK of the 1970s, and gives the group the distinction of being the act with the most chart-topping singles of the 1970s in the UK. It sold over 500,000 copies and was awarded a gold disc. https://www.bpi.co.uk/brit-certified/ In the United States it reached #3 and was certified gold for 1 million sales. https://www.riaa.com/gold- platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar;=Abba&ti;=#search_section .

As part of the EP, the cover topped the UK Singles Chart for 5 weeks in 1992. In the United States, it reached number 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart. Although it had earned enough charting points to reach the publication's main Hot 100 chart, it was not eligible to enter as it had not been released commercially as a single. ===Critical reception=== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"Venerable U.K. pop/dance duo lovingly covers a favorite from now-legendary Swedish pop act Abba's catalog. Track maintains the cool kitsch of the original, while giving it electro-hip instrumentation and a jolting-but-pleasing toast interlude by MC Kinky. A must for adventurous popsters, while remixes have considerable club potential.\" Amy Linden from Entertainment Weekly said that Erasure \"reverently tarts up \"Take a Chance on Me\", as keyboard whiz Vince Clarke pumps the \u201970s gems full of \u201992 club aggression.\" She also stated that the duo \"digs that ABBA were Euro pop gods, and they pay respect with a frothy testimonial that has its tongue in the right place.\" Tom Ewing from Freaky Trigger noted that \"the whole project roars to life exactly once, when MC Kinky takes over for thirty delightful, crass seconds in the middle of \"Take A Chance On Me\" and shows the song a little creative disrespect at last.\" Dave Sholin from Gavin Report asked, \"Abba goes techno?\" He added that this updated version \"retains much of the flavor in the original with hip production elements added.\" ===Music video=== Erasure members Vince Clarke and Andy Bell played dual roles \u2013 as themselves and in drag (Clarke as F\u00e4ltskog and Bell as Lyngstad) \u2013 in a music video heavily influenced by ABBA's original. MC Kinky (aka. Caron Geary), who sings the reggae/dancehall rap part, also appears in an interlude in the video. ==A-Teens version== \"Take a Chance on Me\" was an A-Teens promo single from their debut album The ABBA Generation, a cover of the ABBA song of the same name. Universal Music Spain released the song on Spanish radio, hoping to promote the band in Spain in the early 2000s. The song also became part of the Head Over Heels motion picture soundtrack in 2001. Unlike the original, this version omits the lines \"Gonna do my very best, baby can't you see? Gotta put me to the test, take a chance on me\" from the second refrain and replaces them with the last two lines from the usual refrain. ===Music video=== A music video features the band at an indoor go-kart track, complete with neon lights, and the band is seen racing as they perform the song. ==Other cover versions== * Alvin and the Chipmunks covered the song for their 1982 album Chipmunk Rock. * The song has been covered by the Brighouse and Rastrick Brass BandOldham, A, Calder, T & Irvin, C: \"ABBA: The Name of the Game\", page 209.
