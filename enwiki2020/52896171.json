Its boundaries again remained mostly unchanged when replaced by Whitecourt- Ste. Anne in 1993, although the area around Fox Creek was transferred to Grande Prairie-Smoky. ==Representation history== The district's only MLA was Progressive Conservative Peter Trynchy. He entered the Legislature upon winning the seat in the 1971 election and served eight terms all together, six as MLA for Whitecourt and two in Whitecourt-Ste. Anne, finally retiring in 2001. ==Election results== ===1970s=== ===1980s=== The 1982 election saw the rise of the separatist Western Canada Concept, which failed to win any seats. Their result in Whitecourt was the fourth-best in the province, despite Social Credit candidate George Richardson's status as party leader. Trynchy still won an outright majority of votes, benefitting from a surge in turnout. Representative Party swing in 1986 is calculated from Social Credit results in 1982. ==Also see== *Alberta provincial electoral districts ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Elections Alberta *The Legislative Assembly of Alberta Category:Former Alberta provincial electoral districts ",
