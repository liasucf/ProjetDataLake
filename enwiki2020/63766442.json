    "text": "Sylheti cuisine () represents the food culture of Sylhetis. It comprises tangy sour Hatkora to spicy hot chicken tikka masala, confectionery Tusha Shinni to savoury Nunor Bora and the fermented fish Hutki Shira. Hatkora is a common fruit and used to cook different dishes with fish and meat. Enriched with Vitamin C and antioxidants, Hatkora curry is best eaten with rice. Though Sylhetis are mainly rice and fish eaters, their culinary system is distinctly different to non-Sylhetis. Multicultural people of Barak Valley to Surma valley, and the Sylheti diaspora have influenced the Sylheti food and flavours practiced for ages. Among them, the culinary system of Khasi, Kuki and other tribes are noteworthy. The cuisine of Sylhet has grown up depending on the availability of plants and animals in the region. Mainly indigenous with some variety, food culture is performed among the Sylhetis that received some external influences as well. When the 360 disciples of Shah Jalal arrived in this region, they not only brought their distinct cultures but also brought distinct cooking styles of their own. Which included many meat dishes along with chicken, beef and goat cooked Mughlai, Middle-Eastern, and Northern Indian style. Mughlai Porota, Pilau, Korma, Kalia, Roast, Biriyani and Kofta for curry dishes while Zardah, Firni and Kheer for desserts have been also included. In London, in the 1940s some entrepreneurial Sylhetis began setting up caf\u00e9s and introduced curry and rice to the menu. But lack of confidence saw the Bangladeshis refer to their food as Indian.

Sylhet is not known for its cuisine, though 80% to 90% British curry-house trace their roots directly to Sylhet. Chefs from Sylhet region developed the British curry to a greater extent since the 1960s. Chicken tikka masala, invented by the Sylhetis is regarded as Britain's National dish since 2001, by Britain\u2019s foreign secretary Robin Cook.
