    "text": "Stefanos Evangelou (; born 12 May 1998) is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a centre-back for Polish club G\u00f3rnik Zabrze. ==Club career== Evangelou plays mainly as a centre-back, and joined Panathinaikos from Panionios in the summer of 2015 and at the time he was the captain of the Greece U17 National Team. In summer of 2016, Panathinaikos purchased quite a few players to enhance their defensive line, yet Evangelou was neither sold nor given out on loan. Working his way up through the club, Evangelou earned playing time at Panathinaikos and was considered a valuable member of the team. In January 2017, he made his debut with the club in a Greek Cup game against Kissamikos and since then, has seen more time on the pitch. On 5 October 2020, Evangelou signed with G\u00f3rnik Zabrze for 2 plus 2 years for an undisclosed fee, as his former Olympiacos agreed on co-ownership with the Polish club. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Club ! rowspan=2 | Season ! colspan=3 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Other ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
