It is often abbreviated as \"IQ\".Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit (IQ) It comes from the verb root \"qaujima-\" meaning \"to know\" and could be literally translated as \"that which has long been known by Inuit\". ==Traditional knowledge== Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit is a body of knowledge and unique cultural insights of Inuit into the workings of nature, humans and animals. Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, then, has both practical and epistemological aspects that branch out from a fundamental principle that human beings are learning, rational beings with an infinite potential for problem-solving within the dictates of nature and technology. According to the government of Nunavut in 2013 Incorporating Inuit Societal Values, Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit has the following components: * Inuuqatigiitsiarniq (respecting others, relationships and caring for people) * Tunnganarniq (fostering good spirit by being open, welcoming and inclusive) * Pijitsirniq (serving and providing for family or community, or both) * Aajiiqatigiinniq (decision making through discussion and consensus) * Pilimmaksarniq or Pijariuqsarniq (development of skills through practice, effort and action) * Piliriqatigiinniq or Ikajuqtigiinniq (working together for a common cause) * Qanuqtuurniq (being innovative and resourceful) * Avatittinnik Kamatsiarniq (respect and care for the land, animals and the environment) The Inuit Language Protection Act of 2008 ILPA establishes the rights of parents to receive instruction in Inuktitut; see also Education Framework. Similarly, Inuit intergenerational (from elder to youth) and experiential (learning through participation) knowledge has also been called \"Inuit ecological knowledge\" or \"IEK\"Eyegetok 1998 ===Studies of traditional knowledge=== The Igloolik Research Centre in Igloolik, Nunavut focuses on documenting Inuit Qaujimajatuqangit, as well as climatology and seismic data research. ==Politics== It has recently become something of a political slogan in Nunavut, as the government attempts to integrate the traditional culture of the Inuit more into their modern governance structure in order to combat disempowerment. Its critics , however, tend to view it as little more than window dressing for more conventional politics. ==See also== * Indigenous Ways of Knowing * Traditional ecological knowledge ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Citations=== * Eyegetok, Sandra, and Natasha Thorpe.
