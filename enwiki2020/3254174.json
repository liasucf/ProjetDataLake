    "text": "The NSW Schools Spectacular is an Australian variety show featuring more than 5,500 students from public schools across New South Wales and was performed annually at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (later known as Qantas Credit Union Arena) between 1984 and 2015, after which the venue was permanently closed. In 2016, it moved to Sydney Olympic Park, and found its new home at Qudos Bank Arena. The Schools Spectacular was broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation from 1984 until 2012, then by the Nine Network from 2013 until 2015. The Seven Network has been broadcasting the Schools Spectacular since 2016. Fifteen television cameras are placed in various vantage points throughout the arena. All four performances are recorded, and the best versions of each show segment are edited together and then aired in the television broadcast two weeks after the live event. The actual performance is made up of many different pieces. A typical piece would have a spotlighted soloist singing on an elevated platform in the arena, surrounded by many dancers and actors. On the stage, the orchestra would be playing the instrumental part of the song while the choirs behind and next to the orchestra would be singing the chorus of the song. There are some 400 audio inputs for microphones and musical instruments, and an amazing array of around 600 lights used throughout the show. The first Schools Spectacular was Schools Spectacular 1983 and was intended to be a sound test for the Sydney Entertainment Centre. Since then, the Schools Spectacular has evolved significantly. The 2012 event included 3,600 students and 600 teachers from 400 schools in four performances viewed by 30,000 people. Schools Spectacular 2016 broke the Guinness World Record for \"Largest Amateur Variety Act\", with 5,500 performers. As well as being broadcast each year on national television, the Schools Spectacular is webcast through the Internet onto their website, with the help and sponsorship by Cisco Systems. The Schools Spectacular is produced by 'The Arts Unit' of the New South Wales Department of Education. ==Themes By Year== Each year the Schools Spectacular follows a theme; *1993 - One Spirit *1994 - International *1995 - Hats Off To Australia *1996 - Get Set 2000 *1997 - The Edge *1998 - Reaching the World *1999 - To Be Australian *2000 - The Entertainers *2001 - Celebrate! *2002 - By Invitation *2003 - 20 Years on *2004 - 21st Birthday *2005 - The Face of Australia *2006 - Shine *2007 - My Spec *2008 - The Spectacular Spirit *2009 - Reaching Out *2010 - Colour My World *2011 - Imagine *2012 - Our Time *2013 - 30 Spectacular Years *2014 - This Is Australia *2015 - This is Our World *2016 - Dream Big *2017 - Own The Moment *2018 - The Greatest *2019 - Stars *2020 - (show cancelled) === Schools Spectacular 2020 === On 24 March, 2020, the official Schools Spectacular website announced that the 2020 Schools Spectacular would not go ahead due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic.
