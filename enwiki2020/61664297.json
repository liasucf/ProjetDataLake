    "text": "In algebraic geometry, the theorem of absolute (cohomological) purity is an important theorem in the theory of \u00e9tale cohomology. It states:A version of the theorem is stated at given *a regular scheme X over some base scheme, *i: Z \\to X a closed immersion of a regular scheme of pure codimension r, *an integer n that is invertible on the base scheme, *\\mathcal{F} a locally constant \u00e9tale sheaf with finite stalks and values in \\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}, for each integer m \\ge 0, the map :\\operatorname{H}^m(Z_{\\text{\u00e9t}}; \\mathcal{F}) \\to \\operatorname{H}^{m+2r}_Z(X_{\\text{\u00e9t}}; \\mathcal{F}(r)) is bijective, where the map is induced by cup product with c_r(Z). The theorem was introduced in SGA 5 Expos\u00e9 I, \u00a7 3.1.4. as an open problem. Later, Thomason proved it for large n and Gabber in general. == See also == *purity (algebraic geometry) == References == *Fujiwara, K.: A proof of the absolute purity conjecture (after Gabber).
