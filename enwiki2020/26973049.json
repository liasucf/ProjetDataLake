    "text": "France was represented by Christine Minier, with the song \"Les mots d'amour n'ont pas de dimanche\", at the 1987 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 9 May in Brussels. Broadcaster Antenne 2 chose the song via a broadcast national final, which would prove to be the last French national final until 1999. At the time of her victory Minier was not a professional singer, nor did she subsequently launch a professional career. ==Before Eurovision== === National final === The national final was held on 4 April 1987, hosted by Marie-Ange Nardi and Patrick Simpson. Ten songs took part with the winner chosen by a panel of TV viewers who were telephoned and asked to vote on the songs.ESC National Finals database 1987 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" |+ style=\"font-size: bigger;\" | |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

Attention focussed on Minier's reportedly very expensive, but oddly designed, pink and orange stage outfit, which she later conceded looked garish and unflattering on screen. At the close of voting \"Les mots d'amour n'ont pas de dimanche\" had received 44 points (including a maximum 12 from Luxembourg), placing France 14th of the 22 entries. The French jury awarded its 12 points to the Netherlands.ESC History - France 1987 ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1987 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1987 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1987 in French music ",
