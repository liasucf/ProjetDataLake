    "text": "1407 Lindel\u00f6f, provisional designation , is an asteroid from the central region of the asteroid belt, approximately 20 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 21 November 1936, by Finnish astronomer Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland. The asteroid was named after Finnish topologist Ernst Lindel\u00f6f. == Orbit and classification == Lindel\u00f6f orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0\u20133.5 AU once every 4 years and 7 months (1,680 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.28 and an inclination of 6\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. In 1905, it was first identified as at Heidelberg Observatory, extending the body's observation arc by 31 years prior to its official discovery observation. == Physical characteristics == In the SMASS taxonomy, Lindel\u00f6fs spectral class is that of an X-type asteroid, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) considers it to be of a stony composition. === Rotation period and poles === French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini obtained a rotational lightcurve of Lindel\u00f6f from photometric observations in January 2006. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined and longer-than average rotation period of 31.151 hours with a brightness variation of 0.34 in magnitude (). A 2016-published lightcurve, using modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD), gave a concurring period of 31.0941 hours (), as well as a spin axis of (147.0\u00b0, 36\u00b0) in ecliptic coordinates (\u03bb, \u03b2). === Diameter and albedo === According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Lindel\u00f6f measures between 17.39 and 23.85 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between and 0.179 and 0.28. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.1791 and a diameter of 20.75 kilometers, with an absolute magnitude of 10.9. == Naming == This minor planet was named for Finnish topologist Ernst Leonard Lindel\u00f6f (1870\u20131946), who was a professor of mathematics at Helsinki University. The Lindel\u00f6f spaces are also named after him. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). == References == == External links == * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Google books * Asteroids and comets rotation curves, CdR \u2013 Observatoire de Gen\u00e8ve, Raoul Behrend * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (1)-(5000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 001407 Category:Discoveries by Yrj\u00f6 V\u00e4is\u00e4l\u00e4 Category:Minor planets named for people Category:Named minor planets 001407 19361121 ",
