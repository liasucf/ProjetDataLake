    "text": "Charles \"Chuck\" Taylor Jr. (born 1943) is an American author of books of poetry, essay, short story, and novels who was born in Minneapolis but has lived most of his life in Texas. He teaches creative writing at Texas A&M; and operates small press Slough Press, publishing since 1973. His contribution to building the literature scene on the Third Coast in Austin, Texas, includes activities as both a writer and publisher. He published leading poets, fiction and non-fiction writers whose books received numerous awards and were later published by larger presses. His own titles, such as the poetry collection What do You Want, Blood? received the 1988 Austin Book Award and regional critical acclaim. He is one of the legendary figures of the Austin\u2013San Antonio\u2013Dallas triangle culture that nurtured the eccentric, free-spirited independence of Texan bohemia and cross-cultural innovative creativity, especially in the literary arts. Taylor's novel, Drifter's Story, and his poetry book, Ordinary Life, explore the lives of the working poor. He has taught in the NEA Poets-in-the-Schools Program and was CETA Poet-in-Residence for the City of Salt Lake. Along with Pat Littledog, Taylor co-operated Paperbacks Plus Books in Austin, Texas, from 1980 to 1988. The store became an important literary center for the Southwest sponsoring literary readings and plays as well as serving as a home for Slough Press. Business owners John and Marquetta Tilton of Dallas opened several store locations run by famous Texas poets and writers who had not yet achieved widespread notoriety: poet Dr. Ricardo Sanchez in San Antonio and Dr. Hedwig Gorski's infamous Voltaire's Basement bookstore in downtown Austin. All branches of Paperbacks Plus allowed serious poets to live with their families on the store premises while providing a small income managing or selling at the location. Each became a hub of literary and performance activities across generations and styles nurturing the offbeat talents and lifestyles Central Texas is known for. These activities, venues, and people set the stage during the late 1970s and 80s for Austin Poetry Slam scenes. ==Communalism== Among the many themes Taylor uses expressing a hippie principle of communalism in both poetry and prose is the conflict between the ideal and the actual. His influences include Henry David Thoreau and hedonism. His search for spirituality includes reading Barth and Tillich and practicing chanting and meditation, plus explorations with a channeling group and a Wiccan group. ==Professor== Taylor has been the Coordinator of Creative Writing in the English Department of Texas A&M; University at College Station and taught literature and creative writing there for 21 years.
