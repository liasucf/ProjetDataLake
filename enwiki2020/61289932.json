    "text": "The Wexford Intermediate Hurling Championship (known for sponsorship reasons as The Courtyard Ferns Intermediate Hurling Championship) is an annual hurling competition organised by the Wexford County Board of the Gaelic Athletic Association since 1930 for the second tier hurling teams in the county of Wexford in Ireland. The series of games are played during the summer and autumn months with the county final currently being played at Innovate Wexford Park in October. The championship features a group stage before the top- ranking teams complete a knock-out series of games. The Wexford Intermediate Championship is an integral part of the wider Leinster Intermediate Club Hurling Championship. The winners of the Wexford county final join the champions of the other hurling counties to contest the provincial championship. Twelve clubs currently participate in the Wexford Intermediate Championship. The title has been won at least once by 38 different clubs. The all-time record-holders are Ferns St. Aidan's, who have won the competition six times. Cloughbawn are the title-holders after defeating HWH Bunclody by 3-17 to 0-14 in the 2019 championship decider replay. ==History== The Wexford Intermediate Hurling Championship dates back to 1930. It was the third championship to be established in Wexford following the Wexford Senior Hurling Championship in 1889 and the Wexford Junior Hurling Championship in 1903. The championship was split in two in 2012 with the creation of the new third tier Wexford Intermediate A Hurling Championship. == Participating teams== \u2022Buffers Alley \u2022HWH Bunclody \u2022Askamore \u2022Ballygarrett \u2022Blackwater \u2022Monageer-Boolavogue \u2022Oylegate Glenbrien \u2022Gusserane O\u2019Rahillys \u2022St James \u2022Adamstown \u2022Rathgarogue Cushinstown \u2022Taghmon Camross ==Roll of honour== {|class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:purple; color:yellow; border:1px solid black;\" |# ! style=\"background:purple; color:yellow; border:1px solid black;\" | Team ! style=\"background:purple; color:yellow; border:1px solid black;\" | Wins ! style=\"background:purple; color:yellow; border:1px solid black;\" | Winning Years |- | 1 | Ferns St. Aidan's | 6 | 1958, 1979, 1984, 1989, 1998, 2007 |- | 2 | HWH Bunclody | 5 | 1982, 1993, 1995, 2002, 2010 |- | rowspan=2|3 | Oylegate-Glenbrien | 4 | 1959, 1992, 2012, 2016 |- | Naomh \u00c9anna | 4 | 1974, 1990, 2001, 2015 |- | rowspan=2|4 | Shamrocks | 3 | 1960, 1996, 2014 |- | Monageer-Boolavogue | 3 | 1980, 1986, 2000 |- | rowspan=13|5 | Glynn | 2 | 1931, 1934 |- | Geraldine O'Hanrahan's | 2 | 1957, 1975 |- | St. Martin's | 2 | 1964, 1977 |- | Buffers Alley | 2 | 1965, 2013 |- | Ballyhogue | 2 | 1966, 1972 |- | Oulart-the Ballagh | 2 | 1968, 1985 |- | Duffry Rovers | 2 | 1969, 1978 |- | Adamstown | 2 | 1971, 2011 |- | Marshalstown | 2 | 1983, 2005 |- | Rathgarogue-Cushinstown | 2 | 1991, 2006 |- | Askamore | 2 | 1976, 2009 |- | Fethard St. Mogue's | 2 | 1994, 2018 |- | St. Anne's Rathangan | 2 | 1999, 2017 |- | rowspan=19|6 | Ballymurrin | 1 | 1930 |- | Cathal Brughas | 1 | 1932 |- | O'Hanrahan's | 1 | 1933 |- | Sally Beachers | 1 | 1935 |- | Ferns- Ballingale | 1 | 1936 |- | Faythe Harriers | 1 | 1956 |- | Horeswood | 1 | 1961 |- | Hollow Rangers | 1 | 1962 |- | Davidstown-Courtnacuddy | 1 | 1963 |- | Liam Mellows | 1 | 1967 |- | Craanford St. Brendan's | 1 | 1970 |- | Cloughbawn | 1 | 1973 |- | Rathnure | 1 | 1981 |- | Glynn-Barntown | 1 | 1987 |- | Crossabeg-Ballymurn | 1 | 1988 |- | Shelmaliers | 1 | 1997 |- | Ballyfad | 1 | 2003 |- | St. Patrick's | 1 | 2004 |- | Blackwater | 1 | 2008 |} ==List of recent finals== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+ !scope=\"col\"|Year !scope=\"col\"|Winners !scope=\"col\"|Score !scope=\"col\"|Runners-up !scope=\"col\"|Score !scope=\"col\"|Venue !scope=\"col\"| |- | 2013 | Buffers Alley | | Naomh \u00c9anna | | | |- | 2014 | Shamrocks | 3-13 (2-10) | Duffry Rovers | 1-16 (0-16) | Innovate Wexford Park, Wexford | |- | 2015 | Naomh \u00c9anna | 1-15 | Crossabeg-Ballymurn | 2-11 | Bellefield | |- | 2016 | Oylegate-Glenbrien | 1-14 | Adamstown | 0-10 | Innovate Wexford Park, Wexford | |- | 2017 | St. Anne's Rathangan | 2-10 | Crossabeg-Ballymurn | 1-12 | Innovate Wexford Park, Wexford | |- | 2018 | Fethard St. Mogue's | 0-14 (3-16) | Cloughbawn | 1-09 (2-19) | Innovate Wexford Park, Wexford | |- | 2019 | Cloughbawn | 3-14 | HWH Bunclody | 0-17 | Innovate Wexford Park, Wexford | |} ==Records and statistics== ===Teams=== ====Gaps==== Top ten longest gaps between successive championship titles: * 48 years: Buffers Alley (1965-2013) * 40 years: Adamstown (1971-2011) * 36 years: Shamrocks (1960-1996) * 33 years: Oylegate-Glenbrien (1959-1992) * 33 years: Askamore (1976-2009) * 24 years: Fethard St. Mogue's (1994-2018) * 22 years: Marshalstown (1983-2005) * 21 years: Ferns St. Aidan's (1958-1979) * 20 years: Oylegate-Glenbrien (1992-2012) * 18 years: Geraldine O'Hanrahan's (1957-1975) * 18 years: St. Anne's Rathangan (1999-2017) ==References== ==External link== *Wexford Intermediate Hurling Championship roll of honour 1 Category:Intermediate hurling county championships ",
