    "text": "Dezmine Wells (born April 15, 1992) is an American professional basketball player for Jiangsu Dragons of the Chinese Basketball Association. He played college basketball for the Xavier Musketeers and Maryland Terrapins. ==High school career== Wells played high school basketball at Word of God Academy in Raleigh, North Carolina where he was a friend of and teammate with current Washington Wizards guard John Wall. ==College career== Wells began his college career at Xavier, where he was an Atlantic 10 All-Rookie Team selection. He was expelled in 2012 due to a \"serious violation\" of the code of student conduct after a female student alleged he committed sexual assault. Wells also was suspended by the NCAA for being involved in a huge fight after a game against the Cincinnati Bearcats in December 2011. A grand jury did not indict him for the assault, and Wells later sued the university for false accusation. The school was asked to hold off deciding their case until after the criminal case was settled and the prosecutor slammed the school for their unfair procedures. The issue was settled out of court after a judge ruled the lawsuit could go forward to discovery. The NCAA waived the usual redshirt year requirement for Wells, making him eligible immediately at another university. He transferred to Maryland and led the team in scoring with 13.1 points per game as a sophomore. The team missed the NCAA Tournament despite defeating Duke twice. As a junior, Wells averaged 14.9 points per game for the Terrapins. Maryland again missed the NCAA Tournament. A wrist injury caused Wells to miss a month of games as a senior. Nevertheless, he scored 26 points and added seven rebounds and four assists in Maryland's 59-53 win over fifth- ranked Wisconsin. He was a First Team All-Big Ten selection. Maryland coach Mark Turgeon said Wells \"was not going to let us lose.\" Wells's last collegiate game was against West Virginia in Columbus, Ohio in the Round of 32 of the 2015 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament. He tallied nine points and eight turnovers in a 69-59 loss. ==Professional career== ===Oklahoma City Blue (2015\u20132016)=== ESPN's Chad Ford considered Wells a potential second-round pick in the 2015 NBA draft, but he went undrafted.
