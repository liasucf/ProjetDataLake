He played Gaelic football with his local club Millstreet and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1971 until 1975. ==Playing career== ===Club=== Kelleher played his club football with his local club in Millstreet. ===Inter-county=== By the late 1960s Kelleher had joined the Cork senior team, however, the team was forced to play second fiddle to Kerry. In 1971 Cork were back. A 0\u201325 to 0\u201314 trouncing of back-to-back All-Ireland champions Kerry gave Kelleher a Munster winners' medal. Cork, however, were later defeated by eventual champions Offaly in the All-Ireland semi-final. Two years later Kelleher secured his second Munster winners' medal. The 5\u201312 to 1\u201315 defeat of Kerry showed the traditional football powers that Cork were coming. The subsequent All-Ireland final pitted Cork against Galway. Jimmy Barry-Murphy scored the first of his two goals after two minutes before scored a third for Cork after switching to left wing-forward. At full-time Cork were the champions by 3\u201317 to 2\u201313. This victory gave Kelleher an All-Ireland winners' medal. Cork continued their provincial dominance in 1974. A 1\u201311 to 0\u20137 defeat of Kerry gave Kelleher a third Munster winners' medal. This victory resulted in Cork being installed as the favourites to retain their All-Ireland title. Kelleher's side were defeated by eventual champions Dublin in the All-Ireland semi-final. ===Inter-provincial=== Kelleher also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial football competition. He first played with his province in 1974. In 1975 Kelleher was a member of the team again and he captured a Railway Cup winners' medal following a victory over Ulster. Kelleher was a non-playing substitute when Munster retained the title in 1976. ==Death== Humphrey Kelleher died on September 21, 2005, after a short illness. ==References== Category:1946 births Category:2005 deaths Category:Millstreet Gaelic footballers Category:Cork inter-county Gaelic footballers Category:Munster inter-provincial Gaelic footballers ",
