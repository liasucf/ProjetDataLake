He was ordained by Cardinal Cerejeira on 29 June 1948, after which he took the position as teacher in the seminary of Santar\u00e9m and as priest in several parishes of Lisbon. He then became National Director of the Apostleship of the Sea in 1960. From 1979 onward he worked as a monitor-operator for Lisnave shipyards since, and participated on numerous missions abroad. He was elected bishop of Funchal on March 18, 1974, and episcopal ordination on the 21st of the same month. However, he was forced to delay his arrival to Madeira due to the Revolution. He would make his solemn entry into the see of Funchal on May 12, 1974. In that and that summer his was kidnapped at Funchal's seminary premises. On February 1981 he was hospitalized, due to cancer, in Funchal and would later undergo surgery in London. He would later died in the episcopal palace of Funchal on March 5, 1982. == Political legacy == It is attributed to Francisco II the launch of Alberto Jo\u00e3o Jardim's political career, who would become President of the Regional Government of Madeira for 37 years, the longest time in office for an elected Portuguese politician. Such was due to the fact that Francisco II choose Jo\u00e3o Jardim, on October 24, 1974, to be the director of the Diocese's newspaper, who then became a mouthpiece to the Church's anti-communist and anti-socialist sentiment in revolution's aftermath, therefore influencing the political set-up of Madeira in the early years of Autonomy. During his time in office he frequently attack Communism and Socialism during his masses by stating that: \"marxist socialism, where the agents of international communism cleverly hide, intends to assault our archipelago of Madeira to colonize it\" and by calling Communism an utopia. == References == Category:Portuguese Roman Catholic bishops Category:1924 births Category:1982 deaths Category:20th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Deaths from cancer in Portugal ",
