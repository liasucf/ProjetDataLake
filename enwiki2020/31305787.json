    "text": "The Red Queen Kills Seven Times () is a 1972 giallo film directed by Emilio Miraglia. ==Plot== Two sisters, Kitty and Evelyn, are cursed by a family painting depicting a hundred year-cycle in which a Red Queen is raised from the dead to kill seven times. Hoping to end the cycle, their grandfather, Tobias, orders the painting removed from their sight. Years later Kitty accidentally kills Evelyn during a fight. The death is covered up by their older sister, Franziska, and everyone, including Tobias, is told that Evelyn immigrated to the United States. This doesn't sit well with Kitty, who is willing to allow Franziska to cover up the murder but feels overwhelming guilt. When their grandfather dies from a fear induced heart attack, a series of murders begin to occur around Kitty, all of which appear to have been caused by a red cloaked Evelyn. The police begin to suspect that Kitty and her married lover Martin are the perpetrators of the murders, especially after Martin's institutionalized wife is found dead. It's eventually revealed that Kitty had only stunned Evelyn, who was also not her biological sister - Tobias had adopted her as an additional way of ending the hundred year-cycle. Evelyn's true murderer was Franziska, who murdered her at the start of an impulsive plan to be the only person to inherit Tobias' vast fortune. Resentful that she was not the main beneficiary despite providing his daily care, Franziska recruited some of Kitty's co-workers, who were unhappy of Kitty's station and preferential treatment by Martin. After murdering her female accomplices Franziska tricks Kitty into entering the basement of Tobias' mansion, where she tries to slowly drown her via flooding. Realizing the truth, Martin confronts Franziska and gets a confession, only for the woman to be shot by her own husband, Herbert, who had thus far been complicit with her actions. Herbert then leads the police to Kitty's location, saving her from death, but drowning himself in the process. Kitty and Martin are taken to the hospital. ==Cast== *Barbara Bouchet as Kitty Wildenbr\u00fcck *Ugo Pagliai as Martin Hoffmann *Marina Malfatti as Franziska Wildenbr\u00fcck *Marino Mas\u00e9 as Inspector *Pia Giancaro as Rosemary M\u00fcller (as Maria Pia Giancaro) *Sybil Danning as Lul\u00f9 Palm *Nino Korda as Herbert Zieler *Rudolf Sch\u00fcndler as Tobias Wildenbr\u00fcck (as Rudolf Schindler) *Fabrizio Moresco as Peter *Carla Mancini as Elizabeth Hoffmann *Bruno Bertocci as Hans Meyer ==Production== The Red Queen Kills Seven Times was the final film of director Emilio Miraglia and his second giallo film in a row.
