Meanwhile, Parvathi promises to make her childhood friend's (Prabhavathi) daughter Lakshmi (Savitri) as her third daughter-in-law, but Raghu refuses it because he is already in love with a girl Janaki (Sarada). To Keep up Parvathi's word, Ranga marries Lakshmi. Everything moves happily, Geetha also gets a rich alliance with Madhu (Haranath), son of Rajarao (A. V. Subbarao Jr.). But suddenly, life takes a U-turn, where Chandrasekharam is bankrupted, Geetha\u2019s marriage is called off. There onwards, his family members' attitudes completely change and they start seeing Rao Bahadur in a low profile. Ranga could not tolerate it and reacts to them, so, they put the blame of theft on him. Seeing this, Chandrasekharam asks Ranga & Lakshmi to leave the house. Ranga gets acquaintance with a person Kotaiah (Relangi) and finds a job in a factory owned by Rajarao. Afterward, broken-hearted Chandrasekharam dies leaving his wife and youngest daughter to be in their children's merciless care.
