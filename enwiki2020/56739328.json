B301) is a German federal highway in Bavaria, which leads in two parts from Abensberg to Fischerh\u00e4user, a district of Ismaning. ==Route description== ===Northern section=== The northern section begins at Abensberg and runs through the Hallertau via Mainburg to Freising. From Abensberg to Attenkirchen it is also called Deutsche Hopfenstra\u00dfe (). Because of the increasing traffic, among other things due to the connection of the Munich Airport, a five kilometers long bypass around Au in der Hallertau was built and released for traffic in December 2011. With the rededication of the B11 between Munich and Moosburg to the State Road 2350, the part of the B11 between the previous end of the B301 and Marzling, and the feeder road (previously B11a) was rededicated to B301, so that the route ends at the exit Freising-Ost since then. ===Southern section=== The section south of Freising exists since 2013 and is also referred as Isarparallele. The main road begins at the junction Freising-Mitte on the A92 and ends in Fischerh\u00e4user on the B388. It complements the road links of the airport and was the upgraded former county road FS44 (A 92-Hallbergmoos) and a new line which was built between 31 August 2009 and the traffic release on 30 July 2013 at a cost of around 29 million euros. The newly built route between Fischerh\u00e4user and Goldach runs directly next to the tracks of the Munich East\u2013Munich Airport railway. In the area of the junction to the airport shuttle from the A92, the main road next to this railway line also crosses the Neufahrner Spange which leads to the Munich\u2013Regensburg railway.M\u00fcnchner Merkur: Neue B 301: Freie Fahrt zum Flughafen!. 31.
