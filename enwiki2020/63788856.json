Tr\u00e9migon started sailing with the French East India Company in 1751 and made five journey to the Indian Ocean. He served as a Lieutenant on Bien-Aim\u00e9 (1757) in d'Ach\u00e9's squadron, and later on Zodiaque, taking part in two battles in 1759, where he was gravely wounded. D'Ach\u00e9 gave Tr\u00e9migon command of P\u00e9n\u00e9lope for missions in the Indian Ocean. In July 1761, he was promoted to capitaine de br\u00fblot and made two cruises in the Caribbean (1761-1763) on Prot\u00e9e and Zodiaque. In 1763, he was wounded in the fire at the stores in Brest. Promoted to Lieutenant de vaisseau (in May 1763), he took part in the bombardment of Larache and Sal\u00e9 on Licorne in 1765. In 1767, he captained the corvette Vigilant in the Indian Ocean and was tasked with importing spice plants from Moluques in 1769. He was promoted to Frigate captain in 1770 and introduced to the King. In February 1772, Tr\u00e9migon was promoted to Captain, and given command of the 64-gun Alexandre, in the squadron under Orvilliers. In the night of 23 to 24, Alexandre got separated from the fleet, and thus failed to take part in the Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778. Tr\u00e9migon was admonished after the subsequent inquiry. The year after, he took part in the Armada of 1779. In 1780, he was appointed to the brand-new 110-gun Invincible. In March 1781, he transferred to Annibal, part of a division under Suffren, bound for the Indian Ocean. He was killed en route during the Battle of Porto Praya on 16 April 1781. == Sources and references == Notes References Bibliography * * * * Category:French Navy officers ",
