Situated in Tenaya Canyon directly between North Dome and Half Dome, it is the last remnant of a large glacial lake that once filled most of Yosemite Valley at the end of the last Ice Age, and is close to disappearing due to sediment accumulation. ==See also== *List of lakes in California ==External links== * * Category:Lakes of Yosemite National Park Category:Lakes of Mariposa County, California Category:Merced River Category:Tourist attractions in Mariposa County, California ",
