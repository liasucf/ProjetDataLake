Although the Yankees survived only a short time, they beat Celtic in a prestige friendly and effectively won the 1931 National Challenge Cup. However, due to complications over the merger their moment of glory was credited to the Fall River Marksmen. ==History== Fall River Marksmen were originally one of the most successful early United States soccer clubs. However by 1931 they were suffering financially and Sam Mark, owner of the franchise, moved the club to New York, hoping that a new market there would be more lucrative. Once there he merged the club with New York Soccer Club and renamed them the Yankees. New York Soccer Club had previously played as New York Giants. Before the merger was finalized however, Fall River Marksmen had entered the 1931 National Challenge Cup. After the merger, the new club was unable to re-register for the competition, so they continued to play in the Challenge Cup as the Fall River Marksmen. With a team featuring Billy Gonsalves and Bert Patenaude they eventually beat Chicago Bricklayers in a final played as a three game series.

On May 30 at Fenway Park, Gonsalves scored a hat-trick as the Yankees won 4-3. However on June 28 at Yankee Stadium, Celtic avenged the defeat and won 4-1.
