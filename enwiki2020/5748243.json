He was briefly acting Chief Minister for the state following C. N. Annadurai's death in 1969, taking the role until M. Karunanidhi was appointed. He then continued as a cabinet minister in the Karunanidhi cabinet until the DMK lost power in 1976. Together with Sathyavani Muthu, Nedunchezhiyan left the DMK to form a new political party called the Makkal Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam but this did not last long. The party merged with the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), which was by then in government, in 1978 and from 1980 Nedunchezhiyan was again a cabinet minister, this time under the leadership of AIADMK's M. G. Ramachandran. He held the position of Finance Minister from 1980 to 1987 and once again became acting Chief Minister in the latter year when Ramachandran died. He was a candidate in the subsequent leadership election but lost to Ramachandran's wife, Janaki Ramachandran. Nedunchezhiyan briefly aligned himself with the J. Jayalalithaa-led group within the AIADMK but was expelled from the party in 1988 after disputes with its leaders.
