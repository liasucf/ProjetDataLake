    "text": "Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n was a farm in the Halach\u00f3 Municipality in the state of Yucat\u00e1n, Mexico. It is one of the properties that arose during the nineteenth century henequen boom. There are numerous other properties of this name in the Yucat\u00e1n including Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n in Baca, Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Hom\u00fan), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Motul), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Sey\u00e9), Hacienda Kankabch\u00e9n (Tixkokob), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n (Tunk\u00e1s), Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n Uc\u00ed and Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n de Valencia. ==Toponymy== The name (Kancabch\u00e9n) is a word from the Mayan language meaning the well of the red ground. ==How to get there== Go 67.5 km southwest from the southern Perif\u00e9rico of M\u00e9rida on highway 180 to the town of Halach\u00f3. Enter the town on Calle 20 and at the intersection of Calle 20 and Calle 19 and turn right, heading west to Calle 26. Take Calle 26 northwest for approximately 8 km to Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n. ==History== In 1970 the name changed from Kancabch\u00e9n to Kankabch\u00e9n. In 1990, it changed back to the prior spelling. ==Demographics== All of the henequen plantations ceased to exist as autonomous communities with the agrarian land reform implemented by President Lazaro Cardenas in 1937. His decree turned the haciendas into collective ejidos, leaving only 150 hectares to the former landowners for use as private property. Figures before 1937 indicate populations living on the farm. After 1937, figures indicate those living in the community, as the remaining Hacienda Kancabch\u00e9n houses only the owner's immediate family. According to the 2005 census conducted by the INEGI, the population of the city was 421 inhabitants, of whom 217 were men and 204 were women. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:right;\" |+ Population of Kancabch\u00e9n by year |- !
