Both his father and grandfather were given opportunities to take their music far, but they gave up their success to be with their families. When he was seven, his father gave him a set of drums, which he played in his church's band, and also began rapping.

In an interview with Pitchfork he stated, \"I grew up in the church, so it was a bunch of gospel along with Musiq Soulchild, Em, T-Pain\u2014just a bunch of soulful dudes that are country. My first favorite rapper was Ludacris.\" ===Musical style=== Scott Glaysher of Exclaim! described his music is a \"mix of smart rapping and crowd- pleasing, futuristic R&B; grooves.\" Jay Balfour from Pitchfork said he focuses \"on his incredibly versatile voice within a warm palette of sludgy R&B; and neo-funk\" and \"throws a million different voices into the mix.\" Rolling Stone said \"his rap makes room for southern R&B; and imperfect harmony singing; the drums are inevitably cooled out, like nth-wave neo soul.\" ==Other ventures== ===Zero Fatigue=== Smino is a founder and part of a musical collective and record label called Zero Fatigue with Monte Booker, Jay2, Bari, Ravyn Lenae, Elton \"L10MixedIt\" Chueng, Chris \"Classick\" Innumerable, and Nosidam.
