The magazine has its headquarters in Amsterdam. After a bankruptcy in 2013, the magazine was taken over by the companies behind the other gay media Winq, Gay.nl and OUTTV. The Gay Krant then first appeared as a combined edition with homoglossy Winq under the name Winq | Gaykrant, but eventually the indication Gaykrant disappeared and nowadays the magazine is simply called Winq. Since August 2017, Gaykrant has been re-launched (online only) and is part of the Gaykrant Foundation.
