    "text": "The Battle of Mount Harriet was an engagement of the Falklands War, which took place on the night of 11/12 June 1982 between British and Argentine forces. One of three battles in a Brigade-size operation all on the same night, the other two being the Battle of Mount Longdon and the Battle of Two Sisters. One of a number of night battles that took place during the British advance towards Stanley, the battle led to British troops capturing all the heights above the town, allowing its capture and the surrender of the Argentine forces on the islands. ==Background== The British force consisted of 42 Commando (42 CDO), Royal Marines under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Nick Vaux's Royal Marines (he later became a general) with artillery support from a battery of 29 Commando Regiment, Royal Artillery. Engineer support from 2Tp, 59 Independent Commando Squadron (59 Ind CDO Sqn), Royal Engineers. The 1st Battalion, Welsh Guards (1WG) and two companies from 40 Commando (40 CDO) were in reserve. HMS Yarmouth provided naval gunfire support. The Argentine defenders consisted of ex-Army Green Beret Captain Carlos Alberto Arroyo's B Company from Lieutenant Colonel Diego Alejandro Soria's 4th Monte Caseros Infantry Regiment (RI 4). On 1 June, the Argentine defenders on Harriet and Two Sisters, after having abandoned their field kitchens in their original positions on Mount Challenger, were given permission by their officers to consume their cold-weather ration packs, which helped raise the morale of the conscripts.\"From 1 June, 4th Infantry Regiment, on Two Sisters and Mount Harriet, was given permission by their commanding officer, Lieutenant-Colonel Diego Soria, to use their US \"C\" ration packs, which helped to raise morale and keep the soldiers fit.\" 9 Battles To Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, p. 155, Pen & Sword, 2014 On the night of 30 May, K Company of 42 CDO boarded three Sea King helicopters and moved forward of San Carlos to secure the commanding heights of Mount Kent at ,Mount Kent - Falkland Islands at Peakery.com one of the tallest of the peaks surrounding Stanley where Major Cedric Delves' D Squadron from the Special Air Service (SAS) had established a strong presence. When the Royal Marines reinforcements and 7 'Sphinx' Battery of the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery aboard a Chinook helicopter, arrived at the landing zone, 3 kilometres (2 miles) behind the ridge of the mountain, they were met by gun-flashes, mortar detonations and tracer rounds as a second clash involving D Squadron was taking place. Captain Gavin Hamilton's Mountain Troop that had spotted enemy movement in the form of Captain Tom\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez' 2nd Assault Section, 602 Commando Company trying to exit the area after having taking cover among the boulders and caves on Bluff Cove Peak the day before. By the end of May, D Squadron had secured Mount Kent at the cost of two wounded in Air Troop from small-arms fire and Boat Troop with Tactical HQ started patrolling Bluff Cove Peak, which they took with the loss of another two SAS wounded hit by hand grenades fragments,Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p. 148, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 including a Spanish- speaking Warrant officer attached from 23 Special Air Service Regiment (Reserve) who had joined Delves to interrogate any captured Argentines. At the same time, Captain Matthew Selfridge's D Company scouting ahead of 3 PARA took Teal Inlet Settlement, at the cost of one wounded through an accidental discharge. The SAS soldiers came under mortar bombardment while evacuating their wounded and the Royal Marines from 7 'Sphinx' Battery of the 29th Commando Regiment Royal Artillery reported the loss of one gunner (Van Rooyen), who suffered a broken arm while taking cover among the rocks during the bombardment.The National Archives The rest of 42 Commando made a march across the hills north of Mount Simon to reinforce Mounts Kent and Challenger overlooking Port Stanley. The weather conditions were atrocious, with the Marines advancing through steep slippery hillocks and stone-runs to their objectives. Lou Armour was a corporal in J Company under Major Mike Norman: > Because of the weather and lack of equipment, we just had to carry all our > heavy equipment back to Mount Kent, instead of being flown there. That was > psychologically the toughest thing I'd ever done.

Some night-fighting patrols were part of a deception to convince the Argentines that the attack would come from a westerly direction. Other, more covert patrols were to find a route through a minefield around the south of Mount Harriet. Sniping and naval artillery were used to harass the defenders and deny them sleep. On 3 June, Lieutenant Chris Marwood's Reconnaissance Troop of 42 CDO on Mount Wall, accompanying the 3 Commando Brigade Forward Air Control team commanded by Flight Lieutenant Dennis Marshall-Hasdell, encountered two rifle sections from the 4th Monte Caseros Regiment (Second Lieutenant Lautaro Jim\u00e9nez Corbal\u00e1n's 3rd Platoon of B Company from Mount Harriet).5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982. Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea. p. 166. Leo Cooper, 2003The night before, the section under Corporal Elvio Alberto Balcaza had detected the presence of British troops on Wall, and the section under Corporal Nicolas V\u00edctor Odorcic moved forward to assist under the cover of the early morning mist.Volveremos!, Jorge R. Farinella, p. 110, Editorial Rosario, 1984However, at around 11.00 hours (local time) the Recce Troop opened fire and two conscripts (Privates Celso Paez and Roberto Ledesma) were instantly killed, and their NCO (Odorcic) went down, concussed when shot in the helmet by one of the Marine snipers.Volveremos!, Jorge R. Farinella, p. 110, Editorial Rosario, 1984 This action drew attention to their exposed forward position, and Argentine reinforcements in the form of a rifle section under Corporal Walter Ariel Pintos from Second Lieutenant Marcelo Llamb\u00edas Pravaz's 3rd Platoon on Two Sisters joined the action with a counterattack firing rifle-grenades.5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982.

The patrol was spread over quite a large area, with lots of shouting, noise and firing going on. The Marines abandoned all their equipment, and although no one told us, it became clear that we were to withdraw. With no information and the likelihood of having to fight our way out, Dave Greedus and I decided to abandon our equipment, destroying as much as we could. The two radio sets (HF and UHF) were tough enough, but the HAZE unit of the laser target marker was designed to withstand the weight of a tank!The Scars of War, Hugh McManners, p. 238, HarperCollins, 21/01/1993 The Ferranti laser-target-designator retrieved in the contact showed that the Royal Marines were seeking to destroy the Argentine bunkers on Mount Harriet with 1,000-pound GBU-16 Paveway II dropped by RAF Harriers. The next day, Lieutenant Tony Hornby's 10 (Defence) Troop re-occupied the Mount Wall observation post against no opposition.5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982. Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea. p. 167. Leo Cooper, 2003However, on the night of 5-6 June, Captain Andr\u00e9s Ferrero's 3rd Assault Section attacked Lieutenant Hornby's men on Mount Wall and the Royal Marines were forced to withdraw.That time two countries' Special Forces squared off in combatCompa\u00f1\u00edas de Comandos del Ej\u00e9rcito Argentino en acci\u00f3n That same night (5-6 June), a British Gazelle helicopter, (no.

On the night of 8\u20139 June, action on the outer defence zone flared when Lieutenant Mark Townsend's 1 Troop (K Company, 42 CDO) probed Mount Harriet, killing two Argentines (Corporal Hipolito Gonzalez and Private Martiniano Gomez) from Second Lieutenant Jim\u00e9nez Corbal\u00e1n's 3rd Platoon.5th Infantry Brigade in the Falklands 1982. Nicholas Van der Bijl, David Aldea. p. 174. Leo Cooper, 2003 At the same time, two platoon-sized fighting patrols from 45 Commando attempted the same on Two Sisters Mountain, but the Argentine RASIT ground surveillance radar on Mount Longdon was able to detect the 45 Commando platoons, and artillery fire dispersed the British force. In all, Second Lieutenant Lautaro Jim\u00e9nez Corbal\u00e1n would report the loss of 6 killed and 14 wounded fighting off Lieutenant Marwood's Recce Troop on Mount Wall and the raid of Lieutenant Towsend's 1 Troop, including losses suffered during the final British assault on Mount Harriet on the night of 11-12 June. Around dusk on 9 June, Lieutenant-Colonel Soria's men detected the presence of British troops who had taken up positions in Port Harriet House on the southern approaches to Mount Harriet. The 4th Regiment's Reconnaissance Platoon, under Sub-Lieutenant Jorge Pasolli, received orders to move forward and clear the British from the House and the Scots Guards Reconnaissance Platoon that had moved into the area was forced to withdraw when the Argentines radioed fire support from the 120-mm Mortar Platoon dug in on Mount Harriet. Sub-Lieutenant Pasolli's men attacked and the Scots Guards returned fire with two Bren machine guns but were forced to abandon their rucksacks and radios. \"We dashed out and began running chased by mortar rounds. Luckily the soft ground reduced their effect but all the same, we felt very vulnerable. Our bergens were slowing us down and so we ditched them. Then we saw thirty to forty Argentinians coming down off Mount Harriet. They were obviously doing a follow-up, although they were out of effective range, we harassed them with our two light machine guns.\" Among Friends: The Scots Guards 1956-1993, Murray Naylor, p. 146, Pen and Sword, 1995\"He decided to fly back the OC of the Recce Platoon from Port Harriet House. Shortly after the OC left the house the Argentinians attacked it. Several of the Recce Platoon were wounded. They had to make a run for it and left their radios and codes.\" The Vital Link: The Story of Royal Signals 1945-1985, Philip Warner, p. 195, Pen and Sword, 1989 As the Guardsmen retreated, under small arms and mortar fire, they sustained three wounded, including Sergeant Ian Allum. Over a period of a week, the 4th Regiment defended the Harriet-Two Sisters sector from five Royal Marine platoon-sized attacks. Every time the Royal Marine Commandos got into the forward platoon positions, the officers, NCOs and conscripts, counterattacked forcing the British to withdraw. On 8 June, the British troopships Sir Galahad and Sir Tristram were attacked by Argentine aircraft at Bluff Cove. Lieutenant-Colonel Diego Alejandro Soria sought permission to attack the British beachhead with the 4th Regiment, but his request was denied.Only Lieutenant Colonel Diego Soria, who commanded 4th Infantry Regiment on Mount Harriet, sought permission to attack but it had been rejected. Nine Battles To Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, Pen & Sword Books, 2004 On the morning of 11 June, the orders for the attack were given to 42 CDO by Lieutenant Colonel Vaux. K Company was ordered to attack the eastern end of the mountain, while L Company would attack the southern side an hour later, where if the mountain was secured, would move North to occupy Goat Ridge. J Company would launch a diversionary attack (code-named Vesuvius) on the western end of Mount Harriet. If these objectives fell quickly, 42 CDO would proceed to capture Mount William.\" The fighting had lasted longer than anticipated, leaving no time with which to proceed to their next objective: Mt William.\" The Falklands 1982: Ground operations in the South Atlantic, Gregory Fremont-Barnes, p. 68, Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012 In the closing hours of 11 June, K and L Companies moved from their assembly area on Mount Challenger (which lay to the west of Mount Harriet) and made their way south, around their objective, across the minefield, to their respective start lines. As they moved around the feature in the dark, J Company with supporting Welsh Guards launched a loud diversionary \"attack\" from the west. ==Battle== A map of the Battle of Mount Harriet. The battle for Mount Harriet began on the evening of 11 June with a naval bombardment that killed two Argentinians and wounded twenty-five.Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.183, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999 John Witheroe, one of the British war correspondents, later recalled the bombardment: Speaking Out: Untold Stories from the Falklands War, p. 271, Andre Deutsch, 1989 The Argentines retaliated and Captain Tom\u00e1s Fox, the Artillery Observation Officer on Mount Kent, directed 155mm artillery rounds that fell among the men of 'B' Company, 7th Duke of Edinburgh's Own Gurkha Rifles in the area of Bluff Cove, seriously wounding three Gurkhas, including Lance Corporal Gyanendra Rai who nearly bled to death. During the patrolling period, the Royal Marines had discovered a path through a minefield that Lieutenant Roberto Francisco Eito's platoon of sappers from the 601st Combat Engineers Company had laid around Mount Harriet, allowing the 42 Commando rifle companies to attack the two Argentine 4th Regiment companies on Harriet from the rear.Evidentemente fue una infiltraci\u00f3n grand\u00edsima. Por los informes que tengo hasta ahora no puedo precisar exactamente el punto por donde entraron, pero s\u00ed s\u00e9 que entraron por el flanco que ten\u00edamos totalmente cubierto, que era el de la costa que iba para Puerto Argentino. Lo ten\u00edamos- minado, ese campo minado cost\u00f3 mucho tiempo, cost\u00f3 sudor, cost\u00f3 bajas, y se pusieron esas minas que pesan veinte kilos. Lo que pasa es que es como todo. Aunque a uno le pongan campos minados, si tenemos que atacar, atacamos igual y ya veremos por d\u00f3nde pasamos. Esa misma determinaci\u00f3n \u2014pienso\u2014 la ten\u00edan ellos. As\u00ed lucharon, Carlos M. T\u00farolo, p. 144, Editorial Subamericana, 1982 Captain Peter Babbington's K Company crossed their start line first and proceeded up the mountain undetected, knifing two sentries on the way. They remained undetected until they approached Sub-Lieutenant Mario Juarez' 120 mm mortar platoon positions and decided to engage them. They were assisted in the advance by HMS Yarmouth's, artillery, and their own battalions mortars. During the engagement, Second Lieutenant Juarez was badly wounded firing his handgun in the dark and Corporal Laurence G Watts from K Company was killed clearing the occupants of a tent. The supporting British artillery batteries and mortar crews fired over 1,000 rounds to keep the Argentines pinned down, and helped stop the defenders getting a proper aim at the Royal Marines from K and L Companies.\"Over 1,000 shells or bombs would fall on 'Zoya' alone that night, all of them instantly, precisely laid to cover movement, suppress defensive fire, break up resistance. They gave us an overwhelming advantage.\" Nick Vaux, March to the South Atlantic: 42 Commando, Royal Marines in the Falklands War, p. 177, Buchan & Enright, 1986 About 150 metres from Soria's HQ, Corporal Steve Newland circled behind a group of Argentines (under First Lieutenant Jorge Alejandro Echeverria, the 4th Regiment's intelligence officer) who were setting up an ambush. Newland pulled back into cover and warned the lead elements in K Company. Each time a Royal Marine moved, Corporal Roberto Baruzzo would open fire with the help of his night vision rifle scope, to make it appear there was only one enemy sniper holding up K Company. Lieutenant Echeverria's men were holding their fire in order to encourage the British to break cover and rush their position only to run into the concentrated fire of the machine-gun and protecting riflemen. Homenaje a h\u00e9roes de MalvinasWith half a platoon of disciplined RI4 and RI12 riflemen and a 7.62 mm general- purpose machine gun team threatening the British advance, Newland darted out from cover and charged the enemy. He neutralized the machine gun with grenades but on reaching the rear of the position, Corporal Baruzzo shot Newland in both legs. With the enemy machine gun out of action, Corporals Steve Newland, Mick Eccles and Chrystie 'Sharky' Ward were able to clear the remaining Argentine troops and captured 17 Argentines, including Echeverria who was shot five times. The three British corporals were each awarded the Military Medal. Increasing numbers of Argentine soldiers, mainly shocked and dazed conscripts from RI 4's Recce Platoon, Reserve Platoon and 120-mm Mortar Platoon began to surrender but several experienced officers (First Lieutenants Francisco Pablo D'Aloia, Esteban Guillermo Carlucci, Luis Oscar Garc\u00eda) and senior NCOs fought on, in accordance to their orders. The RI 4 Commanding Officer and First Lieutenant Rub\u00e9n Cichiara, despite heavy British fire, linked up with B Company and ordered Arroyo's men to counterattack. The heavy machine gun teams and protecting riflemen, in general, remained at their positions continuing the fight.Operation Corporate: The Falklands War, 1982, Martin Middlebrook, p.349, Viking, 1985 Captain David Wheen's L Company crossed their start line shortly after K Company and were almost immediately engaged by machine-gun fire from Sub-Lieutenant Pablo Oliva's platoon of conscripts defending the lower southern slopes. Kim Sabido, the IRN reporter with L Company, reported stiff Argentine resistance: War in the Falklands: The Full Story, p. 268, Harper & Row, 1982 The weapons in Oliva's platoon would not be silenced until being hit by several MILAN anti-tank missiles and the supporting 105mm artillery guns from Mount Challenger,Nine battles to Stanley, Nicholas Van der Bijl, p.186, Leo Cooper, 30/09/1999\"L Company's task was to clear and secure the western end of the Mount Harriet feature. Starting after k company across the same start line, surprise had been lost and so l Company came under effective fire from heavy machine-guns within 200 metres of the start line taking three casualties almost at once. Captain Wheen, Commanding l Company, called for MILAN to fire at the machine-gun positions.\". A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G. Wheen, Royal Marines with Oliva reporting the loss of 4 men in his platoon.

Se ve que pudieron cambiar de posici\u00f3n, porque estaban combatiendo muy fuerte.\" CARLOS TUROLO, As\u00ed Lucharon, p. 214, Editorial Sudamericana \"This involved a fighting advance of about 600 Metres and, as each position took a separate troop or section attack to deal with it, it took about five hours to cover the distance from the start line. The company found that it was best to keep skirmishing forward throughout this advance because going to ground for any length of time meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery fire, here artillery and small arms caused a further 4 gunshot and 7 shrapnel casualties.\". A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G. Wheen, Royal Marinesand contend they took fire from at least seven machine guns and protecting rifle teams that wounded five men, including the company's second-in-command and his signaller. British military historian Hugh Bicheno reports that the 4th Regiment's passive night goggles were all with Arroyo's B Company.Razor's Edge (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 2006)Another 11 Marines in Wheen's Company were wounded by Argentine shellfire that Lieutenant-Colonel Soria personally brought down attempting to halt the British advance.\"The Company found that it was best to keep skirmishing forward throughout this advance because going to ground for any length of time meant sitting in the middle of the enemy artillery defensive fire tasks that inflicted eleven casualties.\" No Picnic, Julian Thompson, Pen & Sword, 2008 Before first light, Lieutenant Jerry Burnell's 5 Troop of L Company proceeded to an outcrop of rocks towards Goat Ridge. As they advanced, the Royal Marine platoon came under fire from Second Lieutenant Jim\u00e9nez Corbal\u00e1n 3rd Platoon, covering the Argentine retreat and were forced to withdraw under cover of the machine guns pre-positioned behind and further up the hill.\"When reorganized his company, sent the prisoners to the rear and then ordered 5 troop to move forward to the company's next objective, an enemy position in the rocky outcrop about 500 Metres due North of the Western end of Harriet. Before they moved, Wheen concentrated all his available machine guns, fifteen guns in all, on the ridge. As 5 troop moved forward down the slope to the rocky outcrop, they came under heavy fire from their objective. Wheen pulled them back and then hit the enemy with mortar, artillery and machine-gun fire before ordering 5 troop forward again. They dashed forward with great determination and winkled or killed out the enemy.\" A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G. Wheen, Royal Marines The Troop took one casualty in this action. L Company requested mortar fire onto the Argentines; a mixture of High explosive (HE) and White phosphorus (WP); then 5 Troop moved forward supported by the 15 machine-guns positioned on the ridge. Mount Harriet &Two; Sisters The Argentinian Story They took 3 prisoners although most of Jim\u00e9nez-Corbal\u00e1n men had withdrawn after losing two killed in the night fighting (Privates Juan Jos\u00e9 Acu\u00f1a and Carlos Epifanio Casco). The platoon of Oscar Augusto Silva continued to resist from Goat Ridge in the early morning light and a determined conscript (Orlando Aylan), in a position just below the summit of Mount Harriet held up L Company with accurate shooting until killed by an 84mm anti-tank rocket fired at short range.\"One determined Argentinian sniper just below the highest part of the mountain held out long after other resistance in that area had ended. He hit 6 Troop's commander, Lieutenant Pusey, and the troop sergeant took over ... The sniper was eventually silenced by an 84-mm Carl Gustav rocket round fired at fifteen yards range.\" Operation Corporate: The Falklands War, 1982, Martin Middlebrook, p.349, Viking, 1985Francotiradores en la Guerra de Malvinas 5 Troop continued their advance across open ground towards Goat Ridge but came under fire and withdrew into the cover of rocks. British artillery bombarded Silva's platoon and Lima Company was able to resume the advance in the form of 4 Troop and captured Goat Ridge after Silva's men had withdrawn.\"After 10 Troop had occupied its objective, L Company advanced north across open ground towards Goat Ridge. When it came under fire from Silva's platoon in its western crags, 5 Troop withdrew to allow a fire mission to pound the rocks and then 4 Troop captured the objective.\" Nine Battles to Stanley, Nick Van Der Bijl, Pen & Sword, 2014 At some time in the early morning darkness, Second Lieutenant Jim\u00e9nez Corbal\u00e1n's 3rd platoon were making their way to new positions on Mount William, the officer was concussed and temporarily blinded when he set off an Argentine booby-trap while leading his men through a minefield. At great risk to themselves, Privates Teodoro Flores and Carlos Salvatierra rescued their platoon commander and were decorated for their bravery. ==Aftermath== The battle was an example of good planning, use of deception and surprise and was a further step towards the main objective of Stanley. Two Royal Marines: Corporal Laurence G Watts and Acting Corporal Jeremy Smith were killed, and thirty were wounded, including fourteen in L Company.\"Two Companies of 42 CDO had taken a regimental position for 2 killed and 30 wounded ... We had been ordered to be prepared to press forward the attack onto Mount Tumbledown and Mount William if the enemy fled our initial attack, and time allowed. By dawn, it was obvious that we were in no position to attack. We were exhausted, out of ammo and suffering significant casualties. My 2IC, a radio operator, my tac HQ machine gunner and one of my troop commanders had all been shot and a further 10 wounded. Another troop Commander was suffering from shellshock\". A Rifle Company Commander's Perspective, Major David G. Wheen, Royal MarinesAnother six Scots Guards and Gurkhas were wounded by Argentine artillery and mortar fire controllers on Mount Harriet. A supporting British Gazelle helicopter had also been lost in a friendly-fire incident early on 6 June, killing both pilots and two signallers.Razor's Edge, Hugh Bicheno, p. 207, Orion Publishing Group, 2007 Eighteen Argentines were killed defending Mount Harriet, including those killed in earlier patrol battles and shelling.

Some British reporters were thus misled into depicting the Argentineans as hapless teenage conscripts who caved in after the first shots were fired, but Royal Marine Warrant Officer 2 John Cartledge, who served with L Company during the battle, corrected them, saying the Argentines were good soldiers who had fought properly: > They used the tactics which they had been taught along the way very well, > they were quite prepared for an attack.
