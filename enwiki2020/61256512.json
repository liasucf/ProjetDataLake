    "text": ", born Son Shi Kin, was a Japanese professional golfer. == Professional career == Ono was one of the leading golfers on the Japanese circuit during the 1950s. He won the Japan Open Golf Championship, the nation's most prestigious tournament, three times. He also won the 1955 Japan PGA Championship. Around this time in his career he changed his name to Koichi Ono. Ono is best known for his performance in the 1957 Canada Cup. Ono and his playing partner Torakichi Nakamura were hosts at the event, held at Kasumigaseki Country Club in Japan. The Canada Cup, a precursor to the World Cup, featured an elite field that included Sam Snead, Gary Player, and Peter Thomson. Nakamura and Ono won the event, and won easily, defeating Americans Jimmy Demaret and Snead by nine shots. The American sportswriter Herbert Warren Wind, writing in Sports Illustrated, compared it to Francis Ouimet's famous upset victory at the 1913 U.S. Open. The event was widely televised in Japan and helped spur a golfing boom in the country. This good play helped Ono and Nakamura receive special foreign invitations to the 1958 Masters Tournament. They were the first non-white players to play at the Masters. Ono continued to play well throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s, winning the Kanto Pro Championship an additional four times. == Professional wins == *1949 Kanto Pro Championship *1951 Japan Open Golf Championship *1953 Japan Open Golf Championship *1954 Yomiuri Pro Championship *1955 Japan Open Golf Championship, Japan PGA Championship *1957 Yomiuri Pro Championship, Canada Cup (team event) *1958 Kanto Pro Championship *1959 Kanto Pro Championship *1962 Kanto Pro Championship *1963 Kanto Pro Championship ==Team appearances== *Canada Cup (representing Japan): 1955, 1957 (winners), 1958, 1960 == References == Category:Japanese male golfers Category:1919 births Category:2000 deaths ",
