According to Gendov, shooting started on 16 May 1910 and the premi\u00e8re was in the Modern Theatre in Sofia on 22 June 1910. However, the earliest written record of a showing of the film points to 13 January 1915 as the date of the premi\u00e8re. The film was almost entirely destroyed during the World War II bombardment of Sofia. All that remains is one or two frames. ==Cast== *Vasil Gendov - Bulgaran * Mara Miyateva-Lipina - the Lady *Angelov - the Husband *Metodi Stanoev - first passer-by *Todor Stamboliev - second passer-by *Anton Delbelo - restaurant client ==Plot== Bulgaran is an elegant and outgoing gentleman.
