From 1824 onwards he worked with the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Gymnase dramatique (formerly Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Madame), which at the time was directed by Charles-Gaspard Delestre-Poirson. He appeared next to Virginie D\u00e9jazet and L\u00e9ontine Fay in vaudevilles by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe. Despr\u00e9aux won the Premier Grand Prix de Rome with the cantata Herminie se couvrant des armes de Clorinde in 1828, while Berlioz who had also participated in the competition, returned empty-handed. Despr\u00e9aux went to Rome in 1829 where he composed, among other works, a Requiem and a Dies Irae. Back in Paris, he composed mainly theatre music. His opera Le Souper du mari was premiered at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1833, followed by La Dame d'honneur. Despr\u00e9aux died aged 62 in Paris. ==External links== Category:1802 births Category:1865 deaths Category:19th-century classical composers Category:19th-century French composers Category:19th-century male musicians Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:French opera composers Category:French Romantic composers Category:People from Clermont-Ferrand Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:Pupils of Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis ",
