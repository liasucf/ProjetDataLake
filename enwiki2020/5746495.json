In the weeks leading up to the team selection, Farah was contacted by New South Wales coach Ricky Stuart, to explain that his first choice for hooker would be Danny Buderus, who had recently returned to the NRL. Furthermore, assistant coach Steve Roach declared Farah was not, \"an Origin type player.\" After an injury to Buderus, and a man-of-the-match performance in the City vs Country Origin match, Farah was named at hooker for the first match of the series. Despite playing for the losing team, Farah was described as, \"one of the Blues' most creative and effective players.\" New South Wales won the second match of the series, and Farah was named as the player's player. During the match, Farah handled the ball 101 times and made a record 63 tackles, and missed no tackles.

On 22 March, Farah signed a new 4-year contract to remain with the Wests Tigers until the end of the 2017 season. He said, \"As captain of the club, I see myself as having the responsibility, when things aren't as good as we\u2019d like them to be ... I see it as my challenge to help turn the club around, not to just give up and walk away. You might get cranky at some things, but you've got to ride the good times and the bad times. That\u2019s what it's all about.\" Farah was chosen again to play for City, a record sixth appearance for a hooker, and the fourth consecutive time as captain. Farah was selected to play hooker for NSW in the 2013 Series in all 3 games. On 12 July, following an injury to Paul Gallen, Farah was named captain for NSW for the first time for the series-deciding third game. Unfortunately for New South Wales, Queensland won the game 12\u201310.

In July, a feud erupted between Farah and Gorden Tallis over claims by the former great that Farah had told him Michael Potter \"can't coach\". Tallis said \"Robbie Farah told me to my face when I was on Triple M last year on a Saturday show, he told me that Mick Potter can't coach,\" Tallis said. \"I don't go on Chinese whispers; I go on what he told me.\" Later, Tigers coach Mick Potter said that Farah didn't want to leave the club. \"We are fine and we have always been fine, there has been no confrontation at all,\" Potter said.

Despite suffering a shoulder injury, Farah was described as, \"still one of the most influential players on the field,\" in the 10\u201311 loss. The Sydney Morning Herald said \"his workload with and without the ball was huge, completing a game-high 55 tackles and cleaning up a Cooper Cronk grubber kick when the Maroons appeared poised to score. No wonder the Queenslanders wanted him off the park.\" Between the first and second State of Origin matches, Farah made no appearances for the Wests Tigers dues to his shoulder injury. It was said he, \"Seemed to have a target painted on that bung shoulder,\" as Queensland forced him to make a game-high 48 tackles in the second game of the series as NSW won the game 26\u201318 at the MCG. In August, Farah was given permission from the Tigers to investigate opportunities to continue his playing career at another club from 2016 onward. Farah finished the 2015 NRL season with him playing in 17 matches and scoring 2 tries. During the 2015 off-season, Farah's contract saga was highly publicized. There were reports of Farah being demoted to New South Wales Cup if he stayed, his relationship with coach Jason Taylor turning sour, and about his $800,000 a season contract chewing up the Tigers salary cap. Farah dropped himself as the Tigers captain and was replaced by Aaron Woods, having set a club record 148 matches as captain. ===2016=== With Farah missing some games early in the season, it was noted that Wests Tigers had won one game from seven with him playing, and four of six games he was absent from. There was further drama when Jason Taylor chose to play him from the bench and rested him after State of Origin matches. He was chosen for all 3 games for NSW, and it was said, \"Running Robbie ran the Queenslanders ragged early on and added 44-tackles to another quality Origin performance,\" in game 2. He topped the tackle count again in the third match, the only match won by NSW. A week later, Farah was dropped to reserve grade by Jason Taylor and remained in NSW cup until the end of the season. He then signed with the South Sydney Rabbitohs ending a thirteen-year career with the Wests Tigers. Farah finished his drama-filled season with 2 tries in 9 appearances.

In Round 3, against the Newcastle Knights, Farah played his 250th milestone match in the 24\u201318 win at Hunter Stadium. Farah played all 24 of Souths matches for the season, alternating between starting at hooker and playing from the bench. Farah returned to representing Lebanon for the 2017 World Cup and played in the country's first ever World Cup match victory over France on 29 October 2017. ===2018=== Having shared the role of hooker with Damien Cook in 2017, Farah was demoted to reserve grade with the North Sydney Bears at the start of 2018, with Cook taking on the role full-time. Farah later said he considered retirement during this time. \"I just didn\u2019t want to be there. It was hard, mate. Really hard. I don\u2019t want to disrespect Norths because they are a great club \u2026 but it was embarrassing for me. You get there, you get heckled by the crowd. There's always a smart-arse.\" Farah made his first appearance for Souths in their Round 13 victory over Cronulla, filling in while Cook played State of Origin. Despite his absence from first grade, Farah was praised for his performance which included \"a whopping\" 62 tackles. On 21 June, Farah returned to the West Tigers on a mid-season transfer, and was chosen as the first grade hooker the same week. Souths General manager Shane Richardson said they would not have released Farah to any other club, but, \"The reason we let Robbie go was because it was the right thing to do.\" He had made 2 appearances for Souths before his departure. On 21 July, he played his 250th game for the Wests Tigers in their victory over ladder- leaders, the Rabbitohs. During the match, Farah was knocked out in the 71st minute when he attempted to tackle Souths player George Burgess. Farah started at hooker for every game at Wests Tigers after he rejoined the club, making 9 appearances. Farah's contract renewal for 2019 was announced at the same time as long-time teammate Benji Marshall. He said, \"Once he texted me late last night to tell me he was staying on again, it relieved the nerves, to be honest. To know he was there for another year - the two old boys at the club - it made me feel a lot better.\" ===2019=== Declared the \"King of Leichhardt\" in round 1, Farah scored two tries and topped the tackle count for the Tigers. He said, \"The boys calling us grand-dads and stuff... I try and take that a bit personal, you know. I go out there and try and challenge the younger boys and try and show them that the old fella's still got it.\" On 24 July, Farah spoke to the media ahead of his 300th first grade appearance and how he had received messages of support. Farah then used the opportunity to speak about former Wests Tigers head coach Jason Taylor saying \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to hear from JT anyway, At the time I was told by him and Rod Reddy, I\u2019d finish my career in reserve grade. But I\u2019m here now - \u2018JT\u2019 is coaching reserve grade\u2019\u2019. Farah went on to say \u201cI was running around with the Bears in NSW Cup and I was ready to walk away from the game. It was pretty hard to try and find the motivation to go and play and I thought I was done. In round 21 against Canterbury- Bankstown, Farah was taken from the field during the club's 18-16 loss at ANZ Stadium with a leg injury. Scans revealed that Farah had suffered a leg fracture. On 19 August 2019, Farah spoke to the media saying that he was considering going against doctors advice to play. Farah went on to say \"If we've got to win to make the semis, I'll cut it off if I have to, at the end of the day it's my decision but they definitely recommended that (I don't play again). It's just a matter of gathering the information from them as best I could and whatever risk I put upon myself is my decision\" In round 25 of the 2019 NRL season, Farah was ruled out of the Wests Tigers game against Cronulla-Sutherland but was then dramatically recalled to the team as Wests player Corey Thompson was injured in the warm up. Wests went into the game with Cronulla knowing that the winner would reach the finals. Farah lead Wests out onto the field of a packed Leichhardt Oval in what would be his final game as a player as Cronulla won the match 25\u20138. ===Highlights=== *First Grade Debut: 2003 \u2013 Round 13, Wests Tigers v Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, Leichhardt Oval, Sydney - 8 June 2003 *Premierships: 2005 \u2013 Wests Tigers defeated North Queensland Cowboys 30 - 16 in the Grand Final, Stadium Australia, Sydney - 2 October 2005 *Wests Tigers Club Captain: 2009-2015 *Lebanon Test Debut: 2002 \u2013 Mediterranean Cup, Lebanon v France, International Olympic Stadium, Tripoli, Lebanon - 3 November 2002 *NSW City Origin Debut: 2006 \u2013 NSW City Origin v NSW Country Origin, Apex Oval, Dubbo, New South Wales - 12 May 2006. *NSW City Origin Selection: 2006\u20132007, 2009-2012 *NSW City Origin Captain: 2009-2012 *Prime Minister's XIII Debut: 2006 \u2013 Prime Minister's XIII v Papua New Guinea, Lloyd Robson Oval, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea - 30 September 2006 *Prime Minister's XIII Selection: 2006, 2008-2009 *New South Wales Debut: 2009 \u2013 State of Origin Game 1, New South Wales v Queensland, Docklands Stadium, Melbourne - 3 June 2009 *New South Wales Selection: 2009, 2012-2014 *New South Wales Captain: 2013 \u2013 State of Origin Game 3, New South Wales v Queensland, ANZ Stadium, Sydney - 17 July 2013. *Australia Test Debut: 2009 \u2013 Rugby League Four Nations Round 2, Australia v England, DW Stadium, Wigan, England - 31 October 2009 *Australia Test Squad Selection: 2009-2011 *NRL All Stars Debut: 2010 \u2013 NRL All Stars v Indigenous All Stars at Skilled Park, Robina, Queensland - 13 February 2010. ===Honours=== * 2010 RLIF Team of the Year * 2010 Dally M Player of the Year runner-up * 2010 Dally M Hooker of the Year * 2007 Dally M Player of the Year runner-up * 2007 Dally M Hooker of the Year ==References== ==External links== *Wests Tigers profile *South Sydney Rabbitohs profile *Rabbitohs profile *2017 RLWC profile Category:1984 births Category:Australian people of Lebanese descent Category:Australia national rugby league team players Category:Lebanon national rugby league team players Category:Wests Tigers players Category:South Sydney Rabbitohs players Category:North Sydney Bears NSW Cup players Category:New South Wales Rugby League State of Origin players Category:New South Wales City Origin rugby league team players Category:NRL All Stars players Category:Wests Tigers NSW Cup players Category:Prime Minister's XIII players Category:Prime Minister's XIII captains Category:Rugby league hookers Category:Rugby league players from Sydney Category:Living people ",
