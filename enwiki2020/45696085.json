    "text": "Salut d'Amour (; lit. \"Jang-soo's Mart\" or \"Jang-soo's Store\") is a 2015 South Korean romance dramedy film starring Park Geun-hyung and Youn Yuh-jung and directed by Kang Je-gyu. ==Plot== Sung-chil is a grumpy 70-year-old man who lives alone and works part-time at the local supermarket. Jang-soo, owner of the supermarket and president of the city's redevelopment project, has been trying in vain to get Sung-chil's signature (he's the last hold-out and the only reason for the project's delay), but Sung-chil stubbornly refuses any change to his lifestyle. Then he meets his new neighbor Geum-nim, a feisty yet friendly elderly lady who runs the flower shop next door. Despite his age, Sung-chil is inexperienced and clumsy at romance so the entire town cheers him on and helps him court her. But Geum-nim's daughter Min-jung disapproves of the relationship. ==Cast== *Park Geun-hyung as Kim Sung-chil **Jung Hae-in as young Sung-chil **Ko Yoon-ho as middle-aged Sung-chil *Youn Yuh-jung as Im Geum-nim **Yoon So-hee as young Geum-nim **Lee Moon-jung as middle-aged Geum- nim *Cho Jin-woong as Jang-soo *Han Ji-min as Min-jung *Kim Jung-tae as Kim Chi-soo *Hwang Woo-seul-hye as Miss Park *Lee Jun-hyeok as Ok Bok-sung *Kim Jae-hwa as Madam Wang *Moon Ga-young as Ah-young *Park Chanyeol as Min-sung *Bae Ho-geun as Jegal Chung-soo *Nam Myung-ryul as Old gentleman *Kim Ha-yoo as Da-young *Choi Kyu-hwan as Ho-joon *Lee Cho-hee as Bank clerk *Yeom Hye-ran as Milk woman *Baek Il-seob (cameo) *Im Ha-ryong (cameo) ==Remake== A Chinese remake directed by Eric Tsang is in pre-production and is scheduled for release in China in 2017. == Awards and nominations == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Award !Category !Recipient !Result |- |2015 |The Golden Goblet |Best Film |Kang Je-gyu | |} ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:South Korean films Category:South Korean romantic comedy films Category:Films directed by Kang Je-gyu Category:CJ Entertainment films ",
