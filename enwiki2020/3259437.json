Their first release Cobra Mission: Panic in Cobra City was self-rated NR-18 (a rating indicating the presence of nudity and sexual content), the second two were NR-13 with the option of purchasing an upgrade to NR-18, and the last was self-rated as acceptable for all ages. All were made for MS-DOS. Upgrades were purchased separately and came in the form of 3.5 floppy disks that were installed separately. The games had some voice acting starting with Cobra Mission:Panic in Cobra City which was limited to moans from the female characters in the game. Metal & Lace had a wider range of voice acting, however, again it was limited to single sentences said by the female characters. Knights of Xentar used CD-ROM technology to have a wide array of voice acting including complete voices during all cut scenes by both male and female characters. They appeared at Anime Expo 1993 promoting two of their new games.Megatech's Anime Expo '93 Appearance Megatech folded sometime in between 1997 and 1999.
