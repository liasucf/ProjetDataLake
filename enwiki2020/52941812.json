Dellar was born in Kanowna, Western Australia, to Eileen Grace (n\u00e9e Henderson) and Benjamin James Dellar. He was educated at state schools in Menzies and Salmon Gums before going on to the Kalgoorlie School of Mines. After finishing his education, Dellar worked for periods on the mines at Linden, Menzies, Kanowna, and Kalgoorlie. He enlisted in the Australian Army in 1942, initially with an anti-aircraft unit and later as a troop instructor. Dellar was discharged in 1946, and returned to mining.David Peter Dellar, Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia. Retrieved 22 January 2017. In 1959, Dellar was elected to the Kalgoorlie Road Board, where he served until 1969. A long-time member of the Labor Party, he was elected to parliament at a Legislative Council by-election in June 1963, caused by the death of William Hall. Dellar's constituency was abolished in a redistribution prior to the 1965 state election. He attempted to transfer to the new Lower North Province, but was defeated by George Brand of the Liberal Party. After leaving politics, Dellar worked as a manager for Atlas Copco until 1974, and then as a prospector. He died in Kalgoorlie in January 1994, aged 78. Dellar's son, Stan Dellar, and granddaughter, Melissa Price, also became members of parliament. ==References== Category:1915 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Australian Army soldiers Category:Australian Labor Party members of the Parliament of Western Australia Category:Australian military personnel of World War II Category:Australian miners Category:Members of the Western Australian Legislative Council Category:People from Kalgoorlie Category:Western Australian local government politicians ",
