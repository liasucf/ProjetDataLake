    "text": "There have been four baronetcies created for persons with the surname O'Brien, one in the Baronetage of Ireland and three in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. The O'Brien Baronetcy, of Leaghmenagh in the County of Clare, was created in the Baronetage of Ireland on 9 November 1686; for more information see Baron Inchiquin. The O'Brien Baronetcy, of Merrion Square in Dublin and Boris-in-Ossory in Queen's County, was created in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom on 25 September 1849 for Timothy O'Brien. He was a merchant, Lord Mayor of Dublin and Liberal Member of Parliament for Cashel. The second Baronet represented King's County in the House of Commons as a Liberal for over thirty years. The third Baronet was a Deputy Lieutenant of County Cork. As of 2007 the presumed seventh and present Baronet has not successfully proven his succession and is therefore not on the Official Roll of the Baronetage, with the baronetcy considered dormant.
