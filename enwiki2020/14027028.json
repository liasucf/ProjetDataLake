    "text": "In Norse mythology, M\u00f6g\u00ferasir (Old Norse, possibly meaning \"the one who is striving for sons\"Simek (2007:221).) is a j\u00f6tunn who is solely attested in stanza 49 of the poem Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l from the Poetic Edda. == Vaf\u00fer\u00fa\u00f0nism\u00e1l == M\u00f6g\u00ferasir is mentioned during the contest of wisdom between Odin and the giant Vafthrudnir (here anglicized as Mogthrasir): {| | style=\"padding: 1pt 10pt;\" | Stanza 48: :Odin said: :\"Much I have travelled, much have I tried out, :much have I tested the Powers; :who are those maidens who journey in troops, :wise in spirit, over the sea?\"Larrington's translation. | style=\"padding: 1pt 10pt;\" | Stanza 49: :Vafthrudnir said: :\"Three of the race of Mogthrasir's girls :travel over the settlements, :they are bringers of luck in the world, :although they are raised among giants.\" |} == Theories == According to Carolyne Larrington, the identities of these maidens are uncertain but they are probably the Norns. If this is the case, then M\u00f6g\u00ferasir is either their father or is being used as a kenning to indicate the Norns' kinship with the j\u00f6tnar. == Notes == == References == * Larrington, Carolyne (transl.)
