From the village's establishment, villagers have followed the Greek Catholic faith; in 1700 there were 348 Greek Catholics out of 351 people living in the village. It is located in the Slovak Catholic Metropolitan Archeparchy of Pre\u0161ov. Two natives of the village, brothers \u0160imon \u0160tefan and Michal Manuel Ol\u0161avsk\u00fd, made their hometown famous as bishops of the Greek Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo in the eighteenth century. In the late nineteenth century, many villagers emigrated to the United States. In 1944, the village was the site of a mass rescue of some 50 refugees, including 35 Jews who escaped the Holocaust in Slovakia, due to the exhortations of local Slovak Catholic priest Michal Ma\u0161lej, who was held in high esteem by the farmers. Preaching that it was their Christian duty to help refugees, Ma\u0161lej arranged for persecuted families to hide with various parishioners, and hid the Hartmann family in his personal residence. When German troops had to be quartered in the village, he made sure that they were not placed with any of the families involved in the rescue effort. Ma\u0161lej's efforts were supported by his Bishop, Pavel Peter Gojdi\u010d. When Ma\u0161lej was concerned about the danger to his congregants, Gojdi\u010d told him: \"The support to the persecuted results of charity and it is your duty according to your capacity to help and to provide shelter to the threatened by deportation\". Researcher Nina Paulovi\u010dov\u00e1 compared O\u013e\u0161avica to Nieuwlande and Le Chambon-sur-Lignon\u2014other villages where the population banded together to hide Jews\u2014adding that it was \"remarkable\" that no one informed on the fugitives and none of them were arrested. Ma\u0161lej was recognized as Righteous among the Nations by the Israeli official Holocaust memorial, Yad Vashem, in 1997. ==Geography== The Greek Catholic church in O\u013e\u0161avica O\u013e\u0161avica lies at an altitude of and covers an area of .
