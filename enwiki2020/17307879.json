Econcern employed 1,200 professionals in over 20 countries across the world. ==Bankruptcy== In May 2009 Econcern filed for Dutch Chapter 11 for suspension of payments, the first step towards bankruptcy, after it failed to agree on refinancing terms on a \u20ac150 million corporate loan which matured on 1 April 2009. An administrator was appointed by a Dutch court to work with the board to try to identify new financing solutions. At stake were assets under development, such as the Belwind and Gode Wind I offshore wind farms, as well as operational assets, such as Q7. The company went bankrupt in Q3 2009. ==References== ==External links== * Article on creation of Econcern new corporate visual identity, presented on Malta in September 2008 Category:Defunct companies of the Netherlands ",
