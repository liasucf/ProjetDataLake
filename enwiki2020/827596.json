Graham Staines was burnt alive along with their two sons Philip (aged 10) and Timothy (aged 7) by a mob led by the Bajrang Dal activist Dara Singh in Odisha, India on 22 January 1999. Shortly after the sentencing of the killers, Staines issued a statement saying that she had forgiven the killers and had no bitterness towards them.\"I have forgiven them\": Gladys Staines Rather than return to Australia, Staines \"decided to stay in India where she and her husband had served lepers for 15 years\", keeping her daughter Esther, with her, stating: \"I cannot just leave those people who love and trust us. I have high regard for the people of India and their tolerance.\" In 2004, Christianity Today described this woman as \"the best-known Christian in India after Mother Teresa.\" In 2005, she was awarded the Padma Shri, a civilian award from the Government of India. As a result of the contributions earned from receiving that award, Staines transformed the leper house she served at into a full hospital. In November 2015, Staines was awarded the Mother Teresa Memorial Award for Social Justice and after receiving the award, she stated \"I thank God for his help in enabling me to carry out the work in caring for people with leprosy, even after my husband was killed.\" == References == ==External links== * \"Kalam meets Gladys Staines\", 15 May 2003 * \"No comments, says Gladys Staines\", 15 September 2003 * \"Gladys Staines may leave India forever\" - Times of India article, 14 July 2004 * \"Gladys Staines bids adieu to India\" - Times of India article, 15 July 2004 * \"Gladys Staines leaves India promising to return\" Category:1950s births Category:Living people Category:Recipients of the Padma Shri in social work Category:Australian Protestant missionaries Category:Protestant missionaries in India Category:Date of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Australian expatriates in India Category:Leprosy nurses and caregivers ",
