    "text": "The Kam\u2013Tai languages, also called Dong\u2013Tai () or Zhuang\u2013Dong () in China, are a proposed primary branch of the Kra\u2013Dai language family. The Kam\u2013Tai grouping is primarily used in China, including by the linguists Liang & Zhang (1996). Liang & Zhang (1996) classify Kam\u2013Sui, Be, and Tai together as the Dong-Tai \u4f97\u53f0 branch, due to the large number of lexical items shared by all three branches vis-a-vis the more divergent Kra () and Hlai () branches. Liang & Zhang (1996) also propose a reconstruction of Proto-Kam\u2013Tai. A Kam\u2013Tai group consisting of Kam\u2013Sui and Tai is accepted by Edmondson & Solnit (1988).Edmondson, Jerold A. and David B. Solnit, editors. 1988.

Wu (2002) presents a reconstruction of Proto- Kra-Dai, which is based on data from the Tai, Kam-Sui, Hlai, and Kra branches.Wu, Anqi \u5434\u5b89\u5176. 2002.
