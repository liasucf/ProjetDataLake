    "text": "Mega Ligtas COVID Centers, also known as Temporary Treatment and Monitoring Facilities (TTMFs), are temporary non-hospital health facilities or emergency patient care centers (PCCs) established and managed by the Philippine government to accommodate patients at a provincial or regional level as part of its efforts to deal with the pandemic in the country. Some facilities are also serving as quarantine sites for Filipino repatriates from other countries. The establishment of such facilities are led by the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) coordinating with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority (BCDA) and other private and government entities by refurbishing pre-existing structures or setting up makeshift tents. The first We Heal as One Center was the facility at the Ninoy Aquino Stadium, an indoor arena within the Rizal Memorial Sports Complex in Manila which was refurbished as a health facility on April 6 and admitted its first patient on April 14. At least seven other facilities became operational at a later date. The government is planning to open more facilities in Cebu. Some of these facilities are known as We Heal as One Centers, adapted from the COVID-19 solidarity campaign in the Philippines, \"We Heal as One\" which in turn was derived from the slogan of the 2019 Southeast Asian Games, hosted by the country, \"We Win as One\". \"Mega\" in the name of the Mega Ligtas COVID Centers does not connote bed capacity, with the smallest Mega Ligtas COVID Center being the 28-bed capacity BRP Ang Pangulo. Isolation/quarantine facilities managed by local government units rather than the national government are officially known as \"Ligtas COVID Centers\" regardless of bed capacity. Both Ligtas COVID Centers and Mega Ligtas COVID Centers are classed as Community Isolation Units. == Facilities == We Heal as One Center logo. === Clark === ==== ASEAN Convention Center ==== The ASEAN Convention Center at the Clark Freeport Zone in Pampanga was converted to a quarantine facility with a capacity of 150 beds. ==== New Clark City Government Center ==== The New Clark City Government Center building at New Clark City in Capas, Tarlac was initially equipped with at least 400 beds, though its capacity is expandable to 1,000 beds.
