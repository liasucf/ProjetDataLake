    "text": "Gearoid Towey (born 26 March 1977 in Fermoy, Republic of Ireland) is an Irish Olympic Athlete and former World Rowing Champion, and Trans-Atlantic rower. He competed at three Olympics \u2013 Sydney 2000, Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008. Towey, along with Ciaran Lewis, attempted to cross the Atlantic Ocean in 2005 in a 23 ft rowing boat. After 40 days at sea, having endured two tropical storms and a hurricane on the way, their boat was pitch poled by a 10-meter wave, leaving the men adrift 900 miles from landfall. They were rescued in the middle of a force 9 storm at night by the supertanker \"Hispania Spirit\". He lives in Sydney Australia and is the founder of Crossing the Line Sport \u2013 an organisation dedicated to athlete mental health and transition out of sport. He is a regular speaker on the topic of transition, especially the transition from elite athlete to the next phase of life. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Irish male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Ireland Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:Rowers at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Rowers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:World Rowing Championships medalists for Ireland ",
