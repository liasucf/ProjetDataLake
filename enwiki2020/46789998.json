    "text": "Fred F. Haberlein, born circa 1946, is an American muralist, painter, and sculptor. He grew up at Conejos Ranch, a guest ranch in Conejos County, Colorado. He studied sculpture and printmaking in college, but he is best known for his murals throughout the western United States, predominantly in Colorado. He lives near Glenwood Springs, Colorado. Haberlein has twice been nominated for the Colorado Governor's Award for Excellence in the Arts. He taught art classes at Colorado Mountain College for eighteen years. His first mural was rendered in Oracle, AZ in 1977, and he has completed over 130 murals since then. A Native American friend gave him the name \"Lightning Heart,\" which he uses professionally. Haberlein has completed more single-handed murals than any other U.S. artist. ==List of murals by location== ===Colorado=== ====San Luis Valley==== =====Alamosa===== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
