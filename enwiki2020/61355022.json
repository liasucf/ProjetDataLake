The symphony performs at a variety of venues in and around Los Angeles, including the Walt Disney Concert Hall, the Ford Theatres, and the Gindi Auditorium at American Jewish University. According to Ventura Blvd Magazine, \u201cEven though the symphony\u2019s repertoire references the historic and cultural Jewish experience, it maintains broad appeal with programs marked by contemporary themes and issues that affect us all.\u201d ==Biography== Since their founding in 1994, the Los Angeles Jewish Symphony has performed with a variety of entertainers, including Tovah Feldshuh, Roslyn Kind, Emily Bear, David Benoit, Hila Plitmann, Leonard Nimoy, Theodore Bikel, Marvin Hamlisch, Randy Newman, Hershey Felder, Laraine Newman, Dave Koz, Melissa Manchester, Amick Byram, and Alberto Mizrahi.

In 2004, the symphony began the education outreach program \u201cA Patchwork of Cultures: Exploring the Sephardic-Latino Connection.\u201d The program explores the shared music, traditions, and history of both Sephardic Judaism and Latino cultures through a series of classroom workshops and a culminating concert event. From 2008-2014, the symphony performed in a series of benefit concerts entitled Kindred Spirits at Walt Disney Concert Hall, benefiting a different humanitarian organization each year.
