This type of literature originated in Japan, where it has become a popular literary genre. However, its popularity has also spread to other countries internationally, especially to China, United States, Germany, and South Africa. Chapters usually consist of about 70\u2013100 words each due to character limitations on cell phones. Phone novels started out primarily read and authored by young women on the subject of romantic fiction such as relationships, lovers, rape, love triangles, and pregnancy. However, mobile phone novels are gaining worldwide popularity on broader subjects. Rather than appearing in printed form, the literature is typically sent directly to the reader via email, SMS text message, or subscription through an online writing and sharing website, chapter by chapter. Japanese Internet ethos regarding mobile phone novels is dominated by pen names and forged identities. Therefore, identities of the Japanese authors of mobile phone novels are rarely disclosed. Japanese cell phone novels were also downloaded in short installments and run on handsets as Java-based mobile applications in three different formats: WMLD, JAVA and TXT. Maho i-Land is the largest Japanese cell phone novel site that carries more than a million titles, mainly novice writers, all which are available for free.

The use of compact and highly contextual writing is a well-established part of Japanese literary tradition, and cell phone novels have been compared to classic Japanese literature such as the 11th Century Tale of Genji. The first cell phone novel was \"published\" in Japan in 2003 by a Tokyo man in his mid-thirties who calls himself Yoshi. His first cell phone novel was called Deep Love, the story of a teenager engaged in \"subsidized dating\" (enj\u014d kosai) in Tokyo and contracting AIDS. It became so popular that it was published as an actual book, with 2.6 million copies sold in Japan, then spun off into a television series, a manga, and a movie. The cell phone novel became a hit mainly through word of mouth and gradually started to gain traction in Taiwan, China, and South Korea among young adults. In Japan, several sites offer large prizes to authors (up to $100,000 US) and purchase the publishing rights to the novels. Kiki, the pseudonymous author of I, Girlfriend won the Japan Keitai Novel Award in 2008. The movement also became popular in Europe, Africa and North America.

These writers understand what narratives will attract young readers, incorporating emergent events or trendy elements from teen culture into their stories. Cell phone novels create a virtual world for teenagers via the mobile phone, or, more precisely, via text messages. As in virtual online video games, readers can put themselves into first person in the story. Cell phone novels create a personal space for each individual reader. As Paul Levinson wrote in Cellphone, \"nowadays, a writer can write just about as easily, anywhere, as a reader can read\" (p 20). The cell phone novel is changing reading habits; readers no longer need to physically go to a bookshop and purchase a book. They can go online using their cell phone, download a novel, and read it on their personal mobile phone anywhere, any time they wish. Similar to the e-book, its mobility and convenience saves time. == Characteristics and literary style == Because of the short chapter format consisting of around 70\u2013100 words (usually fewer than 200), the phenomenon has brought a new approach to literature, allowing a new vision to potentially redefine traditional writing and the publishing world. Despite the use of cell phones, most of these novels are not written with SMS slang and language. Instead, it has brought out a new era of minimalism and art. In each chapter, readers will be able to experience narration, poetry and even visual arts in the use of carefully chosen line breaks, punctuation, rhythm and white space. Often, cell phone novels features the use of fragments, conversational, simple and delicate language; cliffhangers and dramatic dialogue emphasized by the unseen or omitted becomes a vital part of the reading experience, allowing deeper meanings and interpretations to unfold. Because of the use of poetic language, mood, emotions and internal thoughts are stimulated in the reader easily. Dramatic and drastic plots takes readers through twists and turns, cliffhanger after cliffhanger, always keeping the reader waiting for the next chapter installment. The nature of writing and reading on the go, creates a unique experience, allowing the writer and reader to approach literature in a different way, opening interactivity between the readers and the writer as the story develops in \"real time\". ==See also== * Drabble * Constrained writing * Verse novel * Japanese mobile phone culture * SMS * Texting * Light novel * Visual novel * Web fiction == Notes == == References == * Howard Rheingold (2002) Smart Mobs: the Next Social Revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp. xi\u2013xxii, 157\u2013182 * Paul Levinson (2004) Cellphone, Palgrave/St. Martin's, New York, pp. 15\u201333 * Dana Goodyear (2008) The New Yorker; \"I <3 Novels\" newyorker.com * Asahi Shimbun (2007) \u666e\u901a\u306e\u82e5\u8005\u304c\u643a\u5e2f\u5c0f\u8aac \u30d9\u30b9\u30c8\u30bb\u30e9\u30fc\u3082\u7d9a\u3005 books.asahi.com * United Daily News (2008) \u624b\u6a5f\u5c0f\u8aaa \u300c\u6309\u300d\u51fa\u65b0\u6587\u5b78 mag.udn.com == External links == * Documentary on Cell Phone Novels Video explaining cell phone novels in North America * Detailed Article by cell phone novelist The pioneer English cell phone novel writer, exploring cell phone novels in Japan, and in English * The Wattpad Cell Phone Novel Network A cell phone novel writing community with resources and guides * Mobile Phone Novel Website about cell phone novels * India gets its first Phone Novel in Malayalam.
