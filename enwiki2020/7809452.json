It has daily features, updates and links to news reports from The New York Times and the BBC. The 2010 edition of the Britannica was the last printed version and was sold until stock ran out in 2012. As of 2019, the price of an annual subscription is specified in their website as $74.95, or $1.44 per week. Roughly 60% of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannicas revenue comes from online operations, of which around 15% comes from subscriptions to the consumer version of the website. Subscriptions are available on a yearly, monthly or weekly basis. Special subscription plans are offered to schools, colleges and libraries; such institutional subscribers constitute an important part of Britannicas business. Beginning in early 2007, the Britannica makes articles freely available if they are hyperlinked from an external site. Non- subscribers are served pop-ups and advertising. On 3 June 2008, an initiative to facilitate collaboration between online expert and amateur scholarly contributors for Britannicas online content (in the spirit of a wiki), with editorial oversight from Britannica staff, was announced.Collaboration and the Voices of Experts Jorge Cauz, 3 June 2008 Approved contributions would be credited,Staff writer. \"Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica dips toe in Wiki waters\".
