    "text": "Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science is a book by Charles Wheelan that seeks to translate basic economic issues into a format that can be easily read by people with little or no previous knowledge of economics. The Chicago Tribune described the book as \"Translat[ing] the arcane and often inscrutable jargon of the professional economist into language accessible to the inquiring but frustrated layman.\" A fully revised and updated version of the book with a foreword by Burton Malkiel was published in 2010. It has been translated into eleven languages. ==References== Category:Economics books Category:2002 non- fiction books Category:W. W. Norton & Company books ",
