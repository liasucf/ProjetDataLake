    "text": "Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a secured interbank overnight interest rate and reference rate established as an alternative to Libor. ==History== Global regulators decided to move away from the London interbank offered rate (Libor) -- a vital part of the financial system given that it\u2019s linked to around $300 trillion of loans, derivatives and other instruments across various currencies -- after it was revealed in 2012 that banks around the world manipulated it. It also didn\u2019t help that volumes underlying the benchmark dried up. U.K. regulators set the deadline at 2021 for financial firms and investors to transition away from the Libor. In June 2017, US Federal Reserve Bank's Alternative Reference Rates Committee selected what's called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR as the preferred alternative to Libor. The committee has noted the stability of the repurchase market on which the rate is based. The New York Federal Reserve began publication of the rate in April 2018. In August 2018, Barclays became the first bank to issue commercial paper tied to the rate; selling some US $525 million of short-term debt. Previously, Fannie Mae issued $6 billion securities tied to SOFR in July of 2018. Again in October 2018, Fannie Mae issued a second $ 5 billion securities that was also similarly tied to SOFR. Nonetheless, weaning off the scandal-plagued Libor benchmark is a gigantic problem for global rates markets, one that increasingly looks too burdensome for a single replacement to handle in the U.S. In July 2019, the SEC and the President of the New York Federal Reserve John Williams called on banks to swiftly transition from Libor to its replacements, such as SOFR, instead of waiting until the 2021 deadline. If a smooth transition from Libor cannot take place, smaller banks may reduce lending and companies may be less capable of hedging interest rate risks. ==Technical features== SOFR is based on the Treasury repurchase market (repo), Treasuries loaned or borrowed overnight. SOFR uses data from overnight Treasury repo activity to calculate a rate published at approximately 8:00 a.m. New York time on the next business day by the US Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Unlike Libor, SOFR uses banks' actual borrowing costs rather than unverifiable estimates submitted by a panel of banks. However, it may still be vulnerable to manipulation. Banks can borrow and lend at biased rates in the wholesale funding market, which can lead them to profit in the much larger market for benchmark-indexed contracts. It was therefore suggested that the lending costs of individual banks be published to increase transparency and deter manipulation. The Bank for International Settlements, which serves as the bank for central banks, said in March that a one-size-fits-all alternative may be neither feasible nor desirable. Although SOFR solves the rigging problem, it doesn\u2019t help participants gauge how stressed global funding markets are. That means SOFR is likely to coexist with something else. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Reference rates Category:Interest rates ",
