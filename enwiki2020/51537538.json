It is considered \"the vanguard of cartography and graphic journalism in India\". KBK was founded in the early 1950s, and its founder Kul Bushan Kumar had a postgraduate degree in geography. Kumar noticed that newspapers and journals then often carried inaccurate geographic representations. He is said to have prepared detailed maps during the India- China War of 1962, leading editor M. Chalapathi Rau to write that only he \"could provide a correct picture of the war\". ==References== Category:News agencies based in India ",
