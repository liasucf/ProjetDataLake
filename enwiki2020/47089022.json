    "text": "Bel Canto is an opera by Peruvian composer Jimmy L\u00f3pez. Based on the 2001 novel of the same name by Ann Patchett, the work uses a libretto by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Nilo Cruz. The libretto is sung in Spanish, English, Japanese, Russian, German, French, Latin, Italian, and Quechua. It was commissioned by the Lyric Opera of Chicago as part of the Ren\u00e9e Fleming initiative. Sir Andrew Davis conducted, and director Kevin Newbury staged the work. The cast included Danielle de Niese as Roxane Coss, J\u2019Nai Bridges as Carmen, Jeongcheol Cha as Hosokawa, and Andrew Stenson as Gen. ==Performance history== ===Pre-production=== The opera underwent several revisions and rewrites as a result of numerous work sessions between composer Jimmy L\u00f3pez, librettist Nilo Cruz, director Kevin Newbury, conductor Sir Andrew Davis, and creative consultant Ren\u00e9e Fleming. A workshop took place on July 8\u201311, 2014 where four out of a total of six scenes were rehearsed with members of The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center. A select group of donors and members of the press were invited to attend the last day of the workshop on July 11, 2014. The creative team (this time with soprano Danielle de Niese, bass-baritone Jeongcheol Cha, and pianist Adam Nielsen) met for a final work session and workshop on December 7\u20139, 2014 at Opera America's National Opera Center. The tech rehearsals took place on the week of July 20, 2015 and the Lyric Opera Chorus began rehearsals in late July under the supervision of chorus master Michael Black. ===World premiere=== Bel Canto premiered in Chicago on December 7, 2015 at the Ardis Krainik Theatre of the Civic Opera House, home to the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Since its announcement on February 28, 2012 Bel Canto garnered increasing attention, and it became one of the most awaited world premieres of the 2015\u20132016 season. It was performed seven times: December 7, 10 and 12, 2015 and January 5, 8, 13 and 17, 2016.
