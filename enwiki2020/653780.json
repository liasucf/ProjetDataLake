    "text": "In computing, a normal number is a non-zero number in a floating-point representation which is within the balanced range supported by a given floating-point format: it is a floating point number that can be represented without leading zeros in its significand. The magnitude of the smallest normal number in a format is given by bemin, where b is the base (radix) of the format (usually 2 or 10) and emin depends on the size and layout of the format. Similarly, the magnitude of the largest normal number in a format is given by :bemax \u00d7 (b \u2212 b1\u2212p), where p is the precision of the format in digits and emax is (\u2212emin)+1. In the IEEE 754 binary and decimal formats, b, p, emin, and emax have the following values: {| class=\"wikitable\" | style=\"text-align: right;\" !Format!!b!!p!!emin!!emax |- |binary16||2||11||\u221214||15 |- |binary32||2||24||\u2212126||127 |- |binary64||2||53||\u22121022||1023 |- |binary128||2||113||\u221216382||16383 |- |decimal32||10||7||\u221295||96 |- |decimal64||10||16||\u2212383||384 |- |decimal128||10||34||\u22126143||6144 |} For example, in the smallest decimal format, the range of positive normal numbers is 10\u221295 through 9.999999 \u00d7 1096. Non-zero numbers smaller in magnitude than the smallest normal number are called denormal (or subnormal) numbers. Zero is neither normal nor subnormal. == See also == * Normalized number == References == Category:Computer arithmetic ",
