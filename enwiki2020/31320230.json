    "text": "Nicol\u00f2 Zen by Titian, 1560-1565, in Kingston Lacy Nicol\u00f2 Zen the younger (1515\u20131565) was a Venetian Senator. Nicol\u00f2 was the son of Caterino Zen, a prominent literary figure of the time. He was schooled in science and the humanities and became an accomplished hydraulic engineer. His political career started with securing the post of Savio agli ordini dell'arsenale (Special Commissioner for the Arsenal) at the age of 23, two years less than the minimum. He was able to purchase recognition of experience for 100 Ducats from the Council of Ten. Zen advocated a peaceful approach to the Ottoman Empire, but nevertheless Venice became involved in a war with them, 1537-1540.. This led to the defeat of the Venetians in the Battle of Preveza which took place on 28 September 1538. By the end of the war Venice had lost many of its island possessions in the eastern mediterranean. Zen then wrote his History of the War between Venice and the Turks which primarily consisted of an invective against those who had called for a war in which they had behaved so ingloriously. The text was not published but a manuscript of it was circulated in his household and survived and is now held by the Biblioteca Marciana. A portrait of Zen by Titian was discovered in Kingston Lacy in 2008. ==References== Category:1515 births Category:1565 deaths Category:Historians from the Republic of Venice Category:16th-century Italian people Category:Italian historians Category:People from Venice Category:Historians of Italy Nicolo Category:Republic of Venice politicians ",
