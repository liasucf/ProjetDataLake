He also played for Swansea Town. O'Driscoll was a dual international and played for both Ireland teams - the FAI XI and the IFA XI. ==Irish international== When O'Driscoll began his international career in 1948 there were, in effect, two Ireland teams, chosen by two rival associations. Both associations, the Northern Ireland-based IFA and the Ireland-based FAI claimed jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland and selected players from the whole island. As a result, several notable Irish players from this era, including O'Driscoll, played for both teams. ===IFA XI=== Between 1948 and 1949 O'Driscoll made 3 appearances for the IFA XI . On 9 October 1948 he made his international debut for the IFA XI in a 6-2 defeat against England. On 17 November 1948 he made his second appearance for the IFA XI in a 3-2 defeat against Scotland. He made his last appearance for the IFA XI against Wales on 9 March 1949 in a 2-0 defeat. ===FAI XI=== Between 1948 and 1949 O'Driscoll also made 3 appearances for the FAI XI. He won his first cap on 5 December 1948 in a 1-0 defeat in a friendly Switzerland at Dalymount Park. He also played for the FAI XI on 24 April 1949 in another friendly at Dalymount against Belgium. This time the FAI XI lost 2-0. He won his final FAI XI cap on 2 June 1949 a in 3-1 away defeat against Sweden, a qualifier for the 1950 FIFA World Cup. ==Honours== ==Player== Waterford *League of Ireland **Runners Up 1940\u201341: 1 *FAI Cup **Runners Up 1941: 1 Cork United *League of Ireland **Winners 1942\u201343, 1944\u201345, 1945\u201346 3 *FAI Cup **Winners 1947 1 **Runners Up 1943 1 *League of Ireland Shield **Winners 1943 1 *Munster Senior Cup **Winners 1945, 1946, 1947 3 Swansea Town *Third Division South **Winners 1948-49: 1 Llanelli *West Wales Senior Cup **Winners 1952-53: 1 == References == ==External links== *Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats *Ireland (FAI) stats Category:1921 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers Category:Pre-1950 IFA international footballers Category:Ireland (FAI) international footballers Category:Dual Irish international footballers Category:League of Ireland players Category:Swansea City A.F.C. players Category:Shelbourne F.C. players Category:Waterford F.C. players Category:Cork F.C. players Category:Cork United F.C.
