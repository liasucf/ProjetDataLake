D. Cribb Cairns, Australia Dr Cribb found himself and his broader projects (in Cape York) having to proceed without academic patronage or funding. From the early 1990s onwards Dr Cribb became increasingly disengaged from academic communities of scholars, tending to work instead within the grey (unpublished) fringes of more commercially driven (less 'pure') research projects and programs.CRIBB, R (2000) An Assessment of Comalco's Cultural Heritage Proposals.

Unpublished seminar presented as part of James Cook University's School of Anthropology and Archaeology Seminar Program.

Unpublished paper prepared for the Tharpuntoo Legal Service. Cairns, Australia. It might be said, Dr Cribb's most enduring professional contribution over a lifetime, was his work to counter all sense of 'terra nullius by recording large archaeological landscapes; facilitating archaeological heritage protection; and revealing forever the richness, density and vastness of some of the cultural landscapes still persisting in Anatolia (Turkey), and Cape York (Australia). ==Chronology of Works== Image of Anatolia * CRIBB, R (1974) Patterns of Racial Ideology: An Analysis in Terms of the Conflict Theory of Society.
