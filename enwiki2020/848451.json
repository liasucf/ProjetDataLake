    "text": "Feminine hygiene products are personal care products used during menstruation, vaginal discharge, and other bodily functions related to the vulva and vagina. Those products that are used during menstruation may also be called menstrual hygiene products. Products used may include sanitary napkins (American English) or sanitary towels (British English), tampons, pantyliners, menstrual cups, and period panties. Feminine hygiene products also include products meant to cleanse the vulva or vagina, such as douches, feminine wipes, and soap. Feminine hygiene products that are meant to cleanse may lead to allergic reaction and irritation, as the vagina naturally flushes out bacteria. Many health professionals advise against douching because it can change the balance of vaginal flora and acidity. Feminine hygiene products are either disposable or reusable. Sanitary napkins, tampons, and pantyliners are disposable feminine hygiene products. Menstrual cups, cloth menstrual pads, period panties, and sponges are reusable feminine hygiene products. ==Types== === Menstrual hygiene products === A sanitary napkin The elements of a tampon with applicator.

American Girl Publishing, 2012. ==Society and culture== In low-income countries, women's choices of menstrual hygiene materials are often limited by the costs, availability and social norms.UNESCO (2014). Puberty Education & Menstrual Hygiene Management - Good Policy and Practice in health Education - Booklet 9. United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, Paris, France, p. 32 ===Costs and tax=== Menstrual hygiene product dispenser Tampon tax is a shorthand for sales tax charged on tampons, pads, and menstrual cups. The cost of these commercial products for menstrual management is considered to be unacceptably high for many low-income women. At least half a million women across the world do not have enough money to adequately afford these products. This can result in missing school or even dropping out. In some jurisdictions similar necessities like medical devices and toilet paper are not taxed. Several initiatives worldwide advocate to eliminate the tax all together. In some countries, such petitions have already been successful (for example parts of the UK and the United States). ===Access to products in prisons=== The Federal bureau of Prisons in the United States announced that women in its facilities would be guaranteed free menstrual pads and tampons. In section 411 of the First Step Act which was passed on May 22, 2018 states, \"The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall make the healthcare products described in subsection (c) available to prisoners for free, in a quantity that is appropriate to the healthcare needs of each prisoner\". === Other social views === For those with autism, using pads before menstruation begins may help reduce sensory issues associated with menstrual hygiene products. Prior education and practice may help familiarize an individual with body changes and the process of using products associated with menstruation. Menstruation may occur despite paralyzation; product use depends on the individual's personal preference.Farrell, Kate, et al. Period: Twelve Voices Tell the Bloody Truth. Feiwel and Friends, an Imprint of Macmillan Publishing Group, LLC, 2018. Some girls and women may view tampons and menstrual cups as affecting their virginity even though they have not engaged in sexual intercourse. == History == === Historical types of menstrual hygiene products === * Cup * Pad * Panty * Sponges * Nothing * Sheep's wool * Underwear * Raw cotton * Sanitary belt & napkin holder * Crocheted sanitary napkins * Clouts * No belt * Baby diapers * Plants ==See also== *Menstrual hygiene management ==References== ==External links== * ",
