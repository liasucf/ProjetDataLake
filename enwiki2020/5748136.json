    "text": "The following is a list of episodes from the Filipino TV series Komiks, which airs on Saturday evenings on the ABS-CBN network in the Philippines. The first season of the series presented 12 distinct stories over the course of 13 episodes. One of the stories (Agua Bendita) had two parts. The second season likewise had 12 distinct stories but had 15 episodes, because three of the stories (Inday sa Balitaw, Bampy, and Si Pardina at mga Duwende) had two parts each. The third and fourth season of Komiks breaks from the pattern of the first two seasons, with the entire season devoted to a single story, Da Adventures of Pedro Penduko. Matt Evans of PBB Teen Edition stars in the title role. Matt Evans once again occupied the fifth season of Komiks, with a whole new adventure and characters. It is dubbed as Si Pedro Penduko at ang mga Engkantao. After the much successful airing of \"Pedro Penduko\" series, Komiks was shelved for a while to give way for 1 vs. 100. On April 2008, Komiks resumed airing for sixth season with the collection of Mars Ravelo's works, with Kapitan Boom as its initial offering. This was followed by Varga, Tiny Tony and Dragonna. Nasaan Ka Maruja? was the only Ravelo's masterpiece air for non-superheroes stories. ==Episodes== Mega Manila ratings are published by AGB Philippines in Abante Tonite. ===Season 1=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=#8E88B7 !
