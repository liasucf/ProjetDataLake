As a child he was inclined to favor the poor and he invited them home after mass.

He was tormented with the choice he made so tried to leave for his home but he decided against it so continued his studies. He was ordained as a priest at the age of 23 on 18 September 1886 and received papal dispensation due to his age which was before the required age. The Cardinal Archbishop of Turin Gaetano Alimonda. He - after this - joined an order that Cottolengo established.

Hundreds of people filed past his coffin during his funeral. ==Beatification== The beatification process commenced on 11 June 1947 in a local process in Turin that granted him the title Servant of God. The process gathered witness testimonies and documentation and concluded all of its work in 1958. The process was granted formal ratification in 1991 so that the cause was able to proceed to the next phase.
