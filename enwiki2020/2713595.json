    "text": "Bel-ibni was a Babylonian nobleman who served as King of Babylon for several years as the nominee of the Assyrian king Sennacherib.Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles, By Albert Kirk Grayson Sennacherib, believing that direct Assyrian rule was too costly, appointed Bel-ibni, a young Babylonian nobleman raised at the Assyrian court, King of Babylon in 703 BC. The experiment with a native puppet king was hardly more successful than direct Assyrian control. Soon Bel- ibni was conspiring with the Chaldeans and Elamites against the Assyrians. After defeating the opposing coalition in 700 BC, Sennacherib deposed Bel-ibni and carried him off to Assyrian exile, replacing him with Sennacherib's own son, Ashur-nadin-shumi.Jean-Jacques Glassner, Mesopotamian Chronicles, Atlanta, 2004, p. 197. ==References== Category:8th-century BC births Category:7th-century BC deaths Category:8th-century BC Babylonian kings Category:7th-century BC Babylonian kings Category:Babylonian kings Category:Year of birth unknown ",
