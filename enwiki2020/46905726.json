He is a professor at Yale University.Minsky's home page at Yale University He is known for having proved Thurston's ending lamination conjecture and as a pioneer in the study of curve complex geometry. ==Biography== Minsky obtained his Ph.D. from Princeton University in 1989 under the supervision of William Paul Thurston, with the thesis Harmonic Maps and Hyperbolic Geometry. His Ph.D. students include Jason Behrstock, Erica Klarreich, Hossein Namazi and Kasra Rafi. ==Honors and awards== He received a Sloan Fellowship in 1995.Alfred P.
