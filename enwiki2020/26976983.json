Much of her filmmaking is collaborative. She began her career in the context of a larger feminist movement in Italy of the 1970s. For her 1983 film Scuola senza fine (School without End), she put together a group of amateur women to make the film. The group of former housewives had completed a 150-hour secondary school diploma course in 1976 and did not want to stop learning after it ended. With the help of their teacher, they formed a study and research group. Monti shot the film about them from 1979\u20131981, with the first half of it being made collectively by the group. It was completed in 1983. In 1986, Monti made a documentary called Filo a catena about the conditions of female textile workers. Adriana Monti moved to Canada in 1996.
