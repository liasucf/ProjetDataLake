Also known as B\u00fcrgersaalkirche since the consecration of the altar on May 13, 1778, it is the prayer and meeting room of the Marian Men Congregation \"Annunciation\". It was built in 1709/1710 under design by Giovanni Antonio Viscardi. ==Architectur== The church is divided into an upper church on the upper floor and a lower church on the lower floor. The baroque fa\u00e7ade follows the construction inside, which is divided into an upper church and a lower church. Above the entrance stands a figure of the enthroned Madonna and Child. On the upper floor was the prayer room, which then already since 1778 has been used as a church. A masterpiece of the interior decoration is the sculpture of the Guardian Angel with child from Ignaz G\u00fcnther from 1763 and a relief of Andreas Faistenberger from 1710 from the former high altar which was destroyed in World War II. In the lower floor is the grave of Rupert Mayer. ==References== == External links == * Photo spread of B\u00fcrgersaalkirche / Citizen Hall Church Category:Roman Catholic churches in Munich Category:Baroque architecture in Munich Category:Baroque church buildings in Germany Category:Registered historic buildings and monuments in Bavaria Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1710 Category:1710 establishments in the Holy Roman Empire Category:Cultural heritage monuments in Munich ",
