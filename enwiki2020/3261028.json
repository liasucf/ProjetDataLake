Chandwani was born in a refugee camp in India to Sindhi parents who migrated from Pakistan after independence in 1947. Ashok Chandwani taught briefly at St Francis de Sales College, in Nagpur as a lecturer for English Literature at the B.A. undergraduate study program level in 1972, when he must have been about twenty two years of age, barely a little older than some of his students. He is remembered as an affable and competent teacher who was well regarded for his interesting and slightly non- conventional methodologies for teaching classic English poetry in his inimitable style. Ashok Chandwani immigrated to Canada from India in 1973 and in 1979, began working at The Montreal Gazette. He wrote a weekly Monday column for the newspaper based on his experiences as an immigrant. Ashok Chandwani was also an assistant management editor and restaurant critic. In 2002 he bought his own restaurant. Ashok Chandwani won several journalism awards, including a Media Human Rights Award with Glen Allen for a series on racism in Canada in 1982, and is the author of the book Buntys and Pinkies.
