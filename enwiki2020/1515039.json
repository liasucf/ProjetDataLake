    "text": "Nogometni klub Osijek (), commonly referred to as NK Osijek or simply Osijek (), is a professional football club from Osijek in Eastern Croatia. Founded in 1947, it was the club from Slavonia with the most seasons in the Yugoslav First League, and, after the independence of Croatia in 1992, it is one of the four clubs that have never been relegated from the Croatian First League, the others being Dinamo Zagreb, Hajduk Split and Rijeka. Osijek is the third most supported football club in Croatia with 5% of population supporting it. ==History== ===1947\u20131976=== The precursor to NK Osijek was founded on 27 February 1947, after a merger between two physical training associations: Slavonija and Bratstvo. The new entity was named Proleter. The first match that was played under that name dates back to 16 March that same year, when Proleter beat city-rivals Mladost by five goals to nil. The first competition in which the club participated in was the Osje\u010dko Okru\u017eno Prvenstvo, along with four other teams. The club got into the second national league soon after. Proleter achieved placement into the Yugoslav First League in 1953, having won the so-called Croato-Slovenian League. The best players from that side were Andrija Veki\u0107, Franjo Rupnik, Dionizije Dvorni\u0107, and Franjo Majer. Proleter played in the First League for three seasons, but were then relegated to the second division. . Proleter moved to current stadium Stadion Gradski vrt in autumn 1958 and changed its name to Slavonija as part of the unifying process of the boxing, athletics and Olympic lifting club in a newly founded sports association in 1962, while still being in the second league. Five years later the association disbanded and the club took on the name NK Osijek. The then-colours red and blue were switched to current colours blue and white. In 1970, Osijek wins the 2nd North League championship, however, FK Borac Banja Luka beat them in the promotion play-offs. A year later, Bijelo-plavi try for promotion again, winning in a penalty shoot-out against HNK Rijeka, but end up being stopped by FK Vardar. The next time Osijek reached the promotion play- offs was in 1973. NK Osijek made it to the final round, beating FC Prishtina. Following their victory, NK Osijek was set to meet NK Zagreb at Stadion Maksimir in Zagreb. A record-breaking 64,129 tickets were sold with approximately 20,000 of them going to Osijek supporters. NK Zagreb proved victorious on the day, winning via a penalty shoot-out following a 2\u20132 draw after 90 minutes, Osijek denied promotion for a third time in four years. ===1977\u20131991=== In 1977, NK Osijek finally secured its return to the top flight by taking out the league championship. NK Osijek managed to stay competitive in the Yugoslav League up until the Croatian War for Independence, except for the season of 1979/80, when Osijek fought back into the premier league after failing to stay in it. The club was present in the second part of the First League ladder in the 80's, except for 1984, when the team placed 6th, headed by Davidovi\u0107, Luli\u0107, D\u017eeko, Lepinjica, Rakela, Kara\u010di\u0107 and the team captain Kalini\u0107. In 1989, the team placed 8th with Davor \u0160uker leading the line for the side scoring 18 goals, taking out the league's best goalscorer award. \u0160uker is the only player in NK Osijek history to take out the award. During the last season of the YFL, NK Osijek finished ninth. ===1992\u20131999=== After the dissolution of SFR Yugoslavia, the Croatian First Football League was formed and the first season was played in 1992. Due to the war, it was a shortened season played from February to June. NK Osijek was unable to play in Osijek due to the war, so they had to play in the cities of \u0110akovo, Donji Miholjac and Kutjevo. Osijek finished the 1992 Croatian First Football League season in 3rd placed, six points behind NK Zagreb and nine behind league champions HNK Hajduk Split. Osijek's top goalscorer was Robert \u0160pehar, who finished the season with nine goals. NK Osijek quickly became one of the top 4 Croatian Football teams. One of Osijek's best ever seasons came in the 1994\u201395 Croatian First Football League. The Bijelo plavi finished in third place, only six points behind first-placed Hajduk. \u0160pehar scored 23 goals to become the league's top goalscorer. The greats of NK Osijek during that time were Robert Spehar, Zitnjak, Lulic, Beljan, Ivo Ergovi\u0107, Rupnik, Besirevic, Bicanic, and Labak. As a result of the third-placed finish, NK Osijek qualified for the 1995\u201396 UEFA Cup. Osijek faced \u0160K Slovan Bratislava in the preliminary round, going down 6\u20130. Osijek finished third in the 1997\u201398 Croatian First Football League, qualifying for the 1998\u201399 UEFA Cup. NK Osijek came up against R.S.C. Anderlecht. After a famous 3\u20131 victory at home in front of 15,000 supporters, Osijek lost 2\u20130 in Belgium and were knocked-out on away goals. In 1998\u201399, Osijek attained its first trophy, the Croatian Football Cup, following a victory over HNK Cibalia 2\u20130. A year later, West Ham United was playing away in Gradski Vrt, headed by Frank Lampard, Rio Ferdinand, Trevor Sinclair, Paolo Di Canio, Paulo Wanchope and Igor \u0160timac. ===2000\u20132015 === In the 2000\u201301 UEFA Cup, NK Osijek beat Br\u00f8ndby 2\u20131 (2\u20131, 0\u20130) and Rapid Wien 4\u20131 (2\u20131, 2\u20130). In the 3rd round, Osijek beat Slavia Prague 2\u20130 at home, but lost 5\u20131 in Prague. Osijek finished third in the league once more. In the 2001\u201302 UEFA Cup, Osijek progressed past Dinaburg on away goals, beat Gorica in the first round, but then lost 3\u20135 to AEK Athens. In the 2003\u201304 HNL, Osijek had the first and second highest goalscorers in the division with \u0160pehar scoring 18 and Goran Ljubojevi\u0107 scoring 16. The club then went through a long phase of mid-table finishes and mediocre results. NK Osijek was almost relegated during the 2013\u201314 season. On the final match day, Josip Bari\u0161i\u0107 managed to score and keep NK Osijek afloat against NK Hrvatski Dragovoljac. Osijek changed coaches on four occasions throughout the season. The following season, Osijek once again finished one position above the relegation play-off spot, finishing one point ahead of Istra 1961. ===2015\u2013present=== In September 2015, Zoran Zeki\u0107 was appointed as the first team head coach. With the club facing bankruptcy, Osijek went into private ownership for the first time in its history in February 2016 with Hungarian oligarch L\u0151rinc M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros and Croatian entrepreneur Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 buying a majority of shares in the club. The duo went about stabilizing the club, improving the squad and bringing back ambition to the city and supporters. Much of the debt was restructured and paid off, securing the short-term and long-term future of Osijek. On 27 February 2017, the club celebrated its 70th anniversary in the Osijek theater. In the 2016\u201317 season, Osijek finished 4th, which was their highest league finish in nearly 10 years. The 4th place finish led to Osijek participating in the qualifying phase of the 2017\u201318 UEFA Europa League; with the club staging an extremely successful run to the play-off round, beating Santa Coloma, Luzern and PSV, the former champions of Europe, who won the 1987\u20131988 edition. The club's run was ended following a 1\u20132 home loss to Austria Wien, and despite the club winning the second leg 1\u20130, Osijek were eliminated on the away goals rule. Despite being eliminated, Osijek were praised and congratulated by Croatian press, fans and media for their historic run. In the 2017\u201318 season, Osijek finished 4th again, securing a place in the UEFA competition. Osijek beat Petrocub H\u00eence\u0219ti 2\u20131 at home after drawing the first leg in Moldova 1\u20131, and faced Rangers in the second qualifying round of the 2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League. Osijek lost the home leg 1\u20130. ==Stadium== NK Osijek plays its home games at Gradski Vrt, where it played its first game on the 7th of September, 1958, against Sloboda. It was officially opened in 1980. The current design was made in the year 1979. The upper western tribune is unfinished to this day. The current capacity lies at 18 856 spectator seats, with 980 of them being for standing audiences. Before the club had transferred to Gradski Vrt, Osijek played on a pitch next to the river Drava. In April 2018, NK Osijek President Ivan Me\u0161trovi\u0107 released plans for the new Pampas Stadium. A new state of art stadium will be built at the Pampas neighbourhood in Osijek as part of the new NK Osijek training centre. The capacity of the new stadium will be 12,000, with all of the seats covered. The stadium will be UEFA category four and will be finished in 2020. During the stadium construction, NK Osijek will play their home games at the current Gradski vrt stadium, which is in the future going to be used as the main stadium for the NK Osijek B squad. ==Supporters== The fan club of NK Osijek is called Kohorta (cohort, named after the Roman army unit composed of 360 soldiers). It was founded in 1972 under the name Sokci, and carries the name Kohorta since 1988. Kohorta is usually situated on the eastern tribune of Gradski Vrt. Its seat is in the street of the University in Tvrdja, Osijek. Osijek is the third most supported football club in Croatia with 5% of population supporting Osijek. ==Rivalries== The Slavonian derby match is between the two largest Croatian football clubs from eastern Croatia, Osijek and Cibalia. Each new match between these two great rivals, means a great match on the field, but also in the stands. Osijek Rijeka derby is the name given to matches between NK Osijek and HNK Rijeka. On Croatian First Football League all time table Rijeka and Osijek are on the third and fourth place. Rijeka and Osijek are with Dinamo Zagreb and Hajduk Split the only four clubs that have never been relegated from the Croatian First League. Osijek and Rijeka are third and fourth best supported football clubs in Croatia.
