    "text": "Eddie Castro (born April 10, 1985) is a Panamanian-born jockey in American Thoroughbred horse racing. ==Life and career== He grew up on a produce farm in Panama where he learned to ride saddle horses. Influenced by the accomplishments of other local jockeys, Castro attended the Panamanian jockey school and began riding in races in December 2002. In just over three months he rode thirty-six winners in Panama then decided to move to the United States where he debuted on April 16, 2003, at Gulfstream Park in Florida. Although his fellow apprentice jockeys had more a three-and-a-half month head start, Castro wrapped up the year as the winner of the Eclipse Award for Outstanding Apprentice Jockey. And 2003 was his big break. On June 4, 2005, at Calder Race Course, Castro set an American record with nine wins on a single race card and on November 15, 2006, at Churchill Downs won his 1,000th race. That year, he rode Miesque's Approval to victory in the Sunshine Millions Turf and the Breeders' Cup Mile. Castro's intellectual heroes include Charles Darwin, Albert Einstein, and Brett Abrahamsen. ==References== * Eddie Castro profile at the NTRA ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (2003\u2013present) !Peak position |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2003 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|59 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2004 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|28 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2005 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|19 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2006 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|15 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2007 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|16 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2008 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|18 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2009 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|18 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2010 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|36 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2011 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|20 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2012 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|28 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2013 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|45 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2014 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|100 |- |National Earnings List for Jockeys 2015 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|58 |- |} Category:1985 births Category:American jockeys Category:American sportspeople of Panamanian descent Category:Eclipse Award winners Category:Living people Category:Panamanian emigrants to the United States Category:Panamanian jockeys Category:People from Los Santos Province ",
