He discusses possible cooperation with Africa in combating climate change as well mitigating the refugee streams to Europe. He led the research project Welfare, Wealth and Work for Europe from 2012 to 2016.The research work leading to these results were supported pursuant to the financial aid agreement no. 290647 in the course of the Seventh Framework Programme for Research of the European Union FP7/2007-2013. This is the largest socio-economic project in the European Union's Seventh Framework Programme for Research. It was funded by the European Union and coordinated by the Austrian Institute of Economic Research. It was a key academic project accompanying the European Union's Europe 2020 strategy the EU's growth strategy for the coming decade. In a changing world, the EU wants to become a smart, sustainable and inclusive economy. and extending it beyond, providing a basis for a more dynamic, green and socially- oriented society.See website of the Europe 2020 strategy for further details. The closing report and the executive summary were presented in Brussels in February 2016 to the European Parliament, the European Commission and the media in a final conference at which Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University held the welcoming address. A white paper was prepared under his leadership in 2006 on Austrian economic policy entitled \"More employment through growth on the basis of innovation and qualification\", which had a major influence on Austrian economic policy.. In industrial policy, Aiginger advocates the concept of a systemic industrial policy which cooperates with innovation policy, labor market and competition policy with the final goal of serving societal needs. If it is designed strategically, a \"green industrial policy\" must not reduce price competitiveness but should actually create a competitive advantage. This issue is explored in depth in a special volume of the Journal of Industry, Competition and Trade. Higher costs for energy or emission at an industrial location should be offset by lower taxes on labor and a better supply of research resources, universities and technical colleges. In this way, a country gains competitive advantages that are important for the future, it becomes a technological leader in renewable energies and energy efficiency, and saves costs associated with making up for environmental damage. It is a main message of Aiginger's work not to equate competitiveness with low costs or to measure it using the external balance, but to measure it by outcomes, specifically defining competitiveness as the \"ability to deliver Beyond GDP goals\". Industrialized countries must follow a strategy based on quality. A cost strategy can be copied by low-income countries at any time (the \"high road strategy vs. the low road strategy\"). The broad definition of competitiveness was also recently adopted by the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) \\- A consultative body of the European Union in which the trade unions originally wanted to reject the new \"national committees for competitiveness\" because they feared an overly restrictive, cost-cutting policy. Following a change in the definition of competitiveness in the direction of fulfilling targets that go \"beyond GDP\", as proposed by Aiginger and WWWforEurope, \\- A Seventh Framework Programme for Research project funded by the EU the EESC was able to approve the creation of new commissions. Karl Aiginger continues to work on European issues in the Policy Crossover Center, Vienna-Europa and at the Vienna University of Economics and Business from an increasingly interdisciplinary standpoint. ==References== ==External links== * homepage of Karl Aiginger hosted at WIFO * Karl Aiginger at the Austrian Institute of Economic Research * Karl Aiginger at the Vienna University of Economics and Business * Karl Aiginger at the Johannes Kepler University Linz * Karl Aiginger at IDEAS / Research Papers in Economics Category:Living people Category:1948 births Category:20th-century economists Category:Austrian economists Category:Austrian business theorists Category:Austrian male writers ",
