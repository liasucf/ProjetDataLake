First, however, they would have to get through the imminent collapse of the Intercollegiate Hockey Association, with both Yale and Columbia having withdrawn. The team opened with a win over MIT, their first in 21 months. They followed that up with a 2\u20133 loss to Princeton, but after having been embarrassed the year before the result was very encouraging. Dartmouth played only one more game the remainder of January and the rust showed in their loss to Harvard. Afterwards, however, the Greens recovered with six consecutive wins over a short span of time. Dartmouth finished with a winning record for the first time in four years and their only losses came against the two best teams in the country. Note: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season \u2020 Mass Ag. only list one game against Dartmouth with the score being 3\u20135 against.
