    "text": "Asaka High School in winter , abbreviated as , is the regionally prestigious prefectural high school in Koriyama city, Fukushima, Japan. It was founded on September 11, 1884, originally as Fukushima Junior High School. After being renamed Asaka Junior High School in 1948, it was changed into a high school due to the restructure of the Japanese education system on April 1, 1948. ==History== Asaka High School was a boys' school for a long time, but has recently become coeducational. Simultaneously, it abolished its rule mandating school uniforms. The old building, which had been formerly used as the main building of former Fukushima ordinary junior high school , is conserved in the front of its site, as the Asaka history museum. It was designated a cultural heritage site in 1977. The museum was deemed unsafe to enter after the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. Asaka High School has promoted the themes \"Frontier Spirit\", \"Literary and Military arts\", and \"Spartan\". It has a rivalry with Fukushima High School and Iwaki High School. ==Notable alumni== * Hiroyuki Arai * Kwan-Ichi Asakawa * K\u014dichir\u014d Gemba * Toru Iwaya * Masao Kume * Nakayama Gishu * Teruhiko Mashiko * Takumi Nemoto *Eisaku Sat\u014d (governor) * Shinzo Shinjo * Takayama Chogy\u016b * Toshio Tamogami * Joji Yuasa == References == ==External links== * Official Asaka High School homepage Category:Educational institutions established in 1884 Category:High schools in Japan Category:Education in Fukushima Prefecture ",
