It connects to the Vistula via the Biebrza, the Narew and the Bug River. The Netta's main tributaries are the Szczeberka, Kolniczanka, Olszanka and Tur\u00f3wka. The Netta begins its course in August\u00f3w, where it flows out of Lake Necko and southwards through the town. At Bia\u0142obrzegi it joins the Tur\u00f3wka and continues southwards, flowing through the districts of Gmina August\u00f3w and Gmina Sztabin.
