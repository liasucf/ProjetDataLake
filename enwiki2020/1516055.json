    "text": "In the United Kingdom, the Co-ordinated On-line Record of Electors (CORE), previously the Co-ordinated On-line Register of Electors, is a central database which Government have proposed will enable authorised users a single access point to existing information stored on local electoral registers. CORE will not replace local registers, but will mirror exactly the information contained at the local level for easy access. The legislative framework for CORE is contained in the Electoral Administration Act 2006, passed by Parliament on 11 July 2006. ==See also== *Elections in the United Kingdom *Voter registration ==External links== *CORE consultation paper, pdf * Electoral Administration Bill (in progress) * Electoral Administration Bill * Information on the Electoral Administration Act 2006 Category:Government databases in the United Kingdom Category:Politics of the United Kingdom ",
