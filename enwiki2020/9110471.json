    "text": "Gustaw Morcinek (born Augustyn Morcinek; 25 August 1891 in Karvin\u00e1, Austria- Hungary - 20 December 1963 in Krak\u00f3w, Poland) was a Polish writer, educator and later member of Sejm from 1952 to 1957. He is considered one of the most important writers from Silesia.Hierowski 1947, 97. ==Biography== In 1891, Morcinek was born in Karvin\u00e1 into a poor family, the youngest of four siblings. In 1892, his father J\u00f3zef died and his mother was forced to provide for the family. Augustyn started work in the coal mine at the age of 16, which was quite late compared to the standard of those times. When he was 19, miners raised money for his education and he started attending a teachers' seminary in Bia\u0142a Krakowska, from which he graduated in 1914. In 1914 he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and after 1918 served briefly in the Polish Army. In 1920, when Cieszyn Silesia was divided between Poland and Czechoslovakia, his hometown Karvin\u00e1 fell to Czechoslovakia. Morcinek was a pro-Polish activist and thus decided to stay in Poland. In the 1920s and 1930s he worked as a teacher in Skocz\u00f3w. ===Interwar period=== During the interwar period, Morcinek published many articles in various Silesian press. He wrote his most important books in the late 1920s and early 1930s becoming the only notable Silesian Polish-language prosaist of the interwar period. His works concentrate mostly on coal mining and Silesian themes. Morcinek shows miners' work and life in a realistic way and accentuates the class character of national oppression of Polish miners.Hierowski 1947, 81. Morcinek spent the years 1936-1939 abroad, in Western Europe. ===World War II=== He returned to Poland shortly before the outbreak of World War II. Morcinek was arrested by the Gestapo on 6 September 1939. He was initially imprisoned with W\u0142adys\u0142aw Dworaczek and the rest of people belonging to the Polish intellectuals from Silesia. Gustaw spent the whole war in the German concentration camps Skrochowitz,Village of Skrochovice is a part of the Brumovice municipality near Opava, Silesia, Czech Republic. During the war it was a part of Germany. Sachsenhausen and Dachau.Hierowski 1947, 193. The supposed reason given for his arrest was his \"anti-German activity\" before the war and the fact that a dog in one of his novels (\"Wyr\u0105bany chodnik\") was called \"Bismarck\". When he was in concentration camps, he was given a choice to sign a Volksliste but refused.A Volksliste was a document introduced by the Nazi authorities; a non- German citizen declared that he had some German ancestry by signing it. Refusal to sign this document could lead to deportation to a concentration camp. Non-German citizens from territories belonging to Nazi Germany were forced to sign it. ===After the war=== Monument to Gustaw Morcinek in Skocz\u00f3w Since his release until November 1946 Morcinek resided in France, Italy and Belgium and cooperated with Polish \u00e9migr\u00e9 press there.Hierowski 1947, 79-80. He then returned to Silesia, Poland, and settled in Katowice. He was then actively supported by new authorities. Morcinek resumed his writing and continued to concentrate on Silesian issues but widen his scope to books for children and also epistolography. He received many recognitions and literary awards for his work and many of his books were translated and published abroad. Gustaw Morcinek died of leukemia on 20 December 1963 in Krak\u00f3w and was later buried at Communal Cemetery in Cieszyn. ==Political activity== Morcinek was politically active from a young age. He was an active advocate of joining whole Cieszyn Silesia to Poland. During the interwar period when he was an anti-German activist, some critics accused him of spreading hatred. After the war, he was a supporter of Polish United Workers' Party and was a member of the Sejm (parliament) from Katowice electoral district (1952\u20131957). ==Works== ===Novellas and novellas collections=== * Noc listopadowa (1927) * W kwietniow\u0105 noc (1928) * Zgaszony p\u0142omyk (1928) * O te \u015bwi\u0119t\u0105 ziemeczk\u0119 (1929) * Serce za tam\u0105 (1929) * Cisza (1930) * Mi\u00f3d w sercu (1930) * Chleb na kamieniu (1931) * Na bieda-szybie (1932) * Sze\u015b\u0107 dni (1932) * Dzieje w\u0119gla (1933) * Kataryniarz (1933) * W zadymionym s\u0142o\u0144cu (1933) * U\u015bmiech na drodze (1935) * Go\u0142\u0119bie na dachu (1936) * Po kamienistej drodze (1936) * W najm\u0142odszym lesie (1937) * Maszerowa (1938) * Miasteczko nad rzek\u0105 (1938) * Kr\u00f3lewski d\u0142ug (1939) ===Short story collections=== * Byli dwaj bracia (1930) * Wyr\u0105bany chodnik (1931\u201332) * In\u017cynier Szeruda (1937) * Wyorane kamienie (1939) * Dziewczyna z P\u00f3l Elizejskich (1946) * Listy z mojego Rzymu (1946) * Wr\u00f3\u017cbita (1946) * Dwie korony (1948) * Zagubione klucze (1948) * Pod gongiem (1949) * Pok\u0142ad Joanny (1951) * W Nysie na rynku (1952) * Odkryte skarby (1953) * Ondraszek (1953) * W Wiergulowej dziedzinie (1953) * Viktoria (1954) * Wskrzeszenie Herminy (1956) * Z mojej ziemi (publicystyka) (1956) * Judasz u Monte Sicuro (1957) * Czarna Julka (1959) * Siedem zegark\u00f3w kopido\u0142a Joachima Rybki (1960) * Opowie\u015bci o ludziach z poci\u0105gu (1963) * G\u00f3rniczy zakon (1964) ===Fairy tales collections=== * Jak g\u00f3rnik Bulandra diab\u0142a oszuka\u0142 (1961) * Przedziwne \u015bl\u0105skie powiarki (1961) * Przedziwna historia o zb\u00f3jniku Ondraszku (1963) ===Books for children=== * Narodziny serca (1932) * Gwiazdy w studni (1933) * \u0141ysek z pokladu Idy (1933) * Ludzie s\u0105 dobrzy (1935) * Miasteczko nad rzek\u0105 (1938) ===Other works=== * \u015al\u0105sk (1933) * Listy spod morwy (1945) * Listy spod morwy (1946) * Zab\u0142\u0105kane ptaki * Urodzaj ludzi * Ziemia cieszy\u0144ska ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * Category:1891 births Category:1963 deaths Category:People from Karvin\u00e1 Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Polish Austro-Hungarians Category:Polish military personnel Category:Polish male writers Category:Polish educators Category:Polish communists Category:Polish people from Zaolzie Category:Recipients of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Deaths from leukemia Category:Deaths from cancer in Poland Category:Sachsenhausen concentration camp survivors Category:Dachau concentration camp survivors Category:Members of the Polish Sejm 1952\u20131956 ",
