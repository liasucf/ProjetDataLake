It is a private member's club south-west of Great Yarmouth and north-west of Lowestoft on the Norfolk-Suffolk border close to windmills of The Broads National Park.Somerleyton.co.uk | Fritton Lake Activities in Suffolk, UK website of the owning group, related to Lord Somerleyton seated at nearby Somerleyton Hall. ==Past uses== The lake may be pre-medieval but was largely dug in medieval times to extract peat for burning. It came into use as a duck decoy, a site designed for the large-scale hunting of waterfowl. Artificial water channels covered with net-tunnels were constructed around the lake. Ducks would be encouraged to swim down the channels using dogs or food and would be trapped on reaching the end. At one point, 21 such channels were in operation around the lake, four remained in operation in 1918. During World War 2, a secret training facility was located at Fritton Lake. Its purpose was to train tank crews of DD tanks \u2013 amphibious versions of British Valentine Tanks and American-made Sherman tanks. Between April 1943 and May 1944 British, American, and Canadian units came to Fritton Lake to be trained in the use of these tanks. One tank that sank during training remains in the lake. The site remained in military use into the early 1950s as part of the Specialised Armoured Development Establishment,Public Record Office, Kew WO 341/184 during which further amphibious experiments and trials were undertaken. The waterline was raised in 1954 by the building up of a weir.http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/2003/198.html ==Current uses and amenity== Nearby pub, the Decoy Tavern Adjoining are a range of attractions: *The Fritton Arms, a large pub with outdoor areas *Fritton Lake Outdoor Centre *Lakeside Riding Stables for horse and pony riding *Fritton Lake Woodland Lodges. ;Admittance A Pay and Display Car Park is adjacent to the Fritton Arms.
