    "text": "Baie James The Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9nergie de la Baie James is the company in charge of building the hydroelectric development known as the James Bay Project in northern Quebec. It was established in December 1971 by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de la Baie James (SDBJ), a Crown corporation of the province of Quebec and became a wholly owned subsididiary of Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec in 1978. == Origins == In the summer of 1971, the National Assembly of Quebec passed Bill 50, an Act establishing the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de d\u00e9veloppement de la Baie James (SDBJ), a Crown corporation tasked with the development of natural resources as well as the general administration of the James Bay territory. The development of the hydroelectric potential was the focus of a newly created subsidiary (the SEBJ) with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec as a majority shareholder along with the SDBJ. Both corporations would be chaired by Pierre A. Nadeau, an insurance executive recruited by Robert Bourassa's money man, Paul Desrochers. The passage of Bill 50 was controversial with Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec's top executives, who felt the government tried to bypass the powerful utility. As the party picking up the bill, Hydro wanted control over the development of the hydroelectric project. Commissioner Robert A. Boyd, who was slated as the top Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec executive and Nadeau's right-hand man at the SEBJ, first declined the appointment, explaining that with no background in public works, Nadeau would have little credibility with the engineers running the operations. Conflict soon erupted between Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec and Nadeau, who left less than a year after his appointment. He was replaced by Boyd, who kept informed of the latest development on the project by consulting with colleagues on the board on a daily basis. == See also == * James Bay Project * Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec ==References== === Further reading === * * * * * == External links == * Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9nergie de la Baie James - Official Web site Category:1971 establishments in Quebec Category:Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Category:Bechtel Category:James Bay Project Category:Canadian companies established in 1971 Category:Organizations based in Montreal ",
