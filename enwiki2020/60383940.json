A large number of his works in Berlin, Saint Petersburg and Budapest were destroyed during World War II.. Only twenty of his works are known to exist. These may seen at (among others) the , the National Museum, Warsaw and the Mus\u00e9e Fabre in Montpellier. He was a follower of Willem Buytewech and Aelbert Cuyp and was influenced by Adriaen van de Venne. In turn, he influenced Philips Angel I. Some of his still-lifes were attributed to Frans Hals the Younger, due to a mistaken interpretation of his convoluted monogram. In fact, no works by Hals have been identified with any certainty. Among his pupils were Laurens Bernards (c.1630-1676) and, possibly, Willem Kalf. ==References== ==External links== * More works by Rijckhals @ ArtNet Category:1609 births Category:1647 deaths Category:Dutch painters Category:Dutch genre painters Category:Dutch still life painters ",
