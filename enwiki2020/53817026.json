Filmed in Toronto, Montreal, and New York City, the series chronicles the lives of three millennial women, portrayed by Katie Stevens, Aisha Dee, and Meghann Fahy, all of whom are employed at a fictional global publication called Scarlet in New York City. While the pilot episode was aired in a special preview on June 20, 2017, the series officially premiered on Freeform on July 11, commencing a first season consisting of ten episodes. After receiving a two-season renewal, the series premiered its second and third seasons in June 2018 and April 2019, respectively. The fourth season premiered on January 23, 2020, with its episode order being cut from eighteen to sixteen episodes following the shutdown of production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It also broadcasts internationally on various networks and streaming platforms. To date, every season of the series has continued to receive positive reviews from television critics, including those writing for Vanity Fair, Vox, Variety, and The Atlantic. ==Series synopsis== The series centers on a trio of millennial women\u2014Jane Sloan (Katie Stevens), Kat Edison (Aisha Dee), and Sutton Brady (Meghann Fahy)\u2014living in New York City. The three best friends work for Scarlet, a fictional global women's magazine, spearheaded by its editor-in- chief, Jacqueline Carlyle (Melora Hardin). The young women navigate their lives in the big city, including their career trajectories and romantic relationships. Jane begins the series as a new writer for the magazine after working as an assistant, struggling to find her writing voice. Sutton is in a secret romantic relationship with Richard Hunter (Sam Page), a Scarlet board member and attorney for the magazine's publishing firm; she also realizes that she is ready for a change in her career and attains a fashion assistant position for the magazine under department head Oliver Grayson (Stephen Conrad Moore). Secure in her position as Scarlets social media director, Kat meets photographer Adena El-Amin (Nikohl Boosheri) and starts to explore her sexuality, including the tribulations that said exploration brings. Season two of The Bold Type follows Jane as she continues to find her journalistic voice in a new media-driven landscape, Kat and her struggle with her racial and sexual identity in addition to her relationship with Adena, and Sutton in the aftermath of her decision to end her relationship with Richard due to the realization that it could hinder her from advancing in her career. The third season sees Jane entering a new relationship with a fellow writer named Ryan (Dan Jeannotte) and collaborating with Jacqueline on a story regarding the abuse of models at the hands of a prominent photographer. Kat, in a career shift, becomes inspired to run for city council, supported by her campaign manager Tia (Alexis Floyd), with whom she also becomes romantically involved. Surprised by Adena's return during her campaign, Kat ponders whether her past relationship with Adena is unfinished. Sutton, while content in her role as a fashion assistant, considers pursuing a career as a fashion designer while navigating her rekindled\u2014and newly public\u2014relationship with Richard. ==Cast and characters== ===Main=== * Katie Stevens as Jane Sloan, a writer at Scarlet magazine * Aisha Dee as Kat Edison, former social media director at Scarlet magazine * Meghann Fahy as Sutton Brady-Hunter, a fashion stylist at Scarlet magazine * Sam Page as Richard Hunter, a Scarlet magazine board member, general counsel for Safford Publishing which owns the magazine, and Sutton's Husband. * Matt Ward as Alex Crawford, a writer at Scarlet magazine * Melora Hardin as Jacqueline Carlyle, editor-in-chief of Scarlet magazine * Stephen Conrad Moore as Oliver Grayson (season 2\u2013present; recurring, season 1), head of Scarlet magazine's fashion department * Nikohl Boosheri as Adena El-Amin (season 2; recurring, seasons 1, 3\u2013present), a photographer, and Kat's love interest ===Recurring=== * Emily C.

Caroline Framke of Vox commended the characterization of the three lead characters, highlighting that they are \"struggling with more down- to-earth, complex issues than the genre that inspired them ever made room to take on,\" while Sonia Saraiya of Variety opines that the relationship between the trio \"is neither saccharine nor unbelievable.\" Writing for Vulture, Matt Zoller Seitz praised The Bold Types ability to balance its visuals and narrative standpoint, namely the series' \"young, gorgeous, impeccably dressed core cast,\" its \"Carrie Bradshaw daydream-vision of what it means to be a New York journalist,\" and how the series \"respects journalism as work, in a way that more outwardly 'serious' narratives about the profession sometimes don't.\" Laura Bradley of Vanity Fair complimented the series' tone, specifically \"Freeform's interpretation of 'boldness'\u2014the feel-good, aspirational, Pinterest-friendly kind,\" and how said tone is \"more than O.K.; it's necessary.\" Vulture's Seitz continued to praise the series' \"knack for balancing youth-focused melodrama and detailed explorations of journalistic conundrums\" during its second season and credited the creators of the series for its realistic appeal and for \"grounding the story in lived reality, not just secondhand research.\" Conversely, in a column on The New Republic, Rachel Syme criticized the unrealistic nature of the show, asserting that the series \"needs to depict the difficult, ugly side of this business, as well as the cocktail parties and the blow-outs.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, the second season holds an approval rating of 100%, with an average rating of 8.76/10 based on 30 reviews. The website's consensus reads, \"The Bold Type presents an aspirational yet refreshingly realistic portrait of young women's careers, friendships and love lives in a big city.\" In a positive review of the first episode of the third season, Hannah Giorgis of The Atlantic echoed Seitz' sentiments regarding the series' realistic appeal and further expressed that the series, with its \"earnest story lines and thoughtful touches, remains a delight to watch.\" In a mixed review for Forbes, Linda Maleh questioned the trajectory of the series due to the story's tendency to regress and concluded that when it \"makes these big leaps forward and then takes them back, it diminishes its power.\" She added that she hoped the regression \"doesn't become a trend for this otherwise wonderful show.\" The third season received a 100% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 8/10 based on 9 reviews. ===Ratings=== ====Season 1==== ====Season 2==== ====Season 3==== ====Season 4==== ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
