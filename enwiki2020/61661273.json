    "text": "The C\u00f3rdoba\u2013M\u00e1laga railway is an Iberian-gauge railway line in Spain. It branches from the Alc\u00e1zar de San Juan\u2013C\u00e1diz railway at C\u00f3rdoba and terminates at M\u00e1laga Mar\u00eda Zambrano. It was once the only line linking Madrid to M\u00e1laga, but now primarily serves local commuter rail services and regional traffic since the opening of the Madrid\u2013M\u00e1laga high-speed rail line in 2013. ==Services== The line is used by Cercan\u00edas M\u00e1laga's C-1 service as far as \u00c1lora, and regional services from M\u00e1laga to Ronda via Bobadilla. Since 2013, due to the opening of the AVE high-speed rail line in 2007, the section between C\u00f3rdoba and Bobadilla closed to passenger service and is used only by freight trains. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Spain Category:Railway lines opened in 1865 Category:Iberian gauge railways ",
