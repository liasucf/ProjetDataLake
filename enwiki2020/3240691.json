    "text": "Jonathan Osei-Kuffour (born 17 November 1981), known as Jo Kuffour, is a former professional footballer. ==Club career== Born in Edmonton, Greater London, and after secondary school at St Ignatius' College, Enfield, he joined Arsenal as a trainee, winning the FA Youth Cup in 2000. He failed to break into the first team at Highbury and was allowed to join Swindon Town on loan in August 2001. His league debut came on 25 August as a substitute as Swindon lost 2\u20130 at home to Oldham Athletic. He left Arsenal at the end of the 2001\u201302 season and joined Torquay United, initially on non-contract terms, in October 2002, signing a contract in December 2002. His Torquay debut came as a substitute in the 4\u20131 home defeat to Hull City. He quickly became a regular in Leroy Rosenior's side, scoring 10 times in the 2003\u201304 side that won automatic promotion to the third tier of English football. He remained with Torquay, until 16 June 2006 when he joined Brentford on a free transfer, linking up again with Leroy Rosenior, despite having agreed to sign a new contract with Torquay earlier that month. Kuffour's club form was rewarded with a call-up to the Ghana squad for the game against Nigeria on 6 February 2006. He was one of the few shining lights in a disastrous 2006\u201307 season for Brentford, top- scoring with 14 goals despite the team finishing bottom of the table. Kuffor went on to win Brentford's Player of the Year Award at the season's end. Kuffour signed for Bournemouth on 19 June 2007 on a Bosman free transfer, after rejecting a new contract offer from Brentford that would have made him the best paid player at the club. It was also revealed that he rejected a move to Huddersfield Town, because it was too far north and that he would only move north if it was to a Championship side. On 29 August 2008, Bristol Rovers announced they had signed Kuffour on a three-year deal. He has made a massive impact at Rovers, including a volley at Leicester City and a last-minute equaliser against Leeds United. He finished the 2009\u201310 season as top scorer with 14 goals. After a successful loan spell in which he scored seven goals for the Gills, including a hat-trick in the 4\u20133 win over Northampton Town and both goals as league leaders Crawley Town were beaten 2\u20131 on Boxing Day, Kuffour signed for Gillingham permanently until the end of the season. At the end of the season Kuffour was released with teammates Simon King and Garry Richards. Kuffour was released from Wycombe Wanderers at the end of the 2013\u201314 season to join up with Sutton United where he eventually retired. == International career == Kuffour was called into the Ghana squad for a friendly versus Nigeria on 6 February 2007, but was not included in the matchday squad. == Career statistics == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |FA Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |League Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Europe ! colspan=\"2\" |Other ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |Arsenal |2000\u201301 |Premier League |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 |- |Swindon Town (loan) |2001\u201302 |Second Division |11 |2 |0 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1Appearances in Football League Trophy |0 |13 |2 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Torquay United |2002\u201303 | rowspan=\"2\" |Third Division |29 |5 |2 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |0 |32 |6 |- |2003\u201304 |41 |10 |0 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |0 |43 |10 |- |2004\u201305 |League One |34 |6 |0 |0 |1 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |1 |36 |8 |- |2005\u201306 |League Two |43 |8 |4 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |1 |49 |9 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !147 !29 !6 !1 !3 !1 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !4 !2 !160 !33 |- |Brentford |2006\u201307 |League One |39 |12 |1 |0 |2 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |2 |1 |44 |14 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Bournemouth |2007\u201308 |League One |42 |12 |2 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |3 |1 |48 |13 |- |2008\u201309 |League Two |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 |3 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !44 !12 !2 ! !2 !1 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !3 !1 !51 !28 |- | rowspan=\"5\" |Bristol Rovers |2008\u201309 | rowspan=\"3\" |League One |41 |11 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 |42 |11 |- |2009\u201310 |42 |14 |1 |0 |2 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 |45 |14 |- |2010\u201311 |42 |6 |1 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |2 |3 |46 |9 |- |2011\u201312 |League Two |5 |1 |0 |0 |1 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |6 |1 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !130 !32 !3 !0 !4 !0 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !2 !3 !139 !35 |- |Gillingham |2011\u201312 |League Two |30 |9 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |0 |31 |9 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Wycombe Wanderers |2012\u201313 | rowspan=\"2\" |League Two |32 |2 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |1 |0 |33 |2 |- |2013\u201314 |24 |3 |0 |0 |1 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |3 |0 |28 |4 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !56 !5 !0 !0 !1 !1 ! colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 !4 !0 !61 !6 |- |Sutton United |2014\u201315 |Conference South |3 |0 |0 |0 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2015 |0 |0 |3 |0 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !460 !101 !12 !1 !13 !4 !0 !0 !17 !7 !502 !113 |} ==Honours== ;Arsenal *FA Youth Cup: 1999\u201300 Torquay United * Football League Third Division third-place promotion: 2003\u201304 Individual * Brentford Supporters' Player of the Year: 2006\u201307 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:People from Edmonton, London Category:Association football forwards Category:English footballers Category:Arsenal F.C. players Category:Swindon Town F.C. players Category:Torquay United F.C. players Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:AFC Bournemouth players Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Wycombe Wanderers F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Sutton United F.C. players Category:English people of Ghanaian descent ",
