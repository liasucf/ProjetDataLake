    "text": "\"The Bartender and the Thief\" is a 1998 single by Welsh rock band Stereophonics. The song is the second track on their second album, Performance and Cocktails. The song's full length intro is only featured on the CD1 single and in the music video but was edited off the album. A live version from Cardiff Castle is available on CD2 of the single. Another live version from Sheffield Arena is on the \"Moviestar\" single. A bar version of the song is on CD 1 of the \"I Wouldn't Believe Your Radio\" single. \"Bartender\" was the first single taken from Performance and Cocktails. It was released on 9 November 1998 and reached number three on the UK Singles Chart. The music video features the band playing at Kanchanaburi Province, Thailand and is based on the Francis Ford Coppola movie, Apocalypse Now. ==Live performances== The song, which is one of their heavier tracks, is frequently played amongst their live sets. During live performances, vocalist Kelly Jones has been known to use the two bars without vocals before the final chorus to reference the Mot\u00f6rhead song \"Ace of Spades\". The lyrics therefore are \"The ace of spades, the ace of spades. The bartender and the thief were lovers...\" ==Track listings== CD: V2 / VVR5004653 (UK) #\"The Bartender and the Thief\" - 3:09 #\"She Takes Her Clothes Off\" - 3:57 #\"Fiddler's Green\" (The Tragically Hip)\\- 4:08 CD: V2 / VVR5004663 (UK) #\"The Bartender and the Thief\" (Live from Cardiff Castle) - 3:28 #\"Traffic\" (Live from Cardiff Castle) - 6:07 #\"Raymond's Shop\" (Live from Cardiff Castle) - 3:56 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1998) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |22 |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" !Chart (1998) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |154 |} ==Certifications== ==References== * Category:1998 singles Category:1998 songs Category:Songs written by Kelly Jones Category:Stereophonics songs Category:UK Independent Singles Chart number-one singles Category:V2 Records singles ",
