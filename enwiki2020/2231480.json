    "text": "In cryptography, a distribution ensemble or probability ensemble is a family of distributions or random variables X = \\\\{X_i\\\\}_{i \\in I} where I is a (countable) index set, and each X_i is a random variable, or probability distribution. Often I=\\N and it is required that each X_n have a certain property for n sufficiently large. For example, a uniform ensemble U = \\\\{U_n\\\\}_{n \\in \\mathbb{N}} is a distribution ensemble where each U_n is uniformly distributed over strings of length n. In fact, many applications of probability ensembles implicitly assume that the probability spaces for the random variables all coincide in this way, so every probability ensemble is also a stochastic process. ==See also== * Provable security * Statistically close * Pseudorandom ensemble * Computational indistinguishability ==References== * Goldreich, Oded (2001).
