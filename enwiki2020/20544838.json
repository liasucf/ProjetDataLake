    "text": "Giuseppe Arcidiacono (1927\u20131998) was an Italian physicist. He was born in Acireale and graduated in physics in Catania in 1951. He began working with Luigi Fantappi\u00e8 on what they called projective relativity at the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica in Rome. In 1958 he won a scholarship to the Istituto H. Poincar\u00e9 in Paris. He won the mathematics prize from the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei. From 1969 until his death in 1998 he was Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Perugia. Giuseppe Arcidiacono reasons for being notable: This translation of: https://web.archive.org/web/20081121211557/http://www.giuseppearcidiacono.net/biografia.htm \"Giuseppe Arcidiacono, born in 1927 and recently died in 1998, was one of the most brilliant Italian Physics Mathematics of the second postwar period. His most important contribution concerns a general method for the construction of unified field theories in physics... Since then, physicists have tried, without much success, to repeat the firm Maxwell, looking for a single unified theory and ultimately that was supposed to merge into a single entity, in addition to the electric field and magnetic field, all other fields Known in physics, from gravity to the nuclear industry. The great idea of Arcidiacono, in this respect has been to abandon a priori looking for a unique and definitive theory, to focus, instead, on how to build an entire class of unified theories, arranged in hierarchical order, in so that every theory is the generalization, or perfection, than immediately before. The construction method proposed by him was obtained through a thorough analysis of the logical transition from classical mechanics of Newton to Einstein's Relativity Restricted. This method has enabled him to build two successive generalizations of Restricted Relativity, known as projective Relativity and Relativity Compliant. In the first field is unified with the hydrodynamic field and the second is the unification of the electromagnetic field, as the hydrodynamic and gravitational.\" Also notable for the books he has written: * Entropia, sintropia, informazione.
