    "text": "Ancienne Douane (\"Old Custom house\") is a Renaissance and Renaissance Revival building in Haguenau, France. It originally stood at the entrance of the town. The building was built in 1515\u20131518 but heavily damaged in 1677, during the military campaign of Louis XIV of France against the D\u00e9capole. It was restored in 1681. In the 1890s, the municipal architect, Charles Stoll, transformed the large room on the first floor in a festivity hall (salle des f\u00eates). In the 20th century, the exterior of the building was adorned with sculptures by Albert Schultz (1873\u20131951) and two portals were added in the Neo-Renaissance style. The Ancienne Douane was damaged again during World War II. It was rebuilt using elements from other destroyed buildings. The ground floor of the Ancienne Douane houses a restaurant. == References == == External links == *Restaurant l\u2032Ancienne Douane Category:Haguenau Category:Buildings and structures in Bas-Rhin Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1518 Category:Renaissance architecture in France Category:Restaurants in France Category:Custom houses ",
