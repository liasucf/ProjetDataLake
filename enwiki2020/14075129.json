    "text": "Robert Charles Reuland (born 1963) is an American novelist and attorney. Reuland commenced his legal career in 1990 in Manhattan. Since 2001 Reuland has had a parallel career as a novelist. He is the author of two published novels, Hollowpoint (Random House 2001) and Semiautomatic (Random House 2004). Both books are set in the Brooklyn D.A.'s office, where Reuland worked an assistant district attorney between 1996 and 2001. Reuland's hard-edged but elegant writing is known for its gritty realism and has drawn praise from Dennis Lehane, Alan Furst, and George Pelecanos. A reviewer for the Washington Post referred to Semiautomatic as \"the best-written legal thriller I've ever read, hands down.\" The New York Times said Hollowpoint \"may just keep you up all night . . . Sometimes a murder story is just a murder story, but this is not one of those times.\" Marilyn Stasio of the New York Times called Reuland \"a daring writer.\" Of Reuland's second novel, \"Semiautomatic,\" Kirkus, in a starred review wrote, \"Reuland is a real-life ADA, and if he prosecutes as effectively as he writes, Brooklyn is a lucky borough.\" Reuland gained additional national notoriety in 2001 when fired from his position in the Brooklyn D.A.'s office shortly after the publication of his first book, Hollowpoint. Reuland brought a federal lawsuit claiming infringement of his First Amendment rights and prevailed after trial in 2004. Upon leaving the D.A.'s Office in 2001, Reuland established himself in private practice specializing in homicide defense. Born in Dallas, Texas and raised in Dubuque, Iowa, Reuland has lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn since 1990. ==Bibliography== Hollowpoint (2001) Semiautomatic (2004) ==External links== * Author Website * Law Firm Website * Martindale listing * New York Times Review of \"Hollowpoint\" * New York Book Review of \"Hollowpoint\" * January Magazine Review of \"Semiautomatic\" * Kirkus Review (starred) of \"Semiautomatic\" * \"A Crime- Writing Prosecutor Finds Success and Loses Job\" New York Times * Ex-Prosecutor Won\u2019t be Watching \u2018Brooklyn DA\u2019 * New York Times Public Lives * \"End of Book Battle for District Attorney\" New York Times * \"Facebook Status Update Provides Alibi\" CNN Category:Alumni of Queens' College, Cambridge Category:21st-century American novelists Category:American mystery writers Category:American male novelists Category:American prosecutors Category:New York (state) lawyers Category:Writers from Brooklyn Category:Writers from Dubuque, Iowa Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:21st- century American male writers Category:Novelists from New York (state) Category:Novelists from Iowa Category:People from Park Slope ",
