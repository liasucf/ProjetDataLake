The team was coached by Bobby Bowden and played their home games at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Florida. They were members of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and competed in the Atlantic Division. The Seminoles won their division and competed in the ACC title game, defeating Virginia Tech in the inaugural championship game. ==Recruits== The Seminoles recruiting class was ranked No. 2 in the nation behind only Southern California by Rivals.com, but never panned out. On a reevaluation in 2012, Rivals.com listed it among the most disappointing recruiting classes of the decade. ==Schedule== ==Post season== Florida State appeared in the first ACC title game. Florida State finished the season ranked number 23 in both the final AP and Coaches college football polls. Florida State's trip to the Orange Bowl marked the 24th consecutive post season bowl game under Bobby Bowden. ===NFL draft=== Six seniors and two juniors would go on and be drafted in the 2006 NFL Draft. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
