    "text": "The epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s (, \"the one in charge of the table\") was a Byzantine court post, responsible for the imperial banquets. ==History== The office, more fully known as the domestikos t\u0113s basilik\u0113s trapez\u0113s (, \"Domestic of the imperial table\"), epi t\u0113s basilik\u0113s trapez\u0113s () or epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s tou despotou (, \"in charge of the lord's table\"), is first mentioned as extant in the mid-7th century, but the source, a hagiography of Maximus the Confessor, is of much later date. It is, however, amply attested in seals from the 8th century on, often holding the offices of koubikoularios or parakoim\u014dmenos as well... The epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s was responsible for introducing guests to the imperial banquets, waiting to the Byzantine emperor along with the pinkern\u0113s, and carrying dishes from the imperial table to the guests. Historical sources, however, show that some holders of the post were entrusted with leading troops or various other special assignments. Like many palace posts involving close access to the Byzantine emperor, it was restricted to eunuchs. There was also the epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s t\u0113s Augoust\u0113s (, \"in charge of the table of the Augusta\"), who filled the same duties for the Byzantine empress, and in addition supervised her private barques.. The epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s was assisted by a staff, the so-called hypourgia (), headed by the domestikos t\u0113s hypourgias () and including also secretaries styled notarios t\u0113s hypourgias (). The German scholar Werner Seibt proposed that the epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s absorbed the main functions of the kastr\u0113sios, an earlier official with an apparently similar role.. Another official with similar duties, the k\u0113narios, is attested only a couple of times during the first decades of the 9th century. Seibt considers him either a subaltern official to the epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s or an intermediate stage between the kastr\u0113sios and the final absorption of his duties into the epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s.. From the 13th century on, the epi t\u0113s trapez\u0113s and the variant domestikos t\u0113s trapez\u0113s became purely honorary court titles, bereft of any specific duties. In this vein, Nikephoros Gregoras reports that this dignity was allegedly conferred and made hereditary to the princes of Russia from the time of Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306\u2013337) on. ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Byzantine court titles Category:Byzantine palace offices Category:Byzantine titles and offices reserved for eunuchs Category:Ceremonial occupations ",
