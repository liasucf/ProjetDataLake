The website's critical consensus reads, \"Future Mans nostalgia-driven premise is elevated by the cast's compelling chemistry and a sense of humor just dumb enough to lighten the sci-fi load.\" On Metacritic season 1 has a weighted average score of 70 out of 100 based on reviews from 20 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club praises the committed performances, the \"gleefully ludicrous nonsense\", and that \"If it figures out the proper tone and blend of stupid-smart jokes with its game cast, the series could potentially travel forward to a time when it becomes a great sci-fi comedy.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, season 2 has an approval rating of 100% based on 9 reviews, with an average rating of 8.03 out of 10. Adam Chitwood of Collider.com wrote: \"Future Man's strength as a series has been the writers' willingness to take the sci-fi seriously, and indeed there are times when you almost want the joke to be done so you can find out what happens next in the story.\" On Rotten Tomatoes, season 3 has 3 positive reviews. Alex McLevy of The A.V. Club wrote: \"Future Man finds a decent denouement to close out its triptych of seasons, and those who enjoyed past installments won\u2019t be let down by this one. If only all that traveling through space and time could have found a more richly developed series.\" Adam Chitwood of Collider.com called it \"A little disappointing but not inessential\" and that although it will not convince those who never got into the show to check it out, it should satisfy fans of the series. ===Awards and nominations=== In 2018 Future Man was Nominated for Best New Media Superhero Series at the 44th Saturn Awards ==Home Media== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"|Season ! colspan=\"2\"|Release date ! colspan=\"2\"|# Discs ! rowspan=\"2\"|ACB rating ! rowspan=\"2\"|More ! rowspan=\"2\"|Ref(s) |- !
