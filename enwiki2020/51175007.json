The album was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form.\"2017 Hugo Awards\", The Hugo Awards, April 04, 2017. Retrieved 2017-04-04. ==Story== Most of the songs are written and delivered from the perspective of the artificial intelligence within the cargo ship. As a riot breaks out on the ship, Cargo #2331 enters the bridge and kills the flight crew, and is the only person left alive on the ship in the aftermath. The A.I. reports an S.O.S message, but after a prolonged amount of time watching him as he begins to suffer cabin fever, rapping to himself as he attempts to control and reroute the ship, it begins to express romantic feelings for #2331, and calls off the message, threatening to kill any pursuers. The A.I. implies that there are no habitable planets for him to reach. Eventually, #2331 begins to cause havoc on the ship to try to get the attention of the A.I. After this fails, the A.I. breaks from its limitations and berates him for lashing out at it, giving #2331 clarity to keep living and searching for a place to escape. In the end, the A.I. muses on the life #2331 misses, asking for confirmation several times before giving him random coordinates, and flying off as the album ends with abrasive noise. ==Themes and references to other works== The album explores themes of Afrofuturism, referencing several science fiction novels. These include the works of Ursula Le Guin, Octavia Butler and Samuel R. Delany (whose unfinished sequel to Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand is titled The Splendor and Misery of Bodies, of Cities). A direct reference is made to Kendrick Lamar's verse from Big Sean's \"Control\". ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 76% based on 11 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". PopMatters named it the 4th best hip hop album of 2016, while Stereogum named it the 40th best rap album of 2016. The album was nominated for the 2017 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form, the second time ever for a music album following 1970's Blows Against the Empire by Paul Kantner and Jefferson Starship.
