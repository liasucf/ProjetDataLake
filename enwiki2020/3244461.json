He sought reconciliation between Philip, Duke of Burgundy and Charles VII during their estrangement in the latter part of the Hundred Years' War. De la Tr\u00e9moille was a political opponent of Arthur de Richemont within the French court. Most historians take a poor view of his career, assessing that he placed personal advancement before the public interest, though the traditional historical interpretation of the Grand Chamberlain as Jeanne d'Arc's opponent has been revised.

He regained his freedom shortly afterward and dedicated the rest of his career to court life and diplomacy. He made an advantageous marriage to Joan II of Auvergne (1378 \u20131424), Countess of Auvergne and Boulogne (1404 \u20131424). De la Tr\u00e9moille served the Burgundian court for several years, then joined the Armagnac court of Charles VII. La Tr\u00e9moille became a royal favourite in 1427. He gained the title of Grand Chamberlain and was instrumental in Constable de Richemont's expulsion from the court that same year. Following Joan of Arc's successful campaign to Rheims for the coronation of Charles VII, la Tr\u00e9moille delayed a march on Paris with fruitless peace negotiations. He may have been responsible for the lack of royal support that doomed her military actions thereafter. The historical consensus is that personal jealousies led him to undermine France's two best military commanders during a low point in the war. In September 1432 he paid for Rodrigo de Villandrando and his routiers to hold Les Ponts-de-C\u00e9 against the assaults of Jean de Bueil. That year de Richemont returned to court and imprisoned la Tr\u00e9moille the following year. Charles VII did not intervene. His daughter Louise de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle (1432 \u201310 April 1474), Dame de Boussac, married Bertrand VI of Auvergne and had two children: * Anne de la Tour d'Auvergne, second wife of Alexander Stewart, Duke of Albany * John III, Count of Auvergne He also had descents by his two mistresses; by Marie Guypaude, a daughter Marguerite (x Jean Salazar and a son Jean the \"bastard of La Tremo\u00eflle\", (legitimated and ennobled in 1445), a large number of descendants); and by Marie La Championne, Jacques, the other \"bastard of La Tremo\u00eflle\", legitimized in 1466. ==Ancestry== ==References== Category:People of the Hundred Years' War Category:French diplomats Tremoille, Georges of Category:Joan of Arc Category:1382 births Category:1446 deaths Category:Grand Chamberlains of France Georges Category:Medieval French diplomats Category:French prisoners of war in the Hundred Years' War Category:15th- century diplomats ",
