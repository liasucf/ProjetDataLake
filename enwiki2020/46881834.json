With the release of his follow-up, Dumb Flesh, Power abandons this singular musical mode, bringing with him myriad recording styles and techniques.\" Ben Ratliff from The New York Times commented that:\"he\u2019s giving you something you might find familiar or even commercial by its basic outlines. But he\u2019s still got ways to make it uncanny: close, loud and abrupt.\" The Quietus reviewer James Ubaghs observed that:\"A reoccurring feature is the way that vocal samples frequently sound like synths, and synths sound almost like vocals, on the verge of attaining sentience.\" Sam Shepherd, in his review for musicOMH commented:\"There are some fine moments here, but all too often Dumb Flesh seems like a diluted version of Fuck Buttons.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Blanck Mass albums Category:Sacred Bones Records albums ",
