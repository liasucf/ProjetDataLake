    "text": "Friedrich Jeremias Witt (November 8, 1770 - January 3, 1836) was a German composer and cellist. He is perhaps best known as the likely author of a Symphony in C major known as the Jena Symphony, once attributed to Ludwig van Beethoven. ==Biography== Witt was born in 1770, the same year as Beethoven, and was a German composer of considerable stature in his time. He was born in the W\u00fcrttemberg village of Niederstetten, the son of a cantor and court clerk. Witt became a cellist (some accounts say a violinist) in the court orchestra of Oettingen-Wallerstein when he was nineteen, taking composition lessons there with Antonio Rosetti, that is, the Bohemian-born Anton R\u00f6sler.Greene, David Mason. Greene's Biographical Encyclopedia of Composers, Reproducing Piano Roll Fnd., (1985) , p. 442 Witt was most famous in his lifetime for his oratorio Der leidende Heiland- in English, The Suffering Saviour, securing an appointment as Kapellmeister for the Prince of W\u00fcrzburg, and later for the theater, where he stayed until his death. He also wrote two operas: Palma (1804) and Das Fischerweib (1806). His other compositions include concertos, church music, chamber music and symphonies. His best-known work, a symphony in C major known as the Jena, is largely based on the Symphony No. 97 by Joseph Haydn. Stephen Fisher compiled a thematic index of Witt's symphonies. Published the same year as Garland Publishing's edition (by Fisher) of Witt's symphony in D (Thematic Index FisW 2.) The RISM catalog online lists 15 (and one fragmentary - unfinished?) of Witt's symphonies with manuscript copy (or other source) locations and Fisher thematic catalogue numbers, but assuming none of the works before no. 23- the last, fragmentary one, they list- are also unfinished, that still leaves 18 Witt symphonies (since their database includes a listing of his symphony catalog no. 18.) ==Notes== ==Sources== * Opera at Stanford University ==Discography== * Symphonies Nos. 6 and 9, Flute Concerto.
