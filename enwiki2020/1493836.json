In 2015 the charity published its new five year strategy 'Defeating Brain Tumours' The charity's goals are to double survival of a brain tumour diagnosis within 10 years in the UK, and to halve the harm that brain tumours have on quality of life. ==History== The Brain Tumour Charity, as it is today, was created after the merging of Brain Tumour UK, Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust and the Joseph Foote Trust in 2013. The Samantha Dickson Brain Tumour Trust was started by Neil and Angela Dickson in 1996, who lost their daughter, Samantha, to a brain tumour when she was just 16 years old. They had become aware of the lack of properly funded research into this cancer and were determined to try and remedy the situation. Andy Foote founded The Joseph Foote Fund in 2007 after losing his son, Joseph, to a brain tumour. The Foote family began raising funds for research into the causes and treatment of brain tumours \u2013 in its 12-year history The Joseph Foote Trust raised more than \u00a32million. In 1997, the UK Brain Tumour Society was founded, which later became Brain Tumour UK. The Brain Tumour Charity has grown rapidly since the merging, funding a diverse portfolio of research programmes, projects and clinical trials across the UK. == Activities == === Research and research funding === The Brain Tumour Charity currently fund a portfolio of research across the UK with the aim of doubling survival and reducing long term harm through improving the understand and complexities of brain tumours, better diagnostic techniques and new treatments. To achieve these goals, the charity focuses efforts on five priority areas that the charity believes will have the biggest effect for those affected, reflected in its five-year research strategy, \u2018A Cure Can\u2019t Wait\u2019: *Accelerate \u2013 biobanking to accelerate research progress through centralised collection of, and access to, brain tumour tissue samples. *Diagnose \u2013 diagnosing brain tumours earlier and more accurately for both children and adults. *Understand \u2013 increasing understanding of the genetics and biology of tumour development to identify effective new treatments. *Catalyse \u2013 translating laboratory discoveries into new and effective treatments that increase survival and quality of life. *Enhance \u2013 enhancing care and quality of life for everyone affected by a brain tumour, including patients and carers. The charity works, has worked, and continues to work with a number of medical and research institutes, laboratories and universities looking for cures to defeat brain tumours, as well as treatments for both adults and children. They also provide funding opportunities in line with the \u2018A Cure Can\u2019t Wait\u2019 strategy, and award these following competitive peer reviewing processes and assessments made by their independent Grant Review and Monitoring Committee (GRAM). === Support and Information services === The Brain Tumour Charity is the only national brain tumour charity to provide a variety of information and support services which allow people personally affected by brain tumours to access support online, face to face, on the phone or in printed form across the UK, regardless of tumour type, age or location, for both adults and children.

HeadSmart HeadSmart is a multi-award-winning, UK-wide campaign based on research funded by The Brain Tumour Charity at The University of Nottingham (2003-2006). HeadSmart aims to educate the public and healthcare professionals about the signs and symptoms of brain tumours in children and young people, to reduce diagnosis times, to save lives and to reduce long term disability.

In 2015 the charity commissioned a research project \u2018Living with a brain tumour, in partnership with an independent research agency. The research investigated the lived experience of adults with a brain tumour. Two publications have results from the research: *\u2018Losing Myself: The Reality of Life with a Brain Tumour\u2019 \u2013 this report demonstrated the extensive effect that brain tumours have on the daily lives of those affected. *\u2018Finding Myself in Your Hands: The Reality of Brain Tumour Treatment and Care\u2019 \u2013 this report outlined the findings related to respondents\u2019 experiences of their NHS treatment and care ==== Manifestos ==== Ahead of the 2015 general elections, The Brain Tumour Charity released a manifesto on brain tumours.
