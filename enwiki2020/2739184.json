    "text": "Uzal, in the Hebrew Bible, is a descendant of Joktan (Genesis 10:27 ; 1 Chronicles 1:21), whose settlements are traced in the ancient name of Sana\u02bda, the capital city of the Yemen.Al-Hamd\u0101ni, al-\u1e24asan ibn A\u1e25mad, The Antiquities of South Arabia - The Eighth Book of Al-Ikl\u012bl, Oxford University Press 1938, pp. 8, 21, known also under its Arabic equivalent Az\u0101l. He was believed to be the founder of an Arabian tribe. Uzal was the sixth of thirteen sons of Joktan. As noted in Genesis 10:26 - 10:29, Joktan became the father of Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah and Obal and Abimael and Sheba and Ophir and Havilah and Jobab. Occurring in a series of genealogies intended to trace every race known to the ancient Hebrews to one of Noah's children, the Hebrew name Uzal probably referred to the region of Az\u0101l around modern Sana'a in Yemen. ==See also== * Joktan ==References== Category:Torah people ",
