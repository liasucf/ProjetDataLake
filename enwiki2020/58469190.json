    "text": "Love, Loss, and Auto-Tune is a studio album by Swamp Dogg. It was released via Joyful Noise Recordings on September 7, 2018. It peaked at number 7 on the Billboard Heatseekers Albums chart, as well as number 28 on the Independent Albums chart. ==Production== The album was inspired by Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak. After Swamp Dogg and MoogStar recorded a rough version of the album, Ryan Olson and Justin Vernon spent several years \"refining, fine- tuning, and deconstructing\" these recordings. The album includes the cover versions of \"Answer Me, My Love\" and \"Star Dust\". In a 2018 interview with Los Angeles Times, Swamp Dogg said, \"It's the best thing I've done since the '70s.\" ==Music videos== Music videos were created for \"I'll Pretend\", \"Lonely\", \"Sex with Your Ex\", and \"Star Dust\". ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 74, based on 8 reviews, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Mark Deming of AllMusic wrote, \"with Love, Loss, and Auto-Tune, Swamp Dogg takes a very deep dive into the electronic side of contemporary pop, hip-hop, and R&B;, and he predictably pushes it to the wall.\" Elias Leight of Rolling Stone wrote, \"On Love, Loss, and Auto-Tunes best songs, [Ryan] Olson's synth-heavy backdrops evoke the late Eighties, landing somewhere between early Chicago house music and twitchy hip- hop.\" Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that \"Swamp Dogg sets off into a bizarre, unsettled realm of computer-manipulated vocals and surreal, anything-can-happen electronic backdrops.\" Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork wrote, \"The experiment succeeds because Swamp Dogg delivers on all three aspects of his album title: the ecstasies of love, the misery of loss, and the way Auto-Tune can be used to magnify those feelings.\" Mojo placed it at number 56 on the \"Top 75 Albums of 2018\" list. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from liner notes. * Swamp Dogg \u2013 vocals, keyboards (1) * MoogStar \u2013 production, vocals (1) * Andrew Broder \u2013 production (1, 5, 7) * Justin Vernon \u2013 messina (1\u20138), vocals (3), keyboards (4) * Romain Bly \u2013 French horn (1, 7), arrangement (1, 7, 9) * Alistair Sung \u2013 cello (1, 7, 9) * Thora Margret Sveinsdottir \u2013 viola (1, 7, 9) * Shelley Soerensen \u2013 violin (1, 7) * Marlies von Gangelen \u2013 oboe (1, 7) * Maaike van der Linde \u2013 flute (1, 7) * Taskforce \u2013 production (1, 8) * Amire Johnson \u2013 keyboards (1) * Brian Nichols \u2013 keyboards (2, 5, 6) * Erik Andersen \u2013 keyboards (2, 5) * Lazerbeak \u2013 boom bap (2, 5) * Jake Hanson \u2013 guitar (2, 6) * Charles Hayes \u2013 saxophone (2, 8) * Chris Bierden \u2013 bass guitar (2, 9) * Ryan Olson \u2013 keyboard bass (3), bass guitar (6), piano (9) * Bobby Raps \u2013 snare (3), handclap (7) * Guitar Shorty \u2013 guitar (3), headphone bleed (3) * Seth Rosetter \u2013 deep noise (3) * Psymun \u2013 production (4, 5) * Sen 09 \u2013 production (4) * Elliot Kozel \u2013 keyboards (4) * Morgan Whirledge \u2013 keyboards (4) * Isaac Gale \u2013 bass guitar (4) * V*agra \u2013 shaker (4) * Chris Eagan \u2013 drums (5) * Josh Berg \u2013 beat (6) * Trever Hagen \u2013 production (7) * Jeremy Ylvisaker \u2013 guitar (7) * Decarlo Jackson \u2013 bass guitar (7) * Mark McGee \u2013 shaker (7) * Drew Christopherson \u2013 hi-hat (9) * Andre de Ridder \u2013 violin (9) * Mayah Kadish \u2013 violin (9) * David McMurry \u2013 photography * Erik Madigan Heck \u2013 photography * David J.
