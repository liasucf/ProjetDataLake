Brown, New Haven: A guide to architecture and urban design, Yale University Press, 1976. Located directly south of Downtown New Haven, the neighborhood is now home to New Haven Union Station as well as Yale-New Haven Hospital and the Yale School of Medicine. ==History== Originally a distinct suburb of New Haven, The Hill began its urban development in the early 1800s. The sub-neighborhood south of Columbus Ave now known as Trowbridge Square was established in the 1830s by brothers Nathaniel and Simeon Jocelyn. Known at first as the village of Spireworth, this enclave was founded as a rare example of a racially integrated planned community. Oak Street, in a section of the Hill that was fully demolished to make way for the Oak Street Connector In the middle of the century waves of Irish and German immigrants began pouring into the neighborhood. African-Americans migrated from the American South, and this neighborhood also served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. In 1957 a sizable swath of the Hill containing 881 households and 350 businesses was flattened to make way for the Oak Street Connector, a 1.1 mile highway stub that was never extended toward Derby as originally planned. In 2013 New Haven began work to downgrade the Oak Street Connector into city streets in an effort to reconnect The Hill to Downtown New Haven. == Geography == Houses along Trowbridge Square The Hill is bounded by the Route 34/Oak Street Connector and Legion Ave. at the north, the Long Wharf neighborhood at the east, the city of West Haven at the west, and Long Island Sound at the south.Hello New Haven The southeastern part of the neighborhood (south of Columbus Avenue) is roughly divided into three sections: Kimberly Square, Trowbridge Square, and City Point.
