    "text": "Coleraine Castle was a castle situated at Coleraine, County Londonderry, Northern Ireland. The Annals of Ulster reports that the Earl of Atholl, Thomas fitz Roland, built the castle in 1214.Brown (2016) p. 140; Annala Uladh (2005) \u00a7 1214.5; Annala Uladh (2003) \u00a7 1214.5; McNeill (1983) p. 114. It was later destroyed by Hugh de Lacy and the King of T\u00edr Eoghain, Aodh M\u00e9ith \u00d3 N\u00e9ill,Brown (2016) pp. 170, 172; Veach (2014) p. 200; Oram (2013) ch. 4; Bardon (2005) pp. 41\u201342; Stringer (1998) p. 93; Orpen (1920) pp. 44\u201345. as evidenced by the same source in 1223.Veach (2014) p. 200; Oram (2013) ch. 4; Annala Uladh (2005) \u00a7 1222.1; Annala Uladh (2003) \u00a7 1222.1; Orpen (1920) pp. 44\u201345. The Annals of Ulster also reports that Thomas reconstructed the castle in 1228.Brown (2016) p. 170; Oram (2011) pp. 188\u2013189; Annala Uladh (2005) \u00a7 1228.10; Annala Uladh (2003) \u00a7 1228.10; Duffy (1993) p. 96; Orpen (1920) p. 44 n. 2. There is evidence to suggest that Thomas may not have been in any position to carry out reconstruction efforts.Brown (2016) pp. 170, 172. In 1225, he was owed an annuity of 100 marks in compensation for his Irish losses. In 1227, he declared that he had been impoverished through serving the English Crown in Ireland. If it wasn't Thomas was reconstructed Coleraine Castle, it is possible that Hugh did. However, the only record of Hugh operating in Thomas' lands occurs almost two decades later, in 1241.Brown (2016) p. 172. ==Citations== ===Primary sources=== * * ===Secondary sources=== * * * * * * * * * Category:Castles in County Londonderry ",
