Accessed February 17, 2011. \"Villone, who turns 36 next month and was born in Englewood, N.J., had a 4.08 ERA with 70 strikeouts in 64 innings (79 games) for the Marlins and Mariners last season.\" Villone grew up in Bergenfield, New Jersey.MARINERS TAKE EX- BERGENFIELD STAR -- VILLONE PICKED 14TH OVERALL. The Record (Bergen County), June 2, 1992. \"The call came a little later than anticipated, but Ron Villone of Bergenfield got what he expected Monday afternoon.\" ==College career== Villone attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst and was a two-sport star, playing baseball and football. Villone was a tight end when he played football, and he had success with it. In 1990, he was selected as a first team All-Yankee Conference tight end. His natural strength was on the pitcher's mound. In 1991, Villone was the recipient of the Atlantic-10 Left Handed Pitcher of the Year award. Not only did he pitch for Team USA in 1992 at the Barcelona Olympics, he also was a third-team All American Selection after striking out 89 in just 59 innings. ==Professional career== ===Seattle Mariners=== Villone was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the first round (14th overall) of the 1992 Major League Baseball Draft. Prior to signing with Seattle, Villone increased his bargaining position while playing for the Bourne Braves of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He had an impressive debut, striking out 18, and in his next outing, he fanned 14. In , the Mariners assigned him to Riverside, at the time; it was the Advanced-A affiliate. He posted respectable numbers, going 7\u20134 with a 4.21 ERA in 16 starts. He pitched 83 innings, allowing 74 hits, walking 62, and striking out 82. These numbers were so good that he earned a promotion to their AA affiliate, Jacksonville. At Jacksonville, he went 3\u20134 with a 4.38 earned run average in 11 starts. In 63 innings, Villone allowed a total of 49 hits, 41 walks, and 66 strikeouts. Meanwhile, his walks per nine decreased in Jacksonville, as well as his walks and hits allowed per innings pitched. However, his strikeouts per nine innings pitched increased to 9.33, averaging more than one strikeout per inning. Ron stayed in Jacksonville for the season, going 6\u20137 with a 3.86 earned run average. In 41 games, (only five of them were starts); he pitched 79 innings, allowing just 56 hits, 19 walks, and 43 strikeouts. Although he was not the full-time closer, Villone compiled eight saves in the 1994 season. Because of his stellar 1994 campaign, Seattle promoted him, effective at the start of the season, to their AAA affiliate, Tacoma (still their affiliate today). He had a magnificent start to the 1995 season, going 1\u20130 with a 0.61 earned run average. In 22 appearances as the full-time closer, Villone saved 13 games and struck out 43 batters. Villone was recalled from AAA on April 28, 1995. He made his Major League debut on April 28, 1995 working a scoreless ninth inning against the Detroit Tigers.

He walked 23 batters, but struck out 26. He was a victim of the long ball, allowing six home runs. ===San Diego Padres=== On July 31, 1995, the Mariners General Manager at the time, Woody Woodward, dealt Villone and Marc Newfield to San Diego in exchange for Greg Keagle and Andy Benes. Villone spent the remainder of the season with the Padres, going 2\u20131 with a 4.21 earned run average. In 25 innings, Villone gave up 24 hits, 11 walks while striking out 37. He started the season with San Diego\u2019s AAA Affiliate, Las Vegas. Villone proved that he could be dominant, so, San Diego called him up. He was just as good with the Padres, going 1\u20131 in 21 games with a 2.95 earned run average. He pitched 18 innings, recording 17 hits, 7 walks, and 19 strikeouts. ===Milwaukee Brewers=== On July 31, 1996, the Padres shipped Villone, Bryce Florie, and Marc Newfield to the Milwaukee Brewers for Gerald Parent and Greg Vaughn.

As part of the deal, Jeff Juden and Marquis Grissom went to Milwaukee. This was the third consecutive year that Villone was traded, but this was the first year in which he was not dealt midway through the year. It was a rough year in for Ron, especially considering the fact that he split time with Buffalo (Cleveland\u2019s AAA affiliate) and the major-league club. He had a better time in Buffalo, going 2\u20132 with a 2.01 earned run average in 23 appearances. In 22 innings, he gave up 20 hits and walked 11.

Despite this limited success, he was released on May 15, . ===Houston Astros (2nd time)=== On May 19, 2003, he returned to the Astros on a one-year deal. He was assigned to AAA New Orleans. A 3\u20131 record and a 1.23 earned run average in 5 starts (29 innings) earned him a trip to the big leagues, where he went 6\u20136 with a 4.13 earned run average. All 19 outings with the Astros were starts, amassing 106 innings. He allowed a total of 91 hits and 48 walks, and had 91 strikeouts. ===Seattle Mariners (2nd time)=== On November 2, 2003, Villone chose to test the free agent market, once again. The Mariners signed him to a one-year contract. Villone had a decent season with them, going 8\u20136 with a 4.08 earned run average. Again, Villone was used in a long relief/spot starter role, something that he was accustomed to from his days with Houston, Colorado, and Pittsburgh. In 117 innings, Villone gave up 102 hits and 64 walks, while striking out 86. His contract expired at the end of the season, and he declared free agency once again.

He then threw to first base 12 times to hold the runner, without once throwing to home plate, annoying the crowd who booed Villone mercilessly. When Villone finally threw to home plate, the batter bunted the ball back to Villone, failed to make the play.http://www.watchingdurhambullsbaseball.com/2010/07/how-hot-was- it.html#links Villone walked the next batter and hit the following batter with a two-strike pitch to force in the tying run.http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story/8870030/article-Durham-rallies- past-Syracuse-in-the-8th?instance=homesixthleft He was immediately pulled from the game.
