    "text": "Lafayette Regional Airport is a public airport two miles (4 km) southeast of Lafayette, in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, United States. It is independently owned and operated. The airport is located next to U.S. Highway 90 (future Interstate 49) on the east side of the city, close to offshore oil and gas activity in the Gulf of Mexico. Lafayette Regional is home to one of the largest helicopter companies in the world, PHI, Inc. (formerly Petroleum Helicopters Inc.). Although the airport does not have international flights, regional jet service is operated nonstop to three hubs: Atlanta (ATL), Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and Houston (IAH). Delta Air Lines began mainline Boeing 717-200 jet service nonstop to Atlanta effective July 3, 2014, in addition to its regional jet flights operated by Delta Connection. United Airlines began expanded service from Lafayette featuring a new daily nonstop flight to Denver which became effective August 19, 2014, and was operated by its regional partner United Express until this flight was discontinued on October 23, 2015. Delta, via Delta Connection, previously provided nonstop service from Lafayette to its hub in Memphis, TN until 2011. Allegiant Air initiated nonstop service to Las Vegas on November 3, 2011, but then discontinued these flights in February 2012. Frontier Airlines began new service into Lafayette with Airbus A320 jetliners effective October 24, 2018 with two nonstop flights a week to Denver (DEN) as well as two nonstop flights a week to Orlando (MCO) with both of these destinations being hub cities for Frontier. Frontier ended its seasonal service to Orlando from Lafayette in August 2019 and then ended its seasonal service from Lafayette to Denver on November 10, 2019 with flights to both cities planned to resume in the spring of 2020.http://www.flylafayette@sides.com However, Frontier has since stated it will not be resuming flights from Lafayette with its service now suspended indefinitely.https://www.katc.com/news/lafayette-parish/frontier-airlines- suspends-flights-from-lft-indefinitely The airport serves the greater Lafayette metropolitan area as well as nearby New Iberia, which has a combined population of approximately 530,000 people. In 2014, 501,101 passengers flew in and out of the airport, the highest in its history. ==Facilities and aircraft== Lafayette Regional Airport (LFT) covers at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has three asphalt runways: 4L/22R, , 4R/22L, , and 11/29, . It has one helipad, . In the year ending May 31, 2016 the airport had 47,239 aircraft operations, an average of 129 per day: 48% general aviation, 45% air taxi, 2% military and 5% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 144 aircraft based at this airport: 54% single-engine, 17% multi-engine, 20% jet and 9% helicopter. ==Airlines and destinations== ===Passenger=== {| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:1px #aaa solid; width:50em; margin:0.2em auto\" |- !

It is approximately 22,500 square feet. Construction commenced in September 2010. It provides parking for two Boeing 757 aircraft on its apron and also is accessible to existing taxiways that connect to runways 4R/22L. The relocation of the cargo ramp provides cargo carriers such as UPS and FedEx direct access to U.S. Highway 90 (future Interstate 49 freeway corridor). Currently, UPS bases a Boeing 757-200 aircraft at the airport. FedEx previously based two (2) Boeing 727-200 trijets on the airfield until this aircraft type was retired from their fleet on June 21, 2013. The FedEx Boeing 727s have now been replaced with a Boeing 757-200 aircraft. These Boeing 757 jets operated by both FedEx and UPS are currently the largest aircraft to use the airport on a regular basis. DHL had operated a Douglas DC-9 aircraft configured for freight operations from Lafayette; however, this company subsequently shut down all of their flight operations in the U.S. It was envisioned by airport officials that the old cargo ramp would create more room for a planned main terminal building extension. However, the airport has now begun planning for the construction of a completely new passenger terminal which would replace the old terminal.http://www.theadvertiser.com. \"Lafayette airport terminal tax passes\" ==Terminal expansion study== A preliminary study was being conducted concerning the existing terminal building in planning for future growth and construction. Adding an extension to the terminal would have allowed Lafayette Regional Airport to handle more air traffic, which could entice international carriers to use it as a connecting airport. This would require a U.S. Customs department office stationed at the airport, which would bring Lafayette Regional Airport to an 'international airport' status. However, international service from Lafayette appears unlikely at this time due to the relatively small population base in the area as well as the presence of large international and domestic passenger hubs located relatively nearby in Atlanta (Delta Air Lines), Dallas/Fort Worth (American Airlines) and Houston (United Airlines). ==New airport terminal== On Dec. 6, 2014, local voters approved a ballot measure that will enable a new one percent sales tax to be collected in order to fund construction of a completely new passenger air terminal at Lafayette Regional Airport.http://www.theadvertiser.com, \"Lafayette airport terminal tax passes\" According to an article in the Lafayette Daily Advertiser newspaper, airport officials will use the funds generated by the sales tax to select a design firm, finalize a design and develop construction plans. Construction of a new terminal could begin in 2017 and take about three years to complete. However, additional federal and state funding will be required in order for the project to be completed. While construction of a new terminal is underway, the existing passenger terminal will be used. Once the new terminal is in operation, plans call for the existing terminal to be demolished. Construction of the new terminal began in September 2018. As of the beginning of October 2018, the hangar that was present on the spot of the new terminal location has been demolished and cleaned up to proceed onto construction of the terminal. A public live webcam has been added at the airport facing where the new terminal will be built, and can be viewed on the airport's website. ==History== ===World War II=== The airport opened as Lafayette Municipal Airport on 29 November 1930. On 5 July 1942, during World War II, the airport was commandeered by the United States Army Air Forces and used as a contract primary pilot training airfield under the AAF Gulf Coast Training Center (later Central Flying Training Command). The 384th Army Air Force Base Unit administered the contract to a civilian-operated primary flying school (Lafayette School of Aeronautics) as a sub-base of DeRidder Army Air Base, Louisiana, which also had four (4) auxiliary airfields located nearby for emergency and overflow landings. Fairchild PT-19s were the primary trainer; several PT-17 Stearmans and a few P-40 Warhawks were assigned. Control of the airfield was transferred from DeRidder AAB to Third Air Force (Esler Field) on 24 March 1944. The mission of base became training of replacement combat aircrews. On 30 September 1945, the airfield was deactivated and returned to civil control. ===Postwar civil use: airline service=== In 1948, Eastern Air Lines began the first scheduled passenger service into Lafayette.

The exception is Delta Air Lines which began mainline service nonstop to Atlanta on July 3, 2014, using the Boeing 717-200 jetliner. At this same time, Delta Connection also began serving Lafayette with 76-seat Canadair CRJ900 regional jets which like the B717 feature first class, \"Economy Comfort\" and standard coach seating. Previously, the only mainline jet aircraft type serving Lafayette (following the cessation of Continental Airlines mainline jet service) was the twice weekly McDonnell Douglas MD-80 service flown by Allegiant Air nonstop to Las Vegas. On June 7, 2012 Delta Connection began daily service to Atlanta on Canadair CRJ700s with wi-fi, 9 first class seats, and 56 economy class seats including an enhanced \"Economy Comfort\" section featuring increased legroom. These flights provided the only first class service available at the time from Lafayette.

However, that changed when Delta began 110-seat Boeing 717 service nonstop to Atlanta on July 3, 2014. The B717, featuring first class, \"Economy Comfort\" and standard coach seating, is one of the larger aircraft types to serve Lafayette with scheduled passenger flights and marked the return of mainline jet aircraft service at the airport. One of the largest aircraft types to previously serve Lafayette was the McDonnell Douglas MD-80 flown by Allegiant Air with nonstop service to Las Vegas before this airline ceased all flights from the airport. Another large aircraft type to serve the airport was the Airbus A320 flown by Frontier Airlines before this air carrier discontinued its service to Lafayette. Other airlines are now operating larger regional jet types into Lafayette.

These flights were operated by United regional affiliate and code sharing partner United Express with Embraer ERJ-145 regional jets. This service marked the first time Lafayette had nonstop flights to the United hub in Denver. However, on July 27, 2015, United Airlines announced it would be ending this United Express service to Denver and the flight was discontinued on October 23, 2015. ===Previous nonstop Denver and Orlando service: Frontier Airlines=== Frontier Airlines began serving Lafayette on October 24, 2018 with nonstop Airbus A320 jetliner flights operated twice a week to both Denver (DEN) and Orlando (MCO) with both of these cities serving as hubs for the airline.

Bush, the 43rd President of the United States. This Boeing 747-200B (USAF aircraft designation VC-25A) flight into Lafayette with President Bush on board appears to have been the largest aircraft ever to land at the airport. More recently, U.S. Air Force C-17 \"Globemaster III\" aircraft have flown into Lafayette. These large, four engine, military transport jets were supporting air show activities at the airfield. In addition, United Airlines uses Lafayette Regional as a diversion airport when inclement weather disrupts flight operations at the airline's major connecting hub located at Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) in Texas. Up to five (5) Boeing 737 jetliners operated by United have been observed on the airport ramp at one time due to weather diversions. ==Accidents and incidents== * On December 28, 2019, a Piper PA-31T Cheyenne crashed shortly after takeoff, approximately one nautical mile from LFT.
