    "text": "Judith Henry (born 1942) is a New York-based artist that creates multimedia art works exploring the duality of interior versus public self. Henry often repurposes documentary materials (such as newspapers, telephone books, and film reels) in poignant explorations of identity. She also uses snapshot photography to document the variety and sameness inherent in human life. Her urge to speak through others, splicing dialogue and imagery, probes the gaps between what we say and how we appear, ultimately pointing to the slippery status of identity, evincing her desire to gather the tangible materials of a life. ==Early life and education== Henry received a Bachelor of Fine Arts from Carnegie-Mellon University. ==Career== Pages of Freud (1971), Henry crosshatches lines onto page after page of Freud\u2019s writings, signaling her persistent doubts about the therapeutic potential of language. She continues mining this vein in both Telephone Book Series (1973) and Male and Female (1982, 2009). In her artist\u2019s book, Who's Who (1977), she frames newspaper photos of beloved and forgotten faces within the confines of a generic human profile. In Who I Saw in New York (1970-2000,) her street photographs, as a book and as an installation, aggregate thousands of portraits in an attempt to tease out patterns in human experience. In \u201cOverheard\u201d, a project started in the 1970s that has been ongoing for more than thirty years, Henry combines photographs she takes on the street with fragments of conversation she overhears in public places. She has created six artist\u2019s books combining her street photography with overheard text. Henry has exhibited thousands of quotes and photographs in installations at Bergdorf Goodman (Overheard in New York) and at Neiman Marcus (Overheard in Los Angeles). True Stories Videos (2008-2011), a disconcerting mix of biography and fiction, in which anonymous storytellers recall their youth over dense collages of childhood photos, home videos and stock footage. Rebirth (2012), a collage series made by layering fragments of celebrity faces onto obituary photos. These hybrid portraits obscure their subjects and speak to collective experiences of uncertainty and disappearance. Girls, Girls, Girls (2012) a photo-based series in which she restates high school senior yearbook portraits in an ambiguous gesture of shared identity. Me As Her (2014) A series of black and white photographs continuing Henry's long standing practice of remaining hidden/masked within her work. She reimagines herself behind masks of significant and accomplished women who have died. The Artist is Hiding (2014-2015) A series of photographs depicting Henry wearing a different mask for each corresponding painting. Casting Call(2015-2018) A series of 300 small sculptures contracted from detritus derived from her studio. Henry designed Crumpled Paper Stationary as part of Wooster Enterprises (1976\u201379), a collaborative, conceptual business she began with artist Jaime Davidovich. Using their own original designs and additional prototypes by George Maciunas, Davidovich and Henry sold small paper products\u2014greeting cards, writing pads, confetti, and other paper goods\u2014to large and small stores throughout the United States. Their intent was to bring conceptual art into a truly commercial arena. After Wooster Enterprises failed, The Museum of Modern Art continued to produce Henry\u2019s crumpled paper stationary. For years, it was one of the Museum store\u2019s best selling items. ===Books=== * 2000 \"Overheard at the Museum\", Universe Publishers * 2001 \"Overheard at the Bookstore\", Universe Publishers * 2001 \"Overheard While Shopping\", Universe Publishers * 2001 \"Overheard in Love\", Universe Publishers * 2002 \"Overheard on the Way to MOMAQueens'' * 2006 \"Overheard in America\", Atria Books ===Exhibitions=== * 2018 Casting Call, January, BravinLee Programs, New York, NY * 2017 Alternate Lives, Judith Henry and Morton Bartlett, National Arts Club, New York, NY * 2016 Me as Her, Visual Arts Center of New Jersey, NJ * 2015 Solo exhibition, BravinLee Programs, New York, NY * 2014 Women Choose Women Again, Visual Arts center of New Jersey, Summit, NJ * 2012 Davis Orton Gallery, Hudson, NY * 2012 Churner and Churner, Wooster Enterprises Exhibition, New York, NY * 2011 0.00156 acres Gallery, September, Brooklyn * 2010 National Academy Invitational Exhibition, New York * 2008 Festival de Cine International de Barcelona, Berta Bornstein * 2008 San Francisco Short Film Festival, Berta Bornstein * 2008 Technocracy, Carnegie Mellon University, Regina Gouger Miller Gallery, The Southern Express, Pittsburgh, PA * 2008 Philadelphia Independent Film Festival, Berta Bornstein * 2008 Ace Film Festival, The Southern Express, New York, NY * 2005 Artsumer Gallery, Statement in the Art, Istanbul, Turkey * 2003 Reading Between the Lines, 147 Wooster Arts Space, New York, NY * 2002 Barbara Krak\u00f3w Gallery, Boston, MA * 2001 Emily Davis Gallery, University of Akron, Akron, OH * 1996 25th Year Retrospective, Douglass College, New Brunswick, NJ * 1996 Tartessos Gallery, Barcelona, Spain * 1992 Bound & Unbound, New York, NY * 1989 Graphic Design in America, Walker Art Center, Minneapolis, MN * 1988 Alternating Currents, Alternative Museum, New York, NY * 1986 White Columns Presents Video, White Columns, New York, NY * 1985 Video Festival, A.I.R.
