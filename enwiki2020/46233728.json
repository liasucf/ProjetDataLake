The Cammin Casket was made in southern Scandinavia around the year 1000 and decorated in the Mammen style. It held the relics of Saint Cordula. Until the Second World War, it was on display in the Cathedral of Saint John in Cammin in Western Pomerania (now Konkatedra \u015bw. Jana Chrzciciela in Kamie\u0144 Pomorski in north-western Poland). The box disappeared during the war, when the church's interior was almost completely destroyed by fire. Several copies survive. ==External links== *Strange encounter: a dragon\u2019s egg nestled in the Museum\u2019s attic - blog of the Victoria and Albert museum Category:Shrines Category:Viking Age art ",
