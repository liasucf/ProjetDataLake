    "text": "Einsatzgruppen Trial (officially, The United States of America vs. Otto Ohlendorf, et al.) was the ninth of the twelve trials for war crimes and crimes against humanity by the US authorities held in their occupation zone in Germany in Nuremberg after the end of World War II. These twelve trials were all held before US military courts, not before the International Military Tribunal. They took place in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice. The twelve US trials are collectively known as the \"Subsequent Nuremberg trials\" or, more formally, as the \"Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals\" (NMT). ==The case== The Einsatzgruppen were SS mobile death squads, operating behind the front line in Nazi-occupied Eastern Europe. From 1941 to 1945, they murdered around 2 million people; 1.3 million Jews, up to 250,000 Romani, and around 500,000 so-called \"partisans\", people with disabilities, political commissars, Slavs, homosexuals and others. The 24 defendants in this trial were all commanders of these Einsatzgruppen units and faced the charges of war crime and crimes against humanity. The tribunal stated in its judgment: The judges in this case, heard before Military Tribunal II-A, were Michael Musmanno (presiding judge and Naval officer) from Pennsylvania, John J. Speight from Alabama, and Richard D. Dixon from North Carolina. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Telford Taylor; the Chief Prosecutor for this case was Benjamin B. Ferencz. The indictment was filed initially on July 3 and then amended on July 29, 1947 to also include the defendants Steimle, Braune, Haensch, Strauch, Klingelh\u00f6fer, and von Radetzky. The trial lasted from September 29, 1947 until April 10, 1948. ==Indictment== # Crimes against humanity through persecutions on political, racial, and religious grounds, murder, extermination, imprisonment, and other inhumane acts committed against civilian populations, including German nationals and nationals of other countries, as part of an organized scheme of genocide. # War crimes for the same reasons, and for wanton destruction and devastation not justified by military necessity. # Membership of criminal organizations, the SS, the Sicherheitsdienst (SD), or the Gestapo, which had been declared criminal organizations previously in the international Nuremberg Military Tribunals. All defendants were charged on all counts. All defendants pleaded \"not guilty\". The tribunal found all of them guilty on all counts, except R\u00fchl and Graf, who were found guilty only on count 3. ==Defendants== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Name !align=center|Photo !align=\"left\"|Function !align=\"left\"|Sentence !align=\"left\"|Outcome, 1951 amnesty |-valign = top |Otto Ohlendorf |75px |SS Gruppenf\u00fchrer; member of the SD; commanding officer of Einsatzgruppe D |Death by hanging |executed June 7, 1951\"Five death sentences were confirmed: the sentence against Oswald Pohl, as well as those passed against the leaders of the Mobile Killing Units, Paul Blobel, Werner Braune, Erich Neumann, and Otto Ohrlendorf. . . .
