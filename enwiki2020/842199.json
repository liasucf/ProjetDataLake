    "text": "Antoine Alexandre Brutus Bussy (29 May 1794, in Marseille \u2013 1 February 1882, in Paris) was a French chemist who primarily studied pharmaceuticals. == Education == Antoine Bussy entered the \u00c9cole Polytechnique in 1813, and there followed the courses delivered by Pierre Robiquet, the great French chemist who was to make decisive breakthroughs in bio-chemistry (he isolated the first amino-acid ever identified, asparagin, in 1805\u20131806), in industrial dyes (he isolated and identified alizarin, the most famous and first modern industrial red dye) and the pick-up of modern medication (he isolated, identified and started mass production of codeine, 1832). Robiquet tutored Antoine Bussy in his career as a chemist researcher and in his private career as pharmacist as well. In 1831 Antoine Bussy published the 'M\u00e9moire sur le Radical m\u00e9tallique de la Magn\u00e9sie' where he described a method of preparing magnesium by heating magnesium chloride and potassium in a glass tube. When the potassium chloride was washed out, small globules of magnesium remained. == Notes and references == Category:French chemists Category:1794 births Category:1882 deaths Category:\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni Category:19th-century French people Category:19th-century chemists Category:Members of the French Academy of Sciences ",
