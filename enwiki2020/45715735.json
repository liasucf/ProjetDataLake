    "text": "Koroga, or Koroga, is a uniquely Kenyan style of dining outdoors on (nominally) Indian cuisine. The word means mix or stir in Kiswahili, and koroga is precisely what diners do for themselves with a bounty of chopped ingredients and spices. A bit like camping in the city, parties situate themselves in semi-private huts each outfitted with a charcoal-burning jiko (stove). Despite the rustic elements, diners enjoy a full bar with table service ready-to-order starters. As the process of cooking (with chicken curry being the most popular entree) takes several hours, and Koroga dinners are known to grow tipsy while they cook\u2014or watch. While in the 1980s Sahara City became another popular place the ones that are popular now are many including Spice Roots, Curry in Hurry, Nairobi Gymkhana and Goan Gymkhana. There now a new place called Shooting Star in Parklands that even offers chicken flown in daily from Kisumu. These are popularly known as \"road runners\", as they are free range, and take a while to cook due to the lean meat. While everyone seems to agree that Karoga is not an imported concept, descriptions of where and when the now-commercial dining style developed are mixed. A manager at the Mystique Gardens from western Kenya suggests that Karoga began in Kenya centuries ago with families cooking fresh fish for themselves on the banks of Lake Victoria. According to him, Karoga has only existed as-such in cities for approximately five years. According to others it started as a result of Indian railway workers. For it to be a true Koroga, Nish Lakhani should be present. Nish is a terrible Koroga chef himself, but adds ingredients willingly regardless and provides entertainment by insulting any mzungus present and taking over the music system. Nish can be found in his own bar in Karen, when they are open; public bars in Karen or at one of his friends bars. You can ask anyone in Karen for directions. Koroga became popular in the 1980s when Nairobian's started to the Bowling Green Restaurant in the City Park and were introduced to self cooking at a commercial place. Before that groups would meet at a friends house with one or two of them cooking while others would enjoy the weekly gathering. ==References== Category:Indian cuisine outside India Category:Kenyan cuisine ",
