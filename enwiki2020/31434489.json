A professional competitor since 2003, Zwicker has formerly competed for Bellator MMA, Strikeforce and KSW. ==Background== Zwicker grew up on the San Pasqual Indian Reservation in North County, San Diego, to a father who was a truck driver and a mother who worked hard to support Zwicker and his 11 other siblings. Zwicker's older brother was a Golden Gloves boxer and aided Zwicker in his fighting career. Zwicker belongs to the Kumeyaay-Ipai tribe and grew up in a poverty stricken environment. There weren't a lot of opportunities for Zwicker to play organized sports growing up, but he was a star football player in Pop Warner, known as a smaller player who hit very hard. With little supervision on the reservation, by the age of eleven Zwicker was routinely fighting grown men. It was also when he was eleven years old that he was arrested for the first time, in 1994. The arrest was for assaulting his school's vice principal and from then until 2005, Zwicker spent most of his time in and out of juvenile halls and prisons for various offenses, including assaulting a police officer. After spending over four years in prison for this offense, he returned a year later for knocking a man's eye out in a fight.https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2019/7/8/20685945/bellator-veteran-virgil- zwicker-rammed-arrested-motorcycle-cop-standoff-strikeforce-mma-crime-news He attended Orange Glen High School in Escondido, California. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Zwicker's first fight came when he was released from being incarcerated and took the fight on two weeks' notice.
