Baglietto also owned a furniture store in Elg\u00f3ibar. At the time of his murder, he had two children aged 9 and 13, and he also was city councillor of Azcoitia as was his sister, Nieves. On May 12, 1980, he was leaving Elg\u00f3ibar in his Seat 127 when a Seat 131, occupied by K\u00e1ndido Azpiazu Beristain and Jos\u00e9 Ignacio Zuazolazigorraga Larra\u00f1aga, pulled up next to him, and the two shot him with a machine gun and a pistol. Ramon's vehicle crashed and became embedded in a tree, and Azpiazu got out of the Seat 131 and killed Baglietto with a shot in the head. The terrorists fled and abandoned the vehicle, but the two murderers, along with three other individuals, were arrested days later by the security forces. K\u00e1ndido Azpiazu was sentenced to 49 years and two months in prison, but in 1990 was granted parole. Azpiazu bought a store and set up a glassware shop in the basement of the Azcoitia building where the widow and the two sons of Baglietto were currently living. The widow of Baglietto, Pilar El\u00edas, joined the People\u00b4s party lists for the municipal elections, and was a councillor in the municipality of Azcoitia from 1995 until 2011. Ramon's sister, Nieves Baglietto, left the Basque Country after receiving threats from violent groups. == Bibliography == * MERINO, A., CHAPA, A., Ra\u00edces de Libertad. pp. 47\u201357.
