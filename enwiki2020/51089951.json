Christy Lemire reviewing for Roger Ebert's website gave the film one-and-a-half stars on the basis that the film \"makes the repeated mistake of banging us over the head with its running gags and needlessly spelling everything out, making the movie feel longer than its 81 minutes,\" and summarizing that \"These are indeed moms, and they do have dinner, but the \u201cfun\u201d part is in short supply.\" The A.V. Club gave the film a \"C\" grade calling the film uninspired, and \"undeniably disappointing when a movie called Fun Mom Dinner isn\u2019t, well, much fun.\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
