    "text": "Eliane Chantal Karp-Toledo is a Peruvian anthropologist, ex-First Lady of Peru, and the wife of the ex-president of Peru, Alejandro Toledo. She specializes in the study of Andean indigenous cultures. == Family and education == === Early life === Eliane Chantal Karp-Toledo was born on September 24, 1953 in Paris to Charles Karp (Polish) and Eva Rose Fernenburg (Belgian).Don\u2019t cry for me, Peru \u2013 Israel News, Ynetnews. Ynetnews.com (1995-06-20). Retrieved on 2013-02-15. Her father, Charles Karp (a Jewish descendant) was persecuted by Gestapo and then he became part of the French resistance. She completed her baccalaureate at the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais in Brussels. === Education === Karp earned her Bachelor of Arts in anthropology at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, specializing in Latin American studies. She also holds a Master of Arts in anthropology from Stanford University. Karp also completed doctoral studies in anthropology at Stanford. Karp has taken courses on indigenous communities at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, and has done graduate work on anthropology and economic development at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru. === Family life === At Stanford, she met Alejandro Toledo, whom she married in 1972. Karp first came to Peru in the late 1970s to study its indigenous communities. In 1992 Karp and Toledo divorced and she returned to Israel with their daughter. The couple remarried and returned to Peru before her husband's 1995 campaign. == Career == In 1980, she began working for international organizations such as OAS, UNICEF and UNDP where she conducted impact measurement studies for development projects on indigenous populations. In 1982 she served at the Agency for International Development (USAID) based in Lima, where she was a consultant until 1987. Since November 1987 she started working at the World Bank in Washington D.C. as a project officer for Latin America and Africa until 1992. Karp also served as an officer for Middle East in European Investment Bank. Karp returned to Israel, and worked at Bank Leumi, where she was in charge of developing relationships with foreign banks. === Academic career === Karp recently served as an adjunct professor at the Elliott School of International Affairs at the George Washington University. She is also a former Visiting Professor and Visiting Scholar at Stanford University department of Anthropology. Karp was a distinguished fellow in residence at Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford University and has also been a visiting professor at Salamanca University - Instituto de Iberoam\u00e9rica. ==Political contributions== During her husband's 2001 presidential bid, Karp contributed to a campaign which drew deeply on Toledo's indigenous heritage. She donned traditional Andean costume, rallied voters in Quechua, and demonstrated the couple's commitment to indigenous issues. According to The New York Times, \"her flaming red hair and fiery speeches made her a popular and controversial fixture at campaign rallies.\" In 2001, Karp became the first lady of the Republic of Peru when Toledo was elected president, a position she held until 2006. While in office, Karp became the honorary president of the Fund for the Development of Indigenous Communities of Latin America and the Caribbean.Latin America and the Caribbean's Indigenous People and Afro-descendents: Sociodemographic Information, Retrieved May 25, 2012 === CONAPA === Shortly after Toledo's inauguration, his administration created the National Commission on Andean, Amazon and Afro-Peruvian Communities (CONAPA) of Peru, of which Karp served as president. The agency was meant to establish a development agenda for indigenous communities, provide representation of indigenous interests within the government, and lead the way to constitutional reforms that benefit indigenous peoples. Others lamented the commission's ineffectiveness. Noting its lack of funding and of implementing powers, Diana Vindling called it \"no more than a space for dialogue.\"The Indigenous World 2002\u20132003, Diana Vinding, Retrieved May 30, 2011 On the other hand, Oxfam's Martin Scurrah points out that the agency did good work. Noting that in addition to promoting a chapter on indigenous rights in the new constitution, Eliane Karp \"intervened on numerous occasions in support of or in defense of indigenous initiatives.\"Making Indigenous Citizens, Maria Elena Garcia, 2005, Retrieved May 30, 2011 Some critics viewed the very creation of the commission as a step backwards for indigenous Peruvians, noting its leadership by a person with no official government position rather than a ministry head. The commission also absorbed the former SETAI (office of indigenous affairs), which reportedly led to a loss of autonomy and dynamism for that agency. Others complained that Karp's leadership of the commission represented a conflict of interest, given her involvement in her own private NGO, Fundaci\u00f3n Pacha. In 2003, partly in response to these criticisms, Karp resigned from CONAPA, which was subsequently restructured as a national institute rather than a commission.Beyond Neoliberalism in Latin America? John Burdich et al, Retrieved June 1, 2011 === Machu Picchu Artifacts === Throughout Toledo's presidency, Karp participated in negotiations with Yale University for the return to Peru of over 350 indigenous artifacts. The museum pieces were excavated from Machu Picchu around 1915 and sent to Yale on a twelve-month loan. On this matter, Peru had the support of the National Geographic Society and Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Negotiations stalled when the university refused to acknowledge Peru as the sole owner of the artifacts, but resumed under the Garc\u00eda presidency. In a New York Times op-ed, Karp accused Yale of waiting out \"Peru\u2019s first elected indigenous president, until Peru had a new leader who is frankly hostile to indigenous matters.\" She also criticized the agreement between Peru and Yale that was finally arrived at in 2008. Under the terms of this agreement, Peru would have to build a museum and research center near Machu Picchu to Yale's specifications before it could receive a portion of the articles for display and study. Most of the artifacts would remain with Yale. === Pacha Foundation for a Change === In 2001, Karp started Fundaci\u00f3n Pacha, a non-profit organization that oversees development projects for indigenous Peruvians. The foundation \"places special emphasis on the design of sustainable development projects based on traditional and communal organizations and the development of productive skills to promote the comparative economic advantages of the Peruvian biodiversity and its rich potential for ecotourism.\" Karp remained the head of the organization until 2006. Pacha's micro projects have included giving Amazonian peoples vaccinations against yellow fever, hepatitis B and malaria, building basic community institutions, and providing equipment for basic medical care centers in rural areas with indigenous populations.:. Eliane Karp \u2013 Toledo . Elianekarptoledo.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-15. In 2002 Karp reached out to billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates in order to fund a vaccination program for the Candoshi tribes people. Gates was unwilling to help, and instead began humanitarian aid efforts in Africa and China. Since then Karp has criticized Gates for his unwillingness to help and acknowledges she felt it unfair to ignore Peru when conditions in rural Peru are just as dire as in other impoverished areas. ==Current activities== Karp has publicly opposed the Garcia administration for its failure to uphold Indepa, and its continued alienation of the indigenous people. She has also shown support in favor of a push for more women in the Peruvian congress, and she acknowledges quotas as a means of achieving this. In March 2012 Karp returned to Peru to pursue a teaching position at the Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, and in the fall she returned to teach anthropology in the Andean studies postgraduate program. She has also announced she will undertake a book which examines the role of indigenous populations as they integrate into the democratic political process. In May 2012 Karp participated in a human rights conference organized by the Program on Human Rights and the Center for Latin American Studies of Stanford University, in which she called for a debate about the rights of indigenous peoples in Peru. Karp expressed \"We propose that social inclusion and equal citizenship are key factors for good governance... The indigenous worldview has to be respected and integrated in public policies.\" In October 2012 Karp recounted her meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi, saying that it was inspiring and that she was impressed that Suu Kyi was able to stay so calm while being imprisoned for 15 years. Karp likened the situation to when she met the Dalai Lama, who is living in exile, and urged support for a petition going through the United Nations to help combat human rights violations. == Publications == ===Books=== *Karp de Toledo, Eliane.
