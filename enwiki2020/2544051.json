As the official name was difficult for the locals to pronounce, people were referring the city as ad\u0131 yaman since early 19th century, which means \"its name is tough\" or \"(the place) whose name is tough\" in Turkish. Another likely origin of the modern Turkish name is the bad reputation that the province enjoyed due to difficult terrain and widespread banditry, hence \"ad\u0131 yaman\", which can also translate as \"(the place) which has a bad name (reputation)\". In 1926, this term was adopted as the official name of the city. Although the word yaman had very negative connotations in Ottoman Turkish, it has earned a strong positive connotation in modern Turkish, just like the English word \"terrific\". ==History== Ruins of Perre Yenipinar Mosque The area has been inhabited as far back as it is possible to discover. Research in the cave of Palanl\u0131 10 km north of Ad\u0131yaman show occupation in 40,000 BC and other digs in Samsat reveal continuous occupation through the stone and Bronze Ages. From 900BC onwards came waves of invasions from Assyrians, Persians, and Macedonians until the Greco-Iranian Commagene kingdom was founded in 69BC. This was the civilisation that built the statues on top of nearby Mount Nemrut. The capital was in Samsat (Samosata) but the town of Ad\u0131yaman was a walled city of the Commagenes. The city walls of Ad\u0131yaman have been restored and replaced many times since. The Commagene kingdom lasted until the Romans came in 72AD. Yet more campaigns and invasions followed and Ad\u0131yaman was controlled by Byzantines 395\u2013670, Ummayads from 670 and then Abbasids 758\u2013926. Then the area returned to Byzantine control during 859\u20131114. The Arabs returned from 1114 to 1204 and finally came the arrival of the Turks. The Arabic name for the castle and town was H\u0131sn-\u0131 Mansur. Turks moved into the area from 1114 onwards and for most of the 13th century was settled by the Sel\u00e7uk Turks often disrupted by Mongol invasions. From 1298 to 1516 the town was under the control of the Mameluks. Ad\u0131yaman was brought into the Ottoman Empire by Selim I in 1516, but local power often rested with the Dulkadiro\u011fullar\u0131 tribe of Turkmen people that settled here.
