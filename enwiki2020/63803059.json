Legacy also directly sells homes through 13 retail stores and funds loans for their homes. Legacy Housing was founded in 2005 by Curtis D. Hodgson (chairman of the board) and Kenneth E. Shipley (president and CEO) as Legacy Housing, Ltd. It is traded on NASDAQ as LEGH, after an IPO on December 14 2018. The company repurchased over $3 million in stock in April 2019. The company has approximately 800 employees. In 2019 the company's gross revenue was $169 million, versus $162 million in 2018. Approximately half of their sales are in Texas. Their consumer (chattel) loan portfolio was worth $105 million at an average APR of 14%. They also had $92.3 million in manufactured home park loans at variable rates, typically 4% over prime. In 2018-2019, Legacy acquired five plots of land to develop into manufactured home communities, including 400 acres near Austin, Texas for $4.4 million in April 2018. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in April 2020, Legacy announced a $25 million addition to their credit line, then announced receiving $6.5 million in federally backed small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program. The company received scrutiny over this loan, which was aimed at small businesses. Legacy Homes returned the loan a day after the New York Times story broke. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Manufactured home manufacturers ",
