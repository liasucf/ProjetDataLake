    "text": "The 1983 Football League Cup Final was a football match held on 26 March 1983 between League Cup holders Liverpool and first-time finalists Manchester United, who won the FA Cup later that year. Liverpool won the match 2\u20131; Norman Whiteside scored the opener for Manchester United, before Alan Kennedy equalised with 15 minutes to go. The winner was scored in the eighth minute of extra-time by Ronnie Whelan. Had Manchester United won the League Cup as well as the FA Cup that year, they would have become the first team ever to have won the two competitions in the same season. Instead, Liverpool won their third successive League Cup, and the second of three successive League and League Cup Doubles. The match was played at Wembley Stadium in front of approximately 100,000 spectators. Liverpool manager Bob Paisley collected the trophy, as it was his last major final in charge of Liverpool. ==Match details== {| width=92% |- | | |} {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Bruce Grobbelaar |- |RB ||2 || Phil Neal |- |LB ||3 || Alan Kennedy |- |CB ||4 || Mark Lawrenson |- |LM ||5 || Ronnie Whelan |- |CB ||6 || Alan Hansen |- |CF ||7 || Kenny Dalglish |- |RM ||8 || Sammy Lee |- |CF ||9 || Ian Rush |- |CM ||10|| Craig Johnston || || |- |CM ||11|| Graeme Souness (c) |- |colspan=4|Substitute: |- |FW ||12|| David Fairclough || || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Bob Paisley |} |valign=\"top\"|300px |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Gary Bailey |- |RB ||2 || Mike Duxbury |- |LB ||3 || Arthur Albiston |- |CM ||4 || Remi Moses |- |CB ||5 || Kevin Moran || || |- |CB ||6 || Gordon McQueen |- |CM ||7 || Ray Wilkins (c) |- |LM ||8 || Arnold M\u00fchren |- |CF ||9 || Frank Stapleton |- |CF ||10|| Norman Whiteside |- |RM ||11|| Steve Coppell |- |colspan=4|Substitute: |- |FW ||12|| Lou Macari || || |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Ron Atkinson |} |} {| width=100% style=\"font-size: 90%\" | width=50% valign=top| Match rules *90 minutes. *30 minutes of extra-time if necessary. *Replay if scores still level. *One named substitute. *Maximum of one substitution. |} ==External links== * Match details and Liverpool line-up * Details of Paisley collecting the trophy 1983 League Cup Final 1983 League Cup Final 1983 Category:1982\u201383 Football League Football League Cup Final Football League Cup Final ",
