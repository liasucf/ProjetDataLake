He undertook a late DPhil at the Oxford University Computing Laboratory (now the Oxford University Department of Computer Science) under Tony Hoare, awarded in 1981. He also worked with Dines Bj\u00f8rner and others on the Vienna Development Method (VDM) at IBM Laboratory Vienna. Cliff Jones was a professor at the Victoria University of Manchester in the 1980s and early 1990s, worked in industry at Harlequin for a period, and is now a Professor of Computing Science at Newcastle University. He has been Editor-in-Chief of the Formal Aspects of Computing journal. As well as formal methods, Jones also has interests in interdisciplinary aspects of computer science and the history of computer science.Cliff B. Jones: Publication List, Scientific Commons.
