    "text": "Brian Patrick Roche (born 1 July 1974) is an Irish former rugby union player and coach. ==Career== From Togher, Cork, Roche grew up playing hurling for St. Finbarr's, before a clubman from Highfield suggested that he try rugby union. A promising start to his rugby career, combined with his hurling career, in which he had won selection for the Cork minors panel, meant Roche had to choose between the two sports, and he chose rugby, joining Sundays Well in his early 20s. After one season with the club, at a time when rugby union was turning professional, Roche was approached to join English side Bath on trial, but he initially rejected the offer. When Bath returned with an offer of a professional contract, Roche then accepted, and moved across the Irish Sea to join the club, which included famous players such as Jeremy Guscott, Ieuan Evans and Mike Catt. As Welsh winger Evans was away on his honeymoon, Roche got a run in the Bath starting XV, and featured prominently during the 1997\u201398 Heineken Cup pool stage, though he wasn't involved in the 1998 Heineken Cup Final, in which Bath defeated French club Brive 19\u201318. Despite this, Roche was still presented with a winners medal by Bath, making him the first Irishman to win a Heineken Cup medal. He then returned to Ireland and won selection for Munster, moving to Limerick and joining Shannon in the All-Ireland League. He remained with the province for the remainder of the 1998\u201399 season, but was then dropped. After being dropped, Roche returned to his roots, playing intermediate football for St. Finbarr's, before returning to Highfield and captaining the side to a league championship in 2004. He also went into coaching, earning a level two badge with the IRFU and a fitness qualification, going on to work with St. Finbarr's, Highfield, University College Cork A.F.C. in the Munster Senior League, and the Cork senior hurling team. ==References== ==External links== *Munster Profile * *Bath Profile Category:Living people Category:1974 births Category:Rugby union players from County Cork Category:Dual players Category:St. Finbarr's hurlers Category:Association footballers from County Cork Category:Irish rugby union players Category:Cork Constitution players Category:Sundays Well RFC players Category:Shannon RFC players Category:Bath Rugby players Category:Munster Rugby players Category:Rugby union fullbacks Category:Rugby union wings ",
