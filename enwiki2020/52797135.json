Voters chose three representatives, or electors, to the Electoral College, who voted for president and vice president. ==Background== Nevada was coming off a landslide win by incumbent Mike O'Callaghan in the 1974 gubernatorial election over a severely divided oppositionMalcolm, Andrew H.; \u2018Woman, 39, Wins the Republican Primary for Governor in Nevada: G. O. P. House Winner\u2019; The New York Times, September 5, 1974, p. 27 and anger over the Watergate scandal.Broder, David S.; \u2018Nationwide Sweep Nets 6 Governors, Over 30 in House: Democrats Solidify Control Of Congress, State Capitols\u2019; The Washington Post, November 6, 1974, p. A1Broder, David; \u2018Democrats savor nationwide gains: Albert calls vote a mandate\u2019; The Boston Globe, November 7, 1974, p. 1 However, veteran Democratic Senator Alan Bible, who had survived Richard Nixon\u2019s 1968 victory, retired and was replaced by Republican Paul Laxalt who won a narrow victory at the same time the GOP were suffering landslide losses in other races. This presidential election saw Nevada hold its first ever presidential primary, won by California Governor Jerry Brown,Winchester, Simon; \u2018Jimmy Carter takes a tumble on his trip to Wild West\u2019; The Guardian, 27 May 1976, p. 2 who had only entered the primaries two weeks beforehand after most were already conducted.\u2018Jerry-Come-Lately\u2019, The New York Times, May 11, 1976, p. 32 Senator Paul Laxalt, who had supported Ford's rival Ronald Reagan in the Republican primaries earlier in 1976, nonetheless campaigned vigorously for Ford once he won the GOP nomination.\u2018The West\u2019; The Boston Globe, October 31, 1976, p. 48 Consequently, despite the state having not voted against a winning Democratic nominee since 1892 and not for a losing Republican nominee since James G. Blaine in 1884, early October polls gave the state provisionally to Ford, with the lack of familiarity with Southern Evangelical Carter being viewed as a critical factor.\u2018State by State:: A Nationwide Survey\u2019; The Washington Post, October 3, 1976, p. 36 Two days before Nevada's voters were to enter the polls Ford remained a slight favorite. ==Vote== Nevada was won by incumbent President Gerald Ford (R\u2013Michigan), with 50.17% of the popular vote, against Jimmy Carter (D\u2013Georgia), with 45.81% of the popular vote. None of the third- party candidates amounted to a significant portion of the vote, as 2.53% of the voters either wrote-in another candidate or selected \u201cno preference\u201d. Despite losing in Nevada, Carter went on to win the national election and became the 39th president of the United States. Nevada has generally been a bellwether state since the early 20th century, and this election marked the first time since 1908 whereby Nevada was carried by the losing presidential candidate. Nevada would vote for the winning candidate in each election afterwards until 2016. , this is the last election in which a Democrat won the White House without Nevada, as well as the last time that Nye County, Storey County, and Esmeralda County voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate.Sullivan, Robert David; \u2018How the Red and Blue Map Evolved Over the Past Century\u2019; America Magazine in The National Catholic Review; June 29, 2016 ==Results== ===Results by county=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\" rowspan=\"2\" |County or City ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Gerald Rudolph FordOur Campaigns; NV US President 1976 Republican ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| James Earl Carter Democratic ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| No Candidate No Preference ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | Roger Lea MacBride Libertarian ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\" | Lester Garfield Maddox American Independent ! style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"| Margin ! colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\" | Total votes cast |- ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| # ! style=\"text- align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| % ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data- sort-type=\"number\"| # ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| % ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| # ! style=\"text- align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| % ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data- sort-type=\"number\"| # ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| % ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| # ! style=\"text- align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| % ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data- sort-type=\"number\"| # ! style=\"text-align:center;\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| % |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Churchill | | 2,358 | | 53.04% | | 1,800 | | 40.49% | | 178 | | 4.00% | | 33 | | 0.74% | | 77 | | 1.73% | | 558 | | 12.55% | | 4,446 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Clark | | 48,236 | | 46.92% | | 51,178 | | 49.78% | | 2,015 | | 1.96% | | 731 | | 0.71% | | 652 | | 0.63% | | -2,942 | | -2.86% | | 102,812 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Douglas | | 3,095 | | 58.60% | | 1,934 | | 36.61% | | 162 | | 3.07% | | 46 | | 0.87% | | 45 | | 0.85% | | 1,161 | | 21.98% | | 5,282 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Elko | | 3,293 | | 60.32% | | 1,955 | | 35.81% | | 103 | | 1.89% | | 40 | | 0.73% | | 68 | | 1.25% | | 1,338 | | 24.51% | | 5,459 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | | Esmeralda | | 181 | | 43.51% | | 214 | | 51.44% | | 9 | | 2.16% | | 3 | | 0.72% | | 9 | | 2.16% | | -33 | | -7.93% | | 416 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Eureka | | 272 | | 58.24% | | 163 | | 34.90% | | 21 | | 4.50% | | 5 | | 1.07% | | 6 | | 1.28% | | 109 | | 23.34% | | 467 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Humboldt | | 1,380 | | 53.38% | | 1,074 | | 41.55% | | 88 | | 3.40% | | 14 | | 0.54% | | 29 | | 1.12% | | 306 | | 11.84% | | 2,585 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Lander | | 561 | | 49.96% | | 518 | | 46.13% | | 21 | | 1.87% | | 8 | | 0.71% | | 15 | | 1.34% | | 43 | | 3.83% | | 1,123 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Lincoln | | 700 | | 50.04% | | 642 | | 45.89% | | 34 | | 2.43% | | 10 | | 0.71% | | 13 | | 0.93% | | 58 | | 4.15% | | 1,399 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Lyon | | 2,068 | | 49.69% | | 1,866 | | 44.83% | | 155 | | 3.72% | | 27 | | 0.65% | | 46 | | 1.11% | | 202 | | 4.85% | | 4,162 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Mineral | | 1,104 | | 42.56% | | 1,361 | | 52.47% | | 92 | | 3.55% | | 8 | | 0.31% | | 29 | | 1.12% | | -257 | | -9.91% | | 2,594 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Nye | | 1,027 | | 42.53% | | 1,261 | | 52.22% | | 84 | | 3.48% | | 18 | | 0.75% | | 25 | | 1.04% | | -234 | | -9.69% | | 2,415 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Pershing | | 635 | | 46.93% | | 633 | | 46.78% | | 59 | | 4.36% | | 13 | | 0.96% | | 13 | | 0.96% | | 2 | | 0.15% | | 1,353 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Storey | | 274 | | 43.08% | | 310 | | 48.74% | | 30 | | 4.72% | | 17 | | 2.67% | | 5 | | 0.79% | | -36 | | -5.66% | | 636 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Washoe | | 29,264 | | 54.98% | | 21,687 | | 40.74% | | 1,599 | | 3.00% | | 374 | | 0.70% | | 303 | | 0.57% | | 7,577 | | 14.24% | | 53,227 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | | White Pine | | 1,543 | | 41.27% | | 2,009 | | 53.73% | | 91 | | 2.43% | | 17 | | 0.45% | | 79 | | 2.11% | | -466 | | -12.46% | | 3,739 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | | Carson City | | 5,282 | | 54.11% | | 3,874 | | 39.69% | | 367 | | 3.76% | | 155 | | 1.59% | | 83 | | 0.85% | | 1,408 | | 14.42% | | 9,761 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" !Totals!!101,273!!50.17%!!92,479!!45.81%!!5,108!!2.53%!!1,519!!0.75%!!1,497!!0.74%!!8,794!!4.36%!!201,876 |} ==Notes== ==References== Nevada 1976 Category:1976 Nevada elections Category:1976 in Nevada ",
