It is the second oldest porcelain manufacturer in Germany that still operates on its original site. From 1888, the operation was turned into a public limited company (Aktiengesellschaft). In 1966, the firm became a limited liability company (GmbH) with its parent company, Braunschweig GmbH, and therefore a 100 per cent subsidiary of NORD/LB. Its current managing director is Stephanie Saalfeld. == Museum == The Weser Renaissance castle, high above the River Weser, goes back to a medieval fort from the 13th century (first mentioned around 1355) and was converted into a hunting lodge around 1600 by Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. Until 1972, china was produced in the castle itself, but now, manufacturing is carried out in the adjacent, modern buildings. Today, the castle houses the firm's museum and gives an overview of production from its beginnings during the rococo period to the present day. Other notable collections of F\u00fcrstenberg china may be seen in the North German museums at Brunswick, Schwerin and Wolfenb\u00fcttel, as well as in Weimar. == See also == *Porcelain manufacturing companies in Europe == Sources == * Karin Annette M\u00f6ller: Porzellan aus F\u00fcrstenberg, Katalog, Schwerin 2002, * Beatrix Freifrau Wolff Metternich u.a.: Die Porzellanmanufaktur F\u00fcrstenberg, 2 B\u00e4nde, Prestel-Verlag, 2004 == External links == * Official website * * Category:German porcelain Category:Museums in Lower Saxony Porzellanmanufaktur Furstenberg Category:Holzminden (district) Category:China manufacturers of Germany Category:Decorative arts museums in Germany Category:Ceramics museums ",
