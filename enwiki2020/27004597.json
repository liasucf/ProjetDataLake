    "text": "Semington Halt railway station was the railway station serving Semington in Wiltshire, England. The station was on the Devizes Branch Line, in between Holt Junction and Seend. == Opening == Semington Halt station opened in 1857 for the residents of Semington, during a time when the Great Western Railway was increasing the number of halts in the South West. After completion of the eastern section of track, the Devizes line was a main line from London to Bristol, which meant passing through Semington. However the Devizes line lost to competition and returned to a branch line in 1900. == Closure == Semington Halt suffered from reduced traffic after the completion of the Stert and Westbury Railway that bypassed the Devizes branch line in order to reduce the London to Bristol distance by five miles. The entire branch line was closed in 1966 under the Beeching cuts and the halt was destroyed in 1970, along with the rest of the line. The site of the station is now a private residence. == See also == * Devizes Branch Line * Devizes Station == References == * * * Category:Disused railway stations in Wiltshire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1857 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:Beeching closures in England Category:1857 establishments in England ",
