In 2016, she and her UCI colleague Carroll Seron served as editors of a special issue of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science about prison realignment in California. ==Research== Kubrin's research focuses on, among other topics, the relationship between race, violence, and social disorganization theory. She has also researched the perception of rap music as violent and dangerous, as well as whether a rapper's music can be used as evidence against him in a court of law. With Graham Ousey, she has also studied the relationship between immigration and crime in the United States, finding that immigration is related to lower rates of crime and violence in U.S. neighborhoods. Kubrin has stated that the Public Safety Realignment initiative was not a factor in the 2019 California stabbing rampage. ==References== ==External links== *Faculty page * * Category:University of California, Irvine faculty Category:Living people Category:American criminologists Category:University of Washington alumni Category:Smith College alumni Category:George Washington University faculty Category:American women social scientists Category:Women criminologists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
