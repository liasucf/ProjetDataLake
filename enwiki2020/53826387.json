    "text": "LHS 1140 is a red dwarf in the constellation of Cetus. Based on its stellar properties, it is thought to be about 41 light-years away from the Sun. 'LHS' refers to the Luyten Half-Second Catalogue of stars with proper motions exceeding half a second of arc annually.Luyten, Willem Jacob, Catalogue of stars with proper motions exceeding 0\"5 annually, University of Minnesota, 1979 The star is over 5 billion years old and has 15% of the mass of the Sun. LHS 1140's rotational period is 130 days. No flares have been observed. ==Planetary system== As of Jan. 2019, LHS 1140 is known to have two confirmed rocky planets orbiting it, and a third candidate planet not yet confirmed. The first to be discovered was LHS 1140 b, discovered by the MEarth Project in 2017 using the transit method. Follow-up radial velocities were measured by the High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher instrument to confirm the planet and measure the mass. The planet LHS 1140b is a super-Earth in the habitable zone and transits the star every 24.7 days. This should allow its atmosphere to be studied in future: the combination of the transiting super- Earth and the relatively small and nearby host star make this system one of the most promising known for atmosphere studies, along with the TRAPPIST-1 system. The mass of LHS 1140b is about 7 times Earth's, and its radius about 1.7 times as large, giving it a density of about 7.5 g/cm3, compared to Earth's 5.5 g/cm3. In July 2018, Feng et al. published a reanalysis of the radial velocity data for LHS 1140, and proposed the likely existence of two additional planets: an inner Earth-mass planet orbiting every 3.8 days and an outer Neptune-mass planet orbiting every 90 days. The orbital period of the planet outer planet LHS 1140 d was refined to 78 days in 2020. In August 2018, Ment et al., using the transit method of detection, confirmed the existence of the inner planet LHS 1140 c with a mass about 1.8 times Earth's and a radius 1.3 times as large, giving it a density of about 5 g/cm3.\"A second planet with an Earth-like composition orbiting the nearby M dwarf LHS 1140\".
