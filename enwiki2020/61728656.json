It is the headquarters of Lincolnshire County Council. ==History== The frontage of Newland House, a Grade II listed building, which forms part of the northern elevation of the northern quadrangle In the late 19th century and early 20th century meetings of Lindsey County Council were held at County Hall, Lincoln Castle. After deciding the old county hall was inadequate for their needs, county leaders chose to procure a new county headquarters: the site selected they selected was the substantial grounds of a house known as Newland House which had been designed by William Hayward in the classical style and completed in 1824. Council officials purchased the estate from the executors of the local coal merchant, William John Warrener. Construction started with the demolition of everything except the original facade of Newland House in 1926. The new building was designed by Scorer and Gamble in a Neo-Georgian style and was officially opened by the chairman of the county council, George Edward Heneage, 2nd Baron Heneage, in 1932. The new structure was built around two quadrangles. The first phase was the northern facade and quadrangle (which incorporated the original facade of Newland House) and the second phase was the southern facade and quadrangle which was built with red brick and innovative concrete dressings. The third phase involved inserting an Art Deco staircase into Newland House.Lincoln City Building applications. 6219, 8 February 1926; 6863 18 November 1930, 7136, 21 August 1933 The design for the main building involved a symmetrical main frontage with fifteen bays facing onto Newland with the end bays slighted projected forwards; the central section featured a portico with paired Doric Order columns and balustraded parapet; there were sash windows on the first and second floors with a stone surround which extended to both floors. Internally, the principal room was the council chamber. Pevsner described the building as \"all somewhat dry and academic\". Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1972, the building became the headquarters of the newly-created Lincolnshire County Council in 1974. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Grade II listed buildings in Lincolnshire L Category:Government buildings completed in 1932 ",
