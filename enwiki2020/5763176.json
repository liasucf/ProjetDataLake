    "text": "The Metropolitanos of Havana was a baseball team in the Cuban National Series. The Metros, also known as the Guerreros (Warriors), had historically been a poor team, though they were ostensibly the heir to the Habana teams of the pre-revolutionary Cuban League. ==Overview== It was one of two teams based in the city of Havana \u2013 the other being the more successful Industriales.
