    "text": "Manuel Blum (born 26 April 1938) is a Venezuelan-American computer scientist who received the Turing Award in 1995 \"In recognition of his contributions to the foundations of computational complexity theory and its application to cryptography and program checking\".ACM Turing Award Citation, retrieved 2010-01-24. ==Education== Blum was born to a Jewish family in Venezuela. Blum was educated at MIT, where he received his bachelor's degree and his master's degree in EECS in 1959 and 1961 respectively, and his Ph.D. in mathematics in 1964 supervised by Marvin Minsky.. ==Career== He worked as a professor of computer science at the University of California, Berkeley until 2001. From 2001 to 2018, he was the Bruce Nelson Professor of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where his wife, Lenore Blum, was also a professor of Computer Science. In 2002 he was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences. In 2018 he and his wife Lenore resigned from Carnegie Mellon University to protest against sexism after a change in management structure of Project Olympus led to sexist treatment of her as director and the exclusion of other women from project activities. ==Research== In the 60s he developed an axiomatic complexity theory which was independent of concrete machine models. The theory is based on G\u00f6del numberings and the Blum axioms. Even though the theory is not based on any machine model it yields concrete results like the compression theorem, the gap theorem, the honesty theorem and the Blum speedup theorem. Some of his other work includes a protocol for flipping a coin over a telephone, median of medians (a linear time selection algorithm), the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator, the Blum- Goldwasser cryptosystem, and more recently CAPTCHAs.Von Ahn, Luis; Blum, Manuel; Hopper, Nicholas J.; Langford, John (May 2003). \"CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security\". Proceedings of the International Conference on the Theory and Applications of Cryptographic Techniques (EUROCRYPT 2003). Blum is also known as the advisor of many prominent researchers. Among his Ph.D. students are Leonard Adleman, Dana Angluin, Shafi Goldwasser, Mor Harchol- Balter, Russell Impagliazzo, Silvio Micali, Gary Miller, Moni Naor, Steven Rudich, Michael Sipser, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Umesh Vazirani, Vijay Vazirani, Luis von Ahn, and Ryan Williams. == See also == *List of Venezuelans ==References== Category:American computer scientists Category:Theoretical computer scientists Category:1938 births Category:Living people Category:Jewish American scientists Category:International Association for Cryptologic Research fellows Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Engineering Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Turing Award laureates Category:Carnegie Mellon University faculty Category:UC Berkeley College of Engineering faculty Category:Venezuelan emigrants to the United States Category:Venezuelan Jews Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:20th-century American engineers Category:21st-century American engineers Category:20th-century American scientists Category:21st-century American scientists ",
