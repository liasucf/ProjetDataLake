    "text": "Chinese handball is a form of American handball popular on the streets of New York City, Philadelphia, and Bridgewater, New Jersey during the 1950s, '60s, '70s, and '80s and is still played today, mostly in New York City, Philadelphia, and San Diego. Different variations are played around the world. Its defining feature is that, unlike traditional handball, in Chinese or indirect handball, for a shot to be valid, the ball must hit the ground before it hits the wall. ==Origin of Name== The name \"Chinese\" handball is American in origin. Like the terms \"Chinese checkers\" or \"Chinese fire drill\", the name identifies it as an \"exotic\" or confusing variation on something more familiar to westerners. ==Popular culture== A 2010 PBS documentary, New York Street Games, shows people playing Ace-King-Queen. ==See also== *American handball *Australian Handball ==References== Category:Children's games Category:Street games Category:Ball games ",
