    "text": "Nano Comics (full name: Science Stories with a Smile) is a comic series published by the Weizmann Institute of Science.Nano Comics, \"Weizmann Wonder Wander\" website The series, edited by Yivsam Azgad, brings the story of five permanent heroes and five supporting characters working at a scientific research institute that exists, in fact, anywhere and at any time. The protagonist of the series is Nano, a 10-year-old boy whose parents have set out on a long journey through space, and he spends a lot of time in the workplace of his grandmother, who is the cook at the Institute's cafeteria. His natural curiosity leads Nano to engage in scientific adventures at the forefront of scientific research. The other heroes in the series are Femto, an adult senior scientist, with the mind of a child; Giga, a young and energetic multidisciplinary-scientist; Mega, a postdoctoral researcher who conceals the fact that he is a time traveler; Tera, a graphic designer working at the institute, who is often forced to remind her fellow scientists of the simple facts of life. The names of the five main nano-comic characters (Femto, Giga, Mega, Tera and Nano) were proposed by the eighth president of the Weizmann Institute of Science, Prof. Haim Harari. The nano comics move in space and time, exchanging places and cultures, and meeting scientists and their friends with Indians, Chinese, Eskimos, industrial spies and more. Each story has a \"scientific text-box\" that gives a few simple words about the scientific work on which the story is based. The dialogues of the characters were influenced by conversations between Azgad and poet Meir Goldberg. The first chapter in the series was published in 2006. In the early years, Yaniv Shimony painted the series.Yaniv Shimony - website After the retirement of Shimony, in 2010, from the project, the series was co-created by Dorit Maya Gur and Elit Avni Sharon \u2013 under the subtitle: \"The Second Generation.\" With the retirement of Gur and Avni Sharon (2015), Lee Zakai began to paint the series under the subtitle \"Third Generation\".
