His parents and wife, who are seeking justice, find help in their new neighbour Abhishek who is always in the right place at the right time. The narrative, which begins on a slow note, picks up pace towards the interval. One gets to know the identity of Abhishek in a scene that seems to be a tribute to some cult Abhishek Bhargav (Shiva Rajkumar) films. From there, the story shifts to Bihar and one gets to piece together the jigsaw puzzle. ==Cast== * Shiva Rajkumar as DCP Abhishek Bhargav (abhi) aka rustum * Vivek Oberoi as DCP Bharath Raj aka bharath * Shraddha Srinath as Anjana Abhishek Bhargav aka Anju * Rachita Ram as Rachana Bharath Raj Aka rachu * Mayuri Kyatari as Ammu, Bharath's sister * J.
