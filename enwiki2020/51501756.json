    "text": "Acetomepregenol (ACM), also known as mepregenol diacetate and sold under the brand name Diamol, is a progestin medication which is used in Russia for the treatment of gynecological conditions and as a method of birth control in combination with an estrogen. It has also been studied in the treatment of threatened abortion. It has been used in veterinary medicine as well.Bratanov, K., Bankov, N., Doichev, S., Pisheva, M., Klinskii, I. U., & Zhirkov, G.

Bratanov (otvet. red.)... i dr.].Zhirkov, G. F. (1981). Testing diamol on sheep on a fattening farm. Biulleten'nauchnykh rabot-Vsesoiuznyi nauchno- issledovatel'skii institut zhivotnovodstva. It has been marketed since at least 1981. ==Pharmacology== Based on its chemical structure, namely the lack of a C3 ketone, it is probable that acetomepregenol is a prodrug of megestrol acetate (the 3-keto analogue). ==Chemistry== Acetomepregenol, also known as megestrol 3\u03b2,17\u03b1-diacetate, as well as 3\u03b2-dihydro-6-dehydro-6-methyl-17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone diacetate or as 3\u03b2,17\u03b1-diacetoxy-6-methylpregna-4,6-dien-20-one, is a synthetic pregnane steroid and a derivative of progesterone and 17\u03b1-hydroxyprogesterone. It is very close to megestrol acetate (6-dehydro-6-methyl-17\u03b1-acetoxyprogesterone) in structure, except that there is a hydroxyl group with an acetate ester attached at the C3 position instead of a ketone. A closely related medication is cymegesolate (also known as megestrol 3\u03b2-cypionate 17\u03b1-acetate), which, in contrast, has not been marketed. ==References== Category:Acetate esters Category:Conjugated dienes Category:Ketones Category:Pregnanes Category:Prodrugs Category:Progestogen esters Category:Progestogens Category:Russian drugs Category:Veterinary drugs ",
