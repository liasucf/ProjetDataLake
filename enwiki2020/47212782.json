It is a single-story Craftsman style structure, with an irregular layout focused on a gable-roofed rectangular core. A small single-story gabled wing extends to the right, and the entry porch projects forward from the left side of the front facade, with a gable roof that has exposed rafters and is supported by decorative braces on tall brick piers. It was built in 1915, originally at Walnut and High Streets, for one of the community's early doctors. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Searcy County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1915 Category:Houses in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Searcy County, Arkansas ",
