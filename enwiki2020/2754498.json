    "text": "Florendo R. \"Renren\" Ritualo Jr. (born June 14, 1979) is a Filipino former professional basketball player and current coach. He last played for the Shopinas.com Clickers of the Philippine Basketball Association and is currently an assistant coach for the Adamson Falcons in the UAAP. Nicknamed Ren-Ren and The Rainman, Ritualo was also a one-time member of the Philippine National Team, and is the son of former PBA player Florendo Ritualo Sr. and Maria Yaso\u00f1a de Ramos of Lumban, Laguna. He serves as the panelist on UAAP coverage in ABS-CBN Sports occasionally. ==Philippine Basketball League== During his UAAP stint, Ritualo signed up with Tanduay in the Philippine Basketball League in 1998 in a limited role for the team as the Centennial Rhum Masters took a runner-up finish in the 2nd Yakult PBL Centennial Cup tournament. After Tanduay left the PBL, Ritualo was the key player for Tanduay's Colt 45 team in the 1999 PBL Challenge Cup, when the team placed third in the tournament. After Colt45 decided to leave the league, Ritualo joined Welcoat Paints in late 1999. Ritualo led Welcoat to three PBL titles from 1999 to 2001 before jumping to the PBA. In 2003, Ritualo was named as one of PBL's Greatest Players of All-time. ===Accomplishments=== * PBL Mythical Five * PBL Most Valuable Player * PBL Champion (1999, 2000, 2001) * Member of the PBL's 20 Greatest Players ==Philippine Basketball Association== ===FedEx/Air21 Express=== Ritualo was selected as the eight overall pick in the 2002 PBA draft by expansion team FedEx Express. But before Ritualo was set to join FedEx, he was part of the RP National Training Pool for the 2002 Busan Asian Games. Ritualo was cut from the team and returned to his mother team. Ritualo had a strong rookie for FedEx and by season's end, he was named as the 2002 PBA Rookie of the Year. He was also named Mr. Quality Minutes the following year. Ritualo recorded a 40-point output against Purefoods on January 27, 2006 during Game Three of the Fiesta Conference Semi-finals series, held in the Ynares Sports Complex. Ritualo led Air21 to a third-place finish, the highest in franchise history during that time before the team captured a runner-up finish against the Barangay Ginebra Kings in 2008. Ritualo, was also the first local player in PBA history to have four games in a career with at least eight three-pointers in each of those games. He has also participated in two PBA All-Star games, when he was part of the North All-Stars in the 2005 All-Star Game in Laoag City, Ilocos Norte and the 2006 edition in Cagayan de Oro City. ===Talk 'N Text Phone Pals=== On May 8, 2006, Ritualo, along with Patrick Fran, was traded from Air21 to the Talk 'N Text Phone Pals in exchange for Leo Avenido and two future first round draft picks, which was used in 2007 and 2008. With Ritualo's addition, as well as the trade that sent Alaska Aces slotman Don Allado to the Phone Pals for Willie Miller and John Ferriols, the Phone Pals were considered as one of the deepest lineups in the 2006 Philippine Cup. However, the Phone Pals never made it past the wildcard phase, ending their season. During the 2007 Philippine Cup, Ritualo averaged 13.83 points per game in the 18 Games of the Elimination Round. In the 2008\u20132009 Philippine Cup, Ritualo got his much awaited 1st PBA Title against the Alaska Aces. Though winning championships seemed so easy for him during the amateur ranks, it took him 7 years in the PBA to win a championship. ===Return to the Air21 Express=== During the off-season of the 2010 Fiesta Conference, he was traded back to the Air21 Express along with Yancy de Ocampo for J.R. Qui\u00f1ahan and Aaron Aban. ===Powerade Tigers=== After playing for the Express, he was acquired by the Powerade Tigers during the off-season. He only had limited minutes during the Philippine Cup. ===Meralco Bolts=== The Meralco Bolts signed up Ritualo after the Powerade Tigers released him to the free agency pool during the Philippine Cup off-season. At the end of the 2010\u201311 PBA season, he was waived by the team. ===Reunion With Franz Pumaren=== After being waived by Meralco, he was acquired by then newly formed Shopinas.com Clickers during the off-season of 2011. He played once again under his former collegiate mentor Franz Pumaren. ===Alaska Aces=== Air21 Express released Ritualo and he was picked up by the Alaska Aces. However, he was not included in the lineup for the 2013\u201314 season. As of now, Alaska still has his rights. ===Accomplishments=== *2002 PBA Rookie of the Year *2003 PBA Sixth Man of the Year *PBA All-Star *2002 PBA Mr. Quality Minutes of the Year Award *2006 Best Player of the Conference Candidate *2008 PBA All-Star 3 Point Shootout Champion *PBA 500 Three-Points Club Member *1st local player in PBA history to have 4 games with at least 8 treys in each of those games *Third-best in number of consecutive games played (278), behind Dante Gonzalgo (280) and Alvin Patrimonio (596) ==Radyo5 panelist== He later appeared on Radyo5 92.3 News FM as a panelist, analyst and commentator in some games alongside Jolly Escobar, Carlo Pamintuan and other courtside commentators. ==Team Pilipinas== In 2005, Ritualo was a member of the RP National Training Pool. Ritualo was part of the Team Pilipinas squad in the 2005 FIBA-Asia Champions Cup with the host squad placing fifth in the eight nation tournament. During a match against Sagesse of Lebanon, Ritualo's numerous three-pointers in the second half, sparked a short-lived comeback by the Filipinos before losing 100\u201390. Ritualo was also included in the Team Pilipinas squad for the Global Hoops Summit in Las Vegas, Nevada. During one game, Ritualo drained nine triples in a loss to Passive Lane Sports. Ritualo was a member of Team Pilipinas' successful championship in the 5th Sultan's Cup in Bandar Seri Begawan, Brunei Darussalam in September. In 2006, Ritualo scored 17 points as Team Pilipinas defeated the American squad led by former NBA star Dennis Rodman 110-102 on May 1 at the Araneta Coliseum. ===Statistics=== Correct as of February 18, 2017http://www.pba- online.net/profile/Renren-Ritualo/108// ====Season==== |- | align=\"left\" | 2002 | align=\"left\" | FedEx | 22 || 27.8 || .354 || .333 || .938 || 1.5 || 1.5 || .8 || .05 || 12.4 |- | align=\"left\" | 2003 | align=\"left\" | FedEx | 42 || 20.8 || .380 || .350 || .871 || 1.9 || 1.1 || .7 || .02 || 11.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2004-05 | align=\"left\" | FedEx | 59 || 30.3 || .355 || .322 || .839 || 1.9 || 1.7 || .9 || .2 || 16.4 |- | align=\"left\" | 2005-06 | align=\"left\" | Air21/Talk 'N Text | 51 || 37.6 || .360 || .302 || .829 || 2.8 || 2.4 || .7 || .1 || 18.2 |- | align=\"left\" | 2006-07 | align=\"left\" | Talk 'N Text | 29 || 28.8 || .371 || .322 || .842 || 1.6 || 1.9 || .8 || .1 || 14.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2007-08 | align=\"left\" | Talk 'N Text | 39 || 23.3 || .402 || .368 || .898 || 2.3 || 1.5 || .8 || .1 || 11.8 |- | align=\"left\" | 2008-09 | align=\"left\" | Talk 'N Text | 45 || 15.5 || .379 || .320 || .743 || 1.5 || .8 || .3 || .1 || 7.1 |- | align=\"left\" | 2009-10 | align=\"left\" | Talk 'N Text/Air21 | 41 || 18.8 || .366 || .302 || .762 || 1.3 || 1.0 || .3 || .05 || 6.6 |- | align=\"left\" | 2010-11 | align=\"left\" | Powerade/Meralco | 29 || 13.0 || .376 || .293 || .550 || 1.1 || .9 || .2 || .1 || 4.6 |- | align=\"left\" | 2011-12 | align=\"left\" | Shopinas.com/Air21 | 32 || 21.6 || .387 || .382 || .732 || 1.4 || 1.3 || .4 || .1 || 9.1 |- | align=\"left\" | 2012-13 | align=\"left\" | Air21 | 32 || 10.7 || .349 || .250 || .941|| 1.0 || .7 || .1 || .03 || 3.3 |- | align=\"left\" | 2013-14 | align=\"left\" | Air21 | 8 || 12.6 || .414 || .368 || 1.00 || .6 || .6 || .2 || 0 || 4.6 |- | align=\"left\" | Career | align=\"left\" | | 429 || 23.1 || .369 || .327 || .829 || 1.7 || 1.4 || .6 || .1 || 10.9 ==References== ==External links== *Air21Express.com: Renren Ritualo Profile Category:1979 births Category:Living people Category:Air21 Express players Category:Barako Bull Energy players Category:Basketball players from Metro Manila Category:De La Salle University alumni Category:Filipino men's basketball coaches Category:Filipino Roman Catholics Category:Filipino television sportscasters Category:Meralco Bolts players Category:Philippine Basketball Association All-Stars Category:Philippines men's national basketball team players Category:Filipino men's basketball players Category:Powerade Tigers players Category:San Beda University alumni Category:Shooting guards Category:Small forwards Category:Sportspeople from Manila Category:TNT Tropang Giga players Category:De La Salle Green Archers men's basketball players ",
