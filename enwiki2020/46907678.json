    "text": "Sir Hugh Dubh O'Donnell (Irish: Sir Aodh Dubh \u00d3 Domhnaill) was a leading figure in Gaelic Ireland during the Tudor era. He was part of the ruling O'Donnell dynasty of Tyrconnell. In Ulster Irish, Sir Hugh Dubh is pronounced as 'Sir Hugh Doo'. He was the son of Hugh Roe O'Donnell, King of Tyrconnell from 1461 to 1505 except for a brief period when his son Con O'Donnell, Hugh's eldest brother, came to power. Hugh succeeded his father in 1505, reigning till his death in until 1537. He succeeded by his own son Manus O'Donnell.Ellis p.379 Like his father, Sir Hugh was a strong ruler who was able to keep the rival O'Neills in check and expanded O'Donnell power into northern Connaught.Ellis p.103 His rule saw the gradual development of an alliance between the O'Donnells and the Crown which would last for most of the century. Hugh fought alongside The 8th Earl of Kildare in Munster in 1510 (and may have taken part in the earlier Battle of Knockdoe). In 1511 he went on a pilgrimage to Rome, and was knighted by Henry VIII in London on the return journey.Ellis p.113 On 6 May 1531 he formally submitted to Henry VIII's representative in Ireland, Lord Deputy Sir William Skeffington, at Drogheda.Ellis p.5 Amongst his great-grandchildren were Hugh Roe O'Donnell and Rory, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell, known for their roles in Tyrone's Rebellion and the Flight of the Earls respectively. ==Obit== > O Domhnaill Aodh mac Aodha Ruaidh mic Neill Ghairbh mic Toirrdealbhaigh an > Fh\u00edona tigherna Tire Conaill Innsi h-Eocchain, Cenel Moain Fher Manach, & > Iochtair Chonnacht, fer gus a t-tangattar comhtha, & c\u00edos-chana \u00f3 thiribh > oile chuicce fors m-bao\u00ed a smacht & a chumhachta amhail at\u00e1 Magh Luircc, > Machaire Connacht, Clann Chonnmaigh, Goisdealbhaigh, Gailengaigh, Tir > Amhalgaidh, & Conmaicne Ch\u00faile don taobh thiar, & don taobh thoir bhe\u00f3s, > Oirecht I Cath\u00e1in, An R\u00fata & Clann Aodha Buidhe, ar n\u00ed bhao\u00ed aon-t\u00edr d\u00edbh- > sidhe n\u00e1ch t-tuccsat comhtha d\u00f3 la taobh a chiosa cosanta d'\u00edoc go h-umhal > fris.

This was not to be > wondered at, for never was victory seen with his enemies, never did he > retreat one foot from any army, small or great; he was the represser of evil > deeds and evil customs, the destroyer and banisher of rebels and thieves, an > enforcer of the laws and ordinances after the justest manner; a man in whose > reign the seasons were favourable, so that sea and land were productive; a > man who established every one in his country in his proper hereditary > possessions, that no one of them might bear enmity towards another; a man > who did not suffer the power of the English to come into his country, for he > formed a league of peace and friendship with the King of England, when he > saw that the Irish would not yield superiority to any one among themselves, > but that friends and blood relations contended against one another; a man > who duly protected their termon lands for the friars, churches, poets, and > ollavs. The aforesaid O'Donnell (Hugh, the son of Hugh Roe) died on the 5th > of July, being Wednesday, in the monastery of Donegal, having first taken > upon him the habit of St. Francis, and having wept for his crimes and > iniquities, and done penance for his sins and transgressions.
