Soon after Lockwood & Co. have a customer called Mr. Saunders who wants Lockwood & Co. to come and seal Edmund Bickerstaff's coffin.

Lockwood and Co. are tasked to retrieve the Source at all cost before it starts wreaking havoc in London. ==Characters== * Anthony Lockwood: The charismatic leader of Lockwood & Co.

Strongly valued within the team for her bravery, Listening and Touch skills. * George Cubbins: Deputy of Lockwood & Co. Conducts thorough research for the team's upcoming cases as well as the Problem at large; the latter involves experimenting on the Whispering Skull frequently. Lucy has commented that his research skills are often what save them from rushing into a case and dying. * Whispering Skull: A type 3 ghost. Alternates between sarcasm and death threats (to George) and creating rift between the team. Was stolen by George who used to work in Fittes, the most prestigious and long-standing agency. Lucy is the only one who can communicate with the skull. The Skull helps Lockwood & Co. solve their cases, albeit grudgingly, but cannot be trusted. * Quill Kipps: Works at Fittes Agency as a supervisor. Kipps and his team are always trying to beat Lockwood & Co. * Kat Godwin: On Quill's team. Always has a cold and superior expression. A Listener with good swordplay skills. * Bobby Vernon: On Quill's team. Has the role of conducting research for the team. Research skills are almost on par, or equal, to George's.
