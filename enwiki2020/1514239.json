In 1798, she took part in the Battle of the Nile, where she became one of the nine ships captured by the Royal Navy. In 1805, HMS Spartiate fought at the Battle of Trafalgar under Francis Laforey. With , she forced the surrender of the Spanish ship , of 80 guns. Casualties were three killed (two seamen & one boy), and twenty wounded (the boatswain [Clarke], two Midshipmen [Bellairs & Knapman], one Marine [William Parsons] and sixteen sailors), according to the three logs (Captain's log, Ship's log, Master's log). Spartiate returned to her home port of Plymouth for repairs from December 1805 to February 1806. Thereafter she joined the Channel Fleet and, for the next two years, was involved in the blockade of Rochefort.The Captain's log does show that she returned to the United Kingdom for replenishment purposes at the following time periods: 25 July to 3 August 1806, 14 January to 26 February 1807, 29 June to 16 September 1807 In January 1808, she was in Admiral Strachan's squadron, and pursued Contre-Admiral Zacharie Allemand's flight from Rochefort. On 21 February 1808 she joined the Mediterranean Fleet at Palermo, and was deployed here until the end of 1809. In June 1809, she participated in the attack on the islands of Ischia and Procida. On board during the Trafalgar action was First-Lieutenant James Clephan, who was presented with the ship's Union Jack by the crew after the battle as a mark of their esteem.The Times 8 October 2009 The flag, recently found in a drawer of one of the descendants of James Clephan, is regarded as one of very few surviving Union Flags from the Battle of Trafalgar, and probably the best preserved. With battle scars still visible, it was sold for \u00a3384,000 when it went for auction with specialist maritime auctioneers Charles Miller Ltd in London on Trafalgar Day, 21 October 2009. Spartiate was converted to a sheer hulk in August 1842. She was later broken up, a process completed on 30 May 1857. ==Notes== ==Citations== ==References== * *Lavery, Brian (2003) The Ship of the Line - Volume 1: The development of the battlefleet 1650-1850.
