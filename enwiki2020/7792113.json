    "text": "The Fordham Rams are the varsity sports teams for Fordham University. Their colors are maroon and white. The Fordham Rams are members of NCAA Division I and compete in the Atlantic 10 Conference for all sports except football. In football, the Rams play in the Patriot League of NCAA Division 1 Football Championship Subdivision. The University also supports a number of club sports, and a significant intramural sports program. The University's athletic booster clubs include the Sixth Man Club for basketball and the Afterguard for sailing. ==Fordham and the Ivy League== Fordham University sports, though not part of the Ivy League, has nevertheless been credited with inspiring the term by comparison. The first usage of \"Ivy\" in reference to a group of colleges is from sportswriter Stanley Woodward (1895\u20131965). In an article that appeared in the New York Tribune on October 14, 1933, Woodward, referencing football, wrote William Morris writes that Stanley Woodward actually took the term from fellow New York Tribune sportswriter Caswell Adams.Morris, William and Mary. Morris Dictionary of Word and Phrase Origins, HarperCollins, 1988. Morris writes that during the 1930s, the Fordham University football team was running roughshod over all its opponents. One day in the sports room at the Tribune, the merits of Fordham's football team was being compared to Princeton and Columbia. Adams remarked disparagingly of the latter two, saying they were \"only Ivy League.\" Woodward, the sports editor of the Tribune, picked up the term and printed it the next day. == Sports sponsored == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- | Baseball || Basketball |- | Basketball || Cross country |- | Cross country || Rowing |- | Football || Soccer |- | Golf || Softball |- | Soccer || Swimming and diving |- | Squash || Tennis |- | Swimming and diving || Track and field\u2020 |- | Tennis || Volleyball |- | Track and field\u2020 || |- | Water polo || |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} As a primary member of the Atlantic 10 Conference, Fordham University sponsors varsity teams in eleven men's and ten women's NCAA sanctioned sports. === Baseball === Founded in the late 1850s, the Fordham Rose Hill Baseball Club of St. John's College (the precursor to Fordham University, and of no connection at all to St. John's University) played against St. Francis Xavier College in the first ever nine-man-team college baseball game on November 3, 1859. Fordham is the all time NCAA leader in wins. There have been 56 major leaguers who have played for Fordham, including All-Star pitcher Pete Harnisch and Baseball Hall of Famer Frankie Frisch. Frisch, a star athlete in four different sports at Fordham, was known as the \"Fordham Flash\". Steve Bell\u00e1n, first Latin American to play Major League Baseball, started his career as a player at St. John's College. The team plays home games at Houlihan Park at Jack Coffey Field. Jack Coffey Field, a multisport facility, is named after Jack Coffey, former athletic director and baseball coach at the University. He amassed 817 wins as a baseball coach. Coffey is the only player to play with both Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth in the same season (1918 Detroit Tigers and Boston Red Sox). The baseball portion of the field was renamed \"Houlihan Park\" after renovations completed in 2005. === Basketball === Fordham basketball teams (men and women) have been members of the MAAC (1981\u201382 through 1989\u201390), Patriot League (1990\u201391 through 1994\u201395), and the Atlantic 10 Conference (1995\u201396 through present). ==== Men ==== Fordham began competing in men's basketball in 1902. They played their first game in Rose Hill Gymnasium on January 16, 1925 (defeating Boston College, 46\u201316). On February 28, 1940, Fordham hosted the University of Pittsburgh at Madison Square Garden in the first ever televised basketball game. Pitt won, 57\u201337. The game was televised by NBC. Fordham University enjoyed its best season in 1970\u20131971, when the squad went 26\u20133 under coach Digger Phelps and was ranked number nine in the nation in the AP poll. The Fordham men have won three Patriot League regular season conference titles (1991, 1992, 1994) and two Patriot League Tournament Championships (1991 and 1992). Fordham has participated in four NCAA Tournaments (1953, 1954, 1971, 1992), and sixteen NITs (1943, 1958, 1959, 1963, 1965, 1968, 1969, 1972, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988, 1990, 1991). Though Fordham won the 1991 Patriot League Tournament, the NCAA did not grant the Patriot League an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament that year. Instead, Fordham played in one of three \"play-in games\", but lost, and was not considered to have reached the NCAA Tournament. In the 2009\u201310 season, Fordham went 0\u201316 in the A-10 conference season (2\u201326 overall), becoming the first team to go winless in an A-10 conference season since St. Bonaventure in 1992\u201393. That winless streak, which started during the 2008\u201309 season, ended on the 2010\u201311 season's final game, snapping the streak at 41. Through the end of the 2010\u201311 season, the program's cumulative record is 1,444 wins and 1,237 losses (.539 win percentage). ==== Women ==== Women's basketball at Fordham began as a club team in 1963\u201364. They became an NCAA competitive team in 1970\u201371. The Rams have won the Patriot League Championship in 1992 and 1994 and the Atlantic 10 Women's Basketball Tournament in 2014. They have played in the 1994 NCAA Tournament, the 2013 WNIT, and the 2014 NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament. === Football === Tackle Ed Franco was a consensus All-American. So was center Alex Wojciechowicz who later became an All-Pro with Detroit and Philadelphia. Guard Vince Lombardi later became one of the greatest of pro coaches. In 1937, the team went undefeated and was ranked number three nationally. So popular was Fordham, that the Cleveland NFL franchise formed in the 1930s took its nickname from the Rams of the Bronx. The Cleveland Rams later moved to Los Angeles and then to St. Louis, Missouri, before returning to Los Angeles in 2016, and are now known as the Los Angeles Rams. On September 30, 1939, Fordham participated in the world's first televised American football game. In front of the sport's first live TV audience, the Rams defeated Waynesburg College 34\u20137. The following week they lost the second ever televised game to the University of Alabama, 7\u20136. It was not for another month that a professional NFL game was televised. Fordham has dropped their football program on several different occasions. Fordham first dropped football between 1894\u201395, and then again between 1910\u201311, 1919, and 1943-45. On December 15, 1954, Fordham scratched its football program for the fifth time, for various reasons, mainly financial. A club football team was established in 1964 (on shaky authority) and football was re-established as a varsity sport in 1970, but in Division III. Fordham joined what is now the NCAA Division I Football Championship Subdivision in 1989. With 722 all-time wins at the close of the 2005 season, Fordham's football program ranks 15th among Division I programs on the all-time NCAA wins list, and fifth among programs currently playing in the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision, trailing only Yale University, the University of Pennsylvania, Harvard University, and Princeton University (putting the Rams in first among non-Ivy League schools in the FCS standings). Fordham was invited to play in the 1942 Rose Bowl, but declined the invitation because it had previously accepted a berth in the 1942 Sugar Bowl. The Rams, who defeated the University of Missouri by a 2\u20130 score, were the 1942 Sugar Bowl champions. The Rams also played in the 1941 Cotton Bowl Classic but lost 13\u201312 to Texas A&M.; At least one source lists Fordham as the 1929 National Football Champions. Since 2002, Fordham has played Columbia University for The Liberty Cup. The trophy was dedicated after the attacks of September 11, 2001 forced the postponement of the first annual meeting between New York City's two Division I football programs. In 2009 the university announced that it will be offering scholarships for football for the first time since 1954. This makes the Rams ineligible to compete for the Patriot League championship, but simultaneously allows them to schedule games with Football Bowl Subdivision teams such as the Army Black Knights and the Navy Midshipmen (which are members of the Patriot League outside football), both immediately scheduled. In addition, the Rams are still eligible for an at-large bid for the Championship Subdivision play-offs.Ehalt, Matt. \"Fordham football offers scholorships [sicfor the first time since 1954\"] , New York Daily News, June 5, 2009. Retrieved June 25, 2009. In 2013, the Rams had a record year in going 12-2 with wins over FBS Temple and ranked Villanova and Lehigh teams and went to the Second Round of the FCS Playoffs. ==== Milestones ==== Jack Coffey Field at Fordham University * National Championship: 1929 *Bowl games: ** 1941 Cotton Bowl ClassicCotton Bowl History at The Dallas Morning News ** 1942 Sugar BowlWheeler, Romney. \"Rams Set Mark For Low Score In Sugar Bowl\" , The Washington Post Associated Press, January 4, 1942.

Sam Perry set the World Record for the 60-yard dash indoors at the Milrose Games in 1965. Tom Courtney won Olympic Gold in the 800 m run at the 1956 Games. While at Fordham Courtney had anchored the 2 Mile Relay that broke the world record in 1954. Fordham track has had a resurgence in the past two decades with an All-Americans and numerous conference champions. Barry Cantrell earned all-American honors in the high jump in 1998. There have been several Atlantic 10 Conference champions including the jumping events, hammer throw. and the intermediate hurdles. In 2008, the men's Track and Field team won the Outdoor Metropolitan Championship. The title was the first ever Metropolitan Athletic Conference team title captured by the Rams in the school's history.\"Men's Track Wins First Ever Outdoor Metropolitan Championship; Women Take Highest Ever Finish In Second\" , FordhamSports.com, Palisades Park, New Jersey, April 19, 2008; accessed June 27, 2008.

Fordham University alumnus Chris Judge (class of 1980) was inducted into the CWPA Hall of Fame in 2010. == Clubs == ===Crew=== The logo of the Fordham rowing crew Men's crew has been a club sport at Fordham since 1915, when John Mulcahy (an alumnus and Olympic Gold medalist in the sport) helped found it there. Fordham Crew has since been quite successful, winning several national championships. The team is a member of the Dad Vail affiliation, making the Dad Vail Regatta the focus of its spring racing season. Exceptional crews have competed at the Intercollegiate Rowing Association (IRA) National Championships, Henley Royal Regatta, and the San Diego Crew Classic. The team is divided into novice and varsity squads. Fordham Athletics also sponsors a women's varsity team. Fordham Crew trains on the Harlem River. For many years the university maintained the last remaining boathouse on \"sculler's row\" off the river in Manhattan, along Sherman Creek, until it was destroyed by suspected arson in 1978. It has yet to be replaced. Currently, the club shares space at the Peter Jay Sharp Boathouse near Sherman Creek, the first community boathouse built in Manhattan in over 100 years. Since 1989, Fordham has medaled every year at the Dad Vail and other major collegiate regattas. During that period the team has had 9 undefeated seasons and 13 national championships: eight at the Dad Vail, three at the Eastern College Athletic Conference National Invitational Collegiate Regatta, one at the Division-I National Championships, and one at the IRA Championship. Fordham was the 2007 Dad Vail Champions in Men's Varsity Lightweight 4+ and the 2008 Dad Vail Champions in Men's Varsity Lightweight 8+. ===Ice hockey=== The university supports hockey as a club sport.
