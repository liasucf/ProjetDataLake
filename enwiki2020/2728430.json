    "text": "The Editors' Association of Canada (Editors Canada), or Association canadienne des r\u00e9viseurs (R\u00e9viseurs Canada) in French, promotes professional editing as key in producing effective communication. The association has about 1500 members, representing both salaried and freelance editors, who work with individuals and organizations in the corporate, technical, government, not- for-profit, and publishing sectors. Six regional branches\u2014British Columbia, Prairie Provinces, Saskatchewan, Toronto, National Capital Region, and Quebec/Atlantic Canada\u2014provide a range of local programming and services. Several smaller branches, or 'twigs', also offer local services to members: Calgary, Kitchener-Waterloo-Guelph, Hamilton-Halton, Kingston, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland & Labrador. Editors Canada sponsors professional development seminars, promotes and maintains high standards of editing and publishing in Canada, creates guidelines to help editors secure fair pay and good working conditions, helps both in-house and freelance editors to network, and cooperates with other publishing associations in areas of common concern. The association is incorporated federally as a not-for-profit organization and is governed at the national level by an executive council. == History == In the late 1970s, several young Toronto editors began talking about their shared problems and goals, and by May 1979 the Freelance Editors' Association of Canada (FEAC) had been officially launched. There were approximately 50 people involved, with Maggie MacDonald serving as the association's first president. Within the first year, the association had a logo, a constitution, and a directory. By 1981 Ottawa was hosting a group; three years later Montreal formed a committee; and in 1985 British Columbia did the same. However, until 1990, FEAC operated as a Toronto-based organization. During 1990 and 1991, a new national structure with four separate regional branches was established. The branches were Quebec-Atlantic Canada, National Capital Region, Toronto, and Western Canada (which was essentially BC). In 1982, FEAC adopted a French name, Association canadienne des pigistes de l'edition, and thus committed to being a bilingual association. During the first 15 years of its existence, FEAC addressed primarily issues that were uniquely of concern to freelance editors. However, over the years that emphasis had gradually changed. So in 1994 the association's name was changed to the Editors' Association of Canada/Association canadienne des r\u00e9dacteurs-r\u00e9viseurs, and in-house editors were invited to join. In 1996, the Editors' Association of Alberta came under the umbrella of EAC, becoming the Prairie Provinces Branch. And in 2005, a group of editors in Saskatchewan formed a sixth branch, Saskatoon (later renamed \"Saskatchewan\"). In 2000, the association\u2019s French name was changed to Association canadienne des r\u00e9viseurs. In 2006, EAC launched its professional certification program for proofreading, copy editing, structural editing, and stylistic editing, along with the CPE (Certified Professional Editor) designation. In 2015, the association launched its French editing proficiency program, Programme d'agr\u00e9ment en r\u00e9vision linguistique \u2013 R\u00e9viseurs Canada (PARL). In 2015, the association changed the short form of its name from \"EAC\" to \"Editors Canada\" (in French, \"ACR\" changed to \"R\u00e9viseurs Canada\"). Editors' Association of Canada / Association canadienne des r\u00e9viseurs remains the association's legal name. == Major programs == Tom Fairley Award for Editorial Excellence Established in 1983 and presented annually, The Tom Fairley Award for Editorial Excellence recognizes the editor's often invisible contribution to written communication. The cash award of $2,000 for the winner and $500 for each of the other two finalists is made possible by the association and its donors. Claudette Upton Scholarship The Claudette Upton Scholarship is an annual award of $1,000 that recognizes a student editor from among Editors Canada's membership. It was awarded for the first time in 2010. Lee d'Anjou Volunteer of the Year Award and President's Award for Volunteer Service In 2010, the association launched the Lee d'Anjou Volunteer of the Year Award and the President's Award for Volunteer Service, which recognize service by members to the organization at the local or national level. Editors' Association of Canada (Editors Canada) Certification Editors Canada's certification program sets objective standards for recognizing high levels of knowledge and skill in editing. Successful candidates can become Certified Professional Editors or earn certification in proofreading, copy editing, structural editing, and stylistic editing. Programme d'agr\u00e9ment en r\u00e9vision linguistique \u2013 R\u00e9viseurs Canada (PARL) In 2015, the association launched its French editing proficiency program, Programme d'agr\u00e9ment en r\u00e9vision linguistique \u2013 R\u00e9viseurs Canada (PARL). PARL is composed of two exams: the examen d'agr\u00e9ment en r\u00e9vision linguistique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale, which focuses on French editing; and the examen en r\u00e9vision comparative, which tests concordance in editing of text that has been translated from English to French. Successful candidates can earn designations such as r\u00e9viseur agr\u00e9\u00e9 and professionnel agr\u00e9\u00e9 en r\u00e9vision g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et comparative. Annual Conference The association hosts a spring conference in a different Canadian city each year. In 2015, the association hosted the first international conference of editors with attendees from Canada, Africa, Australia, India, Ireland, New Zealand, the UK, and the US. The 2016 Editors Canada conference will take place June 10\u201312 in Vancouver. == Publications == Professional Editorial Standards Lists the skills and knowledge needed for editing in English-language media in Canada.
