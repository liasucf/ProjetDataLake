    "text": "\"Raised on It\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music singer Sam Hunt. It was released independently, and was later included on his debut studio album Montevallo (2014). ==Critical reception== Matt Bjorke of Roughstock reviewed the single favorably, saying that \"The song may mentioned trucks and parties but it\u2019s more about the roots and youthful lifestyle than trying to have a girl slide over on a bench seat or to get so washed out in party land that nothing else can be taken from the lyrics.\" ==Music video== The music video premiered in August 2013 on Hunt's independent YouTube channel. The music video features Hunt heading to Georgia to hang out with friends and family. ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Chart (2014) ! Peak position |- |- ! Chart (2016) !
