The contract for construction was awarded to \"Mr Nield, builder, Manchester for \u00a320,000\". Built as a club house for Manchester's Liberal Party elite, the building was opened by Earl Granville, Gladstone's Foreign Secretary, on October 19, 1871.Manchester Evening News, 20 October 1871 The building is constructed of sandstone ashlar with polychrome dressings and hipped slate roofs and is three-storey with elaborate corner turrets and oriel windows and balconies. The main entrance is \"richly adorned with carving including winged beasts\". The interior contains a \"fine staircase, a (two- storey) grand dining room and an enormous billiard room, running the whole length of the building, in the roof\". The \"hall and staircase (have) linenfold panelling.\" Declining membership in the late 20th century led the club to merge with the Engineers' Club in 1967 to form the Manchester Club, but this failed to prove financially viable and was wound up in 1988. The Club's archives are held at the John Rylands Library, Deansgate. The building is now a restaurant and bar. ==See also== *Grade II* listed buildings in Greater Manchester *Listed buildings in Manchester-M2 ==Notes== ==References== * Category:Grade II* listed buildings in Manchester Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Greater Manchester Category:Venetian Gothic architecture in the United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1871 ",
