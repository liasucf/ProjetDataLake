    "text": "Boas Not\u00edcias () is the twentieth studio album and the fourteenth in the Portuguese by Brazilian singer and TV host Xuxa Meneghel. It was released on September 22, 1997 by Som Livre. It was the last Xuxa album to be released as a cassette. The album follows the style of the three discs previously released, focusing on the children and youth audience, but this time betting more on pop and ax\u00e9. Boas Not\u00edcias, was certified platinum disc by Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD). ==Background and production== After the celebrations of 10 years of Globo TV and the success of the album T\u00f4 de Bem com a Vida (1996), Xuxa was preparing to debut a new program on Rede Globo, Planeta Xuxa. The production of the new album begins with the ordering of themes for the new evening attraction, thus arises the songs \"Planeta Xuxa\" and \"Libera Geral\". Including, initially Libera Geral would be the track that would give title to the album. This possibility was worked until July 1997. In addition to bringing a bit of pop, something that had been left out of the previous release, it is possible to note that little by little, Xuxa was bringing back more childish songs to his records like the case of \"Preste Aten\u00e7\u00e3o\", \"Agora eu Vou Andar (Andar Devagarinho)\" and \"Godofredo, o Piolho\". The ax\u00e9 that was high at the time and began to become one of the marks of the albums of the 90s of Xuxa, also influences the album. In addition to \"Xuxa Lel\u00ea\" and \"Libera Geral\", \"Diet\" was included, composition of Carlinhos Brown that would be part of the carnival album that would be released in early 1997, but was canceled. \"Na Hora em Que Voc\u00ea Quiser Chegar\", it is highlighted because it was made up of the blonde's great desire to become a mother. The presenter had been discussing for some time the desire to have a child and out of curiosity, Xuxa discovered in December 1997 that she was pregnant. For Boas Not\u00edcias, the singer decided to take quite different pictures. On the day of the rehearsal, Xuxa carried a suitcase with dozens of wigs that were used in the photo essay. The pictures with the brown wig were published in Manchete magazine in 1997 and none of them were used in the album. Another part of the essay was published in the magazine Caras that same year. The album was produced by Michael Sullivan, wears the artistic direction of Aramis Barros, was recorded in the studios: Som Livre and had co-production Z\u00e9 Henrique, Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel. ==Release and reception== Boas Not\u00edcias It was released on September 22, 1997 in CD and cassette format. Boas Not\u00edcias, was certified platinum disc by Associa\u00e7\u00e3o Brasileira de Produtores de Discos (ABPD), for more than 500,000 copies sold reached, #15 position among the 50 best-selling albums of Brazil, according to Billboard. ==Promotion== The release of Boas Not\u00edcias only really began in August 1997 when Xuxa began to present the album's songs in their shows. \"Xuxa Lel\u00ea\", \"Agora eu Vou Andar (Andar Devagarinho)\" and \"Super Hiper\" (that soon after was discarded from the album) were the first ones shown to the public in Xuxa Park. \"Libera Geral\" and \"Planeta Xuxa\" were already known by the public for being themes of the same name program and presented in the shows of the second phase of the Tour T\u00f4 de bem com a Vida. Still in August, a single was distributed to the radios of all Brazil with the songs \"Boas Not\u00edcias\" and \"Serenata do Grilo\". Entitled Xuxa 97, the single received this name because the album still did not have a definite name. On September 28, 1997, Xuxa held a free concert at Parque do Carmo in S\u00e3o Paulo to announce the launch of Boas Noticias. The presentation was attended by more than 200 thousand people. After the event, more songs from the album will be included in the set of the Tour T\u00f4 de bem com a Vida and the singles are performed at Santa's Arrival in Porto Alegre. The following month, the Queen of Children stars in a Children's Day special that featured music videos: \"Xuxa Lel\u00ea\", \"Amarelinha (Pulando, Pulando)\", \"Serenata do Grilo\", \"Boas Not\u00edcias\" and \"Ora\u00e7\u00e3o de um Novo Mil\u00eanio\". Much of this special, just as his video were recorded in Fortaleza, Cear\u00e1. In addition to the videos, a show was held at Beach Park where the blonde introduced some of the songs from her most recent release. The song \"Meu Xamego\" also won a music videos that year, but recorded for the Christmas special, as well as the discarded \"Celeiro do Mundo\". Still in the week of the children's day, Xuxa decided to make a live edition of Planet Xuxa on the eve of the holiday. The blonde sang some of the songs that were already known by the audience and distributed CDs to the audience. Also from the live edition, the release of the disc was incorporated into the scenario of the Planeta. The photos of the rehearsal for the Xuxa Dance album that adorned the scenery were replaced by pictures from the rehearsal for Boas Not\u00edcias, photos of the children's day special and the show T\u00f4 de bem e a Vida. In addition to the floor that was changed to an image with the label of the new release and a red strip written Boas Not\u00edcias. On the Queen's official website, the songs \"Planeta Xuxa\", \"Libera Geral\" and \"Amarelinha (Pulando, Pulando)\" were made available in two versions: those of the album and those specially made for the TV show. Unlike previous albums, the Boas Not\u00edcias tour only took place the following year. The show premiered on February 20 in Santos, S\u00e3o Paulo on Gonzaga Beach. The show brought together about 100,000 people on the scene. In addition to the concerts, music videos and performances, the commercial album was shown several times in the programming of Rede Globo in 3 different versions: two versions of 30 seconds and one of ten seconds. In all of them, Xuxa images were displayed singing the working songs of the disc in their programs. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Produced: Michael Sullivan and Z\u00e9 Henrique *Art Direction: Aramis Barros *Recording Technician: Edu Oliveira, S\u00e9rgio Rocha and M\u00e1rio Jorge *Recorded in the studios: Som Livre *Co-production: Z\u00e9 Henrique, Marlene Mattos and Xuxa Meneghel *Mixing Technicians: Jorge 'Gordo' Guimar\u00e3es *Production Assistant: Duda Nogueira *Studio Coordination: Helio de Freitas *Makeup: Free Sound and Sergio Seabra ==Certifications== ==References== == External links == * Boas Not\u00edcias at Discogs Category:1997 albums Category:Xuxa albums Category:Som Livre albums Category:Portuguese- language albums ",
