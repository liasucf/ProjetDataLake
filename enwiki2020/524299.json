    "text": "Mariel Hadley Hemingway (born November 22, 1961) is an American actress. She began acting at age 14 with a Golden Globe\u2013nominated breakout role in Lipstick (1976), and received Academy and BAFTA Award nominations for her performance in Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979). She is also known for her leading roles in Personal Best (1982) and Star 80 (1983), as well as in the TV series Civil Wars, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. Amid mental health struggles, Hemingway's career dwindled in the 1990s. She has starred in and co-produced videos about yoga and holistic living. She published a yoga memoir, Finding My Balance, in 2002, and another more general one, Out Came the Sun, in 2015. ==Early life== Hemingway was born in Mill Valley, California, the third daughter of Byra Louise (n\u00e9e Whittlesey) Hemingway and Jack Hemingway, a writer. Joan Hemingway is her sister. Another sister, Margaux Hemingway, was an actress and model who died of a barbiturate overdose at age 42 in 1996. Her paternal grandparents were Hadley Richardson (1891\u20131979) and Nobel Prize\u2013laureate novelist Ernest Hemingway (1899\u20131961), who committed suicide four months before she was born. She was named after the Cuban port of Mariel\u2014her father and grandfather visited the village regularly to go fishing. Her middle name was her paternal grandmother's. Hemingway grew up primarily in Ketchum, Idaho, where her father lived, and where Ernest had spent time as a sportsman and writer. ==Career in film== Hemingway's first role was with her real-life sister Margaux (also in her debut role) in the film Lipstick (1976), in which they played sisters. She received notice for her acting and was nominated as \"Best Newcomer\" for the Golden Globe Award that year. Her highest profile role came with her role in Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979), a romantic comedy in which she plays Tracy, a high school student and Allen's lover. Just 16 during filming (in the film she is said to be 17), she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. In her memoir, Out Came The Sun (2015), Hemingway alleged that Allen attempted to begin a sexual relationship with her shortly after filming was completed, when she had turned 18. Hemingway declined his advances.Howard Kurtz \"Exclusive: Young Mariel Hemingway had to rebuff Woody Allen's advances\", Fox News, March 25, 2015.Helen Nianias \"Woody Allen: Mariel Hemingway, granddaughter of writer Ernest, claims director had 'crush' on her when she was 17\", The Independent, March 26, 2015. In Personal Best (1982), she played a bisexual track-and-field athlete in a film noted for its same-sex love scenes. In connection with Personal Best, she appeared in a nude pictorial in the April 1982 issue of Playboy and was on the cover. Hemingway in April 2017 She starred as Dorothy Stratten in Star 80 (1983), a film about the Playboy model's life and murder. Reports circulated for years that Hemingway had had her breasts enlarged to play the role of Stratten, but during a 2007 appearance on the late-night talk and variety show, Fashionably Late with Stacy London, she said she had had the surgery before Star 80. Her breast implants were removed years later after they had ruptured.Hemingway, Mariel. Finding My Balance. New York: Simon & Schuster, 2003. She was featured in Superman IV: The Quest for Peace (1987) as Lacy Warfield. Subsequently, released additional footage showed an expansion of her role. She also co-starred in the 1991\u201393 ABC series Civil Wars. She was cast as the female lead in Darren Star's CBS drama Central Park West for the 1995\u201396 season; however, the show fared poorly with both critics and viewers, and after 13 episodes Hemingway was told that the show wanted her to accept a huge pay cut and demotion to recurring character status. She quit the series, which only lasted eight more episodes before being cancelled. In 1996, she had a leading role in the British TV movie September, playing the wife of Michael York. She has played a lesbian or bisexual woman in several films and television shows, including Personal Best, The Sex Monster, In Her Line of Fire, and episodes of the TV series Roseanne (\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and \"December Bride\") and Crossing Jordan. Hemingway, however, is neither lesbian nor bisexual. She has said she formed a \"big connection with the LGBT community\" after Personal Best and enjoys taking roles in \"cutting-edge\" productions.MacDonald, Jay (May 1, 2007). \"Fame & Fortune: Mariel Hemingway\", Bankrate; accessed August 27, 2009.

As of early 2011, Hemingway was romantically linked with former stuntman Bobby Williams, with whom she has co-authored a self-help book. In April 2015, Williams was described as Hemingway's partner. She practices Transcendental Meditation. In a 2013 television documentary film, Running from Crazy, Hemingway, then 51, talked of her bouts of mental illness and her still lingering issues with her siblings.
