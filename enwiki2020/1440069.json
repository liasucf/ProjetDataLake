The Taichung line (), also known as the Mountain line (), is a line of the Taiwan Railway Administration. It has a total length of 85.5 km, all of which is double track.Taiwan Railways Administration ==History== The Taichung Line was completed in 1908. After the Coast Line between Zhunan and Changhua was finished in 1922, the original line was called Taichung Line. In 1998, the construction to expand to two tracks (double tracks) was completed. Long tunnels were built to reduce the grade of the line. Sanyi Tunnel is one of the longest railway tunnels in Taiwan. The opening of the new segment of the line relegated the previous segment of the line to become the Old Mountain Line. The section between Fengyuan and Daqing was rebuilt as an elevated line in 2016. Five new stations were added in 2018: Lilin, Toujiacuo, Songzhu, Jingwu, and Wuquan. ==Stations== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" !Name!!Chinese!!Taiwanese!!Hakka!!Transfers and Notes!!colspan=2|Location |- |Zhunan||||Tek-l\u00e2m||Chuk-n\u00e0m |align=left|\u2192 West Coast line |Zhunan||rowspan=7|Miaoli County |- |Zaoqiao||||Ch\u014d-ki\u00f4||Chho-khi\u00e2u||align=left| |Zaoqiao |- |Fengfu||||Hong-h\u00f9||F\u00fbng-fu |align=left|Image:AB-Kreuz.svg Miaoli |Houlong |- |Miaoli||||Bi\u00e2u-le\u030dk||M\u00e8u-li\u030dt||align=left| |rowspan=2|Miaoli |- |Nanshi||||L\u00e2m-s\u00ec||N\u00e0m-s\u1e73||align=left| |- |Tongluo||||T\u00e2ng-l\u00f4||Th\u00f9ng- l\u00f2||align=left| |Tongluo |- |Sanyi||||Sam-g\u012b||S\u00e2m-ngi |align=left|\u2192 Former Mountain line (limited services) |Sanyi |- |Tai'an||||Th\u00e0i-an||Thai- \u00f4n||align=left| |rowspan=2|Houli||rowspan=15|Taichung |- |Houli||||\u0100u-l\u00ed||Heu- l\u00ee |align=left|\u2192 Former Mountain line (limited services) |- |Fengyuan||||Hong- go\u00e2n||F\u00fbng-ngi\u00e8n||align=left| |Fengyuan |- |Lilin||||Lek- l\u00eem||Li\u030dt-l\u00ecm||align=left| |rowspan=3|Tanzi |- |Tanzi||||Th\u00e2m-ch\u00fa||Th\u00e2m-ch\u1e73\u0301 ||align=left| |- |Toujiacuo||||Th\u00e2u-ke-chh\u00f9||Th\u00e8u-k\u00e2-chh\u1e73\u0300||align=left| |- |Songzhu||||Si\u00f4ng-tek||Chhi\u00f9ng-chuk||align=left| |rowspan=2|Beitun |- |Taiyuan||||Th\u00e0i-go\u00e2n||Thai-ngi\u00e8n||align=left| |- |Jingwu||||Cheng-b\u00fa||Ch\u00een- v\u00fa||align=left| |East |- |Taichung||||T\u00e2i-tiong||Th\u00f2i-ch\u00fbng||align=left| |Central |- |Wuquan||||Ng\u014d\u0358-kho\u00e2n||\u0143g-khi\u00e8n||align=left| |rowspan=2|South |- |Daqing||||T\u0101i-kh\u00e8ng||Thai-khin |align=left|Image:AB-Kreuz.svgTaichung Metro : G13 Daqing (u/c) |- |Wuri||||O\u0358-ji\u030dt||V\u00fb-ngit |align=left|Image:AB- Kreuz.svgTaichung Metro : G16 Wuri (u/c) |rowspan=3|Wuri |- |Xinwuri||||Sin O\u0358-ji\u030dt||S\u00een V\u00fb-ngit |align=left|Image:AB-Kreuz.svg Taichung Image:AB-Kreuz.svgTaichung Metro : G17 Xinwuri (u/c) |- |Chenggong||||S\u00eang- kong||S\u1e73\u0300n-k\u00fbng |align=left|\u2192 Chengzhui line |- |Jinma|||| || |align=left|Image:AB-Kreuz.svgTaichung Metro : G20 Kulingjiao (planned) |rowspan=2|Changhua |rowspan=2|Changhua County |- |Changhua||||Chiong-ho\u00e0||Ch\u00f4ng-fa |align=left|\u2192 West Coast line |} Notes: * Tai'an Station: Earliest elevated station of TRA. ==References== ",
