    "text": "Y\u0101na (Sanskrit and P\u0101li: \"vehicle\") refers to a mode or method of spiritual practice in Buddhism, and in particular to divisions of various schools of Buddhism according to their type of practice. ==Nomenclature, etymology and orthography== In form, y\u0101na is a neuter noun derived from the Sanskrit root y\u0101- meaning to \"go to\" or \"move\" or \"reach\". The suffix employed to form this noun may have different values: while primarily y\u0101na is understood to refer to the means (kara.na) through which one goes to/ reaches a location, it may technically also refer to the action itself (bh\u0101va). Y\u0101na is therefore primarily a \"vehicle\", in most contexts relevant to the Buddhist doctrine of three y\u0101nas. \"Vehicle\" is often used as a preferred translation as the word that provides the least in the way of presuppositions about the mode of travel. In specifically Buddhist contexts, the word y\u0101na acquires many metaphorical meanings, discussed below. ==Teaching story and metaphor== In the Mah\u0101parinibb\u0101na Sutta (1.33-34), Shakyamuni Buddha relates a story on vehicles of conveyance utilizing the sacred river Ganges, all of which may be engaged as a metaphor for yana and a gradual or direct path: > 1.33 And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. And just then, the river > was so full that a crow could drink out of it. And some people were looking > for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together > a raft of reeds to get to the other side. But the Lord, as swiftly as a > strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from > this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other > shore. > 1.34 And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat, looking for > a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. And > seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on the spot: ::'When they > want to cross the sea, the lake or pond, ::People make a bridge or raft - > the wise have crossed already.'Maurice Walshe (1995). The Long Discourses of > the Buddha: A Translation of the D\u012bgha Nik\u0101ya. Boston: Wisdom Publications, > \"[DN] 16: ': The Great Passing, The Buddha's Last Days,\" pp. 238-239.In > Buddhist countries throughout Southeast Asia and the Himalaya, the crow is > sacred as it voices the sacred syllable \"Ah\". The crow drinks of the river > which is a metaphor for the continuum of mind, the mindstream. These two verses are meant to teach that all vehicles, teachings and doctrine are skillful means (Skt.up\u0101ya). ==Introduction and qualification of the term yana== The Bodhipathaprad\u012bpa of Atisha (980-1054 CE), quoted in Gampopa's (1079-1153 CE) Jewel Ornament of LiberationDam chos yid b\u017ain nor bu thar pa rin po che'i rgyan rendered into English by G\u00fcnther, makes reference to people of three capacities: > Man is to be known in three ways: > As inferior, mediocre and excellent.Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert > V.

As is written: > :Standing in the boat of the human body, :You should cross the great flood > of misery. :Since later this boat is difficult to get, :Do not sleep now, > you fool.Sgam-po-pa (author) Guenther, Herbert V. (trans) (1959, 1986). The > Jewel Ornament of Liberation. Boston, Massachusetts, US: Shambhala > Publications., Inc. (pbk.) p.19 Empowerment, initiation, intention and endeavour may leaven capacity and propensity as may a graceful benediction of a person (in the sense of mindstream), object or place endowed or invested with holiness. In the teaching story abovementioned, Shakyamuni Buddhi and his sangha traverse the continuum directly in the body'Body' is to be read as Trikaya. of their own experience rather than constructing a gradual vehicle for passage. ==Usage== In Buddhism and Hinduism, both y\u0101na and m\u0101rga (road or path) are metaphors depicting spiritual practice as a path or journey. Ancient texts in both religions discuss doctrines and practices associated with various y\u0101nas. In Buddhism, y\u0101na often expands the metaphor of the spiritual path with the idea of various vehicles that convey a person along that path. The y\u0101na / m\u0101rga metaphor pervasive within Buddhism and other traditions is an analogue to the Chinese metaphor of the Tao: The Tao though is the Way as the endgoal and not just the art of wayfinding. The dialogic spiritual traditions of Indian and Chinese culture hold common cultural memes. ==Vedic origins of -y\u0101na as a spiritual journey== The use of y\u0101na to use as a name or to refer to a spiritual journey may date to the ', possibly composed circa 1500 BCE, whose 10th Mandala makes several references to devay\u0101na, (translators usually render this as the \"path of the gods\" or similar) and one reference to ' (\"path of the fathers\"). The first verse of the 's burial hymn (10.18) translates approximately as \"O Death, take the other path, which is distinct from the way of the gods\" ('). The \"other path\" is the ', referred to in hymn 10.2 and alluded to in 10.14 and 10.16. The devay\u0101na and ' evolved from the ancient Rig Vedic concern for immortality to the classical Hindu concern with ending existence. The , which comment on the Vedas, make further reference to devay\u0101na and '. Among other distinctions, the pitryana was said to refer the religious practices of villagers, and the devay\u0101na was said to refer to the practices of recluses living in the forest. The (II.iv.11 and IV.v.12) also makes reference to ekay\u0101na, notably in the phrase ', where ekay\u0101nam connotes \"one journey\". The phrase translates approximately to \" Sacred Vedas - intonation - (is the) one journey/destination\", in the same sense that a river's journey is to the ocean. ==Y\u0101na in early Buddhist texts== Y\u0101na is one of ten suggested gifts (dana) that a lay person can appropriately give a monk or recluse, in the sense of providing a vehicle or transportation (e.g., see DN 7.33/PTS: A iv 59 and DN 10.177/PTS: A v 269). The earliest explicit Buddhist use of -y\u0101na in a metaphorical sense of a journey to awakening may be the term dhammay\u0101nam, \"dharma chariot\" (SN IV.4), where the vehicle itself serves as an extended metaphor for the Eightfold Path. Various parts of the chariot represent aspects of the Path (magga), e.g. axles represent meditation, the charioteer represents mindfulness, and so on. Thus, metaphorical usage of y\u0101na in the sense of a vehicle (as distinct from a path) emerged from a Buddhist context, and it did so relatively early in the evolution of Buddhism. Nevertheless, while the Pali Canon are very rich in images of wheels (cakka) and paths (magga) as metaphors for the journey to awakening, the Pali Canon rarely uses the term y\u0101na for that purpose. According to Fujita Kotatsu the term Three Vehicles does not occur in the P\u00e2li tripitaka, however corresponding terms (tr\u00eeni y\u00e2n\u00e2ni, triy\u00e2na, y\u00e2natraya) are used in the Ekottara Agama, the Mahavastu, and the Mah\u0101vibh\u0101\u1e63a \u015a\u0101stra. In these texts the Three Vehicles include the sr\u00e2vakay\u00e2na, pratyekabuddhay\u00e2na, and buddhay\u00e2na. ==Enumeration of y\u0101nas in Mahayana texts== Mahayana texts are very rich in images of vehicles that serve in metaphors for journeys to awakening. ===The three carts of expedient means: the parable of the burning house=== The tradition of Mahayana texts employing the image of different types of vehicles and conveyances as salient metaphor for the journey of novice to the awakening of adept may have begun with the Lotus S\u016btra. The Lotus S\u016btra holds a parable of a devoted father with three small children entranced in childhood play within the family home, oblivious that tongues of flame are ravenously engulfing the house. The father entices the children from the burning home with the half-truth gilded promise of special carts for each of them. The carts though are only an expedient means for luring the children from the house.Pye, Michael (2003), Skilful Means - A concept in Mahayana Buddhism, Routledge. pp. 37-39 Kat\u014d et al. render thus into English a tract of the Saddharma Pu\u1e47\u1e0dar\u012bka pertaining to the cart of expedient means and the parable of the burning house: > \"\u015a\u0101riputra! Even as that elder, though with power in body and arms, yet does > not use it but only by diligent tact resoutely saves [his] children from the > calamity of the burning house and then gives each of them great carts made > of precious things, so it is with the Tath\u0101gata; though he has power and > fearlessness, he does not use them, but only by his wise tact does he remove > and save all living creatures from the burning house of the triple world, > preaching the three vehicles: the \u015br\u0101vaka, pratyekabuddha, and Buddha > vehicle.Kat\u014d, Bunn\u014d (translator); revised by: Soothill, W.

Tokyo: Kosei Publishing > Co. , p. 89 In the parable, the carts are explicitly identified as corresponding to the three types of Buddha: the goat-cart represents the practices leading to the attainment of Arhatship; the deer-cart, Pratyekabuddhahood; and the bullock- cart, Samyaksambuddhahood. The sutra goes on to say these that the teachings of the three vehicles are merely expedient means (up\u0101ya). Their purpose is to direct people toward ekay\u0101na, the one vehicle, depicted in the parable as a jeweled cart driven by a white ox. ===The relationship of Dharma (Law) and Yana=== Tamura et al. render a section of the Innumerable Meanings Sutra (Wu- liang-i ching) that relates the relationship of the Law (Dharma) and various teachings as fundamentally determined by the audience and context: > \"Good sons! The Law is like water that washes off dirt. As a well, a > pond, a stream, a river, a valley stream, a ditch, or a great sea, each > alike effectively washes off all kinds of dirt, so the Law-water effectively > washes off the dirt of all delusions of living beings. > \"Good sons! The nature of water is one, but a stream, a river, a > well, a pond, a valley stream, a ditch, and a great sea are different from > one another. The nature of the Law is like this. There is equality and no > differentiation in washing off the dirt of delusions, but the three laws, > the four merits, and the two ways\u00a7 are not one and the same. > \"Good sons! Though each washes equally as water, a well is not a > pond, a pond is not a stream or a river, nor is a valley stream or a ditch a > sea.

Though preaching at the beginning, in > the middle, and at the end all alike effectively wash off the delusions of > living beings, the beginning is not the middle, and the middle is not the > end. Preaching at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end are the same > in expression but different from one another in meaning.Tamura, Yoshir\u014d > (translator); revised by: Schiffer, Wilhelm; and Del Campana, Pier P.

Tokyo: > Kosei Publishing Co. . pp. 14-15 \u00a7 The three laws are the Four Noble Truths, the Twelve Causes, and the Six P\u0101ramit\u0101s...; the four merits are srota-\u0101panna, sak\u1e5bd\u0101g\u0101min, an\u0101g\u0101min, and arhat...; and the two ways the Great-vehicle, or Mahayana, and the lesser vehicle, or Hinayana. ===Ekay\u0101na (one yana)=== Mahayana texts such as the Lotus Sutra and the Avatamsaka Sutra sought to unite all the different teachings into a single great way. These texts serve as the inspiration for using the term Ekay\u0101na in the sense of \"one vehicle\". This \"one vehicle\" became a key aspect of the doctrines and practices of Tiantai and Tendai Buddhist sects, which subsequently influenced Ch\u00e1n and Zen doctrines and practices. In Japan, the one-vehicle teaching of the Lotus Sutra also inspired the formation of the Nichiren sect. ===Two y\u0101nas=== Traditionally, the two vehicles in Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhism consist of \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na and Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na. Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists take a vow to become the third type, namely bodhisattvas. Therefore, Mahayana Buddhist texts sometimes use terms like \"followers of the two vehicles\" to refer to Buddhists who do not accept the Mahayana sutras. Some Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras consider that the two vehicles together comprise the H\u012bnay\u0101na \u2013 literally, inferior vehicle; sometimes, small vehicle. Modern texts sometimes refer to Mah\u0101y\u0101na and H\u012bnay\u0101na as \"two vehicles\". But referring to an \"inferior vehicle\" is often felt to be disrespectful to those Buddhists who do not consider the Mah\u0101y\u0101na sutras to be buddhavacana. ===Three y\u0101nas=== Mah\u0101y\u0101na Buddhists often express two different schemata of three yanas. First, here are three paths to liberation that culminate as one of the three types of Buddha: *\u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na: The Hearer vehicle: A path that meets the goals of an arhat who achieves liberation after listening to the teachings of a samyaksambuddha (fully enlightened buddha). *Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na: The Pratyekabuddha achieves liberation, but does not teach other beings. Pratyekabuddhas do not depend on a teacher and can discover the Dharma even if they do not encounter a buddha. They are sometimes said to remain silent and solitary. *Bodhisattvay\u0101na: The bodhisattva attains liberation and wishes to benefit as many beings as possible. A bodhisattva who has accomplished this goal is called a samyaksambuddha. A samyaksambuddha can establish the Dharma and lead disciples to enlightenment. A second classification came into use with the rise of the Vajray\u0101na, which created a hierarchy of the teachings with the Vajray\u0101na being the highest path. The Vajray\u0101na itself became multilayered especially in Tibetan Buddhism. * H\u012bnay\u0101na * Mah\u0101y\u0101na * Vajray\u0101na ===Four y\u0101nas=== Mahayana Buddhists sometimes refer to four yanas that subsume the two different schemes of the three yanas: * \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na * Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na * Mah\u0101y\u0101na * Vajray\u0101na ===Five y\u0101nas=== This is a Mah\u0101y\u0101na list which is found in East Asian Buddhism. * Puru\u1e63ay\u0101na - the human vehicle. This is the very beginning of the spiritual path * Devay\u0101na - the practice of ethics and meditation * \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na - the practice of renunciation and the Four Noble Truths * Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na - practice concerned with dependent arising (pratitya-samutpada) * Bodhisattvay\u0101na - practice of the Six Perfections ===Six y\u0101nas=== The five y\u0101nas plus the Vajray\u0101na. This schema is associated with Shingon Buddhism in Japan. It was invented by K\u016bkai in order to help to differentiate the Vajray\u0101na teachings that he imported from China in the early 9th century. K\u016bkai wanted to show that the new teachings were entirely new. ===Nine y\u0101nas=== The Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism has nine yanas, a list made by combining the first type of three yanas, and adding the six classes of tantras. *H\u012bnay\u0101na ** 1. \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na ** 2. Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na * Mah\u0101y\u0101na consisting of: ** 3. Bodhisattvay\u0101na ** Vajray\u0101na, consisting of: *** Outer Tantras **** 4. Kriyatantra **** 5. Upatantra (Tibetan spyod rgyud) \u2018practice tantra\u2019 and the Ubhayatantra (gnyis ka\u2019i rgyud), \u2018dual tantra\u2019, because it practices the view of the next vehicle, Yogatantra, together with the action of the former. **** 6. Yogatantra ***Inner Tantras **** 7. Mah\u0101yoga **** 8. Anuyoga ****9. Atiyoga (also Dzogchen) The head of the Nyingma school, Dudjom Rinpoche emphasizes the eight lower vehicles are intellectually fabricated and contrived: ===Twelve y\u0101nas=== Another schema associated with Mah\u0101y\u0101na and Vajray\u0101na sources: # \u015ar\u0101vakay\u0101na # Pratyekabuddhay\u0101na # Bodhisattvay\u0101na # Kriyayoga # Charyayoga (or Upayoga) # Yogatantra # Mahayoga # Anuyoga # AtiyogaThe Sanskrit \"Atiyoga\" may be rendered as \"primordial\" (ati) \"communion\" (yoga) and is also known by the Sanskrit: Mah\u0101sandhiyoga and in Tibetan: Dzogpa Chenpo and often rendered as Dzogchen in English. ## Semde ## Longde ## Mengagde ==See also== * Navayana * Vahana ==Notes== ==External links== * Brahmana Sutra (metta.lk) in Pali, Samyutta Nikaya IV.4 (scroll to middle of page, or Find... the word dhammay\u00e0na\u00fc) * Simile of the Dhamma Chariot (Dhammayana) (scroll downto the 5th entry) Partial translation of Samyutta Nikaya IV.4 * Sanskrit Dictionary based on The Practical Sanskrit- English Dictionary of Vaman Shivaram Apte Enter yaana in the search box * Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon Project.
