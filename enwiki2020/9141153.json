Established in 1987, the PCPA consists of three separate buildings: the Arlene Schnitzer Concert Hall, Antoinette Hatfield Hall, and Keller Auditorium. Hatfield Hall itself is sometimes erroneously referred to as the Portland Center for the Performing Arts. PCPA is the fifth-largest center for performing arts in the United States, with more than 1,000 performances and one million patrons annually (as of 2007). PCPA changed its name to \"Portland'5 Centers for the Arts\" in 2013. The \"5\" in the brand name is intended to highlight that the organization has five venues, counting separately the three theaters that occupy Antoinette Hatfield Hall. ==See also== *List of concert halls *Mark Hatfield ==References== ==External links== * Portland'5 Centers for the Performing Arts (official website) Category:1987 establishments in Oregon Category:Barton Myers buildings Category:Concert halls in the United States Category:Metro (Oregon regional government) Category:Music venues in Portland, Oregon Category:Organizations based in Portland, Oregon Category:Performing arts centers in Oregon Category:Theatres in Portland, Oregon ",
