    "text": "The Harpoon was a BBC Radio 4 series broadcast between 1991 and 1994, written by Julian Dutton and Peter Baynham. It consisted of three four-part series and two Christmas specials, and was performed by Julian Dutton, Peter Baynham, Susie Brann, Alistair McGowan and Mary Elliott-Nelson. It was produced (\"on stretched goat's vellum\") by Sarah Smith, the series was nominated for a British Comedy Award for Best Radio Comedy in 1992. The programme was a spoof of boys' comics from the Empire days of the 20th century, \"a magazine for young and old across the English-speaking world\" featuring \"Your old chum\" the Editor (McGowan) presenting regular features, adventure stories, practical advice, readers letters, etc., complete with advertisements. An enthusiastic young reader (Baynham) could be heard turning (and once accidentally tearing) the pages and occasionally commenting. Much of the humour rested upon anachronistic, politically incorrect attitudes towards such topics as education, class, sex, race, war, and the avuncular, paternalistic style adopted by interwar boys' publications like the Boy's Own Paper in addressing their readers. The reference to whaling in the title was underscored by the illustrated front cover of the magazine, i.e. the opening music/sound effects of the programme. Writing and performances on The Harpoon were of high quality, as was technical production, using 'authentic' voices, sound effects, and music to evoke the era and create the impression of a magazine being read. No commercial release of recordings was made, probably because of the use of copyright music, although episodes from all three series are regularly repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra. == Music == Among other pieces, some music found during the series: *Soldiers of the King by Leslie Stuart (used as opening theme). *Who's Been Polishing the Sun by Noel Gay, sung by Jack Hulbert (closing theme). *Yes, Yes, My Baby Said Yes, Yes by Con Conrad and Cliff Friend sung by Eddie Cantor (incidental music). *Gaudeamus Igitur traditional, (Maisie Drummond's school song) == Signature Sound Effect == A harpoon being fired and apparently hitting some large beast which expires with a theatrical groan that was added in Episode 2. == Recurring Features == As in a real magazine, certain features recur in many \"issues\" - * Front-Page - A picture of a whaling ship \"The Harpoon\" with \"oily-skinned sailors greasing their harpoons and dreaming of blubber\". * Title-Page - \"..with 6 color plates and numerous black-and-white illustrations..\", \"Price, sevenpence ha'penny net\" (with higher prices for special editions), \"..available throughout the Empire\", \"all rights reserved\". * Opening Page - introduced by \"Your Chum, The Editor\". * A Serial Feature ** Meadowfields Maisie - starring Maisie Drummond - school song \"Gaudeamus Igitur\" ** Harpoon Romance - The Brigands of Lanada - an adventure serial \"in the land of the Dago\" ** Harpoon Mystery - The Case of The Haunted Moustache * How To - written by the Rev.

Morris, which has features like \"How to build an uphill sledge\" -> by attaching a rope to a sledge. * Door To The Future - ridiculous predictions of what is to come based on a 1920s perspective. * Wonders of Nature - illustrated lifecycles of fictional \"creatures\". * Center Pages - where the \"cutout-and-keep\" gift is located. * True-Life Tales - tales of exploration and Empire, ** A sequence journals of expeditions to find other explorers starting with Edmund Colt's ala Henry Morton Stanley's search for Dr Livingstone. ** Ring of Fear - The life of Dimmy Dolt ** Collett, The Badger That Did Its Bit. * Comic Corner - Read out cels of comics usually with a weak pun as the basis * Baffling but Bona-Fide - \"fascinating facts at the foot of the page\". These \"facts\" are either trivial observations or non-sequiturs. * Boys/Families of Other Lands - xenophobic stereotypes of \"Johnny Foreigner\" including such peoples as the Italians \"Girls, a touch too keen to get his grubby hands on the contents of your bodice\" or the Welsh \"Bore-da to you, Evanses\".

Introduced by examples like \"from angina to Zulus, removal of\". * The Healthy Harpooner - talk of physical exertions. * Stamp Corner * Bird Scarer * Magic using a Goose as a Distraction * Notable FirePlaces of England == Characters == First Season Characters include - * The Reader - a schoolboy type prone to exclamations like \"Yaroo! Now for some Fun!\" * \"Postie\" - who delivers the magazine to The Reader, whistling as he does so, apparently tracking him down even when he is on vacation far away from his home. * The Editor (\"Your Old Chum\") - who presents both the \"front- piece\" - a read table of contents - and the Harpoon Club readers letters on the \"rear-pages\", with answers to (unstated) reader's questions, often for innuendo a la Round The Horne, or as inside jokes \"Well, Master A. Hitler, I'd give up the painting, if I were you, the samples showed little promise, why not try some other hobby, say, public speaking .. few guns might be handy\". All in a jolly, paternalistic, bombastic and often misogynistic style with sound effects suggesting additional off-mic activities (frequently shooting as he is evidently \"gun\" obsessed).

Author - Walrus-Clubbing for the Young at Heart * Meadowfields Characters ** Maisie Drummond - Plucky 14-year-old working-class school-girl solving crimes at her posh boarding school \"the most exclusive academy in England for young English-Women\" - located in the village of Slumber-on-the-Chintz. Weekly cliff-hangers which were improbably resolved, e.g., \"with the help of this gun I happen to have\". She has a former milkman's horse called \"Milko\" who has only 3-legs and so is referred to as \"Crooked Milko\" with which she attempts to win the Gymkana using his \"superior dressage skills\". Using a blend of class styles, she writes letters home with Cockney rhyming-slang expressions but addresses the letter to \"Mater and Pater\". Presumably her surname refers to Bulldog Drummond. Her sleuthing is made easier by all villains she encounters having cloth caps, \"distorted facial features\", and all using binoculars. ** Princess Tarin Addabadaba - Maisie Drummond's best friend, with an Anglo-Indian accent. She keeps getting kidnapped. Her mount is called Murray Mint. ** The Eight Mildreds - Maisie Drummond's school-chums, who all speak in chorus. They all ride ponies called Dobbin. ** Bertha - Maisie and the Mildred's \"rotund chum\" who is \"fat, wears glasses and likes jam tarts, but is a good egg really\". ** Miss Snape - Scottish Headmistress of MeadowFields. Name possible reference to Severus Snape. Turns out to be the leader of the white-slavers.

Morton in Beachcomber By The Way. In the first series, these were introduced with the titles of prior publications they had written for additional comedic effect. * Reverend A. Morris - HowTo features - Prior Works - How to Build a ..Wheelbarrow, ..Sledge, ..Chicken-Coop, ..WorkBench, ..Lectern, ..Goose- Restrictor, ..Wig.
