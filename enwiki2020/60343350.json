The project is carried out within the framework of the International North\u2013South Transport Corridor. The purpose of the project is to integrate the transport and information routes of Russia, Azerbaijan, Iran and India. == History == The agreement on the route's construction was signed by three parties (Iran, Azerbaijan and Russia) in 2005. The most challenging section from an engineering point of view was the construction of the railway between Rasht and Ghazvin which started in 2009 and took nearly a decade to complete. That section of the line opened in November 2018. The bridge and short section of track between Iranian and Azerbaijani Astara was completed in March 2017. Astara link railway opens The first arrival of a train coming all the way from Russia to Iranian Astara was documented on February 8, 2018. Immediately after putting into operation the section Astara (Azerbaijan) - Astara (Iran) in 2018, the Iranian section of the railway together with the Astara station and the newly built cargo terminal was leased to Azerbaijan for a period of 25 years. During 11 months, more than 270 thousand tons of cargo was transported via this railway. As of early 2019, the construction of the Rasht-Astara leg remained at a 'study and review stage' but with approval granted in Iran as of January and around half of the estimated cost ($1.1 billion) secured by a preferential loan of $500 million from Azerbaijan. Some press reports claim that track laying is should be complete by 2021. == See also == *Baku\u2013Tbilisi\u2013Kars railway *Pipelines in Azerbaijan == References == Category:Pipeline transport Category:Railway lines in Azerbaijan ",
