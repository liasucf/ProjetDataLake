    "text": "Swallows and Amazons is a 1974 British film adaption of the 1930 novel of the same name by Arthur Ransome. The film, which was directed by Claude Whatham and produced by Richard Pilbrow, starred Virginia McKenna and Ronald Fraser, and a young Zanna Hamilton. Its budget was provided by Nat Cohen of EMI Films who had funded the successful 1970 film The Railway Children.Tim Devlin. \"A day in the life of Swallows and Amazons.\" Times [London, England] 20 June 1973: 12. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 14 July 2012. ==Plot== During the school holidays, the Walker children (John, Susan, Titty and Roger) are staying at a farm near a lake in the Lake District. While sailing a borrowed dinghy named Swallow, they meet the Blackett children (Nancy and Peggy) who sail a dinghy named Amazon. The Walkers camp on an island in the lake while the Blacketts live in their house nearby. However, they soon realise this has been the territory of the two other girls who sail the Amazon, and the scene is set for serious rivalry. Eventually they make friends and agree to join forces against a common enemy \u2013 the Blacketts' Uncle Jim whom they call \"Captain Flint\" (after the character in Treasure Island). Uncle Jim, normally an ally of his nieces, has withdrawn from their company to write his memoirs and has become decidedly unfriendly. To determine who should be the overall leader in their campaign against Captain Flint, the Blacketts and the Walkers have a contest to see which can capture the others' boat. As part of their strategy the Walkers make a dangerous crossing of the lake by night, and John is later cautioned by his mother for this reckless act. The Walkers nevertheless win the contest \u2013 thanks to Titty who seizes the Amazon when the Blacketts come to Wild Cat Island. Eventually there is a mock battle between \"Captain Flint\" and the children, after which Uncle Jim is tried for his crimes and forced to walk the plank on his own houseboat. They agree at the post-battle feast to be friends forever. ==Cast== *Virginia McKenna - Mrs. Walker *Ronald Fraser - Uncle Jim *Simon West - John Walker *Suzanna Hamilton - Susan Walker (credited as Zanna Hamilton) *Sophie Neville - Titty Walker *Stephen Grendon - Roger Walker *Kit Seymour - Nancy Blackett *Lesley Bennett - Peggy Blackett *Mike Pratt - Mr. Dixon *Brenda Bruce - Mrs. Dixon *John Franklyn-Robbins - Young Billy *Jack Woolgar - Old Billy *David Blagden - Policeman ==Production== The film was shot on location in the Lake District National Park in Cumbria during the summer of 1973.
