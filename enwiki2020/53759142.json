In 1885, Judge Bonham was appointed Consul-General to British India, and removed his family to Calcutta the same year. Bonham always had a liking for literary work, but the cares of a large family and social duties gave her little leisure time, and it was not until her residence abroad that the opportunity came. During five years, her letters over the name \" Mizpah\" attracted much attention and were widely circulated by the Oregon and California press. Bonham had a gift of observing closely, and her descriptions of foreign scenes made a valuable addition to the knowledge of Anglo-Indian life and customs. Her letters from the Himalayas, Ceylon and other far-off places were considered the best. After returning to the United States, she gave several lectures on her experiences in the far East and life among the Zenanas. ==Personal life== There were seven children from her marriage, only two of whom survived, Raphael P. Bonham, United States Immigration Inspector, stationed at Astoria, Oregon, and Mrs. Winona Larkins, of Salem. She died July 28, 1907, in Salem, one of the oldest pioneer residents of that city. Her papers are held in the Special Collections of the University of California, Santa Barbara. ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * * ==External links== * Category:1840 births Category:1907 deaths Category:19th-century American women writers Category:19th-century American non-fiction writers Category:People from Putnam County, Illinois Category:American travel writers Category:Writers from Illinois Category:Writers from Salem, Oregon Category:American women non- fiction writers ",
