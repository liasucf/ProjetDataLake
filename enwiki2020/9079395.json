    "text": "WMTX is an adult contemporary radio station in Tampa, Florida known as \"Mix 100.7\". It plays a variety of current hits along with some hit music from the past, as far back as the 1980s. Owned by iHeartMedia, the station's studios are located in South Tampa and the transmitter site is in Riverview. WMTX also serves as the primary Emergency Alert System station for all of Tampa Bay. ==Station history== In 1947, the station signed on the air as WDAE-FM, a contemporary music station (though it would carry the WATL call letters for a two-year period). In 1976, the station flipped to beautiful music and the callsign changed to WAVV. During the WAVV years, the station's tagline was \"Waves of Beautiful Music\". In 1978, the callsign changed to WJYW. In 1982, the station flipped from beautiful music to adult contemporary and the callsign changed to WIQI (\"W-101\"). In 1986, the callsign changed to WUSA-FM (named after Washington D.C. TV station WUSA-TV), while still being named \"W-101\" before rebranding as simply \"101 WUSA\" in July 1994.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1994/RR-1994-07-01.pdf \"See ya, W-101, your number's up - sort of\", St. Petersburg Times (July 1, 1994) - dead link In December 1996, after Gannett traded the station to Jacor, the station flipped to hot adult contemporary and rebranded as \"Kiss 100.7\", with the call letters changing to WUKS.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1996/R&R-1996-12-13.pdf; In 1998, the call letters were changed to WAKS. During the \"Kiss\" era, the station was the home of the popular, locally syndicated Mason Dixon Morning Show. On August 28, 1999, at Midnight, the station became \"Mix 100.7\", and the callsign changed to WMTX (which was first used on 95.7 as \"Mix 96\"). Community outrage was highly noted in local newspapers and on other radio stations.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1999/RR-1999-09-03.pdf Under the \"Mix\" branding, the station went to a mainstream adult contemporary format. The station initially carried Casey's Top 20 countdown, hosted by Casey Kasem, and Backtrax USA. The format would later shift to adult top 40. In 2019, for the first time in the history of \"Mix\", the station flipped to Christmas music for the holiday season, a week before WDUV or WJIS/WCIE usually flip to Christmas music.https://radioinsight.com/headlines/181953/wmtx-makes-first-time- christmas-move/ In 2020, WMTX shifted to adult contemporary. ==Signal== WMTX transmits from a tower in Riverview, Florida, shared with six other FM radio stations, and nearly all of the TV stations serving Tampa Bay. WMTX's signal is powered at 100,000 watts at 1,549 ft height above average terrain. With a good radio, the station can be heard in the Orlando and Cape Coral areas. ==WMTX-HD2== Former logo of WMTX-HD2 In early 2007, WMTX launched an HD2 subcarrier with a Soft AC format.
