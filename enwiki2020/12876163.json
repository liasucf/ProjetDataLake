    "text": "\"The Con is On\" is the first episode in the British television drama series Hustle that was first broadcast on 24 February 2004. The episode begins the series created by Tony Jordan, and made by Kudos Film & Television for BBC One in the United Kingdom. ==Plot== The episode begins with Michael Stone's release from prison. Tricking Ash, Stacie and Albert into believing that he is to carry out one last con before he retires, Mickey forms a group to perform an investment scam on a businessman, Peter Williams, telling him to invest with brilliant returns. Danny, having not impressed Mickey earlier in the episode, turns up at a key moment in the con to convince Williams to take part, gaining him entry to the group. However, Danny is approached by police officers who tell him to testify to shorten the trial, and in a confrontation with Mickey, Mickey is shot in the head. Danny is faced with a choice: either testify against the other members of the group or go to prison with them. When he refuses, it is revealed that this dilemma was simply a test, Mickey isn't dead, and that the man leading the police investigation was a fellow con artist, as Stacy had stolen another Policeman's ID. ==Cast== *Michael \"Mickey Bricks\" Stone \u2014 Adrian Lester *Danny Blue \u2014 Marc Warren *Stacie Monroe \u2014 Jaime Murray *Ash \"Three Socks\" Morgan \u2014 Robert Glenister *Albert Stroller \u2014 Robert Vaughn *Eddie \u2014 Rob Jarvis *Peter Williams \u2014 James Laurenson *DS Terri Hodges \u2014 Liz May Brice *DCI Mullens \u2014 Ken Bones *Neil Cooper/DePalma \u2014 Tom Mannion ==Production== *In the opening shot of the series Mickey Bricks addresses the camera, and thus the audience directly, breaking the fourth wall. Clearly the creators have established that this is a story-telling device that they will use throughout the series. ===Viewing figures=== *It hit 6.7 million viewers, greater than the 5.5 million viewers that watched the football match shown on rival channel ITV. ==Cultural references== *Upon first meeting Danny, Mickey comments \"I bet you've even watched The Sting\". Later in the episode, when Danny gate-crashes the con, Mickey introduces Danny as 'Mr Redford'. Also the con pulled in the episode is nearly identical to the con pulled in The Sting. ==References== *The Con is On at TV.com ==External links== *The Con is On at the Internet Movie Database Category:2004 British television episodes Category:British television pilots es:La movida (serie de TV) fr:Les Arnaqueurs VIP it:Hustle - I signori della truffa sr:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438 (\u0441\u0435\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430) fi:Kelmien kerho ",
