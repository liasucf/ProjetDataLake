    "text": "Anne Jennifer Dudley (n\u00e9e Beckingham; born 7 May 1956) is an English composer, keyboardist, conductor and pop musician. She was the first BBC Concert Orchestra's Composer in Association in 2001. She has worked in the classical and pop genres, as a film composer, and was one of the core members of the synthpop band Art of Noise. In 1998, Dudley won an Oscar for Best Original Musical or Comedy Score for The Full Monty. In addition to over twenty other film scores, in 2012 she served as music producer for the film version of Les Mis\u00e9rables, also acting as arranger and composing some new additional music. ==Career== Dudley was born in Beckenham, Kent. She graduated with a master's in music from King's College London in 1978. Trained as a classical performer, she moved into the competitive commercial field as a session musician, where her professional relationship with Trevor Horn began. In 1982 Dudley made significant contributions to the Horn-produced The Lexicon of Love album by ABC. She went from fleshing-out keyboard parts to scoring the album's orchestrations (which were, according to Horn, her first-ever string arrangements) and also co-writing some of the songs. In 2019 she conducted the Southbank Sinfonia during Martin Fry's Lexicon of Love tour. Dudley's association with Horn led on to working with artists such as Frankie Goes to Hollywood, Seal, Marc Almond, Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams and, more recently, Siphiwo. She has co-written songs with Malcolm McLaren (\"Buffalo Gals\"), Cathy Dennis (\"Too Many Walls\"), and a 1930s-inspired song with Sting called \"This Was Never Meant To Be\". She produced the Tom Jones hit \"You Can Leave Your Hat On\" (1988) and a Debbie Harry single \"Strike Me Pink\" (1993). Dudley produced two tracks on the 2002 Opera Babes album Beyond Imagination (ranking No.1 on the UK classical charts for 11 weeks, and No.4 on the US billboard charts). In 2004 she produced the album Voice for Alison Moyet. The album, an eclectic collection of cover versions, reached No.7 in the UK Albums Chart. Dudley was a founding member of the successful band Art of Noise, which helped pioneer the use of sampling within the pop genre. Their stand-out hits include \"Beat Box\" (1984), \"Moments in Love\" (1985), \"Close (to the Edit)\" (1984) and, with Tom Jones, \"Kiss\" (1988). Her works for orchestra include \"Northern Lights\", a 14-minute reflection of Norway's Aurora Borealis for full orchestra, performed in 2005 and 2006 at the Royal Festival Hall and broadcast on BBC Radio 3's Late Junction programme in May 2005. Her first commission as Composer in Association with the BBC Concert Orchestra was \"Music and Silence\", inspired by the novel of the same name by Rose Tremain and first performed at The Royal Festival Hall in 2002. Dudley arranged Bach's Chaconne from Partita in D minor for piano trio, and a recording by the Eroica Trio appears on their Baroque album. Her album Ancient and Modern, with modern versions of some traditional hymns and Bach chorales, was released in 1999. She was the musical director for Bill Bailey's Remarkable Guide to the Orchestra, first performed in Brighton then at the Royal Albert Hall in 2008, which was recorded and released as a DVD in December 2009. The show was toured in 2009 with eight different regional orchestras participating. It involved the orchestra playing the Nokia theme tune and a french horn concerto evolving into the theme from Coronation Street. Dudley collaborated with Sam Taylor-Wood in producing the sound and video installation Sigh at the White Cube in 2008. This work featured the BBC Concert Orchestra on eight large projected screens, miming to Dudley's score. === Film scores === Dudley's career in film music has spanned 20 years and her film scores include: *Buster (1988), a British comedy drama starring musician Phil Collins, Julie Walters, Larry Lamb and Sheila Hancock; *Silence Like Glass (Zwei Frauen) (1989), German-made but set in a cancer ward at a hospital in America; *The Pope Must Die (1991), a comedy film starring Robbie Coltrane the score of which was co-written with Jeff Beck; *Knight Moves (1992), an American thriller directed by Carl Schenkel and starring Christopher Lambert; *The Crying Game (1992), an Irish/British drama film written and directed by Neil Jordan; *Felidae (1994) *The Grotesque (1995), released in the US as Gentlemen Don't Eat Poets a British film starring Alan Bates, Theresa Russell and Sting; *Hollow Reed (1996), a drama directed by Angela Pope and set in Bath; *The Full Monty (1997), a Peter Cattaneo-directed comedy about six unemployed steel workers who decide to form a male striptease act.
