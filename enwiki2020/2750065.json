On 26 February, she put to sea from Galena, Texas bound for Trinidad and Guantanamo Bay and then to a re-fueling rendezvous with fleet tugs and . On 2 April, she arrived at Bermuda for a three-day stay. Departing Bermuda she steamed north for Philadelphia, Norfolk, and then on to NS Argentia, Newfoundland, and back to Norfolk. In the following months, Noxubee continued to operate out of Norfolk, transporting petroleum products to Argentia, Newfoundland; Goose Bay, Labrador; the Azores and Iceland. On 16 November 1947, Newport, Rhode Island, became her base of operations. From there she shuttled gasoline and oil to bases in Greenland and Newfoundland, and even made a few trips south to Texas and other Gulf States. From 6 March to 3 April 1950, Noxubee crossed the Atlantic from Newport with a liquid cargo for Casablanca, French Morocco, returning to Norfolk. A similar voyage was made from 23 January to 5 March 1951, with Naples, Italy added to her itinerary. After returning home, she made trips to Bermuda, Cuba, and to Newfoundland. She once again departed Norfolk 14 July, this time for duty with the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean. Noxubee was based in Tripoli, Libya and replenished units of the Sixth Fleet in ports of Italy, France, Greece, Algiers and Malta. She departed Tripoli on 20 April 1952 and arrived in New York on 4 May. Following a period of upkeep in the Norfolk and Boston Naval Shipyards, Noxubee was based at Newport until 12 March 1953, when she again sailed to join the Sixth Fleet.

She was decommissioned on 6 March 1959, and was assigned to the Florida Group, U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet until her name was struck from the Navy List on 1 July 1960. Noxubee was transferred to the Maritime Administration until placed on the Navy List for activation in 1965. ==1965-1970== On 10 September 1966, following a seven-month outfitting and modernization period at Baltimore, Noxubee was recommissioned at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, LT Howard Pabst commanding. One month later she sailed for Pearl Harbor, Hawaii via the Panama Canal as a unit of Service Squadron Five. Following refresher training at Pearl Harbor, Noxubee deployed to the western Pacific on 9 March 1967. During that deployment she supported advanced fuel bases along the coast of I Corps, South Vietnam. On 2 August 1967, Noxubee departed Da Nang for Sasebo and Yokosuka, Japan. During her return trip to Pearl Harbor Noxubee was diverted to Wake Island to assist in the salvage of a grounded civilian tanker. She finally arrived at Pearl Harbor on 22 September 1967. While conducting a training cruise off the coast of Oahu on 24 November, Noxubee spotted and rescued the sole survivor of a fishing boat accident. On 17 April 1968, Noxubee departed Hawaii for her second WESTPAC cruise. Noxubee headed directly for Vietnam for three months of continuous operations. In August Noxubee received the Battle Efficiency Pennant for fiscal year 1968. On 28 October, Noxubee came under enemy artillery fire while anchored off C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t, escaping unharmed. During this deployment Noxubee set the all-time record for AOGs by pumping 20 million gallons of petroleum products and earning a Meritorious Unit Commendation. Noxubee returned to Pearl Harbor in December 1968. Following six months of upkeep and training Noxubee again departed Pearl Harbor for Vietnam on 2 June 1969 with LT D. E. Cass commanding. Operating out of Da Nang, she made frequent trips to Sa Huynh, Tan My and C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t. On 9 September 1969 Noxubee was mined by enemy swimmers while anchored at C\u1eeda Vi\u1ec7t. The explosion created a three by five-foot hole in her hull but the crew suffered no casualties. Temporary repairs were quickly accomplished at Da Nang and she was back on station in less than a week. At the end of the month Noxubee traveled to Subic Bay for permanent repairs. In addition to Subic Bay, Noxubee also visited Hong Kong and Sasebo, Japan during this deployment. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 6 February 1970. ==1970-1975== Noxubee departed Pearl Harbor on 18 May 1970 for her new homeport at Little Creek, Virginia and duty with Service Squadron Eight. The trip to the east coast included stops at Long Beach, California, Acapulco, Mexico, and the Panama Canal. Noxubee deployed for five months in the Mediterranean on 28 December 1970 still under the command of LCDR Cass. Her duties centered around Amphibious Task Force 61 with occasional replenishments of other Sixth Fleet ships. She also accomplished one month's surveillance of the Soviet Union Mediterranean Fleet. Upon return to Little Creek Noxubee undertook a major overhaul at the Brambleton plant of Norfolk Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company. After completion of the overhaul and refresher training, Noxubee again deployed for the Mediterranean. Noxubee refueled ships ranging from LPH to PG types, pumping some 3,881,078 gallons of fuel. In May and July, the ship participated in exercises Dawn Patrol and National Week. Although primarily assigned to service Amphibious Task Force 61, Noxubee re-fueled destroyers throughout the Mediterranean. Port visits included Rota and Barcelona, Spain; Naples, Italy; Athens, Corfu, and Thera, Greece and the French Riviera. Noxubee returned to Little Creek on 14 August. After returning home the ship provided refueling services to units of the Mine Force off Charleston, South Carolina. On two separate occasions during December 1972 Noxubee was assigned to refuel destroyers on Atlantic Ocean station. During the first half of 1973 Noxubee underwent an RAV (Restricted Availability Period) during which many repairs were made. Upon completion of the RAV the ship conducted underway replenishment operations off the Eastern Coast of the U.S., as well as a refresher training period. These operations included the refueling of four destroyers and ten minesweepers In 1973, LT Michael Mullen, USN assumed command of Noxubee. Mullen would eventually attain the rank of Admiral, would eventually become Chief of Naval Operations and ultimately the US military's senior ranking officer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.http://ebird.osd.mil/ebfiles/e20081228647198.html During Mullen's command, Noxubee collided with a buoy in the Chesapeake.\"Mullen: Learn From Mistakes and Move On.\" Donna Miles, American Forces Press Service Sept. 22, 2011. https://archive.defense.gov/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=65424 On 6 June 1973, Noxubee sailed for operations with the Sixth Fleet.

Noxubee returned to Little Creek in November. From December 1973, to May 1974, Noxubee underwent an RAV period. After a training cruise to Bermuda and the Bahamas, Noxubee departed for the Mediterranean on 4 October 1974 for her final deployment to the Sixth Fleet. Noxubee visited 13 foreign ports and transferred over 5 million gallons of fuel while traveling over 17,000 miles. On 11 April 1975, Noxubee returned to Little Creek, Virginia for the last time. Over the next ten weeks Noxubee was stripped of all salvageable gear and prepared for decommissioning. The decommissioning ceremony was held at Pier 12 Naval Amphibious Base Little Creek, Virginia. At 1400 hours 1 July 1975, Noxubee was officially stricken from the list of active US Naval Ships. == Military awards and honors == Noxubee was awarded six campaign stars for Vietnam War service: * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase II * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase III * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase IV * Vietnam Counteroffensive - Phase V * Vietnam Summer-Fall 1969 * Vietnam Winter-Spring 1970 Noxubee\u2019s crew was eligible for the following medals, ribbons, and commendations (shown in order of precedence): * Combat Action Ribbon (28 Oct.1968 and 9 Sept. 1969) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation * Battle \"E\" Ribbon * American Campaign Medal * World War II Victory Medal * Navy Occupation Service Medal (with Europe Clasp) * National Defense Service Medal * Vietnam Service Medal (6) * Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Commendation (5) * Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal ==References== * *This article includes text from the USS Noxubee Webpage . ==External links== *USS Noxubee AOG-56 Webpage * NavSource Online: Service Ship Photo Archive - AOG-56 Noxubee Category:Patapsco-class gasoline tankers Category:Ships built in Savage, Minnesota Category:1945 ships Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Vietnam War auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Ship bombings ",
