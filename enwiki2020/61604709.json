Beginning with their walk \u201cto the schools and back\u201d in Wilde\u2019s Act II, we begin to learn how these well- educated but impecunious individuals have survived on the lower rungs of Victorian society. Continuing with their time offstage in Act III, we learn that far from being the models of propriety they appear in public, both have been forced to make ends meet in less than ethical and legal fashion. They find themselves mutually dependent to ensure their survival. But no sooner has The Importance ended happily, than one of the duo turns the tables on the other. ==Productions== To Hell in a Handbag was originally seen in the Dublin Fringe Festival in September 2016. Supported by the Show in a Bag initiativeShow In A Bag Irish Theatre Institute of Dublin Fringe Festival, Fishamble: The New Play Company and the Irish Theatre Institute, it premiered at Bewley\u2019s Caf\u00e9 Theatre on September 14th 2016.
