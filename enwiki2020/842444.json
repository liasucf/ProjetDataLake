    "text": "J\u00f6nssonligan, literally the J\u00f6nsson Gang, is a Swedish comedy film series, originally based on the Danish series of films about the Olsen-banden, but later with unique scripts. The J\u00f6nsson gang consists of the leader and criminal genius Charles Ingvar \"Sickan\" J\u00f6nsson, hence the name, and his two companions \"Dynamit-Harry\" (an alcoholic demolitions expert) and Ragnar Vanheden (a small-timer from Stockholm). Eight films have been made in total, though in the last three films actor G\u00f6sta Ekman got tired of his character \"Sickan\", and was replaced by the following characters, in order; \"Doctor Max Adrian Bus\u00e9\", \"Herman Melvin\" and \"Sven-Ingvar 'Sivan' J\u00f6nsson\". The first two films featured the character Rocky, a Swedish-speaking Finn as member of the gang. He was eventually replaced by \"Dynamit-Harry\" who first appeared in the second film. J\u00f6nssonligans arch-enemy is Jacob Morgan Rockefeller Wall-Enberg Jr. - somewhat of a cross between a business magnate and a ruthless mob boss - who in all the films have been played by Per Grund\u00e9n. His name alludes to the real-life Swedish business magnates Anders Wall and the Wallenberg family . Wall-Enbergs henchman is Biffen. In every film except for J\u00f6nssonligan dyker upp igen and J\u00f6nssonligan p\u00e5 Mallorca he has been played by Weiron Holmberg. In J\u00f6nssonligan dyker upp igen he is played by Lars Dejert and in J\u00f6nssonligan p\u00e5 Mallorca he never appears. The main series has also created a spin-off series called Lilla J\u00f6nssonligan (Little J\u00f6nsson gang), which portrays the main three characters of the series as kids. The only recurring in all the Lilla J\u00f6nssonligan is Loa Falkman who plays Wall-Enberg Jr's father Oscar Wall-Enberg Sr. A reboot named J\u00f6nssonligan \u2013 Den perfekta st\u00f6ten with new actors in the roles was released on 16 January 2015. The film was the first since J\u00f6nssonligan & Dynamit-Harry to feature the line-up Sickan, Vanheden, Rocky and Dynamit-Harry and the first not to feature Wall-Enberg. The film was not commercially successful.https://www.moviezine.se/nyheter/jonssonligan-kan- bli-tv-serie A second reboot is set to premiere in 2019.https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/film/a/21e6Qq/jonssonligan- flyttar-till-norrkoping https://archive.today/20180714112957/https://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/film/a/21e6Qq/jonssonligan- flyttar-till-norrkoping == List of movies and main characters == ===Varning f\u00f6r J\u00f6nssonligan (Beware of the J\u00f6nsson Gang, 1981)=== Character: Actor *Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson (Sickan): G\u00f6sta Ekman (jr) *Ragnar Vanheden: Ulf Brunnberg *Rocky: Nils Brandt ===J\u00f6nssonligan & Dynamit-Harry (The J\u00f6nsson Gang & Dynamite-Harry, 1982)=== Character: Actor *Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson (Sickan): G\u00f6sta Ekman (jr) *Ragnar Vanheden: Ulf Brunnberg *Rocky: Nils Brandt *Dynamit-Harry: Bj\u00f6rn Gustafson ===J\u00f6nssonligan f\u00e5r guldfeber (The J\u00f6nsson Gang gets Gold Fever, 1984)=== Character: Actor *Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson (Sickan): G\u00f6sta Ekman (jr) *Ragnar Vanheden: Ulf Brunnberg *Dynamit-Harry: Bj\u00f6rn Gustafson ===J\u00f6nssonligan dyker upp igen (The J\u00f6nsson Gang Resurface, 1986)=== Character: Actor *Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson (Sickan): G\u00f6sta Ekman (jr) *Ragnar Vanheden: Ulf Brunnberg *Dynamit-Harry: Bj\u00f6rn Gustafson ===J\u00f6nssonligan p\u00e5 Mallorca (The J\u00f6nsson Gang in Mallorca, 1989)=== Character: Actor *Charles Ingvar J\u00f6nsson (Sickan): G\u00f6sta Ekman (jr) *Ragnar Vanheden: Ulf Brunnberg *Dynamit-Harry: Bj\u00f6rn Gustafson ===J\u00f6nssonligan & den svarta diamanten (The J\u00f6nsson Gang & the Black Diamond, 1992)=== Character: Actor *M.
