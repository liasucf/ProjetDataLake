Most of the athletes who compete in Metro-sponsored swim meets are youths under the age of 18. However, there are also opportunities for older members of the swimming community to compete. ==Location== Metro is one of the 59 sub-divided areas by the National Governing Board, which is USA Swimming. The area that Metro covers is New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, Rockland, Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, and Sullivan Counties in New York State. ==Athlete Members== Nearly 10,000 individuals are registered Metro athlete members, one of the largest in all areas of USA Swimming. These athletes compete across approximately 75 different swim clubs in about as many facilities. The level of competition across the clubs varies greatly, from recreational swimming to Olympians. Some of the notable athletes who have come from Metro include Cristina Teuscher, Jenny Thompson, Julia Smit, Lia Neal, Philip Scholz, and Rick Carey. ==Club Members== There are 75 swim teams registered as members of Metropolitan Swimming. ==Competitions and Events== Metro sanctions about 115 swimming competitions per year. Most of these are competed in Short Course Yards, then Long Course Meters, and one Open Water Championship. ===Age Group Invitational=== ===Silver Championship=== The 2014 Metro Silver Championships are held on March 1 to March 3, 2014 at various locations depending on Metro section (Northern, Central, Southern, etc.). Junior Olympic cuts can be achieved here, but awards are given to only Silver swimmers and JO qualifiers will not receive awards.

All swimmers from Metro are allowed to attend within the Metropolitan LSC. This meet is considered one of the top meets for the 10 and under and 11-12 age groups. A notable performance at the recent Junior Olympics Championships was that of Nick Torres, who swept all of the individual events in the 11-12 age group. Also, the dominating Team Suffolk 11-12 boys 400 medley relay broke a Metropolitan Record. On that relay was Justin Meyn, Nikolas Daly, Kabir Randhawa, and Dylan Champagne. ===Zone Team Qualifier=== The 2013 Zone Team Qualifier takes place at Lehman College, Bronx and will invite all or most Metropolitan teams.
