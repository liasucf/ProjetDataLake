    "text": "Grave at Arlington National Cemetery William Edward Nordeen (October 9, 1936 \u2013 June 28, 1988) was an American diplomat. Born in Amery, Wisconsin and raised in nearby Centuria, he was the United States defense and naval attach\u00e9 to the U.S. Embassy in Athens, Greece. Nordeen was killed in Greece by a terrorist group's bomb. The 51-year-old US Navy captain was driving in an armor-plated sedan near Athens when a car bomb was detonated next to him via remote control. He was thrown from the car and killed by the blast. Nordeen was survived by his wife, Patricia, son William E. Nordeen II and daughter Annabel. Patricia died in 2019. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. The Greek urban guerrilla Marxist organization 17 November claimed the blast, making Nordeen one of five American embassy employees killed by the organization. They threatened to kill more Americans until the United States abandoned its military bases in Greece. ==Notes== Category:1936 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Murder in 1988 Category:United States Navy officers Category:American diplomats Category:Assassinated American diplomats Category:Assassinated military personnel Category:Burials at Arlington National Cemetery Category:Deaths by car bomb Category:Victims of the Revolutionary Organization 17 November Category:American terrorism victims Category:Terrorism deaths in Greece Category:American people murdered abroad Category:People murdered in Greece Category:People from Amery, Wisconsin Category:Military personnel from Wisconsin Category:American military personnel killed in action ",
