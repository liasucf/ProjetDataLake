    "text": "2018 Idaho Proposition 2 is an approved ballot initiative that was included on the 2018 General Election ballot on November 6th, 2018. Idaho's Proposition 2 is an initiative which addressed the proposed Medicaid gap within the state. This Ballot Initiative was approved and qualified to be included for voting on July 17th, 2018 through campaigning and petitioning for signatures to acquire the necessary support of the voting Idaho population to be included for state- wide voting through the 2018 General Election ballot. This initiative moved to expand Medicaid to persons who did not previously qualify. Proposition 2 would expand Medicaid coverage to persons under the age of 65 if their income is below 133% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL) and are unable to gain medical insurance or coverage through other means. The estimated amount for Medicaid expansion in Idaho is 105 million dollars. Many studies have found that in total expansion states have saved around 6.2 billion dollars in uncompensated care between 2013 and 2015. == Campaign and supporters == A grassroots canvassing drive was held in order to gain enough signatures of registered voters in the prerequisite number of legislative districts in order to place the proposition on the ballot for the 2018 midterm elections. The drive was able to successfully obtain the needed number of signatures, a total of 56,192 signatures in at least 18 of the 35 state's legislative districts, and by the end of the drive over 70,000 signatures were collected. Within the campaigning and petitioning portion to gain access to this proposition being listed on the election ballot, there were many officials and organizations that supported this Medicare expansion and worked to help gain the necessary support to allow this topic to be added onto the 2018 General Election voting Ballot in Idaho. Medicaid expansion was supported by many officials, among the supports was the Democratic gubernatorial candidate Paulette Jordan. There were two major committees that supported Proposition 2 and played a large role within the campaigning and petitioning to get enough support to warrant Proposition 2 onto the 2018 General Election Ballot were the Idahoans for Healthcare and Reclaim Idaho. Together the committees managed to raise nearly two million dollars in support of the proposition. Methodist Cathedral of the Rockies. There were also many persons and organizations that did not support Proposition 2, primarily the newly formed political action committee Work, Not Obamacare PAC, an offshoot of the Idaho Freedom Foundation. == Proposition == The proposition was designed to address the Medicare gap that existed within the state by expanding Medicaid eligibility.

The results were in favor for the proposition, with 60.6% of voters supporting and 39.4% opposing. == Alteration == This initiative was later modified to include requirements for Medicaid recipients to meet further qualifications to gain eligibility for the expanded program through the establishment of Senate Bill 1204. The official legislation in regards to this Senate Bill can be found _here_. This alteration added requirements to ensure working hours, education hours, volunteerism, or qualification in programs such was TANF or SNAP to gain access to the expanded Medicaid benefits.

However, was challenged in court in a lawsuit directly after the initiative was passed within the 2018 General Election. There has been one lawsuit in regards to Proposition 2, since it was approved through the 2018 General Election. This lawsuit was: Brent Regan v. Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney and was filed within the Idaho Supreme Court. The Plaintiff, Brent Regan, made the argument that through the passing of Proposition 2, the initiative violates the constitutional right of the state and the Medicaid expansion within Idaho delegates too much power to the Federal Government. This case was found to be ruled in favor of the Defendant, Idaho Secretary of State Lawerence Denney. The court ruled that Regan's concerns were based within the hypothetical and the judiciary branch was not the appropriate mediary at this time. The courts stated within their case report conclusion section that the voting results have proven the voice of the people within the State and it is now within the hands of the legislative branch of government. The case that Regan has proposed is not a constitutional issue and has been brought to the attention of the courts prematurely. == Current status == Medicaid Expansion By State as of November 2018 Since the events of Proposition 2 being passed, there are currently 36 states in which Medicaid has been expanded within due to voter initiatives in each state. Within 2019, there are still 14 states which have not passed medicare expansion initiatives. Through the Medicaid expansion efforts it is reported to have increased yearly coverage for persons earning up to 138% of the Federal Poverty Level. The success of the campaign has been noted as an example of rural conservative voters voting for liberal measures. == References == ==External links== *Idahoans For Health Care Information: IdahoansForHealthCare.org & https://www.idmed.org/idaho/assets/files/News/IFH_FAQ.pdf * The grassroots organization, Reclaim Idaho: ReclaimIdaho.org * *Senate Bill 1204 Official Legislation Bill: https://legislature.idaho.gov/wp- content/uploads/sessioninfo/2019/legislation/S1204E2.pdf Category:2018 Idaho elections Category:2018 ballot measures Category:Idaho ballot measures ",
