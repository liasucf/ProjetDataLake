    "text": "The 2018-19 season of the Hoofdklasse was played in four leagues, two Saturday leagues and two Sunday leagues. The champions of each group promoted directly to the 2019\u201320 Derde Divisie. The 2018\u201319 Hoofdklasse started on Saturday 1 September 2018. == Play-offs == === Promotion === In each competition teams play periods of 10 games, three times per season (30 games per season). After each period the best team which has not yet qualified earns a spot in the play-offs for the Derde Divisie as the period champion. If a period winner ends the season as champions, they will be replaced by the highest ranked team not yet qualified for the play-offs. In total 12 (substitute) period winners and 4 teams from the Derde Divisie compete for 3 spots in next seasons Derde Divisie. Due to the removal of Papendorp from the league, there have been only 2 periods of 14 games each in the Hoofdklasse B Sunday. The highest ranked team not yet qualified for the play-offs was assigned as third period winner. === Relegation === The teams in place 13 and 14 at the end of the season fight against relegation in the relegation play-offs. They face the period champions of the Eerste Klasse. == Saturday A == === Teams === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Club ! Home City ! Venue !

Therefore the two teams who lost in the fourth round of the play-offs were given a second chance. In an extra match, on neutral ground, these teams competed for the spot that became available. == Sources == * hollandsevelden.nl == References == 2018-19 4 Category:2018\u201319 in European fifth tier association football leagues ",
