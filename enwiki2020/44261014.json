Baldozas mosaicos was the proper term describing the Mediterranean cement tiles, more popular at present as Machuca tiles, named after Don Pepe, son of the premier producer of baldozas mosaicos in the Philippines, Don Jose Machuca y Romero. ==History== Don Jose Machuca y Romero was the primary producer of Mediterranean tiles in the Philippines during the early 1900s.
