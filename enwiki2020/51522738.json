When Robert was a baby, Sexton's family moved to New Brunswick, New Jersey, as New Jersey was the home of Robert's maternal grandmother. His mother, uncle, and maternal grandmother and grandfather were Holocaust survivors from Lithuania who had been forced into a concentration camp by the Nazis. Sexton obtained a degree from Middlesex College, in business and marketing. Sexton then attended the School of Visual Arts in New York City. He also obtained a film and television production certificate from LACC. ==Career== ===Music=== As a teenager, Sexton joined the band Gen\u00f6cide and played with them for seven years. The drummer for Gen\u00f6cide was Brain Damage (Brian Keats), and the band was fronted by vocalist Bobby Ebz (Bobby is also noted for spending the day with the notorious shock rocker GG Allin on the day GG died). Shortly before the band broke up, Pete \"Damien\" Marshall joined Gen\u00f6cide and played second guitar. During the years Sexton played with the band, they released the albums \"Reign of Terror\", \"Guttercat\", and \"Submit to Gen\u00f6cide\" (engineered by Al Theurer, who also worked with Wendy O. Williams, Joan Jett, and Carly Simon).Al Theurer - Engineer Discography Sexton then founded the band One Bad Eye, who he played with for three years.

Meeting director Brian Smith in an editing bay, he was offered a job as a production manager. Becoming a producer, he produced major music videos for country artists including Toby Keith, Reba McEntire, Brad Paisley, and Clint Black; rock artists including Marilyn Manson, OK Go, and John Fogerty; hip-hop artists like Busta Rhymes; and Christian artists including Skillet, KJ-52, and ZOEgirl. Sexton then moved largely into directing. One of his videos for Incite, which premiered on the Wall Street Journal, was the first ever narrative-driven heavy metal virtual reality video. In his career, he has directed many music videos for bands including Soulfly for \"Unleash\", The Devil Wears Prada for \"Sailor's Prayer\", and Cavalera Conspiracy for \"Killing Inside\". ===Virtual reality=== Sexton's entrance into the world of virtual reality was with his creation of \"cinematic virtual reality\", the technique of blending together traditional film techniques with virtual reality. His most notable work in this realm is his short \"Psycho City, TX\". \"Psycho City, TX\" was released on Sexton's app HollywoodAsylumVR and premiered at VRLA. Sexton described the medium as being good for horror for its realism. He told LA Weekly in May 2018, \"Your brain thinks it's a real event that's happening and remembers it as something real. It's not like watching a TV screen or a movie screen. You're in there, you know, it's a hot environment; your brain is thinking this is real.\" ==Personal life== Robert J.
