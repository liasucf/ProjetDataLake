Sold at Auction, with its white slavery plot line, is an example of a film that clearly violated the Thirteen Points and yet was still distributed. Since the NAMPI was ineffective, it was replaced in 1922. ==Preservation== With no copies of Sold at Auction listed in any film archive,Library of Congress American Silent Feature Film Survival Database: Sold at Auction it is a lost film ==References== ==Bibliography== * Langman, Larry.
