    "text": "Terence Pashley (born 11 October 1956) is an English former professional footballer. He played for Burnley, Blackpool and Bury in the 1970s and 1980s, making well over 400 Football League appearances for the three clubs. His position was as a defender, specifically a left full-back. He now works as a coach for Burnley, with the club confirming on 16 October 2012 that he has taken on the role of caretaker manager (following the departure of Eddie Howe to Bournemouth). ==Playing career== Pashley's career started when he was promoted from the youth team to the first-team squad by then Football League First Division side Burnley in 1972. He made his professional d\u00e9but on 18 September 1973, in an Anglo-Scottish Cup tie against East Fife at Turf Moor. He went on to play a total of 20 games for the Clarets over the following six seasons, making 18 league appearances in that time. His last game for Burnley came in the 1\u20132 defeat to Cardiff City on 19 November 1977. Pashley signed for Bob Stokoe's Blackpool in 1978. He made his debut for the club in the third league game of the 1978\u201379 season, a 2\u20131 defeat at Rotherham United on 26 August. He went on to make 34 further league appearances, as well as two in the FA Cup and three in the League Cup.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 332 He appeared in fifty of Blackpool's 52 league and cup games of 1979\u201380 (under Stan Ternent firstly, then Alan Ball), scoring three goals (all in the league). His first goal occurred in the opening league game of the season, a 2\u20131 victory over Gillingham at Bloomfield Road on 18 August. The other two came in a 5\u20134 home victory over Brentford on 13 October, and in a 2\u20131 defeat against the same opposition in the reverse fixture.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 334 In 1980\u201381, Pashley made thirty league appearances, again under two managers \u2013 this time Alan Ball and his successor, Allan Brown.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 336 Pashley was ever-present in Allan Brown's first full season in charge, 1981\u201382, appearing in each of the club's 53 league and cup games. He scored one league goal, in a 3\u20132 defeat at Aldershot on 17 October.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 338 Brown left the club at the end of the season, and was replaced by Sam Ellis. Pashley was ever-present for the second consecutive season. His 53 appearances in 1982\u201383 meant he had made 106 consecutive appearances for Blackpool. This was, however, a long way short of Georgie Mee's record of 195 consecutive league appearances for the club. Pashley spent a large portion of the season up front alongside Dave Bamber, and scored three league goals (two from the penalty spot). He also helped put Blackpool into the second round of the FA Cup by scoring in their first-round victory at Horwich R.M.I. He also scored two goals in the League Cup.Calley, Roy (1992). Blackpool: A Complete Record 1887\u20131992, Breedon Books Sport, p. 340 Pashley left Blackpool for Bury at the end of the season.
