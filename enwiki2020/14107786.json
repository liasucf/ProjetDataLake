    "text": "Herbert Emery Schonland (September 7, 1900 - November 13, 1984) was a United States Navy Rear Admiral and a recipient of the United States military's highest decoration\u2014the Medal of Honor\u2014for his actions in World War II. ==Biography== Admiral Chester Nimitz (center) visits Commander Herbert E. Schonland (left) and Lt. Commander Bruce McCandless on board the USS San Francisco at Pearl Harbor in December 1942. During the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal, Schonland assumed command after the ship's Captain was killed, and led damage control efforts. McCandless, the ship's Communications Officer, navigated the ship to safety. Both Schonland and McCandless received the Medal of Honor for their actions during and immediately after the battle. Schonland was born in Portland, Maine September 7, 1900 and graduated from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland in 1925. joined the Navy from his birth state of Maine. By November 12, 1942 he was serving as a lieutenant commander on the . On that day, the San Francisco was heavily damaged during the Naval Battle of Guadalcanal and began taking on water. Schonland, as the damage control officer, worked through the night to stop the flooding and save the ship. His actions during this encounter demonstrated his acumen. The ship had taken 85 hits in excess of five inches just above the water line and was leaking badly. At a key point during the effort to keep it from sinking, Schonland realized that the pumps for the second deck were inadequate to remove the water, but that the vessel had much higher capacity bilge pumps. So he called down to the engine room to arrange for all the bilge pumps to be pumping at full capacity, and the crew there ready for an immense amount of water. He then opened the hatches to the lower decks. This served the additional purpose of lowering the center of gravity of the ship, thus increasing its stability during the effort to save it. (John Carlton-Foss reporting a personal communication with Andrew Sims, Schonland's son in law) He reached the rank of rear admiral before leaving the Navy. He died November 13, 1984 at age 84 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery, Arlington County, Virginia. His grave can be found in section 7-A, grave 168, not far from the Tomb of the Unknowns. ==Honor and awards== Schonland's awards include: {| | |Medal of Honor |- | |Combat Action Ribbon |- | |Navy Presidential Unit Citation |- | |American Defense Service Medal |- | |American Campaign Medal |- | |Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with one silver and bronze campaign stars |- | |World War II Victory Medal |} ===Medal of Honor citation=== Schonland's official Medal of Honor citation reads: > For extreme heroism and courage above and beyond the call of duty as damage > control officer of the U.S.S.

It is unusual for buildings to be named for someone who is still alive and in this case the event occurred near the end of his lifetime, yet he was alert enough to understand and participate in the process. There was no previous person who had ever been awarded the Medal of Honor for damage control.
