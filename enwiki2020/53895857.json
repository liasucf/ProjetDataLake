This planet was detected in 2017 using gravitational microlensing techniques managed by the Korea Astronomy and Space Science Institute and the Spitzer Space Telescope. It has a mass similar to Earth and is located about the same distance from its host star as the Earth is from the Sun. However, the host star is so small that it may not be a star at all. It may be \"a brown dwarf or an ultracool dwarf\" instead, so the planet is likely far too cold to be habitable. Based on its currently observed properties, the 'iceball' planet may be described as a very cold Earth-like exoplanet. ==In popular culture== The planet has been referred to as Hoth due to its resemblance to the planet with the same name from the Star Wars franchise. A similar exoplanet, OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, has also been compared to Hoth, by NASA in this instance. ==See also== * Gliese 581c * Gliese 581g * OGLE-2005-BLG-169Lb * OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb * OGLE-2016-BLG-1190Lb * Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) * Planetary habitability ==References== Category:Exoplanets Category:Exoplanets detected by microlensing Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2017 Category:Terrestrial planets ",
