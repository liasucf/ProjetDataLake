Basum is spoken by 13.5% of the population of Gongbo'gyamda County. Glottolog lists Basum as unclassified within Bodish. Basum is spoken in Cuogao Township \u9519\u9ad8\u4e61 and Xueka Township \u96ea\u5361\u4e61 of Gongbo'gyamda County \u5de5\u5e03\u6c5f\u8fbe\u53bf, Nyingtri Prefecture, Tibet, China (Qu, et al. 1989). ==Classification== Basum Lake (Basum Tso) in Tibet Qu, et al. (1989) notes that Basum is mutually unintelligible with and quite different from Gongbu Tibetan (; 11,600 speakers), which is a Central Tibetan language variety closely related to Nyingchi Tibetan (). Basum is also unintelligible with Niangpu \u5a18\u84b2\u8bdd (also called Muqu \u7267\u533a\u8bdd), which is a Khams Tibetan language variety spoken by 4,310 people in Jiaxing \u52a0\u5174 and Niangpu \u5a18\u84b2 townships of Gongbo'gyamda County. Qu, et al. (1989:61) notices some lexical similarities between Basum and Cuona Menba (Tawang Monpa), an East Bodish language.

Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter. classifies Basum (Bake) as an unclassified Bodish language that does not belong to the Tibetic branch. Tournadre (2014: 112) notes that Basum has the negator a-, as opposed to the negator ma- or myi- in Tibetic languages. Also, unlike Tibetic languages, Basum does not palatalize Proto-Bodish *ti- and *si-. ==Lexicon== Qu, et al.
