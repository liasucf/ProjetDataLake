    "text": "Filipe Miguel Neves Ferreira (born 27 September 1990) is a Portuguese footballer who plays for C.D. Tondela mainly as a left back but also as a left midfielder. He made over 140 appearances in the Primeira Liga, mostly for Belenenses but also Nacional and Tondela. ==Club career== Born in Lisbon, Ferreira began his senior career at hometown club Atl\u00e9tico Clube de Portugal in the third division, winning promotion in 2010\u201311 and making his professional debut in the Segunda Liga the following season. A year later, he moved across the league and the capital city to C.F. Os Belenenses, playing 19 matches in all competitions as the team won the league title; he subsequently extended his contract from 2014 to the following year. Ferreira featured regularly in his debut campaign in the Primeira Liga, and scored the winner in a 2\u20131 home victory over S.C. Braga on 2 February 2014 that ended a nine-game winless run. In July 2016, once his contract expired, he signed a two-year deal at F.C. Pa\u00e7os de Ferreira in the same competition. In July 2018, Ferreira moved abroad for the first time, signing for SK Sturm Graz of the Austrian Football Bundesliga. Having made only four appearances in all tournaments, he returned the following January to his own country's top flight by joining C.D. Nacional on loan until 30 June; his registration at the Madeiran club was delayed for bureaucratic reasons. Following Nacional's relegation, in July 2019 Ferreira made a permanent move back to the top tier on a two-year contract at C.D. Tondela. ==International career== Ferreira played twice for the Portuguese under-21 side, in March 2011 friendlies. He earned his first cap against the Republic of Ireland (2\u20130 win), and his second three days later against Denmark (1\u20131). ==Personal life== Ferreira's father, Jos\u00e9 Carlos, was also a footballer and a defender. ==References== ==External links== * *National team data * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Lisbon Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Clube de Portugal players Category:C.F.
