Marlatt died on March 11 , 2011 of kidney failure in Warm Beach, Washington. == Urge Surfing == Urge surfing is a technique attributed to the late psychologist Alan Marlatt, Ph.D., a pioneer in the field of addictions treatment. We can think of an urge as an impulse to engage in an old habit, such as drinking or using, and they are often experienced as physical sensations in the body. Urges are like waves in that they rise in intensity, peak, and eventually crash. ==See also== * Relapse Prevention ==References== * Alan Marlatt at the University of Washington Psychology Department * Addictive Behaviors Research Center at the University of Washington ==External links== * An Interview with Alan Marlatt (Psychotherapy.net) Marlatt Category:Researchers in alcohol abuse Category:University of Washington faculty Category:1941 births Category:2011 deaths Category:Writers on addiction ",
