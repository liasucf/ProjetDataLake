    "text": "Animalize is the twelfth studio album by American rock band Kiss. It was released in 1984 on Mercury Records. The album marked the only appearance by lead guitarist Mark St. John, who replaced Vinnie Vincent in April 1984. ==Background== At the time of the record's release, Gene Simmons was pursuing a career in acting. Paul Stanley was thus primarily in charge of the album's production and direction.Kiss \u2013 Animalize CD Album New guitarist Mark St. John stated that when recording the record, he had utilized his Rockman gear, and that heavy equalization was used to take the \"Boston\" sound out of the recording. St. John was forced to leave Kiss during the subsequent tour after being diagnosed with reactive arthritis. By November 1984, he was out of the band, the third lead guitarist to exit the group in two years. When asked what 'Animalize' meant, Stanley said that people were starting to become more like computers and that \"making music by pressing buttons\" was no fun. ==Critical reception== In a continuation of Kiss' commercial resurgence which had begun with Lick It Up, Animalize was certified platinum by the RIAA. It was the biggest-selling Kiss album since 1979's Dynasty. Critics and longtime fans, however, criticized the band's continued move towards a glam metal style on Animalize. Simmons fell into increasing conflict with his bandmates during this period for a variety of reasons, most of which revolved around his perceived lack of commitment to the band and preoccupation with numerous outside projects, including producing and managing other rock groups such as Black 'n Blue (whom Tommy Thayer was a member of at the time), bit parts in films like Trick or Treat (as a radio DJ), a co-starring role in Runaway, and an assortment of business ventures. \"Heaven's on Fire\" became the biggest hit from the album (as well as one of the only songs to survive on the band's live setlist after the '80s), and its music video received heavy MTV rotation. It is also the only music video appearance of Mark St. John.
