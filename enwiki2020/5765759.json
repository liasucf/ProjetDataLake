Kolendas was born in 1820. A handful of portraits by his hand, held in the museum of Pereslavl-Zalessky, survive, including portraits of the 1840s children of local workers. His works fall into the category of Russian art known as \u201cparsuna\u201d, which bridged the worlds of religious and personal portraiture, as Russian painters began adopting the portrait painting styles of Western European salons. His style has been compared, albeit less favorably, to similar works by Grigory Ostrovsky and Nikolay Mylnikov. ==References== * Category:19th-century Russian painters Category:Russian male painters Category:1820 births Category:People from Pereslavl-Zalessky Category:Year of death missing Category:Russian portrait painters ",
