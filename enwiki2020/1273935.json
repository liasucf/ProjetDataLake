Late into the 1990\u201391 season, aged only 30, he was promoted to hometown Real Zaragoza's first team, eventually leading it to the 17th league position and avoiding La Liga relegation in the playoffs against Real Murcia; at the time of his beginnings, he was the second youngest manager to ever coach in the category after Xabier Azkargorta. In the following years, Fern\u00e1ndez helped Zaragoza consolidate in the top division, notably reconverting Gustavo Poyet from forward to attacking midfielder and winning the Copa del Rey in 1994 and the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in the next season. He was relieved of his duties on 8 November 1996, meeting the same fate the following year with his next club, CD Tenerife. For four complete seasons in the late 90s/early 2000s, Fern\u00e1ndez was in charge of RC Celta de Vigo, helping the Galicians qualify three times for the UEFA Cup during his spell while playing highly attractive football. From 2002 to 2004 he worked with fellow top flight team Real Betis, respectively finishing eighth and ninth in his two years. In August 2004, Fern\u00e1ndez moved abroad and joined Portuguese club FC Porto. He started his tenure with the conquest of the Intercontinental Cup, but was abruptly dismissed in January of the following year following a 1\u20133 home loss against S.C. Braga. Fern\u00e1ndez returned to his beloved Zaragoza for the 2006\u201307 campaign, qualifying the side for the UEFA Cup in his first year but being sacked midway through his second, as the season eventually ended in relegation. In another return he joined Betis in late January 2010, replacing fired Antonio Tapia; during his spell the Verdiblancos were the team in the league with the most points, but they could not eventually promote from Segunda Divisi\u00f3n after finishing with the same points as the third-placed club. On 9 January 2013, Fern\u00e1ndez moved for his second experience abroad, signing a contract with Belgium's K.A.A. Gent. He was sacked on 30 September 2013, due to poor results. Fern\u00e1ndez was appointed as the new manager of Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a on 10 July 2014, succeeding Fernando V\u00e1zquez. He was relieved of his duties on 9 April of the following year, with the team eventually narrowly escaping relegation. In the summer of 2015, Fern\u00e1ndez signed for Real Madrid as youth system coordinator. He left the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium in 2017, and on 17 December 2018 he returned to Zaragoza for a third stint as manager replacing the dismissed Lucas Alcaraz. Fern\u00e1ndez resigned on 18 August 2020, after losing the play-off semi-finals to Elche CF. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Managerial record by team and tenure |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|Nat !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"8\"|Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! |- | align=\"left\" |Zaragoza B | | align=left|1 July 1990 | align=left|4 March 1991 | |- | align=\"left\" |Zaragoza | | align=left|4 March 1991 | align=left|8 November 1996 | |- | align=\"left\" |Tenerife | | align=left|1 July 1997 | align=left|10 November 1997 | |- | align=\"left\" |Celta | | align=left|30 May 1998 | align=left|18 May 2002 | |- | align=\"left\" |Betis | | align=left|18 May 2002 | align=left|30 June 2004 | |- | align=\"left\" |Porto | | align=left|11 August 2004 | align=left|31 January 2005 | |- | align=\"left\" |Zaragoza | | align=left|6 June 2006 | align=left|14 January 2008 | |- | align=\"left\" | Betis | | align=left|26 January 2010 | align=left|12 July 2010 | |- | align=\"left\" |Gent | | align=left|9 January 2013 | align=left|30 September 2013 | |- | align=\"left\" |Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a | | align=left|10 July 2014 | align=left|9 April 2015 | |- | align=\"left\" |Zaragoza | | align=left| 17 December 2018 | align=left| 18 August 2020 | |- !colspan=\"4\"|Total !\u2014 |} ==Honours== Zaragoza *Copa del Rey: 1993\u201394 *UEFA Cup Winners' Cup: 1994\u201395 Celta *UEFA Intertoto Cup: 2000 Porto *Superta\u00e7a C\u00e2ndido de Oliveira: 2004 *Intercontinental Cup: 2004 *UEFA Super Cup runner- up: 2004 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1960 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Zaragoza Category:Spanish footballers Category:Aragonese footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Spanish football managers Category:La Liga managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n managers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B managers Category:Real Zaragoza managers Category:CD Tenerife managers Category:RC Celta de Vigo managers Category:Real Betis managers Category:Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a managers Category:Primeira Liga managers Category:FC Porto managers Category:K.A.A.
