In 1878, the French company Compagnia Generale Francese dei Tramways (CGFT, French General Company of Tramways) began to build a horse tram system. The city subsequently granted further concessions to two other companies, the Swiss backed Societ\u00e0 di Ferrovie Elettriche e Funicolari (FEF, Society of Electric Railways & Funiculars) and the Belgian/Italian Societ\u00e0 Tramways Orientali (TO, Oriental Tramway Society). However, by 1894, the FEF had achieved no more than a single short electric tram line between Piazza Manin and Piazza Corvetto, whilst the TO had not progressed beyond the planning stage. The CGFT system had extended through the city and the Val Polcevera, but was still horse operated. In 1894, the German company Allgemeine Elektrizit\u00e4ts Gesellschaft (AEG, Common Electricity Company) bought both the FEF and TO companies. The following year AEG created the company Officine Electrical Genovesi (OEG, Genovese Electrical Office), which took over the city's existing electricity supply company, and the Societ\u00e0 Unione Italiana Tramways Elettrici (UITE, Italian Electric Tramways Union), which purchased the CGFT's concession. By the end of 1895, AEG has a monopoly of both electricity supply and public transport provision in the city. Under their new ownership, the FEF and the TO developed a tram network of more than reaching Nervi and Prato, whilst UITE electrified their lines to Voltri and Pontedecimo. Finally in December 1901, AEG merged the FEF and TO into an enlarged UITE. AEG continued to own and manage the UITE until the outbreak of World War I, in which Germany and Italy fought on different sides. In 1916, new shares were issued and subscribed for entirely by Italian entrepreneurs. In 1927, the city of Genoa acquired a majority share-holding in UITE. In 1965, the city acquired the remaining holding and the UITE's activities were transferred to the Azienda Municipalizzata Trasporti (AMT). == Services == The AMT manages the following services: * 1 metro line (the Genoa Metro) * 3 funiculars (the Zecca\u2013Righi funicular, the Sant'Anna funicular and the Quezzi funicular) * 1 rack railway (the Principe\u2013Granarolo rack railway) * 1 narrow gauge railway (the Genova\u2013Casella railway) * 10 public lifts * 142 urban bus lines * 1 trolleybus line * 1 water bus line == See also == * Trolleybuses in Genoa * Genoa Metro == References == == External links == * * Official AMT web site (in Italian) Category:Companies based in Genoa Category:RATP Group Category:Transport companies of Italy Category:Transport in Genoa ",
