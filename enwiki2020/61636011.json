    "text": "Lawrence (II) from the kindred Aba (; died after 1290) was a Hungarian nobleman in the 13th century, who served as Master of the treasury three times in the court of Ladislaus IV of Hungary. He was the forefather of the Atyinai noble family, which flourished until the mid-15th century. ==Family== Lawrence II was born into the Atyina\u2013Gagy (or also Ny\u00e9k) branch of the powerful and extended gens (clan) Aba. In genealogy, the branch was named after Atyina (present-day Vo\u0107in, Croatia), the acquisition and eponymous estate of Lawrence's sons. He was the only known son of his namesake father, who was a faithful partisan of B\u00e9la IV of Hungary.Engel: Geneal\u00f3gia (Genus Aba 3. Atyina-Gagy branch 1. Atyinai) For his loyalty and military service, Lawrence I was granted large-scale landholdings in Sopron County. ==Career== He was also called as Lawrence of Ny\u00e9k or Lawrence of Sopron by contemporary documents after his residence. He first appears in sources in 1279, when donated the estate of Limpach to the Cistercian Klostermarienberg Abbey (Borsmonostor, today part of Mannersdorf an der Rabnitz, Austria) for his late father's spiritual salvation, who was buried in the monastery. Lawrence II was considered a faithful confidant of Ladislaus IV and his mother, Dowager Queen Elizabeth the Cuman. According to a list of merits, issued by her in 1290, Lawrence usually \"selflessly made his property available to the king\" and negotiated in abroad at his own expense as an envoy of Ladislaus on several occasions. He was made Master of the treasury in December 1279, when Ladislaus IV imprisoned papal legate Philip of Fermo and reorganized the royal council in order to fill the dignities with his loyal partisans. However, thereafter Ladislaus himself was also captured by some lords. In less than two months, both the legate and the king were set free. It is plausible that Lawrence held his dignity until the spring of 1280, when Ugrin Cs\u00e1k retook the position in accordance with the agreement and reconciliation between the king and the most powerful barons. When Ladislaus IV regained some space for maneuver, Lawrence again served as Master of the treasury from around July 1280 to April 1281, but he was ultimately replaced by his distant relative, Peter Aba from the more influential Sz\u00e9plak branch. Aerialphotography of Burgruine Landsee (L\u00e1nzs\u00e9r), today in Austria Since the early 1280s, the powerful K\u0151szegi family gradually extended their influence over Sopron County, including the Locsm\u00e1nd region, where the majority of Lawrence's lands had laid. According to historian Gyula Krist\u00f3, Ivan K\u0151szegi brought whole Sopron County under his jurisdiction and annexed it to his emerging oligarchic province by 1285, when several local nobles were mentioned as his familiares. When Nicholas K\u0151szegi donated a land to the Klostermarienberg Abbey in 1285, Lawrence Aba, among others, appeared as a witness and was referred to as \"cari nostri\" (\"our dear\"), reflecting his political allegiance, as he was forced to enter the K\u0151szegis' service by then. The K\u0151szegis retook their positions over the royal council in 1284. During the course, Lawrence functioned as Master of the treasury for the third time, presumably between 1284 and 1285, until the K\u0151szegis' most recent rebellion against Ladislaus IV. Beside that, he also served as isp\u00e1n of S\u00e1ros County in 1285. Ivan K\u0151szegi's continuous looting raids in Austria and Styria resulted a large-scale war (\"G\u00fcssing Feud\"; ) throughout in 1289, when Albert I, Duke of Austria launched a massive royal campaign with his 15,000-size army against the K\u0151szegis and their familiares. The Austrians captured at least 30 fortresses and settlements along the western borders, including Aba Lawrence's three castles, L\u00e1nzs\u00e9r, Ny\u00e9k and Locsm\u00e1nd (present-day Landsee, Neckenmarkt and Lutzmannsburg in Austria, respectively), because Lawrence and his banderium refused to join the Austrian army to defeat the K\u0151szegi family. Duke Albert's mercenaries completely burnt and devastated the fort of Ny\u00e9k, Lawrence's residence, while its inhabitants were imprisoned and sent to Austria in the spring of 1289. Ny\u00e9k Castle was never re-built. For his loyalty, Queen Elizabeth, with the consent of her son, Ladislaus IV, donated the abbey of Szentm\u00e1rton in Virovitica County to him in 1290. Ladislaus IV was assassinated some months later. Lawrence Aba swore loyalty to Andrew III of Hungary, and was granted lands in Kri\u017eevci County from the new Hungarian monarch. These acquisitions in Slavonia became the basis of his descendants' direction of expansion, in addition that his family successfully recovered L\u00e1nzs\u00e9r after Andrew's royal campaign against Austria. Lawrence Aba died sometime after 1290. From his marriage to an unidentified noble lady, Lawrence II had four sons, Nicholas I, John I, James and Peter I. During the Interregnum, they supported the claim of Charles I of Hungary. Nicholas I married one of the daughters of the once powerful baron Egyed Monoszl\u00f3. Through this wedding, the brothers acquired the lordships of Darn\u00f3c (today Slatinski Drenovac in Croatia) and Atyina, and \u2013 following violent struggles with the K\u0151szegis \u2013 became ancestors of the Atyinai family (1317), which flourished until the 1430s. == References == == Sources == * * * * Category:13th-century Hungarian people Lawrence 02 Category:Masters of the treasury (Kingdom of Hungary) ",
