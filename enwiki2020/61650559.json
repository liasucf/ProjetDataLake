    "text": "SaveGAZ or Save GAZ is a Russian anti-sanction movement and flashmob organized by GAZ Group workers councils that appeared in April 2019 as protest against constant postponing of lifting sanctions. == Pre-history == International sanctions were presented in 2014 during the Ukrainian crisis which seriously deterred economic cooperation between USA and Russia and banned several personalities from entering the European Union and USA; one of them was Oleg Deripaska, the owner of GAZ Group. Despite US State Department spokespersons' statements that sanctions \"were not aimed at the Russian people\", workers of GAZ Group disproved it, stating that sanctions negatively affected the life of ordinary people and hindered the daily life. In 2018 GAZ workers composed and sent a letter to the US Embassy Moscow to ask for a meeting with the US Ambassador in Russia Jon Huntsman Jr. and arranging the discussion of possible sanctions lifting. According to several workers, the reason of imposing sanction was the attempt of US government to gain the control over the Russian market and give it to Ford Motor Company as the main rival of GAZ at the Russian market of commercial vehicles. However, the workers were refused to meet with US ambassador and were recommended to talk to Russian government representatives instead.Conspiracies swirl as US sanctions hit Deripaska\u2019s car factory == Protests == In March 2019, GAZ Group asked the Government of Russia to provide sum of $468 million for the support. According to Oleg Deripaska's statements of April 2019, because of sanctions the risk of facing bankruptcy for GAZ Group has grown significantly, and the collapse would involve up 400,000 workers losing their jobs, including all the companies which are supplied by GAZ. US sanctions placed on Deripaska could cut production but almost 40% in the second half of that year. In order to make US lift sanctions from other Deripaska's enterprises as Rusal, En+ and Evrosibenergo, Deripaska decreased his share in those companies and let foreign citizens, including EU countries and USA citizens, enter the Board of Directors. The same actions were offered by Deripaska in order to remove GAZ Group from the sanctions field (by decreasing Deripaska's share in GAZ Group to 50%),\u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u0421\u0428\u0410 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0431\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u043c\u044b\u0448\u043b\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 \u043e\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u044d\u0444\u0444\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043d\u044b\u043c\u0438 however, Deripaska stated that United States Department of the Treasury will not accept even those conditions in exchange for lifting the sanctions against GAZ Group.\u00ab\u042d\u0442\u043e \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u044f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u043f\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0448\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0430\u043b\u043b\u00bb: \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0435 \u044f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u0413\u0410\u0417\u0430 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438 \u0440\u044d\u043f \u043f\u0440\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0438 Deripaska's post was published in Instagram with hashtag #SaveGAZ and contained the next text: In June 2019, the workers council members (about 30 employees) held a picket in front of the US Embassy in Moscow, demanding lifting sanctions of them.
