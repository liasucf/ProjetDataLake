    "text": "' is a trans-Neptunian object and damocloid on a cometary-like orbit from the outer Solar System, approximately in diameter. It was first observed on 22 June 2017 by the Pan-STARRS survey at Haleakala Observatory in Hawaii, United States. The unusual object has the largest heliocentric aphelion of any known minor planet, even larger than that of ; it is calculated to reach several thousand AU (Earth-Sun) distances at the farthest extent of its orbit. == Orbit and classification == orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.5\u20136,082 AU once every 167,878 years (semi-major axis of 3043 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.9985 and an inclination of 56\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. As it has an eccentricity higher than 0.50, the distant object is labelled an (other) unusual object by the Minor Planet Center. The Johnston's Archive groups it to the damocloids, due to its extreme orbital elements and a TJupiter of less than 2, while in JPL's Small Body Database, it is a trans- Neptunian object with a semi-major axis larger than that of Neptune. {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: right; font-size: 11px; float: left; margin-right: 1.2em;\" |- bgcolor=#333 style=\"color: white; font-size: smaller;\" | colspan=4 style=\"text-align: center;\" |Orbital evolution \u2014 Barycentric elements |- !

While its orbit extends to the inner Oort cloud, it may not be a member of it, as it approaches very near to Saturn, implying Saturn has either captured a past Oort Cloud object onto this orbit, or it was a centaur ejected by Saturn from a much smaller orbit. However, it would be impossible to project its orbit far enough into the past to determine which scenario is true. Like most objects on an extremely distant orbit around the Sun, 's barycentric orbit is very different from its heliocentric orbit, the latter being based only on the current position of the Solar System barycenter, and the former is based on the long-term movement of the barycenter. While the heliocentric aphelion is 7,000\u20139,000 AU, depending on the calculation, the current barycentric aphelion (as of 2018) is only 1,700 AU. Before its perihelion in 2016 AD (after that of ~30500 BC), it reached 2,000 AU from the sun around ~14300 BC. == Physical characteristics == Very little is known for certain about the body's physical characteristics. The Johnston's Archive assumes a generic distant-object albedo of 0.09 and calculates a diameter of 8 kilometers. Like other distant objects, it is probably also fairly red in appearance due to tholins on its surface. == See also == * List of Solar System objects by greatest aphelion == References == == External links == * * Category:Damocloids Category:Trans- Neptunian objects # Category:Minor planet object articles (unnumbered) # 20170622 ",
