The head-to-head match between them had ended in a 1-8 1-8 draw and competition rules meant that they were level in the group. Both teams withdrew in protest at the proposed coin toss and eventually the Camogie Association decided that a play-off match would take place instead. ===Knock-Out Stages=== ====Quarter-Finals==== \\---- ====Semi-Finals==== \\---- ====All-Ireland Final==== ==References== ==External links== * Camogie Association 2015 2015 All-Ireland Senior Camogie Championship ",
