When Xuxa grew up, she had to go her way without the help of a faithful protector. Xuxinha was given the job of protecting another small man, Guto. Perhaps the most damned of all, the angel always had to do the impossible to save him from the confusions and dangers in which he entered. Xuxinha also counts on the aid of Biel, angel of the guard of Jonas, the great companion of adventures of Guto. One day, the country is invaded by Xyz\u00edgenas, garbage-eating monsters from the planet XYZ, located in a distant galaxy. Knowing that Earth's inhabitants used to throw debris into the streams, polluting all the rivers of the planet, they decided that it was the best place for domination there. The first resident to believe in the invasion was the wise Euclid Archimedes. All but the detective dog Txutxuc\u00e3o, Guto and Jonas discredited him. Together, they resolve to fight these stinking monsters, who have dominated the entire punch stream.

The project had the first title \"Aventuras da Xuxinha\", and would have as heroine a blonde girl, true miniature of the hots. But the project was budgeted by Ancine (Ag\u00eancia Nacional do Cinema), with a forecast of an expense of R$7.5 million reais, which Xuxa and its production considered very high, so the project was postponed to the year 2005, and in its place the TV hots debuted Xuxa e o Tesouro da Cidade Perdida at the end of that year (2004). Almost a year after the first announcement, on June 24, 2005 Xuxa announced the release of his first animated film titled Xuxinha e Guto Contra os Monstros do Espa\u00e7o, which premiered in cinemas all over Brazil in December of that year. Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espa\u00e7o the film is the first Brazilian animation in second and third dimension. Xuxinha e Guto contra os Monstros do Espa\u00e7o had a team of 70 animators from Twister studio, it was generated in computer, totally digital technology. The film is equated with Disney animations, but it did not cost 1% of the budget for such productions. The final value reached R$6 million reais, which was hosted by TV Hots itself, which boasts of the animation hub created for this production. As in the four previous films of Xuxa, the direction is of Moacyr G\u00f3es, the animation director Clewerson Saremba and the production, of Diler & Associates. It took a year to get ready. It is therefore a mixture of cartoon and live action scenes (with actors acting). Betting on a new formula, TV hots Xuxa Meneghel abandons its traditional film format and this year reaches theaters in an animation. Director Clewerson Saremba explains that the film was drawn and animated completely on the computer. \"The process of animation was based on that of conventional studios.The difference was to change the role for the computer when drawing\". It was not by accident that Xuxa and the producer of his films Diler Trindade decided to bet on the animation this year. Clearly, there is an attempt of renewal since, every year, its productions have been earning less at the box office. Xuxa explained that he agrees with the participation of animation characters to reduce production costs: With a script signed by Fl\u00e1vio de Sousa, the film is faithful to what the presenter believes. \"We do not care about being educational. That's up to the school, not the TV Shows and Films,\" he says. Still, the theme of the film is ecology and the importance of recycling. Despite the small participation in front of the cameras, Xuxa says that he throbbed a lot in the production of the drawing. \"I'm a little annoying. Sometimes she thought that Xuxinha looked fat or sneaky, she had to change. Ten seconds of film took a week to be redone. A lot of things have been thrown in the trash, hours of work.\" The character Xuxinha has been present in the DVDs and TV Shows of Xuxa since 1997, In the same year, the character Guto was created to represent the male children's audience of the new line of baby cleaning products. Xuxa and Pedro Malta are the only real appearances in the film, the other characters are made in computer graphics and dubbed by voice actors. ===Music=== The soundtrack of the film of the same name, released in 2005 by Som Livre.
