As of 2015, the Port of Novi Sad was the only port in Serbia that was state- owned, with other 11 ports being privatized. Since then, there were several unsuccessful attempts to privatize it. In 2016 calendar year, the Port of Novi Sad made a historic high load turnover of 1.18 million tonnes, the most of any port in Serbia. In March 2019, the Government of Serbia accepted the auction offer of \"P&O; Ports\" to operate the port for 7.99 million euros. On 11 May, the agreement was finalized and \"P&O; Ports\" thus was granted 25-year concession over the port. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 establishments in Serbia Category:2019 mergers and acquisitions Category:Companies based in Novi Sad Category:Ports and harbours of Serbia Category:Transport companies of Serbia Category:Transport in Novi Sad ",
