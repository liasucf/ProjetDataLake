(Hal J. Mowat provided illustrations.) The story follows a shop girl named Eva Mayers as she fights against poverty, captured in her struggle to simply buy a new pair of shoes. The story takes inspiration from Jane Addams's nonfiction book on prostitution A New Conscience and an Ancient Evil, which Herron quotes for her epigraph: > \u201cWhen the shoes became too worn to endure a third soling and she possessed > but 90 cents toward a new pair, she gave up the struggle; to use her own > contemptuous phrase, she \u2018sold out for a new pair of shoes.\u2019\u201d Weber adapted the story herself, and she did so closely, with \"dialogue from the story occasionally appearing verbatim in the film\u2019s intertitles.\" Released on June 26, 1916, the film received widespread critical and public acclaim, becoming Universal's most-booked Bluebird production that year. ==Cast== * Mary MacLaren - Eva Meyer * Harry Griffith - Her Father * Mattie Witting - Her Mother (*as Mrs. A.E.
