They lost the series against the All Blacks by three matches to one. The team played as the British Isles in their internationals against the All Blacks and the British Lions for the non-international games. Unlike all previous tours to New Zealand, the Lions did not play any matches in Australia, though one game was also played at Buckhurst Park, Suva, against Fiji. The Lions tourists left London on 10 May 1977 and returned on 19 August. Of their 26 matches on tour, they won 21 and lost 5. Although the Lions lost the test series against the All Blacks they were level 1\u20131 after the second international and came close to drawing the series; they led 9\u20136 going into injury time in the fourth test only to concede a match-winning try scored by Lawrie Knight. Outside the test series, the Lions beat all their New Zealand provincial opponents as well as the NZ Maori and NZ Juniors representative teams, losing only to the New Zealand Universities team four days before the first international \u2013 this was the first defeat for a Lions team since the 1971 tourists lost the second test to the All Blacks on the same Christchurch ground and ended an unbeaten run of thirty-nine matches for the Lions. It was during the Junior All Blacks game that the famous 'Mudman' image of Fran Cotton, waiting for the ball at a line- out while caked head-to-toe in mud, was taken. Captured by Colorsport's Colin Elsey, it became one of the iconic images of rugby union, and in 2009 was named the 5th greatest sporting photo of all time.Daily Mail's List of 50 Greatest Sporting Photos On their way home, in August 1977, the Lions stopped off to play the Fiji for the first time and suffered their fifth defeat of the tour, Fiji winning 25\u201321. A team selected from the Lions touring party played one further match, against the Barbarians at Twickenham on 10 September 1977, to mark the Silver Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. The Lions won by 23-14 in front of a capacity crowd, having led 15\u20130 at half-time.(Rothmans, Jenkins ed.pp140-141) ==Squad== The touring party as originally announced contained 17 players from Wales (including the as-yet uncapped Elgan Rees and Brynmor Williams), 5 from England, 5 from Scotland and 3 from Ireland. Geoff Wheel had to withdraw on medical advice before the touring party left and was replaced by Moss Keane. Roger Uttley aggravated a back injury at the get-together prior to leaving and was subsequently replaced by Jeff Squire. Bill Beaumont, Charlie Faulkner and Alun Lewis joined the tour party later in New Zealand as replacements \u2013 Lewis never played international rugby for Wales. Several senior players made themselves unavailable to tour.https://www.espn.co.uk/rugby/story/_/id/19435824/injuries-intolerable- hope-1977-british-irish-lions-tour-new-zealand-series-defeat-all-blacks ===Management=== * Manager George Burrell (Scotland) * Coach John Dawes (Wales) ===Backs=== * Phil Bennett (Llanelli and Wales) Captain * John D Bevan (Aberavon and Wales) * David Burcher (Newport and Wales) * Gareth Evans (Newport and Wales) * Steve Fenwick (Bridgend and Wales) * Mike Gibson (North of Ireland FC and Ireland) * Bruce Hay (Boroughmuir and Scotland) * Andy Irvine (Heriot's FP and Scotland) * Alun Lewis (Cambridge University and London Welsh) * Ian McGeechan (Headingley and Scotland) * Dougie Morgan (Stewart's Melville FP and Scotland) * Elgan Rees (Neath) * Peter Squires (Harrogate and England) * Brynmor Williams (Cardiff) * J.J.
