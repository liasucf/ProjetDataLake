On the first drive Webb was able to move the ball by completing several short passes. The drive stalled after a sack by Isaiah Johnson. The Jackets marched down the field and Nesbitt scored on a ten-yard run. The Jayhawks took advantage of a kickoff out of bounds scoring after a couple of runs and a handful of passes.

A passer interference penalty moved GT to the brink of field goal range. But a false start penalty on a fourth down with three yards to go left the jackets in a passing situation and just out of comfortable field goal range. The subsequent slant route was on target yet Stephen Hill was unable to hold on to make the completion. Georgia Tech rushed for 356 yards and racked up 407 yards of offense, but the defense could not stop Kansas' newly arraigned QB and the Jayhawk offense. Josh Nesbitt and Stephen Hill connected on a 52-yard touchdown midway through the fourth quarter, followed by a two-point conversion which put the game at 28\u201325.

Completing several passes and countering with quick runs. With senior running back Johnny White finding holes and running hard. A defense that didn't show much resistance during the drive stiffened inside of 10 yards to hold UNC to a field goal. After the ensuing kick off it only took two plays with a modest game before Orwin Smith was able to take a pitch the length of the field for the touchdown. Leaving the Jackets ahead 3\u20137. UNC next scored on a long pass to Eric Highsmith who was left open on a blown coverage by a young safety. Roddy Jones was then able to score a receiving touchdown pass, making it 10\u201314. Yates was finding ways to get the ball to receivers and the receivers were finding ways to make catches. Taking the ball 80 yards on the next drive and sneaking it in from the 1-yard line. The Jackets countered with a field goal to end the half, leaving it even at 17. The first miscue came from Georgia Tech when they fumbled a pitch when Roddy Jones slipped while in motion and lost pitch relationship. Giving the Tar Heels good field position they took a 24\u201317 lead on a run by White. Another fumble on their next drive caused Georgia Tech to punt. Then a fumble by Yates after running into his fullback returned the ball to the Jackets. A big third down pass with eleven yards to go saw Nesbitt find Jones after scrambling.

Josh Nesbitt found a wide open Tyler Melton early in the final quarter to cut the N.C. State lead to ten at 31\u201321. Tarrant's interception came on N.C. State's ensuing drive. Tech earned itself a swivel of momentum as it strove to garner victory at Bobby Dodd Stadium. However, N.C. State and superstar quarterback Russell Wilson responded by scoring two touchdowns against Tech's vulnerable secondary to seal victory for the wolfpack in Atlanta. ===Wake Forest=== Pregame Line: Wake Forest +9.5 Trailing 17\u20136 in the fourth quarter, Georgia Tech bested Wake Forest on the strength a comeback led by Quarterback Joshua Nesbitt, A-back Embry Peeples, and WR Correy Earls to shock the Demon Deacons in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Following a Scott Blair 43-yard field goal, Georgia Tech found itself at 4th and 5 on Wake Forest's thirty-yard line, where Josh Nesbitt found Embry Peeples for a Touchdown pass. Tech needed to convert a two-point conversion to tie the game. Paul Johnson and the Yellow Jackets did just that, executing the same play it ran against the University of Georgia in Athens on November 29, 2008 \u2013 when it tied that ballgame at 28. The Tech defense allowed Wake Forest to earn a field goal on the next drive. However, on Tech's ensuing drive, veteran Quarterback Josh Nesbitt took the team on his shoulders, leading the Tech offense down the field. Nesbitt converted a 4th and 5 in the process with a twenty-yard scramble for a first down. To cap off the thrilling comeback, Nesbitt found senior wideout Correy Earls on a slant route with 15 seconds left in the endzone. Tech took the lead 24-20. The win preserved Coach Johnson's streak of zero consecutive losses, and increased his record to 23\u20139 at Georgia Tech. ===Virginia=== Pregame Line: Virginia +10 As the Yellow Jackets and Cavaliers met in Atlanta it pitted Al Groh against his former team for the first time. Groh was head coach at Virginia since 2000 before taking over as defensive coordinator at Tech. Although Virginia was able to move the ball for 376 yards they had no luck slowing down the Jackets who racked up 536 yards. Tech opened the scoring with a field goal. Then Virginia was able to reach the end zone. The rest of the day was all Jackets as they added a field goal and a touchdown before the half. Anthony Allen led the Jackets in rushing with 195 yards on 25 carries. He was followed by Nesbitt who had 109 yards on 21 carries.

With Nesbitt and Allen leading the way. ===Clemson=== Pregame Line: Clemson \u20133.5 Georgia Tech and Clemson were both looking for big conference wins to stay in the hunt for a spot in the ACC Championship Game. Andre Ellington was the story for the Tiger's offense as he was able to find the endzone 3 times. Georgia Tech was never really able to get the wheels rolling on offense as they were held under 250 yards rushing. This from the nation's leading rushing team averaging over 300 yards per game. They were also able to hold Nesbitt to just 2 total yards rushing. This includes yardage loss on sacks. Nesbitt has rushed for over a 100 yards in 4 of 7 games this year. ===Virginia Tech=== Pregame line: Virginia Tech \u2013 13.5 The Jackets traveled to Lane Stadium to play a nationally televised Thursday night game. Since the league was split into two divisions either the Jackets or the Hokies have represented the Coastal Division in the ACC Championship Game. For the previous three years the winner of this match- up had gone on to win the ACC. Georgia Tech took the opening kick-off and marched down the field. Starting with a 27-yard pitch to Orwin Smith, the drive, also featured Anthony Allen who also racked up 27 yards but on 5 carries. Nesbitt carried twice on the drive, once for 3 yards and a 1-yard carry into the endzone. After the Hokies first drive stalled the Jackets got the ball back on their 20-yard line. On the third play of the Jacket's drive Nesbitt rumbled for 71 yards to find the endzone before any Hokies were able to chase him down. In their next possession Virginia Tech was able to drive the field and keep the score close. Tyrod Taylor was able to complete passes and scramble when needed to keep the drive alive but the drive was really led by the running of Ryan Williams. Williams touched the ball 6 times on the drive for 34 yards on the 10 play 73-yard drive. The Jackets were forced to punt on their next drive. On a third and goal play from the 8 Georgia Tech's Rod Sweeting was able to come up with a huge interception in the endzone. The favor was returned and then some on the next drive.

On a third and goal from the 6 Nesbitt's pass was intercepted and the QB broke his right arm while trying to bring down the return man. Although Nesbitt would miss the rest of the game and the season with the injury it was not before he took over the all-time lead for rushing for the QB position in the ACC. The whole third quarter saw the Jackets and the Hokies trade possessions many times with no one adding to the scoreboard. The Jackets reserve QB Tevin Washington played well but the Jackets sorely missed their Senior leader. The Hokies were next to score. A passer interference call on the Jackets moved the Hokies close enough for David Wilson to find the end zone, tying the score at 14-14. The Jackets were still yet to find a rhythm after losing their QB and had to punt once again. The Hokies continued to run well, this time on the legs of Darren Evans.

The spark came when on the first play Washington complete a 42-yard pass to Tyler Melton. The Jackets then found themselves on fourth down with 4 yards to go. The ball was pitched to Roddy Jones who stopped and looked to throw back to Washington who was covered. Jones was able to tuck the ball, run up the middle, and get past the down marker to pick up a first down. The Jackets capped the drive with a 9-yard touchdown rush by Orwin Smith with just over 2 minutes left to play. The ensuing kickoff was returned 90 yards for a touchdown by David Wilson putting the Hokies up, 28\u201321. The Jackets made an effort on their last drive.

Carmichael was able to out-battle Melton for the slightly underthrown ball by the inexperienced Washington. This was the first time in the Paul Johnson era at Georgia Tech that his team had had back-to-back loses. ===Miami (FL)=== Pregame Line: Miami (FL) \u20132.5 In this match-up Miami was looking to stay poised to challenge Virginia Tech for the Coastal Division in their game next week.

The first quarter saw both teams able to convert on field goals as a big block in the back penalty called back a touchdown rush by Anthony Allen. In the second Tech added another field goal to make it 6\u20133. On the next possession the Blue Devils were able to catch the Jackets off-guard with a fake punt. Just three plays later Duke backup QB Brandon Connette scampered for 20 yards for the score. On the ensuing kickoff an illegal formation moved the Blue Devils back 5 yards.
