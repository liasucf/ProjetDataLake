    "text": "Philippe Pierre de St. Sevin, dit l\u2032Abb\u00e9 cadet (1698\u20131777) was a French cellist. Along with his older brother, Pierre Saint-Sevin, he was a music- master of the parish church of Agen in Aquitaine. It seems doubtful whether he was actually an ordained priest, or merely in consequence of his office had to wear the ecclesiastical dress, but from this situation he received the name l\u2032Abb\u00e9 cadet. Later, both he and his brother gave up their connection with the church and went to Paris, where they obtained engagements at the Grand Opera. Both Philippe and Pierre were excellent players, but Philippe seems to have been the more celebrated of the two, and to have been specially remarkable for his beautiful tone. It is said to have been owing in great measure to the impression produced by his playing that the viola da gamba more and more fell into disuse and the violoncello was more extensively introduced. He was the father of the violinist Joseph-Barnab\u00e9 Saint-Sevin, dit L\u2032Abb\u00e9 le Fils. ==Notes== ==References== * Category:French classical cellists Category:1698 births Category:1777 deaths Category:18th-century classical musicians ",
