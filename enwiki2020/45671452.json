    "text": "The 2015 FIBA Americas Championship for Women, held in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, was the qualifying tournament for FIBA Americas at the 2016 Summer Olympics Basketball Tournament in Brazil. The champion qualified directly for the Olympics. On the first day of the tournament, at coincident FIBA Central Board meetings in Tokyo, Brazil's men's and women's teams were granted automatic entry to the Olympic Tournament as highly ranked host teams. After allowing for Brazil's and the tournament winner's direct qualification for the Olympics, the next highest three teams in this tournament went to the final 2016 Summer Olympics Basketball Qualifying Tournament, competing against the highest placed non-winners of the other regional Championships. As Brazil fell in the semifinals, Puerto Rico and Venezuela, as the third-placed teams in their groups, contested a fifth-place match. Venezuela eventually won that match and qualified for the Olympic qualifying tournament. Canada went on to win its second title - defeating Cuba - the first after 20 years, when the tournament was also held in Canada. ==Qualification== *Host country ** (10) *Central American and Caribbean Sub-Zone: (2014 Centrobasket Women) ** (13) ** (28) ** (37) ** (-) *South American Sub-Zone: 2014 South American Basketball Championship for Women ** (7) ** (14) ** (26) ** (34) *Repechage winner: ** (-) Note: 2014 FIBA Ranking in parentheses. ==Venue== FIBA Americas awarded the hosting rights of the championship to Canada Basketball.
