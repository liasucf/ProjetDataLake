The album included singles like \"Laree Chootee\" (from Ek Chalis Ki Last Local), \"Yeh Pal\" (from Aasma: The Sky Is the Limit) and \"Dharkay Jiya\" (from Aloo Chaat) which featured in several Bollywood movies as soundtracks. The album also included patriotic songs like \"Humse Hai Ye Zamana\" and \"Aasmaan\". ==Background== In 2007, although Call had not yet announced the release of their second album, the band had released several songs on their fan site. The first single released was \"Laree Chotee\" which featured on the soundtrack of the Bollywood movie Ek Chalis Ki Last Local, with an accompanying music video. The song was remixed and arranged by DJ Suketu & Aks. In late 2007, prior to the 2007 Cricket World Cup, Call recorded and made a video for a song entitled \"Humse Hai Ye Zamana\". This was to be the official song for the Pakistan cricket team during the tournament. However, due to the team's early World Cup exit, the song was held back for a future release. On September 20, Call released the music video and put it up for download on their official website. Call also released three critically acclaimed hit singles; \"Ho Jaane De\", \"Yeh Pal\" and \"Dharkay Jiya\", the latter two being tapped into by Bollywood for the soundtracks of two different movies, which topped the charts and received positive reviews. The single \"Ho Jaane De\" was widely appreciated throughout the continent, but was criticised by some as the pop oriented song was a departure from the band's hard rock image. The song was awarded the 'Tune Of The Month' by BBC Asia and was also used in the Wall's ice cream advertisement, for which the band members have also modeled. ==Track listing== All songs composed and arranged by Call. All songs written by Zulfiqar J. Khan, except where noted. ==Personnel== ;Call *Junaid Khan - lead vocals *Zulfiqar J.
