    "text": "David Anthony Ahern (2 November 1947 \u2013 31 January 1988) was an Australian composer and music critic, who became a prominent artist in the avant-garde genre after his best-known work, Ned Kelly Music was released and performed at the Sydney Proms music series.David Ahern (1947\u20131988): Represented Artist, Australian Music Centre. Born and raised in Sydney, Ahern decided to become a composer in his mid-teens, and studied composition under Nigel Butterley and Richard Meale. His first performed work, After Mallarm\u00e9, was recorded by the South Australian Symphony Orchestra and was submitted to the International Rostrum of Composers in Paris. He travelled in Europe in the 1960s, studying under Karlheinz Stockhausen in Germany and Cornelius Cardew in London. In 1970, Ahern returned to Australia where, influenced by the Scratch Orchestra co-founded by Cardew, he formed the AZ Music ensemble at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, which included such composers and performers as Roger Frampton. == Early life == David Ahern was born on 2 November 1947 in Sydney. As a young boy, he learned how to play the violin and taught himself composition and piano. At the age of 15 he decided that he undoubtedly wanted to become a composer, and within a year he had already composed over 50 pieces. Then he began studying with Nigel Butterley and, later, Richard Meale. Ahern approached Butterley for lessons, and they had a couple of sessions together before he began working under the direction of Meale. During his time with Meale, Ahern had written his first performed composition, After Marllarm\u00e9. The piece was performed and recorded by the South Australian Symphony Orchestra and conducted by Patrick Thomas. Although John Hopkins immediately inducted After Marllarm\u00e9 into the 1967 International Rostrum of Composers in Paris, France, Meale was critical of the piece. In a later interview Meale described his knowledge of music theory and style of composition as basic and underdeveloped. During 1968, Ahern followed Karlheinz Stockhausen and his studies at his International New Music summer course (Musik f\u00fcr ein Haus project) in Darmstadt and the Cologne New Music course. After that, Ahern made his way to London to study with Cornelius Cardew. While he attended Cardew's classes at Morley College, Ahern fell in love with the scene that Cardew was cultivating in the city. Following his time with Stockhausen and Cardew, Ahern returned to Sydney in late 1969 and was inspired to create a weekly course in experimental music called \"Laboratory of the Creative Ear,\" which later evolved into an ensemble called AZ Music which was influenced by Cardew\u2019s Scratch Orchestra. The ensemble performed largely improvised works and consisted of a number of young performers and composers. == Career == Ahern wrote many compositions between 1970 and 1975. Among them were Reservoirs (1970), a set of three verbal compositions called Stereo/Mono (1971), a live performance of electronic work for wind soloist and utilizing feedback; The Rudiments of Music (1973), a chapter to Journal (1968) that attempted to establish basic elements necessary for making music. He also founded an improvisation group with two other people called the Teletopia in 1970, but disbanded in 1972. Although it is widely believed that Ahern completely stopped composing after his ineffectual performance of HiLo (1975), there are two pieces called Question of time and Rainbow mediation which are now known to come from as late as 1985. Despite the appearance of Ahern's halted career, Meale is said to have worked with Ahern again in the early 1980s after reuniting with his former student in Adelaide. Around this time, Ahern was studying Bart\u00f3k with the intent to compose a violin sonata. == Style == His music was described as \u2018daring and bizarre\u2019 by some Australian critics, others characterized his pieces as \u201ca scrambled compendium of noises, some born of musical instrument,\" and \"produced by all manner involving childish fun\u201d. Ahern\u2019s style was a mix between ideas that he had picked up in Europe with ideas that he was taught from Australia. In interviews with his former mentors and members of AZ Music, there were a wide range of opinions of his skills on the violin. Butterley described his playing as \"not very well\" and sounding like \"squeaky funny things on the violin.\" Geoffrey Barnard, a former member of AZ music said he was \"quite a competent violinist.\" Hopkins recalls a concert performance that was appalling but \"with such conviction that this was what the violin should sound like.\" Peter Sculthorpe was inspired by his commitment to the instrument and how he was able to draw the listener in with his \"dyslexic playing of the violin.\" During the length of Ahern's career, Australia sought to preserve the genre and style of classical European music. The compositions in AZ music and Teletopia, groups that challenged the principles at the time by embedding a \"unique radical 'consciousness into the Australian music psyche.\" == Discography == Ahern composed pieces for orchestras, chamber ensembles, small groups, soloists and film scores. He is known for experimenting with non-musical instruments and objects to create eccentric the eccentric melodies found in his compositions. Ahern is known to have submitted a list of compositions to the Australian Music Centre of works that were composed in 1969, but were either lost or withdrawn.

Little was spoken of him other than obscure documentation of his work that is limited to journals from performers in his music groups, interviews from former colleagues and mentors, and a few mentions in a handful of books and newspaper articles. ==References== Category:1947 births Category:1988 deaths Category:Australian male composers Category:Australian composers Category:Avant-garde composers Category:Pupils of Karlheinz Stockhausen Category:20th-century composers Category:20th-century Australian male musicians ",
