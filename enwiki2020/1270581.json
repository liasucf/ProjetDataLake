To the southeast is the crater Vitruvius. Fabbroni is named after the Italian economist, chemist and naturalist Giovanni Fabbroni. It was previously designated Vitruvius E. This is a circular crater with a conical interior formed by the inner walls gradually sloping down to the tiny floor at the midpoint. The northern rim of this crater lies along the southeastern flanks of the peak Mons Argaeus. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== *Fabbroni at The Moon Wiki * LTO-42C3 Dawes -- L&PI; topographic map * Meandering - LRO's close-up of the image of the western inner slope of Fabbroni Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
