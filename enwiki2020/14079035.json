    "text": "The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog! is a 2004 children's picture book by Mo Willems. It is about a pigeon that comes across a hot dog, and eventually shares it with a duckling. ==Reception== Booklist, reviewing The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog!, wrote \"Once again, Willems uses artistic minimalism (each page shows only the birds and the hot dog, rendered in basic lines) and spare, hilarious dialogue to convey surprisingly realistic emotions. Preschoolers who recognized themselves in the tantrum-throwing pigeon of the previous title will also see themselves in the calm, shrewd duckling that knows just how to get his way.\" and the School Library Journal wrote \" Children, especially those with younger siblings, will have come up with this obvious solution long before the pigeon does. Willems's deceptively simple cartoon drawings convincingly portray his protagonist's emotional dilemma, from his initial joy to his frustration and struggle over what he wants to do versus what he knows is right.\" The Horn Book Magazine's review noted \"Cartoonist Willems is as adept at depicting the daily dramas in a child's life as he is in using subtle changes in line to convey shifting emotions. The book's clean, minimalist design lets the duckling/pigeon performance take center stage, and the dialogue between the two is played for maximum laughs. Maybe the pigeon's shtick isn't as original this time around, but he's such an engaging character that it's still a treat to see him again.\" The Pigeon Finds a Hot Dog! has also been reviewed by Publishers Weekly, Kirkus Reviews, The Guardian, The New York Times, Children have called it a favorite book, and it won a 2008 Golden Archer Award. ==References== Category:2004 children's books Category:American picture books Category:Fictional passerine birds Category:Fictional ducks ",
