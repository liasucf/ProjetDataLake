The descendants of Ibrahim Khan are known as Ibrahim Zai(sons of Ibrahim). Yaquzai are a small segment of the whole tribe of Gandapurs. They have played no worth mentioning role in the Gandapur tribe struggle to establish themselves at Kulachi, Dera Ismail Khan in the 16th century A.D. The original name of Gandapur was Tairi Khan.
