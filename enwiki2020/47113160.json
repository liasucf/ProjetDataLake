It is headquartered in the Bay Area of California. == History == RW3 Technologies was founded in the Bay Area by Bruce Nagle in 1992. The company's primary focus was to streamline daily data entry processes for the sales industry. In 1992, RW3 introduced one of the first Land-Line CPG broker sales systems that allowed for mobile data entry. It was initially used in food brokerage, though eventually expanded to include functionality for the consumer packaged goods industry. In 2000, the company expanded its business model to include business-to-business account management. In 2010, the company began development of their first general SaaS product application since the late 1990s; the SaaS application called InStore Mobile (now MarketCheck) was released in 2011. The in-store survey application allows for two-way communication between the account rep and broker, allowing organizations to improve and track retail conditions. In 2013, RW3 released the BI Suite, a business intelligence environment that enables organizations to create views across departments and utilize multiple data sources to align sales strategies. In 2014 Smartcall was launched and marketed to the CPG industry. The application enables field sales reps to conduct traditional store calls and manage sales routes.
