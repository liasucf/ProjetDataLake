The La Luz Trailhead is accessed by taking the Forest Road 333 turnoff from Tramway Road (NM 556). ==Trail information== View from Sandia Crest of the La Luz Trail, in the rockslide switchbacks The trail originates at the La Luz Trailhead, which has an elevation of . The lower reaches of the trail are a wide dirt path that climbs at a moderate slope. This part of the trail passes through the Upper Sonoran Zone, where juniper and pi\u00f1on trees, prickly pear cactus, and cholla cactus are found. About a mile from the trailhead is the junction of La Luz Trail and the Tramway trail. The Tramway trail connects to the lower tram terminal, and allows hikers to use the tram to return to their vehicles instead of hiking the round trip. As the trail climbs the mountain, the scrub forest is replaced by the alpine forest of the Transition Zone, with ponderosa pines, blue spruce trees, and assorted wildflowers in the summer months. A scenic overlook is found at around and a distance of about . Just past this overlook is a sign that warns hikers that the trail beyond is snowy and impassable in the winter months.

Often, hikers will turn around at a set point on the trail or use the tram to only hike one way on the trail. It is recommended that all hikers be in the appropriate physical condition for their desired trip length, and to take the necessary equipment including severe weather clothing. The La Luz trail is well-worn due to the large number of hikers it receives. However, it is possible to lose the trail, as there have been some relocations of switchbacks. In the winter months, the area above the sign is very snowy, and requires snowshoes and trekking poles for passage. The trail is subject to closure due to extreme fire danger in the hot summer months. The Sandia Ranger District provides a website that has a page of current trail conditions such as ice and snow. ==La Luz Trail run== The La Luz Trail has been the site of a trail race up its slopes since 1965. After the designation of the Sandia Mountains as a wilderness area in the 1970s, the race was limited to 400 participants by the Forest Service. These slots are filled by lottery. The run is nine miles (14 km) in length, beginning with on Forest Road 333 and finishing at Sandia Crest after running of the trail.
