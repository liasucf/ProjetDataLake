    "text": "West Lothian was a Scottish county constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1950 to 1983. Its area corresponds to the Council area of West Lothian. It elected one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post voting system. The constituency is best known for its third and final MP, Tam Dalyell of the Labour Party, whose concerns about Scottish devolution were labelled \"the West Lothian question\". == History == West Lothian was created for the 1950 general election, partly replacing the previous Linlithgowshire constituency. With effect from the 1983 general election, it became two different constituencies: Linlithgow and Livingston. == Members of Parliament == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election !Member !Party!!
