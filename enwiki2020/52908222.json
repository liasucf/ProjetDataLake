    "text": "Nevan J. Krogan, a Canadian molecular biologist, is a professor in the Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF), and a senior investigator at the J. David Gladstone Institutes. He is also the Director of the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, (QBI), which focuses on developing and using quantitative approaches to study basic biological mechanisms, often related to disease areas. He serves as Director of The HARC Center, an NIH-funded collaborative group that focuses on the structural characterization of HIV-human protein complexes. Krogan's research is focused on using quantitative system approaches to help understand complex biological and biomedical problems. He has authored over 250 papers in the field of molecular biology and has given over 300 lectures and seminars around the world. == Early life and education == Krogan obtained his undergraduate degree in chemistry from the University of Regina in 1997. Upon completing his M.Sc. in 1999 at the University of Regina, Krogan started his Ph.D. at the University of Toronto with Jack Greenblatt as his doctoral advisor. During his PhD thesis, he led a project that systematically identified protein complexes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through a tandem affinity purification/mass spectrometry (AP-MS) strategy. This led to the characterization of over 500 complexes, comprising more than 4000 proteins. During this time, he worked on developing an approach, termed E-MAP, for high throughput generation and quantitative analysis of genetic interaction data. Combining the genetic and protein-protein interaction data led to a deeper understanding of the relationship between physical and genetic data as well as insight into a wide variety of biological processes, including chromatin function, transcription, protein trafficking and RNA processing. == Career == In July 2011, Krogan joined the Gladstone Institute of Virology and Immunology (GIVI) and Gladstone Institute of Cardiac Disease (GICD) as an associate investigator. In 2012, he led a comprehensive study using AP-MS to systematically identify protein-protein interactions between HIV and host cells. 497 different HIV-human protein-protein interactions were identified, only 19 of which had been previously reported in the literature. . Krogan was appointed director of the UCSF-QB3 in July 2013. The same year, he was also promoted to senior investigator at the GIVI and GICD. He created the Thermo Fisher Scientific Mass Spectrometry Facility for Disease Target Discovery at the J. David Gladstone Institute and serves as its Director. Krogan, along with Trey Ideker at UCSD, launched the Cancer Cell Map Initiative (CCMI) at UCSF in 2015. The group, which includes many investigators at UCSF and UCSD, focuses on using systems approaches and network biology to interpret cancer genomic data. == Awards and honors == *2004 \u2013 Hannah Farkas-Himsley and Alexander Memorial Award *2005 \u2013 L.
