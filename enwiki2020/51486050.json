In present-day Montreal, Little Burgundy and the boroughs of C\u00f4te-des- Neiges\u2013Notre-Dame-de-Gr\u00e2ce, LaSalle, Pierrefonds-Roxboro, and Montr\u00e9al-Nord have large Black populations, the latter of which has a large Haitian population. ==History== Mathieu de Costa, the first recorded free black person to arrive in Canada. The first recorded black person to set foot on land now known as Canada was a free man named Mathieu de Costa. Travelling with navigator Samuel de Champlain, de Costa arrived in Nova Scotia some time between 1603 and 1608 as a translator for the French explorer Pierre Dugua, Sieur de Monts. The first known black person to live in what would become Canada was a slave from Madagascar named Olivier Le Jeune, who may have been of partial Malay ancestry. As a group, black people arrived in Canada in several waves. The first of these came as free persons serving in the French Army and Navy, though some were enslaved or indentured servants. Marie-Joseph Ang\u00e9lique, a black slave from the Madeira islands who arrived in New France in 1725, was accused of setting the fire that burned down most of Montreal on 10 April 1734, for which she was executed.l Ang\u00e9lique confessed under torture to setting fire to the home of her owner, a Mme Francois Poulin de Francheville, as a way of creating a diversion so she could escape as she did not wish to be separated from her lover, a white servant named Claude Thibault. Ang\u00e9lique believed her owner was going to sell her to the owner of a sugar plantation in the West Indies. Whether this confession was genuine or not continues to divide historians. Joseph, a black slave who spoke French and English, escaped from his owner in Montreal in 1769. Several other black slaves escaped from the area over the following decades. Many of Canada's railway porters were recruited from the U.S., with many coming from the South, New York City, and Washington, D.C. They settled mainly in the major cities of Montreal, Toronto, Winnipeg and Vancouver, which had major rail connections. In Montreal, they settled primarily in the Little Burgundy neighbourhood. The railroads were considered to have good positions, with steady work and a chance to travel. To combat poverty and social exclusion, the nascent black community of Little Burgundy founded numerous social organizations: the Women's Coloured Club of Montreal in 1902, the Union United Congregational Church in 1907, and the Negro Community Center in 1927.\"Little Burgundy.\" McGill University Faculty of Architecture. Accessed July 4, 2011. The neighbourhood became famous for producing several talented jazz musicians. During Prohibition and the later pre-Jean Drapeau years as an 'open city,' Little Burgundy was home to many lively nightclubs featuring homegrown and international performers; one of them was Rockhead's Paradise, owned by Rufus Rockhead, after whom a street is named. Oscar Peterson and Oliver Jones are the two best-known musicians who emerged from the bebop and post-bop era. In 1968 the Sir George Williams affair occurred as a result of racist policies at Sir George Williams University. West Indian women, from both the Francophone and Anglophone Caribbean, came to Montreal after the Domestic Immigration Program of 1955 was established.Dubinsky, Karen. \"\"We Adopted a Negro\": Interractial Adoption and the Hybrid Baby in 1960s Canada\" (Chapter 11).

Retrieved on October 7, 2014. Most settled in Little Burgundy. Canada maintained its restrictions of immigration until 1962, when racial rules were eliminated from the immigration laws. This coincided with the dissolution of the British Empire in the Caribbean. Over the next decades, several hundred thousand Afro-Caribbeans came from that region, becoming the predominant black population in Canada. Since then, an increasing number of new immigrants from Africa have been coming to Canada; they have also immigrated to the United States and Europe. This includes large numbers of refugees, but also many skilled and professional workers pursuing better economic conditions. Today's Black Canadians are largely of Caribbean origin, with some of recent African origin, and smaller numbers from the United States, Europe and Latin America. Montreal's Haitian community of 100,000 people is the largest in Canada. Large percentages of Haitians live in Montr\u00e9al-Nord, Saint-Michel and R.D.P. Today, Haitian Creole is the sixth most spoken language in Montreal and the seventh most spoken language in the province of Quebec. ==Culture== Carifiesta () is an annual Caribbean Carnival held in Montreal. The festival incorporates the diversities that exist among the Canadians of African and Caribbean descent. The Montreal Black Film Festival is held annually. Black Canadians have had a major influence on Canadian music, helping pioneer many genres including Canadian hip hop, Canadian blues, Canadian jazz, R&B;, Caribbean music, pop music and classical music. Some of the earliest musical influences include Oliver Jones, Oscar Peterson and Charlie Biddle. Because the visibility of distinctively Black Canadian cultural output is still a relatively recent phenomenon, academic, critical and sociological analysis of Black Canadian literature, music, television and film tends to focus on the ways in which cultural creators are actively engaging the process of creating a cultural space for themselves which is distinct from both mainstream Canadian culture and African American culture.Rinaldo Walcott, Black Like Who?: Writing Black Canada. 2003, Insomniac Press. . For example, most of the Black-themed television series which have been produced in Canada to date have been ensemble cast comedy or drama series centred around the creation and/or expansion of a Black-oriented cultural or community institution. ==Institutions== * the Negro Community Centre *Union United Church *Oscar Peterson Park *Youth In Motion Community Centre *Tyndale St. George's Community Centre *Black Community Resource Centre *Black Theatre Workshop, Montreal ==Media== The Community Contact is a newspaper serving Montreal's Black and Caribbean Community.
