    "text": "right Area codes 812 and 930 are telephone area codes in the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for the southern third of the state of Indiana. The numbering plan area (NPA) includes Evansville and most of its suburbs, the Indiana portions of the Louisville and Cincinnati metropolitan areas, and the cities of Bedford, Bloomington, Columbus, Greensburg, Jasper, Princeton, Seymour, Terre Haute, and Vincennes. Area code 812 was one of the original NANP area codes introduced in 1947. Despite the presence of Evansville, Terre Haute and Bloomington, southern Indiana is not as densely populated as the rest of the state. As a result, this configuration remained in place for more than six decades, making 812 one of the few original area codes (not counting those covering an entire state) that still had its original boundaries. On July 31, 2013, it was announced that 812 would be overlaid with area code 930, the state's first overlay.https://www.nationalnanpa.com/pdf/PL_457.pdf NANPA Planning Letter 457 The move came because 812 was expected to exhaust in 2015, particularly in Evansville and the Louisville and Cincinnati suburbs. On March 1, 2014, a six-month permissive dialing period began, during which it was possible to complete calls within the 812 area with both seven and ten digits. Mandatory ten-digit dialing was originally planned for September 6, 2014 with the first 930 numbers to become available in October. However, in August, the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission delayed the implementation of mandatory ten-digit dialing until February 7, 2015, and the assignments of the first 930 numbers until March 7 to provide law enforcement and emergency medical services more time to update their telecommunication equipment. Until the implementation of 930, 812 had been one of the few original area codes (not counting whole-state area codes) to have never been split or overlaid. ==Service area== ===Counties (partial)=== * Brown * Clay * Decatur * Franklin * Johnson * Monroe * Owen * Rush * Shelby * Vigo ===Counties (entirely)=== * Bartholomew * Clark * Crawford * Daviess * Dearborn * Dubois * Floyd * Gibson * Greene * Harrison * Jackson * Jefferson * Jennings * Knox * Lawrence * Martin * Ohio * Orange * Perry * Pike * Posey * Ripley * Scott * Spencer * Sullivan * Switzerland * Vanderburgh * Warrick * Washington | ===Communities=== *Austin *Aurora *Batesville *Bedford *Bicknell *Bloomfield *Bloomington *Boonville *Brazil *Chandler *Charlestown *Chrisney *Clarksville *Columbus *Corydon *Crandall *Dale *Depauw *Darmstadt *Edinburgh *Elizabeth *Ellettsville *English *Evansville *Farmersburg *Ferdinand *Fort Branch *Fredericksburg *Georgetown *Greensburg *Hardinsburg *Hatfield *Haubstadt *Huntingburg *Jasonville *Jasper *Jeffersonville *Lawrenceburg *Leavenworth *Lincoln City *Linton *Loogootee *Madison *Marengo *Mauckport *Milan *Millhousen *Milltown *Mitchell *Morgantown *Mount Vernon *Nashville *New Albany *New Harmony *New Salisbury *Newburgh *North Vernon *Oakland City *Orleans *Owensville *Paoli *Palmyra *Patoka *Petersburg *Poseyville *Princeton *Ramsey *Reo *Richland *Rising Sun *Rockport *Salem *Santa Claus *Scottsburg *Sellersburg *Seymour *Shoals *Sullivan *Taswell *Tell City *Terre Haute *Vevay *Vincennes *Washington *Worthington *Westport *Yankeetown ==See also== *List of NANP area codes * List of Indiana area codes ==References== ==External links== * List of exchanges from AreaCodeDownload.com, 812 Area Code 812 812 Category:Southwestern Indiana Category:Telecommunications-related introductions in 1947 Category:1947 establishments in Indiana Category:2015 establishments in Indiana ",
