Built in 1808 and opened until 1996, it was the main railway station between San Jos\u00e9 and Lim\u00f3n, where the main freight port is located. The emblematic building combines victorian, neoclassical and baroque architectures, with some modernist details. In 2011 a restoration effort by the Ministry of Culture and Youth took place to reopen the station as a railway station for the urban train between the cantons of San Jos\u00e9, Alajuela, Cartago and Heredia. ==Shapes, Spaces and Sounds Museum== Between 2002 and 2008 the station was the location of the Shapes, Spaces and Sounds Museum (). The Shapes () room of the museum featured numerous sculptures in wood and stone whilst the Spaces () room featured scale models of buildings and the ruins of Ujarr\u00e1s. The Sounds () room had a collection of musical instruments on display. The museum also had a notable collection related to the history of railways in Costa Rica, including Locomotive #59, a 1939 steam locomotive imported from Philadelphia and a bust of Tomas Guardia who established the railway in the country. The museum closed in October 2007. ==See also== *Rail transport in Costa Rica *Interurbano Line *List of museums in Costa Rica ==References== Category:Rail transport in Costa Rica Category:Museums in San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica Category:Art museums and galleries in Costa Rica Category:Museums established in 2002 Museo de Formas Espacios y Sonidos Atl\u00e1ntico railway station ",
