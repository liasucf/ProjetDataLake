She was the eldest daughter of Sergey Aksakov. Her brothers Konstantin and Ivan Aksakov were both noted Slavophiles. Aksakova is known for her diary which gives an interesting insight into Russian life during the Crimea War. It starts on 14 November 1854 and ends a year later on 15 November. She reports hopefully on the death of Tsar Nicholas I in a three page entry. She feels regret that a man has died but is optimistic about his successor. She later records the loss of national prestige with her country's defeat at the Siege of Sebastopol. == References == Category:1819 births Category:1864 deaths Category:19th-century Russian writers Category:19th-century Russian women writers ",
