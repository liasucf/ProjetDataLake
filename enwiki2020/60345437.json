In 1872 he moved to Berlin and started a small premise at Kronenstra\u00dfe and soon after the M. Kempinski & Co. wine restaurant at Friedrichstra\u00dfe / Leipziger Stra\u00dfe junction. The restaurant became popular for its huge selection of wine and seasonal delicacies like oysters and crayfish. Kempinski invented the table d'h\u00f4te for a fixed price (1,25 Mark) and the \"half portion\" for (0,75 Mark, later 0,85 Mark) which made fine dining affordable for the middle-class population. In 1889 the Kempinki restaurant at Leipziger Stra\u00dfe 25 was opened, the largest business of its kind in Berlin. Wilhelm II selected the mayolica tiles from his Cadiner Majolika manufactury and attended the opening of the Kaisersaal (Emperor's hall). Kempinski later specialised on wine trading and devolved the management to his son in law and his nephew. Kempinski died 14 March 1910 in Berlin and was buried in an honorary grave at the Jewish Wei\u00dfensee cemetery. In an obituary the Berliner Tageblatt called him one of the most popular men of Berlin. ==References== Category:1843 births Category:1910 deaths Category:People from Raszk\u00f3w Category:People from the Province of Posen Category:Kempinski Hotels Category:German Jews Category:German hoteliers Category:German restaurateurs Category:Businesspeople from Berlin ",
