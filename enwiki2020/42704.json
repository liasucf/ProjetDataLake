    "text": "A transatlantic telecommunications cable is a submarine communications cable connecting one side of the Atlantic Ocean to the other. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, each cable was a single wire. After mid-century, coaxial cable came into use, with amplifiers. Late in the century, all used optical fiber, and most now use optical amplifiers. ==History== When the first transatlantic telegraph cable was laid in 1858 by Cyrus West Field, it operated for only three weeks; subsequent attempts in 1865 and 1866 were more successful. Although a telephone cable was discussed starting in the 1920s, to be practical, it needed a number of technological advances which did not arrive until the 1940s. Starting in 1927, transatlantic telephone service was radio- based.Short-Wave System for Transatlantic Telephony, by Polkinghorn and Schlaack BSTJ, 1935 TAT-1 (Transatlantic No. 1) was the first transatlantic telephone cable system. It was laid between Gallanach Bay, near Oban, and Clarenville, Newfoundland between 1955 and 1956 by the cable ship Monarch.\"Being First Telephone Cable to Connect Hemispheres\". Popular Mechanics, March 1954, p. 114. It was inaugurated on September 25, 1956, initially carrying 36 telephone channels. In the first 24 hours of public service, there were 588 London\u2013U.S. calls and 119 from London to Canada. The capacity of the cable was soon increased to 48 channels. Later, an additional three channels were added by use of C Carrier equipment. Time-assignment speech interpolation (TASI) was implemented on the TAT-1 cable in June 1960 and effectively increased the cable's capacity from 37 (out of 51 available channels) to 72 speech circuits. TAT-1 was finally retired in 1978. Later coaxial cables, installed through the 1970s, used transistors and had higher bandwidth. The Moscow\u2013Washington hotline was initially connected through this system. ==Current technology== All cables presently in service use fiber optic technology. Many cables terminate in Newfoundland and Ireland, which lie on the great circle route (the shortest route) from London, UK to New York City, US. There has been a succession of newer transatlantic cable systems. All recent systems have used fiber optic transmission, and a self-healing ring topology. Late in the 20th century, communications satellites lost most of their North Atlantic telephone traffic to these low-cost, high-capacity, low- latency cables. This advantage only increases over time, as tighter cables provide higher bandwidth \u2013 the 2012 generation of cables drop the transatlantic latency to under 60 milliseconds, according to Hibernia Atlantic, deploying such a cable that year. Some new cables are being announced on the South Atlantic: SACS (South Atlantic Cable System) and SAex (South Atlantic Express). ==TAT cable routes== The TAT series of cables constitute a large percentage of all North Atlantic cables. All TAT cables are joint ventures between a number of telecommunications companies, e.g. British Telecom. CANTAT cables terminate in Canada rather than in the US. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Name!!In service!!Type!!Initial channels!!Final channels!!Western end!!Eastern end |- |TAT-1||1956\u20131978||Galvanic||36||51||Newfoundland||Scotland |- |TAT-2||1959\u20131982||Galvanic||48||72||Newfoundland||France |- |TAT-3||1963\u20131986||Galvanic||138||276||New Jersey||England |- |TAT-4||1965\u20131987||Galvanic||138||345||New Jersey||France |- |TAT-5||1970\u20131993||Galvanic||845||2,112||Rhode Island||Spain |- |TAT-6||1976\u20131994||Galvanic||4,000||10,000||Rhode Island||France |- |TAT-7||1978\u20131994||Galvanic||4,000||10,500||New Jersey||England |- |TAT-8||1988\u20132002||Fiber-optic||40,000||\u2013||New Jersey||England, France |- |TAT-9||1992\u20132004||Fiber-optic |80,000||\u2013||New Jersey, Nova Scotia||Spain, France, England |- |TAT-10||1992\u20132003||Fiber-optic |2 \u00d7 565 Mbit/s||\u2013||US||Germany, Netherlands |- |TAT-11||1993\u20132003||Fiber-optic |2 \u00d7 565 Mbit/s||\u2013||New Jersey||France |- |TAT-12/13||1996\u20132008||Fiber-optic |12 \u00d7 2.5 Gbit/s||\u2013||US \u00d7 2||England, France |- |TAT-14||2001\u2013||Fiber-optic |3.2 Tbit/s||\u2013||New Jersey \u00d7 2||England, France, Netherlands, Germany, Denmark |- |CANTAT-1||1961\u20131986||Galvanic||80||\u2013||Newfoundland||Scotland |- |CANTAT-2||1974\u20131992||Galvanic||1,840||\u2013||Nova Scotia||England |- |CANTAT-3||1994\u20132010||Fiber-optic |2 \u00d7 2.5 Gbit/s||||Nova Scotia||Iceland, Faroe Islands, England, Denmark, Germany |- |PTAT-1||1989\u20132004||Fiber-optic |3 \u00d7 140 Mbit/s?||||New Jersey & Bermuda||Ireland & England |} ==Private cable routes== There are a number of private non-TAT cables. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
