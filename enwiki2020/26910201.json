    "text": "The 2010\u201311 season was Manchester City Football Club's 109th season of football, its ninth consecutive season in the Premier League, and its 14th season in the Premier League since it was first created with Manchester City as one of its original 22 founding member clubs. The team finished fifth in the previous season, thereby qualifying for an opportunity to compete in this season's Europa League. The club was managed by Roberto Mancini who had been appointed as manager midway through the previous season. == Season review == In the summer transfer window, the club, one of the richest in the world since its 2008 takeover by the Abu Dhabi United Group, spent \u00a3126 million on players, including J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng from Hamburger SV, Yaya Tour\u00e9 from Barcelona, David Silva from Valencia, Aleksandar Kolarov from Lazio, Mario Balotelli from Inter Milan and James Milner from Aston Villa. Popular City midfielder Stephen Ireland was transferred to Aston Villa as part of a player exchange agreement in the Milner deal. The team began this season's campaign well, collecting four out of a possible six points against \"Top 7\" opponents Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool, which was three points more than City managed in the comparable fixtures last season. City then stuttered for a couple of games against Sunderland (away) and Blackburn Rovers (at home), bagging only a single home point out of the six despite completely dominating both games, with (according to manager Roberto Mancini) at least 25 missed chances in the Blackburn game alone. City got itself back on a winning track again with a 0\u20132 away win against Wigan Athletic, which was the first time the team had ever won at the DW Stadium, breaking what some supporters had labelled a jinx for this fixture. After the previous season's run to the semi-final of the League Cup, the team's performance in that competition this season was very disappointing, with the Blues falling at the first hurdle, losing 2\u20131 to West Bromwich Albion in the third round tie played at The Hawthorns. The team began its Europa League campaign in much better style, clocking up three back-to- back wins in its first three games. In the first leg 1\u20130 away victory over Timi\u0219oara in the play-off round, Mario Balotelli scored the single winning goal on his debut, but also incurred a serious knee injury that required surgery, putting him out of action for the next three months. Balotelli was not the only one of City's new crop of high-profile summer signings to fall victim to an early serious injury, with J\u00e9r\u00f4me Boateng missing out on the first six weeks of the new season due to a knee injury he picked up playing for Germany in an international friendly match against Denmark back in mid- August, while Aleksandar Kolarov seriously damaged his ankle ligaments in the opening match of the season against Tottenham Hotspur. The loss of Boateng and Kolarov \u2013 taken together with recent injuries to Micah Richards (hamstring), Wayne Bridge (thigh injury coming right on the back of a prolonged absence due to a cracked foot bone) and Joleon Lescott (groin) \u2013 meant that Roberto Mancini found himself without five of his eight main back four defenders going into City's home match against Chelsea, causing him to claim that he had a defensive injury crisis for that game, which nevertheless City still managed to win convincingly due to a stellar defensive performance from the back four (Dedryck Boyata, Kolo Tour\u00e9, Vincent Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta) that Mancini was able to field. Manchester City ended their 35-year trophy drought by beating Stoke 1\u20130 in the FA Cup Final at Wembley, courtesy of a Yaya Tour\u00e9 goal in the 74th minute. ==Kit== Supplier: Umbro / Sponsor: Etihad Airways {|border=\"0\" | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |} ===Kit information=== Umbro made a new set of kits for Manchester City whilst they were in their second year of contract with the club. *Home: The home kit was in the club's traditional colours of sky blue and white in a classic design modelled on the club outfits worn in the late 1960s. Featuring white cuffs and subtle shadow stripes on the body, the home strip was kitted out with white shorts and sky blue socks, which had a maroon turnover on the top. *Away: The away kit was mainly navy with sky blue detailing and sported thin horizontal sky blue striping on the socks. The kit was described on the club's website as the \"dark side of the moon\". *Third: The white third kit last season was retained, but was refitted with white shorts and socks, the latter sporting a red-and- black band to echo the sash on the body. *Keeper: The last season goalkeeper kits were also retained, though a new all-black kit had been added to the collection for this season, to be used primarily with the home team kit. Last season's all-green home goalkeeper strip had been moved over to the away kit, although it was still used with the home team kit when the all-black kit was considered to be too close in colour to the opposition's strip (e.g., Chelsea and Newcastle United). The gold-and-black goalkeeper strip that was used primarily with the away kit last season had been retained as an alternate (third) choice kit for the goalkeepers. As could be determined from the foregoing, which of the three team kits these goalkeeper strips were actually used with was not a hard and fast rule since any of these strips could be swapped around (if necessary) in order to avoid kit clashes with the opponents' team strips or the opponents' goalkeeper strips, as well as avoiding clashes with the strips worn by the match officials. On 2 February 2011, there was a minor \"kit faux pas\" when the Manchester City team wore its regular home team kit for its away fixture against Birmingham City at St Andrew's, a fixture that usually required the visiting Manchester City team to use one of its alternative strips (in this case, its third team kit since the midnight blue away kit also represented a colour clash) as the primary home team colours of both sides combined a blue shirt with white shorts. No explanation had ever come as to why this mix-up occurred (because as per which kits were to be worn in which fixtures was determined before the season even began), or why the referee, Kevin Friend, allowed two teams so similarly clad onto the pitch rather than insist that one of them first change its kit, although Birmingham's 2010\u201311 home shirt features large elements of white. Since then, there have been several instances of City wearing sky blue against teams in royal blue. == Pre-season games == ;Friendly ;New York Football Challenge ;Atlanta International Soccer Challenge ;Pirelli Cup ;Ferrostaal Cup, Summer of Champions ;Friendly == Competitions == === Premier League === ==== League table ==== ==== Results summary ==== ====Points breakdown==== Points at home: 43 Points away from home: 28 Points against 2009/10 Top Four: 9 Points against promoted teams: 18 :6 points: Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers, Newcastle United, West Bromwich Albion, :::West Ham United, Wigan Athletic :4 points: Blackburn Rovers, Fulham, Stoke City, Tottenham Hotspur :3 points: Aston Villa, Chelsea, Liverpool, Sunderland, Wolverhampton Wanderers :2 points: Birmingham City :1 point: Arsenal, Manchester United :0 points: Everton ====Biggest & smallest==== Biggest home win: 5\u20130 vs. Sunderland, 3 April 2011 Biggest home defeat: 0\u20133 vs. Arsenal, 24 October 2010 Biggest away win: 1\u20134 vs. Fulham, November 2010 Biggest away defeat: 3\u20130 vs. Liverpool, 11 April 2011 Biggest home attendance: 47,393 vs. Arsenal, 24 October 2010 Smallest home attendance: 43,077 vs. Fulham, 27 February 2011 Biggest away attendance: 75,322 vs. Manchester United, 12 February 2011 Smallest away attendance: 15,525 vs. Wigan Athletic, 19 September 2010 ==== Results by round ==== ==== Matches ==== === FA Cup === === League Cup === === UEFA Europa League === ====Play-off round==== ==== Group stage ==== Manchester City prepare to kick off their opening Europa League group fixture vs. Red Bull Salzburg. ==== Knockout phase ==== =====Round of 32===== =====Round of 16===== ==Squad information== ===Playing statistics=== Appearances (Apps.) numbers are for appearances in competitive games only including sub appearances Red card numbers denote: Numbers in parentheses represent red cards overturned for wrongful dismissal. {| class=\"wikitable sortable alternance\" style=\"font- size:86%; text-align:center; line-height:14px; width:100%;\" |- !
