In this best-of-seven playoff, the defending NBA champions and Western Conference champions Golden State Warriors swept the defending Eastern Conference champions Cleveland Cavaliers four games to zero. This year's Finals was the first time in any of North America's four major professional sports leagues that the same two teams met for the championship four years in a row. This was also the first time that a team was swept in the NBA Finals since 2007, in which the Cavaliers were also the losing team. LeBron James, in his eighth consecutive NBA Finals appearance and ninth appearance overall, suffered the second Finals sweep of his career, having also played in the 2007 Finals. Warriors small forward Kevin Durant was named NBA Finals MVP for the second straight year. The Warriors entered the series having home-court advantage with a regular season record of , compared to the Cavaliers' regular season record of . Entering the matchup, the Warriors were also noted by various sports media outlets as one of the biggest NBA Finals favorites in recent history. This was the first time since 2012 that the Finals did not feature either of the top seeds in each conference. The 2018 Finals began on May 31 and ended on June 8. The series broke the record set by the 2014 NBA Finals for highest average scoring differential per game (15.0) for an NBA Finals series. ==Background== ===Cleveland Cavaliers=== This was the Cleveland Cavaliers' fourth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, and fifth appearance overall. This was also the eighth consecutive NBA Finals appearance for Cavaliers small forward LeBron James. LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers Prior to the 2017\u201318 season, All-Star point guard Kyrie Irving requested to be traded away from the Cavaliers. Although James was against the idea of trading him away, the Cavaliers agreed to Irving's request, trading him to the Boston Celtics in exchange for point guard Isaiah Thomas, small forward Jae Crowder, center Ante \u017di\u017ei\u0107, the first round pick from the Brooklyn Nets in the 2018 NBA Draft and the Miami Heat's 2020 second round pick. Miami's second round pick was added as compensation after Isaiah Thomas failed his physical. Other major changes included shooting guard Dwyane Wade signing with the Cavaliers, thus reuniting with James from their time together on the Big Three-era Miami Heat, and the signing of point guard Derrick Rose to a one-year contract. On February 8, 2018 \u2013 just before the NBA trade deadline \u2013 the Cavaliers radically changed their roster in a little more than an hour, acquiring George Hill, Rodney Hood, Jordan Clarkson, and Larry Nance Jr. in exchange for Thomas, Rose, Crowder, Wade, Channing Frye, Iman Shumpert, and their own 2018 first-round pick. Multiple writers argued at the time that the trades made the Cavaliers significantly better. The Cavaliers finished the regular season with a 50\u201332 record, securing the 4th seed in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, the Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers in seven games in the first round, swept the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in the Eastern Conference semifinals, and defeated the Boston Celtics in seven games in the Eastern Conference Finals. ===Golden State Warriors=== This was the Golden State Warriors' fourth consecutive trip to the NBA Finals. During the 2017\u201318 offseason, the Warriors resigned their core players, including point guard Stephen Curry to a five-year contract worth $201 million, and Kevin Durant to a two-year, $53 million contract. Golden State also resigned Andre Iguodala, Shaun Livingston, Zaza Pachulia, and David West. A major free agent acquired during the offseason was guard Nick Young. The Warriors finished the 2017\u201318 regular season with a 58\u201324 record, winning the Pacific Division and securing the 2nd seed in the Western Conference. In the playoffs, Golden State defeated the San Antonio Spurs in five games in the first round, eliminated the New Orleans Pelicans in five games in the Western Conference semifinals, and defeated the 65-win Houston Rockets in seven games in the Western Conference Finals. The Warriors entered the series as heavy favorites. ===Road to the Finals=== {| style=\"width:100%; font-size:90%\" class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=top ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"|Cleveland Cavaliers (Eastern Conference champion) !! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:45%;\"|Golden State Warriors (Western Conference champion) |- |align=right| 4th seed in the East, 6th best league record !colspan=2|Regular season | 2nd seed in the West, 3rd best league record |- |align=right|Defeated the 5th seeded Indiana Pacers, 4\u20133 !colspan=2|First round |align=left|Defeated the 7th seeded San Antonio Spurs, 4\u20131 |- |align=right|Defeated the 1st seeded Toronto Raptors, 4\u20130 !colspan=2|Conference Semifinals |align=left|Defeated the 6th seeded New Orleans Pelicans, 4\u20131 |- |align=right|Defeated the 2nd seeded Boston Celtics, 4\u20133 !colspan=2|Conference Finals |align=left|Defeated the 1st seeded Houston Rockets, 4\u20133 |} ===Regular season series=== The Warriors won the regular season series 2\u20130. ==Series summary== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"|Game ! scope=\"col\"|Date ! scope=\"col\"|Away Team ! scope=\"col\"|Result ! scope=\"col\"|Home Team |- !scope=\"row\"| Game 1 | Thursday, May 31 || Cleveland Cavaliers || 114\u2013124 (OT) (0\u20131) || Golden State Warriors |- !scope=\"row\"| Game 2 | Sunday, June 3 || Cleveland Cavaliers || 103\u2013122 (0\u20132) || Golden State Warriors |- !scope=\"row\"| Game 3 | Wednesday, June 6 || Golden State Warriors || 110\u2013102 (3\u20130) || Cleveland Cavaliers |- !scope=\"row\"| Game 4 | Friday, June 8 || Golden State Warriors || 108\u201385 (4\u20130) || Cleveland Cavaliers |} ==Game summaries== :All times are in Eastern Daylight Time (UTC\u22124) ===Game 1=== Klay Thompson of the Warriors suffered a leg injury in the first quarter, but returned to the game in the second quarter.

Smith of the Cavaliers collected an offensive rebound following a missed free throw, but dribbled the ball towards half court rather than taking a final shot.

Tristan Thompson was ejected following a flagrant foul with 2.6 seconds remaining in overtime. Cleveland's LeBron James scored 51 points in Game 1, the sixth-highest point total for an NBA Finals game and the most in a loss.

The Warriors won 122\u2013103 over the Cavaliers. ===Game 3=== Andre Iguodala of the Warriors, who missed the previous six games, including the first two games of the NBA Finals, due to a left leg injury, returned in Game 3. He injured his right leg early in the game, not returning until after halftime. The Cavaliers started the game with a 14\u20134 advantage and led for the entire first half, at one point leading by 13. The Warriors trimmed Cleveland's lead to six by halftime. The Cavaliers enjoyed strong contributions from Rodney Hood, who scored 15 points, Smith, who scored 13 points, and Kevin Love, who had 20 points and 13 rebounds.

The Cavaliers were 3-for-17 (17.6%) on three point shots in the second half, and Durant scored a three-pointer late in the game that ended Cleveland's chances of a comeback. With the 110\u2013102 victory, the Warriors took a 3\u20130 series lead. ===Game 4=== The Warriors led the game nearly from start to finish. Golden State led 13\u20133 at the start of the game. Though the Cavaliers took the lead, 39\u201338, in the second quarter, the Warriors led 61\u201352 at halftime. The Warriors expanded their lead in the third quarter and entered the last period of play with an 86\u201365 advantage. With Golden State leading 102\u201377 with 4:03 remaining, James came out of the game, receiving a standing ovation. Curry scored 37 points and made seven three-pointers, while Durant recorded a triple-double with 20 points, 12 rebounds and 10 assists. The Warriors won 108\u201385 to sweep the series.
