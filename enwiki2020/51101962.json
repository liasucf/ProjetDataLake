    "text": "Josep Maria de Sagarra i de Castellarnau (Barcelona, 5 March 1894 \u2013 27 September 1961) was a Catalan language writer from Barcelona, Spain. == Biography == Born in Barcelona in 1894, in the breast of a family of the Catalan nobility being son of the historian and sigil\u00f3grafo Fernando de Sagarra i de Siscar. He attended a Jesuit high school and studied Law at the University of Barcelona, initially with the purpose of entering into a diplomatic career. However he quickly decided to become a writer and at the age of 18 won a prize of poetry in the Floral Games. He became a full time journalist who worked as a correspondent in Germany and as a theatrical critic. However his main work developed in the field of the literature, especially in theatre and poetry, that he wrote always in Catalan. He collaborated with assiduity in the press, especially in La publicidad and Mirador. It suits to remark also his work as a translator: the Divine comedy of Dante, and the theatre of Shakespeare, Moli\u00e8re and Gogol. Part of his poetry was inspired by the popular chansonnier and by well known ancient legends, what turned him into a very popular poet that, in many respects, occupied the place that had left empty Frederic Soler, Verdaguer, Guimer\u00e0 or Maragall. In 1955 he won the National Prize of Theatre for La Ferida Luminosa, whose version in Spanish was made by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Pem\u00e1n. In the last years of life he was a member of the Institute of Catalan Studies, the Academy of the Good Letters, General Council of Authors of Spain and the Board of the Big Cross of Alfonso X the Wise person. After a long illness, he died in Barcelona on September 27, 1961, and was laid to rest on the Cemetery of Montju\u00efc. A good part of his works have been translated to several languages and some have been adapted to the cinema (El caf\u00e8 de la Marina and La herida luminosa). His poems Llu\u00eds Llach, Guillermina Motta and Ovidi Montllor, among others, were set to music. == Main works == === Poetry === * (1914) * (1916) * , (1918) * , (1922) * , (1923) * , (1925) * , (1928), long poem in heroic verse * , (1933) * , (1936) * , (1938) * , (1950) * , traducci\u00f3n de Dante, (1950) === Novel === * , (1919) * , (1929) * , (1932) Award winner Joan Crexells === Anthologies of newspaper articles === * , (1929) * , (1937) o (1946) * , (1959), in Spanish * , (1954) * \"\" (2001) * \"\" (2004) === Theatre === * (1918) * (1921) * (1922) * (1923) * (1923) * (1925) * , (1928), comedy * , (1928), comedy * , (1935) * , (1929) * , (1926) * , (1929) * , (2000) * , (1931) * , (1933) * , (1934) * , (1935) * , (1946) * , (1947) * , (1948) * , (1949) * , (1950) * , (1952) * La herida luminosa, (1954) * , (1955) * ,translated from Moli\u00e8re, (1960) * ,translated from Gogol, (1961) === Other works === * , (1922) * \"\" (1960), tourist guide * , edition posthumously (1968), literary criticism ==References== == External links == * Page devoted to Josep Maria of Sagarra, in lletrA, the space of Catalan literature of the Open University of Catalonia, in Spanish. == References == Category:Writers from Barcelona Category:20th-century Spanish writers Category:20th-century Spanish male writers Category:1961 deaths Category:Members of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans Category:1894 births Category:Catalan-language poets Category:Translators to Catalan Category:Catalan translators Category:20th- century translators ",
