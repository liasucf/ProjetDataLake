    "text": "Jan Malte Metzelder (born 19 May 1982) is a German former professional footballer who played as a central defender. He appeared in the Bundesliga for Borussia Dortmund, but spent most of his career in the lower leagues. ==Football career== Born in Haltern, North Rhine-Westphalia, Metzelder made his professional debut with SC Preu\u00dfen M\u00fcnster in 2001, and two years later moved to Borussia Dortmund to play alongside his older brother Christoph. However, he appeared very rarely for the first team, amassing only nine Bundesliga appearances \u2013 all in 2003\u201304 \u2013 and adding two minutes in a 2\u20131 away win against FK Austria Wien for the UEFA Cup. In 2005, Metzelder left Dortmund and joined VfR Aalen in the Regionalliga S\u00fcd (then third division). Two years later he stayed in that tier, being instrumental in FC Ingolstadt 04's promotion to the second level in his first season; he left the latter club in July 2014 at the age of 32, after no competitive appearances whatsoever in his last two years. ==Personal life== Metzelder's older brother, Christoph, was also a footballer (and a centre back), and both played for Borussia Dortmund, with his sibling also playing three years at Real Madrid and representing Germany on about 50 occasions, helping the team finish second at the 2002 FIFA World Cup. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:People from Haltern Category:Footballers from North Rhine-Westphalia Category:German footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Bundesliga players Category:2.
