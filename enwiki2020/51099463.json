The location of the capital remained there for almost 60 years, until being moved to Tegucigalpa, via Decree No. 11 on October 30th, 1880. Doctor Marco Aurelio Soto, the \u201cReformer of the Republic\u201d, also relocated the judicial and legislative headquarters, the federal reserve, and the state university to Tegucigalpa. The first presidential house in the city of Tegucigalpa was a two-story wooden building built by Juan Judas Salavarr\u00eda, located on the south west side of Plaza de la Merced. Today it is the ground floor of the current Legislative Palace. The executive offices were housed on the second floor, where there were the offices of Mr. President Dr. Soto and the government Secretary General Dr. Ram\u00f3n Rosa . In 1883 the president of Honduras, the General Luis Bogr\u00e1n, decided that the busy house by the Plaza de la Merced was not suitable enough, and moved the offices to another building, which was to the right of the session hall of the National Congress. This building had stone foundations, walls made out of adobe, and wide living rooms for the governmental administration, decorated with the national banner, pavilion, shields, and paintings of the national heroes. It also had a part allocated for the guard or presidential escort, which would later become the School of Capes and Sergeants. The following Honduran presidents lived in this house: General Luis Bogr\u00e1n Barahona, General Ponciano Leiva Madrid, General Domingo V\u00e1squez Toru\u00f1o, Doctor Policarpo Bonilla V\u00e1squez, Engineer Terencio Sierra Romero, General Manuel Bonilla Chirinos, Doctor Miguel Rafael D\u00e1vila Cu\u00e9llar and Doctor Francisco Bertrand Barahona. Doctor Francisco Bertrand Barahona would again move the governmental headquarters to a new building where today one finds the Central Bank of Honduras, and where there used to be the national post office. In 1914 Honduras undertook development for a new seat of government. The Barahona administration purchased a parcel of land from Jer\u00f3nimo Zelaya for 40,000 Honduran pesos. The Italian architect Augusto Bressani designed this new presidential mansion. It was a two story stone building with a classical Victorian fa\u00e7ade, watchtowers, a presidential office, and a dome atop which flew the national flag. It also had apartments, offices on the ground floor called \u201cblue living rooms\u201d for receptions, a meeting room known as the \u201chall of mirrors\u201d, a patio and cubicles for the presidential guard, ceilings with wood and clay tiling plastered and decorated with glass shard lamps, corridors lined with statues brought from Italy, and floors paved with mosaics and ceramics made in the workshops of Bellucci in Italy. Construction finished on the new presidential house in 1919 under the presidency of the General Rafael L\u00f3pez Guti\u00e9rrez who was the first person to live in the new house. The following Honduran leaders lived in this house: General Vicente Tosta Carrasco, Doctor Miguel Paz Barahona, Doctor Vicente Mej\u00eda Colindres, Doctor and General Tiburcio Carias Andino, Doctor Juan Manuel G\u00e1lvez Dur\u00f3n, Accountant Julio Lozano D\u00edaz, the Military Triumvirate of 1956-1959, Doctor Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Adolfo Villeda Morales, General Oswaldo Enrique L\u00f3pez Arellano, Lawyer Ram\u00f3n Ernesto Cruz Ucl\u00e9s, General Juan Alberto Melgar Castro, General Policarpo Juan Paz Garc\u00eda, Doctor Roberto Suazo C\u00f3rdova, Engineer Jos\u00e9 Sim\u00f3n Azcona of the Hoyo. After 72 years of leaders living in this presidential house, and after the first two years of the administration of the Graduate Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, the presidential headquarters were moved to a modern building in the Governmental Civic Center on Miraflores Boulevard, next to the Palace of Justice. Callejas would order the restoration of the former presidential mansion, which would be urgent and costly, as the building had been given to the National Archive of Honduras (NAH) and a national museum, and the former presidential mansion had been elevated to the status of National Historical Heritage.

At the end the ex Presidential House of Honduras that occupy the president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero, situated in The Governmental Civic Centre, Tegucigalpa, M.D.C. In the following two years of his government, the president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero would work in a six story building where there were also the offices of the executive, presidential appointees, presidential advisers, the paymaster, information and governmental press, the secretariat hall events, the chamber of ministers and other units. While still bigger than the former presidential mansion, even this new building didn't fulfill the needs of the executive branch. In the new building Callejas received his successor, Doctor Carlos Roberto Reina Idi\u00e1quez, in 1994. == Current presidential residence == In 1998, the new constitutional president Engineer Carlos Roberto Flores Facuss\u00e9 was not satisfied with the building chosen by the ex president Rafael Leonardo Callejas Romero and decided to move the executive headquarters to a new building that was allocated for the Ministry of External Relations. The Palace Jos\u00e9 Cecilio of the Valley, originally built in 1988, designed by the architect Jorge Luciano Dur\u00f3n Bustillo, was chosen as the new executive headquarters. Since then, the following Honduran leaders have lived in this building: Carlos Roberto Flores Facuss\u00e9, Graduate Ricardo Rodolfo Maduro Joest, gentleman Jos\u00e9 Manuel Zelaya Rosales, the provisional government of the gentleman Roberto Michelleti Bain, the Graduate Porfirio Lobo Sosa, and the current leader of Honduras, Lawyer Juan Orlando Hern\u00e1ndez Alvarado. == Other presidential houses == * Between 1852 and 1853 under the presidency of the General Jos\u00e9 Trinidad Cabins the city of Santa Rosa of Cop\u00e1n becomes the provisional capital of Honduras, and the building of the \u201cNational House\u201d turns into presidential house. Later, in 1862 during the provisional presidency of entrepreneur Victoriano Castellanos Cortes, he chose two houses he owned and made them the headquarters of the Executive and Legislative branches. It was also the temporary capital in 1863 to repel the attack of the Guatemalan General Jos\u00e9 Rafael Career Turcios. * Between 1875 and 1876 in the city of Gracias, Lempira, the General Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Medina occupied a house of adobe with a wooden coffer ceiling and tile clay as its seat of government. == See also == The Presidential Palace, Tegucigalpa * Executive branch of the government of Honduras * President of Honduras * First Lady of Honduras == References == * Report dated in 23 September 2007.
