    "text": "Sharon Donna Mclvor (born October 9, 1948) is a leading Aboriginal women's rights activist, a member of the Lower Nicola Band and is a Thompson Indian. She challenged the government of Canada in a landmark case regarding sex-based discrimination among Indigenous women and children. == Brief summary == Sharon McIvor was born in Merritt, British Columbia, Canada. She identifies as a Lower Nicola Indian Band member and is recognized through her roles in advocacy, where she stresses the importance of Aboriginal Rights. She has been a strong supporter for missing and murdered Indigenous women, including children and has emphasized the importance of such societal issues by addressing the seriousness of this on-going battle. McIvor is also an advocate for NWAC, also referred to the Native Women\u2019s Association of Canada. She persistently challenged the government of Canada on numerous accounts regarding sex-based discrimination among Indigenous women and children. More specifically, she shed light on the issue of disenfranchisement and the difficulty it has when obtaining status for the offspring of couples who were victims of this form of identity loss. To expand, this consists of an Indigenous woman who marries a non-Indigenous man, resulting in a loss of status. When Sharon McIvor applied to obtain her status, and by extension of her children as well, she was denied due to the policies under the Indian Act. By being a representative of the Indigenous population who empowers her community through acts of kinship, the deconstruction of colonization and discrimination is prevalent in her attempts to remove sexist undertones from legislation in order to ensure gender equality. Continuing her path of perseverance by overcoming adversity that has been implemented by the government through restrictive and limited policies such as the Indian Act (Bill C-31), McIvor continues to address an array of concerns which inevitably results in deleterious effects for many generations of Indigenous people. Through Sharon's work she has been honoured by The Feminist Alliance for International Action as a member of the Indigenous Famous Six. Other members are Jeannette Corbiere-Lavell, Yvonne Bedard, Senator Sandra Lovelace Nicholas, Lynn Gehl, and Senator Lillian Eva Dyck. == Early life and education == McIvor was born and raised in Merritt, B.C, Canada. She studied at the University of Victoria and Queen's University where she has acquired two degrees, an LL.B. and LL.M. in 1987 and 1995. == Career == McIvor is currently employed by the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology in Merritt, British Columbia, which specializes in post-secondary education for those who identify as Indigenous. She has been contributing information to an array of departments within her workplace including the criminology department, Indigenous Academic Studies, and University transfers.

Spreading awareness of the colonialism that has impacted those who identify as Indigenous for so many years is imperative when rectifying policies and legislation that enforce effects in a discriminatory manner. == Marriage and family == Alex McIvor is the paternal side grandfather who is referred to be non-Indigenous.
