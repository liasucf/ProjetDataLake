    "text": "Sinatra & Jobim @ 50 is a latin jazz album by John Pizzarelli, released in 2017 with Concord Jazz. It's a tribute to the 1967 album Francis Albert Sinatra & Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim, released fifty years ago at the time of recording. It's also Pizzarelli's first foray into the genre since his 2004 album Bossa Nova. The album features Jobim's grandson Daniel Jobim on piano and vocals, whose parts were recorded in his native Brazil. Other backing vocals are provided by his wife Jessica Molaskey, and daughter Madeleine Pizzarelli. The tracks include Antonio's Song, a tribute to Jobim by Michael Franks whom Pizzarelli also cited as a hero of his. Also included are two new tracks written by Pizzarelli and Molaskey. ==Reception== Matt Collar of AllMusic rated it with the best of John Pizzarelli's albums to date, with 4.5 stars. He commented \"Sinatra & Jobim at 50 works as both an homage to two of Pizzarelli's biggest influences and a revealing showcase for his ever deepening musical palette,\" and that \"the album was an unexpected delight for fans.\" C. Michael Bailey summarised the album for All About Jazz as a \"quiet, breezy affair of lilting Brazilian rhythms and melodies played by a crack team of musicians.\" He commented \"singing and guitar playing are of the level we have come to expect of Pizzarelli, who has matured fully into this role of keeper of the flame for this flavor of jazz music.\" Will Friedwald of The Wall Street Journal ended his review saying the album \"succeed[ed] at maintaining a tricky balance: staying true to the [original] while, at the same time, creating something new and exciting out of music already considered classic. Christopher Louden wrote for the JazzTimes that \"Pizzarelli revisits the Sinatra-Jobim oeuvre with sublimely honorific results.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Performers=== * John Pizzarelliguitar (acoustic), guitar (electric), primary artist, vocals, vocals (background) * Daniel Jobimpiano, vocals * Harry Allensax (tenor) * H\u00e9lio Alvespiano * Duduka da Fonsecadrums, percussion * Mike Karndouble bass * Jessica Molaskeyvocals (background) * Madeleine Pizzarellivocals (background) ===Support=== * John Pizzarelliarranger, producer * Daniel Jobimarranger, engineer * Jessica Molaskeycomposer, producer * Irving Berlincomposer * Vin\u00edcius de Moraescomposer * Aloysio de Oliveiracomposer * George Forrestcomposer * Michael Frankscomposer * Ray Gilbertcomposer * Norman Gimbelcomposer * Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobimcomposer * Newton Mendon\u00e7acomposer * Manuel Mindlin Lafercomposer * Gene Leescomposer * Cole Portercomposer * Robert Wrightcomposer * Jacob Blickenstaffphotography * Joseph McCarthypackage design * Bill Mossengineer, mastering, mixing ==Notes== * Songs are listed in the language as they appear in the album's liner notes, but link to their Portuguese titles on Wikipedia where appropriate. * Some reviewers reference the album with the word \"at\" (see References) but the album cover and official sites use an ampersand. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2017 albums Category:John Pizzarelli albums Category:Latin jazz albums by American artists Category:Concord Records albums Category:Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Jobim tribute albums Category:Collaborative albums ",
