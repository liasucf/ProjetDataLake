Helios 2A was launched on December 18, 2004 by an Ariane 5 rocket from French Guiana. Helios 2B was launched five years later on December 18, 2009, carried also by an Ariane 5. The two satellites are identical. They carry a Thales-built high-resolution visible and thermal infrared instrument with 50 cm resolution, and an Airbus-built medium-resolution instrument. ==See also== * H\u00e9lios 1, the previous generation * CSO, the follow-on system ==References== https://helios.cnes.fr/en/helios-0 CNES webpage on Helios II B SpaceNews article on Helios II B ==External links== * Satellite Travels Into Orbit * France Launches Spy Satellite Category:Reconnaissance satellites of France Category:Satellites of Spain Category:Satellites of Italy Category:Spacecraft launched in 2004 Category:Spacecraft launched in 2009 Category:Spacecraft launched by Ariane rockets ",
