    "text": "Spectrum Sports was a regional sports network owned by Charter Communications that serves North and South Carolina. It was formerly known as Time Warner Cable Sports Net and was rebranded after Charter's acquisition of Time Warner Cable in May 2016. The network has three feeds serving Eastern North Carolina, Western North Carolina, and the Columbia/Myrtle Beach area of South Carolina. The network features non-gameday programming from the Carolina Panthers and local high school sports. In 2017, in an effort to reduce duplicity, Charter Communications closed down the Spectrum Sports outlets that shared markets with Spectrum News and merged them with their news counterparts. Spectrum Sports Carolinas' remaining programming was merged into Spectrum News North Carolina.
