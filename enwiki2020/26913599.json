The powers agreed that the Swedish Empire and Denmark\u2013Norway should settle for a peace treaty based on the Treaty of Roskilde,Frost (2004), p. 164 including free navigation through The SoundVan der Bijl (1995), p. 140. and the Baltic Sea based on the Treaty of Elbing.Rowen (2003), p. 88. The subsequent Dano-Swedish Peace of Copenhagen largely followed the terms dictated by the Concert of the Hague.Frijhoff & Spies (2004), p. 134; Van der Bijl (1995), p. 140. The concert was preceded by two Dutch interventions against Sweden in the Second Northern War, the first being the relief of Danzig (Gdansk) in 1656 that led to the treaty of Elbing, the second being the relief of Copenhagen in 1658. The thriving force behind the treaty was Dutch Johan De Witt, protecting Dutch interests in the Baltic Sea, and the concert agreed to have the Dutch fleet enact pressure to impose the envisioned peace terms on Denmark and Sweden. England likewise had trade interests in the Baltic Sea and was willing to protect them by force. De Witt's attempts to turn the concert into a formal alliance was only in part successful, as negotiations with France resulted in a Franco-Dutch alliance in 1662 which became important during the Second Anglo-Dutch War, but negotiations with England did not result in an alliance due to disagreements over the freedom of seas. ==Sources== ===References=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * Category:Second Northern War Category:Treaties of the Dutch Republic Category:Treaties of England Category:1659 treaties Category:Treaties of the Kingdom of France Category:1659 in the Dutch Republic Category:1659 in England Category:1659 in France Category:17th century in The Hague Category:Dutch Republic\u2013England relations Category:Dutch Republic\u2013France relations Category:England\u2013France relations ",
