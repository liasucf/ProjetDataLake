He was described by Billboard as \"legendary\", and the BBC as a \"CD pioneer\". ==Early life== Ramone was born in South Africa and grew up in Brooklyn, New York, USA. As a child in South Africa, Ramone was a musical prodigy, beginning to play the violin at age three and performing for Princess Elizabeth at age ten.
