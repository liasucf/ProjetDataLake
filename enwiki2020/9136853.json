Zainal Alireza's descendants separated their commercial activities into distinct (see Reza Investment Company, Rezayat, Xenel and Haji Hussein Alireza & Company) groups of which the original operates under the banner of Haji Abdullah Alireza & Company though is regionally known as Beit Alireza (translates in English to \"House of Alireza\") and is wholly owned by the descendants of the founder and continues to be a major shipping agent representing international companies such as Hapag-Lloyd, NYK, COSCO and the shipping lines of ExxonMobil. In the forefront of the Arabian pearling industry, the Alireza Group has been retailing and trading jewellery since in 1920s, and continue to do so in the modern day.
