The first ever manager of the team was Ljubi\u0161a Bro\u0107i\u0107 who guided Albania in the first international matches in 1946. Since then, 27 other managers have been in charge of Albania, with Gianni De Biasi being more successful, leading the team to their second ever UEFA European Championship participation in 2016 after the Euros in 1964.
