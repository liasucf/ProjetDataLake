The portmanteau stands for \"Mehrzweck-Kombination\" (English: multi- purpose-combination). It is a concept in modern naval shipbuilding based on modularity of armament, electronics and other equipment, aiming at ease of maintenance and cost reduction. MEKO ships include families of frigates, corvettes and ocean-going patrol boats. Construction of MEKO ships began in the late 1970s with the design and later building of Nigeria's MEKO 360 H1. Vessels of similar classes use different weapons systems. For example, for the main gun, some MEKO 200s use the Mk 45 Mod 2 gun, others use the French 100 mm naval gun or Otobreda 76 mm gun. The latest variant is the \"Combat Ship for the Littorals\" or MEKO CSL. It has also been called a \"Littoral Combatant Ship\", but it is much smaller than the American Littoral Combat Ship (LCS).Boustead Gets Letter Of Intent To Build Six Patrol Vessels Malaysian National News Agency ~ BERNAMA, 18 October 2010 There was speculation that this design would be of interest to Israel,Israeli Navy Wants Stealth Corvettes but it was not.MOD: No talks with Germany over sub Ultimately however, Israel opted for four modified K130 Braunschweig-class corvettes, the first of which is expected to enter service in 2019.

The construction of the vessels, which are more than 100 meters long, are planned for the Oceana shipyard in Itaja\u00ed. ==Vessels== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Type !!
