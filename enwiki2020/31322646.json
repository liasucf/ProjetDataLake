Tram 23 followed the same route, as well as tram 24 between Vanderkindere and Princesse Elisabeth/Prinses Elizabeth, where it deviated towards Schaarbeek railway station, 1 stop further. Together with tram lines 3, 4, 8 and 9, it is one of five 'chrono' lines, which means that this line is served by low-floor high- capacity trams with a high frequency. The low line number chosen for the new line shows that it is either a metro line or a chrono line. ==Timetabling== During the daytime, a tram passes every 7\u00bd minutes, rising to every 6 minutes during peak hours. == Rolling stock == The line is fully served by the Brussels low-floor trams (the T3000 and T4000). ==See also== *List of Brussels tram routes ==External links== * STIB/MIVB * Translated from: nl:Tramlijn 7 (Brussel) 07 Category:City of Brussels Category:Etterbeek Category:Ixelles Category:Schaerbeek Category:Uccle Category:Woluwe-Saint-Lambert Category:Woluwe-Saint-Pierre ",
