    "text": "The Serbian secret organization in eastern Bosnia () was a Serb secret revolutionary organization active in 1849\u201355 in the eastern Bosnia Eyalet\u2013the kaza of Srebrenica, Vi\u0161egrad, Rogatica and Nova Varo\u0161. It was part of a larger network of organizations active in Ottoman Europe (Rumelia), envisaged by Serbian politician Ilija Gara\u0161anin. The aim of the organization was to prepare an uprising against Ottoman rule. Pavle Marinovi\u0107 was responsible for eastern Bosnia, and was subordinated to Toma Kova\u010devi\u0107, Gara\u0161anin's man responsible for Bosnia as a whole. Marinovi\u0107 established the organization network in the four kazas in eastern Bosnia in the second half of 1849 and in 1850, and appointed chiefs of each kaza that reported on numbers of Orthodox and Muslim men, the relief, strategical objects and Ottoman military forces. It was concluded that half of the Serb population there were well-armed and ready to revolt. However, as Serbia did not pursue a war of liberation against the Ottomans, in 1851 the organization turned into an intelligence agency. The organization's failure was largely due to lack of funds. ==Members== The following were members whose names and duties are known: *Pavle Marinovi\u0107, organizer *Vuk Ne\u0161kovi\u0107, chief in Vi\u0161egrad kaza *Sava Jovi\u010di\u0107, chief in Vi\u0161egrad kaza, also duty in Nova Varo\u0161 *Filip Ravanac, chief in Srebrenica kaza *Petar Borov\u010dan, chief in Srebrenica kaza *Ilija Borov\u010dan, chief in Srebrenica kaza *Nikola, chief in Srebrenica kaza *Mihailo Soldat, chief in Srebrenica kaza *Marko, priest of Lipovac, chief in Vlasenica kaza *Ilija, priest of Glasinac, chief in Glasinac kaza ==See also== *Serb revolutionary organizations ==References== ==Sources== * * * Category:Serbian revolutionary organizations Category:Revolutionary organizations against the Ottoman Empire Category:Organizations established in 1849 Category:Organizations disestablished in the 1850s Category:1840s establishments in Serbia Category:Defunct organizations based in Serbia Category:19th century in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:History of the Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Serbs of the Ottoman Empire Category:Principality of Serbia Category:Secret societies in Serbia Category:Serbian nationalism in Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
