It was released as a digital download on 6 January 2017 as one of the double lead singles from his third studio album \u00f7 (2017), along with \"Castle on the Hill\". The dancehall-infused pop song was written by Ed Sheeran, Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid. Due to its interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" by TLC, Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs are also credited as writers. The song was produced by Sheeran and Mac. \"Shape of You\" peaked at number-one on the singles charts of 34 countries, including the US Billboard Hot 100 (later becoming the best performing song of 2017), as well as the UK, Australian and Canadian singles charts. It stayed at number one for a record-tying 16 consecutive weeks on the Canadian Hot 100, as well as 14 non-consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and 12 non-consecutive weeks on the Billboard Hot 100. On 10 December 2018, the song became the first song to hit 2 billion streams and the most streamed song on Spotify.

The song won the Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards.60th GRAMMY Awards: Full Nominees List Grammy.com, 28 November 2017 In 2018, Billboard ranked \"Shape of You\" as the ninth most successful song of all-time, as the magazine celebrated the Hot 100's 60th anniversary. ==Background and release== The song was the last song written for Sheeran's third album \u00f7. On 6 January 2017, when hosting The Radio 1 Breakfast Show, Sheeran revealed that \"Shape of You\" had originally been written with Rihanna in mind. As he had already written all the songs he wanted for the album, the song was therefore not intended to be included in the album. It was conceived as a duet between Rihanna and Rudimental, but the head of the record label convinced him to keep the song for himself. He said: > \"['Shape of You'] is actually a really random one because I went in to write > songs for other people with a guy called Steve Mac and Johnny McDaid, and we > were writing this song and I was like 'this would really work for Rihanna,'\" > he explained. \"And then I started singing lyrics like 'putting Van the Man > on the jukebox' and I was like 'well she's not really going to sing that, is > she?' And then we sort of decided halfway through that we were just going to > make it for me.\" According to Sheeran, Steve Mac started the songwriting session by playing the opening notes of the song on the keyboard. Sheeran then joined in, adding percussion by tapping on the guitar, layering it onto the track. On the writing of the song, he said that he tried to keep the music \"more stripped\" instead of something more elaborate: \"I'm an acoustic artist, first and foremost. And when I play live, I can't replicate these things, I haven't got all the other musicians.\" Sheeran said he wanted an R&B; feel to the song, therefore he adjusted the original tune, adding an interpolation of \"No Scrubs\" onto part of the melody. He also revealed that the original lyrics did not end with the words \"the shape of you\" in the chorus, but during the writing of the song, McDaid thought that the lyrics \"I'm in love with your body\" sounded objectifying, and the lyrics was therefore adjusted. On 4 January 2017, Sheeran uploaded a six-second teaser video of a blue background to social media, with lyrics \"the club isn't the best place to find a lover\", which is the first line of \"Shape of You\". To further tease the release, Sheeran and his label used a sponsored Snapchat lens filter with 30 seconds of the song to increase buzz among the general public. ==Composition== \"Shape of You\" is a pop, dancehall and tropical house song with \"strummy acoustics.\" In the song, Sheeran sings over a marimba-fueled percussive sway about a budding romance. \"The club isn't the best place to find a lover, so the bar is where I go/ Me and my friends at the table doing shots drinking fast and then we talk slow\", he sings. \"Come over and start up a conversation with just me/ And trust me I'll give it a chance.\" According to NT News, the song \"tells the story of loved (or lusted) up Sheeran meeting a girl in a bar where he and his mates are doing shots.\" \"Shape of You\" is written in the key of C minor with a tempo of 96 beats per minute. The song is composed in common time ( time), and follows a basic chord progression of Cm\u2013Fm\u2013A\u2013B (i\u2013iv\u2013VI\u2013VII), and Sheeran's vocals span from G2 to C5. The song's lyrical rhythm drew comparisons to the TLC song \"No Scrubs\", particularly in the pre-chorus line, \"Boy, let's not talk too much/ Grab on my waist and put that body on me.\" As a result, the composers of \"No Scrubs\", Kandi Burruss, Tameka \"Tiny\" Cottle, and Kevin \"She'kspere\" Briggs, were awarded co-writing credits on \"Shape of You\". The negotiations had started before the song's release but weren't finalized until afterwards. ==Critical reception== Jon Caramanica from The New York Times said, \"'Shape of You' is trickier, a nimble and effective song that takes the aggressive thinning of 'Caribbean music'.\" Billboards Taylor Weatherby wrote about the song saying, \"'Shape of You' doesn't quite sound like your typical Sheeran tune. But that almost serves as an indication of what the \"Thinking Out Loud\" singer has been up to during his hiatus: creating music that still feels like Sheeran, just with a new twist.\" Jeremy Gordon of Spin gave the song a positive review, stating that the song \"is a plausible attempt at convincing us he has had sex ... a lot of it. It kind of slaps, though you can't really picture Sheeran ever saying 'put that body on me' to a real human woman.\" News website Metro wrote that it sounds similar to the song \"Cheap Thrills\" by Sia. ==Commercial performance== \"Shape of You\" debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart on 13 January, selling 227,000 combined units in its first week. Sheeran also debuted at number 2 with the song \"Castle on the Hill\", making him the only artist in UK chart history to debut in the top two positions. \"Shape of You\" debuted at number two on the Scottish Singles Chart behind \"Castle on the Hill\".

It has stayed at number one for 13 consecutive weeks on the UK Singles Chart, and a further week at the top after a week's interruption by Harry Styles' \"Sign of the Times\". In July 2017, the song reached 184 million in streams, making it the most-streamed song in the UK of all time. It was the nation's highest selling and most streamed track of 2017 with 787,000 copies sold and 248 million streams throughout the year, to produce a combined sales of 3.2 million.
