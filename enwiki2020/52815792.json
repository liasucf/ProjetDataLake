    "text": "Stonecrest is a city in DeKalb County, Georgia, United States. The boundaries of the city generally lie in the far southeastern corner of the county, and a smaller portion just north of Interstate 20. The city borders the existing municipality of Lithonia, as well as Rockdale and Henry counties. Residents in the area voted in the November 2016 General Election to approve the city. In March 2017, elections were held to elect representatives for five city council districts as well as mayor. Jason Lary, a former insurance executive, concert promoter, and advocate of incorporation was elected the city's first mayor. The City Council members are District 1, Jimmy Clanton, District 2 Rob Turner, District 3 Jazzmin Cobble, District 4 George Turner and District 5 Tammy Grimes. Also the area is represented at the county level by District 5 Commissioner Mereda Davis-Johnson and Super District 7 Commissioner Lorraine Cochran- Johnson. The area is home to the Mall at Stonecrest, for which it is named, as well as the Davidson-Arabia Nature Preserve, Flat Rock Archives, and Arabia Mountain National Heritage Area. The city had voted a plan to deannex 345 acres of its territory so that the Georgia Legislature could create a new city, to be called Amazon, Georgia, if Stonecrest had been selected to host Amazon's new corporate headquarters, a project which would result in billions of dollars of investment and the creation of 50,000 jobs, a number equal to the estimated population of Stonecrest. ==Demographics== ==References== Category:Cities in Georgia (U.S. state) Category:Cities in DeKalb County, Georgia Category:Cities in the Atlanta metropolitan area Category:DeKalb County, Georgia Category:Populated places established in 2017 ",
