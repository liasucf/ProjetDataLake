He is primarily known for the Orientalist works he painted during the thirteen years he lived in Istanbul. == Biography == He was a student at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts de Lyon from 1844 to 1847, followed by studies in Paris with Hippolyte Flandrin. From 1857 to 1863, he regularly exhibited historical scenes and portraits at all the Parisian salons.Fran\u00e7ois Pouillon, Dictionnaire des orientalistes de langue fran\u00e7aise, \u00c9ditions Karthala, 2012 }} Until 1869, he made numerous copies of portraits of Napol\u00e9on III and the Empress Eug\u00e9nie for use in various government buildings throughout France. In 1860, together with , he created a full size copy of The Raft of the Medusa by Gericault. It was ordered by \u00c9milien de Nieuwerkerke, Manager of the Louvre, to be loaned for exhibitions, as the original had deteriorated to the point where it was too delicate to move.Roberta Smith, \"Art Review; Oui, Art Tips From Perfidious Albion\", in The New York Times Online In 1865, he went to Istanbul, at the request of Sultan Abdulaziz, an enthusiastic admirer of European arts and sciences, to paint his portrait in Western style. The Sultan was sufficiently pleased with it to name Guillemet the \"Palace Painter'. He brought his wife there in 1866, and would remain for the rest of his life. In 1873, he presented the paintings of \u015eeker Ahmed Pasha; the first exhibition of works by a Turkish artist. The following year, he opened a drawing and painting academy in Beyo\u011flu, the European quarter of Istanbul; becoming the first of its kind there. He and his wife gave lessons in Western-style painting; primarily watercolors and pastels. In 1876, his students exhibited their works for the first time. The school gained recognition from many European artists and had the personal support of Sultan Abdulaziz, who allowed Guillemet to paint the women of his harem. In 1877, he inaugurated the \"Imperial Art School\" (Mekteb-i Sanayi-i Chabane); serving as its Director. This served as the inspiration for the \"School of Fine Arts\" (', now known as the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University), which was founded by Osman Hamdi Bey in 1883. During the Russo-Turkish War, he died of typhoid fever; contracted while trying to assist the refugees and wounded who were pouring into Istanbul. He was interred in the Pangalt\u0131 Catholic Cemetery, in the Ferik\u00f6y district. == References == ==External links== Category:1827 births Category:1878 deaths Category:French painters Category:French orientalists Category:French portrait painters Category:French emigrants to the Ottoman Empire Category:People from Lyon Category:Deaths from typhoid fever ",
