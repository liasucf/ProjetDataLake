It is located in the present-day town of \u014ciso, located in Naka District, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. ==History== \u014ciso-juku was established in 1601, along with the other original post stations along the T\u014dkaid\u014d, by Tokugawa Ieyasu. In 1604, Ieyasu planted a colonnade of pine and hackberry trees, to provide shade for the travelers.T\u014dkaid\u014d. Oiso Town Hall. Accessed November 5, 2007. The classic ukiyo-e print by And\u014d Hiroshige (H\u014deid\u014d edition) from 1831\u20131834 depicts travelers in straw raincoats entering a village by the ocean during pouring rain. One is mounted, and the other is on foot. The road is lined with pine trees. By contrast, the Ky\u014dka edition of the late 1830s depicts a prosperous village overlooking a wide expanse of Sagami Bay with the mountains of the Izu Peninsula on the far shore. ==Neighboring post towns== ;T\u014dkaid\u014d :Hiratsuka-juku - \u014ciso-juku - Odawara-juku ==References== ==Further reading== *Carey, Patrick.
