However, while under the rule of Japanese imperialism, the missionaries stopped managing the whole school system due to Shinto worship being enforced by the Japanese rulers. Thus, the school remained closed by the end of the Second World War. After Korea gained its independence from Japan in 1945, the school moved from Sunan and joined with the church headquarters Hoegi, Seoul; The move was completed in 1949. On the June 25, 1950, the Korean War forced the school to close again. After Seoul was won back in November 1951, the school was relocated to its current location at Gongdeok, Yangjoo, Gyeonggi (later renamed Seoul) and reopened. The school was also renamed Sahmyook College, and the minister James Lee was inaugurated as the first president. ==Applications== Each January over 10,000 students apply at Sahmyook University.
