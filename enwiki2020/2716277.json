He was educated at Selwyn College, Cambridge, where he received an Open Scholarship. ==Early life== Norman was educated at Chatham House Grammar School, Ramsgate, Kent, and the Monoux School Walthamstow. He went up to Selwyn College, Cambridge on an Open Scholarship.Who's Who among Old Monovians [pub 1966] p.90 ==Career== Norman lectured in history at the University of Cambridge for many years. He was a Fellow of Selwyn College (from 1962 to 1964) before moving to Jesus College, Cambridge to take up a similar position. Today, he is an emeritus Fellow of Peterhouse, Cambridge.Memorial services - Times Online He was Dean of Peterhouse for 17 years and then Dean and Chaplain at Christ Church College, Canterbury. He was also Professor of History at the University of York. He is a member of the conservative-leaning Peterhouse school of history and was associated with the influential Cambridge Right, along with Roger Scruton and Maurice Cowling. On 7 October 2012, he was received into the Catholic Church by way of the Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of Walsingham. Norman was the BBC Reith Lecturer in 1978. For his series of six radio lectures, titled \"Christianity and the World\", he discussed the relationship between religion and politics. Margaret Thatcher once invited him to Chequers, although Norman insists he is not a Thatcherite and says he is \"appalled by the results of naked capitalism\". Norman's book Church and Society in Modern England, published a year after Thatcher's election as Conservative leader, argued that Christianity and Conservatism were natural allies based on the moral superiority of the free market. The free market, Norman argued, left the individual responsible for their choices rather than dependent on state welfare, which rendered people \"moral cripples\". Thatcher exclaimed: \"Dr Norman, you are a prophet\".John Campbell, Margaret Thatcher.
