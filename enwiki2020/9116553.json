Printz Award Honor book. This book also won the Lambda Literary Award. *What's In a Name (2000), Massachusetts Book Award *Gracie's Girl (2000) *Razzle (2001) *The Long Night of Leo and Bree (2002) - \"Although the characters sometimes slip into preaching about women\u2019s rights and men\u2019s feelings, this slim volume packs a punch. Wittlinger (Razzle, 2001, etc.)\u2014always tops at hard-hitting, realistic fiction\u2014delivers another story of teenagers\u2019 self-discovery in a difficult world.\" *ZigZag (2003) - \"Disappointingly conventional fare from the author of Hard Love; still, touched with Wittlinger\u2019s trademark class-consciousness, well-written, and emotionally powerful.\" *Heart on My Sleeve (2004) - \"This modern epistolary tale (emails and IMs joining handwritten letters and postcards) is voyeuristically enjoyable. A successful use of multiple viewpoints and an interesting exploration of the implied intimacy of various forms of non-verbal communication.\" *Sandpiper (2005) *Blind Faith (2006) - \"An issue-driven story overtly strives for a message and debate on how to define God. But the presentation is often heavy-handed; the subtleties come toward the end\u2014again at the behest of Liz. Lots of grief, little humor and a character who is so stable that readers might be surprised to realize she\u2019s a character who defines for a new age the concept of \u201chero.\u201d\" *Parrotfish (2007) - Lambda Literary Award Nominee. \\- \"Artistically bland, but direct and respectful. Given the rarity of transgender characters, a vital and necessary purchase for any YA collection.\" *Love & Lies: Marisol's Story (2008) - \"A rich and solid representation of a girl on the cusp of maturity.\" *This Means War! (2010) - \"The characters are solid and believable, while the dialogue is fresh, poignant and funny. Will appeal to fans of Phyllis Reynolds Naylor\u2019s The Boys Start the War (1993) and The Girls Get Even (1994). \" *\"Local Girl Swept Away\" (2016) ==See also== * Phyllis Reynolds Naylor == References == ==External links== * Author's website * Short biography on the author's website Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Iowa Writers' Workshop alumni Category:American writers of young adult literature Category:Lambda Literary Award for Children's and Young Adult Literature winners Category:American women novelists Category:Women writers of young adult literature Category:20th-century American novelists Category:20th- century American women writers ",
