Falgui\u00e8re's first bronze statue of importance was Le Vainqueur au Combat de Coqs (Victor of the Cockfight) (1864), and Tarcisius the Christian Boy- Martyr followed in 1867; both were exhibited in the Luxembourg Museum and are now in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. His more important monuments are those to Admiral Courbet (1890) at Abbeville and the famous Joan of Arc. Other works include Eve (1880), Diana (1882 and 1891), Woman and Peacock (a. k. a. Juno and The Peacock), and The Poet, astride his Pegasus spreading wings for flight. He sculpted The Dancer, based on Cl\u00e9o de M\u00e9rode which today is also in the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay. In 1870 he helped create the snow sculpture, La statue de la R\u00e9sistance. To these works should be added his monuments to Cardinal Lavigerie and to General de La Fayette (in Washington, DC), and his statues of Alphonse de Lamartine (1876) and St Vincent de Paul (1879), as well as the Honor\u00e9 de Balzac, which he executed for the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des gens de lettres on their rejection of that by Auguste Rodin; and the busts of Carolus-Duran and Ernest Alexandre Honor\u00e9 Coquelin (1896). Falgui\u00e8re was a painter as well as a sculptor. His Wrestlers (1875) and Fan and Dagger (1882; a defiant Spanish woman) were in the Luxembourg, and other pictures of importance are The Beheading of St John the Baptist (1877), The Sphinx (1883), Acis and Galatea (1885), Old Woman and Child (1886) and In the Bull Slaughter-House. Falgui\u00e8re also taught; among his students were Francis Edwin Elwell, Ernest Henri Dubois, Julien Causs\u00e9, Laurent Marqueste, Henri Crenier and Th\u00e9ophile Barrau. Falgui\u00e8re became a member of the Institut de France (Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts) in 1882.
