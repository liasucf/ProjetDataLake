    "text": "\"Hey! Little Girl\" is a song by the American musician Del Shannon. It was recorded in October 1961 and was released later that year. In the lyrics, the narrator professes his love to a girl that he only barely knows. The girl has recently been dumped by her boyfriend, but the narrator proposes to begin a relationship with her and thus make her feel better. As such, the song is more optimistic than some of Shannon's other songs, such as \"Runaway\" and \"Keep Searchin' (We'll Follow the Sun)\". The background music involves both string and brass instruments. \"Hey! Little Girl\" reached No. 38 in the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, but was a much bigger hit in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 2. ==References== Category:1961 singles Category:Del Shannon songs Category:1961 songs Category:Song articles with missing songwriters ",
