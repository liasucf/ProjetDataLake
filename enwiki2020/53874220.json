He made his earliest ATP Tour main draw appearances in 1996, the first at the Swiss Open Gstaad where he lost to Karim Alami in the opening round, then at the Romanian Open in Bucharest, competing in both the singles and doubles. In Bucharest he faced another Moroccan Hicham Arazi in the first round, but this time came out on top, before losing in the second round to Carlos Moy\u00e1. As a doubles player he played at Gstaad again in 1997, partnering Dominik Hrbat\u00fd. A regular on the Challenger circuit, he had a win over Franco Squillari, then 47 in the world, at the 1998 Sao Paulo tournament. His only Challenger title came in doubles, in Quito in the 1999 season. He played as a qualifier in the main draw of the 1999 Gold Flake Open, an ATP Tour tournament held in Chennai. In 1999 he featured in the qualifying events of all four Grand Slam tournaments. Now based in Israel, Zingman is a head coach at the David Squad, a non-profit school recognised as the top independent tennis academy in the country. ==Challenger titles== ===Doubles: (1)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:20px\" class=\"unsortable\"|No. !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:220px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Partner !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |1. |1999 |Quito, Ecuador |Clay | Paulo Taicher | \u00d3scar Ortiz Marco Osorio |7\u20135, 4\u20136, 7\u20135 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1974 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine male tennis players Category:Argentine tennis coaches Category:Tennis players from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Israel ",
