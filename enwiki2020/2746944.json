He also completed an MSc in Social Policy from Cranfield University and an external degree in Law from the University of London. He later became Chief Constable of Cleveland police and in 1993 became Chief Constable of West Yorkshire Police. He has strong views on terrorists, child murderers and police murderers, believing all should face the death penalty. He spent 36 years in the police. He was the New Labour government's drugs advisor and so- called \"drugs czar\" from January 1998. He resigned from his position in July 2002 over the government's reclassification of cannabis from a Class B to a Class C substance.

Use of all drugs increased as did drugs deaths in his four years in office. In November 2002 HarperCollins published his autobiography called The Outsider: The Autobiography of One of Britain's Most Controversial Policemen. It was serialised in the Mail on Sunday. Two former detectives, Roy Smith and Laurence Andrews, took objection to the book which claimed they had conspired to pervert the course of justice when investigating a murder in 1968 in Aspley.

Sports Direct's founder and Executive Deputy chairman \u2013 Mike Ashley \u2013 was criticised by the tribunal for 'disgraceful and unlawful employment practices'. In September 2015, Hellawell faced pressure to remove him as Chairman of the company by minority shareholders.
