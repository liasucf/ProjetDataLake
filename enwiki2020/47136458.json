    "text": "The Iranian Mosque (also known as the Imam Hussein Mosque) located in Satwa, Dubai, is a Shia mosque founded by the Iranian community. It is located on Al Wasl Road, a short distance from the Jumeirah Mosque. Its architecture is inspired by quasi-Fatimid and Persian influences, with its facade and dome covered in traditional blue tiles, much like the exterior of the Iranian Hospital across the road. The mosque sprawls over an area of 2,500 square metres and was built in 1979 with the support of the Iranian Red Crescent. It contains several interior halls and rooms, and has a library with over 14,000 books of diverse topics and languages including Arabic, Persian, Urdu and English. The Sheikh Mohammed Centre for Cultural Understanding runs four weekly tours of the mosque, during which non-Muslims visitors can visit. ==See also== * Iranian Mosque, Bur Dubai * Shia Islam in the United Arab Emirates * List of mosques in the United Arab Emirates ==References== Category:1979 establishments in the United Arab Emirates Category:Iranian diaspora in the United Arab Emirates Category:Mosques in Dubai Category:Mosques completed in 1979 Category:Shia Islam in the United Arab Emirates Category:Shia mosques in the United Arab Emirates ",
