    "text": "Roger Doucet, (21 April 1919 \u2013 19 July 1981) was a Canadian tenor best known for singing the Canadian national anthem, \"O Canada\", on televised games of the Montreal Canadiens, Montreal Alouettes, and Montreal Expos during the 1970s. He was particularly known for his bilingual version of the anthem, which began in French and ended in English, in recognition of the two languages of Canada. ==Career== Doucet's first performance of the national anthem at a Canadiens game was on 13 October 1970. Author Andrew Podnieks noted that Doucet \"belted the anthem with an enthusiasm that energized the crowd as much as any Lafleur slapper or Robinson hip check.\" During the inaugural Canada Cup tournament, Doucet was scheduled to sing the national anthems at a game between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union on 3 September 1976. However, the lyrics for \"Hymn of the Soviet Union\" were omitted since the mid-1950s due to their Stalinist content. Doucet consulted with the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al's Russian department staff who provided a modified anthem to sing at the game. These lyrics were approved by the Soviet Union the following year for use in its national anthem. Doucet also changed the way Canadians sing their anthem. Before Doucet, the final \"we stand on guard for Thee\" was universally sung the way it was written: fa-mi-re-soh-ti-doh, with the 'ti' and the 'doh' falling. Doucet sang the final 'ti-doh' by raising these notes an octave above their traditional pitch. The audience of CBC's Hockey Night in Canada was so vast, and his rendition so powerful, that within a few years Doucet's version became\u2014and remains\u2014the accepted way to conclude O Canada. In 1980, he was made a Member of the Order of Canada, Canada's highest civilian honour, \"in recognition for the feeling of pride he has instilled in his fellow citizens\".Order of Canada citation Roger Doucet died in Montreal on 19 July 1981 after sustaining a brain tumour. ==Legacy== American sportswriter Paul Zimmerman (Dr. Z) remembered as a highlight of his coverage of Canadiens games that Doucet \"[b]rought the house down. I mean, people would cry when he finished that song. And it never ran longer than 47 or 48 seconds.\" ==References== ==External links== * Roger Doucet at The Canadian Encyclopedia * Roger Doucet tribute at NHL Network * May 1979 performance of US and Canadian anthems by Roger Doucet in the Montreal Forum Category:1919 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Deaths from brain tumor Category:Canadian operatic tenors Category:Members of the Order of Canada Category:Musicians from Montreal Category:Deaths from cancer in Quebec Category:20th-century Canadian singers Category:20th-century opera singers Category:20th-century male singers ",
