There are several different origins for the surname McLean/MacLean, however, the clan surname is an Anglicisation of the Scottish Gaelic MacGilleEathain. This was the patronymic form of the personal name meaning \"servant of (Saint) John\" or the \"son of the servant of Saint John\". The family grew very powerful throughout the Hebrides and Highlands through alliances with the Catholic Church in the 9th century, the MacDonalds in the 13th century, the MacKays and MacLeods in the 16th century. Many early MacLeans became famous for their honour, strength and courage in battle. == McLean == * Aaron McLean, English professional footballer * Adam McLean, authority on alchemical texts and symbolism * Agnes McLean (1918\u20131994), Scottish trade unionist and politician * A.
