Thomas, et al., Frank Furness: The Complete Works, (New York: Princeton Architectural Press, revised 1996), pp. 284\u201386. Designed by architect Frank Furness and completed in 1888, it was Edward Brooke II's wedding present to his bride, Anne Louise Clingan.Janet W. Foster, \"Edward Brooke House, Birdsboro, Pennsylvania,\" The Queen Anne House: America's Victorian Vernacular, (New York: Abrams, 2006, pp. 56\u201365). Five years later, Edward II himself designed a major addition to the mansion.George M. Meiser and Gloria Jean Meiser, \"The Birdsboro Mansion of Edward and Anne Brooke,\" The Passing Scene, Volume 13, (Reading, PA: Historical Society of Berks County, 2005), pp. 224\u201339. Following their parents' deaths, the Brooke children sold the property in the 1940s. The mansion served as a nursing home for thirty years, and recently as a bed and breakfast. The property spent fourteen years on and off the real estate market, before being sold at auction on September 29, 2018, for $572,000.Tony Phyrillas, \"Brooke Mansion sold for $572,000,\" The Mercury, September 30, 2018. ==Brooke family== Birdsboro was named for ironmaker William Bird, who established a forge near the mouth of Hay Creek, about 1740.Birdsboro Steel Foundry and Machine Company employee records, from University of Pennsylvania Archives. In 1771, his son Marcus founded Hopewell Furnace, on Hay Creek about five miles upstream. By the time of the Revolutionary War, Marcus Bird was the largest American producer of iron. He cast iron cannon, shot and shell for the Continental Army, and served in the Pennsylvania Militia.Hopewell Furnace in the American Revolution, from National Park Service. In the post-war depression he lost both forges to creditors in 1788. The creditors hired John Louis Barde to operate the forges, and Barde purchased the Birdsboro forge in 1796. He hired Matthew Brooke III to assist him, and after Barde's 1799 death Matthew continued to operate the forges for Barde's widow. In 1800, Matthew's father and uncles formed Brooke & Buckley and bought the Hopewell forge, with Matthew's brother Clement in charge. In 1805, at age 43, Matthew married Barde's 17-year-old daughter Elizabeth.George Norbury Mackenzie, Colonial Families of the United States of America, Volume 6, (Baltimore: The Seaforth Press, 1917), p. 102. Matthew and Elizabeth Brooke had five children, three of whom lived to adulthood: Edward (1816\u20131878); George (1818\u20131912); and Elizabeth Mary (1825\u20131870). Matthew died in 1827 and Elizabeth in 1828, leaving their orphaned children under the guardianship of Matthew's brother Clement. The Birdsboro forge was leased out to Brooke & Buckley until Edward and George attained their majorities. The Schuylkill Canal (completed 1825) passed through Birdsboro and, prior to railroads, was the primary means of transporting anthracite coal to Philadelphia and elsewhere. The young brothers took charge of the business in 1837, and diversified its holdings. They modernized the furnaces to run on anthracite (instead of charcoal), expanded their businesses, and consolidated them in 1867 as the Birdsboro Iron Forge Company. The Reading Railroad and the Pennsylvania Railroad both built lines through Birdsboro. The Brookes were behind the building of the Wilmington & Northern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Reading Company, that connected to their iron ore mines, and continued south to Wilmington, Delaware.Morton L. Montgomery, History of Berks County in Pennsylvania (Philadelphia: Everts, Peck & Richards, 1886), p. 895. Edward served as the railroad's first president. After their sister's 1870 death, the brothers bought out her interest and split the company into two entities \u2013 the E. & G. Brooke Land Company (coal and iron ore mines) and the E. & G. Brooke Iron Company (iron and steel manufacture). The E. & G. Brooke Iron Company became Birdsboro Steel in 1905.G. Clymer Brooke, Birdsboro: Company with a Past, Built to Last, (New York: Newcomen Society in North America, 1959). Both Brooke brothers were keenly interested in architecture, and were clients of Frank Furness. Edward built a Greek Revival mansion, \"Brooke Manor\" (1844, demolished 1968) on a hill overlooking the town. In the mid-1870s, he hired Furness to modernize and expand it.Brooke Manor House, from HABS. George designed and oversaw construction of St. Michael's Episcopal Church, in the early 1850s. Twenty years later, he did the same for its Sunday school building (1872\u201373), which he and his brother donated. George designed his own Second Empire mansion, \"Brookewood\" (1860, burned 1917), and its many additions. After Edward's 1878 death, George selected Furness to design a major expansion of St. Michael's Church, 1884\u201385. This included the addition of transepts, a chancel and choir, a bell tower, and new church furniture (possibly executed by Daniel Pabst). George again oversaw the project, and he and his family paid for the expansion. The east transept was altered in 1887 for the installation of a Tiffany window,Edward Brooke Memorial Window, from Alarmy. a memorial to Edward from his widow, Annie Moore Clymer Brooke. ===Edward Brooke II=== Panoramic view of Birdsboro, 1890. George Brooke married Mary Baldwin Irwin in 1862. They had two sons, Edward II (1863\u20131940), named for George's brother; and George Jr. (1867\u20131953). The boys grew up in Philadelphia and Birdsboro, and were educated by private tutors. The family had a Philadelphia city house at 924 Walnut Street, and the sons attended the nearby Delancey School. Edward II graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in 1886, and joined his father's iron and steel business. In an October 12, 1887 wedding at St. Michael's Church, Edward II married his second cousin, Anne Louise Clingan. The groom gave the bride the not-quite-finished house as a wedding present: > He is now engaged in building a magnificent mansion at a high elevation > overlooking Birdsboro and the entire Schuylkill valley. He and his bride > left on an extensive wedding tour to New York and the New England states. > Upon their return they will reside with his father until their residence is > completed, which will be some time in November.\"Brooke\u2013Clingan; Largely > Attended Wedding Near Birdsboro.\" The Reading Eagle, October 12, 1887, p. 1.

He served as president of the Pennsylvania Trust Company of Reading and the First National Bank of Birdsboro, and as a director of the Wilmington & Northern Railroad. ==Furness== About the time of Edward Brooke II's 1886 graduation, the University of Pennsylvania was contemplating building a fireproof library in which it could gather its collections in a single building. Frank Furness's brother Horace was chosen to head the building committee, and the architect began drawing up detailed plans even before the project was officially announced. The committee hired Furness to advise them, and later chose him to be the library's architect. Furness's earliest known drawing (1887) shows a plan and a massing of volumes close to the library as built\u2014a stair tower separating vertical circulation from the reading room and stacks; a building featuring an apsidal north end with an arc of seminar rooms clustered around the base of the apse (like side chapels of a basilica).George E. Thomas, Frank Furness: Architecture in the Age of the Great Machines, (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2018). When the university changed the library's proposed site from 36th & Spruce Streets to 34th & Locust Streets, Furness essentially redrew the plan as a mirror image. Furness used a similar plan and massing for his own country house, \"Idlewild,\" with a U-shaped wrap-around porch taking the place of the arc of seminar rooms. As noted by architectural historian James F. O'Gorman: \"For his own house in Media, [Furness] shrank the plan of the contemporary University Library, and erected over it a stone, brick, and shingle house.\"James F. O'Gorman, The Architecture of Frank Furness, (Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1973), p. 64. Furness used a similar plan and massing for the eastern half of Edward Brooke II's house, although the addition of a conical roof turned its apse into a tower.East fa\u00e7ade, from brookemansion.com File:LOC 15575v.jpg|Preliminary plan for the University of Pennsylvania Library (1887) File:University of Pennsylvania Library 1904 Detroit Publishing Co.jpg|University of Pennsylvania Library (1888-90) File:Idlewild Media PA back side.JPG|\"Idlewild\" (1888), Media, Pennsylvania File:East facade Brooke Mansion 7July2017.jpg|Brooke Mansion (1887-88), east facade ===Exterior=== Furness designed the front (north) fa\u00e7ade of Brooke's house with two projecting bays\u2014an eastern semicircular apse/tower with a J-shaped wrap-around porch, and a western two-and-a-half-story gabled bay. The exterior's whole first story was faced in brownstone block, and its upper stories were clad in wood shingles. The porch's roof was carried on pyramidical brownstone-block piers with \"eared\" corbels. The formal entrance was between the projecting bays (from the porch) through a pair of doors with intricately-patterned inset leaded-glass windows, sidelights and a semi-oval fanlight. The carriage entrance was on the porch's east side, and featured a porte-coch\u00e8re and steps leading to a side door with an inset beveled-glass window guarded by an intricate wrought iron grille.Porch and side door, from oldhouses.com Toward the south end, twin sets of French doors opened onto the porch. The house's eastern half featured a shingled Mansard roof with shed-roofed dormers on three sides, two of them enclosing four windows each. The tower featured twin paired windows on the second and third stories, the upper ones enclosed by conical-roofed dormers. The tower's conical roof and the conical-roofed dormers were crowned by (copper?) finials (now weathered to verdigris). Between the projecting bays, the second story was clad in brownstone, with a large lunette window over the front doors. The house's original western (now center) projecting bay featured large twin windows on the first story, and paired windows on the second and third stories. Its shingled front and sides curved outward in a skirt, and were carried on paired brownstone corbels. As a decorative effect, the shingles under its gable were cut to form concentric arcs. The house featured Furness's characteristic \"upside-down\" brick chimneys, that flared outward near the top.Ellen Zeiper, \"Frank Furness: An Eclectic Architect's Chimney Designs,\" American Art & Antiques, vol. 1, no. 3 (November\u2013December 1978), pp. 62\u201369. Through massing, architectural elements and variated windows, Furness expressed the house's interior spaces on its exterior.

Opposite the library entrance was the hall's canted, floor-to-ceiling sandstone-and-oak chimneypiece. To the south was a long billiard room, with a carved-oak chimneypiece and twin French doors opening onto the porch. To the west (in the front) was the parlor, with a gray granite arched fireplace and Colonial Revival butternut overmantel.Parlor, from brookemansion.com To the west (in the rear), was the baronial dining room, with an iron shingle-roofed Modern Gothic mantel,Dining room, from brookemansion.com reportedly cast at the family's foundry. The hall, billiard room, and dining room were paneled in coffered oak wainscoting, and their ceilings were circumscribed by oak beams, each in a different pattern. The beams of the round library's ceiling formed a compass rose. The grand stairway climbed along the hall's south wall, turned left to form a gallery over the carriage entrance, and turned again along the north wall before reaching the second floor. The hall was lighted by a row of four tall windows above the gallery, that also lighted the upper hall.Stairway, from alllehighvalleyhomes.com The second floor followed a similar plan as the first, with four large bedrooms opening onto an extended upper hall. A dressing room between each pair of bedrooms allowed for discrete access by servants. The third floor featured a central lobby, illuminated by a large frosted-glass skylight and surrounded by seven rooms. These included a round nursery (in the tower), a long southeast bedroom (with dressing room), servant rooms, and storage. One of the house's ingenious features was the windowless back staircase, that climbed from the basement kitchen to the third floor. Light from the skylight in the roof was able to reach the basement level. The back staircase \"permit[ted] servants access to various sections of the house without having to pass through formal rooms.\" Mrs. Brooke loved flowers, and the house was decorated with examples in wood, stone, glass and iron. The leaded glass panels of the front doors, sidelights and fanlight were crowded with stylized plant forms.Front doors, from brookemansion.com The screen between the vestibule and hall featured seven wrought iron window grilles in the form of abstracted sunflowers.Vestibule, from oldhouses.com The hall chimneypiece featured an arched panel of carved-sandstone flowers above the firebox, oak corbels carved with oversized dahlias supporting the mantel shelf, and an oak frieze of abstracted flowers crowning the whole.Chimneypiece, from alllehighvalleyhomes The newel post was carved with a plump oak floral garland, which was echoed in miniature elsewhere in the hall.Newel post, from alllehighvalleyHomes.com The billiard room chimneypiece featured a frieze of hibiscus carved in sandstone flanked by oversized garlands carved in oak.Billiard room fireplace & overmantel, from lisatigerhomes.com Carved vines intertwined though the rough-cut granite of the parlor fireplace, and flowers and garlands accented the butternut overmantel above it.

The contractor was Levi H. Focht, who had constructed the house five years earlier, and had constructed Furness's additions to St. Michael's Church nine years earlier. Acting as his own architect, Edward II added a third projecting bay to the front fa\u00e7ade, turning the original western bay into a center bay and connecting all three bays with a wide terrace. The addition brought the kitchen out of the basement, and added a second set of back stairs and a rope-pulled elevator, operated using counterweights (like a dumbwaiter). \"[T]he western section was constructed for food preparation, general storage, servant's quarters, and the like.\" The expansion had minor effects on the first floor formal rooms\u2014the parlor's box window became a short hallway to the new addition; the old butler's pantry became a study (off the billiard room); and two of the dining room's doorways (and perhaps the double window) were moved. It had a larger effect on the second floor\u2014three of the four bedrooms were cut down in size: two to install bathrooms, and the third for a hallway to the new addition. On the exterior, the alterations required the moving of existing windows and the installation of new windows for the bathrooms. Through the expansion Edward II's large house became a mansion of nearly 14,000 square feet.301 Washington St, Birdsboro, PA, from Zillow. The 1890 Census listed five live-in servants in the household, but the number increased following the 1893 expansion. The mansion was illuminated by gaslight until the installation of electricity in 1896. Telephone service arrived in 1904. ===Carriage house=== Edward II's passion was horses, both racehorses and carriage horses.Matt Romanski, \"Brooke Mansion Is a Monument to Bygone Era,\" The Reading Eagle, December 24, 1978, pp. 12\u201313. He kept a stable of twelve, and exercised them on a racetrack at the top of the hill. He was a founding member of the Philadelphia Four-in-Hand Club, organized by Fairman Rogers in 1890,Fairman Rogers, Manual of Coaching (Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott Company, 1900), p. 511. and competed in the annual 3-day carriage marathon from New York City to Philadelphia. In 1898, Edward II designed and built an enormous 2-story carriage house (with elevator) southwest of the mansion.\"Elegant Stable to be erected by Edward Brooke,\" The Reading Eagle, October 8, 1898, p. 2. His collection grew to twenty-four carriages, and included \"buggies, surreys, broughams, a pony cart and an Irish jaunting cart in which a person had to sit sideways.\" \"After a particular vehicle had been used, it was brought into the carriage house, thoroughly cleaned and then taken to the second floor on a hand-operated lift to be readied for the next ride.\" Most of the carriages were sold to the National Park Service in 1941. The carriage house burned in the 1970s. The short hallway between the mansion's hall and dining room featured a special closet for Edward II's top hat, whip and tack. Coaching paintings and prints and equestrian bronzes decorated many of the rooms. ==20th century== Detail of the 1890 panoramic view of Birdsboro. \"Brookewood,\" George Brooke's mansion and stables are left, Edward Brooke II's mansion (prior to its 1893 expansion) is right. George Brooke's mansion, \"Brookewood,\" and his son Edward II's mansion, \"Brookeholm,\" stood side by side on the hill sharing a 34-acre estate. George Brooke died at 93, on January 15, 1912, two years after his wife. He bequeathed his half-share in all the Birdsboro companies to his two sons, and \"Brookewood\" to George Jr. Following George Jr.'s 1914 marriage to Titanic survivor Lucile Carter, the newlyweds and Carter's two children from her previous marriage split their time between his family's Philadelphia city house, her house in Bryn Mawr, and \"Brookewood.\" George and Lucile Brooke had one child together, the flamboyant Elizabeth Muhlenberg Brooke (1916\u20132016).\"Elizabeth Muhlenberg \"Betty\" Brooke Blake,\" from Find-A-Grave. The family was in Birdsboro for Christmas, 1917, when \"Brookewood\" burned, \"the result of Christmas tree candles igniting nearby curtains.\" \"Firemen were unable to save the house because it was so cold that the source of water supply was frozen.\" The couple bought \"Clingan,\" just west of Birdsboro, that had been the home of sister-in-law Anne Louise Clingan Brooke's family.\"Historical society hopes to stall plan to demolish mansion,\" The Reading Eagle, June 13, 2005.

George Jr. survived her by 19 years, living in a suite at Philadelphia's Barclay Hotel on Rittenhouse Square, or at \"Clingan.\"\"George Brooke, Retired Iron Merchant,\" The Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, August 14, 1953. Following his parents' deaths, Edward II inherited Joseph Wright's 1790 Portrait of Frederick Augustus Conrad Muhlenberg, the first Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and a great-great-grandfather on his mother's side.Henrietta Meier Oakley and J. C. Schwab, The Muhlenberg Album, (New Haven, CT: Tuttle Press, 1910). Edward II made the portrait the centerpiece of his mansion's parlor. George Jr. inherited the pendant portrait of the Speaker's wife, Catharine Schaeffer Muhlenberg. The Frederick Muhlenberg portrait is now in the collection of the National Portrait Gallery. Anne Louise Clingan Brooke died of pneumonia, September 5, 1935.\"Mrs. Edward Brooke Dies at Age of 71,\" The Reading Eagle, September 6, 1935, p. 1. A month earlier, she had sold 3,780 acres of land (5.9 square miles) \u2013 inherited from her maternal grandfather, Clement Brooke \u2013 to the federal government. This became Hopewell Furnace National Historic Site and part of Hopewell Big Woods. In her will, she bequeathed \"Brookeholm\" to her husband\u2014it had been his wedding present to her 48 years earlier. Her obituary listed sons George III and Charles living at home, and Edward Jr. (now married) living in a house on the estate.

Aided by her sister-in-law, also an RN, Spanier operated the facility for thirty years. Conversion into a nursing home did not affect the first floor formal rooms, but interior alterations were made to the second and third floors. Spanier put the mansion on the market in 1978 for $500,000. The mansion was purchased by a group of five partners, who planned a housing development for the property. They subdivided the former estate, leaving the mansion on a 3-acre lot, and obtained a variance rezoning the mansion as a commercial property.\"Birdsboro Conversion Opposed,\" The Reading Eagle, November 13, 1990, p. 24. > The former Brooke Mansion in Birdsboro, believed to be one of the largest > residences ever constructed in Berks County, will become the center of the > Mansion Heights development being marketed by Park Road Realtors.
