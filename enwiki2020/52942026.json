    "text": "Persephone Borrow (n\u00e9e Tough)The Cambridge University: List of Members up to 31 July 1996 (Cambridge University Press, 1996), p. 96 is a viral immunologist specialising in T-cell responses in acute and early HIV-1 infections. She has been at the University of Oxford since 2005 and in 2016 was made a professor there. == Life == The daughter of scientists, Borrow completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in Natural Science at the University of Cambridge in 1985; the university awarded her a doctorate four years later, which involved studying chronic viral infection in mice relating to demyelination. She then worked as a postdoctoral research assistant to Michael Oldstone at The Scripps Research Institute. She received five years of funding from the National Institutes of Health to carry out her own research relating to HIV and then, in 1995, became an Assistant Professor at the Scripps Research Institute, but two years later joined the Edward Jenner Institute as the leader of the Viral Immunology Group. She joined the Nuffield Department of Medicine at the University of Oxford in 2005.\"Persephone Borrow, PhD\", Virology Education. Retrieved 21 January 2017.\"Persephone Borrow\", Women in Science. University of Oxford. Retrieved 21 January 2017. In 2016 the University awarded her with the title of Professor of Viral Immunology.\"Recognition of Distinction: Successful Applicants 2016\", The University of Oxford Gazette, no. 5143, vol. 147, 29 September 2016. Retrieved 21 January 2017. As of 2014, Borrow was married with two children. == Published work == Borrow specialises in T-cell responses in acute and early HIV-1 infections, research which it is hoped will aid the creation of vaccines.
