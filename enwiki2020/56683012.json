Retrieved 2018-02-24. == Biography == Hrvoje Tkal\u010di\u0107 studied physics and geophysics at the University of Zagreb (Faculty of Science), from which he obtained a Diploma of Engineering in Physics (speciality in Geophysics with meteorology) in 1996. He continued his postgraduate study at the University of California at Berkeley in the Department of Earth and Planetary Science, and defended a PhD thesis entitled \"Study of deep Earth structure using seismic body waves\" in 2001.Who is Who in Croatian Science: Hrvoje Tkal\u010di\u0107 \u2013 Education. Retrieved 2018-02-24. He was employed as a research assistant at the UC Berkeley Seismological Laboratory (1997-2001), as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics of the University of California San Diego (2002-2003), and as a postdoctoral researcher at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore, California (2003-2006). In 2006, he began a continuing position as Scientist in the Seismology group at Multimax, Inc., in Emeryville, California. From 01/2007 until 04/2013, he was a Fellow at the Research School of Earth Sciences (RSES) of the Australian National University (ANU), Canberra, Australia. From 04/13 until 12/18, he was a Senior Fellow and Associate Professor in Seismology and Mathematical Geophysics at RSES, ANU.

Retrieved 2018-04-257. His primary research interests involve studying Earth's structure and dynamics using state-of-the-art seismological techniques, with a main focus on the Earth's core and the lowermost mantle, and developing new techniques for imaging Earth's interior, including both seismic and correlation wavefield. Other interests include studying the physics of tectonic and volcanic earthquakes by means of waveform modelling, and improving volumetric raypath coverage of the Earth's interior through the installation of seismic instruments in remote parts of the planet, including on the ocean bottom.Tko je tko u hrvatskoj znanosti: Hrvoje Tkal\u010di\u0107 \u2013 Znanstveni interesi.
