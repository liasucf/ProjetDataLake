By the 1980s he became a radio consultant and vice-president of research and development for the Atlanta-based Burkhart/Abrams consulting company. By the 1990s he started his own consulting company, Sinton, Barnes and Associates. In 1994 he worked to get Jim Hightower, a populist radio host, a syndicated radio show, to counterbalance conservative host Rush Limbaugh. ==Air America== In 2003 he began a venture to start a liberal-leaning radio network. That station would become Air America. Sinton would later use his clout in the radio industry to become outspoken against the Fairness Doctrine ==Progressive Voices Institute, Inc.== In 2011, recognizing that progressives would never catch up on conservative-dominated talk radio or cable television, Sinton and original Air America sales director, Reed Haggard, were joined by online specialist George Vasilopoulos, in starting the non-profit Progressive Voices Institute, Inc. PVI's first educational project is a progressive portal that aggregates all progressive video, audio, and written word in a smartphone application called Progressive Voices App. PV App is an attempt to leverage the burgeoning Mobile internet revolution, and create a Progressive Media Universe on that platform. ==References== ==External links== *PBS interview Category:American broadcasters Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
