    "text": "Tucum\u00e1n () is the most densely populated, and the second-smallest by land area, of the provinces of Argentina. Located in the northwest of the country, the province has the capital of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, often shortened to Tucum\u00e1n. Neighboring provinces are, clockwise from the north: Salta, Santiago del Estero and Catamarca. It is nicknamed El Jard\u00edn de la Rep\u00fablica (The Garden of the Republic), as it is a highly productive agricultural area. ==Etymology== The word Tucum\u00e1n probably originated from the Quechua languages. It may represent a deformation of the term Yucum\u00e1n, which denotes the \"place of origin of several rivers\". It can also be a deformation of the word Tucma, which means \"the end of things\". Before Spanish colonization, the region lay in the outer limits of the Inca empire. El nombre \"Tucum\u00e1n\" ==History== Ruins of the Quilmes civilization, a Diaguita culture in the area Tucum\u00e1n House: Argentine Independence was signed here in 1816. Downtown Tucum\u00e1n in the 1920s Sugar mill in Mercedes Sosa, a folk singer from Tucum\u00e1n Before the Spanish colonization, this land was inhabited by the Diaguitas and Tonocotes. Operativo Independencia: Military zones of Argentina, 1975-1983 (Tucum\u00e1n Province is in zone 3, the smallest province in the middle). In 1533, Diego de Almagro explored the Argentine Northwest, including Tucum\u00e1n. In 1549 the Peruvian governor Pedro de la Gasca granted Juan N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Prado the territory of Tucum\u00e1n. Prado established the first Spanish settlement at the town of Barco on the Dulce River. Prado named his province \"Tucum\u00e1n\" after Tucumamahao, one of the leaders of the local people who formed an alliance with him. In 1552, Francisco de Aguirre was dispatched to take possession of the territory for Chile. Aguirre followed a repressive policy, triggering a rebellion by the native people. Outnumbered, the colonists were forced to move in 1553 to a new location, where they founded the town of Santiago del Estero. By 1565, Diego de Villaroel founded San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n and the Provincia de Tucum\u00e1n, Jur\u00edes y Diaguitas was organized. Because of frequent attacks by the indigenous peoples, the Malones, in 1685, San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n was moved by Miguel de Salas some 65 km from its first location, where it was redeveloped. The aborigines of the region presented a strong resistance to the Spanish, who decided to move the defeated tribes toward Buenos Aires. The most noted of these relocations was the case of the Quilmes, who were moved to the city of Quilmes. Tucum\u00e1n was a midpoint for shipments of gold and silver from the Viceroyalty of Peru to Buenos Aires. It produced cattle, textiles, and wood products that provided supplies for the convoys on their way to Buenos Aires. Because of its important geographical position, and as head of the civil and Catholic governments, it acquired special importance during the 18th century. The creation of the Viceroyalty of the R\u00edo de la Plata in 1776 meant the end of the convoys from Per\u00fa to Buenos Aires. Tucum\u00e1n, with 20,000 inhabitants by that time, suffered also from the British imports from the newly opened customs of Buenos Aires, no longer under the monopoly of the Spanish Crown. In 1783, the Intendancy of Tucum\u00e1n was divided; Tucum\u00e1n was set under the control of the Intendancy of Salta del Tucum\u00e1n, with its centre in Salta. Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn arrived in Tucum\u00e1n in 1813 and installed the military school. In 1814, the Intendancy of Salta was divided into the present provinces. On July 9, 1816, at the Congress of Tucum\u00e1n, the Provincias Unidas del R\u00edo de la Plata (\"United Provinces of the R\u00edo de la Plata\") declared their independence from Spain. Internal conflicts delayed the final fusion of the provinces into the Rep\u00fablica Argentina. Following the failure of Argentina's first independence- era government, the Directorio, Governor Bernab\u00e9 Ar\u00e1oz on March 22, 1820, proclaimed the creation of the Federal Republic of Tucum\u00e1n. The experiment collapsed, however, when the neighboring provinces of Catamarca and Santiago del Estero withdrew the following year. The beginning of the 20th century, with the customs restrictions and the arrival of the railway, brought prosperous economic times for the province and its sugarcane production. Numerous landmarks were built, such as Ninth of July Park and the Tucum\u00e1n Government Palace, and a daily newspaper founded in 1912, La Gaceta, became the most circulated Argentine daily outside Buenos Aires, but the sugar price crisis of the 1960s and President Juan Carlos Ongan\u00eda's order to have 11 large state-owned sugar mills closed in 1966, hit Tucum\u00e1n's economy hard, and ushered in an era of instability for the province.Archdiocese of Tucum\u00e1n In 1975, President Isabel Per\u00f3n declared a state of emergency in the province. The decree led to Operation Independence, an official military campaign at least as brutal on local magistrates, lawmakers, and faculty as it was on its stated target, the ERP. Violence did not fully abate until the appointment of General Antonio Domingo Bussi, the operation's commander, as governor at the behest of the dictatorship that deposed Per\u00f3n in 1976. Efficient as well as ruthless, Bussi oversaw the completion of several stalled public works, but also presided over some of the worst human rights abuses during that painful 1976-77 period.Andersen, Martin. Dossier Secreto. Westview Press, 1993. Retaining a sizable following, Bussi was elected governor in his own right in 1995, but lost much of his earlier popularity during his four-year tenure. Life in Tucum\u00e1n has since returned to a certain normality. Its economy has recovered strongly during the expansive period Argentina has had in the decade since 2002. Jos\u00e9 Alperovich, elected governor in 2003, has presided over record investment in public works while reaping criticism for attempts to eliminate term limits for his office. ==Geography== Tucum\u00e1n: La Angostura Lake Despite Tucum\u00e1n's small size, it has two main different geographical systems. The east is associated with the Gran Chaco flat lands, while the west presents a mixture of the Sierras of the Pampas to the south and the canyons of the Argentine Northwest to the north. The Cerro del Bols\u00f3n is the highest peak at an elevation of . The Sal\u00ed is the province's main river. Tucum\u00e1n also has four dams that are used for hydroelectricity and irrigation: El Cadillal on Sal\u00ed River, the province's most important dam; Embalse R\u00edo Hondo on the Hondo River; La Angostura on de los Sosa River; and Escaba on the Marapa River. The Santa Mar\u00eda River crosses the Valles Calchaqu\u00edes. ==Climate== Taf\u00ed del Valle Cristo Bendicente by the tucumano artist Juan Carlos Iramain, on top of Cerro San Javier Tucuman lies at the convergence of temperate climates and tropical climates further north, retaining characteristics of both in the lowlands. Furthermore, it is highly monsoonal, and depends also on elevation. As a rule of thumb, the far east is drier and hotter, whereas the Piedmont has many storms in the summer which moderate temperatures. The first foothills are very humid, supporting a dense jungle, and as altitude increases, a thick forest and then cool grasslands. The westernmost areas are once again a bit dryer because of a rain shadow. The eastern parts have an average annual temperature of . Summers are hot with mean temperatures averaging between while in winter, the mean temperatures are between . Easternmost parts of the province, which borders the Chaco region are home to the highest and lowest temperatures in the province where absolute maximum temperatures can exceed while absolute minimum temperatures can reach close to owing to the accumulation of cold air that descends from the mountains. At higher altitudes, the climate is cooler with summer temperatures averaging and winter temperatures averaging . The annual temperature in the higher altitudes is at an altitude of above sea level. Within the valleys located between the mountains, temperatures are cooler with a mean annual temperature of (summers average while winters average ) in the Tafi valley. Precipitation in the lowlands ranges from 600 mm (24 in) in the east, to close to 1,200 mm in the foothills (48 in), in a very monsoonal pattern with 4-5 completely dry winter months, and a peak of about 200 mm (7.9 in) in the rainiest summer month. The eastward-facing slopes concentrate not only the heaviest precipitation, with spots around 1,800 mm (71 in) falling mostly in the 5 months of the summer monsoon, but also have a unique characteristic, which is that during part of the year, they are constantly immersed in a thick fog, providing humidity for the development of a thick jungle. The climate quickly becomes decidedly temperate with altitude, supporting different kinds of forest which even receive some snow every winter, finally reaching high-altitude grasslands with cool, windy weather year-round. The abundant precipitation creates a wide area of abundant vegetation and justifies Tucum\u00e1n's title of \"Jard\u00edn de la Rep\u00fablica\" (Garden of the Republic). ==Economy== San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n. Long among the most underdeveloped Argentine provinces, Tucum\u00e1n Province has been growing strongly, and its economy, the nation's seventh-largest, reached US$7.2 billion in 2006. Its per capita output of US$5,400 (around US$7,900 in 2011) was nearly 40% below the national average, but compares favourably with that of most of its neighbors. In 2012, the per capita income of the province is of 8,000 dollars Known internationally for its prodigious sugarcane (with 2,300 km2, and the sugar production, 60% of the country's), Tucum\u00e1n's economy is quite diversified, and agriculture accounts for about 7% of output. After the sugar crisis of the 1960s, Tucum\u00e1n tried to diversify its crops, and now cultivates, among others, lemons (world first producer), strawberries, kiwifruit, beans, maize, alfalfa, and soybeans. Cattle, sheep, and goats are raised mainly for local consumption. Manufacturing in Tucum\u00e1n initially centered on sugar production, but has diversified significantly since 1960. Sugar mills comprise about 15% to the total economy. Besides the industrialisation of the sugarcane into sugar, paper, and alcohol, food, textile, automotive, and metallurgical industries are present. Among the latter, the freight-truck assembly operated by the Volkswagen Group-controlled Swedish Scania company is probably the best known. Mining is a minor activity, centered on salt, clay, lime, and other non-metallic extractions. The province is also big in lemons and blueberries; they export almost 80% of the harvest to other countries. Cultural and sport tourism is common in the province, and attracts a number of Argentine tourists every year. The Panamerican Highway (Route 9) crosses San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n, and connects it with Santiago del Estero and Buenos Aires. The city also serves as a mid-stop for tourists visiting other provinces of the Argentine Northwest. The Teniente General Benjam\u00edn Matienzo International Airport has regular flights to Buenos Aires , Lima , Santiago de Chile , Cordoba and Sao Paulo , and receives almost 800,000 passengers every year. The most visited destinations of the Province are the Campo de los Alisos National Park, Valles Calchaqu\u00edes, Taf\u00ed del Valle, Ruins of Quilmes, the Diaguita community of Amaicha del Valle, and the city of San Miguel de Tucum\u00e1n. Four important universities are in the province: Universidad Nacional de Tucum\u00e1n (with 60,000 students), Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica Nacional, Universidad del Norte Santo Tom\u00e1s de Aquino, and Universidad de San Pablo-T. == Government == The provincial government is divided into three branches: the executive, headed by a popularly elected governor, who appoints the cabinet; the legislative; and the judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court. The Constitution of Tucum\u00e1n Province forms the formal law of the province. Tucum\u00e1n Provincial Police In Argentina, the most important law enforcement organization is the Argentine Federal Police but the additional work is carried out by the Tucum\u00e1n Provincial Police. ==Political division== The province is divided into 17 departments (Spanish departamentos).
