It welcomed the commitment of Congolese authorities to promote good governance and economic management. There was concern at the continuation of hostilities in the east of the country and violations of human rights and international humanitarian law. The Council recognised the link between the illegal exploitation of natural resources and arms trafficking as one of the major factors fuelling the conflict in the country. ===Acts=== Acting under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter, the Council extended MONUC's mandate and temporarily increased its strength by 300 personnel until 1 July 2006. Congolese parties were urged to ensure free, fair and transparent elections and carry out a reform of the security sector. Meanwhile, the international community was urged to provide assistance for the reform of the police and armed forces, while MONUC was requested to continue to provide assistance for the political transition process. Finally, efforts by MONUC to implement the zero-tolerance sexual exploitation policy were welcomed. ==See also== * Kivu conflict * Ituri conflict * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1601 to 1700 (2005\u20132006) * Second Congo War ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1635 Category:2005 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 1635 Category:October 2005 events ",
