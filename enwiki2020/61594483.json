Without a doubt, after the opening of the Spanish Embassy in Bissau in the year 2007, the ties strengthened. Guinea-Bissau has appointed an Ambassador resident in Madrid, who presented his credentials to King Juan Carlos I at the beginning of 2012.Ficha de Guinea-Bis\u00e1u Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Diplomatic relations. The most relevant bilateral issues are: Immigration: During the visit of Minister Moratinos on January 27, 2008, a new Generation Migration Cooperation Agreement was signed. These authorities have been cooperating without any problem in the field of repatriations and detentions of immigrants and intermediaries who prepare exit operations. It is true that there are not many immigrants who leave Guinea Bissau However, since Frontex was installed in Senegal, immigrants moved to this country. In 2010, the \"Seahorse\" program began to operate. This program, financed with European funds and executed by the Civil Guard, has been extended and renamed Project WEST-SAHEL, and has a Spanish Civil Guard officer displaced in Bissau. This is a satellite communications program, which is already working, in Senegal, Mauritania and Cape Verde. It has a technical support installed in Madrid, and the Spanish Civil Guard conducts training courses for B\u00e1uguinean officials. It serves to have real-time information of clandestine vessels bound for the Canary Islands, among other achievements, in addition to helping border and immigration control in Guinea Bissau. The Embassy has an Interior Attach\u00e9 that is very useful in this area. Fishing: The Fishing Protocol signed with the EU in January 2015 has already been mentioned. Until now, the only fishing licenses issued for vessels from Member States have been issued to Spanish fishing vessels. == Economic relations == Bilateral relations between Spain and Guinea Bissau in the economic and commercial sphere are reduced. The presence of Spanish companies in Guinea Bissau is still small, however since the opening of the Spanish Embassy and during the period 2008-2012, both thanks to the improvement of economic conditions in the country and the deterioration of business opportunities In Spain, interest in investing in this country grew. Thus, between 2010 and 2012, the Spanish business presence began to make its way with an estimated Spanish direct investment, in companies of Bissauguinean legal constitution.Ficha de Guinea-Bis\u00e1u Office of Diplomatic Information.

Section: Economic relations. == Cooperation == Embassy of Spain in Bissau During the 2007-2011 period, Spain became the country's first bilateral donor along with Portugal. The first Hispanic-Guinean Joint Commission took place in July 2007 in which Spain undertook to grant Guinea Bissau \u20ac15 million (between 2007-2009). Although in the first three Master Plans (2001-2012) G-B has been listed as a priority country, in the IV Master Plan 2013-2016 it is considered as a country of departure due to criteria of effectiveness and quality of aid, as well as for budgetary reasons.Ficha de Guinea-Bis\u00e1u Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Cooperation. The topics defined as priorities are health, education, fisheries and water and sanitation. It has been mentioned that, through the EU West Sahel project, there is always a Civil Guard officer in Bissau, who is renewed every 8 months, who cooperates with local law enforcement authorities in the tasks of organizing emigration services and borders. In the commercial sphere, Spain was designated as a facilitating donor by Guinea Bissau within a program of the Enhanced Integrated Framework (MIM), in the WTO. The cooperation program, endowed with more than $3 million, is intended to improve the country's commercial capabilities and, in particular, to the modernization of customs. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Guinea-Bissau * Foreign relations of Spain == References == Spain Guinea-Bissau ",
