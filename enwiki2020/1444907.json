It is run by Her Majesty's Prison Service. ==History== Belmarsh Prison was built on part of the East site of the former Royal Arsenal in Woolwich, and became operational on 2 April 1991. Belmarsh is adjacent to and adjoins Woolwich Crown Court: it is used in high-profile cases, particularly those concerning national security. Between 2001 and 2002, Belmarsh Prison was used to detain a number of people indefinitely without charge or trial under the provisions of the Part 4 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, leading it to be called the \"British version of Guantanamo Bay\". The law lords later ruled in A v Secretary of State for the Home Dept that such imprisonment was discriminatory and against the Human Rights Act. It is often used for the detention of prisoners for terrorist related offences. In September 2006 the number of such prisoners was 51. In May 2007, there was a violent disturbance in the prison, Sky News reported. At least four prison officers were injured.Staff hurt in jail disturbance | Metro News In 2009, an archaeological dig on site led to the discovery of a 6,000-year-old trackway in the prison, the second oldest known wooden trackway in Northern Europe after the Sweet Track near Glastonbury. In November 2009, an inspection report from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons criticised the \"extremely high\" amount of force used to control inmates at the prison. The report also stated that an unusually high number of prisoners had reported being intimidated or victimised by staff at Belmarsh. In 2010, HMP Isis Young Offenders Institution was opened within the perimeter wall of Belmarsh Prison. ==The prison today== Car park and main entrance Belmarsh is a Category A Prison holding prisoners from all over the United Kingdom.
