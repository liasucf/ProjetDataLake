    "text": "Ghost Adventures is an American paranormal documentary and reality television series that premiered on October 17, 2008, on the Travel Channel. The program follows ghost hunters Zak Bagans, Nick Groff (until season 10), Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley, and Jay Wasley as they investigate locations that are reported to be haunted. ==Premise== Ghost Adventures began as an independent film, produced in a documentary style. It was filmed in 2004 and produced by 4Reel Productions in 2006. The SciFi Channel premiered 4Reel's Ghost Adventures on July 25, 2007. The documentary centered on the trio's investigation of alleged paranormal activity in and around Virginia City, Nevada, including the Goldfield Hotel in Goldfield, Nevada. The crew returned there during the series' fourth, fifth, and seventh seasons. The series is produced by MY- Tupelo Entertainment (a merger of MY Entertainment and Tupelo-Honey Productions). ===Methodology=== Zak Bagans, Nick Groff (seasons 1\u201310), Aaron Goodwin, Billy Tolley, and Jay Wasley investigate reportedly haunted locations, hoping to collect visual or auditory evidence of paranormal activity. Each episode begins with the crew touring the investigation site with its owners or caretakers. These introductions typically include Bagans's voice-overs of the site's history as well as interviews with people who claim to have witnessed paranormal phenomena there. On the basis of these interviews, the crew place X's with black or gray tape at the sites of some serious alleged paranormal activity. They later return to these spots in order to set up static night-vision cameras to try and film it happening. After completing the walk-through, they discuss their strategy, then are locked in the location overnight, which they believe will prevent \"audio contamination\" and extraneous shadows. They use a variety of equipment, including digital thermometers, electromagnetic field (EMF) meters, handheld digital video cameras, audio recorders, the Ovilus device, point of view cameras, and infrared night-vision cameras in an effort to capture evidence of ghosts. The members sometimes place objects and shout verbal taunts they believe ghosts might move or respond to. The video and audio collected during each investigation is analyzed after the investigation, and the whole thing is cut down to fit one hour. The most prominent pieces of evidence found are then presented at the appropriate times they happened during the investigation and each one is explained. During the series, the crew claims to have captured and experienced various Fortean phenomena, which they say include simultaneous equipment malfunctions such as battery drain, voltage spikes, fluctuations in electromagnetic fields, sudden changes in temperature (such as cold spots), unexplained noises, electronic voice phenomena (EVP), and apparitions. The crew also claim to have recorded spirit possessions on video. Bagans believes that he was possessed at the Preston School of Industry and at Poveglia Island in Italy. Groff claims that he was overtaken by a \"dark energy\" at the Moon River Brewing Company. Goodwin claims he was \"under the influence of a dark spirit\" at Bobby Mackey's Music World and Winchester Mystery House. Goodwin is often left alone in the alleged \"hotspots\" during lockdowns to see how the spirits will react to Goodwin being alone. ==Team members== *Zak Bagans (2008\u2013present) *Aaron Goodwin (2008\u2013present) *Billy Tolley (2009\u2013present) *Jay Wasley (2009\u2013present) ===Former=== *Nick Groff (2008\u20132014) The following people have appeared as recurring guests in the show as part of the GAC: * Bill Chappell (2010\u20132014) * Mark and Debby Constantino (2008\u20132011; until their passing away) ===Celebrity guests=== Ghost Adventures has involved celebrities who have participated in the investigations or appeared as eyewitnesses: ==Series overview== ===Episodes=== ==Reception== ===Controversies=== In the Halloween special titled Ghost Adventures Live, which was broadcast from the Trans-Allegheny Lunatic Asylum on October 30, 2009, controversy arose when Robert Bess, inventor of the Parabot Containment Chamber (said to attract and empower spirits using energy, giving them form), claims to have had an EMF meter knocked violently out of his hands. However, upon investigation of the video, it was found that he had actually thrown it. In the November 6, 2009, follow-up Ghost Adventures Live: Post Mortem, hosts Bagans and Groff reviewed the video and concluded that they couldn't claim any paranormal explanation for the incident. == Related productions == === Spin-offs === ====Ghost Adventures: Aftershocks==== Ghost Adventures: Aftershocks is a series that premiered on Saturday April 26, 2014, on the Travel Channel.
