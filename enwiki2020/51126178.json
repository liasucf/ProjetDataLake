The crew member stated on social media that she would not return for Season 3 because the Duffer Brothers created a hostile work environment for women. The brothers strongly denied this claim and an investigation by Netflix found no wrongdoing.

However, Sink said she did not object. ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! colspan=\"4\" | Credited as ! rowspan=\"2\" | Notes |- ! style=\"width:4em; font- size:90%\" | Directors !
