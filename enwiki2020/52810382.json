    "text": "Anti-tetanus immunoglobulin, also known as tetanus immune globulin (TIG) and tetanus antitoxin, is a medication made up of antibodies against the tetanus toxin. It is used to prevent tetanus in those who have a wound that is at high risk and have not been fully vaccinated with tetanus toxoid. It is also used to treat tetanus along with antibiotics and muscle relaxants. It is given by injection into a muscle. Common side effects include pain at the site of injection and fever. Allergic reactions including anaphylaxis may rarely occur. There is also a very low risk of the spread of infections such as viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS with the human version. Use during pregnancy is deemed acceptable. It is made from either human or horse blood plasma. Use of the horse version became common in the 1910s, while the human version came into frequent use in the 1960s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the safest and most effective medicines needed in a health system. The human version may be unavailable in the developing world. The horse version is not typically used in the developed world due to the risk of serum sickness. ==References== Category:World Health Organization essential medicines Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ",
