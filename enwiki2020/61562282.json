    "text": "The Revenge of the Dead Indians (original German title: Die Rache der toten Indianer) is a 1993 documentary film essay directed by Henning Lohner about composer John Cage and his theories about music. It pays tribute to Cage's thoughts, music, and influence and has been described as \"an unexpected and fascinating combination of intellectual thought, viewpoints and opinions.\" Featuring discussions with Cage himself as well as interviews with friends, companions and colleagues of the famous composer, the film thematically combines \"found\" video and audio landscapes inspired by Cage\u2019s texts, music and philosophy.https://www.filmdienst.de/film/details/59073/die-rache-der- toten-indianer It is structured according to Cage\u2019s compositional methods and translates these musical processes freely to the film medium.https://www.eai.org/titles/die-rache-der-toten- indianerhttps://imrccenter.umaine.edu/2015/10/19/tuesdays-at-the-imrc-film- screening-in-revenge-of-the-dead-indians-in-memoriam-john-cage/ The film was released after Cage had recently died. It has been released on video and DVD since 10 June 2008.https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_revenge_of_the_dead_indians_1993 ==Content and form== Both in content as well as in its cinematic approach and structure, The Revenge Of The Dead Indians is a homage to John Cage, paying tribute to one of the most influential American composers of the 20th century.https://magazin.klassik.com/reviews/reviews.cfm?TASK=REVIEW&RECID;=30538&REID;=17477 The film can neither clearly be categorized as a documentary nor as a feature film.http://www.moderecords.com/catalog/197cage.htmlhttp://www.rondomagazin.de/kritiken.php?kritiken_id=6259 Rather, it is a combination of \"found\" videos and diverse soundscapes.https://www.jpc.de/jpcng/classic/detail/-/art/John- Cage-1912-1992-The-Revenge-of-the-Dead-Indians-In-Memoriam-John- Cage/hnum/5104830 It has also been called a \"film essay.\"http://www.artnet.de/galerien/galerie-springer-berlin/lohner-carlson- raw-material-portraits-and/ The mode of filmic depiction is based on, and inspired by, the philosophy and the compositional creative work of Cage himself. Lohner portrays Cage in regards to the musical principle that every image, every statement and every scene can entirely stand on its own, complete in itself as its own narrative entity, yet also remain central to the overall structure and phrasing of the film. It was Lohner\u2019s goal to honor Cage\u2019s creative mind, Cage\u2019s works and his influence. Thereby, the filmmaker\u2019s attention is focused on \u201cforgotten\u201d landscapes: places which one easily passes and which are located at the roadside and are not popularly touristic, otherwise unnoticed or ignored in daily life. Narratively, The Revenge Of The Dead Indians deals with the major issues that Cage was occupied with: Coincidence and chaos, his buddhist worldview \u2014 rejecting to manipulate the world \u2014, art as imitation of nature, and the identity of music and sounds. Therefore, short clips of Cage\u2019s concerts and his musical performances are shown. Furthermore, short images, sometimes only for a few seconds, of nature, landscapes and cities are featured; these images were recorded world-wide and are partially accompanied by music and sounds. Together, they add up to a \"large, through-composed picture collage\"https://magazin.klassik.com/reviews/reviews.cfm?TASK=REVIEW&RECID;=30538&REID;=17477 inspired by Cage\u2019s texts. Additionally, conversations with Cage himself are shown repeatedly during the film. The film also features interviews with 42 individuals \u2014 from well-known artists, actors, architects, choreographers, composers, theoreticians and writers to unknown street cleaners and market vendors who love street noise and sounds \u2014 in conversation with each other.http://www.moderecords.com/catalog/197cage.html Amongst the interview partners are famous personalities such as Heiner M\u00fcller, John Zorn, Giorgio Strehler, Iannis Xenakis, Frank Zappa, Yoko Ono, William Forsythe, Alison Knowles, Yehudi Menuhin, Richard Serra, Merce Cunningham, Ellsworth Kelly, Dennis Hopper and Noam Chomsky, talking about their encounters with Cage, the impression his music left on them, and his significance for their own work. They also comment on phenomena that Cage dealt with, such as coincidence, chaos, anarchy, noise and silence. The film ends with a performance of Cage\u2019s piece 4\u203233\u2033, performed in 1990 at the Invalidenstra\u00dfe in Berlin, accidentally the day that the old checkpoint between East- and Westberlin was torn down. == Title == The film's title derives from dramatist Heiner M\u00fcller who is interviewed in the film, remarking that John Cage was \u201cthe revenge of the dead Indians on European music.\u201d https://www.johncage.org/blog/rose.pdf Thereby, he refers to the murdered native Americans who are a central part of American history but have been pushed aside and ignored ever since: M\u00fcller explains that \"culture comes from the oppressed, the displaced and has therefore become the unconscious; which rebels, and is the Indian element of Cage.\"https://medienarchiv.zhdk.ch/files/24c25a20-d5bb-48e3-9953-798731cb53df ==Background and production== In the early 1990s, Lohner worked with Cage on Cage's only film production, titled One 11. https://www.johncage.org/blog/rose.pdf Both had met in August 1990 when Cage had come to Germany to give a series of concerts. Lohner was working for German Public Television and was asked to document Cage\u2019s visit to Berlin. https://transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/55494/P00027.pdf Subsequently, they collaborated during the final years of Cage\u2019s life. During that time, Lohner filmed interviews and footage with Cage, and after Cage's death decided to assemble some of it into The Revenge of the Dead Indians. Concert performances incorporated in the film were recorded live during the \"Musicircus\" homage at Symphony Space in New York, November 1, 1992, and at the John Cage music festival at the Akademie der Sch\u00f6nen K\u00fcnste in East Berlin, August 1, 1990. http://www.moderecords.com/catalog/197cage.html Furthermore, Lohner and cinematographer Van Carlson filmed in the deserts of New Mexico, in Napa Valley in California, in the European landscapes of France, Italy and Germany, as well as in big cities like Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco, Milan, Paris, Osaka, Toyko and Hong Kong. https://transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/55494/P00027.pdf The Revenge of the Dead Indians was financed through 45 TV-documentaries which Lohner during that time realized for the ZDF and Arte, as the filmmaker himself recalls: > \"Every tape of raw material went into the fundus for the Dead Indians. We > were engaged in recycling and making subversive use of the existing > production and broadcast structures (for whom we had, after all, supplied > over 45 films by now) \u2013 and we kept all the raw material, the left-overs, > precisely the typical television garbage, the tape ashes, from which then > this film could emerge.\" Lohner explains that the film was also his revenge on the conventional, rating-driven television system, as the \"classic television task is typically focused on a previously articulated topic, which has to be realized within certain content-based and technically outlined conditions. In this sense, the task within public and private television is subjected to rigid guidelines, and thus is not open to experiments, coincidences or individual initiative.\"https://transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/55494/P00027.pdf The film emerged from over 250 hours of footage and 200 hours of recorded sound, woven together from over 1200 cuts, with the final edit having a script organized like a music score. The sound and visual material was edited to more than 1200 cuts before the final film length of 130 minutes was reached. The shortest scene has the duration of exactly one frame, the longest scene has the duration of exactly 4 minutes, 33 seconds.http://moderecords.com/catalog/197cage.html Lohner and his editor Sven Fleck put together a score for the edits, \"hoping that chance could emerge again from the non-coincidental. The editing of the film had to deconstruct the composed aspects, so that the material could be interpreted by the viewer in infinitely different ways.\"https://transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/55494/P00027.pdf The selection of the images and texts of the film was based on a pattern of musical composition. Lohner and Fleck put together catalogues of images which lexically referred to similarities in the image content, while all the recorded interviews, readings and conversations were copied word by word onto several thousand pages and then divided into thematic chapters. Through several selective processes, they were \u201csieved\u201d and assembled into a three- act- structure.https://transmediale.de/sites/default/files/public/node/publication/field_pubpdf/fid/55494/P00027.pdf ==Reception== The Revenge of the Dead Indians has been called \"an unexpected and fascinating combination of intellectual thought, viewpoints and opinions.\" The blog For All Events commented that the film was \"an excellent documentary introduction to the music and ideas of John Cage. [\u2026] The film delivers a sympathetic and enjoyable presentation of his music and his ideas. He was a charming, interesting, thoughtful man.\"https://michaelfergusonforallevents.blogspot.com/2015/01/the-revenge-of- dead-indians-in-memoriam_82.html In the German newspaper Tageszeitung, critic Birgit Glombitza raved that Lohner's 130-minute-homage to Cage was a \"symphony of coincidences\" that illuminates the compositional methods of the man whom modern music owed its symbiosis of harmony and chaos to.http://www.taz.de/!1575821/ Music magazine klassic.com called The Revenge Of The Dead Indians a \"fascinating, artistically ambitious, in the end slightly exhausting, but always inspiring portrait of John Cage and his outstanding importance for music and art of the 20th century.\"https://magazin.klassik.com/reviews/reviews.cfm?TASK=REVIEW&RECID;=30538&REID;=17477 ==Featured personalities== * Yves Bazillou * Michael Berger * John Cage * Farid Chahboub * Noam Chomsky https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_revenge_of_the_dead_indians_1993 * Merce Cunningham * Jacqeline Daubert * Ren\u00e9 Delesalle * Ellsworth Kelly * William Forsythe * Corinne Fortin * Betty Freeman * Frank Gehry https://www.otherminds.org/timeline-post/revenge-dead-indians-memoriam-john- cage/ * Murray Gell-Mann * Matt Groening https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_revenge_of_the_dead_indians_1993 * Ben Habdallah * Rutger Hauer http://www.rutgerhauer.org/plots/reven.phphttps://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_revenge_of_the_dead_indians_1993 * Dennis Hopper https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_revenge_of_the_dead_indians_1993 * Alison Knowles * Raymond Kurzweil * Edward Lorenz * Beno\u00eet Mandelbrot https://www.otherminds.org/timeline-post/revenge-dead-indians-memoriam-john- cage/ * Yehudi Menuhin * Mohamed Ben Methnic * Marvin Minsky * Heiner M\u00fcller https://www.otherminds.org/timeline-post/revenge-dead-indians-memoriam-john- cage/ * M.
