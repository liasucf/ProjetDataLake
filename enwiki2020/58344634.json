    "text": "\"The Ringer\" is a song by American rapper Eminem from his album Kamikaze (2018). It debuted in the top 10 in Australia, Canada, Finland, Ireland, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It contains an interpolation from \"Ooouuu\", written by Matthew Jacobson and Katorah Marrero, as performed by Young M.A. ==Background== \"The Ringer\" shows Eminem attacking the current hip hop scene in 2018, mainly artists under the term of \"mumble rap\". A few rappers he calls out on the track are Lil Yachty, Lil Pump, Lil Xan, Machine Gun Kelly, Vince Staples and Iggy Azalea. He also attacks the critics who gave his previous album Revival negative reviews. Finally, he sent shots at United States president Donald Trump again, referencing his experience to performing freestyle rap \"The Storm\" at the 2017 BET Awards. ==Personnel== * Eminem \u2013 lead vocals, production * Illa da Producer \u2013 production * Luis Resto \u2013 keyboards * Ronny J \u2013 production ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 10 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 36 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Greece Digital International Singles (IFPI) | 3 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) | 2 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden (Sverigetopplistan) | 8 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Hot 100 | 8 |- |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:2018 songs Category:Songs written by Luis Resto (musician) Category:Songs written by Eminem Category:Eminem songs Category:UK R&B; Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Songs written by Ronny J ",
