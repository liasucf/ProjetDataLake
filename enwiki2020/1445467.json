    "text": "House of Blues is an American chain of live music concert halls and restaurants. It was founded by Isaac Tigrett, the co-founder of Hard Rock Cafe, and Dan Aykroyd, co-star of the 1980 film The Blues Brothers. The first location opened at Harvard Square in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1992. The chain has been a division of Live Nation Entertainment since July 2006, and there are 11 locations throughout the United States . ==Overview== The first House of Blues opened on November 26, 1992, in the Harvard Square commercial district and retail area of Cambridge, Massachusetts, as a live music concert hall and restaurant. The company was originally financed by Dan Aykroyd, Aerosmith, Paul Shaffer, River Phoenix, Jim Belushi, and Harvard University, among others. This original location closed in 2003 as the company sought a larger Boston location. However, the hands-in-concrete driveway where members of the Blues Brothers and others left their mark, still remains. Aykroyd remains associated with the brand and is present for most openings, attending and performing as one half of The Blues Brothers. In 1993 House of Blues launched a 501(c)(3) non-profit called International House of Blues Foundation which provided arts programs, resources and musical instruments for youths. The Music Forward Foundation continues to provide services for youth and has generated more than $20 million of support for these programs over its 20+ year existence. Also in 1993, The syndicated program The House of Blues Radio Hour, hosted by Dan Aykroyd as Elwood Blues, launched in partnership with CBS Radio Hour. This hour-long program focuses on the history of blues music and the contemporary artists honoring the art form. The program ended in July, 2017. In 1999, House of Blues acquired Universal Concerts from Seagram. On July 5, 2006, Live Nation acquired House of Blues Entertainment and created the Live Nation Club and Theater Division. As a division of Live Nation, the company currently operates 12 clubs throughout North America. ==Locations== ===Current=== {|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Metro vicinity |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Venue location |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Address |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Opened |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Capacity |- |Greater New Orleans |French Quarter |225 Decatur St New Orleans, LA 70130 |1994 |1,000 |- |Chicago metropolitan area |Marina City |329 N Dearborn St Chicago, IL 60654 |1996 |1,400 |- |Myrtle Beach Metro Area |Barefoot Landing |4640 Hwy 17 S North Myrtle Beach, SC 29582 |1997 |2,100 |- |Greater Orlando |Disney Springs |1490 E Buena Vista Dr Lake Buena Vista, FL 32830 |1997 |2,600 |- |Las Vegas Valley |Las Vegas Strip (inside Mandalay Bay) |3950 S Las Vegas Blvd Las Vegas, NV 89119 |2-4-1999 |2,000 |- |Greater Cleveland |Downtown Cleveland |308 Euclid Ave Cleveland, OH 44114 |2004 |1,300 |- |Greater San Diego |Downtown San Diego |1055 5th Ave San Diego, CA 92101 |2005 |1,500 |- |Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex |Victory Park |2200 N Lamar St Dallas, TX 75202 |2007 |1,750 |- |Greater Houston |Downtown Houston |1204 Caroline St Houston, TX 77002 |2008 |1,800 |- |Greater Boston |Kenmore Square |15 Lansdowne St Boston, MA 02215 |2009 |2,600 |- |Metropolitan Los Angeles |Anaheim GardenWalk |400 West Disney Way #337 Anaheim, CA 92802 |2017 |2,200 |- |} ===Former=== {|border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\" |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Metro vicinity |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Venue location |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Address |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Opened !Closed !Notes |align=\"center\" style=\"background:#f0f0f0;\"|Capacity |- |Greater Boston |Harvard Square |96 Winthrop St Cambridge, MA 02138 |1992 |2003 |Replaced by Kenmore Square location in 2009. |180 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Metropolitan Los Angeles |Sunset Strip |8430 Sunset Blvd West Hollywood, CA 90069 |1994 |2015 | |1,100 |- |Downtown Disney |1530 Disneyland Dr Anaheim, CA 92802 |2001 |2016 |Relocated to nearby Anaheim GardenWalk in 2017. |1,100 |- |- |Metro Atlanta |Downtown Atlanta |152 Luckie St NW Atlanta, Georgia 30303 |1996 |1997 |re-branded as The Tabernacle in 1997. |2,000 |- |Atlantic City |Atlantic City Boardwalk (inside Showboat Atlantic City) |801 Boardwalk Atlantic City, NJ 08401 |2005 |2014 | |2,380 |- |} ==List of affiliated Live Nation venues== The following is a list of venues operated by Live Nation: {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
