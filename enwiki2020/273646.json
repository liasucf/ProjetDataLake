    "text": "is a member of the Imperial House of Japan who served as the Empress consort of Japan as the wife of Akihito, the 125th Emperor of Japan reigning from 7 January 1989 to 30 April 2019. Michiko married Crown Prince Akihito and became the Crown Princess of Japan in 1959. She was the first commoner and the first member of a religious minority (her family is Roman CatholicHerbert P. Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, 2000 ()) to marry into the Japanese Imperial Family. She has three children with her husband. Her elder son, Naruhito, is the current emperor to the Chrysanthemum Throne. As crown princess and later as empress consort, she has become the most visible and widely travelled imperial consort in Japanese history. Upon Emperor Akihito's abdication, Michiko received the new title of , or Empress Emerita. ==Early life and education== The future Empress in 1940 Michiko Sh\u014dda was born on 20 October 1934 at the University of Tokyo Hospital in Bunky\u014d, Tokyo, the second of four children born to Hidesabur\u014d Sh\u014dda (\u6b63\u7530\u82f1\u4e09\u90ce Sh\u014dda Hidesabur\u014d; 1903\u20131999), president and later honorary chairman of Nisshin Flour Milling Company, and his wife, Fumiko Soejima (\u526f\u5cf6\u5bcc\u7f8e\u5b50 Soejima Fumiko; 1909\u20131988). Raised in Tokyo and in a cultured family, she grew up receiving a careful education, both traditional and \"Western\", learning to speak English and to play piano and being initiated into the arts such as painting, cooking and k\u014dd\u014d. She has an older brother Iwao, a younger brother Osamu, and a younger sister Emiko.\"Michiko Shoda and Her Family\" Corbis Images. \"In the picture are (left to right), front row, Mrs. Fumi Shoda, her mother; Michiko; Telichiro, her grandfather; Emiko, her younger sister; and Hidesaburo Shoda, her father. Standing in back are (left), Osamu, a younger brother; and Iwao, an elder brother. The engagement of the Crown Prince to a commoner breaks more than 2,000 years of Japanese tradition. November 27, 1958.\" She is the niece of several academics, including Kenjir\u014d Sh\u014dda, a mathematician who was the president of the University of Osaka from 1954 until 1960. Sh\u014dda attended Futaba Elementary School in K\u014djimachi, a neighborhood in Chiyoda, Tokyo, but was required to leave in her fourth grade year because of the American bombings during World War II. She was then successively educated in the prefectures of Kanagawa (in the town of Katase, now part of the city of Fujisawa), Gunma (in Tatebayashi, home town of the Sh\u014dda family), and Nagano (in the town of Karuizawa, where Sh\u014dda had a second resort home). She returned to Tokyo in 1946 and completed her elementary education in Futaba and then attended the Sacred Heart School for Junior High School and High School in Minato, Tokyo. She graduated from high school in 1953. In 1957, she graduated summa cum laude from the Faculty of Literature at the University of the Sacred Heart (a Catholic university in Tokyo) with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English literature. Since she came from a particularly wealthy family, her parents were very selective about her suitors. There had been several contenders for her hand in marriage in the 1950s. Biographers of the writer Yukio Mishima, including Henry Scott Stokes, report that Mishima had considered marrying Michiko Sh\u014dda, and that he was introduced to her for that purpose some time in the 1950s. ==Engagement and marriage== Wedding portrait with Emperor Sh\u014dwa and Empress K\u014djun, 10 April 1959 In August 1957, she met then-Crown Prince Akihito on a tennis court at Karuizawa near Nagano. The Imperial Household Council formally approved the engagement of the Crown Prince to Michiko Sh\u014dda on 27 November 1958. At that time, the media presented their encounter as a real \"fairy tale\", or the \"romance of the tennis court\". The engagement ceremony took place on 14 January 1959. Michiko and her family in 1969 The future Crown Princess was the daughter of a wealthy industrialist, but she was still a commoner. During the 1950s, the media and most persons familiar with the Japanese monarchy had assumed that the powerful Imperial Household Agency would select a bride for the Crown Prince from the daughters of the former court nobility, or from one of the former branches of the Imperial Family. Some traditionalists opposed the engagement, as Sh\u014dda came from a Roman Catholic family,Herbert P. Bix, Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan, New York, 2001, p. 661 and although she was never baptized, she was educated at Catholic institutions and seemed to share the faith of her parents. It was also widely rumored that Empress K\u014djun had opposed the engagement. After the death of Empress K\u014djun in 2000, Reuters announced that the former Empress was one of the strongest opponents of the marriage, and that in the 1960s, she had driven her daughter-in-law to depression by persistently accusing her of not being suitable for her son. Death threats alerted the authorities to ensure the security of the Sh\u014dda family. Yukio Mishima, known for his traditionalist position, said at the time: \"The imperial system becomes 'tabloidesque' in its move toward democratization. It's all wrong\u2014the idea (of the Imperial Family) losing its dignity by connecting with the people.\" However, the young couple had by then gained wide public support. That support also came from the ruling political class. Additionally, everyone showed affection for the young \"Mitchi\" who had become the symbol of Japan's modernization and democratization (the media at the time hinted at the phenomenon of a \"Mitchi boom\"). The wedding finally took place as a traditional Shinto ceremony on 10 April 1959. The wedding procession was followed in the streets of Tokyo by more than 500,000 people spread over an 8.8 km route, while parts of the wedding were televised, thus making it the first imperial wedding to be made available for public viewership in Japan, drawing about 15 million viewers. In accordance with tradition, Sh\u014dda received a personal emblem (): the white birch of Japan () upon admission to the imperial family. ==Crown Princess== First Lady Nancy Reagan in November 1987 The young couple then moved to , or \"East Palace\", the traditional name of the official residence of the crown prince installed since 1952, located within the grounds of the Akasaka Estate in Motoakasaka, Minato, Tokyo. They left T\u014dg\u016b Palace after her husband acceded to the throne in 1989. The couple have three children: # # # , following her marriage to urban designer Yoshiki Kuroda on 15 November 2005, Princess Nori gave up her imperial title and left the Imperial Family as required by 1947 Imperial Household Law, took the surname of her husband and became known as . In 1963, the Associated Press reported that the Crown Princess, then about three months pregnant, underwent an abortion on 22 March, in Tokyo.\"Japanese Princess Has an Abortion\", The Miami News, 22 March 1963, page 3 As the article stated, \"The operation was advised by her physician, Prof. Takashi Kobayashi, who delivered Michiko's first child, three-year-old Prince Hiro, a spokesman said. The spokesman said it is believed the 28-year-old princess' health has been impaired by a continuous round of official and social functions before pregnancy\". Contrary to the tradition that the children of the imperial family should be separated from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring to raise their children instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country to meet people but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989. She suffered from several nervous breakdowns because of the pressure of the media and, according to Reuters, the attitude of her mother-in-law, that had resulted in particular in making her lose her voice for seven months in the 1960s and again in the fall of 1993. Empress Michiko had to cancel many of her official duties in the spring of 2007, while suffering from mouth ulcers, nosebleeds and intestinal bleeding due to psychological stress, according to her doctors. This would be similar to the situation of her daughter-in-law, Crown Princess Masako, who also underwent several depressions due to the pressures of her position. == Empress of Japan == The Emperor and Empress in April 2014 Upon the death of Emperor Sh\u014dwa on 7 January 1989, Crown Princess Michiko's husband became the 125th Emperor of Japan, and she became empress consort. The new Emperor and Empress were enthroned (Sokui Rei Seiden no Gi) at the Tokyo Imperial Palace on 12 November 1990. Since their enthronement, the imperial couple have visited many countries, and have done much to make the Imperial Family more visible and approachable in contemporary Japan. They also tried to be close to the people, visiting the 47 prefectures of Japan. Her official duties, apart from visits to other countries, are to assist her husband at events and ceremonies, both within and outside the Imperial Palace, receiving official guests including state guests and also to visit the social, cultural and charitable institutions and facilities. For example, in 2007, Michiko performed duties in her official capacity on more than 300 occasions. For many years Akihito and Michiko visited facilities for children on Children's Day and facilities for the elderly on Respect for the Aged Day. The Imperial Household Agency announced that after 2014 they will pass on these duties to the younger generation. Their health has had no bearing on this decision. Following the death of her mother-in-law, Empress Dowager Nagako, on 16 June 2000, she succeeded her as Honorary President of the Japanese Red Cross Society. The Empress feeds mulberry leaves to silkworms in the Imperial Palace Grounds, May 2013 As empress, she was particularly responsible for Momijiyama Imperial Cocoonery, a sericulture farm on the grounds of the imperial palace. She participated in the annual ceremony of harvesting silk, personally feeds silkworms with mulberry leaves and is responsible to take care of them, the frames, and the harvesting. The production and harvesting of silk were part of her ceremonial duties, linked to Shintoism, Japanese culture, and tradition. From 1994 to 2019, the Empress offered a part of the harvested silk of the koishimaru variety (the oldest species now kept in Japan) to the Sh\u014ds\u014din Treasure-house in the Buddhist temple T\u014ddai-ji in Nara to be used for the restoration of its treasures. The Empress is expected to be the embodiment of traditional values such as modesty and purity. She has demonstrated a strong sense of duty throughout her life, which makes her quite popular amongst the Japanese. She takes part in religious ceremonies with her husband, such as visits to Ise Grand Shrine, other Shinto shrines and Imperial mausoleums to pray to the Imperial Family's ancestral spirits. In addition, she is an accomplished classical pianist. The Empress was elevated into the Hall of Fame of International Best Dressed List in 1990. ==Hobbies, passions and literary works== Michiko Sh\u014dda while playing piano in October 1958 The Empress Emerita particularly enjoys reading, music and plays the piano. Moreover, the imperial family has been known for several decades to form, occasionally, a family piano trio, with Crown Prince Akihito playing the cello, Crown Princess Michiko playing the piano, and Prince Naruhito playing the violin. Empress Michiko is also known to be particularly keen on gagaku, a kind of traditional Japanese court music. She is also a fan of poetry, including the works of Michio Mado that she has selected, compiled and translated several of his poems in a series of collection under the titles Dobutsu-tachi (Animals) in 1992 and Fushigina Poketto (The Magic Pocket) in 1998. In June 2013, two collections of the poetry of Michio Mado, which the Empress Emerita had been asked to translate into English in the early Heisei era, Rainbow: Niji and Eraser: Keshigomu, were published. Together with her previously published translations of Michio Mado's poetry, including The Animals: Dobutsu-tachi, the publication of these new books means almost all the translations by the Empress of Mado's poems, which earned him the Hans Christian Andersen Award in 1994 are now published. She has composed several poems, including waka. Some of them have been published: a series of compounds wakas by Akihito and Michiko, Crown Prince and Princess, were published in 1987 and then republished in 1991 under the title Tomoshibi: Light. Finally, a collection of 367 waka by the Empress was published in 1997 under the title , and 53 of them have been translated into French and published in France by Signatura under the title S\u00e9-oto, song of the ford. Pr\u00e9sentation du livre S\u00e9-oto, Le chant du gu\u00e9 de l'imp\u00e9ratrice Michiko sur le site shunkin.net In 1991, she wrote a children's book, illustrated by Wako Takeda: Hajimete no Yamanobori (\"My First Mountain Climb\"). She is a hibernophile with an interest in Children of Lir, recites I See His Blood Upon The Rose by Joseph Plunkett as a party piece, and even speaks passable Irish. ==Health== In August 2019, it was revealed that she was diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer a month prior while undergoing a routine medical appointment, and was scheduled to have the growth removed. In September 2019, it was reported by The Japan Times that the surgery was successful.https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/10/national/science- health/former-empress-michiko-leaves-hospital-breast-cancer/ ==Titles, styles and honours== ===Titles=== * 20 October 1934 \u2013 10 April 1959: **Miss Michiko Sh\u014dda ( Sh\u014dda Michiko) * 10 April 1959 \u2013 7 January 1989: **Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess ( K\u014dtaishi-hi Denka) **Her Imperial Highness The Crown Princess Michiko ( K\u014dtaishi Akihito Shinn\u014d-hi Michiko Denka) * 7 January 1989 \u2013 30 April 2019: **Her Imperial Majesty The Empress ( K\u014dg\u014d Heika) * 1 May 2019 \u2013 present: **Her Imperial Majesty The Empress Emerita ( J\u014dk\u014dg\u014d Heika) ===Honours=== ====National honours==== * : Grand Cordon (Paulownia) of the Order of the Precious Crown * : Knight of the Decoration of the Red Cross * : Recipient of the Red Cross Medal ====Foreign honours==== * : Grand Star of the Decoration for Services to the Republic of Austria * : Grand Cordon of the Order of Leopold I * : Knight of the Order of the Elephant * Ethiopian Imperial Family: Grand Cordon of the Imperial Order of the Queen of Sheba * : Grand Cross of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite * : Grand Cross special class of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany * : Grand Cross of the Order of the Redeemer * : Grand Cross with Chain of the Order of Merit of the Republic of Hungary * : Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic * : Grand Cordon of the Supreme Order of the Renaissance * : Grand Cross of the Order of Vytautas the Great * : Knight of the Order of the Gold Lion of the House of Nassau * : Member of the Order of the Crown of the Realm * : Grand Cross of the Order of Ouissam Alaouite * Nepalese Royal Family: Member of the Royal Order of Ojaswi Rajanya * Nepalese Royal Family: Recipient of the King Birendra Coronation Medal * : Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Netherlands Lion * : Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Olav * : Member of the Order of Gabriela Silang * : Knight of the Order of the White Eagle * : Grand Cross of the Military Order of Saint James of the Sword * : Grand Cross of the Order of Infante Henry * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Charles III * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic * : Member of the Royal Order of the Seraphim * : Dame of the Order of the Royal House of Chakri * : Commemorative Medal on the Occasion of the 60th Anniversary of the Accession to the Throne of H.M.
