    "text": "Most of the families belongs to the Clan of the Slepowron (ancient nobility), one of the original clans, located south of Warsaw, in the Duchy of Mazovia. Then later name spread in to 4 other clans. * One of the later noble family, Gutowski of Guty was settled in Prussia ( 1505 ), Russia ( 1657 ), Austria ( 1783 ) and still exists today. To this generation belongs the old Prussian noble family von Drygalski (von Drigalski) - a line from the Gutowskis, after the acquisition of villages Drygallen, Schlaga and Wirsbinnen / district Lyck in East Prussia in 1505 changed its name to von Drygalski. Also the Rhau von Gutowski of Prussia belonged to this generation, the male line was thought to have been extinct since 1919, due to the turmoil of the world wars. Even the Polish nobility is passed on only by the male descendants. An aristocratic lady, if she marries bourgely, also in Poland her children will not belong to the nobility. She herself remains aristocratic. Anyone carrying a polish noble last name is (unless through change or fraud) is a noble. Slavic nobility is in the blood not a throne. It has been this way before the Slavic people, also referred to as the Sarmatians, moved up to their current location. As the name moves through patriarchal lines, the class status transfers to all the children total and equal.
