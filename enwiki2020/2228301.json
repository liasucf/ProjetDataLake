    "text": "The 1927 Manitoba general election was held on 28 June 1927 to elect Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Manitoba, Canada. This was the first election in Manitoba history to elect members through a single transferable ballot in all constituencies. Ten candidates were elected in Winnipeg, while every other constituency returned members by instant runoff voting. The result was a second consecutive victory for the Progressive Party of Manitoba, which was supported by the United Farmers of Manitoba. The Progressives, led by Premier John Bracken, won twenty-nine seats out of fifty- five to win their second majority government. During the campaign, the Progressives stressed that they were not a party in the traditional sense and promised \"A business (not a party) government\". Many Progressive candidates simply described themselves as Bracken supporters. The Conservatives won fifteen seats under the leadership of Fawcett Taylor, an improvement from seven in the election of 1922. This election re-established the Conservatives as the leading opposition party in Manitoba, and made the party a credible challenger for government in the next election. The Manitoba Liberal Party was unable to regain the support it lost to the Progressive Party in the previous election. The Liberals won seven seats under the new leadership of Hugh Robson, down one from their 1922 total. After the election, many senior Liberals began to work for an electoral alliance with the Progressives. Robson, who opposed this plan, was persuaded to resign as leader in 1930. The alliance was formalized in 1932. The Independent Labour Party fell to three seats, down from six in the previous election. All three members, including party leader John Queen, were elected in the city of Winnipeg. Independent candidate John Edmison was also re-elected in Brandon. Jacob Penner ran in Winnipeg as a Communist candidate, but was not successful. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=2 colspan=2|Party !rowspan=2|Party Leader !rowspan=2|# of candidates !colspan=3|Seats !colspan=3|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1922 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"| John Bracken |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 28 |align=\"right\"| 29 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|32.4% |align=\"right\"| | Conservative |align=\"center\"| Fawcett Taylor |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 7 |align=\"right\"| 15 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|27.2% |align=\"right\"| | Liberal |align=\"center\"| Hugh Robson |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 8 |align=\"right\"| 7 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|20.7% |align=\"right\"| | Independent Labour |align=\"center\"| John Queen |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 6 |align=\"right\"| 3 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|10.5% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"center\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| | colspan=2|Independent |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 1 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |- |colspan=3| Total |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 55 |align=\"right\"| 55 |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |} ==See also== * List of Manitoba political parties ==Results by electoral division== Quotas in the single-member districts are the simple majority (50 percent plus 1). The ballot-counting process in this constituency was extremely controversial. Laurendeau was eliminated after the first count, and Hyman was eliminated after the second count. Gagnon was originally declared the winner on the third count by a single vote, but Bernier appealed the decision and was declared elected on recount. The final totals were: Bernier 2646, Gagnon 2618.
