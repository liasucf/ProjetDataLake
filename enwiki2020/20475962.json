    "text": "The German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech) is a private university in Halban, Sultanate of Oman. It was established in 2007 in Muscat in collaboration with RWTH Aachen University in Germany, one of the leading and top-ranked universities of technology in Europe. GUtech was one of the first universities in Oman to receive international accreditation for all its BSc and BEng programs. In the Academic Year 2019 more than 2200 students were enrolled in GUtech\u2019s programs. ==History== The history of the German University of Technology (GUtech) can be traced back to 2003. RWTH Aachen University in Germany was approached with the intention of bringing German excellence in education to Oman. After a few years of discussion and negotiation, the founders were ready to begin a plan of action for establishing a university. In August 2006, Oman Educational Services L.L.C. (OES), a limited liability company under the laws of the Sultanate of Oman, was incorporated to establish a university on a formal footing. OES is the legal entity responsible for initiating education-related projects. A Collaborative Agreement between RWTH Aachen University and OES was signed in December 2006, paving the way for the establishment of a private university in the Sultanate of Oman. This cemented the groundwork for everything the founder envisioned: a high-quality university of technology in of Oman. Specifically, the agreement laid the framework for collaboration between OES and RWTH Aachen University in terms of academic curricula, quality assurance and expertise, and setting up a technological university. All GUtech programmes have been developed in cooperation of GUtech with RWTH Aachen University in Germany. In March 2007, The Ministry of Higher Education of the Sultanate of Oman issued a Ministerial Decision No. 9/2007 for the establishment of the Oman German University of Technology (OGTech). This was followed by the development of four Bachelor of Science programmes of study, namely: Sustainable Tourism and Regional Development, Urban Planning and Architectural Design, Applied Geosciences, Applied Information Technology. In September 2007, the university opened its doors to students in rented premises in Athaibah. Initially, sixty (60) Omani male and female students joined the Foundation Year Programme (FYP). A preparatory study programme that acts as a bridge between high school and university education. In 2008, the name of the university was changed to the German University of Technology in Oman (GUtech). Shortly thereafter, in July 2009, GUtech received international accreditation by ACQUIN, a German- based accreditation agency, for its Bachelor of Science programs. With a continuously growing reputation, the university added new Bachelor of Engineering programmes, namely: Process Engineering and Mechanical Engineering. With the same expansionary spirit, the university opened a second campus in October 2010. Given its location beside Muscat International Airport, the campus was known as the Airport Campus where all bachelor degree programmes were taught. In 2011, the Bachelor of Engineering in Environmental Engineering was introduced, along with the first Master programme, in Petroleum Geoscience. An architecture office was commissioned to design a building for the university that would reflect Oman heritage and German precision. In 2011, construction work began to establish a campus in the Halban area. In September 2012, GUtech moved into its permanent campus in Halban, the first-ever Green Campus in Oman. A campus in Halban that comprises a total area of 500,000 m\u00b2. The building earned the 2013 award of the best commercial building of the year in Oman and in the Middle East. ==Affiliation with RWTH Aachen University == GUtech is affiliated to RWTH Aachen University in Germany. ==Academic programs== The university offers full-time Bachelor of Science (BSc), Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) as well as part-time Master of Science programs. Additionally, the University offers a GUtech Foundation Programme. The Foundation Programme has been designed to equip students with the skills required to succeed in the Bachelor programmes. Whereas the Core Studies Program mainly provides students with the necessary English language skills, the Academic Studies Program is made up of different modules including economics, mathematics, information technology, sciences and creative design. ===Bachelor of science programs=== * BSc in Applied Geosciences *BSc in Computer Science *BSc in International Business and Service Management *BSc in Urban Planning and Architectural Design ===Bachelor of engineering programs=== *BEng in Mechanical Engineering *BEng in Process Engineering *BEng in Environmental Engineering ===Master of Science Programs=== *MSc in Applied Geoscience (part-time) The language of tuition at GUtech is English, German is taught as an additional foreign language. ==Students== In the summer semester 2019 approx. 2200 students were enrolled in different programs at GUtech, about 8 per cent of them were international students. Each year students receive financial aid and scholarships from different sources either from industry or government like Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy), German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD), the Ministry of Higher Education, Oman International Fertilizer Company (OMIFCO), OMRAN and Oman Educational Services (OES). The entry requirements depend on the program and the level of entrance. For example, to enter directly into one of the Bachelor programs, students need to submit IELTS results of at least 6.0, or equivalent TOEFL results. The applicant may also need to pass a GUtech entrance examination. ==International accreditation== GUtech was the first private university in the Sultanate that received international accreditation for all Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Engineering programs by the international Accreditation, Certification and Quality Assurance Institute (ACQUIN) in June 2009. ACQUIN is a non-profit agency committed to supporting the enhancement of quality standards for teaching and learning in higher education worldwide. It is a full member of the European Association for Quality Assurance in Higher Education and operates in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Middle and Eastern Europe, North Africa, the Near and Middle East. The international accreditation of GUtech is an assurance that students are receiving a world-class higher education in Oman. It also means that graduates have the possibility to continue their studies at RWTH Aachen University in Germany or at any other university of their choice - depending on the individual entry requirements of the respective university. ==Organizational structure== GUtech is owned by private Omani shareholders (OES), who are represented by the Board of Directors (BoD). The managing board of GUtech is the Board of Governors (BoG). Members of the Board of Governors are representatives of the shareholders, of RWTH Aachen University as well as of the governmental sector of both Oman and Germany.
