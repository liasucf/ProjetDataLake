Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n was a pioneer of Mexican gastronomy and an entrepreneur of Mexican cuisine. == Early life and family == Josefina Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n was born in 1889 in Aguascalientes. Her mother was Mar\u00eda Pe\u00f3n Valdez, a member of a socially prominent family from Guadalajara. Her father's family was one of the most distinguished families in Mexico--a family dating back to the conquistador Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar. Josefina was the oldest of four daughters. The family moved to Mexico City shortly before the youngest daughter, Mar\u00eda Luisa, was born in 1905. Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n married businessman Joaqu\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez just before her thirtieth birthday and Gonz\u00e1lez died eleven months later. The two had no children together and Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n never remarried. == Career == During the 1930s Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n published recipes in the Poblano publication Mignon Magazine. These recipes were focused on home cooking and giving guidelines to women about how to start a small home business. This experience led her to form the Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n Cooking Academy by the end of the decade. In the cooking school, Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n traveled to various states of the country promoting a national gastronomy proposal based on the relationship between good eating, family spending, nutrition, history, and regional cuisine. Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n promoted a revaluation of home cooking in addition to classifying and cataloging the diversity of dishes of national cuisine. In her cooking classes she taught modules and subjects such as: daily simple cooking, modern cooking, haute cuisine, simple baking, artistic jellies, and Mexican specialties. In the late 1930s, she published her first cookbook Manual practico de cocina reposter\u00eda. By the mid-1940s, Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n started her publishing house, Ediciones J. Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n, which was dedicated exclusively to publishing Mexican and international cookbooks. Publications were distributed through correspondence, sending classes to students in other states by mail until the 1960s, making her a pioneer in this field. Her work Platillos regionales de la Rep\u00fablica Mexicana (1946) highlighted the culinary identity and characteristics of the food from more than half of the Mexican states. In her book, C\u00f3mo cocinar en los aparatos modernos (1949), she updated cooking techniques by teaching how to cook in Presto's express cooker, Ekco's miracle oven, and Oster's and Sunbeam's electric mixers. Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n ultimately published more than 140 cookbooks across her career. Cover of the book \"La cocina en el aire\" by Josefina Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n. In addition to publishing, Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n ventured into radio and television broadcasting. In February 1946, she launched her daily radio show La flojera en la cocina on station XEW. Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n created programming for other Mexico City radio stations as well, XEQ, XEK, and XEJP, and eventually compiled many of the featured recipes into a book entitled La cocina en el aire. In the early 1950s, she developed the first cooking program for Mexican television, entitled El Menu de la Semana. As with her radio program, El Menu de la Semana resulted in publications, namely a series of Tele-cocina booklets. Her motto was \"saber cocinar es la base de la econom\u00eda\" or \"knowing how to cook is the basis of the economy\". Upon her death, her sisters attempted to carry on her legacy, but eventually the Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n Cooking Academy closed its doors and the rights to her books were sold. == Legacy == Many famous chefs have been influenced by Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n's work. It was Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n's documentation of regional cuisines that first inspired Diana Kennedy to travel around Mexico documenting traditional recipes. Rick Bayless was similarly inspired by Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n's work stating that Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n \"gave a national face to regional Mexican cuisine. She carried a banner that said, \u2018We\u2019re all Mexican: Veracruz Mexican, Oaxacan Mexican, Yucatecan Mexican.'\u201d Many notable libraries with Mexican gastronomy collections hold Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n's works. Among these collections are the Fundaci\u00f3n Herdez \u201cJosefina Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n\u201d collection, and The University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries Special Collections Mexican Cookbook Collection. ==Bibliography== *Josefina Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n bibliography == References == == Further reading == * * Category:Mexican chefs Category:20th-century Mexican women writers Category:1899 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Writers from Aguascalientes Category:Cookbook writers Category:20th-century Mexican writers ",
