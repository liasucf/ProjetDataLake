    "text": "In mathematics, a natural number n is a Blum integer if n = p\u00d7q is a semiprime for which p and q are distinct prime numbers congruent to 3 mod 4.Joe Hurd, Blum Integers (1997), retrieved 17 Jan, 2011 from http://www.gilith.com/research/talks/cambridge1997.pdf That is, p and q must be of the form 4t + 3, for some integer t. Integers of this form are referred to as Blum primes.Goldwasser, S. and Bellare, M. \"Lecture Notes on Cryptography\". Summer course on cryptography, MIT, 1996-2001 This means that the factors of a Blum integer are Gaussian primes with no imaginary part. The first few Blum integers are :21, 33, 57, 69, 77, 93, 129, 133, 141, 161, 177, 201, 209, 213, 217, 237, 249, 253, 301, 309, 321, 329, 341, 381, 393, 413, 417, 437, 453, 469, 473, 489, 497, ... The integers were named for computer scientist Manuel Blum. ==Properties== Given n = p\u00d7q a Blum integer, Qn the set of all quadratic residues modulo n and coprime to n and a \u2208 Qn. Then: *a has four square roots modulo n, exactly one of which is also in Qn *The unique square root of a in Qn is called the principal square root of a modulo n *The function f: Qn \u2192 Qn defined by f(x) = x2 mod n is a permutation. The inverse function of f is: f \u22121(x) = x((p \u2212 1)(q \u2212 1) + 4)/8 mod n. *For every Blum integer n, \u22121 has a Jacobi symbol mod n of +1, although \u22121 is not a quadratic residue of n: :: \\left(\\frac{-1}{n}\\right)=\\left(\\frac{-1}{p}\\right)\\left(\\frac{-1}{q}\\right)=(-1)^2=1 ==History== Before modern factoring algorithms, such as MPQS and NFS, were developed, it was thought to be useful to select Blum integers as RSA moduli. This is no longer regarded as a useful precaution, since MPQS and NFS are able to factor Blum integers with the same ease as RSA moduli constructed from randomly selected primes. ==References== Category:Integer sequences ",
