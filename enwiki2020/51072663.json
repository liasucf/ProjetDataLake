The area frequently experiences foggy weather and thus has a high rate of automobile collisions. According to the narrative, a woman can sometimes be seen along the side of the road wearing sunglasses. Upon closer inspection it is revealed that the so-called sunglasses are actually the woman's gouged-out eyes. Another version of the narrative has a driver picking up the ghost, only for the ghost to direct the driver to a cemetery or disappear when the driver reaches the destination. ==See also== *List of streets in Seoul *Olympicdaero *Gimpo Hangang Highway *List of Korea-related topics Category:1992 establishments in South Korea Category:Roads in Seoul Category:Roads in Gyeonggi ",
