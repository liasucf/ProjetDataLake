The view north towards Ross-on-Wye from Symonds Yat Rock, in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire == Origin and variants == Dean is thought to be a habitational name from any of several places in various parts of England that are known by a variation of the name. The first bearers of the name lived in Anglo-Saxon England in mountainous or hilly areas where they would have adopted the name as a habitational marker. The surname is historically concentrated in the West Country in South West England, particularly in and around the county of Gloucestershire, Retrieved 29 June 2018 and there are several places called Dean in the area (including other areas of Southern England), suggesting that this region may be the surname\u2019s likely area of origin. Dean and Deane are also historically found as surnames in Scotland and Ireland. Perhaps less likely, it may also be a descriptive name for someone thought to resemble an ecclesiastical Dean, or an occupational name associated with the servant of a Dean, derived from the Middle English word \"deen,\" which is itself ultimately derived from the Latin word \"decanus\" (modern English, Deacon), meaning \"a leader of ten men\". Recorded usage of the name dates back to the late 11th century when it was recorded as the surname of several individuals. The first known person on record to use the Dean surname appears to have been an individual named Robert de Dene, who was a \"Pincema\", or, an official in charge of wine and beverage for King Edward the Confessor (1042\u20131066). His descendants, known as Denn or Denne, were landowners in Kent and Sussex, but apparently died out by the 1600s. Another known early Dean was an individual named Ralph De Dene, who was recorded in the Domesday Book for Sussex during the reign of William the Conqueror (1066\u20131087) in 1086. The official use of surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. Until the gradual standardization of English spelling in the last few centuries however, English lacked any comprehensive system of spelling. Consequently, spelling variations in names are frequently found in early Anglo-Saxon and later Anglo-Norman documents, meaning that a person's name was often spelled several different ways over a lifetime. As such, different variations of the Dean surname usually have the same origin. == Notable people with the surname == * Angela Dean, British statistician * Anna-Maria Ravnopolska-Dean, harpist * Bashford Dean, American ornithologist * Brenda Dean (1943\u20132018), British trade unionist and politician * Brett Dean (born 1961), Australian composer * Charles Dean (died 1974), deceased brother of Howard Dean and Jim Dean * Charmaine Dean (born 1958), statistician from Trinidad, president of Statistical Society of Canada * Christopher Dean, British figure skater * Dean (Middlesex cricketer) (fl. 1787\u20131790), amateur cricketer from Middlesex * Dixie Dean, English footballer * Dizzy Dean (1910\u20131974), baseball pitcher * Dora Dean (c. 1872\u20131949), vaudeville dancer * Eddie Dean (disambiguation), several people * Elton Dean, jazz musician * Everett Dean (1898\u20131993), American college sports coach * Fred Dean (born 1952), American football player * Gordon Dean (disambiguation), several people * Henry Clay Dean, American orator and author * Howard Dean, U.S. presidential candidate in 2004 elections * Jamel Dean (born 1996), American football player * James Dean (disambiguation), other people with this name or variants such as Jim or Jimmy * James Dean (1931\u20131955), American actor * Janet Dean, later Janet Dean Fodor, American professor of linguistics * Jim Dean (activist), chairman of Democracy for America * Jimmy Dean (1928\u20132010), American singer and actor * Joe Dean (1930\u20132013), American basketball player, sportscaster, and sports administrator * John Dean (born 1938), White House counsel to President Richard M.
