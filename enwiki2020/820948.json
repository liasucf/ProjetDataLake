The stadium is owned by Boca Juniors, one of Argentina's top football clubs, The unusual shape of the stadium has led to it having excellent acoustics and the Boca support being nicknamed \"La Doce (The 12th man\"). The pitch at La Bombonera is the minimum size required under FIFA regulations - 105m x 68m. The stadium is widely regarded as one of the most emblematic stadiums of the world,50 Sports Venues to Visit Before You Die, Bleacher Report, 26 Sep 2012Boca v.

Previous to La Bombonera, Boca Juniors had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. The club's first ground had been located in D\u00e1rsena SurCien a\u00f1os de multitud: El per\u00edodo amateur (1905\u20131930) by Horacio D. Rosatti \u2013 Ed.

The club built a stadium there.\"La Bombonera\" on Planeta Boca Juniors This would be used as their home venue until the construction of La Bombonera at the same location. In 1931, Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands from the Municipality of Buenos Aires for A$ 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to built its new stadium.Memoria y balance de la AFA 1934 - P\u00e1g. 101 The project was finally granted to the Delpini-Sulcic-Bes architectural office.El arquitecto olvidado, P\u00e1gina/12, 11 Apr 2010 which would be also design the Abasto Shopping in the 1990s. The old stadium (still with wooden grandstands) was used for the last time on April 10, 1938, before being demolished to build the new stadium at the same location. While La Bombonera was under construction, Boca Juniors played their home games at Ferro Carril Oeste stadium. === Opening and later refurbishments === The stadium under construction. The stadium finally opened on May 25, 1940, with a friendly match between Boca and San Lorenzo, which the home side won 2\u20130 with both goals scored by Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n. Due to the fact that the stadium did not have a lighting system, the game only lasted 70' (two halves of 35' each). The first official game at the new stadium was on June 2, 1940, when Boca Juniors beat Newell's Old Boys 2\u20130. Ricardo Alarc\u00f3n (who had scored in the opening game v. San Lorenzo) scored the first official goal at the new venue.Juniors 2 - Newell's 0 on Historia de Boca Plaque donated by San Lorenzo de Almagro on the occasion of the inauguration of La Bombonera, May 1940. After the stadium was inaugurated, the club continued to introduce refurbishments to expand its capacity. As a result, on November 16, 1941, a second tier was opened on the north side of the stadium, near Casa Amarilla train station. The grandstand was named \"Natalio Pescia\" in honour of one of the key players in Boca Juniors' history.El Le\u00f3n de la defensa on Museo Boquense In 1949 the club decided to add a third tier, adding also a lighting system. All of those works were completed in 1953; this third tier gave the stadium its enduring nickname: La Bombonera. Boca Juniors celebrated with a friendly match v. Yugoslav club NK Hajduk Split, which ended 1\u20131.Boca Juniors 1 - Hajduk Split (Yugoslavia) 1 on Historia de Boca La Bombonera during a night game v. Colo Colo, with the refurbished boxes at right, March 2008. The stadium was named on April 20, 1986, by team President Antonio Alegre in honor of Camilo Cichero, a former team president under whose tenure work on La Bombonera began. It was renamed on December 27, 2000, by team President Mauricio Macri in honor of Alberto Armando, team president during its resurgence during the 1960s as well as a former business partner of his father Francisco Macri. The stadium was expanded and modernized during Macri's tenure, notably with the addition in 1996 of a fourth tier; and a wing housing a press area, VIP boxes, a museum, and offices. The stadium's exterior was later decorated with works by painters R\u00f3mulo Macci\u00f3 and P\u00e9rez Celis. Since then, La Bombonera was not remodeled until 1996 when the presidency of Mauricio Macri decided to expand its capacity to 57,500 spectators. Works included the demolition of the lateral boxes on Del Valle Iberlucea street, replacing them by a small stand and new and modern boxes (with metallic structure) placed over there. The \"new\" Bombonera was reinaugurated with a friendly match v. Club Universidad de Chile won by Boca Juniors by 3\u20131.Boca Juniors 3 \u2013\u2013 Universidad (Chi) 1 An electronic screen was installed in 2008,Lo miran por TV by Horacio Garc\u00eda on Ol\u00e9, 21 Jan 2008 making Boca Juniors' stadium the third venue in Argentina with this technology, after the stadiums of V\u00e9lez S\u00e1rsfield and River Plate. At the beginning of 2012, more than 500 seats were replaced and other 500 were added, part of the building of four additional boxes. ==Origin of the name== The stadium is popularly known as La Bombonera. It is said that the nickname came along the project of Viktor Sul\u010di\u010d during the process of development. On occasion of Sul\u010di\u010d's birthday, a friend gave him a box of chocolates as a gift. After that, Sul\u010di\u010d used to go with the box at meetings with engineer Delpine and other persons that collaborated with the project to show them that the box shape was very like the one of the stadium they were designing. Since then, the stadium would be known as La Bombonera (\"box of chocolates\" in Spanish) and that name has remained to present days. In fact, the opening day (May 25, 1940) the stadium was named that way even by the club executives.Una caja de bombones de regalo, P\u00e1gina/12, 26 Apr 2010 Nevertheless, there are other stories or myths about the origin of the nickname. One of them tells that Delpini projected the stands with a highly vertical grade of inclination to host 100,000 persons (which was the first project). The shape of the stands looked like the carts used to collect horses dung in the streets of Buenos Aires. Other version credits journalist Hugo Marini or broadcaster Joaqu\u00edn Carballo Serantes (aka) \"Fioravanti\" for the Bombonera nickname.La vida color de Boca, 100 a\u00f1os de una pasi\u00f3n argentina, vol. 1, published by La Naci\u00f3n, March 2005 Despite its distinguished nickname, the first official denomination came on April 20, 1986, when it was named \"Camilo Cichero\" in commemoration of the president under whose tenure the stadium was projected and built.LA BOMBONERA. UNA HISTORIA DE IDENTIDAD Y MISTICA by Arq. Pablo F. Abb\u00e1tangelo on Conexion2000.com.ar That same day Boca Juniors defeated Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba by 4\u20132. Nevertheless, president Mauricio Macri decided to change the stadium's name to \"Alberto J. Armando\", honoring long-time president of the club during two periods (1954\u201355, 1960\u201380).Los momentos de Mauricio Macri en Boca que marcaron su perfil pol\u00edtico, Infobae.com, 23 Nov 2015 ==Facilities== La Bombonera currently has a capacity of around 48,000 and the club's popularity make tickets hard to find, especially for the Supercl\u00e1sico derby against River Plate. Out of its capacity of 49,000, there are 37,538 seats, 2,780 in boxes, and 8,682 standing. Both its interior and exterior are lined with a number of murals painted by the artist P\u00e9rez Celis depicting many of the club's legendary players and aspects of the district's culture, such as the life of Italian immigrants. In 1996 a small stand was built on the 4th side, which had been largely open until then, except for some VIP boxes. Diego Maradona, who played for and supports Boca Juniors, has his own executive box at the stadium. There are three parking lots at the stadium for members. ==Argentina national team on La Bombonera== The national team has played several games in La Bombonera, including qualifying matches to the FIFA World Cup. The squad played the most games since the 1920s to the mid-1970s. Since the Estadio Monumental of River Plate was completely refurbished for the 1978 WC, the Argentine Football Association fixtured the majority of Argentina's home games at that venue. That decision was based on the Monumental higher capacity and modern facilities in comparison with La Bombonera. Playing at Boca Juniors stadium, Argentina was only defeated in two games, having played a total of 27 matches, winning 18 and losing 2 with 7 ties. The squad scored 67 goals and only conceded 27.ARGENTINA NATIONAL TEAM ARCHIVE by H\u00e9ctor D.

It is located within the stadium, just below the grandstands. The Museum was built on two floors and chronicles the club's rise from 1905 (the year the club was established) to the present day. One of the exhibits in the museum is a giant football with 360-degree footage of the club's fans and players at a match. The museum also includes a Hall of fame and a large mural of Diego Maradona. Also included are non- football items such as the specially commissioned blue and gold guitar played by Lenny Kravitz when he performed at La Bombonera in 2005. A giant statue of Boca Juniors' all-time topscorer, Mart\u00edn Palermo, was unveiled in 2011. Other former players who have their statues honoring them are Diego Maradona and Rom\u00e1n Riquelme\"Palermo ya tiene su estatua gigante\" Diario La Raz\u00f3n, Fecha: 20/08/2011 A total of seven Boca Juniors idols have been honored by the club with their respective monuments, they are Guillermo Barros Schelotto, Angel Clemente Rojas, Silvio Marzolini and Antonio Ratt\u00edn, apart from Maradona, Palermo and Riquelme. Carlos Bianchi was the first Boca Juniors manager to be honored with a statue, when a monument of his figure was unveiled in October 2016. Bianchi won 9 titles during his two tenures on the club (1998\u20132003), becoming the most winning manager in Boca Juniors' history. Under Bianchi's coaching, the team also set a record of 40 matches unbeaten, the biggest since Argentine football became professional in 1931.El DT m\u00e1s ganador de la historia de Boca fue homenajeado con una pieza que se ubicar\u00e1 en el Museo del club; adem\u00e1s, se llev\u00f3 una r\u00e9plica en miniatura by Patricio Ins\u00faa, La Naci\u00f3n, 7 Oct 2016 ==Redevelopment== There are planned improvements for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, use of new technology in the stadium and improved corporate facilities.
