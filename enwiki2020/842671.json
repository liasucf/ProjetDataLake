    "text": "Jacques Pierre Paul Raverat (pronounced Rav-er-ah) (March 20, 1885- March 6, 1925) was a French painter; Raverat was the son of Georges Pierre Raverat and Helena Lorena Raverat, n\u00e9e Caron; he was born in Paris, France in 1885. Revert started at Bedales School in Steep, Hampshire in 1898. From Bedales, he went up to Jesus College, Cambridge. He married the English painter and wood engraver Gwen Darwin, in 1911, the daughter of George Darwin and Lady Maud Darwin, n\u00e9e Maud du Puy; she was a granddaughter of Charles Darwin. They had two daughters, Elisabeth (1916\u20132014), who married the Norwegian politician Edvard Hambro, and Sophie Jane (1919-2011) who married the Cambridge scholar M. G. M. Pryor and later Charles Gurney. Raverat suffered from a form of multiple sclerosis and died on March 6 1925 following complications of it. His funeral took place in Christ Church in Cannes, France where he may be buried. Before moving, in 1920, to Vence in France the couple were active members of an intellectual circle known as the \"Neo-Pagans\" and centred round Rupert Brooke. They also moved on the fringes of the Bloomsbury Group, whose members included Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, Vanessa Bell and Lytton Strachey. In 2004, his grandson, William Pryor edited the complete correspondence between Raverat, his wife and Virginia Woolf which was published as Virginia Woolf and the Raverats. ==References== ==See also== *List of Bloomsbury Group people Category:1885 births Category:1925 deaths Category:People educated at Bedales School Category:20th-century French painters Category:20th-century male artists Category:French male painters ",
