He joined the army at age 17, and later became a policeman. In 1986, he started a career as a fashion and TV photographer. In 1989, he took part in launching the magazine Hot Video, as a reporter. Beginning in 1992, he worked for Private Media Group, Inc., for which he made several movies, such as The Pyramid, Tatiana, and Riviera. ==Movies== Woodman, staff and actors at a film set in Australia In 1997, he launched his series \"Casting X\" (see below), which is now the longest-running and subsequently as well biggest-selling series in the X-rated category in the world. In 1999, Woodman began to produce and release his Superfuckers series for Private, which ran to 12 chapters. At the end of the year, he received an invitation from Larry Flynt, owner of LFP, Inc. and a publisher of the magazine Hustler. Woodman began Chapter 13 of Superfuckers for LFP. Flynt spent little on advertising, relying instead solely on the Hustler name and word of mouth to sell products. This bothered Woodman, who made a few big-budget movies, such as Brazilian Snake (2001), Brazilian Snake 2 (2002) and Manipulation (2004), but refused to sign a new contract for LFP in 2005. In 2004, after playing himself in the Spanish film Yo Puta, alongside Denise Richards and Daryl Hannah, he did several photo- shoots for fashion magazines, such as Vogue and Blast. Woodman then launched a program affiliation on the Internet called \"Spider-Cash\", to distribute its films in the form of video sequences, after Berth Milton, head of Private, asked Woodman to return to work for him in 2005. Woodman made Sex City, a \"porn-remake\" that \"borrows\" much of the storyline of Frank Miller's Sin City, including the use of black-and-white photography with splashes of color inserted throughout the film. Woodman's Sex City was filmed entirely in high definition. The first part was released in May 2006. After five weeks, the film became the best selling in the history of Private, even taking the lead in sales in the U.S. on June 5, 2006. Nevertheless, in June 2006 Woodman announced that he was leaving Private Media Group for the second time and undertaking his own production and distribution company, Woodman Entertainment, based in Barcelona, where Private Media is also based. From there, he directed a high budget remake of the film Excalibur. This film, titled ', was released in May 2007 and draws on a cast of 75 actors and 250 extras, a first in the world of porn. Woodman continues to work in the fashion world, doing photo-sessions for magazines (Blast magazine cover and layout Sept. 2006) and discovering fashion models from his castings. ===\"Castings X\" productions === Woodman started with his supposed \"casting\" film series for Private in 1992. According to Woodman's marketing, he claims there was no explicit commercial motivation behind them, but eventually this is how the \"Castings X\" and \"Behind the Scenes\" series began. Woodman's marketing claims he recorded video only as a protection against any allegations that might be made of sexual assault, a precaution he thought especially appropriate after boxer Mike Tyson was convicted of rape in an Indianapolis hotel room in 1992. With the breakup of the former Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Central and Eastern Europe became a new center of pornographic production. Actresses were available for a fraction of the cost of American performers. Since 1992, Woodman has spent considerable time in Eastern Europe. This is how he introduced some stars in the porn world to Western audiences. Woodman's \"Castings X\" DVDs, which began to be released in October 1997.

In April 2008, Woodman announced that Woodman Entertainment would begin new issues of the Casting X series in June 2008. The scenes are typically filmed in hotel rooms, usually in Central Europe. The actresses do not really know what the fake porn director does. Woodman shows the girls a Private magazine or some pornographic images and then inviting them to do something similar to what's displayed in the images. Woodman has already released 103 DVDs from his \"Casting X\" series, featuring mostly European actresses. In an interview, he claimed to have more than 7,000 scenes in stock. In 2009, the Netherlands branch of HBO TV made a 52-minute report about his life called \"Pierre Woodman Story\". ==Controversies== In 2013, following the airing of a documentary on Woodman, the French online magazine Le Tag Parfait published an article that charged the director with forcing unsuspecting performers into engaging in unplanned sexual acts with him. In 2017, Lana Rhoades accused Woodman of coercing her into performing acts she did not want to during a shoot and that he allegedly admitted to her to violating another woman's rights. ==Personal life== Pierre Woodman and Sophie Paris. Woodman has been married three times and is the father of three children. He was divorced from the Russian porn star Tania Russof in 2000 and since 2002, has lived with the photo model Sophie Paris.
