    "text": "In his work on set theory, Georg Cantor denoted the collection of all cardinal numbers by the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, ' (transliterated as Tav', Taw, or Sav.) As Cantor realized, this collection could not itself have a cardinality, as this would lead to a paradox of the Burali-Forti type. Cantor instead said that it was an \"inconsistent\" collection which was absolutely infinite.The Correspondence between Georg Cantor and Philip Jourdain, I.
