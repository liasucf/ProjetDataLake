After his stay at the Villa Medici in Rome, the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale performed his Divertissement for Orchestra in Paris in 1939. The Second World War interrupted his musical career, but during this time he composed the Symphony \"La Lib\u00e9ration\", which was premiered on the radio in 1945 and by the Concerts Colonne in 1948 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet under the direction of Paul Paray. Among his other works are the Deux pi\u00e8ces pour fl\u00fbte seule: Bucolique, Iberica (1964) and the Concerto pour piano et orchestre (1968). He also composed several transcriptions of works by other composers for violin and orchestra, including George Enescu's First Romanian Rhapsody. == Compositions == === Classical works (selection) === *1935: Cantata Le Ch\u00e2teau endormi (deuxi\u00e8me Second Grand Prix de Rome) *1936: Cantata Gis\u00e8le (Premier Grand Prix de Rome) *1939: Divertissement for small orchestra *1945: Symphony La Lib\u00e9ration in E *1964: Bucolique and Iberica, two pieces for flute solo *1968: Concerto for piano and orchestraMarcel Stern (1909-1989) : Piano Concerto (YouTube) === Cinema === Marcel Stern also distinguished himself in the field of film music.
