    "text": "Hilsea railway station is a railway station in Portsmouth, England serving the northern end of Portsea Island, including a large industrial estate nearby. It is located on the Portsmouth Direct line which runs between London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. There were extensive sidings at Hilsea during World War II. This railway station is mainly used by commuters who work in nearby Anchorage Park industrial estate. Only stopping trains stop here. The station is unmanned. Historically, during the Battle of Havant, Hilsea was the terminus of an omnibus link from Havant New, just east of Havant. When the Portsmouth Direct Line had been constructed by the LSWR, at the request of the residents of Portsmouth, it was necessary that trains run from the Portcreek Junction railway triangle, to Havant Junction, along track owned by the rival LBSCR. The latter firm refused to allow that and engaged in militant obstruction of the track to prevent the running of a through train service for several months. == Services == Services at Hilsea are operated by Southern and South Western Railway.
