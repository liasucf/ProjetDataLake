    "text": "Human behavior co-constituting the web. Web science is an emerging interdisciplinary field concerned with the study of large-scale socio- technical systems, particularly the World Wide Web. It considers the relationship between people and technology, the ways that society and technology co-constitute one another and the impact of this co-constitution on broader society. Web Science combines research from disciplines as diverse as sociology, computer science, economics, and mathematics. An earlier definition was given by American computer scientist Ben Shneiderman: \"Web Science\" is processing the information available on the web in similar terms to those applied to natural environment. The Web Science Institute describes Web Science as focusing \"the analytical power of researchers from disciplines as diverse as mathematics, sociology, economics, psychology, law and computer science to understand and explain the Web. It is necessarily interdisciplinary \u2013 as much about social and organizational behaviour as about the underpinning technology.\" == Research groups == There are numerous academic research groups engaged in Web Science research, many of which are members of WSTNet, the Web Science Trust Network of research labs. Health Web Science emerged as a sub- discipline of Web Science that studies the role of the Web's impact on human's health outcomes and how to further utilize the Web to improve health outcomes.http://www.websci11.org/workshops/health-web-science- workshop/>http://www.websci12.org/workshops/health-web-science-workshop == Related major conferences == * Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Hypertext Conference (HT) sponsored by SIGWEB * ACM SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI) * International AAAI Conference on Weblogs and Social Media (ICWSM) * The Web Conference (WWW) * Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Web Science Conference (WebSci) == See also == * Digital anthropology * Digital sociology * Health Web Science * Sociology of the Internet * Technology and society * Web Science Trust == References == == External links == * A Framework for Web Science * Talk on web science by W3C * MSc on Web Science at Institute WeST, University of Koblenz-Landau, Germany * MSc on Web Sciences divided into different branches of study at Johannes Kepler University Linz, Austria * * The Web Science Education Workshop * The Web Science Education Map * Master's Programme WebScience at Cologne University of Applied Sciences * The Web Science Institute at the University of Southampton Category:World Wide Web Category:Cyberspace Category:Digital media ",
