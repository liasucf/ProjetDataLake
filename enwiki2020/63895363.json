    "text": "Ilyinsky Church of Chernigov and the ancient monastic caves located under it have been under the jurisdiction of the museum since Soviet times. Excavations were carried out here and the kimitria (ossuary with Athos-type burials) was discovered. The history of Saint Anthony caves started in the second half of the nineteenth century when Anthony of Kiev came to Boldyna Hora. The place had unique power, so he dug out a cave for solitude and prayers. Chernihiv and Kiev were the largest centres of the Kievan Rus, and they faced constant confrontation. To keep up with Kiev's pace, the first church of the contemporary Trinity Monastery complex appeared a century later. The total length of the Chernihiv underground premises is about 350 meters (1148 feet). ==See also== * Near Caves of the Kiev Pechersk Lavra system ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Chernihiv Oblast Category:Caves of Ukraine Category:Chernihiv ",
