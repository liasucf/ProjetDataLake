    "text": "\"Bitch Better Have My Money\" (otherwise known in clean and radio versions as \"B**** Better Have My Money\" or simply \"Better Have My Money\") is a song recorded by Barbadian singer Rihanna. It was written by Jamille Pierre, Bibi Bourelly, Rihanna, Travis Scott, Kanye West and WondaGurl and produced by Deputy, co-produced by West, together with additional production by Scott and WondaGurl. The song was digitally released on March 26, 2015, through the iTunes Store. \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" is a trap song and represents a notable musical departure from the previous single, \"FourFiveSeconds\". Upon release critics gave the song mixed reviews, finding the song catchy and ready to be played in clubs, but thought it was a step down from the preceding single. \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" reached the top-10 in eight countries, including New Zealand and France, as well as the top-20 in six more countries including Canada, the United States and Australia. To promote the song, Rihanna performed at the 2nd iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 29, 2015. A accompanying music video was released on July 2, 2015. ==Production and composition== Travis Scott co-wrote and co-produced the song. \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" was written by Jamille Pierre, Bibi Bourelly, Rihanna, Travis Scott, Kanye West and Ebony \"WondaGurl\" Oshunrinde and produced by Deputy, Scott, West and WondaGurl. The song was conceived in producer Deputy's apartment and consisted of a simple beat. Development continued when the producer had a session with writer Bibi Bourelly, who went into the recording studio and began to freestyle the initial lyrics. The first lyric of her freestyle was \"bitch better have my money\" which later became the title of the completed song. Following the completion of the song, Deputy believed that Rihanna would be the artist for it, stating \"This is definitely something that Rihanna needs to sing. We was trying to figure out who could do it because Bibi killed it. Not anyone could just sing this record.\" After a certain period of time, Bourelly had a recording session with both West and Rihanna; it was the first time they heard the track and they both reacted positively to it. When they finally got a hold on the song, some changes were made to it. They were done by Scott, WondaGurl and West; all of them added an additional part by the end of the song. When Deputy was asked whether he was bothered by the adjustments that were made, he responded, \"I thought it was cool. I didn't have any negative feelings to it. Rih[anna] loved it and it was really about what she wants.\" \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" is a trap song with a length of three minutes and thirty-nine seconds. According to Jim Farber of New York Daily News the song is reminiscent of the works by West, particularly the half-sang and half-rapped vocals. To deliver the vocals, she uses her Caribbean accent. Farber also called the song \"shadowy\" and \"repetitive\" and according to him results in being more a riff than a full song. Billboard's Jason Lipshutz found the song similar to Rihanna's 2013 single \"Pour It Up\". Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone noted that the song differs drastically from her previous 2015 single, \"FourFiveSeconds\", which featured a \"gentle, acoustic tone\". Similarly, Miles Raymer of Entertainment Weekly wrote that, \"'Bitch Better Have My Money' is a trap-influenced banger that's a complete 180\u00b0 difference from the \"countryfied\" sound of 'FourFiveSeconds'.\" Lewis Corner of Digital Spy noted that the track represents a sequel to the music material present on Rihanna 2012 seventh studio album, Unapologetic, \"with its swaggering hip-hop heartbeat and Rihanna's braggadocio callouts\". Lyrically, the song features an angrier tone than \"Rihanna's usual oeuvre\", \"Every time I drop I am the only thing y'all playing, Don't act like you forgot, I call the shots\" proclaimed along with \"machine-gun ad-libs\". Lipshutz noted that the lyrical content of the song sounded inspired by Beyonc\u00e9's 2014 single \"Flawless\". ==Release== On March 25, 2015, via her official Twitter account, Rihanna posted, \"rihannaNOW.com #R8 #BBHMM #March26\". Subsequently, she posted the artwork of the song on her official Instagram account. The black-and-white cover features Rihanna with highlighted brows while wearing a motorcycle jacket; John Walker of MTV News assumed that it was shot by Dutch photographer duo Inez and Vinoodh, who did both the cover and the music video for \"FourFiveSeconds\". The title of the song is placed on the left side and is written in Braille. According to Morwenna Ferrier of The Guardian, \"Rihanna's new image screams Madonna circa-Vision Quest meets Paolo Roversi meets Frida Kahlo meets Boy George.\" Later that day, a snippet of the song was released via the Dubsmash application. On March 26, the song was made available for digital download via the iTunes Store. Subsequently, an edited version of the song was released under the title, \"B**** Better Have My Money\". The song was initially set to appear on Anti but was removed from the track listing, along with \"FourFiveSeconds\" and \"American Oxygen\". ==Critical reception== Rolling Stone wrote, \"Her evolving sound has gotten much harder since her dance pop debut, and 'Bitch Better Have My Money' may be her hardest yet.\" The same magazine later ranked \"Bitch Better Have My Money\" at number 45 on its year- end list to find the 50 best songs of 2015. Jeff Pearson of Paste thought that the single is a \"classic RiRi\" in which she sounds confident and in control \"more than ever\". Stacy-Ann Ellis of Vibe described the song as \"badass\" and \"bossy\", \"she confidently claims her place as the game's top shot-caller, and by song's end, you'll be feeling the same way.\" Billboards Lipshutz gave the song three out of five stars and wrote that although the song is not a right successor to Rihanna's previous [lead] singles such as \"We Found Love\" and \"Only Girl (In the World)\", it \"is designed to make clubs rumble and arenas explode, and will successfully do so over the next year and beyond\". In the same vein, Digital Spy's Corner also gave the song three out of five stars. Although Rihanna announced that she wanted her next project to feel soulful, regarding \"Bitch Better Have My Money\", he thought \"It's a song for the club for sure, but as for that real and soulful sound? Maybe it's still to come.\" Corner and Amy Davidson, for the same publication, ranked the single at number three on their Playlist: 10 tracks you need to hear for the date March 31 and wrote, Bitch Better Have My Money' determines that the singer's new album will still bring plenty of fun.\" ===Year-end lists=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !

The trailer captured a cryptic storyline: a rich woman, identity unknown, gets herself ready in her lavish apartment, clothes on and purse gathered in her arms, kisses her partner goodbye, and enters a dimly-lit elevator. As this occurs, Rihanna, wearing dark makeup, pulls up to the apartment complex at night. She opens up her car's trunk and pulls out a large suitcase. Struggling with the suitcase, she too enters the elevator. In one scene, the elevator doors close on the two standing women.

The actual plot of the video involves Rihanna and friends intoxicating and then later sadistically torturing the woman (Rachel Roberts), and also her corrupt accountant husband (Mads Mikkelsen), who has been stealing money. A video was later posted on Metro.com of deleted scenes from the video, showing the torture of the accountant in greater detail. The music video was inspired by Rihanna's real life experience with an accountant who cheated her of her money. On November 18, 2016, it surpassed the 100 million views mark, making it the 1st ever age- restricted Vevo Certified video. ===Year-end lists=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !
