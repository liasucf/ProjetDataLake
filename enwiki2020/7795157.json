    "text": "Vladim\u00edr Dzurilla (August 2, 1942 in Bratislava, Slovakia \u2013 July 25, 1995 in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany) was a Slovak ice hockey goaltender playing for Czechoslovakia. Dzurilla, a refrigerator repairman by profession, was goalie for the Czechoslovak national team for over 16 years, winning three gold, three silver and four bronze medals at world championships as well as one silver and two bronze Olympic medals. However, in most of these tournaments Dzurilla and Jiri Holecek were battling to be Czechoslovakia's top goaltender and each were given their share of games. For North American fans, he is mostly known for stopping 29 shots in a 1-0 win over Canada in the 1976 Canada Cup (where the Czechoslovaks finished second). He suffered a fatal heart attack at his home in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany on July 25, 1995, only days before his 53rd birthday. ==References== ==External links== * *Biography *Vladim\u00edr Dzurilla / kolekt\u00edvne \u0161porty * Category:1942 births Category:1995 deaths Category:Augsburger Panther players Category:Czechoslovak ice hockey goaltenders Category:HC Kometa Brno players Category:HC Plze\u0148 players Category:HC Slovan Bratislava players Category:Ice hockey players at the 1964 Winter Olympics Category:Ice hockey players at the 1968 Winter Olympics Category:Ice hockey players at the 1972 Winter Olympics Category:IIHF Hall of Fame inductees Category:Medalists at the 1964 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic bronze medalists for Czechoslovakia Category:Olympic ice hockey players of Czechoslovakia Category:Olympic medalists in ice hockey Category:Olympic silver medalists for Czechoslovakia Category:SC Riessersee players Category:Slovak ice hockey goaltenders Category:Sportspeople from Bratislava Category:Medalists at the 1972 Winter Olympics Category:Medalists at the 1968 Winter Olympics ",
