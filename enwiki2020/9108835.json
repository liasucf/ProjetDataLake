On 3 October 1955, Harding was assigned the post of Governor of the British colony of Cyprus. As Governor of Cyprus, Harding sought to restore the relations with the United Kingdom, by negotiating with both the Greek-Cypriot and the Turkish-Cypriot communities on the island, while the British Government was negotiating with the Greek and Turkish governments. Harding took strict measures to improve the security situation in Cyprus, EOKA having declared an armed struggle against the British on 1 April 1955. To this end, Harding instituted a number of unprecedented measures including curfews, closures of schools, the opening of concentration camps, the indefinite detention of suspects without trial and the imposition of the death penalty for offences such as carrying weapons, incendiary devices or any material that could be used in a bomb. A number of such executions took place often in controversial circumstances (e.g. Michalis Karaolis) leading to resentment, in Cyprus, the United Kingdom and in other countries.Grivas (1964) Implementing the policy of the British Government, Harding also attempted to use negotiations to end the Cyprus crisis. However, negotiations with Archbishop Makarios III were unsuccessful and, eventually, Harding exiled Makarios to the British colony of Seychelles. On 21 March 1956 EOKA made an assassination attempt on Harding's life which failed as the time bomb under his bed failed to go off.Grivas (1964), p. 68 & 69. It was not long after this that Harding offered a reward of \u00a310,000 for General George Grivas, the leader of EOKA.Grivas (1964), p. 69 Facing growing criticism in the United Kingdom about the methods he used and their lack of effectiveness, Sir John Harding resigned as Governor of Cyprus on 22 October 1957 and was replaced by Sir Hugh Foot. In January 1958, Harding was created Baron Harding of Petherton. In retirement he became Non-Executive Chairman of Plessey as well being the first Chairman of the Horse Race Betting Levy Board. His interests included his membership of the Finsbury Rifles Old Comrades Association in which he participated until late in his life. He died at his home in Nether Compton in Dorset on 20 January 1989. ==Family== In 1927 he married Mary Rooke; they had one son: John Charles Harding, 2nd Baron Harding of Petherton. ==Arms== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * ==External links== *War service *Imperial War Museum Interview from 1984 *Imperial War Museum Interview from 1986 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- Category:1896 births Category:1989 deaths Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:People from South Somerset (district) Category:London Regiment officers Category:Somerset Light Infantry officers Category:Machine Gun Corps officers Category:English military personnel Category:British Army personnel of World War I Category:British Army generals of World War II Category:British field marshals Category:Governors of British Cyprus Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:British people of the Cyprus Emergency Category:Chiefs of the Imperial General Staff Category:Commanders of the Legion of Merit Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Graduates of the Staff College, Camberley Category:Peers created by Elizabeth II Category:John Harding family ",
