    "text": "Newtown railway station () is a railway station serving Newtown in Powys, Wales. ==History== Newtown was the last major station before where the Mid- Wales Railway, to Llanidloes, Rhayader, Builth Road and on to Cardiff (with a branch to Brecon), diverged from the Cambrian Railways main line (today's Cambrian Line) to Machynlleth and Aberystwyth. The station was the eastern terminus of the Newtown and Machynlleth Railway opened by the Countess of Londonderry at Machynlleth station on 3 January 1863.Engineering Timelines \u2013 Talerddig CuttingEngineering Timelines; Retrieved 6 May 2016 It was also originally served by the (now mostly defunct) Llanidloes and Newtown Railway (opened in 1859 and initially isolated from the rest of the Welsh railway system) and the Oswestry and Newtown Railway (opened in 1861). All were subsequently subsumed into the Cambrian by 1865. The Mid-Wales line passenger service was withdrawn on 31 December 1962, though trains to and from this route latterly started and terminated at Moat Lane Junction. Services to Oswestry and Whitchurch via the former O&NR; Cambrian main line ended in January 1965, when the route east of Buttington closed to passenger traffic as a consequence of the Beeching Axe. ==Facilities== Station building in November 2008 The station currently has two through platforms, which are used separately for trains in either direction. The station is usually used as one of the passing points for trains on the Cambrian Line as it is a single track. The station has one west facing bay platform/siding which is periodically used as a storage point for Network Rail's Departmental trains. There is an Transport for Wales appointed \"Station Agent\" with full ticket issuing facilities in the main building. This also houses a Grill Restaurant (Station Grill) and a computer training centre. Train running information is provided by digital CIS displays, automatic announcements and customer help points on both platforms.
