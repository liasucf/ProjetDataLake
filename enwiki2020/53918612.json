    "text": "Martin Pierre d'Alvimare du Briou (18 September 1772 \u2013 3 June 1839), sometimes spelled Dalvimare, was a French musician, harpist and composer. He was harp master of Queen Hortense. == Biography == Martin Pierre d'Alvimare du Briou was born on September 18, 1772 at Dreux, of Pierre d'Alvimare du Briou, a lawyer in the Parliament and receiver of gabelles and C\u00e9cile Doury de Sacy. He received an excellent education, and at an early age learned drawing, as well as the harpsichord and harp. Noticed by Duke of Penthi\u00e8vre residing in the nearby ch\u00e2teau d'Anet, he was introduced by the latter and Madame de Lamballe to the court at the age of 7, where he played in front of Queen Marie- Antoinette. In 1788, he composed his first op\u00e9ra: \u00c9gl\u00e9. At the age of fourteen, he obtained the office of receiver of salt-tax of his father, but the charge did not interest him and it could be done by proxy. He therefore embarked on a military career and became a bodyguard of Louis XVI, which enabled him to compose at leisure. So he found himself at his post on 10 August 1792 and escaped miraculously to the massacre, taking refuge in the porter's house of one of his friends, who made him pass for his sick son. Inscribed on the list of emigrants, he hid under another name. There was nothing left of the confiscated fortune of his father. In order to earn his living, he became a draftsman for a handkerchief factory near Dreux, under the name of Dalvimare. During the Consulate, removed from the list of emigrants, he returned to Paris and resumed his musical activities successfully. He was admitted as harpist of the Paris Op\u00e9ra in 1800 and as a musician in the chamber orchestra of Napoleon. In 1807 he had the title of harp master of Jos\u00e9phine and of her daughter Hortense. Familiar of Malmaison, he frequented Talma, general Lauriston, and was an intimate friend of M\u00e9hul. Having recovered the fortune he possessed before the Revolution, he resigned from all his posts in 1812 and retired to Dreux, where he spent the rest of his life painting and composing. He was married to Anne Louise Didelot (died in 1804) then in 1812 to Alexandrine de Feuqui\u00e8res. Sick, he went to Paris for treatment and died there on June 3, 1839. == Works == * Trois sonates pour harpe et violon ad libitum, op 2, 9, 12, 14, 15, 18 (3 per opus) * Grande sonate pour harpe avec violon, op 33 * 3 Duos pour harpe et piano, n\u00b0 1 op 22, n\u00b0 2 without opus, n\u00b0 3 op 31 * Concerto pour harpe et orchestre en ut majeur, op 30 * Premier et Deuxi\u00e8me duo pour 2 harpes * Plusieurs morceaux pour cor et harpe composed with Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Nicolas Duvernoy * Symphonie concertante pour cor, harpe et orchestre, with Duvernoy (1798) === Harp === * Recueil de romances, op 4, 13, 15, 20 * 3 Sonates, op 14 * 3 Grandes Sonates, op 18 * Th\u00e8me vari\u00e9 pour harpe, op 21 * Sc\u00e8ne pour la harpe, op 23 * Fantaisie sur le pas russe, op 24 * Airs russes vari\u00e9s, op 25 * Recueil d'airs connus pour la harpe * Fantaisie et variations sur l'air de L\u00e9once * Air tyrolien vari\u00e9 * Airs des Myst\u00e8res d'Isis en pot-pourris et vari\u00e9s * Fandango des Noces de Gamache vari\u00e9 * Fantaisie sur l'air Mon c\u0153ur soupire * Fantaisie sur l'air Un jeune troubadour * Fantaisie sur un th\u00e8me donn\u00e9 * Fantaisie et douze variations sur un air pi\u00e9montais * Fantaisie et variations sur l'air Charmant ruisseau * Airs et ouvertures d'op\u00e9ras arrang\u00e9s pour la harpe === Vocal music === *1788: \u00c9gl\u00e9, op\u00e9ra comique *1809: Le Mariage par imprudence, op\u00e9ra comique == Sources == * Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis, Biographie universelle des musiciens et bibliographie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la musique * Auguste Jal, Dictionnaire critique de biographie et d'histoire == External links == * Martin-Pierre d'Alvimare * Martin-Pierre d'Alvimare's discography on Discogs * Martin-Pierre d'Alvimare on Presto classical * Concerto for harp in C minor (audiofile) * La harpe fran\u00e7aise entre deux r\u00e9volutions Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:French classical harpists Category:1772 births Category:Births in Dreux Category:1839 deaths ",
