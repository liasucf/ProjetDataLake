    "text": "Won't Let You Down is the first solo studio album by Bridget Kearney. It was released through Signature Sounds Recordings on March 24, 2017. ==Critical reception== The album received generally favorable reviews. Emily Zimmerman, of Exclaim writes: \"Won't Let You Down may be Bridget Kearney's debut album, but she's no newbie; she's the brilliant bassist and frequent songwriter for Boston-bred soul-pop group Lake Street Dive. For her solo debut, she's left behind the easily accessible, G-rated funk her band does best for a brainy, infectious and mature sound.\" Glide Magazine writer Lee Zimmerman states: \"Kearney adheres to a somewhat orthodox approach, one that emphasizes accessible melodies and an overall sound that shows a preference for a pure pop motif. Unlike the music she makes at her day job, there\u2019s no tendency to bend the boundaries or strongly tug at the parameters. Rather, Won\u2019t Let You Down is an album that proposes nothing more than offering a set of shimmering melodies and tunes that are decidedly gorgeous and giddy all at the same time.\" Ken Williams of Little Village magazine notes: \"You know Bridget Kearney isn't playing around on Won\u2019t Let You Down; there is serious songwriting expertise deployed here, and deeply satisfying, layered production, perfect for a late night with the big headphones in the dark. Every song is nearly perfect; I could take up the whole magazine trying to describe how the ways they aren\u2019t make them more interesting. Lake Street Dive deserve their success, and Kearney's voice and songwriting have served them well over the years. But Won\u2019t Let You Down is something else entirely \u2014 more personal, adventurous and odd in all the right ways. Kearney is an incurable, but skeptical, romantic; under the perfect pop sheen there's something complex and disquieting lurking.\" ==Track listing== Bandcamp provided times, all other information from liner notes.BandCamp Review ==Personnel== These people contributed to album (track). *Bridget Kearney \u2013 vocals, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, electric bass, keyboards, piano, organ (all tracks) *Robin MacMillan \u2013 drums, percussion, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards (all tracks) *Ryan Scott \u2013 electric guitar, slide guitar (tracks 6 and 9) *Frank LoCrastoe \u2013 keyboards (tracks 1, 4 and 9) *Alex Spiegelman \u2013 baritone sax, flute (track 1) *Tom Ayres \u2013 electric guitar (track 3) Technical *Robin MacMillan \u2013 mixing and production *Heba Kadry \u2013 mastering Design *Phillip Price \u2013 graphic design *Sasha Arutyunova \u2013 photography ==References== Category:2017 albums ",
