    "text": "Erin is a color which is halfway between green and spring green on the color wheel. It is named after Erin, a poetic name for Ireland. One of the earliest known uses of the word \"erin\" to describe a color appears in the poetry of Jane Johnston Schoolcraft (1800\u20131842). In a poem titled To the Pine Trees, Schoolcraft reflects on her arrival back to North America after spending years in England she writes \"Not all the trees of England bright, / Not Erin's lawns of green and light / are half so sweet to memory's eye, / As this dear type of northern sky.\" == See also == * Erin (disambiguation) * List of colors ==References== Category:Quaternary colors ",
