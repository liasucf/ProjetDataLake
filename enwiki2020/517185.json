    "text": "The chamber of the Legislative Council of Quebec before its abolition The Legislative Council of Quebec (French; Conseil l\u00e9gislatif du Qu\u00e9bec) was the unelected upper house of the bicameral legislature in the Canadian province of Quebec from 1867 to 1968. The Legislative Assembly was the elected lower house. The council was composed of 24 members, appointed by the Lieutenant Governor upon the recommendation of the Premier. Each councillor nominally represented a portion of the Province of Quebec called a division. The boundaries of these divisions were identical to the ones used for Canada East by the Legislative Council of the Province of Canada and were also identical to the boundaries still used today by the Senate of Canada for Quebec. The division boundaries were never changed to accommodate territorial expansions of Quebec in 1898 and 1912. The Legislative Council was abolished in 1968 and the Legislative Assembly was renamed the National Assembly of Quebec. Since the abolition, Quebec has a unicameral legislature. == Powers of the Legislative Council == The council had the right to introduce bills, except of a financial nature, and to amend, or veto bills passed by the Legislative Assembly. Its speaker, known in French as orateur, was by right a member of the Cabinet, and its members could serve as ministers or even premier. Two Quebec premiers, Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Boucher de Boucherville and John Jones Ross were members of the Legislative Council. The chamber of the Legislative Council of Quebec in session, 1924 == Appointment of Members of the Legislative Council == Members were originally appointed for life. In 1963, the rule was changed to force members to retire at age 75, but that did not apply to members who had already been appointed. In the event, the change remained entirely theoretical since the council was abolished before it could be applied to anyone. == Abolition of the Legislative Council == Effective December 31, 1968 the Legislative Council was abolished, and the Legislative Assembly of Quebec was renamed the National Assembly. As a consequence, Quebec now has a unicameral legislature. The establishment of the original system dates back to the Constitutional Act of 1791. The Union Nationale government of Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand passed the legislation, known as \"Bill 90\", to implement the change. Previous governments had made unsuccessful attempts to eliminate the upper chamber. In fact, the first attempt dated all the way back to F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand, in the late 19th century. Quebec was the last Canadian province to abolish its upper house. When it was dissolved, it had 15 members of the Union Nationale and 9 Liberal Party members. == The Red Chamber == The large chamber that housed the Legislative Council is also known in French as le salon rouge (the red hall) and in English as \"the Red Room\" because of the predominance of the colour on the walls. It is now used for committee meetings and for important state functions that require a large, impressive hall, such as inductions into the National Order of Quebec. == Speakers of the Legislative Council of Quebec (1867\u20131968) == The Speaker of the Legislative Council (in French, the Orateur) was appointed by the government. Most Speakers sat in the Cabinet. The Speaker was the presiding officer of the Legislative Council, but could vote like other members. In the event of a tie, the Speaker did not have a casting vote. The motion simply failed. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Speakers of the Legislative Council of Quebec !Portrait !Name !Appointment !Ending !colspan=\"2\"|Political party |- | 70px | Charles-Eug\u00e8ne Boucher de Boucherville | July 15, 1867 | February 27, 1873 | Conservative | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | 70px | John Jones Ross | February 27, 1873 | September 22, 1874 | Conservative |- | | F\u00e9lix-Hyacinthe Lemaire | September 22, 1874 | January 27, 1876 | Conservative |- | 70px | John Jones Ross | January 22, 1876 | March 8, 1878 | Conservative |- | 70px | Henry Starnes | March 8, 1878 | October 31, 1879 | Liberal | | |- | 70px | John Jones Ross | October 31, 1879 | March 4, 1882 | Conservative | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 70px | Pierre Boucher de la Bru\u00e8re | March 4, 1882 | April 23, 1889 | Conservative |- | 70px | Henry Starnes | April 23, 1889 | March 17, 1892 | Liberal | | |- | 70px | Pierre Boucher de la Bru\u00e8re | March 17, 1892 | April 5, 1895 | Conservative | rowspan=\"3\" | |- | 70px | Thomas Chapais | April 5, 1895 | January 12, 1897 | Conservative |- | 70px | Vildebon-Winceslas Larue | January 12, 1897 | June 17, 1897 | Conservative |- | 70px | Horace Archambeault | June 17, 1897 | September 15, 1908 | Liberal | rowspan=\"4\" | |- | 70px | Ad\u00e9lard Turgeon | February 2, 1909 | November 14, 1930 | Liberal |- | 70px | Jacob Nicol | November 25, 1930 | July 25, 1934 | Lib\u00e9ral |- | 70px | Hector Lafert\u00e9 | July 27, 1934 | October 2, 1936 | Liberal |- | 70px | Alphonse Raymond | October 2, 1936 | January 17, 1940 | Union Nationale | | |- | 70px | Hector Lafert\u00e9 | January 17, 1940 | December 31, 1944 | Lib\u00e9ral | | |- | 70px | Alphonse Raymond | December 31, 1944 | February 1, 1950 | Union Nationale | rowspan=\"2\" | |- | 70px | Jean-Louis Baribeau | February 1, 1950 | July 6, 1960 | Union Nationale |- | 70px | Hector Lafert\u00e9 | July 6, 1960 | June 23, 1966 | Liberal | | |- | 70px | Jean-Louis Baribeau | June 23, 1966 | December 31, 1968 | Union Nationale | | |} == Legislative Council divisions == Map of the Legislative Council divisions The twenty-four members of the Legislative Council were each appointed to represent a division of Quebec.
