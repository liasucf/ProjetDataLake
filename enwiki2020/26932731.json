This is the seventh and final film in Universal-International Francis the Talking Mule series, notably without series director Arthur Lubin, star Donald O'Connor, or Francis' voice actor Chill Wills. ==Plot== Francis witnesses a murder and then befriends bumbling reporter David Prescott (Mickey Rooney), who may be next in line. With Francis' help and guidance, Prescott uncovers a mystery involving murder, an inheritance, and a spooky old mansion on the edge of town. ==Cast== * Mickey Rooney as David Prescott * Virginia Welles as Lorna MacLeod * James Flavin as Police Chief Martin * Paul Cavanagh as Neil Frazer * Mary Ellen Kay as Lorna Ann * David Janssen as Police Lieutenant Hopkins * Ralph Dumke as Mayor Hargrove * Richard Gaines as D.A.

Leonard Maltin, in his Movie Guide, quotes Donald O'Connor on quitting the series: \"When you've made six pictures and the mule still gets more fan mail than you do....\" Director Lubin and Chill Wills were also absent, replaced respectively by Charles Lamont and voice actor Paul Frees, who did a close approximation of Wills' voice as Francis. Mickey Rooney replaced Donald O'Connor as a new but similar character, David Prescott. According to his autobiography, Rooney was originally considered for a United Artists Francis feature film with his company Rooney Inc optioning and then turning down the property p.199 Lertzman, Richard A. & Birnes, William J.

In the script Francis says he decided to befriend reporter Prescott because \"I once lived on a farm owned by Prescott's uncle and wanted to protect his nephew out of respect for the deceased.\" With the original elements missing, the film, a standard tale of fake ghosts and gangsters, was poorly received; it was widely reviewed as the weakest entry in the series. ==Video releases== The original film, Francis (1950), was released in 1978 as one of the first-ever titles in the new LaserDisc format, DiscoVision Catalog #22-003. (The DiscoVision Library) It was then re-issued on LaserDisc in May 1994 by MCA/Universal Home Video (Catalog #: 42024) as part of an Encore Edition Double Feature with Francis Goes to the Races (1951). The first two Francis films were released again in 2004 by Universal Pictures on Region 1 and Region 4 DVD, along with the next two in the series, as The Adventures of Francis the Talking Mule Vol. 1. Several years later, Universal released all 7 Francis films as a set on three Region 1 and Region 4 DVDs, Francis The Talking Mule: The Complete Collection. ==See also== *List of American films of 1956 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1956 films Category:1950s comedy horror films Category:American films Category:American comedy horror films Category:American black-and-white films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Charles Lamont Category:Universal Pictures films Category:1956 comedy films ",
