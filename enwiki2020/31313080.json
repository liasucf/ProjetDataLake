    "text": "Humberto Carlos Nelson Cruz Silva (, born 8 December 1939) is a Chilean retired footballer that played in two FIFA World Cups (1962, Chile third place, and 1966) as centre back, despite his short height. He also has been a close friend of Pel\u00e9 since they played against each other in the 1960s. According to Pel\u00e9, Cruz was one of his best markers and in several interviews he has mentioned the classic moment when Cruz pulled down his pants so he wouldn't elude him. His nickname is after Cheeta (pronounced Chita in Spanish), Tarzan's ape companion. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Colo-Colo * Primera Divisi\u00f3n: 1963, 1970 ===International=== * FIFA World Cup: Third place 1962 * Copa Am\u00e9rica: Third place 1967 Patear a Pel\u00e9 ==External links== * FIFA Profile Category:1939 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Santiago Morning footballers Category:Colo-Colo footballers Category:\u00d1ublense footballers Category:1962 FIFA World Cup players Category:1966 FIFA World Cup players Category:Association football central defenders ",
