    "text": "Oxford Cave is a cave in Manchester Parish in west-central Jamaica. It is 765 metres long and at 290 metres altitude. The cave entrance is close by a main road and because of its accessibility has suffered much graffiti, vandalism and litter. It is a roost for a great many bats, but these are under threat from the number of anti-social human visitors, many there to collect bat guano to use as farm fertiliser, others for bashments. ==See also== *List of caves#Jamaica *Jamaican Caves Organisation *Manchester Parish, Jamaica ==External links== *Map. *Aerial view. *Photo. *Oxford Cave Field Notes. ==References== Category:Caves of the Caribbean Category:Bat roosts Category:Caves of Jamaica Category:Geography of Manchester Parish ",
