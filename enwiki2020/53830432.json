    "text": "The Mike Walsh Fellowships have been established by Mike Walsh, a former television presenter and theatre producer, for students/graduates in the arts and entertainment industry to enhance their experiences in Australia and overseas. == History of the Fellowships == The Fellowships began in 1996 and were limited to applicants from the National Institute of Dramatic Art (NIDA) as Sydney was where Walsh's business interests were. As his business interests grew further afield the applicants for Fellowships eligibility was widened to include of the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts (WAPPA) and the Victorian College of the Arts (VCA). It is Walsh's view that, > ... recipients of his fellowship may choose to travel abroad in order to > obtain a wider knowledge and experience of theatre, perhaps through a formal > course of study or by a self-devised program \u2026 to get out of your comfort > zone is very important. His hope is that the Fellows will come back to share their knowledge and skills with others. The scholarship is offered annually to an unspecified number of people.
