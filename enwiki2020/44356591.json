    "text": "Margaret McWade (born Margaret May Fish; September 3, 1871 \u2013 April 1, 1956) was an American stage and film actress. She began her career in vaudeville in the early 1890s. Her most memorable role was as one of 'The Pixilated Sisters', a comedic stage act with actress Margaret Seddon. Later in 1936, they reprised their roles in the movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. ==Biography== Margaret May Fish was born September 3, 1871, in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest of three daughters. A number of short biographies state that Fish was born in 1872; however, the 1900 U.S. Census reports her birth in 1871.1900, United States Census, West Township, Cook County, Illinois; pg. 13, family 208, dwelling 849, lines 31-34; June 12, 1900. ==Career== During her early career, Margaret May Fish went by the stage name Margaret May.Edward McWade, Margaret May, theater review, Fitchburg [MA] Sentinel, May 30, 1892.Edward McWade, Margaret May theater review, Boston, MA, Boston Sunday Post, January 23, 1893.Margaret May theater review, New York Times, May 2, 1902. In the late 1890s, while performing in vaudeville, she met fellow actress Margaret Seddon. The two actresses teamed to create a stage act known as 'The Pixillated Sisters'. The act proved to be a hit for the duo. Years later they would reprise 'The Pixilated Sisters' in the 1936 movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. On September 4, 1897, Margaret married actor Edward McWade. Margaret and her husband appeared in a number of stage performances together in Boston and New York before their marriage. Their earliest stage appearance together was in March 1892 in Boston. They were cast as supporting characters in County Fair at the Whitney Opera House. Until late 1919, Margaret continued to use her stage name Margaret May.Edward McWard, Margaret May theater review, Fitchburg, MA, Fitchburg Sentinel, March 30, 1892. Margaret McWade made her screen debut in the 1914 silent film The Drama of Heyville, starring Marc McDermott and directed by Ashley Miller. She was under contract to The Edison Film Company and was later picked up by the Vitagraph Film Company. She acted in a total of 59 films from 1914 to 1954. Between films, she was a prolific stage actress, touring the U.S. with various theatrical companies. Margaret also toured in theater shows with her husband Edward, several which he wrote. In April 1901, Edward McWade wrote and produced the play Winchester at the American Theater in New York. The play was based upon an event during the Civil War. Edward McWade wrote a supporting role for his wife. In 1902, he wrote the play The Land of Mystery, a romantic drama in which Margaret also had a role.Margaret May theater review, New York Times, April 21, 1901. In 1922, Margaret was cast in the movie The Blot, produced and directed by Lois Weber. The Blot is considered by many critics to be Weber's greatest film. McWade played Mrs. Griggs, and she is described in reviews as the, \u201cold mother hubbard, shouldering most of the burden for the penny pinching family.\u201d The movie received critical acclaim, which paved the way for more acting roles. McWade most often was described as playing the mother, aunt, older sister, spinster, and later in her career, the grandmother. In a Louisiana newspaper, Monroe Morning Works, on June 5, 1938, she is described physically as, \u201cthe one with the angular face and black hair\u201d.Lois Weber movie review, tcm.com, October 31, 2014.Lois Weber, The Blot movie review, Medicine Hat Daily News, May 29, 1922, pg. 6. In 1935, producers approached both McWade and Seddon and asked them to reprise their roles as 'The Pixilated Sisters' for the 1936 movie Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, starring Gary Cooper and directed by Frank Capra. In the film, the two actresses play sisters who believe that Cooper's character is \u201cpixilated\u201d. Reprising these characters set off a brief firestorm of stage and film performances for the duo. In The Corsicana Daily Sun, McWade is quoted regarding having played the Pixilated Sisters in the movie: \u201c...it\u2019s a one chance in a million, like something out of a book. It\u2019s not hard to understand. It wasn\u2019t we who clicked individually or even collectively. It was a grand part. If you recall, we turned the tide by our testimony in favor of Gary Cooper at an insanity hearing. He was a beloved character, and by helping him we helped ourselves.\u201d The two actresses teamed for a variety of films throughout the late 1930s and into the 1940s, often playing spinster sisters in comedic roles written for them, such as One Man's Bonus. After 1936, they often were billed in newspapers and posters as those \u201cbeloved Pixilated Sisters\u201d.Margaret McWade movie review, New York, New York, The New York Times; July 31, 1936; pg. 22.Margaret McWade movie review, The Corsicana [TX] Daily Sun, November 14, 1936. ==Later years and death== Two years after performing in her last movie, Margaret McWade died on April 1, 1956, in Los Angeles at the age of 83.
