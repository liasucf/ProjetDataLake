The qualifiers were chosen by public televoting. One of the successful participants in the first semi-final was 1967 French representative No\u00eblle Cordier.National Finals database 1978 Semis ====Semi-final 1==== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"5\" |Semi-final 1 \u2013 12 March 1978 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

The winner was chosen by public televoting. It was later rumoured that \"Laisse pleurer les rivi\u00e8res\" was the preferred option of TF1, who had given it the advantageous first performance slot, and were taken aback when it was decisively beaten into second place by a song which had not even won its semi-final.ESC National Finals database 1978 {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"5\" |Final \u2013 26 March 1978 |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" !

However it had a memorable melody, and at the close of voting had picked up 119 points, placing France third of the 20 entries. It achieved the distinction of becoming only the second non-winning Eurovision song - following Catherine Ferry's \"Un, deux, trois\" in 1976, also for France - ever to receive votes from every other national jury, completing a hat-trick of consecutive contests in which every other national jury had voted for the French song, a record which still stands. The French jury awarded its 12 points to Belgium.ESC History - France 1978 ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 1978 ==References== Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 1978 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:1978 in France ",
