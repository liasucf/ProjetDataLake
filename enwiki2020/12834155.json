    "text": "Johann Funk (December 26, 1836 - March 15, 1917) was a Mennonite bishop in early Canadian history. Funk was born on the Bergthal Colony, a Mennonite settlement near Mariupol, Yekaterinoslav Governorate, Russian Empire (Today Ukraine) in 1836. In 1874, bishop Gerhard Wiebe persuaded the colony to emigrate to Canada. Funk was ordained a bishop in Canada in 1892, and played a significant role in the development of Mennonite education and the formation of Mennonite Educational Institute in Gretna, Manitoba. Funk died in 1917 in Altbergthal, near Altona, Manitoba. ==References== * *Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online entry on Bergthal Mennonites Category:1836 births Category:1917 deaths Category:Canadian bishops Category:Canadian Mennonites Category:Mennonite ministers Category:People from Pembina Valley Region, Manitoba Category:Ukrainian emigrants to Canada Category:19th-century Anabaptist ministers Category:20th-century Anabaptist ministers Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Canada ",
