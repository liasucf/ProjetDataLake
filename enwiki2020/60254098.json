They lived in (Germany) and Algeria until he was ten-years old, then moved to Strasbourg. Influenced by the works of Ren\u00e9 Gu\u00e9non, a French Sufi metaphysician, Bonaud converted to Islam in 1979. He began to study Arabic. Studying Islamology eventually led him to the writings of Henry Corbin (1903\u20131978) about Shia Islam. Under the guidance of Amadou Hamp\u00e2t\u00e9 B\u00e2 (/1901\u20131991), an African gnostic and spiritual leader of the Tijaniyyah, he re-converted to Shia Islam and adopted the name Yahya Alawi (). Bonaud did his doctoral dissertation in French on Ruhollah Khomeini, which was reprinted and published as the book (\"Imam Khomeini, an unknown gnostic of the 20th century\"). While writing his thesis, he spent seven years in Iran studying under the guidance of Sayyed Jalal-ed-Din Ashtiani. ===Death=== He died at sea in Abidjan, Ivory Coast in a marine accident on Monday, 26 August 2019. He was making a visit to the African continent to address Muslims about the month of Muharram and the guiding principles of Husayn ibn Ali. His body was transferred to Mashhad, Iran (where he had lived for fifteen\u2013years prior) for his funeral rites and burial. He was 62\u2013years old. ==Works== * *French translation of the Qur'an * *Rituals of the Islamic Revolution ==References== Category:French writers Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Freiburg im Breisgau Category:1957 births Category:Converts to Shia Islam ",
