Pages 53-54. . * French Garden with its large cascading waterfall lies by the park\u2019s iron entry gates, immediately across Thousand Oaks Boulevard from the Civic Arts Plaza. There are two types of parterres found in this garden: one shaped in the form of a butterfly (\"papillon\") and another in shape of the sun. The French Fountain is an authentic replica of one found at Versailles, France. Flowers and low boxwood hedges arranged in intricate design surround the foot of the waterfall. * English Perennial and Rose Garden contains 400 rose bushes with a variety of colors and species. The garden is home to two types of roses: Bush- and Climber roses. It has a pergola with numerous arches and places for seating. * Italian Garden features a lush grape arbor and an Italian chain fountain designed with historic Italian architecture. This garden also exhibits a number of distinctive Cypress trees often found at Italy\u2019s famed gardens. A Venus De Milo statue is located on top of the fountain. Cabernet- and chardonnay grapes are represented. * Japanese Garden is home to an authentic Japanese Pagoda surrounded by a Koi pond, Japanese-design bridges and bamboo shoots. A decorative waterfall, Dragon\u2019s Gate Waterfall, and a stream are also found here. The waterfall is named for the fable that if a Koi can swim to the top of the falls, it will turn into a dragon. Rock formations in the pond represent a crane and a turtle, symbols of longevity. * Mission Courtyard exhibits California\u2019s mission trail. A statue of Jun\u00edpero Serra, the priest who founded many of the California Missions, is near the entrance to courtyard. Colorful, hand-painted murals of 21 missions painted by local artists Bridget Duffy and Mark Fenton line the courtyard. Animal prints can be seen in the hand-made tiles and are traditional symbols of good luck. The Spanish Fountain in the center of the courtyard is traditionally designed in three levels, so that chickens, horses, and people all could drink from the same fountain. The courtyard is surrounded by olive and citrus trees. In the center of the gardens is a replica of the American/Victorian Bandstand. The bandstand functions as an amphitheater and is where musical performances take place. ==Gallery== Mission_courtyard_gardens_of_the_world.jpg|Spanish Fountain in the Mission Courtyard.
