    "text": "Jamie Conlan (born 10 October 1986) is a former professional boxer from Northern Ireland who competed from 2009 to 2017, and has since worked as a boxing manager. He held the Commonwealth super-flyweight title in 2016 and challenged for the IBF super-flyweight title in 2017. He is the older brother of professional boxer Michael Conlan. ==Amateur career== Conlan started boxing at the St John Bosco Boxing Club in Belfast, and represented Northern Ireland and Ireland at international level. He was initially coached by his father and Sean McCafferty, a former Olympian. At 13 years of age, he had his first competitive fight, marking the start of a successful amateur career. Conlan went on to win numerous domestic titles, including five All-Ireland junior titles, one National under-21 title, and one All-Ireland senior title. He also won three gold medals and one silver medal in the annual Four Nations Championship, contested by fighters from Ireland, Scotland, England and Wales. Conlan turned professional with an amateur record of 11 losses in 118 fights. ==Professional career== Conlan turned professional in 2009. His first bout came against British fighter Anwar Alfadli, who he defeated on points. In April 2014, he acquired the WBO European super-flyweight title with a victory over Benjamin Smoes at the Odyssey Arena in Belfast. Conlan outclassed the Belgian fighter and knocked him down in the sixth, before an inevitable seventh-round knockout. In September, he defeated Mexico's Jose Estrella to capture the WBO Inter-Continental title. In 2015, Conlan announced he would be leaving Belfast and longtime trainer John Breen to train under Danny Vaughan out of Macklin's Gym Marbella. ==Personal life== Conlan's brother Michael is also a professional boxer and a former European and World amateur champion for Ireland. Their father, John, is from Drimnagh, County Dublin. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95% |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |20 |Loss |19\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jerwin Ancajas |TKO |6 (12), |18 Nov 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |19 |Win |19\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Yader Cardoza |SD |12 |10 Mar 2017 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |18 |Win |18\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| David Koos |PTS |8 |5 Nov 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |17 |Win |17\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Patrik Bartos |TKO |2 (8), |16 Jul 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Anthony Nelson |KO |8 (12), |30 Apr 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Adrian Dimas Garzon |KO |4 (8), |7 Nov 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Junior Granados |UD |10 |4 Jul 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jose Estrella |UD |10 |6 Sep 2014 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Gabor Molnar |TKO |3 (10), |20 Jun 2014 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Benjamin Smoes |TKO |7 (10), |4 Apr 2014 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Walter Rojas |TKO |1 (10), |19 Oct 2013 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mike Robinson |TKO |10 (10), |9 Feb 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Elemir Rafael |PTS |6 |21 Jan 2012 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Delroy Spencer |6 |PTS |25 Jun 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Kyle King |KO |3 (4), |13 May 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Francis Croes |RTD |3 (4), |15 Dec 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Hyusein Hyuseinov |TKO |3 (4), |18 Sep 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Deleon Spencer |PTS |4 |11 Jun 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Itsko Veselinov |TKO |5 (8), |13 Feb 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Anwar Alfadli |PTS |4 |6 Nov 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |} ==References== Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Male boxers from Northern Ireland Category:Super-flyweight boxers ",
