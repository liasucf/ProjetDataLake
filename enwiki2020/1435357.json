    "text": "Andr\u00e9 Messager, 1921 Andr\u00e9 Charles Prosper Messager (; 30 December 1853 \u2013 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty op\u00e9ras comiques, op\u00e9rettes and other stage works, among which his ballet Les Deux Pigeons (1886) and op\u00e9ra comique V\u00e9ronique (1898) have had lasting success; Les P'tites Michu (1897) and Monsieur Beaucaire (1919) were also popular internationally. Messager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Gabriel Faur\u00e9. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the West End and some on Broadway; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included musical comedies for Sacha Guitry and Yvonne Printemps. As a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, the Paris Op\u00e9ra, the Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from Mozart to Richard Strauss, and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of Wagner. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande, Massenet's Gris\u00e9lidis and Charpentier's Louise. At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet. Messager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French op\u00e9ra comique and op\u00e9rette. ==Life and career== ===Early years=== Saint-Sa\u00ebns; Faur\u00e9; Gigout; Chabrier Messager was born at Montlu\u00e7on in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-\u00c9mile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Corn\u00e9lie, n\u00e9e Lh\u00f4te de Selancy.Aug\u00e9-Larib\u00e9, p. 16 He recalled, \"You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father\".Quoted in Wagstaff, pp. 157 and 161 At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a Marist school where he continued his interest in the piano.Wagstaff, John and Andrew Lamb. \"Messager, Andr\u00e9\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 Towards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school.Wagstaff, p. 161 They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music.Ferchault, Guy, and Jacqueline Gachet. \"Niedermeyer, (Abraham) Louis\" , Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 11 April 2018 Fournier, Jean Claude. \"Andr\u00e9 Messager\", Op\u00e9rette \u2013 th\u00e9\u00e2tre musical, L'acad\u00e9mie nationale de l'op\u00e9rette (French text), accessed 15 March 2018 This was at the time of the Paris Commune (1871), and to escape the violence in the city the school was temporarily evacuated to Switzerland.Jones, p. 27 Messager studied piano with Adam Lausset, organ with Cl\u00e9ment Loret,Slonimsky, Nicolas (ed). \"Messager, Andr\u00e9 (Charles Prosper)\", Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians, vol. 4, Schirmer Reference, New York, 2001, accessed 18 March 2018 and composition with Eug\u00e8ne Gigout, Gabriel Faur\u00e9 and (after leaving Niedermeyer's school) Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns.Duteurtre, pp. 42 and 83 The musicologist Jean-Michel Nectoux comments that after his studies Messager developed into one of the finest orchestrators of the period.Nectoux, p. 262 Faur\u00e9 and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators.Jones, pp. 51\u201363 In 1874 Messager succeeded Faur\u00e9 as organiste du ch\u0153ur (choir organist) at Saint-Sulpice, Paris, under the principal organist, Charles-Marie Widor.Nectoux, p. 19 In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the Concerts Colonne at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet in January 1878. He won further prizes for his cantatas Don Juan et Hayd\u00e9e and Prom\u00e9th\u00e9e encha\u00een\u00e9. In 1879 Faur\u00e9 and Messager travelled to Cologne to see Wagner's Das Rheingold and Die Walk\u00fcre, and later to Munich for the complete Ring cycle, Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg and Tannh\u00e4user; in 1888 they went to Bayreuth for Die Meistersinger and Parsifal.Nectoux, p. 39 They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent Souvenirs de Bayreuth (c. 1888).

The names of both the composers are in small print just below the title. In 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the Folies Berg\u00e8re, and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, Fleur d'oranger (1878) and Les Vins de France (1879).Duteurtre, p. 116 In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Th\u00e9\u00e2tre in Brussels. At his invitation, Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden.\"The Drama in Brussels\", The Era, 20 June 1880, p. 12; and Wagstaff, John, and Andrew Lamb. \"Messager, Andr\u00e9\". Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis church, and from 1882 to 1884 he was organist and choirmaster at Ste Marie-des-Batignolles, a small church in the north west of Paris, where his assistant was another young composer, Claude Terrasse. Messager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer Firmin Bernicat died leaving an unfinished op\u00e9rette, Fran\u00e7ois les bas-bleus. Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers.Wagstaff, p. 45 It was staged in November 1883 at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Folies-Dramatiques and was an immediate critical and popular success.\"The Drama in Paris\", The Era, 17 November 1883. It was later produced in London and New York. In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Sa\u00ebns as the soloist at a concert in Le Havre, Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year.Aug\u00e9-Larib\u00e9, p. 50 Faur\u00e9 played the organ at the ceremony, and composed a mildly cynical song, \"Madrigal\", as a wedding present.Nectoux, p. 108 There was one child of the marriage, Jean Andr\u00e9 Emile Charles (1886\u20131952).\"Andr\u00e9 Messager\" , Association l'Art Lyrique Fran\u00e7ais, accessed 7 April 2018 In December 1883 Messager and Emmanuel Chabrier gave the first performance of the latter's Trois valses romantiques at the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale de Musique. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of Espa\u00f1a, arranged by Messager.Myers, p. 47; and Wagstaff, p. 77 Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and op\u00e9rettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, Gwendoline, appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did. He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work. Following the success of Fran\u00e7ois les bas-bleus Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Op\u00e9ra and an op\u00e9rette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The op\u00e9rette, La Fauvette du temple, first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891.\"The Drama in Paris\", The Era, 13 February 1886; \"The Theatres\", The Daily News, 30 November 1885, p. 2; and \"Occasional Notes\", Pall Mall Gazette, 17 November 1891, p. 2 The ballet, Les Deux Pigeons, which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Op\u00e9ra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.\"The Drama in Paris\", The Era, 25 October 1884, p. 15 A month after the opening of La Fauvette du temple the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's op\u00e9ra comique La B\u00e9arnaise, with Jeanne Granier in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including Florence St. John and Marie Tempest, running for more than 200 performances.\"La Bearnaise\", The Era, 2 October 1886, p. 9; \"The London Theatres\", The Era, 9 October 1886, p. 14; and \"The Drama in America\", The Era, 2 July 1887, p. 16 The Times said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career.Obituary, \"M. Andr\u00e9 Messager\", The Times, 25 February 1929, p. 17 A production of La B\u00e9arnaise in New York followed in 1887, under the title Jacquette. In 1886 Les Deux Pigeons was finally produced at the Paris Op\u00e9ra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, Le Bourgeois de Calais (1888), was not well received. Richard Traubner remarks in Operetta: A Theatrical History on its \"boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score\"; a contemporary critic wrote, \"That Le Bourgeois de Calais will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece.\"\"The Drama in Paris\", The Era, 16 April 1887, p. 8 Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, Isoline (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act op\u00e9rette, Le Mari de la reine (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it \"the best of my flops\".Traubner, p. 223 ===Fin de si\u00e8cle=== Scene from La Basoche, 1890 Messager's fortunes revived in 1890 with La Basoche, produced with much success at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique. The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on Le Bourgeois de Calais wrote of the new piece, \"an exceptionally pleasing work ... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity.\"\"The Drama in Paris\", The Era, 7 June 1890, p. 9 An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by Richard D'Oyly Carte. The theatrical newspaper The Era said, \"The Basoche is more than a success; it is a triumph\",\"The Basoche\", The Era, 7 November 1891, p. 11 but the piece had only a modest London run of three months. A New York production was given in 1893 but was not a success.\"The Basoche Goes\". The New York Times, 11 March 1893, p. 8 Messager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian D. Kern Holoman describes him as \"given to immaculately tailored suits emphasizing his thin frame, careful grooming with particular attention to his mustaches, fine jewelry, and spats ... a witty conversationalist with an inexhaustible store of anecdotes and bons mots\" and a womaniser.Holoman, p. 229\u2013230 In the early 1890s Edith Messager, tired of her husband's infidelities, divorced him. Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily. By the time of her death in 1892 the two had become close again, and Messager felt her loss deeply.Aug\u00e9-Larib\u00e9, pp. 79\u201380 In 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct Die Walk\u00fcre at Marseille. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. Madame Chrysanth\u00e8me, staged at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Renaissance in 1893, was a setting of Pierre Loti's story of a betrayed geisha, a theme that later inspired Puccini's Madama Butterfly; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. Mirette, produced by Carte at the Savoy Theatre in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original Savoy opera by a French composer.Traubner, p. 213 To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859\u20131938), known professionally as Hope Temple.Coles, Clifton. \"Mirette: Introduction\" , The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 May 1998, accessed 15 March 2018 She became Messager's second wife in 1895.Wagstaff, p. 9 According to Bernard Shaw, Messager, concluding from the reception of La Basoche in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent, decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible.Shaw, II, p. 537 and III, p. 266 It ran for 41 performances, was withdrawn and revised, and then ran for another 61 performances.Rollins and Witts, p. 14 Messager vetoed any production in Paris. His next opera, a serious work, Le Chevalier d'Harmental (1896), was unsuccessful, and for a while he and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near Maidenhead, Berkshire.Duteurtre, p. 13 Poster for Les P'tites Michu, 1897 From 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto: This was the op\u00e9rette Les P'tites Michu, which was presented to great acclaim at the Bouffes- Parisiens.\"The Drama in Paris\", The Era, 20 November 1897, p. 12 Its 1905 English adaptation in London ran for 401 performances.Howarth, Paul. The Little Michus , The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 23 January 2017, accessed 5 April 2018 Soon afterwards he was appointed musical director of the Op\u00e9ra- Comique,Duteurtre, p. 127 and in the commercial theatre had another outstanding success with V\u00e9ronique (1898).Lamb, Andrew. \"Messager, Andr\u00e9 (Charles Prosper)\". The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford Music Online, accessed 18 March 2018 In 1898 Messager's only child from his second marriage, Madeleine Hope Andr\u00e9e (d. 1986) was born.Wagstaff, p. 19 From that year to 1904 Messager's work at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique left him little time for composition, particularly after 1901, when he also spent May to July at the Royal Opera House in London.Lettres d'Andr\u00e9 Messager \u00e0 Albert Carr\u00e9 (Extraits relatifs \u00e0 Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande et pr\u00e9sent\u00e9s par Henri Borgeaud Revue de Musicologie, Vol. 48e, No. 125e, pp. 101\u201304 (French text), accessed 18 March 2018 He turned down W. S. Gilbert's offer of a collaboration,Pearson, p. 225; and Hyman, p. 165 and wrote only two stage works between 1898 and 1914. His international fame as a composer nevertheless grew, with productions of Les P'tites Michu and V\u00e9ronique in countries including Britain, Spain, Switzerland, Germany and the US. Unusually for the London stage at the time, V\u00e9ronique was given in French in 1903. An English translation was staged the following year and ran for 496 performances.\"Apollo Theatre\", The Times, 19 May 1904, p. 10; and Wearing, p. 185 Messager conducted the first nights of both productions.\"Coronet Theatre\", The Times, 6 May 1903, p. 12\"Messager's Veronique\". The Manchester Guardian, 7 May 1903, p. 7 The English version was staged in New York the following year, running for 81 performances.Wearing, p. 186 ===Twentieth century=== At the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Messager conducted the premieres of Massenet's Gris\u00e9lidis and Charpentier's Louise, and gave the first French performances of operas as contrasted as Hansel and Gretel and Tosca. But by far the best known of his premieres was Debussy's Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande (1902). Messager encouraged the composer to complete the opera and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere. In gratitude Debussy dedicated the work to Messager. Holoman writes, \"his championing of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande alone would have earned him a place in music history.\"Holoman, p. 330 Debussy regarded Messager as the ideal conductor. Before the premiere he had trusted him to \"make his dream into a reality\"; after it he praised him for knowing \"how to awaken the inner sound world of Pell\u00e9as with tender delicacy\".Orledge, p. 66 After Messager's commitments obliged him to leave Paris for London, Debussy found the performances much less satisfactory.Nichols and Langham-Smith, p. 149 As a conductor, Messager won praise on both sides of the English Channel.\"The Op\u00e9ra Comique\", The Times, 22 November 1901, p. 10; and \"Music in Paris\", The Times, 3 May 1902, p. 8 The English music critic Francis Toye wrote that, good though Arturo Toscanini's conducting of Pell\u00e9as et M\u00e9lisande was at La Scala in Milan, Messager's was still better.\"The Charm of Music\", The Illustrated London News, 29 July 1939, p. 210 The Parisian critic Pierre Lalo said of Messager: Mary Garden in 1903 From 1901 to 1907 Messager was one of the directors of the Grand Opera Syndicate, which ran the annual seasons at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, featuring the leading singers of the day, including Nellie Melba and Enrico Caruso. Much of his time was spent on administration, and he had limited scope for conducting. From 1901, for two years, Messager had an affair with the Scottish soprano Mary Garden, whom he met at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique and conducted when she took over the title role of Louise. She also appeared in a revival of his Madame Chrysanth\u00e8me.Turnbull, Michael T.R.B., \"Garden, Mary\", Grove Music Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 18 March 2018 His first appearance as a conductor at Covent Garden was in 1902 for the first performance of Princess Osra by Herbert Bunning.\"The Royal Opera\", The Times, 15 July 1902, p. 7 He next conducted there in 1904 in the British premiere of Saint-Sa\u00ebns's H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, followed in 1905 by Carmen, Don Giovanni, Faust, the world premi\u00e8re of Franco Leoni's L'oracolo, Orph\u00e9e et Euridice and Rom\u00e9o et Juliette; in his final year, 1906, he conducted Armide, Carmen, Don Giovanni, Faust, the British premiere of Le Jongleur de Notre- Dame, and Rom\u00e9o et Juliette.Rosenthal, p. 168 In 1906 he also introduced to Covent Garden his ballet Les Deux Pigeons.\"Royal Opera\", The Times, 22 June 1906, p. 10 Despite his reputation as a Wagnerian, he yielded the baton for Wagner performances to Hans Richter, widely regarded as the world's foremost exponent of Wagner's music.\"Royal Opera\", The Times, 14 June 1904, p. 11; and 2 May 1905, p. 4 In 1906 Messager and the London Symphony Orchestra travelled to Paris to play a programme of English music at the Ch\u00e2telet Theatre, including works by Sullivan, Parry and Stanford.\"English Concerts in Paris\", The Times, 11 January 1906, p. 5; and 15 January 1906, p. 3 When he left Covent Garden in 1907, the directors found it necessary to appoint two people to fill his place: Neil Forsyth as general manager and Percy Pitt as musical director.\"Royal Opera\", The Times, 2 February 1907, p. 11 1904 production of V\u00e9ronique In 1907 Messager returned to composition. His \"com\u00e9die lyrique\" Fortunio was presented at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique with great success.Duteurtre, p. 65 In the same year he was appointed joint director of the Paris Op\u00e9ra, responsible for the artistic direction, with Frederick Broussan, formerly director of the Lyons Opera, taking charge of administration.\"The Opera in Paris\", The Times, 22 January 1907, p. 5; and Wagstaff, p. 24 The partnership lasted until 1913, but its success was hampered by shortage of funds and internal disputes. Messager decided on a policy of making the Op\u00e9ra \"more genuinely French\".\"The Paris Grand Opera\", The Times, 4 January 1908, p. 3 He revived Rameau's Hippolyte et Aricie, for the first time in Paris since 1767, and presented unusual French repertoire including Faur\u00e9's P\u00e9n\u00e9lope. Foreign opera was not neglected; Messager gave Paris its first complete Ring cycle, presented a Russian season starring F\u00e9lia Litvinne and Feodor Chaliapin, and conducted the French premiere of Richard Strauss's Salome.\"Foreign Notes\" , The Musical Times, vol. 51, no. 808, 1910, pp. 393\u2013395 At the invitation of the Emperor Wilhelm II, Messager and Broussan took the Op\u00e9ra company to Berlin in 1908.\"The Emperor William and French Opera\", The Times, 26 March 1908, p. 5 Relations between the two co-directors were not always harmonious;Duteurtre, p. 129 after the French government refused Messager's resignation on at least one occasion, he finally announced it in November 1913, a year before his term of office was due to expire.\"The Paris Opera\", The Times, 11 December 1908, p. 7; and The Times, 1 November 1913, p. 7 He consented to return in January 1914 to conduct Parsifal \u2013 its first performance in Europe outside Bayreuth.\"M. Messager and the Paris Opera\", The Times, 8 November 1913, p. 7 His conducting of the work won critical praise.\"Music in Paris\", The Musical Times, February 1914, p. 124 ; and \"Parsifal in Paris \u2013 Historic Production at the Op\u00e9ra\", The Times, 5 January 1914, p. 6 On the strength of his experience as a Wagnerian, Messager was appointed conductor of the Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire in 1908.Wagstaff, p. 25 It was at the time, and for many years, the most prestigious symphony orchestra in France, and Messager was determined that it should enjoy the international prestige of the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras.Holoman, pp. 358\u2013359 Alongside the main orchestral repertoire of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Liszt and French classics, Messager conducted major choral works by J. S. Bach, Handel, Schumann and Berlioz, as well as introducing early French music such as that of Janequin. In the 1913\u201314 season, he conducted a chronological cycle of Beethoven's symphonies and his Missa solemnis, as well as Verdi's Requiem, for the Italian composer's centenary. Messager took the orchestra outside Paris to Lille, Lyon and Antwerp during these years.Holoman, pp. 332\u2013333 During the First World War he took the orchestra on tour to Argentina (1916), Switzerland (1917), and the US and Canada (1918\u201319), giving concerts in more than 50 cities.\"Imperial and Foreign News Items\", The Times, 23 August 1918, p. 5; and Wagstaff, pp. 25\u201327 After their concert at the Metropolitan Opera House in October 1918, the orchestra and Messager received a prolonged ovation that was typical of their reception as the tour progressed.\"French Orchestra Wins an Ovation\", The New York Times, 16 October 1918, p. 13; and Holoman, p. 370 At the end of that tour Messager retired from his post.Holoman, p. 393 Messager was criticised for performing the music of Wagner during the war, but he maintained that German music represented the noble side of the enemy nation's nature.Buch, Esteban. \"Les Allemands et les Boches\": la musique allemande \u00e0 Paris pendant la Premi\u00e8re Guerre mondiale , Le Mouvement social, No. 208, Musique en Politique (July\u2013September 2004), p. 52 (French text) Like Faur\u00e9, Messager refused to have anything to do with the National League for the Defence of French Music (La Ligue Nationale pour la Defense de la Musique Fran\u00e7aise), led by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, which sought to boycott German music.Caballero, Carlo. \"Patriotism or Nationalism?

The work was performed in Paris in 1917 but was not successful. In 1915 Messager joined with other musicians in contributing compositions to King Albert's Book to raise money for \"the relief of the suffering Belgian people\"; the other composers included Debussy, Elgar, Mascagni and Saint-Sa\u00ebns.\"King Albert's Book\", The Musical Times, January 1915, p. 17 Playbill from a 1920 production In 1919 Messager's operetta Monsieur Beaucaire was premiered in Birmingham prior to a long run in the West End. The composer, who generally conducted British premieres of his works, was suffering from sciatica and could not even be in the audience for the first nights in either city. The work received its Paris premiere at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Marigny in 1925, and it ran for 143 performances on Broadway.Monsieur Beaucaire, Internet Broadway Database, accessed 7 April 2018 Later in 1919 Messager resumed the musical directorship of the Op\u00e9ra-Comique for the 1919\u201320 season, conducting among other works the first complete performance in France of Cos\u00ec fan tutte.Wagstaff, p. 28 ===Last years=== In the 1920s, Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences. He collaborated with Sacha Guitry on the musical comedies L'Amour masqu\u00e9 (1923) and Deburau (1926), starring Yvonne Printemps.Duteurtre, p. 101 The former was a considerable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the Lord Chamberlain, declared it \"unfit for the English public\", and banned C. B. Cochran's planned production starring Printemps and Guitry.\"Bars L'Amour Masqu\u00e9\", The New York Times, 22 January 1928, p. 13 In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Faur\u00e9 and, particularly, Chabrier's L'\u00c9toile. Faur\u00e9, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of L'Amour masqu\u00e9 and wrote to Messager, \"Your wit is the same as always \u2013 it never grows old \u2013 and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning\". Faur\u00e9 died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of Deburau to his memory.Aug\u00e9-Larib\u00e9, p. 233 In 1924 Sergei Diaghilev persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of Auric's ballet Les F\u00e2cheux and Poulenc's Les Biches.Buckle, pp. 115\u2013116 In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the BBC for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to George Edwardes, whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.\"Summary of Cases\", The Times, 9 November 1928, p. 5 After a short illness Messager died in Paris on 24 February 1929 aged 75.\"Andr\u00e9 Messager\", The Manchester Guardian, 25 February 1929, p. 10 He was interred in the Passy Cemetery near the graves of Debussy and Faur\u00e9.Aug\u00e9-Larib\u00e9, p. 169 His last completed work, the op\u00e9rette Coups de roulis, was running in Paris when he died. A contemporary critic commented, \"Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made V\u00e9ronique such a success. Throughout his life Messager remained without a peer as a composer of light music.\"MacCormack, Gilson. \"A Review of French Records\", The Gramophone, May 1929, p. 24 ===Honours and awards=== Messager was elected President of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux- Arts. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. In his native town of Montlu\u00e7on, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour.\"Conservatoire \u00e0 rayonnement d\u00e9partemental pour la musique et l'art dramatique Andr\u00e9 Messager\" , Montlu\u00e7on Communaut\u00e9, accessed 15 March 2018 In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Mus\u00e9e des musiques populaires de Montlu\u00e7on, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the comit\u00e9 d'honneur of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers Susan Graham, Dame Felicity Lott and Mady Mespl\u00e9, the conductors Sir John Eliot Gardiner, John Nelson and Michel Plasson, and the director J\u00e9r\u00f4me Savary.Duteurtre, pp. 9\u201310 ==Music== Staff and students of the \u00c9cole Niedermeyer, 1871. Messager is in the middle row, second from right; his teachers Faur\u00e9 and Gigout are in the front row, second from left and furthest right, respectively. In his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Faur\u00e9,Nectoux, p. 256 Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him \"already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades\",Hughes, p. 128 and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on \"the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects\".Hughes, p. 129 He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked \"that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer\". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.Harding, p. 133 Gervase Hughes, in a study of French op\u00e9rette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was \"one all too common to many composers of operetta \u2013 too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity\", although such was Messager's \"innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry\". One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for chromaticism;Harding, p. 127 this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His \"Eh que ne parliez-vous?\", from La Basoche, was quoted note- for-note by Poulenc in Les Mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias. Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In Madame Chrysanth\u00e8me he made use of leitmotifs, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.Wagstaff, p. 17 Unlike some older contemporaries such as Saint-Sa\u00ebns and Massenet,Nichols, Roger. \"Saint- Sa\u00ebns, (Charles) Camille\", The Oxford Companion to Music, Oxford Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 16 March 2018 ; and Calvocoressi, M. D. \"Jules Massenet\" , The Musical Times, September 1912, pp. 565\u2013566 Messager remained open to new ideas and idioms throughout his life, and his style evolved to match the spirit of the times.Traubner, p. 184 His biographer and former pupil Henry F\u00e9vrier commented that from classic op\u00e9ras comiques, such as La Basoche, Messager's later works, such as Les P'tites Michu and V\u00e9ronique, show a difference in style, \"bringing an altogether fresher approach to the genre.\"Wagstaff, p. 13 Towards the end of his career Messager successfully moved to \"com\u00e9die musical\", the French form of musical comedy. Ballets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are op\u00e9ras comiques (9), op\u00e9rettes (7) and com\u00e9dies musicales (3). The composer remarked late in his career: ===Early stage works=== Les Deux Pigeons \u2013 final tableau Although Messager called some of his early stage works op\u00e9ras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with op\u00e9rette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of op\u00e9rette to that of op\u00e9ra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre.Hughes, p. 94 Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but La Fauvette du temple (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with \"an Offenbach lilt\".Hughes, p. 92 Hughes judges the next two scores, La B\u00e9arnaise and La Fauvette (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries Planquette, Serpette and Lecocq.Hughes, p. 93 Wagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score Les Deux Pigeons (1886). The piece is based on the fable The Two Pigeons by Jean de La Fontaine. The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the \"Entr\u00e9e de tziganes\".\"The Two Pigeons\" , Royal Opera House, accessed 17 March 2018 Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version.Pougin, Arthur. Review in Le M\u00e9n\u00e9strel Musique et Th\u00e9atres, 30 March 1912 In 1961 John Lanchbery revised this for Frederick Ashton's new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from V\u00e9ronique. This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the Royal Ballet and has been staged by such other companies as CAPAB and Australian Ballet.Vaughan, pp. 315 and 487 Isoline (1888), a musical fairy story (\"conte des f\u00e9es\"), is neither an op\u00e9rette nor an op\u00e9ra comique. Writing in 1908, Faur\u00e9 called it \"one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years\",Quoted in Duteurtre, p. 160 but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when Reynaldo Hahn staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes. The whole piece was revived at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.Harding, p. 125 ===1890s stage works=== Scene from La Basoche The decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of La Basoche (1890). F\u00e9vrier in his Andr\u00e9 Messager: Mon Ma\u00eetre, Mon Ami calls it \"the last of the great nineteenth- century French comic operas\" (\"le dernier des grands op\u00e9ras-comique fran\u00e7ais du XIX si\u00e8cle\")F\u00e9vrier, p. 49 and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre. Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece. The musicologist James Harding rates it \"the best Messager had written to date ... one of his finest works\". When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in The Times called it, \"A work of great beauty and charm\", although \"the influence of Die Meistersinger is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming\".\"Royal English Opera\", The Times, 4 November 1891, p. 6 With Madame Chrysanth\u00e8me (1893), a four-act \"lyric comedy\" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by Puccini for Madama Butterfly (1904): a young Japanese geisha wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor. Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity \u2013 reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising op\u00e9rette to the level of \"com\u00e9die lyrique\"F\u00e9vrier, p. 65 \u2013 but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre. Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager.Harding, p. 129 Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's, but add that the almost total eclipse of Madame Chrysanth\u00e8me by Madama Butterfly may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti.Harding, p. 130; and Hughes, p. 94 After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.Hughes, p. 95 The works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. Le Chevalier d'Harmental (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true op\u00e9ra comique (\"in a somewhat pretentious style\") was a failure, and an unpretentious op\u00e9rette in the same year, La Fianc\u00e9e en loterie, fared no better. After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes Les P'tites Michu (1897) as \"a sensational hit\",Traubner, p. 214 and Harding calls it the best of Messager's op\u00e9rettes so far (classing Le Basoche as op\u00e9ra comique, as did its composer).Harding, p. 132 The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from Gilbert and Sullivan operas. Traubner describes the piece as \"one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better\". Setting a scene in the market of Les Halles was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: \"clever, lilting ... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain\". He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic. The final work from the decade was V\u00e9ronique. Messager described it as an op\u00e9ra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of op\u00e9rette and op\u00e9ra comique.Harding, p. 133; and Traubner, p. 215 The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the \"Swing duet\" (\"Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette\") and the \"Donkey duet\" (\"De ci, de la\").Harding, p. 88 When the work was revived at the Proms in London in the 1960s, the music critic of The Times commented, \"Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that \u2013 thanks perhaps to Gilbert \u2013 redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan ... but V\u00e9ronique has plenty of pretty things\".\"V\u00e9ronique at the Proms\", The Times, 21 August 1967, p. 5 It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.Wagstaff, John. \"V\u00e9ronique\" , Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 17 March 2018 ; and Traubner, p. 216 ===20th century=== Marion Green and Maggie Teyte in Monsieur Beaucaire, 1919 Messager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between V\u00e9ronique and the period after the First World War. Fortunio (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a sung-through opera. Eight decades later the critic Edward Greenfield described it as \"a long-buried jewel of a piece ... an improbable cross between musical comedy and Tristan und Isolde\".Greenfield, Edward. \"Fortunio smiles: uncovering a Messager gem of charm and romance\", The Guardian, 15 July 1988, p. 24 From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more op\u00e9ras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, Monsieur Beaucaire, a \"romantic operetta\" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on \"Messager's English operetta\" as over- sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes.Harding, p. 141 Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is \"pure Edward German\" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres. Of Messager's 1920s com\u00e9dies musicales the best known is L'Amour masqu\u00e9 (1923). The Th\u00e9\u00e2tre \u00c9douard VII where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a tango, \"a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time\".Harding, p. 147 ===Non-stage works and role in French music=== Messager in 1890 Messager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Faur\u00e9, he was fond of the poetry of Armand Sylvestre, and from \"La Chanson des cerises\" in 1882 to the cycle Amour d'hiver in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from Victor Hugo to Frederic Weatherly (author of among other things \"Danny Boy\"). In his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity. The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with sonata form in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the adagio and a scherzo third movement. Looking back he described it as \"tr\u00e8s classique\".Wagstaff, p. 157 In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of Mendelssohn and possibly Schumann may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro con moto first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.Deletang, Xavier. Notes to Skarbo CD DSK 3921 (2001) When Messager was elected to membership of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux- Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal Le M\u00e9nestrel remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre \u2013 op\u00e9rette \u2013 official status and recognition;\"The Youthful Genius of Debussy\", The New York Times, 6 June 1926, p. X5 but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had \"seen all, heard all, and remembered all\".Holoman, p. 328 The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Faur\u00e9 called him \"familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new\". Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, \"I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as Andr\u00e9 Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too.\"Hahn, p. 110 Like Faur\u00e9, Messager wrote musical criticism for Le Figaro and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Faur\u00e9, who was known for his kindly reviews,Nectoux, Jean-Michel. \"Faur\u00e9, Gabriel (Urbain)\", Grove Online, Oxford Music Online, accessed 7 April 2018 Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.\"Events of Music Overseas\", The New York Times, 1 April 1923, p. X5 In 1908 Faur\u00e9 wrote of Messager, \"There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary\". Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians says of Messager, \"His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety.\" In his book Composers of Operetta, Hughes comments that Messager combined \"a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's\" and in much of his music \"a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Sa\u00ebns's aristocratic elegance, even Faur\u00e9's refined subtlety\".Hughes, p. 91 He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: \"Auber, Rossini and Meyerbeer were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of \"les Six\". ... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by Adolphe Adam in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out\".Hughes, p. 99 ===Conductor=== Messager conducting at the Op\u00e9ra, 1908 The wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by Le Men\u00e9stral, which said that he \"has served Wagner, Debussy, Faur\u00e9, Ravel and Stravinsky when their works were still struggling for recognition\". He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, \"His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra\".Harding, p. 126 The music critic Pierre Lalo wrote that under Messager's direction, Parsifal, without losing any of its grandeur, \"assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order ... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this.\"Lalo, p. 146. Quoted in English in Wagstaff, p. 115 Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, \"[Messager] is not a master of the theatre [\"chef du th\u00e9\u00e2tre\"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait.\"Quoted in Wagstaff, pp. 38\u201339 Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor: > Andr\u00e9 Messager is the most French of conductors; I mean that in this art he > embodies sharpness. Grace and clarity are not uniquely French qualities: > they are frequently found among the Italians and even some Germans. But > sharpness is a French virtue, and nothing but French. M. Andr\u00e9 Messager has > it to an exceptional degree, and it shows in how he writes, orchestrates, > dresses, talks, and plays the piano. But it is when he conducts the > orchestra that what one might call his organic sharpness shows itself most > forcefully.Hahn, Reynaldo, in Musica, September 1908, quoted in Duteurtre, > p. 161 ===Recordings=== In 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the Orchestre de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Concerts du Conservatoire, of Les Chasseresses and Cort\u00e8ge de Bacchus from Sylvia by Delibes, S\u00e9r\u00e9nade and Mules from Impressions d'Italie by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from Samson et Dalila and the Prelude to Le D\u00e9luge, both by Saint-Sa\u00ebns, and 4\u00bd-minute extracts from Capriccio espagnol by Rimsky-Korsakov and Le Rouet d'Omphale by Saint-Sa\u00ebns.Holoman, D.
