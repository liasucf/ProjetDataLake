On 30 April 2014, the Elite League had announced changes to the import rules which would apply to the 2015-16 season: the number of non British-trained players would rise from 12 to 13, while the number of work- permit players would remain at 11. ==Teams== The ten teams were split into two conferences. Teams played the sides in their conferences four times, home and away (32 games), and played the sides in the other conferences twice, home and away (20 games). The season was marked by the disappearance of the Hull Stingrays, who were replaced by the Manchester Phoenix, the first top-level team to play in the city since Manchester Storm folded in 2002-03. Conference champions Sheffield Steelers and Braehead Clan took first and third spot in the league, but, in a repeat of the previous season, neither side could continue their success in the playoffs, which was won by Nottingham Panthers, who beat Coventry Blaze 2-0 in the final.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHwVi1BNMw0 The Challenge Cup was also won by the Panthers who beat the Cardiff Devils in a 1-0 overtime win. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUB9daelK-U Erhardt Conference {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 75%\" ! width=\"35%\" | ! width=\"25%\" | ! width=\"25%\" | ! width=\"15%\" | |- align=left | Belfast Giants || Belfast || SSE Arena Belfast ||align=center| 7,200 |- align=left | Cardiff Devils || Cardiff || Cardiff Arena ||align=center| 2,500 |- align=left | Coventry Blaze || Coventry || SkyDome Arena ||align=center| 3,000 |- align=left | Nottingham Panthers || Nottingham || National Ice Centre ||align=center| 7,500 |- align=left | Sheffield Steelers || Sheffield || Motorpoint Arena ||align=center| 8,500 |} Gardiner Conference {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 75%\" ! width=\"35%\" | ! width=\"25%\" | ! width=\"25%\" | ! width=\"15%\" | |- align=left | Braehead Clan || Glasgow || Braehead Arena ||align=center| 4,000 |- align=left | Dundee Stars || Dundee || Dundee Ice Arena ||align=center| 2,400 |- align=left | Edinburgh Capitals || Edinburgh || Murrayfield Ice Rink ||align=center| 3,700 |- align=left | Fife Flyers || Kirkcaldy || Fife Ice Arena ||align=center| 3,525 |- align=left | Manchester Storm || Altrincham || Altrincham Ice Dome ||align=center| 2,000 |} ==Standings== ===Overall=== ===Erhardt Conference=== Only intra-conference games counted towards the Erhardt Conference standings.
