It is about forty kilometres east of Prince Albert, Saskatchewan.Saskatchewan River Forks, SK | Park Search Canada This provincial park region is heavily wooded, and features steep banks, a tourist picnic site and hiking trails. Area fur posts were of importance to European traders, the English having reached this point in 1692 under Henry Kelsey but did not establish a fort. A French fur-trading post, Fort Le Jonqui\u00e8re, was established on the Saskatchewan or its branches in 1751 by Jacques Legardeur de Saint-Pierre, possibly at or near the forks. In 1753 Fort de la Corne was established in the area by Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne. A major intersection when waterways were important to transportation on the Canadian prairies, first with the fur trade and then during the riverboat era, today the forks attract tourists, canoeists and recreational fishermen. ==See also== * Fort de la Corne * Weldon, Saskatchewan ==References== ==External links== * http://wikimapia.org/937546/ - WikiMapia site showing aerial view of the Saskatchewan River Forks.
