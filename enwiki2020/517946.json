    "text": "Newbiggin-by-the-Sea is a small town and civil parish in Northumberland, England, on the North Sea coast. Once an important port for shipping grain and a coal mining town, it is still a small fishing port making use of traditional coble boats. == Name == Newbiggin derives its name from the Old English n\u012bwe (new) + Middle English bigging (building, house),Anthony David Mills, A Dictionary of British Place-Names (Oxford, 2003) and may refer to an extension of the early settlement and parish of Woodhorn. === Early history === The church was for centuries a chapel only, with a tower surmounted by a spire which was originally used as a beacon. In the 14th century, Newbiggin was a very important maritime centre, called upon to support Edward III in his campaigns against the Scots. In the Middle Ages, Newbiggin was a major port for the shipping of grain, third in importance after London and Hull. Henry III granted a charter for a weekly market on Monday and an annual fair; in 1337, as a borough of note, it sent bailiffs to a council on matters of state, convened by the Bishop of Lincoln, the Earl of Warwick and other noblemen. === 1800 \u2013 present === In 1805, two boats, with nineteen men, were lost in a storm off Newbiggin, after which \u00a31,700 was donated by fundraising in the Newcastle region to relieve the bereaved families. As early as 1828, Newbiggin was a popular beach resort, with facilities to cater for visitors. The town had five public houses, one of which had a spa-like array of bathing facilities, several shops and lodging houses. The village featured a shore, which, being a fine smooth beach about a mile in length, was well suited for bathing, and, by 1848, was much frequented in warmer seasons. Several well-built guesthouses took hold. The bay gave good anchorage for small vessels, but even then was very little used, except for the numerous boats belonging to the fishery, in which most of the inhabitants were employed. The plentiful fish caught were herring, cod, ling, haddock, salmon, trout, turbot, halibut, soles, lobsters and crabs, not only for the supply of the neighbouring markets but the region; and buildings for the curing of herrings. == Governance == Newbiggin-by-the- Sea has a town council. Under the Local Government Act 1972 Newbiggin-by-the- Sea became part of the local government district of Wansbeck in 1974. The local government district was abolished in 2009, with its responsibilities transferred to the Northumberland County Council unitary authority. Newbiggin- by-the-Sea is in the UK Parliamentary constituency of Wansbeck, which since the 2010 General Election has been represented at Westminster by Ian Lavery MP. Wansbeck is one of Northumberland's four Parliamentary constituencies. The former local government district of Wansbeck and the Parliamentary constituency of Wansbeck both derive their names from the River Wansbeck which flows into the North Sea near Newbiggin-by-the-Sea. == Economy == Fishing has always been associated with Newbiggin, although later many inhabitants were employed in coal mining. By the Victorian era, Newbiggin was Northumberland's favourite seaside town, attracting hundreds of visitors every day in the summer months. In 1869, there were 142 cobles (fishing boats) in Newbiggin-by- the-Sea. Newbiggin Colliery was sunk in 1908. The colliery closed in 1967, but at its peak in 1940, 1,400 men were employed there. The former Newbiggin Colliery Band is now the Jayess Newbiggin Brass Band, named for its president and former member, cornet legend James Shepherd. To date, there are 72 active companies based in Newbiggin.https://suite.endole.co.uk/explorer/?id=0DE618985 == Landmarks == The 13th century Parish Church of St Bartholomew, Newbiggin- by-the-SeaThe town was at the end of the first telegraph cable from Scandinavia in 1868, and was laid from Jutland, Denmark.

The lifeboat house and boatyard became the music venue. A stage replaced the boats and the lifeboat house opened its doors, serving food and afternoon tea. Appearances were made by Slade, Leo Sayer and TV show Gladiators star Michael Van Wijk. Starting in 2010, the annual Old Ship Music Festival is attempting to bring back a summer event to the village.
