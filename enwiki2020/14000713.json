Once there, he forms an idea to build a health spa on Maori land. The story took place in New Zealand in 1900 and portrays the conflict between the world of the Maori and the white settlers. A sub plot is the friendship between Tom (the son of the hotel owner where Sir Charles stays) and Sarah Jane (the granddaughter of Sir Charles). While it initially gets off to a rocky start, with Tom getting into a lot of trouble with his friends for being rude to their English guests, it leads to a friendship through which Sir Charles is shown the error of his ways in trying to push through his plans. Eventually, they come to nought as a volcano erupts on the land showing the danger of interfering with Maori land. Doomey Dwyer had an illicit still, which he used to supply his 'grog'. == External links == * * *Children of Fire Mountain listing at TV.com Category:New Zealand children's television series Category:1970s New Zealand television series Category:1979 New Zealand television series debuts Category:1979 New Zealand television series endings Category:Television series set in the 1900s ",
