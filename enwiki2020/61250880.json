    "text": "Timeless Tales was a 2016-2018 hardcover book collection series, compiling the complete runs of several Disney comics titles from IDW Publishing, including Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, Uncle Scrooge and Walt Disney's Comics and Stories. The series were released as compiled collector's editions of the single issues of the run of each comic book title, while also in conjunction with the same issues being released in trade paperback collections. The first series to launch was Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales - Vol 1 in May 2016. After a total of ten hardcover volumes the four lines of the Timeless Tales series were cancelled, ending with the Walt Disney's Comics and Stories Vault - Vol. 1 in mid 2018. == Background == IDW Publishing got the rights to publish Disney Comics in 2015. They launched four monthly comics titles during the spring and summer of 2015. The monthly single floppy issues they later reissued in trade paperback format, containing three single issues each, in 2016 they also began compiling the single issues of the monthly titles in the Timeless Tales hardcover collection, each of these volumes collecting six single issues, the equivalent of two trade paperbacks. The last Timeless Tales volume to be solicited but not released was Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales - Vol. 4 which was meant to collect #19 to #24 of the Uncle Scrooge comic book from IDW Publishing. The volume was scheduled for a release in February 2018 but was never published. == Format == The hardcover volumes of the collections measure 7.5 inches \u00d7 10 inches, (191 mm \u00d7 254 mm). All pages are printed in full color. Extras such as introductions by David Gerstein, interviews and biographies of writers and artists are also \u00edncluded. The MSRP of the volumes collecting six issues each was set at $29.99 while it was set at $34.99 for Walt Disney's Comics and Stories Vault - Vol. 1 and at $39.99 for the Mickey Mouse: Timeless Tales - Vol. 3 since each of these contained approximately 40 to 100 pages more than the other published volumes of the series. Some of the material of the Timeless Tales are since February 2017 also available in digital form via IDW Publishing's digital service and at ComiXology. == Volumes == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"background-color:#B0C4DE\" | Donald Duck: Timeless Tales |- ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" data-sort- type=\"number\" | Volume ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Release date ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Title ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Colleted issues (IDW numbering) | style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Page count ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | ISBN ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | INDUCKS link |- |1||2016-05-31||Donald Duck: Timeless Tales - Vol. 1||#1 \u2013 #6||256||||DD TT 1 |- |2||2017-01-31||Donald Duck: Timeless Tales - Vol. 2||#7 \u2013 #12||256||||DD TT 2 |- |3||2017-08-01||Donald Duck: Timeless Tales - Vol. 3||#13 \u2013 #18||256||||DD TT 3 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"background-color:#B0C4DE\" | Mickey Mouse: Timeless Tales |- ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Volume ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Release date ! style=\"background- color:#D0E4FE\" | Title ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Collected issues (IDW numbering) | style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Page count ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | ISBN ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | INDUCKS link |- |1||2016-06-28||Mickey Mouse: Timeless Tales - Vol. 1||#1 \u2013 #6||260||||MM TT 1 |- |2||2017-02-07||Mickey Mouse: Timeless Tales - Vol. 2||#7 \u2013 #12||256||||MM TT 2 |- |3||2018-03-27||Mickey Mouse: Timeless Tales - Vol. 3||#13 \u2013 #21||352||||MM TT 3 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"background-color:#B0C4DE\" | Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales |- ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Volume ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Release date ! style=\"background- color:#D0E4FE\" | Title ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Colleted issues (IDW numbering) | style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Page count ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | ISBN ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | INDUCKS link |- |1||2016-05-03||Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales - Vol. 1||#1 \u2013 #6||240||||US TT 1 |- |2||2016-12-13||Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales - Vol. 2||#7 \u2013 #12||256||||US TT 2 |- |3||2017-08-15||Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales - Vol. 3||#13 \u2013 #18||256||||US TT 3 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"background-color:#B0C4DE\" | Walt Disney's Comics and Stories Vault |- ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" data-sort-type=\"number\" | Volume ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Release date ! style=\"background- color:#D0E4FE\" | Title ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Collected issues (legacy numbering) | style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | Page count ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | ISBN ! style=\"background-color:#D0E4FE\" | INDUCKS link |- |1||2018-07-31||Walt Disney's Comics and Stories Vault - Vol. 1||#721 \u2013 #734 + 75th Anniversary Special The Search for the Zodiac Stone serial originally featured in these numbers are not included||294||||WDC V 1 |- |} == References == == External links == * IDW Publishing - Donald Duck: Timeless Tales * IDW Publishing - Mickey Mouse: Timeless Tales * IDW Publishing - Uncle Scrooge: Timeless Tales * IDW Publishing - Walt Disney's Comics & Stories Vault Category:2016 comics debuts Category:2018 comics endings Category:IDW Publishing titles Category:Disney comics titles Category:Mickey Mouse Category:Mickey Mouse comics Category:Donald Duck Category:Donald Duck comics Category:Scrooge McDuck Category:Comic book collection books ",
