There are select trips that operate during school hours from Phelps Architecture, Construction and Engineering High School and Friendship Collegiate Academy Public Charter School.

Route X2 is one of the most heavily used bus routes with an average of 12,000 riders as of June 2016, behind the 16th Street Lines and 14th Street Lines. Ridership on the X2 has also been increasing due to development along the H Street and Benning Road corridor. Route X2 currently operates out of Bladensburg division. It is one of the few bus routes to utilize articulated buses. ==History== Route X2 operates under portions of former streetcar lines route 10 which operated under the Washington Railway & Electric Company. The line was created in 1871 which were powered by Horse Trolleys. The line was later run by electric cars by 1895 ad was electrified in 1899. The WR&E; was later acquired by Capital Traction Company to form the Capital Transit Company in 1936. The line was later converted into bus on May 1, 1949 which was renamed into route X2. Afterwards the DC Transit company took over operating buses along H Street and Benning Road. Then WMATA took over DC Transit on December 4, 1973 and incorporated the X1, X2, X3, X4, X5, X6, X7, X8, and X9. Route X1 operated between Minnesota Avenue station and Potomac Park via Washington Union Station and Louisiana Avenue. Route X2 operated between Minnesota Avenue and Union station. Route X3 operated between Minnesota Avenue and McLean Gardens. Route X4 was a new route introduced on November 24, 1978 operating between Minnesota Avenue and Lafayette Square. Route X5 was designated as \"Owl Trips\" operating between Seat Pleasant, Maryland and Lafayette Square. Route X6 would operate between Lafayette Square and Mayfair. All these routes mostly operate along Benning Road and H Street. ==Service Changes== Through the years, route X2 went to major service changes on its route. Routes X4, X5, and X7 discontinued during the years, X6 became the \"National Arboretum Line\" running between the United States National Arboretum and Washington Union Station in the 1990s, and X1 and X3 remains as the Benning Road Line where route X2 was split into the Benning Road-H Street Line. ===1981 Service Changes=== In January 1981, route X2 was extended to Capitol Heights station and X5 was shorten to Capitol Heights station. A new route X7 was created to operate on the old route X2 routing from 1978. ===1991 Service Changes=== On December 28, 1991, route X2 was shorten back to Minnesota Avenue station but was extended to Lafayette Square in order to replace routes X4, X5, X6, and X7. Service to Capitol Heights station from Minnesota Avenue was replaced by route U8. Route X2 was also split from the Benning Road Line and formed to the \"Benning Road-H Street Line\". Short trips are also operated between Minnesota Avenue station and Gallery Place station only during the weekdays. ===2017 Service Changes=== On June 25, 2017, route X2 was given a full 24/7 service due to earlier Metro closing during WMATA's FY2018 budget. At first, buses had a schedule gap of every 100 minutes between 2:30 and 4:10 am but now operates every 30 minutes. ===2017 Proposed Changes=== In 2017 during WMATA's FY2019 budget, WMATA proposed to eliminate route X2 short trips to Gallery Place station and operate the full route to Lafayette Square. However, the frequency of buses will be reduced from every 8 minutes to every 10\u201312 minutes. This was due to the full length route and to adjust the time between midday X2 buses and proposed midday service to route X9. It was also due to create a better balance of capacity and demand throughout the Benning Road and H Street corridor with the implementation of midday route X9, expanded limited-stop MetroExtra hours of service in Northeast, responds to requests by the District Department of Transportation, and provide the ability to add service to route X9 which would provide a weekday midday transfer-free ride throughout the entire corridor between downtown DC and Capitol Heights station. ===2018 Service Change=== On June 24, 2018, all route X2 trips operate between Minnesota Avenue station and Lafayette Square with short trips to Gallery Place station being discontinued. However the frequency of buses were increased from 8 minutes to 10\u201312 minutes. ==Incidents== Route X2 is notoriously infamous for having a high crime rate on its buses. The route suffers from many crimes and fare evasions on its buses.
