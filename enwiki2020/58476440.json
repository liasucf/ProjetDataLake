    "text": "May Gowen Watkis (n\u00e9e Hilda May Gowen; 22 August, 1879 \u2013 6 December 1940) was a Canadian government film agency director, producer, and projectionist. She was a pioneer for women in the Canadian film industry, earning high-ranking positions behind the scenes during a time when women did not have the right to vote. She became the first-ever \"directress\" for the B.C. Patriotic and Educational Picture Service. == Career == British Columbia was the first province to establish a film censorship office, bringing with it career opportunities. Watkis was determined to become join the film industry, but did not believe she would make it as an actress. In 1913, Watkis applied to become a film censor, however, the attorney-general of the time rejected her application and gave the position to a man. Undeterred, Watkis offered her services to the new censor as his assistant, and he hired her as his projectionist. Although Watkis knew nothing about projecting films, she agreed. The British Columbia projectionists' union refused to teach her, as projection was considered to be a man's profession. Across the border in Washington state, she again faced an all-male union that refused to teach her. Instead, Watkis convinced a friend who worked at a local theatre to explain the techniques for projecting films without explaining why she wanted to know, and alongside him projected several shows. Impressed by Watkis's determination, the new censor officially hired her as his assistant. In response to this, the projectionists' union unsuccessfully protested for a month. After a while, her duties bored Watkis, and she became an inspector for the BC Theatres Branch. Her job was to check for breaches of the Amusement Tax Act. Following this, Watkis worked in California in the scenario departments for Hollywood production companies. In 1919, Watkis returned to British Columbia when the new B.C. Patriotic and Educational Picture Service was established and became the organization's first \"directress\". This government film organization was the first of its kind to hire a woman as its head. After spending years working behind the scenes, Watkis seized the opportunity to be directly involved in film production when she became a producer on the 1920 film Beautiful Ocean Falls, directed by R.J. Errington. The film was produced under the British Columbia Patriotic and Educational Picture Service, and is the only one to credit Watkis directly. Watkis' time as \"directress\" for the British Columbia Patriotic and Educational Picture Service was short, as all film activities became regulated under the Provincial Censor's Department in 1921. Watkis' Vancouver office was closed following that decision. == Filmography == The British Columbia Patriotic and Educational Picture Service had more than 100 films in circulation during the time it was active, but Beautiful Ocean Falls is the only film to have survived. Some of those films may have credited Watkis. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Film !Type !Role |- |1920 |Beautiful Ocean Falls |Government Promotional Film |Producer |} ==References== Category:Canadian women film producers Category:Projectionists Category:1879 births Category:1940 deaths ",
