The town was built in the basin of the eastern banks of the Cher River which separates it from the commune of Orval, to which it is connected by two bridges. A small river, the Marmande, joins the Cher here, and the canal de Berry crosses the commune from southeast to southwest. Some flooding is common because of the nearby marshes. The town is the capital of the small region of Boischaut, known for its woodland and cattle pastures. ===Population=== Town hall ==History== The settlement of Saint-Amand goes back to prehistoric times.
