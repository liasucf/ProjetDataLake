    "text": "Count of Guise and Duke of Guise (pronounced [\u0261\u0265iz]) were titles in the French nobility. Originally a seigneurie, in 1417 Guise was erected into a county for Ren\u00e9, a younger son of Louis II of Anjou. While disputed by the House of Luxembourg (1425\u20131444), the county was ultimately retained by the House of Anjou and its descendants, passing in 1520 to the cadet branch of the ducal House of Lorraine that became known as the House of Guise, headed by Claude of Lorraine. In 1528, the county was elevated to a dukedom and peerage of France for him. The Dukes of Guise and their sons played a prominent role in the French Wars of Religion, during which they were the leaders of the ultra- Catholic faction. This dukedom became extinct in 1688, and the lands attached to it passed to the Princess Palatine Anne, a great-granddaughter of Charles of Lorraine-Guise, Duke of Mayenne \u2013 although she was not the heiress in strict primogeniture, that being the Duke of Mantua. The dukedom was recreated for Anne and her husband, Henri Jules de Bourbon, Prince of Cond\u00e9 in 1704. On the extinction of the Bourbon-Cond\u00e9 family in 1830, the Guise dukedom was inherited by the House of Orl\u00e9ans, descendants of Anne's granddaughter Louise Henriette de Bourbon, Duchess of Orleans. Louis Philippe of Orl\u00e9ans having become King of the French in 1830, henceforth the title Duke of Guise was used as a courtesy title for members of this family after it was deposed and went into exile in 1848, firstly for three sons of Prince Henri, Duke of Aumale, and then for Prince Jean, son of Robert d'Orl\u00e9ans, Duke of Chartres. In 1926, Jean, Duke of Guise became the Orl\u00e9anist claimant to the throne of France as \"Jean III\". ==Counts of Guise (1417\u20131481 and 1491\u20131528)== ===House of Anjou=== right *Ren\u00e9 I of Naples (Ren\u00e9) (1417-1425) ===House of Luxembourg=== right right The House of Luxembourg had disputed the countship of Guise, and with the approval of John, Duke of Bedford, English Regent of France, seized the county in 1425. *John, Count of Ligny (John I) (1425-1441) *Louis de Luxembourg, Count of Saint-Pol (Louis I) (1441-1444) ===House of Anjou=== right right The marriage of Charles of Le Maine, younger brother of Ren\u00e9, to Isabelle of Luxembourg, sister of Louis, allowed him to peacefully recover Guise. *Charles of Le Maine (Charles I) (1444-1472) *Charles IV, Duke of Anjou (Charles II) (1472-1481) ===House of Armagnac \u2013 House of Rohan=== 50px 50px Charles IV left his lands to the Crown, but Guise was granted to his nephew Louis in 1491. *Louis d'Armagnac, Duke of Nemours (Louis II) (1491-1503) *Marguerite d'Armagnac, duchesse de Nemours (Marguerite) (d. 1503) **held by her husband Pierre de Rohan-Gi\u00e9 (Peter) (1503-1504) *Charlotte d'Armagnac, duchesse de Nemours (Charlotte) (d. 1504) **held by her husband Charles de Rohan-Gi\u00e9 (Charles III) (1504-1520) ===House of Lorraine=== right In 1520, the Parlement of Paris awarded the countship of Guise to Claude of Lorraine, second son of Ren\u00e9 II of Lorraine (the grandson of Ren\u00e9 I of Naples) and heir to his French possessions.
