Retrieved 15 November 2013 ==History== Born in D\u00fcsseldorf, Pole took his name from a Waldorf 4-Pole filter, which he accidentally dropped and broke in 1996. Though the filter was perhaps no longer appropriate for DJ work in its damaged state, Betke found the strange hissing and popping noises the filter now made interesting sounds. He then began using the broken filter to create music, launching his musical career. Betke's first four albums, titled 1, 2, 3, and R (an intentional trilogy of albums, followed by a collection of remixes of Pole's 1998 debut EP Raum), were all based around this filter, with songs usually taking the form of dub basslines and rhythms with percussion provided by the eponymous filter. In 2003 Betke departed from this style for the album Pole (a combination of tracks from two EPs, \"45/45\" and \"90/90\"), which utilized more traditionally electronic but still eclectic production. Pole has been distributed on several different labels, including Matador Records and Mute Records, and in 1999 Betke cofounded (with Barbara Preisinger) the label ~scape, also known for publishing Jan Jelinek. On September 1, 2011, Betke founded a new artist label named Pole. Betke also mastered John Frusciante's 2016 EP, Foregrow. == Discography == ===Albums=== * 1 (1998) * 2 (1999) * 3 (2000) * R (2001) * Pole (2003) * Steingarten (2007) * Wald (2015) ===Singles=== * Waldgeschichten (2011) * Waldgeschichten 2 (2011) * Waldgeschichten 3 (2012) ==References== ==External links== * *Pole site at Matador Records *Pole biography at ~scape Records *[ Pole discography] at All Media Guide *Pole interview at The Milk Factory *Real Detroit Weekly Interview Category:German electronic musicians Category:Ambient musicians Category:Intelligent dance musicians Category:Mute Records artists Category:Matador Records artists Category:1967 births Category:Living people ",
