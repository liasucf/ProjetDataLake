    "text": "\"It's All the Way Live (Now)\" is a song by American rapper Coolio. It was released in May 1996 as the lead single to the Eddie soundtrack. The song became Coolio's fifth top-40 single and his fourth to achieve at least a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies. The song sampled \"It's All the Way Live\" by funk band Lakeside, his second single to both sample and take the name from a Lakeside song after his 1994 hit, \"Fantastic Voyage\". Despite being one of Coolio's biggest hits, the song did not appear on his 2001 Tommy Boy Records Greatest Hits compilation. This was due to the fact Hollywood Records, who released the Eddie soundtrack, owned the rights to the song. ==Single track listing== #\"It's All the Way Live (Now)\" \u2013 3:36 #\"1, 2, 3, 4 (Sumpin' New)\" (Timber mix) \u2013 3:21 ==Charts== ===Peak positions=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1996) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |UK Singles (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|34 |- |Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|29 |- |Billboard Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks |align=\"center\"|47 |- |Billboard Hot Rap Singles |align=\"center\"|9 |- |Billboard Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales |align=\"center\"|32 |- |Billboard Rhythmic Top 40 |align=\"center\"|23 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1996) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=\"center\"|20 |} ==References== Category:1996 singles Category:Coolio songs Category:1996 songs Category:Hollywood Records singles ",
