    "text": "Ta\u1e25annuth was a religious practice undertaken in pre- and early Islamic Arabia, in which the participant spend time in isolation, turning away from paganism. ==Etymology== According to Bleeker, the term ta\u1e25annuth has been interpreted in several ways. Traditionally, ta\u1e25annuth means spending time in seclusion, as practiced by the Quraysh, the chief tribe of Mecca in the 6th and 7th century, and the prophet Muhammad, who each year spend time in isolation at mount Hira', where he also received his revelations. According to Ibn Hisham and al-Tabari, ta\u1e25annuth may be interpreted as tabarrur, \"the holding of pious exercises.\" Ta\u1e25annuth is also read as 'ta\u1e25annuf, that is, al- hanifyya, the religion of the hanif. Al-Bukhari interprets ta\u1e25annuth as ta'abbud, \"worshipping.\" According to Bleeker, ta\u1e25annuth may also be traced to Hebrew tehinnot, private prayers. A third possibility is that it is derived from hinth, sin, meaning \"puryfying from sin, avoidance of sin,\" the sin of paganism, akin to the Henrew-Aramaic root h-n-ph, to be a pagan. In that case, ta\u1e25annuth means \"turning away from paganism.\" ==See also== * Hanif ==References== ==Sources== * ==External links== * Tahannuth, WikiShia * The Prophet Mu\u1e25ammad (SAW)\u2019s practice of \u2018ta\u1e25annuth\u2019 or \u2018ta\u1e25annuf\u2019 (Haykal) * Sally Mallam, The Community of Believers Category:Islam ",
