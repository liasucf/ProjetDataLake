It is located near Mukim Rambai in the Tutong District, about 70 km from the capital, Bandar Seri Begawan.Museums Department. (2010). Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park. BSB: Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports The S-shaped lake is located 27 km from Tutong Town and it is surrounded by the 7800-hectare Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park. == Physical environment and facilities == Tasek Merimbun is dark in color; a phenomenon generated by tannin coming from leaves falling into the water. The lake supports a rich variety of fauna including birds, mammals and reptiles. Visitors can hire a boat to take them around to explore the lake and its two islands. There is a small island in the center body of water that can be reached via a wooden walkway. Here, picnic pavilion facilities fashioned from logs enhance enjoyment of this restful spot. Chalet facilities for researchers are available nearby. == ASEAN Heritage Park == In 1967, the first Director of the Brunei Museums Department suggested Tasek Merimbun as a valuable asset and a potential Wildlife Sanctuary. A survey on Tasek Merimbun's bio-diversity and socio-economic activities conducted in 1983-84 led to the discovery of a rare White-collared Fruit Bat. This discovery was a major reason for the 29 November 1984 designation of Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park as the eleventh ASEAN Heritage Park.Museums Department. (2010). Tasek Merimbun Heritage Park. BSB: Ministry of Culture, Youth and Sports ===Important Bird Area=== The park has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because its forest and freshwater wetland habitats support endangered Storm's storks. ==See also== *Protected areas of Brunei == References == Category:Bodies of water of Brunei Category:Lakes of Asia Category:Tutong District Category:Protected areas of Brunei Category:Important Bird Areas of Brunei ",
