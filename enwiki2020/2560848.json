It inhabits the basins of the Paran\u00e1 River and the Uruguay River around the Argentine Mesopotamia, Paraguay and Uruguay, and part of the R\u00edo de la Plata. The common names of this tree, in Spanish, include the adjective amarillo (\"yellow\") due to the yellow-ochre colour of its wood: amarillo, palo amarillo, amarillo del r\u00edo, etc. This species is found in the gallery forest along the shores of large rivers in the north-east of Argentina and the neighbouring countries. Its wood is finely textured, homogeneous, and moderately heavy (relative density = 0.65). It is used for ornamental and precision works, such as chess pieces, rulers, buttons, etc. ==References== australis Category:Trees of Argentina Category:Trees of Paraguay Category:Trees of Uruguay ",
