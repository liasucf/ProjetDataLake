It is managed by the Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire. This site has ash and maple woodland, and dense blackthorn scrub. It is described by Natural England as one of the most important sites in Britain for the black hairstreak butterfly, which requires a habitat of prunus species such as blackthorn. The scrub also provides nesting sites for nightingales. There is an entrance to the site at the south-east corner. ==References== Category:Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire and Northamptonshire reserves Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Northamptonshire ",
