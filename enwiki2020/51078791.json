    "text": "William David Reeves (born 18 December 1996) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Northern Premier League Division One South East side Leek Town. He began his career at Port Vale in April 2015, and later went out on loan to Witton Albion, Hyde United and Stafford Rangers. He was released by Port Vale in May 2018 and joined Leek Town via Stafford Rangers later in the year. ==Playing career== ===Port Vale=== Reeves graduated through the Port Vale Academy to sign professional forms in April 2015. He joined Northern Premier League Division One North side Witton Albion on a one- month loan in November 2015. His loan was extended after he established himself in the first team and he went on to make 14 appearances, scoring one goal in a 5\u20130 win over Harrogate Railway Athletic on 2 January. He then joined Hyde United on a one-month loan in February 2016. He also made 14 appearances for Hyde, as the club were relegated out of the Northern Premier League Premier Division. On 16 September 2016, he returned to Witton Albion \u2013 now playing in the Northern Premier League Division One South \u2013 on a 28-day loan. He returned to Witton Albion on loan in mid-November, but played just two games before being sidelined with injury. He joined Stafford Rangers of the Northern Premier League Premier Division on a 28-day loan on 3 February 2017. He made his EFL League One debut for Port Vale after coming on as a 47th- minute substitute for Danny Pugh in a 1\u20131 draw with Southend United at Roots Hall on 4 March. After two further substitute appearances that month he thanked central midfield partner Sam Foley and caretaker-manager Michael Brown for helping him to adapt to League One football. He went on to feature in 12 of the club's final 14 games of the 2016\u201317 relegation campaign, and signed a new one-year contract in May 2017. On 7 November 2017, he scored his first goal in professional football in a 4\u20132 victory over Crewe Alexandra in an EFL Trophy group stage match at Vale Park. However he featured just eight times for the \"Valiants\" during the 2017\u201318 campaign and was not retained by new manager Neil Aspin in May 2018. ===Non-league=== On 14 August 2018, Reeves joined Stafford Rangers on a short-term contract. On 25 September 2018, he moved on to Northern Premier League Division One West club Leek Town after manager Neil Baker lost six players to injury. The \"Blues\" reached the play- offs at the end of the 2018\u201319 season, but lost 2\u20131 to Radcliffe in the final. The 2019\u201320 season was formally abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic in England, with no promotions taking place despite Leek sitting top of the Division One South East table. ==Style of play== The Port Vale website described Reeves as an \"energetic technical midfielder\". Port Vale youth team coach Mick Ede said that: \"he is a powerful player who is good with the ball at his feet\". ==Statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=4|Port Vale||2015\u201316||League One||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317||EFL League One||12||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||12||0 |- |2017\u201318||EFL League Two||3||0||1||0||1||0||3||1||8||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !15!!0!!1!!0!!1!!0!!3!!1!!20!!1 |- |Witton Albion (loan)||2015\u201316||Northern Premier League Division One North||14||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||14||1 |- |Hyde United (loan)||2015\u201316||Northern Premier League Premier Division||14||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||14||0 |- |Witton Albion (loan)||2016\u201317||Northern Premier League Division One South||6||0||2||0||0||0||1||0||9||0 |- |rowspan=4|Leek Town||2018\u201319||Northern Premier League Division One West||23||1||0||0||0||0||2||0||25||1 |- |2019\u201320||Northern Premier League Division One South East||24||2||4||0||1||0||3||0||32||2 |- |2020\u201321||Northern Premier League Division One South East||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !47!!3!!4!!0!!1!!0!!5!!0!!57!!3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !96!!4!!7!!0!!2!!0!!9!!1!!104!!5 |} ==References== Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Wrexham Category:Welsh footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Witton Albion F.C. players Category:Hyde United F.C. players Category:Stafford Rangers F.C. players Category:Leek Town F.C. players Category:Northern Premier League players Category:English Football League players ",
