    "text": "The Scream was an American, Los Angeles, California-based hard rock band, originally formed in 1989 as Saints Or Sinners. The band originally featured former Angora singer John Corabi and former Racer X members guitarist Bruce Bouillet, bassist Juan Alderete, and drummer Scott Travis. However, Scott Travis quickly left to join Judas Priest, and was replaced by former Shark Island drummer Walt Woodward III. Scott Travis co-wrote \"I Don't Care\" on Let It Scream, though he did not actually play on the album. They changed their name from Saints Or Sinners to The Scream shortly after Walt Woodward III replaced Scott Travis. Many of the songs on their 1991 debut Let It Scream were performed by the band in concert before the album was ever recorded. After releasing their 1991 debut Let It Scream on Hollywood Records, which included the single \"I Believe in Me,\" Corabi left the band to replace the recently departed Vince Neil in M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce. The Scream then recruited former Dashboard Mary singer Billy Fogarty and recorded their second album, Takin' It To The Next Level, but were dropped from the record label before the album could be released. The Scream split up and Fogarty, Bouillet and Alderete went on to form a brief musical project with John Moore and drummer Abe Laboriel, Jr. called DC-10, which recorded and released the album Co-Burn. John Corabi joined M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce after Vince Neil's departure and recorded the self-titled 1994 album with the band. However, poor sales and inadequate tour support resulted in Vince Neil's return to the band. Corabi has played in many bands since, including Ratt, Union and E.S.P., a covers band with other big names Eric Singer, Bruce Kulick, Chuck Garrick and Karl Cochran (often performing many songs from the various members well known bands). Since February 2015, Corabi has joined The Dead Daisies with which he has recorded two studio albums (Revoluci\u00f3n in 2015, and Make Some Noise in 2016). Walt Woodward III died on June 8, 2010, of alcohol poisoning. ==Members== * John Corabi - vocals, acoustic guitar (1989\u20131992) * Billy Fogarty - vocals (1992\u20131993) * Bruce Bouillet - guitars (1989\u20131993) * Juan Alderete (as John Alderete) - bass guitars, backing vocals (1989\u20131993) * Scott Travis - drums (1989) * Walt Woodward III - drums, percussion, backing vocals (1990\u20131993) ==Timeline== ImageSize = width:800 height:auto barincrement:18 PlotArea = left:110 bottom:90 top:10 right:20 Alignbars = justify DateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy Period = from:01/01/1989 till:01/01/1994 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy Legend = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4 ScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1989 ScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1993 Colors = id:vocals value:red legend:Vocals id:bass value:blue legend:Bass id:guitar value:green legend:Guitars id:drums value:orange legend:Drums BarData = bar:John text:John Corabi bar:Billy text:Billy Fogarty bar:Bruce text:Bruce Bouillet bar:Juan text:Juan Alderete bar:Scott text:Scott Travis bar:Walt text:Walt Woodward III PlotData = width:11 textcolor:black align:left anchor:from shift:(11,-4) bar:John from:01/01/1989 till:31/12/1991 color:vocals bar:Billy from:01/01/1992 till:end color:vocals bar:Bruce from:01/01/1989 till:end color:guitar bar:Juan from:01/01/1989 till:end color:bass bar:Scott from:01/01/1989 till:31/12/1989 color:drums bar:Walt from:01/01/1990 till:end color:drums ==Discography== * Let It Scream (1991) * Takin' It To The Next Level (unreleased, recorded 1993) In 1992, they released the single \"Young And Dumb\" for the movie Encino Man, (the track is played in \"Blades\", while 'Link' paints with ketchup and mustard). ==References== ==Related links== * Out of your speakers and into your living room...it's THE SCREAM!
