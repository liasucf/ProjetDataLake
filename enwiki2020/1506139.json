Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 259-261 says that, during the reign of Ailill Finn, he killed F\u00edachu Tolgrach in battle, but was forced into exile overseas by Ailill's son Eochu, Lugaid son of Eochu F\u00edadmuine, and the men of Munster. He returned to Ireland after seven years, and, with the help of Dui Ladrach, killed Ailill. Eochu became king, but Airgetmar and Dui soon killed him as well, and Airgetmar took power. Geoffrey KeatingGeoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 tells a slightly different story of Airgetmar's accession. Eochu withstood Airgetmar, made an alliance with Dui and ruled for seven years, but Dui treacherously killed him at a meeting and Airgetmar took the throne. He ruled for thirty years (according to the Lebor Gab\u00e1la and the Annals of the Four Masters),Annals of the Four Masters M4422-4452 or twenty-three or thirty-eight years (according to Keating), after which he was killed by Dui and Eochu's son Lugaid Laigdech. Dui, who had now had a hand in the killing of four High Kings, took the throne. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Artaxerxes III of Persia (358\u2013338 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 570\u2013547 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 778\u2013748 BC. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
