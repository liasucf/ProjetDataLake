    "text": "Ariane is a one-act opera by Bohuslav Martin\u016f to a French libretto by the composer drawn from the 2nd, 3rd and 4th acts of the 1943 play by Georges Neveux, Le Voyage de Th\u00e9s\u00e9e, (who had supplied the text to the composer's earlier opera Julietta).Smaczny, Jan. Ariane. In: The New Grove Dictionary of Opera. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. ==Performance history== Martin\u016f composed Ariane in 1958 whilst working on his final opera, The Greek Passion \u2013 he described it in a letter to his family as 'taking a rest' from the larger work. The composition took just over a month. The bravura style of the writing for Ariadne reflects Martin\u016f's admiration of Maria Callas. The opera is in a straightforward lyrical style with deliberate references to the operas of Monteverdi and other early composers. Grove describes the music as being in a \"warm, mainly tonal lyricism\", at times \"enlivened by neo-Baroque rhythmic patterns\". The first performance took place in 1961 at the Musiktheater im Revier in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, as the centre-piece of a triple-bill with Mahagonny by Brecht and Weill and Der Analphabet by Ivo Lhotka-Kalinski, two years after the composer's death. The Czech premiere took place on 23 October 1962 in Brno alongside Ariadne pieces by Claudio Monteverdi and Jiri Antonin Benda, conducted by Richard Tyn, with Miriam \u0160upurkovsk\u00e1 in the title role. In September that year the opera was broadcast live radio on Czechoslovak Radio Brno, conducted by Frantisek Jilek, with Cecilie Str\u00e1dalov\u00e1. The Russian premiere was in Moscow in March 2016, conducted by Maria Maksimchuk.Russian premiere of Bohuslav Martin\u016f\u00b4s opera Ariadne in Moscow on March 13 accessed 10 June 2016. ==Roles== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Role !Voice type !Premiere castTaken from the theatre programme for 2 March 1961, St\u00e4dtische B\u00fchnen Gelsenkirchen. 2 March 1961 Conductor: Ljubomir Romansky |- |Ariane (Ariadne) |soprano |Annemarie D\u00f6litzsch |- |Th\u00e9s\u00e9e (Theseus) |baritone |Klaus Kirchner |- |Minotaur |bass |Walther Finkelberg |- |Bouroun Theseus's comrade |tenor |Willi Kunzmann |- |Watchman, tenor |bass |Erich Benke |- |Old Man |bass |Theo Strosyk |- |Five youths of Athens, companions of Theseus |tenors and basses |Josef Connotte, Otto Heppenheimer, Eduard Mayer, G\u00fcnter Reich, Franz Wyzner |- |} ==Synopsis== The story is a surrealist version of the myth of Theseus, Ariadne, and the Minotaur. In this version of the myth, Minotaur and Theseus looks alike - and Theseus discerns part of his own personality in the monster; by killing it he destroys his love for Ariadne. ;Prologue \u2013 Sinfonia 1 The Watchman learns of the arrival in Knossos of Th\u00e9s\u00e9e and his companions from a passing seagull. ;Scene 1 Th\u00e9s\u00e9e seeks the Minotaur and encounters Ariane. In an ambiguous conversation they seem to fall in love \u2013 but Ariane's love may be in fact for the Minotaur. The Old Man announces that the king's daughter is to be married to a stranger. Ariane reveals that she is the king's daughter and Th\u00e9s\u00e9e is the stranger \u2013 and asks for his name. ;Scene 2 After a second sinfonia, Bouroun is dissatisfied that Th\u00e9s\u00e9e's infatuation with Ariane is preventing him from killing the Minotaur. Resolving to do the deed himself, he is killed by the Minotaur (offstage). When the Minotaur appears, he turns out to be Theseus's double, and taunts him \u2013 \"who dares lift his hand to strike himself a death- blow?\". Th\u00e9s\u00e9e slays the Minotaur however. ;Scene 3 A third sinfonia separates the scenes. Th\u00e9s\u00e9e and his companions desert Ariane, whose lyrical lament closes the opera. The whole opera, including the three miniature sinfonias which introduce and punctuate it, lasts little more than 40 minutes (of which Ariane's lament takes about 9). ==References== ;Sources *Grove Music Online *Notes to CD recording of the opera by Supraphon (1988), CD 104395-2 (Czech Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by V\u00e1clav Neumann).
