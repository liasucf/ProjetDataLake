But the country sickness forced him to return to his native commune where he became a sandal worker. Difficulty feeding led him to accept a job as a gravel digger on the Pau-Laruns railway, then as a sandaler in Bayonne, where wages were higher. At his places of work, his voice was noticed by two Basque music lovers, who introduced him to the director of the music school, Mr. Jubin, and then to his first teacher, Gaston Salzedo. With this one, Sal\u00e9za, who had hitherto received only a basic education, made rapid progress in all fields: instruction, diction, singing, music... so much so that he won the First prize of the school in 1886, which allowed him to integrate the Conservatoire de Paris where he won again the first prize in singing and the second prize in opera before a jury composed notably of L\u00e9o Delibes and Ambroise Thomas. On leaving the conservatory, because of his fragile health, he chose the Op\u00e9ra- Comique instead of the Opera which would have been too demanding so quickly. From his first role, Mylio in Le roi d'Ys, his performance aroused the enthusiasm of the audience at the Salle Favart. From the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Albert Sal\u00e9za moved on to the Op\u00e9ra de Nice where he recovered his strength. He gained further notoriety by interpreting Faust, Rom\u00e9o et Juliette, Carmen, Richard III... Benque & cie. In 1892, Ernest Reyer noticed him and offered him the consecration by giving him a role tailored to his needs at the Paris Opera: Matho in Salammb\u00f4. The triumph he obtained allowed him to repeat success after success: Le Cid, Die Walk\u00fcre, la Damnation de Faust His fame was so great that Verdi offered him the role of Otello that he performeded 35 times until May 1895. Unfortunately, health problems hit his vocal chords and forced him to stop for 2 years. In 1897, Sal\u00e9za returned to the Op\u00e9ra de Paris, then, in Monte Carlo, Brussels and Covent Garden of London where he sang in particular in Carmen with Emma Calv\u00e9, and Rom\u00e9o et Juliette with Nellie Melba, and very often in front of the future king Edward VII. He reached the pinnacle of his glory in Chicago and the Metropolitan of New York, thanks to his interpretations in Faust, Lucia di Lammermoor, Les Huguenots\u2026 In 1912, after all these successes abroad, he returned to France and was appointed professor of lyric declamation at the Conservatoire where his results turned out to be excellent with students who won all the first prizes. But on 26 November 1916, this new career came to a sudden halt when he collapsed during a mass in the . Sal\u00e9za married in 1895 to Pauline Bonnecarr\u00e8re (1875\u20131953) and had three children: Mylio (1896\u20131957), Madeleine (1899\u20131913), and Jos\u00e9 (1905\u2013?).
