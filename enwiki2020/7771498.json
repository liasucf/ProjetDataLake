    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda (abbreviated Jos\u00e9 M\u00aa) is a Spanish language male given name, usually considered a single given name rather than two names, and is a combination of the Spanish names of Joseph and Mary, the parents of Jesus Christ.Rafael Falc\u00f3n, Christine Yoder Falc\u00f3n - Salsa: A Taste of Hispanic Culture Page 32 1998 \"... though Maria, when used for a male, is usually in the format of a middle name: Jose Maria or Jesus Maria, for example.\" The separate names \"Jos\u00e9\" for males and \"Mar\u00eda\" for females also exist in the Spanish language. They can also combine in the inverse order forming the female name \"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9\" (M\u00aa Jos\u00e9); that is, the gender of the compound names \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda\" and \"Mar\u00eda Jos\u00e9\" is determined by their first component. The name \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda\" is colloquially shortened to \"Jos\u00e9 Mari\", \"Josema\" or replaced by the hypocoristic forms \"Chema\", \"Chemari\" or \"Chemis\". There are also combinations of other male given names with Mar\u00eda, for example Carlos Mar\u00eda, Juan Mar\u00eda and Luis Mar\u00eda. \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda\", with its Portuguese language equivalent Jos\u00e9 Maria (notice the absence of the acute accent over the i in the Portuguese version) is a common name, and many famous people have this name or a similar one: ==Spanish names== *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Ach\u00e1, President of Bolivia from 1861 to 1864 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Amorrortu, Spanish football player and manager *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, President of the Government of Spain from 1996 to 2004 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Barreda, President of the Spanish autonomous region of Castile-La Mancha *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Callej\u00f3n (born 1987), Spanish football (soccer) player *Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1, Spanish Catholic priest - founder of Opus Dei *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Franco, Uruguayan footballer *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Garc\u00eda Lafuente, commonly known as \"Jos\u00e9 Mari\": Spanish footballer, born 1971 *Jose Mari Gonzales, Filipino actor *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Guti\u00e9rrez, commonly known as \"Guti\": Spanish footballer *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Hern\u00e1ndez, Spanish politician *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Linares, President of Bolivia from 1857 to 1861 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Mart\u00edn Bejarano-Serrano, commonly known as \"Jos\u00e9 Mari\": Spanish footballer, born 1987 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, Mexican revolutionary *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Napole\u00f3n, Mexican singer and songwriter, born 1950 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, Spanish golfer, born 1966 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Romero Poy\u00f3n, commonly known as \"Jos\u00e9 Mari\": Spanish footballer, born 1978 *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Ruiz Mateos, Spanish businessman and former politician *Jose Maria Sison, a notorious Filipino of the Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas who blended elements of Maoism to his ideology; viewed by many as a terrorist *Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Z\u00e1rraga, Spanish international footballer ==Portuguese names== *Miguel Boaventura Lucena, known as \"Jos\u00e9 Maria de Santo Agostinho\" or simply \"Jos\u00e9 Maria\": a mystic leader in the Contestado War in Brazil *Jos\u00e9 Maria Marin, Brazilian politician *Jos\u00e9 Maria Rodrigues Alves, nicknamed \"Z\u00e9 Maria\": retired Brazilian footballer ==See also== * * *Z\u00e9 Maria ==References== Category:Spanish masculine given names ",
