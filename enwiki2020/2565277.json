    "text": "Spondias is a genus of flowering plants in the cashew family, Anacardiaceae. The genus consists of 17 described species, 7 of which are native to the Neotropics and about 10 are native to tropical Asia. They are commonly named hog plums, Spanish plums, libas in Bikol and in some cases golden apples for their brightly colored fruit which resemble an apple or small plum at a casual glance. They are only distantly related to apple and plum trees, however. A more unequivocal common name is mombins. Spondias dulcis, fruit, section and seed A theory regarding the name of the city of Bangkok, Thailand is that the name is derived from ; 'water olive', the Thai name for the fruit of Spondias dulcis.\"\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19\u0e41\u0e25\u0e30\u0e15\u0e33\u0e1a\u0e25\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e15\u0e31\u0e49\u0e07\u0e27\u0e31\u0e14\" , watarun.org, accessed March 29, 2011.

Spondias pinnata is called Pulicha kaai in the Tamil language, which means \"sour fruit.\" It is also called \"Amate Kaai\" in the Kannada language, Ambade in Tulu and Konkani. In Sri Lanka it is called Amberella. ==Description== They are deciduous or semi- evergreen trees growing to 25 m tall. The leaves are spirally arranged, pinnate, rarely bipinnate or simple. The fruit is a drupe similar to a small mango (in the related genus Mangifera), 4\u201310 cm long, ripening yellow or orange. It has a single seed. The Malesian species of Spondias were revised by Ding Hou in 1978.Flora Malesiana series 1, 8(3):395-577. The most recently recognized species, Spondias testudinis, was described in 1998.John D. Mitchell and Douglas C. Daly. 1998. \"The \"tortoise's caj\u00e1\" - a new species of Spondias (Anacardiaceae) from southwestern Amazonia\" Brittonia 50( ):447-451. ==As food== Preserved ma-kok, sweet and sour with chili About 10 species of Spondias bear edible fruits and have been domesticated for fruit production. These fruits are also consumed by herbivorous mammals such as deer. In the Western Ghats of Karnataka flower buds and tender fruits are used in pickle preparation. In Thai cuisine both the fruits and the tender leaves are eaten. ==Selected species== , Plants of the World online has 19 accepted species: {| |- valign=top | * Spondias acida * Spondias admirabilis * Spondias bahiensis * Spondias bipinnata * Spondias dulcis -- Tahitian apple, pommecythere (Trinidad & Tobago) * Spondias expeditionaria * Spondias globosa * Spondias macrocarpa * Spondias malayana * Spondias mombin -- Yellow mombin, gully plum, Ashanti plum, \"Java plum\" | * Spondias novoguineensis * Spondias pinnata * Spondias purpurea -- Jocote, purple mombin, red mombin, ciruela, siniguela, sirigwela * Spondias radlkoferi * Spondias tefyi * Spondias testudinis * Spondias tuberosa -- Umb\u00fa, imbu, Brazil plum * Spondias venulosa * Spondias xerophila |} Selected synonyms include: * Spondias cytherea -- synonym of Spondias dulcis * Spondias haplophylla -- synonym of Bouea oppositifolia * Spondias indica -- synonym of Solenocarpus indicus * Spondias lakonensis -- synonym of Allospondias lakonensis ==References== ==External links== Category:Anacardiaceae genera Category:Fruit trees ",
