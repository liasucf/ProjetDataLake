Steam from the plant is used for residential heating in the winter. ==Illness and deaths due to air pollution== According to Greenpeace Soma is the deadliest power station in Turkey, and deadlier than any power station in Europe, being responsible for 13 thousand lost years of life and 282 thousand lost working days in 2010. Although the company is contracted to install pollution control, such as desulpherization it may not be financially viable to do so. ==Subsidies== In 2018 the plant received 110 million lira capacity payments, and 148 million in 2019 both the largest in Turkey. ==Coal== The power station burns lignite from the nearby Soma coal mine. ==References== == External links == * WRI ID: WRI1018707 * Soma power station on Global Energy Monitor Category:Coal-fired power stations in Turkey ",
