Thus, Chant de Linos is based on the mythological musician Linus, who taught music to Orpheus and Heracles. Jolivet described the work as an ancient Greek mourning chant consisting of laments interspersed with cries and dances. In the work, the laments are usually in while a strongly accented ostinato in sets the dance sections apart. The piece is based on an archaic- sounding modal scale (G, A, B, C, D and F).
