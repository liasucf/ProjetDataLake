In 1955, he moved with his family down to Miami and was the founding rabbi of Temple Beth Am, located in Pinecrest, Florida. Being inspired by Stephen Samuel Wise and Mordecai Kaplan, his idea was to shift Beth Am to a synagogue, while emphasizing education. He served as the head rabbi there for over 30 years. Upon retiring in 1987, he had built it from 55 families meeting at a church to 1,700 families on a 14-acre campus that included a day school and a youth basketball league, becoming the largest Reform congregation in the Southeast.

He was among the Jewish leaders to meet with Pope John Paul II during his 1987 visit to Miami. Specializing in the study of the Hebrew prophets, he was the author of several books, including The Miracles of Jesus and the Miracles of the Early Hebrew Prophets, Loving What is Close, Judaism and Prayer: Issues of Faith, and Finding My Way to God. == Personal life == Rabbi Herbert Baumgard (right) with wife Selma (left), and Eleanor Roosevelt (center) Baumgard married Selma Geller, one of his students at Colombia who would later found the Temple Beth Am choir.
