National Movement advocates fight for the sovereignty of the country, to repair the political and economic state and defending the freedom of its citizens, as well as the realisation in the sphere of culture and politics of traditional values. The purpose of the Movement is a fundamental social change - the so-called. \"Overthrow of the republic of the Round Table\". Declares itself as a social movement which is a network of community initiatives for state sovereignty and national identity. In the absence of hierarchical and organisational dependencies, the movement will be guided by the common symbols, and the demands of the electorate. One of the symbols is the image of the nationalist right, which formed in the struggle for Polish independence. For most of the activists of the Movement such symbols are also soldiers of the army of the underground National Armed Forces (NSZ), who fought during World War II and after the war against the German and Soviet occupation. National Armed Forces, founded by the military part of the underground organisation nationalist camp in 1942, also declared obedience to submit to the Army. Among the soldiers of the National Armed Forces of the Supervisory Board sees its historical similarity and should continue to operate. Fundamental important dates to the Movement is the day commemorating the creation of the National Armed Forces attributable to 22 September, the anniversary of Captain Witold Pilecki's death sentence and 1 March - National Day of Remembrance \"Soldiers accursed\" (from 2011 official holiday) and attributable to the November 11 march Independence. National Movement is also trying to commemorate the anniversary of the imposition of martial law and the 1981 workers' uprising in Pozna\u0144 in 1956. National Movement, a coalition of independent groups, presents a conservative position on social issues. According to the program, decided at the second congress of 2014 the movement traditional ally of the Catholic Church and will strive to uphold traditional Christian values. The movement also refers to the tradition and heritage of ancient Rome.My jeste\u015bmy Rzymianami, jeste\u015bmy synami i c\u00f3rkami Rzymu antycznego, Rzymu w rozumieniu katolickim, jeste\u015bmy dziedzicami Wiecznego Rzymu \u2013 Robert Winnicki podczas II Og\u00f3lnopolskiego Kongresu Ruchu Narodowego, 3 May 2014\" The progress of civilisation, which was to take place in Poland thanks to EU funds, is treated as a partial compensation for the losses that Poland suffered in connection with the unilateral opening of the market in the pre-accession period, while Polish banking sector depends on foreign capital. ===Economy=== The outline of the economic program was presented by Krzysztof Bosak during the second congress of the Movement. According to the RN, it is possible to combine a wide range of economic freedoms with constructive approach to the state, furnished on the basis of the principles of thrift and subsidiarity. The establishment of the Institute for National Strategy, will bring together experts and work out a modern program for the National Movement. The movement is opposed to the introduction of the euro in Poland. ===Foreign policy=== The National Movement is a eurosceptic grouping. In a joint statement with the Hungarian Jobbik on the situation in Ukraine, they have indicated a desire to deepen cooperation between the two groups. They announced the Polish-Hungarian exchange of lists of candidates for election to the European Parliament in 2014 (which ultimately did not happen). Hungarian and Polish nationalists believe that national governments devote national interests in favour of eurofederalism. In this particular case, both national movements called together the national authorities of their countries for political and diplomatic efforts to protect endangered the rights of national minorities in Ukraine due to the revolutionary mood in the east, including promoting the symbolism and characters associated with the Ukrainian ethnic chauvinism that in the context of historical experience violently celebrated national minorities in these lands. The National Movement initially supported strong relationships with Russia, considering it as a superpower and claiming that it was not a threat to Poland on any level, as well as supporting the reconstruction of commercial relations with this country. It also believed that the presence of allied NATO and American troops is \"the reverse of allied support, which strengthens Poland's dependence and dependability in its defense capabilities\". It instead proposed to work with Russia and China as an antidote to the influence of the United States and Germany, calling it a \"multi-vector policy\". However, following critical Russian remarks regarding Polish conduct during the Second World War, the National Movement's stance has become more negative towards Russia.https://nczas.com/2020/01/16/robert-winnicki-z-konfederacji-wie-jak- wykiwac-wladimira-putina-musimy-byc-jak-zydzi-musimy-byc-sprytni-video/ The party has disavowed the pro-Russian stance of its political ally Janusz Korwin-Mikkehttps://www.dorzeczy.pl/kraj/126349/narodowcy-krytycznie-o- wypowiedziach-korwin-mikkego.html and condemned the Russian annexation of Crimea.https://wpolityce.pl/polityka/483195-zapomnialby-o-klamstwach-bosak- spotkalby-sie-z-putinem The party has suggested Russia was coordinating with Israel, which has expressed similar criticisms of Polish conduct during the Second World War.https://wiadomosci.dziennik.pl/polityka/artykuly/6424428,bosak-duda- wybory-prezydenckie.html This party also opposes the admission of immigrants to Poland. ===LGBT rights=== The party opposes same sex rights, pro-LGBT marches and its leaders have described homosexuality as \"a disease\", frequently arranging counter demonstrations. ==Participation in elections== ===Elections to the European Parliament in 2014=== The National Movement announced their desire to take in the elections to the European Parliament on the 7th January 2014 which were to be held in the same year.
