It is the first officially released live solo recording of Christensen.

Christensen explains: \"Originally we were just supposed to do a few shows in London to a few representatives of the music business. But instead of playing at some kind of boring club, we decided we would play at Abbey Road. Only later did we decide to record it and release it to DVD.\" By the time the day of the recording had arrived, Christensen found recording the show outweighed impressing the audience with the possibility of being promoted worldwide, although the latter would be nice. Christensen's record label wanted to use the concert to showcase Honeyburst to several of their executives across Europe, although it is not known whether there were any present.Andersen, Christian Voldborg (25 October 2014). \"Tim Christensen: Jeg holder Dizzy-butikken \u00e5ben nu\" (Tim Christensen: I now consider the Dizzy- boutique opened).

The Abbey Road Studios were chosen was because of Christensen's intense love for The Beatles, and in part was to make up for the disappointment Christensen experienced recording Rotator there in 1995-96, this time making it a proper homage to The Beatles,Molin, Theis (2004). \"Tim Christensen: From Roskilde to Abbey Road\".
