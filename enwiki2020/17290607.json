    "text": "The is the prefectural parliament of Tokyo Metropolis. Its 127 members are elected every four years in 42 districts by single non-transferable vote. 23 electoral districts equal the special wards, another 18 districts are made up by the cities, towns and villages in the Western part of the prefecture, one district consists of the outlying islands (Ogasawara and Izu Islands). The assembly is responsible for enacting and amending prefectural ordinances, approving the budget (5.7 billion yen in fiscal 2007) and voting on important administrative appointments made by the governor including the vice governors. Due to the special nature of the Tokyo Metropolis compared to other prefectures, the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly has certain powers that would usually fall into the responsibilities of municipal parliaments. This is to ensure efficient and unified urban administration for the 23 special wards that cover the former Tokyo City and comprise the urban core of the Greater Tokyo Area. == Current composition == Assembly hall The 2017 Tokyo prefectural election took place on July 2, 2017.

When she was making questions about how to save women who have a difficulty about pregnancy and childbirth, heckles and laugh occurred from the seats. The Japanese media, along with various members of society both condemned and also excused the heckling, especially because of Shiomura's background. Many people against the heckling asked for people who make heckling to be identified. Media overseas, CNN, BBC, and so on, also criticized the heckling, and reported on the endemic sexism that made such a thing possible, while the Japanese media tended to present it as a one-time case of sexual harassment. On June 23, assembly member Akihiro Suzuki came forward, saying he was one of the people who heckled her and he made a formal, public apology. The fact that a member of the LDP ruling party apologized publicly (bowing deeply) was seen as very big deal. Other hecklers never came forward. On June 25, the assembly passed a resolution of aiming to restore the trust, and finish this problem.Togikaiyajimondai, domiru? (How should we view the heckling problem in the assembly?).

When she was a bikini model, she appeared on Koi no karasawagi, a TV program (Nippon TV). Akihiro Suzuki (51) is first elected in Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election in 2007. In the Metropolitan Assembly, it has acted as the Committee on General Affairs vice chairman or the acting Liberal Democratic Party chairman of the Policy Research Council. Suzuki had hung up \"a substantial aid for childcare\" and \"realization of the society in which women is very easy to work\" contrary to the contents of heckling which he did to her. Moreover, Suzuki approved of the plan to purchase the Senkaku Islands (Ishigaki city, Okinawa) in August, 2012. For the purpose of investigation of the Senkaku Islands, he swam from the ship, while he had been allowed to, and he landed at Uoturijima island, and he was investigated by the Okinawa Prefectural Police on suspicion of a misdemeanor.Takeuti, Y.

Mainiti Shinbun Newspaper. Retrieved: [July 20, 2014] === Heckling === The hecklings with which assemblywoman Shiomura were bombarded are as follows; \"Umenai no ka (Can't you bear a baby?)\", \"Kekkon shiro (Get married)\". The former assemblyman Suzuki claimed, but it was not clear who stated the latter. Y\u014dichi Masuzoe, the Governor of Tokyo Metropolis, and other member of the assembly were drawn in by the heckling and scornfully laughed. The public typically pays attention to who made the heckling. Hecklings are variable; sometime a heckling encourage the speaker and another time it injures speaker, just like in this instance. There has been the train of thought that heckling can \"give humor\" and make discussion smooth since past World War II. Thus, some people think of heckling as good. According to Morita Minoru, Japanese political commentator, points out that though heckling has been since past, political leaders get bad at heckling other members, and the number of \"vulgar heckles\" has increased (2014). There are various arguments on whether or not this is sexism. For example, Tabojin Toshio, who run for the latest Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election, said that he did not understand why this is considered sexism (2014).Kumano, S. (2014, July 15).

The requisition stated the person who heckled Shiomura should be punished, but the requisition was rejected because the man who heckled her was known. Therefore, Your Party (minna no to) planned to specify the man who heckled her by analyzing a voiceprint. When Suzuki was asked about the relationship with heckling on June 20, Suzuki said \"Bolt from the blue\" denied the relationship with heckling completely. The Metropolitan-Assembly Liberal Democratic Party held the affiliation lawmaker's general meeting on the 23rd and at the afternoon press conference, Metropolitan-Assembly Liberal Democratic Party Secretary-General Osamu Yoshiwara said that the man who heckled Shiomura was Suzuki Akihiro, a member of the Metropolitan Assembly.Togikaiyagi ha zimintono suzukiakihiro giinn to hannmei (The man who heckled her are Akihiro Suzuki , a member of Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly.).

Also, Your Party claimed that someone who made fun of Ms. Shiomura should be identified. More than 1000 protestations against the hooting were sent to the metropolitan assembly. On Twitter, BBS and so on, so many people mentioned the incident. Most of them radically criticized the sexist abuse. Not only in Japan but also in other countries, this problem has been focused on. For example, the Guardian, Reuters, and the Wall Street Journal analyzed and criticized this sexist abuse.Togikai sekuhara yaji mondai, kogi no netto shomei 40000ninni (The problem of the sexual harassment in the metropolitan assembly in Japan, 40000 signatures.).

This incident has influenced the Cabinet support rate. the support rate of Liberal Democratic Party, which is one of the major political party in Japan and has been in power since 2012, decreased. In contrast, the support rate for Your Party rose.Shijiritsu teika \"Anpo to sekuhara yaji ekyo\" Kan kanbo chokan (The support rate has decreased \"the right of collective self-defense and the problem of sexual harassment has influenced\" Kan Chief Cabinet Secretary said.).

After the problem happened, politicians has refrained from hooting during discussion, for example, about the budget in the House of Representatives. Some people analyzed that the incident was likely to influence 2020 Summer Olympics. ==See also== *Tokyo Metropolitan Government ==References== ==External links== * Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly * Electoral Commission of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government * Organizational Structure of TMG * Category:Prefectural assemblies of Japan ",
