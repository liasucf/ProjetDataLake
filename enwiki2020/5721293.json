The season ended with Wolverhampton Wanderers as First Division champions after scoring 103 goals and Bolton Wanderers as FA Cup winners.

Preston North End finished runners-up, while Tottenham Hotspur finished third thanks largely to the influence of captain and Footballer of the Year, Danny Blanchflower. West Bromwich Albion finished fourth and the top five was completed by Manchester City, who became the first and so far only club to both score and concede 100 goals in a league season. After the Munich air disaster, Manchester United won only one more league game and dipped to ninth place, although they did reach the FA Cup final, where they were beaten by Bolton Wanderers. Sheffield Wednesday propped up the First Division and were the first side to go down, being joined soon after by a Sunderland side who had enjoyed the longest run in the First Division totaling nearly 70 years. ===Second Division=== West Ham United topped the Second Division to secure First Division football for the first time in the postwar era, while Blackburn Rovers finished one point behind them in second place. Charlton Athletic missed out on an immediate return to the First Division by a single point, while Liverpool missed out on promotion by two points. ===Third Division North=== Scunthorpe & Lindsey United sealed the Third Division North title by a comfortable margin and secured their place in the Second Division, while runners-up Accrington Stanley had the consolation of at least being able to play in the third of the league's fourth tiers following the decision to reorganize into four national divisions for the 1958\u201359 season. ===Third Division South=== Brighton & Hove Albion won promotion to the Second Division as champions of the Third Division South. ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Bobby Smith (Tottenham Hotspur) \u2013 36 goals Second Division *Tommy Johnston (Leyton Orient / Blackburn Rovers) \u2013 43 goals Third Division North *Alf Ackerman (Carlisle United) \u2013 35 goals Third Division South *Derek Reeves (Southampton) and Sammy McCrory (Southend United) \u2013 31 goals ==References== ",
