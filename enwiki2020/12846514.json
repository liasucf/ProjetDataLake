Manomet scientists work with private industry, nonprofit and governmental partners across North and South America to create a more sustainable world. Manomet works in the areas of conservation, business sustainability and science education. Manomet has also been dedicated to learning more about birds and their habitats for 50 years. ==History== Manomet was founded as a bird observatory named Manomet Bird Observatory in the summer of 1969 and was called Manomet Center for Conservation Sciences until 2015. Manomet is named for the coastal village in New England where its headquarters have been for more than 45 years. A Native American word, the name Manomet means portage path. Manomet focuses its programs where they will have measurable impact and opportunity for scale: *Climate Services \u2014 Integrating science and stakeholder networks to identify and implement nature\u2013based solutions to climate change. *Landbird Conservation \u2014 Using long-term research and education to connect people to nature. *Shorebird Recovery \u2014 Engaging a diverse coalition of people and organizations across the Americas to develop and implement science-based solutions to conserve imperiled shorebirds. *Sustainable Economies \u2014 Advising partners on practices to enhance economic viability and human well-being while measurably reducing their environmental footprint ==Recent studies== In June 2010, Manomet published the Biomass Sustainability and Carbon Policy Study. The study, which was commissioned by the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, investigated questions about generating electricity from biomass fuel, including the net effect of biomass energy on atmospheric carbon balance. The study concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from burning wood are initially higher than from fossil fuels, but the carbon sequestered by regrowing forests can yield lower greenhouse gas levels over time. Manomet is also known for its long-term shorebird research in the Arctic. In September 2010, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service selected Manomet to lead a $3 million, seven-month study to assess the impact on shorebirds from the massive Deepwater Horizon oil spill. ==References== ==External links == * * Manomet's Grocery Stewardship Certification program * Manomet's Root360 program * Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network Category:Ornithological organizations Category:Biological research institutes Category:Plymouth, Massachusetts Category:Research institutes in the United States Category:Non- profit organizations based in Massachusetts Category:Environmental organizations based in Massachusetts ",
