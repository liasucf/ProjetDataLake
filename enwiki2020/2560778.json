    "text": "Cyclopentene is a chemical compound with the formula (CH2)3(CH)2. It is a colorless liquid with a petrol-like odor. It is one of the cycloalkenes. Cyclopentene is produced industrially in large amounts by steam cracking of naphtha. It has few applications, and thus is mainly used as a component of gasoline. ==Use in mechanistic organic chemistry== Cyclopentene is used in analysing the mechanisms of organic reactions. It can be obtained from vinylcyclopropane in the vinylcyclopropane-cyclopentene rearrangement. The polymerization of cyclopentene by Ziegler-Natta catalysts yields 1,3-linkages, not the more typical 1,2-linked polymer. ==References== Category:Monomers ",
