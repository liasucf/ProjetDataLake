The pogrom were orchestrated by the governing Democratic Party in Turkey in cooperation with various security organizations (Tactical Mobilisation Group, Counter-Guerrilla and National Security Service).\"6-7 Eyl\u00fcl ya\u011fma olaylar\u0131 bir M\u0130T organizasyonu (6-7 September looting events is a M\u0130T orchestration)\", Sabah newspaper, accessed: 2 January 2014The events were triggered by the false news that the day before, Greeks had bombed the Turkish consulate in Thessaloniki, in northern Greece\u2014the house where Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk had been born in 1881. A bomb planted by a Turkish usher at the consulate, who was later arrested and confessed, incited the events. The Turkish press, conveying the news in Turkey, was silent about the arrest and instead insinuated that Greeks had set off the bomb. A Turkish mob, most of whom had been trucked into the city in advance, assaulted Istanbul's Greek community for nine hours. Although the mob did not explicitly call for Greeks to be killed, over a dozen people died during or after the attacks as a result of beatings and arson. Armenians and Jews were also harmed. The police remained mostly ineffective, and the violence continued until the government declared martial law in \u0130stanbul and called in the army to put down the riots. The pogrom greatly accelerated emigration of ethnic Greeks from Turkey, and the Istanbul region in particular. The Greek population of Turkey declined from 119,822 in 1927,http://www.demography- lab.prd.uth.gr/DDAoG/article/cont/ergasies/tsilenis.htm to about 7,000 in 1978. In Istanbul alone, the Greek population decreased from 116,108 to 49,081 between 1955 and 1960. The 2008 figures released by the Turkish Foreign Ministry placed the number of Turkish citizens of Greek descent at 3,000\u20134,000; while according to the Human Rights Watch (2006) their number was estimated to be 2,500.\"From \u201cDenying Human Rights and Ethnic Identity\u201d series of Human Rights Watch\" Human Rights Watch, 2 July 2006. Some see the attacks as a continuation of a process of Turkification that started with the decline of the Ottoman Empire,Ergil, Do\u011fu. \"Past as present\", Turkish Daily News 12 September 2005.as roughly 40% of the properties attacked belonged to other minorities. The pogrom has been compared in some media to the Kristallnacht, the 1938 pogrom against Jews throughout Nazi Germany. Historian Alfred-Maurice de Zayas has written that in his view, despite the small number of deaths in the pogrom, the riots met the \"intent to destroy in whole or in part\" criterion of the Genocide Convention. In 2009, Turkish Prime Minister Erdogan said that Turkey have committed mistakes. He said: \"The minorities have been expelled from our country in the past. It was a result of fascist policy. Erdogan attacks the past, labels Kemalist ethnic cleansing Fascist, AsiaNews ==Background== ===Greeks of Istanbul=== Constantinople (modern Istanbul) was the capital of the Byzantine Empire until 1453, when the city was conquered by Ottoman forces. A large indigenous Greek community continued to live in the multi-ethnic Ottoman capital city. The city's Greek population, particularly the Phanariotes, came to play a significant role in the social and economic life of the city and in the political and diplomatic life of the Islamic but multi-ethnic, multi-religious Ottoman Empire in general. This continued even after rebellions against Ottoman rule in Greece and the establishment of an independent Greek state in 1829, although during the Greek War of Independence massacres against local Greek communities occurred. A number of ethnic Armenians and Greeks, who served in the Ottoman Imperial diplomatic service and were even leading politicians in the 19th and early 20th century, were targeted. Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, the Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922), and the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the population exchange agreement signed between Greece and Turkey resulted in the uprooting of all Greeks in modern Turkey (and Turks in Greece) from where many of them had lived for centuries. But due to the Greeks' strong emotional attachment to their first capital as well as the importance of the Ecumenical Patriarchate for Greek and worldwide Orthodoxy, the Greek population of Istanbul was specifically exempted and allowed to stay in place. Nevertheless, this population began to decline, as evinced by demographic statistics. Punitive Turkish nationalist exclusivist measures, such as a 1932 parliamentary law, barred Greek citizens living in Turkey from a series of 30 trades and professions from tailoring and carpentry to medicine, law and real estate. The Varl\u0131k Vergisi tax imposed in 1942 also served to reduce the economic potential of Greek businesspeople in Turkey. ===Context=== In early 1950s, Turkey had close relations with Greece. In 1952, Paul of Greece became the first Greek Monarch to visit a Turkish head of state, which was soon followed by Turkish president Celal Bayar's visit to Greece. However, the relations soured starting in 1953, when the armed struggle of the Greek Cypriots, the majority of the island's population, aiming for political union of Cyprus with Greece, started. Soon after, Georgios Grivas formed the armed organization EOKA. This turn of events was politically exploited in Turkey by the Turkish nationalists of Kibris T\u00fcrkt\u00fcr Cemiyeti (Cyprus is Turkish) organization, although EOKA had never targeted the Turkish Cypriot community before the anti-Greek pogrom events of September 1955. Greece appealed in 1954 to the United Nations to demand self-determination for Cyprus. Britain had the ruling mandate over the mostly ethnic Greek island, and wanted the Cyprus dispute to be resolved without being taken to the United Nations Security Council, where it could be problematically framed as an anti-colonialist struggle. To this end, Britain diplomatically encouraged Turkey to agitate Greece. The British ambassador to Greece also incited, saying in an August 1954 speech that Greco- Turkish ties were superficial, so nothing would be lost if, for example, something were to happen to Atat\u00fcrk's house in Thessaloniki. More bluntly, an official of the Foreign Office said that some agitation would be much to Turkey's benefit. In any case, said parliamentarian John Strachey, Turkey had a large ethnic Greek minority in Istanbul as a card to play against Greece if it considered annexing an independent Cyprus to Greece. The concerns about the events in Cyprus led to the formation of a number of nationalist student and irredentist organizations in \u0130stanbul, such as the National Federation of Turkish Students (), the National Union of Turkish Students, and Hikmet Bil's (editor of the major newspaper H\u00fcrriyet) \"Cyprus is Turkish\" Association (), who had protested against the Greek minority and the Ecumenical Patriarchate. In 1955, a propaganda campaign involving the Turkish press galvanized public opinion against the Greek minority, targeting Athenogoras, the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, in particular, accusing him of collecting donations for Enosis. Leading the pack was H\u00fcrriyet, which wrote on 28 August 1955: \"If the Greeks dare touch our brethren, then there are plenty of Greeks in Istanbul to retaliate upon.\" \u00d6mer Sami Co\u015far from Cumhuriyet wrote on 30 August: Terc\u00fcman, Yeni Sabah, and Gece Postas\u0131 followed suit. The \"Cyprus is Turkish\" Association (CTA) stepped up activities in the weeks leading up to the riots, increasing the number of branches from three in August to ten by the time the attacks took place. On September 4, Hikmet Bil ordered students at Taksim Square, the heart of the city, to burn Greek newspapers. The same day, Kamil \u00d6nal of the CTA\u2014and the National Security Service\u2014handed out to students twenty thousands banners emblazoned \"Cyprus is Turkish\". The intercommunal violence in Cyprus prompted Turkey to transmit a diplomatic note to United Kingdom. United Kingdom then invited Turkey and Greece to a conference in London, which started on August 26. The day before the Tripartite London Conference (29 August\u20137 September 1955) began, Prime Minister Menderes claimed that Greek Cypriots were planning a massacre of Turkish Cypriots. Seeing the opportunity to extricate Britain, Prime Minister Harold Macmillan advised the Turkish delegates that they should be stern. Foreign minister Fatin R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Zorlu paid heed to Macmillan and launched a harsh opening salvo, stating that Turkey would reconsider its commitment to the Treaty of Lausanne unless Greece reconsidered its position on Cyprus. The Greek delegates, surprised by harshness of the speech, blamed the British. Deflecting domestic attention to Cyprus was politically convenient for the Menderes government, which was suffering from an ailing economy. Although a minority, the Greek population played a prominent role in the city's business life, making it a convenient scapegoat during the economic crisis in the mid-50s which saw Turkey's economy contract (with an 11% GDP/capita decrease in 1954). The DP responded first with inflationary policies, then when that failed, with authoritarianism and populism. DP's policies also introduced rural-urban mobility, which exposed some of the rural population to the lifestyles of the urban minorities. The three chief destinations were the largest three cities: Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir. Between 1945 and 1955, the population of Istanbul increased from 1 million to about 1.6 million. Many of these new residents found themselves in shantytowns (), and constituted a prime target for populist policies. Finally, the conference fell apart on 6 September, the first day the subject of Cyprus would be broached at the conference, when news broke of the bombing of the Turkish consulate (and birthplace of Atat\u00fcrk) in Greece's second-largest city, Thessaloniki. ==Pogrom events== Main targets of the Istanbul riots. ===Planning=== The 1961 Yass\u0131ada Trial after 1960 coup d'\u00e9tat accused Menderes and Foreign Minister Fatin R\u00fc\u015ft\u00fc Zorlu of planning the riots. Though both of them rejected the claims, it is believed by scholars that Menderes assented to the organization of protests in \u0130stanbul against the Greeks, but the extent of knowledge of Zorlu, who had been in London for the conference, is unclear. Interior Minister Nam\u0131k Gedik was also accused of involvement, though he was not tried as he committed suicide before the trials started. According to Zorlu's lawyer at the Yassiada trial, a mob of 300,000 was marshaled in a radius of around the city for the attacks. The role of the National Security Service was not clarified at the trials, since the sole aim of the junta was to sentence the DP government.\"400 kad\u0131na tecav\u00fcz edildi (400 women were raped)\", Sabah newspaper, accessed: 2 January 2014 The trial revealed that the fuse for the consulate bomb was sent from Turkey to Thessaloniki on 3 September. During the Yass\u0131ada Trial it was claimed that a twenty-year-old university student named Oktay Engin was given the mission of installing the explosives, two sticks of gelignite, in the consulate's garden. The consul M. Ali Balin allegedly first pressured consulate employee Hasan U\u00e7ar, but Engin was brought in when U\u00e7ar resisted. Both of them were arrested after the attack. Engin was born in the Greek town of Komotini () to Faik Engin, a well-known parliamentarian in the late '40s and one of the three ethnic Turkish members of the Greek parliament between 1946-1950. Oktay Engin became one of the few ethnic Turkish students to graduate from Greek gymnasiums in those years. Turkish officials encouraged him to study law, offering him a scholarship, so that he could promote the interests of Turkish citizens in Greece. He thus entered Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 1953. When he was in his second year, he was accused of incitement in the bombing incident. Engin said that he had been followed by Greek intelligence agents so closely from the start of his university education, that he could name one (\"Triondafilos\"). In his 2005 book, Speros Vryonis documents the direct role of the Demokrat Parti organization and government-controlled trade unions in amassing the rioters that swept Istanbul. Ten of Istanbul's 18 branches of the \"Cyprus is Turkish\" Association were run by DP officials. This organization played a crucial role in inciting anti-Greek activities. Most of the rioters came from western Asia Minor. His case study of Eski\u015fehir shows how the party there recruited 400 to 500 workers from local factories, who were carted by train with third class-tickets to Istanbul. These recruits were promised the equivalent of 6 USD, which was never paid. They were accompanied by Eski\u015fehir police, who were charged with coordinating the destruction and looting once the contingent was broken up into groups of 20\u201330 men, and the leaders of the party branches.Dilek G\u00fcven, Cumhuriyet D\u00f6nemi Az\u0131nl\u0131k Politikalar\u0131 Ba\u011flam\u0131nda 6-7 Eyl\u00fcl Olaylar\u0131, quoted in While the DP took the blame for the events, it was revealed in 2005 that the riots were in actuality a product of the Turkey's Tactical Mobilization Group; a clandestine special forces unit. Four star general Sabri Yirmibe\u015fo\u011flu, the right-hand man of General Kemal Yamak who led the Turkish outpost of Operation Gladio under the Tactical Mobilization Group (), proudly reminisced about his involvement in the riots, calling them \"a magnificent organization\". Before the events in September 6th, some buildings owned by Greeks and other non-Muslim minorities were marked with cross signs in order to make the arson easier,.\"55 Y\u0131l Sonra 6-7 Eyl\u00fcl Olaylar\u0131\" http://bianet.org/bianet/biamag/124591-55-yil-sonra-6-7-eylul-olaylari\"Utan\u00e7 G\u00fcn\u00fc\" ===Execution=== Municipal and government trucks were placed in strategic points all around the city to distribute the tools of destruction (shovels, pickaxes, crowbars, ramrods and petrol), while 4,000 taxis were requisitioned from the Drivers Association and Motor Vehicle Workers' Trade Union () to transport the perpetrators. In addition, flags had been prepared by the Textile Workers' Union (). A protest rally on the night of 6 September, organised by the authorities in Istanbul, on the Cyprus issue and the bombing of Atat\u00fcrk's home was the cover for amassing the rioters. At 13:00, news reports of the bombing were announced by radio. However, most people at the time did not have radios, so they had to wait until 16:30, when the daily \u0130stanbul Ekspres, which was associated with the DP and the National Security Service (NSS), repeated the news in print. According to a September 2005 episode of the weekly show Files on the Greek Mega Channel, the accompanying photographs were seen by Salonican photographer Yannis Kyriakidis on September 4 (two days before the actual bombing). The consul's wife had brought the film to the photo studio that belonged to Kyriakidis' father to be printed. The photographs were then photomontaged, according to the program. On the day of the event, the editor, G\u00f6k\u015fin Sipahio\u011flu, called the owner, Mithat Perin, asking for permission for a second run. The weather was bad, so Perin declined thinking the prints would not get sold. The newspaper's main dealer, Fuat B\u00fcke, soon called and offered to pay for the run in advance. By the time Perin went to inspect the Tan Press, 180,000 copies had already been printed. Sensing something fishy, Perin tore up the paper and stopped the run. The prototype was still intact however, and the workers secretly resumed printing after Perin left. They had eventually printed 300,000 copies (on paper stocked in advance), of which 296,000 were sold. This was far above the newspaper's average circulation of 30,000\u201340,000 (by comparison, the best-selling H\u00fcrriyet sold 70\u201380 thousand copies). Perin was arrested the next day. G\u00f6k\u015fin Sipahio\u011flu later alleged the NSS had pressured him to do it, while Perin says Sipahio\u011flu himself was an agent. Perin's innocence, however, was cast into doubt after intrepid journalist U\u011fur Mumcu published an excerpt from a 1962 letter between Perin and the undersecretary of the NSS, Fuat Do\u011fu, stating that in his 25 years of journalism, he had acted in full knowledge of the NSS and had not refrained from doing anything. At 17:00, the riots started in Taksim Square, and rippled out during the evening through the old suburb of Beyo\u011flu (Pera), with smashing and looting of Greek commercial property, particularly along Y\u00fcksek Kald\u0131r\u0131m street. By six o'clock at night, many of the Greek shops on Istanbul's main shopping street, \u0130stiklal Avenue, were ransacked. Many commercial streets were littered with merchandise and fittings torn out of Greek-owned businesses. According to the eyewitness account of a Greek dentist, the mob chanted \"Death to the Giaours\" (non-Turks), \"Massacre the Greek traitors\", \"Down with Europe\" and \"Onward to Athens and Thessaloniki\" as they attacked.\"Rumlara \u00d6l\u00fcm Slogan\u0131\"http://bianet.org/biamag/biamag/101612-annem-sag-cikamayacagiz-diyordu Predictably, the situation came soon out of control and the mobs were shouting \"First your property. Then your life\". The riot died down by midnight with the intervention of the Turkish Army and declaration of martial law. The police, which supported the attacks by preparing and organizing the operations, was ordered to hold a passive stance and leave the mob to roam the streets of the city freely and commit atrocities against the civilian population. The Turkish militia and police that coordinated the attacks refrained from protecting the lives and properties of the victims. Their function was instead to preserve adjacent Turkish properties. However, there were a few cases where police officers prevented criminal activity. On the other hand, the fire brigade, whenever it reached a fire, claimed that it was unable to deal with it. ===Related violence=== According to most sources, between 13 and 16 Greeks and one Armenian (including two clerics) died as a result of the pogrom. However, a number of deaths were never recorded due to the general chaos, so estimates vary. An early source gives the number of dead as 0,\"A crisis struck at the end of 1955 as political and economic restlessness culminated in the riots of September 6 in Istanbul and Izmir (ostensibly induced by the issue of Cyprus) and a subsequent political shake-up. Contributing reasons for the violence: (1) use of the Greek Orthodox Church as a political instrument by the Greek government, thus sparking latent Moslem-Christian hostilities (which were laid on top of latent Greek-Turkish national hostility); (2) the presence in Istanbul of a large, floating, unemployed, male population of village origin which sought economic gain from looting; (3) popular identification of certain Istanbul merchants of Greek ethnic extraction with hoarding, speculation, and unsavory wealth; (4) deliberate stimulation and organization of the crowds to violent ends by an unknown group. (Communists? Doubtful, none were arrested. Opposition politicians? Equally doubtful; even the government made no such charge. Prime Minister Menderes? Doubtful; the riot ran contrary to every conceivable interest of his, A group of second echelon Democrats seeking to unseat Menderes? Somewhat more likely; an effort within the party was made in December. Religious and racial fanatics? Equally likely. Possibly a combination of the last two constituted the guilty parties. In such event, criminal convictions may have been avoided because those guilty were too closely identified with the Prime Minister. An outstanding feature of the Istanbul riot: no one was killed.) In July 1961, both Menderes and Bayar were found guilty by a revolutionary tribunal of inciting the 1955 riot, but the evidence was not impressive. What was proved was that the government had planned a popular demonstration to support its position in Cyprus. A critic of the Menderes regime commented to the author in 1962 \"It is now almost generally agreed that these riots were planned, organized, and started by Democratic leaders and local bosses, but developed into far beyond the original plan and intention.\" It seems to me most likely that the demonstration was deliberately incited to unintended violence by other parties, the identity of whom still remains undisclosed. Local authorities, knowing of the government-sponsored demonstration, apparently did not know how to respond to the violence during the first few destructive hours. But was no evidence to prove that Menderes deliberately planned the type of mass violence that in fact erupted.\", Richard D. Robinson, The First Turkish Republic: a case study in national development, Harvard University Press, 1965, p. 157. but later sources and witness accounts do not affirm this. According to a number of other sources the total death toll is estimated to be at least 30. Apart from the thirty identified victims, an additional of three unidentified bodies were found inside the shops, while three burned bodies were found in a sack in the region of Besiktas. Moreover, 32 Greeks were severely wounded. Men and women were raped and islamized by force, and according to accounts including those of the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin, men, including a priest, were subjected to forced circumcision by members of the mob. Moreover, an Armenian rite Christian priest died after the procedure. Priests were also scalped and burnt in their beds and Greek women raped. Nesin wrote: ===Material damage and cost=== The material damage was considerable, with damage to 5317 properties, almost all Greek-owned. Among these were 4214 homes, 1004 businesses, 73 churches, 26 schools, two monasteries, and a synagogue. Over 4,000 Greek-owned businesses, over 1,000 Greek-owned homes, 110 hotels, 73 Greek (and other Christian) churches, 27 pharmacies, 23 schools, and 21 factories were badly damaged or destroyed. The American consulate estimates that 59% of the businesses were Greek-owned, 17% were Armenian-owned, 12% were Jewish-owned, and 10% were Muslim-owned; while 80% of the homes were Greek-owned, 9% were Armenian-owned, 3% were Jewish-owned, and 5% were Muslim-owned. Estimates of the economic cost of the damage vary from Turkish government's estimate of 69.5 million Turkish lira (equivalent to 24.8 million US$Turkish currency exchange rates 1923\u20131990 ), a British estimate of 100 million GBP (about 200 million US$), the World Council of Churches' estimate of 150 million USD, and the Greek government's estimate of 500 million USD. The Turkish government paid 60 million Turkish lira of restitution to those who registered their losses. ====Church property==== Representatives of the World Council of Churches investigating the vandalized sarcophaguses of the deceased Ecumenical Patriarchs, in the Patriarchal cemetery in Bal\u0131kl\u0131. In addition to commercial targets, the mob clearly targeted property owned or administered by the Greek Orthodox Church. 73 churches and 23 schools were vandalized, burned or destroyed, as were eight baptisteries and three monasteries, about 90 percent of the church property portfolio in the city. The ancient Byzantine church of Panagia in Belgradkap\u0131 was vandalised and burned down. The church at Yedikule was badly vandalised, as was the church of St. Constantine of Psammathos. At Zoodochos Pege church in Bal\u0131kl\u0131, the tombs of a number of ecumenical patriarchs were smashed open and desecrated. The abbot of the monastery, Bishop Gerasimos of Pamphilos, was severely beaten during the pogrom and died from his wounds some days later in Bal\u0131kl\u0131 Hospital. In one church arson attack, Father Chrysanthos Mandas was burned alive. The Metropolitan of Liloupolis, Gennadios, was badly beaten and went mad. Elsewhere in the city, the Greek cemetery of \u015ei\u015fli, as well as the cemetery of the Patriarchates in Bal\u0131kl\u0131 were targeted. Crosses and statues were vandalized, while sepulchers and burial vaults were opened and the remains of the dead were removed and dispersed by the fanatic mobs. At Bal\u0131kl\u0131 cemetery, the sarcophaguses of the Greek Orthodox Patriarchs were desecrated. ===Witnesses=== An eyewitness account was provided by journalist Noel Barber of the London Daily Mail on 14 September 1955: On the occasion of the pogrom's 50th anniversary, a seventy-year-old Mehmet Ali Zeren said, \"I was in the street that day and I remember very clearly...In a jewelry store, one guy had a hammer and he was breaking pearls one by one.\" One famous eyewitness was James Bond novelist Ian Fleming, who as an MI6 agent was present under the cover of the International Police Conference on 5 September (which he ditched in favour of covering the riots for The Sunday Times). Fleming's account was published on 11 September, bearing the title \"The Great Riot of Istanbul\". It has been said that Fleming may have been tipped off by N\u00e2zim Kalkavan, the Istanbul station chief of the MI6, who appears in 1957's From Russia, with Love as \"Darko Kerim\". According to Fleming's biographer, John Pearson, Kalkavan was rather like Kerim bey. A number of Turkish eyewitness accounts were published in 2008 by Ay\u015fe H\u00fcr in an article that appeared in Taraf. ===Resistance=== There are accounts of protection offered to the minorities by their fellow citizens that were successful in fending off the mob. The most organized team rallied behind air force captain Re\u015fat Mater. Mater happened to be off duty and visiting his home in Cevizli's Muhasebeciler Street, which was right next to the rally point, \u0130stanbul Caddesi. Mater first hid some of his neighbors in his house, then he took to the street with his gun and his uniform. The boys in the neighborhood joined him, bringing domestic implements as substitute weapons. The mob passed by after seeing the barricade. Mater later rose all the way to Commander of the Air Force, making him third in the military line of command. His son Tayfun, who witnessed the pogrom, maintains ties with those who survived and fled to Greece. ===Secondary action=== While the pogrom was predominantly an Istanbul affair, there were some outrages in other Turkish cities. On the morning of 7 September 1955 In \u0130zmir, a mob overran the \u0130zmir National Park, where an international exhibition was taking place, and burned the Greek pavilion. Moving next to the Church of Saint Fotini, built two years earlier to serve the needs of the NATO Regional Headquarters' Greek officers, the mob destroyed it completely. The homes of the few Greek families and officers were then looted. ===Documentation=== Considerable contemporary documentation showing the extent of the destruction is provided by the photographs taken by Demetrios Kaloumenos, then official photographer of the Ecumenical Patriarchate. Setting off just hours after the pogrom began, Kaloumenos set out with his camera to capture the damage and smuggled the film to Greece. Famous Turkish photojournalist of Armenian descent, Ara G\u00fcler, also took many photographs during the pogrom.Ara Guler Istanbul Pogromhttp://www.tercumaniahval.com/foto-muhabiri-ara-guler/ ==Reactions== ===In Greece=== In Greece, Oktay Engin and consulate employee Hasan U\u00e7ar were arrested on 18 September. Engin was first charged with executing the attack, but he presented an alibi so the charge was dropped to incitement. He was detained for nine months. Three months later, he escaped to Turkey before the Greek courts sentenced him to 3.5 years. In addition, Turkey refused Greece's extradition request. ===In Turkey=== After the events, 3,151 people were immediately arrested, the number of arrested later rose to 5,104. On 7 September, the Menderes government closed the \"Cyprus is Turkish\" Association (CTA) and arrested its executives. 34 trade unions were dissolved. The Minister of Internal Affairs Nam\u0131k Gedik resigned on 10 September. The investigation initially focused on the \"Cyprus is Turkish\" Association (CTA). CTA detainee, and spy, named Kamil \u00d6nal had one of his CTA associates burn an intelligence report originating from the National Security Service (NSS) that was at the CTA office. In addition, a member from the K\u0131z\u0131ltoprak branch, Serafim Sa\u011flamel, was found to be carrying an address list of non-Muslim citizens. However, on September 12, the government blamed Turkish Communists for the pogrom, arresting 45 \"card-carrying communists\" (including Aziz Nesin, Kemal Tahir, and \u0130lhan Berktay). This type of \"false flag\" anti-Communist propaganda was a staple of the Counter-Guerrilla. When opposition leader \u0130smet \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc delivered a speech criticizing the government for rounding up innocent people instead of the actual perpetrators, the communists were released in December 1955. An angry Menderes said that \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc would not be forgiven for his speech, pardoning the communists. 87 CTA leaders were released in December 1955, while 17 were taken to court on 12 February 1956. The indictment initially blamed the CTA only for inciting some students to burn Greek newspapers in Taksim Square. In response to police chief Kemal Ayg\u00fcn's question about the Cominform's role in the affair, \u015eevki Mutlugil of the NSS cooked up a report, which concluded that the Comintern and Cominform had conspired to sabotage NATO. As proof, the prosecution submitted some brochures from the Communist Party of Turkey and a pair of letters from N\u00e2z\u0131m Hikmet which called on the workers of Cyprus to stand against imperialism. To bolster the claims, the indictment claimed that NSS agent Kamil \u00d6nal had contacted the Comintern while on duty in Lebanon and defected, effectively exonerating the NSS. The remaining prisoners were released on 12 January 1957 for lack of evidence, by order of the Istanbul First Penal Court (). ===International=== The charg\u00e9 d'affaires at the British Embassy in Ankara, Michael Stewart, directly implicated Menderes' Demokrat Parti in the execution of the attack. \"There is fairly reliable evidence that local Demokrat Parti representatives were among the leaders of the rioting in various parts of Istanbul, notably in the Marmara islands, and it has been argued that only the Demokrat Parti had the political organisation in the country capable of demonstrations on the scale that occurred,\" he reported, refusing to assign blame to the party as a whole or Menderes personally, however. The Foreign Office pointedly underscored the fact that British citizens were also victims of the attack. Although British ambassador to Ankara, Bowker, advised British Foreign Secretary Harold Macmillan that the United Kingdom should \"court a sharp rebuff by admonishing Turkey\", only a note of distinctly mild disapproval was dispatched to Menderes.Holland, Robert. \"[https://books.google.com/books?id=HI4nxW6ffCEC&pg;=PA76 The Struggle for Mastery, 4 October 1955\u20139 March 1956],\" Britain and the Revolt in Cyprus, 1954\u201359, Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998, pp. 75\u201377. The context of the Cold War led Britain and the U.S. to absolve the Menderes government of direct political blame. The efforts of Greece to internationalize the human rights violations through international organizations such as the UN and NATO found little sympathy. British NATO representative Cheetham deemed it \"undesirable\" to probe the pogrom. U.S. representative Edwin M. Martin thought the effect on the alliance was exaggerated, and the French, Belgians and Norwegians urged the Greeks to \"let bygones be bygones\". By popular vote, the Cyprus issue was dropped from the U.N. agenda on 23 September 1955. Britain had successfully avoided a potential diplomatic embarrassment. ==Aftermath== ===Compensation payments=== The compensation package allocated by the Turkish Assembly was only 60 million Turkish liras. While 12.7 million Turkish liras were given to churches for compensation out of 39 million Turkish liras claimed for damages, the rest of the 60 million Turkish liras was distributed among applicants. ===Anti-Greek policy and Greek exodus=== Greek population in Istanbul and percentages of the city population (1844-1997). The Turkish policies, after 1923, led virtually to the elimination of the Greek community. Tensions continued, and in 1958\u20131959, Turkish nationalist students embarked on a campaign encouraging a boycott against all Greek businesses. The task was completed eight years later in 1964 when the Ankara government reneged on the 1930 Greco-Turkish Ankara Convention, which established the right of Greek \u00e9tablis (Greeks who were born and lived in Istanbul but held Greek citizenship) to live and work in Turkey. As a result of tensions over the Cyprus issue, Turkey prohibited all commercial dealings by Greeks holding a Greek passport resulting in the deportation from Turkey of around 40,000 ethnic Greeks.Bahar Rumelili Ph.D., \"The European Union and Cultural Change in Greek-Turkish Relations\" p16 They were allowed to take with them only 20 kg of their belongings and cash of 22 dollars. Moreover, the property they left was confiscated by the Turkish state ten years later. As a result of these policies, the Greek community of Istanbul shrank from 80,000 (or 100,000 by some accounts) persons in 1955 to only 48,000 in 1965. Today, the Greek community numbers about 2,500, mostly older individuals. ===Georgian exodus=== The Georgian community in Istanbul was also affected. It is estimated that there were about 10,000 Catholic Georgian residents in Istanbul in 1955. Most of the Georgians emigrated to Australia, Canada, Europe and the United States following the pogrom. As of 1994, there were only about 200 Catholic Georgians and a handful of Jewish Georgian families left in Istanbul. ===Trials in Turkey=== After the military coup of 1960, Menderes and Zorlu were charged at the Yassiada Trial in 1960\u201361 with violating the constitution. The trial also made reference to the pogrom, for which they were blamed. The accused were denied fundamental rights regarding their defence, and they were found guilty and sentenced to death by hanging. ===Later careers of press people involved=== The editor of the Istanbul Ekspres, G\u00f6k\u015fin Sipahio\u011flu, went on to found Sipa Press; an international photo agency based in France. The owner, Mithat Perin, already a DP member, became a parliamentarian. ===2005 exhibition assault=== In 2005, Turkish nationalists attacked a photography exhibition dedicated to the fiftieth anniversary of the 1955 riots held in \u0130stanbul. The exhibition itself was initially heralded as a major step forward for the development of democratic values in preparation of Turkey's admittance into the European Union. The military prosecutor at the time of the riots, vice admiral Fahri \u00c7oker, kept documents and approximately 250 photographs of the events in order to educate posterity. He entrusted them to the Turkish Historical Society, stipulating that they be exhibited 25 years after his death. Two hours prior the opening of the exhibition, a nationalist lawyer and former president of \u00dclk\u00fc Ocaklar\u0131 Ramazan Kirik, Kemal Kerin\u00e7siz, inspected the gallery and angrily walked out. Upon the opening of the exhibition, two people stood in front of the venue shouting and announcing that this exhibition was a misrepresentation of reality and that it wasn't considerate towards the sufferings of the Turkish people. Moments later, a 20\u201330 militant nationalist mob that belonged to the \u00dclk\u00fcc\u00fcler nationalist organization raided and defaced the exhibitVick, Karl. \"In Turkey, a Clash of Nationalism and History\", Washington Post, 30 September 2005. by hurling eggs at the photographs and trampling over them.\"Attack Video\" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=towG9RF9R7o&t;=2m39s Some of the photographs were thrown outside windows only to be stamped upon by other raiders. The raiders also distributed pamphlets and flyers that said, \"Turkey is Turkish, will remain Turkish,\" \"death to traitors,\" \"love it or leave it,\" \"Cyprus is Turkish and will remain Turkish,\" \"why not the pictures from Cyprus but these,\" and \"don't defend those who set fire to Atat\u00fcrk's house.\" The raid was led by Kerin\u00e7siz and nationalist lawyer Levent Temiz who have been taken into custody in 2008 for their suspected connection with Ergenekon. The assault was described by Feyyaz Yaman, the director of the gallery, as a repeat of the 1955 rioting in itself. The President of the Turkish Historical Society Orhan Silier condemned the attacks and stated that such acts of this event \"will affect Turkey's image abroad.\" He also mentioned that \"These protests show that groups based on the same violent methods, fear and paranoia, still exist.\" The incident was shown in Screamers, a 2006 documentary film about the Armenian Genocide. ===Oktay Engin's later career=== Oktay Engin continued his studies at Istanbul University's Faculty of Law. His school in Thessaloniki refused to share his transcript, but with only a certificate showing he had completed the first year, the university senate allowed Engin to continue from the second. After graduation, he started an internship in Cyprus. However, he was summoned by Orhan \u00d6zt\u0131rak, the minister of internal affairs, to monitor Greek radio stations. Next he placed first in a government exam that led to his becoming the governor (kaymakam) of the most important district, \u00c7ankaya. One year later, the chief of the police force, Hayrettin Nakipo\u011flu, invited him to be the chair of the Political Affairs Branch (). Under normal conditions, reaching such a position would require 15\u201320 years of work, starting from his position as a district governor. He remained in the police force thereafter, working his way up to the chief of the security department, and the deputy chief of the entire police force. Finally, in 1991 he was promoted to the governorship of Nev\u015fehir Province. Engin rejects all allegations of culpability \u2014indeed, of even being a spy or an acquaintance of General Yirmibe\u015fo\u011flu. ==International legacy== In August 1995, the US Senate passed a special resolution marking the September 1955 pogrom, calling on the President of the United States Bill Clinton to proclaim 6 September as a Day of Memory for the victims of the pogrom. ==Current anti-Greek tendencies in Turkey== At present (2013), popular Turkish TV shows are alleged to portray the Greek people in a negative way. This resulted in complaints by representatives of the local Greek communities, since similar tendencies triggered the outbreak of anti-Greek pogroms and massive expulsions during the 1950s and 1960s. ==See also== * Anti-Greek sentiment * 1918 Toronto anti-Greek riot * Greek Town riot * Racism and discrimination in Turkey * Varlik Vergisi * Great Fire of 1660 * Greeks in Turkey * Turkish nationalism * Demographics of Istanbul ==References== ==Further reading== * Alexandris, Alexis.
