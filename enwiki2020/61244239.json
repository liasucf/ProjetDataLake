    "text": "The 2019 Women's Sultana Bran Hockey One was the inaugural women's edition of Hockey Australia's national league, Hockey One. The tournament was held across 7 states and territories of Australia. The tournament started on 29 September and culminated on 16 November 2019. The grand final of the tournament was hosted by HC Melbourne, as the top ranked team to qualify for the final. Brisbane Blaze won the tournament after defeating HC Melbourne 3\u20132 in a penalty shoot-out after the final finished as a 1\u20131 draw. Adelaide Fire finished in bronze position, following results from the pool stage. ==Competition format== ===Format=== The 2019 Hockey One will follow a similar format to that of the final edition of the Australian Hockey League. Teams will play a series of home and away matches during the Pool Stage, which will be followed by a Classification Round. During the pool stage, teams play each other once in either a home or a way fixture. The top four ranked teams will then qualify for the Classification Round, playing in two semi-finals with the winners contesting a grand final. Team 1 will host Team 4, while Team 2 will host Team 3. Of the two victorious teams, the higher ranked team from the pool stage will host the grand final. ===Rules=== In addition to FIH sanctioned rules, Hockey Australia is implementing the following rules for Hockey One: * When a field goal or penalty stroke is scored the same athlete will have an automatic one-on-one shootout with the goalkeeper for an extra goal. * Outright winner: There will be no drawn games. In the event of a draw, teams will contest a penalty shoot-out to determine a winner. ===Point allocation=== Match points will be distributed as follows: * 5 points: win * 3 points: shoot-out win * 2 points: shoot-out loss * 0 points: loss ==Participating teams== The seven teams competing in the league come from Australia's states and territories, with the Northern Territory being the only team absent.
