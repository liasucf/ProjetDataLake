It comprised ministers from the Serbian Progressive Party, Socialist Party of Serbia, Social Democratic Party of Serbia, Movement of Socialists and New Serbia, as well as some independent ministers. The cabinet was voted in on April 28, 2014.https://www.dw.com/sr/srbija-ima-novu-vladu/a-17594855 (16.8.2020) On 17 January 2016 Vu\u010di\u0107 called for a snap election claiming Serbia \"needs four more years of stability so that it is ready to join the European Union\". The National Assembly was dissolved on 3 March, thus turning the cabinet into a caretaker government. Parliamentary election was held on 24 April 2016, and Vu\u010di\u0107's Serbian Progressive Party-led coalition retained its majority, winning 131 of the 250 seats. Vu\u010di\u0107 announced the new cabinet on 8 August, consisting of eight old and eight new ministers, retaining the coalition with the Socialist Party. The new government was approved by the National Assembly on August 10. ==Cabinet members== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Position ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Portfolio ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Name ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Image ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | In Office ! colspan=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" | Party |- | Prime Minister | General Affairs |Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | First Deputy Prime Minister | General Affairs | rowspan=\"2\"|Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 | rowspan=\"2\"|80px | rowspan=\"2\"| 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 | rowspan=\"2\"|SPS |- | Minister | Foreign Affairs |- | Deputy Prime Minister | General Affairs | rowspan=\"2\"|Zorana Mihajlovi\u0107 | rowspan=\"2\"|80px | rowspan=\"2\"| 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 | rowspan=\"2\"|SNS |- | Minister | Transportation, Construction and Infrastructure |- | Deputy Prime Minister | General Affairs | rowspan=\"2\"|Rasim Ljaji\u0107 | rowspan=\"2\"|80px | rowspan=\"2\"| 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 | rowspan=\"2\"|SDPS |- | Minister | Trade, Telecommunications and Tourism |- | Deputy Prime Minister | General Affairs | rowspan=\"2\"|Kori Udovi\u010dki | rowspan=\"2\"|80px | rowspan=\"2\"| 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 | rowspan=\"2\"|None |- | Minister | Public Administration and Local Self-Government |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Minister | rowspan=\"2\"|Finance |Lazar Krsti\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 15 July 2014 |None |- | rowspan=\"2\"|Du\u0161an Vujovi\u0107 | rowspan=\"2\"|80px | 15 July 2014 - 11 August 2016 | rowspan=\"2\"|None |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Minister | rowspan=\"2\"|Economy | 27 April 2014 - 3 September 2014 |- | \u017deljko Serti\u0107 |80px | 3 September 2014 - 11 August 2016 |None |- | Minister | Agriculture and Environmental Protection |Sne\u017eana Bogosavljevi\u0107 Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SPS |- | Minister | Energy and Mining |Aleksandar Anti\u0107 | | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SPS |- | Minister | Justice |Nikola Selakovi\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | Minister | Internal Affairs |Neboj\u0161a Stefanovi\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Minister | rowspan=\"2\"|Defence |Bratislav Ga\u0161i\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 05 February 2016 |SNS |- |Zoran \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107 |80px | 2 March 2016 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | Minister | Education and Science |Sr\u0111an Verbi\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |None |- | Minister | Health |Zlatibor Lon\u010dar |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | Minister | Labour, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy |Aleksandar Vulin |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |PS |- | Minister | Youth and Sports |Vanja Udovi\u010di\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | Minister | Culture and Information |Ivan Tasovac |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |None |- | Minister without portfolio | European Integration |Jadranka Joksimovi\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |SNS |- | Minister without portfolio | Emergency Situations |Velimir Ili\u0107 |80px | 27 April 2014 - 11 August 2016 |NS |} ==See also== *Cabinet of Ivica Da\u010di\u0107 *List of Prime Ministers of Serbia *Cabinet of Serbia ==References== ==External links== Category:Cabinets of Serbia Category:2014 establishments in Serbia Category:Cabinets established in 2014 ",
