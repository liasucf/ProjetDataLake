    "text": "Struttin' and Shoutin' is an album by trombonist Al Grey recorded in 1976 but not released on Columbia Records until 1983.Discogs album entry, accessed April 25, 2017 == Reception == The Rolling Stone Jazz Record Guide said \"the entire date has an energetic but familiar feel\". The Allmusic review stated \"Trombonist Al Grey, a master of the wah-wah mute, had a rare opportunity to record with a major label in 1976. But Columbia almost lost the master, and when it was finally released in 1983, one of the principals (tenor saxophonist Jimmy Forrest) had already died. Despite its delayed arrival, this upbeat set (dominated by soulful blues but also including two standards) was worth the wait\". == Track listing == All compositions by Al Grey except where noted # \"Blues, Ray and Grey\" (Ernie Wilkins) \u2013 6:48 # \"Stardust\" (Hoagy Carmichael, Mitchell Parish) \u2013 5:55 # \"Reverend Grey\" \u2013 6:01 # \"Struttin' and Shoutin'\" \u2013 5:04 # \"All of Me\" (Gerald Marks, Seymour Simons) \u2013 4:25 # \"Potholes\" (Wilkins) \u2013 4:05 # \"Homage to Norman\" \u2013 3:00 == Personnel == *Al Grey \u2013 trombone *Danny Moore, Waymon Reed \u2013 trumpet *Jack Jeffers \u2013 bass trombone *Ernie Wilkins \u2013 soprano saxophone (track 2) *Jimmy Forrest \u2013 tenor saxophone *Cecil Payne \u2013 baritone saxophone *Ray Bryant \u2013 piano *Milt Hinton \u2013 bass *Bobby Durham \u2013 drums == References == Category:1983 albums Category:Al Grey albums Category:Columbia Records albums Category:Albums produced by John Hammond (producer) ",
