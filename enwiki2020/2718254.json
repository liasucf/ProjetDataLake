    "text": "365 Fri was the debut album of the Norwegian band Tre Sm\u00e5 Kinesere. It was an instant hit in their home country, reaching number two on the album charts. Their acoustic, melodic pop songs written by singer and guitarist Ulf Risnes represented an antithesis to the predominant punk-inspired rock played by bands such as Dum Dum Boys or Raga Rockers. The songs \"Ingen Blir Igjen\" (\"No one Remains\", dealing with the problem of depopulation of regional Norway) and \"Kj\u00e6rlighet\" (\"Love\", about problematic relationships) have become airplay classics. ==Track listing== # Ingen blir igjen # Du e der v\u00e6l? # Matbit # 365 fri # Da jorda va flat # Kamerat p\u00e6re # Hei verden # Viktig \u00e6rend # Glyserinmusikk # Salig # Okavango # Kj\u00e6rlighet # Sorte Tyr ==References== ==External links== * Tre Sm\u00e5 Kinesere bio at Norsk Rikskringkasting Category:1990 debut albums ",
