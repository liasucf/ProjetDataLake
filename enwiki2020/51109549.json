O'Connor and H. Hornby of the Western Australian branch of the Australian Natives' Association.

The Australian encouraged the consumption of Australian products and contained articles on manufacturing, politics, literature reviews, artistic submissions as well as ANA events including meetings and conference proceedings. == Availability == Issues of The Australian (1907-1908) have been digitised as part of the Australian Newspapers Digitisation Program, a project of the National Library of Australia in cooperation with the State Library of Western Australia.
