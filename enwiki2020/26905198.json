    "text": "The News Post Leader is a British weekly freesheet that covers the north-east county of Northumberland, including the towns of Cramlington, Ashington, Bedlington and Blyth. ==History== The paper was formed from the amalgamation of several south-east Northumberland titles during the 1960s and 1970s, the oldest of which was the Blyth News founded in 1874. The paper was taken over by Johnston Press in 1999. ==Content== The paper tends to have a focus on community news and events, mixed with its heavy advertising of local companies that is evident throughout. It also tends to cover local politics and the affairs of Northumberland County Council, as well as local sports such as local football team Blyth Spartans. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Newspapers published in Northumberland Category:Newspapers published by Johnston Press ",
