    "text": "The Indiana High School Athletic Association (IHSAA) is the arbiter of interscholastic competition among public and private high schools in the U.S. state of Indiana. It monitors a system that divides athletically-competing high schools in Indiana based on the school's enrollment. The divisions, known as classes, are intended to foster fair competition among schools of similar sizes. A school ranked 3A is larger than a school ranked 1A, but not as large as a 6A-ranked school. Only football has 6 classes. Boys' basketball, girls' basketball, volleyball, baseball and softball are divided into four classes. Boys' and girls' soccer have featured three classes since the 2017\u201318 school year. All other sports compete in a single class. ==Structure== See also: Indiana High School Athletic Conferences Page 1, 2, 3, or IHSAA Conference- Independent Schools The IHSAA is divided into three board of director districts: Northern, Central, and Southern. For the State Tournament, there are two divisions. The Northern District is composed of 21 of Indiana's Counties consisting the northern third of Indiana. The Southern District is composed of the remaining 71 counties and includes all of the Indianapolis area except Boone, Hamilton, and Madison Counties. It is from these two districts, the top two teams meet at the state finals usually held in or around Indianapolis. In the regular season, most of the member-schools' sports activities are governed by one, sometimes two or even three of Indiana's 51 athletic conferences. Some conferences only offer one sport while the school participates in a primary conference for all other sports. Other schools maintain independence in certain sports, like football or basketball. Some smaller sports are governed by other organizations in Indiana. For example, boys' ice hockey is under the auspices of the Indiana State High School Hockey Association (ISHSHA). High school hockey in Indiana is concentrated in the northern portion of the state, around Indianapolis, plus a few other areas, such as Columbus and Evansville. ===Primary Athletic Conferences=== *Allen County *Big Eight *Blue Chip *Central Indiana Athletic *Circle City Conference *Conference Indiana *Duneland Athletic *Eastern Indiana Athletic *Great Lakes Athletic *Greater South Shore Athletic *Hoosier Athletic *Hoosier Crossroads *Hoosier Heartland *Hoosier Heritage *Hoosier Hills *Hoosier North *Indiana Crossroads *Indianapolis Public *Metropolitan Interscholastic *Mid-Eastern *Mid-Hoosier *Mid-Indiana *Midland *Mid-Southern *Mid-State *Midwest Athletic *North Central Athletic *Northeast Corner *Northeast Eight *Northern Indiana Athletic *Northern Lakes *Northern State *Northland *Northwest Crossroads *Northwestern *Ohio River Valley *Patoka Lake *Pocket Athletic *Porter County *Sagamore *Southern Athletic *Southern Indiana Athletic *Southern Roads (Effective 2018-19) *Southwest Indiana *Summit Athletic *Three Rivers *Tri- Eastern *Tri-River *Wabash River *Western Indiana ===Secondary Sport-Specific Conferences=== *Mid-Indiana Football *Southwest Seven Football ===Independents=== *IHSAA Independents ==See also== * Hoosier Hysteria * Largest high school gyms in the United States *Arthur Trester ==References== == External links == * Indiana High School Athletic Association * IHSAA School Directory - Part I * IHSAA School Directory - Part II Category:Education in Indiana Category:High school sports associations in the United States Category:Sports organizations established in 1903 Category:High school sports in Indiana Category:Non-profit organizations based in Indianapolis Category:1903 establishments in Indiana ",
