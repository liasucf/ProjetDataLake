The Mekong river, the twelfth longest in the world, cuts through the middle of Cambodia. The capital Phnom Penh is on its riverbank, at the junction where two other rivers meet: the Tonle Sap and Bassac. The Tonle Sap river connects the Mekong with the Tonle Sap lake, or Great Lake, which acts as a liquid heart and natural reservoir for the entire Mekong river system, regulating the flow of huge volumes of water, and allowing the safe passage of an astonishing number of freshwater fish. The lake itself is believed to have more fish than any other in the world and ranks second to the Amazon river in biodiversity. thumb When the rainy season begins at the start of the Khmer New Year, the region becomes inundated with monsoonal rain and Cambodia turns into a vast ocean of emerald rice-paddies. Rice is the staple food of Cambodia, and it is part of every meal, both as an accompaniment and used as an ingredient for many dishes. According to the International Rice Research Institute, there are 2,000 rice varieties indigenous to Cambodia that were developed over centuries by Cambodian rice farmers. The geographical setting of wetlands (Cambodia ranks second to Bangladesh for the largest amount of wetland in Asia) and floodplains explains why water, and hence fish and rice (which grow in water) are such an integral component to the cuisine. Many dishes, in particular, the samlors, have a pond-like appearance, and are often loaded with reed-like plants, leaves, and vegetables, mirroring the surrounding landscape. Dipping sauces tend to be quite watery, as are most Cambodian curries. Khmer cuisine shares many commonalities with the food of neighbouring Thailand\u2014although, less chilli, sugar and coconut cream are used for flavour\u2014and of neighboring Vietnam, with which it shares and adopts many common dishes, as well as a colonial history, as both formed part of the French colonial empire in Southeast Asia. It has drawn upon influences from the cuisines of China and France, powerful players in Cambodian history. The Chinese began arriving in the 13th century, but Chinese migration accelerated during the French period. Curry dishes, known as Kari (in Khmer, ) show a trace of cultural influence from India. The many variations of rice noodles show the influences from Chinese cuisine. The Portuguese and Spanish also had considerable influence in Cambodian affairs in the 16th century, introducing chilli and peanuts into Asia from the New World. However, chilli never gained the same status or prominence as it did with the cuisines of neighboring Thailand, Laos, and Malaysia. Even today very few recipes include chilli. Kampot One legacy of French cuisine, the baguette\u2014known as nom pang in Khmer\u2014is ubiquitous in all parts of Cambodia today. Cambodians often eat bread with p\u00e2t\u00e9, tinned sardines or eggs. One of these with a cup of strong coffee, sweetened with condensed milk, is an example of a common Cambodian breakfast. Freshly buttered baguettes can be made into sandwiches (also called nom pang) and may be stuffed with slices of ham or any number of grilled meats, with Kampot pepper, similar to Vietnamese banh mi. The French also introduced beer, butter, pate, coffee, chocolate, onions, carrots, broccoli, potatoes and many other types of non-native produce Southeast Asia. Traditionally, Cambodians eat their meals with at least three or four dishes. A meal will usually include a soup, or samlor, served alongside the main courses. Each individual dish will be either sweet, sour, salty or bitter in taste. Chilli (fresh, pickled or dried) and chilli sauce is served on the side and left up to individual diners and to their taste. In this way, Cambodians ensure that they get a bit of every flavor to satisfy their palates. ==Ingredients== ===Fermented sauces=== Prahok fried in banana leaves with fresh green vegetables and steamed rice. Prahok ktis In Khmer cuisine, a distinction is made between fermented paste-based ingredients and pickled ingredients. Mam refers to fish or shrimp that has been fermented in a particular technique and is usually includes more solid pieces of the pickled animal. Mam is the general term for most kinds of fermented ingredients created from aquatic animals. Prahok and kapi are popular bases for sauces with pickled aged ingredients. Both mam and prahok are aged for a minimum of one year in order to reach the full taste potential, much like fish sauce. Fermented sauces are often eaten with high protein-based dishes or raw vegetables to aid digestion. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\"|Name !Description |- |mam (fermented seafood) |Mam refers to the salted, fermented fillets of snakehead fish, to which roasted red sticky rice and palm sugar are added during the fermenting process to impart an earthier and sweeter flavour. The sugar and rice also lends the ingredient a reddish tinge. From the time that the fish is filleted, mam can take over a year to reach maturity. Mam originates from the Mekong Delta in Vietnam. |- |prahok |A common ingredient, almost a national institution, is a pungent type of fermented fish paste used in many dishes, a distinctive flavoring known as prahok (). It is an acquired taste for most Westerners and is an integral part of Khmer cuisine. It is included in many dishes or used as a dipping sauce. The liberal use of prahok, which adds a salty tang to many dishes, is a characteristic which distinguishes Khmer cuisine from that of its neighbours. Prahok can be prepared many ways and eaten as a dish on its own right. Prahok jien (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u1785\u17c0\u1793) is fried and usually mixed with meat (usually beef or pork) and chili. It can be eaten with dips, vegetables like cucumbers or eggplants, and rice. Prahok gop or prahok ang (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u1780\u1794\u17cb) or (\u1794\u17d2\u179a\u17a0\u17bb\u1780\u17a2\u17b6\u17c6\u1784) is covered with banana leaves and left to cook under a fire under pieces of rock or over the coals. When prahok is not used, kap\u01d0 (), a kind of fermented shrimp paste, is used instead. Khmer cuisine also uses fish sauce widely in soups and stir- fried dishes, and as a dipping sauce. |- |kapi |Another common ingredient in Khmer cuisine, this fermented shrimp paste is often mixed with garlic and chili peppers and used as a dipping sauces for grilled and fried meats. It is also a common ingredient in certain curries and papaya salads to add salt and richer flavors. |- |mam trey tok (fermented snakehead fish) |A variation of \"mam\" using a very popular fish, that lives in the flowing rivers of the Great Mekong. Its abundance makes it popular within Cambodia and Vietnam, where they are caught and used.

It is also used as a dipping sauce (\"tuek chr'louk\") containing many varieties depending on the type of dish presented in the meal. Fish sauce acts to counterbalance the flavors of the other dishes within the family meal to ensure that all five tastes are achieved to create a harmonious meal. |- |teuk krom (oyster sauce) |Oyster sauce was introduced by Chinese immigrants.

Black pepper is the preferred choice when heat is wanted in a dish; it is used in stir fries, soups, marinades for grilled meats, and dipping sauces. Pepper has a long history in Cambodia, having been grown since at least the 13th century, while the pungent, aromatic variety from Kampot province (bordering Vietnam's Ha Tien province and the Gulf of Thailand to the south, and the jungle-clad Elephant Mountains to the north) was once Cambodia's chief export from the late 1800s up till the 1960s. Kampot pepper was once known as the King of Peppers, revered by gourmets worldwide, especially known to Parisian chefs, for its floral and eucalyptus notes, its heady aroma, its musky heat, and its medicinal properties. Before the 1970s, Kampot pepper was used in all French restaurants for the classic dish steak au poivre. Today, the pepper industry is being revitalised and, since acquiring protected Geographic Indication status in 2008 (which gives it the same special status as Champagne in France), people can purchase Kampot pepper online in many parts of the world. Jungle cardamom, or wild cardamom, grows in the aptly named Cardamom Mountains in the southwest of the country, bordering the Gulf of Thailand coast to the south and Trat province in Thailand to the west. These vast mountains form some of the last remaining area of intact virgin rainforest in Southeast Asia and harbour extensive mangrove forests, elephants, tigers, Siamese crocodiles and other rare and endangered species, and few people live in this area. Locals use cardamom medicinally and in certain samlors, using the root of the plant as well as the pod. Turmeric () is grown in Battambang province and is a common ingredient in many curry powders, soups and rice dishes. Saffron is also esteemed in local folk medicine as a treatment for many ailments, especially skin problems. Tamarind is commonly employed as a soup base for dishes such as samlar machu. Star anise is a must when caramelizing meat in palm sugar like pork in the dish known as pak lov. Turmeric, galangal, ginger, lemongrass and kaffir lime leaves are essential spices in Khmer cooking, Khmer stews, and nearly all curries.Recipes 4 Us Cooking by Country: Cambodia Accessed 21 July 2007.

Daily fresh catches come from the Mekong River, Bassac River and the vast Tonl\u00e9 Sap. Fish is far more common than meat in Khmer cuisine. Prahok itself is based on fish. Many of the fish eaten in Cambodia are freshwater fish from the Tonl\u00e9 Sap or from the Mekong. Dried salted fish known as () are a favourite with plain rice porridge. The popular Khmer dish called Amok trey uses a kind of catfish steamed in a savoury coconut-based curry. The small fish known as Trey Dang Dau are very common and are often eaten deep-fried. While freshwater fish is the most commonly used meat in the Cambodian diet, pork and chicken are also popular. Though not as common as in neighbouring Vietnam, vegetarian food is a part of Khmer cuisine and often favoured by more observant Buddhists. Pork is quite popular in making sweet sausages known as Sach Krok. Beef and chicken are stewed, grilled or stir fried. Seafood includes an array of shellfish such as crabs, clams, cockles, crayfish, shrimp and squid. Giant freshwater prawns, sometimes referred to as river lobsters, are not commonly eaten because of their price, but middle-class and rich Cambodians enjoy eating them. Duck roasted in Chinese char siu style is popular during festivals. More unusual varieties of meat include frog, turtle, and arthropods (including tarantulas) as well as insects such as crickets; these are difficult to find in Khmer cuisine abroad but are used in everyday dishes in Cambodia. * Beef (Sach Ko) * Pork (Sach Chrouk) * Char siu (Chha Chiu or Sa See) * Siu mei (Kvai) * Frog (Kon Kaeb) * Naem - Fermented Sour Sausage (Nem) * Rice Paper- Rice Paper wrapper (Num Naem Chhao) * Chicken (Sach Moan) * Jiaozi (Kiev) * Shumai (Siev Mai) * Duck (Sach Tia) * Snail (Khyang) * P\u00e2t\u00e9 (Pat Tae) * Spring roll- Wheat- based pastry wrapper (Num Cha yor) * Fish (Trey) * Water buffalo (Sach Krabey) * Tarantula (Ping Pieng Chien) * Crocodile (Sach Krapeu) * Sausage (Kwah Sach or Sach Krok) * Eggs (Pong) * Popiah- Chaozhou/Fujian spring roll wrapper (Num Por Pear) ===Noodles=== Mee Kola, a vegetarian noodle dish Many elements of Cambodian noodle dishes were inspired by Chinese and Vietnamese cookingThe Worldwide Gourmet Saveurs du Cambodge All you want to know about Cambodian Cuisine Accessed 21 July 2007. despite maintaining a distinct Khmer variation.
