Both countries have full diplomatic relations since the middle of the 20th century, and each has been represented by a full embassy in the other, until 2018. ==History== In 1947, Paraguay was one of the thirty-three countries to vote for the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine, effectively paving way for the creation of Israel. The two countries opened up diplomatic relations in 1949. Israel's embassy in Asunci\u00f3n was closed in 2002 due to budget cuts, although legal professionals in Israel alleged that it was on religious grounds. It was reopened in July 2015. In 2005, the Paraguayan embassy in Mevaseret Zion was closed, also due to budgetary constraints, and reopened in 2013 in Herzliya. On May 21, 2018, Paraguayan President Horacio Cartes announced that the Paraguayan embassy moved to Jerusalem, becoming the third country in the world, after the United States and Guatemala, to recognize the city as the diplomatic capital of Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greatly appreciated it; on the very day of the transfer, he attended the opening ceremony and there expressed an enduring friendship. This was reversed in September 2018 by Cartes' successor, Mario Abdo Ben\u00edtez. Foreign Minister Luis Castiglioni stated that \"Paraguay wants to contribute to an intensification of regional diplomatic efforts to achieve a broad, fair and lasting peace in the Middle East.\" Israel subsequently shut down its embassy and cancelled a delegation aimed at aiding Paraguay\u2019s economic development.Paraguay reverses Jerusalem embassy move; fuming Israel shuts Asunci\u00f3n mission.
