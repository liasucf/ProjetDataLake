    "text": "Marcos Roberto Silveira Reis (born 4 August 1973), known as Marcos, is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a goalkeeper. He spent his entire career at Palmeiras, of the S\u00e9rie A, from 1992 until his retirement in January 2012, and became one of the club's greatest idols, being nicknamed S\u00e3o Marcos (\"Saint Mark\" in Portuguese). He was the starting goalkeeper of the champion Brazilian squad of the 2002 FIFA World Cup. He is regarded by pundits as one of the greatest Brazilian goalkeepers of all time. ==Club career== Marcos playing for Palmeiras in 2010 He played for Brazilian professional club Palmeiras since 1992 and was the first goalkeeper since 1999 after an injury of Velloso, the first-choice goalkeeper at the time. With outstanding performances in the 1999 Copa Libertadores he helped the team conquer the title, after beating Palmeiras' arch rivals Corinthians in the penalty shoot- outs in the quarter-final. Since then he was nicknamed S\u00e3o Marcos. In 2000 once again he faced Corinthians in the Libertadores, this time at the semi- final level, and again eliminated the rivals in the penalty shoot-out. In 2002 after a fantastic World Cup participation with Brazil's team he received a proposal from the English team Arsenal and actually went to London to sign but then disappeared leaving Arsenal and fellow Brazilian player, Edu, wondering where he had gone, therefore the deal never happened. When he eventually surfaced he stated that he would rather play the Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B (second division) with Palmeiras than play in any European team just for the money. In 2008, he helped Palmeiras win the 2008 Campeonato Paulista. Marcos played his 400th match for Palmeiras on 21 September 2008 in a Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A match between his club and Vasco. He was given a special shirt for playing his 400th match. The number 400 was printed on the back, with his name and the writings \"O melhor goleiro do Brasil\" (The best goalkeeper in Brazil). On the front, all the titles that he has won along with Palmeiras and Brazil's national team are printed. On 4 January 2012, at the age of 38, Marcos announced his retirement from football, due to his advanced age and the many injuries that marked his career. Marcos is one of the greatest idols of Palmeiras' fans, alongside Ademir da Guia and Djalma Santos. ==International career== Marcos debuted for Brazil in a match against Spain on 13 November 1999. Previously, he was included in Brazil's squad for the 1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica and the 1999 FIFA Confederations Cup as a second-choice goalkeeper. He remained as Brazil's backup goalkeeper as Dida and Rog\u00e9rio Ceni were preferred ahead of him. He became Brazil's starting goalkeeper in the 2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica and retained that position after the tournament, relegating Dida to the bench. He was subsequently included in Brazil's squad for 2002 FIFA World Cup as the first-choice goalkeeper, replacing Taffarel. He started every game in the tournament and played every minute of Brazil's matches in the tournament. He had four clean sheets, conceded only four goals in seven matches, and was elected the third-best goalkeeper in the tournament, as Brazil won the World Cup for the record fifth time. However, after a series of injuries that affected his career, Marcos lost his place in the team after the World Cup. He made only four more international appearances after the World Cup, and was left out of Brazil's squad for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup and the 2004 Copa Am\u00e9rica. In 2005, he was called again and included in the squad for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup. He made one appearance in the tournament, starting in a 2\u20132 draw against Japan during the group stage, which turned out to be his last appearance for Brazil. On 6 October 2005, Marcos announced his retirement from international football, but continued to play for Palmeiras, the only team he has played for in his career. However he would later went back on his decision to retire from the national team, and announced himself as still available for callups. He was placed on standby lists for the 2006 FIFA World Cup and the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica, but did not manage to get a place in the final list of neither competitions. Marcos got specially upset with missing the World Cup in Germany, as he was still recovering from an injury. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie A !colspan=\"2\"|Brazilian Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Paulista League !colspan=\"2\"|South America !colspan=\"2\"|International !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"25\"|Palmeiras |- |1992 |0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||-||-||1||0 |- |1993 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||-||-||0||0 |- |1994 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||-||-||0||0 |- |1995 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||-||-||0||0 |- |1996 |12||0||1||0||4||0||-||-||-||-||17||0 |- |1997 |5||0||0||0||6||0||-||-||-||-||11||0 |- |1998 |1||0||5||0||5||0||-||-||-||-||11||0 |- |1999 |15||0||7||0||22||0||14||0||1||0||59||0 |- |2000 |20||0||0||0||5||0||14||0||-||-||39||0 |- |2001 |14||0||4||0||9||0||12||0||-||-||39||0 |- |2002 |19||0||2||0||20||0||-||-||-||-||41||0 |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie B !colspan=\"2\"|Brazilian Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Paulista League !colspan=\"2\"|South America !colspan=\"2\"|International !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |2003 |32||0||2||0||12||0||-||-||-||-||46||0 |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|S\u00e9rie A !colspan=\"2\"|Brazilian Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Paulista League !colspan=\"2\"|South America !colspan=\"2\"|International !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |2004 |5||0||5||0||9||0||-||-||-||-||19||0 |- |2005 |22||0||-||-||11||0||8||0||-||-||41||0 |- |2006 |4||0||-||-||5||0||5||0||-||-||14||0 |- |2007 |1||0||2||0||11||0||-||-||-||-||14||0 |- |2008 |37||0||4||0||13||0||6||0||-||-||60||0 |- |2009 |36||0||-||-||7||0||12||0||-||-||55||0 |- |2010 |13||0||5||0||17||0||1||0||-||-||36||0 |- |2011 |19||0||3||0||3||0||2||0||0||0||27||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Career total !255!!0!!40!!0!!160!!0!!74!!0!!1!!0!!533!!0 |} ===International=== :Source: {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align: center\" |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Brazil |1999||1||0 |- |2001||11||0 |- |2002||13||0 |- |2003||1||0 |- |2004||1||0 |- |2005||2||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!29!!0 |} ==Honours== Palmeiras *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A: 1993, 1994 *Campeonato Paulista: 1993, 1994, 1996, 2008 *Torneio Rio \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo: 1993, 2000 *Copa do Brasil: 1998 *Copa Mercosur: 1998 *Copa Libertadores: 1999 *Brazilian Champions Cup: 2000 *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B: 2003 Brazil U20 *South American U-20 Championship: 1992 Brazil *Copa Am\u00e9rica: 1999 *FIFA World Cup: 2002 *FIFA Confederations Cup: 2005 Individual *Copa Libertadores Most Valuable Player: 1999 *Copa Libertadores Best Goalkeeper: 1999 *Copa Libertadores Final Most Valuable Player: 1999 *Copa Libertadores Best Newcomer: 1999 *Campeonato Paulista Best Goalkeeper: 1999, 2003, 2008 *Copa Mercosur Best Goalkeeper: 1999 *Torneio Rio \u2013 S\u00e3o Paulo Best Goalkeeper: 2000 *Best Latin American Goalkeeper: 1999, 2002 *IFFHS World's Best Goalkeeper fourth place: 2002 *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie B Most Valuable Player: 2003 *Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A Goalkeeper of the Year: 2008, 2009 ==References== ==External links== *Palmeiras official profile * * *No Dia do Goleiro, PLACAR escolhe os dez 'pared\u00f5es' do futebol brasileiro \u2013 Placar Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Brazil international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras players Category:Campeonato Brasileiro S\u00e9rie A players Category:1999 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:1999 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica players Category:2002 FIFA World Cup players Category:2005 FIFA Confederations Cup players Category:Copa Am\u00e9rica-winning players Category:FIFA Confederations Cup-winning players Category:FIFA World Cup-winning players ",
