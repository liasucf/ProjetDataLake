The website's critical consensus reads, \"Dirty John might not live up to the thrills of its source material, but Connie Britton puts on a clinic with her interpretation of true crime treachery.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the first season a score of 58 out of 100 based on 18 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews.\" In a positive review, Entertainment Weeklys Kristen Baldwin gave the first season a grade of \"A-\" and directed particular praise at the performances in it describing Britton as \"perfectly cast\" and saying of Bana that he \"may benefit the most from Dirty John; as Meehan, the actor pivots from charming to chilling and back again with astonishing ease.\" In a similarly favorable analysis, the Los Angeles Timess Mike Mack commended the first season declaring, \"Glossy and well-acted, its transfer from your daily commute's most suspenseful listening stretch ever to serviceable wine-and- laundry-folding companion show feels, all in all, a smooth one.\" In a more mixed assessment, RogerEbert.coms Brian Tallerico gave the first season qualified praise saying, \"Dirty John is very entertaining, though it's not without faults. It doesn't dig very deep, or present Debra's daughters as full characters (their main roles are to look confused or upset, which is a waste of big talent), and its storytelling can be a little convoluted. But it never claims to be high art.\" In an outright negative appraisal, TVLines Dave Nemetz gave the first season a grade of \"D\" and criticized it saying, \"Britton and her talented co-stars are wasted here on a warmed-over Lifetime movie masquerading as a prestige TV miniseries \u2014 one that's, sadly, not even trashy enough to qualify as a guilty pleasure.\" In another unfavorable evaluation, IndieWires Ben Travers was very critical of the series' first season giving it a grade of \"C-\" and saying that, \"Decidedly not ambitious 'prestige' television, the first three episodes make perfectly clear this isn't a nuanced series, or one interested in exploring abuse or manipulation in serious fashion. It's trying to be a juicy nighttime soap that uses the 'true story' tag to drive viewers' mouths further and further agape.\" Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 88% based on 16 reviews, with an average rating of 6.98/10 for the second season. The website's critics consensus states, \"Although The Betty Broderick Story sensational story is at times scattershot, Amanda Peet's incredible embodiment of a woman scorned is a sight to behold.\" Metacritic gave the second season a score of 69 out of 100 based on 8 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" ===Ratings=== ====Season 1==== ====Season 2==== ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"3\"|2019 | align=\"center\" |Golden Globe Awards | Best Actress \u2013 Miniseries or Television Film | rowspan=2|Connie Britton | | align=\"center\" | |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"|Critics' Choice Television Awards | Best Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television | | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\"| |- | Best Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie Made for Television | Julia Garner | |- |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American crime drama television series Category:2018 American television series debuts Category:2010s American anthology television series Category:2020s American crime drama television series Category:2020s American anthology television series Category:Bravo (American TV network) original programming Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows based on podcasts Category:True crime television series Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:USA Network original programming ",
