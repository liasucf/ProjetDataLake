These included a full slate from the Labour party, while the Conservative and Liberal parties stood 47 and 28 respectively. Other candidates included 8 Residents, 6 Communists and 3 Independents. There were 13 four-seat wards and 1 two-seat ward. This election had aldermen as well as directly elected councillors. The Conservatives got 5 aldermen, Labour 3, and Independents 1. The Council was elected in 1964 as a \"shadow authority\" but did not start operations until 1 April 1965. ==Election result== The results saw no party gain overall control of the new council with Labour winning 26 and the Conservatives winning 25 of the 54 seats. Overall turnout in the election was 45.3%. This turnout included 913 postal votes. ==Ward results== ==References== 1964 Category:1964 London Borough council elections ",
