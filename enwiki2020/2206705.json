He took an early interest in entomology and studied philosophy for two years at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universit\u00e4t in Freiburg im Breisgau. He studied medicine at the University of T\u00fcbingen, and in 1847 he won the medical faculty's prize competition for his dissertation on the blood of invertebrates.Edward Griffor and Craig Smorynski (trans.): Logic's Lost Genius: The Life of Gerhard Gentzen (History of Mathematics, vol. 33). American Mathematical Society 2007, (an English translation) He graduated from T\u00fcbingen in 1848 as a pathologist.Who named it He passed the state exam in 1848 and took a position as the Chief of Pathology at the University of Freiburg. ==Medical career== In 1850 he accompanied his former teacher, Wilhelm Griesinger, to Egypt and became the first chief of the surgery at the Kasr-el-Aini Medical School and Kasr El Aini Hospital of Cairo.

Lea-Febiger, 1986 Also, in 1851, during an autopsy, he discovered the trematode worm that is the cause of urinary schistosomiasis, initially naming it Distomum haematobium. It was subsequently noted that only one of the suckers contained an oral cavity, and in 1856 Heinrich Meckel von Hemsbach proposed that the organism be renamed Bilharzia haematobium. In 1858 Weinland proposed the name Schistosoma (Greek: 'split body') after the male worms' morphology, and the name Schistosoma haematobium was officially adopted by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. In 1853 Bilharz became chief of medicine, and in 1856 he was appointed Professor of Anatomy. ==Death== Bilahrz's grave in old Cairo German Cemetery. He died in 1862 from complications of typhoid fever after returning to Cairo from an expedition to Massawa, at the age of 37. He is buried in Cairo in a grave next to Hans Eisele, a Nazi concentration camp doctor. ==Legacy== *Bilharzia is another term for schistosomiasis. *The Theodor Bilharz Research Institute in Giza, Egypt, is named in his honour. *The crater Bilharz on the Moon was named after him. ==References== ==Further reading== Category:German military doctors Category:German parasitologists Category:1825 births Category:1862 deaths Category:Qasr El Eyni Hospital ",
