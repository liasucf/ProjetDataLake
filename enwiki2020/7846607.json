Zillis was first mentioned in the first half of the 9th Century as Ciranes. Reischen was first mentioned in 1219 as de Rexeno. The municipality site was certainly inhabited even earlier, as a Roman settlement and graves from the 6th or 7th century indicate. A treasure trove of 10th Century coins that were found near the village indicate that there was trade over the Viamala pass by this time. The first church in Zillis dates from about the 5th Century. The three-apse church is from the 8th Century, and around 840 the parish church of St. Martin was first mentioned. In 940 King Otto I gave the Zillis Church to the Bishop of Chur. This gift did not include the church's property, four large farms in Schams and Rheinwald. In 1473 the Viamala road over the Alps opened, which increased traffic on the Spl\u00fcgen and San Bernardino passes. The villages flourished with this increased trade. In 1530-35 Zillis and Reischen converted during the Protestant Reformation. In 1818-23 the Viamala road was expanded with a wider road, which brought increased trade into the villages. ==Geography== Zillis-Reischen has an area, , of .
