His work during this period was documented in the 2018 American documentary film Bathtubs Over Broadway. ==Early life== Hank Beebe was born on July 16, 1926 in Woodbury, New Jersey, to Harold Henry and Miriam Priscilla (n\u00e9e Davidson) Beebe. After High School, Beebe attended the University of North Carolina where he received a Master of Music in 1951. He then moved to Philadelphia and studied composition with Vincent Persichetti at the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music.Celebrating Grace. Make a Joyful Noise \u2013 Choral Plus Folio. Hank Beebe. ==Career== Beebe\u2019s first job was music director at WCAU television in Philadelphia on \u2018\u2019The Children\u2019s Hour\u2019\u2019. In 1967, he worked briefly on The Mike Douglas Show before turning to musical theatre. While working on Broadway in New York City, Beebe auditioned for \"The Chevy Show\": a \"corporate musical\" presenting the new 1957 Chevrolet line of production. Although the show consisted of a musical book, score, cast and full orchestra, it was not meant to be seen by the public; only Detroit dealers and Chevy executives and their employees. Beebe worked as a musical consultant, arranger and composer on hundreds of \"Industrial Musicals\" for General Motors of Detroit, the Radio Corporation of America in Indianapolis, Coca-Cola, Westinghouse and the McDonald's Corporation in Oak Brook, Illinois from the 1950s to the early 1980s. In 1969, Beebe wrote the re-election song for New York City Mayor John Lindsay. In the early 1990s, staff writer for The David Letterman Show, Steve Young purchased an album entitled Go Fly a Kite (a 1966 GE Industrial Musical), for Letterman\u2019s \"Dave\u2019s Record Collection\" segment. \"It started as something to make fun of,\" Young said. \"I thought, How pathetic, an insurance musical. But then I wondered why, three days later, I was still singing these songs.\" Record collector Scott Murphy teamed up with Young to write the book \"\u2018\u2019Everything's Coming Up Profits: The Golden Age of Industrial Musicals\u2019\u2019\u201d in 2013 which told the story of Beebe and other composers and actors who took part in creating these one- time corporate musicals. Their collaboration was turned into the award-winning documentary \u2018\u2019Bathtubs Over Broadway\u2019\u2019.Bathtubs Over Broadway. Official Website. Beebe also wrote for both Off- and On- Broadway. His most popular work was the musical The Cowboy and The Tiger that ran for two years at the York Playhouse and the East 74th Street Theatre in New York city and starred Jack Gilford and Paul O'Keefe. It later aired on ABC as a made-for-television musical starring the original cast in 1963. The audience reception and critical acclaim was so positive, that ABC reprogrammed the musical 10 days later. His next musical, Tuscaloosa\u2019s Calling Me \u2026 But I\u2019m Not Going! (sometimes simply called: Tuscaloosa), was also a success. It opened Off- Broadway on December 1, 1975 and ran for 452 performances. Beebe received the 1975\u201376 Outer Critics Circle Award for \u201cBest Off-Broadway Musical\u201d. Theater critic Edith Oliver wrote in her review for The New Yorker: \u201cI hope it runs forever.\u201dCAST & CREW. Happy 25th, Schoolhouse Arts Center. Muriel Kenderdine. April 2013. In 1977, Beebe was contracted to work on the revival of the musical Hellzapoppin with Jerry Lewis and Lynn Redgrave; but due to complications with Lewis, the show never made it to Broadway.The Angry Professor: My (Failed) Attempt to Interview Jerry Lewis.
