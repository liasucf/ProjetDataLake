    "text": "Queen Bee is the name of six different DC Comics supervillains. The leader of the hiveworld Korll, Zazzala lives only for the interstellar expansion of her species. Zazzala first appeared in Justice League of America #23 (November 1963). She clashed with the original Justice League several times during the 1960s and 1970s, but largely disappeared for several decades. ==Fictional character biographies== ===Queen Bee (Zazzala)=== Zazzala reappeared in JLA volume 3, #34 (October 1999), when Lex Luthor contacts her to join his Injustice Gang. She agrees, freeing The General from his asteroid prison in exchange for a percentage of Earth's population to become her drones. She also participates in other battles against the League. Her main effort is concentrated upon the city of New York. She forces many of the citizens to craft an 'egg matrix' out of local supplies as a way to secure even more mind- control. She attempts to brainwash Green Lantern and Steel to serve her using 'hypno-pollen', but both heroes are able to fight it off; Huntress encouraged Green Lantern to resist the pollen, and Steel's suit's data-protection immune systems protected him from the pollen's effects (Although Steel still pretended that the pollen had affected him in order to wait for the right moment to figure out what he should attack in order to do the most damage). The Queen displayed impressive physical strength, as she was able to overpower, dominate, and defeat Big Barda in direct combat. Using the Queen Bee's inability to see the color red, which many of the superheroes had in their costumes, Wonder Woman and Big Barda keep the Queen's forces occupied while Steel and Plastic Man get the drop on the Queen, Plastic Man covering Steel to render him virtually invisible to the bees. Utilizing a Boom Tube, technology controlled by Barda, they teleport the Queen and her army back to Korll. Later, Zazzala and her drones join Lex Luthor's new Secret Society of Super Villains. The Queen becomes the leader of the H.I.V.E., a multi-national criminal enterprise. She appears in the six-part Villains United limited series. A small team of villains, known as the Secret Six, attack her base as part of a war against the Society. Her forces are defeated, the base's prisoner, Firestorm, is freed and Zazzala herself is badly wounded. One Year Later, Zazzala appears in JLA volume 4, #20, fully healed from her injuries, and attempting to steal a matter transportation device that will appear to allow her to transport her troops to earth. She is defeated by Wonder Woman and captured by the Flash. ===Queen Bee (Marcia Monroe)=== Marcia Monroe was a spoiled young woman, daughter of a wealthy man, who enjoyed risking her life in absurd and pointless situations. Her playgirl attitude created trouble for the police, who often tried to save her from harm during her own stunts. One day, she was rescued by Batman, who brought her down to the ground and spanked her in public, making news in the headlines of the most notorious newspapers. Shortly after this encounter, Marcia started following Batman on his crime- busting activities and provided unrequested help when Batman least expected it. Marcia revealed that Batman's vulgar display of power was enough to make her fall in love with him. Batman and Marcia became an inseparable couple, but one day, she vanished without a trace. Some time later, Batman saved a girl from being attacked with an arrow and soon he realized it was Marcia. She had returned to Gotham to ask Batman to return a valuable stolen gem which she had acquired from her father. Batman agreed to help her, but Marcia double-crossed Batman and provided evidence to the police incriminating Batman for the stealing of the gem. It was later revealed that Marcia had joined the crime syndicate known as CYCLOPS under the codename of Queen Bee. She was the leader of the task force that was in charge of releasing Eclipso from his human host, Bruce Gordon. With Eclipso's help, Queen Bee started a criminal spree and a campaign to get the criminal organizations of Gotham City under the control of CYCLOPS. However, when Eclipso threatened to murder Batman, Marcia intervened and saved the man she loved. She then revealed that she had been forced to join CYCLOPS in order to save her father. Marcia helped Batman find a way to escape from Eclipso's trap and before parting ways, she gave Batman the real stolen gem and promised to stall Eclipso for a moment until he managed to escape. Batman was able to clear his name and stopped Eclipso with Bruce Gordon's help, but Marcia vanished from his life once again and never returned. ===Queen Bee of Bialya=== An unrelated Queen Bee was introduced in Justice League International #16 (August 1988). She was an ordinary human femme fatale, who gained control of the terrorist nation of Bialya by forging an alliance with its former ruler Colonel Rumaan Harjavti then assassinating him. She solidified her power by brainwashing the Global Guardians into serving her. She has clashed several times with Justice League International and Justice League Europe. Justice League Europe found out that the Queen Bee was behind their recent troubles, and that she had a Dominator named Doctor working for her. They invaded her palace and came to an agreement; she would cease hostilities against them if they kept quiet about the unethical things she was doing as Queen. They also demanded she sever relations with the Doctor. After they left, she killed the Doctor. The Queen had far-reaching influences, managing to put one of her own operatives in charge of the League via the United Nations.(JLA #53-54 \u2022 JLE #29-30) The Queen Bee was eventually defeated by the JLE and the Guardians, who learned of her brainwashing plot. She was assassinated by Rumaan Harjavti's brother Sumaan, during the events of the JLA/JLE crossover Breakdowns (1991). ===Queen Bee (Tazzala)=== Queen Bee appeared in the 2000 Creature Commandos series. On the otherdimensional world of Terra Arcana, Zazzala's sister Tazzala joined Simon Magus's Terra Arcana Army with the ultimate goal of conquering Earth. The U.S. Army faction known as the Creature Commandos stopped the invasion plans. Tazzala herself was killed by Simon. ===Queen Bee of Bialya (Beatriz)=== The sister of the second Queen Bee, Beatriz was introduced in JLA: Incarnations #6 (December 2001, but set around 1996) as the new ruler of Bialya. She is using humans forged with machinery and passed off as the robot Extremists to police her country. Her fate since Captain Atom's Extreme Justice team brought an end to these activities is unknown, but she was presumably toppled from power as she no longer rules Bialya. ===H.I.V.E. Queen=== ====The New 52==== In \"The New 52\" (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), Queen Bee is revamped and renamed the H.I.V.E. Queen. She makes her debut in Superman #21 as the leader of H.I.V.E.Superman Vol 3 #21 August 2013 She claims to be Brainiac's daughter.Superman Vol 3 #21 August 2013 She is a member of the Twenty, a group of otherwise ordinary Metropolis citizens who are infected with a virus by Brainiac that grants them each psionic powers. However, her worldview is distorted and she becomes a zealous devotee of the alien. She creates H.I.V.E. using the fa\u00e7ade of a benevolent social media company. Her plan is to actually kidnap other people with psionic potential and use their harvested mental energy to enslave the world in preparation for Brainiac's return. After trying to bend the telepath Hector Hammond to her will but inadvertedly unleashing him, her entire plan is thwarted. She comes into conflict with the latter as well as another telepath, the Psycho Pirate, also a member of the Twenty, during the Psi War storyline. Superman and Lois Lane, who had also been infected with the same psionic virus, manage to defeat them. The H.I.V.E. Queen disappears in the aftermath of the battle.Superman Vol 3 #21-24 She reappears much later in Teen Titans, where she takes control of the entire city of New Orleans. She then has the mind-controlled citizenry build satellite dishes that are actually psionic amplifiers that will allow her to take over every mind across the United States. However, the Titans are in the city at the same time and manage to resist her mental influence thanks to Raven's magic. Robin and the latter eventually assault her base and defeat her, freeing the city from her control.Teen Titans Vol 4 #23 ====DC Rebirth==== The H.I.V.E. Queen returns in the pages of Red Hood and the Outlaws, having set up a new base of operations in Gotham City. Red Hood confronts her over millions of dollars he stole from Penguin which the crime boss owed her for services rendered. Jason uses his suit's taser to disable her henchmen and she is knocked out by Bizarro and captured before she can read Jason's mind. ==Publication history== The Zazzala version of Queen Bee first appeared in Justice League of America #23 and was created by Gardner Fox and Mike Sekowsky. The first Bialyn Queen Bee first appeared in Justice League International #16 and was created by J.M. DeMatteis and Keith Giffen. The Tazzala version of Queen Bee first appeared in Creature Commandos #1. The Beatriz version of Queen Bee first appeared in JLA: Incarnations #6 and was created by John Ostrander, and Val Semeiks. ==Powers and abilities== The first Queen Bee, Zazzala, has insect-like superhuman strength and speed, can fire venomous stinger darts from a set of glands on her right wrist, or release mind-confusing \"pollen\" powder. She and her drones are unable to perceive the color red. She is a capable enough combatant to fight Big Barda, and to dominate and defeat her. Zazzala's sister, Tazzala, presumably had similar abilities. The Queen Bee of Bialya had no superhuman powers or abilities, aside from her beauty and cunning. Her sister Beatriz was also an ordinary human, but was nowhere as resourceful as her sister. The sixth Queen has great psionic powers including telepathy, mind control, empathy, casting extremely realistic and complex illusions to distract others or trick people into seeing her differently, telekinesis, projecting harmful blasts of psionic energy and feeding off the mental energies of others to fuel her own powers. She also displayed some sort of healing factor, being able to reconstruct her entire body from scratch after she was blasted to pieces by the Psycho Pirate. Her intellect is also increased to the \"12th level\", courtesy of the psionic virus she is infected with by Brainiac. She has been described as a \"world-class telepath\" by Robin and has proven capable of controlling thousands of people at once without visibly straining herself. ==Other versions== ===Action Comics=== A different version of Queen Bee named Lisa Raven first appears in Action Comics #42 (November 1941). Lissa Raven was the daughter of a brilliant psychologist who specialized in the working of the brain. Her father invented a machine that removes all worry from a person's thoughts. Lissa made herself the test subject, but something went wrong. The device robbed her of a conscience, turning her into a criminal. She started calling herself the \"Queen Bee\", and became an opponent to Mr. America. In her brief, colorful criminal career, Queen Bee used such amazing weapons as a giant robot and a mob of undead Vikings. Eventually, her father built another machine that would change Lissa back to normal. Afterward, she had no memory of her criminal activities, so Mr. America let her stay with her dad rather than arrest her. ===Quality Universe=== An alternate Queen Bee appears in Blackhawk #38 (March 1951). Queen Bee was the leader of an organization called \"The Golden Swarm\". They poisoned prominent townspeople and swayed public opinion in their favor partly by their comely appearance. The Blackhawks managed to defeat the Queen and her henchgirls by scaring them with mice. ===Super Friends (tie in comics)=== Zazzala appears in Super Friends tie in comics. ===JLA/Avengers=== Queen Bee is among the mind-controlled villains who attack the heroes as they assault Krona's Stronghold in #4.

Zazzala is an alien supervillain known as Queen Bee.

In her previous year (or years) on campus she had grown a large following of brainwashed thralls by giving them cocktails that transformed them into worker-bee like subjects who worshipped her. Melissa was defeated when she tried to turn Zatanna into a \"Queen Maker\" bee by feeding her magik-laced honey, only to be stopped by Zatanna's friends, who then unintentionally set The Malevolence upon her and her \"hive\". ==In other media== ===Television=== ====Live action==== * A character with similar powers named Sasha Woodman appeared in the Smallville episode \"Drone\" played by Shonda Farr and in \"Cure\" by Jovanna Huguet. She was able to control bees and used them to attack opposing candidates for student president before Clark stopped her. She was killed in the seventh season by Dr. Curtis Knox. *A character who shares some similarity with Queen Bee appears in The Flash and Arrow, portrayed by Emily Kinney. First appearing in The Flash season one episode \"All Star Team Up\", Brie Larvan was fired from her position at Mercury Labs by Tina McGee when fellow scientists Lindsay Kang and Bill Carlisle discovered that Brie intended to weaponize her project rather than use it for agricultural purposes. Growing bitter at this, Larvan plans her revenge on the three of them. She manages to kill Kang and Carlisle with robotic bees with stingers containing apitoxin, and she is nicknamed the \"Bug-Eyed Bandit\" by Cisco Ramon and Ray Palmer. Larvan's attempt to kill McGee is thwarted when Palmer uses his exo-suit to lure the bees over water to disable their circuitry. With help from Felicity Smoak, Flash then tracks Larvan to her base and captures her. Larvan returns in the Arrow season four episode \"Beacon of Hope\". Imprisoned in Iron Heights, she uses her court-sanctioned computer time to change her prison release date to March 29, 2016. Diagnosed with a tumor on her spine, one which will render her paraplegic once removed, she takes Palmer Tech's board members hostage using improved robotic bee drones to force Felicity Smoak into turning over schematics to the prototype microchip that allows her to walk after being paralyzed herself. Curtis Holt hacks the bees, commanding them to sting Larvan with the overdose of apitoxin from the stings leaving her in a coma. She is taken by SCPD and put in Starling General Hospital to be treated. Larvan returns in The Flash season five episode \"Gone Rogue\", where she teams up with Rag Doll and Weather Witch as a new version of the Rogues. After attempting to force the Flash into revealing his true identity, they are apprehended by the Flash and his team. ====Animation==== * In Justice League Unlimited, Queen Bee (apparently in her Zazzala incarnation) is seen as a background member of Gorilla Grodd's Secret Society in the third- season premiere, but she does not make a full appearance in the series. However, in the episode \"Far From Home\", Supergirl fights robotic duplicates of Zazzala and Doctor Cyber for training purposes. The \"real\" animated Queen Bee has thus far only appeared in a major role in the Justice League Unlimited comic (issue #29), in which she is the primary villain. She is defeated by the combined efforts of Animal Man and B'wana Beast. * Gail Simone has revealed that the teaser segment to her Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \"The Mask of Matches Malone!\" was supposed to feature Queen Bee as the main antagonist. However, due to issues with the runtime, the segment was shortened and rewritten to feature Poison Ivy instead. Nonetheless, a draft of the original short featuring Queen Bee was made available on Simone's message board.WAY Too Long Brave And The Bold Excerpt * The Bialyan Queen Bee appears in Young Justice voiced by Marina Sirtis. According to Greg Weisman, the Bialyan Queen Bee used in this show is the first Bialyan Queen Bee.Search Ask Greg : Gargoyles : Station Eight According to Batman, this Queen Bee possesses the ability of persuasion over most men and some women.

The next day, Rumaan Harjavti tells Queen Bee that he has changed his mind about giving up Qurac to Bialya. Queen Bee is taken away vowing to get revenge on Qurac. This was later revealed to be an act by Miss Martian (who was imitating Queen Bee to make her scheme public knowledge before she imitated Bruce Wayne to meet with Rumaan Harjavti). Miss Martian later finds Queen Bee in Garfield Logan's room and states to Miss Martian that Psimon isn't the only one who knows what Miss Martian really is and that she'd better cooperate with her if she doesn't want the rest of the team to know her true form. She also states that should any of her team attack her personally or should she command it that Garfield would physically hurt himself to protect her. In \"Usual Suspects\", Queen Bee accompanies Lex Luthor, Sportsmaster, Bane, and Blockbuster to Santa Prisca. Miss Martian is also summoned by Queen Bee.
