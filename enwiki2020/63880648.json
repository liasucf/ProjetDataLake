    "text": "Chickentown is an unincorporated community in Northampton County, Pennsylvania, United States. Chickentown is located at the junction of Hanoverville Road and Pennsylvania Route 512. The name \"Chickentown\" originated from the several poultry farms located in the area, especially those on nearby Jacksonville Road, which was previously called Chickentown Road because of the large number of poultry farms located on it. However, this name fell into obscurity sometime before the turn of the 21st century as the area became more residential. == References == Category:Unincorporated communities in Northampton County, Pennsylvania Category:Unincorporated communities in Pennsylvania ",
