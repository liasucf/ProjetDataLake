Its chief geographical features are the Owenmore River (County Cavan), mountain streams, waterfalls, a wood, gravel pits, a dug well and spring wells. The townland is traversed by the regional R200 road (Ireland), minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 398 statute acres. ==History== In earlier times the townland was probably uninhabited as it consists mainly of bog and poor clay soils. It was not seized by the English during the Plantation of Ulster in 1610 or in the Cromwellian Settlement of the 1660s so some dispossessed Irish families moved there and began to clear and farm the land. By 1720 Morley Saunders, was the owner of the townland. By deed dated 28 July 1720 the aforesaid Morley Saunders leased the townland of Carravae, whose tenant was Brian Dolan, to Richard Hassard for a term of 31 years. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as Corvagh. The Tithe Applotment Books for 1826 list seven tithepayers in the townland. Tithe Applotment Books 1826 The Ordnance Survey Name Books for 1836 give the following description of the townland- The soil is of a light gravelly nature and yields middling crops...There is an ancient fort near the north side and several middling good stone houses but there is nothing remarkable whatever.

Griffith's Valuation of 1857 lists thirty-four landholders in the townland. \\- Griffith's Valuation In the 19th century the landlord of Curraghvah was the Annesley Estate. ==Census== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Although the NW half of the site has been largely levelled, the outline of the perimeter is still identifiable. Original entrance not recognisable. Short stretch of relatively recent drystone walling on internal face of inner bank at E. A small stone-lined subcircular depression at the centre of the interior is believed to be a spring well (OPW 1977). Situated on the floor of an upland valley. # Curraghvah National School.
