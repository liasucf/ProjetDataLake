She was inducted as a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America in 2016. In July 2020 she was awarded the title of Distinguished Professor. == Education == Before beginning her graduate studies in linguistics, Green received a B.S. in English education at Grambling State University and then an M.A. in English at the University of Kentucky. Dr. Green then went on to receive a PhD in linguistics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst in 1993. Dr. Green's work has focused on linguistic variation between different dialects of English, with a primary focus on African American English. Her research focuses on morphosyntactic systems in African American English like tense and aspect marking and negation, as well as first language acquisition of AAE by child speakers.Green, Lisa, and Thomas Roeper. \u201cThe Acquisition Path for Tense- Aspect: Remote Past and Habitual in Child African American English.\u201d Language Acquisition, vol. 14, no. 3, 2007, pp. 269\u2013313.

Now, she is a Professor in Department of Linguistics at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Here, she founded and directs the Center for the Study of African American Language, a resource for students and educators dedicated to dialect and language-related issues.
