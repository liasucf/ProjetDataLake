Its chief geographical features are streams, a rocky outcrop, a dug well and spring wells, including a sulphurous spa well, which is also a Holy Well.

The townland covers 76 statute acres. ==History== In medieval times Drumod Glebe was owned by the McGovern Clan and formed part of a ballybetagh spelled (variously) Aghycloony, Aghcloone, Nacloone, Naclone and Noclone (Irish derived place name \u00c1th Chluain, meaning the \u2018Ford of the Meadow\u2019). The 1609 Baronial Map depicts the ballybetagh as Naclone. The townland was acquired by the Church of Ireland and was still owned by the local rector in the 1850s.
