When released as a single, it reached number two on the UK Singles Chart in early 1986 and peaked atop the charts of Belgium, Ireland and the Netherlands. The song was also a hit in its other versions: \"L'Amour en H\u00e9ritage\" (French), \"Come un'eredit\u00e0\" (Italian), \"La dicha del amor\" (Spanish), and \"Aber die Liebe bleibt\" (German).
