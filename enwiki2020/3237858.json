He was the candidate of the French Communist Party for the presidential election of 1958. ==Life and career== Marrane became the first Communist mayor of the northern city of Ivry in 1925. He remained in this elected position for forty years, except for the occupied period during World War II, until his retirement from politics in 1965. ==Presidential election of 1958== The election of 1958 was the first presidential contest of the French Fifth Republic. Marrane competed against the wartime hero Charles de Gaulle; a third candidate, Albert Ch\u00e2telet, represented a coalition of non-communist leftist groups. On 15 December 1958, de Gaulle swept the election, taking approximately 77% of the vote. Marrane received 13%, just a few percentage points above Ch\u00e2telet. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1976 deaths Category:People from Louviers Category:Politicians from Normandy Category:French Section of the Workers' International politicians Category:French Communist Party politicians Category:French Ministers of Health Category:French Senators of the Fourth Republic Category:Senators of Seine (department) Category:Deputies of the 3rd National Assembly of the French Fourth Republic Category:French Senators of the Fifth Republic Category:Mayors of places in \u00cele-de-France Category:Candidates for President of France Category:French Resistance members Category:Communist members of the French Resistance ",
