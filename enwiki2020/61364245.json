    "text": "The Heat\u2013Magic rivalry is an National Basketball Association (NBA) rivalry between the Miami Heat and the Orlando Magic. It is also known as the Sunshine State rivalry since both the Heat and the Magic are based in the state of Florida similar to the Lakers\u2013Clippers rivalry. ==Background== The rivalry started when two teams were expanded into the NBA, both being from Florida which made it a battle for basketball supremacy statewide. Orlando became the first team in Florida to reach the Finals in the 1990s and Miami quickly followed with a strong team of its own after Shaquille O\u2019Neal left Orlando in 1996. The two teams have met just once in the Playoffs in 1997. It was a surprising five-game series that saw Anfernee Hardaway put in two of the best individual playoff games in team history with back-to-back 40-point performances. The Heat were the better team and prevailed in the decisive fifth game. ==2010\u20132012: Arrival of LeBron James== In the off season the Heat made headlines nearly every day after it was announced that LeBron James would sign with the club as a free agent. Other teams in the NBA felt slight and overwhelmed by the amount of coverage the Heat were given. Magic head coach Stan Van Gundy was one of the people that noticed the \u201cextra\u201d coverage the Heat had received. Earlier in the year of 2010 at a press conference, Van Gundy stated: \u201cI\u2019m surprised there was enough media left for you guys to get here. ESPN is all Heat, all the time.\u201d The players got involved as well. Marcin Gortat said \u201cHonestly, I\u2019m sick of listening every hour about Miami\u2014Miami that, how great they are, how big they are, what kind of record they gonna have.\u201d Dwight Howard chimed in by simply stating \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take their heads off.\u201d Even upper management got involved in the verbal feud. Otis Smith, the president of basketball operations for the Orlando Magic was discussing LeBron going to Miami and had this to say: \"I was surprised that he went. I thought he was, I guess, more of a competitor.\u201d Eventually LeBron responded to this comment regarding his competitiveness. \u201cOrlando, that\u2019s funny that they questioned my competitiveness. I like that. The locker room\u2014we\u2019re going to put a lot of stuff in the locker room...We'll deal with them later.\" Orlando Magic vs. Miami Heat: Is This the Best Rivalry in the NBA?, Bleacher Report.
