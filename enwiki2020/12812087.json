Ediz Hook, a level sand spit extending from the mainland north and east into the Strait of Juan de Fuca, was declared a Federal Lighthouse Reservation by President Lincoln in 1863. The first lighthouse was commissioned on 1 April 1865. The Air Station was commissioned on 1 June 1935, becoming the first permanent Coast Guard Air Station on the Pacific Coast. Its location was chosen for its strategic position for coastal defense of the Northwest. The first aircraft, a Douglas RD-4 amphibian, arrived 11 June 1935 and flew the first \"mercy hop\" on August 1935. The 75-foot patrol boats were also stationed at the new unit. During World War II, the Air Station expanded to include a gunnery school, training aerial gunners and local defense forces. A short runway was added to train Navy pilots for carrier landings. It also hosted independent units such as Naval Intelligence and was Headquarters of the Air Sea Rescue System for the Northwest Sea Frontier Area. By the end of 1944, the Air Station had 29 aircraft assigned. In September 1944 the station officially became Coast Guard Group Port Angeles, with several sub-units including the Air Station, Station Bellingham, Station Neah Bay, Station Port Angeles, Station Quillayute River, USCGC ADELIE, USCGC BLUE SHARK, USCGC CUTTYHUNK, USCGC OSPREY, USCGC SEA LION, USCGC SWORDFISH, USCGC TERRAPIN, and USCGC WAHOO. In 1946, the first helicopter, a Sikorsky HO3S-1G arrived. This was replaced in 1951 with the Sikorsky HO4S helicopter (the \"Eggbeater\"). The last fixed wing aircraft, the Grumman HU-16E Albatross (the \"Goat\") was retired in 1973. Since then the Air Station has been home to helicopters only, starting with the HH-52A Seaguard, first acquired in 1965. The HH-52A was replaced in 1988 with the new American Eurocopter HH-65A Dolphin twin turbine helicopter. During a typical year, Group Port Angeles units carry out over 400 search and rescue missions, saving 35 lives and assisting 500 persons. Each year, property valued at over $2 million is saved. Coast Guard Group and Air Station Port Angeles continues its untiring vigil, true to the Coast Guards motto \"Semper Paratus\" ( Always Ready ). On 30 JUL 2010, Group/Air Station Port Angeles was reorganized into Air Station / Sector Field Office Port Angeles. The Sector Field Office logistically supports Station Neah Bay, Station Port Angeles, Station Quillayute River, , USCGC ADELIE, USCGC CUTTYHUNK, USCGC OSPREY, USCGC SWORDFISH, and USCGC WAHOO. ==Operational area== Strait of Juan de Fuca and the surrounding region Air Station Port Angeles is the US Coast Guard's oldest operational air station, in operation since 1935 and today supports three MH-65D Dolphin helicopters, which have been operating at the station since 1984.
