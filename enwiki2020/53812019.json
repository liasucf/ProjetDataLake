    "text": "The 2018 NCAA Division I FBS football season was the highest level college football competition in the United States organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) in 2018. The regular season began on August 25, 2018 and ended on December 8, 2018. The postseason concluded on January 7, 2019 with the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. The Clemson Tigers won the title game over the Alabama Crimson Tide, the school's third national title and second in three years. ==Rule changes== ===Game rules=== The following rule changes were approved by the NCAA Playing Rules Oversight Panel for the 2018 season: * Allow players to fair catch the ball inside the 25 yard line on a kickoff and be awarded a touchback, placing the ball at the 25 yard line. * Offensive players cannot block below the waist more than five yards past the line of scrimmage and, with the exception of interior linemen, all blocks below the waist must be from the front. * The play clock will be set to 40 seconds between a touchdown and the PAT or two-point conversion and after a kickoff. * Mirroring the NFL rule adopted in the 2010 season, a 10-second runoff will be applied within the final minute of each half if a replay review overturns the call on the field, and the correct ruling would not have stopped the game clock. As with any other 10 second runoff, teams can take a time out (if available) to avoid the runoff. * Extending the \"no leaping\" rule on PATs and field goals adopted in the 2017 season to include the \"shield\" on a punt. * Allowing penalties incurred on successful field goals to be enforced on the ensuing kickoff, which matches the rule for successful extra point attempts. * Continuing the experiment of a collaborative instant replay decision making model not confined to the press box. ===Eligibility rules=== Major changes to redshirt rules in Division I football (both FBS and FCS) took effect from this season forward after having been approved by the NCAA Division I Council on June 13, 2018. Players can now participate in as many as four games in a season while still retaining redshirt status. This new rule does not apply to players who enroll at a school midyear and participate in postseason competition taking place during or before their first academic term at that school. ==Conference realignment== ===Membership changes=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !School !Former conference !New conference |- | Idaho Vandals | Sun Belt | Big Sky (FCS) |- | New Mexico State Aggies | Sun Belt | FBS independent |- | Liberty Flames | Big South (FCS) | FBS independent |} New Mexico State left the Sun Belt Conference following the 2017 season and will compete as an FBS independent. Idaho also left the Sun Belt, dropping its football program from the FBS to FCS level, where it will compete in the Big Sky Conference. Liberty began a two-year transition from FCS in 2017. The Flames will be counted as an FBS independent for scheduling purposes in 2018, but will not be fully bowl-eligible until the 2019 season. However, they may participate in a bowl in 2018 if they have at least six eligible wins and there are not enough bowl-eligible teams to fill all the spots. ==Other headlines== * July 13 \u2013 Following reports that Papa John's Pizza founder John Schnatter had said the \"n-word\" in an internal conference call, which led to his resignation both as company chairman and member of the University of Louisville board of trustees, University president Neeli Bendapudi announced that the company's name would be removed from the Cardinal Stadium name effective immediately. * August 1 \u2013 Ohio State administrators placed head coach Urban Meyer on paid administrative leave while the school announced it was launching an investigation into claims that Meyer knew of former assistant coach Zach Smith's involvement in a 2015 domestic violence incident against his ex-wife Courtney Smith. Zach Smith had been fired on July 23 after the allegations were made public. **August 22 \u2013 Following the investigation, Ohio State announced that Meyer would be suspended for the first three games of the 2018 season. In addition, athletic director Gene Smith was suspended from August 31 to September 16. * August 11 \u2013 Maryland placed head coach D. J. Durkin on paid administrative leave during the school's investigation into the death of player Jordan McNair from heatstroke following an offseason practice, in addition to allegations of abuse and disparagement by coaches within the program. This announcement came the day after the school had placed two trainers and the team's strength coach on administrative leave. ** August 14 \u2013 Maryland president Wallace Loh announced that the school \"accepts legal and moral responsibility for the mistakes\" that led to McNair's death. The university also parted ways with Rick Court, the strength coach widely blamed for establishing the alleged culture of abuse revealed in recent news reports. Court had resigned the previous day, and reached a financial settlement with the university shortly before Loh made his announcement. ** October 31 \u2013 A day after Durkin was reinstated as head coach after the completion of the school's probe, resulting in widespread outrage among state politicians, students, faculty, and members of McNair's family, Loh fired Durkin. Matt Canada, who had been named the interim head coach following Durkin's original suspension, continued in that role for the remainder of the season. * September 8 \u2013 Two of the longest futility streaks of their types in FBS history ended: ** First, in an afternoon game in Mount Pleasant, Michigan, Kansas defeated Central Michigan 31\u20137, ending the longest road losing streak in FBS history at 46 games. The only longer such streak in college football history was the 48-game streak of FCS Idaho State, which ended in 2014. ** In a night game, Kentucky defeated Florida 27\u201316 for the Wildcats' first win over the Gators since 1986 and ending the longest current losing streak in an uninterrupted series at 31 games. This streak was the fourth-longest of its type in NCAA history. This also marked Kentucky's first win in Gainesville since 1979. * October 28 \u2013 Following a weekend in which eight teams ranked in the AP Poll lost to unranked teams\u2014the most since that poll expanded to a Top 25 format in 1989\u2014seven new teams entered the poll for Week 10, the most in the Top 25 era. * November 24 ** The LSU\u2013Texas A&M; game, played at Kyle Field in College Station, Texas, went to seven overtimes and lasted nearly five hours, tying the NCAA record for longest football game with four others. The Aggies slipped past the Tigers 74 - 72. The 146 combined points are currently the second most in college football history since the NCAA started keeping records in 1937, behind the 161 points scored in a 2008 NCAA Division II game between Abilene Christian and West Texas A&M; of the Lone Star Conference. ** In addition, two notable postseason results were for all intents and purposes confirmed: *** Florida State's loss to rival Florida 41\u201314 ended the program's Division I FBS-leading streak of 36 consecutive appearances in a postseason bowl game, as the team finished 5\u20137, and failed to reach bowl eligibility. *** Notre Dame's win over rival USC 24-17 resulted in the Fighting Irish completing their first undefeated regular season since 2012. This, combined with their lack of a conference title game, resulted in many sports media declaring that Notre Dame was guaranteed to qualify for the College Football Playoff. * December 15 \u2013 Georgia Southern completed its season in the Camellia Bowl with a new FBS record for fewest turnovers lost in a season, with five. The previous record of eight had been accomplished by six teams, most recently by LSU in 2017. * December 20 \u2013 In a more ignominious milestone, South Florida ended its season in the Gasparilla Bowl with a 38\u201320 loss to Marshall, becoming the first FBS team ever to finish a season 7\u20136 after a 7\u20130 start. * December 22 \u2013 Army tied two records for all Division I bowl games in its 70\u201314 blowout of Houston in the Armed Forces Bowl. The 70 points equaled West Virginia's output against Clemson in the 2012 Orange Bowl (70\u201333), and the victory margin equaled that of Tulsa against Bowling Green in the 2008 GMAC Bowl (63\u20137). It was also the first time since 1955 that the Black Knights had scored 70 points in a game, and capped off the team's first-ever 11-win season. * December 27 \u2013 In its 63\u201314 blowout of Purdue in the Music City Bowl, Auburn led 56\u20137 at halftime, setting a new record for points scored by a single team in any half of a bowl game. The previous record had been held by West Virginia, which scored 49 points in the first half of the 2012 Orange Bowl. ==Updated stadiums== *Arizona State completed its four-phase renovation of Sun Devil Stadium. The fourth and final phase includes reconstruction of the east sideline. The capacity is now 55,000, down from 71,706 just prior to the renovation. *Arkansas debuted its $160 million expansion of the north end zone of Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium. The expansion added 4,800 seats and new premium seating to the north end zone, boosting the capacity of the stadium to 80,800. *Georgia debuted its $63 million new west end zone project at Sanford Stadium, which relocates the locker room from the east side to the west side, as well as the addition of a new plaza and recruiting pavilion. The project increased the stadium's capacity by 500 seats. *Indiana debuted its $50 million south end zone complex at Memorial Stadium. The project includes a new rehabilitation and treatment facility for athletes, additional academic and life skills support facilities, a multi-use outdoor terrace on the roof of the structure, and an entry plaza and green space at the south end of the stadium. A new 42 x 91.3 ft. video board was installed for the 2018 season in the completed south end zone. *Iowa is currently rebuilding the north end zone of Kinnick Stadium. The $89.9 million upgrade will feature the addition of box seating, outdoor club seating and a new scoreboard. Some seating opened for the 2018 season, while the entire project is scheduled to be complete in 2019. * Liberty completed an expansion of Williams Stadium during the 2018 season. The capacity was increased from 19,200 to 25,000 in time for the Flames' FBS debut, while construction on a new press box continued until midseason. *Louisville debuted an expansion of the venue now known as Cardinal Stadium, specifically the filling in of the north end zone. Two new video scoreboards were also installed. While Louisville had long publicized this expansion project as adding 10,000 seats, bringing the capacity to 65,000, it acknowledged in February 2018 that the final capacity would instead be about 61,000. ===Renamed stadiums=== Colorado State announced on April 19, 2018 that an area financial institution, Public Service Credit Union, had paid $37.7 million over 15 years to place its name on the venue then known as Colorado State Stadium. The new stadium name was not revealed at that time because PSCU was in the process of changing its name, with the new name expected to be announced in June 2018. The deal did not affect the playing surface, which continues to be named after former Rams head coach Sonny Lubick. On June 5, the former PSCU announced its new name of Canvas Credit Union, with the CSU venue becoming Canvas Stadium. Kansas renamed their stadium to David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium in honor of alumnus David Booth who donated $50 million to the school for renovations to the stadium. As noted above, Louisville removed the Papa John's name from Cardinal Stadium in the wake of the controversy over founder John Schnatter. ==Kickoff games== ===\"Week Zero\"=== The regular season began with four Week 0 games on Saturday, August 25: * UMass defeated Duquesne, 63\u201315 * Rice defeated Prairie View A&M;, 31\u201328 *Hawaii defeated Colorado State, 43\u201334, in the only in-conference matchup of the week * Wyoming defeated New Mexico State, 29\u20137 ===Week 1=== The vast majority of FBS teams opened the season on Labor Day weekend. Five neutral- site \"kickoff\" games were held (rankings reflect the Week 1 AP Poll): *Texas Kickoff (NRG Stadium, Houston): Ole Miss defeated Texas Tech, 47\u201327 *Chick- fil-A Kickoff Game (Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta): #9 Auburn defeated #6 Washington, 21\u201316 *Belk Kickoff Game (Bank of America Stadium, Charlotte): #17 West Virginia defeated Tennessee, 40\u201314 *Camping World Kickoff (Camping World Stadium, Orlando): #1 Alabama defeated Louisville, 51\u201314 *Advocare Classic (AT&T; Stadium, Arlington): #25 LSU defeated #8 Miami, 33\u201317 ==Regular season top 10 matchups== Rankings reflect the AP Poll. Rankings for Week 10 and beyond will list College Football Playoff Rankings first and AP Poll second. Teams that fail to be a top 10 team for one poll or the other will be noted. *Week 1 **No. 9 Auburn defeated No. 6 Washington, 21\u201316 (Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GA) *Week 5 **No. 4 Ohio State defeated No. 9 Penn State, 27\u201326 (Beaver Stadium, University Park, PA) **No. 8 Notre Dame defeated No. 7 Stanford, 38\u201317 (Notre Dame Stadium, South Bend, IN) *Week 9 **No. 7 Georgia defeated No. 9 Florida, 36\u201317 (TIAA Bank Field, Jacksonville, FL) *Week 10 ** No. 1/1 Alabama defeated No. 3/4 LSU, 29\u20130 (Tiger Stadium, Baton Rouge, LA) ** No. 6/6 Georgia defeated No. 9/11 Kentucky, 34\u201317 (Kroger Field, Lexington, KY) *Week 13 ** No. 10/10 Ohio State defeated No. 4/4 Michigan, 62\u201339 (Ohio Stadium, Columbus, OH) *Week 14 ** No. 1/1 Alabama defeated No. 4/4 Georgia, 35\u201328 (2018 SEC Championship Game, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, Atlanta, GA) ==Cancelled and rescheduled games== ===Week 1=== Two games were cancelled due to thunderstorms: *South Dakota State at Iowa State *Akron at Nebraska Three of these four teams later found replacement games to fill out their schedule. ===Week 3=== Five games were cancelled due to Hurricane Florence: *No. 14 West Virginia at NC State *No. 18 UCF at North Carolina *East Carolina at No. 13 Virginia Tech *Marshall at South Carolina *Southern Miss at Appalachian State Five of the ten teams that lost games due to Florence scheduled tentative replacement games for Week 14, which is normally reserved for conference championship games. Four games were moved forward in anticipation of Florence: *Old Dominion at Charlotte moved to 4:00 p.m. ET on Thursday, September 13 *Boston College at Wake Forest moved to 5:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, September 13 *Middle Tennessee at No. 3 Georgia moved to 12:00 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 15 *Georgia Southern at No. 2 Clemson moved to 12:00 p.m. ET on Saturday, September 15 One game was moved forward and to the visiting team's stadium in anticipation of Florence: *Campbell at Coastal Carolina was moved from CCU's Brooks Stadium to Campbell's Barker-Lane Stadium, and the kickoff was moved to 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday, September 12 One game was moved to a neutral site in anticipation of Florence: * Ohio vs Virginia was moved to Vanderbilt Stadium in Nashville, Tennessee One game was rescheduled in anticipation of Florence: * Norfolk State at Liberty moved to Saturday, December 1 ===Week 9=== * Bethune-Cookman vs. Nebraska at Memorial Stadium. Scheduled after Nebraska cancelled their Week 1 game vs. Akron due to inclement weather. ===Week 12=== *The Big Game between Cal and Stanford, originally scheduled for Saturday, November 17, was postponed to Saturday, December 1 due to the Camp Fire in Northern California. ===Week 14=== Normally reserved for conference championship games, several games were added to the schedule to replace earlier, cancelled games. All of these games were contingent upon both teams being available. *After both teams cancelled games due to Hurricane Florence, NC State and ECU agreed to schedule a new game against each other on December 1 at 12:00 EST at Carter Finley Stadium, and will officially serve as a home game for NC State. The meeting was contingent on neither team qualifying for its respective conference championship game, both of which were scheduled for that same weekend, but was confirmed once both teams were eliminated from contention for their title games. Events were held at the game to raise money to support victims of Hurricane Florence. *Iowa State announced on October 1 that it had scheduled a game against FCS opponent Incarnate Word as a replacement for their cancelled Week 1 game. The game was contingent upon both teams being available for the December 1 match- up at Jack Trice Stadium. On November 19, Incarnate Word accepted a bid to the FCS playoffs, if Incarnate Word were to win that game, Iowa State would be left without an opponent, again. Therefore, on November 20, Iowa State announced that they had cancelled the game with Incarnate Word and scheduled a game with Drake for the same date and location. *South Carolina scheduled a game against Akron on December 1 at Williams-Brice Stadium to replace games each team lost due to weather events. The game was scheduled as a twelfth game on November 2, 2018 as soon as it was clear that neither team was going to qualify for their conference championship, freeing them up for week 14. *On November 18, 2018, it was announced that Virginia Tech and Marshall scheduled a game for December 1 at Lane Stadium to make up for games lost due to Hurricane Florence. The game was contingent upon one or both teams needing the win to earn bowl eligibility. As of the announcement, Marshall was already bowl eligible, but Virginia Tech needed two more wins in their final two games (including the tentative Marshall game) to become bowl-eligible. The game was confirmed once Tech defeated Virginia during Week 13. ===Postseason=== The 2018 First Responder Bowl on December 26 between Boston College and Boise State was canceled after severe weather hit the Dallas area. The game was stopped due to lightning in the area shortly after BC had taken a 7\u20130 lead in the first quarter, and was canceled about 90 minutes later. Lightning continued in the vicinity of the stadium for an additional 90 minutes, and further severe weather was expected for later that night. According to an NCAA spokesperson, this was believed to be the first bowl game ever called off due to weather conditions. ==Conference standings== {| cellpadding=\"5\" |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |- |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |- |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |- |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |valign=\"top\" width=25em| |} ==Conference summaries== Rankings reflect the Week 14 AP Poll before the conference championship games were played. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Conference !Champion !Runner-up !Score !Offensive Player of the Year !Defensive Player of the Year !Coach of the Year |- |ACC | #2 ClemsonCFP |Pittsburgh | 42\u201310 |Travis Etienne (Clemson) |Clelin Ferrell (Clemson) |Dabo Swinney (Clemson) |- |American | #7 UCF |Memphis | 56\u201341 |McKenzie Milton (UCF) | Nate Harvey (East Carolina) |Luke Fickell (Cincinnati) |- |Big 12 | #5 OklahomaCFP | #9 Texas | 39\u201327 |Kyler Murray (Oklahoma) |David Long Jr. (West Virginia) |Lincoln Riley (Oklahoma) Matt Campbell (Iowa State) |- |Big Ten | #6 Ohio State | #21 Northwestern | 45\u201324 |Dwayne Haskins (Ohio State) |Devin Bush Jr. (Michigan) |Pat Fitzgerald (Northwestern) |- |C\u2013USA |UAB |Middle Tennessee | 27\u201325 | Mason Fine (North Texas) |Jaylon Ferguson (Louisiana Tech) |Rick Stockstill (Middle Tennessee) |- |MAC |Northern Illinois |Buffalo | 30\u201329 |Tyree Jackson (Buffalo) |Sutton Smith (Northern Illinois) |Lance Leipold (Buffalo) |- |MW | #25 Fresno State | #19 Boise State | |Brett Rypien (Boise State) | Jeff Allison (Fresno State) |Matt Wells (Utah State) |- |Pac-12 | #10 Washington | #17 Utah | 10\u20133 |Gardner Minshew (Washington State) |Ben Burr-Kirven (Washington) |Mike Leach (Washington State) |- |SEC | #1 AlabamaCFP | #4 Georgia | 35\u201328 |Tua Tagovailoa (Alabama) |Josh Allen (Kentucky) |Mark Stoops (Kentucky) |- |Sun Belt |Appalachian State |Louisiana | 30\u201319 | Zac Thomas (Appalachian State) | Ronheen Bingham (Arkansas State) |Scott Satterfield (Appalachian State) |} CFP College Football Playoff participant ==Postseason== ===Bowl selections=== There were 39 team-competitive post-season bowl games, with two teams advancing to a 40th - the CFP National Championship game. Normally, a team is required to have a .500 minimum winning percentage during the regular season to become bowl-eligible (six wins for an 11- or 12-game schedule, and seven wins for a 13-game schedule). If there are not enough winning teams to fulfill all open bowl slots, teams with losing records may be chosen to fill all 78 bowl slots. Additionally, on the rare occasion in which a conference champion does not meet eligibility requirements, they are usually still chosen for bowl games via tie-ins for their conference. ====Bowl\u2013eligible teams==== *ACC (11): Boston College, Clemson, Duke, Georgia Tech, Miami, NC State, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Virginia, Virginia Tech, Wake Forest *American (7): Cincinnati, Houston, Memphis, South Florida, Temple, Tulane, UCF *Big Ten (9): Iowa, Michigan, Michigan State, Minnesota, Northwestern, Ohio State, Penn State, Purdue, Wisconsin *Big 12 (7): Baylor, Iowa State, Oklahoma, Oklahoma State, TCU, Texas, West Virginia *C-USA (7): FIU, Louisiana Tech, Marshall, Middle Tennessee, North Texas, Southern Miss, UAB *Independent (3): Army, BYU, Notre Dame *MAC (7): Buffalo, Eastern Michigan, Miami (OH), Northern Illinois, Ohio, Toledo, Western Michigan *Mountain West (7): Boise State, Fresno State, Hawaii, Nevada, San Diego State, Utah State, Wyoming *Pac-12 (7): Arizona State, California, Oregon, Stanford, Utah, Washington, Washington State *SEC (11): Alabama, Auburn, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, LSU, Mississippi State, Missouri, South Carolina, Texas A&M;, Vanderbilt *Sun Belt (6): Appalachian State, Arkansas State, Georgia Southern, Louisiana, Louisiana\u2013Monroe, Troy Number of bowl berths available: 78 Number of bowl-eligible teams: 82 ====Bowl-eligible teams that were not invited==== *C-USA (1): Southern Miss (6\u20135) *MAC (1): Miami (Ohio) (6\u20136) *Mountain West (1): Wyoming (6\u20136) *Sun Belt (1): Louisiana\u2013Monroe (6\u20136) ====Bowl\u2013ineligible teams==== *American (5): Connecticut, East Carolina, Navy, Tulsa, SMU *ACC (3): Florida State, Louisville, North Carolina *Big Ten (5): Illinois, Indiana, Maryland, Nebraska, Rutgers *Big 12 (3): Kansas, Kansas State, Texas Tech *C-USA (7): Charlotte, Florida Atlantic, Old Dominion, Rice, UTEP, UTSA, Western Kentucky *Independent (3): Liberty*, New Mexico State, UMass *MAC (5): Akron, Ball State, Bowling Green, Central Michigan, Kent State *Mountain West (5): Air Force, Colorado State, New Mexico, San Jose State, UNLV *Pac-12 (5): Arizona, Colorado, Oregon State, UCLA, USC *SEC (3): Arkansas, Ole Miss**, Tennessee *Sun Belt (4): Coastal Carolina, Georgia State, South Alabama, Texas State Number of bowl-ineligible teams: 48 * Liberty was not bowl-eligible until 2019 due to their transition from FCS to FBS. If Liberty had at least six wins and there were not enough bowl-eligible teams, they could have requested an NCAA waiver to participate in a bowl; Liberty did reach six wins, but there were more than enough bowl-eligible teams to fill the available bids. ** Ole Miss, who finished their regular season with a 5\u20137 record, was under a self-imposed two-year bowl ban that applied for the 2017 and 2018 seasons. ===College Football Playoff=== Since the 2014\u201315 postseason, six College Football Playoff (CFP) bowl games have hosted two semifinal playoff games on a rotating basis. For this season, the Cotton Bowl and the Orange Bowl hosted the semifinal games, with the winners advancing to the 2019 College Football Playoff National Championship at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California. ===Conference performance in bowl games=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
