    "text": "The Brick Testament is a project created by Elbe Spurling in which Bible stories are illustrated using still photographs of dioramas constructed entirely out of Lego bricks. The project began as a website in October 2001 that featured six stories from the Book of Genesis, and is completely unaffiliated with the Lego company. There is also a Brick Testament book series.Brick Testament on Amazon.com Throughout stories are retold using passages from the Bible, with chapter and verse cited, the wording being a free adaptation that Spurling says is based on a number of public domain Bible translations.Spurling has stated the rationale for updated wording of TBT is to avoid copyright issues. Occasionally, mostly when images are being used to contrast with the underlying scripture, Spurling dramatises the images with additional text. Such text is displayed in gray instead of the usual black. ==Authorial commentary== Spurling's own commentary occasionally appears in illustrations and is displayed in gray text, and also as original titles for the stories themselves. A Rolling Stone article that is included as a link in the Brick Testament web site suggests that Spurling is an atheist.Excerpt from Rolling Stone Magazine article about the Brick Testament, In 2015 Spurling announced on Facebook that she was an atheist, a transgender woman, and a lesbian, and had legally changed her name to Elbe Spurling but would likely retain her birth name, Brendan Powell Smith, for her books. Her author page at Amazon.com is listed under \"Brendan Powell Smith.\"https://www.amazon.com/Brendan-Powell-Smith/e/B001K7RTV0/ref ==Lego techniques== \"The Last Supper\" from The Brick Testament website, based on Da Vinci's picture The dioramas seen in The Brick Testament are created from Spurling's personal Lego collection. The pieces come from hundreds of Lego sets dating from the 1960s to the present. In the few instances where alterations are made to Lego elements, they are generally simple changes made with a hobby knife or permanent ink marker. An example alteration is God's hair: Spurling made God's white hair by carving a white helmet piece (found on Peeron). The only completely non-Lego part of Spurling's scenes is the background sky.Brick Testament FAQ All of Spurling's images are digital. Spurling photographed early scenes with a Nikon Coolpix 950. She now uses a Nikon Coolpix 4500. After photographing the scenes, she adds speech balloons and sometimes makes alterations using image editing software. ==Media== ===Website=== The Brick Testament websiteThe Brick Testament website began in October 2001.

The stated goal of the project is \"to make these teachings better known to the world. It is designed to capture the interest of non-Mormons curious to know what the LDS Church teaches, as well as believing Mormons looking for a fun new way to learn and share the history and teachings of their church. This project is currently in the RESEARCH PHASE in which I have been spending many months immersing myself in the scriptures and teaching manuals of the LDS Church and taking hundreds and hundreds of pages of notes. In the next phase, all these notes will be worked into a manuscript. From there the illustration phase will begin. It is not yet determined whether The Brick Book of Mormon will first be published as a book (like The Brick Chronicle series) or whether it will publish first to the web and then go to print (like The Brick Bible).\" The project was officially launched on February 6, 2017. ==See also== * Biblia Pauperum *The Action Bible ==Notes and references== ==External links== *The Brick Testament *Elbe Spurling *Alexa.com statistics Category:Lego Category:Cultural depictions of Adam and Eve Category:Biblical comics ",
