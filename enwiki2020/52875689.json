Kansas topped the team standings, finishing eight-and-a-half points ahead of defending champions Villanova; it was the Jayhawks' second indoor team title. ==Qualification== Unlike other NCAA-sponsored sports, there were not separate University Division and College Division championships for indoor track and field until 1985. As such, all athletes and teams from University and College Division programs were eligible to compete. == Team standings == * Note: Top 10 only * (DC) = Defending Champions * Full results {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Rank !
