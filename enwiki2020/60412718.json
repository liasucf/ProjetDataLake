    "text": "Allan Hills 77005 (also known as Allan Hills A77005, ALHA77005, ALH77005 and ALH-77005) is a Martian meteorite that was found in the Allan Hills of Antarctica in 1977 by a Japanese National Institute of Polar Research mission team and ANSMET. Like other members of the group of SNCs (shergottite, nakhlite, chassignite), ALH-77005 is thought to be from Mars. ==Description== On discovery, the mass of ALH-77005 was . Initial geological examination determined that the meteorite was composed of ~55% olivine, ~35% pyroxene, ~8% maskelynite and ~2% opaques. In March 2019, researchers reported the possibility of biosignatures in this Martian meteorite based on its microtexture and morphology as detected with optical microscopy and FTIR-ATR microscopy, and on the detection of mineralized organic compounds, suggesting that microbial life could have existed on the planet Mars. More broadly, and as a result of their studies, the researchers suggest Solar System materials should be carefully studied to determine whether there may be signs of microbial forms within other space rocks as well. == See also == * ALH 84001 * Glossary of meteoritics * History of Mars observation * Life on Mars * List of Martian meteorites on Earth * List of meteorites on Mars * Nakhla meteorite * Mars sample return mission * Panspermia * Shergotty meteorite * Water on Mars == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * Meteoritical Society * The British and Irish Meteorite Society * The Natural History Museum's meteorite catalogue database Category:Astrobiology Category:Astronomy in the Antarctic Category:Extraterrestrial life Category:Martian meteorites Category:Meteorites found in Antarctica Category:Natural history of Antarctica ",
