    "text": "El Sur (\"The South\") is a 1983 drama film directed by the Spanish filmmaker Victor Erice, produced by Elias Querejeta, starring Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn as the adult title character. Written by Jose Luis Lopez Linares, it is based on Adelaida Garc\u00eda Morales' short novel of the same name. As in the novella, the screenplay takes place solely in the north of Spain, however the novella picks up where the screenplay leaves off, taking Estrella on a journey to the south of Spain. Producer El\u00edas Querejeta decided not to allow the filming of the latter 90 minutes which would have been filmed in the south. Querejeta contributed it to lack of funds, although neither Erice nor the film's cinematographer, Jos\u00e9 Luis Alcaine, believed that was the reason. Erice felt the film was incomplete and described it as an \"unfinished drama\" even though it was well received by critics. ==Plot== This film tells the story of a young girl named Estrella (Sonsoles Aranguren), living in the north of Spain with her father, Augustin (Omero Antonutti), and her mother, Julia (Lola Cardona). Her father is a scientist who seemingly has the ability to divine water using a pendulum, but Estrella finds him mysterious. As she's growing up her father shares with her the art of divination, but does not talk about his own childhood. Her grandmother comes to visit, and she learns that during the Spanish Civil War her father and grandfather had a falling out. Her grandfather supported Franco, but her father was a Republican. After the civil war her father vowed he would never return to the south again. Later she sees her father visit a movie theater, then eventually discovers that the films he patronizes all star an actress by the name of Irene Rios (Aurore Cl\u00e9ment). She later finds out that Rios was her father's sweetheart in the south, and that he is still in love with her. ==Cast== * Omero Antonutti - Agust\u00edn Arenas * Sonsoles Aranguren - Estrella, 8 years ** Ic\u00edar Bolla\u00edn - Estrella, 15 years * Aurore Cl\u00e9ment - Irene R\u00edos / Laura * Lola Cardona - Julia, Agust\u00edn's wife * Rafaela Aparicio - Milagros * Francisco Merino - Irene R\u00edos's Co-Star * Maria Caro - Casilda * Jos\u00e9 Viv\u00f3 - Grand Hotel barman * Germaine Montero - Do\u00f1a Rosario * Jos\u00e9 Luis Fern\u00e1ndez, El Pirri - El Carioco ==Reception== The film was entered into the 1983 Cannes Film Festival.
