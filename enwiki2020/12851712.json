    "text": "Achyranthes atollensis (also called atoll achyranthes or Hawaii chaff flower) was a species of plant in the family Amaranthaceae. It was endemic to the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands of Kure, Midway, Laysan and the Pearl and Hermes Atoll. Its natural habitat was sandy shores. It became extinct due to habitat loss (residential, commercial and military installation development) and the introduction of non-native species, and was last seen in 1964. It was a perennial shrub living in dry shrublands on calcareous sand and atolls. ==See also== *List of species of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands ==References== ==External links== *HEAR.org Risk project: Achyranthes atollensis information *HEAR.org Risk project: Hawaiian Ecosystems website atollensis Category:Endemic flora of Hawaii Category:Extinct flora of Hawaii Category:Natural history of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Category:Plant extinctions since 1500 Category:Species endangered by habitat loss Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Plants described in 1980 ",
