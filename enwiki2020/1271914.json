It has business in shopping centres, housing estates, industrial estates and retirement villages. ==History== Stockland was founded in 1952 by Albert Scheinberg and Ervin Graf, with a vision to \u201cnot merely achieve growth and profits but to make a worthwhile contribution to the development of our cities and great country\u201d. In 1957 Stockland listed on the Australian Stock Exchange by acquiring a controlling interest in Simon Hickey Industries Ltd, the smallest company then listed. In the same year, Stockland's activities became more diversified, moving into commercial development, initially with retail projects in suburbs of Sydney. In 1965 Stockland opened its first big commercial development - the redeveloped Imperial Arcade in Sydney's CBD, which offered the first underground link to David Jones, four retail levels and six levels of office space. Its current activities include: * management of shopping centres, 41 centres valued at $5 billion across Australia. * development of 65 residential communities with end-market value of approximately $21.2 billion. * ownership and management of 16 offices in Australian capital cities * 13 distribution and industrial centres * 62 established retirement living villages.
