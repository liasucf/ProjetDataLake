I don't care about philosophies or trends. I don't care about vocabulary. What is important to me is whether the narrative is good or not. My protagonists are experiencing what I experience as I write, which is also what the readers experience as they read. In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, writers offered the real thing; that was their task. In War and Peace, Tolstoy describes the battleground so closely that the readers believe it\u2019s the real thing. But that is not my aim. I'm not pretending it\u2019s the real thing. We are living in a fake world; we are fighting a fake war, the existing social order is a swindle and its cherished beliefs are mostly delusions. But we still manage to find reality in all of these\", Jay mentioned in one of her interviews with Alan Jacob.
