By the 1930s it was publishing five days a week. In 1934, then-U.S. Senator Huey Pierce Long, Jr. had seven staff members expelled for publishing an anti-Long letter to the editor and refusing to accept faculty censorship. The students, now commonly referred to as the \"Reveille Seven,\" were Carl Corbin, Samuel Montague, Stan Shlosman, Cal Abraham, Jesse Cutrer, L. Rea Godbold, and David McGuire.Reveille Rebels: Reveille Seven\u2019s clash with Huey P.

Ourso, for whom LSU's College of Business Administration is named, the political consultant Raymond Strother, political journalist and author John Maginnis, and Robert E.
