This works also marks the end of the second stage of Rabindranath Tagore's poetic career. == Theme == In this book the poet celebrated the nature and joyousness of the world. He also resvisited his childhood. Tagore explained: \"At last one day, I do not know how, the bolted door was broken open and I got back what I had lost. I did not merely get it back but through the barrier of separation, got a fuller idea of it. That is why I got much mom when in the Prabhat Sangeet, I got back the world of my childhood. Thus easy access to nature followed by separation and reunion marked the end of an episode in the first chapter of my life.\" == References == Category:Poetry collections by Rabindranath Tagore Category:Bengali_poetry Category:1883_poems Category:1883 books ",
