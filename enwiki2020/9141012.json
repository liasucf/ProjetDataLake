    "text": "250px In the Philippines, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was the only autonomous region (until it was superseded by Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao); as such it is the sole region with a regional government as prescribed by the Constitution of the Philippines. In 2001, Republic Act No. 9054 was passed for the expansion of the ARMM to include the areas which initially rejected inclusion and the provinces which were carved from them. However, only Marawi City and Basilan, with the exception of Isabela City, opted to be integrated in the region. A special plebiscite was set on August 14, 2001. ==Results== ===Rules=== Each province, and their component cities, has their own separate plebiscite. In order for the plebiscite to be approved, a majority of the people who voted is needed, if it fails to surpass the majority of valid votes, the plebiscite is defeated in that province or city. *For provinces voted for expansion and amendments to the original organic act: **If a majority did not vote in favor, all amendments to the organic act, save for provinces and cities that voted for inclusion, are rejected. *For provinces and cities voting for inclusion: **If a majority in each city or province votes in favor, it becomes a part of the autonomous region; in case of component cities, they do not cease to be a part of their province but regional services will be under the ARMM. **If a majority in a municipality does not vote in favor of inclusion but the totals for the rest of the province are in favor it will be a part of the ARMM nevertheless. Provinces and cities that approved expansion (for already members) and inclusion (for non-members) are highlighted: ===Summary=== Support from within the ARMM was overwhelmingly in favor, with all four provinces having at least 70% of those who voted in favor of expanding the region. Those which were asked for inclusion, on the other hand, were overwhelmingly opposed, with most provinces and cities having more than 90% of those who voted opposing inclusion, with the exception of Basilan (91%), which voted overwhelmingly for inclusion (its capital Isabela City voted not to be included) and Marawi (which is part of Lanao del Sur which already within the ARMM). ===Expansion=== *Question: Do you vote in favor of the amendments to Republic Act No. 6734, the Organic Act for the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, as proposed under this Organic Act, which includes, among other things, the expansion of the area of the autonomous region? ===Inclusion=== *Question: Do you vote in favor of the inclusion of your province or city in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao? ====Provinces==== ====Cities==== *Question: Do you vote in favor of the inclusion of your province or city in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao? ==References== *Full text of Republic Act 9054 ==See also== *2001 Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao general election Category:Referendums in the Philippines Category:2001 in the Philippines Category:2001 referendums Category:2001 elections in the Philippines Category:Autonomy referendums Category:Presidency of Gloria Macapagal Arroyo Category:August 2001 events in Asia ",
