The university was named after the entrepreneur Tom\u00e1\u0161 Ba\u0165a, the founder of the shoe industry in Zl\u00edn. With a current student population of more than 9,200, TBU is among the medium-sized Czech universities. == History == TBU in Zl\u00edn came from the 40-year tradition of the Faculty of Technology, which was established in Zl\u00edn in 1969. This faculty was founded in 1960 as a vocational college for the Svit factory, and it was a part of the Technical University in Bratislava. In 1963 it became a part of the Technical University in Brno. This faculty had been educating specialists in leather, plastics and rubber technology for a long time. Later another vocational college in the town was established - the Design department, which is still a part of the Academy of Arts, Architecture and Design in Prague. A proposal for the establishment of Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn was developed in the 1990s. As at that time, both the Faculty of Management and Economics and Institute of Advertising and Marketing Communications (later the Faculty of Multimedia Communications) were founded. However, on November 14, 2000, the then Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel signed the Act on the Establishment of Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn and the University was founded as of January 1, 2001. The town of Zl\u00edn eventually became known for providing higher education and research in a number of specialized fields. The Faculty of Multimedia Communications was established in January 2002 and on 1 January 2006 the Faculty of Applied Informatics was founded. This was followed a year later by the establishment of the Faculty of Humanities. On 1 September 2009, the newest faculty, the Faculty of Logistics and Crisis Management, was launched. Currently, there are 9,700 students pursuing different degree programmes at the university. Prof. Petr S\u00e1ha is the current Rector of TBU. He was also the first Rector when Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn was established in 2001. == Organisation == Faculty of Management and Economics of TBU in Zl\u00edn As of 2019, Tomas Bata University in Zl\u00edn is made up of six faculties that provide 190 accredited degree courses within 111 accredited degree programmes.
