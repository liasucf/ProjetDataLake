    "text": "The \u0141\u00f3d\u017a\u2014Kutno railway is a railway line located in central Poland, in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship, connecting the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a with a railway station in Kutno via Zgierz, Ozork\u00f3w and \u0141\u0119czyca. The section between \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew and Zgierz stations is a part of a railway ring around the city of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a. == History == Construction of the railway was commenced by Polish State Railways in 1920. In 1923 the partially finished section between Zgierz and \u0141\u0119czyca was opened, three years later a link to Kutno was finished. The section between Zgierz and Widzew stations was finished in 1931. The railway was electrified within two stages: in 1969 (\u0141\u00f3d\u017a Widzew-Zgierz) and 1981 (Zgierz-Kutno). == Current condition == The railway line is currently used for both freight and passenger services. The section between Zgierz and Kutno is listed as the railway of national importance. However, due to being single-track, the capacity of the railway is vastly limited, especially with regional passenger services from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to Kutno. The railway line is mainly served by \u0141KA regional trains from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska station to Kutno and commuter trains from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Fabryczna station to Zgierz. Also, PolRegio trains from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a to Toru\u0144, as well as PKP Intercity trains between Gdynia and Katowice, use this railway. == Future == The railway is due to be refurbished, in order to allow a increase in operational speed. There are plans to either build up a second track on Zgierz-Kutno section, or create new railway connecting these two stations, which will run mostly intercity passenger services. == References == Category:Railway lines in Poland Category:Transport in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Category:Zgierz County Category:\u0141\u0119czyca County Category:Kutno County ",
