While at Beloit he also served as the school's athletic director. He resigned in March 1929 because he disagreed with providing student-athletes with scholarship money, an opinion that began gaining support among Beloit's officials during his time as athletic director. In basketball, Bohler coached at Beloit as well as for Humboldt State. His longest tenure for any team, however, was as the head baseball coach for Chico State, a position he held for 17 seasons. Chico State has since named their baseball field \"Roy Bohler Field\". In his 17 years as Chico State's coach, he led them to seven conference championships. ==Head coaching record== ===Football=== ==References== Category:All-American college men's basketball players Category:American men's basketball coaches Category:American men's basketball players Category:Beloit Buccaneers athletic directors Category:Beloit Buccaneers football coaches Category:Beloit Buccaneers men's basketball coaches Category:Centers (basketball) Category:Chico State Wildcats baseball coaches Category:Chico State Wildcats football coaches Category:Humboldt State Lumberjacks men's basketball coaches Category:UC Santa Barbara Gauchos football coaches Category:Washington State Cougars baseball players Category:Washington State Cougars football players Category:Washington State Cougars men's basketball players Category:Willamette Bearcats football coaches ",
