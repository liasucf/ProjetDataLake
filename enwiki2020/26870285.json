    "text": "Have a Laugh! is a 2009-2012 American animated series produced by the Walt Disney Company for the Disney Channel. The series is a set of interstitials, presenting edited versions of classic Mickey Mouse cartoons. ==Plot== The series features short and long versions of Disney shorts. The short versions are re-voiced with current Disney voice actors such as Tony Anselmo (Donald Duck), Jim Cummings, Bill Farmer (Goofy), and Bret Iwan (Mickey Mouse). The show features Disney cartoons with the original opening and closing credits restored (if content has been removed, a stamp bearing the words \"Short Version\" appears on the title card). The series also features short subjects such as \"Disney's Re-Micks\" where they match classic Mickey Mouse cartoons and popular songs such as \"He Could Be the One\" by Miley Cyrus, similar to the 1980s D-TV series. ==List of major characters== * Mickey Mouse (voiced by Bret Iwan, and Walt Disney in some older shorts) * Donald Duck, Huey, Dewey, and Louie (voiced by Tony Anselmo) * Goofy, Pluto (voiced by Bill Farmer) * Minnie Mouse (voiced by Russi Taylor, and Marcellite Garner and Thelma Boardman in some older shorts) * Chip, Daisy Duck (voiced by Tress MacNeille) * Dale, Narrator (voiced by Corey Burton) * Pete (voiced by Jim Cummings) ==List of cartoons== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
