The Drum Dance is a set of spiritual beliefs that center on Turkey Tailfeather Woman and her escape from the American military, after which she built a large drum while in hiding. The religion spread throughout a large swathe of North America after about 1877. The drum used in the Drum Dance is the forerunner of the large drum used in modern powwows. ==References== * * * Category:Anishinaabe mythology Category:Goddesses of the indigenous peoples of North America Category:Native American dances ",
