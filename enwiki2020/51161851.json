    "text": "The McDonald House is a historic residence located west of Winterset, Iowa, United States. William and Barbara McDonald settled in Madison County during the Civil War, and bought this farm in the 1870s. Although not as early as others in the county, this house is a good example of a vernacular limestone farmhouse. with This 1\u00bd-story structure is composed of locally quarried stone. Its construction is attributed to David Harris, who was one of the last stonemasons still working in the county when this was built. It follows an asymmetrical massed rectangular plan, and it is built on a slightly raised basement. It features two-against-one broken bond, and textured stone characteristic of Harris' work. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1875 Category:Vernacular architecture in Iowa Category:Houses in Madison County, Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Madison County, Iowa Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa ",
