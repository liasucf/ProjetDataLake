A creative and repertory company, it performs works that reflect the diverse trends of contemporary ballet. ==History== Les Grands Ballets Canadiens de Montr\u00e9al was founded in 1957 by Ludmilla Chiriaeff. Conductor and composer Michel Perrault served as the organization's first music director. Since its creation, Les Grands Ballets has performed a broad range of dance, ranging from classics to major contemporary work. Under the direction of Chiriaeff and Fernand Nault (1965\u20131973), Brian Macdonald (1974\u20131977) and Lawrence Rhodes (1990\u20131999), the institution fostered the development of such notable artists as James Kudelka, \u00c9douard Lock and Ginette Laurin. In 2000, Gradimir Pankov became Artistic Director. A native of Macedonia, Pankov previously served as Artistic Director of Nederlands Dans Theater II (Netherlands), the National Ballet of Finland (Helsinki), the Cullberg Ballet (Sweden), and Ballet du Grand Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Gen\u00e8ve (Switzerland). In 2017, Ivan Cavallari became the artistic director of les Grands Ballets. Born in Italy, he trained at Teatro alla Scala Ballet School in Milan. Before becoming artistic director of les Grands Ballets, he was artistic director of the West Australian Ballet and then the Ballet de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra national du Rhin. Since 1986, Pierre Lapointe, a Quebec native and a graduate of l'\u00c9cole sup\u00e9rieure de ballet du Qu\u00e9bec, is the Principal Ballet Master. The company has commissioned work from some of the world's most prominent choreographers: The Queen of Spades by Kim Brandstrup; The Butterfly Effect by Shawn Hounsell; Between Ashes and Angels by Adam Hougland; Noces, Cinderella and The Rite of Spring by Stijn Celis; The Little Prince, Possibly Six and TooT by Didy Veldman; The Beast and the Beauty by Kader Belarbi; Four Seasons by Mauro Bigonzetti; Minus One and Danz by Ohad Naharin; Rodin/Claudel by Peter Quanz; and Re\u2013II by Shen Wei. Its repertoire also includes major acquisitions by such artists as Mats Ek, Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n, Jean-Christophe Maillot and Christopher Wheeldon, along with works by young creators like Stephan Thoss, Didy Veldman and Peter Quanz. In 2008 Gradimir Pankov established the national choreographic contest, won by Jean-S\u00e9bastien Couture, which has allowed Les Grands Ballets to showcase work by emerging Canadian choreographers. Each season, Les Grands Ballets invites international companies to perform as part of its program; the list includes Houston Ballet, Royal Winnipeg Ballet, Alvin Ailey\u00ae American Dance Theater, Cullberg Ballet (Sweden), Compa\u00f1\u00eda Nacional de Danza (Spain), Warsaw Ballet (Poland), Cloud Gate Dance Theatre (Taiwan), Shen Wei Dance Arts (New York City), Ballet de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra de Lyon (France), Dutch National Ballet and Eifman Ballet Theatre of St-Petersburg (Russia). ==Dancers== Dancers for the 2012-2013 season: ===First soloists=== * Marcin Kaczorowski * \u00c9milie Durville * Vanesa Garcia-Ribala Montoya * Herv\u00e9 Courtain * Jeremy Raia * Andr\u00e9 Silva * Edi Blloshmi ===Soloists=== * Robin Mathes * Aline Sch\u00fcrger * Jean-S\u00e9bastien Couture * Robert Deskins * J\u00e9r\u00e9my Galdeano ===Demi-soloists=== * Sam Colby * Mahomi Endoh * Emma Garau Cima * Marie-Eve Lapointe * Valentine Legat * Graziella Lorriaux * Sahra Maira * Bryna Catherine Pascoe * Alisia Pobega * Annie Jean Shreffler * Yadil Suarez Llerena * Kenji Matsuyama Ribeiro ===Corps de ballet=== * Sarah Kingston * Eva Kolarova * \u00c9line Mal\u00e8gue * Rub\u00e9n Julliard * Tetyana Martyanova * Hamilton Nieh * Stephen Satterfield * Andrew Skeels * Julie Turcotte * Hikota Taira * Giulia Vennari ===Apprentice=== * Chen Sheng ===Former principal dancer=== * Rachel Rufer (2000-2010) * Genevi\u00e8ve Gu\u00e9rard (1999-2006) ===Former soloists=== * L\u00e9na\u00efg Gu\u00e9gan (2007-2010) * Isabelle Paquette (2001-2010) * Guillaume Pruneau (2002-2010) ==References== ==External links== * Les Grands Ballets website * Les Grands Ballets Canadiens, Productions Internationales Albert Sarfati Category:Ballet companies in Canada Category:Culture of Montreal Category:Performing groups established in 1957 Category:1957 establishments in Quebec ",
