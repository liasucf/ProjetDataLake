    "text": "Dick's Picks Volume 22 is a two-CD album by the rock group the Grateful Dead, the 22nd installment of the live archival release series. It documents portions of the concerts on February 23 and 24, 1968, at the Kings Beach Bowl in Kings Beach, California (located on the north shore of Lake Tahoe). It was released in June 2001. Dick's Picks Volume 22 is mastered in HDCD from the original recordings by Dan Healy. The recordings are noted for being part of the live material used to create Anthem of the Sun, the Grateful Dead's second album. ==Caveat emptor== Each volume of Dick's Picks has its own \"caveat emptor\" label, advising the listener of the sound quality of the recording. The one for Volume 22 reads: \"Warning: This is not an audiophile recording! Many of you may have read the numerous Dick's Picks Caveat Emptors over the years and thought \"Oh yeah... sure... whatever.\" Well, this old analog recording source exhibits many audio flaws including high distortion, low vocals, tape hiss, and missing pieces. No fair calling Customer Support and complaining! However, let it be known that this CD also includes some pretty damn exciting and historical music, and for that reason is brought to you with pride.\" ==Track listing== ===Disc one=== #\"Viola Lee Blues\" (Noah Lewis) \u2013 19:16 #\"It Hurts Me Too\" (Elmore James) \u2013 4:13 #\"Dark Star\" (Robert Hunter, Jerry Garcia, Mickey Hart, Bill Kreutzmann, Phil Lesh, Ron McKernan, Bob Weir) \u2013 6:49> #\"China Cat Sunflower\" (Hunter, Garcia) \u2013 4:38> #\"The Eleven\" (Hunter, Lesh) \u2013 10:33> #\"Turn On Your Lovelight\" (Deadric Malone, Joseph Scott) \u2013 12:40 #\"Born Cross-Eyed\" (Weir) \u2013 2:32> #\"Spanish Jam\" (Grateful Dead) \u2013 7:23 ===Disc two=== #\"Morning Dew\" (Bonnie Dobson, Tim Rose) \u2013 8:10 #\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\" (Sonny Boy Williamson) \u2013 14:39 #\"That's It For The Other One\" (Garcia, Kreutzmann, Weir) \u2013 8:13> #\"New Potato Caboose\" (Bobby Petersen, Lesh) \u2013 9:08 #\"Alligator\" (Hunter, McKernan, Lesh) \u2013 3:45> #\"China Cat Sunflower\" (Hunter, Garcia) \u2013 4:14> #\"The Eleven\" (Hunter, Lesh) \u2013 7:17> #\"Alligator\" (McKernan, Lesh) \u2013 6:39> #\"Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks)\" (Grateful Dead) \u2013 11:49> #\"Feedback (Grateful Dead) \u2013 4:55 ==Personnel== ===Grateful Dead=== *Jerry Garcia \u2013 lead guitar, vocals *Phil Lesh \u2013 electric bass, vocals *Bob Weir \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals *Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan \u2013 organ, harmonica, percussion, vocals *Mickey Hart \u2013 drums *Bill Kreutzmann \u2013 drums ===Production=== *Dan Healy \u2013 live recording *Dick Latvala \u2013 tape archivist *David Lemieux \u2013 tape archivist *Jeffrey Norman \u2013 CD mastering *Eileen Law \u2013 archival research *Tina Carpenter \u2013 cover art and design *Robert Minkin \u2013 layout design *Andy Mond \u2013 photos *Patricia Holmbo \u2013 photos *Brad Perks \u2013 photos *Chris Jepsen \u2013 photos ==Recording dates== *February 23 \u2013 Disc One *February 24 \u2013 Disc Two ==Notes== 22 Category:2005 live albums ",
