    "text": "\"Red Velvet\" is a song written by Ian Tyson and originally recorded by Johnny Cash. Recorded by Cash at the Columbia Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, the song was released in September 1967 as a single (Columbia 4-44288, with \"The Wind Changes\" on the opposite side). U.S. Billboard gave the song a \"Country Spotlight\" review, stating: \"Folkster Ian Tyson's plaintive ballad serves as potent material for Cash as he perfoms [sic] it in his compelling and winning style. Another big Cash hit,\" but in the end, \"Red Velvet\" did not chart at all, while the flip side charted on the Billboard country chart, but made it only to number 60 and dropped off completely after only six weeks. Later the song was included on Johnny Cash's album Old Golden Throat (1968). == Analysis == == Track listing == == References == == External links == * \"Red Velvet\" on the Johnny Cash official website Category:Johnny Cash songs Category:1967 songs Category:1967 singles Category:Columbia Records singles Category:Songs written by Ian Tyson Category:Country music songs ",
