    "text": "The Davy Sound () is a sound in King Christian X Land, Northeast Greenland. Administratively it is part of the Northeast Greenland National Park zone.GoogleEarth ==History== The sound was named and put on the map by William Scoresby (1789 \u2013 1857) in 1822 in honour of Cornish chemist and inventor Sir Humphry Davy (1778 \u2013 1829), president of the Royal Society from 1820 to 1827.Place names, NE Greenland In 1899, during the Swedish Greenland Expedition on which Swedish Arctic explorer Alfred Gabriel Nathorst found and first mapped King Oscar Fjord, he made southwards for the Davy Sound after having entered from Antarctic Sound. But Davy sound was blocked by ice and Nathorst had to travel back north.Spencer Apollonio, Lands That Hold One Spellbound: A Story of East Greenland, 2008, p. 81 Nathorst proposed 72\u00b0 10\u2032 N as the northern limit of Davy Sound, which is roughly the present day geographic limit. Lieut. P. F. WhiteP. F. White Letters of the Cambridge Expedition to East Greenland suggested that the limit of the Davy Sound should be expanded until 72\u00b0 30\u2032, at the bend in the fjord trending northward \u2014near the mouth of Segels\u00e4llskapet Fjord. This proposal, by which the length of the Davy Sound would be greater than that corresponding to King Oscar Fjord, has not found wide acceptance. ==Geography== Davy Sound is a broad channel with a fjord structure that runs roughly from the Greenland Sea in the southeast to the northwest for roughly , becoming King Oscar Fjord further to the north. Its minimum width is . The Davy Sound separates the northeastern shore of Jameson Land \u2014part of the Greenland mainland\u2014 from the southwestern shore of Traill Island. Cape Simpson rises on the northeastern side of the mouth of the sound and Cape Biot on the southwestern. Antarctic Haven is located on the southwestern shore, about from Cape Biot and Mesters Vig a little further up the same shore.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 119 Even in the summertime the channel is usually encumbered by ice and tidal currents are strong and dangerous for navigation.William Scoresby, Journal of a Voyage to the Northern Whale-Fishery.
