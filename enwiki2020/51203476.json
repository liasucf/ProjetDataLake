    "text": "\"Gangsta\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Kehlani. It serves as the fourth and final single from the Suicide Squad soundtrack. The song was released on August 1, 2016 by Atlantic Records and was written by Kehlani, Myron Birdsong, Skylar Grey, Andrew Swanson and JMIKE, with the latter two also producing the song. Lyrically the song speaks to her desire for a gangster's love for her, referring to the relationship between The Joker and Harley Quinn in the movie from the latter's point of view. The song is also featured on the deluxe edition of SweetSexySavage. ==Music video== The music video premiered on August 5, 2016 on Kehlani's YouTube account. In the video Kehlani is seen in places making multiple references to the movie. She starts lying in a room of broken glass next to the bat Harley uses in the movie, swimming in a pool of water similar to acid Harley dives into, performing aerial acrobatics on the ceiling, dancing in a club for a love interest who looks similar to the Joker with green hair, tattoos and purple clothes and finally meeting that love interest outside. This is intercut with scenes from the movie showing the relationship of Harley and the Joker. ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016-2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 61 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 81 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Italy (FIMI) | 66 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Heatseekers (Recorded Music NZ) | 2 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 9 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 84 |} ==Certifications== ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics of this song at Genius Category:Kehlani songs Category:2016 singles Category:2016 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Songs written for films Category:Songs about domestic violence Category:Torch songs Category:Songs written by Skylar Grey Category:Songs written by Jason Evigan Category:Songs written by Kehlani Category:DC Extended Universe music Category:Songs written by Djemba Djemba Category:Songs written by Jacob Luttrell ",
