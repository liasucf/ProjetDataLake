    "text": "Soeste is a river in the Cloppenburg district in Lower Saxony, Germany, a tributary of the Ems. The Soeste forms from two source brooks in Hesselnfeld and Egterholz, two small settlements in the Emstek municipality. It flows northwest through Cloppenburg, where its water flow is already sufficient for water mills to be operated im former times. The Soeste flows into a dam at Th\u00fclsfelde ('), which was built in the 1920s. From there it flows through the towns Friesoythe and Bar\u00dfel. West of the latter town, the Soeste flows into the J\u00fcmme, which drains into the Ems. ==See also== *List of rivers of Lower Saxony Category:Rivers of Lower Saxony Category:Rivers of Germany ",
