    "text": "Patrick Finglas (died 1537) was a leading Irish judge and statesman of the sixteenth century, who was regarded as a mainstay of the English Crown in Ireland. He was also the author of an influential \"Breviat\", or tract, called Of the Getting of Ireland, and of the Decay of the same, concerning the decline of English power in Ireland. Little is known of his parentage, but Francis Elrington Ball states that he came from a long established family who lived in and took their surname from Finglas, County Dublin. He later held estates at Piercetown, near Dunboyne, County Meath, and at Westphailstown in County Dublin. He was at Lincoln's Inn 1503-6 and became Serjeant in 1509. He was considered one of the ablest lawyers of his time, and also a gifted writer. ==Career == Finglas was appointed Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer by Henry VIII in 1520, and afterwards, by patent dated at Westminster 8 May 1534 Mary Ann Lyons 'Finglas, Patrick', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [accessed 21 December 2011:http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9458] he was constituted Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench for Ireland in the place of Sir Bartholomew Dillon, recently deceased. He resigned the latter office in 1535,Mary Ann Lyons 'Finglas, Patrick', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [accessed 21 December 2011:http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9458] and later served a second term as Chief Baron until his death in 1537. He was a member of the Privy Council of Ireland. ==The Breviat== He wrote A Breviat (summary) of the getting (conquest) of Ireland, and of the Decaie (decay) of the same.Printed in Harris's 'Hibernica,' edit. 1770, i. 79-103. An original manuscript of this work is in the Public Records Office State Papers, Henry VIII, Ireland, vol. xii. art.7. It is described in the calendar as \"An Historical Dissertation on the Conquest of Ireland, the decay of that land, and measures proposed to remedy the grievances thereof arising from the oppressions of the Irish nobility\". The measures proposed included the settlement of the province of Leinster by \"English lords and gentlemen\", the securing of castles and other strongholds, and more controversially, the suppression of all monasteries, which he regarded as potential centres of rebellion. He did not urge the expulsion of the native Irish people, arguing that they would be a useful element in society if properly governed.Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 The \"Breviat\" probably built on an earlier treatise, \"The Decay of Ireland\" (1515), by Sir William Darcy, the long-serving Vice-Treasurer of Ireland. Finglas was regarded by the English Crown as one of the principal supporters of English rule in Ireland; in 1520 the Lord Deputy of Ireland, the Earl of Surrey, praised him to Cardinal Wolsey as one of \"the best willed and most diligent to do the King's Grace true and faithful service of all the learned men of this land.\"Ball Judges in Ireland ==Family == He married Isabella (or Elizabeth) Golding, daughter of Robert Golding of Churchtown, Dublin. They had at least three children: Thomas, Patrick and Genet. Thomas in 1532 was described as \"capite\" (tenant in chief) of Westphailstown, and was given permission to make a sub-lease of his lands to the Rector of Howth.D'Alton, John History of the County of Dublin Dublin 1838 p.504 He married Anne Cusack, daughter of John Cusack of Cussington, and sister of Sir Thomas Cusack, later Lord Chancellor of Ireland, and had issue. Genet married Sir Thomas Fitzwilliam and had four children, including Richard, the eldest son and heir. Their grandchildren included Thomas FitzWilliam, 1st Viscount FitzWilliam. Later descendants included a second Genet Finglas (died 1627), who married firstly John Bathe, Attorney General for Ireland, secondly the distinguished soldier Sir William Warren, and thirdly Terence O'Dempsey, 1st Viscount Clanmalier. She was the daughter of Patrick Finglas of Westphailstown, who was probably the younger son of the judge. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing Category:1537 deaths Category:People of the Tudor period Category:16th-century Irish writers Category:People from Finglas Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:Members of the Privy Council of Ireland Category:Lords Chief Justice of Ireland Category:Chief Barons of the Irish Exchequer Category:Serjeants-at-law (Ireland) Category:Lawyers from Dublin (city) ",
