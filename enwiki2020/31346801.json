The specific epithet (fraseri) honours Charles Fraser, the first superindentent of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney. ==Distribution and habitat== Unlike many Boronia plants, Fraser's boronia prefers moist gullies and rainforest areas, on soils based on sandstone and is found mainly in the Sydney region but also occurs in the Blue Mountains. ==Conservation== Fraser's boronia is rare plant, with a ROTAP rating of 2RCa. ==Use in horticulture== Well drained soils with part shade are advised for cultivation. Boronia \"Telopea Valley Star\" is a hybrid between this species and Boronia mollis, which is hardier and has been grown in Australian gardens. == References == ==External links== * fraseri Category:Flora of New South Wales Category:Apiales of Australia Category:Taxa named by William Jackson Hooker Category:Plants described in 1843 ",
