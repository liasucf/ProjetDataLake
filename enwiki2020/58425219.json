    "text": "Antoine Tisn\u00e9 (29 July 1932 \u2013 19 July 1998) was a French composer. == Life == Born in Lourdes, Tisn\u00e9 began his musical studies at the Tarbes Conservatory. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1952 in a music writing class. He was then a student of Georges Hugon in harmony and No\u00ebl Gallon and Jean Rivier in fugue and counterpoint, then had Darius Milhaud and Andr\u00e9 Jolivet as his teachers. He won a Second Grand Prix de Rome in 1962. Principal music inspector at the Ministry of Cultural Affairs between 1967 and 1992, then music inspector in charge of the municipal conservatories of the City of Paris, Tisn\u00e9 composed more than three hundred works ranging from pieces for solo instrument to the symphony orchestra. His works are recorded in France by MFA, REM, Calliope. He was an Officer of the National Order of Merit, a Commandeur of the Ordre des Arts et des LettresArchives of the ordre des Arts et des Lettres. and was decorated with the Ordre des Palmes acad\u00e9miques. Among other awards, he has received the Copley Foundation Prize, the Helphen Prize, the Lili Boulanger Prize, the Koussevitsky Foundation Prize, the Casa de Vel\u00e1zquez Prize, the Grand Prix musical de la Ville de Paris, the Composers' Prize of the SACEM. Tisn\u00e9's work is that of a humanist for whom composition procedures are only a tool intended to restore as well as possible the explorations of his imagination without ever being in itself the essential generator of the composed works. New technologies, while he knew how to appreciate them, do not fit into his thought pattern as a deliberate substitute for inspiration or as an alternative to a musical discourse that he likes to be imbued with spirituality. Tisn\u00e9's work is resolutely expressive and does not need to be followed, at the time of its interpretation, by explanatory comments.Interview with Antoine Tisn\u00e9 One enters the universe of Tisn\u00e9 as on enters the universe of a painter or even more perhaps in the universe of an architect by its spatial dimension and by its quasi-telluric energy. Tisn\u00e9 was a musician of spaces. These spaces or fields ignore emptiness; they are spiritually, emotionally, historically charged, whether real or purely dreamlike, if only because on can define in this abundance the solution of continuity between the real and the unreal. But his world is also our world.Antoine Tisn\u00e9 Tisn\u00e9 died in Paris in 1998. == Works == * Sonata for piano (1968) * \u00c9pigraphe pour une st\u00e8le for piano (1968) * Soliloques for bassoon solo (1968) * Concerto for flute and string orchestra (1969) * Hommage \u00e0 Calder (1970) * Stabile Mobile (1970) * Luminescences for organ (1970) * Solstices for bassoon and string orchestra (1973) * Sonata for violin and piano (1973) * Alliages (1974) * Osiriaques (1975) * H\u00e9raldiques for trumpet and piano (1975) * Music for Sonehenge for alto saxophone and piano (1977) * Espaces irradi\u00e9s for alto saxophone and piano (1983) * Boc\u00e9phal for 2 pianos and narrator (1984) * Musique en trio for violin, cello and piano (1984) * Apr\u00e8s... for clarinet (1984) * Concerto for viola and orchestra (1985) * Ombra Veneziana for 2 guitars (1985) * Soleils Noirs for piano (1986) * Espaces irradi\u00e9s (1987) * Antienne pour l'au-del\u00e0: Baryton, violon solo et orchestre \u00e0 cordes (1986) * Horizons for clarinet and viola (1987) * Vision des temps imm\u00e9moriaux (1987) * Trio pour Ondes Martenot Piano Percussion * Ragas - Hommage \u00e0 Ren\u00e9 Daumal (1987) * Trio pour Ondes Martenot Piano Percussion avec r\u00e9citante (1987) * \u00c9pisodes New-Yorkais for flute, clarinet, violin, cello and piano (1988) * Monodie IV pour un espace sacr\u00e9 for flute solo (1989) * Sonata for viola and piano (1989) * Partita for flute solo (1990) * Les Voiles de la nuit, premiered by the Orchestre symphonique fran\u00e7ais conducted by Laurent Petitgirard (1992) == References == == External links == * * Discography (Discogs) * Antoine Tisn\u00e9 (Classical music now) * Antoine Tisn\u00e9 (Cdmc) * Antoine Tisn\u00e9: Soleils noirs (YouTube) Category:1932 births Category:People from Lourdes Category:1998 deaths Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:20th-century French composers Category:French male composers Category:Prix de Rome for composition Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Commandeurs of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Category:Officers of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:20th-century French male musicians ",
