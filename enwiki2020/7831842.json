In his principal work, Principles of Political Economy (three volumes, 1893\u20131901), he closely follows John Stuart Mill in his selection of material, but employs statistical and historical discussion, instead of the abstract reasoning from simple assumption that characterises Mill's work. ==References== ==External links== * * *Portraits of Nicholson (National Portrait Gallery, England) *William Augustus Guy medal *John Shield Nicholson - The University of Sydney * * Category:English economists Category:1850 births Category:1927 deaths Category:Alumni of King's College London Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Academics of the University of Edinburgh Category:Fellows of the British Academy ",
