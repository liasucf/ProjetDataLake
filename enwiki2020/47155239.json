Since the series' ending, Boomerang continued to air reruns as of 2020. ==Plot== After moving to New Orleans with her father and pets, Chester & Harold, Mina Monroe is left with a key given to her by her late Aunt Marie that she uses to open a cellar in the Orlock Apartments. Doing this frees a vampire rabbit named Bunnicula who drains vegetables instead of blood to strengthen his powers. Unaware of his traits, she adopts him and makes him a new member of the Monroe family. The series is mostly set with Chester and Harold joining Bunnicula in his supernatural adventures involving situations only he can solve. ==Characters== ===Main=== *Bunnicula (voiced by Chris Kattan) - The titular character of the show, Bunnicula is a rabbit and was once the pet of Count Dracula. Hence his name is a combination of the words \"Bunny\" and \"Dracula\" respectively. He is very different from the original version of the character who appears in the books. As it was said by Chester, Bunnicula was found in a locked chamber in the cellar of the apartment complex that Mina, Harold and Chester now live in. Also he is seen to have a few vampiric traits such as hiding from sunlight, sleeping in a coffin, flying with bat wings, and gaining sustenance by draining juice from vegetables (instead of blood) with his fangs. Bunnicula speaks limited English, although Harold seems to understand him, and usually translates for Chester. He cares for Mina a great deal, but tends to cause mischief that yields supernatural consequences. Bunnicula sucks juices from vegetables (just like in the books) but different kinds of vegetables cause some kind of reaction in Bunnicula (carrots enhance his vision, sugar beets make him hyperactive and speedy, squashes enlarge his feet, onions make him cry powerful jet streams of tears, garlic turns him into a skeleton bunny, ghost peppers make him breath out a fire demon, rutabagas give him telekinesis, turnips turn the house upside- down, wasabi makes him spontaneously combust, leeks give him spider legs, eggplants turn him into a huge and hideous three-eyed monster rabbit, baby carrots make him shrink, rotten yams make him invisible, mandrake roots makes him taller with a more humanoid body, horseradish turns him into a horse, chili peppers make him breathe fire, etc.) in the books, it was unclear whether or not Bunnicula had vampiric powers although he was somehow able to get in and out of his cage without opening the door. Unlike his Ruby-Spears incarnation, Bunnicula's ears turn into batty wings to fly. Ruby-Spears made an animated special, now owned by Warner Bros. Animation. *Chester (voiced by Sean Astin) \\- Mina's pet cat. Although he does value Bunnicula as a friend, he is often exasperated with him. This is mainly because he is constantly terrified of the monsters and supernatural phenomena that happen around him and his friends. He does appear to be a good thinker in certain situations, which has been acknowledged by Harold, although Harold has also correctly pointed out that \"Chester's pretty smart, but he never actually learns from his mistakes\". Chester is also a fan of sudoku and jazz music. In the books, Chester is an eccentric Orange tabby whose wild suspicions of occult phenomena constantly exasperate Harold. *Harold (voiced by Brian Kimmet) - Mina's pet dog. He loves his friends Chester and Bunnicula, and their owner, Mina. He isn't overly intelligent, but despite this he is the only one who can fluently understand Bunnicula and usually translates for him to Chester. He is also fiercely loyal and values the friendships he has. Harold appears to be a short-haired, brown mutt. In the books, Harold is a ponderous, intelligent, thoughtful character, forced to put up with the eccentricities of Chester and the new rabbit. Also in the books Harold resembles a Sheepdog, though he claims to have Russian Wolf Hound in him as well. *Mina Monroe (voiced by Kari Wahlgren) - A 13-year-old girl who just moved to New Orleans, Louisiana from Middle America with her father. It was seen in the opening that she was the one who freed Bunnicula from his prison in the cellar with a key that was left for her by her Aunt Marie. Aunt Marie left an apartment to Mina and her father. Mina's mother is never seen or mentioned in the series. Mina's style is punk alternative, and she is a fan of rock music and horror movies. She is usually completely oblivious to any supernatural happenings in the Orlock apartments despite saying that she would love to witness some supernatural activity herself. However, in the episode 'Oh, Brother', Mina finally discovers Bunnicula is a vampire after seeing him flying with his chiropteran ears and sucking the juice out of a carrot with his fangs. But rather than being alarmed by this, she is amazed and immediately embraces him saying she'll always love him, no matter what. Mina's name is taken from the character, Mina Harker, of the original 1897 Dracula story. In the books Chester, Harold, Bunnicula and Howie are owned by Robert, Ann, Pete, and Toby Monroe. ===Others=== * Arthur Monroe (voiced by Chris Kattan) - Mina's father who moves with his daughter to New Orleans from Middle America after inheriting an apartment from Aunt Marie. Everyone refers to him as \"Mina's Dad\", including himself on more than one occasion. This only adds to his already peculiar behaviour, as he has been seen in \u201cMy Imaginary Fiend\u201d talking to thin air, and in \u201cFamily Portrait\u201d he throws a princess-themed party for Mina for her 13th birthday. His wife isn't seen or mentioned in the series. His face is never on full view to the audience; usually it is blocked by a hat he is wearing or some other sort of obstacle. That is until the episode 'Oh, Brother', when he looks up from a magazine he is reading and says hello to Bunnicula. His name is taken from Arthur Holmwood, who is one the protagonists in the original 1897 Dracula story. * Marsha (voiced by Monie Mon) - Mina's cautious and shy best friend, who serves as a foil to the outgoing Mina. Marsha is extremely unlucky and often the only human to notice supernatural activity. * Becky (voiced by Kate Higgins) - Mina's other best friend. Becky is very monotone and sarcastic, acting like the stereotypical teenage girl. * Scott Dingleman (voiced by Scott Menville) - Mina's love interest who shares many of her interests. Bunnicula, Chester, and Harold accidentally erased Scott's memories and tried to take advantage of him until they realized how much Mina missed Scott, and so restored his memory. For some reason, Scott can now understand them but chose to keep it a secret. * Madame Polidori (voiced by Grey Griffin) - The owner of a shop containing many supernatural objects. Madame Polidori often has dangerous items on display, such as a harmonica that revives fish as zombies and the Haunted Portrait of Miserio. Though early episodes depict her as knowledgeable of the supernatural, she is later depicted as somewhat incompetent; several episodes have her sell these dangerous items and she mistakes Chester and numerous animals for magical creatures (though the end of the episode reveals that, with the exception of Chester and a mouse she captured, the animals actually were magical creatures.) Madame Polidori doesn't like children or pets in her shop. Her name is taken from the author John Polidori who is famous for having written the very first published vampire story, \"The Vampyre\" written in 1816. * Patches the Weredude (voiced by Eric Bauza) - A laidback, fun-loving weredude. Patches often forgets he is a weredude, and acts like a cat even in human form. Patches moved into the Orlock Apartments in \u201cRevenge of the Return of the Curse of the Weredude\u201d. * Lugosi (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) - A deformed and insane guinea pig obsessed with serving Bunnicula, but his way of doing so makes him an enemy. He is later adopted by Marsha, who he declares his new master. Lugosi is now an ally of Bunnicula, although still referring to him as his master, does what he can to protect him and offers help to him, Chester and Harold when they need advice. Lugosi's name is taken from the actor Bela Lugosi who is famous for portraying Dracula on-screen for the first time in 1931. * Rusty Bones (voiced by Greg Eagles) - The ghost of a depressed blues singer who sang albums about his awful life. Rusty curses anyone who makes a mockery of his songs. * Fluffy (voiced by Sumalee Montano) - A Doberman Pinscher who hunts vampires and originally was an enemy to Bunnicula. Later however, she became another close ally. Fluffy is a parody of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. * Elvira - An imaginary cat. * Veronica Rabbit (voiced by Abby Trott) - A rabbit. * Baron Karloff (voiced by Donovan Patton) - A French Bulldog with his last name related to Boris Karloff, he once tried to summon a grave walker named Rip so that Fluffy can fight him and win because he is an obsess fan with Fluffy work and tried to get a vampire to bite him so he could be a vampire Fluffy can defeat for him * Hamburger Cheese (voiced by Scott Menville) - An imaginary friend. * Rafferty (voiced by Richard Steven Horvitz) - An albino squirrel. * Count Cavanda (voiced by Scott Menville) - A vampire tick. * Dr. Pistachio (voiced by Eric Bauza) - A squirrel. * Futbol Furries (leader voiced by Rhasaan Orange) - A team of wolves. ==Episodes== ==Broadcast== In Canada, the series started airing on Teletoon on April 2, 2016.
