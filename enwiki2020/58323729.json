It was initially built as a Romanesque structure in the 10th century, which in 1246 held the first celebration of an annual 'F\u00eate-Dieu', the festival later known as Corpus Christi. This structure was replaced by a Gothic building in the 16th century. Up until the Li\u00e8ge Revolution it was one of the seven collegiate churches of Li\u00e8ge. In 1886 it was promoted to the rank of minor basilica. ==Sources== *http://fr.structurae.de/structures/data/?ID=s0056128 *http://www.upsaintmartin.be/medias/files/visite-guidee-de-la-basilique-st- martin-liege-1.pdf Liege category:Gothic architecture in Belgium category:16th-century architecture category:Former collegiate churches category:Roman Catholic churches in Li\u00e8ge ",
