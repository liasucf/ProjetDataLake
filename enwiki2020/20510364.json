The company's name is an acronym for Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics. The company is headquartered in Westlake Village, California, United States. With a nudge from Apple Inc., the Westlake Village company created a low-cost condenser microphone called the Snowball for use with music recording software. That microphone became popular with aspiring pro musicians and dedicated hobbyists as an alternative to renting time in a recording studio. In 2008, Skipper and Martins sold BLUE Microphones to Transom Capital, a private Equity firm from Southern California. In 2013, The Riverside Company acquired BLUE Microphones from Transom Capital. Intrepid Investment Bankers advised BLUE Microphones in the transaction. In July 2018, Logitech announced plans to acquire Blue Microphones for $117 million USD. ==Products== BLUE Microphones designs and manufactures condenser microphones, ribbon microphones, dynamic microphones, USB microphones, microphone preamplifiers, microphone accessories and headphones. Some famous models include the Blue Yeti USB microphone and the Snowball iCE condenser microphone. ===Studio=== The company makes the Bottle Rocket Stage two, Bottle Rocket Stage one and The Application Specific Series each with a proprietary sonic signature. ==Awards== * Electronic Musician 2000 Editor\u2019s Choice Microphone of the Year - Blueberry condenser microphone * RetailVision 2009 Best Hardware peripheral - Mikey and Eyeball 2.0 * BeatWeek (formerly iProng) Best in Show 2009, 2010 ==See also== *C-Media - supplier of chips for USB microphones *List of microphone manufacturers ==References== ==External links== *BLUE Designs Website BLUE Website *Interview with Skipper Wise NAMM Oral History Library (2011) *Interview with Martin Saulespurens NAMM Oral History Library Category:Companies based in Westlake Village, California Category:Manufacturing companies based in Greater Los Angeles Category:Microphone manufacturers Category:Electronics companies established in 1995 Category:American companies established in 1995 Category:2018 mergers and acquisitions Category:Audio equipment manufacturers of the United States Category:American subsidiaries of foreign companies Category:Logitech ",
