The video begins with a scene depicting a traditional countryside home, with birds chirping audibly in the background. IU is seen flipping through the pages of a book. The music begins with the pressing of a cassette tape, giving the music video an old-timey feel. The video consists of the singer waiting alone throughout the traditional house. She is styled in traditional clothing, and occasionally is singing into an antique microphone in different shots. The lack of action reflects the lyrical message of loneliness in the song. In an Instagram post, the director answered fan questions about the props used throughout the video. Lee revealed the book used in the video was a 1950 first edition design book by Dong-Joo Yoon entitled \"The Sky, The Wind, The Stars and The Poetry\". It was chosen in an effort to incorporate books with vertical writing to add to the old-fashioned theme of the music video. Furthermore, since IU admires the Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne, the director filled the set with various items from the time period of the 1950s and 1960s. alt=IU The video currently has over 75 million views making it the second most popular Korean music video by a female soloist in 2017. == Live performances == Upon the release of her album \"Palette\", IU began promoting on music shows. \"Through the Night\"'s only performance on a music show was on April 23's episode of Inkigayo, where the song had won the previous week.
