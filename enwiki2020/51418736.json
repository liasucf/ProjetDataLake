    "text": "Grassroots Crisis Intervention CenterThe Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center, located at 6700 Freetown Road in Columbia (Howard County), Maryland is a private, non-profit organization that provides free hotline, crisis intervention, shelter, and outreach services 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. In operation since 1970, it is accredited as a crisis center by the American Association of Suicidology, and registered as a charitable organization with the Office of the Maryland Secretary of State, which verifies its compliance with the Maryland Solicitations Act. It participates in both the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and the Maryland Youth Crisis Hotline networks. In addition to answering hotline calls and providing face-to-face walk-in crisis counseling, Grassroots staff members and volunteers: operate a year-round, 51-bed shelter; manage the Howard County Cold Weather Shelter program, which provides shelter in local churches and synagogues throughout the winter for homeless families and individuals; support the Route One Day Resource Center for the homeless; and staff the Mobile Crisis Team, which responds with Howard County police officers to behavioral emergencies in the county. In 2010, Grassroots began sponsoring a support group for persons who have lost a family member to suicide. In 2013, it formalized a partnership with the Howard County Public School System to manage Change Matters, a program that teaches students about poverty and homelessness, and provides opportunities for community service. In 2016, it partnered with the Maryland Department of Health and Hygiene to develop and launch a free suicide-prevention app, There Is Hope. ==References== Category:Suicide prevention ",
