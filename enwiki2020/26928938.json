Until his last season with the BFC in 1983 he played 35 games, in which he shot four goals and took part in 4 European Cup matches. With BFC Dynamo Berlin he won the GDR championship three times. After the unsatisfying season of 1982/1983 (he didn't play a derby) he transferred to 1. FC Union Berlin, which was rather uncommon back then. Although his last team was the traditional arch-enemy of his new squad, he slowly became popular among his new fans. Already during his first days with Union he dominated the way the team played.

In 1994, as the new season was about to begin, he returned home and played for the Berlin club 1.
