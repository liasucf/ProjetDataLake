Billboard Books, New York. and number 66 on the Australian Kent Music Report. ==Track listing== All songs written by Karla Bonoff, except where noted. ==Reception== AllMusic's William Ruhlmann retrospectively called the first track, \"Trouble Again\", \"a gem (as Linda Ronstadt proved when she recorded it)\" but concluded that the album \"did not represent the leap that would have been required to vault Bonoff into the ranks of her star friends.\" Rolling Stone's Don Shewey dismissed Bonoff's work as \"sappy, MOR schlock.\" Though \"Trouble Again\" and \"Baby Don't Go\" are \"fast, fun and disposable \u2014 i.e., everything a pop single should be. The remainder of Restless Nights is insufferable sludge.\"Shewey, Don. \"Restless Nights\", Rolling Stone, December 13, 1979, p. 86. ==Personnel== * Ed Black \u2013 electric guitar * Karla Bonoff \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar, piano, background vocals * Jackie DeShannon \u2013 background vocals * Dan Dugmore \u2013 electric guitar * Kenny Edwards \u2013 bass guitar, background vocals * Steve Forman \u2013 percussion * Andrew Gold \u2013 electric guitar, electric piano, percussion, background vocals * Don Grolnick \u2013 piano, electric piano * Don Henley \u2013 background vocals * Garth Hudson \u2013 accordion * Danny Kortchmar - electric guitar * Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums * David Lindley \u2013 acoustic guitar * Rick Marotta \u2013 drums * J.
