    "text": "Belcamp House in 2015 Belcamp House is a house and former school, on a substantial estate off the Malahide Road, the R107, in Balgriffin, on the northern outskirts of Dublin. It is located in the Dublin 17 postal district. One of the two main lines of the River Mayne, the Turnapin Stream, runs through the lands of Belcamp, before continuing through southern Balgriffin and northern Donaghmede. ==History== ===Establishment=== The house was built by James Hoban (who later designed the White House in Washington, D.C.), for Sir Edward Newenham, a member of the Irish parliament, and an ardent supporter of the Republican Party in the United States, who corresponded with George Washington.Buildings at rish Belcamp House Dublin Irish Times ===Belcamp College=== The college was established in 1893 as a juniorate for the Oblate Fathers, and became a boarding school for boys. School facilities were built onto the original house but the original house still stands intact today. St Mary's Chapel was added to the complex in the early 1900s, and a two-storey red-brick accommodation wing. The chapel was adorned by 12 stained glass windows by Harry Clarke.Chapel of the Novitiate of the Oblate Fathers of St. Mary Immaculate -Belcamp Home In 1972 the historic Belcamp Hall was placed on the protected structures list. ===Alumni=== The actor Brendan Gleeson worked as an English and Irish teacher in Belcamp. The golfer Philip Walton was a pupil in the school, as was the theologian and writer Thomas Groome. Another former student at Belcamp was Fr Stewart Joseph Phelan OMI, who served as Navy chaplain in the Great War on HMS Black Prince; he was lost at sea at the Battle of Jutland in 1916.Centenary of the Battle of Jutland ===Sport=== The school produced some successful Gaelic football sides, winning the GAA Secondary Schools, Leinster Colleges Senior Football Championship in 1921, 1965, 1967 and 1968, and twice runners-up in the All-Ireland Schools final (for the Hogan Cup). Father Tom Scully, who taught mathematics, trained Belcamp's team to the three 1960s Leinster Schools' Football Championships. ===After the school=== The house was much damaged by vandals and fire following the closure of the school in 2004, when it was sold to property developer Gerry Gannon.Gannon embarks on plan for historic dublin site by John Mulligan, Irish Independent, 5 January 2016. Eventually the property fell under the control of NAMA. After 2011, the developer and the local authority did work to secure the premises more actively, but much loss had already occurred. Planning permission issued mid-2017 for the conversion of the main house into apartments, with a restaurant and childcare facility in one wing, and for 165 homes on the surrounding 15 hectares. Further housing proposals, including for five blocks of apartments, were to follow. An Taisce was supportive of the plans, while the Irish Georgian Society and some local residents had concerns about the historic building and public rights of way on parts of the land. As of summer 2018, the lands are now in development. Gannon Homes at one time planned up to 2,000 residential units, but only a few hundred have yet been considered for planning permission. ==Elements== ===Belcamp Hall=== The house was based on a similar model to the White House in Washington, and it included an \"oval office.\" It is a three-storey over basement, seven-bay structure. ===The River and the Ponds=== The Turnapin Stream, one of the two main branches of the Mayne River, and often referred to by the river's name, runs through the property south of the house and other buildings, and is dammed to form two ponds, simply called the Upper and Lower Pond, and with weirs to regulate the water flow. ===The Walled Garden=== Northwest of and behind the Hall is a walled garden. Now in poor repair, it once supplied the house with fruit and vegetables. ===The Washington Monument=== A castellate monument was erected to George Washington, possibly the first such in the world. ===The woods and grounds=== The estate also features woodland and rolling grounds, and the at-times steep-sided valley of the Turnapin or Mayne. ==References== Category:Balgriffin Category:James Hoban buildings Category:Buildings and structures in Dublin (city) Category:Houses in the Republic of Ireland ",
