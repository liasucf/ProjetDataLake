    "text": "The Renault Sport Series (formerly known as World Series by Renault) is a motor racing series. The series currently consists of the Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0, and used to contain the Renault Sport Trophy and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series. The F4 Eurocup 1.6 was made part of the World Series in 2010, but was then folded for 2011.http://italiaracing.net/notizia.asp?id=29301&cat;=58 The flagship for the Renault Sport Series from its beginning to 2015 was the Formula Renault 3.5 Series (often referred to as simply World Series by Renault or simply WSR). It became the Formula V8 3.5 in 2016, when Renault Sport retired its backing. ==History== Renault started the Formula Renault V6 Eurocup in 2003, as a support series in Eurosport's Super Racing Weekends (ETCC and FIA GT Championship). The series ran with Tatuus chassis and a Nissan 3.5 L V6 engine. In 2005, Renault left the Super Racing Weekend and started the World Series by Renault and the Formula Renault 3.5 Series, merging both the World Series by Nissan (whose engine contract had finished) and Renault V6 Eurocup. The Dallara chassis was retained, while the Renault V6 was improved to 425 PS. Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup and the Eurocup M\u00e9gane Trophy also joined the series in 2005 to support the main FR3.5 series. At the end of July 2015, Renault Sport announced it would be withdrawing its backing to the Formula Renault 3.5 from 2016 onwards, handing the control of the series to co- organiser RPM. However, Renault Sport also said it would continue the Renault Sport Series with the Renault Sport Trophy and the Formula Renault 2.0 Eurocup. ==Champions== ===Current series=== ====Eurocup Formula Renault 2.0==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; !Season !Champion !Team Champion |- ! 2005 | Kamui Kobayashi | SG Formula |- ! 2006 | Filipe Albuquerque | JD Motorsport |- ! 2007 | Brendon Hartley | Epsilon RedBull |- ! 2008 | Valtteri Bottas | SG Formula |- ! 2009 | Albert Costa | Epsilon Euskadi |- ! 2010 | Kevin Korjus | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2011 | Robin Frijns | Koiranen Motorsport |- ! 2012 | Stoffel Vandoorne | Josef Kaufmann Racing |- ! 2013 | Pierre Gasly | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2014 | Nyck de Vries | Koiranen GP |- ! 2015 | Jack Aitken | Josef Kaufmann Racing |- ! 2016 | Lando Norris | Josef Kaufmann Racing |- ! 2017 | Sacha Fenestraz | R-ace GP |- ! 2018 | Max Fewtrell | R-ace GP |- ! 2019 | Oscar Piastri | R-ace GP |} ===Former series=== ===Formula Renault 3.5 Series=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size: 85%; !Season !Champion !Team Champion |- ! 2005 | Robert Kubica | Epsilon Euskadi |- ! 2006 | Alx Danielsson | Interwetten.com |- ! 2007 | \u00c1lvaro Parente | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2008 | | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2009 | Bertrand Baguette | |- ! 2010 | Mikhail Aleshin | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2011 | Robert Wickens | Carlin |- ! 2012 | Robin Frijns | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2013 | Kevin Magnussen | DAMS |- ! 2014 | Carlos Sainz Jr. | DAMS |- ! 2015 | Oliver Rowland | Fortec Motorsports |} ====Eurocup M\u00e9gane Trophy==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; !Season !Champion !Team Champion |- ! 2005 | Jan Heylen | |- ! 2006 | | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2007 | Pedro Petiz | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2008 | Micha\u00ebl Rossi | Tech 1 Racing |- ! 2009 | Mike Verschuur | TDS Racing |- ! 2010 | Nick Catsburg | TDS Racing |- ! 2011 | Stefano Comini | Oregon Team |- ! 2012 | Albert Costa | Oregon Team |- ! 2013 | Mirko Bortolotti | Oregon Team |} ===F4 Eurocup 1.6=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; !Season !Champion |- ! 2010 | |} ===Eurocup Clio=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; !Season !Champion |- ! 2011 | Nicolas Milan |- ! 2012 | |- ! 2013 | Josh Files |- ! 2014 | Oscar Nogu\u00e9s |} ====Renault Sport Trophy==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; !Season !Endurance Champion !Elite/Pro Champion !Prestige/Am Champion !Team Champion |- ! 2015 | | Andrea Pizzitola | | Oregon Team |- ! 2016 | | | Fabian Schiller | |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * World Series by Renault (new website) * Renault Sport Series Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2005 ",
