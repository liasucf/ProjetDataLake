    "text": "Little Greek Fresh Grill, formerly Little Greek, is a chain of fast-casual Greek-style restaurants that was founded in Florida by Estonian immigrant Sigrid Bratic in 2004. As of April 2020, there were 44 locations across six states. ==History== Bratic visited Florida in search of an opportunity to start her own business, and while working in the restaurant business, discovered a small Greek restaurant named Happy Greek for sale in Palm Harbor. On June 1, 2004, Bratic purchased the then-struggling business. The inaugural location of the original restaurant was in 320 East Lake Road in Palm Harbor, and was later renamed \"Little Greek.\" Following Bratic's changes, the restaurant increased its sales. Nick Vojnovic invested in the Little Greek concept following his twelve-year corporate presidency of Beef O'Brady's. On April 27, 2011, Bratic and Vojnovic signed a partnership agreement, with a goal of opening franchised Little Greek restaurants throughout the Tampa Bay area and across the US. In April 2012, the company opened a more upgraded prototype restaurant with an updated look. As of February 2015, there were 19 locations across Florida, Arkansas and Texas. In 2015, the company commissioned a study that recommended a name change, and the company became Little Greek Fresh Grill. The company also started looking for sites in Louisville for its first restaurant in Kentucky. By April 2020, the company operated 44 restaurants in Arkansas, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Ohio, and Texas. Also in April, the company waived franchise fees and starting selling its wholesale purchases of grocery staples including fresh chicken and toilet paper directly to customers, to keep employees during the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Fare and operations== The company provides Americanized versions of Greek- style food, and bills itself as having a \u201cGreek-style menu.\u201d Food is ordered at the counter, and there's an open galley kitchen. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Greek-American culture in Florida Category:Restaurant chains in the United States Category:Greek-American cuisine Category:2004 establishments in Florida Category:Restaurants established in 2004 Category:Pinellas County, Florida ",
