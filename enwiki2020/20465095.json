Of these, 135 were directly elected from single member constituencies using the two-round system, while 15 seats were reserved for the country's Ecological Movement. Provincial and district councils were elected at the same time. Polls opened at 6 am Uzbekistan Time (0100 UTC). and closed at 8 pm UZT (1500 UTC).. The Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party (O'zlidep) was reconfirmed as the largest single party in the Legislative Chamber, with 55 deputies. The other parties permitted to participate in the elections were the People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (32 deputies), the Uzbekistan National Revival Democratic Party (Milliy Tiklanish, 31 deputies) and the Justice Social Democratic Party (Adolat, 19 deputies).. The elections were monitored by over 270 observers from 36 countries and representatives of four international missions. The election monitoring arm of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) did not send a full mission, saying none of its earlier recommendations had been implemented:. an OSCE assessment mission observed voting at several polling places, but did not do comprehensive vote monitoring.. Veronica Szente Goldston, Human Rights Watch Advocacy Director for Europe and Central Asia, said the pre-election situation in Uzbekistan has been marked by intense repression by the government: \"Human rights are violated everywhere around the country, there is no political competition, all the parties that are running for this election are supporting the government.\" ==Campaign== A candidate for election had to belong to a registered party and collect a minimum of 40,000 signatures. Several opposition politicians have alleged that all candidates also had to be approved by the government before they would be placed on the ballot. The four registered parties were:. *Adolat (Justice Social Democratic Party), with 123 candidates and 10 seats in the outgoing legislative chamber; *Milliy Tiklanish (Uzbekistan National Revival Democratic Party), with 125 candidates and 29 seats in the outgoing legislative chamber;Including 18 seats from the former Self-Sacrifice National Democratic Party, which merged in 2008. *People's Democratic Party of Uzbekistan (PDP), with 134 candidates and 28 seats in the outgoing legislative chamber; *Uzbekistan Liberal Democratic Party (O'zlidep), with 135 candidates and 41 seats in the outgoing legislative chamber. The election campaign consisted of 15- to 20-minute television programs each day for four days, as well as a second program called \"Election \u2013 Mirror of Democracy\". Transcripts from these shows were reprinted in newspapers, and billboards also appeared touting the upcoming choice that Uzbeks had to make. The four parties have publicly criticized each other, mainly over social policy, while praising President Islam Karimov's achievements. Freedom House, a US-based human rights organization, says the discussions appeared on television for the first time, which was a positive development, but that \"We have some evidence from Uzbek activists that those debates were scripted. And even if not \u2013 these parties don't know themselves who they are, they have no ideology.\" ===Ecological Movement=== The Ecological Movement of Uzbekistan elected its 15 legislators at a congress, also held on 27 December, one from each territorial subdivision of Uzbekistan (Republic of Karakalpakstan, provinces and Tashkent city) plus one member from the Executive Committee of the Central Council of the Ecological Movement.
