    "text": "Tullio Pinelli (24 June 1908 - 7 March 2009) was an Italian screenwriter best known for his work on the Federico Fellini classics I Vitelloni, La Strada, La Dolce Vita and 8\u00bd. ==Biography== Born in Turin, Piedmont, Italy, Pinelli began his career as a civil lawyer but spent his free time working in the theatre as a playwright. He was descended from a long line of Italian patriots; his great-uncle General Ferdinando Pinelli quashed the bandit revolt in Calabria following Italian unification.Tullio Kezich, Federico Fellini: His Life and Work, Faber and Faber, Inc., 2006, p. 96. He met Fellini in a Rome kiosk in 1946 while they were reading opposite pages of the same newspaper. \"Meeting each other\", explained Pinelli, \"was a creative lightning bolt. We spoke the same language from the start... We were fantasizing about a screenplay that would be the exact opposite of what was fashionable then: the story of a very shy and modest office worker who discovered he can fly; so he flaps his arms and escapes out the window. It certainly wasn't Italian neorealism. But the idea never went anywhere either.\"Kezich, Federico Fellini: His Life and Work, p. 96 The anecdote about flying presages the opening scene of 8\u00bd (1963) in which the protagonist, a prominent film director, who dreams of escape by flying out of his car caught in a traffic jam. Pinelli died at the age of 100 on 7 March 2009 in Rome. He was married to the French-born actress Madeleine Lebeau, who had roles in 8\u00bd and Casablanca (1942). ==Selected filmography== * The Opium Den (1947) * Symphony of Love (1954) * The Lovers of Manon Lescaut (1954) * Mano rubata (1989) ==References== == Bibliography == * Pinelli, Tullio (2008).
