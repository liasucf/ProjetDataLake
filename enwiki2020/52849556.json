    "text": "The Chapel of the Transfiguration of Jesus or simply known as Our Saviour's or Tas-Salvatur is a Roman Catholic chapel located in the village of Qrendi in the south of Malta. ==History== This chapel is first mentioned in Pietro Dusina's report of his apostolic visit to Malta in 1575. Dusina visited the chapel on 9 February 1575, the first chapel he visited in Qrendi. Dusina mentions that the church had one altar but lacked any other objects necessary for services, including a rector and an income. However, Vincentius Aquilina, a nearby resident used to organise a service and vespers on the feast day. \"Chapel dedicated to Our Saviour\" , Qrendi parish. Retrieved on 12 January 2017. In 1618 the Bishop of Malta Baldassare Cagliares visited the church and mentions that it had an altar, a bell and a cemetery. Bishop Cagliares visited the church again in 1621. In 1636, his successor Miguel Juan Balaguer Camarasa visited the church as well and found it in the same condition as Bishop Cagliares describes. Some years later the same bishop, during an apostolic visit to the village (1656-1659) mentions that the chapel of Our Saviour as a new building, indicating that the original medieval chapel was demolished when a new one was built instead. In fact the present church was built in 1658 by Beneditto Camilleri. Ciantar, Noel. \"Il-knisja tas-Salvatur ~ Qrendi ~\", Kappelli Maltin. Retrieved on 12 January 2017.
