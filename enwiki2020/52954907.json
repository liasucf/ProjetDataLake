He is best known as the founder, lead singer and songwriter of the alternative rock band Bongo Botrako from their formation in 2007 until their indefinite hiatus announcement in 2015. ==Early life== Gin\u00e9, the second of three children, was born and raised in Tarragona, Spain, a city just south of Barcelona. His mother, Maria Jos\u00e9 de Lera, is a nurse, and his father, Josep Gin\u00e9, is a retired software developer. His younger sister, Alba, died at only ten months old from a heart malfunction, when Gin\u00e9 was 3. Some of his songs focus on the loss of his sister. Gin\u00e9 grew up listening to his older sister, Celia, practise the piano for hours daily, but even though she and his parents tried to encourage him to play an instrument since he was young, he was reluctant for many years. At the age of 13, Celia gave him a cassette of a friend's punk rock band and he was so fascinated that he bought an electric guitar and started learning to play it and sing. He taught himself imitating rock, grunge and punk rock bands such as Nirvana, The Offspring, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Extremoduro. Gin\u00e9 attended Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona, but after four years taking classes in Audiovisual Communication, he dropped out to focus entirely on his musical career. ==Career== ===Extracto de L\u00fapulo (2003\u20132009)=== Gin\u00e9 joined punk rock band Extracto de L\u00fapulo in 2003 while in high school. He wrote his first songs for this band but he soon realised that some of the songs he wrote didn't fit in the genre, so he kept them apart. In late 2007, Gin\u00e9 decided to create his own band with all those songs and named it Bongo Botrako. In 2008 Gin\u00e9 recorded Extracto de L\u00fapulo's first album, El agua pa los peces, which was released in the following year. However, after almost two years running both bands at the same time, Bongo Botrako had become way more successful than Extracto de L\u00fapulo and many gigs started to coincide, so in 2009 Gin\u00e9 left Extracto de L\u00fapulo to focus entirely on Bongo Botrako.

He programmed the drums and performed all the rest of instruments himself. After passing the demo around, Gin\u00e9 quickly recruited eight more musicians and they started performing live in March 2008. Gin\u00e9 wrote the song \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" (also known as \"Chipir\u00f3n\") in 2010 as part of Bongo Botrako's first album, Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol, which was released on September 27, 2010. The song became very popular in Spain after the men's national basketball team players, including Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol and Ricky Rubio, took the habit of singing it before every game in the EuroBasket 2011 Championship, which they eventually won. In September 2011, \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" peaked at #12 on the Spain Songs chart and #2 on the iTunes Spain Songs chart. The song accumulates more than 15 million streamings on YouTube and more than 7 million streamings on Spotify, which ultimately makes it Gin\u00e9's most popular song by far.

Gin\u00e9 and his bandmates embarked on an extensive tour that took them to eleven European countries, reaching particular success in the Netherlands, where they played at major festivals such as Lowlands 2014, Parkpop 2015 and Zwarte Cross 2015. The band's first and only live album, Punk Parranda, was released on November 3, 2014. They recorded it performing to a crowd of more than 60,000 people at Vi\u00f1a Rock Festival 2014 in Villarrobledo, Spain. On October 13, 2015, Bongo Botrako announced an indefinite hiatus and a six-date farewell tour. Gin\u00e9 explained that he felt exhausted after eight years of non-stop touring and noted that the band had lost the enthusiasm. However, he said he would continue to write songs and he left the door open to create a new music project in the future. Bongo Botrako performed their last and 500th concert in Gin\u00e9's hometown Tarragona on December 26, 2015. ==Personal life== Gin\u00e9 has been an active supporter of human rights movements throughout his career as a musician. In 2012 and 2013, he performed two Amnesty International benefit shows in Barcelona. He also included an Amnesty International quote in the music video for Bongo Botrako's song \"Revoltosa\" in 2012. Gin\u00e9 claimed to have had a life-changing experience in 2015 when he stayed six weeks in the Peruvian Amazon rainforest taking ayahuasca and other ancestral medicinal plants with a shaman. In May 2016, Gin\u00e9 took an Accelerated Freefall training to become a solo skydiver. When he's not touring or songwriting, some of his main occupations are travelling, photography and skydiving. ==Discography== ===Extracto de L\u00fapulo=== * El agua pa los peces (2009) \u2013 guitar, vocals ===Bongo Botrako=== * Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol (2010) \u2013 lead vocals * Revoltosa (2012) \u2013 lead vocals * Punk Parranda (2014) \u2013 lead vocals, guitar ==References== ==External links== * Bongo Botrako's official website * Uri Gin\u00e9 on Twitter Category:Living people Category:Spanish rock singers Category:Alternative rock singers Category:Rock en Espa\u00f1ol musicians Category:Catalan singers Category:People from Tarragona Category:1986 births Category:21st-century Spanish singers ",
