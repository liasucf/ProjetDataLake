Security Council authorized a no-fly zone over Libya after the Battle of Ajdabiya, and the NATO-led coalition launched air strikes against the Libyan Air Force. After Gaddafi loyalists gained the upper hand the air strikes intensified in what some interpreted as a move towards decapitation strikes while France, Italy, and the United Kingdom sent military advisors to the National Transitional Council. Eventually the TNC gained the upper hand in the conflict, captured the capital city of Tripoli, and achieved diplomatic recognition from the United Nations.
