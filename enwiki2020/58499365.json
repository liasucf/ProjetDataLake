    "text": "Bathymetry Pako Guyot (also known as Caiwei or Pallada after the .) is a guyot in the Pacific Ocean, which reaches a depth of . It has dimensions of and features a summit plateau wide with a shape corresponding to an irregular rectangle-triangle. It is part of the Magellan Seamounts. The seamount was volcanically active during the Cretaceous-Paleogene 91.3 million years ago and may have formed on a hotspot together with Ioah Guyot and Vlinder Guyot; a late phase of volcanism may have taken place in the Paleocene-Eocene. Volcanic rocks dredged from Pako are of sodium-potassium hawaiitic and trachybasaltic composition and geochemically resemble these erupted by the Rarotonga hotspot. Corals and squat lobsters have been found on the seamount. Ophiuroids, most of which are symbiotic with corals and sponges, live on the seamount and its flanks, and the seamount features substantial deposits of ferromanganese and phosphorite ores. In 2014, China obtained a contract with the International Seabed Authority allowing for exploration of Pako Guyot for cobalt crusts. == See also == * Ita Mai Tai == References == Category:Seamounts of the Pacific Ocean Category:Cretaceous volcanoes ",
