The government considered two proposals. The first proposed a merger of the Guyra Shire and the Armidale Dumaresq Shire merge to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 30,000. The alternative, proposed by the Armidale Dumaresq Council on 1 March 2016, was for an amalgamation of the Armidale Dumaresq, Guyra, Uralla and Walcha councils. Following an independent review, on 12 May 2016 the Minister for Local Government announced that the merger with the Armidale Dumaresq Shire would proceed with immediate effect. ==References== == External links == *Australian Bureau of Statistics web site *Income Fact Sheet from the Australian Bureau of Statistics Category:Former local government areas of New South Wales Category:New England (New South Wales) Category:2016 disestablishments in Australia ",
