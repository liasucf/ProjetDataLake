    "text": "The Northwest Conference (NWC) is an athletic conference which competes in the NCAA's Division III. Member teams are located in the states of Oregon and Washington. ==History== Griswold Stadium at Lewis & Clark McCulloch Stadium at Willamette The NWC was formed in 1926, making it one of the oldest athletics conferences in the western United States. For 60 years, the Northwest Conference sponsored sports exclusively for men, but in 1984 it joined with the Women's Conference of Independent Colleges to become the Northwest Conference of Independent Colleges, shortening the name to its current moniker in 1996 when it joined the NCAA. The charter members included Willamette University, Pacific University, Whitman College, the College of Puget Sound (now the University of Puget Sound), Linfield College and the College of Idaho. In 1931, Albany College joined, left in 1938, and re-joined in 1949 using its present name of Lewis & Clark College. Pacific Lutheran University was added in 1965, and Whitworth University in 1970. In 1978, the College of Idaho dropped out of the conference. Whitworth also left in 1984, but then returned in 1988. In 1996, George Fox University joined when the conference moved to the NCAA and Puget Sound re-joined in that same year since 1948. From 2006 to 2010, Menlo College was also a part of the conference as an associate member in football. The College of Idaho dropped out in 1978 and is now a member of the NAIA's Cascade Collegiate Conference. Whitworth left the NWC in 1984 but returned in 1988. George Fox University and Seattle University joined the conference in 1997. Seattle dropped out again in 1999 to become members of NCAA Division II.http://static.psbin.com/4/6/wfos4lctbf4dq3/NorthwestConferenceHistory.pdf Menlo College joined the conference in 2005 as a football-only member. ==Member schools== ===Current members=== The league currently has 9 full members: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Institution !Location !Nickname !Founded !Type !Enrollment !Joined |- |George Fox University |Newberg, Oregon |Bruins |1885 |Private/Quaker |4,140 |1996 |- |Lewis & Clark College |Portland, Oregon |Pioneers |1867 |Private/Non- sectarian |3,433 |1931, 19491 |- |Linfield College |McMinnville, Oregon |Wildcats |1849 |Private/Baptist |2,664 |1926 |- |Pacific University |Forest Grove, Oregon |Boxers |1849 |Private/United Church of Christ |3,302 |1926 |- |Pacific Lutheran University |Parkland, Washington |Lutes |1890 |Private/Lutheran |3,461 |1965 |- |University of Puget Sound |Tacoma, Washington |Loggers |1888 |Private/Non-sectarian |2,600 |1926, 19962 |- |Whitman College |Walla Walla, Washington |Blues |1859 |Private/Non- sectarian |1,475 |1926 |- |Whitworth University |Spokane, Washington |Pirates |1890 |Private/Presbyterian |2,886 |1970, 19883 |- |Willamette University |Salem, Oregon |Bearcats |1842 |Private/Non- sectarian |2,815 |1926 |} ;Notes # - Lewis & Clark left the NWC after the 1937\u201338 season, and later re-joined back in the 1949\u201350 season. # - Puget Sound left the NWC after the 1947\u201348 season, and later re-joined back in the 1996\u201397 season. # - Whitworth left the NWC after the 1983\u201384 season, and later re-joined back in the 1988\u201389 season. ===Former members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Location !Nickname !Founded !Type !Joined !Left !Current conference |- |College of Idaho |Caldwell, Idaho |Yotes |1891 |Private/Non- sectarian |1926 |1978 |Cascade (NAIA) |- |Seattle University |Seattle, Washington |Redhawks |1891 |Private/Jesuit |1997 |1999 |WAC (NCAA Division I) |} ===Former associate members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !Institution !Location !Nickname !Founded !Type !Joined !Left !Current conference !NWC sport |- |Menlo College\u2020 |Atherton, California |Oaks |1927 |Private/Non-sectarian |2006 |2010 |GSAC (NAIA) |football |} ===Membership timeline=== DateFormat = yyyy ImageSize = width:1000 height:auto barincrement:20 Period = from:1926 till:2016 TimeAxis = orientation:horizontal PlotArea = right:20 left:0 bottom:50 top:5 #> to display a count on left side of graph, use \"left:20\" to suppress the count, use \"left:20\"<# Colors = id:barcolor value:rgb(0.99,0.7,0.7) id:line value:black id:bg value:white id:Full value:rgb(0.742,0.727,0.852) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports id:FullxF value:rgb(0.551,0.824,0.777) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in all sports except for football id:AssocF value:rgb(0.98,0.5,0.445) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member for football only id:AssocOS value:rgb(0.5,0.691,0.824) # Use this color to denote a team that is a member in some sports, but not all (consider identifying in legend or a footnote) id:OtherC1 value:rgb(0.996,0.996,0.699) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference id:OtherC2 value:rgb(0.988,0.703,0.383) # Use this color to denote a team that has moved to another conference where OtherC1 has already been used, to distinguish the two PlotData= width:15 textcolor:black shift:(5,-5) anchor:from fontsize:s bar:1 color:Full from:1926 till:1943 text:College of Idaho (1926-1978) bar:1 color:OtherC1 from:1943 till:1946 bar:1 color:Full from:1946 till:1978 bar:2 color:Full from:1926 till:1937 text:Linfield (1926-present) bar:2 color:FullxF from:1937 till:1938 bar:2 color:Full from:1938 till:1943 bar:2 color:OtherC1 from:1943 till:1946 bar:2 color:Full from:1946 till:1985 bar:2 color:FullxF from:1985 till:1997 bar:2 color:Full from:1997 till:end bar:3 color:Full from:1926 till:1943 text:Pacific (Ore.)
