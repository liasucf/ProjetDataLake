    "text": "The 2014\u201315 Oxford City FC of Texas season was the third season for the Beaumont, Texas-based professional indoor soccer franchise. Founded as the Texas Strikers in 2012, new ownership rebranded the team as Oxford City FC of Texas in July 2014. The team was led by Oxford City Football Club, Inc. CEO Thomas Anthony Guerriero and head coach Mariano Bollella. Texas was a Southern Division team in the Major Arena Soccer League and played their home games at Ford Arena in Beaumont, Texas. They finished the regular season with a 12\u20138 record then fell to the Dallas Sidekicks in the first round of the MASL playoffs. ==Season summary== Oxford City FC of Texas struggled to start the 2014\u201315 season, dropping their first two games, but rebounded with three consecutive wins. Although another loss briefly returned the team to .500, wins in their next two games gave the team more wins (5) by that point in the season than they earned in their two full seasons as the Texas Strikers (4). The team ended 2014 with a 7\u20134 record but with the new year (and the mid- season folding of Hidalgo La Fiera) came the addition of several former Hidalgo players and the replacement of head coach Chris \"Topper\" Cogan by former Hidalgo head coach Mariano Bollella. The team began 2015 with a three- game winning streak, including a road win against the Dallas Sidekicks, before losing 5 of their remaining 6 games, including home and road losses to Dallas. Their 12\u20138 record was good enough for third place in the Southern Division and qualified the Beaumont-based team for the playoffs. They faced rival Dallas at the Allen Event Center and lost 5\u20136, ending their playoff run. ==History== Ford Arena set up for soccer in December 2014. Playoff game at Dallas on March 1, 2015. The 2012\u201313 season was the first for the expansion Texas Strikers, Beaumont's first professional soccer team. The team struggled early on but split its final six regular season matches, finishing with a 3\u201313 record. The Strikers stumbled from the start of the 2013\u201314 season, dropping 15 consecutive matches. Only a home win over the Tulsa Revolution in their final match allowed them to earn a 1\u201315 record. The team did not qualify for post- season play. In May 2014, the Professional Arena Soccer League added six teams from the failed third incarnation of the Major Indoor Soccer League and reorganized as the Major Arena Soccer League. With the league expansion and reorganization, Texas moved from the Central division to the new Southern division. The other Southern teams for 2014\u201315 are Texas-based Brownsville Barracudas, Dallas Sidekicks, and Hidalgo La Fiera plus Mexico-based Monterrey Flash and Saltillo Rancho Seco. ==Off-field moves== In September 2014, the team announced that pre-game and post-game entertainment would be provided by a series of tribute bands. The announced acts include Back in Black, Rock and Roll Over, Light and Shade, and Van Hagar. On December 15, team owner Oxford City Football Club, Inc. announced that it had \"successfully come to terms to sell\" Oxford City FC of Texas to an unspecified \"Latin American group\", pending league approval. CEO Thomas Anthony Guerriero said that their \"complete focus as an organization needs to be\" on Oxford City F.C. which plays in Conference North, a division of Football Conference at Step 2 of the National League System and the sixth overall tier of the English football league system. The new owners were to have licensed the rights to use the \"Oxford City FC of Texas\" name through the end of the current MASL season. The sale was not completed before the end of the season and the announcement removed from the team's website. ==Schedule== ===Pre-season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | October 26 | 5:05pm | at Baton Rouge IFC | W 5\u20131 | 1\u20130 | Premier Soccer Indoor Complex | |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 1 | Sunday | November 2 | 3:05pm | Houston La Juve | W 15\u20134 | 2\u20130 | Ford Arena | |} ===Regular season=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"40\" | Game ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Day ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"110\" | Date ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"60\" | Kickoff ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Opponent ! colspan=\"2\" width=\"180\" | Results ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"240\" | Location ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"80\" | Attendance |- ! width=\"120\" | Score ! width=\"60\" | Record |-align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 1 | Saturday | November 8 | 7:05pm | Hidalgo La Fiera | L 7\u201313 | 0\u20131 | Ford Arena | 1,388 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 2 | Friday | November 14 | 7:05pm | at Tulsa Revolution | L 5\u20138 | 0\u20132 | Cox Business Center | 562 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 3 | Sunday | November 16 | 3:05pm | at Wichita B-52s | W 10\u20139 (SO) | 1\u20132 | Hartman Arena | 885 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 4 | Saturday | November 22 | 7:05pm | Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 9\u20137 | 2\u20132 | Ford Arena | 1,243 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 5 | Saturday | November 29 | 6:00pm | at Brownsville Barracudas | W 5\u20134 | 3\u20132 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 450 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 6 | Sunday | November 30 | 3:00pm | at Hidalgo La Fiera | L 7\u20139 | 3\u20133 | State Farm Arena | 426 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 7 | Saturday | December 6 | 7:05pm | Brownsville Barracudas | W 7\u20134 | 4\u20133 | Ford Arena | 1,079 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 8 | Saturday | December 13 | 7:05pm | Tulsa Revolution | W 17\u20134 | 5\u20133 | Ford Arena | 1,078 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 9 | Saturday | December 20 | 7:05pm | at Wichita B-52s | W 8\u20137 | 6\u20133 | Hartman Arena | 1,340 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 10 | Saturday | December 27 | 7:05pm | Dallas Sidekicks | L 4\u201315 | 6\u20134 | Ford Arena | 1,203 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 11 | Sunday | December 28 | 3:05pm | Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 16\u20138 | 7\u20134 | Ford Arena | 986 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 12 | Saturday | January 3 | 7:05pm | at Dallas Sidekicks | W 5\u20134 | 8\u20134 | Allen Event Center | 3,811 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 13 | Saturday | January 10 | 2:30pm | Brownsville Barracudas | W 8\u20134 | 9\u20134 | Ford Arena | 0 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 14 | Saturday | January 10 | 7:05pm | Brownsville Barracudas | W 10\u20133 | 10\u20134 | Ford Arena | 740 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 15 | Sunday | January 18 | 3:00pm | at Dallas Sidekicks | L 4\u20135 | 10\u20135 | Allen Event Center | 2,344 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 16 | Saturday | January 31 | 7:05pm | Monterrey Flash | L 2\u20135 | 10\u20136 | Ford Arena | 921 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 17 | Saturday | February 7 | 7:05pm | Dallas Sidekicks | L 2\u20137 | 10\u20137 | Ford Arena | 840 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#CCFFCC\" ! 18 | Friday | February 13 | 8:35pm | at Saltillo Rancho Seco | W 13\u20137 | 11\u20137 | Deportivo Rancho-Seco Saltillo | ? |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 19 | Sunday | February 15 | 5:05pm | at Monterrey Flash | L 3\u20135 | 11\u20138 | Arena Monterrey | 2,622 |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#FFCCCC\" ! 20 | Saturday | February 21 | 6:00pm | at Brownsville Barracudas | W 9\u20136 | 12\u20138 | Barracudas Sports Complex | 240 |} Originally scheduled for Saturday, November 15.
