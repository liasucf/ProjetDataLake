    "text": "A trigonometrical station in Hong Kong Mount Washington in New Hampshire A triangulation station, also known as a trigonometrical point, and sometimes informally as a trig, is a fixed surveying station, used in geodetic surveying and other surveying projects in its vicinity. The nomenclature varies regionally: they are generally known as trigonometrical or triangulation stations in North America, trig points in the United Kingdom, trig pillars in Ireland, trig stations or points in Australia and New Zealand, and trig beacons in South Africa; triangulation pillar is the more formal term for the concrete columns found in the UK, however, the informal term, \"trig point\", is used more often. ==Use== The station is usually set up by a government with known coordinates and elevation published. Many stations are located on hilltops for the purposes of visibility. A graven metal plate on the top of a pillar may provide a mounting point for a theodolite or reflector. Trigonometrical stations are grouped together to form a network of triangulation. Positions of all land boundaries, roads, railways, bridges and other infrastructure can be accurately located by the network, a task that is essential to the construction of modern infrastructure. Apart from the known stations set up by government, some temporary trigonometrical stations are set up near construction sites for monitoring the precision and progress of construction. Some trigonometrical stations use the Global Positioning System for convenience; however, the accuracy depends on factors such as ionospheric and tropospheric propagation delay errors. Although stations are no longer required for many surveying purposes, they remain useful to hikers as navigational aids. Trig points or Triangulation Pillars are another way of spotting the top of a mountain on a map. The symbol for a trig point is a small triangle. They are real concrete pillars that are placed at particular places which are usually the tops of hills or mountains. ==Stations worldwide== ===Australia=== A geodetic survey marker in Wellington, New Zealand A national geodetic survey and adjustment carried out in the early 1970s in Australia has left a legacy of trig stations, many consisting of a ground mark with a black quadripod supporting a white square disc above the ground mark. [clarification needed] ===Hong Kong=== Many trigonometrical stations were placed on hilltops around Hong Kong. They strongly resemble those used in other British colonial territories such as Australia, consisting of a white column topped with a black band. ===Japan=== Class 3 triangulation point in Shiroyama Park in Inagi, Tokyo In Japan, there are five classes of : ; :They are installed approximately every , with smaller ones (as necessary) about every . There are about 1000 throughout Japan. The pillars are on a side, and each pillar is anchored with two very large perpendicular rocks buried underground. ; :They are installed approximately every . There are about 5000 throughout Japan, and the pillars are on a side. Each pillar is anchored with a very large perpendicular rock buried underground. ; :There are about 32,000 installed throughout Japan, with one approximately every . The pillars are on a side, and each pillar is anchored with a large perpendicular rock buried underground. ; :They are installed approximately every , and there are about 69,000 throughout Japan. The pillars are on a side, and each pillar is anchored with a large perpendicular rock buried underground. ; :These markers were installed in 1899 and are the predecessors to the modern triangulation stations used in Japan today. They are generally not used anymore since the installation of the Class 1-4 stations. Some of them still exist at various locations throughout Japan. ===South Africa=== Lion's Head in Cape Town South Africa has a network of approximately 28,000 trig beacons, established by the Chief Directorate: National Geo-spatial Information (historically known as the Trigonometrical Survey). These beacons are typically white-painted concrete pillars supporting black metal plates in a cross shape, installed on mountains, hills or tall buildings. ===Spain=== A triangulation pillar in Torre del Miguelete. Valencia (Spain) In Spain there are 11,000 triangulation stations, concrete buildings which typically consist of a cylinder 120 cm high and 30 cm diameter over a concrete cubic base. They were erected by the Instituto Geogr\u00e1fico Nacional, usually painted in white, and can be marked with a metallic label with the warning: \"The destruction of this sign is punishable by law.\" ===United Kingdom=== A trig point near Wootton Wawen, Warwickshire, England In the United Kingdom, trig points are typically concrete pillars and were erected by the Ordnance Survey. The process of placing trig points on top of prominent hills and mountains began in 1935 to assist in the accurate retriangulation of Great Britain. The Ordnance Survey's first trig point was erected on 18 April 1936 near Cold Ashby, Northamptonshire. In low-lying or flat areas some trig points are only a few metres above sea level and one is even at \u22121 m (near Little Ouse, Cambridgeshire, TL61718 89787).\"Happy 80th birthday to the trig pillar\" Ordnance Survey When all the trig points were in place, it was possible in clear weather to see at least two other trig points from any one trig point, but subsequent vegetation growth means that this is not necessarily still the case. Careful measurements of the angles between the lines-of-sight of the other trig points then allowed the construction of a system of triangles which could then be referenced back to a single baseline to construct a highly accurate measurement system that covered the entire country. Mam Tor Derbyshire England In most of the UK, trig points are truncated square concrete (occasionally stone) pyramids or obelisks tapering towards the top. On the top a brass plate with three arms and a central depression is fixed: it is used to mount and centre a theodolite used to take angular measurements to neighbouring trig points. A benchmark is usually set on the side, marked with the letters \"O S B M\" (Ordnance Survey Bench Mark) and the reference number of the trig point. Within and below the visible trig point, there are concealed reference marks whose National Grid References are precisely known. The standard trig point design is credited to Brigadier Martin Hotine (1898\u20131968), head of the Trigonometrical and Levelling Division of the Ordnance Survey. Many of them are now disappearing from the countryside as their function has largely been superseded by aerial photography and digital mapping using lasers and GPS.
