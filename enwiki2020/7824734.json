To further promote \"Hood Boy\", Fantasia performed it at the 2011 Artscape festival and the 2018 Essence Music Festival. ==Background and release== American rapper Big Boi (pictured in 2012) co-wrote \"Hood Boy\" and contributes several verses. Due to the lukewarm commercial performance of \u2013 and mixed critical response to \u2013 Fantasia's 2004 debut pop album (Free Yourself), she and J Records decided to record more R&B; and hip hop for her second and eponymous album (2006). In her biography of Fantasia, Liz Sonneborn wrote that the singer \"purposely cultivated a more daring sound\" on her follow-up record.Sonneborn (2008): p. 39 Fantasia attributed the change in her musical style as an escape from her painful past, which was featured on the American reality competition series American Idol: \"I'm not sad anymore; I'm not hurting anymore. I'm able to show people what music is to me.\" \"Hood Boy\" was written by Johnta Austin, Frank DeVol, Holland-Dozier-Holland, Anthony McIntyre, Antwan Patton, and produced by Austin and the Canadian production team Tone Mason.

The song was released as an audio CD, which includes the radio edit and instrumental, and as a digital download.

Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called it a modern interpretation of Ike & Tina Turner's music, and AXS's Kareem Gantt described the track as \"a buffet of neo-soul mixed in with hip-hop\". Slant Magazine Sal Cinquemani cited the song as an example of the album's emphasis on production over vocals. \"Hood Boys lyrics explore Fantasia's attraction to thugs, and Erlewine compared the song to Destiny's Child's 2004 single \"Soldier\".

Clover Hope of Billboard praised Fantasia's connection to the song, calling the tracks on more mature subjects \"right up [the singer's] alley\". However, Allison Steward of The Washington Post criticized \"Hood Boy\" as \"credibility-shredding\". The song appeared on several United States Billboard charts.

It was filmed in Crenshaw, Los Angeles; when describing the location, Fantasia said: \"If you want to find a 'hood boy, you got to go to the 'hood to find one, and no better place to do it than Crenshaw.\" In the video, Fantasia performs in front of a pink neon sign displaying her name; Michael Slezak compared the scene to Roxie Hart in the 1972 musical, Chicago.
