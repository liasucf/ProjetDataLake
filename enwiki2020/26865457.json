    "text": "Isaac \"Ike\" John Fowler (27 August 1894 \u2013 17 June 1981) was a Welsh dual-code international rugby union, and professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1910s and 1920s. He played representative level rugby union (RU) for Wales, and at club level for Ammanford RFC and Llanelli RFC, as a scrum-half, and representative level rugby league (RL) for Wales, and the Other Nationalities, and at club level for Batley (vice-captain), as a . ==Background== Fowler was born in 1894 in Pantyffynnon, a small village in Carmarthenshire, Wales he worked as a coal miner, and a foreman, and he died aged 86 in Batley, West Yorkshire, England. ==Rugby career== Fowler first played rugby for Tycroes, a club in the neighbouring village. He progressed to Ammanford before being selected by first class Welsh team, Llanelli. On the recommencement of rugby after the First World War, Llanelli faced two matches against New Zealand teams, the Larkhill depot of the New Zealand Army and the New Zealand Maoris. Fowler played in both matches. In 1919, Fowler won his first and only rugby union international call-up, when he was one of thirteen new caps to represent Wales against a New Zealand Army team. The Wales team lost 3-6, but before the country's next international match, Fowler turned professional, by joining rugby league team Batley. Such was the resentment caused by turning professional, Fowler was not only banned for life from playing rugby union at any level; a standard punishment, but he also had to wait until a 1975 'amnesty' to receive his international cap. Fowler had a long career at Batley and secured two further international caps. His first came in 1921, when he was chosen to play for the Other Nationalities team to face England. Protests were made to recognise the team as a Wales squad as the entire 13 members were all Welsh by birth, but the request was rejected. On 12 April 1926 he was selected to play for the actual Wales rugby league team, against England at Pontypridd. Fowler played in Batley's 13-7 victory over Wigan in the 1923\u201324 Championship Final during the 1923\u201324 season, at The Cliff, Broughton, Salford on Saturday 3 May 1924, in front of a crowd of 13,729. Fowler played in Batley's 0-5 defeat by York in the 1922\u201323 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1922\u201323 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 2 December 1922, in front of a crowd of 33,719, and played in the 8-9 defeat by Wakefield Trinity in the 1924\u201325 Yorkshire County Cup Final during the 1924\u201325 season at Headingley Rugby Stadium, Leeds on Saturday 22 November 1924, in front of a crowd of 25,546. ==Officiating career== Ike Fowler was the touch judge for Castleford's 11\u20138 victory over Huddersfield in the 1934\u201335 Challenge Cup Final at Wembley Stadium, London on Saturday 4 May 1935, in front of a crowd of 39,000. == Bibliography == * * == References == Category:1894 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Ammanford RFC players Category:Batley Bulldogs players Category:Dual-code rugby internationals Category:Llanelli RFC players Category:Other Nationalities rugby league team players Category:People from Carmarthenshire Category:Rugby league halfbacks Category:Rugby union scrum-halves Category:Wales international rugby union players Category:Wales national rugby league team players Category:Welsh rugby league players Category:Welsh rugby union players ",
