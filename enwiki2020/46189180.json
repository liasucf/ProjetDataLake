    "text": "St Stephen's, Twickenham is a Church of England church on Richmond Road in East Twickenham in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames. Its vicar is Jez Barnes. The congregation dates from 1720 when a chapel was founded on what was to become Montpelier Road. The building, which dates from 1874 and is Grade II listed, was designed by T. M. Lockwood and T. H. Mawson. The chancel was added in 1885 and the tower in 1907. Most of the stained glass windows are by Alfred Octavius Hemming (1843\u20131907). The organ, installed in 1889, is one of the best preserved Henry Willis & Sons organs in London. Services are held on Sunday mornings at 9.00 am, 10.30 am and 6.00 pm. St. Stephen's School, Twickenham, a mixed, state-run, Church of England primary school on Winchester Road, is affiliated with St. Stephen's Church and regularly holds events there. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:1720 establishments in England Category:19th-century Church of England church buildings Category:Anglican congregations established in the 18th century Category:Churches completed in 1907 Category:Churches in Twickenham Twickenham Category:Diocese of London Category:Grade II listed churches in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames ",
