    "text": "The flag of the state of Michigan depicts the state's coat of arms on a dark blue field, as set forth by Michigan state law.Act 209 of 1911 Coat-of-Arms and State Flag in Michigan Compiled Laws (The Governor has a variant of the flag with a white instead of blue field.) The state has an official flag month from June 14 through July 14. ==Design== The state coat of arms depicts a blue shield, upon which the sun rises over a lake and peninsula, and a man with a raised hand representing peace and holding a long gun representing the fight for state and nation as a frontier state.History of the Great Seal As supporters, the elk and moose are derived from the Hudson's Bay Company coat of arms, and depict great animals of Michigan. The bald eagle represents the United States which formed the state of Michigan from the Northwest Territory.www.netstate.com The design features three Latin mottos. From top- to-bottom they are: #On red ribbon: \"E Pluribus Unum,\" means \"Out of many, one,\" a motto of the United States. #On light blue shield: \"Tuebor,\" means \"I will defend.\" #On white ribbon: \"Si Qu\u00e6ris Peninsulam Am\u0153nam Circumspice,\" means \"If you seek a pleasant peninsula, look about you.\" (The official state motto). ==History== The present flag, adopted in 1911, is the third state flag. The first flag featured a portrait of Michigan's first governor, Stevens T. Mason, on one side and the state coat of arms on the other side. The first flag is completely lost, and no images of it exist, as far as anyone knows. The second flag, adopted in 1865, displayed the state coat of arms on one side and the United States coat of arms on the other. The North American Vexillological Association (NAVA), in its 2001 survey of U.S. state, U.S. territorial, and Canadian provincial flags rated the current Michigan flag 59th out of 72 flags evaluated. The survey respondents gave an average score of just 3.46 out of a possible 10 points. In November 2016, a bill was introduced in the Michigan state legislature by Michigan State Senator Steven Bieda that would have provided for a flag commission to head up a public design contest to change the current state flag, but it was ultimately unsuccessful.http://www.legislature.mi.gov/%28S%28gf2eardsmyh4kmtu4xwkw2em%29%29/mileg.aspx?page=getobject&objectName;=2016-SB-1160 If the bill had passed, however, the current state flag would have been discontinued in January 2019 and replaced with a new design.https://archive.is/o/qG4Ph/www.legislature.mi.gov/documents/2015-2016/billintroduced/Senate/pdf/2016-SIB-1160.pdf ==Pledge== Michigan's pledge of allegiance to the state flag was written by Harold G. Coburn and was officially adopted in 1972. ==See also== *Flags of the Governors of the U.S. States *State of Michigan **Symbols of the State of Michigan ***Great Seal of the State of Michigan ==References== ==External links== *The State of Michigan **The Michigan State Flag Michigan Category:Symbols of Michigan Category:Flags of Michigan Michigan ",
