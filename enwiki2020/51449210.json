Maxwell-Lefroy at Muzzafarpur. His early work was in examining the natural parasites of bollworm in Surat. In 1905, he moved to the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa and in 1906 he obtained a transfer to the Madras Agricultural Department on the recommendation of Lefroy and in 1908 he transferred to Madras Agricultural College, Coimbatore and became a Senior Entomological Assistant to C.A.

In 1915-1916 he gave a talk on agricultural entomology at the Madras Exhibition of Arts and Industries of South India. In 1915 he was asked to examine an attack of thrips on rice crops. He sent specimens and they were described by C.B. Williams as Thrips oryzae. He decided that he needed to gain expertise on this group. The idea of pursuing a Ph.D. from Stanford University was obtained from K. Kunhikannan, his entomologist colleague in Mysore. He applied in 1922 but did not follow up and he applied again in 1924 but did not join again. He renewed his application and joined only in Summer, 1927.

T.V. Ramakrishna Ayyar (seated leftmost) with other entomologists at the 1917 meeting Ayyar was a specialist on the thrips and he described numerous new genera and species.
