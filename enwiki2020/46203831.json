On 31 January 2015 a \"unified command\" was established to oversee counterterrorism operations east of the Suez Canal. Osama Askar, commander of the Third Army, was promoted to lieutenant general and given command of the new \"unified command.\" Askar will also retain his seat on the SCAF. Askar's former deputy, Muhammad Abdullah, has been appointed commander, and Tarek Anwar Helal the chief of staff, of the Third Army. In May 2018 the Third Army comprised the 4th Armoured Division; the 19th Infantry Division, which included an armoured brigade, but whose remaining troops might have been un-mechanized infantry; the 23rd Mechanized Division; and the 11th Armoured Brigade.
