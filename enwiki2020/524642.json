In the third century it became the seat of a bishopCouncils were held here in 578 and 1147. and a provincial capital of the Roman Empire. In the 5th century it received a cathedral. In the late 11th-early 12th century the existing communities were included inside a new line of walls built by the feudal counts of Auxerre. Bourgeois activities accompanied the traditional land and wine cultivations starting from the twelfth century, and Auxerre developed into a commune with a Town Hall of its own. The Burgundian city, which became part of France under King Louis XI, suffered during the Hundred Years' War and the Wars of Religion. In 1567 it was captured by the Huguenots, and many of the Catholic edifices were damaged. The medieval ramparts were demolished in the 18th century. In the 19th century numerous heavy infrastructures were built, including a railway station, a psychiatric hospital and the courts, and new quarters were developed on the right bank of the Yonne. Up until the early 20th century, Auxerre was one of the most prosperous cities in the departement. But the local authorities of that period refused the railway that was subsequently set in the then village of Migennes, and signed the economic decline of the town. ==Climate== ==Main sights== A view of Auxerre's old town with Saint-Germain Abbey in the background.
