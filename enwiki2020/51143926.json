    "text": "The Zimbabwe cricket team toured Sri Lanka in June and July 2017 to play one Test match and five One Day Internationals (ODIs). Originally, the schedule was for two Test matches and three ODIs. It was Zimbabwe's first tour to Sri Lanka since January 2002. All the matches were played as day games. Zimbabwe won the ODI series 3\u20132, their first ever series win against Sri Lanka. It was their first away series win since 2009 and the first away series win against a Test nation since defeating Bangladesh in 2001. It was also Zimbabwe's first win in a five-match series away from home. Zimbabwe's captain, Graeme Cremer, said the victory was \"the pinnacle of my career\". In contrast, Sri Lanka's captain, Angelo Mathews, said the defeat was \"one of the lowest points in my career\" and stepped down as captain of the team in all three formats the following day. Dinesh Chandimal was later named as the new Test captain. Sri Lanka went on to win the one-off Test match by 4 wickets. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=2|ODIs |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Dinesh Chandimal (c, wk) * Dushmantha Chameera * Niroshan Dickwella * Vishwa Fernando * Asela Gunaratne * Danushka Gunathilaka * Rangana Herath * Dimuth Karunaratne * Lahiru Kumara * Suranga Lakmal * Angelo Mathews * Kusal Mendis * Dilruwan Perera * Lakshan Sandakan * Upul Tharanga | * Graeme Cremer (c) * Ryan Burl * Regis Chakabva * Tendai Chatara * Craig Ervine * Hamilton Masakadza * Wellington Masakadza * Peter Moor (wk) * Christopher Mpofu * Natsai Mushangwe * Carl Mumba * Tarisai Musakanda * Sikandar Raza * Donald Tiripano * Malcolm Waller * Nathan Waller * Sean Williams | * Angelo Mathews (c) * Amila Aponso * Dushmantha Chameera * Akila Dananjaya * Niroshan Dickwella (wk) * Asitha Fernando * Asela Gunaratne * Danushka Gunathilaka * Wanidu Hasaranga * Chamara Kapugedera * Lahiru Madushanka * Lasith Malinga * Kusal Mendis * Nuwan Pradeep * Lakshan Sandakan * Upul Tharanga | * Graeme Cremer (c) * Ryan Burl * Tendai Chatara * Chamu Chibhabha * Craig Ervine * Hamilton Masakadza * Wellington Masakadza * Solomon Mire * Peter Moor (wk) * Christopher Mpofu * Carl Mumba * Tarisai Musakanda * Richard Ngarava * Sikandar Raza * Donald Tiripano * Malcolm Waller * Sean Williams |} ==ODI series== ===1st ODI=== ===2nd ODI=== ===3rd ODI=== ===4th ODI=== ===5th ODI=== ==Test match== ===Only Test=== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2017 in Sri Lankan cricket Category:2017 in Zimbabwean cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2017 Category:Zimbabwean cricket tours of Sri Lanka ",
