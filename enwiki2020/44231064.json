    "text": "The 2015 European Tour is the seventh edition of the Race to Dubai and the 44th season of golf tournaments since the European Tour officially began in 1972. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy defended the Race to Dubai, winning the title for the third time. He was also named Golfer of the Year. South Korea's An Byeong-hun was the Sir Henry Cotton Rookie of the Year. ==Schedule== The table below shows the 2015 European Tour schedule which began with two events in late 2014. There were many changes from the previous season. There were six additions to the schedule, made up of four new tournaments: the True Thailand Classic, the Shenzhen International, the Saltire Energy Paul Lawrie Matchplay, and the AfrAsia Bank Mauritius Open; the Hero Indian Open, which was co- sanctioned by the European Tour for the first time; and the return of the European Open, which was last played in 2009. Seven events were lost from the schedule: the Volvo World Match Play Championship and Volvo Golf Champions, as a result of Volvo reducing their sponsorship commitments; the Nelson Mandela Championship; the NH Collection Open; The Championship at Laguna National; the Wales Open, as a 15-year deal with Celtic Manor Resort came to an end; and the Perth International, which wasn't played in 2015 due to rescheduling from October to February. In March, the tour confirmed that the British Masters, last held in 2008, was also being revived and added to the schedule. Later in the month, the Madeira Islands Open was cancelled due to persistent heavy rain; it was later rescheduled to the end of July, opposite the Paul Lawrie Matchplay. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%\" !Dates !Tournament !Host country !Winner !OWGR points !Notes |- |4\u20137 Dec |Nedbank Golf Challenge |South Africa | Danny Willett (2) |align=center|38 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |- |11\u201314 Dec |Alfred Dunhill Championship |South Africa | Branden Grace (5) |align=center|22 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |- |8\u201311 Jan |South African Open Championship |South Africa | Andy Sullivan (1) |align=center|32 |Co-sanctioned with the Sunshine Tour |- |15\u201318 Jan |Abu Dhabi HSBC Golf Championship |United Arab Emirates | Gary Stal (1) |align=center|50 | |- |21\u201324 Jan |Commercial Bank Qatar Masters |Qatar | Branden Grace (6) |align=center|42 | |- |29 Jan \u2013 1 Feb |Omega Dubai Desert Classic |United Arab Emirates | Rory McIlroy (10) |align=center|50 | |- |5\u20138 Feb |Maybank Malaysian Open |Malaysia | Anirban Lahiri (1) |align=center|38 |Co-sanctioned with the Asian Tour |- |12\u201315 Feb |True Thailand Classic |Thailand | Andrew Dodt (2) |align=center|28 |New tournament;

In a change for the 2015 season, the system was slightly modified to a full points system, with one euro equal to one point for all events leading up to the Final Series, where additional points were awarded (previously earnings were converted into points at the start of the Final Series); earnings from tournaments that award prize money in other currencies were converted at the exchange rate available the week of the event.
