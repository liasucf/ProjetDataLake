During the building's lifetime it functioned as a social club and later public house. Abbey Road Working Men's Club was granted listed status in 1976. Enforcement action was taken on the building's owners in 2007 by the Planning Inspectorate to remove the national flag which had been painted on its windows in celebration of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. It was considered to be harmful to the appearance of both the listed building and wider Conservation Area in which it is located. On 11 January 2017 a fire gutted the building, entirely destroying its 20th century extension, the iconic roof and leaving an empty shell of an interior. The surviving walls are in a precarious condition and could be potentially demolished in their entirety.Building set to be demolished after fire devastates iconic Barrow landmark ==See also== * Listed buildings in Barrow-in-Furness ==References== Abbey Road Working Men's Club Abbey Road Working Men's Club ",
