    "text": "Morley is a fictional brand of cigarettes that has appeared in various television shows, films, and video games that otherwise have no apparent connection to each other. The fictional brand packaging resembles the original packaging of the Marlboro cigarette brand. The name \"Morley\" is a play on \"Marleys\", a nickname for Marlboro cigarettes. Morleys appear at least as far back as 1960, in Alfred Hitchcock's film Psycho. There is also a Morley Lights version, in a gold and white package (similar to Marlboro Lights), marked \"Lights\".Morley Lights can be seen in The Walking Dead, \"Consumed\" (5x06) (Daryl finds a carton of Morley Lights), and in The Strain, \"The Third Rail\" (1x11) (Mariela Martinez throws down an empty pack of Morley Lights). The Morley packaging is sold to production companies by The Earl Hays Press, a century-old Hollywood prop packaging service. == Appearances == Morleys have appeared primarily in TV shows, and at times in movies, music videos, and other media, as both a prop and a plot element. === Film === * 200 Cigarettes (1999): In this comedy, Lucy, played by Courtney Love, presents a block of Morley cigarettes to Kevin, played by Paul Rudd. * Brooklyn Rules (2007): The three boys find a dead body in a convertible around the five-minute mark; one of the boys steals a pack of Morley off the dash of the vehicle. * Definitely, Maybe (2008): In 1992, Will Hayes, played by Ryan Reynolds, buys Morleys when he arrives in New York City for $3.20, and he complains that in Wisconsin they cost $2.60. * Epicenter (2000): At the beginning of the movie, the character Nick Constantine has a pack of Morleys in his briefcase. * Experiment in Terror (1962): A witness produces a pack while meeting with the FBI. * Freddy Got Fingered (2001): Gord, played by Tom Green, can be seen smoking a pack of Morleys in one scene. * Gun Shy (2000): In a meeting between the police, the character Charley has a box of Morley cigarettes in front of him on the conference table. * Heist (2015) Robert De Niro pulls a pack of \"Morley Lights\" out of pocket of dead man at the end of the film. * Honey Boy (2019): Shia LaBeouf's character is seen with a pack of Morleys on his night stand. * The House on Greenapple Road (1970): A character steals a pack of Morley cigarettes from a desk at the police station. * Ingrid Goes West (2017): A pack of Morley cigarettes is on a table during a party scene. * Joy Ride 2: Dead Ahead (2008): Rusty Nail, played by Mark Gibbon, buys Morley cigarettes in the opening scene in the shop, which he then smokes. * Murderer's Row (1966): Matt Helm uses a dart in a cigarette to take down a guard.
