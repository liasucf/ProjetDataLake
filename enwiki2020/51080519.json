    "text": "This is a list of Munster Senior Hurling Championship winning managers. The term manager (or coach) only came into widespread use in the 1970s. Up until then hurling teams were usually run by selection panels. Sometimes they contained up to ten members, resulting in self-interest coming to the fore more often than not. All this changed with the appointment of a strong manager, surrounded by a small group of selectors. ==By year== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Date ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Championship ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Winning manager ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Team ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Opponent ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Losing manager ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Score ! bgcolor=\"#DDDDFF\" | Site |- |4 July |1993 |Michael \"Babs\" Keating (5) |Tipperary |Clare |Len Gaynor |3-27 : 2-12 |Gaelic Grounds, Limerick |- |10 July |1994 |Tom Ryan |Limerick |Clare |Len Gaynor |0-25 : 2-10 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |9 July |1995 |Ger Loughnane |Clare |Limerick |Tom Ryan |1-17 : 0-11 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |14 July (Replay) |1996 |Tom Ryan (2) |Limerick |Tipperary |Tom Fogarty |4-7 : 0-16 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |6 July |1997 |Ger Loughnane (2) |Clare |Tipperary |Len Gaynor |1-18 : 0-18 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |19 July (Replay) |1998 |Ger Loughnane (3) |Clare |Waterford |Gerald McCarthy |2-16 : 0-10 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |4 July |1999 |Jimmy Barry-Murphy |Cork |Clare |Ger Loughnane |1-15 : 0-14 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |2 July |2000 |Jimmy Barry-Murphy (2) |Cork |Tipperary |Nicky English |0-23 : 3-12 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |1 July |2001 |Nicky English |Tipperary |Limerick |\u00c9amonn Cregan |2-16 : 1-17 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |30 June |2002 |Justin McCarthy |Waterford |Tipperary |Nicky English |2-23 : 3-12 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |29 June |2003 |D\u00f3nal O'Grady |Cork |Waterford |Justin McCarthy |3-16 : 3-12 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |27 June |2004 |Justin McCarthy |Waterford |Cork |D\u00f3nal O'Grady |3-16 : 1-21 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |26 June |2005 |John Allen |Cork |Tipperary |Ken Hogan |1-21 : 1-16 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |25 June |2006 |John Allen (2) |Cork |Tipperary |Michael \"Babs\" Keating |2-14 : 1-14 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |8 July |2007 |Justin McCarthy |Waterford |Limerick |Richie Bennis |3-17 : 1-14 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |13 July |2008 |Liam Sheedy |Tipperary |Clare |Mike McNamara |2-21 : 0-19 |Gaelic Grounds, Limerick |- |12 July |2009 |Liam Sheedy (2) |Tipperary |Waterford |Davy Fitzgerald |4-14 : 2-16 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |17 July (Replay) |2010 |Davy Fitzgerald |Waterford |Cork |Denis Walsh |1-16 : 1-13 |Semple Stadium, Thurles |- |10 July |2011 |Declan Ryan |Tipperary |Waterford |Michael Ryan |7-19 : 0-19 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |15 July |2012 |Declan Ryan (2) |Tipperary |Waterford |Michael Ryan |2-17 : 0-16 |P\u00e1irc U\u00ed Chaoimh, Cork |- |14 July |2013 |John Allen (3) |Limerick |Cork |Jimmy Barry-Murphy |0-24 : 0-15 |Gaelic Grounds, Limerick |- |13 July |2014 |Jimmy Barry-Murphy (3) |Cork |Limerick |T.
