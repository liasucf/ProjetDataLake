    "text": "Lollapalooza (Lolla) is an annual four-day music festival in Chicago, Illinois, at Grant Park, founded in 1991 and since expanded to other countries. Performances include but are not limited to alternative rock, heavy metal, punk rock, hip hop, and electronic music. Lollapalooza has also provided a platform for non-profit and political groups and various visual artists. The four-day music festival in Chicago's Grant Park hosts an estimated 400,000 people each year and sells out annually. Lollapalooza is considered one of the largest and most iconic music festivals in the world and one of the longest running in the United States. In 2019, its Brazilian edition was the world's third most grossing festival, with revenues of $14.5 million. Conceived and created in 1991 by Jane's Addiction singer Perry Farrell as a farewell tour for his band, Lollapalooza ran annually until 1997, and was revived in 2003. From its inception through 1997 and its revival in 2003, the festival toured North America. In 2004, the festival organizers decided to expand the dates to two days per city, but poor ticket sales forced the 2004 tour to be cancelled.The Associated Press. \"Lollapalooza 2004 cancels all dates\". USA Today. June 22, 2004. In 2005, Farrell and the William Morris Agency partnered with Austin, Texas\u2013based company Capital Sports Entertainment (now C3 Presents) and retooled it into its current format as a weekend destination festival in Chicago at Grant Park. In 2014, Live Nation Entertainment bought a controlling interest in C3 Presents.Live Nation Completes Deal for C3 Presents - Billboard, 22 December 2014 In 2010 it was announced that Lollapalooza would remain in Chicago while also debuting outside the United States, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile's capital Santiago on April 2\u20133, 2011 where they partnered up with Santiago- based company Lotus. In 2011, the company Geo Events confirmed the Brazilian version of the event, which was held at the Jockey Club in S\u00e3o Paulo on 7 and 8 April 2012. The Argentine version started in April 2014 in Buenos Aires, and in November 2014, the first European Lollapalooza was announced, which was held at the former Tempelhof Airport in Berlin.lollapalooza.com , Announcing Lollapalooza Berlin 2015, retrieved 7 November 2014 ==Etymology== The word\u2014sometimes alternatively spelled and pronounced as lollapalootza or lalapaloosa\u2014or \"lallapaloosa\" (P. G. Wodehouse, \"Heart of a Goof\") dates from a late 19th century/early 20th century American idiomatic phrase meaning \"an extraordinary or unusual thing, person, or event; an exceptional example or instance\". Its earliest known use was in 1896. In time the term also came to refer to a large lollipop.Hilburn, Robert. \"POP MUSIC REVIEW \u2013 'Lollapalooza' \u2013 Festival Concert With '60s Concept Isn't the Hoped-For Happening\". Los Angeles Times. July 22, 1991. Farrell, searching for a name for his festival, liked the euphonious quality of the by-then-antiquated term upon hearing it in a Three Stooges short film.Grimes, Taylor and Longton, Jeff. \"Lollapalooza History Timeline\". Billboard. 2007. Paying homage to the term's double meaning, a character in the festival's original logo holds one of the lollipops. The word has also caused a slang suffix to appear in event-planning circles as well as in news and opinion shows that is used synonymously with other suffixes like \"a-go-go\", \"o-rama\", etc. The suffix \"(a)palooza\" is often used to imply (often in hyperbolic language) that an entire event or crowd was made over that term, e.g.: \"Parks\"-apalooza, popular Chicago sushi restaurant \"Roll\"-apalooza, etc. ==History== ===Creation=== Inspired by events such as Britain's Reading Festival \u2013 which Lollapalooza cofounder Perry Farrell had been due to play in 1990 janesaddiction.org/tour/show/janes- addiction/1990-08-24/1091/ \u2013 Farrell, Ted Gardner, Don Muller, and Marc Geiger conceived the festival in 1990 as a farewell for Farrell's band Jane's Addiction.Reynolds, Simon. \"POP MUSIC; A Woodstock for the Lost Generation\". The New York Times. August 4, 1991. Unlike previous festivals such as Woodstock, A Gathering of the Tribes (also an influence on Lollapalooza) and the US Festival, which were one-time events held at single venues, Lollapalooza toured across the United States and Canada from mid-July until late August 1991. The inaugural Lollapalooza lineup was made up of artists from alternative rock (such as Siouxsie and the Banshees who were the second headliners), industrial music (such as Nine Inch Nails) and rap (Ice-T rapped and used the platform to launch Body Count, his heavy metal band). The premiere in Phoenix, Arizona, on 18 July 1991 was covered by a report on MTV which ended by journalist Dave Kendall saying \"Lollapalooza could be the tour of the summer\", the tour finished off in Seattle on 28 August 1991. Another key concept was the inclusion of nonmusical features.Parvaz, D. \"Lollapalooza: Then and Now\". Seattle Post-Intelligencer. August 23, 2003. Performers such as the Jim Rose Circus Side Show, an alternative freak show, and the Shaolin monks stretched the boundaries of rock culture. There was a tent for display of art pieces, virtual reality games, and information tables for political and environmental non-profit groups, promoting counter-culture and political awareness.Wiederhorn, Jon. \"Corporate Sponsors May Be Key To Lollapalooza's Return\". MTV.com. January 15, 2003. \"Basically, I'm bored,\" Farrell said at the time. \"I just want to see things that are unexpected and slightly bizarre. The way Barnum & Bailey perceived putting on a show ... well, they had a different angle.\" ===Success and decline=== The inaugural edition in 1991 was a surprise massive success. For Dave Grohl of Nirvana who saw it in Los Angeles while mixing Nevermind, the festival helped change the mentalities in the music industry. The Butthole Surfers opened the day playing in front of a big audience and Siouxsie and the Banshees \"were like the Led Zeppelin of that scene\". \"It felt like something was happening, that was the beginning of it all\". That year, Farrell also coined the term \"Alternative Nation\".di Perna, Alan. \"Brave Noise\u2014The History of Alternative Rock Guitar\". Guitar World. December 1995. The explosion of alternative rock in the early 1990s propelled Lollapalooza forward; the 1992 and 1993 festivals leaned heavily on grunge and alternative acts, and usually featured an additional rap artist.Nager, Larry. \"A History of Lollapalooza\". The Cincinnati Enquirer. July 13, 2003. Punk rock standbys like mosh pits and crowd surfing became part of the canon of the concerts. These years saw great increases in the participatory nature of the event with the inclusion of booths for open-microphone readings and oratory, television-smashing pits and tattooing and piercing parlors.Moses, Robert. \"Lotta-palooza\". The Phoenix. August 14, 1992.du Pre, Jolie. \"2009 Lollapalooza Hits Chicago's Grant Park\". Associated Content. August 8, 2009. After 1991, the festival included a second stage (and, in 1996, a third stage) for up-and-coming bands or local acts.Browne, David. \"Lollapalooza's Second Stage\". Entertainment Weekly. Jun 25, 1993. Attendee complaints of the festival included high ticket prices as well as the high cost for food and water at the shows.Volpi, Matt. \"Lollapalooza festival alternates cool music with dumb people\" . The Daily Collegian. August 1, 1994. The festival played at the Alpine Valley festival in East Troy, Wisconsin on August 29, 1992, and also at World Music Theater in Tinley Park, IL (near Chicago), where concertgoers ripped up chunks of sod and grass and threw them at each other and at the bands, resulting in tens of thousands of dollars in damages to the venue. Lollapalooza with the Chicago skyline backdrop. Grunge band Nirvana was scheduled to headline at the festival in 1994, reportedly being offered nearly $10 million to do it. However, Cobain turned it down, and the band officially dropped out of the festival on April 7, 1994. Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain's body was discovered in Seattle the next day. Cobain's widow, Courtney Love, made guest appearances at several shows, including the Philadelphia show at FDR Park (usually taking time given to her by The Smashing Pumpkins vocalist/guitarist Billy Corgan), speaking to the crowds about the loss, then singing a minimum of two songs. Farrell worked with rock poster artist Jim Evans (T.A.Z.) to create a series of posters and the complete graphic decoration for the 1994 event, including two 70 foot tall Buddha statues that flanked the main stage. In 1996, Farrell, who had been the soul of the festival, decided to focus his energy to produce his new festival project, ENIT, and did not participate in producing Lollapalooza. Many fans saw the addition of Metallica in 1996 as contrary to the festival's prior practice of featuring \"non-mainstream\" artists, and described the crowds attracted by Metallica as being singularly focused on the headliner without respect for the other performing artists. Moreover, festival cofounder Farrell felt that Metallica's macho image violated his peaceful vision for the festival, for alternative culture of the early 1990s was generally against macho behavior.For example, see Mimi Schippers, Rockin' out of the Box: Gender Maneuvering in Alternative Hard Rock. New Brunswick, New Jersey: Rutgers University Press, 2002. (Especially Chapter 1, and page 14.) Farrell quit the tour in protest.Pillsbury, Glenn T. Damage Incorporated: Metallica and the Production of Musical Identity. New York: Routledge, 2006. See page 143. Responding to the controversial Metallica tour, Lollapalooza made efforts to revive its relevance to audiences. The festival booked eclectic acts such as country superstar Waylon Jennings in 1996, and emphasized heavily electronica groups such as The Orb and The Prodigy in 1997. 1997, however, would prove to be the final tour from the initial series of Lollapalooza tours. The festival failed to find a suitable headliner in 1998, and therefore announced Lollapalooza's cancellation.\"Lollapalooza Cancelled\". Billboard. April 6, 1998. The cancellation served as a signifier of alternative rock's declining popularity. In light of the festival's troubles that year, Spin said, \"Lollapalooza is as comatose as alternative rock right now.\"Weisbard, Eric. \"This Monkey's Gone to Heaven\". Spin. July 1998. ===Revival and rebirth=== Lollapalooza Welcome Sign in Grant Park, Chicago. In 2003, Farrell reconvened Jane's Addiction and scheduled a new Lollapalooza tour. The festival schedule included venues in 30 cities through July and August. The 2003 tour achieved only marginal success with many fans staying away, presumably because of high ticket prices. Another tour scheduled for 2004 was to consist of a two-day festival taking place in each city. It was cancelled in June due to weak ticket sales across the country. Farrell partnered with Capital Sports & Entertainment (now C3 Presents), which co-owns and produces the Austin City Limits Music Festival, to produce Lollapalooza.\"Pixies, Weezer, Panic Set For Lollapalooza\". Billboard. CSE, Farrell and the William Morris Agency\u2014along with Charles Attal Presents\u2014resurrected Lollapalooza as a two-day destination festival in 2005 in Grant Park, Chicago, Illinois, with an even greater variety of performers (70 acts on five stages) than that of the touring festival. The festival was generally successful, attracting over 65,000 attendees, despite a 104 degree Fahrenheit Sunday (40 degrees Celsius) heat wave (two people were hospitalized for heat related illness).Matheson, Whitney. \"Live from Lollapalooza: An hour-by-hour report\". USA Today. July 23, 2005.Wehrle, Drew. \"Choose or Lollapalooza\". Spin. July 25, 2005. It returned to Chicago on August 4\u20136, 2006. On October 25, 2006, the Chicago Park District and Capital Sports & Entertainment agreed to a five-year, $5 million deal, keeping Lollapalooza at Grant Park in Chicago until 2011.Herrmann, Andrew. \"Lollapalooza to rock city for 5 more years\" . Chicago Sun-Times October 26, 2006. Lollapalooza ran August 3\u20135 in 2007, August 1\u20133 in 2008, August 7\u20139 in 2009, August 6\u20138 in 2010, August 5\u20137 in 2011, August 3\u20135 in 2012, August 2\u20134 in 2013 and August 1\u20133 in 2014. After a successful 2008 festival, another deal was signed to keep Lollapalooza in Chicago through 2018, guaranteeing the city $13 million.Kot, Greg. \"Lollapalooza promoters still searching for Chicago identity\" . Turn It Up (blog). Chicago Tribune. July 31, 2009. In 2016, Lollapalooza was four days long, from July 28 to July 31, to celebrate the event's 25th anniversary. In 2017, the festival kicked off on the 3rd of August celebrating its 26th year of existence. In 2018, the festival began on August 2 with a line-up of 180 bands.http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/lollapalooza/ct- lollapalooza-2018-best-and-worst-day-1-20180802-story.html On March 20, 2019 - The next version of the annual Lollapalooza festival was announced. On July 27, 2020 it was announced that due to COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 festival in Chicago would now be renamed Lolla2020 and feature a virtual festival broadcast for free on YouTube on July 30-August 2, 2020. The event was scheduled to feature a reunion by Porno for Pyros marking their first performance in 24 years. The event featured new original live performances along with performances from past years. Perry Farrell hosted conversations with Metallica's Lars Ulrich, Chuck D, Matt Pinfield and others, and the event was also planned to feature a special tribute to David Bowie. === Tickets and pricing === Tickets to the flagship and original Lollapalooza edition, in Chicago, are usually sold out extremely quickly. In the 2016 Lollapalooza, the four-day general passes sold out in about one day after they started the sale. The one-day passes sold even more quickly: they were gone less than three hours after organizers revealed the lineup for the four-day music festival. Because of this phenomenon, people who cannot buy the passes try to get them through alternatives sources such as Craigslist and StubHub. This is a common practice, although the prices tend to be significantly higher on these websites. In 2018, the festival experienced unusually slower sales so they released the lineup about 8 hours earlier. In its earliest editions, the official passes used to cost $31.50. However, with its growth and prominent relevance on the music scenario, Lollapalooza passes' prices have been increasing substantially over the years. Comparing the weekend passes for Lollapalooza 2016, which cost $335, not including taxes and fees, with the ones for Lollapalooza 2015, which cost $275, the increase was more than 20%. The price from 2015 to 2018 has remained the same without any increases. ===Notable Attendees=== 2016 *Bob Saget *Chance the Rapper *Dwyane Wade *Hannibal Buress *Graham Elliot *Malia Obama *Michelle Williams *Patrick Flueger *Sophia Bush 2017 *Ben Zobrist *Bob Guiney *Brandi Cyrus *Cameron Monaghan *Chris Chelios *Daniel Carcillo *Danny Masterson *Ethan Cutkosky *Emma Kenney *Malia Obama *Marina Squerciati *Tinsley Mortimer *Rahm Emanuel *Rumer Willis *Sasha Obama *Shaun White *Shawn Mendes 2018 *Bella Hadid *Courteney Cox *Kylie Jenner *Michael Sam *Normani *Rahm Emanuel *Scott Eastwood *Shamir *Twista *Valee *Victoria Justice ==International expansion== ===Chile=== In 2010, it was announced that Lollapalooza would debut in South America, with a branch of the festival staged in Chile's capital Santiago on April 2\u20133, 2011.

The third edition was moved to the Aut\u00f3dromo Jos\u00e9 Carlos Pace in S\u00e3o Paulo's borough of Interlagos, happening on April 5 and 6, 2014. Interlagos remained the festival's home for the following editions, on March 28\u201329, 2015, March 12\u201313, 2016, March 25\u201326, 2017, March 23, 24, 25, 2018 and April 5, 6, 7, 2019. ===Argentina=== On September 10, 2013, it was announced that the Argentine version of the festival would be held in Buenos Aires. Since then, Lollapalooza has had an annual edition at the Hip\u00f3dromo de San Isidro, usually on the last days of March. ===Germany=== On November 4, 2014, it was announced that the very first Lollapalooza Festival will be held in Europe, in the German capital of Berlin. It is scheduled for September 12\u201313, 2015, the proposed location is the historical airport ground of Berlin- Tempelhof. In true Lollapalooza fashion, this urban location serves to incorporate regional partners in presenting international events. In the official press release, festival founder Perry Farrell stated that, \"Berlin's energy, vibrant art, fashion and music scenes are a mirror reflection of what Lollapalooza is all about and I can't wait to share in this cultural exchange\".Lollapalooza Announces Berlin Festival: Taking place at Tempelhof Airport September 2015, pitchfork.com, 6 November 2014 Lollapalooza Germany was produced by the Lollapalooza U.S. team in addition to Melt! Booking and Festival Republic who have helped run both Reading and Leeds festival in England. The 2016 edition of the festival took place in the Treptower Park in Berlin, 10\u201311 September. It drew 70,000 visitors each day. At change.org an on-line petition against the festival in the Treptower Park gathered over 6400 supporters. Citizens from the area have created working groups to stop the festival taking place in the Treptower Park. There has been little communication with local inhabitants from either festival organizers or local government. People living directly next to the event location have received an invitation to move to a nearby hotel for the duration of the festival. Since 2018 the festival is held at the Olympiapark Berlin. ===Sweden=== The first Scandinavian edition of Lollapalooza was held in the capital of Sweden, Stockholm, on the 28-29 of June 2019. === France === On October 12, 2016, Lollapalooza announced that they would be hosting a festival in Paris, France. The inaugural edition of this festival will be taking place at the city's Longchamp Racecourse grounds on July 22\u201323, 2017. The lineup for Lollapalooza Paris 2017 was announced on January 17, 2017 and includes a lineup featuring Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Weeknd as headliners. Following that, the lineup includes the likes of Imagine Dragons, Lana Del Rey, DJ Snake, London Grammar, Alt-J, The Roots, Marshmello, Liam Gallagher, Martin Solveig, Skepta, Glass Animals, Milky Chance, Don Diablo, Oliver Heldens, Crystal Fighters, Jauz, Alan Walker, and many more. ===Other=== On August 7, 2012, Perry Farrell announced that Lollapalooza will be debuting in Tel Aviv, Israel. Farrell described Israel as an \"international music community that listens to everything we all listen to, but the artists weren't traveling there so it was an opportunity.\" The event was scheduled for August 20\u201322, 2013 in Hayarkon Park, the city's largest urban park. However, the event has been postponed to an unknown date. While there was no definitive reasoning for the cancellation of the Israel date, various news sources report there are often financial challenges that attribute to producing a large-scale show with international artists within the political situation in the Mideast. ==Criticism== Recording engineer, guitarist, and journalist Steve Albini has criticized Lollapalooza for its corporatization of popularized \"alternative\" music. In a 1993 interview, Albini commented: > Lollapalooza is the worst example of corporate encroachment into what is > supposed to be the underground. It is just a large scale marketing of bands > that pretend to be alternative but are in reality just another facet of the > mass cultural exploitation scheme. I have no appreciation or affection for > those bands and I have no interest in that whole circle. If Lollapalooza had > Jesus Lizard and the Melvins and Fugazi and Slint then you could make a case > that it was actually people on the vanguard of music. What it really is the > most popular bands on MTV that are not heavy metal. Both The Jesus Lizard and the Melvins have subsequently performed at the event. In April 2010, it was reported that Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan had launched an antitrust investigation into the festival for imposing radius clauses on acts, contractually stipulating that they could not perform in cities within 300 miles of Chicago\u2014including cities as far as Detroit, Indianapolis, and Milwaukee\u2014for up to six months prior, and three months after Lollapalooza. ==Lineups by year== ==See also== * Alternative rock * Alternative metal * Grunge * List of historic rock festivals ==References== ==External links== * * Lollapalooza Berlin/Germany website * Lollapalooza Brazil website * Lollapalooza Chile website * Lollapalooza Argentina website Category:Concert tours Category:Music festivals in Chicago Category:Rock festivals in the United States Category:Alternative rock festivals Category:Music festivals established in 1991 Category:1991 establishments in the United States Category:Rock festivals in Brazil ",
