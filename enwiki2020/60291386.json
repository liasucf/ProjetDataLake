He would also be named to the tournament All-star team, and led the competition in goals. At the 2017 Four Nations Cup in Veliky Novgorod, Russia, Caufield appeared in three games, notching six goals and one assist, while the NTDP U-17 finished first. In February 2018, he led the team with 10 points in four games (four goals, six assists) at the 2018 Five Nations Cup in J\u00e4rvenp\u00e4\u00e4, Finland, enroute to another NTDP U-17 first place finish. At the 2018 IIHF World U-18 Championship, the NTDP would settle for a silver medal after losing the final game to Finland 3-2. Caufield closed the tournament with six points in seven games. For the 2018\u201319 season, Caufield would continue his stellar play internationally. In late 2018, the NTDP U-18 claimed the 2018 Five Nations Cup in Krava\u0159e, Czech Republic, with Caufield notching seven goals and two assists in four games. The NTDP U-18 finished third in the tables of the 2019 Five Nations Cup in Sochi, Russia, where Caufield registered three goals and two assists in four games. On April 23, 2019, Caufield scored his 10th and 11th goal for the NTDP in just four games of preliminary round at the 2019 IIHF World U-18 Championship, breaking a record set by both Brett Sterling in 2002 and Phil Kessel in 2005 (nine goals). On April 27, 2019, Caufield tied Alexander Ovechkin's single tournament goals record (14 goals from 2002) and inscribed his 18 career goals in the national record book of the tournament. The NTDP would eventually lose their semi-final matchup to Russia 3-2 in a shootout, with the NTDP claiming a bronze medal in a 5\u20132 win over Canada to close their tournament play. Caufield was named the MVP of the championship, as well as Best Forward (Directorate Award). Finally, he led the competition in goals and was named to the tournament All-star team. ==Personal life== Cole Caufield is a native of Mosinee, Wisconsin.
