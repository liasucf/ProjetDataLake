    "text": "\"Pibare Rama Rasam\" is a classical song composed by Sadasiva Brahmendra.http://www.hindu.com/fr/2008/03/14/stories/2008031451100200.htm This song is usually rendered in raga Ahir Bhairav of Indian classical music. ==Translation== Drink (Verb - Piban) (implied as absorb) the essence (Rasam) of the name of Rama, o tongue (rasana). It will help you (implied) remove or be distant (D\u016br\u012bkr\u0325ta) from association with sin (P\u0101taka) or be distant from those who cause you to sin and you will be fulfilled (P\u016brita) with many kinds (N\u0101n\u0101 Vidha) and types (varga) of rewards/gains (phala). It will help you be far removed (Vid\u016bram) from the fear (Bhaya) and grief (\u015a\u014dka) of the cycle of birth and death (Janana-Mara\u1e47a), it is the essence (S\u0101ra\u1e43) of all (Sakala) the religious treatises (\u015a\u0101stra), the Vedas (Nigama) and sciences (\u0100gama). It protects (Parip\u0101lita) all creation. Brahma was born of a lotus (Sarasija) from a golden egg (Garbha A\u1e47\u1e0dam - womb & egg) and then he created the whole universe. So this phrase implies that chanting Rama's name protects the whole universe. It will purify (Pavitr\u012b) even the most (Parama) impious or heretic (P\u0101\u1e63\u0101\u1e47\u1e0dam). It is the pure (\u015auddha) song (G\u012btam) that signature of the poet (Paramahamsa) has taken refuge in (\u0100\u015brama/A\u015brita), it is the same which has been drunk (P\u012btam) by sages like \u015auka \u015aaunaka and Kau\u015bika. ==In film== The song was a hit in the Telugu movie, Padamati Sandhya Ragam. ==References== Category:Carnatic compositions ",
