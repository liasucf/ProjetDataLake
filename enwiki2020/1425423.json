McGillion played young Ernest Littlefield in Stargate SG-1's first season, in the episode \"The Torment of Tantalus\", the first Tau'ri to have passed through the Stargate after its burial. In 2004, McGillion was cast in the science fiction series Stargate Atlantis as the Scottish medical doctor, Carson Beckett. He was initially cast as a recurring guest, but his character appeared so frequently in the show's first season, he was promoted to main character for seasons two and three.
