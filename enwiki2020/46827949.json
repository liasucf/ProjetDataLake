Eighteen sports as reported in Pacific Islands Monthly. The newly introduced sports were: cricket, hockey, lawn bowls, and squash. Netball: In Pacific Islands Monthly (PIM), it was reported that \"Papua New Guinea took the bronze\" in the 1979 netball competition, behind Fiji and Cook Islands. However, a few pages later in PIM's results for the netball, Tonga is listed as finishing in third place. Swimming: There were either 24 or 23 events on the programme, depending on whether the men's 4 \u00d7 200 m freestyle relay was contested and officially included in the medals. A publication from Guam's Political Status Education Coordinating Commission claims that Guam swimmer Hollis Kimbrough, \"won a record seven medals in the '79 SPG alone\", and as such, the Pacific Islands Monthly results could be incomplete as only four medals are listed for Kimbrough there plus two men's relay medals for Guam \u2013 and the men's 4 \u00d7 200 is omitted. Table tennis: There were seven events on the programme (or perhaps only six or five, depending on whether the respective team competitions for men and women were played and medals officially awarded). The five events for table tennis in the list of results from the November 1979 issue of Pacific Islands Monthly (PIM) are the mixed doubles, men's and women's singles and doubles. PIM reported earlier in the same issue that Fiji had won the women's team event (as well as the women's doubles), but neither women's or men's team events appear in the PIM results. Weightlifting: Ten men's weight divisions were contested, with one medal event only per division (for the maximum total lift of snatch + clean-and-jerk). ==References== ==Sources== * * Category:Pacific Games Category:Sport in Fiji Pacific Games P Category:1979 in Fijian sport Category:International sports competitions hosted by Fiji Category:August 1979 sports events in Oceania Category:September 1979 sports events in Oceania ",
