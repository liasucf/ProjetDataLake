What later became St. Margaret's House was initially called the Bethnal Green Ladies Committee. Oxford House, another settlement in Bethnal Green, had formed in 1884 and in 1886, founded the Federation of Working Men's Clubs.Baker, T F T. \"Bethnal Green: Social and Cultural Activities\", in A History of the County of Middlesex: Volume 11, Stepney, Bethnal Green, British History Online pp. 147-155, London, 1998). Retrieved 31 August 2018. Thus, St. Margaret's House acted as the female equivalent of Oxford House. The name for the house came in the early 1890s when the Oxford ladies took a lease for the \u2018eminently suitable\u2019 premises at 4 Victoria Park Square, which had space for 8 or 9 residents and three living rooms, with suitable offices.St Margaret\u2019s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989 pg 3 On 21 March 1893, after a short service read by the Bishop of Bedford, St. Margaret's House was opened by H.R.H Princess Mary Adelaide.St Margaret\u2019s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989 pg 4 === Development of community work === The house's early pioneering work included the Children's Country Holiday Fund, the Metropolitan Association for Befriending Young Servants, district and hospital visits, a needlework scheme to employ very poor women through the winter months, and running the club for girls.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2 A small chapel was built by residents and on St. Margaret's Day in June 1904, Bishop Winnington Ingram came to dedicate the chapel.St Margaret\u2019s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989 pg 5 === Call for Residents === In December 1900, the Georgian Town House of 21 Old Ford Road, which belonged to the Female Guardians Association, was bought by the organisation and became the centre for the settlement.St Margaret\u2019s House, A Brief History: 18889-1989 pg 5 On 5 May 1903, Princess Beatrice of the United Kingdom officially opened the new house. The women living in St. Margaret's House wrote to the Editor of the Spectator in February 1903 to call out for other women to become residents. \"Our object is to secure two or three permanent residents to fill the place of some who have had to leave us unexpectedly.\" S. Talbot, a resident, wrote. To become a resident at this point, it cost 20s to 25s per week, and each woman had to do a three-month trial before becoming an official resident.Talbot, S. \"St. Margaret\u2019s House, Bethnal Green.\", The Spectator, pp. 17, London 22 February 1902. Retrieved 31 August 2018 === The First World War === The Great War meant fewer people were signing up to be residents of St. Margaret's House, and membership of the clubs dropped off because the blackout stopped girls from being able to attend. The Hon. Mrs Whittuck, a committee member of the House, had died before the war in 1915;, two years later, her executors called in the balance of her debt, which included the loan she had taken out to buy St. Margaret's House. With funds limited in an already difficult time, it looked like St. Margaret's House would have to close. But an anonymous benefactor cleared off most of St. Margaret's House's debt, allowing it to remain open.Beauman, Katherine Bentley \"Women and the Settlement Movement\" pp. 97, Radcliffe Press, 1993. Retrieved 31 August 2018 === In between wars === The social upheavals following the War meant residents were no longer ladies of independent means, but working people, including teachers and librarians, helping with House activities as part of their rent.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 2 And by the early 1920s, St. Margaret's House had fourteen residents, including the Head and the Bursar, six lodgers engaged in teaching or social work, two medical students and one Charity Organisation Society worker. At this point, the settlement still only housed women. In 1924, St. Margaret's House started a children's play hours\u2019 scheme twice a week for over 50 children in Bethnal Green. This same year, the house also helped launch the local branch of the Industrial Christian Fellowship. The house secured the services of Eleanor Kelly in 1929, who was a founding member of the Association of Welfare Workers. She said of her work, \"All firms who had been doing welfare work before the outbreak of war were asked to take relays of people (mostly women) to train.\"Woollacott, Angela \"Maternalism, professionalism and industrial welfare supervisors in World War I Britain\" , Women's History Review, 3:1, 29-56.

With the Great Depression, the 1930s saw a terrible period of unemployment in the East End. This meant that from 1933, St. Margaret's House assisted in the running of both the Peel Grove Hobbies Centre for the unemployed and the Unemployed Men's Centre.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3 They also started to send out food parcels to old-aged pensioners and the very poor. === The Second World War and post-war === With the outbreak of war, the Bethnal Green branch of the Citizens Advice Bureaux was organised in the House, and the House became an evacuation sub-office during the Blitz.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 3 Half of the houses in Bethnal Green were destroyed by bombing during the Second World War, but St. Margaret's House escaped serious damage. Though there were several near misses, including an incendiary bomb which fell on the chapel roof and failed to ignite.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5 Post-war, the main house had to undergo extensive repair, including a new roof and rewiring. In 1953, the council decided that men could live at St. Margaret's House as well as women, as the number of female students wishing to take up residence at the house had declined.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 5 Throughout the 1960s and 70s, St. Margaret's House continued to face financial ups and downs, but a visit by the poet laureate, Sir John Betjeman, in 1975, helped to raise enough money to get the house through this financial crisis. And throughout the 1980s, St. Margaret's House began new, community-centred initiatives with organisations including Bethnal Green Citizens Advice Bureau, the Tower Hamlets Vietnamese Families Association, and the Activity in Retirement Workcentre.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 11 === Expansion of St. Margaret\u2019s House === In June 1993, the settlement became the leaseholder of two adjoining buildings, number 15 and 17 Old Ford Road. With more space, the House expanded its work and, from the extra revenue generated, the House established its Community Arts Project.St Margaret\u2019s House Settlement, An Outline History: 1889-2003 pg 10 And by 2001, with funding from both public and private sources, St. Margaret's House was able to buy both of these houses.
