    "text": "Chef Menteur is an instrumental rock band from New Orleans, Louisiana in the United States with heavy leanings towards the style of ambient music. It was formed in 1998 by Alec Vance (of Shinola) and Jim Yonkus, both of whom were looking to explore new sounds from different music worlds: electronica, post- rock, experimental noise and drone, and improvisational jazz. The current line-up includes Dan Haugh from the bands godheadSilo and Smoke and Smoke. The original lineup was Vance on guitar and Farfisa organ and Yonkus on bass, with both members of the duo also playing other synths, manipulating samples and drum machines. They also run their own custom video projections at live shows from self-produced DV footage. The sound of the band has become gradually more guitar-and-drums oriented over time and less sample-based and reliant on computer-synchronized beats, and shows feature psychedelic improvisations. Their 2005 album We Await Silent Tristero's Empire was released by the artist- run independent label Backporch Revolution to international critical acclaim . The band reformed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, and was one of the first bands to play in the city following the lifting of the evacuation order allowing residents to return. They were instrumental in releasing the Proud To Swim Home compilation which raised money for musicians who lost instruments in the flood. They released the album \"The Answer's In Forgetting\" in 2007, at which point Yonkus left the band and was replaced by Brian Abbott. In 2008 the band was nominated for Best Electronic Act in The Best of the Big Easy Awards . The trio of Vance, Haugh, and Abbott spent the next three and a half years recording their next album named \"East of the Sun & West of the Moon.\" In April 2011, Phil Rollins of The Gubernatorial Candidates became a member of Chef Menteur while the new record went into final mixes and production. \"East of the Sun & West of the Moon\" was released on Backporch Revolution on March 31, 2012 in double LP and digital formats. Chef Menteur counts among its fans noted actress Grace Zabriskie. ==Band members== As of April 2016, the full- time membership of Chef Menteur consists of: *B.
