    "text": "Umberto Rizzitano was an Italian academic, known for reviving Arab-Islamic studies in the University of Palermo and Sicily, neglected since the death of Michele Amari.The chair of Lingua e letteratura araba ('Arabic language and literature') in Palermo had been held with alternating prestige by Salvatore Morso, Vincenzo Mortillaro, Giuseppe Caruso, Salvatore Cusa and Bartolomeo Lagumina, until the exceptional decade between 1902 and 1913 by Carlo Alfonso Nallino, followed twenty years later by Ignazio Di Matteo. == Life == Rizzitano was born in Egypt, where his family (of Sicilian origin, from Messina) had moved for his father's work. Here he studied in Italian schools, perfecting his classical Arabic, written and spoken, as well as the Egyptian language, lazily defined as a \"dialect\". He graduated in 1937 from the University of Rome, where Prof. Michelangelo Guidi, acted as advisor on a thesis on the Umayyad poet, Ab\u016b Mi\u1e25\u01e7an Nu\u1e63ayb b. Rab\u0101\u1e25 (),Partially published in the Rivista degli Orientali of the University of Rome in 1943 (pp. 421\u2013471). on which he gave a report to the XX International Congress of Orientalists (Brussels, 5\u201310 September 1938). Rizzitano participated in WWII. When he almost immediately fell prisoner in 1940, to the Egyptian Sidi Barrani, he managed to escape and reach Cairo clandestinely before regaining Italy. Rizzitano was Libera docenza and assistant to the chair of Arabic language and literature at the University of Rome, where he had conducted his studies, however, he returned to Egypt as director of Italian at the University of Cairo and at the University of 'Ayn Shams, of the same Egyptian capital. In Cairo he directed the Institute of Italian Culture with untiring enthusiasm. In 1959 the chair in Palermo of Arabic language and literature was finally filled after decades of vacancy. Rizzitano was the undisputed winner. At the same time, his statement on the \"Return of the teaching of the Arabic language and literature to the University of Palermo\" outlined a budget and an operational project aimed at encouraging participation by the younger generation. Through tireless research, Rizzitano shaped this project assuming the role of bridge between Italian and Arab cultures. In 1949 he participated in the first translation into Italian, for Einaudi, of the complete Arabic version of One Thousand and One Nights,Originally in 4 volumes, Rizzitano's is the fourth, of VII + 787 pp. \u2013 together with his fraternal friend Francesco Gabrieli, Antonio Cesaro, Virginia Vacca and Costantino Pansera and in that same 1944, he translated the novel Zaynab by Mohammed Hussein Heikal. In 1965 he published for the Institute for the Orient the masterpiece of \u1e6c\u0101h\u0101 \u1e24useyn, al-Ayy\u0101m (\u2018The Days\u2019) and between 1975 and 1977 he participated in the first world edition of the manuscript of the geographical work of al-Idrisi sponsored by the Universit\u00e0 degli Studi di Napoli \"L'Orientale\" of Naples and by the Istituto italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente of Rome and updated the Biblioteca arabo-sicula by Michele Amari, in view of the National Edition of the works of the great Sicilian scholar. Rizzitano's attention to the issue of dialogue between religions and cultures led him, at the express invitation of the Arab Republic of Libya, to participate, as an Italian observer, in the Islamic-Christian colloquium held in Tripoli from 1 to 5 February 1975. He organized a famous international conference, held in Rome, Venice and Palermo, on the \"Arab presence in European culture\". In 1979 he became President of the Istituto per l'Oriente Carlo Alfonso Nallino, the oldest Italian non- university research center for modern and contemporary Arabists. His contributions on the emerging Egyptian literature of the twentieth century are fundamental, without forgetting the Arab-Sicilian literati, such as Ab\u016b l-\u1e24asan \u02bfAl\u012b b. \u02bfAbd al-Ra\u1e25m\u0101n al-\u1e62iqill\u012b, called \"al-Ballan\u016bb\u012b\" (or Billan\u016bb\u012b, that is \"of Villanova\"). The bibliography of Umberto Rizzitano's writings records over 120 publications among those that have particularly distinguished his work as an Arabist and Islamist.Exactly 121. The complete bibliography has been published by the magazine Oriente Moderno, of the Istituto per l\u2019Oriente Carlo Alfonso Nallino (of which he was a Councilor and then President in the three years preceding his sudden death), on n. 7\u201312 of 1980, at pp. 375\u2013382. and confirms the fact that the continuous search for common historical, linguistic and literary roots had as its engine the demonstration of \"a possibility of coexistence of men of different race and religion\". He participated in numerous national and international conferences, where he always managed to fascinate the Arabic-speaking audience with his perfect pronunciation of the Arabic language and published numerous scientific contributions that still make him the most fruitful Sicilian scholar of Arabism after Amari, of whom he was the most worthy disciple. == Selected works == (Just some of the most significant of the 121 printed works by Rizzitano are listed) * Mohammed Hussein Heikal, Zeinab, translation by U.
