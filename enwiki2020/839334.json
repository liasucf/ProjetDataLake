    "text": "In Greek mythology, Ichnaea (Iknaia) (), \"the tracker\" was an epithet that could be applied to Themis, as in the Homeric Hymn to Delian Apollo (line 94), or to Nemesis, who was venerated at Ichnae, a Greek city in Macedon. At the birth of Apollo on Delos according to the Homeric hymn, the goddesses who bear witness to the rightness of the birth are the great goddesses of the old order: Dione, Rhea, Ichnaean Themis and the sea-goddess \"loud-moaning\" Amphitrite. ==See also== *Adrasteia ==References== *(Camena) J.
