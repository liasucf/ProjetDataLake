Vaux leaps high into the heavens.\"In the Heart of the Canadian Rockies, James Outram, Rocky Mountain Books, 2007 ==Geology== Mount Vaux is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Cambrian periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Vaux is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers.
