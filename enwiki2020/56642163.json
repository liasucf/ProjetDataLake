The film won multiple awards including the Documentary Feature Special Jury Award at the Atlanta Film Festival, Best Director at the Atlanta Underground Film Festival, Best Documentary Feature at Atlanta Docufest, and Best First Time Director at the Downtown Film Festival Los Angeles ==Critical reception== Critically, the film has been well received. Kimber Myers of the Los Angeles Times called the film an \"impressive directorial debut... alternates between triumph and tragedy, but there's never a moment that doesn't feel intimate and authentic.\" In IndieWire, Bryn Gelbart called the film \"astounding and powerful.\" Alan Scherstuhl from The Village Voice called the film \"essential... Charts nothing less than what it\u2019s like to try to grow up free in the prison capital of the world,\" and Scott Pfeiffer of The Moving World said the film \"deserves a place beside the great achievements in longitudinal film.\" Miriam Di Nunzio of the Chicago Sun-Times said the film \"powerfully drives home what is obvious and yet what most of us fail to see: Bertie County is America. It's Chicago. It's Detroit. It's Los Angeles. It's a portrait of communities and families striving to do right by their kids, but where schools and lack of job programs fail to meet communities' most desperate needs.\" Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said \u201c I never would have heard of Bertie, North Carolina if it weren\u2019t for this movie, and using art to learn about every corner of our country seems more essential than ever.\u201d Sheri Linden of The Hollywood Reporter said \u201cthe experiences and challenges of the rural poor might make it into the national conversation as an abstraction, but rarely with the specificity of this intimate portrait of a black community.\u201d Brian C. Bush of The Huffington Post called the film \u201cstarkly poetic\u201d and said it \"brilliantly weaves the young men\u2019s stories together, as they transition from their teens into manhood, engaged in a shared struggle for social and economic survival.\" Executive Producer Gordon Quinn said of the film, \u201c _Raising Bertie_ challenges us to see the value in lives too often ignored, those of rural America and emerging adults.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Category:2016 documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:2016 films Category:American films Category:English-language films ",
