James Schortal and his wife Catherine White built the church, a small single-room structure, at Ballylarkin in 1350. A triple sedilia was later inserted into the south wall in the 14th century. A sheela-na-gig was originally at Ballylarkin but has been moved to the National Museum of Ireland \u2013 Archaeology. ==Church== The church was fortified with a chemin de ronde and a small north entrance. It has a Gothic cut stone window. There is a triple sedilia in the south wall. Along the top of the north and south walls is a series of corbel-stones with tracery. Beside the sedilia is a piscina with quatrefoil basin. There is an ambry beside the east window. ==References== Category:Churches in County Kilkenny Category:Archaeological sites in County Kilkenny Category:National Monuments in County Kilkenny Category:Former churches in the Republic of Ireland Category:1350 in Ireland Category:1350 establishments in Europe ",
