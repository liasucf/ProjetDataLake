Tanden advised Hillary Clinton\u2019s successful 2016 primary campaign and unsuccessful 2016 general election campaign.

She has a brother, Raj. Her parents divorced when she was five, after which Tanden's mother was on welfare for nearly two years before obtaining a job as a travel agent.Nikhila Panti, \"Hillary is a role model & a friend\", Times of India, March 11, 2007 She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1992.

Edwards and Tanden both volunteered on Michael Dukakis's unsuccessful run for president in 1988. Tanden worked as a precinct leader in the Bel Air district of West Los Angeles where many households had already contributed to the Dukakis campaign. ==Career== After graduating from Yale Law School, Tanden moved to Washington, D.C., where she has worked on domestic policy on Capitol Hill, in think tanks, and for various Democratic senatorial and presidential campaigns. She has also written on Indian-American issues.The New Republic: \"The GOP's New Diversity\", NPR, June 30, 2010 ===Work with the Clintons=== Tanden has been regarded as a Clinton loyalist and personal friend of Hillary Clinton\u2019s, whose career has largely been defined by her professional ties to the Clintons. She worked with President Bill Clinton's campaign on new energy policies, and health-care reform, as associate director for domestic policy in the Clinton White House, and as senior advisor in the First Lady\u2019s Office. In 1999 and 2000, she worked for Hillary Clinton on her successful senatorial campaign in New York, as her deputy campaign manager and issues director, and as such, crafted policy proposals for the campaign. After the election, Tanden served as Senator Clinton's Legislative Director from 2003 to 2005. She served as Hillary Clinton's policy director for her unsuccessful bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, shaping its policy proposals. Tanden supervised debate preparation for Senator Clinton's participation in the Democratic presidential nomination debates during 2007 and 2008. Continuing her association with Hillary Clinton, Tanden was an unpaid adviser to Mrs. Clinton\u2019s successful 2016 primary season nomination campaign and unsuccessful general election campaign in opposition to Republican candidate Donald Trump, while also running the Center for American Progress. Tanden was considered a candidate for a top White House job, had Mrs. Clinton won the presidency. After Clinton secured the Democratic nomination for president in 2016, Tanden was named to her transition team. === 2008 Obama general election campaign === After Barack Obama was nominated as the Democratic presidential candidate, Tanden was one of the first, and also one of the few, former Clinton campaign staffers to join his team; she served as Domestic Policy Director for his successful general election campaign, where she managed all domestic policy proposals for the campaign. === Obama administration === Tanden also served in the Obama administration as senior adviser to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius of the Department of Health and Human Services. She worked on the drafting of the administration's health care legislation, including work specific to its proposed, but later withdrawn public plan option, before parts of it became public law as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, and negotiated with Congress and stakeholders on several provisions of the bill. She has been described as one of the \u201ckey architects\u201d of the Affordable Care Act. ===The Center for American Progress=== Tanden with John Podesta (left) and Governor Martin O'Malley (right) In 2003, Senator Clinton supported Tanden's central role in the founding of the Center for American Progress, or CAP. Tanden worked as Senior Vice President for Domestic Policy, while also serving as Senior Vice President for Academic Affairs and, starting in 2010, as Chief Operating Officer. In October of 2011, Tanden succeeded John Podesta as CAP's president. The Washington Post's Jason Horowitz described CAP as \"Washington\u2019s leading liberal think tank, which is an incessant advocate for a broad progressive agenda and as such a sharp thorn in President Obama\u2019s left side.\" Ed Lee, Nancy Pelosi and Tom Perez, 2014 In 2016, a hacker gained access to John Podesta's private emails (aka the Podesta emails), some which were emails exchanged with Tanden. In one exchange, on August 11, 2015, while discussing news that Harvard University law professor Lawrence Lessig was exploring a bid for the Democratic nomination, Tanden wrote of Lessig, \"I fucking hate that guy.\" Lessig responded to the incident by saying that while he supported whistle blowing and a pardon of Edward Snowden, Tanden should not have to be burdened with having her private emails scrutinized and that it was not in the public interest. Tanden called the release of her personal communications, which often feature her blunt private assessments, a painful experience to endure. After the 2016 election and Clinton\u2019s loss, Tanden refocused the work of the Center for American Progress, aiming to have the think tank, and especially its advocacy arm (the Center for American Progress Action Fund), serve as a \u201ccentral hub for Trump resistance\u201d as well as playing a leading role in shaping the healthcare debate within the Democratic Party. In 2018, reports emerged that Tanden had unintentionally revealed the first name of a CAP employee complaining of sexual harassment.https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/sarahmimms/center-for- american-progress-staff-shocked-after-neera On April 28, 2020, Tanden was named to serve on New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy\u2019s Restart and Recovery Commission tasked with preparing the state to reopen after the novel coronavirus lockdown. === Media and writing === Tanden has had a regular column for The New Republic online. She has appeared on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, Real Time with Bill Maher, MSNBC, CNN, and Fox programs.Appointments: \"Neera Tanden\", NRI (Non-Resident Indian) Internet, February 2, 2011; accessed August 1, 2016 == Political views == Neera Tanden, who frequently describes herself as a progressive, belongs to the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. She credits her experience as a child relying on welfare programs as well as the formative moment of witnessing Anita Hill's testimony against Clarence Thomas in 1991 with setting her on the path of career in public policy. Under Tanden's leadership, the Center for American Progress has proposed strengthening the Child Tax Credit (CTC) and joined efforts to push for universal paid leave; she has argued for expanding TANF to serve more families and has taken a stand against work requirements for welfare recipients as well as against Right to Work laws. Having worked on passage of the Affordable Care Act during the Obama administration, Tanden has remained a strong proponent of universal healthcare, preferring a multi-payer model with an insurance mandate (similar to countries such as Germany) over single-payer healthcare and expressing skepticism over the viability of proposed Medicare for All bills. In 2019, the Center for American Progress proposed Medicare Extra for All, a blueprint for achieving a multi-payer universal healthcare system. Tanden has also praised the similar Medicare for America bill introduced in the House of Representatives. In 2018, Tanden endorsed the idea of a job guarantee to help revitalize economically-stagnant regions in the United States. She has been a vocal critic of progressive U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders, his policy proposals, and his supporters. She herself is also a frequent target of criticism by Sanders supporters.
