The winery is located on the Right Bank of the Bordeaux wine region, in the commune of Saint-\u00c9milion in the department Gironde. The ch\u00e2teau also produces a second wine named Carillon d\u2019Ang\u00e9lus. ==History== The estate has been owned by the Bo\u00fcard de Laforest family since the Domaine de Mazaret was bequeathed to Comte Maurice de Bo\u00fcard de Laforest in 1909, and expanded by the acquisition of Clos de L'Ang\u00e9lus in 1926 and a plot from Ch\u00e2teau Beau-S\u00e9jour B\u00e9cot in 1969. The name refers to the three Angelus bells audible from the vineyards, coming from the chapel at Mazerat, the church in Saint-Martin de Mazeret and Saint-\u00c9milion. Then named L'Ang\u00e9lus presentation card dated 1931, demonstrating the designs of the early 20th century, the label, cork, case and capsule markings. Hubert de Bo\u00fcard de Laforest joined the family business at Ang\u00e9lus in 1976 having concluded studies under \u00c9mile Peynaud at the Facult\u00e9 d'Oenologie in Bordeaux. Along with several modernising changes, the practice of maturing in new oak was begun in 1980. The estate has been classified as a Premier grand cru cru class\u00e9 (A) since 2012, was previously a Premier grand cru cru class\u00e9 (B) since 1996, and was before that classified as Grand cru class\u00e9. But according to research of journalist Isabelle Saporta, Hubert de Bo\u00fcard is judge and jury in the preparation of the classification... In 2018, the co-owner Hubert de Bouard has been charged with seeking to unfairly influence the outcome of the coveted Saint-Emilion Grand Cru Class\u00e9 rankings in his favour. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/10/02/one-frances-top- wine-chateaus-embroiled-inquiry-rigged-st-emilion/ Ang\u00e9lus is currently managed by Hubert de Bo\u00fcard, with the consultancy of the oenologist Michel Rolland. ==Production== The estate consists of 23.4 hectares with a grape variety of 51% Merlot, 47% Cabernet Franc and 2% Cabernet Sauvignon. The annual production averages 10,000 cases of the Grand vin and 1,000 cases of the second wine. ==References== ==External links== * Ch\u00e2teau Ang\u00e9lus official site Category:Bordeaux wine producers ",
