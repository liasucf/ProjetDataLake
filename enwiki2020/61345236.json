    "text": "\u00c1gua Branca is a train station on CPTM Line 7-Ruby, in the district of \u00c1gua Branca in S\u00e3o Paulo. In the future, it will be connected with S\u00e3o Paulo Metro/Move S\u00e3o Paulo Line 6-Orange andCPTM Line 8-Diamond and Regional Trains (Americana\u2194Santos and Sorocaba\u2194Pindamonhangaba). ==History== Station entrance next to the Avenida Santa Marina level crossing. \u00c1gua Branca station was one of the opened in the opening of Santos-Jundia\u00ed railway by S\u00e3o Paulo Railway, on 14 February 1867. Initially, it was a rustic building. With the opening of Sorocaba Railway, which was parallel to it, \u00c1gua Branca station, which was far from S\u00e3o Paulo, began to have importance as an integration point and cargo depot between both railways. In 1896, Vidraria Santa Marina was risen next to the station, which contributed for the industrialization of the region, which peak was the implantation of the huge industrial complex Ind\u00fastria Reunidas F\u00e1bricas Matarazzo, in 1920 in the station surroundings, attracting even more passengers and cargos for the station. In the 1890s, SPR reformed many stations, classifying them as first and third classes station. Slowly, the station building was becoming smaller for the growing demand. Another problem faced by the station was Tiet\u00ea River, which floods flooded the station yard, interrupting the traffic. With the river retification, between the 1930s and 1960s, the region began to suffer less with floodings. With the nationaliza\u00e7\u00e3o of S\u00e3o Paulo Railway, in 1946, the Federal Government signed cooperation contracts with United States, created the Brazil-United States Mixed Committee for Economic Development. Working between 1951 and 1953, the committee established basic parameters for the modernization of Santos-Jundia\u00ed Railway, including its stations. Between mid-1950s and the end of 1960s, many stations were rebuilt, including \u00c1gua Branca. The new station received large accesses and a new administrative building, opened in the 1960s, having its catwalk opened on 20 October 1976. In the 1970s, the station was planned to receive the Metro East-West line, but the project wasn't realized. Slowly, the problems with Santos-Jundia\u00ed commuter trains (and its successor, CBTU) grew, and the station went into decay, which peak was reached in the beginning of the 1990s. On 1 June 1994, the station and the line were assumed by the state through the CPTM. Besides it wasn't depredated during th 1996 CPTM riots, the station was closed for 6 months, along with the entire line. Currently, it is part of CPTM Line 7-Ruby. ==Toponymy== The \u00c1gua Branca denomination was created in mid-19th century, to name of the brooks which went through the region. \u00c1gua Branca Brook is currently channeled under part of Avenida Sumar\u00e9 and Rua Turia\u00e7u. The current brook under \u00c1gua Branca station was named \u00c1gua Preta. The waters of \u00c1gua Branca Brook run down to \u00c1gua Preta, which run down to Tiet\u00ea River. ==Projects== CPTM studies the modernization of \u00c1gua Branca station since its 2003 Director Plan. In 2010, the N&W; Arquitetos offices was hired to develop a station hybrid project, to attend the Line 6 project and CPTM future projects, such as S\u00e3o Paulo-Campinas Intercities Train and burial of the railway between Lapa and Br\u00e1s. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1891 ",
