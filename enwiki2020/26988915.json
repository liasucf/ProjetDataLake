    "text": "The Pine Creek Indian Reservation is the home of the Nottawaseppi Huron Band of Potawatomi (NHBP), a federally-recognized tribe of Potawatomi in the United States. The reservation headquarters is located at 1485 Mno-Bmadzewen Way, between Fulton, Michigan and Athens, Michigan. The historic structures on the reservation were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. ==History== In 1838, members of the Potawatomi nation were forcibly removed from local lands to Kansas, in an operation known as the Potawatomi Trail of Death. During this removal, a group of Tribal Members escaped and returned to their native lands in Michigan. In 1845, Chief Moguago purchased a 120-acre parcel of land along the Pine Creek, and established the Pine Creek Indian Reservation. With the help of Europeans in nearby Athens, the Potawatomi constructed several houses and a school. ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calhoun County, Michigan Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1845 Category:Potawatomi Category:Anishinaabe reservations and tribal-areas in the United States Category:Native American tribes in Michigan ",
