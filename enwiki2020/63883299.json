He was a Research Assistant Professor of Computational & Systems Biology Department at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. He was 37 years old at the time of his death, in which he was shot dead in his home. The case received American and Chinese media coverage. ==Death== Liu was found dead at his home on May 2, 2020. His work on coronaviruses led to speculation that his murder was related to his work, but Pittsburgh Police said that he was shot as a result of a murder-suicide. The gunman was 46-year-old software engineer Hao Gu. The police said that the murder was the result of a dispute over an intimate partner and that after murdering Bing Liu the gunman had gone back to his car and shot himself. == Works == ===Books=== * B Liu.
