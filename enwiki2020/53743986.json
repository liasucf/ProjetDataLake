The church is part of the Valle og Hyllestad parish in the Otredal deanery in the Diocese of Agder og Telemark. The white, wooden, octagonal church was built in 1838 by Anders Thorsen Syrtveit using plans by the famous architect Hans Linstow. == History == The church is the third church to be built in Hylestad, although the previous churches were not built in the present location. The first was the medieval Hylestad Stave Church which was torn down in the 1600s, and the second one was taken down in the 1830s due to deterioration of the building. The second church was located at Bj\u00f8rgum on the eastern shore of the river Otra, but the majority of the municipal residents lived on the west side, so the new (3rd) church was built on the west side, just alongside the local post road, now Norwegian National Road 9. The present church seats about 200 people. == Media gallery == 2174\\.
