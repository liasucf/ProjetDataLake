    "text": "Sheila Terry (born 7 June 1950) is an Irish Fine Gael Party politician who served as a member of the 22nd Seanad \u00c9ireann. As a member of the Progressive Democrats (PDs), Terry was elected at the 1991 local elections as a PD member of Fingal County Council for the Castleknock electoral area. She stood as a PD candidate in the Dublin West constituency at the 1992 general election and at the by-election in 1996. She left the Progressive Democrats before the 1999 local elections, when she was re-elected to the council as an independent, and joined Fine Gael in about 2000. She then stood as a Fine Gael for D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann in the Dublin West constituency at the 2002 general election, but did not win a seat. However, in the subsequent Seanad elections she was elected by the Industrial and Commercial Panel. She gave up her council seat when the dual mandate was abolished in 2003, and did not contest the 2007 general election. She stood again in the 2007 Seanad election, but lost her seat. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Progressive Democrats politicians Category:Fine Gael senators Category:Members of the 22nd Seanad Category:21st-century women members of Seanad \u00c9ireann Category:Councillors of Dublin County Council Category:Local councillors in Fingal Category:Politicians from Fingal ",
