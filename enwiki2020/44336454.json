    "text": "Shine On is the eighth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan, released on 6 May 2014 by Verve Records. It was recorded in Vancouver and produced by longtime collaborator Pierre Marchand. According to McLachlan, the album was inspired by her father's passing and her own appreciation of life. ==Background== Three years since her last release, Laws of Illusion, McLachlan began production of the new album with her longtime collaborator/producer, Pierre Marchand. Unlike its predecessor, which dissected the dissolution of her marriage, Shine On eases up on the heartbreak and lets McLachlan show an earthier side. \u201cI needed to challenge myself a lot,\u201d she said. \u201cI needed to step outside my comfort zone. For that reason, I made an effort to write with people I hadn't written with before and to try different producers, like Bob Rock, to take some of the songs in a different direction.\" In addition to experiment new sounds, McLachlan also changed things on the lyrical front: \u201cI wanted to tell a new story. I was feeling more hopeful, more positive and light and open, and I wanted to mirror that.\u201d Songs such as \"Surrender and Certainty\" and \"Song for My Father\" were inspired on McLachlan's father passing away in December 2010. ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart (2014) !scope=\"col\"|Position |- !scope=\"row\"|Canadian Artists Albums (Nielsen SoundScan) |8 |- !scope=\"row\"|US Billboard 200 |156 |- |} ==Certifications and sales== ==Credits== *Kharen Hill - photography for album artwork and publicity ==References== Category:2014 albums Category:Sarah McLachlan albums Category:Albums produced by Pierre Marchand Category:Verve Records albums Category:Juno Award for Adult Contemporary Album of the Year albums ",
