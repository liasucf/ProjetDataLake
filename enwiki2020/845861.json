He was engineer and surveyor on the Dudley Canal until 1783, and consulted by them later when they were extending through Dudley Tunnel. *1774 \u2013 with John Priddy he surveyed the Stroudwater Canal *1782 \u2013 with Thomas (Junior), he made recommendations for improvements to the River Trent. *1784 \u2013 advised on the Coventry Canal's aqueduct over the River Tame. *1789 \u2013 cutting contractor on the Cromford Canal. *1791, he became a shareholder of the Neath Canal. The latter part of his career was spent in Monmouthshire, Glamorganshire, and Montgomeryshire, for example on the Monmouthshire & Brecon Canal in the early 1790s, often working with his two sons. He worked on many canal projects, including the Neath and the Aberdare, in many of which he was also a shareholder. Until 1794, with his son and Thomas Sheasby, he was engineer and contractor on the Glamorganshire Canal, until they had a row with the company and were arrested for alleged overpayments. The matter was later resolved in their favour and they were exonerated. His last canal was the Montgomeryshire, where he succeeded his son John as engineer in July 1797. ==See also== *Canals of the United Kingdom *History of the British canal system ==References== * Category:1809 deaths Category:English canal engineers Category:People from South Staffordshire District Category:Year of birth missing ",
