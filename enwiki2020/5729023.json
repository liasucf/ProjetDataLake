    "text": "Queen Victoria sits above the main entrance alt= The Victoria Law Courts on Corporation Street, Birmingham, England is a Grade I listed red brick and terracotta building that now houses Birmingham Magistrates' Court. ==History== Designed by Aston Webb & Ingress Bell of London after an open competition in 1886, assessed by architect Alfred Waterhouse, to provide the first assize courts in the rapidly growing town of Birmingham, it is faced entirely in deep red terracotta from the clay of Ruabon in North Wales and covered in intricate terracotta ornamentation. A statue of Queen Victoria by Harry Bates surmounts the main entrance. Other figures are by sculptor William Silver Frith to designs by Walter Crane. The rear of the building is less elaborately decorated. The foundation stone was laid by Queen Victoria on 23 March 1887 in her Golden Jubilee year. Built by Birmingham firm John Bowen and Sons, the courts were opened on 21 July 1891 by the Prince and Princess of Wales. Additions were made adding a projecting bow window on the left in 1891\u201394 and extensions along Newton Street in 1914. The interior, including the Great Hall, is faced with sandy-yellow terracotta and intricate ornamentation. The terracotta used for the interior was produced by Gibbs and Canning Limited of Tamworth. The chandeliers in the great hall resemble Queen Victoria\u2019s coronation crown and were the first outside London to be powered by electricity. Standing at the northern end of the shopping street, it is complemented by the similarly coloured Methodist Central Hall, which stands opposite. The site was previously occupied by Alaska Works and a small school. ==Future== A proposal was made, prior to the 2010 UK General Election, to move the Magistrates' Court to a new purpose-built building nearby. This proposal was shelved, indefinitely, by the incoming coalition government led by David Cameron as Prime Minister, with Ken Clarke as the Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice (being the responsible Minister). ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Grade I listed law buildings Category:Court buildings in England Category:Government buildings completed in 1891 Birmingham, Victoria Category:Grade I listed buildings in Birmingham ",
