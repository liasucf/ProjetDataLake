    "text": "Peak 5390, also known as Veniaminof Peak and Lacey Peak, is the highest peak on Baranof Island and the Alexander Archipelago which are located in southeast Alaska. Peak 5390 is an informal name, named after the peak's height in feet, but is unnamed by USGS maps. Peak 5390 ranks as the highest island-based peak in the U.S. outside of the Aleutian Islands in Alaska and volcanos on Hawai'i and Maui islands. Peak 5390 takes most backpackers one or two nights to approach due to its central location on Baranof Island. However, the peak is a nunatak and the final ascent is relatively short; only the tip of the mountain emerges from the surrounding icefield. The route to Peak 5390 navigates ridges, a cul-de-sac glacier, a glacial headwall, a seasonal bergschrund, and a large icefield. Only experienced climbers should undertake a trip, and local knowledge is recommended. On a clear day, the mainland, the Coast Mountains, and distinguished peaks such as Devils Thumb and other spires in the Stikine Icecap are visible from the summit. Conversely, Peak 5390 is clearly visible from the Baranof Cross-Island Trail with only the Baranof River valley separating the two. ==External links== * PeakBagger site, includes trip reports and photos Category:Mountains of Alaska Category:Mountains of Sitka, Alaska ",
