    "text": "Atari ST User was a British computer magazine aimed at users of the Atari ST range. It started life as a pull-out section in Atari User magazine. From March 1986 onwards it became a magazine in its own right, outliving its parent by a number of years. It was published by Europress in London. Although ST User did review games and carry demos, far more of the magazine was concerned with 'serious' issues such as hardware, programming, and music than its rivals ST Action and ST Format. Towards the end of its print run, ST User merged with the game-oriented magazine ST Action, and publication finally ceased in November 1994, leaving ST Format as the only surviving Atari ST publication that was still widely available. ==References== Category:Atari ST magazines Category:Defunct computer magazines published in the United Kingdom Category:Magazines established in 1986 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1994 Category:Magazines published in London Category:Monthly magazines published in the United Kingdom ",
