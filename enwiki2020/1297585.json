His wife, Evalyn Walsh McLean, was a prominent Washington socialite. McLean was also a thoroughbred racehorse owner, and purchaser of the Hope Diamond, which was traditionally believed to carry a curse. McLean was declared insane and died in a psychiatric hospital. ==Early life== McLean was born into a publishing fortune founded by his paternal grandfather, Washington McLean, who owned The Washington Post and The Cincinnati Enquirer. He was the only child of John Roll McLean, for whom McLean, Virginia, is named, and the former Emily Truxtun Beale, daughter of Edward F. Beale and the former Mary Edwards. Emily was a hostess and socialite who was the inspiration for the character Victoria Dare in the 1880 comic novel, Democracy: An American Novel by Henry Brooks Adams. He attended Brooks Debartolo Collegiate High School.Gerald Thompson, \"Edward F. Beale and the American West\", University of New Mexico Press, 1983, page 219. ==Career== In 1916, Edward inherited The Washington Post, which he owned and published until 1933. ===Thoroughbred horse racing=== In 1915, Edward McLean acquired Belmont Plantation,New York Times \u2013 March 24, 1931 where he had built a horse stable and training track for Thoroughbreds.May 10, 1915 Involved with show horses for a number of years,New York Times - September 4, 1912 in 1917, McLean purchased 32 racehorses and hired trainer H.

Hurley.Chicago Daily Tribune \u2013 December 2, 1931 ==Hope Diamond ownership== On January 28, 1911, in a deal made in the offices of The Washington Post, McLean purchased the Hope Diamond for US$180,000 from Pierre Cartier of Cartier Jewelers on Fifth Avenue in New York City. A clause in the sale agreement for the diamond, which was widely believed to have brought death and disaster to its owners, stated that \"Should any fatality occur to the family of Edward B. McLean within six months, the said Hope diamond is agreed to be exchanged for jewelry of equal value\". By March, the diamond had not been paid for in accordance with the terms in the sale agreement. Cartier hired a lawyer to sue McLean for payment. McLean responded by saying that the diamond was on loan for inspection.New York Times, March 10, 1911 On February 2, 1912 The New York Times reported, \"Wealthy Purchasers of Famous Stone to Retain It Despite Sinister Reputation.\"New York Times, February 2, 1912 The Mcleans purchased the diamond for $180,000. For eight years, the bad luck association of the diamond was not evident. However, some subsequent events led to further speculation of the curse. In 1997, The Washington Post referenced its former publisher, the feckless Ned McLean, as \"more of a curse even than the diamond\".\"HOPE & DESPAIR: THE 'CURSE' OF THE DIAMOND\", by Sarah Booth Conroy, September 29, 1997.

Harding and first lady Florence Harding.Palm Beach Post - May 11, 1932 McLean was also a friend of Secretary of the Interior Albert B. Fall, through whom he became embroiled in the Teapot Dome scandal. McLean falsely told investigating Senator Thomas J. Walsh that he had given Fall a $100,000 loan when, in fact, Fall had illegally received money from private oil companies. When Walsh threatened to have McLean charged with perjury, McLean admitted the falsity of his claim. This admission was later characterized as \"the first climactic sensation\" and \"the smoking gun\" of the scandal. ===Divorce, mental illness, and death=== The McLean marriage ended with much publicized and bitterly contested divorce proceedings, initiated by Mrs. McLean on grounds of infidelity, in October 1931. McLean filed for divorce in a Mexican court, but his wife obtained a permanent injunction from a District of Columbia court ordering the cessation of the Mexican proceedings.
