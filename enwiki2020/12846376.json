It is named after Marshall C\u00e2ndido Mariano da Silva Rondon (1865\u20131958), a Brazilian explorer. It is operated by Aeroeste. ==History== Marechal Rondon International Airport was inaugurated in 1956 but operated precariously until the first passenger terminal building was completed in 1964. Infraero became the operator of the airport in 1975 and in 1996 it was upgraded to international status. The first phase of the construction of the new passenger terminal was completed on 30 June 2006. The second phase would involve the demolition of the old terminal building and the construction of the enlargement of the new passenger terminal on its place. On 31 August 2009, Infraero unveiled a BRL30.9 million (US$16.3 million; EUR11.4 million) investment plan to up-grade Marechal Rondon International Airport focusing on the preparations for the 2014 FIFA World Cup which was held in Brazil, Cuiab\u00e1 being one of the venue cities. The investment was distributed in the renovation of passenger the terminal, parking and access to the airport. On March 15, 2019 Aeroeste won a 30-year concession to operate the airport. ==Airlines and destinations== Air view of the airport ==Accidents and incidents== *7 December 1960: a Real Curtiss C-46A-60-CK Commando registration PP-AKF belonging to Transportes A\u00e9reos Nacional operating flight 570 from Cuiab\u00e1 to Manaus-Ponta Pelada crashed on Cachimbo mountains.
