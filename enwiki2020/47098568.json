Forty-one All-Star Games have been held since the Sabres entered the league in 1970, with at least one player chosen to represent the Sabres in each year except 2004 and 2011. The All-Star game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively, 1995, 2005, and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages, and 2006, 2010, and 2014 because of the Winter Olympic Games. Buffalo has hosted one of the games. The 31st took place at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium. * Selected by fan vote * Selected as one of four \"last men in\" by fan vote * All-Star Game Most Valuable Player2014\u201315 NHL Official Guide & Record Book, p. 234 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+Buffalo Sabres players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game2014\u201315 Buffalo Sabres Media Guide, p.297 |- !scope=\"col\" | Game !scope=\"col\" | Year !scope=\"col\" | Name !scope=\"col\" | Position !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| References |- !
