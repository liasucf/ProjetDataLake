He attended City University in London, England where he studied international journalism and took interest in the way the media reported the Arab world while studying for a master's degree in international journalism. In March 2000, Nashashibi was a signer of a letter from Palestinian intellectuals who insisted that the people of Israel fully withdraw - including from Jerusalem, and permit the return of Palestinian refugees. In October 2001, about a month after the September 11 attacks by the Islamic terrorist group al-Qaeda upon the United States, Nashashibi noted how Palestinians supported Osama bin Laden's call for justice concerning their plight and how, unless Palestinians' plight is justly addressed, \"the likes of bin Laden will continue to find favour.\" In 2008, Nashashibi received a \"Breakaway Award,\" awarded to promising new journalists, from the Next Century Foundation's International Council for Press and Broadcasting. The award recognises achievements in balanced reporting on the Middle East. Nashashibi's work includes writings and publications, interviews on television and radio, and invited speaking and debating at universities and colleges. He has worked and trained with many organisations such as Dow Jones Newswires, Reuters, the UN Development Programme in Palestine, the Middle East Broadcasting Centre, and the Middle East Economic Survey in Cyprus. ==Selected publications== * * * ==See also== *Nashashibi, name of a prominent Palestinian family based in Jerusalem ==References== ==External links== *Official Site of Arab Media Watch Category:Alumni of City, University of London Category:Palestinian journalists Category:British Muslims Category:British people of Iraqi descent Category:British people of Palestinian descent Category:British people of Syrian descent Category:Jordanian journalists Category:Jordanian people of Iraqi descent Category:Jordanian people of Palestinian descent Category:Jordanian people of Syrian descent Category:Lebanese journalists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
