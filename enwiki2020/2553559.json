    "text": "Southern white-breasted hedgehog. The southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), sometimes referred to as white-bellied hedgehog or white-chested hedgehog, is a hedgehog of Southwestern Asia. It is very similar in lifestyle and appearance to the European hedgehog, but the former has a white spot on its chest. For a long time these two species were considered to be one. The northern white-breasted hedgehog of Eastern Europe and Russia was formerly recognized as a subspecies of the southern white-breasted hedgehog but newer investigations see both as different species. The southern white- breasted hedgehog and European hedgehog can hybridize. Unlike its European counterpart, the southern white-breasted hedgehog never digs dens. It prefers building grass nests in secluded places. ==References== southern white- breasted hedgehog Category:Mammals of Europe Category:Mammals of Western Asia Category:Mammals of the Middle East Category:Mammals of Turkey Category:Least concern biota of Asia Category:Least concern biota of Europe southern white- breasted hedgehog southern white-breasted hedgehog ",
