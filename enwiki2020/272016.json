    "text": "Clapham Junction railway station () is a major railway station and transport hub near St John's Hill in south-west Battersea in the London Borough of Wandsworth. It is from and from ; it is on both the South Western main line and Brighton main line as well as numerous other routes and branch lines passing through or diverging from the main lines at this station. Despite its name, Clapham Junction is not located in Clapham, a district situated approximately to the south-east. Routes from London's south and south-west termini, Victoria and Waterloo, funnel through the station, making it the busiest in EuropeGreat British Railway Journeys (Series 4, Episode 7): \"Woking to Clapham Junction\" BBC Two, 15 January 2013 by number of trains using it: between 100 and 180 per hour except for the five hours after midnight. The station is also the busiest UK station for interchanges between services,Office of Rail Regulation, Station Usage Estimates 2011\u201312 and the only railway station in Great Britain with more interchanges than entries or exits. ==History== On 21 May 1838 the London and Southampton Railway became the London and South Western Railway (L&SWR;), and opened its line from as far as Woking. Details of roof support columns The second line, initially from Nine Elms to Richmond, opened on 27 July 1846. Nine Elms was replaced in 1848 as the terminus by Waterloo Bridge station, now Waterloo. The line to Victoria opened by 1860. Clapham Junction opened on 2 March 1863, a joint venture of the L&SWR;, the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&SCR;) and the West London Extension Railway (WLER) as an interchange station for their lines.The west London Railway and the W.L.E.R, H.V.Borley & R.W.Kidner, 1981 reprint, The Oakwood Press, Usk Monmouthshire. The railway companies, to attract a middle- and upper-class clientele, seized the nonindustrial parish calculating that being upon the slopes of Clapham's plateau would only reinforce this distinction, leading to a long-lasting misunderstanding that the station is in Clapham.Year's Art, published 1922, London, p. 500Directory of British Architects, 1834\u20131914: Vol. 2 (L-Z) A. Brodie (ed), 2001, Continuum, London, p.12 A British Rail Class 73 with track workers maintaining the railway in 1986 under British Rail. ===Discontinued proposals=== A planning application from Metro Shopping Fund was withdrawn before governmental planning committee consideration on 20 May 2009. A 'Heathrow Airtrack' to reduce the 95-minute journey by tube and Gatwick Express to Gatwick and unite the Great Western Main Line with Heathrow, Gatwick and the South Western Main Line was cancelled in 2011 following improvements to the 2005-built Heathrow Connect track from Hayes and Harlington and practical impediments, such as pressure for continued high-frequency services on the three deemed-'entrenched' semi-fast and slow services between Clapham Junction and Staines. Overground, the change would have been at Clapham Junction. ===Incidents and accidents=== ====Clapham rail disaster==== On the morning of 12 December 1988, two collisions involving three commuter trains occurred slightly south west of the station due to a defective signal. Thirty-five people died and more than 100 were injured. ====Track bombing==== On the morning of 16 December 1991, a bomb ripped through tracks on one of the station's platforms, causing major disruption to the rail network. The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) claimed responsibility. ==The Junction== A 1912 Railway Clearing House map of lines around Clapham Junction. The station is named Clapham Junction because it is at the junction of several rail lines. The name is not given to any rail junction near the station which, without end-on intercompany junctions, are: * Falcon Junction at the south end of the station, where the West London Line (WLL) joins the Brighton Slow Lines * Ludgate Junction at the eastern end of the Windsor Line platforms to the WLL * Latchmere SW Junction connecting the WLL to the Windsor lines at Ludgate Junction. * Latchmere Main Junction connecting the WLL to the Brighton Line at Falcon Junction. * West London Extension Junction and Junction for Waterloo, relaid for Eurostar empty-stock moves from the Windsor Lines to the WLL. * Pouparts Junction where the low-level and high-level approaches to Victoria split. ==The station today== Each day more than 2,000 trains, over half of them stopping, pass through the station, more than through any other station in Europe.\"Great British Railway Journeys (Series 4, Episode 7): Woking to Clapham Junction\" BBC2, UK TV Channel, 15/01/13 At peak times up to 200 trains per hour pass through of which 122 stop. It is not the busiest station by number of passengers, most of whom (about 430,000 on a weekday, of which 135,000 are at rush hours) pass through. Interchanges make some 40% of the activity and on that basis too it is the busiest station in the UK.Delta Rail, 2008\u201309 station usage report, Office of the Rail Regulation website In 2011 the station had three entrances, all with staffed ticket offices, though only the south-east entrance is open 24 hours a day. The most heavily used of the three, this leads from St John's Hill via a small indoor shopping centre into a subway some wide, that connects to the eastern ends of all platforms. The north entrance, which has restricted opening hours, leads from the Winstanley Estate on Grant Road to the same subway. The subway is crowded during rush hours, with the ticket barriers at the ends being pinch points. The south-west entrance, also known as the Brighton Yard entrance, as the buildings still bear signage for the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, is of a more traditional appearance, with a Victorian station building set at the back of a large forecourt. This entrance leads to a very wide covered footbridge, which joins the western ends of all platforms. This entrance includes cycle parking and a taxi rank. It was re-opened in May 2011 as part of a wider programme of access improvements that included installing lifts to the platforms.Route Plans 2007 \u2013 Route 3 \u2013 South West Main line published by Network Rail, 2007 \u2013 See page 20 There are public and disabled toilets at the south-west entrance. There are refreshment kiosks in the subway, on the footbridge and on some platforms; and a small shopping centre, including a small branch of Sainsbury's supermarket, in the south-east entrance. British Transport Police maintain a neighbourhood policing presence, whereas the Metropolitan Police Service and the part-Transport for London funded Safer Transport Command provides a police presence in the area outside the station. 9 December 2012 saw the opening of a new platform for the East London Line, creating an orbital railway around inner London. Overcrowding is most frequent in the often convenient but narrow cross-platform subway. Using this rather than the wide, elegant flying concourse for interchange, a visitors' eyes assessment of fabric and environment listed Clapham Junction in the most needy 10% of Department for Transport category B stations. ===Platforms=== The subway at Clapham Junction during the night.

The footbridge. Clapham Junction in 2001. ==Future proposals== In 2007 the alignment of one of the two variants of Crossrail 2, via the station rather than Putney and Wimbledon, was safeguarded. The Department for Transport and Transport for London continue to discuss proposal for a Clapham Junction Northern Line extension and its London Underground alignment has been legally reserved through Battersea Park,Clapham Junction next for Northern Line says London Assembly member Wandsworth Guardian and would connect Clapham Junction to the London Underground for the first time. Government and Network Rail funding for in the early 2010s of \u00a350 million of improvements was granted. This comprised an upgrade to the main interchange: new entrances and more retail.Chris Green & Sir Peter Hall, Better Rail Stations , November 2009 In a Network Rail study, it is proposed that platform 0 could reopen for 8-car operations of the West London Line. ==Connections== London Buses routes 35, 37, 39, 49, 77, 87, 156, 170, 219, 295, 319, 337, 344, 345, 639, 670, C3 and G1 and night routes N19, N31, N35 and N87 serve the station. ==Notes and references== ===Notes=== ===References=== ==External links== *Network Rail Details *Short History of Clapham Junction prepared by Wandsworth Council, and from which much of the information in the history section of this entry is sourced *1988: 35 dead in Clapham rail collision BBC News report on the 1988 train collisions *Local news website *Yes, Clapham Junction is that bad.
