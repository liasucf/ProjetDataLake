From 1981 to 1988, he was a journalist at the Stuttgarter Zeitung and from 1988 to 1997 he was a journalist at Tagesspiegel in Berlin. Then, Martenstein took up for a short time the line of the culture editorship at the Abendzeitung (AZ) in Munich. However, he returned a little later as senior editor to the Tagesspiegel. Since 2002, he has written a column for Die Zeit titled \"Lebenszeichen\", which since May 24, 2007 appears in Zeit-Magazin LEBEN (a supplement to Die Zeit) as \"Harald Martenstein\". Since 2004 Martenstein also writes a column for GEO Kompakt. His second novel, Gef\u00fchlte N\u00e4he (Felt close) received rather critical reviews. In 2004, he received the Egon-Erwin-Kisch-Preis for the second best investigative report published in German in 2004. Martenstein had dealt with the internal conflicts in Suhrkamp, a major publisher of literary works with longstanding legal conflicts between its owners. In February 2007, Martenstein's novel debut Heimweg was released and later won the Corine Deb\u00fctpreis. He has also published several volumes of his collected columns under different titles. Martenstein lives in Berlin-Kreuzberg. == Works == * M\u00e4nner sind wie Pfirsiche. C. Bertelsmann, M\u00fcnchen, 2007, * Heimweg. Roman, C.
