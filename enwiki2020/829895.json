    "text": "Bad Salzuflen is a town and thermal spa resort in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. At the end of 2013, it had 52,121 inhabitants. ==Geography== Bad Salzuflen lies on the eastern edge of the Ravensberg Basin, at the confluence of the rivers Salze (Bega) with the Werre. In comparison to other North Lippe communities it is densely populated. The city centre is surrounded by districts with a village like feel to them and agricultural land. North east of the River Werre and Salze (Bega) runs a strand of the Lipper highlands runs through the largely wooded hills with elevations up to 250 meters in the city. The lowest point is on the border of the River Werre at Herford at about 70 meters. Since 2008, the city is part of the Teutoburg Forest Nature Park / Eggegebirge. The municipal area is crossed by the river floodplains of the Werre, and Salze. Podzol and Stagnosol brown soils prevail as soil types. The podzolic soils are mainly found in layers from the Tertiary Period, which are crossed by fault block from the Mesozoic. Characteristic of Bad Salzuflen are the saline springs that emerge at these geological folds and which give the region the name of \"Germany's healing garden\". {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style= style=\"text- align:left;\"| Name || style=\"text-align:left\" | Drilled in: || style=\"text- align:left\" | Depth [m]|| style=\"text-align:left\" | Temperature [\u00b0C] || Used for: || Image |- | Paulinenquelle || 1802 || 63 ||12,2|| Inhalation Gradierung||30x30px |- | Loosequelle ||1889/91 || 400||14,25 || Drinking Cure||30x30px |- | Leopold- Thermalsprudel|| 1904/6||534||21,7|| Bathing|||30x30px |- | Neubrunnen|| 1913|| 54|| 12,2|| Bathing ||30x30px |- | Gustav Horstmann Thermalsprudel|| 1919/27|| 1018|| 38,0|| Bathing ||30x30px |- | Inselquelle|| 1936|| 52,4|| 12,6 || Drinking Cure ||30x30px |- | Sophienbrunnen|| 1953|| 12,5|| 11,7 || Drinking Cure || |- | Thermalsprudel III|| 1956/60|| 412,75|| 21,4 || Bathing ||30x30px |- | Sophienquellen (a und b)|| 1962|| 49,6 9,0|| 13,05 13,55|| Gradation Bathing||30x30px |} Bad Salzuflen Geothermal map The geothermal heat sources are of sufficient quality that it makes it viable to use heat recovery systems utilising borehole heat exchangers and heat pumps. ===Expansion and use of the urban area=== The part of Bad Salzulfen classified as the main central town covers an area of . The municipal area has a roughly oval shape, with a maximum extension in east\u2013west direction and 13 km in north\u2013south direction of 11 km. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#efefef;\" ! style= style=\"text-align:center;\"|Area by Use||Agriculture||Forest||Buildings and open space|| Traffic area||Water||Sport and green area|| Other use||Total |- |Area in km2||57.51||15.01||17.20||6.30||1.22||2.42||0.40||100.06 |} ===Neighbouring settlements=== Bad Salzuflen is bordered to the east by the town of Lemgo, to the south by Lage and on the southwest by Leopoldsh\u00f6he. All three communities are part of the district of Lippe. To the west lies the county town of Bielefeld and in the north west, the city of Herford. To the north Bad Salzuflen borders on Vlotho in the district of Herford. Together with Herford, Bad Salzuflen belongs to conurbation of Bielefeld. ===Areas of the town=== The city is divided into twelve districts Bad Salzuflen, Biemsen-Ahmsen, Ehrsen- Breden, Grastrup-H\u00f6lsen (with H\u00f6lserheide), Holzhausen (with Sylbach), Lockhausen, Papenhausen (with Volkhausen) Retzen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe (with Knetterheide), W\u00fclfer-Bexten and the largest area in the district of W\u00fcsten (with Frettholz, Glimke, Heller Hausen, Hollenstein, Pehlen, Pillenbruch, Vo\u00dfhagen and Waldemeine). The most populous districts are Bad Salzuflen with about 19,700 inhabitants, Schotmar with 8,900, Werl-Aspe with 7,500 and W\u00fcsten with 4,000 inhabitants (as of 31 December 2006). Together, these four districts over 70% of the population of Bad Salzuflen. The districts of Bad Salzuflen, Schotmar, Werl-Aspe, Holzhausen and Ehrsen-Breden form a continuous area of settlement. ===Climate=== Bad Salzuflen displays the typical fully humid temperate climate for Central Europe, with its maximum rainfall during the summer. The annual average temperature of 9.3 \u00b0C corresponds to the latitude and the altitude, however, the annual sum of precipitation is 743 mm which is slightly higher than the North German (640 mm) or the German average (690 mm), but due to its location in the rain shadow of the Teutoburg Forest, is slightly lower than the average for Lippe (877 mm). ==History== Der Katzenturm Notgeld der Stadt Bad Salzuflen The first mention of the settlement of Uflon comes in the middle of the eleventh century and of a place of salt nearby. In Old High German \"Uflon\"means The Woods/Forest. This later evolved into Uflen, Mitteluflen and Dorf Uflen. Therefore the entire name means The salt baths in the woods. It was the use of the Pauline salt source in the Middle Ages that led to the establishment of the first Saline. These salt workshops were located at a place which is still called the Salt Yard or Salzhof and the well is represented in the town's coat of arms. Thanks to the lucrative salt trade and the promotion of the town to a city by the Counts of Sternberg, it was fortified with a circular wall and four gates. The Schliepsteiner gateway lies to the north (toward Exter), He\u00dfkamper gateway to North East (toward W\u00fcsten), Arminius to the southeast (toward Schotmar) and Herford Gateway to the West (toward Herford) with three fortified towers which also included the Katzenturm which can still be seen today. Until the Thirty Years' War, trading flourished with the white gold and brought great wealth to the town. The old houses, the sumptuous B\u00fcrgerh\u00e4user and the Town Hall built in 1545/47 bear witness to this. The oldest surviving building in the city today is a three-storey Traufenbau of 1520. Map of the city wall Bad Salzuflen was made famous by its cures. With its three drinking water, three thermal and three salt springs it had the status of a Lippischer State bath. Although the founding of the royal Solebads was made nearly 100 years ago, Salzuflen only received the additional name \"Bad\" on 14 April 1914. Bad Salzuflen was one of the few cities in the Middle Ages that did not suffer from financial difficulties because of its salt production, its topographical position and its thriving commercial development. This is proven today by the many beautiful houses with their typical architectural style for that time. The high healing properties of the water meant that new bath houses were built and other sources were drilled, such as the Leopoldsprudel whose sacred well is in the midst of today's spa gardens. The development of the resort led to significant changes in the cityscape. The saltworks on the Salzhof discontinued salt production and is now the \"town square\" where the weekly market and town festivals take place. The Gradierwerke developed into a place that people with respiratory diseases retreated to. Over time, the long- established industry sectors disappeared and were replaced by the trading and spa industry, which benefited the numerous inns of the city. The economic boom in the 19th Century was also closely followed by the founding in 1850 of the Hoffmann starch factories that later rose to be the biggest European starch producers. The strategic location of Bad Salzuflen was rather insignificant and so was preserved largely during the Second World War from Allied bombing raids, and survived the war relatively unscathed after the war ended. Between 1909 and 1924, the Bad Salzufler und Sch\u00f6tmarschen Stra\u00dfenbahn GmbH plied their trade between those towns. From 1963, the Herford Light railway ran between the towns of Wallenbr\u00fcck, Spenge, Herford, Vlotho, Weserhafen and the west of Herford. ==Religion== In Bad Salzuflen, there are a variety of different religious communities. As the town is in the Protestant dominated Lippe District, they outweigh other evangelical Christians. The Evangelical Reformed Congregation are a part of the reformed Lippe Church and the Evangelical Lutheran congregation are unique in the town. There is a small Roman Catholic presence in the town as well as Baptists, Methodists, Gospel Christians, Mennonite Brethren, New Apostolics and Seventh-day Adventists. There is also a small Muslim community with a mosque in the town. According to the 2011 census, there were 11.6% Roman Catholic Church and 54.5% Evangelical Church with other religions and those stating no religion making up the remaining 33.9%. ===Churches=== At the site of today's Evangelical Reformed Church of St. Kilian (neogothic) on the Kirchplatz in Schotmar stood the original building from around the year 800 AD, the first Christian church in the region. She is the mother parish for many villages in the surrounding area. It is a three-aisled neo-Gothic hall church. The west tower has an octagonal floor, which is crowned by a lantern-like roof riders with steep roof. The Evangelical Reformed City Church is located on the area known as Hallenbrink, the highest elevation within the old town. The core of the late medieval hall building was rebuilt in 1762 after a fire. In 1892 there was a comprehensive renovation and expansion of the building. The most important piece is the pulpit made in 1765 by Heinrich Kamp Meyer. The community center near the town church is a stucco building with stepped gables, built in 1928 in expressionist style. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Redeemer in the Martin-Luther-Stra\u00dfe is run under supervision by Karl Siebold (Schildesche), a neo-Romanesque church built around 1891\u20131892 after a design by architect Hermann Held (Bethel). The foundation stone was laid on 12 July 1891, the inauguration took place on 8 May 1892, the Jubilate Sunday. In 1908\u20131909 the church was enlarged by Karl Siebold to the western part with tower. A new extension was carried out in 1939 by Gerhard Balke (Bethel). The Catholic Church of Our Lady is at the corner of Grabenstra\u00dfe and Woldemarstra\u00dfe. The groundbreaking ceremony was on 23 September 1956 which began construction of the church, which was designed by the architect Joseph Lucas in Paderborn, with the foundation stone laid on 8 December 1956. The consecration took place on 8 March 1959 under the title: \"Mary, Our Lady, Queen of Peace.\" The Evangelical Lutheran Church of the Resurrection on the corner Gr\u00f6chteweg and Volkhausenstra\u00dfe was built in 1964\u20131966 by the architect Loos (Bad Salzuflen). A significant contribution by the artist couple Hans-Helmuth von Rath and Margarete von Rath (Bad Salzuflen) can be seen in the artwork. The foundation stone was laid on 13 July 1964, and on 1 May 1966 the Jubilate Sunday, the church was consecrated. The Church of the Resurrection is used by the Lutheran and Reformed churches.

On 1 January 1969, as part of the implementation of the \"Law for the reorganization of the district Lemgo\", part of the North Rhine-Westphalian territorial reform, the new town of Bad Salzuflen was formed from the two towns of Bad Salzuflen and Schotmar and the ten municipalities Biemsen-Ahmsen, Ehrsen-Breden, Grastrup-H\u00f6lsen, Holzhausen, Lockhausen, Papenhausen, Retzen, Werl-Aspe, W\u00fclfer-Bexten and W\u00fcsten. As part of the implementation of the Bielefeld Act, the districts of Lemgo and Detmold were, on the first January 1973, merged to form the new District of Lippe, to which Bad Salzuflen has since belonged. Bad Salzuflen is part of the parliamentary constituency Lippe I. Dirk Becker (SPD) was re- elected as a direct candidate in 2009 and at the 2012 election, Ute Sch\u00e4fer (SPD). ===City Council=== The City Council currently has 48 seats.

Of the original four existing salt works, only two are completely preserved. A third, whose origins date back to the 17th Century, had to be closed due to disrepair. It was rebuilt after a Council decision as Erlebnisgradierwerk and inaugurated again on 28 July 2007 Festival in July 2007. The salt works are now operated only for short cures. The brine trickles down, the air is enriched near the salt works with the salt, the water droplets bind particles in the air. Inhaling salty air moistens the respiratory tract and positively affects the walls of the respiratory organs. In addition, the fine salt crystals have an expectoprant action on secretions, which intensively cleanse the respiratory of bacteria and can reduce swelling of the mucous membranes. Health resort and spa in the city theater, Parkstra\u00dfe and Wandelhalle (1960\u20131961) and Konzerthalle (1962\u20131963) in the park are excellent examples of resort architecture of the 1960s.
