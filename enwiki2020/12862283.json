    "text": "The G\u00f6ta Signal Corps (), designations S 1 Sk and S 2, was a Swedish Army signal unit, one of the few new formations raised in the 20th century. It was disbanded in 1997. The unit was garrisoned in V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland. == History == Line-up of Signal Troops at G\u00f6ta Signal Regiment (S 2) in 1984. The unit has its origins in a 1944 detached company, Signalregementets kompani i Sk\u00f6vde, of Signal Regiment that was garrisoned in Sk\u00f6vde. The company gained the designation S 1 Sk (1st Signal Regiment, Sk\u00f6vde detachment), and was in 1958 upgraded to a separate battalion, and gained the designation S 2. The battalion was transferred to Karlsborg in 1961 and was renamed G\u00f6ta Signal Regiment in 1962 when it was upgraded to regimental size. The Swedish Army Paratroop School was attached to the regiment from 1961 until the regiment was disbanded in 1984. However one battalion of the regiment was kept as part of Life Regiment Hussars as G\u00f6ta Signal Battalion until it was disbanded in 1997. == Campaigns == *None == Organisation == *? ==Heraldry and traditions== ===Colours, standards and guidons=== On 25 August 1962, His Majesty the King Gustaf VI Adolf presented a colour to the then G\u00f6ta Signal Regiment. When Karlsborg Anti-Aircraft Regiment (Lv 1) was disbanded on 31 March 1961, its colour was transferred to G\u00f6ta Signal Regiment, which carried it on certain occasions. On 1 July 1984, G\u00f6ta Signal Regiment was amalgamated as a training battalion into the Life Regiment Hussars (K 3). The colour was then transferred to the Anti-Aircraft Combat School (Luftv\u00e4rnsskjutskolan, LvSS) on 8 October 1984. Since 1 July 2000, the memory of Karlsborg Anti-Aircraft Regiment is maintained by the Air Defence Regiment (Lv 6). On 30 April 1996, Supreme Commander, general Owe Wiktorin presented a new colour to G\u00f6ta Signal Battalion at the Artillery Yard in Stockholm. It was drawn by Kristina Holmg\u00e5rd-\u00c5kerberg and embroidered by machine in insertion technique by the company Libraria. It was used as battalion colour by S 2 until 1 January 1998. Blazon: \"On green cloth in the centre a circular shield showing the coat of arms of the unit; azure, three wavy white bends sinister charged with a crowned double-tailed yellow lion rampant, armed and langued gules. The shield ensigned with a royal crown proper.
