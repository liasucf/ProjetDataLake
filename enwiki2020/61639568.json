His father was an aerospace engineer that worked on NASA's Project Gemini. Rawlins is the second born of three siblings. He began taking piano lessons at six years old and began playing the trumpet at nine years old and played both instruments consistently throughout his childhood. He and his family relocated to Los Angeles, California in 1965 when Rawlins was eleven years old. His parents frequented live CBS variety television show tapings as a part of the audience and sat next to the orchestra which influenced Rawlins in choosing a career as a professional musician. He attended University High School (Los Angeles) where the school's big band singer was Lorna Luft (daughter of Judy Garland) and Rawlins wrote some of his earliest arrangements for her to sing. His music teacher John Magruder, (who played baritone saxophone with Don Ellis) mentored him in music arranging and career direction. He graduated high school in 1972. While attending CSUN, (California State University at Northridge) Rawlins saw a notice on a bulletin board that composer/arranger Sammy Nestico was teaching a big band and was looking for musicians at nearby Pierce College. Rawlins joined the band for the next two years learning much from Nestico in advanced composition and orchestration techniques. ==Career== In 1974 Rawlins played keyboards with a top 40 band touring throughout Western Canada. Upon returning to Los Angeles in 1975 he began writing music for The Merv Griffin Show and was offered a position as a staff arranger and music librarian. Griffin's featured trumpet player, Jack Sheldon, introduced Rawlins to Benny Goodman to write arrangements that were featured in his 40th Anniversary Concert at Carnegie Hall. In 1979, Rawlins was hired by John Davidson (entertainer) as an arranger at his John Davidson's Singer's Summer Camp (JDSSC) on Catalina Island then hired him to write for his show in Las Vegas and Rawlins went on to compose and arrange music for his The John Davidson Show, which aired for two years. He continued to freelance as a musician, composer and arranger for various commercials, TV shows, and recording projects. ===Isela Sotelo - Angelito (Angel Baby) - Motown Latino Records=== Rawlins produced and arranged Isela Sotelo's radio charting single, Angelito (Angel Baby) released on Motown Latino Records which was earned a spot on the Billboard Hot 100 Latin music charts in 1982. ===Step Right Up=== Before the release of his album Step Right Up (released on Sea Breeze Records) in 1985, Rawitz decided to legally change his last name to Rawlins for the sake of easier pronunciation and spelling. The song, Laguna was played on radio stations throughout the U.S. and was in regular rotation on KTWV (94.7 The Wave) in Los Angeles in 1985. ===Steve March-Torm\u00e9 === Rawlins began working with Steve March-Torm\u00e9 in 1996 as an arranger, composer, and pianist and continues to work with him. Rawlins co-wrote the title track,Swingin' at the Blue Moon Bar & Grille as well as arranged Straighten Up and Fly Right which March-Torm\u00e9 recorded as a duet with his father, Mel Torm\u00e9. ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Album !Artist !Credit |- | rowspan=\"4\" |2019 |The King Symphonic |Shea Arender/Las Vegas Symphony Orchestra |Arranger, Conductor |- |The Romantic |Michael Tinholme |Arranger |- |Lady Stardust |Michael Tinholme |Arranger |- |August Afternoon |Claude Hall |Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"3\" |2017 |Blue Smoke |Mary Bogue |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Piano |- |One Night Of Sin |Mary Bogue |Producer, Arranger |- |The Moonlight Sessions |Lyn Stanley |Arranger |- | rowspan=\"1\" |2016 |Once Upon a Time |Winston Byrd |Piano |- |rowspan=\"2\" |2015 |Interludes |Lyn Stanley |Arranger |- |From The Start |Alistair Tober |Composer |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2014 |Potions |Lyn Stanley |Arranger |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2013 |Lost in Romance |Lyn Stanley |Producer, Arranger |- |rowspan=\"2\" |2012 |Don't Go To Strangers |Mary Bogue |Producer, Arranger, Piano |- |That Old Feeling |Patrisha Thomson |Producer, Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2011 |Kiss of Brazil |Bianca Rossini |Composer, Keyboards |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2009 |Inside Out |Steve March Torm\u00e9 |Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2008 |Last Call |Al Timss |Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2007 |So Far |Steve March Torm\u00e9 |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2006 |Standard Scotch |Scotch Ellis Loring |Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2005 |Benzali |Daniel Benzali |Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"2\" |2003 |A Night For Romance |George Bugatti |Arranger, Piano |- |The Essence of Love |Steve March Torm\u00e9 |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"2\" |2001 |Sunday Drive |Robert Kaufman |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Keyboards |- |Queen of the Night |Ella Leya |Keyboards |- |rowspan=\"3\" |2000 |Buy Me A Martini |Sara Laporte |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Piano |- |Live On the Strip |George Bugatti |Arranger |- |The Night I Fell For You |Steve March Torm\u00e9 |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1999 |Swingin\u2019 At The Blue Moon Bar and Grille |Steve March Torm\u00e9 |Producer, Composer, Arranger |- |rowspan=\"2\" |1998 |Oh, What a Night For Love |George Bugatti |Arranger, Piano |- |Hot Harmonica |Danny Welton |Arranger |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1997 |Summer in San Francisco |Danny Welton |Arranger |- |rowspan=\"2\" |1992 |Bruce Eskovitz |Bruce Eskovitz |Trumpet |- |Time Will Tell |Grant Geissman |Composer |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1991 |Flying Colors |Grant Geissman |Composer |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1988 |Three Gals, Three Guitars |The Del Rubio Triplets |Trumpet |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1986 |Musica Ranchera and Rock and Roll |Isela Sotelo |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Piano, Trumpet |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1985 |Step Right Up |Steve Rawlins |Producer, Composer, Arranger, Trumpet |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1983 |Flip Wilson |Flip Wilson |Arranger, Trumpet |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1982 |Angel Baby (Angelito) |Isela Sotelo |Producer, Arranger, Piano |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1978 |40th Anniversary Concert (Live at Carnegie Hall) |Benny Goodman |Arranger |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1977 |Come Softly |Brenton Wood |Trumpet |- |} ==Film & Television== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Film/TV !Credit !Studio/Production Company |- | rowspan=\"1\" |2014 |The Crazy Ones |Arranger |CBS |- | rowspan=\"1\" |2012 |Carol Channing: Larger than Life |Arranger |Dramatic Forces |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2010 |Arrested Development |Piano |Fox |- | rowspan=\"1\" |2009 |24 (TV Series) |Arranger, Piano |Fox Television |- |rowspan=\"1\" |2000 |Star Trek Voyager |On-Camera Musician, Piano Coach |Paramount |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1998 |All Dogs Go to Heaven: The Series |Arranger |MGM Television |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1997 |Family Matters |On-Camera Musician |CBS |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1996 |Phil Hartman NewsRadio |Arranger |NBC |- |rowspan=\"1\" |1993 |Jeopardy!
