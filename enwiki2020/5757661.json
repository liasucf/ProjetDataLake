Women Screenwriters: An International Guide. Print. ==Background== Fina Torres was born in Caracas. She studied design, photography, and journalism and at the age of 17 became a photojournalist. She enrolled at the Neumann institute for Design in 1970 as a graphics design student and also took social communication at Andr\u00e9s Bello Catholic University. In 1974, she moved to Paris where she would earn a bachelor's degree in cinematography, direction and editing from the Institut des hautes \u00e9tudes cin\u00e9matographiques and spend the next 28 years of her life in the film industry. After Paris, she lived in the United States, Mexico, Singapore, and eventually returned to Venezuela. == Career == During her time in France, Torres worked as a photographer, camera operator, editor, and a film script supervisor. In 1983 she co-wrote a script with Antoine Lacomblez, for which she secured production funds from both Venezuela's state funding agency, FONCINE (Fondo de Fomento Cinematogr\u00e1fico de Venezuela) and the Secretary of Foreign Affaires France. The result would be Torres' first film, Oriana, for which she won the Cam\u00e9ra d'Or award at the Cannes Film Festival.

Was Official Selection Cannes Film Festival 1996, Un Certain Regard. Variety critic Lisa Nesselson July 26, 2000 wrote \"A fantastical romp with a buoyant pace, exotic locations, a finger-popping score, appealing leads and spicy cooking demonstrations.\" \"A contempo fairy tale about thwarted romance, the pic never falters in its adherence to its own bubbly, consistently inventive rhythm.\" In 2010, Torres won the best feature film prize at the Los Angeles Latino International Film Festival with her film Habana Eva. The film also won the Best Venezuelan Film prize at the Margarita Film Festival in Venezuela. Nelmes, Jill, and Jule Selbo. Women Screenwriters: An International Guide. Print.

Though Torres is primarily recognized as a director due to her award at Cannes, she is also a prolific screenwriter, having written the scripts for the majority of her own films, as well as a number of scripts for other directors. She has said that she considers screenwriting to be the most challenging aspect of film-making and is a member of the Writers Guild of America and the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques (SACD) of France.

She has kept a focus on Latin America and Latin American themes throughout her career, and since moving back to Venezuela has taken part in a movement to aid in developing the Venezuelan national film industry. == Social Advocacy == In 1995 Torres was identified as part of a new movement in Latin American cinema focusing less on films with political themes as had been the norm, and more on universal themes like relationships and conflicts between traditional culture and modernity.Vincent, Isabel. \"A 'new Irreverence' Sweeps Latin America.\" The Globe and Mail (Toronto), September 13, 1995. Accessed January 27, 2016. ProQuest. Torres' films in particular, focus on strong female characters who defy patriarchal norms.
