He was the eldest son of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III and his wife, Stephanie, and was crowned king of Pamplona after his father was killed during the Battle of Atapuerca. ==Reign== Sancho was the eldest son and heir of Garc\u00eda S\u00e1nchez III and his wife Stephanie. Garc\u00eda was killed at the Battle of Atapuerca on 1 September 1054 during a war with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. Sancho, who was then fourteen years of age, was proclaimed king by the army in the camp by the field of battle with the consent of the king of Le\u00f3n, Ferdinand I, also his uncle. Sancho's mother served as his regent until her death on 25 May 1058. Remaining faithful to her husband's policies, she continued to support the monastery of Santa Mar\u00eda la Real of N\u00e1jera. Soon after Sancho's accession, many lords in the west of the kingdom went over to the Leonese. Only \u00cd\u00f1igo L\u00f3pez, lord of Biscay, and Sancho Fort\u00fanez, lord of Pancorbo, remained loyal. On 29 December 1062, Sancho and Ferdinand signed a treaty defining their shared border. Ferdinand was recognised as king of all Castile and Sancho's authority was recognised in the Rioja, \u00c1lava, Biscay, and implicitly Guip\u00fazcoa. As king, Sancho received support from his other uncle, King Ramiro I of Aragon. Out of gratitude for \"his friendship, his fidelity, his help and his council\", Sancho gave Ramiro possession of Lerda, Undu\u00e9s and the castle of Sang\u00fcesa. These places were probably to be held as fiefs or in a similar arrangement. Beginning in 1060, Sancho put pressure on al-Muqtadir, king of Zaragoza, and exacted from him annual payments of tribute, parias. == War and assassination == From 1065, he was in conflict with Castile, raised to a kingdom for Ferdinand's son Sancho the Strong. This culminated in the so- called War of the Three Sanchos (1067\u20131068). Years before, Sancho's father had managed to retain a series of frontier lands, including Bureba and Alta Rioja, which had been claimed by Ferdinand. Sancho the Strong sought to reconquer these lands for his kingdom. Faced with an invasion by his cousin the Castilian Sancho, The Navarrese Sancho asked for aid from his other cousin, Sancho of Arag\u00f3n. But their forces were defeated by Sancho the Strong and his trusted alf\u00e9rez (supreme commander) El Cid, Sancho lost Bureba, Alta Rioja, and \u00c1lava to Sancho of Castile. He was assassinated in Pe\u00f1al\u00e9n (Funes), whence his nickname, by a conspiracy headed by his brother Ram\u00f3n Garc\u00e9s (el Fratricida, the Fratricide) and his sister Ermesinda of Navarre. During a scheduled hunt, Sancho was forced from a cliff by his siblings. Upon his assassination, the kingdom was invaded and ultimately partitioned between Sancho of Aragon and a third cousin, Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile. Alfonso occupied La Rioja and Sancho was proclaimed king in Pamplona.
