    "text": "Simply the Truth is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker released by the BluesWay label in 1969. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Richie Unterberger stated: \"Overseen by noted jazz producer Bob Thiele, this session had Hooker backed by some of his fullest arrangements to date ... The slightly modernized sound was ultimately neither here nor there, the center remaining Hooker's voice and lyrics. ... Another of his many characteristically solid efforts, although it's not one of his more interesting albums\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"I Don't Wanna Go to Vietnam\" \u2013 5:36 # \"Mini Skirts\" \u2013 3:28 # \"Mean Mean Woman\" \u2013 5:45 # \"I Wanna Bugaloo\" \u2013 4:15 # \"Tantalizing with the Blue\" \u2013 5:05 # \"(Twist Ain't Nothin') But the Old Time Shimmy\" \u2013 3:19 # \"One Room Country Shack\" \u2013 4:27 # \"I'm Just a Drifter\" \u2013 6:04 ==Personnel== *John Lee Hooker \u2013 guitar, vocals *Hele Rosenthal \u2013 harmonica *Ernie Hayes \u2013 piano, organ *Wally Richardson \u2013 guitar *William Folwell \u2013 bass *Bernard Purdie \u2013 drums ==References== Category:John Lee Hooker albums Category:1969 albums Category:BluesWay Records albums Category:Albums produced by Bob Thiele ",
