The forewings are dark purple, more greyish at the base, with a broad dark yellow fascia nearly in the middle, very nearly straight, but rather nearer the base on the inner margin than on the costa. The hindwings are coppery-brown, but paler at the base.Meyrick, E. (1910).XXII. NOTES AND DESCRIPTIONS OF INDIAN MICRO-LEPIDOPTERA. ==References== Category:Moths described in 1859 Category:Opogona ",
