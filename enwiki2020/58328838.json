    "text": "Latif al-Ani (born 1932 in Baghdad, Iraq) is an Iraqi photographer, often known as \"the father of Iraqi photography\" and noted for his photographic works that combine both ancient and modern themes. During his active career from the 1950s through to the late-1970s, he chronicled an Iraq way of life that was rapidly being lost as the country embarked on a modernisation program. He documented people, ancient monuments and many facets of urban life in Iraq. He stopped taking photographs following the rise of Saddam Hussein, finding that he was unable to maintain his former optimistic outlook for Iraq's future. ==Life and career == Latif al-Ani was born in Baghdad in 1932.Some sources state that he was born in Karbala; See for example, M. Gronlund's \"How Latif Al Ani captured Iraq\u2019s golden era through a lens\" in The National 6 May 2018, Online:, but all sources appear to agree that he grew up in Baghdad During his childhood, relatively few commercial photographers were operating in Iraq. The social and religious prohibitions on making images and figurative representations meant that Iraq was relatively late-adopter of photography and cinematography. A handful of photographers and film-makers, such as Abdul-Karim Tiouti and Murad al-Daghistani, had been operating in Basra and Mosul since the late 19th-century and the early 20th-century, but opportunities for young Iraqis to learn the art of photography were rare.Kalash, K., \"In Digital Technology, Solar Photography is a Time- immemorial Profession, \" Iraq Journal, Online: It was not until the late 1940s, when Al-Ani was an adolescent that the number of commercial photographic studios in Iraq's major cities, including Baghdad, proliferated.\"The First Photographers\", Iraq National Library and Archives, Online: (translated from Arabic) Al-Ani was first exposed to photography when, as a boy, he would help in his older brother's Mutanabbi Street shop which was adjacent to the studio of a Jewish photographer, by the name of Nissan. The young Al-Ani was fascinated. Noting the boy's interest, Al Ani's brother bought him a camera, a Kodak box, in around 1947, when al-Ani was 15 years. After that, the camera never left his side.Ruya Foundation, From the air, I saw things in a different way: photographer Latif al Ani reflects on his life and work, May 1, 2015 His earliest photos were of the everyday scenes and objects in his immediate surroundings- street life, palms, plants, faces and people on rooftops. This type of subject matter would become a recurring theme in his work. In the 1950s, he seized the opportunity to embark on a career in photography. A friend of al-Ani's, Aziz Ajam, was working as an editor for the Iraqi Petroleum Company's in-house magazine. Al-Ani applied for a traineeship there, and in 1954, he began working under the direction of Jack Percival, and effectively became his apprentice. While at IPC, al-Ani learned all aspects of photography, including aerial work.Leech, N., \"Latif Al Ani: chronicler of modernity in a now vanished Iraq\", The National 11 July 2017 Online: As a staff member of the IPC, he took photographs for the company\u2019s Arabic-language magazine, Ahl al-Naf [People of Oil] under Percival's watchful eye.Leech, N., \"Latif Al Ani: Chronicler of Modernity in a now vanished Iraq\", The National 11 July 2017 Online:; Gray, L.A., \"Through the Lens 1953\u20131979: Latif al-Ani\", Art Asia Pacific July\u2013August, 2018 Online: In 1960, he founded the Photography Department at the Ministry of Information (subsequently renamed Ministry of Culture).

This type of work was not only a good fit with Al-Ani's own preoccupations, but also fitted with the government\u2019s socialist agenda. Al-Ani explains his motivations: For his role in chronicling the so-called golden age of Iraq, al-Ani has been labelled as the \"father of Iraqi photography\".Holledge, E., \"Capturing the Social Fabric\" Gulf News, 13 December 2017 Online:; Pelletier, M., \"Images of a Vanished World\", Apollo Magazine, 7 December 2017 Online: In the 1970s, he was appointed as the Head of photography at the Iraqi News Agency.Waters, L., \"Happy Tourists, Hula Hoops, Architectural Wonders: Iraq a You've Never Seen\", The Telegraph (UK), 7 December 2017, Online: This provided further opportunities to document the social and cultural life of Iraq. Throughout his career, he felt compelled to record a way of life that he feared was being lost as the country embarked on a period of 'modernisation'. Al-Ani was an optimist and \u201cwanted to show Iraq as a civilised, modern place.\" At the same time, he was proud of Iraq's ancient Sumerian and Mesopotamian past.Smyth, D., \"The founding father of Iraqi photography gets his first London show\", British Journal of Photography, 16 November 2017 Online: Al-Ani had an instinct for juxtaposing the layers of Iraq's ancient art heritage with distinctly modern themes.

J., \"Latif Al Ani and Iraq\u2019s Golden Age\", Financial Times, (UK) 2 December 2017 Online: For example, his portrait of the US Couple in Ctesiphon shows an American couple visiting the Taq Kisra (arch at Ctesiphon) in the background, while they listen to an elderly Bedouin man seated on the ground playing the rabab.Leech, N., \"Latif Al Ani: Chronicler of Modernity in a Now Vanished Iraq\", The National 11 July 2017 Online:; David, C., \"With or Without Consent: Latif al-Ani's Iraq\", Al Nafas Magazine,February, 2016, Online: In the 1960s and 70s he enjoyed international success, working and exhibiting in the Middle East, Europe and the United States. However, he stopped taking photographs in 1979 when Saddam Hussein's regime placed a ban on taking photographs in public.

His ability to combine Iraq's ancient art heritage within a contemporary format suggests that he was influenced by mid-20th century Iraqi artists, including Jawad Saleem.Wullschlager. J., \"Latif Al Ani and Iraq\u2019s Golden Age\", Financial Times, (UK) 2 December 2017 Online: As with many Iraqi artists, much of his archive was destroyed or looted during the US invasion of Iraq of 2003.Smyth, D., \"The founding father of Iraqi photography gets his first London show\", British Journal of Photography, 16 November 2017 Online: The archive of Arab Image Foundation has several hundred surviving al-Ani photographs.The FAI is currently digitising photographs for its collection.
