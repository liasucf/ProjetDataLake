    "text": "The Diverting Reservoir is a reservoir in the New York City water supply system in the town of Southeast, New York, in Putnam County immediately south of the village of Brewster, New York. Part of the system's Croton Watershed, it lies about north of New York City. Construction impounding the East Branch Croton River began early in the 20th century and was completed by 1911. The Diverting reservoir holds of water at full capacity, making it the smallest in New York City's water supply outside the City itself. Its drainage basin represents of the Croton River watershed. This basin includes the lakes, streams, rivers, and other bodies of water that flow into the reservoir. This includes the beginning portion of the East Branch of the Croton River, which is not impounded. The Diverting Reservoir is also connected to the nearby Croton Falls Reservoir via a channel and dividing weir allowing water to freely pass between. The water in Diverting Reservoir flows into the continuation of the East Branch, which then joins the flow of the West Branch, itself carrying the flow of the Middle Branch, amid the headwaters of the Muscoot Reservoir, the collecting point for most of the Croton Watershed. It continues into the New Croton Reservoir, the final collecting point, then the New Croton Aqueduct. Water from the Aqueduct flows into The Bronx and the Jerome Park Reservoir before entering Manhattan and joining the Catskill Aqueduct. Their combined waters flow through Brooklyn before terminating in Staten Island. In January 2007, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection began a $74 million project of improvements to the Croton Falls Reservoir and the Diverting Reservoir. (See Journal-News article dated Feb. 28, 2007) The upgrading and rehabilitation is part of the city's effort to comply with state and federal dam safety regulations. The work at the Diverting Reservoir includes new valves and pipes, along with redoing the spillway and some of the concrete surfaces on the -high dam. The connecting channel between the two reservoirs will be emptied, inspected and dredged. Construction at both sites is expected to continue until Jan. 31, 2010. ==See also== *List of reservoirs and dams in New York ==References== ==External links== * NYCDEP Water Supply Watersheds-Links to information on reservoirs by system Category:Reservoirs in New York (state) Category:Croton Watershed Category:Protected areas of Putnam County, New York Category:Reservoirs in Putnam County, New York ",
