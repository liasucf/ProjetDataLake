    "text": "Storm Alliance is a Canadian anti-immigration group. It describes itself as \"ultranationalist\" and opposes the Canadian government's immigration policies, which it calls \"collective suicide\". The group has drawn attention for staging protests at Lacolle, Quebec, against asylum seekers entering across the Canada\u2013United States border. It has called them \"illegal immigrants\" and has demanded the Government of Canada reimburse the province of Quebec for the costs incurred for handling them. Storm Alliance was founded in December 2016 by Dave Tregget, who had earlier founded the Quebec chapter of the Finnish far-right group Soldiers of Odin. The group denies any connection with Soldiers of Odin, and Tregget is no longer president of Storm Alliance. The group has participated in protests alongside other far-right groups in Quebec such as La Meute and Atalante. ==References== ===Works cited=== * * * * Category:2016 establishments in Quebec Category:2016 in Quebec Category:Anti- immigration politics in Canada Category:Anti-immigration politics in Quebec Category:Canadian far-right political movements Category:Canadian nationalism ",
