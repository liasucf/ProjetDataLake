    "text": "Ropata Wahawaha ( \u2013 1 July 1897) was a Ng\u0101ti Porou war chief who rose to prominence during New Zealand's East Cape War and to senior command during Te Kooti's War. ==Early life== R\u0101pata Wahawaha was born about 1820 either in Te Puia Springs or Akuaku, in Waiapu. He was of the Te Aowera sub-tribe of the Ng\u0101ti Porou, one of the major M\u0101ori tribes in the eastern regions of the North Island of New Zealand. While still a child he was captured and became the slave of Rapata Whakapuhia whose name he perforce adopted. However, in later years when he rose to prominence he worked closely with Donald McLean who, having a broad Scottish accent, habitually pronounced his name as \"Ropata\" and it became the name by which he is generally known. ==Early adulthood== By 1839 he was back with his own people. In 1849 he married Harata Te Ihi. Harata's nephew Paratene Ngata was raised in their household. During the Invasion of the Waikato a large party of Ngati Porou tried to join the King Movement but were prevented by Te Arawa in the Battle of the Lake.\"CHAPTER 41: ARAWA DEFEAT OF EAST COAST TRIBES\", James Cowan, 1955, \"THE NEW ZEALAND WARS: A HISTORY OF THE MAORI CAMPAIGNS AND THE PIONEERING PERIOD: VOLUME I\" It is not clear where Ropata's sympathies lay at that time. ==Fighting against the Pai M\u0101rire (Hauhau Movement)== However, when in 1865 the Pai M\u0101rire (or Hauhau Movement) came to the East Coast, Ropata was firmly on the Government's side. One influence in his decision might have been his Christianity; he was a leading member of the Anglican diocese of Waiapu. When the Hauhau tried to take over the Waiapu Valley, Ropata led a war party against them. Shortly afterwards the war chief of the Te Aowera was killed in battle and Ropata succeeded him as the War leader of his hap\u016b. The Hauhau had all the advantages; numbers, arms and ammunition. The loyal Ngati Porou appealed to the government for support. Donald McLean, the superintendent for Hawkes Bay sent up the need supplies along with one hundred militia. Ropata played a leading role in the fighting that followed establishing himself as a leading warrior and a dangerous enemy. At one point he found eleven men from his own hapu, Te Aowera, among a group of Hauhau prisoners and he personally shot each one.\"Ropata Wahawaha: The story of his life\", 5 July 1897, Poverty Bay Herald As the fighting in his own area died down Ropata and his Ngati Porou war band were called upon by the government to fight in other areas, most notably to assist the Ng\u0101ti Kahungunu. On 18 August 1865 near Tahutahu-po, where the Hauhaus had taken up a position between Tokomaru Bay and Tolaga Bay. Henare Potae and 36 warriors fought a large body of Hauhaus at Pakura. Ropata and 90 warriors were close by and engaged the Hauhaus, who were decisively defeated. About 200 Hauhaus, who were driven out of Tokomaru, made their way by the middle of September 1865 to Waerenga-\u0101-hika, which was the Church Missionary Society (CMS) mission station that had been established by the Rev. William Williams in the Poverty Bay district. In November 1865 an attack by the Hauhau was feared. HMS Esk was sent to fetch Ropata, Henare Potae and Mokena and 260 Ng\u0101ti Porou warriors from Tokomaru Bay. They were landed at Poverty Bay on 9 November, and, on the same day, 100 Forest Rangers, under Major Fraser, arrived from Waiapu. The mission at Waerenga-\u0101-hika became a battle ground. After the Hauhau were defeated, Te Kooti and his supporters were sent to the Chatham Islands. ==The pursuit of Te Kooti== There followed a brief interval of peace until spring of 1868 when Ropata was called upon once again by the New Zealand Government. This time the enemy was Te Kooti, recently escaped from prison in the Chatham Islands. Te Kooti had retreated to a strong defensive p\u0101 at Ngatapa. The first assault, led by Ropata, Porourangi, and Lieutenants Mair and Preece, was unsuccessful, despite which Ropata was awarded the New Zealand Cross for bravery and promoted to the rank of Major in the militia. Lt Preece was also awarded the New Zealand Cross. Returning to the scene three weeks later Major Ropata and Captain Tom Porter succeeded in separating the defenders from their water supply. An assault on 4 January 1869 forced Te Kooti to evacuate the Pa. In the ensuing flight several hundred Hauhau prisoners were captured and, largely at Ropata's insistence, one hundred and twenty of them\u2014all male combatants\u2014were shot and thrown over a cliff. This would not have been inappropriate according to the customary rules of Maori warfare. However, it was most inappropriate for soldiers of the Crown. Te Kooti fled into the Urewera Mountains; he was driven from there by the Government forces including Ropata and the Ngati Porou. From there he trekked into the central regions of the North Island, mainly around Lake Taupo. However the government pursuit kept him always on the move and some months later he returned to the Ureweras. There were numerous actions, skirmishes, and battles during this time, and Ropata played an important part in many of them. At this stage, early 1870, the government decided to withdraw all Pakeha militia from the pursuit. The hunt for Te Kooti was entrusted to two tribes, Ropata with the Ngati Porou and Kepa with the Whanganui Maori. Only one Pakeha was allowed to accompany the Maori war parties; Ropata asked for and got Tom Porter, now a Colonel, as his second in command. After about two months campaigning Kepa and Ropata managed to catch Te Kooti between their two forces at Maraetahi. In the ensuing battle the Ringat\u016b force was destroyed. Te Kooti escaped, he always did, but most of his men were either captured or killed. The hunt for Te Kooti was to continue for another two years with Ropata being actively involved for most of the time. He also completed the pacification of the Urewera Mountains and the tribe who occupied them, Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe. An expedition, which started from Poverty Bay in June 1871, was divided into four companies of 50 men, each of which could work independently if necessary. The leaders were Ropata, Henare Potae, Captain Porter and Ruka Aratapu. On 1 September 1871 the expedition surrounded Te Kooti's camp at Te Hapua, although Te Kooti escaped. Wi Heretaunga was captured. He was believed to a participant in the murders of Captain James Wilson and his family at Matawhero in November 1868. He was also accused of being involved in the Mohaka massacre in April 1869. It was decided, that he should be shot, and this summary execution was carried out. ==Postwar years== By the end of Te Kooti's War Ropata was recognised as one of the leading men of the Ngati Porou. He used his influence to strengthen the tribe's position both with the Government and with their traditional enemies. The tribe lost very little land by confiscation partly because Ropata helped to persuade many of them to let out their land on long-term leases. In 1875 he stood unsuccessfully for Parliament in the Eastern Maori electorate. In 1878 he was awarded The Sword of Honour from Queen Victoria and appointed commander for the regional militia together with a pension from the Government, originally 200 pounds a year, although later it was halved. He was also a sheep farmer, sometimes successful and sometimes not. By a curious twist of fate he eventually got the chance to arrest Te Kooti. Te Kooti had been pardoned in 1883 and since then had built up a quite large religious following. This was tolerated until 1889 when he decided to return to Poverty Bay, the scene of his earlier exploits. Ropata and Porter, still working together, were appointed by the Prime Minister to make sure Te Kooti did not enter the East Cape or Urewera region. The Ngati Porou were mobilised once again. They arrived on the scene just as Te Kooti was arrested by a police inspector, in time to prevent Te Kooti's followers from making a violent issue of it. Unfortunately Ropata missed the actual arrest because of ill health. On 10 May 1887 he was appointed a member of the Legislative Council. He remained a member until he died. Ropata died in Gisborne on 1 July 1897. His last words were, apparently, \"Where's Porter?\" He was buried on 13 July 1897 at the rock fortress of Puputa in the Waiomatatini Valley, he accomplished a great deal in his life; rising from slavery to be a leader of his people and an important man on the national scene. It is said that there was only one goal he didn't accomplish\u2014he never learned to speak English. ==References== ==External links== * * Wahawaha, Rapata \u2013 Biography in the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography * Rapata Wahawaha on New Zealand History online * ROPATA, Wahawaha, Major from An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand, originally published in 1966 Category:1820s births Category:1897 deaths Category:Military leaders of the New Zealand Wars Category:M\u0101ori politicians Category:M\u0101ori MLCs Category:Members of the New Zealand Legislative Council Category:Ng\u0101ti Porou Category:People from the Gisborne District Category:Recipients of the New Zealand Cross (1869) Category:Ngata family Category:19th-century New Zealand politicians Category:New Zealand M\u0101ori soldiers ",
