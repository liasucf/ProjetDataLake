    "text": "1\\. Fu\u00dfball- und Sportverein Mainz 05 e. V., usually shortened to 1. FSV Mainz 05, Mainz 05 or simply Mainz, is a German sports club, founded in 1905 and based in Mainz, Rhineland-Palatinate. 1. FSV Mainz 05 have played in the Bundesliga, the top tier of the German football league system, for ten consecutive years, starting with the 2009\u201310 season. The club's main local rivals are Eintracht Frankfurt and 1. FC Kaiserslautern. In addition to the football division, 1. FSV Mainz 05 have handball and table tennis departments. ==History== ===Early years=== A failed attempt to start a football club in the city in 1903 was followed up two years later by the successful creation of 1. Mainzer Fussballclub Hassia 1905. After a number of years of play in the S\u00fcddeutschen Fu\u00dfballverband (South German Football League), the club merged with FC Hermannia 07 \u2013 the former football side of Mainzer TV 1817 \u2013 to form 1. Mainzer Fussballverein Hassia 05, which dropped \"Hassia\" from its name in August 1912. Another merger after World War I, in 1919, with Sportverein 1908 Mainz, resulted in the formation of 1. Mainzer Fu\u00dfball- und Sportverein 05. Die Nullf\u00fcnfer were a solid club that earned several regional league championships in the period between the wars and qualified for the opening round of the national championships in 1921, after winning the Kreisliga Hessen. ===Play during the Nazi era=== In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the club earned decent results in the Bezirksliga Main-Hessen \u2013 Gruppe Hessen, including first-place finishes in 1932 and 1933. This merited the team a place in the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest, 1 of 16 new first division leagues formed in the re- organization of German football under the Third Reich. Unfortunately, the club only managed a single season at that level before being relegated, due to the high intensity play that they were unable to keep up with. Karl Scherm scored in 23 out of 44 matches with Mainz during his last season. In 1938, Mainz was forced into a merger with Reichsbahn SV Mainz and played as Reichsbahn SV Mainz 05 until the end of World War II. ===Long march to the Bundesliga=== Historical chart of 1. FSV Mainz league performance after WWII After World War II, the club again joined the upper ranks of league play in Germany's Oberliga S\u00fcdwest, but were never better than a mid-table side. It played in the top flight until the founding of the new professional league, the Bundesliga, in 1963 and would go on to play as a second division side for most of the next four decades. They withdrew for a time \u2013 from the late 1970s into the late 1980s \u2013 to the Amateur Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (III), as the result of a series of financial problems. Mainz earned honours as the German amateur champions in 1982. The club returned to professional play with promotion to the 2. Bundesliga for a single season in 1988\u201389 with Bodo Hertlein as president, before finally returning for an extended run in 1990\u201391. Initially, they were perennial relegation candidates, struggling hard each season to avoid being sent down. However, under unorthodox trainer Wolfgang Frank, Mainz became one of the first clubs in German soccer to adopt a flat four zone defence, as opposed to the then-popular man-to-man defence using a libero. Mainz failed in three attempts to make it to the top flight in 1996\u201397, 2001\u201302, and 2002\u201303, with close fourth-place finishes just out of the promotion zone. The last failed attempt stung as they were denied promotion in the 93rd minute of the last match of the season. One year earlier, Mainz became the best non-promoted team of all-time in the 2. Bundesliga with 64 points accumulated. However, the club's persistence paid dividends after promotion to the Bundesliga in 2003\u201304 under head coach J\u00fcrgen Klopp. The club played three seasons in the top flight but were relegated at the end of the 2006\u201307 season. Mainz then secured promotion back to the top flight just two years later, after the 2008\u201309 season. Mainz also earned a spot in the 2005\u201306 UEFA Cup in their debut Bundesliga season as Germany's nominee in the Fair Play draw which acknowledges positive play, respect for one's opponent, respect for the referee, the behaviour of the crowd and of team officials, as well as cautions and dismissals. Due to the Bruchweg stadium's limited capacity, the home matches in UEFA Cup were played in Frankfurt's Commerzbank-Arena. After defeating Armenian club Mika and Icelandic club Keflav\u00edk in the qualifying rounds, Mainz lost to eventual champions Sevilla 2\u20130 on aggregate in the first round. In the 2010\u201311 season, Mainz equalled the Bundesliga starting record by winning their first seven matches that season. They ended the season with their best finish to date in fifth place, good enough to secure them their second entry to the UEFA Europa League, where they were eliminated in the third qualifying round by Romanian club Gaz Metan Media\u0219. ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club: Historical German domestic league tables Tables and results of all German football leagues {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"#dfdfdf\" | Season | Division | Tier | Position |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1999\u201300 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| 2.

Cup 2011 in der Mainzer Coface Arena Press release Die Nullf\u00fcnfer previously played at the Bruchwegstadion, built in 1928, and modified several times over the years to hold a crowd of over 20,300 spectators. Averaging crowds of about 15,000 while in the 2. Bundesliga, the team's hard won recent success had them regularly filling their venue. The average home league attendance during the 2015\u201316 season was 30,324 spectators. ==Club culture== Mainz is known for being one of the three foremost carnival cities in Germany, the others being D\u00fcsseldorf and Cologne. After every Mainzer goal scored at a home match, the \"Narrhallamarsch\", a famous German carnival tune, is played. ==Reserve team== The club's reserve team, 1. FSV Mainz 05 II, has also, with the rise of the senior side to Bundesliga level, risen through the ranks. The team first reached Oberliga level in 1999, followed by promotion to the Regionalliga in 2003. After playing there for two seasons, the team dropped to the Oberliga once more. In 2008, it won promotion to the Regionalliga West again and when this league was reduced in size in 2012, it entered the new Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest. A third- place finish in this league in 2014 allowed the team to enter the promotion round to the 3. Liga, where it was successful against the Regionalliga Nordost champions and played at this level in 2014\u201315. ==European record== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Season ! Competition ! Round ! Club !
