    "text": "Vicious Pink was a synth-pop duo formed in Leeds, England in 1981. == History == With a catchy sound and a penchant for highly provocative and sexualized lyrics, the band's music was aimed toward clubs rather than commercial hits. Vicious Pink consisted of two members, English/French singer Josephine Warden and keyboardist Brian Moss. The duo began as backing vocalists for Soft Cell, then known as the Vicious Pink Phenomenon. Vicious Pink are remembered for four dance singles: \"8:15 to Nowhere\", \"Cccan't You See\", and \"Fetish\" produced by Tony Mansfield of New Musik fame. Their last single \"Take Me Now\" was produced by Gary Moberley . The band also backed Soft Cell at The Warehouse in Leeds. The American owner of The Warehouse, Mike Wiand, was their manager. Wiand was also a key factor in the success of the 1980s dance track \"Let the Music Play\" by Shannon, which was released in the UK on his Warehouse Records label. Vicious Pink played live at The Ritz in New York in December 1984. Vicious Pink were able to briefly attain a cult level of success without ever breaking into the mainstream. Although they had started releasing music in 1982, they failed to attract much attention until the release of the single \"Cccan't You See\" (UK No. 67) and its instrumental B-side \"8:15 to Nowhere\" in 1984. Over the next two years, both sides of this single accrued play in clubs on both sides of the Atlantic. In 1983, the duo recorded two unreleased demo, Blue and The Tape Gallery, and a self-titled album released in 1986, after they had ceased recording. This album was a collection of previously released singles. Warden later married a London-based music lawyer, and Moss continued his music career; he is now the keyboardist for the artist, Mirazma. ==Discography== ===Albums=== * Vicious Pink (1986) ===Singles=== * \"My Private Tokyo\" (1982) * \"Je T'aime\" (1983) (UK #84) * \"8:15 to Nowhere\" (1984) * \"Cccan't You See\" (1984) (UK #67) * \"Fetish\" / \"Spooky\" (1985) (UK #87) * \"Cccan't You See\" (Remix) (1985) (UK #95) * \"Take Me Now\" (1986) ==References== ==External links== * * Brian Moss's current project Category:English electronic music groups Category:English musical duos Category:English new wave musical groups Category:British synth-pop new wave groups Category:Electronic music duos Category:Male\u2013female musical duos Category:New wave duos Category:Musical groups from Leeds Category:Musical groups established in 1981 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1986 ",
