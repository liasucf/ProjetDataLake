    "text": "The 2018 Nevada State Senate elections took place as part of the biennial United States elections. Nevada voters elected state senators in 11 of the state senate's 21 districts. State senators serve four-year terms in the Nevada State Senate. A primary election on June 12, 2018 determined which candidates appear on the November 6 general election ballot. Primary election results can be obtained from the State of Nevada's Secretary of State website. Due to resignations and appointments, on election day 2018, there were 10 Democrats, 1 Independent (caucusing with Democrats), 8 Republicans, and 2 vacancies in the Nevada Senate. To claim control of the chamber from Democrats, the Republicans needed to net 3 Senate seats. == Background == Following the 2016 state senate elections, Democrats flipped control of the Senate away from the Republicans with a slim majority of 11 Democrats to 10 Republicans. On November 14, 2016, Sen. Patricia Farley switched from Republican to non-partisan and began caucusing with the Democrats, increasing their majority to 12 seats. Democrat Ruben Kihuen of District 10 resigned to become a member of the U.S. House, and he was replaced by Democrat Yvanna Cancela on December 6, 2016. Democrat Mark Manendo of District 21 resigned amid allegations of sexual harassment on July 19, 2017 and Republican Becky Harris of District 9 resigned in January 2018 to chair the Nevada Gaming Control Board. == Results == ===Summary of results by State Senate district=== *For districts not displayed, there is no election until 2020. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\" ! class=\"sortable\"| State Senate District ! class=\"unsortable\"|Incumbent ! colspan=\"2\"| Party ! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator ! colspan=\"2\"| Party |- | 2nd | Mo Denis | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic | Mo Denis | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic |- | 8th | Patricia Farley | style=\"background:;\"| | Independent | Marilyn Dondero Loop | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic |- | 9th | Vacant | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | Melanie Scheible | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic |- | 10th | Yvanna Cancela | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic | Yvanna Cancela | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic |- | 12th | Joe Hardy | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | Joe Hardy | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 13th | Julia Ratti | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic | Julia Ratti | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic |- | 14th | Don Gustavson | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | Ira Hansen | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 16th | Ben Kieckhefer | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | Ben Kieckhefer | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 17th | James Settelmeyer | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | James Settelmeyer | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 20th | Michael Roberson | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican | Keith Pickard | style=\"background:;\"| | Republican |- | 21st | Vacant | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic | James Ohrenschall | style=\"background:;\"| | Democratic |- |} Source: === Close races=== Seats where the margin of victory was under 10%: ===Detailed results by State Senate district=== {| id=toc class=toc summary=Contents | align=center | District 2 \u2022 District 8 \u2022 District 9 \u2022 District 10 \u2022 District 12 \u2022 District 13 \u2022 District 14 \u2022 District 16 \u2022 District 17 \u2022 District 20 \u2022 District 21__NOTOC__ |} *Results are only shown for races that were contested.
