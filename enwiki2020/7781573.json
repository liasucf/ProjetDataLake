The proverbial hardness of Noric steel is expressed by Ovid: \"...durior [...] ferro quod noricus excoquit ignis...\" which roughly translates to \"...harder than iron which Noric fire tempers [was Anaxarete towards the advances of Iphis]...\"\"...harder than iron tempered by Noric fire [was Anaxarete towards the advances of Iphis']...\", Metamorphoses, 14.712 and it was widely used for the weapons of the Roman military after Noricum joined the empire in 16 BC.\"Noricus ensis,\" Horace, Odes, i. 16.9 The iron ore was quarried at two mountains in modern Austria still called Erzberg \"ore mountain\" today, one at H\u00fcttenberg, Carinthia and the other at Eisenerz, Styria, separated by . The latter is the site of the modern Erzberg mine. Buchwald identifies a sword of found in Krenovica, Moravia as an early example of Noric steel due to a chemical composition consistent with Erzberg ore. A more recent sword, dating to and found in Zemplin, eastern Slovakia, is of extraordinary length for the period (95 cm, 37 in) and carries a stamped Latin inscription (?V?TILICI?O), identified as a \"fine sword of Noric steel\" by Buchwald. A center of manufacture was at Magdalensberg. ==See also== *Iron Age Europe *Iron Age sword *La T\u00e8ne culture *History of ferrous metallurgy *Damascus steel *Bulat steel *Wootz steel *Crucible steel ==References== Category:History of metallurgy Category:Industry in ancient Rome ",
