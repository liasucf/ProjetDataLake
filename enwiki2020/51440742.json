KHS is located in Kiamumbi Sub location, Kiambaa S/Area Location, Kiambaa Division, Kiambaa Constituency in Kiambu County. Over the years, the school has continued to registered good academic performance. The school was established in 1968 with the view to providing education to the local community. It was different from other schools in the following ways; one, while other schools were converted from intermediate schools, KHS was a secondary school from inception; two, it was free of religious affiliations and sponsorship; three, the school was designed for the open Plan system of education. The Open Plan System of education was borrowed from Canadian compliance with the Ominde Report of 1964. This system of education was to combine education and environment and was also emphasised on skills acquisition. KHS was founded as an institution catering for environmental studies in 1976 \u2014 it had no proper curriculum. The first headmaster, Mr. John Long, was an expert in the open Plan system of education. The curriculum lasted two years and was abandoned in 1978 due to lack of requisite staff which was caused by key teachers leaving barely a year after it had started, and with that, training collapsed. Thereafter, the school shifted to offer the national curriculum like other schools. The school is situated on a 35-acre piece of land bought in 1969 with financial support from the then Kiambu County Council. A board of Governors (BOG) was put in place with its first chairman as the late Njenga Karume who served until 1979. The first batch of students was admitted in 1971. Since the infrastructure was incomplete, the girls were sent to Kambui Girls School and the boys to Chania High School. The buildings were constructed between 1971 and 1974 and the school opened its doors to the first residents in 1976. It was started as a co-educational boarding school. However, due to the growing demand for boys\u2019 school In Kiambu, it was converted to a boys\u2019 school. Consequently, between 1990 and 1993 the girls were systematically phased out and relocated to the Mary Leakey Girls and Kijabe Girls Schools. It is a school which builds a wholesome kind of character. It has a strong and visioned staff. The school is a domain with men of substance, who are modeled to leave a positive mark in the society at large.
