    "text": "Pi Ceti, Latinized from \u03c0 Ceti, is the Bayer designation for a star system in the equatorial constellation of Cetus. It is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.238. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 8.30 mas, it is located around 393 light years from the Sun. This is a single- lined spectroscopic binary system with a nearly circular orbit and a period of 7.45 years. The fact that the system has a negligible eccentricity is surprising for such a long period, and may suggest that the secondary is a white dwarf that had its orbit circularized during a mass-transfer event. The primary, component A, is a normal B-type star that has been given stellar classifications of B7 V and B7 IV. It appears very young \u2013 less than half a million years in age \u2013 and may still be on a pre-main sequence track. The star shows no magnetic field but it does emit an infrared excess. ==Name== This star, along with \u03b5 Cet, \u03c1 Cet and \u03c3 Cet, was Al Sufi's Al Sadr al \u1e32ai\u1e6dos, the Whale's Breast According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars, Al Sadr al \u1e32ai\u1e6dos were the title for four stars :\u03c1 Cet as Al Sadr al \u1e32ai\u1e6dos I, \u03c3 Cet as Al Sadr al \u1e32ai\u1e6dos II, \u03b5 Cet as Al Sadr al \u1e32ai\u1e6dos III and \u03c0 Cet as Al Sadr al \u1e32ai\u1e6dos IVJack W.
