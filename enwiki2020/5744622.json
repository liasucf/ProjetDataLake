The intention was to ensure uniformity and legibility in the handwritten cards of library catalogs. Beginning in September 1885, Melvil Dewey and Thomas Edison developed and perfected the approved library hand to be taught in library school and used in libraries. The penmanship was based on Edison's own handwriting in which he stated that \"I had perfected a style of handwriting which would allow me to take legibly from the wire, long hand, forty-seven and even fifty-four words a minute\". The 1903 Handbook of the New York State Library School listed the requirements of library hand. They included legibility, speed, and uniformity. The particular type of ink, inkstands, pens, penholders, and erasers was specified. The standards for lettering were dictated in regard to size, slant, spacing, special letters and figures, and even the proper posture and position of the writer was outlined.History of the card catalog , Library and Information Science Wiki The teaching of library hand declined after the widespread introduction of the typewriter in the early 20th century. ==References== ==External links== * Examples of library hand * Remembrance of Catalog Cards Past * Jayne Ringrose, The Library Hand, Cambridge University Library Special Collections blog, 13 June 2013 * Library handwriting: a guide for the use of students in the New York State Library School (The University of the State of New York, 1916) digitised by Connecticut State Library * Dana Library Hand \u2014 scalable font family based on John Cotton Dana's Disjoined Hand sample, by Margo Burns Category:Library science Category:Penmanship Category:Western calligraphy ",
