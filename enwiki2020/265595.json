    "text": "This is a list of IATA-indexed railway stations, which are assigned codes by the IATA, similar to IATA airport codes. Such railway stations are typically used in air-rail alliances or code sharing agreements (commonly known as \"Rail Fly\") between airlines and rail lines, particularly in Europe. By assigning railway stations an IATA code, passengers on trips involving those stations can be ticketed all the way. Sometimes they can get checked straight through to their final destination, without the bother of having to claim their baggage and check-in again when changing between the rail and air portions of a trip. At other places passengers have to carry their baggage on the train, but anyway need no separate train booking process. == Airports == Rail lines at airports include: ;Austria * Vienna International Airport ;Belgium * Brussels Airport using Belgian Railways ;Denmark * Copenhagen Airport, air tickets usable for Swedish State Railways (not Danish State Railways). ;France * Charles de Gaulle Airport near Roissy, France, with SNCF French Rail and Eurostar. * Gare de Lyon Saint-Exup\u00e9ry, the first airport to be served by a high-speed line. ;Germany * Frankfurt International Airport * Cologne Bonn Airport * D\u00fcsseldorf Airport * Leipzig/Halle Airport (AIRail Service with Deutsche Bahn). ;Netherlands * Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam, Netherlands. Air France-KLM offers tickets including flights to and from Amsterdam or Paris with corresponding trains and/or buses to Belgium. ;Norway * Oslo Airport, Gardermoen (Flytoget) * Trondheim Airport, V\u00e6rnes (Vy) ;Sweden * Stockholm- Arlanda Airport, air tickets usable for Swedish State Railways. ;Switzerland * Geneva Cointrin International Airport railway station (Swiss Federal Railways) * Zurich International Airport railway station (Swiss Federal Railways) ;Turkey * \u0130zmir Adnan Menderes Airport Rail Station (\u0130ZBAN) ;United Kingdom * Birmingham International railway station * London **Gatwick Airport railway station has connections to London and other points on the National Rail Network **Heathrow Airport stations (Heathrow Express and London Underground Piccadilly line) **Stansted Airport (Stansted Express) **London City Airport (Docklands Light Railway) * Manchester Airport railway station * Glasgow Prestwick Airport railway station ;United States * Note that the list of Amtrak station codes is not the same as the IATA station codes. * Newark Liberty International Airport in Newark, New Jersey, United States (near New York, New York), with Amtrak. * Baltimore/Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, with Amtrak. ==Railway station codes== The IATA codes for railway stations normally begin with Q, X or Z, except when the station shares the code with an airport. For some smaller cities the railway station in the city has the same code as the airport outside the city (several kilometers distance). A connection involving transfer between them can appear when searching travel possibilities. A taxi ride, a train, or a bus transfer is usually needed then. ;A * ADB: Adnan Menderes Airport Rail Station, \u0130zmir, Turkey * AMS: Schiphol Airport railway station on the Weesp\u2013Leiden railway line near Amsterdam, Netherlands; high-speed trains (Thalys and Intercity Direct) to Rotterdam, Brussels and Paris using HSL-Zuid stop at the station as well * ARN: Stockholm-Arlanda Airport railway station, Sweden (located between terminals 4 and 5) ;B * BHX: Birmingham International railway station, United Kingdom ( by rail from the airport) * BNJ: Bonn Hauptbahnhof, Sankt Augustin, Germany (at Bonn-Hangelar Airport ) * BOO: Bod\u00f8 Station, Norway (5 km from airport) * BRS: Bristol, United Kingdom ( from airport) * BRU: Brussels National Airport railway station, Belgium ;C * CBG: Cambridge railway station, United Kingdom * CDG: A\u00e9roport Charles de Gaulle 2 \u2013 TGV, Roissy, Paris, France (LGV Interconnexion Est (high-speed line) with TGV/Thalys services) * CGN: Bahnhof K\u00f6ln/Bonn Flughafen, Germany (walking distance from the airport).
