Retrieved 19 Jun 2019 After the Deutsche Reichsbahn had been founded in 1920, in 1921 all goods wagons types with the same or similar roles were grouped into so-called class districts. These were named after cities that were the headquarters of a Reichsbahn division or, later, other cities too. Work on re-lettering and renaming the wagons began in 1922 and was largely completed by 1924. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Class districts of the Deutsche Reichsbahn from 1921 |- !style=\"background:#66CDAA\" | Class districts !style=\"background:#66CDAA\" | Category letters !style=\"background:#66CDAA\" | Wagon type !style=\"background:#66CDAA\" | Class !style=\"background:#66CDAA\" | Period |- | Altona, later Hamburg | V | Livestock van | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131937 |- | Augsburg | S | Two and three-axled rail wagons | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | Berlin | Gk | Refrigerator vans | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | Breslau | Om | Open wagons | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | Dresden | G und GG | Large-volume vans | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | Elberfeld, later Wuppertal | K | Lidded wagons | S, V, A | 1922\u20131930 |- | Erfurt | X | Open departmental wagons | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | Essen | Om | Open wagons | V, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | Kassel (Cassel) | G | Covered wagons | V, A | 1922\u20131945 |- | K\u00f6ln | SS | Rail wagons with four or more axles (flat wagons) | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |- | M\u00fcnchen | G | Covered wagons | Verbandsbauart | 1922\u20131945 |- | N\u00fcrnberg | O | Open wagons | Verbandsbauart | 1922\u20131945 |- | Regensburg | H | Cradle wagons | S, V, A | 1922\u20131945 |- | Stuttgart | R | Stake wagons | S, V, A, W | 1922\u20131945 |} Legende: *S = State railways *V = Verbandsbauart *A = Austauschbauart *W = Welded == See also == * Additional class districts from 1926 * Additional class districts from 1935 * Additional class districts from 1942 == References == Category:Rail freight transport Category:Rail technologies Category:Rail transport in Germany ",
