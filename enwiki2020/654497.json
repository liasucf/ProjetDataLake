    "text": "Utuado () is a municipality of Puerto Rico located in the central mountainous region of the island known as La Cordillera Central. It is located north of Adjuntas and Ponce; south of Hatillo and Arecibo; east of Lares; and west of Ciales and Jayuya. In land area it is the third-largest municipality in Puerto Rico (after Arecibo and Ponce). According to the 2000 US Census, the city has a population of 35,336 spread over 24 barrios and Utuado barrio-pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). The name Utuado derives from the Ta\u00edno word Otoao, meaning \"between mountains\". The municipality is known as La Ciudad del Viv\u00ed meaning \"The City of the Viv\u00ed\", derived from the Viv\u00ed River which runs through Utuado: one river branch comes from Adjuntas and the other from Jayuya. These two rivers then meet near the Fernando L. Ribas Dominicci Avenue and continue the journey to Lago Dos Bocas. Utuado is the main city of the Utuado micropolitan statistical area and is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Fajardo Combined Statistical Area. ==History== Utuado was founded October 12, 1739, by Sebastian de Morfi, on behalf of 60 families from Arecibo. It was the first town established in the interior, mountainous region of the island known as La Cordillera Central and the 11th oldest established municipality in Puerto Rico, following San Juan, San Germ\u00e1n, Coamo, Arecibo, Aguada, Loiza, Ponce, A\u00f1asco, Guayama and Manat\u00ed. ===Columbus's arrival=== At the time of the Spanish initial occupation of the island on November 19, 1493, by Christopher Columbus, Puerto Rico was inhabited by the Ta\u00edno Indians. The Ta\u00ednos were a culturally developed society with a universal language, a developed agricultural system, and a social organization based on caciques or chieftains. The Utuado area was ruled over by cacique Guarionex. In Caguana barrio, the Ta\u00ednos built a series of courts or bateyes, Caguana Ceremonial Ball Courts Site, that is considered the best example of Taino engineering in the West Indies. ===Early history: XVI\u2013XVIII=== In his work , Jalil Sued Badillo gives a detailed account of the economic state of Puerto Rico during the first decades after the discovery and mentions the importance of the Otoao region. From 1510 through 1513, the island witnessed a Ta\u00edno rebellion as a result of harsh and inhumane treatment by the Spanish settlers. During the process of pacification many Spaniards settled in the area now occupied by the municipality of Utuado and set up farms (haciendas), initially on behalf of the Spanish government (Hacienda Real Dos), to provide food to the Indian slaves working the gold mines and the Spanish colonists in the area. One of the first settlers in the Otoao region in 1512 was Antonio Sede\u00f1o, the island's bookkeeper. His farm's main crop was yuca. His farm was sold in 1519 to Blas de Villasante, the island's treasurer, for 525 gold pesos. Areas in the Utuado region that were exploited for gold include Salto Arriba barrio, initially, then later in the 1530s Caguana barrio and Don Alonso barrio. In the 1530s, landowners in the Don Alonso area petitioned the Spanish Crown allow for the establishment of a town in the area but it was never granted. Once the gold mining era ends toward the end of the 16th century, very little is known about the Utuado region until the early 18th century. According to the Puerto Rican historian Fernando Pic\u00f3, the few documents that exist indicate the area was mostly unpopulated and densely forested. On the other hand, he states that Utuado is the municipality with the most caves, that most likely served as dwellings for Indians or runaway slaves. \"Utuado Street Scene\" from Harper's Weekly May 13, 1899 The agreement to establish the town of Utuado by the 60 families of Arecibo states they purchased the Hato de Otoao for 569 pesos and 5 reales from owners Manuel Natal and Felipa Rom\u00e1n. It also states their desire to choose where on the land the town center would be located, which indicates the area was not populated yet. During his visit to the island in 1771, Fray I\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra states the principal economic activity in the Utuado region was cattle raising, horses and mules. He mentions a small amount of agricultural activity existed but the population only produced enough tobacco and coffee for their own consumption. During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, Utuado's population continued to grow as coffee gained in importance and growers saw the need for high altitudes and mountainous terrain to produce the best coffee beans. People not only migrated from the Puerto Rican coastal towns but also from Ireland (Founder Sebastian de Morfi = Sebastian Murphy), Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands of Majorca and Menorca, all seeking the riches that coffee had to offer. Utuado was the first municipality to elect officials after Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States. ===Golden era of coffee \u2013 \"black gold\"=== Utuado in 1896 during the coffee golden era During the late 19th century Utuado experienced an explosive economic growth centered around the cultivation of coffee, also known at the time as oro negro or \"black gold\". By the 1890s Utuado was the largest producer of coffee in Puerto Rico and the second municipality (after Ponce) with the largest population. It produced a rich social life for many of its citizens and a casino and theatre were established in the town. The progress of the town was so evident that the regent Queen of Spain, Mar\u00eda Cristina, honored the town with the title of Ciudad (City) on August 20, 1894.Archivo General de Indias, Reference Code: Ultramar 5147, EXP. 13, Document accessed and viewed at Archivos Espa\u00f1oles en red: www.http://aer.mcu.es/sgae/ In 1896 or 1897 Utuado was the first city in Puerto Rico with a public electric lighting system powered by a hydraulic turbine power plant,Book: Utuado: Notas Para su Historia, Dr. Pedro H. Hernandez Paralitici, San Juan, 1983, Page 43 and in that same year mayor Juan Casellas planned a train system to unite Utuado with Arecibo. By 1899 this golden era ended due to two events: the United States occupation of the island in 1898, which made sugar the new crop of importance instead of coffee (Utuado's mountainous landscape was not ideal for growing sugarcane, making it impossible for it to compete in the sugar industry), and Hurricane San Ciriaco in 1899, which destroyed the coffee haciendas. ===Massacre=== El Imparcial headline: \"Aviation (US) bombs Utuado\" One of the most tragic moments in Utuado's history occurred on October 30, 1950, during the Utuado Uprising against United States rule, which culminated in what is known as the \"Utuado Massacre\". In Utuado a group of 32 nationalists, led by nationalist leaders Heriberto Castro and Dami\u00e1n Torres, fought against the local police during the independence revolts which occurred in various cities and towns of the island. The group was reduced to 12 men and retreated to the house of Dami\u00e1n Torres. Torres' residence was attacked by 50-caliber machine- gun fire from ten American P-47 Thunderbolt planes.Maria Rosado; Pedro Albizu Campos: Las Llamas de la Aurora; pp. 352, 353; Ediciones Puerto pub.; The National Guard arrived later that day and ordered the nine men who survived the attack to surrender. Once the nationalists surrendered they were forced to march down Dr. Cueto Street to the local town plaza where their shoes, belts and personal belongings were removed. The group was then taken behind the police station where they were machine gunned. Four of the nationalists died in the act, they were nationalist leader Heriberto Castro, Julio Col\u00f3n Feliciano, Agust\u00edn Qui\u00f1ones Mercado, Antonio Ramos and Antonio Gonz\u00e1lez. Gonz\u00e1lez, who was 17 years old, pleaded for water and instead was bayoneted to death. ===Hurricane Maria=== Hurricane Maria on September 20, 2017 triggered numerous landslides in Utuado. In many areas of Utuado there were more than 25 landslides per square mile due to the significant amount of rainfall. 171017-F-FH950-0631 (37544301410).jpg|Relief efforts in Utuado 171017-F-FH950-0495 (37544302270).jpg|Residents cross a river after the bridge is washed out 171018-A-PT541-008 (37802495951).jpg|Relief efforts in Utuado on Oct. 18, 2017 171017-F-FH950-0935 (37544297560).jpg|Relief efforts in Utuado on Oct. 12, 2017 171017-F-FH950-0126 (37544307650).jpg|Human chain to move supplies from the helicopter to the residents File:171017-F-FH950-0101 (37544308230).jpg|Resident was able to speak to her son three weeks later ==Geography== Utuado is in the central mountainous region. ===Barrios=== Like all municipalities of Puerto Rico, Utuado is subdivided into barrios.

The Iglesia San Miguel Arcangel, the local Catholic parish, was founded in 1746. The current double-steepled church was built between 1872 and 1878 and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places, along with the Caguana Ceremonial Park and the Blanco Bridge or Puente Blanco located in Arenas barrio joining Utuado with Adjuntas.

It is also home to the federally endangered Puerto Rican broad-winged hawk (Buteo platypterus brunnescens) as well as a captive population of the critically endangered Puerto Rican parrot (Amazona vittata). Captive parrots are slowly being released into R\u00edo Abajo in an attempt to form a second population of parrots on the island. East of the Rio Abajo Forest Reserve is the Dos Bocas Lake and dam, one of several man-made lakes in Utuado. From El Embarcadero, near routes 123 and 146, boats take guests around the water to one of the many restaurants for lakeside dining.

Centered in the flag is the sun of Otoao, a Ta\u00edno representation of the sun. ===Coat of arms=== The main figure of the shield is a Cem\u00ed pierced by a sword. The color of the cem\u00ed alludes to the color of the earth, while the silver sword with a hilt in gold recalls San Miguel Arc\u00e1ngel, the town's patron. On the other hand, the Ta\u00edno mythological figure that appears on the upper left side symbolizes the \"Caguana woman\" symbol of fertility for the Ta\u00ednos. The mine, the peak and the gold shovel crossed by the lamp of the copper miners establish the mineral wealth of this area. Finally, the blue background of the shield remembers its skies, while the lower white stripe alludes to the Viv\u00ed river that crosses the town. ===Anthem=== The anthem of Utuado was composed and written by Am\u00edlcar Rivera D\u00edaz. ==Education== There are currently 20 schools under the Puerto Rico Department of Education system, 2 private schools and one college level institution; the vast majority of children in Utuado attend public schools.
