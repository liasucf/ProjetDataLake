His official roles meant that his correspondence was unexamined by censors, enabling him to circulate letters between leading thinkers of the day,Davidson, Ian: Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 pp.328-9 most particularly during the Sirven affair. ==The Encyclop\u00e9die== Damilaville authored three articles in the Encyclop\u00e9die - Population, Peace and The Vingti\u00e8me. == Vingtieme == Damilaville is believed to have coauthored an article in the Encyclop\u00e9die on the Vingtieme tax regime with Diderot, his trusted associate. His treatise is largely a discussion on the nature of government, of civil society and of the economy. Like Montesquie, Damilaville makes a clear distinction between the state, as an aggregate of people in society, and government. The treatise uses this dichotomy between the state and government to rationalize the necessity of taxes; however, Damilaville also argues tax simplification or reform. What is important in his contention for tax simplification is the purpose of having or raising taxes on participants in society. According to Damilaville, tax burdens should not be understood through the vice of ratios of an individuals' income, rather in through the ratio of taxes that concern an individual's sustenance after their monies have been deducted. ==Friendship with Voltaire== Voltaire regarded him as a very close friend, and wrote him at least 539 letters over eight years.Davidson, Ian, Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 p.305 They only actually met, for the first time, after they had been corresponding for five years, on 20 August 1765, when Damilaville visited Ferney.Davidson, Ian, Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 p.344 Opinion of Damilaville was not universally positive: Melchior Grimm said of him:Davidson, Ian, Voltaire-A Life, Profile Books, 2010 p.304 == References == == Bibliography == * Emmanuel Boussuge et Fran\u00e7oise Launay, \u00ab L'ami D'Amilaville \u00bb, ', 2014, n\u00b0 49, (p. 25\u201341). * Emmanuel Boussuge et Fran\u00e7oise Launay, \"\u00c9tienne No\u00ebl D'Amilaville (1723\u20131768)\", Les collaborateurs de l'Encyclop\u00e9die, projet d'Edition Num\u00e9rique Collaborative et Critique de l'Encyclop\u00e9die' (6 January 2015) == External links == * * Damilaville on Wikisource * G\u00e9n\u00e9alogie des Damilaville. * Autre publication: article \"Paix\" de l'Encyclop\u00e9die.
