    "text": "The Eugene Towbin House is a historic house at 16 Broadview Drive in Little Rock, Arkansas. It was built in 1960 to a design by Hollis Beck, and is a good local example of Mid-Century Modern architecture. It is a single-story frame structure, its walls finished in vertical board siding and resting on a concrete block foundation. It is covered by a low-pitch side-facing gabled roof with deep eaves. The roof extends to the right beyond the main block to also shelter a carport. Eugene Towbin, for whose family the house was built, was a prominent physician in Little Rock. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2019. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Little Rock, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1960 Category:Houses in Little Rock, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Little Rock, Arkansas Category:1960 establishments in Arkansas ",
