The school started in 2011. On 12 July 2013, the school had its official opening ceremony. In 2015, the first batch of Secondary 4 Express students had 93.3% scoring 5 or more passes for O-Levels, which outdid the national average of 83.3%. The school took part in SG50 as well by setting a new record in the Singapore Book of Records. In collaboration with the Singapore Taekwondo Federation (STF), 1,400 Taekwondo students from Edgefield Secondary School gathered to create a human formation of the SG50 logo to mark Singapore's Golden Jubilee. Students broke 2,800 planks in a team formation, setting the new record for the \u201cMost Number of Planks Broken in Kicking Sequence\u201d in the largest local Taekwondo demonstration. On 21 October 2016, the then-vice-principal, Lee Peck Ping, became principal after his predecessor was transferred to Regent Secondary School. == Principals == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Principal !Years served |- |Leong Kok Kee |2011-2016 |- |Lee Peck Ping |2017-Present |} ==Programmes== The school is the second school in Singapore to have Taekwondo as a compulsory curricular activity. It is said that the sport helps to instil discipline, respect and perseverance in every student. It also serves its purpose in training self-defence. By the end of Secondary 4, most students are able to achieve black belts. The CCA took part in several competitions every year and did extremely well, exceeding the expectations of the school. In 2018, the Taekwondo programme was split into two tiers - the lower and upper tier, making it optional for the upper secondary students. Hence, they are given the choice to opt out of the programme if they wish to. For lower secondary students, the school has Analytical Thinking Skills (ATS) lessons to help train their minds for problem-solving and tackling challenges. They also have Apple Education to learn how to use macOS, after which they have Challenge-Based Learning (CBL) projects to do for both years, promoting the spirit of teamwork. Students were given themes and big ideas to work on, so as to solve relevant problems and think of a better solution. ==References== Category:Punggol Category:Educational institutions established in 2011 Category:2011 establishments in Singapore Category:Secondary schools in Singapore ",
