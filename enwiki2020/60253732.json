    "text": "Masidwola (, meaning \"of the Mehsuds\"), Mehsudi, or Maseedwola is a dialect of Waziristani. ==Background== Waziristani is an east-central Pashto dialect spoken in South Waziristan, Southeastern parts of North Waziristan, parts of Bannu and Tank in Pakistan, and in certain adjacent districts of Paktika, Khost and Paktia provinces of Afghanistan. The Masidwola dialect is almost identical to the dialect spoken around Urgun (eastern Paktika province) Wazirwola dialect and the Bannuchi dialect of Bannu, somewhat resembles the dialect spoken by Khattaks in Karak and has distant resemblance with Afridi dialect . The dialects of Loya Paktia like Zadrani are also very closely related, except that they are of the harsh northern variety. ==Phonology== Masidwola differs significantly in pronunciation and grammar from the standard literary Pashto based on the larger Kandahar, Kabul and Yousafzai dialects. The vowels [a], [\u0251], [u] and [o] of standard Pashto yield [\u0251], [o], [i] and [e] respectively, so [pa\u0282to] becomes [p\u0251\u0255te] in Masidwola. A special feature of Waziristani is that the phonemes [\u0283] and [\u0282], along with their voiced counterparts, [\u0292] and [\u0290], have merged into the phonemes [\u0255] and [\u0291], both of which also exist in the nearby Ormuri or Warmuri language of Burkis of Kaniguram, South Waziristan.Rozi Khan Burki. \"Dying Languages; Special Focus on Ormuri\". Originally published in Pakistan Journal of Public Administration; Volume 6. No. 2 in December 2001. Khyber.ORG. The Pashto alphabet has no symbol for their expression and the regular symbols of \u0698 and \u0634 may be used. ==Lexicon== The standard Pashto word for \"boy\", \"\u0647\u0644\u06a9\" [hal\u0259k], is rarely heard in Masidwola. Instead, \"\u0648\u0693\u06a9\u0627\u06cc\" [wu\u027bkai] meaning \"little one\" is used. The word \"l\u0259shki\" [l\u0259\u0255ki] is used instead of the standard \"\u0644\u0696\" [l\u0259\u0290], \"a little bit\". The pronoun \u0645\u06cc\u0696 ([mu\u0290] or [mung]), meaning \"we\", is pronounced [mi\u0291h] in Masidwola. ==Orthography== Masidwola, like many other obscure Pashto dialects, is almost never written, and its speakers may use standard Pashto as a literary language. Masidwola Pashto is spoken by various tribes, by the Burki and Dawarwola by the Dawari. There are slight differences in pronunciation, for example, the phonemes [t\u0361s] and [d\u0361z] can become [s] and [z], or even [t\u0361\u0283] and [d\u0361\u0292], depending on the tribe or area the speaker is from. ==See also== *Waneci ==Notes== *Linguist List *Lorimer, John Gordon (1902).
