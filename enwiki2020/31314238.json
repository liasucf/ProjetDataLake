Now coached by four-time Olympic medallist Julie Chu, former coach Les Lawton accumulated more than 500 victories as Stingers head coach before stepping down due to health issues. ==History== The Concordia Stingers women's ice hockey team earned varsity status in 1975, ensuring that they received financial support from the university.On the Edge: Women Making Hockey History, p.134, by Elizabeth Etue and Megan K. Williams, Second Story Press, Toronto, Ontario, 1996, After playing for the Providence Friars women's ice hockey program and without any NCAA eligibility remaining, Cammi Granato moved to Montreal to earn her master's degree in sports administration at Concordia University. In 123 games, Granato scored 178 goals and 148 assists for 326 points, and was instrumental in Concordia capturing three consecutive provincial championships. In 1997-98, the CIS recognized women's hockey. The Stingers were granted their first National Championship, which was held at Concordia. In the 2000 semi-finals, the Stingers were bested by the University of Alberta by a 4-3 tally. That year, the Stingers took third place. In the 2000-01 season, Stingers player Lisa-Marie Breton led the Quebec Student Sports Federation with eight goals and six assists in just six games.http://ctr.concordia.ca/2000-01/Apr_12/11-Athletic_Awards/index.shtml ==National championships== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
