    "text": "Derry Celtic Football Club was a football club from Derry, Ireland. The club, formed as St Columb's Hall in 1890, changing to St Columb's Hall Celtic in 1893, and Derry Celtic in 1899, was once the primary team in the city, but was voted out of the Irish League in 1913 and is now defunct.Derry Journal, 8 September 1890; Belfast News-Letter, 23 September 1893 As St Columb's Hall Celtic, the club reached the Irish Cup final in the 1897-98 season, losing 0-2 to Linfield. The club competed in the Irish League for the first time in 1900-01, finishing its first season without a single win. Things began to improve in the next few seasons for Derry Celtic: the club picked up its first win in the 1901-02 season and achieved 6th place. They followed this up by finishing 5th in the 1902-03 season, however, this would prove to be Celtic's most successful season, only ever climbing to 5th once again in the 1909-10 season. In 1913, the club resigned from the Irish League defected to the Gaelic Athletic Association and never again played senior football.Cormac Moore (2015), The Irish Soccer Split. Atrium., p. 44 Derry City took over from the club as the city's main side after their formation in 1928 and their subsequent acceptance into the Irish League in 1929. The club played at Celtic Park (now the Derry GAA stadium) from 1894 to 1900, and at the Brandywell (now Derry City's stadium) from 1900. ==Honours== ===Senior honours=== *County Londonderry Cup/North West Senior Cup: 8 **1894/95, 1895/96, 1896/97, 1897/98, 1898/99, 1900/01, 1901/02, 1902/03 ==References== Category:Association football clubs in Derry Urban Area Category:Defunct association football clubs in Northern Ireland Category:Association football clubs established in 1900 Category:Defunct Irish Football League clubs Category:Association football clubs in County Londonderry Category:Former senior Irish Football League clubs Category:Association football clubs established in 1890 Category:Association football clubs disestablished in 1913 ",
