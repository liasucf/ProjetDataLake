Bucharest: Editura \u0218tiin\u021bific\u0103 \u0219i Enciclopedic\u0103, 1978 Together with Ghica-Bude\u0219ti and Nicolae Iorga, he sought to identify the influences that shaped Romanian architecture both in Moldavia and in Wallachia. His research took him to Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Turkey and the Russian Empire. Bal\u0219 pointed to Armenian and Georgian as well as Serbian contributions, and his work on 15th and 16th-century Moldavian architecture was favorably received. He sat on numerous company boards, including those of a mine and of a credit bank for encouraging industrial firms. The Bal\u0219 family had extensive rural properties in Moldavia, but his parents gradually had to sell their lands in order to pay off debts and losses by their administrators. In 1880, his father sold the imposing residence in Ia\u0219i that today houses the Music Conservatory. In 1897, Bal\u0219 married Maria \u0218tirbey, the daughter of prince Alexandru B. \u0218tirbei and the sister of Barbu \u0218tirbey. The marriage contract specifies that the bride received a trousseau of 25,000 lei, and that she wished to invest 200,000 lei of her parents' inheritance for building and furnishing a house. The couple had four children: Zoe (1897-1991), Alexandru (1898-1950s), Ion (1901-1980) and Matei (1905\u20131976). A high school in Adjud was named after Bal\u0219 in 2006.
