    "text": "Plantago major, the broadleaf plantain, white man's foot, or greater plantain, is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. The plant is native to most of Europe and northern and central Asia,Natural History Museum: Plantago majorFlora Europaea: Plantago majorFlora of Pakistan: Plantago major but has widely naturalised elsewhere in the world.As a result, Plantago major has many common names. In addition to \"broadleaf plantain\" and \"greater plantain\", other common names include: common plantain, broad-leaved plantain, cart track plant, dooryard plantain, greater plantago, healing blade, hen plant, lambs foot, roadweed, roundleaf plantain, snakeroot, waybread, wayside plantain, and white man's foot prints. -- Joint Nature Conservation Committee: Greater Plantain Plantago major LinnaeusBotanical Society of Britain and Ireland Database The young, tender leaves can be eaten raw, and the older, stringier leaves can be boiled in stews and eaten. Broadleaf plantain is not related to the fruit also known as plantain, which is a kind of banana. ==Description== Plantago major is an herbaceous perennial plant with a rosette of leaves in diameter.Blamey, M. & Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). Flora of Britain and Northern Europe. Each leaf is oval-shaped, long and broad, rarely up to long and broad, with an acute apex, a smooth margin, and a distinct petiole almost as long as the leaf itself. There are five to nine conspicuous veins over the length of the leaf.Parnell, J. and Curtis, T. 2012. Webb's An Irish Flora. Cork University Press. The flowers are small, greenish-brown with purple stamens, produced in a dense spike long on top of a stem tall and rarely to tall. Plantain is wind-pollinated, and propagates primarily by seeds, which are held on the long, narrow spikes which rise well above the foliage. Each plant can produce up to 20,000 seeds, which are very small and oval-shaped, with a bitter taste. There are three subspecies: *Plantago major subsp. major. *Plantago major subsp. intermedia (DC.) Arcang. *Plantago major subsp. winteri (Wirtg.) W.Ludw.

It does particularly well in compacted or disturbed soils. It is believed to be one of the first plants to reach North America after European colonisation. Reportedly brought to the Americas by Puritan colonizers, plantain was known among some Native American peoples by the common name \"white man's footprint\", because it thrived in the disturbed and damaged ecosystems surrounding European settlements. The ability of plantain to survive frequent trampling and colonize compacted soils makes it important for soil rehabilitation. Its roots break up hardpan surfaces, while simultaneously holding together the soil to prevent erosion. The seeds of plantain are a common contaminant in cereal grain and other crop seeds. As a result, it now has a worldwide distribution. ==Uses== The mature plant contains pliable and tough fibres that can be used in survival situations to make small cords, fishing line, sutures, or braiding. Some cultivars are planted as ornamentals in gardens, including 'Rubrifolia' with purple leaves, and 'Variegata' with variegated leaves.Huxley, A., ed. (1992). New RHS Dictionary of Gardening. ===Edibility=== The leaves are edible as a salad green when young and tender, but they quickly become tough and fibrous as they get older. The older leaves can be cooked in stews. The leaves contain calcium and other minerals, and 100 grams of plantain contain approximately the same amount of beta-carotene as a large carrot. The seeds are so small that they are tedious to gather, but they can be ground into a flour substitute or extender. ===Herbal medicine=== Plantain contains the phytochemicals allantoin, aucubin, ursolic acid, flavonoids, and asperuloside. Plantain extract has been studied for its potential health effects. Plantain leaves were used commonly in folk medicine for skin poultices on wounds, sores, or insect stings. The root was used for fever and respiratory infections. ==References== major Category:Flora of Europe Category:Demulcents Category:Medicinal plants Category:Plants described in 1753 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus Category:Leaf vegetables ",
