Isopropyl myristate is being studied as a skin enhancer. It is also used as a pesticide against head lice which works by dissolving the wax that covers the exoskeleton of head lice, killing them by dehydration.Anti-Lice Treatments It is used in the same way in flea and tick killing products for pets. It is used to remove bacteria from the oral cavity as the non-aqueous component of the two-phase mouthwash product \"Dentyl pH\". Isopropyl myristate is also used as a solvent in perfume materials, and in the removal process of prosthetic make- up. Hydrolysis of the ester from isopropyl myristate can liberate the acid and the alcohol. The acid could be responsible for decreasing of the pH value of formulations.Wen, Z.; Fang, L. and He, Z.
