Rudi\u0161 became known after publishing his first novel Nebe pod Berl\u00ednem (\"The Sky under Berlin\") in 2002, the tale of a Czech teacher who chooses to leave his job and to start a new life in Berlin, where he plays music in the underground, which \u2013 along with the ghosts of suicide jumpers \u2013 gains almost mystical importance to him, and joins an indie rock group (which is a semi-autobiographical motive). It was one of the most successful Czech books of recent years. For this novel he received Ji\u0159\u00ed Orten Award. His collaboration with draughtsman Jarom\u00edr 99 led to the publication of three closely connected graphic novels taking place among railway employees, B\u00edl\u00fd potok (\"White Brook\", 2003), Hlavn\u00ed n\u00e1dra\u017e\u00ed (\"Central Station\", 2004) and Zlat\u00e9 hory (\"Golden Hills\"). The trilogy has been adapted into an animated feature film, Alois Nebel, which was released in 2011. == See also == * List of Czech writers == References == == External links == *Profil autora: Jaroslav Rudi\u0161 (liter\u00e1rn\u00ed.cz) *Jaroslav Rudi\u0161 (iliteratura.cz) Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Czech male writers ",
