    "text": "The gens Peducaea, occasionally written Paeducaea or Peducea, was a plebeian family at ancient Rome. Members of this gens occur in history from the end of the second century BC, and from then to the time of Antoninus Pius, they steadily increased in prominence. The first of the Peducaii to obtain the consulship was Titus Peducaeus in 35 BC.Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, vol. III, p. 165 (\"Peducaeus\").Broughton, vol. II, p. 406. ==Origin== The gentile-forming suffix occurs in a number of Latin names, many of which seem to be of Oscan or Umbrian origin, and cognate to the more regular endings -eius and -aius, both of which were sometimes reduced to -ius in Latin. The ending seems to be derived from nominative forms ending in -aes, which was typical of the Umbri, as well as the Paeligni, an Oscan-speaking people.Chase, p. 120. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Peducaei were Sextus, Titus, and Lucius, all of which were common throughout Roman history. There are also several instances of the common praenomina Gaius and Quintus. Other names occur infrequently. ==Members== * Sextus Peducaeus, tribune of the plebs in 113 BC, reopened an investigation into a charge of incestum (unchastity) made against three of the Vestal Virgins, who had been acquitted by the College of Pontiffs. He had Lucius Cassius Longinus appointed to head the inquiry, which led to the execution of two of the accused.Cicero, De Natura Deorum, iii. 30.Asconius Pedianus, In Ciceronis Pro Milone, p. 76 (ed.

Cicero served as his quaestor, and speaks highly of his integrity, which he contrasts with the corruption and rapacity of his successor, Verres, who had cultivated Peducaeus' friendship.Cicero, In Verrem, i. 7., ii. 56, iii. 93, iv. 64, De Finibus, ii. 18, Epistulae ad Atticum, x. 1, 4, 5.Broughton, vol.

II, pp. 277, 385. * Gaius Peducaeus Sex. f., afterward Gaius Curtius Peducaeanus, probably the younger son of the propraetor to whom Cicero was quaestor, was adopted by Gaius Curtius.
