    "text": "\"The Roses of Success\" is a song and musical number from the popular 1968 motion picture Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. In the film, it is sung when Grandpa Potts (played by Lionel Jeffries) is caught in the Vulgarian inventors' workshop and is forced to modify a car that floats or face the consequences. The other imprisoned inventors sing this song in the hopes that they might cheer up the despondent Grandpa. He is cheered up and sings along, but in the end the car collapses. The song is also featured prominently in the 2002 and 2005 stage musical versions of the film. In American TV broadcasts of the 1968 motion picture, this song is often cut to fit into a two-hour time slot. The other song that is sometimes alternatively cut is \"Lovely Lonely Man\". It was made by the Sherman Brothers ==\"Rose\" lyrics in Sherman Brothers songs== *The Sherman Brothers often write songs with the word \"Rose\" included in the title. This may be due to \"Rose\" having been their mother's name.
