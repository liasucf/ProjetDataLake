She was built by the Thames Iron Works in London, launched in 1876, and completed in 1878. She served as the flagship of the Portuguese fleet for the majority of her long and peaceful career. She was rebuilt and heavily modernized between 1901 and 1903. Long-since obsolete by the 1930s, Vasco da Gama was finally sold for scrapping in 1935. ==Design== Vasco da Gama was long between perpendiculars, and she had a beam of , though at the main battery guns, the ship was wide. She had a maximum draft of . She displaced as originally built. She was fitted with a barquentine rig and a steam engine rated at , which produced a top speed of .

She was also equipped with a single gun mounted on her stern, and four 9-pounder guns for close-range defense against torpedo boats. She was protected with a complete iron armored belt that was thick on either end and thick amidships. The main battery guns were protected by thick barbettes. ==Service history== Vasco da Gama was laid down at the Thames Iron Works shipyard in London, Britain in 1875,Gardiner, p. 378Mason, p. 658 and was launched on 1 December 1876.Gardiner & Gray, p. 372 The ship was completed in 1878.Brassey, p. 293 She served as part of the coastal defense force that protected Lisbon, the Portuguese capital, and the mouth of the river Tagus.Paloczi-Horvath, p. 46 On 26 June 1897, Vasco da Gama participated in the Fleet Review at Spithead celebrating Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee.

Her iron belt armor was removed and stronger steel armor was installed in its place. The ship's crew increased to 260 officers and men. All of the changes caused her displacement to rise to . Work on Vasco da Gama was completed by 1903. On 27 August 1907, a gas explosion aboard the ship injured several crewmen.Palmer, p. 447 During political unrest in April 1913, part of the crew of Vasco da Gama had to be removed from the ship, as they had been involved in a planned ultra-Radical coup d'\u00e9tat against the First Portuguese Republic. On 14 May 1915, the crew again participated in unrest; they mutinied and killed the ship's captain and bombarded Lisbon, killing around one hundred people.Chisholm, pp. 130\u2013131 Vasco da Gama remained the flagship of the Portuguese Navy at least as late as 1914, as the Portuguese naval budget was insufficient to fund a suitable replacement vessel.Paloczi-Horvath, p. 80 Thoroughly obsolete, she remained in the Portuguese fleet until 1935, when she was sold for scrapping. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * ==External links== Category:Naval ships of Portugal Category:Ships built in Leamouth Category:1876 ships Category:Maritime incidents in 1907 Category:Maritime incidents in 1913 Category:Maritime incidents in 1915 ",
