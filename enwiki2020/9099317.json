The station's programmers have always contributed on a voluntary basis. Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 has never broadcast advertisements, and has a strong social and freedom-of- expression commitment. Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 was established as a pirate community radio station in Budapest in 1991 as a way of bringing the public's attention to the fact that there was at that time no legal framework for independent and community broadcasters. During the first years of its broadcasting, Tilos (meaning \"forbidden\" in Hungarian) enjoyed wide public interest and played a key role in the 1995 liberalisation of the airwaves in Hungary. Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 obtained a legal frequency license in 1995 and became a popular local community station in Budapest with its morning phone-in talk-shows and its music programmes, broadcasting 12 hours a day. Tilos is a key player in the cultural and lifestyle scene of Budapest. Meanwhile, Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 has its fingers on the public pulse with its social thinking, minority oriented programmes, and its radical and tolerant attitude. Tilos' broadcasts are mainly financed by listeners' donations and the income from fund-raising events, and partly by support from EU programmes, international NGOs and charity institutions. In November 1999, Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 had to apply for a new frequency licence. Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 wanted to broadcast 24 hours a day. Tilos did not receive a new frequency licence \u2013 this meant that the radio had to leave its frequency in 1999. In October 2002, 3 years later, with its third application, Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 received a licence for the 90.3 MHz frequency in Budapest for seven years. Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 can also be heard via cable and via Internet 24 hours a day. In 2011 Hungary's new media authority (Nemzeti M\u00e9dia- \u00e9s H\u00edrk\u00f6zl\u00e9si Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g) has begun investigating Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 for playing a song by rapper Ice-T which it said \"could influence the development of minors in a negative way\" on 2 September 2010 (at 5.51pm). The Nemzeti M\u00e9dia- \u00e9s H\u00edrk\u00f6zl\u00e9si Hat\u00f3s\u00e1g said the song should only have been broadcast after 21.00pm. (BBC) Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 argues that since the lyrics are in English and the knowledge of foreign languages among the Hungarian population is far below EU average, furthermore the station has very few young listeners, so the song could not have an \"adverse affect [sic] on the moral development\" of children under 16. (Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3) Hungarian authorities said their investigation is based on a 1996 law regulating radio and television. (SeattlePI.com) Tilos R\u00e1di\u00f3 points out that \"up till this point, for over a decade, it hasn\u2019t occurred that the authority would investigate and disapprove of the lyrics of a non-Hungarian song\".
