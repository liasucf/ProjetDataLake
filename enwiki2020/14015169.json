    "text": "Funplex is the seventh studio album (eighth overall) by The B-52s, recorded during 2006 and 2007. The album was released on March 25, 2008, by Astralwerks RecordsRelease Date It was the first album of new material that the group had released since Good Stuff in 1992, although the band did record two new songs for their 1998 compilation album Time Capsule: Songs for a Future Generation. The album came as a result of the band's renewed touring, and a feeling that they needed something new to perform. Guitarist Keith Strickland was inspired to create an updated sound for the band when listening to the New Order album Get Ready and hired producer Steve Osborne. Osborne's production incorporates more modern elements of electronica. == Single releases == The first single from the album was released digitally on January 29, 2008, and is the title track, \"Funplex\". A music video was filmed in West Hollywood on March 1, 2008 and featured a cameo appearance by RuPaul, who had previously appeared in the video for \"Love Shack\".1 Funplex debuted at number 11 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart, selling about 30,000 copies in its first week.Katie Hasty, \"Day26 Upends Danity Kane To Debut At No. 1\", Billboard.com, April 2, 2008. The second single from the album was \"Juliet of the Spirits\". == Alternate versions == The CD, packed in the Digipak format, was released in three front cover color variants in the lettering for the album title and the band's shadows: the original (shown above) in gray, multi-colored, and hot pink. In the colored versions, the coloring also extends to the band's instruments. The band members themselves, along with the band's logotype, retain their original rendering throughout all versions.
