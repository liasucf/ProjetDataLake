    "text": "Burkina Faso\u2013North Korea relations refers to the current and historical relationship between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Burkina Faso. Neither country maintains an embassy in the other, although the DPRK formerly had an ambassador accredited in the Burkinab\u00e9 capital Ouagadougou. ==History== Relations were especially close during the Cold War, when the DPRK was most active in foreign affairs. North Korea provided military equipment to the army of what was then the Republic of Upper Volta in the mid-1970s, during the reign of the military leader Colonel General Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana. North Korea also provided agricultural and technical assistance during the Cold War. Military aid continued under the rule of Captain Thomas Sankara, with an accord signed in 1983. Sankara, a Marxist revolutionary, visited Pyongyang several times, first as Prime Minister on 13 March 1983 and then as President on 3 September 1985. A DPRK\u2013Burkina Faso Friendship Association reportedly existed during this period. Relations remained close during the early reign of Sankara's successor, Blaise Compaor\u00e9, who took power in a 1987 military coup. Compaor\u00e9 visited Pyongyang in September 1988. In the late 1980s there was several cases of cooperation between the two countries \u2013 for example, the DPRK constructed an open-air theatre in Koudougou, and a trade agreement to exchange Burkinab\u00e9 cotton and minerals for North Korean agricultural machinery was signed. Diplomatic activity quieted down after the Cold War, but some cooperation continued. In 1998 the North Korean government completed the construction of five small water reservoirs in Burkina Faso. Straying from the traditional relations, Burkina Faso \u2013 a temporary UNSC member at the time \u2013 voted in favour of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 in 2009, imposing further economic sanctions on North Korea. In a statement, the Burkinab\u00e9 representative said his country's vote was due to its commitment to a nuclear weapon-free world. ==Trade== In 2016, bilateral trade was worth US$34 million, making Burkina Faso North Korea's seventh largest trading partner. ==See also== * Foreign relations of Burkina Faso * Foreign relations of North Korea ==References== North Korea Category:Bilateral relations of North Korea ",
