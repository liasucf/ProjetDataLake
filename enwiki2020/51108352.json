    "text": "Bordeaux is an unincorporated community in Thurston County, in the U.S. state of Washington. ==History== A post office called Bordeaux was established in 1903, and remained in operation until 1942. The community was named after Thomas Bordeaux, a businessperson in the lumber industry. Lumbering operations ended in the 1940s once the timber had been extracted, and the town's population dwindled. When the towns sawmill shut down in the mid-20th century the towns population completely left soon after. It is now located on private property which is inaccessible to the public. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Thurston County, Washington Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) ",
