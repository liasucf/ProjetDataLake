Hoffmeier believes that the 'way of Shur' was located along the Wadi Tumilat \u2014 an arable strip of land to the east of the Nile Delta, serving as the ancient transit route between Ancient Egypt and Canaan across the Sinai Peninsula.James K. Hoffmeier, \"Major Geographical Issues in the Accounts of the Exodus\". In Israel: Ancient Kingdom Or Late Invention? Daniel Isaac Block, ed. B&H; Publishing Group, 2008 When Hagar ran away from Sarah (Abram's wife, her owner), \"the Angel of the Lord found her ... by the fountain in the way to Shur\" (Book of Genesis, , KJV). Shur is also mentioned in 1 Samuel 15:7 \u2014 \"Then Saul slaughtered the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt.\"Bible, New Living Translation According to the Book of Exodus (), Marah is located in the \"wilderness of Shur\". Easton's Bible Dictionary (1893) says that Shur is \"a part, probably, of the Arabian desert, on the north- eastern border of Egypt, giving its name to a wilderness extending from Egypt toward Philistia (Gen. 16:7; 20:1; 25:18; Ex. 15:22). The name was probably given to it from the wall which the Egyptians built to defend their frontier on the north-east from the desert tribes. This wall or line of fortifications extended from Pelusium to Heliopolis.\" ==References== Category:Book of Exodus Category:Book of Genesis Category:Books of Samuel Category:Torah places Category:Wadi Tumilat ",
