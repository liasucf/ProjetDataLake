    "text": "KTFD-TV, virtual channel 50 (UHF digital channel 28), is a UniM\u00e1s-affiliated television station licensed to Denver, Colorado, United States. The station is owned by Entravision Communications, which also operates Boulder-licensed Univision-owned station KCEC (channel 14) under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with the Univision Local Media subsidiary of Univision Communications. The two stations share studios on Mile High Stadium West Circle in Denver; KTFD-TV's transmitter is located atop Lookout Mountain, near Golden. ==History== The station first signed on the air on February 22, 1996 as KTVJ. Founded by Roberts Broadcasting, it originally operated as an independent station. In January 2003, Roberts sold the station to Univision Communications. Two months later on March 10, 2003, the station changed its call sign to KTFD-TV (which was modified to KTFD-DT on June 23, 2009, in correspondence with the callsign modifications to the \"-DT\" suffix applied by all Univision-owned stations following the digital television transition), and became an owned-and-operated station of Univision's secondary network TeleFutura. KTFD's signal was formerly relayed on low-power analog translator station KDVT-LP (channel 36) in Denver, which was owned by Entravision Communications. The translator was never converted to digital, and its license was canceled on September 13, 2017.https://fccdata.org/?facid=24516&appid;=595256&i;=1 On December 4, 2017, as part of a channel swap made by Entravision Communications, KTFD and sister station KCEC swapped channel numbers, with KTFD moving to digital channel 26 and virtual channel 50. On January 9, 2019, KTFD completed the migration to digital channel 28 from digital 26 as part of the FCC spectrum auction repack. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital channel is multiplexed {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

The station's digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 15. Through the use of PSIP, digital television receivers display the station's virtual channel as its former UHF analog channel 14. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1996 Category:1996 establishments in Colorado TFD-TV Category:UniM\u00e1s network affiliates Category:Bounce TV affiliates Category:GetTV affiliates Category:Court TV Mystery affiliates TFD-TV Category:Entravision Communications stations ",
