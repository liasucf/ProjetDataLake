In the show, there was a group of Audio Jockeys (AJs) who hosted individual radio programs. AJs hosted their programs in an open and movable studio. Listeners were able to listen through and tvN's official YouTube Channel during the actual recording of the show. A few days after the actual recording, the audio of the different programs hosted by the AJs was released. Afterwards, the radio show was also televised to enable the audience to watch how the AJs prepared behind the scenes and hosted their individual shows during the program itself. On 7th and 8th recording, the concept changed to visual radio where listeners could watch live on YouTube what was happening at the recording location itself. == Segments == {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:100%;\" !style=\"width:20%;\"style=\"text-align:center;|Segments !style=\"width:80%;\"|Details |- !colspan=2|Episode 1 \u2013 4 |- |Monsta X's Monstyle |In this segment, the 4 Monsta X members introduced different types of food. |- !colspan=2|Episode 1 \u2013 6 |- |Boom Box |During this segment, there were small segments like \"Answer the Music\" for the listeners to take part, lip-sync performances and many more that drew many listeners' attention. |- |So Yoo-jin's Sweet Salon |In this segment, Yoo-jin gave listeners parenting tips.
