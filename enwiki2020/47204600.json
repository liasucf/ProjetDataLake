    "text": "WMDE, virtual channel 36 (VHF digital channel 5), is an independent television station licensed to Dover, Delaware, United States. The station is owned by WRNN-TV Associates. WMDE's transmitter is located north of Wye Mills, Maryland, southwest of Dover. Despite its physical location well east of the city, the station is assigned by Nielsen to the Washington, D.C. television market. Unlike most WRNN-TV Associates stations, WMDE does not operate a studio or an advertising sales office locally; instead, master control and internal operations are based at WRNN-TV's studios in Rye Brook, New York. ==History== WMDE signed on May 24, 2013. The station was originally owned by Western Pacific Broadcast LLC. Shortly after sign-on, Nielsen granted WMDE's request to be assigned to the Washington market instead of Philadelphia (where Dover is located) or Baltimore (where Wye Mills is located). Must-carry rules defer to Nielsen's decision with respect to market assignment. WMDE is thus carried on every cable and satellite provider in the Washington market, with the exception of Cox Communications, which filed a complaint to the FCC seeking to block carriage and prevailed in 2015. WRNN-TV Associates agreed to acquire the station for $11.5 million on April 25, 2018; the sale was completed on July 11, 2018. ==Legal controversy== WMDE was originally an Atlantic City allocation, licensed in Seaford, Delaware. However, Western Pacific Broadcast petitioned to move it to Dover. That move was protested and then held up due to an appeal by another company that wanted to move its Wyoming and Nevada allocations to the Philadelphia and New York City markets, respectively (one of which was the station that became WJLP). The move of WMDE was deemed to be a more legitimate move, but its owner still had to wait pending the other station moves. This shuffling of stations was primarily sparked by the new allocations deriving from the digital TV changes in 2011. ==Digital channels== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
