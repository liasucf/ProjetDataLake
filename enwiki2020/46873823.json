He was the only minor candidate to appear on the ballot in South Carolina's \"First in the South\" primaries, perhaps due to the comparatively higher cost of the state's ballot entry fee. The Wilson campaign was the first presidential campaign, Democratic or Republican, to buy advertisements in the state of Iowa. He dropped-out on April 12, 2016. In the general election, Wilson personally voted for Republican nominee Donald Trump. ====Campaign finances==== Wilson speaking at the 2016 Scott County, Iowa Democratic Party Dinner Detailed below are the FEC-filed finances of Willie Wilson 2016 as of 5/6/2016 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |+ Receipts |- ! scope=\"col\"|Financial Source ! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|Amount (USD) |- |Federal Funds||0 |- |Itemized Individual Contributions||28,685 |- ||Unitemized Individual Contributions||6,705 |- |Party Committees Contributions||0 |- |Other Committees Contributions||0 |- |style=background:#D3D3D3|Total Contributions||style=background:#D3D3D3|35,390 |- |Transfers from Authorized Committees||0 |- |Candidate Loans||1,055,100 |- |Other Loans||0 |- |style=background:#D3D3D3|Total Loans||style=background:#D3D3D3|1,055,100 |- |Offsets to Operating Expenditures||9,931 |- |Fundraising Offsets||0 |- |Legal and Accounting Offsets||0 |- |style=background:#D3D3D3|Total Offsets||style=background:#D3D3D3|9,857 |- |Other Receipts||0 |- |style=background:#A9A9A9|Total Receipts||style=background:#A9A9A9|1,100,421 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |+ Disbursements |- ! scope=\"col\"|Disbursements ! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|Amount (USD) |- |Operating Expenditures||1,055,444 |- |Transfers To Authorized Committees||0 |- ||Fundraising||0 |- |Exempt Legal and Accounting||0 |- |Candidate Loan Repayments||11,627 |- |Other Loan Repayments||0 |- |style=background:#D3D3D3|Total Loan Repayments||style=background:#D3D3D3|11,627 |- |Individual Contribution Refunds||0 |- |Political Party Contribution Refunds||0 |- |Other Committee Contribution Refunds||0 |- |style=background:#D3D3D3|Total Contribution Refunds||style=background:#D3D3D3|0 |- |Other Disbursements||33,350 |- |style=background:#A9A9A9|Total Disbursements||style=background:#A9A9A9|1,100,421 |- |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" border=\"1\" |+ Cash Summary |- ! scope=\"col\"|Category ! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"|Amount (USD) |- |Beginning Cash On Hand||0 |- |Current Cash On Hand||0 |- |Net Contributions||35,390 |- |Net Operating Expenditures||1,045,512 |- |Debts/Loans Owed By Campaign||1,043,472 |- |Debts/Loans Owed To Campaign||0 |- |} ===2019 Chicago mayoral campaign=== In March 2018, Wilson formally announced that he would run a second time for Mayor of Chicago in the 2019 mayoral election. During his campaign, Wilson generated controversy for handing out money to churchgoers. This practice of his was challenged before the Illinois State Board of Elections, which found that it did not violate any campaign finance laws since the money came from his non-profit foundation. Wilson defended his actions, declaring that his church appearances were not campaign-related, and that he was not buying votes. He continued this practice after the decision by the Board of Elections. During the campaign, in late November of 20, Wilson declared that he believed that other black candidates needed, \"to get out of the way.\" Wilson launched challenges to the candidature petitions of several black candidates, including Roger Washington,, Ja'Mal Green, Neal Sales-Griffin, and Dorothy Brown. At the last minute, Wilson moved to drop his challenge to Sales-Griffin's and Brown's petitions. Brown was still removed from the ballot due to Toni Preckwinkle maintaining her challenge to Brown's petition, but Sales-Griffin was allowed to be included on the ballot. Chicago Electoral Board Chair Marisel Hernandez chastised the Brown campaign for its political maneuver's regarding ballot challenges. Wilson was endorsed by the Cook County Republican Party. Wilson failed to make it to the runoff, placing fourth with 59,072 votes, equal 10.61% of vote cast. Wilson performed very well on the West and South sides of the city. Despite placing fourth, Wilson had a plurality of the vote in more wards than any other candidate (he came first in thirteen wards). The thirteen wards that Wilson carried a plurality of the vote in were all predominately black (these being thirteen out of the total of eighteen wards in the city that are predominately black). Again, Wilson's endorsement was actively sought by both candidates in the runoff. Wilson endorsed Lori Lightfoot. ===2020 U.S. Senate campaign=== In August 2019, Wilson expressed his intention to challenge incumbent United States Senator from Illinois Dick Durbin in 2020, running in the general election as an independent challenger to Durbin. Rather than run as an independent, he ultimately opted to run under the ballot line of his newly-created \"Willie Wilson Party\". ==Personal life== Wilson's son Omar, who was involved in gangs and drug dealing, was shot and killed at the age of 20. ==Political stances== Wilson self-identifies as an independent Democrat. In the 2016 United States Presidential general election, Wilson personally voted for Republican nominee Donald Trump. When asked in 2019 about his possible vote in the 2020 election, Wilson declared, \"I am not going to vote, nor will I ever vote again, for President Trump.\" During the COVID-19 pandemic in Illinois, Wilson advocated that churches should be allowed to hold in-person services despite the state's stay-at-home order. === Economic policy === Wilson stated in 2019 that he believes the spending of tax money has \"not proportionately benefited all races of citizens,\" in Illinois. === LGBTQ rights === Wilson tweeted in response to the Obergefell v. Hodges decision, \u201cI disagree with what I consider the Supreme Court\u2019s reinterpretation of what constitutes marriage. Marriage has and should always be that sacred union between a man and a woman. Period.\" However, in 2018, Wilson declared that he had changed his mind on the issue of same-sex marriage, declaring that he now believes that, \"everybody is entitled to do whatever they want to do and be with whoever they want to be.\" In a 2018 interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Wilson stated that his upbringing in the Deep South had made it difficult for him to understand the LGBTQ community, but that he was \"reaching out\" and seeking to \"learn\". ==Electoral history== ===Mayoral=== {| class=wikitable !colspan=5|2015 Chicago mayoral election |- !colspan=1 rowspan=2 |Candidate !colspan=2 |General Election !colspan=2 |Runoff Election |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- | Rahm Emanuel (incumbent) | align=\"right\" | 218,217 | align=\"right\" | 45.63 | align=\"right\" | 332,171 | align=\"right\" | 56.23 |- | Jes\u00fas \"Chuy\" Garc\u00eda | align=\"right\" | 160,414 | align=\"right\" | 33.55 | align=\"right\" | 258,562 | align=\"right\" | 43.77 |- | Willie Wilson | align=\"right\" | 50,960 | align=\"right\" | 10.66 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Robert W. \"Bob\" Fioretti | align=\"right\" | 35,363 | align=\"right\" | 7.39 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | William \"Dock\" Walls, III | align=\"right\" | 13,250 | align=\"right\" | 2.77 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Write-ins | align=\"right\" | 52 | align=\"right\" | 0.01 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Total | align=\"right\" | 478,256 | align=\"right\" | 100 | align=\"right\" | 590,733 | align=\"right\" | 100 |- |} {| class=wikitable !colspan=5|2019 Chicago mayoral election |- !colspan=1 rowspan=2 |Candidate !colspan=2 |General Election !colspan=2 |Runoff Election |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- | Lori Lightfoot | align=\"right\" | 97,667 | align=\"right\" | 17.54 | align=\"right\" | 386,039 | align=\"right\" | 73.70 |- | Toni Preckwinkle | align=\"right\" | 89,343 | align=\"right\" | 16.04 | align=\"right\" | 137,765 | align=\"right\" | 26.30 |- | William Daley | align=\"right\" | 82,294 | align=\"right\" | 14.78 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Willie Wilson | align=\"right\" | 59,072 | align=\"right\" | 10.61 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Susana Mendoza | align=\"right\" | 50,373 | align=\"right\" | 9.05 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Amara Enyia | align=\"right\" | 44,589 | align=\"right\" | 8.00 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Jerry Joyce | align=\"right\" | 40,099 | align=\"right\" | 7.20 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Gery Chico | align=\"right\" | 34,521 | align=\"right\" | 6.20 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Paul Vallas | align=\"right\" | 30,236 | align=\"right\" | 5.43 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | Garry McCarthy | align=\"right\" | 14,784 | align=\"right\" | 2.66 | colspan=2 bgcolor=darkgray | |- | La Shawn K.
