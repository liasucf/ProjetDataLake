    "text": "{| |} The second proposed USS Hempstead (AVP-43) was a United States Navy attack transport that was never laid down. Hempstead was to have been a Haskell-class attack transport, attack transports differing from conventional transports in being specifically designed to unload their troops and cargo over the side into boats, less efficient for hauling troops and cargo but far more efficient for unloading them in an amphibious landing. The Haskell class was based on a re-designed version of the civilian Victory Ship hull. Hempstead was excess to requirements after the end of World War II, and the Maritime Commission contract with Oregon Shipbuilding Corporation, Portland, Oregon, for her construction was cancelled on 27 August 1947 before construction began. == References == * Category:Cancelled ships of the United States Navy Category:World War II auxiliary ships of the United States Category:Haskell-class attack transports Category:United States Navy New York (state)-related ships ",
