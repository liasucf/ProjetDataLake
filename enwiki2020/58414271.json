Stone was the winner of The Evening Telegram Ten-Mile Road Race each year from 1926 to 1932, and set a race record of 52:58 in 1929 which stood for forty years. Stone represented Newfoundland at the 1930 British Empire Games and held Newfoundland records for the half-mile, one-mile, five-mile and ten-mile distances. He was a member of the Newfoundland team that placed first in the Maritime competition on two occasions. Stone was denied a chance to compete in the Olympics as the Dominion of Newfoundland lacked a National Olympic Committee. == References == Category:1906 births Category:1969 deaths Category:People from Fogo Island, Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Bishop Feild School alumni Category:Sportspeople from Newfoundland and Labrador Category:Canadian male middle-distance runners Category:Canadian male long-distance runners Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 1930 British Empire Games Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Newfoundland ",
