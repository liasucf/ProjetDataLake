While a student, he had the ambition of becoming a marine scientist and started taking interpretation classes. In order to pay for his studies, he worked in a supermarket where he dressed up as a chocolate ball. He got his very first job in a TV series named Entre dos fuegos for ETB basque television. In 1999, he left the Basque Autonomous Community to start an acting career in Madrid. Thanks to series like A las once en casa (where he played Coyote, boyfriend of a girl named Lucia), El grupo or Periodistas he achieved certain notoriety in Spain. The Uni\u00f3n de Actores nominated him for the Best Actor Award for El grupo (2000)- in which a Unax played a drug addict who wanted to resume family ties- and Best Supporting Actor for Periodistas (2001), where he was also nominated for Fotogramas de Plata Awards. He completed his work on TV with an appearance in Compa\u00f1eros, in which he played a robber who dies in a school while trying to flee police. == Career == He made his debut in the cinema in B\u00e1ilame el agua, for which he also wrote some parts of the script. His first main role came with Volver\u00e1s (2002). In that film he played a good student who is about to leave home, when he met his criminal brother (Tristan Ulloa), thus leaving the \"right way\" and trying to help him to reach emotional maturity during a night. In that year, 2002, Ugalde had a supporting role in the film Bellas durmientes by Eloy Lozano. And year later, 2003, Ugalde starred in the controversial film Diario de una becaria by Josecho San Mateo, director of Ugalde's first film (B\u00e1ilame el agua). That year, he was about to premiere Equus in theatre, playing same role for which Peter Firth was nominated for an Oscar: a young aggressive, on the brink of madness, with a great fear of the outside world (similar to the teenager who played in El grupo) who is overcome by shyness and emotional instability. Finally the work was suspended. However, this failed attempt highlighted the fact that Unax Ugalde was specializing in violent youth with a good heart, as he plays the role of Gorilo in Hector (Gracia Querejeta, 2004). That year the director Paul Malo, with whom he had worked on a short film, offered him starring in Fr\u00edo sol de invierno. Two months after the release of the latter, Unax Ugalde received a nomination for the Goya Awards for his performance in Hector as well as a new nomination in the Uni\u00f3n de Actores Awards. In 2005, he premiered Queens, in which he went into the skin of a man about to marry his boyfriend (Daniel Hendler) in the Spanish first gay wedding and could not support his castrating mother, who will deliberately lose her dog in order to make impossible a normal life for the couple. In his next film, Alatriste, he played the son of a fellow of Viggo Mortensen who died in Flanders. While recording he received the news that Daniel Br\u00fchl was to play Salvador Puig Antich in Salvador, to the detriment of his own candidacy. When he completed his role in Alatriste, Unax Ugalde recorded his third international film, this time in English. Milo\u0161 Forman asked him to play the brother of Natalie Portman in Goya's Ghosts along with Javier Bardem, Randy Quaid, Stellan Skarsg\u00e5rd, Eusebio L\u00e1zaro, Blanca Portillo, Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00f3mez, Andr\u00e9s G\u00e9rtrudix and Fernando Tielve. He combined the filming of his last two works with the promotion of Shooting Star which led him, among other places, to the Berlin Film Festival and in 2005 to the Festival of Seville. In 2006, before premiering Alatriste, he filmed with Julianne Moore, Savage Grace, playing one of Tony Bakeland's lovers. In 2007, he played a young Florentino Ariza in the film adaptation of the book Love in the Time of Cholera. Then he starred in La buena nueva, in which he plays a priest who spends the Spanish Civil War in the navarrese town of Alsasua and who will witness with horror the atrocities being committed in the name of religion. In this movie, Ugalde stars with Guillermo Toledo and fellow Basque actress Barbara Goenaga, among others and is directed by Helena Taberna. In 2008, Ugalde played the role of Roberto \"El Vaquerito\" Rodr\u00edguez in Che Part 1: The Argentine, the first part of the two-parts biopic about Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara film, Che. The film is an American superproduction inspired about Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara's life during Cuban Revolution and directed by Steven Soderbergh. In 2010, Ugalde filmed three movies: Cefal\u00f3podo directed by Rub\u00e9n Imaz, a Mexican film about overcoming of break-up in a couple; Bon App\u00e9tit opera prima was directed by David Pinillos, the film was shot in Zurich (Switzerland) and filmed in English, in addition the film won Goya Award for Best New Director; and finally No controles directed by Borja Cobeaga, Pagafantas`s director. In 2011, Ugalde premiered two films. The first film is There Be Dragons, the film was directed by Roland Joff\u00e9 and it is based on Josemar\u00eda Escriv\u00e1 de Balaguer's life, catholic priest and founder of Opus Dei. The film has been the best second of Spanish cinema on its first week-end, the record goes to Torrente 4; the second film is Tequila: Historia de una pasi\u00f3n by Sergio S\u00e1nchez Su\u00e1rez, Ugalde's second raid in Mexican cinema. A part, Ugalde has shot scenes for a play called Olagu\u00edlbe 1808 by Patxi Basabe, in this play there are scenes filmed because they want interaction between watchers and the play. In addition, Ugalde stars in Baztan by I\u00f1aki Elizalbe, Spanish film that's shooting in Basque. Baztan had its premiere in 60th San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival, the film garnered positive reviews and critical acclaim. Finally, in december Ugalde premiered TV film El asesinato de Carrero Blanco in ETB and 2012 in TVE. In 2012, Ugalde starred in Dracula, a horror film directed by Dario Argento, shooting in 3D and in English, Ugalde plays Jonathan Harker, one of the main protagonists. Dracula was shown in 65th Cannes Film Festival and the film was greeted with largely mixed reviews from professional film critics. Next year, Ugalde shot two films.

In addition, Ugalde is joined in the cast of 3rd season of Spanish series Gran Reserva. == Work == === Filmography === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |+ Film roles ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Role ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes and awards |- |2000 || B\u00e1ilame el agua|| David || |- | 2001 || Mi dulce || \u00d3scar || Turia Award for Best New Actor |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2002 || Volver\u00e1s || Ignacio || |- | Bellas durmientes || Young Lawrence || |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2003 || C\u00e1mara oscura || Iv\u00e1n || |- | Diario de una becaria || Marcos || |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2004 || H\u00e9ctor || Gorilo || Nominated \u2013 Goya Award for Best Supporting Actor Nominated \u2013 Spanish Actors Union Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role |- | Fr\u00edo sol de invierno || Adri\u00e1n || Ourense Independent Film Festival Award for Best Actor |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 2005|| Queens || Miguel || |- | Rosario Tijeras || Antonio || |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 2006 || Goya's Ghosts || \u00c1ngel Bilbat\u00faa || |- | Alatriste || \u00cd\u00f1igo Balboa || |- | Savage Grace || Black Jake Mart\u00ednez || |- |rowspan=\"2\"| 2007 || La buena nueva || Father Miguel || Toulouse Cinespa\u00f1a Award for Best Actor Turia Award for Best Actor Valladolid International Film Festival, Award for Best Actor Nominated \u2013 Cinema Writers Circle from Spain Award for Best Actor |- | Love in the Time of Cholera || Young Florentino || |- |2008 || Che Part 1: The Argentine || Roberto \"El Vaquerito\" Rodr\u00edguez || |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 2010|| Cefal\u00f3podo || Sebasti\u00e1n || |- | Bon App\u00e9tit || Daniel || M\u00e1laga Spanish Film Festival|M\u00e1laga Spanish Film Festival, Silver Biznaga for Best Actor Nominated \u2013 Cinema Writers Circle from Spain Award for Best Actor Nominated \u2013 Spanish Actors Union Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Leading Role |- | No controles || Sergio || |- |rowspan=\"4\"| 2011 || There Be Dragons || Pedro Casciano || |- | Tequila: Historia de una pasi\u00f3n || Antonio || |- | Baztan || Joxe || |- | El asesinato de Carrero Blanco || Arriaga || TV Film |- |rowspan=\"3\"|2012 || Dracula || Jonathan Harker || |- | Bypass || Mar\u00eda's friend || |- | Somos gente honrada || Luis || |- |2013 || C\u00e1sate conmigo || Antonio || |} === Short films === {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\" |-style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !
