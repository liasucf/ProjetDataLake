Despite the dissolution of the reserve by Andreotti and his oath in the hands of President Leone, the birth of the government was uncertain until the night before of his presentation in Parliament. The wide and above all rapid trust given to the government was also the result of the climate of emergency in which Montecitorio was found at the news that, an hour before the opening of the session, the Red Brigades had kidnapped the President of the Christian Democracy Aldo Moro and killed the men of his escort. Moro was also assassinated on 9 May 1978.
