The first Encyclo-Media was held at the University of Central Oklahoma in Edmond, Oklahoma on September 10 & 11, 1981. There was a special breakout program held for recipients of the Library Media Improvement Grant. In the late 1970s the Library Media Improvement Program was established by the Oklahoma state legislature, the Oklahoma State Board of Education, and the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE). Money was appropriated and Library Media Improvement (LMI) Grants were awarded to help upgrade the collection and staffing of school libraries to meet state and national guidelines. LMI Grants were awarded from 1978 through 1994, beginning with the 1977-78 school year. Encyclo-Media started as a result of the LMI Grants. In 1980 a workshop was held for grant schools. Barbara Spriestersbach, Assistant Administrator at the OSDE, extended the program to everyone after widespread interest, not just grant schools. The following year, Encyclo-Media was officially organized and as a result Spriestersbach was awarded the American Association of School Librarians Baker & Taylor Distinguished Service Award in 1991 for her leadership in the implementation of the LMI program. Since the first Encyclo-Media directors of the Library Media/Instructional Television Section have organized and directed the conference. ==See also== *Oklahoma State Superintendent of Public Instruction *Public education *Public education in the United States *Board of education *Oklahoma Department of Career and Technology Education *Oklahoma Educational Television Authority ==References== ==External links== *Oklahoma State Department of Education official website * *Encyclo-Media official website Education, State Board of Education, State Board of Education, State Board of Category:State departments of education of the United States Category:Government agencies established in 1971 Category:1971 establishments in Oklahoma ",
