She capsized and was lost with all hands off Corsica at the end of 1799. Royal Danish Naval Museum \u2013 Hvide \u00d8rn There were three previous ships bearing this name in the Danish navy. ==Officers== *Hans Michael KaasTops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 1 pages 711 -712captained Hvide \u00d8rn (in company with HDMS Helleflynderen, captain Hans Mossin,Tops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 2 page 206 as far as England) as she escorted a convoy of fifteen ships from Flekker\u00f8 on 5 November 1798 to the Mediterranean. An incident was reported from the English Channel as a British frigate attempted to \"visit\" the convoy, which nevertheless arrived safely off Lisbon on 13 December. Captain Kaas' was suffering from extreme fatigue as Hvide \u00d8rn continued to the Mediterranean where he was helped by the seconding from the Danish frigate Triton of Kaptein-lieutenant J D van der Osten as a second captain. In April 1799 extra ballast (in the form of 200 pieces of ballast iron) was bought and added to the Hvide \u00d8rn to make the ship stiffer in handling. On 29 April a storm in Livorno harbour saw the ship driven ashore. The damage was repaired under van der Osten's professional supervision. As Captain Kaas' health improved slightly and then deteriorated he was replaced as captain by van Osten on 14 August 1799 and travelled back to Denmark with Triton. Hans Kaas died as Triton arrived back in Copenhagen on 5 October 1799. *Jan David van der Osten , captain, took command of Hvide \u00d8rn in July 1799 when the previous captain, H M Kaas, took sick leave. His last report before leaving Livorno on 23 December 1799 was that the ship was in good order and the crew all well.Tops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 2 page 281 *Johan HohlenbergTops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 1 page 587, junior lieutenant, younger brother of the ship's designer, went down with the ship. *Other officers lost with the ship were Robert Ferdinand Moltke Lynch, senior lieutenant,Tops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 2 p126 Jacob Meyer, second in command, Tops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 2 p180 and Joost von Hemmert, senior lieutenant.Tops\u00f8e-Jensen Vol 1 page 563 ==Loss== The ship left Livorno on 26 December 1799 and disappeared on the night of 29/30 December in a hurricane force storm 18 Danish miles (One Danish mile = 7.532 Km) west of Corsica.This reference gives two near-contemporary references to the loss.
