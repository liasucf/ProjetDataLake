He also served as a Leichenverbrenner (corpse cremator) at Grafeneck, Brandenburg, and Bernburg during the Aktion T4, the SS \"euthanasia\" program. Niemann was killed during the Sobibor prisoner uprising in 1943. ==SS career== Niemann joined the Nazi Party in 1931 as member number 753,836 and the SS in 1934 as member number 270,600. He first served at Be\u0142\u017cec extermination camp, where he commanded Camp II, the extermination area. He then was transferred to Sobibor extermination camp. Niemann was deputy commander of Sobibor on various occasions in 1942 before being given the position permanently in early 1943. After Heinrich Himmler's visit to Sobibor on 12 February 1943, Niemann was promoted to SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer.Sobibor Interviews: Biographies of SS-men, sobiborinterviews.nl; accessed 23 December 2014. Karl Frenzel, also a commandant at Sobibor, recalled how Niemann handled a particular threat of prisoner revolt within the camp:Karl Frenzel interview On 14 October 1943, a prisoner uprising took place at the Sobibor camp. Niemann was the highest-ranking SS officer who was on duty that day, and so he was the first person targeted to be assassinated by the prisoners. Niemann was killed in the tailor's barracks with an axe to his head by Alexander Shubayev, a Jewish Red Army soldier imprisoned at Sobibor.Yitzhak Arad (1987), Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, pg. 326. . The Times newspaper reported that 350 wartime photos of Sobibor and other places had recently been made publicly available by descendants of deputy camp commandant Johann Niemann. An exhibit was held in Berlin and a related book published with these photos. Two photos may include John Demjanjuk, a Ukrainian-born Trawniki guard who later emigrated to the United States. In 2011 he was convicted by a Munich court of \"being an accessory to the murder of 27,900 Jews at Sobibor\". \"The Times\", Jan 20 2020, page 29 ==References== Category:1913 births Category:1943 deaths Category:Assassinated Nazis Category:Belzec extermination camp personnel Category:Sobibor extermination camp personnel Category:SS-Untersturmf\u00fchrer Category:Axe murder Category:People from Leer (district) ",
