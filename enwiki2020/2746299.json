    "text": "Kenneth Cordele \"Ken\" Griffin (born October 15, 1968) is an American billionaire hedge fund manager, entrepreneur and investor. He is the chief executive (CEO) and Co-Chief Investment Officer (Co-CIO) of the investment firm Citadel, which he founded in 1990. Citadel operates with an estimated $36 billion in investment capital. ==Early life and education== Griffin pictured in the 1985 Boca Raton High School yearbook. Griffin was born in 1968 in Daytona Beach, Florida, the son of a building supplies executive, and grew up in Boca Raton, Texas, and Wisconsin. Griffin's father was a project manager for General Electric. Griffin went to middle school in Boca Raton followed by Boca Raton Community High School, where he was the president of the math club. In high school Griffin ran a discount mail-order education software firm out of his bedroom called EDCOM. Griffin was featured in a 1986 Sun-Sentinel article titled \"For team of Boca students, computer's screen is arena\". Griffin states in the article that he thinks he will become a businessman or lawyer and goes on to say that he believes the job market for computer programmers will significantly decrease over the coming decade. Griffin started at Harvard College in the fall of 1986. That year, Griffin first began investing after finding what he believed were inefficiencies in the convertible bonds market, which allows company bonds to be converted into stock. He convinced school administrators to allow him to install a satellite dish on the roof of Cabot House for receiving stock quotes. He also asked Terrence J. O\u2019Connor, the manager of convertible bonds at Merrill Lynch in Boston, to open a brokerage account for him with $100,000 that Griffin had gotten from his grandmother, his dentist, and others. His first fund launched in 1987 with $265,000, days after his nineteenth birthday. The fund launched in time to profit from his short positions at the time of the stock market crash of October 19, 1987. Griffin graduated in 1989 with a degree in economics. ==Career== Institutional Investor magazine. After graduating in 1989, Griffin moved to Chicago to work with the investor Frank Meyer, founder of Glenwood Capital Investments. Meyer allotted $1 million of Glenwood capital for Griffin to trade. A year later in 1990, Griffin founded Citadel with assets under management of $4.6 million aided by contributions from Meyer. By 1998, Citadel had grown to a team of more than 100 employees and $1 billion in investment capital. == Wealth and investments == In 2003, aged 34, Griffin was the youngest self-made individual on the Forbes' Forbes 400 with an estimated net worth of $650 million. In 2014, Griffin reportedly earned $1.3 billion including a share of his firm's management and performance fees, cash compensation and stock and option awards. In 2017 Griffin reportedly earned $1.4 billion in compensation from Citadel. In 2018 Griffin reportedly earned $870 million in compensation from the hedge fund segment of Citadel. In 2019 Griffin reportedly earned $1.5 billion of compensation from Citadel. Griffin had an estimated net worth of US$15.8 billion, making him the 2nd richest person in Illinois and the 45th richest person in America. Griffin was the lead investor, losing 20 percent, in Aragon Global Management beginning in 2003 through to 2009 which was launched by his then wife Anne Dias Griffin, also seeded with money from New York investor Julian Robertson. According to Bloomberg News Griffin has around $5.4 billion of personal assets invested in Citadel's funds. == Political views == In 2012, Griffin identified as a Reagan Republican in an interview with the Chicago Tribune. He said the belief \"that a larger government is what creates prosperity, that a larger government is what creates good\" is wrong. During an interview with David Rubenstein Griffin criticized Elizabeth Warren's proposals. In September 2020 Griffin wrote an op-ed published in the Chicago Tribune stating his opposition to Gov. Pritzker's \"Fair Tax\" proposal that would change Illinois income tax from a flat tax to a graduated tax. Griffin has been criticized by Senator Elizabeth Warren for his real estate purchases. Griffin has pushed back on the characterization that he only supports republicans, saying in an interview with David Rubenstein \"I've supported over the years candidates on both sides of the isle ... I was an early supporter of President Obama because he came to me to be the education secretary. You want my vote you want my support that's the issue, you come to me and you say I will fight for education in America\". Griffin skipped a signing ceremony for the phase-one trade deal with China at the White House creating an awkward moment with Pres. Trump saying \"Ken Griffin, Citadel. What a guy he is. Where are you, Ken? Where the hell is he? He\u2019s trying to hide some of his money. Look, he doesn\u2019t want to stand up. Where the hell is Ken? See, Steve, you\u2019ll stand, and he\u2019s very quiet about it. He\u2019s in here someplace; he just doesn\u2019t want to stand.\" A Citadel PR rep later said that Griffin was invited but confirmed he was unable to attend. Griffin criticized President Trump's tweets berating FED Chairman Jerome Powell calling the tweets \"completely inappropriate for the president of the United States\". === Political donations === ==== Super-PAC/Outside Group/Party Contributions ==== After the 2007\u201308 financial crisis, Griffin made political donations to conservative political candidates, parties, and organizations such as American Crossroads and the Republican Governors Association. In 2015, Griffin donated $5.855 million to Conservative Solutions Project, Freedom Partners Action Fund, Right to Rise, and Future45. In December 2015, Griffin endorsed Marco Rubio for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination and stated that he planned to donate millions to a pro-Rubio super PAC. Before this endorsement, Griffin had donated $100,000 each to three super PACs supporting Rubio, Jeb Bush, and Scott Walker for the GOP nomination. In March, 2020, Griffin contributed $1 million to the 1820 PAC created to support the re-election bid of U. S. Senator Susan Collins in Maine.https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/pacgave2.php?cycle=2020&cmte;=C00698126 (Accessed 28 July, 2020) In late 2020 Griffin donated another $500,000 to the 1820 PAC. {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\" |+Griffin Super-PAC/Outside Group/Party Contributions as of October 2020 ($250k minimum) !Date !Amount !Recipient !Associated Party/Candidate !Date !Amount !Recipient !Associated Party/Candidate |- |06-15-2020 |$3,000,000 |Congressional Leadership Fund |Republican (House of Representatives) |09-22-2014 |$700,000 |American Crossroads |Republican |- |06-15-2020 |$3,000,000 |Congressional Leadership Fund |Republican (House of Representatives) |08-27-2020 |$500,000 |1820 PAC |Sen.

The space was \"raw space\" meaning Griffin had to build it out.

She is a French graduate of Harvard Business School who had worked at Goldman Sachs, Soros Fund Management, and Viking Global prior to starting Chicago-based $55 million firm Aragon Global Management. The couple married in July 2003 and had three children. A 2007 profile of the couple states \"Anne Dias Griffin is the champagne to Ken Griffin\u2019s Budweiser.\" In July 2014 Mr. Griffin filled a divorce petition in Cook County Illinois citing \"irreconcilable differences\" with his wife. According to the divorce petition filled by Mr. Griffin, the couple had entered into a prenuptial agreement which governed the split of their assets in the event of a divorce. As part of the agreement Ms. Anne Griffin received $22.5 million at the beginning of their marriage and received an additional $1 million each year they were married. In court fillings Ms. Dias Griffin claimed that she had been forced to sign the prenuptial agreement. In later court fillings Ms. Anne Griffin requested $1 million per month in child support payments. The breakdown included $300k per month for private jet travel, $160k per month for vacation rentals and $60k per month for office space and staff. Mr. Griffin claimed that Ms. Anne Griffin was attempting to use child support to fund her \"opulent lifestyle\". During the divorce Ms. Anne Griffin requested $450,000 for a 10 day vacation to St. Barts over winter break with their 3 children. Mr. Griffin denied her request but agreed to pay $45k for a winter vacation. Mr. Griffin and Ms. Anne Griffin finalized their divorce in October 2015. The divorce was settled out of court just hours before a public trial over the prenup agreement was set to begin. Mr. Griffin maintains joint custody of his children with his ex-wife. The divorce drew much press and tabloid attention. In an interview with the WSJ Mr. Griffin called the experience \"a chapter I wish I could edit out\".
