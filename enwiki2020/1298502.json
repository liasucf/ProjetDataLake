    "text": "Aron Mohamed Winter (; born 1 March 1967) is a Dutch former professional football midfielder and current assistant manager of Greece national football team. He has played for Ajax and Sparta Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for Italian sides Lazio and Internazionale, and for the Netherlands national team. ==Club career== ===Ajax=== Winter began his career with amateur club VV Unicum in Lelystad, moved on to SV Lelystad, and the same year joined Ajax at the age of 19. His first game for Ajax was a match against FC Utrecht on 6 April 1986, which Ajax won 3\u20130. Winter won two KNVB Cups (1987 and 1988), the Eredivisie title (1990), the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup (1987) and the UEFA Cup (1992) ===Lazio=== In 1992, he moved to the Roman team Lazio, playing his first match against Sampdoria on 6 September, which Lazio tied 3\u20133. ===Inter Milan=== In 1996, Winter joined Inter Milan, with whom he won the UEFA Cup in 1998. He had also played in the previous year's final, with the game going to penalties. However, Winter missed his penalty as Inter lost to Schalke. ===Ajax return and Sparta Rotterdam loan=== Winter left Inter for his former club Ajax in 1999. In 2001, he was loaned out to Sparta Rotterdam. He played 32 games for Sparta Rotterdam and scored one goal before returning to Ajax to finish his career, and where he chose to retire in 2003. ==International career== Winter was a member of the Dutch national team that won the 1988 European Football Championship, but made no appearances during the final tournament. In the 1994 FIFA World Cup, he scored a goal against Brazil in the quarter-finals, making him the only player of Indian descent ever to score in a World Cup. He was also selected for the Dutch national team for Euro 96, as well as the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Winter placed in Rijkaard's Euro 2000 squad. Having represented his national team 84 times, scoring 6 goals, Winter is currently the twelfth most capped player for the Dutch national team. ==Managerial career== After three years as assistant coach for the Ajax first academy team, Winter signed a three-year contract with Canadian side Toronto FC on 6 January 2011. Winter brought former colleague Bob de Klerk from Ajax to be his assistant coach, while Paul Mariner was also brought in the same day as Director of Player Development. After a disappointing season opener against Vancouver Whitecaps that ended in a 4\u20132 away defeat on 19 March, Winter won his first game as Toronto's head coach the following week against Portland Timbers 2\u20130 in Toronto. Winter won his first trophy with Toronto in early July as Toronto defeated Vancouver 3\u20132 on aggregate to capture its third consecutive Canadian Championship, thereby earning a berth in the 2011\u201312 CONCACAF Champions League. Winter then guided Toronto to the Champions League semifinals, the first time a Canadian club had progressed that far in the competition. Toronto eventually lost 7\u20133 on aggregate to Santos Laguna. However, Toronto began the 2012 MLS season with nine straight losses, the worst start to a season in the history of the MLS. Toronto won its tenth match 1\u20130 versus Philadelphia on 26 May 2012, but it was not enough to save Winter's job, as the club announced on 7 June 2012 that he would be replaced by the director of player development, Paul Mariner. ==Personal life== Winter was born in Paramaribo, Suriname. His cousin Ricardo Winter is also a former football player/manager who headed the Suriname national football team.Aron Winter adviseert Surinaams elftal, Nation Suriname, October 24, 2009 ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Team !rowspan=\"2\"|From !rowspan=\"2\"|To !colspan=\"6\"|Record |- !G!!W!!D!!L!!Win % |- |align=left|Toronto FC |align=left|6 January 2011 |align=left|7 June 2012 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total |} ==Honours== ===Player=== Ajax *Eredivisie: 1989\u201390 *KNVB Cup: 1986\u201387 *UEFA Cup Winners Cup: 1986\u201387 *UEFA Cup: 1991\u201392 Internazionale *UEFA Cup: 1997\u201398 Netherlands *UEFA European Championship: 1988 Individual *Dutch Young Player of the Year: 1986 ===Manager=== Toronto FC *Canadian Championship: 2011, 2012 Ajax (as assistant manager) *Eredivisie: 2018\u201319 *KNVB Cup: 2018\u201319 ==See also== * List of MLS coaches * 2001\u201302 Sparta Rotterdam season ==References== ==External links== * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Paramaribo Category:Surinamese people of Indian descent Category:Surinamese emigrants to the Netherlands Category:Dutch people of Indian descent Category:Sportspeople of Indian descent Category:Dutch footballers Category:Dutch expatriate footballers Category:Netherlands international footballers Category:AFC Ajax players Category:S.S.
