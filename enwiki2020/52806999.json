The Kedah team led by then-Radhi Mat Din successfully ended Kedah's quest to complete all the national championship matches by winning the FA Cup for the first time in history. In the match against Sarawak in the Kedah final they were down 1-0 by national striker Che Zambil Ahmad and it was enough for Kedah to come out as the absolute winner of that historic night. The Kedah team was then led by local coach Mosthakeen Omar for a minute-long action in cooking and forcing a 1-0 lead into the new history. The success also brings endless satisfaction to the DAB Spirits manager as he has successfully completed and completed all the major championships he has contested at the national football arena. A very proud record was written by Spirits as a result of all his plans and sacrifices to the Kedah army. All Kedah supporters are celebrating this success.
