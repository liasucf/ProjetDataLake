Three large bronze-age barrows close to each other 127 meters above the sea, have given their name to the place, which contains a group of 22 barrows. \"Treh\u00f8je\" meaning three mounds, is one of four major vista points in the hills of Mols, each with a barrow on top. The others are Ellemandsbjerg, Stabelh\u00f8je and Agri Bauneh\u00f8j.Danmarks Kulturarvs Forening Goats, sheep, cattle and horses diminish tree growth at Treh\u00f8je. The view from Treh\u00f8je includes the east coast of mainland Jutland, the islands Sams\u00f8, Tun\u00f8 and Hjelm, plus the hilly Mols Bjerge landscape, including the peninsula Helgen\u00e6s. One can also see parts of southern Djursland and the towns of Aarhus and Ebeltoft in the distance. From the three barrows one can look down onto the bays of Knebel, Begtrup, Aarhus, and Ebeltoft, as well as the southern stretches of the Kattegat, the sea between Denmark and Sweden. The three barrows are five to six meters high, each made of about 650,000 pieces of dug- out grass turf. This is equivalent to 7 hectares of land where the turf has been peeled off for each barrow. A labor-intensive undertaking, that was part of the erection of 60,000 bronze-age mounds registered in Denmark. It has been calculated that in Denmark 100 to 150 mounds were built per year in the early Bronze Age (1800\u20131000 BC). This effort points towards a strong, homogenous and organized religious quest in a distant pre-Christian civilization. The vegetation in the open land surrounding Treh\u00f8je predominantly consists of bent grass. A slender type of grass that forms a wavy red and violet surface in July and August, and stands out as a golden surface in the winter sun, dotted with darker mulberry bushes. Here and there one might be able to make out the remains of narrow 8\u201315-meters-wide curved fields from the Middle Ages. These fields emerged when the farmers predominantly plowed the furrows towards the center of the field. Maybe with the purpose of creating a contour that drains standing water to the sides of the fields.Naturstyrelsen.dk Winter view Treh\u00f8je, south-west towards Begtrup Bay, Aarhus Bay and Aarhus Today focused landscaping underlies the formation of the open plain-like grassland surrounding Treh\u00f8je, as well as other parts of the protected Mols Bjerge Hills. Tree growth, which would otherwise take over the land, is kept down partly through grazing by sheep, goats, cattle and horses, and partly through felling of upcoming trees, as well as felling of established wooded areas. A nutrient-poor common-like landscape is a landscaping goal for the area. This type of landscape occurred naturally in the Middle Ages, probably due to intensive grazing and repeated haymaking on the commons, combined with not bringing back the same amount of nutrients in the form of manure, as was taken away, according to a theory. In some descriptions of the formation of the depleted vegetation around Treh\u00f8je there is no mention of the wind-erosion factor, which can blow away fertile topsoil nutrients \u2013 even though this has been a determining depletion-factor for surrounding land on Djursland in the Middle Ages. Spring view from Treh\u00f8je, south, over Ebeltoft Bay and Kattegat One of the ideas behind favoring a common-like landscape is to make the Hills of Mols resemble the woodless tundra-plains left over, when the ice sheets drew back from the land after the last ice age plus 10,000 years ago, before Denmark became covered with forest. Another purpose behind this landscaping goal is to create habitats for zoology, not least insects, that are rare in other parts of Denmark. In addition the wood-free open countryside is visitor friendly, giving opportunities for walks and biking on the paths and gravel roads surrounding Treh\u00f8je, as well as in the rest of hilly Mols Bjerge. == References == * Danmarks Kulturarvs Forening, http://www.fortidsmindeguide.dk/Trehoeje-gravplads.br010.0.html * Naturstyrelsen.dk http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/nst/89792/Mols%20Bjerge_221113_Web.pdf ==Further reading== * Naturstyrelsen.dk http://naturstyrelsen.dk/media/nst/89792/Mols%20Bjerge_221113_Web.pdf * Morten D.D.
