    "text": "Situla Benvenuti The Benvenuti Situla is a bronze situla that dates to ca. 600 B.C. It is a product of the situla art that spread north from the Etruscans in this period, in this case to the Este culture that flourished in Este, Veneto during the 7th century BC. The vessel is now conserved in the local National Museum Atestino. The relief work on the vessel depicts scenes of aristocratic life. These include banquetting as well as scenes of military victory. The iconography of the relief scenes of the situla may indicate Etruscan influence. ==See also== *Adriatic Veneti *Polada culture *Euganei *Canegrate culture *Golasecca culture *Prehistoric Italy ==External links== *La Situla Benvenuti ==References== Category:Archaeology of Italy Luca Zaghetto La situla Benvenuti di Este.
