It is primarily known for its many beaches and idyllic costal landscape, but there are also numerous trails used for hiking and biking.M\u0161bius, Aaron and Michael (2014). Norwegen. DuMont Reiseverlag. Page 168. . During the Viking Age, ocean water levels were 3\u20134 meters higher than today. Vester\u00f8ya was therefore an island surrounded by waters, but became a peninsula as water levels decreased.Christensen, Arne Emil and Anne Stine Ingstad (1992). Osebergdronningens grav: v\u00e5r arkeologiske nasjonalskatt i nytt lys. Schibsted. Page 29. . Vester\u00f8ya was previously known as Vell\u00f8y, which derives from Vadill-\u00f8y.Christensen, Arne Emil and Anne Stine Ingstad (1992). Osebergdronningens grav: v\u00e5r arkeologiske nasjonalskatt i nytt lys. Schibsted. Page 38. . West Island lies between the Sandefjordsfjord and Mefjord, south-east of the city center. The landscape is dominated by hills, mountains, forests, beaches, sloping rocks, and farm fields. The peninsula has a length of 10 kilometers. It is home to a large number of vacation homes, beaches, campgrounds, and recreational areas. Sea water levels were 20\u201325 meters higher 5,000 years ago, which means Vester\u00f8ya consisted of a large island and 25-30 minor islets. Previous names for Vester\u00f8ya include Vell\u00f8y, V\u00e6ll\u00f8y, Vall\u00f8y, Vel\u00f8yene, and V\u00e6ll\u00f8ynni. There are 25 km (15 mi.) of hiking trails at Vester\u00f8ya, which is an extension of the 20 km (12 mi.) coastal path at \u00d8ster\u00f8ya (East Island). Combined the 45 km (28 mi.) hiking trail is part of the international North Sea Trail. West Island is home to numerous preserved areas, including Holtan Plant Preserve, the only place in Vestfold og Telemark where the species Pipsissewa (Chimaphila umbellata) occurs.https://www.fylkesmannen.no/Vestfold/Miljo-og- klima/Verneomrader/Vestfolds-verneomrader/Holtan-plantefredningsomrade/ A rest area (\"Thomas Numme rasteplass\") at Langeby Beach is named after TV personality Thomas Numme, who grew up on Vester\u00f8ya. ==Folehavna Fort== Folehavna Fort at West Island's southernmost point was constructed by the Germans in 1941 during the German occupation of Norway. The surrounding area came under German control on May 8, 1941, and the fortifications were raised the same month. By the end of the war, the fort was equipped with four Belgian canons and several anti-aircraft canons. The fort was in use by German occupation forces until January 1943. It was home to numerous tunnels, including the longest which was 120 meters (394 ft.). It was also equipped with bunkers, trenches, fencing, barracks, floodlights, battlements, and minefields.Gjerseth, Simen (2016). Nye Sandefjord. Liv forlag. Page 71. . The Norwegian Armed Forces maintained control of the area until 1995 when it became a public recreation area. Bunkers, trenches, barracks, and tunnels can still be seen at Folehavna. At most about 200 German troops were stationed at Folehavna Fort. It is the southernmost point of Sandefjord which is located on the mainland (not including islands).J\u00f8ranlid, Marianne (1996). 40 trivelige turer i Sandefjord og omegn. Vett Viten. Page 54. . German forces constructed three large tunnels at Folehavna, including a 120-meter tunnel. Four 15 cm cannons were also installed in concrete gun pits on the sloping rocks.Holskj\u00e6r, Lars (2017). Kamper uten tall. Forlagshuset i Vestfold. Pages 121-122. .Larsen, Erlend (2010). P\u00e5 Tur i Vestfold del 1. E-forlag. Page 56. . The fort was originally known as \"Vester\u00f8en\" but was given the name Folehavna in 1943. The area was occupied by German forces in 1941 when Folehavna was owned by shipowner Anton Fredrik Klaveness. Folehavna came under the control of the Norwegian Armed Forces in May of 1945, and in July of 1950, 0.2 km2 (47 acres) was deemed an open-space area open for visitors. The Norwegian Armed Forces maintained control of the area until 1993. Although German forces at the fort were never in direct battles, they utilized Folehavna Fort to shoot down a British airplane in 1944. Today, Folehavna is used for recreational activities such as hiking, biking, and fishing. The parking lot is located 1.5 km (1 mi.) from the fort.Schandy, Tom and Tom Helgesen (2012).
