    "text": "Coloring Book is an extended play by the American post-hardcore band Glassjaw. The release was initially exclusively given away for free during the group's February\u2013March 2011 tour, and was said to serve as a preview for Glassjaw's upcoming third studio album. The EP was later made available from Glassjaw's webstore on October 1, 2012 and was packaged in a red gatefold sleeve along with a pink-colored DVD, Coloring Book: Live at the Forum. A limited edition 12\" vinyl pressing of the EP was released on August 13, 2013. Each disc is unique in that they were made up of three rings, each in different colors, thus meaning no two copies are the same. The 12\" edition was limited to 120 pieces. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Glassjaw * Daryl Palumbo \u2013 lead vocals * Justin Beck \u2013 guitars, keys * Durijah Lang \u2013 drums, percussion * Manuel Carrero \u2013 bass Production and recording * Ryan Seigel \u2013 production * Jonathan Florencio \u2013 production * Samuel Vaughan Merrick IV \u2013 mixing ==References== Category:Glassjaw EPs Category:2011 EPs Category:Self-released EPs ",
