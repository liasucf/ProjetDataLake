He does a decent job and also hints at a possible sequel to this film. While one has seen blatant slapstick humour and loads of double entendres in Kannada comedy films, this one has a tad more cleaner approach to the genre.Raj B Shetty seems to have an extension of his character from Ondu Motteya Kathe and he shines. Sujay, as Raj's pessimistic philosopher friend, is a hoot. Each of the cast member seems to be carefully picked. Be it Girish Shivanna as the comical inspector or Pramod Shetty as the costume wearing don, they all shine. Though, at times the gags are dragged a bit. But, for those who like comedy, Gubbi Mele Brahmastra is going to be a treat, as it is reminiscent of some of the classics from the 80s and 90s.\" == References == == External links == * Category:Indian films Category:Kannada-language films Category:2010s Kannada-language films Category:Indian action comedy films Category:Indian romantic comedy films Category:2019 directorial debut films Category:2019 films Category:Films shot in Mysore Category:Films shot in Bangalore Category:2019 romantic comedy films Category:2019 action comedy films Category:Masala films Category:2019 comedy films ",
