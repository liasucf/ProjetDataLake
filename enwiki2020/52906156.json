    "text": "Dean Westlake (born January 8, 1960) is an American politician from Alaska. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives in 2017, representing the 40th District in Alaska's North Slope region. A member of the Democratic Party, he caucused with the Democrat-led majority in the House of Representatives that includes independents and Republicans. ==Political career== Westlake first ran for the House in 2014, mounting an unsuccessful Democratic primary challenge to Barrow Representative Benjamin Nageak, who caucused with the Republican-led majority caucus at the time. He ran again in 2016 and defeated Nageak in a very close election that was contested in court. A lower court ruled that 50 votes cast in Shungnak, a rural community that went overwhelmingly for Westlake, had been improperly cast and should not have been counted. The Alaska Supreme Court reversed the ruling however, making Westlake the winner. Westlake was unopposed in the general election. In December 2017, after seven female capitol staffers aired complaints of inappropriate sexual behavior by Westlake, he apologized. However when his impregnation of a 16-year-old in 1988, when he was 28, was about to be publicized, he tendered his resignation, effective within ten days. | September 06, 2014 | Adjutant General Out After Release of National Guard Report, Governor calls for Special Team to Restore Respect and Responsibility | Mary Kauffman, SitNews | | 10/22/2014 | Alaska National Guard Sex Abuse Scandal Threatens GOP Governor\u2019s Re-election | Dana Liebelson | According to procedures in such a circumstance, elected District 40 representatives of his Democratic party submitted three names of prospective replacement candidates to the governor.
