    "text": "Map of Europe featuring the countries of Southern Europe (highlighted in dark green) Thirteen United States presidents have made presidential visits to Southern Europe. Woodrow Wilson became the first incumbent president to visit a Southern European country in January 1919 in the aftermath of World War I. Visits occurring during the 1940s through 1980s were offshoots of American diplomatic interactions during World War II and then the Cold War. To date, 31 visits have been made to Italy, 21 Vatican City, 10 to Spain, eight to Portugal, four to Greece, three to Bosnia and Herzegovina, three to Malta, three to Slovenia, two to Croatia, two to Serbia (Kosovo), one to Albania, and one to North Macedonia. Three were also made to Yugoslavia prior to its breakup during the early 1990s. Of the present-day nations in (or partly within) the region, all but Cyprus, San Marino, Andorra, Montenegro, and Serbia have been visited by a sitting American president. ==Table of visits== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !President !Dates !nowrap|Country or territory !Locations !Key details |- |rowspan=2|Woodrow Wilson | | |Rome, Genoa, Milan, Turin |Met with King Victor Emmanuel III and Prime Minister Vittorio Orlando. |- | | Vatican |Apostolic Palace |Audience with Pope Benedict XV. |- |rowspan=3|Franklin D.
