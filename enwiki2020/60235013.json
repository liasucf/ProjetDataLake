    "text": "Yttrium(III) nitrate is an inorganic compound with the formula Y(NO3)3. The hexahydrate is the most common form commercially available. ==Preparation== Yttrium(III) nitrate can be prepared by dissolving corresponding metal oxide in 6 mol/L nitric acid: : Y2O3 \\+ 6 HNO3 \u2192 2 Y(NO3)3 \\+ 3 H2O ==Properties== Yttrium(III) nitrate hexahydrate loses crystallized water at relatively low temperature. Upon further heating, basic salt YONO3 is formed. At 600 C, the thermal decomposition is complete. Y2O3 is the final product. Y(NO3)3\u00b73TBP is formed when tributyl phophate is used as the extracting solvent. ==Uses== Yttrium(III) nitrate mainly uses as a source of Y3+ cation. It is a precursor of some yttrium-containing materials, such as Y4Al2O9, YBa2Cu3O6.5+x and yttrium-based metal-organic frameworks. It can also be used as a catalyst in organic synthesis. ==References== Category:Yttrium compounds Category:Nitrates ",
