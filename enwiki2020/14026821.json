    "text": "Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein (PITP) or priming in exocytosis protein 3 (PEP3) is a ubiquitous cytosolic domain involved in transport of phospholipids from their site of synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi to other cell membranes. ==Biological function== PITP has been also shown to be an essential component of the polyphosphoinositide synthesis machinery and is hence required for proper signalling by epidermal growth factor and f-Met-Leu-Phe, as well as for exocytosis. The role of PITP in polyphosphoinositide synthesis may also explain its involvement in intracellular vesicular traffic. ==Structure and evolution== Along with the structurally unrelated Sec14p family (found in ), this family can bind/exchange one molecule of phosphatidylinositol (PI) or phosphatidylcholine (PC) and thus aids their transfer between different membrane compartments. There are three sub-families - all share an N-terminal PITP-like domain, whose sequence is highly conserved. It is described as consisting of three regions. The N-terminal region is thought to bind the lipid and contains two helices and an eight-stranded, mostly antiparallel beta-sheet. An intervening loop region, which is thought to play a role in protein-protein interactions, separates this from the C-terminal region, which exhibits the greatest sequence variation and may be involved in membrane binding. This motif marks PITP as part of the larger SRPBCC (START/RHOalphaC/PITP/Bet v1/CoxG/CalC) domain superfamily. PITP alpha (UniProt ) has a 16-fold greater affinity for PI than PC. Together with PITP beta (UniProt ), it is expressed ubiquitously in all tissues. ==Human proteins== The family of human phosphatidylinositol transfer proteins has several members: *Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, alpha (PITPNA) *Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, beta (PITPNB) *Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, cytoplasmic 1 (PITPNC) *Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, membrane-associated 1 (PITPNM1) *Phosphatidylinositol transfer protein, membrane-associated 2 (PITPNM2) *PITPNM family member 3 (PITPNM3) ==References== Category:Protein domains Category:Protein families Category:Peripheral membrane proteins ",
