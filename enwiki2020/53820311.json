Howitt \u2013 served in both World Wars and was Manchester City Council's chief architect from 1946 until he retired in 1961. ==Life== Leonard Howitt was born on 27 December 1896 in Islington, London. His parents were William Howitt, a type founder, and his wife Ada. After her husband's death in about 1910, Ada Howitt returned to Manchester with her son. Howitt died at his home in Brooklands, Sale on 20 May 1964 aged 67. He was survived by his wife, two daughters and a son. ==Career== Howitt started work in the architect\u2019s office at Manchester Town Hall shortly before the First World War. After war service, he attended the University of Liverpool School of Architecture from where he graduated in 1925. He then joined Herbert J Rowse Architects in Liverpool where he remained until 1934. He was part of the team that designed the Mersey Tunnel (Queensway) ventilation towers. He was appointed chief architectural assistant to Liverpool City Council's Director of Housing before returning to Manchester as deputy city architect in 1937.

The following year he was appointed city architect, a position he held until he retired in 1961.
