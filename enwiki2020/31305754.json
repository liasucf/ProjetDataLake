Jean volunteers to travel to India to bring back another worthy stone. Cabannes insists on coming along and complicates the journey more than once before saving Jean's life and earning his respect. The men are caught leering at a lovely woman bathing in a waterfall and are taken prisoner by her men. She is Queen Maya of Nepal. In the temple, Jean and Cabannes learn of the Eye of the Goddess, a rare blue diamond. It is in the possession of the Mogul of Golconda, who promises to give it to Queen Maya as a wedding gift, but secretly plans to take rule of her country. With the use of a new \"secret weapon,\" a prototype of hand grenade, the Frenchmen are able to overcome the Mogul's men in battle. The queen offers to give them the diamond, so in return they invite her to Louis's coronation. ==Cast== *Fernando Lamas as Jean Baptiste Tavernier *Arlene Dahl as Queen Maya *Gilbert Roland as Baron Paul de Cabannes *Sheldon Leonard as Mogul *Jay Novello as Gujar, Maya's steward ==References== ==External links== * Category:1953 films Category:Films directed by John Brahm Category:Cinecolor films Category:Films set in India Category:Films set in Paris Category:Films set in the 17th century Category:Warner Bros. films Category:1950s historical adventure films Category:American historical adventure films Category:American films Category:Films scored by Paul Sawtell ",
