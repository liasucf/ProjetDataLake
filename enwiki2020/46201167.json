To find proof of the claim, Jakra and his girlfriend go with Squidge and another interested party, Professor Thornton, to the Malayan jungle where Tama was raised. There they see her tiger, which can swim, and hear tales of a killer elephant responsible for many deaths. Natives, expecting riches, turn against the visitors, but Tama's tiger comes to their rescue. They discover documents that prove Tama to be the legitimate heir to the fortune, then run from the rampaging elephant, which ultimately plunges off a cliff to its death. ==Cast== Dorothy Lamour in Beyond the Blue Horizon *Dorothy Lamour as Tama *Richard Denning as Jakra the Magnificent *Jack Haley as Squidge Sullivan *Patricia Morison as Sylvia *Walter Abel as Prof. Thornton *Helen Gilbert as Carol *Elizabeth Patterson as Mrs. Daly *Edward Fielding as Judge Chase *Gerald Oliver Smith as Chadwick *Frank Reicher as Sneath *Abner Biberman as La'oa *Charles Stevens as Panao *Charles Cane as Broderick *William Telaak as Willys *Gogo as Gogo *Ines Palange as the native nurse == References == == External links == * Category:1942 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American adventure films Category:1940s adventure films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films directed by Alfred Santell Category:Films scored by Victor Young ",
