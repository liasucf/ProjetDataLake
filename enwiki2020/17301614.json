A year earlier, Capitol A&R; man Nick Venet had heard Rawls at Pandora's Box Coffee Shop, where Rawls was playing there for $10 a night plus pizza in late 1959, and signed him to the label.Lou Rawls' Official Website includes his biography, discography, itinerary, photo album, contacts, acting credits, Seasons 4 U sales and much more. One stillborn single emerged before Lou had the brainstorm to do an album of blues and jazz standards, backed by then up-and- comer Les McCann and his trio, who were performing nearby at The Bit on Sunset Boulevard. Before his Grammy-winning album Love Is a Hurtin' Thing, Stormy Monday was the first of more than 20 other albums Rawls would record on that label in only a decade.Lou Rawls at All About Jazz ==Track listing== ===Side One=== # \"(They Call It) Stormy Monday\" (T-Bone Walker) \u2013 3:45 BB uh # \"God Bless the Child\" (Arthur Herzog, Billie Holiday) \u2013 4:30 # \"See See Rider\" (Ma Rainey) \u2013 3:11 # \"Willow Weep for Me\" (Ann Ronell) \u2013 5:57 # \"I'm Gonna Move to the Outskirts of Town\" (Andy Razaf, \"Casey Bill\" Weldon) \u2013 4:00 ===Side Two=== # \"In the Evening (When the Sun Goes Down)\" (Leroy Carr, Don Raye) \u2013 3:28 # \"'Tain't Nobody's Biz-Ness If I Do\" (Percy Grainger, Robert Prince, Clarence Williams) \u2013 2:45 # \"Lost and Lookin'\" (James Alexander, Lowell Jordan) \u2013 3:12 # \"I'd Rather Drink Muddy Water\" (Eddie Miller) \u2013 3:55 # \"Sweet Lover\" (John Leslie McFarland, Sid Wyche) \u2013 3:08 ===Reissue Tracks=== #\"Blues Is a Woman\" (Rawls) \\- 2:58 #\"A Little Les of Lou's Blues\" (Rawls) \\- 2:23 #\"(They Call It) Stormy Monday (Alternate Take)\" (Walker) \\- 2:58 ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== *Lou Rawls - vocals ;Les McCann Trio *Les McCann - piano *Leroy Vinnegar - bass *Ron Jefferson - drums ===Additional personnel=== *Nick Venet - producer *Malcolm Addley - remixing *Billy Vera - liner notes ==Notes== ==References== * Category:1962 debut albums Category:Lou Rawls albums Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Albums produced by Nick Venet ",
