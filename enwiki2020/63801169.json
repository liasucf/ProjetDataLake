Premier Supra Mahumapelo appointed him as the Member of the Executive Council for Roads and Public Works. He was sworn in on 27 May. On 1 June 2017, Mahumapelo removed Sambatha from the Executive Council. Mahumapelo reasoned that allegations of Sambatha selling land illegally led to his demotion, yet his dismissal was speculated to have partisan undertones. Mmule Maluleke was appointed his successor. In December 2018, newly elected premier Job Mokgoro named him the MEC for Health. He succeeded long-serving Magome Masike. He was retained in the position following the 2019 general election. ==Personal life== Sambatha is married to Phumza Sambatha; they have five children. ==References== ==External links== * *Face to face with North West Health MEC Madoda Sambatha \u2013 Spotlight Category:Living people Category:1975 births Category:People from the Eastern Cape Category:People from Gauteng Category:People from North West (South African province) Category:20th-century South African politicians Category:21st-century South African politicians Category:African National Congress politicians Category:South African Communist Party politicians Category:Politicians from Gauteng Category:Members of the North West Provincial Legislature Category:People from Dr Kenneth Kaunda District Municipality Category:People from the West Rand District Municipality ",
