Later his interest expanded to other forms of poetry as well. So, basically he is a poem writer. He became famous because of adopting a new style in marsiya writing. He used the third line of stanza free from following qafia of other three lines. Hilal Naqvi is one of the very authentic poets of Jadeed Marsia Nigari. Listening the Marsiya by Josh Malih Abaadi inspired him for marsiya writing. So he wrote the first marsiya in 1970, when he was a student of B.A. He presented the marsya to Josh Malih Abadi for correction. Josh has called him his very first student in one of his letters. Dr Hilal Naqvi was also a student of Naseem Amrohvi Sahib who guided him on his journey of writing Marsiya. Dr Hilal Naqvi has also written many Ghazals, Poems, Rubayaats and free verses. He is a critic of all the literary work of Josh including his Marsiyas. He has written more than six books about Josh. ==Publications== #Chashm e Num (1970) #Maqtal o Masha\u2019al (1976) #Pas e Tareekh (1982) #Azaan e Maqtal (Marsias by Hilal Naqvi - 1993) #Beesween Sadi aur Jadeed Marsiya (Thesis for PHD - 1994) #Guldasta e Ather per aik nazar (1977) #Jadeed Marsiya ky teen maimaar (1977) #Imanat eGham ( Baqar Imanat Khani ky Marsiyey (1982) #Armaghan e Naseem (1992) #Naseem Amrohvi ky marsiyey (2012) #Dr Yawer Abass ky marsiyey (2012) #Sabir Thariyaani ky Gujraati Qita\u2019at #Josh Malih Abaadi #Irfanyaat e Jaush (1991/1911)https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16590490-irfaniyat-e-josh #Josh Malih Abaadi ki nadir o ghair matbooa tehreerain (1992) #Jaush Malih Abaadi (Fun aur Shakhshiyat - 2007) #Josh k Inqalabi Marsyey (2010) #Auraaq e Josh (2010)https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=dp_byline_sr_book_1?ie=UTF8&text;=Dr.+Hilal+Naqvi&search- alias;=books&field-author;=Dr.+Hilal+Naqvi&sort;=relevancerank #Yaadon ki baraat ka qulmi nuskha #Inteqaadiyaat-i-Josh (2017) #Jameel Mazhari ky Marsiyey (1988) #Masnavi Aaab o Siraab (Jameel Mazhari - 1988) #Musaddas Faryaad o Jawab e Faryaad (1993) #Marsyey ki nayaab aawazain (2011) #Jadeed Bayaz e Marsiya (2012)http://drhilalnaqvi.webs.com/books Another contribution of Hilal Naqvi is the launch of commendable Risai Adab which is the first of its kind. So far, 36 volumes of this magazine have been published including two dedicated magazines, \"Anees and Dabeer number\", each one of which is spread on 1200 pages. Before Hilal Naqvi's work, the only poets with dedicated magazines on their names were Ghalib and Iqbal. Hilal Naqvi launched a magazine for Josh, called \"Josh Shanasi\"http://nation.com.pk/karachi/07-Nov-2009/Research-work-on-Josh- Malihabadi-underway which consists of the essays and research work of and about the poet. So far, 7 volumes of his magazines have been published. It is a well-accepted fact among the critics of Josh that for all the continuous work and research Hilal Naqvi has produced related to Josh, Hilal Naqvi is considered the most authentic authority on Josh in current era. ==Reviews== Hilal Naqvi's very first marsiya was Maqtal o Masha\u2019al. The academic, artistic and divine power of this work can be judged well by Ahsan Farooqi's review when he says that this musaddas (a genre of Urdu poetry in which each unit consists of 6 lines stanzas) is not only an addition in the many forms of modern poetry but like Musaddas-e-Haali, it is also a criticism of contemporary time, though such anticipation is far beyond Haali's approach but can be found in Iqbal's Musaddas as Shikwa \u2013 o \u2013 Jawaab-e-Shikwa. Josh Malih Abadi in his work has appreciated the revolutionary and universal message that Hilal Naqvi conveys in his Marsia. \"I appreciate him for breaking the tradition in the field of Masiya writing. His work did not incite tears but awakening. For him, Hussain (AS) is not confined as a leader of any specific sect or group, but he is a guide for the whole universe.\" ==References== ==External links== Category:People from Karachi Category:1950 births Category:Writers from Karachi Category:Living people Category:20th-century Pakistani poets Category:20th-century Urdu writers Category:Urdu poets from Pakistan Category:Pakistani male poets Category:20th-century male writers ",
