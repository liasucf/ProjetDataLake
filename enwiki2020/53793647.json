    "text": "The Pat\u00eda Valley dry forests (NT0225) is an ecoregion in southwestern Colombia. It covers a dry valley surrounded by mountains. The original habitat has mostly been destroyed by human activity, although a few pockets remain. ==Location== The Pat\u00eda Valley is in southwestern Colombia along the Pat\u00eda River and its tributaries, surrounded by ranges of the Andes. It has an area of . It is almost completely surrounded by the Northwestern Andean montane forests ecoregion. The western extension downstream along the Pat\u00eda River merges into the Choc\u00f3-Dari\u00e9n moist forests ecoregion.. ==Physical== The Pat\u00eda river flows westward from the Central massif of Colombia, cuts through the Western Cordillera and drains into the Pacific Ocean. In its upper section it runs through cloud forests and montane forests. The central section of the river forms the Pat\u00eda dry valley. The lower section to the west of the Western Cordillera flows through the Choc\u00f3 jungles of the Pacific region. The Pat\u00eda is fed by the Quilcac\u00e9, Guachicono, Mayo, Juanamb\u00fa, Pasto and Guaitara rivers. Average elevation is . The soils are sedimentary in origin, with areas of ash from the Purac\u00e9 and Sotar\u00e1 volcanoes. ==Climate== The K\u00f6ppen climate classification is \"As\": equatorial; summer dry. There are rainy seasons from October to November and from April to June. Mean annual rainfall is under . At a sample location in the mountains to the south at coordinates the mean monthly temperature is almost constant at just over throughout the year. Annual rainfall is about . Monthly rainfall varies from in July to in November, with a second peak of in April. ==Ecology== The Pat\u00eda Valley dry forests ecoregion is in the neotropical realm, in the tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests biome. The valley has been isolated from similar dry forests areas for long enough for unique flora and fauna to evolve. The ecoregion is part of the Tumbesian-Andean Valleys Dry Forests global ecoregion, which holds six terrestrial ecoregions: Tumbes-Piura dry forests, Ecuadorian dry forests, Pat\u00eda Valley dry forests, Magdalena Valley dry forests, Cauca Valley dry forests and Mara\u00f1\u00f3n dry forests. The fauna and flora of the global ecoregion have high levels of endemism. ===Flora=== Ranching and farming, with fire used to clear the land, have destroyed almost all the original vegetation. There are some endemic sub-species. Common plants in the dry valley now include Crescentia cujete, Guazuma ulmifolia, Cassia fistula, Bursera graveolens, Spondias mombin, Bauhinia picta, Ceiba pentandra and Gliricidia sepium. The cactus Pilosocereus colombianus is found in some place, as are Opuntia species The orchid Schomburgkia splendida grows in rocky places. ===Fauna=== Mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque) There are no endemic species, but some endemic sub-species of birds and butterflies, including the steely-vented hummingbird (Amazilia saucerottei australis). Until recently there were many mammals. Remote parts of the valley are still home to collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), red brocket (Mazama americana), Central American agouti (Dasyprocta punctata), ocelot (Leopardus pardalis) and cougar (Puma concolor). A population of Andean condor (Vultur gryphus) once nested on the steep walls of the Juanamb\u00fa and Guaitara rivers, but that species is no longer found in the region. Endangered mammals include Baird's tapir (Tapirus bairdii) and mountain tapir (Tapirus pinchaque). ==Status== The World Wildlife Fund gives the Pat\u00eda Valley dry forests ecoregion the status \"Critical/Endangered\". Most of the valley has been drastically modified by human activity, but there are still pockets of original vegetation and there are some efforts at conservation on privately owned land. Threats come from excessive hunting and collection of firewood, urban sprawl, agriculture, livestock and road construction. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * Category:Neotropical dry broadleaf forests Category:Ecoregions of Colombia ",
