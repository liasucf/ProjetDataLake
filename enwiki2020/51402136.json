    "text": "Arthur Taubman (1901 Astoria, New York - March 15, 1994, Boca Raton, Florida) was an American businessman entrepreneur and humanitarian. ==Early life and career== He was raised in Astoria, New York, on the Lower East Side. He left school at the age of 13 and worked as a department store stock boy to provide for his family of Austrian-Hungarian immigrants. While still a teenager, Arthur Taubman enlisted in the US Navy during World War I. He worked with one of his brothers selling auto parts headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The chain operated stores as far north as Boston and as far south as Washington, DC. However, the Great Depression wiped out the family's holdings. In 1932 he heard of a three store auto parts company in Roanoke, Virginia that was for sale. \"In order to help him raise the down payment to buy the chain, his wife Grace offered her wedding ring, which he then pawned along with his own Masonic ring.\"\"Advance Auto Parts, Inc., History.\" The company, purchased in April 1932 from the Pep Boys, became Advance Auto Parts. Although he did not have much of a formal education, he read books and applied his business sense to turn the company around and to be successful. \"According to company lore he ran Advance by following a four-point philosophy: provide value to customers; earn a reputation for honesty and integrity; ensure repeat business by providing quality merchandise and good customer service; and treat employees like family.\"\"Advance Auto Parts, Inc., History.\" ==World War II== \"During World War II, Mr. Taubman also helped about 500 European Jews reach the United States by filing affidavits with the immigration authorities saying the Jews were relatives. When questioned by Federal officials, he said any Jew facing death in Nazi-occupied Europe was his first cousin.\"\"Arthur Taubman, Entrepreneur, 92; Aided Jews in War\". New York Times. March 22, 1994, Obituaries. ==Later years== The Advance Auto Parts continued to grow after World War II, and opened 54 stores. Many of the stores also operated service bays, and sold lawnmowers and seat covers in addition to the auto parts. In 1969 he retired and his son, Nicholas F. Taubman, took control. \"Mr. Taubman was a strong civic leader, a chairman of the Roanoke Valley United Negro College Fund and a director of the Virginia Chamber of Commerce.\"\"Arthur Taubman\" Tire Business. 4/4/1994; Updated 9/1/2012. As a member of the Roanoke Jewish Community Council or RJCC, Arthur Taubman began collecting money to support people leaving Germany to go to Israel.Davidson, Sigmund. 2015. \"Roanoke Jews: A History\".

Taubman, of Roanoke; a daughter, Stephanie Low of Manhattan, three grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.\"\"Arthur Taubman, Entrepreneur, 92; Aided Jews in War\". New York Times.
