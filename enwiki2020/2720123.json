    "text": "Hazel Grove railway station is a junction on both the Stockport to Buxton and Stockport to Sheffield lines, serving the village of Hazel Grove, Greater Manchester, England. ==History== The station was built for the Stockport, Disley and Whaley Bridge Railway by the London and North Western Railway and opened on 9 June 1857. From 1923 until 1948, it was owned by the London Midland and Scottish Railway and, following nationalisation, it was operated by the London Midland Region of British Railways. At one time there was another station in the village, Hazel Grove (Midland) station, on the Midland Railway's line from New Mills South Junction to Manchester Central via Cheadle Heath; this opened in 1902, but it was less conveniently situated and closed in 1917. The line was extremely expensive to build with extensive earthworks. The navvies were accommodated in specially-built houses near the Rising Sun pub, which still exist, and are known as the \"Navvy Mansions\". The line from Edgeley Junction, just south of Stockport, to Hazel Grove was electrified in 1981 on the 25 kV AC overhead system. This allowed electric trains on the route from , via Sale, to serve the station until that line was closed for conversion to Manchester Metrolink operation in late 1991; electric services to and from Piccadilly continued thereafter. The signal box on the Buxton- bound platform remains in use. This controls the junction between the Buxton line and the chord linking it to the route through Disley Tunnel towards Sheffield at the country end of the station; it also controls a pair of carriage sidings at the Stockport end used for stabling trains that terminate here. The station in the 1900s ==Facilities== The station is staffed all week, with its ticket office on platform 1 open 06:05-19:00 weekdays (until 20:00 on Fridays only), 07:00-20:00 Saturdays and 09:00-16:30 Sundays. There are waiting rooms on both platforms, toilets in the main building and a small coffee shop on platform 2. Train running details are provided via automated announcements, timetable posters and digital information screens. Step-free access is available to both platforms via the lifts built into the footbridge linking the platforms.Hazel Grove station facilities National Rail Enquiries; Retrieved 23 February 2017 ==Services== Today Hazel Grove is served by three trains per hour to/from Manchester Piccadilly \u2013 the two trains per hour to/from Manchester Piccadilly to Buxton and the hourly Manchester Piccadilly to Hazel Grove stopping service.

The single-track Hazel Grove Chord opened in 1986.Hazel Grove Chord (looking south) Whatley, Peter, Geograph.org.uk; Retrieved 17 May 2017 This allowed trains to/from Stockport and Manchester Piccadilly to access the former Manchester Central \u2013 New Mills South Junction line just south of Hazel Grove station and thus provides a faster route between Manchester and Sheffield than the former route via Romiley and New Mills Central. The chord also enables Sheffield trains to serve Stockport and run to/from Liverpool Lime Street. ==References== * Radford, B., (1988) Midland Though The Peak Unicorn Books * Harrison, P., (2006) Striking A Chord With Electric ==External links== *Railscot \u2013 Hazel Grove Category:Railway stations in the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport Category:Former London and North Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations served by East Midlands Railway Category:Northern franchise railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1857 Category:1857 establishments in England ",
