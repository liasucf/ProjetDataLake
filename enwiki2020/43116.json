She was named 15 December in Tomrefjord with Minister of Defence Kristin Krohn Devold as godmother, and delivered to the Coast Guard on 18 January 2002. She entered service in mid-2002 and is homeported in Sortland. Her primary operating area is in the Arctic waters north of Norway, the Barents Sea and around the Svalbard islands. On 21 August 2019, Svalbard became the first Norwegian ship to reach the North Pole. Svalbard is the second largest ship in Norway's military armed forces (by tonnage), designed to supplement the three other helicopter- carrying ships of the Norwegian Coast Guard - the s. She is NBC-protected with constant overpressure, and is capable of icebreaking and emergency towing up to 100,000 tons. The Norwegian coastline is generally free of ice, thus Svalbard is the only active Norwegian icebreaking-capable vessel. A double acting ship, Svalbard is designed to break ice both ahead and astern. ==Foreign analogs== On 9 July 2007 the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported that Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper had announced that Canada would be building six to eight arctic offshore patrol ships (AOPS) for the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), modeled after Svalbards design. The vessels have been modified to meet the needs of the Canadian Navy. Some of the modifications include: increasing the ships' ice breaking capabilities, adding a larger and fully enclosed forecastle/cable deck for greater arctic protection, addition of a multipurpose operational space, updated command and control systems, an updated sensor suite, and an extended hangar for the larger Sikorsky CH-148 Cyclone helicopter. The project has been criticized for its high costs. For example, Irving Shipbuilding was awarded a CAD$288 million design contract for the vessel while the design of Svalbard and similar patrol ships within other countries paid less than one-tenth as much. The first ship in its class, , was delivered to the RCN on 31 July 2020 with its commissioning anticipated in mid-2021 following the completion of post- acceptance sea trials. In 2015 Russia started constructing the first of several vessels in its Project 23550. Think tank Global Security pointed out these vessels are almost the same length, displacement, power and endurance as the Svalbard class. They will also be able to travel through roughly the same depth of ice. The Russian vessels will be more heavily armed, with a main cannon, an anti-missile gatling gun, and launchers for eight cruise missiles. ==Notes== ==External links== * Marinelog article * Marinetalk article: KV Svalbard * Norwegian Forsvaerets article: KV Svalbard * Category:Patrol vessels of the Norwegian Coast Guard Category:Icebreakers of Norway Category:Ships built in Norway Category:2001 ships Category:Patrol vessels ",
