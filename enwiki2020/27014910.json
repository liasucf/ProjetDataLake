Currently, it is a shopping center as well as one of the sub locations in Kairia Location of Kirimara Division, Mathira East District, Mathira Constituency, Nyeri County. It is on the Karatina town- Karatina University (Kagochi Road), approximately 5 kilometers from Karatina Town (CBD) and roughly 130 kilometers from Nairobi city. Ihwagi is known to have one of the nicest weather in Karatina compared to other regions. This may be due to the fact that it is located on the slopes of Mt. Kenya. The area is encompassed with a great vegetation causing it to be one of the most friendly places in the region. Despite being a smaller region than most, Ihwagi's access to the Ragati river also makes it one of the best places to farm. As a result, most of the local citizens are subsistence farmers and small business owners. Due to the subtropical climate, the area is known to have plenty of rain which often causes the Ragati river to flood. However, the most damage caused by the river is the destruction of crops. This being said, farmers and Ihwagi's locals have developed various ways to deal with the floods. Mt. Kenya snow capped peak, the second highest point in Africa can be seen from here. Aberdare ranges can also be seen on the horizons, western side of Ihwagi.
