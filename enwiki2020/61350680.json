    "text": "The 328th Infantry Regiment was a unit of the United States Army. Organized during World War I as part of the 82nd Division, the regiment took part in combat in France as part of the American Expeditionary Forces. Its most famous member was Alvin York, who received the Medal of Honor for heroism near the Decauville railway line of Chatel-Ch\u00e9h\u00e9ry as part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. During the years between the world wars, the 328th Infantry was a unit of the Organized Reserve, and was based in Florida. During World War II, the 328th Infantry Regiment was reactivated as part of the 26th Infantry Division, and took part in combat in France, Luxembourg, Germany, and Austria. After the war, the 328th Infantry performed occupation duty in Linz, Austria. In 1946, the regiment was combined with the 181st Infantry Regiment and the 181st Infantry Regiment was designated a unit of the Massachusetts Army National Guard. ==Distinctive unit insignia== The 328th Infantry Regiment\u2019s Distinctive Unit Insignia was designed after its recall to active duty for World War II. The Minuteman at its top recalls the regiment's status as a Reserve unit and symbolizes its readiness to be called up at a moment\u2019s notice. The alligator recalls the 328th Infantry\u2019s years between the world wars when the regiment's headquarters and subordinate companies were located in Florida. The three fleur-de-lis are symbols of the regiment\u2019s most important World War I engagements in France -- its initial battles in Lorraine and the St. Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne Offensives. ==World War I== ===Creation=== The 328th Infantry Regiment was organized at Camp Gordon, Georgia on August 25, 1917. The 328th was assigned to the 82nd Division, the task organization of which included: * 82nd Division Headquarters :* 163rd Infantry Brigade ::* 325th Infantry Regiment ::* 326th Infantry Regiment ::* 319th Machine Gun Battalion :* 164th Infantry Brigade ::* 327th Infantry Regiment ::* 328th Infantry Regiment ::* 320th Machine Gun Battalion :* 157th Field Artillery Brigade :::* 307th Trench Mortar Battery ::* 319th Field Artillery Regiment ::* 320th Field Artillery Regiment ::* 321st Field Artillery Regiment :* 307th Train Headquarters and Military Police ::* 307th Engineer Regiment and Train ::* 307th Field Signal Battalion ::* 307th Supply Train ::* 307th Ammunition Train ::* 307th Sanitary Train ===Initial training=== Soldiers originally assigned to the 82nd Division, including the 328th Infantry, were predominantly from Georgia and nearby states, including Alabama and Tennessee. Its commander was Colonel Julian Robert Lindsey and the second-in-command was Lieutenant Colonel John W. Wright. The regiment's other field grade officers included Major Richard Wetherill, Major G. Edward Buxton Jr., and Major E. Hammond Johnson. The 82nd's newly-created units formed with new soldiers and a cadre of experienced noncommissioned officers from the 6th and 17th Infantry Regiments. Company grade officers (lieutenants and captains) were assigned as soon as they graduated from the Officers Training Camp held at Fort McPherson. Within two months of the division's creation, the Army began its transition to a wartime footing, and most of the division's now- trained soldiers were reassigned to augment National Guard divisions as they were federalized. By November 1917, the 82nd Division, to include the 328th Infantry, had been replenished with draftees. The draftees included men from all 48 states, and many were foreign born or first generation Americans, many of whom completed lessons in English as part of their military training. Division commander William P. Burnham remarked that regardless of their country of origin or home state, the men of the 82nd Division were \"all Americans\" now, which gave rise to the organization's nickname, the All- American Division. The 328th Infantry and the rest of the 82nd Division completed their training during the winter of 1917-1918, including instruction from British and French soldiers who were veterans of front line combat against the Germans. In April, the division was accepted into federal service and units traveled to Camp Upton, New York, where they completed their final training and preparations prior to transport to France. In late April, units traveled by train to Boston, where they boarded ships including HMS Grampian and HMS Scandinavian. The ships then traveled to New York City, where a convoy was organized for the trip across the Atlantic Ocean. ===Initial combat in France=== After arriving in Southampton and Liverpool, the 82nd Division boarded trains for the trip across England, then boarded ships for cross- channel voyage to France, where they arrived in May. After arriving in France, the 328th Infantry moved to positions near Horcelaines and nearby towns, where they prepared to go into combat as part of a larger American forces that augmented British troops in the area. By late June, the 328th Infantry was back under American control and moved to positions in the Toul sector, including the towns of Franchville, Ville St. Etienne, and Lucy. Between June 26 and 29, the 328th performed a relief in place and assumed the positions formally occupied by the 104th Infantry, a unit of the 26th Division. Lindsey was promoted to brigadier general as commander of the 164th Infantry Brigade, and Colonel Hunter B. Nelson succeeded him on June 26. The 328th manned its positions in the Toul sector until early August, when the 82nd Division was relieved by the 89th Division and moved to reserve positions around the towns of Troussey and Rigny-la-Salle. In mid-August, the 328th Infantry relieved the 6th Marines, and took up positions in towns including Dieulouard and Belleville, as well as the Liverdun woods. In September, the 328th Infantry took part in combat around the town of Norroy as part of the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. Subsequent advances moved the regiment closer to the town of Vandieres, and it sustained numerous casualties. On the 18th, the regiment stopped near Belleville to rest, re-equip, and reorganize. Between September 24 and 26, the regiment moved to the Argonne Forest, and occupied former French positions on the first's southeastern edge. By early October, subsequent advances and relocations found the regiment at a site known as Camp Mahaut, near Apremont. On the night of October 6-7, the regiment marched through Varennes-en-Argonne in the direction of Fl\u00e9ville, where it took up defensive positions and prepared to resume the offensive. ===End of combat operations=== On October 7, the 328th Infantry advanced near La Forge, intending to seize key terrain from the Germans and take possession of the area's Decauville railroad. Fighting continued into October 8, and when American forces were prevented from advancing by German machine guns in key locations including one known as Hill 223, a detachment of soldiers from the regiment's Company G attempted to infiltrate German lines and capture them. The detachment of 17 had captured a large group of German soldiers when sudden German fire resulted in nine casualties, leaving Corporal Alvin York in charge of the remainder. York left his men in charge of the prisoners and worked his way into position to attack the machine guns. After York killed several German soldiers with his rifle, and used his pistol to kill six more as they rushed at him, their commander offered to surrender. The Company G detachment returned to the regimental command post with 132 prisoners. The regiment was able to continue its attack towards the railroad and York later received the Medal of Honor. During October 9 and 10 the regiment took part in action near the town of Cornay, after which it occupied a position near the town of Pylone. By October 11, the 328th had been reorganized, and moved into defensive positions near Fl\u00e9ville. The 328th continued to fight through the rest of October, primarily near the town of Sommerance. On November 1 and 2, the 328th Infantry moved into Camp de Bouzon near Varennes, where they reorganized before moving out for a French camp, Florent, located near Sainte- Menehould. On November 4, the regiment took over positions in Maxey-sur-Vaise, Montigny-devant-Sassey, and Burey-en-Vaux, where they remained on the defensive, rotated soldiers off the front lines for leave in the rear area, and received replacement soldiers to take the places of the killed and wounded. Between November 10 and 18, the 328th Infantry marched to new positions near Dijon. They were in Neufch\u00e2teau, Vosges on November 11 when they received word of the Armistice that ended the war. ===Return to the United States=== In February 1919, the regiment began its train trip to base camps in western France, where soldiers turned in equipment, completed administrative requirements, and prepared to return to the United States. In early May, the regiment boarded ships for America, including USS Ohioan, Scranton, and Sierra. They arrived in New York Harbor between May 20 and 22, after which they moved to Camp Merritt, New Jersey for demobilization and discharge. By the end of the month, most of the 328th Regiment's members had been discharged and departed for their homes. ===Campaign participation credit=== The 328th Infantry Regiment's World War I campaigns included: *Toul Sector, 25 June-9 August 1918 *Marbache Sector, 17 August-11 September *St. Mihiel Offensive, 12-16 September *Meuse-Argonne Offensive, 6 October-31 October ==Post-World War I== In 1922, the 82nd Division was re-formed as a unit of the Organized Reserve Corps. The 328th Infantry was part of this Reserve formation, and was headquartered in Tampa, Florida. The regiment's 1st Battalion was headquartered in Tampa, 2nd Battalion in West Palm Beach, and 3rd Battalion in Pensacola. 1st Battalion's companies were: Company A (Bartow), Company B (Ocala), Company C (Gainesville), and Company D (Lake City). 2nd Battalion's subordinate units were: Company E (Miami), Company F (Orlando), Company G (Daytona), and Company H (Jacksonville). Companies assigned to 3rd Battalion included: Company I (Chipley), Company K (Blountstown), Company L (Tallahassee), and Company M (Live Oak). During the interwar years, units of the 328th Infantry performed individual training at weeknight and weekend assemblies, and unit training during annual two-week encampments. Training locations included Fort Screven, Georgia, Fort McClellan, Alabama, and several other U.S. Army posts. ==World War II== ===Activation=== The 328th Infantry was called up to active federal service for World War II and assigned as a subordinate unit of the 26th Infantry Division. Colonel William F. Bigelow was assigned as commander and the regiment began training at Fort Jackson, South Carolina in February 1943. Training continued at several locations in the eastern United States until August 1944, to include: Camp Gordon, Georgia; Camp Campbell, Kentucky; 1944\u2019s Tennessee Maneuvers; and Camp Shanks, New York. ===Combat in France=== The regiment departed for France by ship in late August, and disembarked at Utah Beach on September 7 and 8. After remaining in a reserve staging area until early October to complete additional training and receive equipment and supplies, the regiment began combat operations as part of the 26th Infantry Division. The division was assigned to Third U.S. Army, and entered combat near Port-sur-Seille. On October 8, the 328th Infantry augmented the 80th Infantry Division\u2019s attacks on Cl\u00e9mery and nearby B\u00e9nicourt. After a motor march to Bezange-la-Grande, near Nancy, units of the 328th Infantry took part in combat near Vic-sur-Seille, then relieved the 104th Infantry Regiment in defensive positions near the Moncourt Woods. In November, the regiment took part in combat as the Third Army resumed the offensive, taking part in engagements Bezange-la-Petite, the Moncourt woods, and the town of Moncourt, which the 328th Infantry captured from the Germans. In combat near Wuisse on November 12, regimental commander Colonel Ben R. Jacobs was wounded and evacuated. Jacobs returned to the unit on November 18, and the next day it resumed offensive operations, capturing the towns and cities of Kerprich-aux- Bois, Guebestroff, Dieuze, Munster, Givrycourt, Vittersbourg, and Honskirch by November 27. ===Belgium and Luxembourg=== In early December, the 328th Infantry advanced on the Siegfried Line, cleared the woods between Honskirch and Herbitzheim, and captured Herbitzheim.
