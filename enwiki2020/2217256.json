    "text": "The 1888 Northwest Territories general election was the first general election in the history of the Northwest Territories, Canada. Elections were held in various districts between 20 June and 30 June 1888. This was the only general election, where the writs were issued to return on various days. Prior to 1888, members of the 1st Council of the Northwest Territories were elected in by-elections to supplement members appointed by the Government of Canada. In order to have an elected member, a constituency needed to be set up in an area with 1000 people. Others members were appointed. This created a patchwork of represented and unrepresented areas across the sprawling and sparse territory. Twenty-two members were elected in this election. Robert Brett was appointed government leader by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal. His official title was Chairman of the Lt. Governor's Advisory Council. Three judges were appointed to the legislative assembly to provide legal advice, but they were not able to vote. They represented the territory at large. Voters in this election cast their votes by telling the returning officer who they want to vote for. This system lasted until 1894 when a secret ballot was first used in a by-election in the Whitewood district. ==Election results== Three members were acclaimed, but the turnout cannot be established as no voters lists were in use. Candidates were all elected as part of a consensus government. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" !rowspan=\"2\"|Election summary !colspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"2\"|Popular vote |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" |Incumbent |New |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |- |Elected candidates |align=\"right\"|8 |align=\"right\"|11 |align=\"right\"|5,081 |align=\"right\"|62.53% |- |Acclaimed candidates |align=\"right\"|1 |align=\"right\"|2 |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |- |Defeated candidates |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|19 |align=\"right\"|3,045 |align=\"right\"|37.47% |- |Total |colspan=\"2\" align=\"center\"|41 |align=\"center\"|8,126 |align=\"center\"|100% |- |} ==Legal Advisors== {| border=\"1\" align=\"right\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" |align=center|Legal Advisors |- |James Macleod |- |Hugh Richardson |- |Charles Rouleau |} Three Members were appointed by Lieutenant Governor Joseph Royal after the election. The purpose was to bring experience in procedure, protocol and amending and introducing legislation. The Legal Advisors held seats at large, were allowed to participate in debates and were paid a salary of $250.00. The three members of the assembly who were appointed, already served as members of the Assembly previously. There were no Legal Advisors reappointed after dissolution of the 1st North-West Legislative Assembly in 1891. ==Members of the Legislative Assembly elected== Results of Calgary and Red Deer, as published in the Calgary Tribune For complete electoral history, see individual districts {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse\" |colspan=\"4\"|1st North-West Legislative Assembly elected |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" !|District !|Member |- |Batoche |Hilliard Mitchell |- |Battleford |James Clinkskill |- |Calgary #1 |John Lineham |- |Calgary #2 |Hugh Cayley |- |Edmonton #1 |Herbert Charles Wilson |- |Edmonton #2 |Frank Oliver |- |Kinistino |James Hoey |- |Macleod |Frederick Haultain |- |Medicine Hat |Thomas Tweed |- |Moose Jaw |James Hamilton Ross |- |Moosomin |John Ryerson Neff |- |North Qu'Appelle |William Sutherland |- |North Regina |David Jelly |- |Prince Albert #1 |William Plaxton |- |Prince Albert #2 |John Betts |- |Red Deer |Robert Brett |- |Souris |John Gillanders Turriff |- |South Qu'Appelle |George Davidson |- |South Regina |John Secord |- |Wallace |Joel Reaman |- |Whitewood |Alexander Thorburn |- |Wolseley |Benjamin Parkyn Richardson |} ==Medicine Hat== In the Medicine Hat electoral district, candidate William Finlay had withdrawn before election day.
