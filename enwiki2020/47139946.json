It was previously known as Al Duhail South, or alternatively, South Duhail. ==Etymology== In Arabic, \"umm\" literally means mother, but in this context is used as a prefix for specific geographic features. The second portion of the name, \"lekhba\", originates from the Arabic word \"khabaa\", which is translated as \"to hide\". This name was given in reference to the fact that the area is relatively discreet since it lies in a depression. ==Landmarks== Aerial view of Umm Lekhba overlooking Tawar Mall *Mercedes-Benz, Nasser Bin Khaled Autombiles on Al Uqouriyat Street. *Hamad Medical Corporation Ambulance Service HQ on Al Markhiya Street. *Tawar Mall on Al Markhiya Street opened in 2018 and covers an area of roughly 90,000 square meters. *Shafallah Centre For Children With Special Needs on Zaid Bin Muhajer Street. ==Transport== Major roads that run through the district are Al Markhiya Street, Al Khafji Street, and Al Shamal Road. ==Demographics== As of the 2010 census, the district comprised 1,540 housing units and 331 establishments.
