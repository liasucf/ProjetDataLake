Beno\u00eet-Constant Coquelin (; 23 January 184127 January 1909), known as Coquelin a\u00een\u00e9 (\"Coquelin the Elder\"), was a French actor, \"one of the greatest theatrical figures of the age.\" ==Biography== Coquelin was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, Pas-de-Calais. He was originally intended to follow his father's trade of baker (he was once called \"un boulanger manqu\u00e9\" \u2013 \"a failed baker\" \u2013 by a hostile critic), but his love of acting led him to the Conservatoire, where he entered R\u00e9gnier's class in 1859. He won the first prize for comedy within a year, and made his d\u00e9but on 7 December 1860 at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise as the comic valet, Gros-Ren\u00e9, in Moli\u00e8re's Le D\u00e9pit amoureux, but his first great success was as Figaro in The Barber of Seville, in the following year. It was an honour for Coquelin to be a part of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise at such a young age. This company had already been in existence for around 150 years. He was made soci\u00e9taire in 1864. There were 21 shares and they were divided among the lead actors, known as soci\u00e9taires. The soci\u00e9taires co-manage, choose plays, and share profits. When there was an opening caused by retirement, resignation, or death, it was filled by a member of the pensionnaires. And just four years after joining the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, Coquelin became one of the elite soci\u00e9taires. During the next twenty-two years he created at the Com\u00e9die Fran\u00e7aise the leading parts in forty-four new plays, including Th\u00e9odore de Banville's Gringoire (1867), Paul Ferrier's Tabarin (1871), \u00c9mile Augier's Paul Forestier (1871), L'\u00c9trang\u00e8re (1876) by the younger Dumas, Charles Lomon's Jean Dacier (1877), \u00c9douard Pailleron's Le Monde o\u00f9 l'on s'ennuie (1881), Erckmann's and Chatrian's Les Rantzau (1884). In consequence of a dispute with the authorities over the question of his right to make provincial tours in France he resigned in 1886. Three years later, however, the breach was healed; and after a successful series of tours in Europe and the United States he rejoined the Com\u00e9die- Fran\u00e7aise as pensionnaire in 1890. During his time away from the Com\u00e9die he wrote his book Art and the Actor. It was during this period that he took the part of Labussi\u00e8re, in the production of Victorien Sardou's Thermidor, which was banned by the government after three performances. In 1892 he broke definitely with the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise, and toured for some time through the capitals of Europe with a company of his own; in New York, for instance, he performed at Abbey's Theatre in 1894, playing the lead in Tartuffe (his son Jean played Orgon) and Mascarille in Les Pr\u00e9cieuses ridicules. In 1895 he joined the Renaissance theatre in Paris, and played there until he became director of the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de la Porte Saint-Martin in 1897. Here he won successes in Edmond Rostand's Cyrano de Bergerac (1897), which he repeated in the summer of 1898 at the Lyceum Theatre, London, \u00c9mile Bergerat's Plus que reine (1899), Catulle Mend\u00e8s's Scarron (1905), and Alfred Capus and Lucien Descaves' L'Attentat (1906). In 1900 Coquelin toured in America with Sarah Bernhardt, appeared at Broadway's Garden Theatre in a production of Cyrano de Bergerac (Bernhardt played Roxane). He made his only film, the duel scene from Cyrano de Bergerac with sound recording on phonograph cylinder (see also Sound film/Early steps). The film is thought to be the first ever made with both color and sound. On their return to France he continued with his old colleague to appear in L'Aiglon, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Sarah Bernhardt. He was rehearsing for the creation of the leading part in Rostand's Chantecler, which he was to produce, when he died suddenly in Paris in 1909. The New York Times printed an obituary, in which it described many tributes to the dead actor, including a visit by the personal secretary of the President of the Republic, Armand Falli\u00e8res. Coquelin was an Officier de l'Instruction Publique and of the Legion of Honour. He published: * L'Art et le com\u00e9dien (1880) * Moli\u00e8re et le misanthrope (1881) * essay on Eug\u00e8ne Manuel (1881) * essay on Sully Prudhomme (1882) * L'Arnolphe de Moli\u00e8re (1882) * Les Com\u00e9diens (1882) * L'Art de dire le monologue (with his brother, 1884) * Tartuffe (1884) * L'Art du com\u00e9dien (1894) His brother, Ernest, and his son, Jean, were also actors. ==Gallery== Bemberg Fondation Toulouse - L'acteur Coquelin a\u00een\u00e9 accoud\u00e9 - Jean B\u00e9raud.jpg|Portrait by Jean B\u00e9raud Coquelin ain\u00e9.jpg|As Cyrano 1898 Cyrano de Bergerac (1900).webm|Cyrano de Bergerac (1900) Benoit Constant Coquelin.jpg|Coquelin photographed by the American Napoleon Sarony c.1888.
