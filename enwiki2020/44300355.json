    "text": "The Mexican Honors system consists of civil orders, decorations and medals that are conferred on citizens and foreigners in recognition of their services and achievements. Although the indigenous empires that made up modern Mexico had their own way of recognizing individuals, the current system traces its roots from colonial New Spain, and has evolved because of events since the country's independence. The following is a partial list of the orders, awards and prizes that have been or are currently issued as state decorations by the Government of Mexico. ==Mexican Empire== ===First Empire (1822-1823)=== * Order of Guadalupe (first version) ===Second Empire (1864-1867)=== * Order of Guadalupe (renewed version) * Order of the Mexican Eagle * Imperial Order of Saint Charles ==United Mexican States== ===Current Honors=== According to the Law on Prizes, Stimuli and Civil Rewards,LEY DE PREMIOS, EST\u00cdMULOS Y RECOMPENSAS CIVILES Mexico's highest award for its own citizens is the Condecoraci\u00f3n Miguel Hidalgo.
