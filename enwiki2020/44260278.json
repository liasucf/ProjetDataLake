The story, written by Ron Burch, David Kidd and Don Rhymer, follows a gentle pacifist bull named Ferdinand who refuses to participate in bullfighting but is forced back into the arena where his beliefs are challenged by being faced off against the world's greatest bullfighter. Ferdinand premiered on December 10, 2017 in Los Angeles, and was theatrically released in the United States on December 15, 2017 in 3D and 2D formats. It grossed $296 million worldwide against a production budget of $111 million. Ferdinand received a nomination for Best Animated Feature at the 90th Academy Awards (losing against Coco) while also receiving nominations for Best Animated Feature Film (also lost against Coco) and Best Original Song (\"Home\") at the 75th Golden Globe Awards (losing against This Is Me). It was the last 20th Century Fox animated film to be released before the Disney acquisition, as well as the last Blue Sky Studios film to be released before the Disney acquisition. ==Plot== In Spain, a friendly, non-violent, flower-loving young cow named Ferdinand (Colin H. Murphy) lives on Casa del Toro, a ranch that raises and trains bulls for bullfighting. He is ridiculed by Bones (Nile Diaz), Guapo (Jet Jurgensmeyer), and Valiente (Jack Gore) due to his pacifism and interest in flowers. Not willing to be raised as a violent bull that will one day be forced to fight against matadors in the bull ring, Ferdinand runs away from Casa del Toro after his father Raf (Jeremy Sisto) fails to return from a bullfight and his favorite flower is squished by Valiente and his father (Bobby Cannavale). He arrives at a peaceful farm run by a florist named Juan (Juanes) and bonds with his daughter Nina (Julia Scarpa Saldanha), much to his dog Paco's (Jerrod Carmichael) jealousy. Ferdinand lives happily on Juan's farm, where he spends every day smelling the flowers and relaxing in the shade until he grows up into an enormous bull. One day when Ferdinand (John Cena) is all grown up, Ferdinand is left alone when Juan, Nina (Lily Day) and Paco go to Ronda for an annual flower festival. Ferdinand follows anyway, but is stung by a bee on the butt and unintentionally causes chaos around town. Believed to be an aggressive, violent, short-tempered bull, Ferdinand taken to back Casa del Toro, saddening Nina. Ferdinand reunites with his childhood bullies, Bones (Anthony Anderson), Guapo (Peyton Manning), and Valiente (Bobby Cannavale) and discovers that they\u2019re all grown up and are joined by two new bulls named Angus (David Tennant) and Maquina (Tim Nordquist). Still ridiculed by Bones, Guapo, and Valiente, Ferdinand befriends Lupe (Kate McKinnon), a goat who wants to coach him in bullfighting. Legendary bullfighter El Primero (Miguel \u00c1ngel Silvestre) arrives to choose the biggest, strongest, most aggressive bull to fight before he retires. Failing to impress the matador, the bulls turn on Ferdinand for making them look bad and blocking the entrance to the ring. Guapo is taken to a slaughterhouse, which Valiente and Bones tell Ferdinand will be their fate if they are not chosen for a bullfight. Ferdinand earns the bulls\u2019 respect except Valiente after a dance-off with German horses (Hans Flula Borg, Klaus Boris Kodjoe, and Greta Sally Phillips), but they still believe fighting is their only way to survive. Ferdinand convinces Lupe to escape with him to Nina's farm, aided by a trio of hedgehogs named Una (Gina Rodriguez), Dos (Daveed Diggs), and Cuatro (Gabriel Iglesias). Close to freedom, Ferdinand sees his father\u2019s horns mounted on a wall with dozens of others, and realizes that every bull chosen to fight is slain by the matador. Ferdinand warns the other bulls, but Valiente is unconvinced and charges him outside. Primero witnesses Valiente making Ferdinand inadvertently defeat him by breaking off his horn, and chooses Ferdinand to fight. When Valiente is taken to the slaughterhouse, Ferdinand rallies the remaining bulls to escape, and goes to the slaughterhouse to rescue him. They discover Guapo is still alive, and Ferdinand questions Valiente's courage after he refuses to help rescue him. Ferdinand's tail accidentally activates a series of deadly contraptions, but escapes with Valiente's help. The bulls, hedgehogs and Lupe steal Casa del Toro's truck, and escape the ranch\u2019s owner, Moreno (Ra\u00fal Esparza), and his employees. The animals arrive at Atocha train station in Madrid. When the bulls push a small railroad cart to catch the train back to Nina's home, Ferdinand sacrifices himself so the others can escape. Lupe stays behind as Ferdinand is captured. News of the runaway bulls causing chaos around town, Ferdinand's upcoming fight with Primero reaches Nina, and she and Juan set out to rescue the bull. At Las Ventas arena, Lupe urges Ferdinand to fight in order to survive, but Ferdinand is silently unsure. Released into the ring, he gives a weak performance and accidentally sends El Primero flying into the bull pen. Primero attacks Ferdinand with banderillas, scratching him in the shoulder. Ferdinand almost retaliates, but sees a carnation crushed under his hoof; unwilling to resort to violence, he lets Primero live. Ferdinand resigns himself to being slain by the matador, but the crowd cries out for him to live. Primero spares Ferdinand and leaves with dignity, and Ferdinand is reunited with Nina, as the crowd throws carnations into the ring to praise the bull. Ferdinand returns home with Nina, Juan and Paco, joined by Lupe, the three hedgehogs, and the rest of the bulls, as well as a bunny that Ferdinand almost crushed during the second day of training. In a mid credits scene, Una, Dos and Cuatro are reunited with Tres, much to their dismay. ==Cast== *John Cena as Ferdinand the Bull, a huge flower-loving bull who does not want to fight. **Colin H.

Audience polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\" on an A+ to F scale. Spanish bullfighting critic of El Pa\u00eds, Antonio Lorca, in a critique of the film said that the film's message is \"profoundly unnatural\", and that the \"renunciation\" of the lead character to its \"animal nature\" is a lie that manipulates children, who will become \"tomorrow's anti-bullfighters\". El Diario.es commented on this article by Lorca, saying that it had been widely commented on social networks and that the anti-bullfighting narrative of the film \"raised hackles\" for its message against animal abuse, which can also be interpreted as \"fight against school bullying\" and \"implicit defense of sexual and gender diversity\". Ben Kenigsberg of The New York Times gave the film a positive review, saying, \"Unlike in the book, Ferdinand earns the arena\u2019s cheers for not fighting, but the crowd\u2019s sense of surprise will elude audiences attending Ferdinand.\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/movies/ferdinand-review.amp.html Susan Wloszczyna of Rogerebert.com gave the film a three out of four stars and said, \"Enough of that kind of bull. What the world needs now is Ferdinand, sweet Ferdinand, a rare breed of bovine who takes a stand against aggression, competitive rivalry and conforming to the expectations of others.\"https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/ferdinand-2017 James Dyer of Empire Magazine gave the film a three out of five stars, saying, \"Inoffensive fun, but unlike its paperback forbear, the cinematic Ferdinand is unlikely to stand the test of time.\"https://www.empireonline.com/movies/reviews/ferdinand- review/ Simran Hans of The Guardian gave the film a four out of five stars and said, \"A flower-sniffing bull goes on a journey of self-discovery in this fun adaptation of a 30s children\u2019s book.\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/17/ferdinand-review-kate- mckinnon Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter also gave a positive review for the film, saying, \"It\u2019s no Coco, but Ferdinand, a CG-animated adaptation of the classic 1936 Munro Leaf and Robert Lawson book about a flower-loving bull who\u2019d rather sniff than fight, manages to squeak by with enough charming set-pieces and amusing sight gags to compensate for a stalling storyline.\"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/amp/review/ferdinand- review-1065283 Katie Welsh of Chicago Tribune gave the film a negative review of two stars, saying, \"With a lovely voice performance from Cena, the spirit of Ferdinand does shine through. But the rest of the story filler is mostly forgettable.\"https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov- ferdinand-rev-1213-20171213-story.html%3foutputType=amp Tara Brady of The Irish Times also gave the film a three out of five stars, saying, \"Ferdinand may lack the all-out charm offensive of the studio\u2019s 2015 Snoopy and Charlie Brown vehicle, but it\u2019s not too far off in terms of quality and sweetness.\"https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/film/ferdinand-review-a- children-s-classic-gets-the-family-film-treatment-1.3324803?mode=amp ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width: 99%;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Recipient(s) and nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- | Academy Awards | March 4, 2018 | Best Animated Feature | Carlos Saldanha and Lori Forte | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Annie Awards | rowspan=\"2\"| February 3, 2018 | Design in an Animated Feature Production | Thomas Cardone Arden Chan Andrew Hickson Mike Lee Jason Sadler | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Editorial in an Animated Feature Production | Harry Hitner Tim Nordquist | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| Golden Globe Awards | rowspan=\"2\"| January 7, 2018 | Best Animated Feature Film | Carlos Saldanha | | rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | Best Original Song | \"Home\" | |- | Cinema Audio Society Awards | February 24th 2018 | Outstanding Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Motion Picture \u2013 Animated | Bill Higley, Randy Thom, Lora Hirschberg, Leff Lefferts, Shawn Murphy and Scott Curtis | | style=\"text- align:center;\"| |- | Guild of Music Supervisors Awards | February 8, 2018 | Best Song/Recording Created for a Film | \"Home\" | |style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | Humanitas Prize | February 16, 2018 | Feature \u2013 Family | Ron Burch & David Kidd, Don Rhymer, Robert L.
