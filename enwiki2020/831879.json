He was a guest host on Dying Scene Radio episode 017. ==SXSW Incident== On Friday, March 18, 2011 at Austin, TX's SXSW Festival, Foster was involved in an altercation with two women during a Screeching Weasel performance. The first woman threw ice cubes at Foster. Upon being hit with more ice Foster found an unruly woman was the source of the ice. Foster originally stated he \"can't kick a girl's ass\" and offered money for another woman to handle the attacker. As the ice and spitting continued Foster threatened to beat the woman up himself. The woman then threw beer at Foster, who responded by attacking her. A club owner, also female, then came on stage and grabbed Foster. He pushed her and punched her before being pulled to the other side of the stage by a bouncer. On March 20, Foster posted an apology on his website BenWeasel.com stating Following the incident, several bands who were slated to appear at Weasel Fest in Chicago dropped out, including Chinese Telephones, Chixdiggit, The Soviettes, Teenage Bottlerocket and Kepi Ghoulie. On March 23, 2011 the other four members of Screeching Weasel all resigned from the band citing the SXSW incident as the reason. On March 31 it was announced that the entire Weasel Fest had been cancelled. In August, Weasel issued a full article on Screeching Weasel's website describing his whole point of view on the situation. ==Personal life== On November 30, 2010, Foster appeared on Last Call with Carson Daly and revealed that he suffers from anxiety, panic attacks, and bouts of agoraphobia.
