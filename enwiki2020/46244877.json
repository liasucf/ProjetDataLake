    "text": "The Peter Smyth House is a historic house at 1629 Crossover Street in Fayetteville, Arkansas. Built in 1886, it is a regionally rare example of a small stone cottage built in a traditional central hall plan. The house is built out of coursed sandstone, and has finely-chiseled lintels and sills for the openings. The front facade is five bays wide, with a center entry flanked by four sash windows. There two chimneys just inside the outer side walls at the peak of the side gable roof. A stone ell of antiquity similar to that of the house is attached to the rear; it is uncertain whether it was built as an integral part of the house, or added later. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Greek Revival houses in Arkansas Category:Houses completed in 1886 Category:Houses in Fayetteville, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fayetteville, Arkansas ",
