The film was released on June 16, 2017 by Saban Films. ==Plot== Sometime in the near future, physicist and former NASA pilot Will Porter is recruited by Alterplex, a power company that has built a massive tower that taps into unlimited quantum energy. It is revealed that it is destroying a mirror universe Earth referred to as \"The Echo\" and that the inhabitants there also have an energy tower. Strange gravity anomalies and unexplained deaths are occurring in The Echo world that are blamed on the tower, as it takes energy from that world. There was supposed to be no life there but due to a malfunction, the device created a true mirror Earth full of life, and now both Earths face destruction unless one is destroyed within less than a day. Porter has been sent to The Echo with a cube device called the \"Redivider\" believing it will balance the power transfer between the two universes and set things right. Instead, he learns the device is a kill switch that will destroy The Echo forcing him to decide which universe to sacrifice in order to save the other. The armies in The Echo know this and are trying to arrest or kill him. There is also a group of \"anti-tower rebels\" who are actively fighting the armed forces of the towers. ==Cast== * Dan Stevens as Will Porter * B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe as Abigail Vos * Tygo Gernandt as Michael * Charity Wakefield as Mia Porter * Bas Keijzer as Bektman * Mike Libanon as Hugo * Mike Reus as Dr. Klintsen ==Production== In February 2016, it was announced Dan Stevens and B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Marlohe had been cast in the film, with Tim Smit directing the film, from a screenplay by Charlie Kindinger and Omid Nooshin.
