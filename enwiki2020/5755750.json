    "text": "Michael McGlynn (born 11 May 1964) is an Irish composer, producer, director, and founder of the vocal ensemble An\u00fana. ==Career== McGlynn was born in Dublin and attended Col\u00e1iste na RinneThe Journal of Music in Ireland (Jan./Feb. 2002). and Blackrock College. He was a student of Music and English at University College Dublin and Trinity College where he studied for an M.Litt degree. He was a member of the RT\u00c9 Chamber Choir and in 1987 he founded the Irish choral group An\u00fana (originally spelt \"An Ua\u00edthne\").Axel Klein: \"Die Musik Irlands im 20. Jahrhundert\" (Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1996), p. 430. An\u00fana have released fourteen albums, almost exclusively featuring his arrangements and original works. Deep Dead Blue was nominated for a Classical Brit Award in 2000 and went Top 5 in the UK Classical Charts. An\u00fana: Celtic Origins was the biggest selling world music CD in the US in August 2007 according to Nielsen Soundscan , and remained in the top twenty albums of the Billboard World Music Charts until early 2008. Although best known as a writer of choral music, McGlynn has written orchestral and instrumental works as well as cantatas and masses. 2007 saw the premiere of the cantata St. Francis commissioned by RT\u00c9, the Irish National broadcasting station. It is a setting of texts associated with Francis of Assisi for tenor, choir and symphony orchestra. The album Behind the Closed Eye is a collaboration with the Ulster Orchestra, Northern Ireland's premiere orchestra. McGlynn has written music for theatre, including the Adrian Noble/Cusack family production of Anton Chekhov's \"Three Sisters\" at the Gate Theatre, Dublin, and the Royal Court, London. He is also a vocal and choral clinician, working recently in the University of Miami (US), Sumida Hall (Japan) and Festival 500 in Newfoundland (Canada). He was an Eminent Scholar at Florida Atlantic University for the 2011\u201312 academic year.Contemporary Music Centre, Ireland website In 2017 he was awarded the University College Dublin Alumni Award for Arts and Humanities.University College Dublin Alumni Awards 2017 . McGlynn will be the Artistic Director of the 2021 Tampere Vocal Music Festival in Finland.Tampere Vocal Music Festival New Artistic Director . McGlynn's music has been recorded and performed by such internationally recognised performers and ensembles as Rajaton, Dawn Upshaw, the National Youth Choir of Great Britain, The Dale Warland Singers, the Phoenix Chorale [formerly the Phoenix Bach Choir], Conspirare, the BBC Singers and Chanticleer. ==Musical language== McGlynn's harmonic language combines elements of traditional Irish music such as modal melodic lines and ornamentation, fixed and shifting drones and liberal use of jazz-tinged chordal clusters and sonorities. These features can be heard in his contribution to the Chanticleer-commissioned And on Earth Peace: A Chanticleer Mass. McGlynn contributed the 'Agnus Dei' to this multi-composer work.Gramophone Magazine McGlynn says \"One of the misapprehensions about my music is that I am not actually concerned with saving Irish traditional music; I am not a traditionalist. The only exposure I had [to traditional Irish song] was during my year at Col\u00e1iste na Rinne in D\u00fan Garbh\u00e1n. The songs that I set are not from a specific collection; they are more impressions of the songs I remembered.\"Stacie Lee Rossow: The Choral Music of Irish Composer Michael McGlynn (2010): . McGlynn also created new compositions that could be perceived as arrangements of Irish songs but were, in fact, new melodies composed to traditional texts. He has stated that \"People just assume that I have just found a 'living' version. In fact I have done what has made solo traditional music so viable: I have created a new version. I take the songs and reinterpret them in a new way. My priority is always to create a choral version that works.\" His most successful choral work in this genre is \"D\u00falam\u00e1n\", a setting of the traditional Irish poem of the same name. This work has been performed and recorded extensively by professional choral groups such as Chanticleer and Cantus. It features another characteristic aspect of his musical language in its use of multiple alternating rhythms. Karen Marrolli for her 2010 thesis on McGlynn writes: \"Throughout all of McGlynn's work, while there are a good amount of compositional thumbprints and overarching characteristics, there also is a great deal of variety. This is an incredibly refreshing aspect to McGlynn's choral writing. Various constant influences are present in his music and give his canon a sense of identity; however, he does not simply reconstruct successful pieces over and over again in an attempt to rest on his laurels. His body of work displays a great range of techniques and musical ideas and continues to develop and mature. Further study of some of his more recently recorded works, such as O Maria and the brilliant work Victimae (both released on the 2009 An\u00fana CD Sanctus) would reveal how his musical influences factor into his compositional efforts in ever-evolving ways. This continuous growth bodes well for the longevity of this composer as he takes his place among the important composers of our time.An Overview of the Choral Music of Michael McGlynn with a Conductor's Preparatory Guide to His Celtic Mass (2010) ==Selected works== A selection of McGlynn's original works:Rossow, Stacie Lee, \"The Choral Music of Irish Composer Michael McGlynn\": * Invocation (Tenor & mixed-chorus) * Four Tenebrae Responsories (Tenebrae I, II, III & IV.
