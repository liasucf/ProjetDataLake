    "text": "Axelopran (INN, USAN) (developmental code name TD-1211) is a drug which is under development by Theravance Biopharma for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation. It acts as a peripherally acting \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist and also acts on \u03ba-, and \u03b4-opioid receptors, with similar affinity for the \u03bc- and \u03ba-opioid receptors and about an order of magnitude lower affinity for the \u03b4-opioid receptor. Axelopran has potent \u03bc-opioid receptor antagonist activity on the gastrointestinal tract in vivo, and thus it produces a dose-dependent inhibition of opioid-induced delaying in gastric emptying in mice and rats following subcutaneous or oral administration., Axelopran (td-1211) briefing document anesthetic and analgesic drug products advisory committee June 11 and 12, 2014. ==See also== * Bevenopran * Eluxadoline * Methylnaltrexone * Naldemedine ==References== Category:Drugs acting on the gastrointestinal system and metabolism Category:Kappa antagonists Category:Laxatives Category:Opioid antagonists ",
