    "text": "D\u01b0\u01a1ng Thu H\u01b0\u01a1ng (born 1947) is a Vietnamese author and political dissident. Formerly a member of Vietnam's Communist party, she was expelled from the party in 1989, and has been denied the right to travel abroad, and was temporarily imprisoned for her writings and outspoken criticism of corruption in the Vietnamese government. == Early life == Born in 1947 in Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh a province in northern Vietnam, D\u01b0\u01a1ng came of age just as the Vietnam War was turning violent. At the age of twenty, when she was a student at Vietnamese Ministry of Culture\u2019s Arts College, D\u01b0\u01a1ng Thu H\u01b0\u01a1ng volunteered to serve in a women\u2019s youth brigade on the front lines of \"The War Against the Americans\". D\u01b0\u01a1ng spent the next seven years of the war in the jungles and tunnels of B\u00ecnh Tr\u1ecb Thi\u00ean, the most heavily bombarded region of the war. Her mission was to \"sing louder than the bombs\" and to give theatrical performances for the North Vietnamese troops, but also to tend to the wounded, bury the dead, and accompany the soldiers along. She was one of three survivors out of the forty volunteers in that group. She was also at the front during China\u2019s attacks on Vietnam in 1979 during the short-lived Sino-Vietnamese War. However, in the period after Vietnam\u2019s reunification in 1975, D\u01b0\u01a1ng became increasingly outspoken and critical about the repressive atmosphere created by the Communist government. Upon seeing the conditions in the South \u2013 compared with the North \u2013 she began speaking out against the communist government. == Writings == Her first novels, Journey in Childhood (H\u00e0nh tr\u00ecnh ng\u00e0y th\u01a1 \u1ea5u, 1985), Beyond Illusions (B\u00ean kia b\u1edd \u1ea3o v\u1ecdng, 1987),Beyond Illusions Paperback \u2013 January 3, 2003 Paradise of the Blind (Nh\u1eefng thi\u00ean \u0111\u01b0\u1eddng m\u00f9, 1988)Paradise of the Blind: A novel Paperback \u2013 July 1, 1994 and The Lost Life (Qu\u00e3ng \u0111\u1eddi \u0111\u00e1nh m\u1ea5t, 1989) were published in her native Vietnam and soon became bestsellers in Vietnam before they were banned. The third one was also the first Vietnamese novel ever published in the United States in English.VIETNAMESE Her next three books \u2014 Novel Without a Name (Ti\u1ec3u thuy\u1ebft v\u00f4 \u0111\u1ec1, 1991),Novel without a Name Paperback \u2013 June 1, 1996 Memories of a Pure Spring (2000), Paperback \u2013 January 1, 2001 and No Man's Land (Ch\u1ed1n v\u1eafng, 2002)No Man's Land Hardcover \u2013 April 13, 2005 \u2014 have not been published in the United States. She was made a Chevalier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government (1994).Duong Thu Huong at PEN She earlier wrote a number of short stories and screenplays. One story, \"Reflections of Spring,\" was translated by Linh Dinh and included in the anthology, Night, Again: Contemporary Fiction from Vietnam (Seven Stories Press 2006). The latest novel No Man's Land (Terre des oublis in French, which won the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle (2007)), perhaps her most successful, was in the final list of the prize Femina 2006 and received the Grand prix des lectrices de Elle in 2007. == Political fallout == D\u01b0\u01a1ng has been labeled as a \"dissident writer\" and been expelled by Vietnam\u2019s Communist party and was imprisoned for a short time in 1991 for remarks criticizing the goals and interests of the party and its members. This is not unusual in contemporary Vietnam; Linh Dinh, in his introduction to the collection Night, Again, details the government\u2019s extreme response to certain subjects in writing \u2013 for example, in 1956, the poet Tran Dan was arrested for capitalizing \"He\" in a brief passage of a poem cataloging social despair, since such a designation was reserved for Ho Chi Minh. In 1991, Le Minh Khue was still criticized for having a North Vietnamese female soldier daydream about the smile of a handsome South Vietnamese prisoner of war. Though she was one of Vietnam\u2019s most popular writers, most of her fiction is published outside of Vietnam due to both the censorship and the government\u2019s monopoly of the publishing industry. Recently, she has retired and earns a pension of approximately twenty U.S. dollars per month and must earn her living working as a translator and trying to publish her novels and short stories abroad. She believes in struggling to gain democracy; while unable to run for political office or organize a competing party, she now uses writing in order to articulate that message. In her story \"The Story of an Actress,\" D\u01b0\u01a1ng combines her passionate beliefs about human freedom with her existentialist literary sensibilities. B\u00ea and Thom live next door to one another and become best friends; while B\u00ea is intelligent and fun-loving, Thom develops into the town beauty. Thom ends up marrying the most famous theater director in Vietnam, a man 40 years her senior, in an attempt to become an actress; B\u00ea visits her and watches her life disintegrate as she works toward her degree and her own life dream. On the surface, it seems to be a relatively simple story about two girls growing up and choosing different paths in life. But her language and details betray, as with Ho Xuan Huong, a deeper level to a simple story. She is critiquing a contemporary society where beauty is prized over intellect and money over kindness, and calling attention to how the optimism of youth, when it fades, can be so devastating that it drives people to despair. According to D\u01b0\u01a1ng, most writers must learn how to voice their individual concerns within a group mentality. In other words, their writing must reflect the individual and the masses at large in a way that's approved by the party; D\u01b0\u01a1ng finds that most writers in contemporary Vietnam get caught up in the group thinking mentality. D\u01b0\u01a1ng has felt the effects of censorship perhaps more cruelly than many of her fellow writers. Her work is not contained in any Vietnamese anthologies or collections. Though she has achieved success and renown abroad for her novels through translation, the audience she is writing for in Vietnam, that would most understand the minutiae of her stories, does not often have the opportunity to read her work, except when it is smuggled into Vietnam. Nevertheless, D\u01b0\u01a1ng is hopeful for the future of writing in her country. She is counting on the fact that at some point, the people will open their eyes to see what's going on in her homeland. D\u01b0\u01a1ng moved to Paris in 2006. In January 2009, her latest novel, \u0110\u1ec9nh Cao Ch\u00f3i L\u1ecdi, was published; it was also translated into French as Au z\u00e9nith. ==Awards and honors== *2001: Prince Claus Award *2005: Oxfam Novib/PEN Award * 2007: Grand prix des lectrices de Elle ==List of works translated into English== * Beyond Illusions (1987) *Paradise of the Blind (1988) * Novel Without A Name (1995) * Memories of a Pure Spring (1996) * No Man's Land (2002) * The Zenith (2009) == References == == External links == *Review of No Man's Land in January magazine *Duong Thu Huong /Banned Books *A discourse shaped by the Vietnam War D\u01b0\u01a1ng Thu H\u01b0\u01a1ng in France By Alan Riding(International Herald Tribune Published: FRIDAY, JULY 15, 2005) *D\u01b0\u01a1ng Thu H\u01b0\u01a1ng entry on Wikivietlit *Beyond Illusions, translated from B\u00ean kia b\u1edd \u1ea3o v\u1ecdng *Novel without a Name, translated from Ti\u1ec3u thuy\u1ebft v\u00f4 \u0111\u1ec1 * Review of Memories of a Pure Spring Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Vietnamese novelists Category:Vietnamese women writers Category:Vietnamese dissidents Category:People from Th\u00e1i B\u00ecnh Province Category:North Vietnamese military personnel of the Vietnam War Category:Chevaliers of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres Category:Communist Party of Vietnam politicians Category:Vietnamese women in politics Category:French people of Vietnamese descent Category:Women in war in Vietnam Category:Women in warfare post-1945 Category:Women novelists Category:Communist women writers Category:People's Liberation Army in fiction ",
