    "text": "Disappearance at Clifton Hill (initially known as Clifton Hill) is a 2019 Canadian thriller film, directed by Albert Shin. The film stars Tuppence Middleton as Abby, a young woman who returns home to Niagara Falls, Ontario, when she inherits a family-owned motel in the city's Clifton Hill tourist district following her mother's death, and becomes obsessed with reconstructing inchoate childhood memories of witnessing a kidnapping. The film's cast also includes Hannah Gross, Marie-Jos\u00e9e Croze, Andy McQueen, Noah Reid, Dan Lett, Aaron Poole, Connor Jessup, Elizabeth Saunders, and Maxwell McCabe-Lokos, as well as filmmaker David Cronenberg in a rare acting appearance as a local historian and podcaster. The film was nominated for four Canadian Screen Award nominations, including Best Supporting Actor for McQueen. ==Production== The film was based in part on Shin's own life; his parents formerly owned a motel in Niagara Falls, where Shin has childhood memories of witnessing what he understood at the time to be a kidnapping. However, during the making of the film, he faced resistance from the Clifton Hill business improvement association, because the organization feared that the film would paint the city and the district in a negative light. ==Release== The film premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival under the title Clifton Hill. IFC Midnight obtained the U.S. distribution rights to the film and will release it on February 28, 2020. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Date of ceremony ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"4\" |Canadian Screen Awards | rowspan=\"4\" |28 May 2020 | Best Cinematography | data-sort-value=\"Lutes, Catherine\" | Catherine Lutes | | rowspan=\"3\" | |- | Best Editing | data-sort-value=\"McLauchlin, Cam\" | Cam McLauchlin | |- | Best Sound Editing | data-sort-value=\"Germann, Paul\" | Paul Germann, Claire Dobson, John Sievert, Jason Charbonneau and Randy Wilson | |- |Best Supporting Actor | data-sort-value=\"McQueen, Andy\" | Andy McQueen | | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" |Directors Guild of Canada | rowspan=\"2\" |26 October 2019 | Outstanding Picture Editing \u2013 Feature Film | data-sort- value=\"McLauchlin, Cam\" | Cam McLauchlin | | |- | Outstanding Production Design \u2013 Feature Film | data-sort-value=\"Crane, Chris\" | Chris Crane | | |- !scope=\"row\" | Vancouver Film Critics Circle | 16 December 2019 | Best Supporting Actor in a Canadian Film | data-sort-value=\"Cronenberg, David\" | David Cronenberg | | |- |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2019 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian thriller films Category:Niagara Falls in fiction Category:Films directed by Albert Shin ",
