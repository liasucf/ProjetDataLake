    "text": "The GE B36-7 is a 4-axle road switcher diesel-electric locomotive built by GE Transportation Systems between 1980 and 1985. 222 examples of this locomotive were built for North American railroads and eight units were built for a Colombian coal mining operation. The units were designed as successors to GE's U36B's. Of the 230 locomotives built, 180 of them were built for two Eastern railroads - Seaboard System Railroad (which became part of CSX Transportation in 1986) and Conrail. These 4-axle locomotives were powerful ones when introduced in 1980. When first built the units were rated at , later versions were rated at . They were designed for fast and priority service, moving intermodal and container trains. == Introduction == The first B36-7s were built for the Cotton Belt in January 1980. These first four units #7770-7773 were part of a thirty unit order that included 26 B30-7 units. According to Extra 2200 South magazine these units featured General Electric's new Sentry Adhesion System. The Sentry System is a wheel slip detection system. These 3600 horsepower units also featured the new GE 752AF traction motor, the new GTA-24 traction alternator and the 83:20 fine tooth gearing. Conrail B36-7 5054 leads a Freight train at Duncannon, PA The second order for B36-7s was built for the Santa Fe in October and November 1980. There was a different door configuration for the high voltage electrical cabinet when compared to the Cotton Belt order. Two units, 7484, 7486, were set up at remote control transmitters and two units were set up as remote control receivers 7485, 7487. These were the first GE units built with Locotrol remote control equipment. The units were originally tried on the York Canyon Coal trains operating between York Canyon, New Mexico and Fontana, California.
