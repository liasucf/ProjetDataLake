    "text": "Be\u0142z Voivodeship (, ) was a unit of administrative division and local government in Poland from 1462 to the Partitions of Poland in 1772\u20131795. Together with the Ruthenian Voivodeship it was part of Red Ruthenia, Lesser Poland Province of the Polish Crown. The voivodeship was created by King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk, and had four senators in the Senate of the Commonwealth (the Voivode and the Castellan of Belz, as well as Castellans of Lubaczow and Busk). ==History== Be\u0142z Voivodeship was formed in 1462 from the territories of the Duchy of Belz, after the Duchy was annexed by the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland gives a detailed description of the voivodeship: \u201cBelz, on the Zaloka river, was one of the oldest gords of the Czerwien Land. In 981, the province was seized by Vladimir the Great. Recovered by Boleslaw Chrobry in 1018, it again became part of Rus\u2019 after Chrobry\u2019s death (...) In the early 14th century, the Land of Belz was inherited by Boleslaw Jerzy II of Mazovia, who in 1331 married Eufemia, the daughter of Grand Duke of Lithuania Gediminas and sister of Aldona of Lithuania, wife of Casimir III the Great. Boleslaw Jerzy died on April 7, 1340, and after his death, King Casimir seized Red Ruthenia together with Land of Belz (...) In 1387, King Wladyslaw Jagiello allowed his sister Alexandra of Lithuania to marry Siemowit IV, Duke of Masovia, giving her as dowry the Land of Belz. The province remained in the hands of sons and grandsons of Siemowit IV. The grandsons died childless in early 1462, and the Land of Belz became property of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, during the reign of King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk. The newly created Belz Voivodeship was slightly smaller than Lublin Voivodeship at approximately the same size as the Land of Chelm. It was made of three counties: Lubaczow, Horodlo and Szewlock, and in 1767, it was divided into the counties of Belz, Grabowiec, Horodlo, Lubaczow, and the Land of Busk. At local sejmiks in Belz, five deputies to the Sejm were elected, and the voivodeship had four starostas: Belz, Busk, Grabowiec and Horodlo (...) In the 17th century, the voivodeship, which was the smaller of all Lesser Poland voivodeships, had 483 villages and 33 towns (...) After the first partition of Poland (1772), almost whole voivodeship was annexed by the Habsburg Empire, as part of Galicia. What remained in Poland were towns of Dubienka and Korytnica, together with some villages (...) In 1793 the voivodeship ceased to exist, as after the second partition of Poland, its remaining parts were annexed by the newly created Chelm Voivodeship and Volodymyr-Volynskyi Voivodeship\". The area received an influx of szlachta from Mazovia, Lesser Poland and Greater Poland. In 1570\u20131580, 79% of the local noble families (among those of known provenance) was of Polish origin, while the percentage of Ruthenian and Wallachian noble families amounted to 15% and 4% respectively. Peasant strata of the population remained the least affected by migrations from the west. ==Municipal government== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Belz Regional council (sejmik generalny) for all Ruthenian lands: * Sudova Vyshnia Regional council (sejmik) seats: * Belz ==Administrative division== * Belz County, (Powiat Be\u0142zski), Belz * Grabowiec County, (Powiat Grabowiecki), Grabowiec * Horod\u0142o County, (Powiat Horodelski), Horod\u0142o * Lubacz\u00f3w County, (Powiat Lubaczowski), Lubacz\u00f3w * Busk Land, (Ziemia Buska), Busk ==Voivodes== * Rafa\u0142 Leszczy\u0144ski (1579-1636) (1619\u20131636) * Jakub Sobieski (from 1638) * Adam Miko\u0142aj Sieniawski (from 1692 to 1710) * Stanis\u0142aw Mateusz Rzewuski (from 1726) ==Neighbouring Voivodeships and regions== * Ruthenian Voivodeship * Volhynian Voivodeship * Lublin Voivodeship ==References== ==External links== * Map of Belz Voivodeship Category:Voivodeships of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:Geographic history of Ukraine Category:1462 establishments in Europe Category:15th-century establishments in Poland Category:1793 disestablishments in the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth Category:History of Red Ruthenia Category:Early Modern history of Ukraine ",
