    "text": "The University of A Coru\u00f1a () is a Spanish public university located in the city of A Coru\u00f1a, Galicia. Established in 1989, university departments are divided between two primary campuses in A Coru\u00f1a and nearby Ferrol. The A Coru\u00f1a campus is spread over three suburbs on the outskirts of A Coru\u00f1a: Elvi\u00f1a and Zapateira (near the site of the Battle of Elvi\u00f1a) and Oza (near the As Xubias zone). ==History== The first University in Galicia was founded 1495 in University of Santiago de Compostela, and it remained the only university in Galicia until the early 1980s when two university campuses (in A Coru\u00f1a and Vigo) were formed from the University of Santiago de Compostela. In the early 1960s, the School of Naval and Industrial Engineers of Ferrol was also established as a degree-granting institution by a Ministerial Order. Until 1990 the school was directly dependent on the Ministry of Education in Madrid. In 1990 the school was amalgamated with the University of A Coru\u00f1a. In the late 1980s, the two campuses of A Coru\u00f1a and Vigo, originally part of University of Santiago de Compostela, became fully independent universities with the authority to issue their own university degrees. In the early 1990s, the universities established further campuses of their own: *University of Santiago de Compostela based in Santiago de Compostela, with a campus in Lugo *University of A Coru\u00f1a based in A Coru\u00f1a, with a campus in Ferrol *University of Vigo based in Vigo, with campuses in Ourense and Pontevedra == Organization == The University of A Coru\u00f1a uses the open-source software Consul to let its members propose, debate and decide on issues in administration, teaching and budgeting. ==Notable people== *Rosa Cobo Bed\u00eda (born 1956), feminist, writer, and professor of sociology of gender at the University of A Coru\u00f1a ==See also== *University of Santiago de Compostela *University of Vigo ==References== ==External links== *University of A Coru\u00f1a *School of Civil Engineering *School of Computer Science and Informatics Engineering *School of Architecture Category:Educational institutions established in 1990 Category:Universities in Galicia (Spain) Category:Science and technology in Galicia (Spain) University of A Coruna Category:1990 establishments in Spain ",
