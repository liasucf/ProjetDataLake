Houghton Mifflin Company, 1994. ==Production== The design was built by Pacific Seacraft in Washington, North Carolina, United States, starting in 1981, but it is now out of production. ==Design== The Orion 27-2 is a recreational keelboat, built predominantly of plywood-cored fiberglass, with teak wood trim. It has a cutter rig, a raked stem, an angled transom, a keel-mounted rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed long keel, with a cutaway forefoot. It displaces and carries of ballast. The design has a length overall of , including the wooden planked. platform-mounted, teak bowsprit, with dual Sampson posts. A yawl rig was optional.

The fuel tank holds . The boat has two interior configurations. The first has a \"U\"-shaped dinette table and a navigation station aft of the dinette. The second layout is intended for longer-ranged cruising and has a smaller dinette table, which makes room for a wet locker at the foot of the companionway stairs. Space in the bow can be used for stowage or an optional cabin heater. In both configurations the galley is located on the starboard side of the cabin. There is a \"V\"-berth in the bow. The head is equipped with a shower, has a privacy door and is located forward, just aft of the bow \"V\"-berth. Additional sleeping space is provided by quarter berth in the cabin.

The review went on to say, \"unsurprisingly for a Mohrschladt design, the Orion 27 has conservative lines. Under the waterline is a long keel with a forefoot cutaway to improve nimbleness and reduce wetted area. The sections carry the tried and true wine-glass shape. Don\u2019t expect record setting pace with this kind of shape; think strong, safe, and good manners for heaving-to in the rough.\" ==See also== *List of sailing boat types Similar sailboats *Aloha 27 *Cal 27 *Cal 2-27 *Cal 3-27 *C&C; 27 *Crown 28 *CS 27 *Edel 820 *Express 27 *Fantasia 27 *Halman Horizon *Hotfoot 27 *Hullmaster 27 *Irwin 27 *Island Packet 27 *Mirage 27 (Perry) *Mirage 27 (Schmidt) *Mirage 275 *O'Day 272 *Watkins 27 *Watkins 27P ==References== Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ",
