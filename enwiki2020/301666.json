    "text": "In mathematical physics, n-dimensional de Sitter space (often abbreviated to dSn) is a maximally symmetric Lorentzian manifold with constant positive scalar curvature. It is the Lorentzian analogue of an n-sphere (with its canonical Riemannian metric). The main application of de Sitter space is its use in general relativity, where it serves as one of the simplest mathematical models of the universe consistent with the observed accelerating expansion of the universe. More specifically, de Sitter space is the maximally symmetric vacuum solution of Einstein's field equations with a positive cosmological constant \\Lambda (corresponding to a positive vacuum energy density and negative pressure). There is cosmological evidence that the universe itself is asymptotically de Sitter - see de Sitter universe. de Sitter space and anti-de Sitter space are named after Willem de Sitter (1872\u20131934), professor of astronomy at Leiden University and director of the Leiden Observatory. Willem de Sitter and Albert Einstein worked closely together in Leiden in the 1920s on the spacetime structure of our universe. de Sitter space was also discovered, independently, and about the same time, by Tullio Levi-Civita. ==Definition== de Sitter space can be defined as a submanifold of a generalized Minkowski space of one higher dimension. Take Minkowski space R1,n with the standard metric: :ds^2 = -dx_0^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n dx_i^2. de Sitter space is the submanifold described by the hyperboloid of one sheet :-x_0^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2 = \\alpha^2 where \\alpha is some nonzero constant with dimensions of length. The metric on de Sitter space is the metric induced from the ambient Minkowski metric. The induced metric is nondegenerate and has Lorentzian signature. (Note that if one replaces \\alpha^2 with -\\alpha^2 in the above definition, one obtains a hyperboloid of two sheets. The induced metric in this case is positive-definite, and each sheet is a copy of hyperbolic n-space. For a detailed proof, see geometry of Minkowski space.) de Sitter space can also be defined as the quotient of two indefinite orthogonal groups, which shows that it is a non-Riemannian symmetric space. Topologically, de Sitter space is (so that if then de Sitter space is simply connected). ==Properties== The isometry group of de Sitter space is the Lorentz group . The metric therefore then has independent Killing vector fields and is maximally symmetric. Every maximally symmetric space has constant curvature. The Riemann curvature tensor of de Sitter is given by :R_{\\rho\\sigma\\mu u} = {1\\over \\alpha^2}(g_{\\rho\\mu}g_{\\sigma u} - g_{\\rho u}g_{\\sigma\\mu}) . de Sitter space is an Einstein manifold since the Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric: :R_{\\mu u} = \\frac{n-1}{\\alpha^2}g_{\\mu u} This means de Sitter space is a vacuum solution of Einstein's equation with cosmological constant given by :\\Lambda = \\frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2\\alpha^2}. The scalar curvature of de Sitter space is given by :R = \\frac{n(n-1)}{\\alpha^2} = \\frac{2n}{n-2}\\Lambda. For the case , we have and . ==Static coordinates== We can introduce static coordinates (t, r, \\ldots) for de Sitter as follows: :x_0 = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2-r^2}\\sinh(t/\\alpha) :x_1 = \\sqrt{\\alpha^2-r^2}\\cosh(t/\\alpha) :x_i = r z_i \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad 2\\le i\\le n. where z_i gives the standard embedding the -sphere in Rn\u22121. In these coordinates the de Sitter metric takes the form: :ds^2 = -\\left(1-\\frac{r^2}{\\alpha^2}\\right)dt^2 + \\left(1-\\frac{r^2}{\\alpha^2}\\right)^{-1}dr^2 + r^2 d\\Omega_{n-2}^2. Note that there is a cosmological horizon at r = \\alpha. ==Flat slicing== Let :x_0 = \\alpha \\sinh(t/\\alpha) + r^2 e^{t/\\alpha}/2\\alpha, :x_1 = \\alpha \\cosh(t/\\alpha) - r^2 e^{t/\\alpha}/2\\alpha, :x_i = e^{t/\\alpha}y_i, \\qquad 2 \\leq i \\leq n where r^2=\\sum_i y_i^2. Then in the (t,y_i) coordinates metric reads: :ds^{2} = -dt^{2} + e^{2t/\\alpha} dy^{2} where dy^2=\\sum_i dy_i^2 is the flat metric on y_i's. Setting \\zeta = \\zeta_{\\infty} - \\alpha e^{-t/\\alpha}, we obtain the conformally flat metric: :ds^{2} = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{(\\zeta_{\\infty} - \\zeta)^2}(dy^{2}-d\\zeta^2) ==Open slicing== Let :x_0 = \\alpha \\sinh(t/\\alpha) \\cosh\\xi, :x_1 = \\alpha \\cosh(t/\\alpha), :x_i = \\alpha z_i \\sinh(t/\\alpha) \\sinh\\xi, \\qquad 2 \\leq i \\leq n where \\sum_i z_i^2 = 1 forming a S^{n-2} with the standard metric \\sum_i dz_i^2 = d\\Omega_{n-2}^2. Then the metric of the de Sitter space reads :ds^2 = -dt^2 + \\alpha^2 \\sinh^2(t/\\alpha) dH_{n-1}^2, where :dH_{n-1}^2 = d\\xi^2 + \\sinh^2(\\xi) d\\Omega_{n-2}^2 is the standard hyperbolic metric. ==Closed slicing== Let :x_0 = \\alpha \\sinh(t/\\alpha), :x_i = \\alpha \\cosh(t/\\alpha) z_i, \\qquad 1 \\leq i \\leq n where z_is describe a S^{n-1}. Then the metric reads: :ds^2 = -dt^2 + \\alpha^2 \\cosh^2(t/\\alpha) d\\Omega_{n-1}^2. Changing the time variable to the conformal time via \\tan(\\eta/2)=\\tanh(t/2\\alpha) we obtain a metric conformally equivalent to Einstein static universe: :ds^2 = \\frac{\\alpha^2}{\\cos^2\\eta}(-d\\eta^2 + d\\Omega_{n-1}^2). This serves to find the Penrose diagram of de Sitter space. ==dS slicing== Let :x_0 = \\alpha \\sin(\\chi/\\alpha) \\sinh(t/\\alpha) \\cosh\\xi, :x_1 = \\alpha \\cos(\\chi/\\alpha), :x_2 = \\alpha \\sin(\\chi/\\alpha) \\cosh(t/\\alpha), :x_i = \\alpha z_i \\sin(\\chi/\\alpha) \\sinh(t/\\alpha) \\sinh\\xi, \\qquad 3 \\leq i \\leq n where z_is describe a S^{n-3}. Then the metric reads: :ds^2 = d\\chi^2 + \\sin^2(\\chi/\\alpha) ds_{dS,\\alpha,n-1}^2, where :ds_{dS,\\alpha,n-1}^2 = -dt^2 + \\alpha^2 \\sinh^2(t/\\alpha) dH_{n-2}^2 is the metric of an n-1 dimensional de Sitter space with radius of curvature \\alpha in open slicing coordinates. The hyperbolic metric is given by: :dH_{n-2}^2 = d\\xi^2 + \\sinh^2\\xi d\\Omega_{n-3}^2. This is the analytic continuation of the open slicing coordinates under (t,\\xi,\\theta,\\phi_1,\\phi_2,\\cdots,\\phi_{n-3}) \\to (i\\chi,\\xi,it,\\theta,\\phi_1,\\cdots,\\phi_{n-4}) and also switching x_0 and x_2 because they change their timelike/spacelike nature. ==See also== * Anti-de Sitter space * de Sitter universe * AdS/CFT correspondence * de Sitter\u2013Schwarzschild metric ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * ==External links== * Simplified Guide to de Sitter and anti-de Sitter Spaces A pedagogic introduction to de Sitter and anti-de Sitter spaces.
