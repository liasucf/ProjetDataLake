    "text": "Px27 is a class of Polish State Railways (PKP) narrow-gauge steam locomotive built by Fablok in Chrzan\u00f3w, Poland, in 1929 (factory type W5A). Only two locomotives of this class were made, and one, Px27-775, is currently preserved. == History == In 1927 Wyrzysk County Railways (Wyrzyskie Koleje Powiatowe) ordered two locomotives in the First Locomotive Factory in Poland (Fablok), fit for service on sloping line profile. Fablok designed and manufactured two W5A type locomotives in 1929.Pokropi\u0144ski (2016), p. 38-42, 204 After 1961 these were designated as PKP class Px27. It was a D (0-8-0) axle arrangement tank locomotive with an additional two-axle tender. The design based upon Fablok's earlier W2A type tank locomotive (later Tx26-427). Only after nine years, in 1938 the third and last slightly differing locomotive of W5A type was ordered by other railway (it was later designed as Px38 class). Both locomotives, factory numbers 343 and 344, received stock numbers 25 and 26 respectively and stationed in Bia\u0142o\u015bliwie depot. Both survived World War II, working on their railway. After the war, all county railways were taken over by the Polish State Railways (PKP) and in 1947 the locomotives were included into PKP Px2 collective class and given numbers Px2-801 (ex 26) and 802 (ex 25). According to new regulations, in 1961 both locomotives were classified as Px27 class, being the only ones in this class (P - locomotive with a tender, x - D axle arrangement, 27 \u2013 Polish origin locomotive designed in 1927). Px2-801 (factory no. 344) was renamed Px27-774, and Px2-802 (factory no. 343) was renamed Px27-775. After World War II both locomotives worked still on Bydgoszcz-Wyrzysk railway, basing in Bia\u0142o\u015bliwie. Px27-774 was retired on 26 September 1970, and then scrapped. Px 27-775 worked until 1976, then it was given to Narrow Gauge Railway Museum in Wenecja, as a cold exhibit. (It might be noted, that also Px38-805 of W5A type is preserved in Wenecja). {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Build no. !year !no.: until 1948 !1949-1960 !from 1961 !disposition |- | Fablok 343||1929||25 || Px2-802 ||Px27-775 ||retired in 1976, preserved |- |Fablok 344||1929||26||Px2-801 ||Px27-774 ||retired in 1970, scrapped |} ==References== *. ==See also== *Narrow-gauge railways in Poland == External links == * Px27-775 - Wci\u0105\u017c pod par\u0105 Additional photographs and information (Polish) Category:Narrow gauge steam locomotives of Poland Category:Preserved steam locomotives of Poland Category:Polish State Railways steam locomotives Category:600 mm gauge railway locomotives Category:0-8-0 locomotives ",
