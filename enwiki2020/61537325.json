On 14 October 1907 John Sinclair, and animal trainer opened the Winter Zoo in Guild Street, Aberdeen. Of the many attractions, including a lion and lioness, were quarter-hourly cinematographic shows by Dove Paterson.Thomson (1988) pp. 34 Paterson wrote an article for the trade paper \"Kinematogaph and Lantern Weekly\" issue on 2 July 1908, \"How I Handle Pictures - By Dove Paterson, The Northern Picture Specialist\" in it he states: > \"I insist on the sobriety of my whole staff. I have been a life-long > abstainer, and Lady Nicotine claims none of my affections, and it is simply > by adherance [sic] to those (some would think minor) details that I have > been able to handle the pictures so successfully, and retain the favour and > confidence of the public so far.\" He also stated that he had toured the USA and Canada in 1892-93 as an elocutionist and concert promoter with the Royal Edinburgh Concert Company. \"..perhaps then I absorbed the hustling propensities of the Yankee - which are very useful in making my shows a success at the present time.\"Thomson (1988) pp. 36-37 Paterson was an inventor too, designing, refining and patenting several pieces of projector equipment.Thomson (1988) pp. 39, 40 On 5 September 1908 Paterson opened Aberdeen's first permanent cinema, The Gaiety, in the former Saint Katherine's Hall on Shiprow, between Union Street and Provost Ross's House.

Paterson, was ready to take it, having had an ambition to operate his own city centre cinema. He and his wife took over on 11 August 1913. Paterson took his camera to the Braemar Gathering of 1913. The film he made led to his giving a royal command performance at Mar Lodge for the Princess Royal on 17 September 1913.Thomson (1988) pp. 70-71 In late 1913 a film had been made of The Turra Coo, a cow which had been seized for auction in lieu of unpaid National Insurance by a farmer in Turriff. The film was shown at both The Gaiety and Coliseum cinemas in Aberdeen in February 1914. Paterson \"took the film to Turriff for a special show in aid of the Parish Church renovation scheme, and to the Victoria Hall, Ellon, where great cheers and applause greeted the appearance on screen of several well-known farmers.\" Thomson (1988) pp. 81 Paterson's lease on the Gaiety Theatre, which he had held since 1908, came to an end in Autumn 1914.

His first marriage took place at 26 Catherine Street, Aberdeen on 7 February 1880 to Hellen Philips Ewen. Both were aged nineteen, and were living at the same address: 18 Jute Street, Aberdeen. Paterson signs as W D Paterson, and his occupation was given as Draper's Assistant. Their son, John Innes Paterson was born on 16 September 1886 at their home, 7 Cherrybank, Hardgate, Aberdeen. The father's name is once again given as William Donald Paterson, and his occupation is a Draper (Assistant).Register of births for Old Machar Parish 1886. P443 Record 1327. Come the 1891 Census, William and Hellen are still at Cherrybank. They have three children listed: a son, \"Alfred W.E. Paterson, aged 11; a daughter, Winnifred H. Paterson, aged 10; and a further son, John J.E.

Decree of Divorce was pronounced by Lord Wellwood, Ordinary, in an action at the instance of William Donald Paterson, Draper, Aberdeen against Ellen Philip Ewan [sic] or Paterson his wife formerly in Aberdeen and now in Edinburgh.\" The grounds for the divorce are not stated but in the late 19th and most of the 20th century an action of divorce could only be brought at the Court Of Session. Paterson re-married on 21 February 1911 - some seventeen years after his divorce from Helen. His new spouse was Marie Louise Pascoe. He was 49 and she was 35. The service took place at 33 Leslie Road, Woodside, Aberdeen, his then address. He signed as William Dove Paterson and described himself as formerly married and gave his profession as an \"Entertainer (Dramatic)\", and she described herself 'spinster' and as an \"Actress (Dramatic)\". Her address is given as \"25 Union Street, Aberdeen\".Register of Marriages for the Parish of Woodside, Aberdeen, 1911, P4. Record 8. A description of the wedding is given at some length in a piece in that week's edition of Bon Accord Magazine headed \"A Pretty Aberdeen Wedding\". Bon Accord Magazine, 23 February 1911 In addition to noting who attended and a lengthy descriptions of the bride's dress and going-away costume (both by Pratt and Keith) it stated \"Among the numerous and valuable presents received by the bride and groom were - From th bridegroom to the bride, a gold watch and chain, two massive gold bangles, and a gold chain pendant, the pendant being in the form of a lyre, which bore a wreath of primroses formed of pearls. From bride to bridegroom, the presents included a complete set of dress jewellery gold with monogram. Mr and Mrs Dove Paterson left Aberdeen by the 1-10 p.m. train for London where a brief honeymoon is to be spent.\" The following week's Bon Accord Magazine, in its Entertainment column, in an entry for The Gaiety states that \"A military episode entitled 'Ransomed, Or A Prisoner of War' tops the Gaiety programme this week.... Mr and Mrs Dobe Paterson, fresh from their London Trip, supply the necessary vocal accompaniments in characteristic style'. Bon Accord Magazine, 2 March 1911So, their honeymoon was a short one.\" 1899 Advertisement for Aberdeen firm Pratt and Keith In Silver Screen In The Silver City, Thomson states \".. the family settled down at Crighton House (later Crightonville), 33 Leslie Road. The Crighton connection is obscure\" Thomson (1988) pp. 46 He continues, \"..when, in 1912 or 1913, the Patersons moved to 24 Powis Terrace they named the house 'Crighton Villa', a name which went with them when they moved again in 1914 to No. 46 Powis Terrace.\" We now know that Crighton was his mother's surname. Note that Thomson's reference to \"46 Powis Terrace\" is at odds with the official death registration (see below) which gives his address in June 1916 address 47 Powis Terrace. His son Leo Paterson assisted him as a cinematograph operator before moving to Glasgow, and a married daughter emigrated to Canada. His widow, Marie Louise Pascoe, who he had married 21 February 1911 and her brother Joseph Pascoe, who was formerly a watch inspector for the Canadian Pacific Railway carried on business at the Coliseum after his death. He was survived by another son, John Innes Paterson (see illness and death, below).

He had taken cramps while bathing at Aberdeen Beach three weeks earlier and had been pulled unconscious from the sea. Despite making an apparent recovery, he succumbed to pneumonia and died. His death registration, notified by his son John Innes Paterson, gives his name at death as William Dove Paterson. His profession is recorded as Cinematograph Proprietor, and his widow as Marie Louise Pascoe. An entry in the Register of Corrected Entries for the Parish of St Nicholas gives Paterson's name as 'William Donald Paterson (otherwise William \"Dove\" Paterson).' His cause of death, which appeared as \"pneumonia\" on his original death certificate is replaced by \"Pneumonia following sudden collapse while bathing in the sea on 28th May 1916.\"Register of Corrected Entries for St Nicholas Parish, Vol XXVI page 82 Thomson states that Paterson was in the habit of regularly swimming at the beach and on this occasion had been bathing 400 yards north of the Bathing Station where he had got into difficulties.Thomson (1988) pp. 94-97 The funeral service, which was attended by numerous local dignitaries,Aberdeen Daily Journal, 24 June 1916.
