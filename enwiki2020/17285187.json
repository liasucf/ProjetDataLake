    "text": "The 2008 al-Qaeda offensive in Iraq was a month-long offensive conducted by al-Qaeda in Iraq against the multinational coalition of USA, UK, Australia and Poland. On 19 April 2008, the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, Ayyub al-Masri, called for a month-long offensive against U.S. and Iraqi forces. However, the offensive is generally considered to have started four days earlier, when a series of suicide bombings in four major cities killed nearly 60 people. Shortly after al-Masri's announcement a steady bombing campaign commenced against coalition forces. The series of bombings raised fears that remaining Sunni insurgents, who were still fighting the central government, were regrouping following their major defeat during Operation Phantom Phoenix earlier that year, that left them with only one major urban stronghold in the north, in Mosul. The offensive ended after a month with no clear gains for either side. == Timeline of major attacks during the offensive == 15 April 2008: In Baquba, as many as 53 people were killed and at least 70 more were wounded during a car bombing near the courthouse.FACTBOX-Security developments in Iraq, April 15 A suicide bomber killed 13 people and injured 20 more outside a kebab restaurant in Ramadi.Bombings kill nearly 60 in Sunni areas of Iraq Five policemen were killed and four more were wounded during a suicide bombing at a checkpoint in the Hamidhiya area of Ramadi.Aswat Aliraq In Mosul, a double car bombing killed three people and wounded at least 16 people.Aswat Aliraq In Baghdad, a car bomb targeting a police patrol killed four people and wounded 15 in a central neighborhood. 17 April 2008: Near Tuz Khormato in the village of al-Bu Mohammed, at least 50 people were killed and 55 more were wounded when a suicide bomber blew up his explosives at a funeral for two U.S.-allied militia members killed a day earlier.
