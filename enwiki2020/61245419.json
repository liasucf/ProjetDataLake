    "text": "The Bronze Gate (, ), or \"the southern gate\" is the smaller of the four principal Roman gates into the stari grad (old town) of Split that was once Diocletian's Palace. Originally a sea gate from which the Emperor entered the complex by boat, via the basement rooms in the Imperial Palace. Today it is the main entry point from the Promenade to the Cathedral. ==History== During the late antiquity, the gate was known as the Porta Meridionalis (\"the southern gate\") and Diocletian (\u2020316) probably entered his palace through this gate when embarking/disembarking for sea voyages.https://visitsplit.com/hr/524/mjedena-vrata There was no promenade, instead, the sea lapped up against the walls,https://www.absolute- croatia.com/split-region-dalmatia/split/attractions/item/brass-gate-split so ships could dock at the Palace. It was constructed just below the peristyle. In the Middle Ages, the gate was known as the 'Security Gate'.https://triprabbits.com/hr/mjedena-vrata-split-hrvatska-znamenitosti- atrakcije/ Today this is the most used gate within the Palace, with many tourists starting their guided tours from here, as it has access to the Riva.https://visitsplit.com/hr/524/mjedena-vrata ==Description== The Bronze Gate was the main gate of Diocletian's palace (via the sea), located in the middle of the south wall; today this section of the outer walls are the best preserved. The style of the gate is completely different from the other three gates of the Palace. It is smaller in size, no decoration and not supported by gatehouses either side. The gate used to be a direct exit to the sea and escape in the event of an attack on the Palace, so in the Middle Ages, it was known as the \"Security Gate\".https://triprabbits.com/hr/mjedena-vrata-split- hrvatska-znamenitosti-atrakcije/ ==See also== * Diocletian's Palace *The Golden Gate (Diocletian's Palace) *The Iron Gate (Diocletian's Palace) *The Silver Gate (Diocletian's Palace) *The Golden Gate (Constantinople), Imperial entrance gate of the city of Constantinople, present-day Istanbul, Turkey *Dalmatia *Roman architecture ==References== ==Further reading== * \u0160u\u0161njar, Bogdan, Villa de Diocleziano in Split, Naklada Bo\u0161kovi\u0107, Split, 2003. ==External links== Category:World Heritage Sites in Croatia Category:Archaeological sites in Croatia Category:Buildings and structures in Split, Croatia Category:Ancient Roman buildings and structures in Croatia Category:Romanesque architecture Category:Churches in Croatia Category:Tourist attractions in Split-Dalmatia County ",
