    "text": "Madeleine R. Stoner (September 13, 1937 - July 13, 2008) was an American sociologist. She was the Richard M. and Ann L. Thor Professor in Urban Social Development at the University of Southern California, and the author of two books about homelessness. In Inventing a Non-Homeless Future: A Public Policy Agenda for Preventing Homelessness, Stoner dismisses welfare programs as outdated and suggests affordable housing could alleviate homelessness. In The Civil Rights of Homeless People: Law, Social Policy, and Social Work Practice, Stoner argues that the homeless struggle to have access to welfare because the system is based on property rights. ==Selected works== * * ==References== Category:1937 births Category:2008 deaths Category:People from Westwood, Los Angeles Category:University of Southern California faculty Category:American sociologists ",
