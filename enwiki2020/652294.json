It is the seat of Ropczyce- S\u0119dzisz\u00f3w County, which has a total population of 713,350 people (30 June 2008). ==History== The first reference to Ropczyce comes from a document of 1252, which confirmed the donation of the land by the brothers Klemens and Marek Gryf to a Cistercian Abbey in Szczyrzyc near Limanowa.Ma\u0144ko, S\u0142awomir. \"Ropczyce: The Chassidic Route\", page 10. Polish Jews Heritage 2008.K\u0142os, Stanis\u0142aw. \"Wojewodztwo Rzeszowskie Przewodnik\u2033, page 100 Sport i Turystyka, 1969. Around this time Ropczyce was damaged by a Tatar raid. In 1266 the settlement was destroyed by an army composed of Ruthenians, Tatar and Lithuanian troops, led by the Ruthenian prince 'Ioann (John) Shvarn' (), ). Ropczyce became a town on 3 March 1362, when the Polish king, Casimir III the Great, gave it city rights (Magdeburg rights). At the same time, he made two brothers, Jan and Mikolaj Gielnic the first w\u00f3jts or advocates of the new town. He also made Ropczyce a parish, separate from the parish of S\u0119dziszow. Within six years a parish church was built in the new royal town of Ropczyce. As Ropczyce was situated close to the Sandomierz Forest (), one of the biggest forests in southern Poland, which covers large parts of the Sandomierz Basin, it became a popular place for the Polish Kings to stay when they went hunting and fishing. King Casimir III the Great, king Kazimierz IV Jagiello\u0144czyk and king W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o were regular visitors to Ropczyce. Under the patronage of the Polish Royals and subsequent trade agreements with Ruthenia, the town's future started to look very good. It could then grow and develop, also due to its favourable location on an important trade route from Silesia and Lesser Poland (Ma\u0142opolska) to Ruthenia. A publication now in the public domain Ropczyce was severely damaged during a Tatar raid in 1504. To help the town and citizens recover from this tragedy, king Aleksander Jagiello\u0144czyk gave all the citizens a 10-year tax exemption from 1504\u20131514 In the 15th and 16th centuries Ropczyce became a major centre in the manufacture of canvas goods. Since its formation Ropczyce has been known by several different names, although these appear to be phonetic variations of the same name. By the middle of the 16th century, it was first recorded as 'Ropczyce' replacing the previous variation of 'Robczyce' \u2013 this name is thought to have probably originated from the family name of Robek' (from the Polish verb, 'robi\u0107 \u2013 to work) who are thought to have established the original settlement. In the 16th century Ropczyce's churches were influenced by The Reformation, with the Parish Church going over to Protestantism several times. Around the 1550s the Parish Church was under the control of the Polish Brethren (Bracia Polscy, also called Arians or Socinians) for over a decade. ===Jewish history=== > The earliest information about Jews settling in Ropczyce dates back to 1564. > It was noted then that four Jewish families, i.e. about 30 people, lived on > the farm of the Gryf family.

Up until World War II Ropczyce was a \u2018shtetl\u2019 () with a significant Jewish population. There is a Ropshitz Hasidic dynasty. The Germans occupied Ropczyce in September 1939 and immediately began brutalizing the Jewish population, at that time around 1000 people. They burned the synagogue and shortly began to conscript Jews for forced labor. Many Jewish refugees from nearby villages came to Ropczyce during the next two years. In May, 2942, 75 men were deported to a labor camp in Pustkow. In June, there was another roundup where 23 people were murdered on the spot and others were sent to Pustkow. Later in the month, the remaining Jews were forced into an overcrowded ghetto. In July, the Germans shot 28 people, children and the elderly, and took the rest of the Jewish population to Sedziszow Malopolski. Several hundred were shot there and the rest sent by train to Belzec where they were immediately gassed. The number of survivors among the Ropczyce Jews is unknown. The Parish Church of the Transfiguration in Ropczyce ===17th century to 18th century=== Ropczyce's \u2018Golden Age\u2019 was but a distant memory in the 17th and 18th centuries \u2013 these were times of wars and invasions. The town went into decline and life got a lot harder for the townspeople. In 1605 over half of the town was destroyed in a great fire. Fifty years later, Ropczyce was hit by The Plague. Ropczyce was plundered by Swedish troops in 1655 and then devastated in 1657 by the army of George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, the Prince of Transylvania. In 1669 the Parish Church was destroyed by fire. On 14 July 1772, following the First Partition of Poland, Ropczyce found itself in the Austrian province of Galicia, part of the Habsburg Monarchy in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. Ropczyce was first located in the administrative area (or cyrku\u0142) of Pilznen and in the Sandomierski district. In 1775 the administrative areas in Galicia were reorganised and Ropczyce was reallocated to the Tarn\u00f3w cyrku\u0142. Fortunately for Ropczyce, as a 'Royal town', it was given virtually autonomous administration. The position of 'town advocate\u2019 was replaced by the new position of mayor. However, during these times the whole region was systematically Germanised, from the system of administration, local by-laws, education to everyday life. ===19th century to 20th century=== At the beginning of the 19th century, the population grew to over 1,000. At this time there was a small Austrian garrison stationed in the town. In 1806 there was a Cholera outbreak in which 133 people from Ropczyce died. In 1873 the town was again struck by a great fire, with much destruction. In the following administrative changes of the region of Galicia in 1885, 178 counties (powiats) were created in the existing 19 administrative areas (cyrku\u0142s) and Ropczyce was made the administrative centre of its own county. The last reorganisation occurred in 1867 saw the reduction of administrative areas and the number of counties set to 74. Ropczyce remained as the seat of its county. At the end of 1867 the population of Ropczyce county was 58,975 people, the first starosta; elder or mayor of the reorganised county of Ropczyce was Wilhelm Mehoffer (father of J\u00f3zef Mehoffer, Polish painter). Ropczyce remained part of Galicia until 1918, when it became part of independent Poland (Second Polish Republic).

(Within Poland the E40 follows the A4 Highway and the DK 4 National Road). However, the A4 is not regarded as a 'highway' in the Ropczyce area \u2013 it is by Western standards, just a regular, one-lane main A-road (although, it is currently being upgraded). Other Polish cities located by the E40 are Wroc\u0142aw, Opole, Katowice, Krak\u00f3w, Tarn\u00f3w, Rzesz\u00f3w and Przemy\u015bl. The nearest airport is Rzesz\u00f3w-Jasionka Airport (Port Lotniczy Rzesz\u00f3w- Jasionka) located in the village of Jasionka, north of Rzesz\u00f3w. It is about east of Ropczyce on the E40 and takes about 40 minutes by car. Scheduled passenger services include flights to: Warsaw (WAW), Dublin, London (Stansted), Bristol, UK, Birmingham, UK, New York (JFK Airport, and Newark Liberty International Airport). Ropczyce has a railway station which is on the main West-East rail route; . This runs from Silesia and Krak\u00f3w, Krak\u00f3w Main station (Krak\u00f3w G\u0142\u00f3wny) \u2013 Medyka on the Polish eastern border. This line then continues on to Ukraine. ==International relations== ===Twin towns \u2013 Sister cities=== Ropczyce is twinned with: {|class=\"wikitable\" |- valign=\"top\" | *24px Stropkov in Slovakia *26px Ochsenfurt in Germany || *25px Busk in Ukraine *24px Lokeren in Belgium |} ==Notable people== {|cellpadding=\"11\" |- valign=\"top\" | *Stanis\u0142aw \"Rewera\" Potocki (1579\u20131667) *Feliks Kazimierz Potocki (1630\u20131702) *Franciszek Salezy Potocki (1700\u20131772) *Adam Baal Shem *Rabbi Naftali fun Ropszyc (1760\u20131827) *Piotr Micha\u0142owski (1800\u20131855)Ambrozowicz, J\u00f3zef. \"Ziema Ropczycka\", Summary by W\u0142adys\u0142aw M.
