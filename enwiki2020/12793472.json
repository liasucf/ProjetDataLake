    "text": "\"I Don't Wanna Lose At Love\" is the second single to be released from Tanita Tikaram's sixth studio album The Cappuccino Songs. ==Background== \"I Don't Wanna Lose at Love\" has a distinctive string intro, which is looped throughout the song, that is sampled from Finnish folk-rock band V\u00e4rttin\u00e4's 1992 song \"Seelinnikoi\". The group received a credit as co-writers of the song. Released as the second single of Tikaram's album The Cappuccino Songs, the single mix differs from the album version, and was given a poppier sound by Stephen Lironi. The song was given additional remixes by noted remixers of Indian ascent Asian Dub Foundation and Talvin Singh. The single was released as a two-part CD in the UK. It peaked at #73 there, and to date it's Tikaram's last single to chart in that country. ==Releases== *;UK CD single 1 #\"I Don't Wanna Lose At Love\" (Radio Version) \u2014 3:56 #\"I Don't Wanna Lose At Love\" (Love Loss Asian Dub Foundation Remix) \u2014 4:28 #\"In Your Time\" \u2014 3:46 *;UK CD single 2 #\"I Don't Wanna Lose At Love\" (Radio Version) \u2014 3:56 #\"I Don't Wanna Lose At Love\" (XT Talvin Singh Mix) \u2014 7:18 #\"Only One Boy In The Crowd\" - 3:38 == Charts == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1998) !Peak position |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|73 |} Category:1998 singles Category:Tanita Tikaram songs Category:Songs written by Marco Sabiu Category:1998 songs ",
