    "text": "Wanton Spirit is a studio album by American jazz pianist Kenny Barron together with drummer Roy Haynes and bassist Charlie Haden. The album was released in 1994 on Verve Records label. Wanton Spirit was nominated for a 1996 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance. ==Reception== In his review on Allmusic, Lee Bloom noted: \"Wanton Spirit further establishes him as a leader and teams him with bebop legend Roy Haynes on drums and Charlie Haden on bass. The early influences of Tatum, Powell, Monk, plus the melodic lines of Tommy Flanagan, the pentatonic harmony of McCoy Tyner, and the rhythmic fluidity of Herbie Hancock have all been thoroughly absorbed by Barron.\" On Chicago Tribune critic Howard Reich wrote: \"Though admired among connoisseurs, pianist Kenny Barron never has attained the acclaim he deserves. Perhaps his playing is a bit too subtle and introverted to reach a wide public, or perhaps his timing was off, since he arrived on the scene after the great legends of the '40s and '50s but before the young lions of the '80s. In any event, his name still signals first-rate pianism, as his recent release, \"Wanton Spirit,\" proves.\" On The Los Angeles Times, reviewer Bill Kohlhaase stated: \" \"Wanton Spirit\" makes up for Barron's near-miss recordings of the last few years while painting a more honest picture of his skills. It's an album that, finally, should bring him the accolades he deserves.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Band *Kenny Barron \u2013 piano *Charlie Haden \u2013 bass *Roy Haynes \u2013 drums Production *Jean-Philippe Allard \u2013 executive producer *Carol Friedman \u2013 photography *Alain Gerber \u2013 liner notes *Joanne Klein \u2013 producer *Didier Marc \u2013 mastering *Joe Marciano \u2013 engineer == References == ==External links== * Category:Kenny Barron albums Category:1994 albums Category:Verve Records live albums ",
