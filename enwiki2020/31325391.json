    "text": "A modular stadium or the Legacy Modular Stadium is a sports facility that is constructed of modular components. In contrast to a temporary stadium, modular stadiums are not time-limited constructions, but rather permanent ones. The actual structure is thereby built without the use of concrete. The focus here is on the steel construction. Individual elements are used for modular construction, making it possible to enlarge or downsize even after actual completion. Due to this method, the structures remain flexible, reusable, and when necessary, can be adapted to new requirements with minimal effort \u2013 for instance, when a soccer club advances to the next highest league. For many years, permanently installed sports facilities and arenas were regarded as the measure of all things \u2013 not lastly for reasons of prestige. In the meantime, however, other values now take precedence: Events like the Olympic Games or World Cups can only be fully accepted today when they consider sustainability. This includes, on the one hand, efficient environmental management \u2013 beginning with traffic issues and culminating with the environmentally friendly disposal of consumables. Just as important, since it is of long-term significance, is the aspect of reusing sports facilities when the athletes have moved on. Even though modular stadiums are built for permanent, long-term use, they still unite the many advantages offered by temporary construction, because they are quickly and cost-efficiently built with prefabricated modules. The modular construction also has another great benefit, which will become even more significant in the future: Suppose that a modular, and therefore removable stadium with 45,000 seats is in planning for a World Cup - the modules of the stadium can be used afterward to build several small permanent facilities. This might be, for example, a stadium to seat 25,000 for a soccer club and a stadium with a capacity for 20,000 with track and field facilities, or several smaller facilities with seating for 5 to 10,000 to accommodate smaller clubs. In this manner, the original stadium can be transformed into a 100 percent constructively used, sustainable solution. A permanent stadium that relies on concrete construction is a candidate for nearly total demolition, in order to make it disappear. The components of a removable Stadium, however, are able to be comparatively easily taken apart and can be used again to a great extent for other building projects for the legacy. In connection with Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, there have already been design concepts created for the construction of modular stadiums and even plans submitted for modular extensions of existing sports facilities. It was also connected with Morocco's unsuccessful bid for the 2026 FIFA World Cup. == See also == * Sport venue * Sports complex * Multi-purpose stadium == References == Stadium Category:Sports venues Category:Stadiums ",
