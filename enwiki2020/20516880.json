    "text": "The Twenty-Ninth Canadian Ministry is the Cabinet, chaired by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, that began governing Canada shortly before the opening of the 42nd Parliament. The original members were sworn in during a ceremony held at Rideau Hall on November 4, 2015. Those who were not already members of the Queen's Privy Council for Canada were sworn into the Privy Council in the same ceremony. The Cabinet currently consists of 35 members including Trudeau, with 17 women and 18 men. When the ministry was first sworn in, with fifteen men and fifteen women (aside from Trudeau), it became the first gender-balanced cabinet in Canadian history. ==List of Ministers== ===By minister=== The list below follows the Canadian order of precedence, which is established by the chronological order of appointment to the Queen's Privy Council for Canada, then in order of election or appointment to parliament for ministers who joined the Privy Council on the same day, with former ministers being listed last in order of appointment to the Privy Council. {| class=\"wikitable\" !width=\"160pt\"|Minister !width=\"410pt\"|Portfolio !width=\"250pt\"|Tenure |- | rowspan=\"2\" | Justin Trudeau | Prime Minister | November 4, 2015 -
