From 1996 to 2008, Tsivory hosted the headquarters of the PHBM Project of the Government of Madagascar support by the International Fund for Agriculture Development. PHBM stands for \"Projet de D\u00e9veloppement du Haut Bassin du Mandrare\". This project has constructed or renovated more than 200 km of roads, and 5000 ha of irrigation schemes. The livelihood of the 146000 people living in the surrounding 11 communes has considerably improved during the past 10 years, and the production has doubled. The area now produces 22 000 tons of rice per year (compared to 1500 tons in the 1990s). The project closed in September 2008 and farmers associations are pursuing the rural development work. The closing workshop was held in Fort Dauphin early December 2008. Category:Populated places in Anosy Region ",
