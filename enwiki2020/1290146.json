Macmillan, Feb 1, 2005. 9780312321925 ==Anglo-Saxon g\u0101r rune== In addition to gyfu, the Anglo-Saxon futhorc has the g\u0101r rune , named after a species of medieval spear. It is attested epigraphically on the Ruthwell Cross, and also appears in 11th-century manuscript tradition. Phonetically, g\u0101r represents the /g/ sound. It is a modification of the plain gyfu rune . Old English \u2018g\u0101r\u2019 means \u2018spear\u2019, but the name of the rune likely echoes the rune names ger, ear, ior: due to palatalization in Old English, the original g rune (i.e., the Gyfu rune ) could express either /j/ or /g/ (see yogh). The ger unambiguously expressed /j/, and the newly introduced gar rune had the purpose of unambiguously expressing /g/. G\u0101r is the 33rd and final rune in the row as given in Cotton Domitian A.ix. ==See also== *Thor Steinar == References == ==External links== * The Futhark on www.ancientscripts.com Category:Runes ",
