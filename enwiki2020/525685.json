    "text": "The Royal Commission of Inquiry on Constitutional Problems or Tremblay Commission was called for by the premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis in 1953. The commission, chaired by Mr. Justice Thomas Tremblay, studied the problem of tax sharing between different levels of government and greater constitutional problems in Canada. The commission published a five-volume report in 1956. It proposed a maximum level of taxation be established, the provincial responsibility for unemployment benefits, and a shared personal and corporate tax scheme between the federal and provincial governments. \u00c9ric Montpetit of the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al writes that > [t]he mandate of the Tremblay Commission could be described as making > explicit Quebec\u2019s vision of Canada, which had been expressed by the > traditional elite, with the blessing of the Clergy. http://www.cerium.ca/IMG/pdf/Montpetit.pdf == References == ==External links== * Index to Federal Royal Commissions * Tremblay Report And Provincial Autonomy in the Duplessis Era (1956) Category:Constitutional commissions Category:Royal commissions in Canada Category:Constitution of Canada Category:Quebec nationalism Category:1956 documents Category:History of Canada (1945\u20131960) Category:1956 in Canada ",
