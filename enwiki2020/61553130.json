In the second phase, the remaining eight teams would be divided into two groups of four, in which each team played the teams of its own group in a double round-robin system. The beat team of each group would qualify to the Second phase of the championship, and to the Division A of the following year. * Relegation Playoffs: The six teams that had qualified to this round played each other in a double round-robin format.
