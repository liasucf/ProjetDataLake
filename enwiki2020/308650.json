A morning newspaper serving most of the state north of New Haven and east of Waterbury, its headquarters on Broad Street in Hartford, Connecticut are a short walk from the state capitol. It reports regional news with a chain of bureaus in smaller cities and a series of local editions. It also operates CTNow, a free local weekly newspaper and website. The Courant began as a weekly called the \"Connecticut Courant\" on October 29, 1764, becoming daily in 1837. In 1979, it was bought by the Times Mirror Company. In 2000, Times Mirror became owned by the Tribune Company, which later combined the paper's management and facilities with those of a Tribune- owned Hartford television station. In 2014, The Courant and other Tribune print properties were spun off to a new corporate parent Tribune Publishing separate from the station. ==History== Courant building on State Street (about 1900) The Connecticut Courant began as a weekly on October 29, 1764, started by Thomas Green. The word \"courant\" derives from the French courante nouvellen, indicating current news itemsJoop W. Koopmans, Early Modern Media and the News in Europe: Perspectives from the Dutch Angle (Boston: Brill, 2018), page 140 and page 140note7 , possibly borrowed by way of the Dutch krant.So suggests journalist Denis Edward Horgan, Flotsam: A Life in Debris (Higganum, Conn.: Higganum Hill Books, 2007), 62 Courant was occasionally a name for English-language newspapers, including the New-England Courant (Boston), founded by James Franklin in 1721.J. A. Leo Lemay, The Life of Benjamin Franklin, Vol. 1, Journalist, 1706-1730 (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2006 [2005]), 84 The daily Hartford Courant traces its existence back to the weekly, thereby claiming the title \"America's oldest continuously published newspaper\", and adopting as its slogan, \"Older than the nation.\" (The New Hampshire Gazette, which started publication in 1756 and all but disappeared into other publications for most of a century, trademarked the title of oldest paper in the nation after being revived as a small biweekly in 1989. See also the New York Post as oldest daily, Providence Journal as oldest continuous daily, and Time magazine's view of \"oldest\" claims.) The Hartford Courant became daily in 1837, while still publishing a weekly edition until 1896. Joseph Roswell Hawley, a leading Republican politician and former governor of the state, in 1867 bought the newspaper, which he combined with the Press. Under his editorship, this became the most influential newspaper in Connecticut and one of the leading Republican papers in the country. Emile Gauvreau became a reporter in 1916, and the managing editor in 1919. His energetic and often sensational news policies affronted Charles Clark, the owner and editor. Clark fired him when he refused to stop a series of stories about the exploitation of fake medical diplomas. Gauvreau went on to be a major figure in the New York City tabloid wars of the Roaring Twenties as the first managing editor of the New York Evening Graphic and later m.e. of the New York Mirror. Emile Gauvreau, My Last Million Readers (Dutton, 1941) Herbert Brucker was the most prominent editor in the 20th century.Herbert Brucker, Journalist, eyewitness to history (Macmillan, 1962) ===Recent history=== The Courant was purchased in 1979 by Times Mirror, the Los Angeles Times parent company. The first years of out-of-town ownership are described by a former Courant reporter in a book titled Spiked: How Chain Management Corrupted America's Oldest Newspaper. One criticism was that the new owners were more interested in awards, and less interested in traditional Courant devotion to exhaustive coverage of local news. The Courant won a 1992 Pulitzer Prize for inquiring into problems with the Hubble Space Telescope (a Connecticut company was involved in the construction), and it won a 1999 Pulitzer Prize in the Breaking News category for coverage of a 1998 murder- suicide that took five lives at Connecticut Lottery headquarters.

By then the Courant had acquired the Valley Advocate group of \"alternative\" weeklies started by two former Courant staff members in 1973. Tribune also owned two local television stations: Fox affiliate WTIC-TV and The CW affiliate WCCT-TV. In 2005, The Courant became the most recent American newspaper to win the Society for News Design's World's Best Designed Newspaper award.\"'Die Zeit': World's Best Designed Newspaper 2004 Auszeichnung erhalten\" March 2, 2005 medienhandbuch.de accessed May 4, 2010 In 2006, the paper's investigation into mental health and suicides among Americans serving in the Iraq war was featured in the PBS documentary series Expos\u00e9: America's Investigative Reports in an episode entitled \"Question 7.\" In late June 2006, the Tribune Co. announced that Courant publisher Jack W. Davis Jr. would by replaced by Stephen D. Carver, vice president and general manager of Atlanta, Ga., TV station WATL. In March 2009, Tribune replaced Carver with Richard Graziano, who was given a dual role as Courant publisher and general manager of Tribune's two Hartford television stations. In May of the same year, Tribune announced that Jeff Levine, a newspaper executive with a background in marketing, would become \"director of content\" and that the editor or \"print platform manager\" of the Courant would report to Levine as would the news director of WTIC-TV. Shortly after that, the Courant's two highest ranking editors were let go.Staff, \"Check Out The New 'Mr. Content'\" New Haven Independent May 17, 2009http://www.hartfordadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=13039 After 2010, Courant has offered early retirement and buyout packages to reduce staff as it continues to experience declines in advertising revenue. There have also been layoffs and reduction in pages. Newsroom staff peaked in 1994 at close to 400 staff, down to 175 staff by 2008, and 135 staff in 2009. Tribune Company brought frequent changes in the Courant's top leadership. On Nov. 18, 2013 Tribune appointed Nancy Meyer as Publisher, succeeding Rich Graziano who left to become President/General Manager of WPIX-TV (PIX11) in New York City.
