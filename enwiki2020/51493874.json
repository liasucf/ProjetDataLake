(:large-toothed hazel-like elm), in cultivation before 1830. Green thought it a synonym of 'Cornuta'. 'Grandidentata' may be synonymous with U. glabra 'Corylifolia' (:hazel-leaved elm), which Green thought another synonym of 'Cornuta'. ==Description== The name implies distinctively large marginal teeth, perhaps differing from the 'horns' of 'Cornuta'. ==Pests and diseases== 'Grandidenta' is susceptible to Dutch Elm disease. ==Cultivation== No authoritatively identified specimens are known to survive. ===Putative specimens=== A mature open-grown large-toothed U. glabra cultivar, matching a 1903 herbarium leaf-specimen mislabelled U. montana cucullata (see External links), stands in Niddrie Mains Road, Edinburgh (grafted at ground level; girth 1.4 m) (2016). The large teeth are present along the whole leaf-margin of short shoot-leaves as well as long (see 'Cornuta'). Though 'Cornuta'-like teeth may occur near the apex, they are rare, and do not resemble the slender 'horns' that usually appear in 'Cornuta' photographs. The tree is narrow-pyramidal, with upswept branches like a Huntingdon Elm.Google Maps: 260 Niddrie Mains Rd - Google Maps (July 2012), accessdate: September 4, 2016 File:Possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh (3).jpg|Possible 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh File:Possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh (2).jpg|Leaves of same File:Short shoot leaves of possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata'.jpg|Dried short-shoot leaves of same (August) File:Long shoot leaves of possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata'.jpg|Dried long-shoot leaves File:Possible Ulmus glabra 'Grandidentata', Edinburgh (4).jpg|Bole ==Synonymy== *Ulmus corylacea var. grandidentata: Dumortier, Florula Belgica, 25, 1827 ? *Ulmus Montana (: glabra) var. corylifolia: Zapalowicz, Conspectus Florae Galiciae Criticus 2: 98, 1908 ? ==References== ==External links== * Sheet described as U. montana cucullata [error for 'cornuta' (?)] (1903) Category:Wych elm cultivar Category:Ulmus articles with images Category:Ulmus ",
