It is housed in the h\u00f4tel d'Ansembourg on F\u00e9ronstr\u00e9e in the historic heart of the city. ==History== Its collections originated as part of those of the Institut arch\u00e9ologique li\u00e9geois (IAL), founded on 4 April 1850. Its archaeological and decorative arts collections were displayed in the Prince- Bishops' Palace, then in the university library, then in l'\u00c9mulation (the headquarters of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 libre d'\u00e9mulation, a literary, artistic and scientific society) and finally in a gallery solely devoted to the IAL's collections in one of the wings of the Palace on 12 October 1874. Fisen, Portrait of the artist and his family, 1722 In 1901 the city council and the IAL acquired the Curtius Palace to house the city's archaeological and decorative arts collections - the archaeology and some of the decorative arts objects are still on display there as the Curtius Museum. On 12 February 1903 the city council bought the h\u00f4tel d'Ansembourg, which it restored and opened on 10 July 1905 as a museum of 18th century decorative arts, especially furniture. The museum owns one of the most important collections of furniture in the Li\u00e8ge-Aachen Style, a regional variant of Baroque furniture art. They are displayed in period rooms of different eras. The museum also has an important collection of 17th-19th century paintings, sculptures and drawings by G\u00e9rard de Lairesse, Nicolaas Verkolje, Jean-Baptiste Coclers, Th\u00e9odore- Edmond Plumier (Portrait of Prince William of Hesse, 1720), Englebert Fisen (including a self portrait), Louis-Michel van Loo, L\u00e9onard Defrance (Women Drinking Coffee, 1763), Jean Delcour (Madonna and Child) and Louis-F\u00e9lix Rh\u00e9nasteine. ==Bibliography== * Joseph Philippe, \u00ab Peinture d\u00e9corative et polychromie li\u00e9geoises du xviiie si\u00e8cle.
