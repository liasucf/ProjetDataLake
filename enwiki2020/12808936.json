    "text": "Axel Laurent Angel Lambert Witsel (born 12 January 1989) is a Belgian professional footballer who plays for German club Borussia Dortmund. During his play for the Belgium national team, he came into the first team as a right-winger, and can also play attacking midfielder, though his natural position is as a central midfielder. He began his career at hometown club Standard Li\u00e8ge, making 183 appearances and scoring 42 goals while winning five domestic trophies. He was awarded the Belgian Golden Shoe in 2008. After a season in Portugal with Benfica, he signed for Zenit Saint Petersburg for a \u20ac40 million fee in 2012. Witsel won four honours during his time in Russia, before leaving for Tianjin Quanjian in January 2017. He returned to Europe with Borussia Dortmund in August 2018. Witsel made his senior international debut in 2008 and earned his 100th cap for Belgium on 15 November 2018. He represented the country at the 2014 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2016 and the 2018 FIFA World Cup, helping them to third place in the last tournament. ==Club career== ===Standard Li\u00e8ge=== On 17 September 2006, a 17-year-old Witsel made his debut with Standard Li\u00e8ge during a competitive game against FC Brussels when he replaced Steven Defour in the 89th minute. Eleven days later, he made his European debut as a substitute. During the 2007\u201308 season, at 18 years of age, he was a key member in the squad of Standard Li\u00e8ge, winners of the Belgian League title that year. During this year, he formed a very young midfield together with other Belgian talents Defour and Marouane Fellaini. In the following season, he scored the winning goal from the penalty spot in a two-legged playoff to decide the championship. On 30 August 2009, Witsel sparked controversy when he broke Marcin Wasilewski's leg by stamping on his ankle during the match between Anderlecht and Standard. Following the tackle, Witsel protested the red card, claiming that it was an accident without intent, before being sent off the pitch. He soon apologised, but was the subject of criticism from several media outlets and numerous death threats from angry Anderlecht and Poland fans. The initial ban until 23 November by the Belgian Football Association, was later reduced on appeal to eight matches. ===Benfica=== Witsel signed for Portuguese club Benfica on a five- year deal on 13 July 2011, including a \u20ac40 million buyout clause. Witsel scored twice in the 3\u20131 win against FC Twente, in the Champions League play- off second leg, on 24 August 2011, sending Benfica to the group stages with a 5\u20133 aggregate victory.

He scored his first two goals for the club on 30 November when Zenit brushed aside Spartak Moscow 4\u20132 at the Luzhniki Stadium. Witsel scored Zenit's winner against Terek Grozny on 30 March 2013, an eighth-minute strike, as his side cruised to a 3\u20130 league victory.

On 26 April, Witsel scored the game's only goal in the seventeenth minute as Zenit defeated Arsenal Tula in a league match at the Petrovsky Stadium. On Sunday 17 May, Witsel played the full 90 minutes as Zenit drew 1\u20131 with FC Ufa, earning the point they needed to secure the Premier League crown, the club's fourth overall and Witsel's first with Zenit.

On 4 March 2017, Witsel made his debut for Quanjian in a 2\u20130 loss to Guangzhou R&F.; A week later he scored the club's first ever goal in the Chinese Super League during a 1\u20131 draw with Shanghai Greenland Shenhua. ===Borussia Dortmund=== On 6 August 2018, Witsel signed for Bundesliga club Borussia Dortmund and agreed a four-year contract which lasts until 30 June 2022.

However, Belgian hopes of qualifying for UEFA Euro 2012 were dashed on 11 October 2011, by defeat to Germany coupled with Turkey's victory over Azerbaijan. On 13 May 2014, Witsel was named in Belgium's squad for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. He started in midfield in the team's first game of the tournament, a 2\u20131 win against Algeria in Belo Horizonte.
