katakana. This could seem to be stylistically odd from a modern perspective, as katakana is nowadays (usually) only used in Japanese writing to denote foreign words. However, at the time, katakana rather than hiragana was the preferred syllabary. The limited use of kanji might be viewed as a move to make his poem more accessible to the rural folk of northern Japan with whom he spent his life, or perhaps as similar to American poet E. E. Cummings's style in using primarily lower case. == Notes == * It is important to note that cold summers in Japan mean a poorer harvest, hence the line \"when the summer is cold, wandering upset.\" * The transliteration above is not direct, and uses a modern romaji rendering. Miyazawa wrote in the orthography common to his time, where \u30b3\u30cf\u30ac\u30e9\u30ca\u30af\u30c6 (kohagaranakute) would today be rendered as \u30b3\u30ef\u30ac\u30e9\u30ca\u30af\u30c6 (kowagaranakute), \u30a4\u30d2 (ihi) as \u30a4\u30a4 (ii), and \u30b5\u30a6 (sau) as \u30bd\u30a6 (sou). * \"hidori\" in \"hidori no toki ha namida wo nagashi\" is generally taken as a simple typo, as Miyazawa made similar typos in his other works. But since hidori means the daily wages of day laborers in the dialect of Hanamaki, some people believe the true meaning of this verse is that Miyazawa cries out of sympathy with the poor farmers who have to work as day laborers. ==See also== *Buddhist poetry ==References== ==External links== * Be not Defeated by the Rain, a translation by David Sulz * Unperturbed by the Rain, a translation by Steven P.
