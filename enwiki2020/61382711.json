The Commission on Human Rights (CHR) has called for the government to stop the killings and also urged the government to investigate the incident.

Albayalde has also raised the possibility that the CPP and its armed wing the New People's Army which places the blame for the killings to the government were responsible for the deaths as part of the group's propaganda. Senators Leila de Lima and Risa Hontiveros have expressed concern over the killings occurred in the province. Bishops Gerardo Alminaza, Julito Cortes, Patricio Buzon and Louie Galbines of San Carlos, Dumaguete, Bacolod and Kabankalan, respectively urged for the end to the killings and for those behind the incidents held responsible. Col. Raul Tacaca was relieved from his provincial police chief of Negros Oriental following the April 2019 killings. He was reinstated on April 30, 2019 but was relieved again in July 2019 after a series of killings occurred on that month. The Philippine National Police launched an investigation whether there were lapses on Tacaca's part on dealing with the killing incidents. There were calls to impose martial law in Negros island following the July killings, but PNP chief Albayalde has said on July 29, 2019 that there will be no such declaration despite the situation in Negros Oriental. On August 20, the United Methodist Church said that the deployment of additional troop forces \"complicated the already worsening human rights situation\" in the island. ==See also== *Escalante massacre == References == Category:Extrajudicial killings Category:Anti-communist terrorism Category:Mass murder in the Philippines Category:2017 crimes in the Philippines Category:2018 crimes in the Philippines Category:2019 crimes in the Philippines Category:History of Negros Occidental Category:History of Negros Oriental Category:Mass murder in 2017 Category:Mass murder in 2018 Category:Mass murder in 2019 ",
