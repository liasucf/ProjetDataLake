After Condon put in a good word with the New York State Athletic Commission, they started using him as a ringside judge. Before long, he had his first assignment as a referee in a four-round bout at the Felt Forum (a part of Madison Square Garden). Neumann is now a widely respected figure within the boxing community and has worked in the ring for 50+ title fights involving champions including Mike Tyson, Wladimir Klitschko, Meldrick Taylor, Buddy McGirt, Chris Byrd, Evander Holyfield, John Ruiz, and many others. ==Writer== Neumann wrote an article about a fight that he had against Chuck Wepner in Madison Square Garden that was published in the July 1974 issue of Sport magazine. He wrote 13 columns about boxing for the sports section of the New York Times. He wrote stories of boxing The New York Post, The New York News Magazine, Forbes, Signature, Harper's, New Jersey Monthly and other magazines. In 1988 he began writing a financial column for the Hudson Dispatch. Over the years he has syndicated the column in several newspapers. His latest book, \"Fighting for your Financial Future - Round Two\" is available for purchase. ==References== ==External links== * * Referee record Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Boxers from New Jersey Category:American boxing referees Category:Fairleigh Dickinson University alumni Category:People from Cliffside Park, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Bergen County, New Jersey Category:American male boxers Category:Heavyweight boxers ",
