    "text": "The Isles of Scilly are an archipelago off Land's End, Cornwall. Little of the fauna on, above or in the seas surrounding the isles was described prior to the 19th century, when birds and fish started to be described. Most records of other animals date from the 20th century onwards. ==Historical overview== There are few pre-19th-century records for animals. William Borlase published The Natural History of Cornwall in 1758, commenting on the number of rabbits, and Jonathan Couch's A Cornish Fauna gave an account of some the animals known in Cornwall and the Isles of Scilly. In the 19th century, following the fashion of the time, birds were shot and stuffed, especially by Augustus Smith and his predecessors on Tresco. Egg collecting was allowed and in the Natural History Museum there are, in the collection, forty-five eggs taken between 1880 and 1936 from Annett, even though it was a bird sanctuary.Robinson, P. (2003) The Birds of the Isles of Scilly. London: Christopher Helm. Newspapers recorded some of the fish caught but there was little recording of other groups of animals. It was in the 20th century when regular accounts can be found for other animal groups following visits from naturalists who often published their observations in the scientific literature. For example, William Bristow visited the islands on three occasions from 1927\u20131934, recording spiders including on some of the uninhabited islands. The Cornwall Bird Watching and Preservation Society published bird reports from the 1930s onwards and the Isles of Scilly Bird Group (founded 2000) took over publishing their own annual reports \u2013 Isles of Scilly Bird and Natural History Review \u2013 which included other groups of animals such as the diptera. ==Planarian (flatworms)== Fourteen species of terrestrial flatworms have been recorded in Britain and Ireland with five found on the Isles of Scilly. Only three or four of the fourteen species are native with two recorded on Tresco. * The Australian flatworm (Australoplana sanguinea) \u2013 a flatworm from Australia and New Zealand and first found on Tresco in 1960. Now found in many parts of Britain. Feeds on earthworms. * Australopacifica coxii \u2013 a flatworm from Australia and found on Tresco in 1975. Feeds on earthworms. * Kontikia andersoni \u2013 found on Tresco in 1984; it is native to Australia and/or New Zealand. * Microplana terrestris \u2013 recorded on Tresco (1982). Native * Microplana scharffi \u2013 recorded on Tresco (1984) and St Mary's (1985). Native ==Opiliones (harvestmen)== * Dicranopalpus ramosus * Leiobunum blackwalli \u2013 found on all the inhabited islands, Annet and Great Innisvouls. * Leiobunum rotundum \u2013 recorded on Tean, Tresco and St Martin's. * Nelima gothica \u2013 found on St Mary's and Tresco. * Nelima silvatica * Opilio saxatilis * Phalangium opilio \u2013 found on St Martin's, St Mary's, Samson and Tresco. ==Odonata== The Atlas of the Dragonflies of Britain and Ireland published in 1996 listed just three species; blue-tailed damselfly, common darter (both breeding residents) and the migrant hawker. The pools can be slightly brackish at times and only species that can tolerate these conditions can establish populations on the islands. Steve Jones compiled a list which was published in the Cornwall Dragonfly Group Newsletter (numbers 6\u20138) and the list below is based on that information. In comparison, at that time, Cornwall had 23 breeding species and 28 species recorded. * Common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) \u2013 in 1994 an ovipositing female was at Lower Moors, St Mary's. * Blue-tailed damselfly (Ischnura elegans) \u2013 can tolerate brackish conditions and breeds on St Agnes, St Mary's and Tresco. * Migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) \u2013 increased sightings since the mid-1990s on St Agnes, St Mary's and Tresco. * Southern hawker (A. cyanea) \u2013 recorded on St Mary's in October 1992 and October 1996 and from Tresco also in October 1996. * Common hawker (A. juncea) \u2013 Great Pool, Tresco in October 1992. * Emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator) \u2013 individuals seen on St Mary's, September 1992 and August 1996. * Green darner (A. junius) \u2013 At least two individuals (male and female) were found on St Agnes on 10 September 1998 (just one day after the first record for the Western Palaearctic in Cornwall, the previous day). There was a male on St Mary's during the following week and a female on Tresco on 30 September and the next day. * Golden-ringed dragonfly (Cordulegaster boltonii) \u2013 October 1996 on Tresco. * Red-veined darter (Sympetrum fonscolombii) \u2013 two males on Great Pool, Tresco, May 1992. * Yellow-winged darter (S. flaveolum) \u2013 one seen on St Mary's during the \u2033Invasion Year\u2033 of 1995. * Common darter (S. striolatum) \u2013 breeding on St Agnes, St Mary's and Tresco. ==Orthopteroid== The Orthopteroids have been recorded in Scilly since 1890 and specialists have visited the islands since 1989 to give, what is considered, complete coverage of these insects. The list below is taken from Orthopteroid Insects on Scilly (2001) with additional records referenced. ===Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers)=== * Oak bush- cricket (Meconema thalassinum) \u2013 one seen on Tresco in 1960. * Great green bush-cricket (Tettigonia viridissima) \u2013 resident on St Mary's and Tresco and probably an Aller\u00f8d pioneer. * Dark bush-cricket (Pholidoptera griseoaptera) \u2013 one seen on Tresco in 1906. * Grey bush-cricket (Platycleis albopunctata) \u2013 resident on Bryher and a probable Aller\u00f8d pioneer.
