    "text": "Copper(I) hydroxide is the hydroxide of the metal copper with the chemical formula of CuOH. It is a mild, highly unstable alkali. The color of pure CuOH is yellow or orange-yellow, but it usually appears rather dark red because of impurities. It is extremely easily oxidized even at room temperature. NaOH == Preparation == Copper(I) hydroxide can be prepared according to the following reaction: : \\overbrace\\ce{32S2O3^2-}^\\ce{thiosulfate} + \\ce{{32Cu^2+} + 16H2O ->[\\overbrace\\ce{CH3CH2OH}^\\ce{ethanol}] 32CuOH (v)} + \\overbrace\\ce{3S8}^\\ce{sulfur} + \\overbrace\\ce{8S4O6^2-}^\\ce{tetrathionate} + \\overbrace\\ce{8SO4^2-}^\\ce{sulfate} In this reaction, ethanol serves as a catalyst. It can also be a solvent for the byproduct sulfur and thus get rid of it. Another method is by the double displacement of CuCl and NaOH\uff1a : CuCl + NaOH <=> NaCl + CuOH v Notably, this method is rarely used because the CuOH produced will gradually dehydrate and eventually turn into Cu2O. == Reactions == Similar to iron(II) hydroxide , copper(I) hydroxide can easily oxidise into copper(II) hydroxide: : 4CuOH + 2H2O + O2 <=> 4Cu(OH)2 ==References== Category:Copper(I) compounds Category:Hydroxides ",
