It tells of how the man is made to realise on becoming rich that God certainly does not neglect his faithful and wealth only brings sorrow and pain with it.

The play, which was written for actor V. Gopalakrishnan's Gopi Theatres, intended to convey the message that \"money could not buy peace of mind\". When adapting the play as a film, the makers wanted Sivaji Ganesan as the male lead. But Ganesan suggested Srinivasan, after being impressed with his performance in the play. Vaali wrote the dialogue for the film adaptation, which was produced by N. Elango. Jaishankar and Jayachitra were cast as the male and female lead respectively. Cinematography was handled by S. Maruti Rao. Besides directing, Panju co-edited the film (alongside Narasimhan) under the pseudonym \"Panjabi\". The final cut of the film measured . == Soundtrack == The soundtrack was composed by V.
