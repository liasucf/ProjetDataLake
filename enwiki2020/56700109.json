The book is a sequel to his 2006 book An Inconvenient Truth, published concurrently with his documentary of the same name. It was published on July 25, 2017 by Rodale Books. ==Synopsis== The book is intended to encourage and inform readers on how they can help fight anthropogenic global warming and climate change, and is a more in-depth analysis than the film. The book describes how humans have further damaged the environment since the release of An Inconvenient Truth, and makes more predictions about what will happen in the near future if humans fail to act. The book also describes advancements that have been made so far in the effort against global warming, such as developments in alternative energy sources. The book explores other aspects of the climate crisis, such as climate change denial and the corporate influence of money in politics, and ends by reasoning that it is not too late to solve the crisis. ==Reception== ==References== Category:Books by Al Gore Category:2017 non-fiction books Category:2017 in the environment Category:Climate change books Category:Rodale, Inc. books Category:Books about politics of the United States Category:American non-fiction books ",
