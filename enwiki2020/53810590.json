    "text": "\"Follow the Rules'\" is a 1996 song recorded by Italian electronic music group Livin' Joy. The song was released as the third single from the album, Don't Stop Movin and was the follow-up to the 1995 single, \"Don't Stop Movin'\" which had been a big number-one hit in Italy. The single proved to be a moderate success for Livin' Joy across Europe; peaking at number 3 in Italy, number 9 in the UK and number 12 in Finland. In Ireland, it reached number 28 and in Sweden number 29. On the Eurochart Hot 100, \"Follow the Rules\" peaked at number 27 in November 1996. Outside Europe, it reached number 8 in Israel and number 73 in Australia. The song can be described as an anthemic dance track based around the message of following your dreams and making them come true. In style it was similar to \"Don't Stop Movin'\", but with a heavier piano house/organ sound. ==Critical reception== Pop Rescue wrote that the song \"has some delicious Italia House piano over a great dance beat\", adding it as \"a positive uplifting track\". ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
