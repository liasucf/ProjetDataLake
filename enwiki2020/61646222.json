    "text": "The Journal of Modern Dynamics is a peer-reviewed scientific journal of mathematics published by the American Institute of Mathematical Sciences with the support of the Anatole Katok Center for Dynamical Systems and Geometry (Pennsylvania State University). The editor-in-chief is Giovanni Forni (University of Maryland College Park). ==History== The journal was established in 2007 with Anatole Katok as the founding editor-in-chief. It covers the theory of dynamical systems with particular emphasis on the mutual interaction between dynamics and other major areas of mathematical research: number theory, symplectic geometry, differential geometry, rigidity, quantum chaos, Teichm\u00fcller theory, geometric group theory, and harmonic analysis on manifolds. Until 2015 the journal was published quarterly. Since then, accepted papers are published online first and a single printed volume is published yearly. ==Abstracting and indexing== The journal is abstracted and indexed in: *Current Contents/Physical, Chemical & Earth Sciences *EBSCO databases *MathSciNet *Science Citation Index Expanded *Scopus *Zentralblatt MATH According to MathSciNet, the journal has a 2018 Mathematical Citation Quotient of 0.89. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Mathematics journals Category:Publications established in 2007 Category:English-language journals Category:Continuous journals ",
