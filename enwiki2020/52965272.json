    "text": "Neil K. Garg is currently a professor of chemistry and holds the Kenneth N. Trueblood Endowed Chair at the University of California, Los Angeles. Garg's research is focused on the chemical synthesis of organic compounds, with an emphasis on the development of new strategies for the preparation of complex molecules possessing unique structural, biological, and physical properties. His group has made breakthroughs in catalysis and in the understanding and utilization of strained intermediates, such as arynes, cyclic alkynes, and cyclic allenes. His laboratory has completed the total syntheses of many natural products, including welwitindolinones, akuammilines, and tubingensin alkaloids. He has inspired a series of student-created music videos to encourage students to learn organic chemistry. He has led other innovative projects, such as the Organic Coloring Book, the Backside Attack smartphone app, QR Chem, and Biology And Chemistry Online Notes (BACON). ==Education== Garg received his B.S. from New York University in 2000. He went on to earn his Ph.D. at the California Institute of Technology, where he studied organic chemistry under the supervision of Brian Stoltz as an NDSEG Fellow, completing his studies in 2005. Upon completion of his graduate work, he held an NIH post-doctoral appointment in the laboratory of Larry Overman at University of California - Irvine from 2005 to 2007. ==Awards and honors== * James Flack Norris Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Teaching of Chemistry, 2019 https://www.chemistry.ucla.edu/news/acs-james-flack-norris-teaching-award * US Defense Science Study Group (DSSG 2020-2021), 2019 * New York University\u2019s Distinguished Alumnus Award, 2019 https://www.nyu.edu/alumni/news- publications/nyu-connect-newsletter/february-2019/2019-alumni-award- honorees.html * ASBMB Award for Exemplary Contributions to Education, 2019 * Fellow of the American Chemical Society, 2018 * Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teaching, 2018 * Robert Foster Cherry Award for Great Teaching, Finalist, 2017 * Royal Society of Chemistry's Higher Education Award, 2017 * American Chemical Society Elias J.
