Two different versions were produced, the YD-A and YD-B with stroke ratio specifications of 54x54mm and 56x50mm respectively. The light weight of the bike made it very formidable in terms of handling and acceleration compared to rival bikes of the era, such as the Honda RC71.http://app.mobilityland.co.jp/hch/search/english/?action_english_detail=1&productid;=246&type;=age&genreid;=10&modelid;=1 In 1957, the YD1 won 1st-3rd place at the 2nd All Japan Autobike Endurance Road Race (Asama Highlands Race).http://global.yamaha- motor.com/about/history/1950/ ==References== YD1 Category:Grand Prix motorcycles ",
