He does not know how he came there, but recalls that he was sick in bed. He worries that he has wandered out of doors in a state of insensibility.

He follows an ancient paved road, and sees the disassembled remnants of tombstones and tombs. He comes across a lynx, an owl, and a strange man dressed in animal skins carrying a torch, who ignores the narrator. For the first time, the man becomes aware that it must be night, though he can see as clear as day. The man sits near a tree whose roots emerge from a grave. Looking at the stone that once marked the grave, he sees his name, the date of his birth, and the date of his death.
