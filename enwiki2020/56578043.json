When she was five, she first started playing piano and then started playing the violin. She kept learning other instruments, such as viola and cello, and played with both family and in an orchestra, as well as a jazz band. Schachner went to the Berklee College of Music and then moved to Los Angeles. She began to work with composer Brian Tyler, who worked in film and then started writing video game music. Tyler first brought Schachner in to work on Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3. Schachner said, \"I started doing music on the games for him and I realized how much I loved working on games.\" Schachner began to incorporate synthesizers with her work on string instruments. In 2016, Ted Cruz's presidential campaign used one of Schachner's songs, Lens, without permission. As the composer, she and the performer, along with a licensing firm, sued the Cruz campaign in May 2016 for copyright infringement. Schachner also contributed to the Cassini Finale Music Project, a commemoration of the Cassini mission to Saturn. ==Discography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! Year ! Title !
