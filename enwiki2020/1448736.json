    "text": "Corey Mitchell Hart (born May 31, 1962) is a Canadian singer-songwriter, known for his hit singles \"Sunglasses at Night\" and \"Never Surrender\". He has sold over 16 million records worldwide and recorded nine US Billboard Top 40 hits. In Canada, 30 of Hart's recordings have been Top 40 hits, including 11 in the Top 10, over the course of over 35 years in the music industry. Nominated for the Grammy Award for Best New Artist in 1984, Hart is an inductee of both Canada's Music Hall of Fame and Canada's Walk of Fame, and is also a multiple Juno award nominee and winner, including the Diamond Award for his best- selling album Boy in the Box. He has also been honoured by the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP) and the Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada (SOCAN). ==Early life== Hart was born on May 31, 1962, in Montreal, Quebec, the youngest of five children of Mina (n\u00e9e Weber) and Robert Hart, both Montreal natives. His paternal grandfather was a Ukrainian Jewish immigrant, while Corey's mother was from a Romanian Jewish family. Hart's parents separated when he was 10 years old. Hart then returned to Montreal to live with his mother and older brother Robbie. He shared an especially close relationship with his mother, to whom Hart's first album was dedicated.First Offense, liner notes, 1983. Hart had little contact with his father, and this is reflected in some of his compositions, such as the 1998 song \"Reconcile\".\"Corey Hart haunted by the father who 'bailed out' on him\". Brendan Kelly, Montreal Gazette, June 14, 2019 Hart's first experience as a performing artist came at age 11, when he sang \"Ben\" for Tom Jones in Miami. He also recorded songs with Paul Anka in Las Vegas during this time period. In 1980, Hart represented Canada in the World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo (along with singer Dan Hill), marking his first public performance of original material. Back in Canada, Hart reached out to Billy Joel who was on tour in the Montreal area at the time. Joel's backup band contacted him and Hart ended up recording several demos with them in Long Island, New York. Hart worked with several other Canadian studio musicians on demos before finally signing to the Aquarius Records label in 1982 at the age of 20. Several songs on his first album, including \"The World Is Fire\", reflect the rejections and difficulties Hart encountered along the path to getting a recording contract.Phoenix Gazette, October 3, 1984. ==Recording career== ===\"Sunglasses at Night\" and First Offense=== Hart's debut album, First Offense, was recorded at Revolution Recording Studios in Manchester, England in the spring of 1982. It was produced by Jon Astley, then best known for his work with The Who, and Phil Chapman. Released in 1983, First Offense featured the US Billboard Top 10 hit song \"Sunglasses at Night\" (No. 7) and Top 20 follow-up single \"It Ain't Enough\" (No. 17). The album went platinum in the United States and quadruple platinum in Canada. First Offense initially received a modest response upon its Canadian release. It was only after garnering US success in the summer of 1984 that he became well known in his native Canada. First Offense also featured guitarist Eric Clapton on the record's closing track, \"Jenny Fey\". > Jon (Astley, producer) felt there was one song Eric Clapton would really > like. So just out of the blue he sent him the song, and lo and behold Eric > Clapton was on the phone saying he wanted to play on it and asking how I > would mind if he did. I didn't. Eric was the classic gentleman. Here I was, > this Canadian kid in England with big-time producers doing my first album > and Clapton tells me, 'It's such a pretty song, so easy to play. The type of > thing I'd write myself'.Georgia Straight, May 4, 1984. The Juno-award-winning video for \"Sunglasses at Night\" (directed by Rob Quartly) which featured a futuristic, Orwellian society helped propel the popularity of the track. Hart toured the United States and Canada extensively in 1984 and early 1985, first as a supporting act for Culture Club, April Wine, Thomas Dolby, Hall & Oates and Rick Springfield, then later as a headline performer. First Offense was nominated for Best Album of the Year at that year's ADISQ Awards in Hart's native Quebec, where the singer was also nominated for Best New Artist. First Offense won the F\u00e9lix. ===\"Never Surrender\", Boy in the Box and Fields of Fire=== Hart's second album was Boy in the Box, released in June 1985, which reached Diamond status in Canada (one million copies sold) by February 1986. It was the second album by a Canadian artist to do so.Hart Hits Diamond Figure, Kirk LaPointe, Billboard, February 22, 1986, pp. 63\u201364. The album featured the hit single \"Never Surrender\" which spent nine consecutive weeks at No. 1 in Canada and peaked at No. 3 on the US Billboard Hot 100, also earning Hart an ASCAP Award as one of the most played songs of 1985. \"Never Surrender\" was the No. 2 song in the year-end Canadian charts in 1985, finishing second to the Northern Lights charity single \"Tears Are Not Enough\" in which Hart had also participated, alongside veteran Canadian artists Gordon Lightfoot, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell and Bryan Adams. Subsequent singles all charted in the Canadian and US Top 40 (\"Boy in the Box\", \"Everything in My Heart\" and \"Eurasian Eyes\"). In the US, Boy in the Box peaked at No. 20 on the Billboard 200 albums chart and went platinum. Boy in the Box was nominated for a Juno Award as well as an ADISQ Award for Best Album, taking home a F\u00e9lix for Hart in this category. \"Never Surrender\" won the Juno for Best Selling Single of 1985. Hart was also nominated for the Composer of the Year award at both the Junos and the ADISQ awards, winning a F\u00e9lix in this field. He also received nods in the Juno categories of Best Video for \"Never Surrender\" and Best Male Vocalist of the Year, as well an ADISQ nomination for Concert of the Year. Hart also won the F\u00e9lix for the Quebec artist achieving the most success outside Quebec in the Anglophone market, along with Best Male Artist. The following year Hart received Juno nominations for Composer of the Year and Best Selling Single for \"Everything in My Heart\". In 1984 and 1985 Hart toured extensively in North America and Japan in support of Boy in the Box: Exhibition Stadium in Toronto, the Budokan in Tokyo, the Calgary Scotiabank Saddledome and the Forum in Montreal.Shades official fan club newsletter, Vol. 1 No. 1, Fall 1984 and Vo1. 1 No. 3, Summer 1985. He appeared frequently on Good Rockin' Tonite (Canada), Friday Night Videos and MTV (US), and Music Life (Japan), and toured Europe and Australasia.CBC News, February 1985. Fields of Fire, Hart's third album release, came out in fall 1986 and went double platinum in Canada and achieved gold status in the US. It featured the US Top 20 hit single \"I Am By Your Side\", as well as the Canadian No. 1 single \"Can't Help Falling in Love\", originally performed by Elvis Presley. This was the first recorded cover version of a song Hart had released. The song was also a top 10 hit in the Philippines and Japan. Critics generally agreed that Fields of Fire displayed a new, more mature direction in Hart's songwriting. Fields of Fire earned Hart several nominations at the 1987 Juno Awards, in the categories of Best Male Vocalist of the Year, Best Album Graphics (done by Hart's partner Erika Gagnon), and Single of the Year for \"Can't Help Falling in Love\". The singer was also nominated for Best Male Artist and Album of the Year at that year's ADISQ Awards. Once more Hart launched a world tour in support of the record. He performed sold-out concerts in Japan and made promotional appearances in Europe from fall 1986 through mid-1987. However, Hart's tour had to be halted prematurely in July 1987 after the then 25-year-old singer collapsed backstage from exhaustion after a concert in Canada. After nearly four years of constant touring and recording, he took some time off for rest and recuperation.Shades official fan club newsletter, Vo1. 3, Fall 1987. ===Young Man Running, Bang! and Attitude and Virtue=== Hart returned to songwriting, leading to the singer's fourth album release, Young Man Running.

Young Man Running received an ADISQ nomination for Album of the Year. In early 1989 Hart returned to songwriting in preparation for what would be his final album with EMI America, Bang!. Recorded in Los Angeles, the release debuted in early 1990 to positive reviews and airplay on MTV. Bang! shipped platinum in Canada and hit the Japanese Top 20 two weeks into its release. The first single, \"A Little Love\", hit the US Top 40 in early 1990 and featured another video by Meiert Avis. Bang! also reunited Hart with Ruby Turner and featured drummer Kenny Aronoff (John Cougar Mellencamp) on drums and percussion. Despite the success of the first single (a Top 10 hit in Canada), Bang! was less successful than previous albums in the US;\"Hart ends Hiatus by Baring His Soul\". Billboard, 17 Aug 1996, page 53, by Larry LeBlanc EMI also failed to nominate Hart for any Juno Award categories that year. Hart was released from his contract with the company in August 1990.Hart-Line Official Fan Club newsletter, vol. 2, no. 4, fall 1990. EMI later released a collection of Hart's singles on a compilation album, Singles in 1991. Hart did secure a nomination for Best Male Artist at the 1990 ADISQ awards. Sire Records co- founder Seymour Stein approached Hart at this juncture and eventually signed him to Sire shortly thereafter. What followed was Hart's sole album for the label, Attitude & Virtue. Released in 1992, it appeared on the Top 40 in Canada, and featured several guest musicians including Jane Siberry, Duff McKagan of Guns N' Roses, Terence Trent D'Arby and the return of Ruby Turner. Three singles were released from the album: \"Baby When I Call Your Name\" (released in Canada and the United States), \"92 Days of Rain\" (released in Canada) and \"Always\" (released in Canada and the United States). All three singles charted in the Canadian Top 40. \"Baby When I Call Your Name\" and \"92 Days of Rain\" were accompanied by videos, the latter helmed by Hart's first director, Rob Quartly. The first song on the album, \"Back in the Hand\", summed up the prior decade in a celebration of feeling back in control of his musical career. Hart received Hart a Juno nomination for 1992 Best Male Vocalist of the Year. He then took a break from writing and touring (\"Jane Hawtin Live\", 1997). He released one single, a cover of Edith Piaf's \"Hymn to Love\", in 1994. ==Career rebirth== Hart family, 2007 ===Julie Masse, Corey Hart, Celine Dion and Jade=== Hart presented an award at the Juno Awards of 1993 in Toronto with Julie Masse, a fellow nominee with two platinum selling albums in Quebec, Julie Masse and \u00c0 Contre Jour. Upon seeing them together, Masse's manager suggested that Hart work with her on a new English language album. Hart co- produced and wrote five songs for Masse's gold-selling Circle of One, which was released in Canada in 1994 and marked the first time Hart had written and produced songs for an artist other than himself. This also led to their relationship as husband and wife and parents to four children.Dernier heure (Quebec), January 17, 1998. Hart was previously married to photographer/graphic designer Erika Gagnon from 1990 to 1994, and Masse to cinematographer Sylvain Brault from 1993 to 1994. Following his work with Masse, Hart signed a new contract with Sony Music Canada and in 1996 released an eponymous CD Corey Hart. The album was co-produced by Humberto Gatica and contained some of Hart's most introspective work, spurred by his personal life changes. Sparked by the success of \"Black Cloud Rain\" which reached No. 2 on the Canadian Top 40, Corey Hart went platinum in Canada. The video for \"Black Cloud Rain\" was directed by Javier Aguilera, a young Mexican filmmaker. He toured across the country for the first time since the cancelled 1987 Fields of Fire tour, and subsequent singles from the album (\"Tell Me\", \"Third of June\" and \"Someone\") all reached the Canadian Top 40. Corey Hart also earned Hart more award nominations, including Juno nods for Best Male Vocalist of the Year and Best Producer for \"Black Cloud Rain\" and \"Simplicity\", a non-single album track, and Best Anglophone Quebec Artist at the ADISQ Awards. In 1997, fellow Canadian Celine Dion released her Let's Talk About Love album, which featured the theme from the film Titanic, \"My Heart Will Go On\". Also on the album were two songs written and co-produced by Hart: the Canadian Top 40 hit \"Miles to Go (Before I Sleep)\" and \"Where Is the Love\". As documented in Dion's concert DVD Au c\u0153ur du stade, Dion's team reached out to Hart based on the recent success of Corey Hart in Canada and asked if he would write and produce for the songstress. He was also nominated for the Juno Award for Best Producer for the Dion tracks. Later in 1999 Hart performed live in the US for the first time since the late 1980s as Dion's guest in St. Louis, Missouri and Ft. Lauderdale, Florida.Billboard, October 30, 1999. Hart collaborated with Dion again on \"Prayer\", from her 2002 CD A New Day Has Come. In 1998, Hart released a second album on Sony, Jade, featuring a duet with partner Masse on the Jean-Jacques Goldman song \"L\u00e0-bas\". The lead-off single \"So Visible (Easy to Miss)\" and follow-up release \"Break the Chain\" both charted in the Canadian Top 40, the singer gained yet another Juno Award nomination (for Best Male Vocalist of the Year) and Hart once again toured Canada in support of the album. After enjoying a comeback in Canada in the late 1990s, Hart again came to a personal crossroads. > All I had ever wanted or known since I was a boy was to be creating music. > But I couldn't continue to record or tour if I aspired to be a 24/7 father > to our children. The two worlds simply collide.Corey Hart: The boy leaves > the box to be a good dad, Brendan Kelly, The Gazette (Montreal), May 27, > 2011. At the end of the millennium, Hart once again fell largely silent as he and Masse married and relocated to Nassau, Bahamas, to focus on raising their young family.Columbia's Corey Hart Paints His Pop with a Shade of Jade, Larry Flick, Billboard, November 7, 1998 He returned to Montreal in late 2002 for a two-night stand of concerts with the Montreal Symphony Orchestra, performing songs from Corey Hart and Jade as well as older hits to the accompaniment of the MSO.'80s heartthrob Corey Hart making music, being a dad.

Stein offered Hart a boutique label with Sire/Warner Music Canada, Siena Records. The label, formed in 2003, went through several years of development while Hart pursued a suitable debut artist. He collaborated sporadically on individual songs with French-Canadian artists Garou and Wilfred Le Bouthillier in the mid-2000s, and performed with others including Meggie Lagac\u00e9 on Quebec television.Star Systeme (Quebec), 2006.
