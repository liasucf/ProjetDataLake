Al-Ahly SC has its roots in a political party, the Omar al Mukhtar society. ==History== Al-Ahly SC Libya was made a professional football club in 1947, although they had existed years before then. Al Ahly is the most supported club in Benghazi and is famous in Libya for its passionate, loyal and sometimes violent crowds, who stood by the club through frustrating times. In 2000, the club's headquarters and training complex was demolished by the Libyan government, supposedly destroying records, trophies and medals of the club. The demolition was allegedly carried out in response to Al-Ahly fans insulting Saadi Gaddafi by dressing a donkey in a shirt baring his squad number, but other sources pointed to the burning a few days before of the Libyan Football Federation offices in Benghazi by angry Al-Ahly fans as the matter.Col. Muammar al-Gaddafi, His Son and the Politics of Libyan Soccer Bleacher Report, 23 February 2011 The club was then given an indefinite ban which lasted until 2005. Saadi Gadafi had denied all the allegations. The club has been given of land for a new ground by the Libyan Jamahiriya government, although it cannot afford to develop it. Al Ahly is one of the biggest clubs in Libya, and along with Tripoli's two big clubs. ==Crest== File:Al-Ahly SC Benghazi (logo).png|Former logo Note: Alahly SC (Benghazi) is the only club in Libya which has a star in its logo before reaching 10 league titles. ==Squad== ===Current squad=== The 2013\u201314 seasonAhly squad at HTCI.ly ===Staff=== :* Abdellatif Masoud (Under 19 Team), (Assistant Coach) :* Muhammad Al Bousseffi (First Team), (Goalkeepers Coach) :* Masoud Abdellatif (Under 19 Team), (Head Coach) :* Hashim Alfllah (First Team), (Team Doctor) :* Wanis Kheir (First Team), (Assistant Coach) :* Tarek Thabet (First Team), (Head Coach) ==History== ===Head coaches=== {| |- style=\"vertical-align: top;\" | :* Thomson (Late 60's) :* Mohamed Abdou Saleh El-Wahsh (1969\u201372) :* Nicolae Oaid\u0103 (1972\u201374) :* Ivan Deyanov (1977\u201378) :* Albert Fl\u00f3ri\u00e1n (1978\u201385) :* Abdeljelil Al Hashani (1985\u2013??) :* Ahmed Ben Sawed (1987\u201388) :* ??
