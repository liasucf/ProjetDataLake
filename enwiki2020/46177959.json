    "text": "Ivani\u0161 (, 1348) was a Serbian magnate (velika\u0161) who served Emperor Stefan Du\u0161an (r. 1331\u201355) as despot. He is mentioned in Emperor Du\u0161an's charter of the Monastery of the Holy Archangels near Prizren, dated 1348, in which he calls Ivani\u0161 a \"parent of my Empire\". Not much is known about him, though his high dignitary title and the fact that Du\u0161an called him \"his parent\" without a doubt shows that he was a close relative with the royal family. Ivani\u0161 had possessions in the Toplica region and granted one of his villages to the Monastery. Ivani\u0161 and then his son, Altoman, held a province in Toplica, evidently near the core of the future province of Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107. His son Altoman married a sister of Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107 and had a son, Ivani\u0161, who died between 1372 and 1389, and was buried at Visoki De\u010dani. Some historians earlier believed that Ivani\u0161 was related to Lazar's wife, Milica Nemanji\u0107. Some did also try to connect him to monk Dorotej of Hilandar, who is known to have held the despot title prior to his monastic vows, and was the ktetor of the Dren\u010da Monastery in Rasina, although his secular name is not preserved. ==Family tree== *Ivani\u0161 (d. after 1348) **Altoman ***Ivani\u0161 (d. 1372\u201389) ==References== Category:14th-century Serbian nobility Category:People of the Serbian Empire Category:14th-century births Category:14th-century deaths Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown Category:Despots (court title) Category:Medieval Serbian magnates ",
