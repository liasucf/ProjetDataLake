    "text": "The 1992 Cal State Northridge Matadors football team represented Cal State Northridge during the 1992 NCAA Division II football season. Cal State Northridge competed in the Western Football Conference (WFC). The WFC folded after 1992, in part because of a new NCAA rule that prohibited member institutions who competed at the Division I level in other sports to compete at the Division II level in football. Four WFC members (Cal State Northridge, Sacramento State, Cal Poly, & Southern Utah) joined with UC Davis as charter members of the Division-I American West Conference in 1993. The 1992 Matadors were led by seventh-year head coach Bob Burt. They played home games at North Campus Stadium in Northridge, California. Cal State Northridge finished the season with a record of five wins and five losses (5\u20135, 3\u20132 WFC). The Matadors were outscored by their opponents 161\u2013224 for the season. ==Schedule== ==Team players in the NFL== No Cal State Northridge players were selected in the 1993 NFL Draft. ==Notes== ==References== Cal State Northridge Category:Cal State Northridge Matadors football seasons Cal State Northridge Matadors football ",
