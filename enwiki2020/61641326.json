    "text": "The Bangladesh women's cricket team played the Pakistan women's cricket team in October and November 2019. The tour consisted of two Women's One Day Internationals (WODIs) and three Women's Twenty20 International (WT20I) matches, and all were played at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore. It was the first time that the Pakistan women's team played at the stadium. The Bangladesh women's team last toured Pakistan in September and October 2015. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) opted not to send any of their Indian support staff, to avoid visa issues and political tensions between India and Pakistan. Less than two weeks from the start of the tour, the series was thrown into doubt, after the Bangladesh government had not yet given clearance for the team to travel. However, on 21 October 2019, the BCB confirmed the squads for the tour. The following day, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) confirmed the itinerary for the tour. Pakistan beat Bangladesh in the first two WT20I matches, to take an unassailable lead, and winning the series with one game left. Pakistan won the final WT20I by 28 runs, winning the series 3\u20130. In the WODI series, Pakistan won the first match by 29 runs. Bangladesh won the second match by one wicket, to level the series 1\u20131. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- !colspan=2|WODIs !colspan=2|WT20Is |- ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Bismah Maroof (c) * Sidra Ameen * Diana Baig * Kainat Imtiaz * Sadia Iqbal * Iram Javed * Javeria Khan * Nahida Khan * Sana Mir * Sidra Nawaz (wk) * Aliya Riaz * Fatima Sana * Nashra Sandhu * Syeda Aroob Shah * Umaima Sohail | * Rumana Ahmed (c) * Nahida Akter * Sharmin Akhter * Jahanara Alam * Panna Ghosh * Fargana Hoque * Sanjida Islam * Fahima Khatun * Murshida Khatun * Salma Khatun * Khadija Tul Kubra * Sanjida Akter Meghla * Nigar Sultana (wk) * Shamima Sultana * Sharmin Sultana | * Bismah Maroof (c) * Sidra Ameen * Anam Amin * Diana Baig * Kainat Imtiaz * Sadia Iqbal * Iram Javed * Javeria Khan * Nahida Khan * Sana Mir * Saba Nazir * Sidra Nawaz (wk) * Aliya Riaz * Umaima Sohail * Ayesha Zafar | * Salma Khatun (c) * Rumana Ahmed * Sharmin Akhter * Jahanara Alam * Panna Ghosh * Fargana Hoque * Sanjida Islam * Khadija Tul Kubra * Sanjida Akter Meghla * Ekka Mollik * Lata Mondal * Ayasha Rahman * Nigar Sultana * Shamima Sultana (wk) * Sharmin Sultana |} Labone Akther, Nahida Akter, Happy Alam, Sabinkun Nahar Jesmin, Fahima Khatun, Ritu Moni, Sobhana Mostary and Zinnat Asia Orthi were also named as standby players for Bangladesh. ==WT20I series== ===1st WT20I=== ===2nd WT20I=== ===3rd WT20I=== ==WODI series== ===1st WODI=== ===2nd WODI=== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2019 in women's cricket Category:2019 in Bangladeshi cricket Category:2019 in Pakistani cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2019\u201320 Pakistan 2019-30 Bangladesh 2019-20 ",
