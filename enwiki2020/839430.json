Since the middle of the Ming Dynasty there have been commercial activities in the area. In the Qing Dynasty, ten aristocratic estates and princess residence were built here, soon after when a well full of sweet water was discovered, thereby giving the street its name \"Wang Fu\" (princely residence), \"Jing\" (well). Many exotic foods are served on Wangfujing snack street.Latimer D. (2014) The Improbable Beijing Guidebook, Sinomaps, Beijing, , p. 52 ==Location== The street starts from Wangfujing Nankou (\"south entrance\"), where the Oriental Plaza, Beijing Hotel, and Wangfujing Subway Station are located. The street then heads north, passing the Wangfujing Xinhua Bookstore, the Beijing Department Store as well as the Beijing Foreign Languages Bookstore before ending at the Sun Dong An Plaza and St. Joseph's Catholic Church. ==History== The street was also previously known as Morrison Street in English, after the Australian journalist George Ernest Morrison. Wangfujing is also one of the traditional downtown areas of Beijing, along with Liulichang. Until the late 1990s, the street was open to traffic. Modifications in 1999 and 2000 made much of Wangfujing Street pedestrian only (aside from the tour trolley). Now through traffic detours to the east of the street. The 2011 Chinese pro-democracy protests were planned to take place in Wangfujing. Some violence occurred there between police and foreign journalists. ==Stores== Wangfujing is now home to around 280 shops.
