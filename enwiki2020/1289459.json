(1905) Things Japanese: Being Notes on Various Subjects Connected with Japan for the use of Travellers and Others, p. 114. It was officially abolished 1947 by the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers (SCAP) during the occupation of Japan, after World War II. ==Background== The Order of the Golden Kite was an exclusively military award, conferred for bravery, leadership or command in battle. It ranked just below the Order of the Chrysanthemum in precedence and was the military equivalent of the Order of the Paulownia Flowers; therefore, it could be considered analogous to the military division of the Order of the Bath in the United Kingdom.Corresponding article in the Italian Wikipedia The first three classes were roughly equivalent to the three divisions of the Order of the Bath, the fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh classes were analogous to the DSO, MC/DSC, DCM/CGM and DSM/MM, respectively . The order consisted of seven classes. Enlisted rank soldiers were eligible for the 7th\u20135th classes, non-commissioned officers were eligible for the 6th\u20134th classes, junior officers for the 5th\u20133rd classes, field grade officers for the 4th\u20132nd classes and general officers for the 3rd-1st classes. A total of 1,067,492 Order of the Golden Kite awards were made over the history of the order, most of them in the two lower 6th and 7th classes. Only 41 of the 1st class and 201 of the 2nd class were awarded. By conflict: *First Sino-Japanese War: about 2000 *Russo-Japanese War: about 109,600 *World War I: about 3000 *Manchurian Incident: about 9000 *Second Sino-Japanese War (1937\u20131941): about 190,000 *Pacific War: about 630,000 The award came with an annual monetary stipend, fixed in 1916. This was awarded for the lifetime of the recipient, and following his death, it would be awarded to the recipient's family for one year after. If the recipient died within 5 years of receiving the honor, the stipend would be awarded to the family until the end of the 5-year period.The Japan Year Book 1938\u20131939, Kenkyusha Press, Foreign Association of Japan In 1939, the stipends stood as follows: *1st Class \u2013 1500 yen *2nd Class \u2013 1000 yen *3rd Class \u2013 700 yen *4th Class \u2013 500 yen *5th Class \u2013 350 yen *6th Class \u2013 250 yen *7th Class \u2013 150 yen Since the monthly pay for a private in the Imperial Japanese Army at the time was 8 yen, 80 sen, this amounted to a very substantial reward. The monetary stipend was abolished in 1940. The honor was sometimes awarded individually, sometimes awarded en masse. In mid-October 1942, posthumous awards were announced following ceremonies at the Yasukuni Shrine. Posthumous honorees included 995 who were lost in combat in the far-flung Pacific War battles and 3,031 who were lost fighting in China. In this instance, Tokyo's official radio broadcast of the list of posthumous recipients of the Order of the Golden Kite was monitored by Allied forces in Asia. \"Tokyo Awards List Big Officer Loss; Vice Admiral, 2 Rear Admirals and 2 Major Generals Win Posthumous Honors; 55 Naval Fliers Named; Group Included Covers the Japanese Pacific Dead Up to Mid-February\", The New York Times, October 16, 1942. The number of honorees was not considered remarkable at the time, but the number of posthumous awards was considered noteworthy by Allied analysts.\"Japan's Hero's\", Time. October 26, 1942. Specific high ranking naval and army officers were named; and in addition, special mention was given to 55 naval aviators and 9 \"members of a special attack flotilla\"\u2014presumably miniature submarines taking part in the attack on Pearl Harbor. The order of the Golden Kite was officially abolished by the Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers of Occupied Japan in 1947. {|align=center class=wikitable width=60% |colspan=4|Classes |- |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerSeventh Class |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerSixth Class |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerFifth Class |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerFourth Class |- |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerThird Class |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerSecond Class |width=20% valign=top align=center|centerGrand Cordon |- |} Classes of the Order of the Golden Kite ==Symbolism== Order of the Golden Kite, 1st and 2nd class plaque The badge depicts a golden kite, a messenger of the kami as described in the ancient Japanese chronicle Nihon Shoki, which helped Emperor Jimmu defeat his enemies in battle. The golden kite stands on an eight-pointed star with 32 rays enameled in red. Below the kite are two crossed ancient samurai shields, enameled blue, with two crossed swords enameled yellow, with silver hilts. On one side is a halberd (enameled green with white trappings), with the mitsu tomoe Shinto symbol on red banners. The reverse side is plain. The badge was gilt for the 1st-5th classes and silver for the 5th\u20137th classes. It was suspended on a ribbon in blue-green with a white stripe near the edges, worn as a sash on the left shoulder by the 1st class, as a necklet by the 2nd and 3rd classes, on the left chest by the 4th and 5th classes. The badges for 6th and 7th classes were non-enameled. The star of the 1st and 2nd classes was similar to the badge as described above, but with both red and yellow enameled rays. It was worn on the left chest by the 1st class, on the right chest by the 2nd class. ==Selected recipients== ===First Class=== :Imperial Japanese Army *Oku Yasukata (1847-1930) *\u014cyama Iwao (1842-1916) *Kawamura Kageaki (1850-1926) *Kuroki Tamemoto (1844-1923) *Kodama Gentar\u014d (1852-1906).Honor awarded 1907 -- Barry, Richard. \"The Passing of Japan's Supreme Genius,\" New York Times, July 29, 1906. *Terauchi Masatake (1852-1919) *Nogi Maresuke (1849-1912). \"Nogi, Maresuke,\" Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (12th ed.), Vol. XXX, p. 1139. *Nozu Michitsura (1840-1908) *Hasegawa Yoshimichi (1850-1924) *Yamagata Aritomo (1838-1922) *Kamio Mitsuomi (1856-1927) *Yasuji Okamura (1884-1966) *Shigeru Honj\u014d (1876-1945) *Nobuyoshi Mut\u014d (1868-1933) *Shunroku Hata (1879-1962) *Hisaichi Terauchi (1879-1946) *Prince Yasuhiko Asaka (1887-1981) *Matsui Iwane (1878-1948) *Hajime Sugiyama (1880-1945) *Toshiz\u014d Nishio (1881-1960) *Tomoyuki Yamashita (1885-1946) :Imperial Japanese Navy *Masafumi Arima (1895-1944) *Ijuin Gor\u014d (1852-1921) *It\u014d Sukeyuki (1843-1914) *Kantar\u014d Suzuki (1868-1948) *Kamimura Hikonoj\u014d (1849-1916) *Kataoka Shichir\u014d (1854-1920) *Mineichi Koga (1885-1944) *Ch\u016bichi Nagumo (1887-1944) *Koshir\u014d Oikawa (1883-1958) *T\u014dg\u014d Heihachir\u014d (1848-1934) *Tamon Yamaguchi (1892-1942) *Yamamoto Gonnohy\u014de (1852-1933) *Isoroku Yamamoto (1884-1943) *Mitsumasa Yonai (1880-1948) *Kiyoshi Hasegawa (1883-1970) ===Second Class=== :Imperial Japanese Army * Yoshimasa \u014cshima (1850-1926) * Umezawa Michiharu (1853-1924).Awarded also third and fourth class of the same order * Yoshinori Shirakawa (1869-1932) * Hayao Tada (1882-1948) * Sadao Araki (1877-1966) * Jun Ushiroku (1884-1973) * Tateo Kat\u014d (1903-1942).Honor awarded 1942 \u2013 \"Tokyo Awards List Big Officer Loss; Vice Admiral, 2 Rear Admirals and 2 Major Generals Win Posthumous Honors; 55 Naval Fliers Named; Group Included Covers the Japanese Pacific Dead Up to Mid-February\", The New York Times, October 16, 1942. :Imperial Japanese Navy * Makoto Saito (1858-1936) * Tomosabur\u014d Kat\u014d (1861-1923) * Takeo Takagi (1892-1944).IJN 6th (Navy (submarine)) fleet Posthumous Admiral.
