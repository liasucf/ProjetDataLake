    "text": "The 2006 National Pro Fastpitch season was the third season of professional softball under the name National Pro Fastpitch (NPF) for the only professional women's fastpitch softball league in the United States. From 1997 to 2002, NPF operated under the names Women's Pro Fastpitch (WPF) and Women's Pro Softball League (WPSL). Each year, the playoff teams battle for the Cowles Cup. ==Teams, cities and stadiums== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Team !City !Stadium |- | Akron Racers | Akron, Ohio | Firestone Stadium |- | Arizona Heat | Tucson, Arizona | Hi Corbett Field |- | Chicago Bandits | Lisle, Illinois | Benedictine University Sports Complex |- | Connecticut Brakettes | Stratford, Connecticut | Frank DeLuca Hall of Fame Field |- | New England Riptide | Lowell, Massachusetts | Martin Softball Field |- | Philadelphia Force | Allentown, Pennsylvania | ECTB Stadium |- | Texas Thunder | League City, Texas | Big League Dreams |} ==Milestones and events== 2004 NPF champion New York Juggernaut and the California Sunbirds (who played a partial schedule in 2005) were not on the 2006 schedule and ceased operations. In September 2005, NPF announced the addition of the expansion team Philadelphia Force, owned by brothers William M. and John M. Thompson. The Force named Patriots Park in Allentown, Pennsylvania, as their home stadium. One of their first signings included 2004 Olympic Gold Medalist Natasha Watley. The Force did play at ECTB Stadium at Bicentennial Park in Allentown. NPF announced that Patrick J. Linden had become their new president. An attorney, Linden has experience as counsel for the NPF owner's group. ==Player acquisition== ===College draft=== The 2006 NPF Senior Draft was held 138, 2006 via conference call. Cat Osterman of Texas was selected first by the Connecticut Brakettes. Osterman opted not to sign with the Brakettes, becoming a free agent at the end of the 2006 season. ===Notable transactions=== Sarah Pauly signed her initial NPF contract, as the first player signed by the Connecticut Brakettes. In 2005 as a member of the amateur Stratford Brakettes, Pauly pitched against NPF teams. == League standings == Source {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Team !GP !W !L !Pct. !GB |- | Chicago Bandits | 42 | 30 | 12 | .714 | - |- | Connecticut Brakettes | 42 | 27 | 15 | .643 | 3 |- | Akron Racers | 46 | 29 | 17 | .630 | 3 |- | New England Riptide | 41 | 24 | 17 | .585 | 5.5 |- | Texas Thunder | 48 | 21 | 27 | .438 | 12 |- | Arizona Heat | 48 | 20 | 28 |.417 | 13 |- | Philadelphia Force | 42 | 14 | 28 |.333 |16 |} NPF's 2006 schedule was 48 games for each team, including seven four-game home series and five four-game road series.
