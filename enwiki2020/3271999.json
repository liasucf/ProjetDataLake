It is the only high school in the Centerville City School District, which also includes three middle schools, six elementary schools, and two K\u20131 schools, or \"primary villages.\" The district serves all of the city of Centerville and Washington Township, as well as property parcels in the city of Kettering near the Moraine Country Club. Centerville High School has the third highest student population in Ohio. ==History== Washington Township first began offering formal education in 1803 with a school building housing grades 1\u20136. Nine one-room elementary schools were also erected. In 1848, the Old Stone Academy was constructed and the first high school courses were offered. Private schools over the blacksmith shop and in Old Township Hall also offered similar courses. In 1885, the Washington Township High School was built at 101 West Franklin Street. The first class graduated in 1890. In 1924, the Magsig building was built as a centralized school (grades 1-12). Washington Township High School became a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools in 1951. In April 1955, the Central Unit of what is now Cline Elementary School was opened and junior high and the three-year high school were moved there. Kindergarten was added at Magsig. The name of the high school officially became Centerville High School in 1963. In 1966, CHS became a four-year high school with classes split by department between Magsig and Cline (then known as the South building) and students walking back and forth between classes. Tower Heights Middle School and Hithergreen Middle School were built for grades 6\u20138 in 1966. Hadley Watts Middle School became the third middle school in 1969. In 1973, the first part of the present-day high school was completed, becoming the East Unit in addition to the Magsig and South Units. In 1975\u201376, the entire high school was finally taught inside the current building with Central, East, and West units. Magsig was changed to a middle school, and the old South was changed to W.O. Cline Elementary School. The stadium and athletic fields were built behind the high school in 1979 and the auxiliary gym, as well as the new South Unit in 1980. In 1982, Hithergreen Middle School and Village South Elementary School were closed. Hithergreen became a community center for active seniors. In 1991, Village South was reopened as Centerville Kindergarten Village. During the 1999-2000 school year, the Athletic Entrance, Athletic Office, and weight room were completed. In May 2005, voters in Centerville/Washington Township supported a $4.4 million operating levy and a $2.5 million bond issue designed to compensate for a predicted district enrollment increase to 9000 students. Part of this levy includes a new addition to the front. The addition, completed during the summer of 2007, includes 9 new chemistry and physics classrooms and 3 new labs, a new main entrance, additional classroom space, and improved cafeteria commons areas. This addition is now finished and used daily by the students. The new cafeteria areas provide several booths to students and less space for the lunch line area. ==Curriculum and activities== Main entrance of Centerville High School on May 9, 2014 Centerville High School's curriculum offers 25 Advanced Placement tests in 18 courses in science, mathematics, history, government, language, economics, and psychology.

Part of the recent construction at Centerville included the addition of a new $7.5 million theatre which consists of a 1,200+ seat auditorium, as well as classrooms for new acting, technical theatre and dance classes. The theatre opened in December 2007. The new theatre addition is at the rear of the school with an entrance adjacent to the marching band's parking lot.
