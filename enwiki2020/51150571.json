    "text": "Mega Food Park is a scheme of the Ministry of Food Processing (part of the Government of India) with the aim of establishing a \"direct linkage from farm to processing and then to consumer markets\" through a network of collection centres and primary processing centres. Its purpose was to increase processing of perishables from 6% to 20% and to increase India's share in global food trade by at least 3% up to year 2015. According to an estimate, the Indian food industry was to grow from $200 million USD to $310 million USD in 2015 by this plan. ==Highlights of scheme== * Government provides grants up to Rs 50 crores for each food park to a consortium of companies. * 30-35 food processing units are expected to be established. * Collective investment of companies is expected to be at least 250 crores. * A turnover of 400-500 crore and employment generation of at least 30000 from each mega food park is expected. A total of 42 Mega Food Parks have been sanctioned so far by MoFPI in six phases. These MFPs are to ensure backward linkages to the farmers, SHGs, JLVs etc. & enhance farmer income. Each MFP is supposed to connect with 25000 farmers.
