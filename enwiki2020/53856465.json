    "text": "The Macleay Valley Way is a road in New South Wales which was a part of the Pacific Highway that has been bypassed by a newer alignment of the highway. ==Route description== The Macleay Valley Way branches from the Pacific Highway at the Kempsey South Service Centre. It follows the former Pacific Highway alignment. Instead of bypassing population centres, the Macleay Valley Way passes through the towns of Kempsey and Frederickton. ==History== Macleay Valley Way became the secondary road in two stages, as the new Pacific Highway was opened in two stages. The southern part of the new road is east of the old road which is now Macleay Valley Way through Kempsey. The northern part is west of the Macleay Valley Way. The new bridge over the Macleay River and bypass of Kempsey and Frederickton was opened first, on 27 March 2013. The section north of Frederickton opened on 16 May 2016. This northern section of Macleay Valley Way includes the part of the former Pacific Highway that was the site of the Kempsey bus crash which occurred in the locality of Clybucca in 1989 when two loaded tour buses collided head-on. ==Major junction list== ==References== Category:Highways in New South Wales ",
