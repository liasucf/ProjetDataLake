Blake steadily gained on Su, a metre up on a wall of the remaining competitors save a beaten Barakat Al- Harthi. Then 70 metres into the race, Blake suddenly pulled up, leaving Su all alone, with the year's new phenom Noah Lyles separating from the pack. Known more for the 200 metres, Lyles showed the late closing speed from the longer race, catching Su 5 metres out and on to the win. Akani Simbine separated from the group to take bronze. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Lane !! Athlete !! Nationality !! Team !! Result !! Points !!

From the gun, he took the lead, making up the stagger on Alonso Edward, to his outside 60 metres into the turn. Guliyev hit the straightaway with a metre lead, while Edward was just a nose ahead of Yuki Koike, Baboloki Thebe and \u00c1lex Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez in the battle for second place. From there, rocking side to side, Edward powered away in a different gear from the others, catching Guliyev 30 metres from the finish line. Disadvantaged with the tight lane 1 turn, on the straightaway, Qui\u00f1\u00f3nez was able to separate from Koike, while Thebe, known more for 400 metres, faded but still ran a personal best. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Starting the race with his leg wrapped, Thapelo Phora pulled up 100 metres into the race, but rather than being assigned a DNF, he was disqualified for a lane violation for walking off the track. Down the back stretch, Haroun gained on Hudson-Smith taking the clear lead. Through the final turn, Baboloki Thebe asserted himself pull to even with Hudson-Smith 2 metres back of Haroun, with Luguel\u00edn Santos a metre back and Nathan Strother another metre behind him. Down the home stretch, Thebe made a run at Haroun, while Hudson-Smith and Santos went backward. Halfway down the home stretch, Thebe also started to tie up. Haroun glided across the line uncontested, Thebe's rush gave him enough of an advantage to hold off a fast closing Strother. And a late run by Mohammad Anas, caught Santos and almost caught Hudson-Smith, which became significant because this was the Asia-Pacific's Joker race, which they won and received the double points. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Down the back stretch, Emmanuel Korir edged into the lead, with Clayton Murphy on his shoulder and the field remaining bunched. Nijel Amos worked his way through the crowd to get to Murphy's back, the three starting to separate slightly from the rest of the pack. Amos moved to the outside to pass Murphy, but Murphy held his ground both athletes re-surging twice down the home stretch. Neither could make ground on the slight advantage of Korir who held on for the win, Murphy and Amos hitting the finish at the same time. The photo finish gave the silver to Murphy by 3 thousandths of a second. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Athlete !! Nationality !! Team !! Result !! Points !!

After another 3/4 of a lap, Elijah Manangoi decided Hunter wasn't keeping up the pace and he went around. Seeing Manangoi hit the front, Jakob Ingebrigtsen played his hand and moved to the marking position, the two going through 800 in 2:03.52. As they approached the bell, Marcin Lewandowski moved to Ingebrigtsen's shoulder as the pace quickened. Bell at 2:47.08, 3 laps at 3:01.11. As they ran down the back stretch, Jinson Johnson moved into the lead group as four athletes began to separate. Johnson stayed to the outside of Lewandowski, running extra distance for the entire final turn. When they hit the final straightaway, Manangoi barely had half a meter on Lewandowski on his shoulder, with Ingebrigtsen but an arm's length behind him. As more of an 800-metre specialist, advantage might be expected to be with Lewandowski, but halfway down the straightaway, world champion Manangoi began to pull away to a two-metre victory. Manangoi was comfortable enough with his lead, he had time to salute the crowd before crossing the line. The 17 year old Ingebrigtsen faded four more metres back, but he was still able to hold off the late rush from Charles Philibert-Thiboutot and Ryan Gregson to retain bronze. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Then Stewart McSweyn chose to take up the point. As they came up to the first elimination lap, it was a wall of runners tied for the lead, with Edward Zakayo left behind, until the last few metres of the home stretch when he sprinted out to lane 4 to join the wall. Suddenly it was Birhanu Balew left a step behind the wall, to his surprise getting the red paddle on the backstretch. The next lap turned almost into a shoving match, with each athlete protecting their position. The end of the lap again turned into a wall of athletes sprinting to avoid elimination, with Getaneh Molla a mere step behind. After easing through the next half lap, the field again positioned for a sprint to the line, with Zakayo and Marc Scott left behind when Henrik Ingebrigtsen accelerated away. Realizing they were behind both turned into an all out sprint, dipping at the line with Scott the odd man out. After that action Zakayo was spent and jogged the next lap, far behind the remaining competitive four. Chelimo held the advantage at the bell, while Henrik Ingebrigtsen was last in the pack. As Chelimo and Mohammed Ahmed started to pull away, Ingebrigtsen went in chase, as he went around, McSweyn had noting to offer. Ahmed moved forward to challenge Chelimo, clipping his teammate's heels, but Chelimo was having none of the challenge, pulling away the last 200 to an easy victory, the U.S. Army runner saluting as he crossed the finish line. As a Joker race, again Africa squandered their opportunity. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Athlete !! Nationality !! Team !! Result !! Points !!

By the third hurdle, Ronald Levy had caught Alkana, barely ahead of a fast moving Shubenkov. It took two more hurdles for Shubenkov to catch Levy, with Pascal Martinot-Lagarde pulling even with Alkana. In this fast moving race of inches, Shubenkov was just snapping over the hurdles faster than Levy assuming the lead. Alkana rattled the seventh hurdle, just enough to give Martinot-Lagarde the advantage to carry across the line for bronze. More important for Europe, this was their Joker race, which they won handily with the 1-3 finish. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Lane !! Athlete !!

Less noticed, in lane 1, Annsert Whyte was flying, clearing hurdles ahead of Warholm. Down the back stretch, #2 in history and #1 in 2018, Abderrahman Samba was gaining on Warholm. Into the final turn, Samba began to edge ahead of Warholm, a step behind Whyte, with Yasmani Copello coming into contention with Warholm. Between the eighth and ninth hurdles, Samba finally passed Whyte. Samba pulled away to an easy win. Warholm labored the final two hurdles but maintained his advantage over Copello. Europe played a Joker and tied for the win to gain the points. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! Rank !!Lane !! Athlete !! Nationality !! Team !! Result !! Points !!

Evan Jager did not start, reducing the need for the first elimination, still the athletes sprinted with four laps to go. With just over 3 laps to go, as Soufiane El Bakkali was looking around he stepped on the concrete curb, twisting his ankle. He limped across the lap line in fourth place, then fell to the infield, John Kibet Koech was eliminated as the last place runner. With El Bakkali injured, the second lap elimination was no longer necessary, but after the second sprint of the race, Kosei Yamaguchi was spent, jogging two more laps to get the team points before being eliminated. Over the next two laps, the European athletes fell off the pace, while Matthew Hughes led until the penultimate water jump. From there, reigning World and Olympic champion Conseslus Kipruto separated from Hughes. With a comfortable 30 metre lead, Kipruto spent the last lap playing to the crowd, gesturing for them to cheer and holding his hands to his ears to hear them. This was Africa's Joker race, but without El Bakkali, they squandered the opportunity for double points. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Athlete !!

Inside of him, Mike Rodgers put the Americas into the lead, handing off to the new American star Noah Lyles. With Africa, represented by an all South African team, out, the closest chasers were the Turkish team representing Europe, led by Jamaican ex-pats, Emre Zafer Barnes and Jak Ali Harvey. Lyles passing to Yohan Blake, Americas continued to expand their lead, handing off to Jamaica's new find for 2018, Tyquendo Tracey with a 7-metre lead. Turkey's star, Ramil Guliyev couldn't make any headway, taking half the straightaway just to pass Blake who jogged after Tracey after the handoff. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Donald Thomas kept a perfect round going to 2.27, to take the lead. Maksim Nedasekau had one miss at 2.24 but cleared 2.27 to move into second place, with Brandon Starc making the height on his second attempt to pull up into third. Already with 4 misses in the competition, Ilya Ivanyuk skipped 2.27 in order to try to make a heroic jump at 2.30 to snatch a higher place. Through two rounds of attempts at 2.30, nobody was able to make a clearance. On his final attempt, Thomas made it to retain the lead. After Nedasekau missed, Starc moved into second place by also clearing 2.30. Ivanyuk's bid failed, so Thomas and Starc moved on to try 2.33. After missing twice, already with the lead, Thomas preserved one more jump as protection. When Starc missed, the protection wasn't necessary, but he took a shot at it anyhow and missed. Still Thomas won on the tiebreaker. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Athlete !! Nationality !!

Barber and Timur Morgunov took two attempts while Sam Kendricks made his opener. World record holder Renaud Lavillenie waited until 5.65 to start, clearing it on his first attempt just after Barber had done the same. Kendricks matched Lavillenie, both still clean. Morgunov took two attempts to assume 4th place behind Barber and that was as high as either would go. Kendricks took two attempts to get over 5.75, Lavillenie didn't even bother taking an attempt. When Lavillenie and Kendricks both made 5.80, it was advantage Lavillenie. He lost the advantage by missing his first attempt at 5.85. Kendricks then won the competition by clearing 5.85 moments later. Further strategic maneuvering ensued but neither could clear another bar. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Athlete !! Nationality !!

Easy to anticipate, the best active jumper, #2 in history Christian Taylor jumped 17.59 on his first attempt. He was backed up by Cristian N\u00e1poles jumping 17.07, to win the non-finalists. Only Hugues Fabrice Zango was able to exceed 17 metres, with his Burkina Faso National record 17.02 on his last preliminary attempt (though he had a superior pending record from a month earlier). In the semi final round, it only took 16.44 for Zango to beat Arpinder Singh and Nelson \u00c9vora to get into the final. Taylor jumped almost a metre further.

Unexpectedly, Crouser threw more than a metre behind his personal best in the preliminaries while Darlan Romani threw just 6 cm off his personal best from earlier this season when he finished almost 2 feet behind Crouser at essentially Crouser's home meet, the Prefontaine Classic. Here, Romani became the semi finalist while Crouser had to watch. Europe's semi finalist was even closer, European Champion Micha\u0142 Haratyk 14 cm better than Tom\u00e1\u0161 Stan\u011bk. In the semi, world Indoor and Outdoor Champion Tomas Walsh was finally warmed up, getting to 21 metres exactly, enough to beat Haratyk while Chukwuebuka Enekwechi fouled. Romani's 21.07 won the round. In the final, Romani offered up a 21.68, Walsh threw his best of the day, but 21.43 wasn't good enough. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Jakub Vadlejch upped the ante throwing 84.76 to move ahead in the third, but R\u00f6hler confirmed his position with an 86.39. With a near 86 metre close sector foul on his third throw, Neeraj Chopra missed what would certainly have qualified him into the semi-final round.

Cheng then won the semi-final round with his best of the day 83.28, while R\u00f6hler only managed an 80.61, which was well within the range of his other semi-finalist competitors.

Seeing Wimbley, Semenya sped up through the turn, the runner known for 800 metres reaching the home stretch about two strides behind Naser. Wimbley was swimming backward, but Semenya was gaining on Naser. On the inside, Stephenie Ann McPherson was picking off Wimbley's wreckage to take bronze.

Semenya slowed the third 200, 1:25.83 and for a moment it looked like she was giving Wilson and Goule a chance to catch her, but over the final straightaway, Semenya expanded the lead to finish in 1:54.77. While it was only Semenya's third best race of the season, it was still the eighth fastest 800 metres of all time. Only Pamela Jelimo has been under 1:55 more times in a career or season, all of her four sub 1:55's happening ten years earlier in the 2008 season. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Going into the bell, Linden Hall decided she wanted the lead, moving to the front with a lap and a half to go, but just before the bell, home town runner Simona Vrzalov\u00e1 made a rush to the lead to the cheer of the crowd. With Chibet in chase, Vrzalov\u00e1 finished the third lap in a significantly faster 63.90. Down the back stretch, Chibet assumed the lead with Rababe Arafi in her wake. Shelby Houlihan followed Arafi, then blew past her in the final turn. At the beginning of the straightway, it looked like it would be a sprint battle to the finish, but Chibet made short work of it, pulling away for the victory. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

With the threat of elimination, Sifan Hassan, Hellen Obiri and Senbere Teferi barely broke a sweat to move forward before the line, while the back of the pack sprinted for the line. Muriel Coneo the first odd woman out but Lauren Paquette was broken, jogging to be the second one eliminated one lap later. Even before the end of that lap, Nozomi Tanaka showed she couldn't keep up with the pack. On the penultimate lap, the pace accelerated to leave Genevieve LaCaze off the back, all in all a relatively painless process of elimination to reach the final four. With 500 metres to go, Hassan began to accelerate, taking the bell with a 5-metre advantage over Teferi with Obiri another 2 back. Hassan's lead broke the will of the chasing Africans, extending it all the way to a 40-metre advantage at the finish for an 8:27.50 win crushing Tirunesh Dibaba's Continental Cup record. While not achieving the anticipated win, Africa managed to tie for the event win and get points for their Joker. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! Rank !! Athlete !!

Here she was against Cuba's other competitor from that competition, Yaime P\u00e9rez. Perkovi\u0107's 68.44m first effort easily qualified her to the semi final, while P\u00e9rez hit exactly 65 metres to be the second best. Perkovi\u0107 beat P\u00e9rez by a metre and a half in the semi while both advanced. In the final, Perkovi\u0107 threw well beyond 65 metres, but stepped out of the ring in the process, the throw was a foul. At that point, P\u00e9rez could have won the competition by not dropping it on her foot and landing a fair throw in the sector. Instead, she went for broke, landing her best throw of the day, 65.30m to take the win.https://www.iaaf.org/news/report/report-womens-discus-throw- iaaf-continental Asia Pacific thought their duo of the #2 thrower in the world, Dani Stevens and Chen Yang could overcome Perkovi\u0107, but they lost the Joker points when neither of their throwers was able to beat P\u00e9rez. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Anita W\u0142odarczyk had 73 metres dialed in, good enough to beat everyone in the field, except DeAnna Price, who threw 75.13 to win the preliminary round. In the semi-final, Price again brushed just short of 75 metres, to beat W\u0142odarczyk with both advancing to the final. In the final, Price threw her best of the day , a Championship Record, while W\u0142odarczyk threw another 73 metre throw to finish a surprising second. Europe was able to redeem their Joker points by tying for first because their other thrower, Alexandra Tavernier, beat the Americas other thrower Jennifer Dahlgren. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !

Europe's Christin Hussong dominated the first round until L\u00fc Huihui pulled out her best of the day 63.88m. At that point neither were in danger of not advancing to the semi-final. Kara Winger threw her best of the day in the semi-final, but both L\u00fc and Hussong advance comfortably with 61 metre throws, Hussong winning the semi by a mere 7cm. In the final, L\u00fc threw her worst of the day 57.88m. Hussong answered with her worst of the day, more than 6 and a half metres less than any other throw, L\u00fc winning the competition by less than 3 metres. Counting back to the preliminary round, in the second throw of the competition, Kelsey-Lee Roberts was able to beat the best throw Nikola Ogrodn\u00edkov\u00e1 could muster, to give Asia-Pacific the victory. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

Starting with a one turn stagger, Steven Solomon led off an all Australian team for Asia-Pacific, gaining the advantage over triple jumper Christian Taylor and Matthew Hudson-Smith. Both Taylor and Hudson-Smith had competed earlier in the day, though arguably the Triple Jump might be considered less taxing. Down the home stretch, Hudson-Smith asserted himself, passing Taylor and Solomon, with Taylor almost catching Solomon by the handoff to Luguel\u00edn Santos. Santos quickly gained the advantage on Asia-Pacific's Murray Goodwin and set off chasing Kevin Borl\u00e9e who he had beaten in the 400 final earlier in the day. After running their first woman, Christine Botlogetswe, Africa's Chidi Okezie was well behind. Borl\u00e9e handed off to Lisanne de Witte in the lead, she barely took two steps and while switching hands, the baton went flying. As she went chasing it, the Americas' Stephenie Ann McPherson assumed the lead over Anneliese Rubie. Well behind, Africa handed off to their 800-metre star Caster Semenya. McPherson opened up a 30-metre lead before handing off to Olympic champion Shaunae Miller-Uibo. Semenya almost caught de Witte before handing off to the only male anchor, Baboloki Thebe. The fastest man in the field, Thebe made short work catching Europe's Justyna \u015awi\u0119ty-Ersetic and set sail after Ella Connolly who he caught with 200 metres to go, but Africa had no chance to make up the huge advantage of the Americas. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
