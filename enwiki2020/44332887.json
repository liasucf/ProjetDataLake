It marked the last season in which the Vikings played their home games at the University of Minnesota's on-campus TCF Bank Stadium, before moving into U.S. Bank Stadium, which opened in July 2016, located on the site of the now-demolished Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome. The Vikings improved on their 7\u20139 record from 2014 and clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2012. They also won their first NFC North title since 2009 with a Week 17 victory at the Packers. As a result, they hosted the Seattle Seahawks in the wild card round of the 2015\u201316 NFL playoffs, but lost 10\u20139 after kicker Blair Walsh missed a potential game- winning 27-yard field goal in the final seconds. ==Offseason== ===Draft=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! colspan=\"8\" style=\"\"| 2015 Minnesota Vikings Draft |- ! colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | Draft order ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | Player name ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | Position ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | College ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | Contract ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | Notes |- ! style=\"\" | Round ! style=\"\" | Selection |- ! 1 ! 11 | Trae Waynes | CB | Michigan State | 4 years / $12.944 million | |- ! 2 ! 45 | Eric Kendricks | ILB | UCLA | 4 years / $5.156 million | |- !rowspan=\"3\"| 3 ! 76 |colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Kansas City Chiefs | |- ! 80 |colspan=\"4\"| Traded to the Detroit Lions | from Chiefs |- ! 88 | Danielle Hunter | DE | LSU | 4 years / $3.077 million | from Lions |- ! 4 ! 110 | T.

Despite allowing San Francisco to start with the ball, the Vikings made a positive start, as Andrew Sendejo blocked a 28-yard field goal attempt from Phil Dawson, which Marcus Sherels returned 44 yards to the San Francisco 26-yard line. Minnesota QB Teddy Bridgewater was unable to complete a single pass on the next drive, forcing Blair Walsh to attempt a 44-yard field goal; however, he pushed it wide right. After forcing the 49ers to punt on the next series, the Vikings were themselves forced to punt immediately afterwards, only for the 49ers' rookie former rugby league star Jarryd Hayne to muff the catch, allowing the Vikings to recover the ball. The next drive saw the Vikings attempt to convert on 4th-and-3, but Bridgewater's completed pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph fell a yard short of a fresh set of downs. Both sides exchanged punts at the start of the second quarter, with the 49ers eventually returning one 85 yards for a touchdown, only for it to be called back for an illegal block by a San Francisco player. However, the ensuing possession ended with a 49ers touchdown, as they drove 93 yards in just under 5 minutes, before Carlos Hyde finished the series with a 10-yard touchdown run; after finding nowhere to go on his initial run to the right, he beat a Minnesota defender with a spin move and ran back to the left side of the field, where quarterback Colin Kaepernick led him into the end zone. With the Vikings unable to score in the remaining 47 seconds, the first half ended 7\u20130 to San Francisco. Minnesota started the third quarter with the ball, but they were unable to make it out of their half before being forced to punt. The 49ers then extended their lead on the ensuing possession, driving 73 yards to the Minnesota 11-yard line to set up a 30-yard field goal attempt for Dawson. The Vikings finally got on the scoreboard early in the fourth quarter, as Walsh finished off a 66-yard drive with a 37-yard field goal, but the 49ers pulled further ahead with a second touchdown for Hyde on a 17-yard run. Bridgewater attempted to spark the Vikings back into the game, but a deep pass intended for Rudolph was intercepted by Tramaine Brock, setting up a 25-yard field goal for Dawson. The next drive saw the Vikings go for it again on 4th-and-8, but Bridgewater was sacked for a loss of 14 yards, allowing the 49ers to kneel out the game. ====Week 2: vs. Detroit Lions==== ====Week 3: vs. San Diego Chargers==== ====Week 4: at Denver Broncos==== ====Week 6: vs. Kansas City Chiefs==== ====Week 7: at Detroit Lions==== ====Week 8: at Chicago Bears==== ====Week 9: vs. St. Louis Rams==== ====Week 10: at Oakland Raiders==== ====Week 11: vs. Green Bay Packers==== ====Week 12: at Atlanta Falcons==== ====Week 13: vs. Seattle Seahawks==== ====Week 14: at Arizona Cardinals==== ====Week 15: vs. Chicago Bears==== Teddy Bridgewater's best game of his career, going 17/20, 231 yards, and 4 touchdowns, along with a rushing touchdown on the ground. Before this game, Bridgewater had only 9 passing touchdowns, and afterwards, he had 13. Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears were stopped to 17 points, while Cutler also having a good game with 26/37 for 231 and 2 touchdowns. ====Week 16: vs. New York Giants==== ====Week 17: at Green Bay Packers==== ===Standings=== ====Division==== ====Conference==== ==Postseason== ===Schedule=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !style=\"\"| Playoff round !style=\"\"| Date !style=\"\"| Opponent (seed) !style=\"\"| Result !style=\"\"| Record !style=\"\"| Venue !style=\"\"| Attendance !style=\"\"| NFL.com recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" !

The Vikings had a chance to win it with 20 seconds remaining, but Walsh missed a 27-yard field goal, reminding Vikings fans of Gary Anderson's missed field goal in the 1998 NFC Championship Game. ==Pro Bowl== Running back Adrian Peterson was the only Minnesota Viking selected for the 2016 Pro Bowl. It was Peterson's seventh Pro Bowl selection, tying him for the fourth-most in Vikings franchise history with offensive tackle Ron Yary. After Houston Texans DE J. J. Watt suffered an injury in the wildcard round game against the Kansas City Chiefs, Vikings defensive end Everson Griffen was called up to replace him, his first career Pro Bowl selection. Griffen was followed by a fellow first-time Pro Bowler, safety Harrison Smith, on January 25, after Earl Thomas of the Seattle Seahawks was ruled out of the game due to injury. The next day, quarterback Teddy Bridgewater and linebacker Anthony Barr were added to the Pro Bowl roster as replacements for injured Arizona Cardinals quarterback Carson Palmer and New England Patriots linebacker Jamie Collins respectively. ==Roster== ==Staff== ==Statistics== ===Team leaders=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! column width=150px style=\"\" | Category ! column width=150px style=\"\" | Player(s) ! column width=75px style=\"\" | Value |- | Passing yards || Teddy Bridgewater || 3,231 |- | Passing touchdowns || Teddy Bridgewater || 14 |- | Rushing yards || Adrian Peterson || 1,485 |- | Rushing touchdowns || Adrian Peterson || 11 |- | Receptions || Stefon Diggs || 52 |- | Receiving yards || Stefon Diggs || 720 |- | Receiving touchdowns || Kyle Rudolph || 5 |- | Points || Blair Walsh || 135 |- | Kickoff return yards || Cordarrelle Patterson || 1,019 |- | Punt return yards || Marcus Sherels || 311 |- | Tackles || Eric Kendricks || 92 |- | Sacks || Everson Griffen || 10.5 |- | Interceptions || Terence Newman || 3 |- | Forced fumbles || Anthony Barr || 3 |} Source: Minnesota Vikings' official website ===League rankings=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! column width=150px style=\"\" | Category ! column width=100px style=\"\" | Total yards ! column width=110px style=\"\" | Yards per game ! column width=80px style=\"\" | NFL rank |- | Passing offense || 2,928 || 183.0 || 31st |- | Rushing offense || 2,211 || 138.2 || 4th |- | Total offense || 5,139 || 321.2 || 29th |- | Passing defense || 3,759 || 234.9 || 12th |- | Rushing defense || 1,748 || 109.2 || 17th |- | Total defense || 5,507 || 344.2 || 13th |} Source: NFL.com. ==References== ==External links== * Minnesota Category:Minnesota Vikings seasons Minnesota Vikings Category:NFC North championship seasons ",
