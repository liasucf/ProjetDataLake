    "text": "is a Japanese heavy metal band that was formed in 1978 in Osaka. One of the first Japanese metal bands, they steered toward a poppier sound on later albums and dropped from worldwide view, preferring to record and tour in their home country. After a successful run, they broke up in 1994, but returned five years later and are still going strong today. Remarkably, the original quartet from the first album are still together. An early incarnation of the band included Minoru Niihara (of Loudness fame) as singer (originally bass and vocals). ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== * 1983 - Earthshaker * 1984 - Fugitive * 1984 - Midnight Flight * 1985 - Passion * 1986 - Overrun * 1987 - Aftershock * 1988 - Smash * 1989 - Treachery * 1990 - Pretty Good! * 1992 - Earthshaker * 1993 - Real * 1993 - Yesterday & Tomorrow * 2001 - Birthday * 2003 - Soko-Ni Aru Shi * 2004 - Faith * 2007 - AIM * 2008 - Quarter * 2009 - The Course of Life *2010 - Back to Nexus * 2011 - Pray for the Earth *2013 - The Earthshaker * 2015 - Bird *2018 - The Story Goes On ===Singles=== * 1983 - Blondie Girl * 1984 - T-O-K-Y-O * 1984 - Exciting Mini * 1985 - \u3042\u308a\u304c\u3068\u3046\u541b\u306b * 1985 - Exciting Mini 2 * 1987 - Shaker's Shakies * 1987 - Shaker's Shakies (CD) ===Live albums=== * 1986 - Live in Budokan * 1989 - Earthshaker Live Encore! * 1994 - More - Earthshaker in Vancouver * 1994 - Remains *2014 - 30th Anniversary Special Live ===Compilations=== * 1987 - The Best of Earthshaker * 1988 - The Ballads of Earthshaker * 1995 - The Very Best of Earthshaker * 2002 - Golden Best * 2002 - The Best of Nexus Years * 2005 - 1987-1992 The Best === Video/DVD=== * 1984 - Midnight Flight * 1985 - Passion the Movie * 1987 - After Shock * 1990 - So Good ==References== ==External links== *Earthshaker Official Homepage * Earthshaker@BNR Metal Pages Category:Japanese heavy metal musical groups Category:Musical groups established in 1978 Category:Musical groups from Osaka ",
