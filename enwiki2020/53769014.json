    "text": "Susan A. Martinis is an American biochemist. She has co-authored over 57 publications in peer reviewed journals and scientific book chapters. Her expertise is in protein:RNA interactions and aminoacyl tRNA synthetases. She is currently the Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/804201 == Scientific contributions == Martinis' research focuses on mechanisms, evolution, and biomedical applications of protein synthesis and RNA-protein interactions. In over 25 years of study on aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, in particular leucyl-tRNA synthetase, Martinis has made significant contributions in understanding quality control mechanisms, tRNA recognition, and a non- canonical role in mitochondrial group I intron splicing. She has received research funding from the National Institutes of Health, National Science Foundation, W.M. Keck Foundation, the Human Frontier Science Program, The Robert A. Welch Foundation, and the American Chemical Society Petroleum Research Fund. She currently leads a W.M. Keck Foundation-supported team of six research laboratories at the University of Illinois to discover and characterize non-canonical activities of as many as twenty splice variants of mammalian leucyl-tRNA synthetases. This team includes researchers with expertise covering structural, and computational biology, as well as biochemistry. She was recently named interim vice chancellor for research designate at the University of Illinois. == Personal history == Martinis was born in 1963 to Anne Irene Martinis, a school principal, and Paul Vincent Martinis, a commercial fisherman who came from a long line of fisherman from Yugoslavia. Martinis was raised in Everett, Washington with her two sisters, attended Catholic schools and played on school basketball teams. During her high school and college years she worked summers as the cook on her father's fishing boat off the coast of Alaska. Upon enrollment at Washington State University, she pledged Kappa Delta Sorority where she served as local chapter president. She received her Bachelor of Science degree from Washington State University in 1985. In 1985, Martinis enrolled in graduate school at the University of Illinois in the Department of Biochemistry which was at that time in the School of Chemical Sciences. Stephen G. Sligar was her mentor and she received her Ph.D. in 1990. Martinis met her husband, Steven Blanke, in graduate school at the University of Illinois. They were married in Everett, Washington in 1992 and have three children. Martinis was awarded an American Cancer Fellowship to perform postdoctoral research in the laboratory of Paul Schimmel at MIT. In 1992 she took a research position in the biotechnology industry at Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc., where she was awarded the first US patent and NIH SBIR grant for the company. In 1995 she moved back to academia, taking a position as an assistant professor at the University of Houston. After receiving teaching awards and tenure at the University of Houston, she was recruited to a tenure position at her alma mater, the University of Illinois. Martinis became head of the Department of Biochemistry and Medical Chemistry at the University of Illinois and has served as interim associate dean for the sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Illinois (2014\u201315) before being named interim Vice chancellor for Research at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2017. She was named Vice Chancellor for Research and Innovation in 2019. == Education == *BS in chemistry, Washington State University, 1985 *PhD in biochemistry, University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, 1990 == Scientific positions == *Postdoctoral Scientist, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 1990\u201392 *Research Scientist, Cubist Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 1993\u20131995 *Research Assistant Professor, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, 1996\u20131997 *Assistant Professor, Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Houston, 1997\u20132003 *Associate Professor, Department of Biology and Biochemistry,, University of Houston 2003\u20132005 *Associate Professor, Department of Biochemistry, University of Illinois, 2005\u20132009 *Professor, Department of Biochemistry, University of Illinois, 2009-current *Professor and Head, Departments of Biochemistry and Medical Chemistry, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Illinois, 2009-2013, 2014- current *Professor, Center for Biophysics and Computational Biology, School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Illinois *Interim Associate Dean for the Sciences in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, University of Illinois 2013. == Awards and honors == *Award for Teaching Excellence, School of Chemical Sciences, University of Illinois, 1988 *American Cancer Society Fellowship for Postdoctoral Research, 1990\u201392. *Teaching Excellence Award, College of Natural Sciences and Mathematics, University of Houston, 2001. *Houston Alumni Organization \u2013 Outstanding Faculty Award, 2001. *Enron Award for Teaching Excellence, University of Houston, 2003. *Distinguished Lecturer, Institute of Advanced Sciences, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, 2015. *Stephen A.
