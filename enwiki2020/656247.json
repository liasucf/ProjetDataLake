    "text": "This page lists the table of every television station in Canada by call sign. For the list of television networks in Canada, see the List of Canadian television networks (table). Under the current digital television transition, television stations in Mandatory Markets, in Canada are launching digital transmissions by August 31, 2011. On August 18, 2011, the CRTC issued a decision that allows CBC's mandatory market rebroadcasting transmitters in analog remain on-air until August 31, 2012. Where known, a digital channel assignment is noted below. Digital channels listed on a green background have already been launched, while those listed on a red background have not yet commenced operations. In some cases, the digital channels have been allocated but the stations have not applied to use them; as there is no requirement that Canadian stations begin digital broadcasts before the end-August 2011 analogue shutdown, it is currently unknown whether some broadcasters will ask to flash- cut on their existing frequencies or to continue on their assigned digital channel. ==Categorized channels== Flagship stations are highlighted in grey. === Analog === {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
