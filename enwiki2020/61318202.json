    "text": "The Complete Starter Set: Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Game (1996) The Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set is a category of companion accessories across multiple editions of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. In general, the Starter Set is a boxed set that includes a set of instructions for basic play, a low level adventure module, pre-generated characters, and other tools to help new players get started. == Advanced Dungeons & Dragons 2nd edition == TSR, Inc. published four starter sets for Advanced Dungeons & Dragons. Shannon Appelcline noted that by 1993 the Basic D&D; line ended and was replaced with games like Dragon Quest (1992) and DragonStrike (1993), and that \"There was another abrupt change the next year when TSR put out First Quest (1994) by Richard Baker, Zeb Cook, and Bruce Nesmith. It was an introductory AD&D; game with an example of play on a CD; after two years of introductory board games, the company was now back to introductory roleplaying, though no longer under the Basic D&D; brand\". In 1994, First Quest: The Introduction to Role-Playing Games was released. Then in 1995, this starter set was re-released with new artwork and re-titled as the Introduction to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons Game. The main difference in this new edition was that it included The Book of Lairs and did not include an audio CD. Wizards of the Coast bought TSR, Inc. in 1997 and in 1999 they published the last starter set for the 2nd edition, the Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game. Similar to the previous starter sets, it included a simplified ruleset up to the 3rd level, an adventure book, and a Dungeon Master's Screen. This set also included dice, a dice bag and pre- generated characters but did not include an audio CD. == Dungeons & Dragons 3rd edition and v3.5 == In 2000, the 3rd Edition version of Dungeons & Dragons Adventure Game was released. It included a 32-page rulebook, a 48-page adventure book, 32 pages of reference, a map, two pages of tokens and a \"Read This First\" sheet. After the revision to 3rd Edition (known as v3.5) was published in 2003, three more starter sets were published. In 2004, Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game was published as an simplified version of game in the form of a board game that was compatible with the full version of v3.5. It was known as the \"Black Dragon Edition\" due to the black dragon on its cover. Similar to the 3rd Edition starter set, this set included quick start rules, a full rulebook, and an adventure but it also included 16 painted plastic miniatures, double-sided map tiles, and a set of dice. Then in 2006, a new edition of Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game was released. It was known as the \"Blue Dragon Edition\" due to the blue dragon on its cover. The characters, the content of the adventure, and the miniatures were almost entirely different from the 2004 edition. In 2007, Wizards of the Coast published the Dungeons & Dragons Player's Kit. This starter set was advertised as a sequel to the Basic Game (2006). It included a booklet on how to create characters for new players, a trade paperback version of the Player\u2019s Handbook, and a set of dice. == Dungeons & Dragons 4th Edition == === Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set (blue box cover) === Following the release of the new 4th Edition Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and Dungeon Master's Guide in June 2008, the Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set was released on October 21, 2008. This box set included an introductory version of the 4th Edition rules (a 16-page Quick Start Rules booklet and a 64-page Dungeon Master's Book), dice, three sheets of double-sided map tiles, 50 tokens (to represent characters and monsters) and an adventure module called Beneath the Village of Harken. The 2008 Starter Set was referred to as the \"Blue box\" edition due to its cover. A PDF version of these Quick Start Rules was made available for free download. === Dungeons & Dragons Fantasy Roleplaying Game Starter Set (red box cover) === This new Starter Set was released on September 7, 2010. The box set included two booklets (a 32-page book for players and a 64-page book for Dungeon Masters), two sheets of die-cut tokens for characters and monsters, dice, and cardstock character sheets and power cards. It also included two adventures \u2013 one designed for solo-play and one designed for group play (called The Twisting Halls). The 2010 Starter Set was referred to as the \"Red box\" edition. Shannon Appelcline noted that \"Wizards' final major expansion of 2010, Essentials, was the biggest change for D&D; since the 2008 release of the 4E rules. Intended to offer an easier entry point to 4E D&D;, the line kicked off with the boxed Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set (2010) \u2014 whose cover looks almost exactly like Frank Mentzer's iteration of the Dungeons & Dragons Basic Rules (1983). Though the box only took players up to second level, additional Essentials products quickly supplemented it.\" == Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition == === Starter Set === Unlike the 4th Edition Starter Set (2008), the 5th Edition Starter Set was released on July 15, 2014 before the new core three rulebooks (Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, Dungeon Master's Guide) were released between August and December 2014. It included a 32-page rulebook for playing characters level 1-5, a 64-page adventure module (Lost Mines of Phandelver), five pre-generated characters and dice. Lost Mines of Phandelver is set in and around the village of Phandalin (a region in the Forgotten Realms). The Starter Set won \"Best Supplement\" in the 2014 Golden Geek Awards. In the 2015 ENnie Awards, the Starter Set was the gold winner of \"Best Production Values\" and \"Best Family Game\". Bloomberg reported that in 2014, the Starter Set in North America sold 126,870 units. While unit sales decreased in 2015, unit sales started to increase again in 2016. In 2018, 306,670 units were sold in North America. The Starter Set's adventure, Lost Mines of Phandelver, is available as a digital product through the following Wizards of the Coast licensees: D&D; Beyond, Fantasy Grounds, and Roll20. === Stranger Things Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set === Stranger Things Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set was released on May 1, 2019. This box set includes a Stranger Things themed adventure (Hunt for the Thessalhydra) that was seen in the first season of the Netflix show and pre-generated character sheets inspired by the D&D; characters of the characters in the show. It also includes a set of dice and two exclusive miniatures of the Demogorgon (one painted and one unpainted). Tabletop Gaming reported that \"the box itself is modelled on the RPG\u2019s iconic \u2018Red Box\u2019 released in the early 1980s, and comes with the impression of hours of love in the form of readymade scuffs, creases and tears\". === Dungeons & Dragons Essentials Kit === In May 2019, the Dungeons & Dragons Essentials Kit was announced during D&D; Live 2019: The Descent on a Twitch live stream by Wizards of the Coast and was released on September 3, 2019. It contains a 64-page rulebook with new rules on creating characters, a new adventure titled Dragon of Icespire Peak, dice, character sheets, and 81 cards describing game mechanics. The Essentials Kit also includes a code that unlocks the Essentials Kit Bundle on D&D; Beyond at no extra cost. This bundle consists of the included Dragon of Icespire Peak adventure (level 1-6), as well as 3 digital- only supplementary adventures written by Wizards of the Coast: Storm Lord's Wrath (level 7-9), Sleeping Dragon\u2019s Wake (level 9-11), and Divine Contention (level 11-13). The product also includes a 50% off code for the Player's Handbook on D&D; Beyond. Cameron Kunzelman, for Paste, wrote \"if you\u2019re getting your feet wet with D&D; in 2019, then this is where you\u2019d want to do that\". Charlie Hall, for Polygon, wrote that the \"retail product itself provides an excellent value\". He highlighted the adventure's \"diversity of environments and enemies on offer\" and the \"dynamic addition\" of new two player sidekick rules. Hall was disappointed in the quality level of the cardboard components where he thought the DM screen was \"flimsy\" and the cards \"a bit sloppy. Once separated from their sheets, the edges are rough and uneven. They\u2019ve even too big to sleeve, and need to be trimmed down to fit\". === Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty === Dungeons & Dragons vs. Rick and Morty was released on November 19, 2019. This box set includes a Rick and Morty themed adventure (The Lost Dungeon Of Rickedness: Big Rick Energy), a rulebook, five pre-generated character sheets inspired by characters in the show, a specially designed DM screen, and a set of dice. Jon Ryan, for IGN, wrote \"it\u2019s clear that the team behind this crossover is incredibly invested in striking a great balance between paying homage to and reverently adapting the source material while also making the adventure accessible to new players (after all, isn\u2019t it likely that left to his own devices Rick would just constantly kill all the characters he found boring?). The adventure booklet, in particular, will be a fun read for any DMs who are fans of the series, as it doesn\u2019t just feature commentary from \u201cRick\u201d over the standard rule text (as in the rulebook), but rather, almost every room description, stat block, and random table are written from his perspective\". == See also == * Editions of Dungeons & Dragons == References == == External links == * 5E Starter Set * Stranger Things Dungeons & Dragons Roleplaying Game Starter Set * Dungeons & Dragons Essentials Kit Category:Dungeons & Dragons sourcebooks ",
