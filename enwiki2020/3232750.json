    "text": "Nerol is a monoterpenoid alcohol found in many essential oils such as lemongrass and hops. It was originally isolated from neroli oil, hence its name. This colourless liquid is used in perfumery. Like geraniol, nerol has a sweet rose odor but it is considered to be fresher.Karl-Georg Fahlbusch, Franz-Josef Hammerschmidt, Johannes Panten, Wilhelm Pickenhagen, Dietmar Schatkowski, Kurt Bauer, Dorothea Garbe, Horst Surburg \"Flavors and Fragrances\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. Isomeric with nerol is geraniol, which is trans- or E-isomer. Nerol readily loses water to form dipentene. Nerol can be synthesized by pyrolysis of beta-pinene, which affords myrcene. Hydrochlorination of myrcene gives a series of isomeric chlorides, one of which converts to neryl acetate. ==See also== *Citral *Citronellol *Geraniol *Linalool *Perfume allergy ==References== Category:Primary alcohols Category:Alkene derivatives Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Flavors Category:Monoterpenes ",
