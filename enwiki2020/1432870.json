    "text": "Committed is a 2000 film directed and written by Lisa Krueger. == Plot == The ever-optimistic Joline (Heather Graham) faces a challenge when her husband, flaky news photographer Carl (Luke Wilson), leaves her to find himself in Texas. Joline tracks Carl down and observes him, acquainting herself with his schedule and new friends, including his new girlfriend, Carmen (Patricia Vel\u00e1squez), and his quirky neighbor Niko (Goran Visnjic). Eventually Carl spots Joline, and Joline seeks new ways of returning Carl to her life, up to and including mystic remedies provided by Carmen's grandfather. Eventually Joline is committed, hence the title, and her belief in true and lasting love is broken... or is it? ==Cast== *Heather Graham \u2013 Joline *Casey Affleck \u2013 Jay *Luke Wilson \u2013 Carl *Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107 \u2013 Niko *Patricia Vel\u00e1squez \u2013 Carmen *Alfonso Arau \u2013 Grampy *Mark Ruffalo \u2013 T-Bo *Clea DuVall \u2013 Mimi *Summer Phoenix \u2013 Meg *Kim Dickens \u2013 Jenny *Art Alexakis \u2013 NY Car Thief *Jon Stewart - Birthday Party Guest (uncredited) == Reception == Rotten Tomatoes reports that 43% of 46 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 5.38/10. The site's consensus reads: \"Critics say Committed is one of those films that shows promise \u2013 some sort of vision \u2013 of what the movie could have been. The key word is 'could'. As it is, the script is predictable, the story becomes tedious, and it's simply not funny. Heather Graham shows she can play a central character, but she's not enough to make Committed successful.\" Committed was nominated for the Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing and also for the Grand Jury Prize at the 2000 Sundance Film Festival. It won the award for Best Cinematography at Sundance. The film had only a limited opening. == References == ==External links== * * Category:2000 films Category:2000 comedy-drama films Category:American films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Miramax films Category:Sundance Film Festival award winners Category:Films set in Texas Category:Films shot in El Paso, Texas ",
