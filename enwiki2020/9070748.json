    "text": "Internet Archaeology is an academic journal and one of the first fully peer- reviewed electronic journals covering archaeology. It was established in 1996. The journal was part of the eLIb project's electronic journals.M Heyworth, S. Ross and J. Richards Internet archaeology: an international electronic journal for archaeology, The Field Archaeologist, Winter 1995, No. 24, pages 12-13.Mike Heyworth, Seamus Ross, and Julian Richards, 'Internet archaeology: an international electronic journal for archaeology' Archaeological Computing Newsletter Number 44: Winter 1995, 20-22. The journal is produced and hosted at the Department of Archaeology at the University of York and published by the Council for British Archaeology. The journal has won several awards for its creative exemplars of linked e-publications and archives. The journal's first editor-in-chief (1996\u20131999) was Alan Vince. Since 1999 it is edited by Judith Winters. Journal content makes use of the potential of internet publication to present archaeological research (excavation reports, methodology, analyses, applications of information technology) in ways that could not be achieved in print, such as searchable data sets, visualisations/virtual reality models, and interactive mapping. The journal's content is archived by the Archaeology Data Service. == History == The journal was established in 1995 with funding from the Jisc's Electronic Libraries programme and initially explored a subscription model.J Winters 2003 'Towards Sustainable Electronic Publishing for Archaeology' in M.

Archive of Monuments and Publications, Hellenic Ministry of Culture, 415-418. In September 2014, editor Winters announced that the publication had adopted an open access approach and that all past and future content would be freely available. == Abstracting and indexing == The journal is abstracted and indexed in: Original logo from 1996.
