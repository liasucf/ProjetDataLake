It provides a winter home to a substantial number of black-faced spoonbills. ==History== The wetland was used to be a salt-evaporation pond. In 2011, it was declared a national heritage wetland by the Ministry of the Interior. With the growing popularity of the area for birdwatching, the Kaohsiung City Government decided to construct a road leading to the area in July 2014 to accommodate the increasing number of tourists. In the same year, local residents filed a petition to avoid the construction. ==Ecology== In early 2015, the wetland is home to 162 spoonbills, which counted about 8% of the global population. ==See also== * Geography of Taiwan ==References== Category:2011 establishments in Taiwan Category:Landforms of Kaohsiung Category:Wetlands of Taiwan ",
