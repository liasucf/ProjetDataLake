    "text": "Alen Petrovi\u0107 (born 5 November 1969) is a Croatian former football defender. He spent most of his career in Croatia's Prva HNL top level league, with the exception of two season-long stints at Portuguese side C.F. Os Belenenses and Germany's VfL Bochum. His professional debut came in the 1989\u201390 Yugoslav First League for the Croatian side NK Osijek, where he immediately established himself as a regular member of the starting eleven. After spending five seasons with Osijek and a stint at Belenenses in Portugal he was picked up by the Croatian powerhouse NK Dinamo Zagreb (at the time known as \"Croatia Zagreb\") in 1995. His time at Croatia proved to be very successful as the squad won three consecutive domestic Doubles between 1996 and 1998 and reached the 1997\u201398 UEFA Cup Round of 16 in which they were knocked out by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 2\u20131 on aggregate. In 1998, he tried his luck abroad once again and spent a season with VfL Bochum in Germany but he never managed to break into the first team \u2013 he appeared in only seven games for Bochum in the 1998\u201399 Bundesliga before the club was relegated from top level at the end of season. He then returned to Croatia and had stints with NK Osijek, NK Slaven Belupo and NK Marsonia before retirement. Shortly after retiring he was appointed director of football at NK Osijek in June 2005, a post he held until his contract was terminated by mutual consent in August 2009. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
