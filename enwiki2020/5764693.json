A film of the same name was released in 2018. ==Plot== The story centers on the life of Mike Fallon, a high-class hitman. Fallon was known for making his murders look like accidents, often going to extravagant lengths to do so. Fallon is also noted for his love of high living and glamorous girlfriends. Mike Fallon's, \"I don't give a damn\" attitude to his hits was changed the day his ex-girlfriend (a would-be Greenpeace activist) was murdered. Fallon then went on a murderous rampage to find out who paid the contract on his girlfriend and who actually made the hit. ==Bibliography== Three Accident Man story series ran in Toxic!, between 6 and 8 issues each. * Accident Man (by Pat Mills/Tony Skinner) ** \"Accident Man\" (with Martin Emond, in Toxic! #1-6, 1991, reprinted in Apocalypse Presents \"Accident Man\", 1991) ** \"The Death Touch\" (with Duke Mighten, in Toxic! #10-16, 1991, Apocalypse Presents \"Accident Man Book Two The Death Touch\", 1991) ** \"The Messiah Sting\" (with John Erusmus, in Toxic! #17-24, 1991) There was also a three-issue mini series published by Dark Horse comics in 1993, drawn by Duke Mighten this time in black and white.
