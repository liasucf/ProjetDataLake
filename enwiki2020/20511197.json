Diego Maradona joined the campaign, playing an hour-long game at Hernando Siles stadium in La Paz, which is located above sea level, to show that if a 47-year-old could play there, so could fit, young professionals. He led a team of former Argentine internationals in a 7\u20134 victory over a Bolivian team led by Evo Morales. On 1 April 2009, FIFA called Bolivia's 6\u20131 victory over the Maradona-coached Argentina national team a \"stunning defeat in high altitude against the rank outsiders\".
