It inherited the various traditions and military ranks of its constituent states. ==Ranks of the Imperial German Army== The German Army from 1871 to 1914 inherited the various traditions and military ranks of its constituent states, thus becoming a truly federal armed service. ===Enlisted (') ranks=== * Musketeer (', Prussian army infantry regiments), Infantryman (', Bavarian army infantry regiments), Soldier (', Saxon army infantry regiments), Gunner (', foot artillery), Pioneer (', pioneer branch). Other unit-specific enlisted ranks were: Fusilier ('), Grenadier ('), Huntsman otherwise Light-Infantryman ('), Dragoon ('), Hussar ('), Cuirassier ('), Uhlan ('), Fusilier Guard ('), Grenadier Guard ('), etc. * Lance Corporal ('); up until 1918 the only rank (with exception of ' in the foot artillery) to which an enlisted soldier could be promoted, the rank was a deputy rank to the Corporal (') rank.\"Gefreiter\" \u2013 Allgemeine Encyclop\u00e4die der Wissenschaften und K\u00fcnste, Erste Section, A-G, (Universal Encyclopaedia of the Sciences and Arts, First Section, A-G), Author: Johann Samuel Ersch and Johann Gottfried Gruber, Publisher: F. A. Brockhaus, Leipzig, 1852, Page 471-472, in German. * Senior Lance Corporal ('); established in the Prussian Army from 1846 to 1853, reestablished in 1859, then in foot artillery only, replacing the artillery Bombardier rank that had been introduced in 1730. Additionally, the following voluntary enlistees were distinguished: * One-Year Volunteer Enlistee ('): despite the name, one-year volunteers were actually conscripts who served a short-term form of active military service, open for enlistees up to the age of 25. Such enlisted soldiers were usually high school graduates (), who would opt to serve a one-year term rather than the regular two or three-year conscription term, with free selection of their chosen military service branch and unit, but throughout were obligated to equip and subsist themselves at entirely their own cost. In today's monetary value, this could at bare minimum cost some 10,000 euro, which purposely reserved this path open to officer- material sons from mostly affluent social class families wishing to pursue the Reserve-Officer path; it was the specific intention of Wilhelm II that such Reserve-Officer career path should only be open to members of so-called \"officer-material\" social classes.Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 4th Edition, Volume 6, Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig 1885\u20131892, Page 659. in German On absolving their primary recruit training and shorter military service term, those aspiring to become Reserve-Officers would have to qualify and achieve suitability for promotion to the ' rank and then would continue to receive further specialized instruction until the end of their one-year term, usually attaining and leaving as surplus Corporals (') (Reservists), with the opportunity to advance further as reservists. Enlistees who did not aspire to officer grade would leave at the end of their one-year term as ' (Ordinary soldier) enlisted rank (for example ' or ') and a six-year reserve duty obligation. Eligibility for this specific one-year path of military service was a privilege approved upon examining the enlistee's suitability and academic qualifications. * Long-Term Volunteer Enlistee \"Capitulant\" ('): enlisted soldiers who had already absolved their regular two or three-year military conscription term and had now volunteered to continue serving for further terms, minimum was 4 years, generally up to 12 years.Meyers Konversations-Lexikon, 4th Edition, Volume 10, Bibliographisches Institut, Leipzig 1885\u20131892, Page 116, in German Note: ' and ' were not ranks as such during this specific period of use, but voluntary military enlistee designations. They, however, wore a specific uniform distinction (twisted wool piping along their shoulder epaulette edging for ', the ' a narrow band across their lower shoulder epaulette) in the colours of their respective nation state. This distinction was never removed throughout their military service nor during any rank grade advancements. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"text- align:center;\" !colspan=6 style=\"background:#dadada\" | Enlisted |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | Title | Kapitulant ||Einj\u00e4hrig-Freiwilliger ||Obergefreiter ||Gefreiter ||Soldat |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | Collar | | | | | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | Epaulette | | | | | |- style=\"text- align:center;\" |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! colspan=6 style=\"background:#dadada\" | |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | English designation | Capitulant | One-Year Volunteer Enlistee | Senior Lance Corporal | Lance Corporal | Private |} ===Non-commissioned officers / '=== Late WWI uniform of the 73rd Fusilier Regiment at the Imperial War Museum in London ====Junior NCOs (NCOs without Sword Knot) / '==== * Corporal/Sub-Officer (') * Sergeant ====Senior NCOs (NCOs with Sword Knot) / '==== * Sergeant Major 2nd class (Infantry: , Cavalry and Artillery: Vizewachtmeister/Vice-Wachtmeister) \u2013 rank held by reserve officer candidates after they passed lieutenant's examination * Sergeant-Major (Infantry: Feldwebel (i.e. ': CSM officially listed on the regiment's payroll, i.e. '), Cavalry and Artillery: (') ) ===Warrant Officers and Officer Cadets=== * Cadet (', ranking between Sergeant and Vizefeldwebel) \u2013 served as cadets in the various military academies and schools. * Ensign (', ranking between ' and ') * Deputy Officer (', ranking above ') * Acting Lieutenant (', ranking as youngest 2nd Lieutenant, but without officer's commission and still member of the NCO's Mess until 1917) ===Officer corps=== Critics long believed that the Army's officer corps was heavily dominated by Junker aristocrats, so that commoners were shunted into low-prestige branches, such as the heavy artillery or supply. However, by the 1890s, the top ranks were opened to highly talented commoners.Ulrich Trumpener, \"Junkers and Others: The Rise of Commoners in the Prussian Army, 1871\u20131914,\" Canadian Journal of History (1979) 14#1 pp 29\u201347Dennis E.
