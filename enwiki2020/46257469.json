    "text": "\"Bangun Pemudi Pemuda\" is an Indonesian patriotic song which was created by Alfred Simanjuntak, and to this day the song is still echoed, as in every celebration of Independence on 17 August and Youth Pledge on 28 October. == History == The melody of Bangun Pemudi Pemuda was taken from the school march of the Sekolah Rakyat Sempurna Indonesia (lit. the Indonesian School for the Perfection of the People), the tune of which was also composed by Simanjuntak. Simanjuntak argued that the people of Indonesia needed to experience a nascent spirit of patriotism, instead of just the six classes at the SRSI. The song's title (Pemudi-Pemuda, lit. Female Youth-Male Youth) was derived from the fact that several European languages use the fixed order of \"ladies and gentlemen\", incl. Dutch, and that inspired Simanjuntak to put a Pemudi in front of the Pemuda (usually the only term used in Indonesian for 'youth'.) Simanjuntak was put on a hit list by the Japanese military police as a direct result of this song, but it was never carried out, and he discovered the fact after independence.Dody Hidayat, Dian Yuliastuti, and Cornila. \"Tempo\", Edition 5-11 November 2012. \"Alfred Simanjuntak yang Membara\". == Lyrics == {| cellpadding=6 |- | style=\"width:50%;\"| Original | style=\"width:50%;\"| Translation |- style=\"vertical-align:top; white-space:nowrap;\" | style=\"width:50%;\"| Bangun pemudi-pemuda Indonesia Lengan bajumu singsingkan untuk negara Masa yang akan datang kewajibanmulah Menjadi tanggunganmu terhadap nusa Menjadi tanggunganmu terhadap nusa Sudi tetap berusaha jujur dan ikhlas Tak usah banyak bicara t'rus kerja keras Hati teguh dan lurus pikir tetap jernih Bertingkah laku halus hai putra neg'ri Bertingkah laku halus hai putra neg'ri | style=\"width:50%;\"| Arise o youth of the homeland Roll up your sleeves be prepared for all things The coming days are yours to bear Your responsibility for the homeland Your responsibility for the homeland Keep working in honesty and sincerity No need for talks, keep hardworking Heart firm and straight and clear-thinking Behave, O youth of the country Behave, O youth of the country |} ==See also== * Indonesia Raya ==References== Category:Indonesian patriotic songs ",
