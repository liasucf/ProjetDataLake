    "text": "The Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo Mauro Picone (), abbreviated IAC, is an applied mathematics institute, part of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche. It was founded in 1927 as a private research institute by Mauro Picone, and as such it is considered the first applied and computational mathematics institute of such kind ever founded., , and the references cited in this latter one. ==Historical notes== The IAC was founded 1927 by Mauro Picone, while working at the University of Naples Federico II and at the Istituto Universitario Navale as professor of infinitesimal calculus.See , , , , states explicitly his professorship, while describes briefly his involvement in teaching at the Istituto Universitario Navale. Luigi Amoroso also contributed to the founding of the institute, by providing to his former Normale schoolfellow Picone the funding for the creation of the Institute by means of the Banco di Napoli.See , , and . It was only in 1932, when Picone moved from the University of Naples to the Sapienza University of Rome, that the Institute became part of the Italian National Research Council.See for example , , , , , : however many other published biographical and/or research achievements surveys on Mauro Picone cite this fact. ==See also== *Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica Francesco Severi ==Notes== == References == *.
