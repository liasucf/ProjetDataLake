She proceeded to send that piece of writing to Robin Schwartz, a programming executive at the production company Big Beach, who liked Steinkellner's concept and had her draft a full script. By 2014, the production was set up at Showtime, then under the title Widow, where it languished in the development process over the ensuing years. Eventually, Big Beach was able to extract the series from the network and began to shop it to various streaming services and pay-cable television networks. On February 9, 2018, it was announced that Facebook had given the production a straight-to- series order for a first season consisting of ten episodes. Steinkellner was set to executive produce the series alongside Schwartz, Elizabeth Olsen, Lizzy Weiss, James Ponsoldt, Marc Turtletaub and Peter Saraf, Cynthia Pett, Brad Petrigala, and Jon Liebman. Additionally, Weiss was expected to serve as the series' showrunner, Ponsoldt as the director of multiple episodes, and Avy Kaufman as the series' casting director. Production companies slated to be involved in the series included Big Beach TV, a subsidiary of independent film company Big Beach. On March 1, 2018, it was announced that the series had been retitled Sorry for Your Loss and its central premise was revealed. On August 3, 2018, it was reported that the series would premiere on September 18, 2018. On December 13, 2018, it was announced that the series had been renewed for a second season. ===Casting=== Alongside the series order announcement, it was confirmed that Elizabeth Olsen had been cast in the series' lead role. On March 1, 2018, it was announced that Kelly Marie Tran had been cast in a series regular role. The following day, it was reported that Jovan Adepo had joined the main cast and that Janet McTeer and Mamoudou Athie were in talks for series regular roles. A week later, it was announced that McTeer and Athie had officially joined the cast. ===Filming=== Principal photography for the first season began on April 18, 2018 at CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles.

On the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the series holds a 93% approval rating, with an average rating of 7.58 out of 10 based on 30 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Thoroughly honest and insightful, Sorry For Your Loss tackles a sensitive theme, but with a witty touch.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the series a score of 83 out of 100 based on 12 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" In a positive review, The Atlantics Sophie Gilbert offered effusive praise describing the show as the \"kind of series that\u2019s instantly so fully formed, so funny and candid and wrenching right from the start, that you almost question the emotional propriety of it all.\" Similarly enthusiastic, The Daily Beasts Kevin Fallon said of the series, \"Sorry For Your Loss is a gem of a show. With a cast this impressive\u2014in Olsen, an Avenger; in Tran, a Star Wars alum; in McTeer, a renowned Oscar nominee\u2014a series this well-executed would ordinarily be a marquee entry in the fall TV season.\" In another favorable critique, Colliders Allison Keene commended the show saying, \"Sorry for Your Loss is an intense, emotionally raw meditation on grief. And yet, it\u2019s never overwhelming as much as engrossing.\" In a further approving evaluation, Salons Melanie McFarland commended the performances of the cast saying, \"The feelings Olsen, Tran and the rest of the cast capture come across as true and natural, more affirming than depressing, a difficult balancing act to pull off in the most typical of dramas and in brighter months.\" In a more mixed assessment, Slates Inkoo Kang criticized the series saying, \"Good intentions and all-around excellent performances can't make Sorry for Your Loss add up to the sum of its parts. Its keen sensitivity points to the dearth of grounded, relatable shows about loss, but falls short of filling that gap itself.\" In a negative review, IndieWires Ben Travers gave the series a grade of \"C-\" and described it as, \"little more than a meditation on death, offering a turgid reminder that the end is inescapable for us all and can be devastating for those we leave behind.\" ===Awards and nominations=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Award ! scope=\"col\"| Category ! scope=\"col\"| Nominee(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Result ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"| |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"2\" |2019 | align=\"center\" |Critics' Choice Television Awards | Best Actress in a Drama Series | Elizabeth Olsen | | align=\"center\" | |- | align=\"center\"| Shorty Awards | Best Web Series | Sorry for Your Loss | | align=\"center\"| |- |} ==See also== * List of original programs distributed by Facebook Watch ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2010s American drama television series Category:American web series Category:English-language television shows Category:Facebook Watch original programming ",
