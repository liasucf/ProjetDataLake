Bona-Buni\u0107 served as pukovnik konjani\u010dki (colonel of cavalry) in the Croatian Home Guard. From September 1943 he was in command of the II. konjani\u010dki sklop (II. Cavalry Group). He later joined the Brzi zdrug (Mobile Brigade), and commanded the unit at the defense of Travnik. Yugoslav Partisans took the town, resulting in Bona Buni\u0107 leading one last defense which resulted in his death on 2 October 1944. In 1943, Bona Buni\u0107 was decorated with the Military Order of the Iron Trefoil Fourth Class and the Order of the Crown of King Zvonimir Third Class. He was posthumously promoted to general and awarded the Golden Ante Paveli\u0107 Medal for Bravery. ==References== Category:1894 births Category:1944 deaths Category:People from Travnik Category:Austro-Hungarian military personnel of World War I Category:Royal Yugoslav Army personnel Category:Croatian collaborators with Fascist Italy Category:Croatian collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Croatian Home Guard personnel Category:Croatian military personnel of World War II Category:Recipients of the Medal of Poglavnik Ante Paveli\u0107 for Bravery Category:Recipients of the Order of the Crown of King Zvonimir Category:Recipients of the Military Order of the Iron Trefoil ",
