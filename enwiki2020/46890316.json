The metro opened on 1 May 2003. The system currently in operation consists of 3 lines: Line 3, Line 7, and Line 8. === Dalian Subway === The conception of building Dalian's Subway dates back to 1980s. In 1987, the plan was officially submitted for approval but failed. It was not until 2002 that its first line, line 3 was completed and operated. Currently, there are two lines - line 3 and 7 are in service. Another two, line 1 and 2 are under construction and predicted to be opened by July 2014. In addition, line 6, 8 and 10 are also under construction.

There were once eleven routes in operation in Dalian in the Northeast China. Only two routes remain in use today. Notably, all of the staff on Dalian's tram system are female, i.e. \u2013 driver, conductor, points man \u2014 even the depot manager. The tram system was the only rail network in the city, until Dalian Metro opened more than a decade ago; the Metro has a large ridership. === Public Bus === The public bus transport in Dalian is highly developed. Over 150 routes enable budget visitors to get around the city easily. The buses' operating times vary, starting between 4:30am and 6:30am and finishing between 8pm and midnight. Make sure of the operating hours when taking a bus. Most buses have no conductors and so one or two Yuan in change will be needed before getting aboard. There are many one-way streets in the city, so do not always take it for granted that the return will drop people on the same street. People in the city are very kind to foreigners, so ask locals for help. There are three well-preserved old tram routes from colonial times in the city. Luckily they still serve as an important means of transport. The antique red trolleys of 201, 202 and 203 cruise the downtown and southwestern areas in the city.
