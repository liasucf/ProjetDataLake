In particular, he has worked on the glucocorticoid signaling system, diseases of the HPA axis, such as Cushing's syndrome, Addison's disease, and congenital adrenal hyperplasia, and the physiologic and molecular mechanisms of stress. Early in his career, he described in the Journal of Clinical Investigation the Glucocorticoid Resistance Syndrome, a rare genetic disease of the glucocorticoid receptor that causes hypertension and hyperandrogenism in children and adults. Subsequently, he has contributed the majority of the international original publications on this syndrome, which has served as a model of the study of the physiologic functions of these key steroid hormones that regulate the homeostasis of the organism. ==Publications== He has an outstanding record of over 1100 scientific papers, edited 29 books, including 2 popular electronic volumes and 2 encyclopedias, and his work has been cited over 138,000 times throughout the scientific literature.
