The Germanic principalities from whence they came had a history of cigar making. In the 1840s Fendrich brothers Joseph, Karl (Charles), Franz (Francis) and Herrmann started the tobacco and cigar business. In 1855 the company headquarters moved to 21 Main St. in Evansville. New factory complex opened in 1912, and Fendrich Cigar Company had around 1,500 employees at that time. == References == Category:Cigar manufacturing companies Category:Cigarette brands ",
