After Qasim's coup, Redfa was one of only five pilots the new regime trusted to continue serving with the sole Iraqi unit operating the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21, 11th Squadron.Tom Cooper, In 1966, Israeli Intelligence Convinced an Iraqi Pilot to Defect with His MiG-21 Fighter, The National Interest, 2016. Redfa defected in 1966 in \"Operation Diamond\", flying a MiG-21 of the Iraqi Air Force to Israel. In what is considered as one of the Mossad's most successful operations, Redfa's entire extended family was smuggled safely out of Iraq to Israel. The MiG-21 fighter was evaluated by the Israeli Air Force and was later loaned to the United States for testing and intelligence analysis, as part of \"Have Doughnut\". Knowledge obtained from analysis of the aircraft was instrumental to the successes achieved by the Israeli Air Force in its future encounters with Arab MiG-21s.. Redfa's defection was the subject of the movie Steal the Sky (1988). Redfa was an Assyrian, adherent of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Redfa died of a heart attack around 1998. ==See also== * Operation Diamond * Viktor Belenko * List of Cold War pilot defections ==References== ==External links== * Stealing a Soviet MiG, Jewish Virtual Library.
