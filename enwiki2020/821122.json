    "text": "Crash is the second studio album by American rock group Dave Matthews Band, released on April 30, 1996. By March 16, 2000, the album had sold seven million copies, and was certified 7\u00d7 platinum by the RIAA. This is currently Dave Matthews Band's best-selling album. ==Recording== Recording of the album began in October 1995, and ended in January 1996. There were only four known songs from the Crash sessions that \"didn't make it to the final cut.\" However, none of the titles are known.Dave Matthews Band, p. 33 ==Critical reception== Q described Crash as \"equal parts originality and willful complication\", and stated, \"Although the band's determinedly jammy methods do lead them away from their songs at times, almost every track of Crash is at least 'good in parts'\". Entertainment Weeklys Tom Sinclair praised the band's technical abilities, concluding that \"one of the nicest things about DMB's music is that its distinctive complexity serves as a virtual assurance against a flood of lame imitator bands\". Jim DeRogatis of Rolling Stone was less favorable and deemed Matthews' vocals \"too much like Sting's at times\" and his lyrics \"typically banal\", while stating that the album's musical eclecticism \"gives Matthews a slight edge over his peers, but that's sort of like saying you prefer vanilla ice cream to vanilla frozen yogurt. Me, I dig Cherry Garcia.\" Robert Christgau of The Village Voice assigned it a \"dud\" rating. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Dave Matthews Band=== *Carter Beauford \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals (1, 7, 10, 11, 12) *Stefan Lessard \u2013 bass, tac piano *Dave Matthews \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar, design assistant *LeRoi Moore \u2013 saxophones, flute, whistles *Boyd Tinsley \u2013 electric and acoustic violins ===Additional personnel=== * John Alag\u00eda \u2013 additional preproduction * Alex Case \u2013 mixing assistant (1, 2, 4, 7, 9, 11) * C.
