    "text": "Rama slays Shambuka. Shambuka (IAST: \u015bamb\u016bka) is a character in the original Valmiki Ramayana. According to Valmiki Ramayana, Shambuka, a Shudra ascetic, was slain by Rama for attempting to perform penance. This act of Shambuka was seen by Rama as violation of Dharma as he believed that the bad karma, resulting from this act, caused the death of a Brahmin's son in his kingdom.Government of Maharashtra, Nasik District Gazeteer: History - Ancient Period (text credited to Mahamahopadhyaya Dr. V. V. Mirashi) The killing of Shambuka appears in the 'Uttarakanda' [Final Chapter], sargas 73-76, in the Valmiki Ramayana. This episode also appears in Raghuva\u1e43\u015ba, an epic poem composed by celebrated Sanskrit poet K\u0101lid\u0101sa in 5th century CE, and in Uttararamacarita, a Sanskrit play composed by Bhavabhuti in 7th century AD. This story is missing in later renditions of the Ramayana such as Kamba Ramayanam written by Tamil poet Kambar in 12th century AD, and the Ramcharitrmanas written by Tulsidas in 16th century AD. == Story == Following is the English translation of chapter 73\u201376 done by Hariprasad Shastri in his book \"The Ramayana of Valmiki: Translated by Hari Prasad Shastri\". == Criticism and apologetics == Hindu authors adopt other means to explain the reason behind Rama's killing of Shambuka. The celebrated Kannada poet Kuvempu, in his play Shudra Tapasvi shows Rama as having to both carry out his duty by punishing Shambuka, and simultaneously protect Shambuka, as a pious and devout sage, from persecution, and thereby turns the story into a critique of Brahminical attitudes and a defense of Rama.'M.
