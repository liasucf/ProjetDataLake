Known for her distinct husky voice and Brooklyn accent, she has been nominated for an Academy Award, four Emmy Awards, four Golden Globe Awards, and three Screen Actors Guild Awards. Born in New York City, she began her career modeling in France and began appearing in Italian-language films around the turn of the 1980s, including Lina Wertm\u00fcller's Camorra (1986), which featured Bracco's then-partner Harvey Keitel. Bracco's English-language debut came in The Pick-Up Artist (1987), which was followed by roles in Someone to Watch Over Me (1987), Sing (1989), and The Dream Team (1989). Her breakthrough role was that of Karen Hill, wife of mob boss Henry Hill, in Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas (1990), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture. On television, Bracco is best known for portraying Jennifer Melfi, the psychiatrist of Tony Soprano, in the HBO series The Sopranos (1999-2007). She was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama for her performance across the show's first three seasons. Beginning with the fourth season her role began to decline slightly, though by the end of the series, at the 59th Primetime Emmy Awards, she was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series. ==Early life== Bracco as a senior in high school in 1972 Bracco was born on October 2, 1954, in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn, New York City. She is the daughter of Eileen (n\u00e9e Molyneux, 1926\u20132010) and Salvatore Bracco, Sr. She has a sister, actress Elizabeth Bracco, and a brother, Salvatore, Jr. Her father was of Italian descent, while her mother was born in England, with French ancestry. Her parents met during World War II; Eileen came with Salvatore to the United States as a war bride. Bracco grew up in Westbury, New York, on Long Island, from fourth grade. Bracco graduated from Hicksville High School in 1972. ==Career== Bracco moved to France in 1974, where she became a fashion model for Jean-Paul Gaultier. She lived there for about a decade. While still modeling, Bracco was approached by Marc Camoletti, who offered her a major role in the film adaptation of one of his plays, Duos sur canap\u00e9 (1979). Bracco did not imagine that she could be an actress, and initially refused. She eventually made the film, but found the experience \"boring\" and her performance \"terrible\". Nevertheless, she played supporting roles in two other French films \"for the money\". After one of her friends suggested that she might enjoy acting if she took some training, she took seminars with John Strasberg. Although she loved the lessons, she was still unsure of her talents.Bracco, On the Couch During the 1980s, she also worked as a disc jockey for Radio Luxembourg. Also, she appeared as Paul Guilfoyle's hostage in the first season Crime Story episode, \"Hide and Go Thief\". Her sister Elizabeth played a hostage in the series pilot. Eventually, Italian director and novelist Lina Wertm\u00fcller gave Bracco a small part in the film Camorra. \"She dressed me up like an Italian woman of no means. A street woman clad in disheveled clothes, hair unkempt and all that, and threw me on the set. She was so creative. I mean, Lina accentuated my eyes with dark make- up, the way Sophia Loren used to appear in those epic roles in the '60s. And talk about talent. She's so bright and perceptive. I mean, she's just fantastic. And yes, I learned a lot from her. She's a master of her profession, and I've been blessed not only with her, but also with so many masters,\" recounted Bracco to Daniel Simone during a 2007 interview. The experience inspired Bracco to pursue acting. Her other films include Someone to Watch Over Me, Switch, Riding in Cars with Boys, The Basketball Diaries, Medicine Man, Radio Flyer, and Hackers. Bracco was one of many actresses who were considered for the role of Catwoman/Selina Kyle in Tim Burton's film Batman Returns but declined the role. Bracco received her big career break when she was offered the role of mobster-wife Karen Hill in Goodfellas, which earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress and a Golden Globe nomination for Best Supporting Actress \u2013 Motion Picture.
