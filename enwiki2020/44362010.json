He is associated with the annual new harvest of the white African yam. Among the deities, he is considered a close friend of Oosa Ogiyan and Shango, as well as at one time husband of Oya and Yemoja. Bees are considered the messengers of Oko. In Brazilian Candombl\u00e9, he represents one of the Orisha of agriculture, together with Ogum. According to Prandi, Oko songs and myths are remembered, but the presence in celebrations is rare. In his representation, he has a wooden staff, plays a flute of bones and wears white. Oko is syncretized with Saint Isidore among Cuban orisha practitioners of Santer\u00eda (Lucum\u00ed) and Regla de Ocha. == Notes == ==References== * * * * * * * * * Category:Yoruba deities Category:Agricultural gods Category:Yoruba mythology Category:Santer\u00eda Category:Fertility gods Category:Hunting gods ",
