Their employment contracts gave them the right to pay increases in line with the National Joint Council for Local Government Services\u2019 collective agreement. In 2002 their jobs were transferred to a company called CCL Ltd, and in 2004 they were again transferred to Parkwood Leisure Ltd. Though it did initially uprate pay, while expressly stating that it did so without liability, from 2004 Parkwood did not want to comply with NJC updates negotiated for a period from 2004 to 2007. They refused pay increases. The employees argued that under TUPER 1981 r 5 (now TUPER 2006 r 4) they were obliged to comply, since the collective agreement had been transferred. The Employment Tribunal rejected the employees\u2019 claims, based on the ECJ decision under the Business Transfers Directive article 3 in Werhof v Freeway Traffic Systems GmbH & Co KG,(2006) C-499/04, [2006] ECR I-2397 saying that this case had decided updates in collective agreements could not bind an employer to whom a business was transferred. ==Judgment== ===Employment Appeal Tribunal=== McMullen J held the Tribunal was wrong to not follow domestic cases, such as Whent v T Cartledge Ltd[1997] IRLR 153 showing that employees had rights beyond those acknowledged in Werhof. He noted that UK law could be and was more generous to employees in the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006 than the minimum laid out in the EU Business Transfers Directive. On appeal, Parkwood submitted that Werhof was conclusive. It could not be made liable for employment obligations resulting from post-transfer collective bargaining. The employees argued that the decision in Werhof did not preclude the United Kingdom, when implementing the Directive through the Regulations, from giving employees wider rights and that the correct interpretation of the Regulations did just that. ===Court of Appeal=== Rimer LJ held there was nothing in TUPER 2006 regulation 4Previously TUPER 1981 regulation 5 to support the contention that the UK meant to give greater rights than those found in BTD 2001 article 3(1). The ECJ\u2019s interpretation of article 3 had shown the minimum was a static, rather than dynamic, interpretation of the burden of transferees. So a transferee would not be bound by any collective agreement, other than the one in force at the time of the transfer. So not a renegotiated deal, post- transfer. The facts of Werhof were identical and had to be applied here. The better inference was that TUPER 2006 regulation 4 was implementing whatever article 3(1) required, and should be construed accordingly. So the EAT\u2019s decision was set aside, Werhof was applied and Whent was not followed. Ward LJ and Smith LJ concurred. ===Supreme Court=== Lord Hope, giving a unanimous judgment for the Supreme Court, referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether national courts could give a more favourable interpretation to legislation than had been given by German courts. They indicated that the UK Supreme Court would give a more favourable interpretation. However it was emphasised that Parkwood Ltd was not represented in the NJC. Lord Walker, Lord Brown, Lord Kerr and Lord Dyson concurred. ===European Court of Justice=== The European Court of Justice held that the employees could not be regarded as transferring automatically under the terms of the Directive. The reason was that Parkwood Leisure Ltd would not be represented on the National Joint Committee that set the new \"dynamic\" terms that would form a part of the employees' contracts. Without any scope for representation in this process, there would be an undue limit on the employer's business freedom, and freedom of contract, protected by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, article 16. ==Significance== The Alemo-Herron decision of the Court of Appeal would imply that a collective agreement would rank with secondary status compared to other \"dynamic\" contract terms, such as an inflation-linked index of pay increases. While the Court of Appeal suggested that the facts of Werhof were practically identical to the facts of Alemo-Herron, it did not consider that German domestic law, as interpreted by German courts, was different and at a lower standard than English domestic law, as interpreted by English courts, and operating in a different socio-legal environment that has legally binding collective agreements and promotes works councils as a substitute dynamic element in the employment relationship. Accordingly a floor of rights set by the Court of Justice of the European Union would not logically affect the higher protection offered by UK law. In a note on the decision, Charles Wynn-Evans suggests an argument against the decision of the Court of Appeal is that it \u2018fails to respect domestic contractual orthodoxy which permits ongoing determination of contractual terms by reference to a third-party body established by collective agreement. The dynamic approach arguably ensures consistency between the protection afforded by the transfer of undertakings legislation to the terms and conditions of employment of the transferring employees and common law orthodoxy which finds nothing controversial in those employees\u2019 terms being determined by a third party.'See C Wynn-Evans, \u2018TUPE, Collective Agreements and the Static\u2013Dynamic Debate\u2019 (2010) 39(3) ILJ 275, 279 ==See also== *Howard Johnson Co v Detroit Local Joint Executive Board, 417 US 249 (1974) *Whent v T Cartledge Ltd [1997] IRLR 153, Hicks J held that there was no reason why an employer could not bind itself to a collective agreement which was constantly updated. *Werhof v Freeway Traffic Systems GmbH & Co KG (2006) C-499/04 [2006] ECR I-2397 ==Notes== ==References== *E McGaughey, A Casebook on Labour Law (Hart 2019) ch 19, 848 *C Wynn-Evans, \u2018TUPE, Collective Agreements and the Static\u2013Dynamic Debate\u2019 (2010) 39(3) ILJ 275, 279 ==External links== *Parkwood Leisure Ltd's homepage Category:United Kingdom labour case law Category:Supreme Court of the United Kingdom cases Category:2011 in case law Category:2011 in British law ",
