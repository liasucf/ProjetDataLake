Besides carrying passengers and cargo, it evacuated wounded personnel and flew courier routes in SWPA. Active in the Reserve from June 1947 \u2013 June 1949, it supervised subordinate unit training. From March 1954, the 322d Air Division was responsible for airlifting personnel, cargo, and mail in Europe. Almost immediately after it commenced operations in Europe, the 322d became involved in a major airlift of French troops (Project Bali Hai) from bases in France to Indochina. Initially concerned only with operations in West Germany and France, it soon began operating throughout the entire USAFE area of responsibility. In addition to its routine duties, the division supported numerous humanitarian missions to Turkey, Iran, Morocco, and Pakistan, among other states. It also provided airlift support in the following crises: the nationalization of the Suez Canal in 1956; the Hungarian Revolution of 1956; the 1958 Lebanon crisis; support for UN forces in the Congo in 1960\u20131961; the invasion of India by Communist Chinese forces in 1962\u20131963; airlift of peacekeeping forces to Cyprus in 1964; and the Middle East crisis of 1967. Between 1954 and 1968, the division supported numerous USAFE and NATO exercises. From June 1978, the 322d AD managed tactical airlift forces stationed and operating in the European theater and coordinated strategic airlift from the United States and other origins. It also assumed responsibility for all aeromedical operations and administrative airlift in the theater, including highly positioned military and civilian U.S. and foreign government officials. In addition, the division supported military exercises such as Ardent Ground, Dawn Patrol, Flintlock, and Cold Fire/Reforger. In 1985 the 322d acquired peacetime responsibility for airlift management in Africa. ==See also== * List of United States Air Force air divisions ==References== * ==External links== * * Category:Airlift divisions of the United States Air Force Category:Military units and formations of the United States Air Force Reserves ",
