    "text": "Let's Talk About That (abbreviated as LTAT) was a spin-off of Rhett and Link's Good Mythical Morning hosted by executive producer Stevie Wynne Levine. ==Background== LTAT was a Saturday show that aired at 6:00 Eastern Time. Before LTAT, they had a few other Friday morning shows, including Ear Biscuits (which is still airing), and Good Mythical Crew. LTAT was a discussion of main show's episodes that week (hence the slogan, \"the show about the show\"). Starting in season 2, the show began with a \"rejected GMM food\", which was an item that did not make it into a video from the week, but was saved for Rhett, Link, and Stevie to try. Chef Josh Scherer often joined them to describe the dish. LTAT previously began with the \"beverage of the week\", in which they drank and discussed a different odd beverage each week. ==Series Overview== ===Season 1=== ===Season 2=== ===Season 3=== ==See also== * Good Mythical Morning * Ear Biscuits * Rhett and Link's Buddy System == References == == External links == * Official website * * Episode Playlist Category:YouTube series Category:Viral videos Category:2018 web series debuts Category:American comedy web series ",
