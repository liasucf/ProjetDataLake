    "text": "La Rioja (, , ) is an autonomous community and province in Spain, in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Its capital is Logro\u00f1o. Other cities and towns in the province include Calahorra, Arnedo, Alfaro, Haro, Santo Domingo de la Calzada, and N\u00e1jera. It has an estimated population of 315,675 inhabitants (INE 2018), making it the least populated region of Spain. It covers part of the Ebro valley towards its north and the Iberian Range in the south. The community is a single province, so there is no County Council, and it is organized into 174 municipalities. It borders the Basque Country (province of \u00c1lava) to the north, Navarre to the northeast, Arag\u00f3n to the southeast (province of Zaragoza), and Castilla y Le\u00f3n to the west and south (provinces of Burgos and Soria). The area was once occupied by pre-Roman Berones, Pellendones and Vascones. After partial recapture from the Muslims in the early tenth century, the region became part of the Kingdom of Pamplona, later being incorporated into Castile after a century and a half of disputes. From the eighteenth century the Rioja region remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria, until in 1833 the province of Logro\u00f1o was created, changing the name of the province to La Rioja in 1980 as a prelude to its constitution under a single provincial autonomous community in 1982. The name \"Rioja\" (from R\u00edo Oja) is first attested in 1099. The region is well known for its wines under the brand Denominaci\u00f3n de Origen Calificada Rioja. ==History== Santa Mar\u00eda de la Redonda Co-cathedral, Logro\u00f1o. Monasterios de San Mill\u00e1n de Yuso ===Roman and Muslim periods=== In Roman times the territory of La Rioja was inhabited by the tribes of the Berones (central country), Autrigones (upper country, extending also north and west of it) and the Vascones (lower country, extending also north and east of it). It was part of the province of Hispania Tarraconensis. In medieval times La Rioja was often a disputed territory. The Visigoths created the Duchy of Cantabria that probably included most of La Rioja, as a border march against the Vascones. After the Muslim invasion of AD 711, La Rioja fell into the Muslim domains of Al Andalus. ===Medieval period=== Most of the territory was reconquered in 923 by Sancho I of Pamplona, acting for the Kingdom of Pamplona together with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n and the Counts of Castile, feudal lords of the Leonese King. The lower region around Arnedo came under control of his allies the Banu Qasi of Tudela. The territory to the east of the Leza River remained under Muslim control. Later there was a dispute between Count Fern\u00e1n Gonz\u00e1lez of Castile and the kings of Pamplona-Navarra, involving great battles. It was decided in favour of the Navarrese after the imprisonment of the Count's family in Cirue\u00f1a, in 960. La Rioja briefly formed the independent Kingdom of Viguera from 970 to about 1005, at which point it became a part of the Kingdom of Pamplona. Sancho Garc\u00e9s moved the capital of the Kingdom of Pamplona to N\u00e1jera (La Rioja), creating the so-called kingdom of N\u00e1jera-Pamplona which was, due to its large size, the first Spanish Empire. After the independence of Castile in 1035, this new kingdom fiercely fought against Pamplona for the possession of Bureba, La Rioja and other territories. In 1076, after the murder of Sancho IV, Navarre was divided among Castile and Aragon. Castile obtained La Rioja, together with other Navarrese lands. The name \"La Rioja\" first appears in written records in the Miranda de Ebro charter of 1099. The territory was centred on the fortified site of Logro\u00f1o: the 12th-century church Iglesia de Santa Maria de Palacio recalls its origin as a chapel of the administrative palace. Logro\u00f1o was a borderland disputed between the kings of Navarre and the kings of Castile from the 10th century; From 1134 the Navarrese under Garc\u00eda Ram\u00edrez (\"the Restorer\") and his son Sancho VI (\"the Wise\") fought bitterly with Castile for the recovery of the former Pamplonese domains. The region was awarded to Castile in a judgement by Henry II of England and annexed in 1177. Its importance lay in part in the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, the Camino de Santiago, which crossed the River Ebro on the stone bridge, the Puente de Piedra. Arnedillo, in La Rioja ===Province of Logro\u00f1o=== Map of La Rioja by Tom\u00e1s L\u00f3pez de Vargas Machuca, year 1769 Up to the 19th century the territory remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria. The region was taken by Napoleonic forces in the Peninsular War and remained solidly in French hands until 1814. In the 1810 project of Llorente it was to be a part of the prefecture of Arlanz\u00f3n with its capital in Burgos. The Cortes of C\u00e1diz declared La Rioja an independent province at the time of the Liberal Constitution of 1812, and during the Liberal Triennium in January 1822 the province of Logro\u00f1o was created by royal decree as part of the administrative reform of Riego, taking in the whole of the historical territory of La Rioja. However, Ferdinand VII soon annulled these decisions and restored most of the previous territorial divisions. In the 1833 reorganization, a province of Logro\u00f1o was again formed within the region of Castilla la Vieja. The province increased its territory temporarily in 1841. ===Autonomous community=== In 1980 the province changed its name to La Rioja, and following the adoption of the Estatuto de San Mill\u00e1n in 1982, during the reorganization following the Spanish transition to democracy, it was constituted as a uni-provincial autonomous community,. Statute of Autonomy (in Spanish) It is the second- smallest autonomous community in Spain and has the smallest population; half of its 174 municipalities have populations under 200. Nearly half of its citizens live in the capital. ==Geography== View of La Rioja La Rioja is bordered by the Basque Country (province of \u00c1lava), Navarre, Arag\u00f3n (province of Zaragoza), and Castile and Le\u00f3n (provinces of Soria and Burgos). The river Ebro flows through this region, as does the river Oja, after which it is named. thumb|450px|La Rioja and its seven valleys. Drawing by Ernesto Reiner. The Ebro runs through the north of the community. The entire right bank (which is to the south) belongs to La Rioja. There are only three municipalities, Bri\u00f1as, San Vicente de la Sonsierra and \u00c1balos on the left bank (known as the Riojan Sonsierra), although Logro\u00f1o, Agoncillo, Alcanadre, Rinc\u00f3n de Soto and Alfaro also have parts of their respective municipal territories on that bank. Because of their proximity, the \u00c1lava area between the Ebro and the Sierra de Cantabria is called Rioja Alavesa. ===Climate=== The climate is mainly continental. The Rioja Alta comarca receives more precipitation than Rioja Baja. The average temperature ranges from and the precipitation ranges between as an annual average. The wind called Cierzo is very frequent around La Rioja during the winter. ===Mountains and mountain ranges=== The mountains in La Rioja are part of the Iberian System. This mountain range extends to the south of the Ebro river, parallel to it at a distance of about , with altitudes ranging between . From the mountain range the Sierra de la Demanda runs northwards, into the heart of La Rioja, incorporating Monte San Lorenzo which, at , is the highest peak in the province. Other mountains include Sierra de Camero Viejo, Sierra de Camero Nuevo, Sierra de Cebollera, and Picos de Urbi\u00f3n. ===Hydrography=== The river Ebro in La Rioja Footprints of a Theropoda found near Enciso. The Ebro is the main river passing through the community. Emerging from the narrow channel between the rocks of the Conchas de Haro, it reaches La Rioja, through which it runs for , before continuing its journey to the Mediterranean. In the Conchas de Haro the altitude of the river is and when it leaves the community, in the Sotos del Ebro Natural Reserve in Alfaro, it is high. The river therefore flows very quickly through La Rioja. Seven rivers descend rapidly towards the Ebro from the mountain range, which is why La Rioja is sometimes called: \"Zone of the seven valleys\". They are, from east to west, Alhama, Cidacos, Leza, Iregua, Najerilla, Oja and Tir\u00f3n, although the headwaters of the Alhama and Cidacos originate in Soria and those of Najerilla-Neila and Tir\u00f3n are from Burgos. Sometimes Linares (a tributary of Alhama) is added, grouping Tir\u00f3n with its tributary, the Oja. All the rivers of these valleys form tributaries that go on to form many valleys in their own right, such as those of Linares, Ocon, Jubera, Tuerto, Brieva, Viniegras and San Mill\u00e1n. There is an almost unlimited number of grandiose canyons, quite splendid in nature, such as Aguas Buenas, Nieva, Manzanares, Ardancha, Navaj\u00fan, Valderresa, Ollora, Tobia, San Mart\u00edn and others. ===Flora and fauna=== In the highlands oaks, beech and pine are grown. There are also thickets of juniper, boxwood, sloes, holly and cistus. Thyme, rosemary, common juniper, and holm oak are present. There are grand hillsides with fine pasture for livestock, cattle and sheep. In the lower areas there are oaks, olive and almond trees. Near the Ebro, in the plains, the land is used for cereal, sugar beet and potatoes, while the hills are covered with vast vineyards of the wine that has brought worldwide fame to this region. All Riojan rivers, including the Ebro, have a row of poplars and cottonwood. About the Riojan Alamos Ana Maria Matute has written: \"... see them on the edge of the water, turning the landscape, like spears magical pointing towards the unreal and mysterious country of the riverbed.\" ===Natural resources=== Gypsum and silica are mined. Arnedillo is a spa town. ===Dinosaur footprints=== During the Early Cretaceous period the geographical area of Cameros was part of a flooded plain that drained periodically, leaving behind muddy areas where dinosaur tracks marked the path. Eventually they were dried and covered with new sediment layers whose weight pressed down on the lower layers, causing them to solidify into rocks over millions of years. Erosion has been wearing down the upper layers making many of these rock formations visible, bringing into view the fossilized footprints. La Rioja is notable for the number and conservation of these sites, in addition to those found in the north of Soria, such as Yanguas, Santa Cruz de Yanguas and other highland locations. ===Comarcas=== 400px Geographical comarcas: * Rioja Alta ** Comarca de Anguiano ** Comarca de Ezcaray ** Comarca de Haro ** Comarca de N\u00e1jera ** Comarca de Santo Domingo de la Calzada * Rioja Media ** Tierra de Cameros *** Camero Nuevo *** Camero Viejo ** Comarca de Logro\u00f1o * Rioja Baja ** Comarca de Cervera ** Comarca de Alfaro ** Comarca de Arnedo ** Comarca de Calahorra ==Economy== Glasses of wine for tasting in the Vivancos Museum Power station at Arr\u00fabal, La Rioja The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the autonomous community was 8.5 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 0.7% of Spanish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 29,200 euros or 97% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 102% of the EU average. La Rioja is known for its production of Rioja DOCa wines (although the Rioja viticultural region extends slightly into the neighboring administrative regions of \u00c1lava and Navarra). ===Agriculture=== There is dryland farming of wheat, barley and grape; irrigated cultivation of asparagus, capsicum and other crops; and animal husbandry of sheep. Battle of Wine in Haro (La Rioja) ===Industry=== Types of industry include wine production and conserves (in Logro\u00f1o, Cenicero, Haro and Calahorra); textiles and footwear (in Logro\u00f1o, Arnedo, Cervera del R\u00edo Alhama and Ezcaray); furniture manufacturing (in Ezcaray, Logro\u00f1o and N\u00e1jera); rubber, plastics, chemical products and transport machinery; and chorizo, made in Casalarreina. Exports are directed mostly towards the European Union, United States and Canada. ==Demography== Toro de fuego in Haro According to the INE the population of La Rioja (as at 2018) is 315,675 inhabitants, with 155,758 men and 159,917 women.

In the Ministry of Education's 2009 report La Rioja was in first position among the autonomous communities as it relates to general aspects of primary and secondary education. It is placed above the Spanish average in the list of communities with the lowest levels of school failure, with 85% of students being able to obtain the ESO title, despite its schools having the highest proportion of enrolled immigrants. 6,208 euros are spent per pupil, making it the tenth ranked community in this regard. The majority of educational institutions in the community are public, followed by subsidized and private schools, the latter of which are very scarce at the primary and secondary levels. The bachillerato is free in public schools and at a cost in charter schools. In La Rioja the portion of the population with higher education is 30.6%, with two institutions offering studies at this level: the University of La Rioja (UR) and an online university, the International University of La Rioja (UNIR).Website of UNIR - International University of La Rioja.
