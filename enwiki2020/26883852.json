The single was released on 29 January 2010, and has so far managed to reach a peak of #65 on the UK Singles Chart and #1 on the UK Rock Chart. The song also managed to receive placement on BBC Radio 1's A Playlist ==The Song== When asked about the track, Aled Philips (Vocals) explains: The song \u2018Matters At All\u2019 is about making things happen. It plays on the idea of having your time and making the most of it. A lot of the songs on the new album are about just playing what you're dealt and making the most of a good or bad situation.\u2019 He continues; \u2018With the speed that things move nowadays and people's short attention span, I was always weary of us staying relevant and doing something better than we did before, and curious as to whether people would stick by us. It's an age old theme that I guess every band goes through at some point. Except for AC/DC. They can just keep doing their thing... ==Music video== ==Track listing== *Digital Download ==Chart performance== After receiving strong radio airplay throughout February and March 2010, \"Matters At All\" debuted on the UK Singles Chart at #70 on 28 March 2010.http://acharts.us/uk_singles_top_75/2010/13 The following week, on 4 April 2010, the single climbed 5 places to a current peak of #65,http://acharts.us/uk_singles_top_75/2010/14 before falling to #76 the following week.
