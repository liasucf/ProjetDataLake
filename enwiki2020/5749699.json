    "text": "Pachydyptes is an extinct genus of penguin. It contains the single species Pachydyptes ponderosus, the New Zealand giant penguin. This taxon is known from a few bones from Late Eocene (37 to 34 MYA) rocks in the area of Otago. With a height of 140 to 160 cm (about 5 ft) and weighing around 80 to possibly over 100 kg, it was the second-tallest penguin ever, surpassed only by Anthropornis nordenskjoeldi in height, but probably not in weight. Pachydyptes was slightly larger than Icadyptes salasi, the best-identified of the giant penguins. ==References== * Oliver, Walter R. B. (1930). [Genus Pachydyptes]. In: New Zealand birds, 85\u201386.
