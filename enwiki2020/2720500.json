The name UnoAErre comes from 1AR, the identification mark indicated on the punch affixed to products, assigned to the first goldsmith company of Arezzo (AR). In the sixties production reached the highest levels, and the company employed more than 1200 staff. It began a reduction of its workforce in the early 1970s. Today fewer than 500 are employed. The company passed from the hands of families Gori-Zucchi to Morgenf Enfield (Deutsche Bank Group) in the mid 1990s, and was regained by Zucchi family with the help of a group of banks. Operations were subsequently moved to a new factory. In 2008, the company revisited its practices to manufacture items that are lighter an dthat contain less gold and expanded into the production of accessories, rather than just sticking to traditional jewelry. ==Museum== UnoAErre also operates a museum with works of the artists who have collaborated in the production of its jewelry, including Pietro Cascella, Salvador Dal\u00ed and Salvatore Fiume. There's also a section on industrial archaeology. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Design companies established in 1926 Category:Italian companies established in 1926 Category:Retail companies of Italy Category:Jewellery companies of Italy Category:Watch manufacturing companies of Italy Category:Companies based in Tuscany Category:Italian brands ",
