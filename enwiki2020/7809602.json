He served as Republican Governor January 9, 1893 - January 11, 1897. Previously he was Sheriff of King County, Washington during the Seattle riot of 1886. McGraw, a law graduate, had also been President of Seattle First National Bank and Seattle Chamber of Commerce. After leaving office, he made money during the Klondike Gold Rush, much needed since he had to repay the State $10,000 following an investigation into his term of office. He died on June 23, 1910 from scarlet fever. A bronze statue of McGraw sculpted by Richard E. Brooks in 1913 stands at McGraw Square in Seattle. == References == * National Governors Association == Further reading == * Available online through the Washington State Library's Classics in Washington History collection Category:Governors of Washington (state) Category:Washington (state) Republicans Category:Washington (state) sheriffs Category:People from Penobscot County, Maine Category:1850 births Category:1910 deaths Category:Deaths from typhoid fever Category:Republican Party state governors of the United States ",
