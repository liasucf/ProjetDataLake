    "text": "Daedaleopsis is a genus of fungi in the family Polyporaceae. The name Daedaleopsis is a reference to Daedalus, the labyrinth-maker of myth. Similarly, the maze-like pattern of pores is taxonomically described as being daedaloid. DNA was recovered and sequenced from fragments of a nearly 7000-year-old fruit body of D. tricolor found in an early Neolithic village in Rome. ==Taxonomy== The genus was circumscribed by German mycologist Joseph Schr\u00f6ter in 1888. ==Description== Daedaleopsis fungi have basidiocarps that are annual, with a cap or effused-reflexed (crust-like with the edges forming cap-like structures). Their colour is pale brown to deep red, zonate, with a mostly smooth cap surface, lamellate to tubular hymenophore, and a pale brown context. Microscopic features include a trimitic hyphal system with clamped generative hyphae, and the presence of dendrohyphidia. Daedaleopsis has hyaline, thin-walled, and slightly curved cylindrical spores that are negative in Melzer's reagent and Cotton Blue. ==Habitat and distrituion== Daedaleopsis fungi cause white rot, and are widely distributed in the Northern Hemisphere. ==Species== A 2008 estimate placed six species in the genus. , Index Fungorum accepts 10 species of Daedaleopsis: *Daedaleopsis conchiformis Imazeki (1943) \u2013 Japan *Daedaleopsis confragosa (Bolton) J.Schr\u00f6t. (1888) *Daedaleopsis dickinsii (Berk. ex Cooke) Bondartsev (1963) *Daedaleopsis hainanensis Hai J.Li & S.H.He (2016) \u2013 China *Daedaleopsis nipponica Imazeki (1943) \u2013 Japan *Daedaleopsis nitida (Durieu & Mont.)
