The lake is believed to be originally spreads across 6acres as mentioned in the survey maps. Later, a part of the lake was converted into school playground for Jaraganahalli government school students in 1998 leaving behind only 4acres of the lake. The lake is situated close to other lakes such as Annaiah Lake and Sarakki Lake. There is no clear survey number given to this property, but some of the documents state that the lake is located in survey number 29/2C of the Jaraganahalli Village, and survey number 23 of Yelachenahalli, Uttarahalli Hobli, and Bangalore South Taluk Jaraganahalli (Survey map of 1904 \u2013 Jaraganahalli lake on Kanakapura road is visible in the map)The survey map of 1904 also shows the lake which clearly indicates that the lake existed for at least about 100 years. The google map of 2008 shows a partial existence of the lake. The BDA Revised Master Plan which was based upon the existing survey maps lists the lake as Jaraganahalli Lake D1 and yelachenahalli Lake D1. In the chapter 5 of the thesis written by Dr. Sudarshan called \"The expanding city land development and urban planning in Bangalore\", he considers the case study of Jaraganahalli and explains how over a period of time, with an unplanned growth, the Bangalore city has lost its lakes. The thesis also quotes various sources for the same. The article covered in Deccan Chronicle on 30 August 2018 reveals that the Tahshildar in 1995 had written a series of letters stating the encroachment of the lake. A map of lakes put under the Government of Karnataka website of all the lakes encroached under Uttarahalli Hobli, shows the extent of lake, the encroachment and the current situation of the lake. It compares SSLR maps generated by Revenue Department of Karnataka. In 1999, a PIL was started by Krishna Bhat ( a renowned social activist) against dumping of debris and garbage into the lake by the parties who are interested in destroying the lake. The court ordered to stop doing such activities on the lake. The court gave an interim order to karnataka government not to interfere by building layouts on the lake bed. The case was later dismissed as there was a case related to this (OS 3018/2001) was already running in the lower court. Over the years the government agencies have converted the place into a Garbage dumping ground. == References == Category:Lakes of Bangalore Category:Lakes of Karnataka ",
