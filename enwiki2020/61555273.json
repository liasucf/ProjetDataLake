Previously the event was known as the Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) National Championships. A list of past winners shows the winners of all disciplines. ==Venues and dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ |- !width=70|Year !width=200|Dates !width=350|Venue !width=450|Notes |- |1946 |15\u201317 August |New Brighton, Cheshire | |- |1947 |23\u201326 July |St Leonards-on-Sea | |- |1948 |7\u201310 July |South and North Bay Open Air Pools, Scarborough | |- |1949 |21\u201323 July |Derby | |- |1950 |27\u201329 July |Lancaster | |- |1951 |23\u201325 August |Lancaster | |- |1952 |24\u201327 September |King Alfred Baths, Hove | |- |1953 |31 August\u20135 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1954 |13\u201318 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1955 |29 August\u20135 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1956 |3\u20138 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1957 |9\u201314 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1958 |18-23 August |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1959 |1\u20135 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1960 |19\u201324 September |Derby Baths, Blackpool | |- |1961 |27 August -
