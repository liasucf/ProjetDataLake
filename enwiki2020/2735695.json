In 1999, Lapierre accused two Russian cosmonauts of sexual harassment after a 110-day simulation of space station living. Among the claims were an unwarranted kiss during a New Year's Celebration; project coordinator Valery Gushin later claimed that her \"refusing to be kissed\" had been a leading cause for the experiment's failure.NBC News, Does Mars need women?
