    "text": "The Schartschrofen is a rocky summit, 1,968 m high, in the Tannheim Mountains, a sub-group of the Allg\u00e4u Alps. It lies northwest of the Rote Fl\u00fch and south of the col of F\u00fcssener J\u00f6chl. == Ascent == There are two waymarked paths up the Schartschrofen. The normal route runs from the valley of Tannheimer Tal via the col of F\u00fcssener J\u00f6chl \u2013 to this point the cable car may be taken from Gr\u00e4n \u2013 continuing to the Hallgernjoch col and from there to the top. Along the 150-metre-high southeastern ar\u00eate runs the Friedberger Klettersteig, protected throughout its length, initially leading along the ridge and then after a detour into the south flank finally climbing a gully to the summit. == Literature == * Dieter Seibert: Allg\u00e4uer Alpen Alpin Alpine Club Guide.
