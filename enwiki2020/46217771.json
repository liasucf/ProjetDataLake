It is run at Fairyhouse over a distance of 2 miles and 4 furlongs (4,023 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year at the Easter meeting. The race was originally run in honour of John Fowler, an amateur jockey and trainer (son of Bryan Fowler and brother of Jessica Harrington), who was killed in an accident at Rahinston in December 2008, Fowler's widow, Chich, died in 2013 and her name was added to the race title from that year. The race was first run in December 2009, but from 2011 the name was transferred to the existing mares chase run at the Easter meeting. The race was awarded Grade 3 status in 2012. ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:30px\" | Age ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer |- | 2009 | Cara Mara | 7 | R M Moran | J A Berry |-bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |2010 No race | |- | 2011 | Coscorrig | 9 | Bryan Cooper | Dessie Hughes |- | 2012 | Askanna | 7 | Andrew McNamara | Colin Bowe |- | 2013 | Nadiya De La Vega | 7 | Tony McCoy | Nicky Henderson |- | 2014 | Une Artiste | 6 | Barry Geraghty | Nicky Henderson |- | 2015 | Vroum Vroum Mag | 6 | Ruby Walsh | Willie Mullins |- | 2016 | Emily Gray | 8 | Johnny Burke | Kim Bailey |- | 2017 | Slowmotion | 5 | Mark Walsh | Joseph O'Brien |- | 2018 | Youcantcallherthat | 7 | Denis Hogan | Denis Hogan |- | 2019 | Camelia De Cotte | 7 | Paul Townend | Willie Mullins |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Ireland * List of Irish National Hunt races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , ** Category:National Hunt races in Ireland Category:National Hunt chases Category:Fairyhouse Racecourse Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2009 Category:2009 establishments in Ireland ",
