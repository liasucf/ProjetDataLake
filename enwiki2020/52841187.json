The partners were Boston University, New Rep Theater, Israeli Rep, and GAAR/The Mirror Theater. The play, Sinners, is by Joshua Sobel, a prominent Israeli playwright far better known in Europe and the Middle East then here, and the production in Boston was a United State Premiere. The show again starred Nicole Ansare and was again directed by Brian Cox, with sets by Ray Recht and lighting by Brian Barnett, with Jeff Davis as Lighting Associate and F. Mitchell Dana as Production Manager. The play opened on March 23 and played to April 2 in the TheaterLab at BU. It received accolades as it did in Vermont, where it was termed \u201cA masterpiece!\u201d by June Cook. Boston's Art Fuse summed up the political courage of the work: \u201cThis sort of bravery has become very rare in American theater. For far too long, artists and administrators have been arrogantly confident that words such as \u201ctruth\u201d and \u201cfreedom\u201d mean what they have always meant. Our theaters have blinded themselves to the world's most lethal evils, and have looked for every excuse to ignore its victims. This is why the very fact that Sinners is playing anywhere in America matters.\u201d == References == Notes == External links == * Official Website * Buy Tickets * Official Facebook Page Category:Theatre companies in New York City Category:Theatre companies in Vermont ",
