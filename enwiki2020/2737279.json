    "text": "The JavaStation was a Network Computer (NC) developed by Sun Microsystems between 1996 and 2000, intended to run only Java applications. The hardware is based on the design of the Sun SPARCstation series, a very successful line of UNIX workstations. The JavaStation, as an NC, lacks a hard drive, floppy or CD-ROM drive. It also differs from other Sun systems in having PS/2 keyboard and mouse interfaces and a VGA monitor connector. == Models == There were several models of the JavaStation produced, some being pre-production variants produced in very small numbers. Production models comprised: * JavaStation-1 (part number JJ-xx), codenamed Mr. Coffee: based on a 110 MHz MicroSPARC IIe CPU, this was housed in a cuboidal Sun \"unidisk\" enclosure. * JavaStation-NC or JavaStation-10 (part number JK-xx) codenamed Krups: a redesigned Mr. Coffee with a 100 MHz MicroSPARC IIep CPU and enhanced video resolution and color capabilities. Krups was housed in a striking curved vertically oriented enclosure. Models produced only as prototypes or in limited numbers included: * JavaStation/Fox: a prototype of the Mr Coffee: essentially a repackaged SPARCstation 4 Model 110. * JavaStation-E (part number JE-xx) codenamed Espresso: a Krups with PCI slots and a non-functional ATA interface in a restyled enclosure. * Dover: a JavaStation based on PC compatible hardware, with a Cyrix MediaGXm CPU. * JavaEngine-1: an ATX form-factor version of Krups for embedded systems. * A 68030-based system designed by Diba, Inc. (later acquired by Sun) circa 1996, which could be considered a very early JavaStation-like system. In addition, Sun envisioned a third-generation \"Super JavaStation\" after Krups, with a JavaChip co-processor for native Java bytecode execution. This doesn't appear to have been produced. The JavaStation concept was superseded by the Sun Ray series of thin client terminals. == Operating systems == The JavaStation comes with JavaOS in the flash memory, but it is also possible to install Linux or NetBSD on the JavaStation. == References == * JavaStation Linux HOWTO * NetBSD/sparc JavaStation information Category:Sun workstations Category:Network computer (brand) Category:SPARC microprocessor products ",
