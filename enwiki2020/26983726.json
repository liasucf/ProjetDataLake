    "text": "Prank Patrol is a British version of the Canadian show of the same name. The show was made by Baker Media for CBBC which specialised in kids programming. It was hosted by The Jack and Alex Show. It was produced by Baker Media in association with Apartment 11 Productions. One episode of the show where the prankster Adam attempts to prank his friend Tom was not aired as Tom found out about the prank before it was played out, leading to some controversy over whether or not the show's pranks were genuine or not. == Format == Based on the original Prank Patrol series, a young adult nominates his or her friend to play a prank on. Barney then arrives in his van with the Ninja driving and organize their Prank at Prank HQ. They usually are assisted by someone in that prank's area of expertise. After preparing everything it is then 'Prank Day' which is the day the prank will be executed. == Fillers == ===Recipe For A Prank=== Similar to the original Canadian format this filler is an animated short of which explains how to set up your own Prank. ===Release The Ninja=== The Ninja usually go to a public place and play a Prank whether it be hiding behind a park bench and making fart sounds or putting free drinks on a table with leaking cups. Stockport town centre in Greater Manchester is usually the location of these pranks. == Production == Started to be aired on TV in May 2006 - May 2007. Prank Patrol was cancelled by the BBC due to an unconnected incident where an Australian journalist fooled a hospital employee into putting him through to a member of the UK royal family who were receiving treatment at the hospital. This employee then took her own life.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/9747302/BBC-calls-off-its- child-pranksters.html == Episodes == see List of Prank Patrol (British TV series) episodes ==References== == External links == * Category:2000s British children's television series Category:2010s British children's television series Category:2007 British television series debuts Category:2012 British television series endings Category:BBC children's television shows Category:Hidden camera television series ",
