    "text": "Chrysophyllum is a group of trees in the Sapotaceae described as a genus by Linnaeus in 1753.Linnaeus, Carl von. 1753. Species Plantarum 1: 192 in LatinTropicos, Chrysophyllum L. The genus is native to tropical regions throughout the world, with the greatest number of species in northern South America. One species, C. oliviforme, extends north to southern Florida.Kew World Checklist of Selected Plant Families Chrysophyllum members are usually tropical trees, often growing rapidly to 10\u201320 m or more in height. The leaves are oval, 3\u201315 cm long, green above, densely golden pubescent below, from which the genus is named.The generic name is derived from the Greek words \u03c7\u03c1\u03c5\u03c3\u03cc\u03c2 (chrysos), meaning \"gold,\" and \u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd (phyllos), meaning \"leaf.\" See The flowers are small (3\u20138 mm), purplish white and have a sweet fragrant smell; they are clustered several together, and are hermaphroditic (self fertile). The fruit is edible; round, usually purple skinned (sometimes greenish-white), often green around the calyx, with a star pattern in the pulp; the flattened seeds are light brown and hard. The fruit skin is chewy like gum, and contrary to some reports, is edible.
