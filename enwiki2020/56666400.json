    "text": "The MV Sinar Kudus hijacking was a maritime event that began on 16 March 2011 with four pirates in the Indian Ocean seizing the cargo ship MV Sinar Kudus east of Somali coast. The siege ended after a rescue effort by the Indonesian Navy on 1 May 2011. It was the first pirate seizure of an Indonesian merchant ship off the Somali coast. ==Background== On 16 March 2011, an Indonesian merchant ship, MV Sinar Kudus, was carrying nickel ore from South Sulawesi to Rotterdam when it was hijacked by Somali pirates in the Red Sea. After negotiations, the ship owner agreed to a ransom demand and restored the ship and crew to Indoensian authorities. It was then hijacked a second time by another group of pirates; after signalling \"mayday\" the ship's crew were supported by a group of KOPASKA and Kopassus from KRI Abdul Halim Perdanakusuma which secured the ship. A further group of KOPASKA and Kopassus were deployed using a Bo 105 helicopter to strafe the pirates, all of whom were killed. ==Notes== Category:2011 in Indonesia Category:2011 in military history Category:2011 in Somalia Category:Hijacking Category:Indonesian Navy Category:Maritime incidents in 2011 Category:Military operations involving Indonesia Category:Piracy in Somalia ",
