SKALICA 2 - 2 02.04.2016, soccerway.com ===Piast Gliwice=== Plach moved from Senica to Piast Gliwice on 10 January 2018. In April 2018, Plach spoke to Slovak regional tabloid My about his career in Gliwice. While he did not start in a single competitive game in the spring half of the 2017\u201318 season, he mentioned he was glad for the transfer and was not worried that he would follow the tracks of Dobrivoj Rusov who spent 2 years there before returning to Slovak top-division team Spartak Trnava.. The 2018\u201319 season, however, took a major twist for Plach and Piast. While Piast battled to avoid relegation in the previous season, the side championed the Polish league in this edition and Plach was the preferred goalkeeper for the majority of the season, maintaining 12 clean sheets in 25 league matches. After the season, that saw Plach win his first senior trophy, he was nominated to be Ekstaklasa's goalkeeper of the season by the experts at Sportowefakty web-portal, thanks to his 81% save rate and the lowest number of conceded goals (21). He was nominated along with his fellow-Slovak goalkeeper Du\u0161an Kuciak from Lechia Gda\u0144sk, who finished third, and Latvian P\u0101vels \u0160teinbors. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Senica |2015\u201316 |rowspan=\"3\"|Slovak First League |3||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||3||0 |- |2016\u201317 |4||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||0 |- |2017\u201318 |19||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||19||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !26!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!27!!0 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Piast Gliwice |2017\u201318 |rowspan=\"3\"|Ekstraklasa |0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |25||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||26||0 |- |2019\u201320 |27||0||1||0||4||0||0||0||32||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !52!!0!!2!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!58!!0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !78!!0!!3!!0!!4!!0!!0!!0!!85!!0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Piast Gliwice *Ekstraklasa: 2018\u201319 ==References== ==External links== * FK Senica official club profile * Eurofotbal profile * * Futbalnet Profile Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from \u017dilina Category:Slovak footballers Category:Slovak expatriate footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:M\u0160K \u017dilina players Category:\u0160K Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Jur players Category:FK Pohronie players Category:FK Senica players Category:Piast Gliwice players Category:Slovak Super Liga players Category:2.
