Model Dwellings were buildings or estates constructed, mostly during the Victorian era, along philanthropic lines to provide decent living accommodation for the working class. They were typically erected by private model dwellings companies and usually with the aim of making a return on investment hence the description of the movement as \"five per cent philanthropy.\"Tarn, JN (1973) Five Per Cent Philanthropy: an account of housing in urban areas between 1840 and 1914 London:CUP As such they were forerunners of modern-day municipal housing. This is a list of still-standing model dwellings, organised by builder. Most of these companies are now defunct; a few, such as the Peabody Trust are still operating and building new accommodation, and others have been subsumed by larger firms. This list covers urban development on the principal of \"five per cent philanthropy\"; for communities built to house workers for a particular trade or employer, see model village or company town. ==Artizans, Labourers & General Dwellings Company== alt=Homes were classified by size on ALGDC estates; this is the smallest on the Noel Park estate, London The Artizans' Company (ALGDC) was established in 1867 by William Austin, becoming one of the largest of the model dwellings companies in the late Victorian era.
