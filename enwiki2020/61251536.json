Article on Alt\u0131nel's first hearing, on the Bianet website, June 10, 2019 ==Education and career== After undergraduate studies in mathematics and computer science at Bosphorus University, Istanbul, Alt\u0131nel received his doctorate from Rutgers University (New Jersey, USA) under the direction of Gregory Cherlin.Tuna Alt\u0131nel, on the website Mathematics Genealogy Project. In 1996 he joined the department of mathematics of the university Lyon-1, as ma\u00eetre de conf\u00e9rences, and completed his French habilitation in 2001. Alt\u0131nel has written 26 mathematical articles, principally on the subject of groups in model theory, more particularly groups of finite Morley rank and the Cherlin-Zilber Algebraicity Conjecture, concerning the structure of the simple groups of finite Morley rank. He is joint author with Alexandre Borovik and Gregory Cherlin of a book in which this conjecture is proved in the case of infinite 2-rank, after the development of a body of machinery analogous to certain chapters of finite simple group theory.
