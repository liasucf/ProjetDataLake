    "text": "The 2016 Massachusetts Republican presidential primary was held on March 1, 2016, as one of the Republican Party's 2016 presidential primaries. Massachusetts was one of eleven states that held both their Democratic and Republican presidential primaries on that day, dubbed \"Super Tuesday\". 42 delegates were allocated proportionally to all candidates who received at least 5 percent of the vote in the primary. Donald Trump won the Massachusetts primary comfortably, in keeping with polls that had shown him with double- digit leads over his primary rivals in the state. Trump's victory also reflected his relative strength among Republicans in the Northeastern United States. Trump received about 49% of the vote statewide. John Kasich and Marco Rubio came in second and third, respectively, each with about 18% of the vote. Ted Cruz came in fourth with just under 10% of the vote. Of the state's 42 delegates, Trump received 22 of them, Kasich and Rubio each received eight, and Cruz received four. ==References== Massachusetts Category:2016 in Massachusetts Category:Massachusetts Republican primaries ",
