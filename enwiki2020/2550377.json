Foote Memorial Hospital when a local citizen, Mrs. Ida Foote, donated land for construction of the new hospital in honor of her late husband, W.A. Foote. Mercy Hospital opened in 1918. Sister Hynes was one of its founders, serving as its first mother superior. She belonged to the Sisters of Mercy, a Catholic order of nuns dedicated to the sick and needy. In its heyday, the hospital held 213 beds and 40 bassinets. In 1975, it was purchased by Foote Hospital for $2.5 million, and changed its name to Foote West. Foote West closed in 1984 after a new hospital was built on E. Michigan Avenue. The Lansing Avenue building was demolished in 1989, and a memorial was erected in 1997. The property was given to Jackson County in 1998. It is the current site of the Jackson County Medical Care Facility that opened November 2002. Jackson Osteopathic Hospital served Jackson and its surrounding communities as a short-term acute care hospital From June 1943 to 1988. With the addition of MDs to the staff; Jackson Osteopathic Hospital became Doctors Hospital in 1988. In the late 1990s, the hospital became part of Borgess and remained a short-term acute care hospital until 2003. It was then converted into a long-term acute care hospital (LTACH) called CareLink of Jackson as a joint venture of Borgess and Foote Health System. In 2010, Allegiance Health (Formally Foote Health System) purchased Burgess's share to become the sole owner. The current hospital facility was completed in 1983 and is located near the site of the original hospital. The former hospital, now named the Charles Anderson Building, is used for specialized practices such as sleep disorders, behavioral health, and volunteer services. In July 2008, Foote Health System was renamed Allegiance Health. The system was later renamed Henry Ford Allegiance Health on April 5, 2016. == Acquisition == In December 2013, Allegiance Health and the University of Michigan Health System announced that they had signed a letter of intent for Allegiance to become absorbed by the University of Michigan.
