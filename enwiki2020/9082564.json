    "text": "Auto GP, sometimes referred to as the Auto GP World Series, and formerly known as both Euro Formula 3000 and the Euroseries 3000, was a European formula racing series. The series' roots can be traced back to 1999, and the Italian Formula 3000 series, organised by Pierluigi Corbari, which used old Lola chassis with Zytek engines. The teams used the Lola T96/50 in the first two years. At the beginning nearly all races were held in Italy, but very quickly the series expanded and had venues in different European countries. The series became European Formula 3000 in 2001. The next three years (2001\u20132003) saw the Lola B99/50 in use. For 2004, Superfund became the series' title sponsor, planning to use a new car with a new set of regulations, named Formula Superfund, but the funding was pulled before the 2005 season got under way and the series was cancelled. For 2005, Coloni Motorsport established an Italian national-level championship, using the Italian Formula 3000 name. In 2006, Coloni expanded this to form a new European championship named Euroseries 3000 with the Lola B02/50. The Italian series continued to run as part of Euroseries races. In 2009, the organisers announced that the first-generation A1 Grand Prix cars were allowed alongside the Lola F3000 chassis, replacing the old cars completely from 2010. The championship itself was rebranded for the 2010 season, with it adopting the Auto GP name. As well as that, the championship will offer a \u20ac200,000 prize fund at each of its six rounds. 2015 marked the start of the Auto GP World Series working with ISRA, a company from the Netherlands who set up the 2014 FA1 Series, this partnership, however, has not lasted long with the Auto GP Organisation announcing at Round 1 (of the 2015 season) that the two companies have parted ways. The 2015 season was \"archived\" midway through the season and midway through the 2016 season the series merged with the BOSS GP series. ==Results== ===Italian Formula 3000/Euro Formula 3000/Euroseries 3000=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:85%;\" !Season !Champion !Second !Third !Team Champion !Secondary Class Champion |- !colspan=6| Italian Formula 3000 |- ! 1999 | Giorgio Vinella | Werner Lupberger | Marco Apicella | Team Martello |align=center rowspan=3| not awarded |- ! 2000 | Ricardo Sperafico | Warren Hughes | Gabriele Lancieri | Arden Team Russia |- !colspan=6| Euro Formula 3000 |- ! 2001 | Felipe Massa | Thomas Biagi | Alex M\u00fcller | Draco Junior Team |align=center rowspan=3| not awarded |- ! 2002 | Jaime Melo, Jr. | Romain Dumas | Jaroslav Jani\u0161 | Team Great Wall |- ! 2003 | Augusto Farfus | Fabrizio del Monte | Gianmaria Bruni | Draco Junior Team |- !colspan=6| Superfund Euro Formula 3000 |- ! 2004 | Nicky Pastorelli | Fabrizio del Monte | Norbert Siedler | Draco Junior Team |align=center| not awarded |- !colspan=6| Italian Formula 3000 |- ! 2005 | Luca Filippi | Jaroslav Jani\u0161 | Giacomo Ricci | FMS International | : Stefano Gattuso |- !colspan=6| Euroseries 3000 |- ! 2006 | Giacomo Ricci | Marco Bonanomi | Vitaly Petrov | FMS International | : Giacomo Ricci |- ! 2007 | Davide Rigon | Diego Nunes | Luiz Razia | Minardi by GP Racing | : Davide Rigon |- ! 2008 | Nicolas Prost | Fabio Onidi | Adam Khan | Bull Racing | : Omar Leal |- ! 2009 | Will Bratt | Marco Bonanomi | Fabio Onidi | FMS International | : Will Bratt |} ===Auto GP=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%;\" !Season !Champion !Second !Third !Team Champion !Secondary Class Champion |- !colspan=6| Auto GP |- ! 2010 | Romain Grosjean | Edoardo Piscopo | Duncan Tappy | DAMS | : Adrien Tambay |- ! 2011 | Kevin Ceccon | Luca Filippi | Sergey Afanasyev | DAMS | : Kevin Ceccon |- !colspan=6| Auto GP World Series |- ! 2012 | Adrian Quaife-Hobbs | P\u00e5l Varhaug | Sergey Sirotkin | Super Nova International | : Adrian Quaife-Hobbs |- !colspan=6| Auto GP |- ! 2013 | Vittorio Ghirelli | Kimiya Sato | Sergio Campana | Super Nova International | : Vittorio Ghirelli |- ! 2014 | Kimiya Sato | Tam\u00e1s P\u00e1l Kiss | Markus Pommer | Super Nova International |align=center rowspan=2| not awarded |- ! 2015 |align=center colspan=4| Series cancelled |- !colspan=6| Auto GP Formula Open Championship |- ! 2016 | Luis Michael D\u00f6rrbecker | Mahaveer Raghunathan | Christof von Gr\u00fcnigen | Torino Squadra Corse |align=center| not awarded |} ==Scoring system== ===Current system=== Teams only score from their two highest placed cars. 48 points is the maximum possible haul for one driver in a race weekend. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center\" ! colspan=\"13\" | 2012 Auto GP points system |- !
