    "text": "The Sex Files is a television program appearing on Discovery Channel Canada and shown on CTVglobemedia around midnight hours, because of content. It talks about several issues of sexuality, from genetics, reproduction, sexual orientation, puberty, etc. It does contain nudity, which is why it is shown in the midnight hours, but the nudity is done from a scientific point of view showing exactly what the topic is visually, good for people who want information on sexuality and the biology behind it. In Europe the show was called Sex Sense and featured a male narrator. The number of episodes and their titles were the same, but the episodes themselves were slightly different as the more explicit scenes were replaced. It aired on Discovery Channel Europe. Starting with episode 41 (season 4), it is broadcast in high- definition. ==The Sex Files episode list== ===Season 1=== # The Erection # Breasts # Orgasm # The Birds and the Bees # Aphrodisiacs # Fantasy # The Affair # Fetish # Gender # Hair # What is Sexy? # Girl Power # Birth Control ===Season 2=== # Sex Drive # The Act # The Vagina # Sexual Signals # Sexual Senses # Sex for One # Puberty # Homosexuality # The Rear End # Sexual Cycle # Love Juices # Circumcision # Intersexed People # Myths ===Season 3=== # Testicles # Celibacy # Behavioral addiction # Better Sex # Sexual Reconstruction # Menopause # Future Sex # Sex & Culture # Sex & Disabilities # Sex vs. Love # Healing Sex # Pregnancy # Sexpertise ===Season 4=== # Sex Toys # Kinky Sex # Rated X # Beyond Monogamy # Pleasure and Pain # The Kiss # The Strip # The Bi Way # Baring it All # No Sex Please # Dirty Jokes # Makin' it Work # More Kinky Sex ===Season 5=== # First Date # Sun, Sand and Sex # The Boob Tube # Top Ten Sexiest Clothes # The Love Glove # Top Ten Sexy Things # Sexercise # Top Ten Sexual Fantasies # Erotic Origins # His Sexy Makeover # Her Sexy Makeover # The Wedding # Making of the Sex Files ===Season 6=== # Virginity # Marriage Makeover # The Brothel # Breasts # Sex and Beauty # Girls on Top # Sex and Aging # Top Ten Myths # Touch # Sex and Rock n' Roll # Satisfaction # Top Ten Archetypes # Sextracurricular Activities ==Sexual Secrets== Sexual Secrets uses footage from The Sex Files, with contents rearranged to 1-hour episodes.
