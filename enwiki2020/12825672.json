Despite Ceann Iar's name, meaning \"western headland\", Shillay is the westernmost island of the group. There are several small islets around Shillay, including Eilean Siorraidh, Odarum (to the north) and Raisgeir. ==Lighthouse== The lighthouse at Shillay has an uneven history. The red brick lighthouse was built in 1864 by David & Thomas Stevenson, and was in use until it was closed during the war in 1942 and not lit again in 1948 after hostilities ceased. After the Braer disaster in 1993 in Shetland, a new light was recommended to mark the deep water route west of the Hebrides. A new automated aluminium light was installed in 1997. However it proved inadequate and in 2005 it was decided that it was cheaper to reuse the original lighthouse than to increase the height of the new light. In 2008 the old lighthouse was refurbished and put back into use.https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b00y6hym/The_Lighthouse_Stevensons/ A stone from the lighthouse has been removed into the church wall at Paible; a keeper had carved into it \"Eternity Oh Eternity\". Just to the south of Shillay, there is an Eilean Siorraidh (\"Island of Eternity\"; formerly Eilean Siorruidh) - whether this carving is a reference to this or the solitude of the island is unrecorded. ==See also== * List of lighthouses in Scotland * List of Northern Lighthouse Board lighthouses ==References== ==External links== * Northern Lighthouse Board Category:Category B listed lighthouses Category:Lighthouses in Outer Hebrides Category:Monach Islands Category:Uninhabited islands of the Outer Hebrides ",
