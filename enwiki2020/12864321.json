    "text": "The Help Defeat Cancer project ran on World Community Grid from July 20, 2006 to April 2007. It seeks to improve the ability of medical professionals to determine the best treatment options for patients with cancers of the breast, head, or neck. The project worked by identifying visual patterns in large numbers of tissue microarrays taken from archived tissue samples. By correlating the pattern data with information about treatment and patient outcome, the results of this project could help provide better targeted treatment options. == References == == External links == * The Help Defeat Cancer Project * World Community Grid - Research - Help Defeat Cancer Category:Distributed computing projects Category:Cancer research ",
