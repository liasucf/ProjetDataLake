    "text": "OGLE2-TR-L9b is an extrasolar planet discovered by three undergraduate students from Leiden University, Netherlands. The planet is about 4.5 times as massive as Jupiter and is the first discovered planet orbiting a fast rotating hot star. Initially discovered while testing a method for investigating light fluctuations in the OGLE database, the planet's existence was later confirmed by follow up observations from the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile. == See also == * Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment OGLE * OGLE-TR-113b * OGLE- TR-10b * OGLE-TR-111b * OGLE-TR-56b == References == == External links == * * Students Discover Unique Planet * Category:Exoplanets Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2008 Category:Giant planets Category:Hot Jupiters Category:Transiting exoplanets Category:Carina (constellation) ",
