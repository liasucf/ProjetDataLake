Release, Omarion Explores 21 On New Album at Vibe.com Rhapsody had a week-long (Nov. 27- Dec 1) preview of the entire album for free, the final album leaked two days later. ==Critical reception== Mark Edward Nero from About.com found that McKnight's decision to leave Motown Records \"has proven to be a good one for McKnight who sounds completely rejuvenated on his tenth album, appropriately titled Ten. Not only is Ten an all-around better album than his last Motown release, 2005's Gemini, it arguably ranks among his best three or four albums ever.\" In his review for Allmusic, Andy Kellman remarked that \"just about the smartest thing Brian McKnight could do in 2006 is collaborate with Tim & Bob, a veteran do-it-all studio duo who have quietly contributed to many of the best and/or most successful R&B; tracks [...] With 2005's Gemini and this release \u2013 two of his finest albums \u2013 McKnight is on something of a roll.\" Billboard magazine wrote: \"Now an elder statesman in the R&B; and pop arenas, McKnight offers another mood-setting mix of midtempo cuts and ballads.\" Margeaux Watson from Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C+ rating felt that \"Brian McKnight\u2019s slick sound is favored by the urban adult- contemporary set, and it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll win any new (read: young) fans with his 10th album. Mostly produced by the singer-songwriter himself, Ten is a merrily generic batch of R&B; grooves and slow jams.\" SoulTracks's Detrel Howell wrote that \"Ten will more than likely shine for Brian McKnight's diehard fans who support his music without fail; for me, it wasn't chock full of all that I'd hoped for after hearing \"Find Myself in You,\" but it won't be banished to the archives just yet.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2006) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2007) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums (Billboard) | 48 |} ==References== Category:Brian McKnight albums Category:2006 albums Category:Albums produced by Brian McKnight Category:Albums produced by Bryan- Michael Cox Category:Albums produced by Tim & Bob Category:Warner Records albums ",
