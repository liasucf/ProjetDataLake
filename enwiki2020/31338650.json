    "text": "The Sylvers III is the third album by the Los Angeles, California-based R&B; group the Sylvers. Released in 1974, it was produced by Perry Botkin, Jr. and Michael Viner. This was their last recording on MGM before they went to Capitol Records. The album is notable for having few songwriting credits from primary songwriter Leon Sylvers III. Instead, most of the writing is handled by Sharon Sylvers, group member James Sylvers and the Sylvers family matriarch Shirley Sylvers, who wrote three songs: \"Don't Give Up the Good Life\", \"What's It All About\" and \"TCB\". In May 2020, The Sylvers III was released to digital and streaming platforms under Republic Records. ==Reception== ==Track listing== *Credits adapted from liner notes.The Sylvers - The Sylvers III (LP liner notes).
