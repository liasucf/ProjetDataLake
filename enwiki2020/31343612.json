The original title was \"The Way I Be Pimpin\"The Way I Be Pimpin on YouTube which featured Royce da 5'9\" on the chorus and Dre rapping the verses. ==Concept== Dr. Dre did not rap on \"Xxplosive,\" instead the song features Kurupt, Nate Dogg, Hittman and Six-Two. In the first verse, Hittman raps about how pimping has made him a changed man due to \"all the girls\" saying \"now his shit's the bomb\" after claiming that \"girls used to turn him back.\" Kurupt, Nate Dogg, and Six-Two's verses deal with how good they are at pimping, how many girls they can get, and how much money they make through pimping. \"The Way I Be Pimpin\" (the original version of the song prior to \"Xxplosive\") basically has the same concept as \"Xxplosive\" with different lyrics. ==Charts== Along with a lot of songs from the 2001 album, the song charted on the Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs due to radio play after the album was released.
