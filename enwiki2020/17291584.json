    "text": "The Stephen Winsor House is a historic house in Smithfield, Rhode Island, United States. The -story wood-frame house was built c. 1850\u201355 by Stephen Winsor, whose family had long lived in the Smithfield area and owned extensive lands there. The house is a high-quality and well-preserved example of Italianate styling, with corner pilasters, deep bracketed eaves, and pointed- arch windows in the gables. The house remained in the Winsor family until c. 1970; it is set on a handsomely landscaped property (apparently also a long- standing feature), down a winding driveway on the north side of Austin Avenue. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Providence County, Rhode Island ==References== Category:Houses completed in 1850 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Rhode Island Category:Houses in Providence County, Rhode Island Category:Buildings and structures in Smithfield, Rhode Island Category:National Register of Historic Places in Providence County, Rhode Island ",
