    "text": "Katalin Karik\u00f3 (born 17 January 1955 in Szolnok, Hungary) is a Hungarian biochemist who specializes in RNA-mediated mechanisms. Her research has been the development of vitro-transcribed mRNA for protein therapies. She currently serves as the Senior Vice President at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals. Karik\u00f3's work includes scientific research of RNA-mediated immune activation resulting in the co-discovery of the nucleoside modifications that suppress the immunogenicity of RNA. This is seen as expanding the therapeutic potential of mRNA. She holds patents granted in the United States for application of non- immunogenic, nucleoside-modified RNA. She co-founded and served as CEO of RNARx from 2006-2013.. Katalin Karik\u00f3 is the mother of 2-time Olympic Gold Medalist Susan Francia. Katalin Karik\u00f3 == Early life and education == Kariko grew up in the Hungarian town of Kisujszallas where she attended M\u00f3ricz Zsigmond Reform\u00e1tus Gimn\u00e1zium. After earning her Ph.D., Karik\u00f3 continued her research and postdoctoral studies at the Institute of Biochemistry, Biological Research Centre, the Temple University Department of Biochemistry, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Science. While serving as postdoctoral fellow at Temple University in Philadelphia, Karik\u00f3 participated in a clinical trial in which patients with AIDS, hematological diseases and chronic fatigue were treated with dsRNA. At the time, this was considered groundbreaking research as the molecular mechanism of interferon induction by dsRNA was not known, but the antineoplastic effects of interferon were well documented. == Career == In 1990, while a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania, Karik\u00f3 submitted her first grant application in which she proposed to establish mRNA-based gene therapy, Ever since, mRNA-based therapy has been Karik\u00f3\u2019s primary research interest. Karik\u00f3 served for nearly 25 years as a Professor at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. In 2012, Karik\u00f3 and Drew Weissman, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania, received a patent for the use of several modified nucleosides to reduce the antiviral immune response to mRNA and they founded a small company. Soon after, UPenn sold the intellectual property license to Gary Dahl, the head of a lab supply company that eventually became Cellscript. Weeks later, Flagship Pioneering, the venture capital company who was and still is backing Moderna, contacted her in hopes of licensing the patent. All Karik\u00f3 said was \u201cwe don\u2019t have it.\u201d In early 2013, Karik\u00f3 heard of Moderna\u2019s $240 million deal with AstraZeneca to develop a VEGF mRNA. Karik\u00f3 realized she would not get a chance to apply her experience with mRNA at UPenn and took her role as Senior Vice President at BioNTech RNA Pharmaceuticals. Her research and specializations include Messenger RNA-based gene therapy, RNA-induced immune reactions, molecular bases of ischemic tolerance and treatment of brain ischemia. == Scientific contributions == The work and research of Karik\u00f3 has contributed to BioNTech\u2019s effort to create immune cells that produce vaccine antigens \u2014 Karik\u00f3\u2019s research revealed the ability to leverage the antiviral response to mRNA to give their cancer vaccines an extra boost in defense against tumors. == Patents == US8278036B2 & US8748089B2 \u2014 This invention provides RNA, oligoribonucleotide, and polyribonucleotide molecules comprising pseudouridine or a modified nucleoside, gene therapy vectors comprising same, methods of synthesizing same, and methods for gene replacement, gene therapy, gene transcription silencing, and the delivery of therapeutic proteins to tissue in vivo, comprising the molecules. The present invention also provides methods of reducing the immunogenicity of RNA, oligoribonucleotide, and polyribonucleotide molecules. == Select publications == * * * * * == References == == External links == *Katalin Kariko at Google Scholar Category:Living people Category:1955 births Category:Hungarian biochemists Category:People from Kis\u00fajsz\u00e1ll\u00e1s Category:Women biochemists ",
