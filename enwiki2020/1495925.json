During the reign of his father, he conquered Scotland. He came to power by killing the incumbent High King, Eochu Mumu, who had killed his father twenty- one years earlier. He fought many battles against the Cruithne, the Fir Bolg, the Fomorians and other peoples of Ireland, the people of the Orkney islands, and even the Longobardi. He was killed by Enna Airgdech, son of Eochu Mumu, in the battle of Carman, continuing the feud between the descendants of Erimon and \u00c9ber Finn. Geoffrey Keating, who interprets his epithet as meaning \"great hogs\", dates his reign to 1050\u20131032 BC, the Annals of the Four Masters to 1428\u20131410 BC.R. A.
