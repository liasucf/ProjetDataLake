It was purchased by Ignaz Schwinn, proprietor of bicycle manufacturer Arnold, Schwinn & Co. in 1912. In 1912, an Excelsior was the first motorcycle to be officially timed at a speed of 100 mph. The Henderson Motorcycle Company became a division of Excelsior when Schwinn purchased Henderson in 1917.Hatfield, pp.76-77 By 1928, Excelsior was in third place in the U.S. motorcycle market behind Indian and Harley-Davidson. The Great Depression convinced Schwinn to order Excelsior's operations to cease in September 1931. ==Excelsior BigX== The mainstay of Excelsior production through the 1910s and into the 1920s was the Model BigX. This had an inlet- over-exhaust v-twin engine, firstly with belt drive then with 2 speed and then 3 speed gearbox. Colors were grey with red panels in the early teens, the 'Military Model' of the late teens was in khaki (a green-brown shade) and 1920s models were in a very dark blue with fine gold pinstriping. Many were exported, Europe and Australia receiving a number of shipments. A very small number of BigX motorcycles were manufactured with engines in the 1920s. Production of the BigX continued until 1924, when it was replaced by the Super X. ==Excelsior Super X== Excelsior released its Super X model in 1925. The Super X was America's first motorcycle with a V-twin engine. It was conceived as a competitor to the smaller Indian Scout.Pioneers of American Motorcycle Racing by Daniel K. Statnekov, Chapter 22 In response to the Super X's popularity, Indian first raised the Scout's capacity to and then introduced the new Indian 101 Scout, while Harley-Davidson introduced their motorcycle, the Model D. ==End of production== In 1929, the stock market crash and the resulting Great Depression caused motorcycle sales to plummet. The summer of 1931 saw Schwinn call his department heads together for a meeting at Excelsior. He bluntly told them, with no prior indication, \u201cGentlemen, today we stop\u201d. Schwinn felt that the Depression could easily continue for eight years, and even worsen. Despite a full order book, he had chosen to pare back his business commitments to the core business of bicycle manufacture. All motorcycle operations at Excelsior ended by September 1931.Henderson History (retrieved 12 April 2010) ==References== ==See also== *List of motorcycles of the 1910s *List of motorcycles of the 1920s *List of motorcycles of the 1930s Category:Defunct motorcycle manufacturers of the United States Category:Motorcycles introduced in the 1900s Category:Motor vehicle manufacturers based in Illinois Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1907 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1931 Category:1907 establishments in Illinois Category:1931 disestablishments in Illinois ",
