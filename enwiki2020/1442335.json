    "text": "Elections in Monaco gives information on election and election results in Monaco. Monaco elects on national level a legislature (parliament). The National Council (Conseil National) has 24 members, elected for a five-year term, 16 elected by a winner-take-all plurality system, and the other 8 by proportional representation. Each voter may cast a ballot with up to 16 candidates' names. First, the 16 individuals with the most votes are elected. Then, votes are counted by party groups to fill the remaining 8 seats. E.g., if a party polled 51% of the votes it would probably win 20 out of 24 seats (all 16 of the winner-take-all seats and then 4 of the 8 proportional seats). ==Latest elections== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |align=left|Horizon Monaco||56,472||50.34||20||+15 |- |align=left|Union Mon\u00e9gasque||43,743||38.99||3||\u201311 |- |align=left|Renaissance||11,964||10.67||1||\u2013 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||222||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||5,088||100||24||0 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||6,825||74.55||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: Mairie de Monaco |} ==See also== * Electoral calendar * Electoral system ==References== ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Parties and elections Category:Politics of Monaco ",
