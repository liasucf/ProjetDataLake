    "text": "{| |} The Type 903 replenishment ship (NATO reporting name: Fuchi-class, also known as Qiandaohu-class) entered service with the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy in 2003. The class' chief designer was Zhang Wende (\u5f20\u6587\u5fb7). After two units completed, a pair of slightly modified units designated as Type 903A followed, and the main difference between Type 903 and Type 903A is that the displacement of the latter is increased to 23,000 tons from the original 20,500 ton. ==Ships of the class== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
