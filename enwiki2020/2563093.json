    "text": "The Soghain were a people of ancient Ireland. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh identified them as part of a larger group called the Cruithin, and stated of them: Of the Cruithin of Ireland are the D\u00e1l Araidhi (D\u00e1l nAraidi), the seven L\u00f3igisi of Leinster, the seven Soghain of Ireland, and every Conaille (see Conaille Muirtheimne) that is in Ireland. ==Locations== Early peoples and kingdoms of Ireland, c. 800 The location of four of the seven Soghain is as follows: * A branch in the territory of Fernmag (barony of Farney, County Monaghan). * In Delvin (County Westmeath) where a Soghain tribe lived with a branch of the Delbhna in an area called Tr\u00edcha c\u00e9t na Delbna M\u00f3ire agus na Sogan. * The Corcu Shogain, who were subject to the Benntraige under the Eoghanacht. An Ogham inscription discovered near Aglish in the barony of Muskerry, some twelve miles west of the city of Cork, displays the words MUCOI SOGINI, which probably means of the Corcu Sogain. * The Soghain of Connacht were located in central east County Galway, in a kingdom called T\u00edr Sogh\u00e1in. ==T\u00edr Sogh\u00e1in== The Soghain of Connacht were located in T\u00edr Sogh\u00e1in, an area in central east County Galway bounded by the river Suck on the east, the river Clare on the west; the Grange and Shiven rivers to the north; the Raford and Ballinure rivers to the south. A poem recorded in The Book of U\u00ed Maine, Cruas Connacht clanna Sogain, lists the kingdom's boundaries, which can be found to tie in with the above locations: *From \u00c1th an Ibar west *to Glais Uair Arnaigh *was the extent of Sodhan *that sword-guarded land. *From B\u00e9al na R\u00f3be in Maenmagh *to the clear, soft-reeded Simin *was the breath of the plain *which bore no ignominy. The previous, pre-Gaelic people of the area were called the Senchineoil. Very little information survives on them. The Soghain of Connacht were described by Se\u00e1n M\u00f3r \u00d3 Dubhag\u00e1in in his poem Triallam timcheall na Fodla where he states: The six Sogain let us not shun/their kings are without oblivion/Good the host of plundering excursions/to whom the spear-armed Sogain is hereditary. The Book of Lecan lists their six branches as Cinel Rechta, Cinel Trena, Cinel Luchta, Cinel Fergna, Cinel Domaingen and Cinel Deigill. The genealogy of Saint Kerrill of Cloonkeenkerrill is given as Caireall mac Curnain mac Treana mac Fionnchada mac Nair mac Earca mac Tiobraide mac Sodhain Salbhuidhe mac Fiacha Araidhe. His grandfather, Treana mac Fionnchada, was the eponym of the Cinel Trena, who were apparently located close to Knockma as evinced by the placename T\u00edr Mhic Trena (the land of the sons of Trena). This area was the western limit of the kingdom of the Connacht Soghain. Early Christian evangelists among the Soghain included Conainne, St Connell and Kerrill. Their successors include Naomh\u00e9id, Cuana of Kilcoonagh, Dubh\u00e1n, Felig, \u00cdbar, \u00cdomar of the Sogain, Laisren of Cloonkerrill, Maol Chosna, Modi\u00fait, Menott, Molua of Kilmoluagh. Parishes known to be included in T\u00edr Sogh\u00e1in were: * Abbeyknockmoy * Abbert * Ballymacward * Cloonkeenkerrill * Fohenagh * Lackagh * Kilconnell * Kilgerrill * Killascobe * Monivea * Moylough T\u00edr Sogh\u00e1in became subject to the U\u00ed Maine sometime during the first millennium. ==Descendants== Descendants of the Soghain are still found in great numbers in County Galway, bearing names such as Mannion, Ward/Mac an Bhaird, Gill/Gillane, Scarry, Duggan, Megan/McGann, Martin, Cassain. ==Annalistic references== * 811.
