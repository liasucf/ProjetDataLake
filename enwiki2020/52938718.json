He is known for his avant-garde works which use aleatory and graphic notation and were composed from the 1960s through the 1980s.Guerrieri, Matthew (26 April 2012). \"New England\u2019s Prospect: Echolocation\". NewMusicBox. Retrieved 21 January 2017. Van Nostrand was born in Los Angeles and began composing while still in high school in San Diego.

After his graduation from the NEC with a Masters in Music in 1971, he spent four years in the Netherlands at the Gaudeamus Foundation where several of his works were premiered. He stopped composing in the late 1980s but remained active as a cellist until 2000. There was renewed interest in his music following a concert of his early works at the New England Conservatory in 2012 and the release of a CD the following year containing his 1969 Voyage in a White Building I and two other works from that period.Ross, Alex (23 April 2013). \"Burr Van Nostrand\".

He also became acquainted with the music and instruments of Harry Partch who was a friend of Glasier's. He entered the New England Conservatory (NEC) in 1964, but while still a student at Hoover High School he had already had his compositions played by the San Diego Symphony and the La Jolla Chamber Orchestra.Bloom, Elizabeth (20 February 2014). \"Avant-garde composer back on the map\".

There was renewed interest in Van Nostrand's music in 2012 after Jason Belcher, a graduate student at NEC, heard a tape of Van Nostrand's Voyage in a White Building I which led to him retrieving other scores by Van Nostrand from the American Composers Alliance archives. Struck not only by the music which seemed very ahead of its time but also by the visual beauty and complexity of Van Nostrand's graphic notation, he began a project to re-introduce the composer and his works. This began with a concert of his early works at the NEC in 22 April 2012, followed by a recording on New World Records released in 2013, and a further concert of his works at the University of Pittsburgh in 2014.
