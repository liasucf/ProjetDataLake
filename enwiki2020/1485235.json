He wrote on an apple the words, \"I swear by Artemis that I will marry Acontius\", and threw it at her feet. She picked it up, and mechanically read the words aloud, which amounted to a solemn undertaking to carry them out. Unaware of this, she treated Acontius with contempt; but, although she was betrothed more than once, she always fell ill before the wedding took place. The Delphic oracle at last declared the cause of her illnesses to be the wrath of the offended goddess; whereupon her father consented to her marriage with Acontius.Aristaenetus, Epistolae, i.10 Antoninus Liberalis, tells the story with different names;Antoninus LIberalis.
