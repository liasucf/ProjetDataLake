    "text": "Picton, along with DX 5483 (in the Cato Blue livery). Corn-Cob was an informal term, promoted by the editors of NZ Railfan magazine, describing a New Zealand railway locomotive livery (resulting from the combination of green and yellow in the colour scheme) found in common usage amongst the railfan community. The livery was introduced on 5 May 2004 when Toll Rail took over the rail system from Tranz Rail and replaced the Bumble-Bee livery. The livery was replaced by the KiwiRail Phase One livery in July 2008. DX 5379 was the first locomotive to wear the livery. The livery represents the colours of Toll Rail and the colours of Australia. When KiwiRail took over the rail system from Toll Rail, the Toll brandings on the locomotives was covered by patched which had the KiwiRail logo on them. As of , one DHs, two DSCs, two DSJs and one TR still operate in this livery. ==Variations== Since the introduction of the livery in May 2004, there has only been one variation: *DXB 5143 received the livery in June 2008, had been repainted with a deeper yellow on the front of the cab, running boards and at each end of the loco, however the cab-sides were repainted in lighter shade of yellow. It also lacked the green stripes and Toll Rail insignia on the nose. This was only short-lived and the loco never operated in the livery. *Although not an official variation, DBR 1295 wore the livery without the Toll Rail branding on the short-hood. ==Lists of locomotives that wore/wear the Corn-Cob livery== DAR class: *517 \\- now scrapped DBR class: *1295 \\- now preserved by the Glenbrook Vintage Railway DC class: *4093 \\- repainted in the MAXX blue livery and now scrapped *4605 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *4801 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *4818 \\- repainted in the KiwiRail Bold livery and now preserved by the Glenbrook Vintage Railway *4830 \\- now scrapped DF class: *7023 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *7186 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *7307 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *7348 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery DH class: *2839 *2851 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery DQ class: *6324 \\- shipped overseas *6347 \\- shipped overseas DSC class: *2216 \\- now scrapped *2379 \\- now in the KiwiRail livery *2462 *2720 DSG class: *3046 \\- now in the KiwiRail livery DSJ class: *4004 \\- now in the KiwiRail livery *4032 *4060 DX class: *5074 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5114 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5143 \\- now in the KiwiFruit livery *5172 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5206 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5212 \\- repainted in the KiwiRail Bold livery and is now under overhaul at Hutt Workshops *5241 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5258 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5264 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5270 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5287 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5356 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5379 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5385 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5402 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5425 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5431 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5477 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *5500 \\- repainted in the KiwiRail Bold livery and is now under overhaul at Hutt Workshops *8007 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery *8022 \\- now in the KiwiRail Bold livery TR class: *845 *897 \\- now in the KiwiRail livery *914 \\- now in the KiwiRail livery == Gallery == Image:Tollnz DAR.jpg|DAR 517 in Whareroa, near H\u0101wera.
