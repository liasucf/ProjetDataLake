    "text": "\"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\" is a song written and recorded by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was released as a single (b/w \"Landfall\") on ABC Dunhill 12305 in August 1977. It was first released on his 1977 album Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes. It reached number 37 on the Billboard Hot 100, number 24 on the Hot Country Songs chart, and number 11 on the Easy Listening chart. This song begins with an instrumental introduction which initially resembles the chorus of \"Yellow Bird\" (originally a 19th-century Haitian song, which gained popularity in the U.S. through a Hawaiian-flavored instrumental by the Arthur Lyman group in 1961), and then it evolves into the distinctive chorus of this song itself. Billboard described the song as using \"sailing and sun -drenched island imagery\" and \"catchy, Caribbean instrumentation\" while having a \"more serious tone\" than Buffett's previous single \"Margaritaville.\" The phrase \"and son of a bitches\" was edited out of the single version of the song, replaced by \"some bruises, some stitches\". Although American Top 40 did play the original unedited version only once when it debuted at No. 38 on 10/22/77.Casey Kasem's American Top 40 \u2013 The 70's from October 22, 1977 \"Changes in Latitudes, Changes in Attitudes\" is one of Buffett's more popular songs with fans, and is part of \"The Big 8\" that he has played at almost all of his concerts. Recorded live versions of the song appear on You Had to Be There, and the video Live by the Bay. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1977) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|37 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks |align=\"center\"|11 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Country Singles |align=\"center\"|24 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Top Singles |align=\"center\"|34 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary Tracks |align=\"center\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Country Tracks |align=\"center\"|21 |} ==Notes== ==External links== *Lyrics at BuffettWorld.com Category:1977 songs Category:Jimmy Buffett songs Category:Songs written by Jimmy Buffett Category:ABC Records singles Category:Dunhill Records singles ",
