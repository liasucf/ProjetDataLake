    "text": "\u00a5eah \u00a5eah \u00a5eah No is the third official EP by multi-instrumentalist and Dutch singer Jett Rebel. The EP was released on January 18, 2019 without any announcement. The first and only single of this EP was launched on June 7, 2019, Waiting For The Weekend. This coincided with Rebel's first encounter in England. On June 11, 2019, Rebel put on his first show in Notting Hill Arts Club in London. ==Single== In an interview with the Ventsmagazine, Rebel explains what Waiting For The Weekend is about, The song is about the drag of everyday life, the boring life. I feel so many of us are waiting for the \u201cweekend\u201d. Personally I don\u2019t really have this separation between weekdays and weekend anymore, because I work all the time. If I happen to have a real day off, it\u2019s usually rather a Monday or Tuesday. \u201cThe Weekend\u201d so the weekend is whenever we are free to be who we wanna be, and to do what we wanna do. '' ==Recording== \u00a5eah \u00a5eah \u00a5eah No was recorded live at the Wisseloord Studios. For the second time Rebel went into the studio with the power trio Jett Rebel 3, this time with drummer Willem van der Krabben and bassist Xander Vrienten. This is also the 2nd time Rebel chooses not to do everything on his own, just like in 2016 when recording the album Don't Die On Me Now. \"Everything you hear on the record sounds exactly as it should be, Rebel says to music news from the UK\". For this EP there are 3 extra tracks played live but in the end they didn't make it to the EP. Tracks: Lady On The Hill, Bleed Me An Ocean and Slowdancer. These tracks are regularly played live during performances at festivals or a tour. Something he does more often during his live shows, performing unreleased work. ==Track listening== All songs written by Jett Rebel # # \"Waiting For The Weekend\" - 1:58 # \"Take Me\" - 3:23 # \"Dancing Through The Room\" - 3:34 # \"Do You Want Me\" - 3:29 # \"I See You\" - 4:25 ==Personnel== The EP is written, composed, arranged and produced by Jett Rebel.
