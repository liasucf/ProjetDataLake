Pacific Green products are distributed internationally. ==History== Post & Rail Furniture was started by Bruce Dowse and Peter Ryan in 1973 in Sydney, Australia. As it expanded internationally in the late 1980s, the company rebranded as Pacific Green. Its purpose was to create a viable substitute for tropical hardwoods by recycling plantation coconut palms. Although palms are extremely hard and durable, their unique properties made them difficult to work using conventional techniques. At Sigatoka in the Fijian Islands, Pacific Green set up the world's first factory - Pacific Green Industries (Fiji) Limited - dedicated to the research and development of coconut palms. Palmwood was chosen as the sustainable exterior wood for Masdar, the world's first 'eco-city' in Abu Dhabi, including gates, screens and doors.http://www.greenprophet.com/2011/02/pacific-green-masdar- gates/ ==Development of hardwood substitutes== Palmwood was the name Pacific Green gave to the finished \u2018hardwood\u2019 material it developed. Process breakthroughs had created a durable consumer-oriented product that was suitable in a variety of climates and resilient to wood-boring insects. Palmwood is an ecologically sustainable timber alternative.http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/resources/links/deforestation ==Indigenous design== The designs of the furniture - by Bruce Dowse and his Australian design team - are inspired by the artefacts and tools of traditional societies, using natural materials sourced from around the World. Each piece is handcrafted by artisans using traditional techniques and is designed to give a sense of its global ethnic origins.

By recycling unproductive coconut palms, old plantation land was returned to the local villages to replant with young fruit-bearing palms and other cash crops. The factory was built in consultation with the surrounding villages, and the land used was leased from the villagers to respect local ownership. Pacific Green Industries (Fiji) Limited is listed on the South Pacific Stock Exchange and its majority owners are the Fijian people. Manufacturing processes use no toxins or chemicals and by-products are reused. In 2001, Pacific Green addressed the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) on the social responsibility of manufacturing companies. Pacific Green also advised the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization on its study on Coconut Palm Stems.http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/ag335e/AG335E03.htm#ch2 From the mid-1990s to early-2000s, actor Pierce Brosnan was the company's Environmental Spokesperson. As a result, Pacific Green was invited to participate at the World Expo 2010 within the Pacific Pavilion.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2010expo/2010-08/20/content_11180648_2.htm Pacific Green unveiled the Indigenous Masterpieces concept at its debut in Milan's Salone del Mobile in 2011. ==References== ==External links== * Pacific Green international site * Pacific Green Australia site * Pacific Green Architecture (Palmwood) site Category:Companies based in Sydney Category:Design companies established in 1973 Category:Manufacturing companies established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Australia ",
