    "text": "Washington International Renewable Energy Conference is a meeting of senior- level representatives from the Executive and Legislative branches of the United States government at the national and sub-national level, international organizations, the finance and business community, and civil society who are working to advance the integration of renewable energy in their countries. It is hosted in cooperation with the American Council On Renewable Energy (ACORE). == Official Side Events == Official Side Events are a forum for non- governmental, governmental, and/or inter-governmental partners to showcase their projects/programs in front of a high level public and private sector audience. == History == One of the major accomplishments of the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa, was the recognition that renewable energy is a critical component of sustainable development, energy security, climate change, and air quality. Worldwide enthusiasm for renewable energy has increased dramatically since WSSD, both multilaterally (e.g., 2004 Bonn Renewable Energy Conference, 2005 Beijing International Renewable Energy Conference, G-8, etc.), bilaterally, and nationally. Nations now more fully recognize the imperative to promote widespread adoption of renewable energy, such as bio-fuels, wind, solar, geothermal, and hydro energies, into their countries' energy mix to promote sustained economic growth, social development, and environmental stewardship. == See also == *Grid parity *International Renewable Energy Agency *Renewable energy in the United States == References == * === Footnotes === == External links == * Trade Show at WIREC 2008 Category:2008 conferences Category:Political conferences Category:Renewable energy in the United States Category:International conferences in the United States ",
