The two lords wanted a settlement and in 1270, they both gave some of their property to make this happen. In 1283, the fortress was given the privilege of a town. After a turbulent genesis with plenty of sieges and devastation, with the 17th century more peaceful times started. The city ramparts saved the city from floods in 1809', 14 juin 1809. and 1820. Due to an economical crisis in the 1930s and World War II, the city decayed. In 1970, the Provinciale Staten of South Holland initiated a reconstruction and restoration of the fortress and the city. This work was finished in 1998. Nieuwpoort was a separate municipality until 1986, when it became part of Liesveld. The last has become part of Molenwaard in 2013. ==References== ==External links== * Image gallery Nieuwpoort * Map of the former municipality, around 1868.
