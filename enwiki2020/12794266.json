    "text": "Bonds is a village in Lancashire, England. It lies immediately south of Garstang town centre, on the opposite bank of the River Wyre. It is bounded by the Lancaster Canal to the south and west. Garstang, Bonds, Bowgreave and Catterall form an almost continuous built-up area, which was bypassed by the A6 road in 1928.The Times, 28 Oct 1928, page 18 (Some sources state, incorrectly, that this occurred in 1926.). While it is often regarded as a de facto suburb of Garstang, Bonds forms part of a different civil parish: Barnacre-with-Bonds. The Roman Catholic church of St Mary and St Michael is a Gothic Revival building consecrated in 1858, superseding a chapel built in 1784.) east of the village is the ruin of Greenhalgh Castle, built in 1490 for Thomas Stanley. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Barnacre-with-Bonds ==Notes== ==References== * * ==External links== *Barnacre-with-Bonds Parish Council Category:Villages in Lancashire Category:Garstang ",
