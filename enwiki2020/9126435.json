    "text": "Stanislav Kol\u00edbal (born November 12, 1925 in Orlov\u00e1, Czechoslovakia) is a Czech artist and sculptor. His work is counted among the fundamentals of modern Czech art. Since the 1950s, Stanislav Kol\u00edbal has been one of the most notable personalities on the Czech art scene. He was a leading figure in the group \u201cUB 12\u201d, which played an important role in the 1960s. His language is geometry, his predominant theme the relation of illusion and reality. Eventually his emphasis turned to the need for finding rules and order. It is a meditation on the problems engendered by and linked to man's presence on Earth. From drawings used as ground plans, Stavby (Buildings), i.e. wooden and metal objects, that became Kol\u00edbal\u2019s preoccupation since the second half of the 1980s, came into being. Stanislav Kol\u00edbal has been drawing and sculpting simultaneously with his work in architecture and other creative pursuits for more than 60 years. His cycles of drawings are a key to the understanding of his highly sophisticated art. He has exhibited in numerous museums and important exhibitions: the 5th exhibition of \"the Sculpture of Twenty Nations\" at the Guggenheim in New York, \"Paris Prague\" at the Mus\u00e9e d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris, and \"Painting and Sculpture Today\" (1980) at the Indianapolis Museum of Art. ==External links== * Stanislav Kol\u00edbal at MoMA * Article about Kol\u00edbal *Stanislav Kolibal celebrates his 80th birthday with a new exhibition. | Radio Prague *Stanislav Kol\u00edbal Conctructions *TATE Collection Stanislav Kol\u00edbal *Artist Stanislav Kol\u00edbal ARTLIST- database of contemporary Czech art Category:1925 births Category:Living people Category:People from Orlov\u00e1 Category:Czech male sculptors Category:20th-century Czech sculptors Category:21st-century Czech sculptors Category:Recipients of Medal of Merit (Czech Republic) ",
