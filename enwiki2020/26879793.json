    "text": "The 2001\u201302 season was Juventus Football Club's 104th in existence and 100th consecutive season in the top flight of Italian football. Juventus ended a three-year drought of league titles, following a remarkable turnaround in fortunes during the final days of the season, when Inter suffered from a collapse of nerves in the closing stages. On the final day of the league season, Juventus won 2\u20130 away from home against Udinese, while Inter fell at Lazio 4\u20132, despite leading twice. That handed Juventus its 26th Serie A title, and made up for the disappointing exit from the second group stage in the UEFA Champions League. As for individual players, the season saw new goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon claiming a stature as the best keeper in the world, while David Trezeguet got his Serie A breakthrough, sharing the topscoring title with Dario H\u00fcbner of Piacenza. Alessandro Del Piero also played a crucial part in the success, scoring 16 goals. Apart from Buffon, pre-season saw three significant signings. Lilian Thuram came from Parma along with Buffon, but failed to establish himself as centre-back and ended up on the right wing-back position. Pavel Nedv\u011bd came from Lazio as a replacement for departed Zinedine Zidane after Pavel Nedv\u011bd snubbed Manchester United, and performed at an acceptable level, without finding the form he had shown a few years before. Fellow Lazio signing Marcelo Salas was however a major flop, completely failing to get on terms in the new environment, spending almost the entire season injured. The sale of Zin\u00e9dine Zidane to Real Madrid of Spain from Juventus, was the world football transfer record at the time, costing the Spanish club around \u20ac75 million. The intake of Gianluigi Buffon from Parma cost Juventus \u20ac45 million, making it the most expensive transfer for a goalkeeper of all-time. ==Players== ===Squad information=== ===Left club during season=== ===Reserve squad=== ==Competitions== ===Serie A=== ====League table==== ====Results summary==== ====Results by round==== ====Matches==== ===Coppa Italia=== ====Round of 16==== ====Quarter-finals==== ====Semi- finals==== ====Final==== ===UEFA Champions League=== ====Group stage==== ====Second group stage==== ==Statistics== ===Appearances and goals=== :Not including Coppa Italia appearances |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center| Goalkeepers |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center| Defenders |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center| Midfielders |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center| Forwards |- ! colspan=14 style=background:#dcdcdc; text- align:center| Players transferred out during the season ==References== Category:Juventus F.C. seasons Juventus Category:Italian football championship-winning seasons ",
