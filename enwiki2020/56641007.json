The monastery is located in the hills of Eastern Serbia, on the right bank of Vitovnica River, some ten kilometres east of the town of Petrovac na Mlavi (Petrovac on the Mlava) and about 120 kilometres south-east of the capital, Belgrade. ==The Foundation of Vitovnica== The monastery was built by the Serbian king Stephen Milutin Nemanji\u0107 in 1291, after his victory over renegade noblemen Drman and Kudelin.\u041f\u0443\u0442\u0435\u0448\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u043f\u043e \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, \u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0408\u043e\u0430\u043a\u0438\u043c \u0412\u0443\u0458\u0438\u045b, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, 1901. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 Drman and Kudelin had seized the region by force and turned it into an outlaw base from which they raided the neighbouring districts.\u0412\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0435\u045a\u0435: \u201e\u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440, \u0446\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u045a\u0430 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435 \u0411\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0438\u0446\u0435 \u0412\u0438\u0442\u043e\u0432\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430\u201c, 22. \u043c\u0430\u0440\u0442 2013, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0443\u043f 20.8.2013 King Milutin founded Vitovnica as a token of gratitude for his victory over the enemy.\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0426\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 \u0443 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0459\u0435\u0432\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438, \u041c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442 \u041c\u0438\u0445\u0430\u0458\u043b\u043e, \u0411\u0435\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434, 1895. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 ==The Monastery in the Sixteenth Century== From the sixteenth century onwards, Vitovnica is mentioned quite frequently both in the Serbian and Ottoman sources. According to the Ottoman census of 1537, the monastery was inhabited by three monks and paying high taxes, a detail which suggests it was on a solid footing. ==Vitovnica Gospel== The famous Vitovnica Gospel also dates from the sixteenth century. It is a manuscript gospel produced in the monastery in the first half of the sixteenth century. We know for certain that it was bound in gilt silver in 1557. The binding was created by Vuk Kondo, renowned goldsmith of the era, who left a certificate of his craftsmanship on the upper side of the precious metalwork.\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441 \u0441\u0440\u043f\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u0444\u0440\u0443\u0448\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0438\u0440\u0430 1753. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435, \u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0414\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0420\u0443\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0446, \u0421\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u0440\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0446\u0438, 1905. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 The Gospel is written in black ink, and the more important notes are emphasised in molten gold.

One of the monastery books dating from before 1620 is preserved in Kiev library. It bears the following inscription: \u201cThis book was donated to Vitovnica Monastery by the hieromonk Nikephoros.\u201d\u0417\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438 \u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0438, \u0430\u0443\u0442\u043e\u0440: \u0409\u0443\u0431\u043e\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u043e\u0458\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b, 1079 After the Great Turkish War between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, in 1690 the monks removed the treasures of Vitovnica for safekeeping to the Serbian monastery of Be\u0161enovo which lay across the Danube in Austria-Hungary. ==Vitovnica Chalice == The goblet known as Vitovnica Chalice dates from this period. It was made in silver in 1652. The faces and the halos of saints depicted on it are gold plated. It is now kept in the Museum of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Belgrade. ==The Monastery in the Eighteenth Century == When the inventory of the Be\u0161enovo monastery was taken in 1753, the property of Vitovnica was still registered separately.\u0418\u0437\u0432\u0435\u0448\u0442\u0430\u0458 \u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u0440\u0445\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430 \u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b\u0430 \u0438\u04371733, \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0421\u0423\u0414 \u043a\u045a\u0438\u0433\u0430 56, 1884. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435 Vitovnica\u2019s treasures remained in Be\u0161enovo until World War Two, when Be\u0161enovo was robbed and torched by the Ustashis, the forces of the Croatian fascist state. ==The Monastery in the Nineteenth Century - the Time of Restoration and Growth== After Serbia was liberated from Turkish rule at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Vitovnica began its revival. The mid-nineteenth century marks a significant rise in monastery\u2019s fortunes. The hegumenos (abbot) Stefan Bojovi\u0107 is still remembered as symbolising Vitovnica\u2019s restoration in this period. It seems that the entire monastery complex was rebuilt by around 1856. The monastery had prospered so much that it was able to build a primary school in the village of Vitovnica at its own expense in 1861. ==Hegumenos Methodius== Methodius Milovanovi\u0107 was the hegumenos (abbot) of Vitovnica between 1896 and 1902. As well as being the leader of the monastery he was also the founder of the Serbian Beekeeping Society in 1897, and the founder of the Beekeeper journal which continues to be published to this day. He was the journal\u2019s leading theorist and polemicist, and made a considerable contribution to the development of beekeeping in Serbia\u0408\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d \u043d\u0430\u0448 \u043f\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043d, \u041f\u0447\u0435\u043b\u0430\u0440, \u0431\u0440 1. \u0437\u0430 1930. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0443, \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 21. ==The First Half of the Twentieth Century \u2013 Vitovnica Catastrophe== Vitovnica\u2019s progress was halted by historical circumstances in the first half of the twentieth century. During World War One, between 1915 and 1918, the part of Serbia in which the monastery is situated found itself in the Bulgarian zone of occupation. In 1915, the Bulgarians took Isaiah Bogdanovi\u0107, the then hegumenos (abbot) of Vitovnica, to a prison camp and killed him. Bulgarian soldiers then plundered Vitovnica. The entire archival collection was destroyed. The monastery had no time to recover from its sufferings under Bulgarian occupation before it was hit by new waves of suffering, first under German occupation in World War Two, and then under the communist rule. In 1943, because of an attack against a German patrol which took place in the vicinity of Vitovnica, German commanders decided to torch the monastery. All of its buildings perished in flames, except for the church itself, the bell tower of which was partly burned. Hieromonk Sava Markovic. He was 33 when killed by local communist. All the dormitories and all the auxiliary buildings of the monastery complex, everything that had been rebuilt painstakingly and with great hardship throughout the nineteenth century, was destroyed. The brotherhood saved their own lives by hiding in the surrounding woods. Nonetheless, the Germans managed to capture the hierodeacon Avakum Mom\u010dilovic who was taken to the Banjica concentration camp in Belgrade and killed. When the local communists came to power in 1945, they killed the remaining monks and seized the monastery property. Among the monks killed by the communist villagers of Vitovnica was the hegumanos (abbot) Mardarius Zdravkovi\u0107. Hieromonk Sava Markovi\u0107 was thirty three when he was killed. The post-war period thus saw a monastery deprived of both its buildings and its fraternity of monks. ==The Second Half of the Twentieth Century - Painstaking Restoration== Hieromonk Chrisostomos was sent to the deserted and torched ruins of the monastery by the church authorities in 1946. In exceptionally difficult circumstances, without a roof over his head, Chrisostomos began to rebuild the monastery. He can be credited with Vitovnica\u2019s very survival in these hardest of times. In spite of the enormity of its suffering in the first half of the twentieth century the monastery saw renewed progress because of the great efforts of its monks. It is now partly restored and the process is ongoing. ==Saint Thaddeus of Vitovnica== Saint Thaddeus was for many years the hegumanos (abbot) of Vitovnica monastery. Saint Thaddeus of Vitovnica was born on 6 October 1914 in the village of Vitovnica, close to the monastery. He took holy orders in 1935. He became the hegumanos (abbot) of Vitovnica in 1962. He died in 2003. The faithful recognise him as a contemporary saint, and his tomb in Vitovnica attracts a large number of visitors. ==Gallery== File:Milutinvit2.JPG|Saint King Milutin, (founder's portrait (fresco) in Vitovnica monastery, painted around 1850).
