    "text": "The John F. Kennedy Memorial is located on Ocean Street in Hyannis, Massachusetts. It overlooks Lewis Bay, where President Kennedy often sailed throughout his life while in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. It consists of a large stone wall with two bronze medallions, one of President Kennedy's bust profile on the front facing the bay and the other of the Great Seal of the United States on the back, a reflecting pool and fountain, a large concrete terrace, and landscaping. The fountain is lit from the bottom of the reflecting pool, invoking the John F. Kennedy Eternal Flame at Arlington National Cemetery. Inscribed around the reflecting pool is a quote from President Kennedy's Radio and Television Report to the American People on the State of the National Economy on August 13, 1962: \"I believe it is important that this country sail and not lie still in the harbor.\" The memorial was commissioned by the citizens of Barnstable, Massachusetts and dedicated on July 8, 1966. Donald Durell of Falmouth, Massachusetts was the memorial's architect and J. Paul Lanza of Simsbury, Connecticut, formerly of West Yarmouth, Massachusetts was its general contractor. The sculptor Agop Minass Agopoff, recommended to President Kennedy's widow Jacqueline by Gloria Vanderbilt, created the bust profile that was cast in bronze by Jose Greco III, nephew of the famous dancer Jose Greco. The letter carving of the memorial and the reflecting pool was done by the John Stevens Shop of Newport, Rhode Island. Materials were sourced from across the Northeastern United States, primarily from Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The memorial is overseen by the Town of Barnstable JFK Memorial Trust Fund Committee. A restoration of the 50-year old memorial is being planned by the Town of Barnstable. ==See also== * List of memorials to John F. Kennedy ==References== Category:Monuments and memorials to John F.
