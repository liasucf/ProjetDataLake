    "text": "Director Nicholas Ray (left) with actor Cory Osceola during filming of Wind Across the Everglades Chana Eden and Emmett Kelly on set Wind Across the Everglades is a 1958 film directed by Nicholas Ray. Ray was fired from the film before production was finished, and several scenes were completed by screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who also supervised the editing. Chris Fujiwara wrote on Turner Classic Movies that the film is \"an acid test for auteurists, one of those special films that, while ignored or despised for the most part, are cherished and fiercely defended by those who love great American directors.\" The film stars Burl Ives, features Christopher Plummer in his first lead role (and his second film role overall) and introduces Chana Eden, who plays the leading lady, and Peter Falk, who plays a minor role. Former stripper Gypsy Rose Lee and circus clown Emmett Kelly also are among those in an unusual cast. It was filmed on location in Everglades National Park in Technicolor. ==Plot== Set in the early 20th century, the film follows a game warden (Christopher Plummer) who arrives in Florida in the hopes of enforcing conservation laws. He soon finds himself pitted against Cottonmouth (Burl Ives), the leader of a fierce group of bird poachers. The film was loosely based upon the life and death of Guy Bradley, an early game warden who in 1905 was shot and killed by plume hunters in the Everglades.Wilbanks, William.

In a short review of the film, critic Jonathan Rosenbaum described it as \"a kind of litmus test for auteurists\".Chicago Reader: Wind Across the Everglades After citing the film's editorial history, Rosenbaum goes on to say that \"Ray's masterful use of color and mystical sense of equality between the antagonists (also evident in Rebel Without a Cause and Bitter Victory) are made all the more piquant here by his feeling for folklore and outlaw ethics as well as his cadenced mise en scene.\" While it was praised for its ahead-of-its-time ecological themes and authentic and unusual scenery, the film still suffered from \"editorial hacking and post- production cheapness\" leading to an overall effect of \"one of those production disasters that bleeds brilliance in all directions.\" ==See also== * List of American films of 1958 ==References== ==External links== * * * The AFI Catalog of Feature Films:Wind Across the Everglades Category:1958 films Category:1958 drama films Category:American drama films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Nicholas Ray Category:Films set in Florida Category:Films set in the 1900s Category:Films shot in Florida Category:Films about hunters Category:Films scored by Paul Sawtell ",
