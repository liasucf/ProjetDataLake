    "text": "Charles-Th\u00e9odore Millot (28 June 1829 \u2013 17 May 1889) was a French general who distinguished himself in the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u201371) and the Tonkin Campaign (1883\u201386). His victories at B\u1eafc Ninh (March 1884) and H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a brought to an end the two-year undeclared war in northern Vietnam between France and China, and paved the way for the conclusion of the Tientsin Accord between the two countries on 11 May 1884. Millot resigned as general-in-chief of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps shortly after the outbreak of the Sino- French War on 23 August 1884 and returned to France. == Command of Tonkin Expeditionary Corps == In early 1884 the arrival of substantial reinforcements from France and the African colonies raised the strength of the expeditionary corps to over 10,000 men. Its new commander, g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de division Charles- Th\u00e9odore Millot (1829\u20131889), organised this force into two brigades. The 1st Brigade was commanded by g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade Louis Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle (1827\u20131896), who had earlier made his reputation as governor of Senegal. The 2nd Brigade was commanded by g\u00e9n\u00e9ral de brigade Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier (1842\u20131913), a charismatic young Foreign Legion commander who had recently quelled a serious Arab rebellion in Algeria. General Millot and his staff, summer 1884. The charismatic young general Fran\u00e7ois de N\u00e9grier is sitting second to Millot's right Millot commanded the expeditionary corps for eight months, from February to September 1884. During his tenure of command he organised two major campaigns to capture B\u1eafc Ninh and H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a (March and April 1884) and two more modest expeditions to capture Th\u00e1i Nguy\u00ean and Tuy\u00ean Quang (May and June 1884). In the B\u1eafc Ninh campaign he won a spectacular walkover victory against Xu Yanxu's Guangxi Army. At the Capture of H\u01b0ng H\u00f3a, he flanked Liu Yongfu out of a formidable defensive system without losing a man. Having argued strenuously against sending a column to occupy L\u1ea1ng S\u01a1n in the heat of the Tonkin summer, he emerged unscathed from the official enquiry into the circumstances of the B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush (June 1884). Millot was arguably the most successful of the many commanders of the expeditionary corps, but he was unpopular with both his officers and his men, who considered him overcautious. Significantly, his decision to halt General de N\u00e9grier's pursuit of the defeated Chinese forces in the B\u1eafc Ninh campaign was held against him, even though he had sound military reasons for this decision. The troops immediately gave sardonic Vietnamese nicknames to their three generals. The much-admired de N\u00e9grier became Maolen ('Quick!'), Bri\u00e8re de l'Isle Mann Mann ('Slow!'), and Millot Toi Toi ('Stop!'). Millot's career in Tonkin ended on a sour note. In poor health, and dismayed at the way the French government used the B\u1eafc L\u1ec7 ambush as a pretext for war with China, he submitted his resignation in September 1884. In his last order of the day, he described himself as 'a sick and disappointed man'.Thomazi, Conqu\u00eate, 233\u20134 ==Notes== ==References== * Huard, La guerre du Tonkin (Paris, 1887) * Huguet, L., En colonne: souvenirs de l'Extr\u00eame-Orient (Paris, 1888) * Lung Chang [\u9f8d\u7ae0], Yueh- nan yu Chung-fa chan-cheng [\u8d8a\u5357\u8207\u4e2d\u6cd5\u6230\u722d, Vietnam and the Sino-French War] (Taipei, 1993) * Thomazi, A., Histoire militaire de l'Indochine fran\u00e7aise (Hanoi, 1931) * Thomazi, A., La conqu\u00eate de l'Indochine (Paris, 1934) Category:1829 births Category:1889 deaths Category:French military personnel of the Franco-Prussian War Category:People of the Tonkin campaign Category:French generals ",
