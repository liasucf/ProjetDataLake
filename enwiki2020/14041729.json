    "text": "In enzymology, an isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :3-methylbutanoyl-CoA + acceptor \\rightleftharpoons 3-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA + reduced acceptor Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA and acceptor, whereas its two products are 3-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA and reduced acceptor. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include isovaleryl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, isovaleroyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase, and 3-methylbutanoyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation. It employs one cofactor, FAD. ==Structural studies== As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code . It was created by a group containing K.A.Tiffany, D.L.Roberts, M.Wang, R.Paschke, A.-W.A.Mohsen, J.Vockley, and J.J.P.Kim. The structure was released on May 20th, 1998. ==Leucine metabolism== ==References== * * * Category:EC 1.3.8 Category:Flavin enzymes Category:Enzymes of known structure Category:Mitochondrial proteins ",
