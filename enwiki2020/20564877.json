    "text": "Haymans Green is a 2008 album by The Pete Best Band, released by Lightyear Entertainment and distributed in the US and Canada by EMI. Pete Best plays drums, and co-wrote most of the tracks. Reviews of the album have been mostly favourable, and almost all reviewers agree that the album sounds influenced by The Beatles, a band which Pete Best was a member of between 1960 and 1962. The album's cover shows the section of the Hamburg-era photograph of The Beatles featuring Best's face that was removed as part of the collage design for the Beatles' Anthology 1 album. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Pete Best \u2013 Drums *Roag Best \u2013 Drums, Percussion *Tony Flynn \u2013 Guitar, Vocals, Lead vocals on 4, 9RadioRockonTour review *Phil Melia \u2013 Guitar, Harmonica, Vocals, Lead vocal on 3 *Paul Parry \u2013 Guitar, Piano, Keyboards, Vocals, Lead vocals on all tracks except 3, 4, 8 *Engineers \u2013 Nic Johnston and Kenny Jones ==References== ==Notes== Category:2008 albums Category:Pete Best albums ",
