    "text": "Birds Bakery, is a bakery chain based in Derby, England. the chain has 65 outlets across the Midlands. ==History== Birds was founded by Frank, Thomas and Reginald Bird after they purchased Peach\u2019s bakery and pork butchers on Upper Dale Road in 1919. Eight years later they opened their second shop on Normanton Road and continued to expand across the town. When the last of the three brothers, Frank Bird, died in 1951, the bakery was taken over by two more members of the family, Reg and Paul Bird. In 1971 production was moved to a new building at Ascot Drive with their previous headquarters being demolished, and by 1972 Birds employed 300 people and operated 18 retail shops. In 2017 the 60th Birds shop opened in Sinfin and the chain is continuing to expand, with 65 outlets . ==Controversy== In 2020, Megan Metcalfe, who was the Store Manager of the Radcliffe-on-Trent branch, was sacked for gross misconduct after she accepted cash payments from elderly customers without bank cards during the COVID-19 pandemic. This led to a petition being created calling for Ms Metcalfe, an employee with over 40 years of service to Birds, to be re-instated or compensated, which as of has over 13,000 signatures. ==References== ==External links== * Website * Companies House listing Category:1919 establishments in England Category:Bakeries of the United Kingdom Category:British companies established in 1919 Category:Companies based in Derby Category:English brands Category:Food and drink companies established in 1919 Category:Retail companies of the United Kingdom Category:Retail companies established in 1919 ",
