There is no reseeding, so if the #8 team were to defeat the #1 seed it would continue in the tournament playing the team which would have faced the #1 seed in the subsequent round (winner of #4 vs. #5). ==Seeds== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Seed !School !Conference !Overall !Tiebreaker |- | 1 | align=left| Belmont | 16\u20130 | 24\u20135 | |- | 2 | align=left| Morehead State | 11\u20135 | 21\u20138 | |- | 3 | align=left| SIU- Edwardsville | 9\u20137 | 13\u201316 | |- | 4 | align=left| Tenn-Martin | 8\u20138 | 11\u201318 | 1\u20131 vs. Austin Peay, 1\u20130 vs. Tenn Tech |- | 5 | align=left|Austin Peay | 8\u20138 | 14\u201315 | 1\u20131 vs. Tenn-Martin, 0\u20131 vs. Tenn Tech |- | 6 | align=left|Tennessee Tech | 7\u20139 | 10\u201319 | 3\u20131 EKU, SEMO & Murray State |- | 7 | align=left|Eastern Kentucky | 7\u20139 | 10\u201319 | 2\u20132 vs. Tenn Tech, SEMO, & Murray State, 1\u20130 vs. SEMO |- | 8 | align=left|Southeast Missouri State | 7\u20139 | 13\u201316 | 2\u20132 vs. Tenn Tech, EKU, & Murray State, 0\u20131 vs. EKU |} ==Bracket== ==See also== *2017 Ohio Valley Conference Men's Basketball Tournament ==References== ==External links== *2017 OVC Men's & Women's Basketball Championship Category:Ohio Valley Conference Women's Basketball Tournament Category:Basketball in Nashville, Tennessee Category:2016\u201317 Ohio Valley Conference women's basketball season ",
