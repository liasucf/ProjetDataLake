    "text": "120 Paintings from the Rijksmuseum is a selection of paintings that were included in a booklet of illustrations in the Rijksmuseum Amsterdam giftshop for visitors during the years 1950\u20131990. It was meant as an illustrated companion guide to the catalog of the paintings on show, which included information about the +/-1,200 paintings on show. The painting River Landscape with Ferry by Salomon van Ruysdael was part of the collection of Jacques Goudstikker and was restituted to his heir in 2006. It is now in the collection of the National Gallery of Art. Various other paintings were on long-term loan from the Amsterdam Museum and have been returned, but the majority are all still in the collection of the Rijksmuseum today. Some of the paintings have been reattributed to other artists since 1956. No works by women artists were included in the selection. ==List of Illustrations== {| class='wikitable sortable' style='width:100%' !Image !Article !Date !Painter !Catalog code |- | 128px || The Holy Kinship || 1495 || Geertgen tot Sint Jans || 950 |- | 128px || The Adoration of the Magi || || Geertgen tot Sint Jans || 950A1 |- | 128px || The Seven Works of Mercy || 1504 || Master of Alkmaar || 1538B1 |- | 128px || The Adoration of the Magi || || Jan Mostaert || 1674 |- | 128px || The Virgin and Child with Four Holy Virgins || 1490s || Master of the Virgo inter Virgines || 1538V1 |- | 128px || The Death of the Virgin || 1500 || Master of the Amsterdam Death of the Virgin || 1538D1 |- | 128px || Triptych with the Virgin and Child and saints (centre panel), the donor with St Martin (inner left wing), the donor\u2019s wife with St Cunera (inner right wing) and the Annunciation (outer wings) || || Master of Delft || 1538L1 |- | 128px || Memorial tablet || 1500 || Master of the Spes Nostra || 1538T1 |- | 128px || The Crucifixion || || Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen || 723 |- | 128px || Salome with the Head of John the Baptist || 1524 || Jacob Cornelisz van Oostsanen || 722A2 |- | 128px || Christ taking leave of his Mother || || Cornelis Engebrechtsz. || 905A1 |- | 128px || The Calling of Saint Anthony || 1530 || Lucas van Leyden || 1452 |- | 128px || The Raising of Lazarus || || Aertgen van Leyden || 1449D1 |- | 128px || Mary Magdalene || 1530 || Jan van Scorel || 2189 |- | 128px || Left wing of a triptych with the donor Matelief Dammasz and St Paul (inner wing), and the Erythraean Sibyl (outer wing) || 1564 || Maarten van Heemskerck || 1127 |- | 128px || Adoration of the Shepherds (fragment) || 1550s || Pieter Aertsen || 6 |- | 128px || Portrait of Sir Thomas Gresham, pendant to portrait of Anne Fernely || || Antonis Mor || 1673B1 |- | 128px || Portrait of Anne Fernely, pendant to Sir Thomas Gresham || || Antonis Mor || 1673B2 |- | 128px || The Company of Captain Dirck Jacobsz Rosecrans and Lieutenant Pauw || 1588 || Cornelis Ketel || 1330 |- | 128px || Three Regentesses and the \u2018House Mother\u2019 of the Amsterdam Lepers\u2019 Asylum || 1624 || Werner van den Valckert || 2351 |- | 128px || Landscape with ruins, cattle and deer || || Roelant Savery || 2138 |- | 128px || Winter Landscape with Skaters || 1608 || Hendrick Avercamp || 392 |- | 128px || The Cattle Ferry || 1622 || Esaias van de Velde || 2452 |- | 128px || Banquet in the open || 1627 || Dirck Hals || 1082 |- | 128px || Merry Company || 1618 || Willem Pieterszoon Buytewech || 668B1 |- | 128px || Marriage Portrait of Isaac Massa and Beatrix van der Laen || 1622 || Frans Hals || 1084 |- | 128px || Portrait of Nicolaes Hasselaer || 1635 || Frans Hals || 1089 |- | 128px || The Merry Drinker || 1627 || Frans Hals || 1091 |- | 128px || Portrait of a man, possibly a clergyman || 1660 || Frans Hals || 1091A1 |- | 128px || Portrait of Maritge Claesdr Vooght || 1639 || Frans Hals || 1088 |- | 128px || Woman at the Virginal || || Jan Miense Molenaer || 1635 |- | 128px || Girl in a Blue Dress || 1641 || Johannes Cornelisz Verspronck || 2536A1 |- | 128px || The Old Town Hall of Amsterdam || 1657 || Pieter Jansz.
