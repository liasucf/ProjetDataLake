Since the JESC, apart from still going to school with an integrated pop/jazz education, she came out with additional singles. \"First Kiss\" won the award for longest noted artist for 26 weeks in the Kids Top 20. She was asked by Jetix/Dolfinarium Harderwijk to write and sing the title song for the popular TV series Spetter (Mijn allerbeste vriend) and following this came the request to sing the Dutch version of the main duet of High School Musical 2, by Disney. This duet, \"De stem van mijn hart\", she did together with Thomas Berge. Tess now performs jazz and pop with Tess and the Rhythm Chiefs in Belgium and the Netherlands. Her first album, Onweerstaanbaar was released on 6 March 2008 in Belgium and the Netherlands. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *2008: Onweerstaanbaar ===Singles=== * 2005: \"Stupid\" * 2006: \"First Kiss\" * 2006: \"Mijn allerbeste vriend\" * 2007: \"De stem van mijn hart\" (featuring Thomas Berge) * 2008: \"Little Pink Thing\" * 2008: \"Change\" ===Concert tours=== *2008: Onweerstaanbaar release concert\u2022 TessMusic.nl \u2022 Offici\u00eble fansite van Tess Gaerth\u00e9 | Change ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:Dutch child actresses Category:Dutch child singers Category:Dutch female singers Category:Junior Eurovision Song Contest participants Category:Musicians from Amsterdam Category:Twin people from the Netherlands Category:21st-century Dutch singers Category:21st-century women singers ",
