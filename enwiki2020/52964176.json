Shooting wrapped up in late August 2016. Other filming locations include Hengdian World Studios, Xiandu Scenic Area in Jinyun County and Xianju County in Zhejiang Province, Huanghe Shilin Scenic Area in Jingtai County and Tianzhu Grasslands in Gansu Province, and Tonghu Grasslands in Inner Mongolia. Although this series is one of many television series adaptations of The Legend of the Condor Heroes, it is the first one to be produced since Louis Cha last revised the novel. In a January 2017 interview, producer Guo Jingyu explained why he produced a television series based on a wuxia novel which already has more than 10 earlier adaptations. He said that he is dissatisfied with many of the wuxia television series produced in recent years, and wanted to remake the 1983 Hong Kong television series The Legend of the Condor Heroes, which he enjoyed watching, for younger generations of viewers. He also explained the challenges he faced in operating with a very tight budget and time constraints, such as having to reduce the use of special effects and having to cast less well-known actors and actresses in the lead roles. == Episodes == The series originally aired in 2 episodes daily on Dragon Television, Monday through Sunday from 19:30 to 21:00. ==Ratings== {| class=\"wikitable sortable mw-collapsible jquery-tablesorter\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! rowspan=\"2\" |Air date ! rowspan=\"2\" |Episode ! colspan=\"2\" |Dragon TV CSM52 City ratings |- !Ratings !Audience share |- |2017.1.9 |1-2 |0.532 |2.896 |- |2017.1.10 |3-4 |0.65 |3.514 |- |2017.1.16 |5-6 |0.653 |3.488 |- |2017.1.17 |7-8 |0.513 |2.680 |- |2017.1.23 |9-10 |0.648 |3.267 |- |2017.1.24 |11-12 |0.675 |3.290 |- |2017.2.6 |13-14 |0.466 |2.253 |- |2017.2.7 |15-16 |0.613 |2.998 |- |2017.2.13 |17-18 |0.502 |2.798 |- |2017.2.14 |19-20 |0.446 |2.517 |- |2017.2.20 |21-22 |0.445 |2.527 |- |2017.2.21 |23-24 |0.554 |3.076 |- |2017.2.27 |25-26 |0.549 |3.312 |- |2017.2.28 |27-28 |0.424 |2.489 |} ==International broadcast== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
