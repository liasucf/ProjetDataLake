He has made several published contributions to the field of Egyptology, including a dating of the Dendera zodiac, whose age was the center of a significant archaeological debate in the 1800s. It is also likely he is the author of MacScribe, a hieroglyph typesetting software for Macintosh, since it originated from the same department he collaborated with on the Dendera dating, and is attributed to someone with his name. ==Egyptology Publications== * * * ==References== Category:French physicists Category:French Egyptologists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
