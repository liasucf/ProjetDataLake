    "text": "Oxyphosphides are chemical compounds formally containing the group PO, with one phosphorus and one oxygen atom. The phosphorus and oxygen are not bound together as in phosphates or phosphine oxides, instead they are bound separately to the cations (metals), and could be considered as a mixed phosphide-oxide compound. So a compound with OmPn requires cations to balance a negative charge of 2m+3n. The cations will have charges of +2 or +3. The trications are often rare earth elements or actinides. They are in the category of oxy-pnictide compounds. Many compounds are layered, containing two metals with the formula XZPO, with an XP layer alternating with a ZO layer. ==Examples== Examples include *Uranium\u2013Copper Oxyphosphide UCuPO semimetallic antiferromagnetic tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type a =3:7958 c=8:2456 V=118.80 Z=2 MW=348.55 density=9.743 *Thorium\u2013Copper Oxyphosphide ThCuPO semimetallic tetragonal ZrCuSiAs-type a=3.8995 c=8.2939 V=126.12 Z=2 MW=342.56 density=9.02. *NpCuOP *Sr2ScCoPO3 high thermoelectric effect has layers of CoP alternating with Sr2ScO3. *Sr2ScFePO3 superconducting 17K. *LaNiOP Lanthanum nickel oxyphosphide *YOFeP *YOMnP *YOCdP *ROTPn (R = La, Nd, Sm, Gd; T = Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu; Pn = P, As, Sb) *YZnPO transparent red R'm Z=6 a = 3.946, c = 30.71 *LaZnPO transparent red ZrCuSiAs type *DyZnPO transparent red R'm Z=6 a=3.8933 c=30.305 *PrZnPO transparent red dimorphic *SmZnPO transparent red R'm Z=6 a = 3.946, c = 30.71 *NdZnPO transparent a = 3.885 c = 30.32 *GdZnPO transparent red R'm Z=6 a=3.922, c = 30.56 *CeZnPO transparent *HoZnPO transparent dark red *CeRuPO ferromagnetic below 15K. dimorphic *CeOsPO antiferromagnetic ==related phosphide oxides== *La2AuP2O C2/m, a=15.373 b=4.274 c=10.092 \u03b2=131.02 V=500.3 dark-red-violet *Ce2AuP2O C2/m, a = 15.152, b = 4.2463, c = 9.992 pm, \u03b2 = 130.90\u00b0 dark-red-violet *Pr2AuP2O C2/m, a = 15.036, b = 4.228, c = 9.930 pm, \u03b2 = 130.88(2)\u00b0 dark-red-violet *Nd2AuP2O C2/m, a = 15.0187, b = 4.2085, c = 9.903 pm, \u03b2 = 131.12(1)\u00b0 dark-red-violet ==Oxy-pnictides== Related compounds are the oxybismuthides and oxyarsenides. ==References== Category:Phosphides Category:Oxides ",
