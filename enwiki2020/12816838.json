He was active in quadratura, but also painted capricci and canvases with landscapes. He was a rival of Leonardo Coccorante. His father, Giuseppe Capelli, was a scenic designer at the Teatro San Bartolomeo in Naples. His brother, Giuseppe Cappelli (or Capelli) was a painter in Rome of scenographic decoration (theatrical decorations).Boni, F. Grossi states that he was so full of imagination, and fast at painting, that he did not even sketch beforehand for his works.Era egli tan feroce di fantasia, e tanto veloce nel pingere, che dell'opere sue neppure faceva lo schizzo.
