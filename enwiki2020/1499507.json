    "text": "The River Deel () is in County Cork and County Limerick, Ireland.Ordnance Survey of Ireland: Rivers and their Catchment Basins 1958 (Table of Reference) The river rises near Dromina in north County Cork and flows north into County Limerick for over 60 km to enter the Shannon Estuary. After it rises it passes the flowing areas, first Milford and down towards Belville bridge, then on to Castlemahon (Mahoonagh) and nearby Newcastle West, running parallel to the main Limerick-Killarney N21 road, to reach Rathkeale. After leaving Rathkeale, the river crosses the N21 and flows north to Askeaton. It then crosses the N69 before entering the Shannon Estuary a further 4km north. ==Name== The Deel derives its name from daol, an Irish word for a beetle, insect or worm, because of its winding, bending shape. ==Fishing== The Deel was once a good salmon and grilse fishery but now is mainly fished for brown trout. ==References== ==External links== * Deel River Guide Category:Rivers of County Limerick Category:Tributaries of the River Shannon ",
