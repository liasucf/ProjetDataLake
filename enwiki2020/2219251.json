    "text": "Louise Hippolyte (10 November 1697 \u2013 29 December 1731) was one of only two women to reign over the Principality of Monaco. ==Biography== Born at the Prince's Palace in Monaco, she was the second daughter of Antonio I of Monaco and Marie de Lorraine-Armagnac. The second of six children born to her parents, she was the first of their children to survive infancy. She had an elder sister, Caterina Charlotte (1691-1696) and four younger sisters, Elisabetta Charlotte (1698-1702), Margherita Camilla (1700\u20131758), Maria Devota (1702-1703) and Maria Paolina Theresa Devota Grimaldi (1708\u20131726). Because she had no brothers, Louise Hippolyte became the heiress to the throne of Monaco. Her father decided, with the permission of Louis XIV, that her future husband should assume the surname of Grimaldi and rule Monaco jointly with her. On 20 October 1715, at the age of eighteen, she married Jacques Fran\u00e7ois Goyon, Count de Matignon, after his family had proposed him as a candidate. His candidacy was supported by King Louis XIV, who wanted to consolidate French influence in Monaco. Prior to this, Louise Hippolyte's father was eager to wed his daughter to a Grimaldi cousin. This marriage did not materialise due to the poor finances of the Grimaldis at the time. Louise Hippolyte and Jacques had nine children. Her husband preferred to stay in Versailles instead of Monaco, where he had several mistresses. After the death of her father, Louise Hippolyte traveled from Paris to Monaco on 4 April 1731 and received an enthusiastic reception from the populace. When Jacques joined her a little while later, the reception was much colder. At the end of 1731, Louise Hippolyte died of smallpox. Her husband neglected the affairs of Monaco and had to leave the country in May 1732. He abdicated in favor of their son, Honor\u00e9, the next year. Her husband remained a widower, despite a rich dowry offered to him by the Duchess of Maine for the hand of her unattractive daughter, Mademoiselle du Maine, a granddaughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. ==Issue== * Antoine Charles Marie (16 December 1717 \u2013 4 February 1718), Marquis des Baux and Count de Matignon. * Charlotte Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nathalie (19 March 1719 \u2013 1790), nun at the Convent of Visitation at Paris. * Honor\u00e9 III Camille L\u00e9onor (10 November 1720 \u2013 21 March 1795), successor of his parents. * Charles Marie Auguste (1 January 1722 \u2013 24 August 1749), Count de Carlad\u00e9s and de Matignon. * Jacques (9 June 1723 \u2013 June 1723). * Louise Fran\u00e7oise (15 July 1724 \u2013 15 September 1729), Mademoiselle des Baux. * Fran\u00e7ois Charles (4 February 1726 \u2013 9 December 1743), Count of Thorigny. * Charles Maurice (14 May 1727 \u2013 18 January 1798), Count de Valentinois; married on 10 November 1749 to Marie Christine Chr\u00e9tienne de Rouvrois; no issue. * Marie Fran\u00e7oise Th\u00e9r\u00e9se (20 July 1728 \u2013 20 June 1743), Mademoiselle d'Estouteville. ==Ancestors== Category:Princes of Monaco Category:Hereditary Princesses of Monaco Category:House of Grimaldi Category:Monegasque princesses Category:Burials at the Cathedral of Our Lady Immaculate, Monaco Category:17th-century French people Category:18th-century French people Category:1697 births Category:1731 deaths Category:Deaths from smallpox ",
