    "text": "Erdo\u011fanism refers to the political ideals and agenda of Turkish President and former Prime Minister, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, who became Prime Minister in 2003 and served until his election to the Presidency in 2014. With support significantly derived from charismatic authority, Erdo\u011fanism has been described as the \"strongest phenomenon in Turkey since Kemalism\" and used to enjoy broad support throughout the country until the 2018 Turkish economic crisis which caused a significant decline in Erdo\u011fan's popularity. Its ideological roots originate from Turkish conservatism and its most predominant political adherent is the governing Justice and Development Party (AKP), a party that Erdo\u011fan himself founded in 2001. ==Overview== As a personified version of conservative democracy, key ideals of Erdo\u011fanism include a religious inspired strong centralised leadership based primarily on electoral consent and less so on the separation of powers and institutional checks and balances. Critics have often referred to Erdo\u011fan's political outlook as authoritarian and as an elective dictatorship. The election-centric outlook of Erdo\u011fanism has often been described as an illiberal democracy by foreign leaders, such as Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n. Erdo\u011fanism is also strongly influenced by the desire to establish a 'New Turkey', departing from the founding Kemalist principles of the Turkish Republic and abolishing key enshrined constitutional ideals that are at odds with Erdo\u011fan's vision, such as secularism. Supporters of Erdo\u011fanism often call for a revival of cultural and traditional values from the Ottoman Empire and are critical of the pro- western social reforms and modernisation initiated by the founder of the Turkish Republic, Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk. Grassroots support for Erdo\u011fanism mainly originates from the development of a cult of personality around Erdo\u011fan, as well as the predominance of charismatic authority. The role of Erdo\u011fan personified as an individual agent of Turkish conservative values has manifested itself in the form of prominent campaign slogans for the Turkish Presidential election such as \"Man of the nation\", translated in Turkish as \"Milletin Adam\u0131\". ==History== Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, whose ideals and political agenda have come to be referred to as 'Erdo\u011fanism' The term 'Erdo\u011fanism' first emerged shortly after Erdo\u011fan's 2011 general election victory, where it was predominantly described as the AKP's liberal economic and conservative democratic ideals fused with Erdo\u011fan demagoguery and cult of personality. The usage of the term increased in conjunction with a greater recognition of Erdo\u011fan on the global stage, mostly due to his proactive foreign policy ideals based on Neo-Ottomanism, a core factor that Erdo\u011fanism encompasses. ==Core values== The American news publication Foreign Policy has described Erdo\u011fanism as an ideology fundamentally based on a cult of personality forming around Erdo\u011fan, referring to it as a form of populist authoritarianism similar to that of Putinism in Russia. Foreign Policy also describes Ottomanism (the glorification of the Ottoman Empire), Islamism, suspicion of western political intervention in the Middle East, the rejection of Kemalism, and confinement of the democratic process and elections as key attributes of Erdo\u011fanism. ===Conflict with Islamism=== Though elements of Erdo\u011fanism, particularly the political rhetoric used by its supporters, have been inspired from Islamism, the extensive cult of personality surrounding Erdo\u011fan has been argued to have isolated hardline Islamists who are sceptical of his dominance in state policy. The central and overarching authority of Erdo\u011fan, a central theme of Erdo\u011fanism, has been criticised by Islamists who believe that devotion of followers should not be towards a leader, but rather to Allah and the teachings of Islam. As such, the overarching dominance of Erdo\u011fan has furthered Islamist criticism, particularly by Islamist parties such as the Felicity Party (SP), who have claimed that Erdo\u011fanism is not based on Islamism but is instead based on authoritarianism using religious rhetoric to maintain public support amongst conservative supporters. ==See also== *Conservative democracy *Conservatism in Turkey *Turkish currency and debt crisis, 2018 ==References== Category:Conservatism in Turkey Category:Islamic democracy Category:Islamism in Turkey Category:Eponymous political ideologies Category:Politics of Turkey Category:Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan ",
