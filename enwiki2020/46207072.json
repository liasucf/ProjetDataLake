    "text": "Tyler Pasher (born 27 April 1994) is a Canadian professional soccer player who plays as a forward for USL Championship club Indy Eleven. ==Club== ===Youth=== Pasher became a member of the Woolwich Soccer Association, of which his father Jeff was president, at age 6. He had previously trained with Newcastle United on multiple occasions. The first time he travelled to Newcastle as a schoolboy, he stepped right into training with the academy, something that no other Canadian had ever done. Pasher originally made contact with Newcastle through a local coach and his son, David Edgar, a fellow Canadian who was also at Newcastle. Between the ages of 9 and 16, Pasher trained with the club during his two-week school break each March and for two months each summer. He played for the academy between the ages of 9 and 13 before being part of the first team reserves between age 14 and 16. While with the reserves, Pasher trained with players such as Sammy Ameobi, Andy Carroll, and Shane Ferguson. A combination of UK work permit difficulties, injury, and wishing to return home to Canada prompted Pasher to leave the club, at which time he joined the TFC Academy in the Canadian Soccer League. In July 2012, Pasher received high praise as he came in as a 28th-minute substitute for the senior side of Toronto FC in a friendly match against Liverpool in Toronto. Pasher was given the captain's armband for the match by head coach Paul Mariner, with the manager stating, \"He\u2019s got some passion in his body. I thought he was terrific playing against Joe Cole and the other lad, who are tremendously talented players. He\u2019s only a young boy but that\u2019s why I gave him the armband in the second half. I thought he deserved it.\" Pasher was then described as the most MLS-ready player in the academy. ===PS Kemi Kings=== Pasher left Toronto FC and signed a 1+2 contract with PS Kemi Kings in the Kakkonen, the third tier of Finnish football, on 5 April 2013. Pasher played one season for the club, appearing in 24 matches and scoring 11 goals. He also made one appearance for the club in the 2013 Finnish Cup, a 0\u20132 defeat to VPS on 24 April 2013. With a record of 19 wins, 4 draws, and 4 losses, PS Kemi was crowned champion of the Kakkonen Pohjoinen (Northern) Division and advanced to the promotion playoff series before losing 0\u20132 on aggregate to HIFK. ===Lansing United=== After leaving PS Kemi, Pasher trained with Lansing United of the National Premier Soccer League for most of the season but was able to appear in only a limited number of matches because of contractual complications with his former club. Pasher was home for the summer and decided to join the club, of which a good friend was assistant coach, to stay fit while waiting to be signed by a professional club. At that time, it was believed that Pasher would return to Toronto FC after impressing head coach Ryan Nelsen. About the way in which Pasher ended up with the club, Lansing head coach Eric Rudland described it as, \"[He] fell into our lap through a comedy of errors.\" In total, Pasher made ten appearances during his time with the club, tallying three goals and six assists while also battling injuries after deciding to stay with the club for the season. Following the season, Pasher was named to the NPSL's Supporters' XI team after helping Lansing earn the NPSL Great Lakes West conference title in the club's inaugural season. Following his time with Lansing, Pasher was invited to the first-ever National Premier Soccer League combine to showcase his talents to MLS, USL, and NASL scouts. He then trialed with his former club Toronto FC of MLS, Minnesota United of the NASL, and Arizona United of the USL. ===Pittsburgh Riverhounds=== Pasher eventually signed with the Pittsburgh Riverhounds of the United Soccer League, the third tier of the United States soccer league system, in January 2015 after trialing with the club during preseason. Pasher was set to miss the Riverhounds' first match of the 2015 season against the Harrisburg City Islanders after being called up to the Canadian senior squad for two friendly matches. It was announced that Pasher would be available for selection for the Riverhounds' second match of the season the following weekend against the Rochester Rhinos. However, prior to that match, it was revealed that Pasher was still unavailable because Pittsburgh was still awaiting his international transfer clearance from his former club in Finland. On 8 April 2015 it was announced that Pasher had received his international transfer clearance and would be available for the Riverhounds' third match of the season, an away fixture against Saint Louis FC on 11 April. Pasher made his Riverhounds debut as a starter in the match, an eventual 1\u20131 draw. He went on to score his first goal for the Riverhounds in an exhibition match against the Saint Francis University Red Flash on 15 April 2015. Six minutes into the match, Pasher coolly stroked his shot inside the far corner to give the Hounds the lead. The goal went on to be the game-winner as the Riverhounds won 3\u20130. Ten days later Pasher scored his first league goal for the Riverhounds, the final goal of a 5\u20131 victory over Toronto FC II, the reserve squad of his former club Toronto FC. Pasher finished the season with 21 league appearances for the Riverhounds while scoring two goals. ===Swope Park Rangers=== Pasher signed with USL side Swope Park Rangers on 2 March 2016. He scored his first two goals on 14 May against Tulsa Roughnecks FC. In August 2016, Sporting Kansas City announced that they had signed Pasher on a short-term loan, to play in the 2016\u201317 CONCACAF Champions League against Central FC. He made his CCL debut in a 1\u20132 defeat to the Vancouver Whitecaps on 13 September 2016. He was called up to Sporting's squad again for the tournament in October 2016 for the return fixture against Central FC. ===Sporting Kansas City=== After a successful 2016 season, Pasher was signed to a first-team contract with Sporting Kansas City.http://www.sportingkc.com/post/2016/12/02/sporting-kc-signs-midfielder- tyler-pasher-and-goalkeeper-adrian-zendejas-mls Upon conclusion of the 2017 season, Sporting KC announced they would not exercise Pasher's option for the 2018 season, ending his time at the club. ===Atlanta United=== On 10 December 2017 Pasher was traded by Kansas City, along with midfielder K\u00e9vin Oliveira and a second-round selection in the 2018 MLS SuperDraft, to Atlanta United FC in exchange for goalkeeper Alexander Tambakis, the MLS rights to forward Kenwyne Jones, and a fourth-round selection in the 2021 MLS SuperDraft. ===Indy Eleven=== On 7 February 2018, Pasher joined the Indy Eleven of the United Soccer League. ==International== In 2005, Pasher was one of the final 140 players narrowed down to represent Canada at the Under-12 level in the Danone Nations Cup in France. However, he was not selected for the final squad. At that time, Tyler was invited back in April 2006 for tryouts for the next edition of the tournament. Pasher received his first national team call up at any level for a pair of U17 friendlies against Mexico in Morelia in April 2011 in preparation for the upcoming U17 World Cup. He came on as a 69th-minute substitute in the second match, a 0\u20133 defeat. He was then was named to Canada's final U17 squad for the 2011 FIFA U-17 World Cup in Mexico but withdrew due to a sustained concussion. In July 2012 he was named to Canada's U20 squad for a training camp and two friendlies in Mexico. In 2013, he was then included in Canada's U20 squad for the 2013 Francophone Games in Nice. He went on to appear in two of Canada's three matches in the tournament. In May 2014, head coach Benito Floro called up Pasher to the senior squad for the first time for a training camp and friendlies against Moldova and Bulgaria in Austria but he once again withdrew because of injury. He was called up to the senior squad again, this time as an injury replacement for Sam Adekugbe and Andr\u00e9 Hainault, in March 2015 for friendlies against Puerto Rico and Guatemala as part of Canada's preparation for the 2015 CONCACAF Gold Cup and 2018 World Cup qualification. Pasher neither appeared in the match nor was he on the bench as part of the gameday squad against Guatemala. He once again did not see action in the match against Puerto Rico. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|CupIncludes the Finnish Cup and U.S. Open Cup !colspan=2|ContinentalAppearance in the CONCACAF Champions League !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |PS Kemi |2013 |Kakkonen |22||11||1||0||colspan=2|\u2013||2||0||25||11 |- |Lansing United |2014 |NPSL |10||3||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||0||0||10||3 |- |Pittsburgh Riverhounds |2015 |USL |21||2||2||0||colspan=2|\u2013||0||0||23||2 |- |Swope Park Rangers |2016 |USL |24||5||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||4||0||28||5 |- |Sporting Kansas City (loan) |2016 |rowspan=2|MLS |0||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0 |- |rowspan=2|Sporting Kansas City |2017 |1||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !1!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!2!!0 |- |Swope Park Rangers (loan) |2017 |USL |24||0||colspan=2|\u2013||colspan=2|\u2013||3||0||27||0 |- |rowspan=4|Indy Eleven |2018 |USL |10||1||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||0||0||10||1 |- |2019 |rowspan=\"2\"|USL Championship |32||11||2||0||colspan=2|\u2013||3||2||37||13 |- |2020 |15||10||0||0||colspan=2|\u2013||0||0||15||10 |- !colspan=2|Total !57!!22!!2!!0!!0!!0!!3!!2!!62!!24 |- !colspan=3|Career total !159!!43!!5!!0!!1!!0!!12!!2!!177!!45 |} ==Honours== ===Individual=== *NPSL Supporters' XI team: 2014 ===Club=== ;PS Kemi *Kakkonen Pohjoinen Champion: 2013 ;Lansing United *NPSL Great Lakes West Conference Champion: 2014 ==References== ==External links== *Canada Soccer profile * * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football midfielders Category:Canada men's youth international soccer players Category:Canadian Soccer League (2006\u2013present) players Category:Canadian soccer players Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States Category:Indy Eleven players Category:Major League Soccer players Category:National Premier Soccer League players Category:People from Woolwich, Ontario Category:Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC players Category:Soccer people from Ontario Category:Sporting Kansas City players Category:Sporting Kansas City II players Category:TFC Academy players Category:USL Championship players Category:Ykk\u00f6nen players ",
