His collections include A Walk Through the Yellow Pages, The Half-Inch Himalayas, A Nostalgist's Map of America, The Country Without a Post Office, Rooms Are Never Finished, the latter a finalist for the National Book Award in 2001. The University of Utah Press awards the Agha Shahid Ali Poetry Prize annually \"in memory of a celebrated poet and beloved teacher.\" ==Early life and education== Agha Shahid Ali was born in the illustrious and highly educated Agha family of Srinagar, Kashmir. He was raised in Kashmir but left for the United States in 1976. Shahid's father Agha Ashraf Ali was a renowned educationist of Jammu and Kashmir. Shahid's grandmother Begum Zaffar Ali, an educationist, was the first woman matriculate of Kashmir. Shahid was educated at the Burn Hall School, later University of Kashmir and the Hindu College, University of Delhi. He earned a PhD in English from Pennsylvania State University in 1984, and an M.F.A. from the University of Arizona in 1985. He held teaching positions at nine universities and colleges in India and the United States. Shahid's upbringing was absolutely secular. He loved the painting of St Veronica's Handkerchief, that Zakir Hussain had gifted to his father, Agha Ashraf Ali. In fact, the first poem that he had written was at the age of 12 about Christ. Shahid, and his brother Iqbal, both studied at an Irish Catholic school and in an interview, he recalled that: \"There was never a hint of any kind of parochialism in the home.\" ==Literary work== Ali expressed his love and concern for his people in In Memory of Begum Akhtar and The Country Without a Post Office, which was written with the Kashmir conflict as backdrop. He was a translator of the Urdu poet Faiz Ahmed Faiz (The Rebel's Silhouette; Selected Poems),Book Excerptise:Rebel's Silhouette (extended extracts and literary history) and the editor for the Middle East and Central Asia segment of Jeffery Paine's Poetry of Our World.Poetry of Our World (excerpts) He further compiled the volume Ravishing DisUnities: Real Ghazals in English. His last book was Call Me Ishmael Tonight, a collection of English ghazals, and his poems are featured in American Alphabets: 25 Contemporary Poets (2006) and other anthologies. Ali taught at the MFA Program for Poets & Writers at University of Massachusetts Amherst, at the MFA Writing Seminars at Bennington College as well as at creative writing programs at University of Utah, Baruch College, Warren Wilson College, Hamilton College and New York University. He died of brain cancer in December 2001 and was buried in Northampton, in the vicinity of Amherst, a town sacred to his beloved poet Emily Dickinson. == Bibliography == This list represents the published output of Ali, arranged in chronological order and sorted by the manner in which he contributed to the work in question. === Poetry === * Bone Sculpture (1972), * In Memory of Begum Akhtar and Other Poems (1979), * The Half-Inch Himalayas (1987), * A Walk Through the Yellow Pages (1987), * A Nostalgist's Map of America (1991), * The Beloved Witness: Selected Poems (1992), * The Country Without a Post Office (1997), * Rooms Are Never Finished (2001), * Call Me Ishmael Tonight: A Book of Ghazals (2003). === Translations and edited volumes === * Translator, The Rebel's Silhouette: Selected Poems by Faiz Ahmed Faiz (1992), * Editor, Ravishing Disunities: Real Ghazals in English (2000). ==Influences== Ali was deeply moved by the music of Begum Akhtar. Several niches in his apartment had photos of the people who had deeply influenced his work - Akhtar's photo occupied one of these spaces. The two had met through a friend of Akhtar's when Ali was a teenager and her music became a lasting presence in his life. Features of her ghazal rendition\u2014such as wit, wordplay and nakhra (affectation)\u2014were present in Ali's poetry as well. However, Amitav Ghosh suspects that the strongest connection between the two rose from the idea that \"sorrow has no finer mask than a studied lightness of manner\"\u2014traces of which were seen in Ali's and Akhtar's demeanor in their respective lives. == Awards == * Pushcart Prize * Guggenheim Fellowship in 1996 *Bread Loaf Writers' Conference Fellowship *Ingram-Merrill Foundation Fellowship *New York Foundation for the Arts Fellowship ==Notes== ==References== ==Further reading== *'I Write on that Void: Kashmir, Kaschmir, Cashmere, Qashmir' \u2013 Remembering Agha Shahid Ali The Wire *Looking for Shahid The Hindu *Eric Pace (26 December 2001) Agha Shahid Ali, 52, a Poet Who Had Roots in Kashmir The New York Times *Brief biography at the University of Massachusetts *How the legendary Begum Akhtar influenced the life and poetry of Agha Shahid Ali * * ==External links== * Agha Shahid Ali at Poets.org * Agha Shahid Ali at the Poetry Foundation * Agha Shahid Ali prize, University of Utah Press * Amitav Ghosh on Agha Shahid Ali, Urdustudies.com * 'I swear...I have my hopes: Agha Shahid Ali's Delhi Years', Kafila.org * 'The Veilied Suite: The Collected Poems by Agha Shahid Ali' biblio-india.org, March\u2013April 2010.
