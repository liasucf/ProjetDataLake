Director Jean-Pierre Jeunet chanced upon the accordion- and piano-driven music of Yann Tiersen while driving with his production assistant who put on a CD he had not heard before. Greatly impressed, he immediately bought Tiersen's entire catalogue and eventually commissioned him to compose pieces for the film. The soundtrack features both compositions from Tiersen's first three albums, as well as new items, variants of which can be found on his fourth album, L'Absente, which he was writing at the same time. Besides the accordion and piano, the music features parts played with harpsichord, banjo, bass guitar, vibraphone, and even a bicycle wheel at the end of \"La Dispute\" (which plays over the opening titles in the motion picture). Before discovering Tiersen, Jeunet wanted composer Michael Nyman to score the film.https://soundtrackbeat.com/2017/04/10/amelie_soundtrack_review/ \"Les Jours tristes\" was co-written with Neil Hannon of The Divine Comedy. The track later received English lyrics, and was released by The Divine Comedy as a b-side to the Regeneration single \"Perfect Lovesong.\" The English-language version also appeared on Tiersen's L'Absente. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Musicians * Yann Tiersen \u2013 piano, toy piano, carillon, banjo, mandolin, guitar, harpsichord, vibraphone, accordion, bass, melodica * Ensemble Orchestral Synaxis \u2013 orchestra on \"Les Jours tristes\" and \"\u00c0 quai\" * Christine Ott \u2013 ondes Martenot on \"\u00c0 quai\" * Christian Quermalet \u2013 drums on \"Les Jours tristes\" ;Production * Uwe Teichert \u2013 mastering * Fabrice Laureau \u2013 mixing * Marc Bruckert \u2013 artwork * Laurent Lufroy \u2013 film poster ==Awards and nominations== The list is made with information from IMDb. ===Awards=== * 2001 \u2014 World Soundtrack Award for Best Original Score of the Year * 2002 \u2014 C\u00e9sar Award for Best Music Written for a Film ===Nominations=== * 2001 \u2014 BAFTA Award for Best Film Music * 2001 \u2014 World Soundtrack Award for Soundtrack Composer of the Year * 2001 \u2014 Phoenix Film Critics Society Award for Best Original Soundtrack of the Year ==Charts== ;Soundtrack album {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !Charts (2001) !Peak position |- |Austrian Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|35 |- |Belgian Albums Chart (Vl) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |Belgian Albums Chart (Wa) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |Dutch Albums Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|31 |- |French Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |Swiss Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|28 |- |US Billboard Top World Music Albums | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |} \"Comptine d'un autre \u00e9t\u00e9 : L'apr\u00e8s-midi\" {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
