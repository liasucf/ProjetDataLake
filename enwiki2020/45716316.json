The Embassy is located on Lauf\u00e1svegur street in the Mi\u00f0borg district of the city. Since the 1990s, the building has been shared with the German Embassy. The current British Ambassador to Iceland is Michael Nevin. ==History== H\u00f6f\u00f0i, the former home of the British Embassy Britain's first representative to Iceland, Charles Smith, was appointed on 8 May 1940 during the Second World War. He arrived accompanying the British troops who occupied Iceland. Until then, Iceland had been a dependency of Denmark. The home of the first British Embassy was H\u00f6f\u00f0i (best known as the location for the 1986 Reykjav\u00edk Summit meeting of Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev). In the 1950s the Embassy was moved to its current location on Lauf\u00e1svegur street. In 1968, the British Government bought Lauf\u00e1svegur 31 and the old farmhouse which was there was donated to the Reykjavik Museum and moved to the heritage site at \u00c1rb\u00e6jarsafn. When the Embassy was redeveloped in the 1990s, it was decided that the location was too large for Britain's needs and so it looked for another partner to share it with. At the same time the German government was also looking for a new location and so agreed to share building and facilities at Lauf\u00e1svegur 31. It is thought to be the first time a building was constructed to house two embassies. It was opened on 2 June 1996, in the presence of Malcolm Rifkind, Werner Hoyer, and Halld\u00f3r \u00c1sgr\u00edmsson. A plaque inside reads \"the first purpose built co-located British- German chancery building in Europe\". ==See also== *Iceland\u2013United Kingdom relations *List of diplomatic missions in Iceland *List of Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Iceland ==References== Reykjavik United Kingdom Category:Buildings and structures in Reykjav\u00edk Category:Iceland\u2013United Kingdom relations Category:Germany\u2013United Kingdom relations ",
