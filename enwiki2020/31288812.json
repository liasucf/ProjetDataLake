    "text": "J. Edward Pawlick (27 April 1927, in New York City \u2013 7 October 2007, in Weston, Massachusetts) was a Massachusetts lawyer, publisher and anti-gay activist. In 1972 Pawlick started Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly which he sold to his daughter, Susan P. Hall, in the 1990s. She developed the paper into a chain of 14 papers, including Lawyers Weekly USA, which has national distribution. The papers were sold to Dolan Media in 2004 for an undisclosed sum, estimated to be over $10 million. In 1998 Pawlick launched the conservative Massachusetts News, first as a website and then also as a hardcopy newspaper. He used the newspaper to express his right-wing philosophy. For several years, it was distributed free of charge monthly to a targeted audience in Massachusetts and surrounding areas. It gained popularity amongst conservatives for its expos\u00e9s on state corruption, the perceived inequities of the state probate court, as well as anti-abortion and anti-gay causes. At the same time, Pawlick was producing and distributing pamphlets promoting his philosophy, with particular emphasis on his opposition to gay and lesbian rights. ==Bibliography== *1968: How to Avoid Being Overcharged by Your Life Insurance Salesman *1998: Freedom Will Conquer Racism and Sexism *2003: Libel by New York Times ==References== ==External links== *Massachusetts Lawyers Weekly Category:American newspaper publishers (people) Category:Massachusetts lawyers Category:1927 births Category:2007 deaths Category:American activists Category:Journalists from New York City ",
