    "text": "Artinite is a hydrated magnesium carbonate mineral with formula: Mg2(CO3)(OH)2\u00b73H2O. It forms white silky monoclinic prismatic crystals that are often in radial arrays or encrustations. It has a Mohs hardness of 2.5 and a specific gravity of 2. It occurs in low-temperature hydrothermal veins and in serpentinized ultramafic rocks. Associated minerals include brucite, hydromagnesite, pyroaurite, chrysotile, aragonite, calcite, dolomite and magnesite. It was first reported in 1902 in Lombardy, Italy. It was named for Italian mineralogist, Ettore Artini (1866\u20131928). Artinite sometimes forms balls of radiating, fibrous crystals. Specimen from New Idria district, California US.
