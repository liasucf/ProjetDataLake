    "text": "Early peoples and kingdoms of Ireland, c.800 U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhne (also known as Hy Fiachrach) was a kingdom located in what is now the south of County Galway. ==Legendary origins and geography== Originally known as Aidhne, it was said to have been settled by the mythical Fir Bolg. Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh's Leabhar na nGenealach states that the Tuath mhac nUmhoir were led by leader Conall Caol, son of Aonghus mac \u00damh\u00f3r. Connall was killed at the Battle of Maigh Mucruimhe in 195, and his body brought back to Aidhne where it was interred at a leacht called Carn Connell (itself the site of a major battle some centuries later). Located in the south of what is now County Galway, Aidhne was coextensive with the present diocese of Kilmacduagh. It was bounded on the west by Loch Lurgain (Galway Bay) and the district of Burren in County Clare. County Clare also bounds Aidhne on its south and south-east side. Aidhne is bounded on the east by the low mountains of Slieve Aughty, which separated U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhne from U\u00ed Maine. On the north-east Aidhne is bounded by the plains of U\u00ed Mhaine and on the north by Maigh Mucruimhe (the area around Athenry). On the north-west it was bounded by the parish of Maree which was in the territory of U\u00ed Bhri\u00fain Seola. The diocese of Kilmacduagh contains the civil parishes of Kinvarradoorus, Killinny, Killeenavarra, Drumacoo, Kilcolgan, Ardrahan, Stradbally, Killeeneen, Killeely, Killora, Killogilleen, Kilchreest, Isertkelly, Killinan, Kilthomas, Kilbeacanty, Beagh, Kilmacduagh, Kiltartan. The diocese of Kilmacduagh contains the present Catholic parishes of Kinvara, Ballinderreen, Gort, Ardrahan, Craughwell, Beagh, Kilbeacanty, Kilthomas (Peterswell), Clarinbridge, Kilchreest. ==Early history== In the early historical era, the Aidhne branch of the Ui Fiachrach dynasty emerged as the ruling tuath in this part of Connacht. Alternative designations for the territory were Maigh Aidhne (the plain of Aidhne), Maigh nAidhne, eventually becoming U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhne after the dynasty. The diocese of Cill Mhic Dhuach Kilmacduagh is coextensive with the kingdom, covering all of the barony of Kiltartan and large parts of the baronies of Loughrea and Dunkellin. By the 8th century the power of its kings were greatly curtailed, and became minor vassals of the Kings of Connacht. The Anglo- Norman's brought them under the rule of the Clanricarde Burkes. ==Principal septs== The important septs of the U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhne were \u00d3 hEidhin, \u00d3 Seachnasaigh, \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh and Mac Giolla Cheallaigh. ===\u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh=== The O Clearys were kings of the territory before the O Hynes clan but were exiled from the territory probably in the years following the Anglo-Norman invasion of Connacht. Under the patronage of the O Donnells of Ulster the O Clearys went on to become one of the most famous learned families in Europe. * Tighearnach Ua Cleirigh, King of Ui Fiachrach Aidhne, died 916 * M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 Cl\u00e9irigh (ca. 1590\u20131643), chief author of the Annals of the Four Masters. See also Cl\u00e9irche\u00e1n of Saintclerans ===\u00d3 Cathail=== This family were forcibly expelled as a result of dynastic conflicts. Thereafter the \u00d3 Cathail family remained a minor sept without any political power. * Cathal mac \u00d3g\u00e1n, ancestor of the \u00d3 Cathail family, fl. 10th-century. * Gilla Mo Choinni Ua Cathail, king of Ui Fiachrach Aidhne, died 1147 ===\u00d3 Seachnasaigh=== Up until the late 17th century the O Shaughnessys held the sub district of U\u00ed Fhiachrach Aidhne known as Cen\u00e9l \u00c1eda na hEchtge, which was also their clan name. Cen\u00e9l \u00c1eda na hEchtge consisted roughly of the civil parishes of Beagh, Kilmacduagh and Kiltartan and also parts of the civil parishes of Kibeacanty and Kilthomas. In the 1690s the O Shaughnessys had their lands confiscated for supporting the Jacobite cause against William of Orange. A legal battle raged on into the first half of the 18th century between the O Shaughnessys and the Prendergasts, the family who were granted the O Shaughnessy lands, with the O Shaughnessys eventually losing the case. The senior line of the O Shaughnessys appears have died out in the 1780s. * Seachnasach mac Donnchadh, namesake O'Shaughnessy, fl. 10th century. * Sir Roger O'Shaughnessy, Knight and Chief of the Name, fl. 1567. * Roger O'Shaughnessy, The \u00d3 Seachnasaigh (died 1690), knight and jacobite * William O'Shaughnessy, The \u00d3 Seachnasaigh, Major- General, 1673\u20131744. * Arthur William Edgar O'Shaughnessy (1844\u20131881), poet. ===\u00d3 hEidhin=== This family were driven to the coast of Galway Bay and their principal home became Dunguaire Castle.
