    "text": "A neocorate was a rank or dignity granted by the Roman Senate and the Emperor under the Empire to certain cities which had built temples to the Emperor or had established cults of members of the Imperial family. The city itself was referred to as neokoros (pl. neokoroi). A temple dedicated to the emperor was also called neocorate.Christopher Howgego, Volker Heuchert, Andrew Burnett, eds., Coinage and Identity in the Roman Provinces, passim Starting in the 2nd century CE, the title appeared on many coins.Howgego, p. 127 The term was first used as a title for a city for Ephesus and its Temple of the Sebastoi.Steven J. Friesen, Imperial Cults and the Apocalypse of John, 2001, p. 43-55 There were approximately 37 cities holding the neocorate, concentrated in the province of Asia, but also in neighboring provinces.Supplementum epigraphicum graecum, 54:695 ==Etymology== A neokoros (\u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03bao\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 or \u03bd\u03b5\u03c9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) was a sort of warden or sacristan of a temple, probably derived from \u03bd\u03b5\u03ce\u03c2 'temple' + \u03ba\u03bf\u03c1\u03ad\u03c9 'to sweep', thus literally a temple- sweeper.Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, Henry Stuart Jones, A Greek\u2013English Lexicon ==Notes== ==Bibliography== * Barbara Burrell, Neokoroi: Greek Cities and Roman Emperors, Brill, 2004, . ==External links== * \"Neocorate\", Coins celebrating the Neocorate, Coinarchives.com Category:Roman towns types ",
