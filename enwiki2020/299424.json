    "text": "Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport is a county-owned public airport southeast of Kalamazoo, in Kalamazoo County, Michigan, USA. The airport is located approximately west of the city of Battle Creek. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017\u20132021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility. The airport has an Airport Traffic Control Tower (ATCT) and a Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON).AirNav: KAZO \u2013 Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport It has one passenger terminal and five gates. Three major airlines operate flights. ==History== Plans for an airport in Kalamazoo began in 1925. In May 1926 the City of Kalamazoo purchased near Portage and Kilgore roads and an airport opened. The first regular air mail service started in July 1928. In February 1929 the field was licensed as the first municipal airport in Michigan.Kalamazoo Gazette August 8, 1989, p. D2 It was named Lindbergh Field in honor of famous aviator Charles Lindbergh. Airline service came to Kalamazoo in May 1944. Two commuter airlines, Francis Airways and Northern Skyways, provided service to other Michigan cities, then ceased after two years. From 1946 and 1955, several small airlines offered commuter flights to nearby cities. In May 1955, North Central Airlines began daily service to Detroit, and Chicago. North Central eventually became Republic Airlines, which became Northwest Airlines, and finally merged with Delta Air Lines \u2013 which serves the airport today. In 1961 an airport traffic control tower was built and the main runway was extended from 3,900 feet to 5,300. In 1963 an instrument landing system was installed to help during poor weather. In 1977 the runway was further lengthened to 6,500 feet. In 1975 the regional air traffic control facility was moved from Battle Creek to Kalamazoo, and in 1978, a radar facility was installed. The airport eventually won an award for the safest and most efficient air traffic control system in the Great Lakes region. In 1982 the Core Council decided that the City of Kalamazoo should no longer bear the full cost of operating the airport, and in 1984, the City transferred ownership to the County of Kalamazoo. In 1989, the name was changed from Kalamazoo County Airport to Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International to stimulate economic growth in the Battle Creek area. That year, the County also renovated the terminal, doubling its size and expanding the ramp. Over the next four years, passengers increased from 200,000 to more than 500,000 per annum.Kalamazoo Gazette December 20, 1989 p. A1 In 2011 the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport was served by two major airlines who fly passengers to major hubs with worldwide connections. There was also a public charter airline operating twice weekly from Kalamazoo to locations in Florida.Kalamazoo/ Battle Creek International Airport (AZO) As of May 2012 the airport was served by two major commercial airlines who fly passengers to three major hubs. The public charter Direct Air was subject to Chapter 7 liquidation on April 12, 2012, and has since ceased all operations. ===Major jetport=== In the 1970s there were discussions between North Central Airlines and local city officials about building a new airport to serve Battle Creek and Kalamazoo. Since the two airports are close, it was not economical for the airlines to fully serve both of the airports. They proposed a \"Major Jetport\" in the Kalamazoo area, which might have become the third-busiest commuter airport in the nation. No location could be agreed upon, and no planning was ever completed beyond the preliminary proposals and meetings. Soon after the concept failed, most airline service was shifted to Kalamazoo, as the Kalamazoo airport had more passengers and more demand for flights.Kalamazoo Gazette April 14, 1971 p.1 ==Facilities and aircraft== Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport covers at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has three asphalt runways: 17/35, , 05/23, and 09/27, . Present-day taxiways delta and alpha were originally runways.GIS Data at Portage MI website In 2012 the airport had 45,445 aircraft operations (down from 45,942 in 2011, 50,697 in 2009, and 89,502 in 2006), an average of 124 per day: 79% general aviation, 21% air taxi, < 1% scheduled commercial and < 1% military. At that time, there were 109 aircraft based at this airport: 81% single-engine, 12% multi-engine, and 7% jet. ===2007 re-phasing plan=== In 2007 the threshold of runway 17/35 was moved to the south, and taxiway B was closed north of taxiway C. South of runway 09/27, taxiway B was removed and rebuilt to the west.Kalamazoo/ Battle Creek International Airport (AZO) Interior of the old terminal at the Kalamazoo Airport ==Operations== ===General aviation=== The KPA Fueling Center Kalamazoo Airport is used by transient and local private pilots flying for personal reasons, business, or recreation. Many local pilots keep their aircraft in the south tee hangar complex. In 1955 the Kalamazoo-based Upjohn pharmaceutical company began operating aircraft for its executives from the airport. This continued after the firm was acquired by Pfizer. In 1997 after Pharmacia & Upjohn moved its North American sales office from Michigan to New Jersey, the company made daily service to New Jersey available to all employees on a 10-seat jet. Pfizer expanded the service after acquiring Pharmacia Corp. in 2003, and based two 36-passenger jets at the airport. But in June 2008, the aviation unit was closed after 53 years to save money. The move axed 27 jobs; the aircraft were moved to Trenton, New Jersey. As of April 2009, the hangar and property at the Kalamazoo Airport were up for sale. General aviation aircraft are served by Duncan Aviation ===Flight training=== Flight training is offered through Kal-Aero Flight Instruction. The Western Michigan University College of Aviation, founded in 1939, used the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport as a base for its flight school until 1997. In the early 1990s, the flight school began to outgrow the facilities, and in 1997, the college moved to Battle Creek's W. K. Kellogg Airport, where all operations are presently housed. The WMU aviation unit at Kalamazoo has been used from time to time by the college, but not since May 2006. In the 1970s, private flight training operations were restricted to two local FBOs: Kal Aero, and Lakala Aviation. The county government received many complaints about unauthorized lessons from private parties. Upon these reports, the county government added to the flight training ordinance that violators could be fined $500, or jailed for 90 days if found guilty of offering flight lessons illegally.Kalamazoo Gazette July 1, 1971 This restriction has since been lifted, and flight lessons can be offered by any party. ==Airlines and destinations== {| class=\"collapsible collapsed\" style=\"border:1px #aaa solid; width:50em; margin:0.2em auto\" |- !

Furthermore, the airport has used several grants and incentives to attract and retain additional flights and carriers in recent years. ==Terminal== The former AZO Terminal and ATC Tower The original Kalamazoo terminal was a small building made with scrap materials left over from other local projects. In 1958 a new terminal was constructed to replace the 1920s terminal. The growth led to a terminal expansion in 1979 and the building increased from 12,000 to . The terminal was completely renovated in 1989, with the addition of a new concourse, an enlarged boarding area, and a new baggage claim area. The Kalamazoo Airport's 1958 terminal had two jetways and housed the air traffic control tower. A Non- Radar Approach Control, located in Battle Creek and servicing Kalamazoo, was Commissioned in 1969. The air traffic control tower provides ATC services between the hours of 6:00\u201323:00 local time. When the control tower is operational, the airport lies within FAA Class \"D\" airspace. When the approach control is operational pilots may elect to receive radar services associated within a Terminal Radar Service Area (TRSA). The Terminal Control Center (TRACON) facility was not established until 1975, and radar was not installed until 1978. In 2009 construction on a new terminal began next to the existing facility. The new terminal, designed by Reynolds, Smith & Hills, opened in April 2011, and accommodates additional passenger gates, security lanes, and baggage carousels.Russon, Gabrielle. Officials celebrate new Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport terminal at ceremony, Kalamazoo Gazette, mlive.com, April 21, 2011, retrieved 2011-Apr-27 One of the Checker Cabs (Cab 804) used during production of Taxi is now on display in the terminal. The cab was built in 1978 and was loaned to Paramount Television for use in the production of the show. Once the series was cancelled in 1983, the cab was painted blue and became the Checker Motor's First Aid Car. In 2011, Todd Harroun restored the car to its original condition ==Kalamazoo Aviation History Museum== Commonly referred to as the \"Air Zoo\", the museum offers many historic aircraft, simulators, a restaurant, and one of the regions only 4-D theaters. The museum is housed in two buildings, and is located on the south section of the field. It is an attraction for the public, and for pilots. The museum also has a fly in ramp, making it an attraction for many visiting pilots. In June and October 2011 the Air Zoo opened a new building connecting it to the main building allowing all the attractions and exhibits to be in one easy to see location. The original building (East Campus) was renovated to house the restoration center.Air Zoo :: General Information :: Admission info, business conference rental, memberships, about Kalamazoo and contact informationGoogle Maps ==Incidents and accidents== Several accidents and incidents have occurred at Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport.
