As an affront to the fans, he renamed the titles to the Canadian Heavyweight Championship, 100 kg and Under Championship, and Saskatchewan Hardcore International Title (S.H.I.T.), respectively, complete with large Canadian flag stickers that covered the belts' faceplates. Storm then formed the group called Team Canada in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada during New Blood Rising on August 13, where he defended the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship in a match with Mike Awesome. The match was refereed by the Canadian Jacques Rougeau, who enabled Storm to defeat Awesome and retain his title by constantly changing the rules.

Storm, portrayed as a serious, humourless heel, was in The Alliance and was the first WCW superstar to ever invade a WWF program, where he debuted on the May 28, 2001 episode of Raw. At Invasion, Storm and Mike Awesome faced Edge and Christian in a losing effort. Storm received a modest push during the Invasion angle, as he would go on to win the WWF Intercontinental Championship from Albert on the July 23 episode of Raw.

Storm and Regal began their second reign as World Tag Team Champions the next night on Raw by defeating the Dudley Boyz with help from Morley again. At No Way Out, Storm and Regal defeated Kane and Rob Van Dam to retain the titles. On the March 24 episode of Raw, Morley announced that since the belts had not been defended in 30 days due to Regal's legitimate health problems, the duo would be stripped of the title. He immediately named himself and Lance Storm the new World Tag Team Champions starting Storm's fourth tag team title reign.

At Judgment Day, Storm competed in a Battle Royal for the vacant WWE Intercontinental Championship which was won by Christian. From there, Storm was briefly involved in a storyline in which Stone Cold Steve Austin, an authority figure, encouraged the fans to chant \"boring\" during Storm's matches including one with Storm losing to newcomer Garrison Cade on June 16, 2003, thanks to Austin bringing out a pillow and blanket and snoring loudly into the microphone, and other distracting antics. Storm eventually found help from Goldust who helped improve Storm's charisma, which eventually turned Storm into a face and Storm started dancing. He soon rejoined Morley, who had also become a face and reverted to his Val Venis character. Their reformed team began entering the ring with very attractive women but this time their tag team never got a push. Storm and Goldust then began teaming together for a short period of time.

I still have my school, and I will always be a part of this business, but I truly believe I am now done as a performer.
