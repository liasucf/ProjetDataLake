    "text": "St Saviour's Church is an active Church of England parish church in Iford, Dorset, England. It was designed by Frederic W. Lawrence and opened in 1936. ==History== St Saviour's was built to serve Iford, a suburb of Bournemouth, at a time when the small settlement was undergoing rapid expansion. The population had reached 5,000 by 1934 and expansion was set to double this number over the following few years. In February 1934, the Rev. C. W. C. Browne appealed before a meeting of the Bournemouth Ruri-Decanal Conference for \u00a310,000 to construct a church. By February 1936, \u00a37,080 had been raised towards the \u00a39,500 building fund, while in September only \u00a31,000 remained to be found. Mr. Frederic W. Lawrence of Bournemouth drew up the plans for the church which was influenced by Romanesque architecture. The foundation stone was laid on 14 August 1935 and the church was built by Mr. Frank Grigg & Sons. St Saviour's was consecrated by the Bishop of Winchester, the Right Rev. Cyril Garbett, on 22 September 1936. Described by the Bournemouth Graphic as a \"most impressive ceremonial\", the consecration marked the formation of Iford as a parish and St Saviour's as the parish church. ==Architecture== St Saviour's is built of multi-coloured bricks, with the interior walls rendered in plaster and the roof of tiles and asphalt. It was designed to seat 462 persons and made up of a nave, north and south aisle, chancel, Lady chapel, organ chamber, choir vestry, clergy vestry, warden's room and two west porches. ==References== ==External links== * St Saviour's Church website Category:Church of England church buildings in Dorset Category:1936 establishments in England ",
