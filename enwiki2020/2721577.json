The word gy\u016btan is a combination of the Japanese word for and the English word tongue. Since gy\u016btan literally means \"cow tongue,\" the word is also used to refer to cow tongues in Japan. The custom of cooking gy\u016btan originated in Sendai in 1948, and is usually served with barley rice, tail soup, and pickles in the Sendai area. In other areas in Japan, gy\u016btan is most often served in yakiniku restaurants. Gy\u016btan was originally conceived to be flavored with salt, which led to gy\u016btan being called in many yakiniku restaurants. However, some stores now serve gy\u016btan with tare sauce. ==History== Gy\u016btan was created when Sano Keishir\u014d, the owner of a yakitori restaurant in Sendai, opened a new restaurant that served cow tongue dishes in 1948. This restaurant was called Tasuke (\u592a\u52a9), and is still considered one of the best places to eat gy\u016btan in Sendai. Most locals falsely believe and even advertise that gy\u016btan started when Sano decided to use cow tongues and tails left over by occupation forces, which were stationed in Sendai after Japan was defeated in World War II. However, a simple check of the official restaurant website states that at the beginning the ingredients were retrieved by shopping trips via steam train to adjacent Yamagata Prefecture. Gy\u016btan was initially considered a rather unusual dish, but gradually gained popularity throughout Japan, partially because white collar workers who were transferred from Sendai spread its reputation to other cities. Gy\u016btan restaurants received a boost in 1991, when Japan's import quotas for beef were eliminated. In 2003, the Japanese government temporarily banned American beef imports after mad cow disease was discovered in the country. This was a devastating blow for many gy\u016btan restaurants. For example, 90% of the beef tongues used in gy\u016btan restaurants in Sendai were imported from the U.S. Additionally, some connoisseurs claim that U.S. beef contains the ideal amount of fat for gy\u016btan dishes and refuse to use Australian beef. ==References== Much of the content of this article comes from the equivalent Japanese-language Wikipedia article (retrieved September 21, 2005).
