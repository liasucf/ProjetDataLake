He has illustrated record sleeves for bands such as The Fall, Big Black, Sonic Youth and Rocket From The Crypt amongst others. Savage Pencil was also a member of The Art Attacks, a band who released two 7\"s; \"I'm A Dalek\" b/w \"Neutron Bomb\" (released on the Albatross label in 1977) and \"First & Last\" / \"Punk Rock Stars\" / \"Rat City\" (released on the Fresh label in 1979). He is currently a member of the \"improvising drone-rock noise band\" Pestrepeller, along with Peter Hope-Evans (ex-Medicine Head), Ed Pinsent, Harley Richardson, Nick Neocleous and Rob Brown. They released an album in May 2006 on Important Records, entitled Isle of Dark Magick, described in the press release as \"a gem of free-improvised-found- sound-collage enriched with dark pagan folky vibes and supernatural horror noise dedicated to H. P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith and Austin Osman Spare.\" AllMusic described them stating \"There's a kind of loopy charm to the oddball British band Pestrepeller\". ==References== ==Other sources== *Savage Pencil at Lambiek's Comiclopedia ==External links== * * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:Artists from Leeds Category:British comics artists Category:British male journalists Category:English music journalists Category:The Wire writers ",
