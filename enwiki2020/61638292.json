It serves as an arterial highway between the T\u014dhoku Expressway and Sanriku Expressway in the northern part of the prefecture. The road is managed by Miyagi Prefecture. ==History== Miyagi-Kenpoku Road facing west near its eastern terminus in Tome The first section of the Miyagi-Kenpoku Road was originally scheduled to be opened on 17 March 2011; however, the opening was postponed due to the 2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami. The section was instead opened on 24 November 2011. After the area was devastated by the earthquake and tsunami, priority was given to completing the road as a link from the T\u014dhoku Expressway to the disaster area. Construction is still underway as it does not yet connect directly to the T\u014dhoku Expressway. ==Junction list== The entire highway is in Miyagi Prefecture. ==See also== * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Regional High-Standard Highways in Japan Category:Roads in Miyagi Prefecture ",
