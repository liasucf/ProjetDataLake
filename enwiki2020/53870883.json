    "text": "Binodoxys communis is a parasitoid wasp of the genus Binodoxys. The genus Binodoxys is located in the subfamily Aphidiinae which are noted parasitoids of aphids. == Description == The adults of Binodoxys communis are approximately 1.2 mm in length. This small braconid wasp has a brown head, antennae, legs, and thorax. The wing venation is brown and the wings are nearly hyaline. The first tergite, trochanters, and the base of the tibiae are yellow. The rest of the abdomen is brown. Ovipositer sheaths and prongs are relatively lighter in color.Stary P and Schlinger EI. 1967. \"Revision of Far East Asian Aphidiinae\". Series Entomologica. Vol. 3. PDF. == Economic value == Binodoxys communis was released in the United States prior to 1979 to control Aphis gossypii (Glover), but establishment resulting from that release was questionable.Krombein KV, Hurd PD Jr, Smith DR, Burks BD. 1979. \"Catalog of Hymenoptera in America North of Mexico. Volume 1, Symphya and Apocrita (Parasitica)\". Smithsonian Institution Press. Washington D.C. Binodoxys communis was vetted and released in the United States again in 2007 to control the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura.Wyckhuys KAG, Stone L, Desneux N, Hoelmer KA, Hopper KR, Heimpel GE. 2008. \"Parasitism of the soybean aphid, Aphis glycines by Binodoxys communis: the role of aphid defensive behavior and parasitoid reproductive performance\". Bulletin of Entomological Research. 98(4): 361-370. Establishment of B. communis throughout the United States has been questionable, likely due to reduced aphid population because of fungal pathogens, competition with other species of parasitoid, and prophylactic usage of pesticides. ==References== Category:Braconidae Category:Insects described in 1926 ",
