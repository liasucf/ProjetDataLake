    "text": "El R\u00edo () is the name given to the sea strait that separates La Graciosa from Lanzarote in the Canary Islands. R\u00edo, in Spanish, means 'river'. At its narrowest point, the strait is just over wide. El R\u00edo is part of the marine reserve established around La Graciosa and the islets north of Lanzarote. ==Points of Interest== Caleta de Sebo is located on the strait's northwestern shore. It is the larger one of only two settlements on the island of La Graciosa. Overlooking the strait from the southeastern shore are the cliffs of Famara, on the island of Lanzarote. One of local artist C\u00e9sar Manrique's creations, Mirador del R\u00edo, consists of a viewpoint located at a height of on the cliffs of Famara. The viewpoint overlooks onto La Graciosa and the rest of the Chinijo Archipelago across the strait of El R\u00edo, after which the viewpoint is named. The Salinas del R\u00edo are located at the feet of the cliffs of Famara along the shore of El R\u00edo. Believed to be the oldest salt evaporation ponds in the Canary Islands, the salt pans fell out of use in the second half of the twentieth century. They are, as of 2018, under restoration.

Ferries depart Lanzarote from the port of \u00d3rzola and head into the strait of El R\u00edo to reach the port of Caleta de Sebo on La Graciosa.

Travel time is about 25 minutes. ==Open Water Swimming== The Traves\u00eda a nado \"El R\u00edo\" is an annual open water swimming event that crosses the strait. The start line is Playa de Bajo Risco on Lanzarote and the finish line is the dock at Caleta de Sebo on La Graciosa, covering a distance of . The event first took place in September 1993 and has been organised every year since then, in either September or October depending on the tides. ==References== ",
