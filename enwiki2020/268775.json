    "text": "Jane Kennedy (born 9 June 1964) is an Australian actress, comedian, radio presenter and television producer, best known for her work with Working Dog Productions, a group of performers responsible for a variety of television and films. She currently co-hosts KennedyMolloy on Triple M with Mick Molloy. ==Career== She met the other members of the group, which over time included Tom Gleisner, Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tony Martin, Mick Molloy, and Jason Stephens among others, while working on Melbourne commercial radio on the D-Generation Breakfast Show. Kennedy was not originally a member of the group, but was the newsreader assigned to work with them during their timeslot. The team quickly made a game of trying to make her laugh while she read the news. After their frequent success in this aim led to Kennedy joining the D-Generation as a full time member and she continued to work with them on the radio show. The group stayed together to later write, direct and produce The Late Show, a comedy sketch show, Frontline, a widely acclaimed spoof of television current affairs in which she played ambitious reporter Brooke Vandenberg, and Funky Squad, a retro styled spoof of 70s police dramas. Since the mid-1990s, Kennedy has mostly stayed behind the camera as a casting director and producer for various Working Dog productions, including their panel talk show The Panel, and the films The Castle and The Dish. Kennedy also appeared on the radio program Get This occasionally, and has been a semi- regular panelist on television chat show The Circle. In 2009, Kennedy released her first cookbook, Fabulous Food Minus the Boombah. In 2010, she released her second cookbook, OMG! I Can Eat That? and has since written two other cookbooks \"One Dish Two Ways\" and \"The Big Book of Fabulous Food\" As of mid-2017 she has been co-hosting Kennedy Molloy, a national drive show on the Triple M Network in 2018 with her long time comedy colleague Mick Molloy. === Films === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; text- align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:33px;\"|Year ! rowspan=\"2\"|Production ! colspan=\"5\"|Credited as |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; text-align:center;\" !
