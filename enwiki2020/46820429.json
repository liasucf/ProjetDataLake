Mainly a central defender, he could also operate as a defensive midfielder. ==Football career== Born in Gatika in 1931, Province of Biscay, Basque Country, since he was a child he knew that he wanted to be a professional footballer. He started his football career with 14 years in the modest team \"C.D Bego\u00f1a\" of Bilbao. Then, he went to C.D Mungia, to continue his formation and in the 1954\u201355 season he signed up by the Sestao Football Club. Then he played in first Division teams like Athletic Club of Bilbao, C.E Sabadell, C.D Osasuna, Azcoyen of Peralta, etc., due to a severe Achilles heel injury when 39 years old. Angel Sertucha resumed his career in the First Divisi\u00f3n and in the Second division of then Spanish league, being the captain CE Sabadell FC, being an undisputed starter during most of his stay and eventually gaining club captaincy. ==Personal life== Angel Sertucha\u2019s retirement was not his last moment in football; after his retirement in 1969, he worked as a football coach in his first team, C.D Mungia. When he was in his third season, he decided this was not his place and his choice of professional career, so he decided to give up completely the life around football to open a tavern in the same city, \"Mungia\", and to spend time with his wife and his son and daughters. ==References== *PEREZ, Ignacio.(2012) www.athletic.elcorreo.com. * Mungia homenajea a Sertucha, ex del Athletic www.noticias.lainformacion.com ==External links== *www.bdfutbol.com *www.memoriasdelfutbolvasco.wordpress.com Category:1931 births Category:2019 deaths Category:People from Mungialdea Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:CE Sabadell FC footballers ",
