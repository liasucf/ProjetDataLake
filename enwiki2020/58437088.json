    "text": "Boreostemma is an extinct genus of glyptodonts from northern South America. Fossils assigned to the genus were first described as belonging to Asterostemma from southern South America, but have been placed in the new genus Boreostemma by Carlini et al. in 2008. The type species is B. pliocena. Fossils of Boreostemma have been found in the Honda Group of Colombia, in Peru and Venezuela. == Etymology == The genus name Boreostemma is a combination of stemma, taken from Asterostemma, and boreo is derived from borealis, meaning \"northern\", to distinguish the northern South American genus from the southern Asterostemma. == Species == Four species have been described in the genus Boreostemma.Boreostemma at Fossilworks.org Unspecified Boreostemma fossils were found in the Ipururo Formation of the department of Ucayali, Amazonian Peru.IN-DTC-28 at Fossilworks.orgIN-DTC-32 at Fossilworks.orgIN007 at Fossilworks.org Asterostemma contains the type species A. depressa and several nomina dubia. The genus has been found in the Early Miocene (Santacrucian in the SALMA classification) Santa Cruz Formation of the province of Santa Cruz, Argentina and in the Solim\u00f5es Formation in the state of Acre, Amazonian Brazil.Ca\u00f1ad\u00f3n Jack, Yak-Harvey at Fossilworks.orgRio Acre at Fossilworks.org ;B. pliocena The type species B. pliocena was described in 2008 by Carlini et al. based on 30 osteoderms palate fragment with M6-7 alveoli.Boreostemma pliocena at Fossilworks.org Fossils have been described from the type locality along the road to T\u00edo Gregorio in the Codore Formation at the Lagerst\u00e4tte of Urumaco.Road to Tio Gregorio Locality at Fossilworks.org ;B. gigantea B. gigantea was described as Asterostemma gigantea in 1997 by Carlini et al. based on a partial skeleton.Boreostemma gigantea at Fossilworks.org Fossils have been recovered at the Duke Localities 32, 108, 113, 114 and 121W in the La Victoria Formation of the Honda Group at the Konzentrat-Lagerst\u00e4tte La Venta.Duke Locality 32 at Fossilworks.orgDuke Locality 108 at Fossilworks.orgDuke Locality 113 at Fossilworks.orgDuke Locality 114 at Fossilworks.orgDuke Locality 121W at Fossilworks.org ;B. acostae B. acostae was described as Asterostemma acostae in 1983 by Carlos Villarroel based on a carapace fragment with 44 plates.Boreostemma acostae at Fossilworks.org Fossils have been found in the Cerbatana Member, and the Chunchullo Sandstone of the La Victoria Formation, of the Honda Group at the Konzentrat-Lagerst\u00e4tte La Venta.Arcillas San Nicolas at Fossilworks.orgChunchullo Sandstone at Fossilworks.org ;B. venezolensis B. venezolensis was described as Asterostemma venezolensis in 1947 by George Gaylord Simpson,Simpson, 1947, p.2 based on most of the carapace and the anterior end of the lower jaw, including teeth.Boreostemma venezolensis at Fossilworks.org Fossils have been uncovered from the Santa In\u00e9s Formation along the banks of the G\u00fcere River in the state of Anzo\u00e1tegui in Venezuela.Banks of the G\u00fcere River at Fossilworks.org == Gallery == == See also == * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Colombia * South American land mammal ages * Glyptodon == References == === Bibliography === * * * * * Category:Prehistoric cingulates Category:Miocene xenarthrans Category:Miocene mammals of South America Category:Laventan Category:Montehermosan Category:Neogene Colombia Category:Fossils of Colombia Category:Honda Group, Colombia Category:Neogene Peru Category:Fossils of Peru Category:Neogene Venezuela Category:Fossils of Venezuela Category:Fossil taxa described in 2008 ",
