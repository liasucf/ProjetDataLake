The definite borders of modern nation-states do not apply in other forms of societal organisation, where \"divided\" islands may consequently be less noteworthy. For example, in Ancient Greece, the island of Euboea was divided among several city states, including Chalcis and Eretria; and before its settlement by Europeans, the Island of Tasmania was divided among nine indigenous tribes. Islands in wartime may be divided between an invading and defending power, as with Crete in 1645\u20131669 between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice. Examples of formerly divided islands include: *Corsica \u2013 was divided between the Republic of Pisa and the Republic of Genoa by a ruling by Pope Innocent II in 1132, and it remained so until the Battle of Meloria of 1284. Then Corsica successively became part of Genoa, Aragon, Genoa again, the Corsican Republic, France, Anglo-Corsican Kingdom, and finally France again. *Sardinia \u2013 was divided into indigenous giudicati since before the year 900 through the extinction of the Giudicato of Arborea in 1420. Since then, Sardina has successively been part of Aragon, the Spanish Empire, Piedmont\u2013Sardinia, the Kingdom of Italy, and the Republic of Italy. *Saaremaa (1237\u20131570) and Hiiumaa (1254\u20131563) \u2013 Divided between the Livonian Order and the Bishopric of \u00d6sel-Wiek (the Kingdom of Denmark after 1560). Thereafter these were part of Denmark (Saaremaa only), the Kingdom of Sweden, Imperial Russia, Estonia, the Soviet Union, Nazi Germany (1941\u20131944), the Soviet Union again, and finally Estonia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. *Piirissaar in Lake Peipus \u2013 literally \"Border Island\" in Estonian, it was first divided in the 13th or 14th century and remained divided between the Bishopric of Dorpat and the later Polish Livonia and Swedish Livonia on one side and the Novgorod Republic and the later Principality of Pskov, Pskov Republic and the Tsardom of Russia on the other side until the annexation of Swedish Livonia into Russia in 1721. *Tobago \u2013 from 1654 through 1659, this island had colonies from both the Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and the Dutch Republic. Both of these colonies failed economically and were abandoned. Later, Tobago became part of the French Empire, then the Kingdom of Great Britain (1706), the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the present United Kingdom, and the independent country of Trinidad and Tobago. *Ternate \u2013 divided between the Spanish Empire allied with Tidore, and the Dutch Republic allied with the Sultan of Ternate from 1607 through 1663. Later, Ternate has successive been owned by the Netherlands, the Japanese Empire (1942\u20131945), Netherlands again, and the independent country of Indonesia, beginning in 1949. *Long Island, New York \u2013 divided between the Dutch Republic and the Kingdom of England beginning in 1640 (de facto, by the founding of the Southold), or in 1650 (de jure, by the Treaty of Hartford), through to the surrender of New Netherland to the British Army in 1664. Thereafter, Long Island has been owned by Kingdom of England, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the United States from 1781 through the present. Long Island has been part of the State of New York since 1781, and it is the largest island in the Contiguous United States (48 states). *Great Britain \u2013 Earlier divided into three or more kingdoms, including England, Wales, and Scotland, and sometimes ruled in part by the Roman Empire and the Danish Empire. These parts were reduced to just two before 1707, when the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland enacted the Acts of Union of 1707, establishing just one monarchy and one parliament.

Much of the former Canal Zone area was transferred to Panama on that day. The Panama Railroad served as the new border in an area where it crosses Gatun Lake via a causeway, with the railroad bisecting Frijoles Island.

The water level of Lake Chad has historically varied a lot, but this level has fallen so low that these islets are now part of the mainland of Africa. == Subnational divided islands == There are islands that lie across different provinces or states of the same country.
