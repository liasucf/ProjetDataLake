In his rookie year as an NHL head coach, Boucher led the Tampa Bay Lightning to game seven of the Eastern Conference Final. On March 24, 2013, the team's general manager Steve Yzerman fired Boucher following a 5\u20133 loss against the Ottawa Senators. At the time, Tampa Bay was in 14th place in the Eastern Conference. On January 27, 2014, the Swiss ice hockey club SC Bern announced the signing of Guy Boucher as their head coach. Boucher guided the team to the title in the 2014\u201315 Swiss Cup competition. On November 18, 2015, Boucher was fired by SC Bern following a four-game losing streak and a ninth-place finish in the NLA. On May 8, 2016, Boucher signed a three-year contract to become the head coach of the Ottawa Senators. With his hire, Boucher is the first person to coach both franchises from the 1992 expansion class. In his first season, the club advanced to the Eastern Conference Final, losing in double overtime in game seven to the Pittsburgh Penguins. In his second season, the team's performance nose-dived and it placed 30th out of 31 teams in the NHL. On March 1, 2019, with the Senators in 31st place, Boucher was fired and associate coach Marc Crawford named as interim head coach. ==International== Boucher worked as an assistant coach for Canada men's national U-18 ice hockey team in 2006, 2007 and 2008.

Boucher has a prominent scar on his right cheek. When asked how he received it, Boucher said \"it is not hockey-related. I did not tell anybody back home, so it is like this little enigma. My kids do not even know.\" Guy Boucher's scar is often compared to the \"Le Chiffre\" character's scar in Casino Royale and Boucher is sometimes referred to as a \"James Bond villain\". He was spoofed as such on-air by Jay Onrait of the Canadian TSN sports television channel. ==NHL coaching record== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size: 95%; text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\"|Team !! rowspan=\"2\"|Year !! colspan=\"6\"|Regular season !! colspan=\"4\"|Postseason |- !
