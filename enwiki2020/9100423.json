    "text": "The inside of a goug\u00e8re A goug\u00e8re (), in French cuisine, is a baked savory choux pastry made of choux dough mixed with cheese. There are many variants. The cheese is commonly grated Gruy\u00e8re, Comt\u00e9, or Emmentaler,Daniel Young, The Bistros, Brasseries, and Wine Bars of Paris, p. 20. .Larousse Gastronomique, 1988 edition, 2001 translation. . but there are many variants using other cheeses or other ingredients. Goug\u00e8res are said to come from Burgundy, particularly the town of Tonnerre in the Yonne department.Larousse Gastronomique, 1st edition Goug\u00e8res can be made as small pastries, in diameter; aperitif goug\u00e8res, ; individual goug\u00e8res; or in a ring. Sometimes they are filled with ingredients such as mushrooms, beef, or ham; in this case the goug\u00e8re is usually made using a ring or pie tin. In Burgundy, they are generally served cold when tasting wine in cellars, but are also served warm as an appetizer. This delicate dish is best for special celebrations, such as parties. ==History== While the term currently refers specifically to savory choux pastries, eighteenth and nineteenth century records suggest that it was once an umbrella term for a number of preparations, some composed of just cheese, eggs, and breadcrumbs.Pierre Larousse, Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si\u00e8cle, 1872, s.v. goug\u00e8re, though this may be an error The presentation was usually a flat circle, neither a sphere nor a ring.No\u00ebl Chomel, Dictionnaire Oeconomique: Contenant Divers Moyens D'Augmenter Son Bien, Et De Conserver Sa Sant\u00e9 Google BooksPrudence Boissi\u00e8re, Dictionnaire analogique de la langue fran\u00e7aise: r\u00e9pertoire complet des mots par les id\u00e9es et des id\u00e9es par les mots, 1862 Google Books Earlier forms of goug\u00e8re were more a stew than a pastry, including herbs, bacon, eggs, cheese, spices, and meat mixed with an animal's blood, and prepared in a sheep's stomach. In medieval France, it was a kind of cheese tart or pie. Later, it was unknown outside what is now Belgium, where it became associated with Palm Sunday.Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Eug\u00e8ne Godefroy, Dictionnaire de l'ancienne langue fran\u00e7aise et de tous ses dialectes du ixe au xve si\u00e8cle, 1885 Google Books But it was also attested in Auxerre (Burgundy) in the 19th century under the name gouere.Jean-Baptiste de La Curne, Dictionnaire historique de l'ancien langage fran\u00e7ois, 1879 Google Books ==Name== The word goug\u00e8re was formerly spelled gouiere, gouyere,Tr\u00e9sor de la langue fran\u00e7aise, s.v. goug\u00e8re go\u00ef\u00e8re, goy\u00e8re, or gouy\u00e8re. The modern spelling appears to date from the 18th century. The ultimate origin of the word is unknown. ==See also== * A Talking Cat!?! * P\u00e3o de queijo * Scone * List of choux pastry dishes ==References== Category:Cheese dishes Category:French pastries ",
