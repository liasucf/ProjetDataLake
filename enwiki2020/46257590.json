Liezl made a statement that she did not have any symptoms but that since her doctor said women aged 40 and above should undergo breast examinations yearly, she underwent the test.http://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2013/08/12/1079661/liezl-her- personal-cancer-treatment Liezl had just recovered and \"regained her crowning glory\" when, in July 2011, she had had a persistent cough. She consulted with Dr. Liza Garcia, her pulmonologist at TMC, who ordered some tests that later showed that she had fluid in her lungs. When the fluids were drained from her lungs, the diagnosis confirmed that Liezl\u2019s cancer had recurred and had metastasized to her left lung; the cancer was already in its Stage 4. \u201cI thought I was okay and then it happened. It was much more painful and harder to accept,\u201d Liezl said in an interview. Throughout her battle with cancer, Liezl had the support of her husband, Albert. In a Philippine Daily Inquirer report in 2012, Albert stated that he would make sure she lived \u201cas normal a life as possible.\u201dhttp://entertainment.inquirer.net/165542/liezl-martinez- wife-of-actor-albert-martinez-passes-away Liezl Martinez\u2019s mother, former movie queen Amalia Fuentes, stood by her daughter's deathbed.

Grace Poe said: \u201cShe was a good mother and wife, had a firm grasp of what is right or wrong, with a strong connection and concern for the movie and TV industries, balanced by her compassion for the welfare of children.\u201d With the MTRCB, Liezl took charge of the \u201cMatalinong Panonood\u201d sorties to various parts of the country. Liezl was designated to oversee physical improvements in the MTRCB Building, a task she relished and was meticulous to the detail. The building's fourth floor board room was later named the Liezl S.
