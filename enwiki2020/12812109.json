It was a live concert performance by the American female vocal trio The Three Degrees, who were backed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra at London's prestigious Royal Albert Hall on 8 October 1979. This was The Three Degrees' second television special. == Overview == The show was based around the promotion of the group's latest album 3D, which had been released by European record label Ariola just prior to the engagement. Six songs from the concert went on to form side two of the group's Gold album released the following year.
