He was born in Cardiff to a Baptist family and was educated at Taunton School in Somerset and at the London School of Economics.Martin Loughlin, 'John Griffith obituary', The Guardian (25 May 2010), retrieved 23 July 2019. He was initially a conscientious objector during the Second World War but he subsequently changed his mind and enlisted, ending the war as a major in the Indian army. After the War he lectured at the University College of Wales, returning to the LSE in 1948 as a lecturer in law. Griffith subsequently became chair of English law (in 1959) and chair of public law (in 1970). He retired from the LSE in 1984 and was afterwards elected as Chancellor of the University of Manchester, a post he held for seven years. He had been elected a Fellow of the British Academy in 1977. Griffith's legal works, according to Martin Loughlin, \"subverted the self-satisfied liberal- democratic view about the nature and functioning of the constitution, replacing it with a more realistic \u201cwhat actually happens\u201d account...his more explicitly political analyses tended to highlight the authoritarian nature of government and in particular the close political, social and class linkages of the elites in power\". Griffith's also \"advanced a radical critique of the role of the judiciary, especially when it strayed into the field of politics\". Griffith's believed that the idea of \"the rule of law\" was \"a fantasy invented by Liberals of the old school in the late-19th century and patented by the Tories to throw a protective sanctity around certain legal and political institutions and principles which they wish to preserve at any cost\". In its review of Griffith's 1977 work The Politics of the Judiciary, the Times Literary Supplement claimed that Griffith's \"ends up aligned with the Baader\u2013Meinhof gang in believing that every criminal trial is categorically unjust\". The book subsequently became a bestseller and Lord Denning later complained: \"The youngsters believe that we come from a narrow background\u2014it's nonsense\u2014they get it from that man Griffith\".Anthony Sampson, The Changing Anatomy of Britain (London: Hodder and Staughton, 1982), p. 159. ==Works== *(with Harry Street), Principles of Administrative Law (1952). *(with Harry Street), A Casebook of Administrative Law (1964). *Central Departments and Local Authorities (1966). *Parliamentary Scrutiny of Government Bills (1974). *(with Trevor Hartley), Government and Law (1975). *The Politics of the Judiciary (1977). *(with Harriet Harman), Justice Deserted (1979). *Socialism in a Cold Climate (1983). *(with Michael Ryle), Parliament: Functions, Practice and Procedures (1989). *Judicial Politics since 1920: A Chronicle (1993). ==Notes== Category:1918 births Category:2010 deaths Category:People educated at Taunton School Category:Alumni of the London School of Economics Category:Academics of the London School of Economics Category:Welsh legal scholars Category:Fellows of the British Academy ",
