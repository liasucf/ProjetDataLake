    "text": "Customatix (later \"Cmax\") was a Santa Cruz, California-based seller of made- to-order footwear launched in May 2000. The parent company, Solemates, Inc., was founded in 1999 by former Adidas executives Dave Ward, Irmi Kreuzer, Mikal Peveto and David Solk. The Customatix.com website allowed the user to customize one of several shoe designs and purchase a pair of shoes. Each basic shoe design featured a large selection of customizable parameters, including choice of component materials and colors, plus text and graphics, allowing trillions of possible variations. The web application was created by a dot com engineering company called Lutris Technologies. The Chief Designer was Noel Barnes and Production Manager was Daryl L Tempesta. The Cmax project was published in the magazine \"HOW\". Over 1 million images were created. Some shoes had 3 billion trillion combinations . Customized shoes were manufactured in China and shipped directly to the customer. By mid-2004, the website had gone offline. ==See also== * Mass customization * Configuration system ==References== ==External links== * 2000 Forbes Article * 2001 Wired Article Category:Shoe companies of the United States Category:Companies based in Santa Cruz County, California Category:Santa Cruz, California Category:Clothing companies established in 2000 Category:American companies disestablished in 2004 Category:American companies established in 2000 ",
