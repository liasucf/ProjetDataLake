    "text": "The initial seat distribution of the 16th Canadian Parliament William Lyon Mackenzie King was Prime Minister during the 16th Canadian Parliament. The 16th Canadian Parliament was in session from December 9, 1926, until May 30, 1930. The membership was set by the 1926 federal election on September 14, 1926, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1930 election. It was controlled by a Liberal Party minority under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and the 14th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the Conservative Party, led briefly by Hugh Guthrie, and then by Richard Bedford Bennett. The Speaker was Rodolphe Lemieux. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1924-1933 for a list of the ridings in this parliament.
