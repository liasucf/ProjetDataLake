She was commissioned in 1870 to participate in the Franco-Prussian War and was assigned to the Baltic Squadron that unsuccessfully attempted to blockade Prussian ports in the Baltic Sea. The ship later served in both the Northern and Mediterranean Squadrons before being discarded in 1894. ==Design and description== The s were designed by Henri Dupuy de L\u00f4me as an improved version of the s. The ships were central battery ironclads with the armament concentrated amidships.de Balincourt and Vincent-Br\u00e9chignac 1975, p. 26 For the first time in a French ironclad three watertight iron bulkheads were fitted in the hull. Like most ironclads of their era they were equipped with a metal-reinforced ram.Gardiner, p. 288 The ship measured overall, with a beam of . Oc\u00e9an had a maximum draft of and displaced . Her crew numbered between 750 and 778 officers and men. The metacentric height of the ship was very low, between . ===Propulsion=== The Oc\u00e9an-class ships had one horizontal return connecting rod compound steam engine driving a single propeller. Their engines were powered by eight oval boilers. On sea trials the engine produced and Oc\u00e9an reached . She carried of coal which allowed her to steam for approximately at a speed of . The Oc\u00e9an-class ships were barque or barquentine-rigged with three masts and had a sail area around . ===Armament=== These ships had their main armament mounted in four barbettes on the upper deck, one gun at each corner of the battery, with the remaining guns on the battery deck below the barbettes. Oc\u00e9ans original armament consisted of four guns in the barbettes, and on the battery deck, four and four guns. This was upgraded to four guns in the barbettes and eight guns on the battery deck before she was commissioned.Silverstone, p. 62 The 18-caliber 274-millimeter Mod\u00e8le 1870 gun fired an armor-piercing, shell while the gun itself weighed . The gun fired its shell at a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle. The armor-piercing shell of the 19-caliber 240-millmeter Mod\u00e8le 1870 gun weighed while the gun itself weighed . It had a muzzle velocity of and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal of wrought iron armour at the muzzle.Brassey, p. 477 At some point the ship received a dozen Hotchkiss 5-barrel revolving guns. They fired a shell weighing about at a muzzle velocity of about to a range of about . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute. The hull was not recessed to enable any of the guns on the battery deck to fire forward or aft. However, the guns mounted in the barbettes sponsoned out over the sides of the hull did have some ability to fire fore and aft. Late in the ship's career four above-water torpedo tubes were added. ===Armor=== The Ocean-class ships had a complete wrought iron waterline belt. The sides of the battery itself were armored with of wrought iron. The barbette armor was thick. The unarmored portions of their sides were protected by iron plates. Gardiner says that the barbette armor was later removed to improve their stability, but this is not confirmed by any other source. ==Service== Oc\u00e9an was laid down at Brest in July 1865 and launched on 15 October 1868. The ship began her sea trials on 3 December 1869, but was not commissioned until 21 July 1870 for service during the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371. Oc\u00e9an was assigned to the Northern Squadron that attempted to blockade Prussian ports on the Baltic until the squadron was ordered to return to Cherbourg on 16 September 1870.de Balincourt and Vincent-Br\u00e9chignac 1975, p. 30 Afterward she was assigned to the Evolutionary Squadron until 1875 when she was placed in reserve. Oc\u00e9an was recommissioned in 1879 for service with the Mediterranean Squadron. She had a lengthy refit in 1884\u201385 and was assigned to the Northern Squadron after it was completed. Around 1888 the ship was transferred back to the Mediterranean Squadron until she was reduced to reserve around 1891. Oc\u00e9an was assigned to the Gunnery School that same year and later became a training ship for naval apprentices before being condemned in 1894. ==Footnotes== ==References== * * * * ==External links== * classe Oc\u00e9an Category:Ships built in France Category:1868 ships Category:Oc\u00e9an-class ironclads ",
