Rai was not happy with the rough cut and stopped the shooting. He then approached Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari to direct it, but she could not do it because of her \"prior commitments\". In November 2016, it was announced that Anurag Kashyap will now be directing Manmarziyaan written by Kanika Dhillon. Initially, it was reported by the media that Dulquer Salmaan, Ayushmann Khurrana and Bhumi Pednekar were cast in the film, but they dropped out of the film. Abhishek Bachchan was then brought in as a replacement for Dulquer Salmaan. Abhishek Bachchan and Anurag Kashyap had differences in the past; one of the reasons being Kashyap's criticism of Bachchan's 2010 movie Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey. They had however resolved their differences and were excited to work together again when the opportunity arose. The movie marked Bachchan's return to acting after a 2 year hiatus. The film was shot in Punjab, while some portions in Delhi and Kashmir. ==Box office== Manmarziyaan was well received at the box office. It had a fair weekend at the box office as it managed to collect 4 crore on opening day. The film saw further jump in collections on Sunday as a result of which 5.70 crore more came in. The worldwide gross of the movie was 40.39 crore. == Reception == Manmarziyan received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the film for its contemporary take on a love story and the overall strong performances from its cast. Taapsee Pannu received universal praise for her performance as the mercurial Rumi. As a love-triangle with a running length of 155 minutes, the subject matter was a venture into conventional Bollywood territory for director Anurag Kashyap. Critic Anupama Chopra noted \"director Anurag Kashyap, Hindi cinema\u2019s high priest of darkness, turns his ferocious gaze on relationships. Obviously then, this is not the routine Bollywood meet cute. Director Anurag and writer Kanika Dhillon have created a fully realized world that is fueled by Amit Trivedi\u2019s pulsating soundtrack\" Times Of India's critic Rachit Gupta said \"The maturity with which Anurag Kashyap\u2019s Manmarziyaan talks about love and relationships is refreshing. The seemingly conventional story of a love triangle, gets original with its treatment and portrayal of love. With characters constantly oscillating between confusion and complex emotions, Manmarziyaan presents a new and updated look at romance and relationships.\" Raja Sen, writing for Hindustan Times, critiqued the film saying \"There is authenticity to the texture, but this film could have held more. It is ultimately a disappointment not because of its craft, but because of predictability, self-indulgent pace and its irritating attempt to be both a light crowd-pleaser with a cutesy ending as well as an impassioned, volatile romance.\" Filmfare movie critic Debesh Sharma adds \"Shot well by Sylvester Fonseca and edited well by Aarti Bajaj, the film scores on technical fronts as well.\" The movie received a limited international release with the title \"Husband Material\" including a premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2018. The movie received high praise for seamlessly weaving its soundtrack into the story. == Soundtrack == The soundtrack of the film has been composed by Amit Trivedi while the lyrics are written by Shellee except where noted.
