Many journalists from notable daily newspapers and magazines (namely Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb, Thanh Ni\u00ean, VnExpress, etc.) accused the producers of ill preparing, organizing the show and forcing judges play acting roles in many different types of characteristics of judging on the panel (like easy- going, humour, fantastic, etc.)\"Gi\u00e1m kh\u1ea3o c\u0169ng ph\u1ea3i di\u1ec5n\", Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb, by: Kh\u00e1nh H\u01b0ng, date: 2011-05-15. like a color commentator rather than allowing them to naturally judge the performance from contestants.\"Nh\u1ea1c s\u0129 Tr\u1ea7n Ti\u1ebfn kh\u00f4ng c\u00f2n m\u1ea1nh mi\u1ec7ng\" , ngoisao.net, by: Qu\u1ef3nh Nh\u01b0, date: 2011-05-02.

The jury were not given contracts to sign nor were they informed as to how much time they would spend on this competition. Director L\u00ea Ho\u00e0ng confirmed his involvement prior to the first week launched, but did not appear in the first week and left the following week to be replaced by musician \u0110\u1ee9c Huy.\"Nh\u1ea1c s\u0129 D\u0110\u1ee9c Huy th\u1ebf ch\u1ed7 \u0110\u1ea1o di\u1ec5n L\u00ea Ho\u00e0ng\" , ngoisao.net, by: Qu\u1ef3nh Nh\u01b0, date: 2011-04-24. ===Elimination order=== According to Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u01b0a tin, the withdrawal of V\u0129nh Th\u1ee5y was like a pre-show elimination because no one could be too fool to easily leave the highest rated show which helped them a lot to gain more fame and earn more money.B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169 c\u00f3 d\u00e0n x\u1ebfp k\u1ebft qu\u1ea3? , Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u01b0a tin, by: \u0110\u00e0o B\u00edch, date: 2011-06-08.

Ho\u00e0ng Anh, who was Huy Kh\u00e1nh's ex-wife, used Facebook note for raising a tension with the producers after he was out of the race. She also reported Kh\u00e1nh said to their kid to watch B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169 on Sunday night prior to his elimination. That seemed the producers played treat, particularly had rigged the show. Producers denied these claims as baseless stating that there was officially a company collecting and classifying messages, and the results were not be revealed by producers alone without VTV's permission. Simultaneously, they refused to give any information about how Huy Kh\u00e1nh was sent home. Under pressure, producers finally agreed to provide information about textgate and to clarify everything.\"\u0110oan Trang \u0111\u1ecdc nh\u1ea7m \u0111i\u1ec3m do ban th\u01b0 k\u00fd in sai!\" , VnMedia, date: 2011-07-07. ===Mimicking=== On week 7, Thu Minh wowed the judging panel with her exotic dance concept. Later, she came out on top of the board with two 10s for Samba. The next Monday, it was revealed that the choreography and wardrobe she wore looked amazingly similar to those of Max Kozhevnikov and Yulia Zagoruychenko in the World Super Stars Dance Festival in 2006.\"Nghi \u00e1n Thu Minh \u0111\u1ea1o \u00fd t\u01b0\u1edfng b\u00e0i nh\u1ea3y trong B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169\" , Ph\u00e1p lu\u1eadt X\u00e3 h\u1ed9i, by: Thanh Huy\u1ec1n, date: 2011-06-07.

Producers tried to help Thu Minh, claiming it was not Thu Minh's fault, that the wardrobe was made from our set of designers' ideas and gave no comment about the choreography.\"Ban t\u1ed5 ch\u1ee9c b\u00eanh v\u1ef1c Thu Minh v\u1ee5 \u0111\u1ea1o \u00fd t\u01b0\u1edfng\" , VnMedia, by: Gia Ho\u00e0ng, date: 2011-06-07. ===Conflict=== Kh\u00e1nh Thi was viewed as envious of Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean for the latter's sexy body language and her risky techniques used in performances. In press reports, she denied having any conflict with competitor Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean, resulting in unfair marks.\"Kh\u00e1nh Thi kh\u1eb3ng \u0111\u1ecbnh kh\u00f4ng x\u1eed \u00e9p Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean\" , Vietnamnet, by: Lan Ch\u00e2u, date: 2011-06-10. ===Timing violation=== Every performance should be performed in one and a half minutes according to standard practices in almost all versions Dancing with the Stars and in international competitions. The length of Thu Minh's performance was deemed the longest and the shortest performance was that of \u0110\u1ea1i Ngh\u0129a with only 1 minute 40 seconds. Thu Minh was crowned the winner.\"C\u00e1c b\u00e0i thi B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169 vi ph\u1ea1m quy t\u1eafc th\u1eddi gian\", VnExpress, by: Tuy Can, date: 2011-06-06. Once again in the week 9 and in the finale, Thu Minh and Lacho had additional performances. ===Textgate=== During week 9, there was additional controversy the week couple Anh Khoa and Iva were voted off. Some voters claimed that they could not send messages voting for Anh Khoa during textgate open, when received confirmatory text \"Vui l\u00f2ng nh\u1eafn tin b\u00ecnh ch\u1ecdn sau khi c\u00e1c th\u00ed sinh \u0111\u00e3 tham gia xong ph\u1ea7n thi c\u1ee7a m\u00ecnh. Xin ch\u00e2n th\u00e0nh c\u1ea3m \u01a1n\" (literally: \"Text after all performances done. Thank you for voting\"). It is not clear if the \"Thank you for voting\" messages were incorrectly assigned, as if the replies were incorrectly assigned, votes would have been counted for the correct contestant despite the voters receiving the wrong \"thank you\" messages.\"K\u1ebft qu\u1ea3 B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169 kh\u00f4ng minh b\u1ea1ch\" , VnMedia, by: Gia Ho\u00e0ng, date: 2011-06-28.\"S\u1ef1 th\u1eadt b\u00ecnh ch\u1ecdn SMS B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169\", Vietnamnet, by H\u1ed3 H\u01b0\u01a1ng Giang, date: 2011-07-02. All involved including the broadcaster, producers and textgate owner informed no errors during week 9 (June 26) in public press. They also revealed the out of phase of the text- gate with live audience which meant people could only text formally from 30 seconds up to a minute in normal mode after the announcement of hosts and clearly voting could be continued during short time when the gate was deemed closed. === Unfair scores === In the case of Anh Khoa and Iva, all four judges gathered for quick break for discussion about giving scores.\"'K\u1ecbch b\u1ea3n' Anh Khoa thay th\u1ebf Thu Minh?\" , Ng\u01b0\u1eddi \u0111\u01b0a tin, by: B\u00edch \u0110\u00e0o, date: 2011-07-03. They are harshly criticized for giving generous scores very sentimentally based upon the case that contestants or partners' sickness, family's bad luck, not so serious injury and so on from the very first beginning of season 1 onwards. === No live shows in Ho Chi Minh City, No international winners === In public press released for pre-production, there would exist many live shows in Ho Chi Minh City and other live shows in V\u0169ng T\u00e0u as producers informed. Later, Hanoi was offered 1-2 live shows for premiere weeks. Actually after the series ended, audience in HCMC had none show to enjoy. One of judges explained clearly bad organization and a bunch of controversies let Department of Culture, Sports and Tourisim of Ho Chi Minh City not allow the show to arrive at HCMC. Also, no winners from China Mainland, Indonesia, Finland came performing. === Finale crowning === Again and again, voting problem raised tension. Few voters affirmed that there was no message responded even 7 hours later.\"\u0110i\u1ec1u \u0111\u00e1ng ti\u1ebfc \u0111\u00eam chung k\u1ebft B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169\" , VnMedia, by: T\u00f9ng Huy, date: 2011-07-04. It is generally agreed Thu Minh deserved the win for her spectacular and outstanding Rumba and Freestyle routines engraving two highest scores to the show's history and praised by the most talented former dancing couple Kh\u00e1nh Thi and Ch\u00ed Anh. People, whereas, wondered themselves why Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean previously determined the favourite competitor of the year had fewer votes and why audience backed out at her. No official statement was made. Besides that, there was much discussion in the communication industry about the real winner because there was confusion over the crowning. Initially, \u0110oan Trang revealed the runner-up, thus the other was the winner. Trang announced 79 scored by the runner-up. Moments that turned Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean (who obviously scored 77) to the edge of glory and turned Thu Minh (who truly scored 79 out of possible 80) slightly blue was quickly stopped with the real name \"Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean\", leading everyone got shocked.\"B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169 su\u00fdt... trao nh\u1ea7m danh hi\u1ec7u v\u00f4 \u0111\u1ecbch\" , giaoduc.net.vn, by: Qu\u00e1ch Tr\u01b0\u01a1ng, date: 2011-07-04.\"S\u1ea1n trong B\u01b0\u1edbc nh\u1ea3y ho\u00e0n v\u0169 l\u00e0m Th\u1ee7y Ti\u00ean m\u1eebng h\u1ee5t\" , laodong.com.vn, by: Anh C\u01b0\u1eddng, date: 2011-07-04.
