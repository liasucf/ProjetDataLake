    "text": "La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias (literally The Lady with the Camellias, commonly known in English as Camille) is a novel by Alexandre Dumas fils, first published in 1848 and subsequently adapted by Dumas for the stage. La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias premiered at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville in Paris, France on February 2, 1852. The play was an instant success, and Giuseppe Verdi immediately set about putting the story to music. His work became the 1853 opera La traviata, with the female protagonist, Marguerite Gautier, renamed Violetta Val\u00e9ry. In the English-speaking world, La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias became known as Camille and 16 versions have been performed at Broadway theatres alone. The title character is Marguerite Gautier, who is based on Marie Duplessis, the real-life lover of author Dumas, fils. ==Summary and analysis== Marie Duplessis painted by \u00c9douard Vi\u00e9not Illustration by Albert Lynch Written by Alexandre Dumas fils (1824\u20131895) when he was 23 years old, and first published in 1848, ' is a semi-autobiographical novel based on the author's brief love affair with a courtesan, Marie Duplessis. Set in mid-19th-century France, the novel tells the tragic love story between fictional characters Marguerite Gautier, a demimondaine or courtesan suffering from consumption, and Armand Duval, a young bourgeois., Marguerite is nicknamed ' () because she wears a red camellia when she is menstruating and unavailable for making love and a white camelia when she is available to her lovers. Armand falls in love with Marguerite and ultimately becomes her lover. He convinces her to leave her life as a courtesan and to live with him in the countryside. This idyllic existence is interrupted by Armand's father, who, concerned with the scandal created by the illicit relationship, and fearful that it will destroy Armand's sister's chances of marriage, convinces Marguerite to leave. Until Marguerite's death, Armand believes that she left him for another man. Marguerite's death is described as an unending agony, during which Marguerite, abandoned by everyone, regrets what might have been. The story is narrated after Marguerite's death by two men, Armand and an unnamed frame narrator. Some scholars believe that both the fictional Marguerite's illness and real life Duplessis's publicized cause of death, \"consumption\", was a 19th-century euphemism for syphilis, as opposed to the more common meaning of tuberculosis. , is careful to paint a favourable portrait of Marguerite, who despite her past is rendered virtuous by her love for Armand, and the suffering of the two lovers, whose love is shattered by the need to conform to the morals of the times, is rendered touchingly. In contrast to the 's love for Manon in Manon Lescaut (1731), a novel by Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost referenced at the beginning of ', Armand's love is for a woman who is ready to sacrifice her riches and her lifestyle for him, but who is thwarted by the arrival of Armand's father. The novel is also marked by the description of Parisian life during the 19th century and the fragile world of the courtesan. ==Stage performances== Eug\u00e9nie Doche created the role of Marguerite Gautier in 1852 Eleonora Duse as Marguerite Gautier, late 19th century Dumas wrote a stage adaptation that premiered February 2, 1852, at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vaudeville in Paris. Eug\u00e9nie Doche created the role of Marguerite Gautier, opposite Charles Fechter as Armand Duval. \"I played the role 617 times,\" Doche recalled not long before her death in 1900, \"and I suppose I could not have played it very badly, since Dumas wrote in his preface, 'Mme. Doche is not my interpreter, she is my collaborator'.\" In 1853, Jean Davenport starred in the first United States production of the play, a sanitized version that changed the name of the leading character to Camille\u2014a practice adopted by most American actresses playing the role. The role of the tragic Marguerite Gautier became one of the most coveted amongst actresses and included performances by Sarah Bernhardt, Laura Keene, Eleonora Duse, Margaret Anglin, Gabrielle R\u00e9jane, Tallulah Bankhead, Lillian Gish, Dolores del R\u00edo, Eva Le Gallienne, Isabelle Adjani, Cacilda Becker, and Helena Modrzejewska. Bernhardt quickly became associated with the role after starring in Camellias in Paris, London, and several Broadway revivals, plus the 1911 film. Dancer/Impresario Ida Rubinstein successfully recreated Bernhardt's interpretation of the role onstage in the mid-1920s, coached by the great actress herself before she died. Of all Dumas, fils's theatrical works, La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias is the most popular around the world. In 1878 Scribner's Monthly reported that \"not one other play by Dumas, fils has been received with favor out of France\". ==Adaptations== ===Opera=== Fanny Salvini-Donatelli, the first Violetta in La traviata (1853) The success of the play inspired Giuseppe Verdi to put the story to music.

Zeffirelli first approached Hussey about starring in the film a few weeks after the premiere of Romeo and Juliet (1968). He sent her a copy of the original book with a note that said \u201cYou are my Marguerite Gautier\u201d. The two year long publicity tour for Romeo and Juliet (1968), stalled the project as Hussey and Zeffirelli traveled the world to promote the film. After the tour, Zeffirelli had trouble finding finances and a studio for the project. Meanwhile, Hussey starred in All The Right Noises (1971), got out of an abusive relationship with Christopher Jones, and later married Dean Paul Martin in 1971. In 1972, Zeffirelli directed the film, Brother Sun Sister Moon (1972), which failed to live up to the success of Romeo and Juliet (1968), and prevented him from finding a studio to pick his proposal for Camille. Hussey, believing that the film was off, starred in Summertime Killer (1972) and Lost Horizon (1973), and had her first child in February of 1973. Zeffirelli tried one last time to get the film picked up in late 1973, but this time without Hussey. Given the overwhelming negative reception of Hussey\u2019s recent film, Lost Horizon, she wasn\u2019t seen as the same box office draw as she was a few years earlier. Unbeknownst to Hussey, Zeffirelli recruited recent Oscar winner (and best friend to Hussey), Liza Minnelli, for the role of Marguerite Gautier. Even with Minnelli\u2019s Oscar winning name attached to the proposal, no studio showed interest in the project. For blindsiding her, Hussey\u2019s relationship with Zeffirelli and Minnelli tumbled for sometime (particularly with Liza). Olivia said of the situation \u201cI was stunned. Liza and I would often talk about work, and I had told her how excited I was to play Marguerite Gautier. How it was the role of a lifetime, and how Franco would bring it to life. I had said that he was a genius and I loved him and that he was adapting the work with me in mind. It was like I was handing it to her, the way I described it. I felt betrayed. I understood that having an Oscar-winning name like Liza\u2019s attached would help Franco get the picture made. Directors, in my experience, will do anything to get a project off the ground, and I really couldn\u2019t blame him (although in my heart I did). But Liza? How could she go behind my back like that? She wouldn\u2019t even have known about Camille if I hadn\u2019t talked it up.\u201d Franco Zeffirelli\u2019s vision of Camille ultimately never came to fruition. Olivia would later rekindle her relationship with Franco, and even reunited with him for the film Jesus of Nazareth a few years later. On the other hand, her relationship with Minnelli didn\u2019t have the same mending. Hussey recalled \u201cshe called from Rome to apologize and smooth things over. It was big of her, but I found myself being nasty, telling her that Franco must be thinking of doing the film as a comedy if he were willing to cast her in the role. It was a terrible thing to say, and I felt awful afterward, but I was hurt and angry...Liza and I did find our way back to being friends, although it was never quite the same.\u201d ===Ballet=== * Lady of the Camellias is a ballet by John Neumeier with music by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin, created for Marcia Hayd\u00e9e, then prima ballerina of the Stuttgart Ballet. It premiered at the Staatstheater Stuttgart in 1978. * Lady of the Camellias is a ballet by Val Caniparoli with music by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. It premiered with Ballet Florida at the Raymond Kravis Center in 1994. * Marguerite and Armand is an adaptation created in 1963 by renowned choreographer Sir Frederick Ashton specifically for Rudolf Nureyev and prima ballerina assoluta Dame Margot Fonteyn. * Veronica Paeper created a ballet Camille based on The Lady of the Camellias which has been staged several times since 1990. ===Stage=== Amongst many adaptations, spin- offs, and parodies, was Camille, \"a travesty on La Dame aux Camellias by Charles Ludlam, staged first by his own Ridiculous Theatrical Company in 1973, with Ludlam playing the lead in drag. In 1999 Alexia Vassiliou collaborated with composer Aristides Mytaras for the contemporary dance performance, La Dame aux Cam\u00e9lias at the Amore Theatre in Athens. It is also the inspiration for the 2008 musical Marguerite, which places the story in 1944 German- occupied France. ===Novels=== In My \u00c1ntonia by Willa Cather, the characters Jim Burden and Lena Lingard are much moved by a theatrical production of Camille, which they attend in book 3, chapter 3. Love Story, published by Eric Segal in 1970, has essentially the same plot updated to contemporary New York. The conflict here centres on the relative economic classes of the central characters. ==References== ==External links== * Full texts at Project Gutenberg in the original French and in an English translation *1953 Best Plays radio adaptation of play at Internet Archive Category:1848 French novels Category:1852 plays Category:French novels adapted into films Category:Novels adapted into television shows Category:French novels adapted into plays Category:Novels adapted into operas Category:Novels adapted into ballets Category:French romance novels Category:Novels about French prostitution Category:Novels set in Paris Category:Novels by Alexandre Dumas fils Category:Female characters in literature ",
