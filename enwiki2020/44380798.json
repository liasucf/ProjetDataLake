Its function is to organize 2D animated vector graphics into a playable video game without extensive coding. == History == In 2010, Ubisoft announced Rayman Origins, first an episodic video game designed by Michel Ancel and developed by a small team of five people, but it was announced that it transformed into a full game. The title uses the UbiArt Framework developed by Ubisoft Montpellier and Ancel. UbiArt is a developer platform that allows artists and animators to easily create content and use it in an interactive environment.How do you create an animation in UBIart Framework?, UBIart The engine is optimized for HD resolutions and is capable of running games at 60 frames per second in resolutions exceeding 1080p. Ancel has expressed his desire for the framework to be available for anybody to develop games with. However, no public release or licensing option has been made available. On April 9, 2019 in an interview with IGN, Yves explained why the engine was not being used as initially planned and explains that the \"tools were difficult to use\". The plan was to distribute the engine to other studios with Guillemot saying \"at one point we wanted to give them to everybody [in Ubisoft].\u201d However, they decided not to as they wanted to \u201cspend a lot of time with a lot of people to actually help people to use it.\u201d But the engine is not abandoned as Guillemot explained \u201cIt\u2019s still there, and you will see other things using it, but it\u2019s not as predominant as it used to be\u201d, meaning the engine hasn't been forgotten. ==Games developed by UbiArt Framework== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! colspan=\"15\" | Platform(s) |- ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | PS3 ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | PSVita ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | PS4 ! style=\"width:3em; font- size:90%\" | Wii ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | 3DS ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | Wii U ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | NS ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | Win ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | X360 ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | XONE ! style=\"width:3em; font- size:90%\" | IOS ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | Android ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | OS X ! style=\"width:3em; font-size:90%\" | tvOS |- | 2011 | Rayman Origins | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- |2011 | Rayman: Slap, Flap and Go! | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2012 | Rayman Jungle Run | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2013 | Rayman Legends Challenge App | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2013 | Rayman Legends | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2013 | Rayman Fiesta Run | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2014 | Child of Light | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2014 |Valiant Hearts: The Great War | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2015 | Gravity Falls: Legend of the Gnome Gemulets | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2015 |Rayman Adventures | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | 2019 |Rayman Mini | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |} ==References== Category:Ubisoft Category:Video game engines ",
