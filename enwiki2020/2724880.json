It is found growing in the campos rupestres (rocky fields) montane savanna ecoregion of the Atlantic Forest biome. It grows in rocky shady places such as amongst shrubs, or near cliffs and rocks. ==Description== Leocereus bahiensis has stems that are long, thing and almost terete. A full adult plant can grow up to 2 meters in length and about 1.5 cm in diameter.

The areoles are close together and circular. The Leocereus bahiensis has fruit 10 to 12 mm with seeds about 1.5 mm long. ;Conservation Leocereus bahiensis are being affected by habitat loss, though it has a wide range. The eastern range of the plant is generally regarded as ending up in an area that is not ideal for agricultural growth. The major threat to habitat loss that happens within numerous national parks (Parque Nacional da Chapada Diamantina, Parque Estadual de Morro Chapeu, Parque Nacional Boqueir\u00e3o da On\u00e7a and Parque Nacional do Rio Parnaiba) is due to industrialization. The western area of its range is most affected by industrial-scale agriculture of soy, Eucalyptus and cotton. ==Uses== This plant is one of the few cacti that contain caffeine and mescaline. Mescaline is a psychedelic drug that is produced by some cacti and also called peyote. Leocereus bahiensis was not confirmed part of the genus Leocereus until 2012 ==References== Category:Trichocereeae Category:Cacti of South America Category:Endemic flora of Brazil Category:Flora of Bahia Category:Flora of Atlantic Forest (biome) Category:Cactoideae genera Category:Monotypic Cactaceae genera ",
