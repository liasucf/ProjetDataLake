    "text": "Ali Pangalian M. Balindong (born January 1, 1940) is a Filipino lawyer and politician. He is the current Speaker of the Bangsamoro Parliament. He is also a former Deputy Speaker of the Philippine House of Representatives and a member of the 1971 Philippine Constitutional Convention. == Early life == Born in Pualas, Lanao del Sur on January 1, 1940, Balindong is the eldest son of Sultan Amer Macaorao Balindong, former mayor of the Municipality of Malabang, and Hajjatu Maimona Marohom Balindong. He studied at the Malabang Central Elementary School and graduated in 1954. He then went to Our Lady of Peace High School and graduated in 1958. He took up Bachelor of Arts Major in Political Science at the Manuel L. Quezon University and graduated in 1962. He studied law at the same university and graduated in 1966 with a Bachelor of Laws degree(LL.B.). He pursued further studies later and earned his Master of Public Administration degree from Mindanao State University. ==Career == Balindong engaged in private legal practice and served as legal counsel for the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) which works for peace initiatives with the government. In 1971, he joined the Philippine Constitutional Convention representing the Lone District of Lanao del Sur. He started his political career when he held the post of Assemblyman from 1990 to 1993 representing the 2nd District of Lanao del Sur and was elected as Speaker of the Regional Legislative Assemblyman of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) between 1991 and 1993. In 1995, he ran and was elected as the congressional representative of the 2nd District of Lanao del Sur during the 10th Congress. He ran again in 2007 and became a member of the 14th, 15th, and 16th Congresses of the House of Representatives. In 2013, he rose to the Deputy Speaker post of the House of Representatives until 2016. In 2018, under Executive Order 10, Balindong was appointed by President Rodrigo Duterte as a member of the 25-member Consultative Committee to Review the 1987 Philippine Constitution. A committee composed of former government officials, veteran lawyers, and academicians which were tasked by the President to craft a Federal constitution. ==Key legislation== === Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL) === For most of his political life, Balindong advocated the age-old quest for self-determination of the Filipino-Muslims in Mindanao. He introduced and authored the Bangsamoro Basic Law (BBL), which was later renamed the Bangsamoro Organic Law (BOL), in the 16th Congress. During a privilege speech, he stated that he has always believed that this is essential in ushering unity in Mindanao and the entire country, where Filipino Muslims, Christians, Lumads, and virtually all sectors of the Filipino society could live in harmony, peace, and inclusive prosperity. This to him will mark the end of the 400-year struggle for independence and at the same guarantee every Muslim's right to life, property, and prosperity. Under succeeding president Rodrigo R. Duterte. The BOL was ratified by the Philippine Senate on July 23, 2018, and House of Representatives on July 24, 2018, and signed into law by President Duterte on July 26, 2018, establishing the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao. === The Moro History, Culture and Identity Studies Act === House Bill No. 4832 or \u201cThe Moro History, Culture and Identity Studies Act\u201d which mandates the teaching of Moro history, culture, and identity in the higher education curriculum in the entire country. This bill has already passed the House of Representatives. Balindong sees the need to highlight the ethnicity, shared origins or commonalities between Muslims and non-Muslims in order to foster respect and positive relationships between minority and majority groups. He said, \u201cWhile Filipino and Muslim cultures may have differences, it is a fact that they are bound by a common heritage, the land they call the Philippines, and they have a lot in common, on top of which, is the clamor for peace.\u201d Though Filipino and Muslim cultures have differences, peace is attainable through understanding, respect, and tolerance for cultural and religious diversities. === National Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act === Another vital legislative initiative Balindong sponsored is the Republic Act No 9997, also known as the \u201cNational Commission on Muslim Filipinos Act of 2009\u201d which was enacted into law on February 8, 2010. This act created the National Commission on Muslim Filipinos (NCMF) headed by The Commission, mandated to preserve and develop the culture, tradition, institutions, and well-being of Muslim Filipinos in conformity with the country's laws and in consonance with national unity and development. === House Bill No. 1447 === Balindong filed and lobbied for House Bill No. 1447, which prohibits the use of the words \u201cMuslim\u201d or \u201cChristian\u201d in mass media to describe any person suspected of or convicted for committing criminal or unlawful actions. He argued if the media puts labels on suspects and convicted criminals regarding their nationality, ethnicity, and religious affiliation it fosters negative bias to people who shares their affiliation, affecting the collective image of such groups. He cites that there is negative reception whenever other countries branded a housemaid as Pinay for the simple reason that there are so many Filipino women workers working as maids. \u201cWhy then is our media doing the same to our Muslim countrymen? Indeed, our Muslim brothers are a minority among the Filipino majority, but should be treated with the same respect and privileges as any other Batangue\u00f1o, Visayan or other Filipino citizens.\u201d === Synchronized National and Local Elections Act === This Act synchronizes ARMM elections with the national elections which started with the 2013 elections. == Principles and Ideals == In one of his privilege speeches he said, \u201cIf some sector of society stands in the way of peace and progress, something must be done to make them toe the line. Being at odds with one another is not contributing to progress despite the claim of economic gains brought about by the appreciation of the Peso.\u201d He added that whatever it is that something must be given, it must be sincere so that there would be no need to go back every now and then to the negotiating table, thus, there will no longer have reason to fight each other again. \u201cUnity must not be dictated. The unity needed must come from the Moro, and not dictated by somebody else but by the events of the day.\u201d Balindong believes in the power of elixir of eternal youth, and that is found in obedience to the principles of the Qur'an and love of service. When he decided to run for the Provincial Governor position, he looked at it not as a personal or political ambition, but an extension of his desire to continue serving the people and his beloved Philippines. To him, public service is not as a job or work; it is a way of life. Balindong, having gone through the crucibles of life, both personal and professional, acknowledges that experience is the best teacher of life. With such principles, he deserves without a doubt to continue serving the people and will continue to serve in whatever capacity he can. When the BBL failed to pass into law, Balindong lamented it because the next generation will inherit the vicious cycle of war and peace and all efforts, public hearings, and debates were all thrown into the wastebasket. ==References== Category:1940 births Category:People from Lanao del Sur Category:Members of the Bangsamoro Transition Authority Parliament Category:Members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines from Lanao del Sur Category:Living people Category:Filipino Muslims ",
