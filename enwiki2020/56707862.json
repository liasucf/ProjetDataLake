Erected in the early 1700s during the rule of the Gonds, Hammam-e-Qadimi was gifted to Hajjam Hammu Khalida when Dost Mohammad Khan became Nawab of the city. The Indo-Turkish bath is owned by a descendant of Hajjam Hammu Khalida, Mohammad Sajid, and has been kept in his family for five generations. The oil used for the massages offered in Hammam-e-Qadimi is a special recipe of Sajid's family. Hammam-e-Qadimi was built in the style of the \u00c7emberlita\u015f Hamam\u0131 of Istanbul and was constructed near a mosque so that individuals visiting the mosque may perform their ablutions before going there to pray.
