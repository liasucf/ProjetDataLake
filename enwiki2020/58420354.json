    "text": "The 2018\u201319 FA Women's National League Plate is the fifth running of the competition, which began in 2014. It is the secondary League Cup competition run by the FA Women's National League (FA WNL), and is run in parallel with the league's primary League Cup competition, the National League Cup. The teams that take part in the WNL plate are decided after the determining round of the WNL Cup. The winners of determining round matches continue in the WNL Cup, while the losers move into the WNL Plate. All 72 National League clubs were included in the determining round draw. St Nicholas withdrew from the competition before playing a match, meaning 36 teams progressed in the Cup and 35 were entered in the Plate. West Ham United were the reigning champions, having defeated Luton Town 5\u20130 in the 2017\u201318 final, but did not defend their title after obtaining a licence to the FA Women's Super League. ==Results== All results listed are published by The Football Association. Games are listed by round in chronological order, and then in alphabetical order of the home team where matches were played simultaneously.
