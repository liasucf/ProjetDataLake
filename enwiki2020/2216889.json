The title track (two performances) and \"Ode to Lady Day\" are splendid performances\" In his review on AllMusic, Scott Yanow states \"The inside/outside music rewards repeated listenings, and the Lacy/Tyler match-up, helped by their contrasting but complementary styles, works quite well\". == Track listing == All compositions by Steve Lacy except where noted. # \"One Fell Swoop\" \u2013 7:52 # \"Ode to Lady Day\" (Charles Tyler) \u2013 7:34 # \"Wickets\" \u2013 9:46 # \"Keepsake\" \u2013 8:44 # \"The Adventures Of\" (Tyler) \u2013 7:17 # \"Friday the 13th\" (Thelonious Monk) \u2013 4:53 # \"One Fell Swoop\" [Take 2] \u2013 7:07 Bonus track on CD == Personnel == *Steve Lacy \u2013 soprano saxophone *Charles Tyler \u2013 baritone saxophone, alto saxophone *Jean-Jacques Avenel \u2013 bass *Oliver Johnson \u2013 drums == References == Category:Steve Lacy (saxophonist) albums Category:1987 albums Category:Silkheart Records albums ",
