    "text": "The Tokayev Cabinet was the 4th government of Kazakhstan under the leadership of Kassym-Jomart Tokayev. It was formed shortly after Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev resigned from his post on 1 October 1999 shortly before the legislative election to become the president of Kazakhoil. President Nursultan Nazarbayev named Kassym-Jomart Tokayev as the Acting Prime Minister, who, prior to that, served as the Deputy Prime Minister as well as the Minister of Foreign Affairs under Balgimbayev's cabinet. On 12 October, the Parliament approved Tokayev's nomination to the post of the PM. On 20 November 2001, Prime Minister Tokayev threatened to resign if Nazarbayev would not dismiss several government officials who formed Democratic Choice of Kazakhstan (QDT) as he accused of them of working for the \"outsiders\", which sparked a political crisis. In December 2001, Nazarbayev removed several cabinet members such as Deputy Prime Minister Oraz Jandosov and Deputy Defense Minister Jannat Ertlesova. On 28 January 2002, Tokayev himself resigned stating that \"it was time for new people with new ideas\" without further explanations. That same day, he was appointed as the State Secretary of Kazakhstan, while his successor, Imangali Tasmagambetov, became the new Prime Minister. == Composition == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Functions ! colspan=\"2\" |Holder !Start !End |- |Prime Minister |130x130px |Kassym-Jomart Tokayev |12 October 1999 |28 January 2002 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |First Deputy Prime Minister | |Aleksandr Pavlov |12 October 1999 |November 2000 |- |126x126px |Daniyal Akhmetov |21 December 2000 |21 November 2001 |- |Deputy Prime Minister | |Erik Otembaev |October 1999 |December 2000 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |126x126px |Daniyal Akhmetov |October 1999 |December 2000 |- |Deputy Prime Minister | |Oraz Jandosov |December 2000 |November 2001 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |128x128px |Imangali Tasmagambetov |December 2000 |January 2002 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |133x133px |Vladimir Shkolnik |December 2000 |January 2002 |- |Deputy Prime Minister |137x137px |Karim Massimov |27 November 2001 |June 2003 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Prime Minister's Office |137x137px |Kanat Saudabayev |13 October 1999 |13 December 2000 |- | |Altai Tleuberdin |13 December 2000 |10 January 2007 |- |Ministry of Foreign Affairs |112x112px |Erlan Idrissov |12 October 1999 |29 January 2002 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Defense | |Sat Tokpakbaev |13 October 1999 |8 December 2001 |- |145x145px |Mukhtar Altynbayev |8 December 2001 |10 January 2007 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Ministry of Internal Affairs | |Kairbek Suleimenov |October 1995 |December 2000 |- | |Bulat Iskakov |December 2000 |January 2002 |- | |Kairbek Suleimenov |January 2002 |12 September 2003 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Agriculture | |Sauat Mynbayev |July 1999 |May 2001 |- |146x146px |Akhmetzhan Yessimov |18 May 2001 |14 May 2004 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Justice |129x129px |Bauyrzhan Mukhamedzhanov |October 1997 |September 2000 |- |142x142px |Igor Rogov |13 September 2000 |29 January 2002 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Education and Science |117x117px |Krymbek Kusherbayev |October 1999 |18 December 2000 |- | |Nuraly Bekturganov |18 December 2000 |January 2002 |- |Ministry of Healthcare | |Jaqsylyq Doskaliev |17 October 2001 |4 April 2004 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Ministry of Labour and Social Protection of the Population | |Nikolai Radostovets |October 1999 |August 2000 |- |127x127px |Alikhan Baimenov |August 2000 |November 2001 |- | |Gulzhan Karagusova |22 November 2001 |12 July 2007 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Ministry of Transport and Communications | |Serik Burkitbaev |September 1998 |August 2000 |- |137x137px |Karim Massimov |7 August 2000 |27 November 2001 |- | |Ablai Myrzahmetov |November 2001 |April 2002 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Culture, Information and Public Accord |141x141px |Altynbek Sarsenbayuly |January 1999 |May 2001 |- |131x131px |Mukhtar Kul- Mukhammed |4 May 2001 |13 September 2003 |- |Ministry of Finance | |Aleksandr Pavlov |29 January 2002 |27 August 2002 |- |Ministry of Economy | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" |Zhaksybek Kulekeyev |13 October 1999 |December 2000 |- |Ministry of Economy and Trade |December 2000 |January 2002 |- |Ministry of Energy, Industry and Trade | rowspan=\"2\" | | rowspan=\"2\" |Vladimir Shkolnik |October 1999 |13 December 1999 |- |Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources |13 December 1999 |19 January 2006 |- | rowspan=\"2\" |Ministry of Natural Resources and Environmental Protection | |Serikbek Daukeev |22 January 1999 |22 December 2000 |- | |Andar Shoqpytov |22 December 2000 |August 2000 |} == References == Category:Cabinets of Kazakhstan Category:1999 in Kazakhstan Category:Cabinets established in 1999 Category:1999 establishments in Kazakhstan ",
