    "text": "Sir Philip Antony Fyson Buck (19 December 1928 \u2013 6 October 2003) was a British Conservative politician. ==Early life and career== The son of Arthur F. Buck, a farmer and agricultural merchant, and his wife Laura (n\u00e9e Fyson), a founder member of the Royal College of Nursing,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1443831/Sir-Antony- Buck.htmlhttps://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/oct/11/guardianobituaries.conservatives Buck was born in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire. He was educated at The King's School, Ely and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where he studied Law and History and was the chairman of the Cambridge University Conservative Association as the successor to Geoffrey Howe. He then trained as a barrister and was called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1954, becoming a prominent criminal lawyer and a Queen's Counsel in 1974. ==Political career== He was elected MP for Colchester in a 1961 by-election. A strong supporter of the modernising Conservatism championed by Edward Heath, Buck served as the Under-Secretary for Defence from 1972 to 1974 with responsibility for the Royal Navy,Sir Antony Buck obituary, The Times, 11 October 2003; accessed 30 May 2014. but his fortunes declined when Heath lost the election in 1974, and he managed the unsuccessful leadership campaign for his old friend Geoffrey Howe. Buck then lost his place on the executive of the 1922 Committee, although he later regained it. Nevertheless, he remained a perceptive observer of defence policy, opposing the closure of Colchester's military hospital and other cuts. He was also chairman of the Parliamentary Ombudsman Committee. He was held in high regard by his constituency party and continued to serve as the MP for Colchester until 1983 when he became MP for Colchester North after boundary changes. He retired from parliament in 1992. ==Marriages== Buck married three times. His daughter Louisa from his 34-year first marriage to Judy Grant is an art critic. In 1994 tabloid newspaper reports of a relationship between his second wife, Bienvenida (n\u00e9e Perez-Blanco), and Air Chief Marshal Sir Peter Harding were followed by Harding's resignation as Chief of the Defence Staff. His third wife was Russian born Tamara Norashkaryan. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1928 births Category:2003 deaths Category:People from Cambridge Category:Knights Bachelor Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979 Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983 Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987 Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992 Category:Queen's Counsel 1901\u20132000 Category:Members of the Inner Temple Category:Politics of Colchester Category:People educated at The King's School, Ely Category:Alumni of Trinity Hall, Cambridge Category:Politicians awarded knighthoods ",
