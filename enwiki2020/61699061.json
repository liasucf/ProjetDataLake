It was a reboot of popular show Ekhane Aakash Neel (2008-2010). Produced by Surinder Films, it starred Sean Banerjee and Anamika Chakraborty in lead roles. It ended on 3rd October, 2020 amidst several rebellions for ending on such short notice despite being so popular. == Plot == The story started with two characters absolutely opposite in nature. Dr Ujaan Chatterjee; one of the best five heart surgeons in the world, with an attitude at its worse and an extreme workaholic, in short, he had no emotions and did not believe in love. Here comes Hiya Mitra, an aspiring doctor, a girl with a bubbly personality whose heart was filled with compassion to the brim. She took decisions not with her head, but with her heart. Initially, Hiya came to Kolkata to get admitted in the best medical college to get her degree, however unable to pay the high fees, she returned to her village,still passionate to help people.This medical college was a part of Tulip Hospital owned by Ujaan's father, Dr Samaresh Chatterjee. At a health camp in Hiya's village, Hiya encountered Dr Samaresh Chatterjee who had an age old knee pain which Hiya volunteered to cure with her Ayurvedic treatment. Interested by Hiya's enthusiasm, Dr Chatterjee invited her to his home in Kolkata for his treatment. Here, Hiya is absolutely delighted to meet Dr Ujaan Chatterjee and immediately idolises him and considers him to be her 'Guru' or greatest teacher. Ujaan on the contrary, is disgusted to encounter such a talkative, interfering girl. After a series of events, Ujaan and Hiya come close and it seemed as if they were destined to be together. However, Ujaan refuses to succumb to this truth as his mother, Basobi Chatterjee had been abandoned by his father and had remarried Minakshi, and Ujaan had had to live in his own house with the identity of his father's adopted child. This pained Ujaan to a great extent but he never exposed his feelings. Hiya became aware of this and tried to bring back his mother. Just as everything was coming together well and Ujaan was ready to express his true feelings for Hiya, she left him saying that she had never loved him. However, the truth was that she had a heart disease which could not be cured and she knew that Ujaan would not be able to bear this news. Ujaan was heartbroken. At this time, Jhinuk Sen enters Tulip Hospital. She had a psychologically challenged,abusive fiance and had escaped from his clutches along with her fianc\u00e9's daughter Oli, from his first wife. Ujaan develops a bond with Oli and he after knowing about her father's abusive nature, he enters into a fake marriage arrangement with Jhinuk Sen for six months so as to protect Oli. Then, destiny plays a part and Hiya again encounters Ujaan at Tulip in spite of trying hard not to meet him.They get married and Ujaan successfully operates Hiya and cures her of her heart disease. A few days later, they reveal their marriage to everyone while Ujaan's younger step brother Bihaan kills Dr. Jhinuk Sen whom he had drugged to kill Hiya. Bihaan gets arrested along with Minakshi who had made several attempts in the past to harm Hiya. Nilima, who had earlier intended to marry Ujaan and had tried to destroy Hiya and Ujaan's relationship, becomes friendly. A few years later Hiya became a doctor at Tulip Hospital.
