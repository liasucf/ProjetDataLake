It was first described from the Melones and Stanislaus mine in Calaveras County, California in 1866, by Frederick Augustus Genth. Melonite occurs as trigonal crystals, which cleave in a (0001) direction. It has a specific gravity of 7.72 and a hardness of 1\u20131.5 (very soft). ==See also== * List of minerals * Tenifer and Melonite finish ==References== * D. M. Chizhikov and V. P.
