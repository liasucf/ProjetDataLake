He is primarily remembered as one of the Eight Witnesses of the Book of Mormon's golden plates. ==Biography== Born in Fayette, New York, Whitmer and several of his brothers were shown the gold plates by Joseph Smith in 1829. Whitmer was one of the official six members of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830.Joseph Smith (B. H. Roberts (ed.), History of the Church 1:76, footnote. Shortly thereafter, Whitmer was called to travel with Oliver Cowdery, Parley P. Pratt and Ziba Peterson on a special mission to preach the faith to the Native Americans. This mission led to the conversion of former Campbellite minister Sidney Rigdon. Whitmer subsequently moved to Jackson County, Missouri, where he married Vashti Higley on October 14, 1832, with whom he had three children. By 1835, Whitmer and his family had relocated to the new Latter Day Saint settlement of Far West, Missouri, where he sat on the church's high council. He was almost 27 years old when he died of tuberculosis in Liberty, Missouri. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:1809 births Category:1836 deaths Category:American Latter Day Saints Category:Book of Mormon witnesses Category:Converts to Mormonism Category:19th-century deaths from tuberculosis Category:Tuberculosis deaths in Missouri Category:American Latter Day Saint missionaries Category:People from Fayette, New York Category:Whitmer family Category:Doctrine and Covenants people Category:Leaders in the Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints) Category:Religious leaders from New York (state) ",
