The organization currently offers a social entrepreneurship course called the Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) Forum in addition to higher learning honorary degrees in entrepreneurship, economic science, and sustainability science. ==History== iuventum was founded in 2009 as a charitable organization and incorporated in Germany and the US.

Participants are required to go through five subject areas in the course, covering topics such as sustainability, leadership, and entrepreneurship and then submit four graded assignments in order to receive an ESD certificate. ===Higher Learning Honorary Degrees=== The honorary degrees B.Phil.
