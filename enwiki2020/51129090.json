    "text": "Cameron's Books and Magazines (or simply Cameron's) is Portland, Oregon's oldest bookstore. Established in 1938, Cameron's boasts a periodical inventory estimated at nearly 100,000 volumes, the shop has become one of the largest vintage magazine dealers in the United States. The store was slated to close in November 2019. However, a successful crowdfunding campaign allowed a longtime employee to purchase the business and continue operations within the same space. ==History== ===Bob Cameron=== The shop\u2019s founding owner/operator and namesake Robert Edmond \u201cBob\u201d Cameron, a graduate of Franklin High School, attended Albany College before finding work with the Multnomah County Library. A devoted philatelist, he\u2019d long hoped to become a stamp dealer, and, in 1930 at the age of 22, he launched the Cameron Stamp Company inside El Ray\u2019s bookstore on downtown Portland\u2019s SW Park Avenue between Yamhill and Taylor, where Director Park currently sits. As clients and personal acquaintances began bringing Cameron other items to sell, Cameron recognized that used books represented his greatest source of revenue. Eight years later, the first iteration of his eponymous bookstore would open. Cameron\u2019s would relocate seven times, occasionally changing names along the way. By 1956, the shop had moved to 825 SW 3rd Avenue, and, in 1964, it finally found a permanent residence in 1964 on the corner of SW 3rd Avenue and Stark_Street, now known as SW Harvey Milk Street. Their trademark (and long-broken) neon signage first appeared in 1984. A large campaign poster for Wayne Morse, the controversial US Senator from Oregon, has been hanging above their counter since the Vietnam era. Otherwise, as a 2009 Oregonian story about the \u201cPortland institution\u201d stressed, \u201cnot much has changed since. The aisles can be cramped, and the shelves are loaded. But that\u2019s part of the charm.\u201d Stamps remained a lifelong passion of Cameron\u2019s founder. He ensured the bookstore always stocked them and continued to work in the field through his 1977 retirement. Furthermore, he maintained regular shifts as clerk, manning the register for one hour each day until his death 11 years later. In a 1972 Northwest Magazine piece, which suggested Cameron\u2019s was Portland\u2019s only store to freely offer customers paper shopping bags with handles, its proprietor was described as \u201cthe bookish- looking fellow who appears younger than his 64 years, the one with glasses, pipe, and the dried-pea green cardigan \u2026 his placid mien and barely audible speech in complete contrast to the hubub around him.\u201d ===Fred Goetz=== In 1976, at the age of 58, Frederick James Goetz assumed ownership of Cameron\u2019s. After an early stint as Baltimore Sun copy boy and occasional gofer for H. L. Mencken, Goetz served in the Merchant Marine during World War II. After settling in Portland, he originated the popular weekly \"Outdoor Scene\" column for an early incarnation of the NW Labor Press in 1955, which soon spread his byline through about three dozen union-oriented publications across the country. Taking into account his freelance artticles for such national glossies as Sports Afield and Field & Stream, an NWLP obituary estimated that Goetz reached around 12 million headers at his height as \u201cthe most widely- circulated outdoor writer in the United States.\u201d Perhaps because of this experience, Goetz chose to expand the shop\u2019s repertoire beyond books and stamps. Cameron\u2019s had never sold periodicals until then, and a 1985 Oregonian article surmised \u201cthat introduction to journalism and magazines in particular\u201d instilled the former columnist\u2019s \u201clifelong love affair with periodicals.\u201d According to a Virginia Quarterly Review profile of the store\u2019s third owner Jeff Frase, however, they were added simply to \u201cdiversify stock and add another revenue stream.\u201d As Frase told the VQR, there \u201cjust seemed to be a market that no one else was dealing with locally at the time.\u201d In any event, within his \u2018secret library\u2019 behind the Employees Only sign, Goetz compiled vast troves, including the first issues of more than 250 separate magazines. As his collection mushroomed with volumes brought by walk-ins or plucked from estate sales, the owner constructed a labyrinthine vault inside the storage area where rickety stairs head up to a catwalk-bisected mezzanine whose walls have been stacked floor to ceiling with vintage media. A narrow passageway lined with lurid paperback novels leads to a small attic with, as the Oregonian wrote, \u201ca carefully catalogued library\u201d holding \u201c70 years of The Saturday Evening Post ... Collier's, Look, Esquire, Popular Science, Popular Mechanics, Arizona Highways, Liberty, National Geographic \u2013 magazines covering everything from fashion and cooking to natural sciences and engineering.\u201d Marveling at their breadth of adult material, Willamette Week\u2019s survey of their \u201cimpeccably curated magazine bank\u201d noted \u201cthe Playboy archive bleeds into a jaw-dropping glimpse into the evolving American male hive mind as the 1950s' swinging photographer (Sunbather, Pose) turned '60s lothario (Escapade, Ace), '70s rocker (Adam, The Dude) and '80s perv weekender (Nugget).\u201d ===Jeff Frase=== In 1982, Goetz brought on a 30-year-old Jeffery Frase as part-time assistant charged with helming the intricate filing system. While laid off from an apartment maintenance job, he\u2019d been filling in for the vacationing proprietor of the Sellwood neighborhood bookshop King of Rome, who recommended him to Goetz, and, by the next year, Frase had been promoted to manager. With help from a familial loan, he took full ownership in 1989. \"I was trying out all kinds of little stores like this,\" Frase told the Oregonian. \"It could've been a record store. It just so happened Cameron's was hiring.\" Situated on a block whose northern bookend, the Portland Outdoor Store, has been in business since 1919, Cameron\u2019s managed to weather its share of dry spells, but changing economic climes had especially ravaged 21st century independent bookstores. By 2011, used magazines represented 40% of store sales. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough market,\u201d Frase told the Oregonian. \"The big chains came in, then the online sales, and now electronic readers. Those are three big hits.\u201d Still, they maintained a steady clientele of walk-ins and downtown office-workers, and, when work on downtown Portland\u2019s Transit Mall redirected bus service down 3rd Avenue from 2007 through 2009, the new influx of bored commuters browsing through spinner racks helped see the shop through the Great Recession. In addition, longtime employee Crystal Zingsheim had long sought to cultivate a digital marketplace that would allow a national consumer base to virtually browse the shop\u2019s singular cache of rarities. Though at first hesitant about cultivating Cameron's internet presence, Frase eventually began opening the shop's inventory to e-commerce through such websites as AbeBooks and Biblio.com. \u201cWe broke down,\u201d he admitted, but \"listing our products online helped out sales.\u201d (Even past owner Fred Goetz had launched his own e-bookshop midst retirement as means of hawking book-fair finds before his 2002 death.) Their periodical archive had also begun attracting a new clientele of graphic designers, social researchers, machinists, and representatives of advertising agencies and academic institutions. Similiarly, the vintage magazines were prized by film and television crews seeking authenticity for period pieces. \"When productions around the country need otherwise unavailable periodicals as set props or reference material,\u201d Zingsheim told Willamette Week, \u201cthe filmmakers send us an order specifying time period, historical context, and the mood of the scene they want to develop, and we pull the matching documents from our collection.\" ===Threatened Closure=== The store's exterior, 2017 For more than sixty years, the retail space currently housing Cameron\u2019s had been owned by the bookstore\u2019s upstairs neighbors \u2013 the Golden Dragon Restaurant. Beginning in 2008, famed PDX gay bar Silverado would lease the premises for another decade before 18+ adult lounge Golden Dragon Exotic Club opened inside the former Chinese buffet\u2019s location. In 2018, the strip club\u2019s ownership group Jdsy 3rd Street LLC purchased the entire building for $3 million. The outgoing landords contractually stipulated that all tenants would continue to pay the same rental costs for one year without increase, and, with that grace period set to expire, then-owner Jeff Frase received a surprise notice to vacate the premises by December 1st 2019. \u201cI kept expecting to hear from them about what was going to happen,\u201d he told KOIN News, \u201cand, instead of making me an offer to see whether I can stay, they just \u2026 refused to renew the lease.\u201d Faced with a de facto eviction notice, the 67-year-old Frase had originally planned to retire and shutter the bookstore before one of his employees broached the crowdfunding strategy. Crystal Zingsheim, who\u2019d learned the rare book trade through a young apprenticeship with her father\u2019s San Jose business, had worked with Frase for almost 20 years and hoped to take over the business following his retirement. \u201cI want to keep Cameron\u2019s alive,\u201d she said to the Oregonian about becoming the bookstore\u2019s fourth owner. \u201cIt\u2019s not about me or Jeff. We are simply caretakers of a legacy.\u201d To that end, Zingsheim launched a Kickstarter page aimed at attracting enough capital to safeguard the shop\u2019s inventory and fund its relocation. One month later, contributions from nearly 400 supporters had overshot the campaign\u2019s stated $30,000 goal by more than $2K. While searching out an appropriate new locale, Zingsheim also negotiated a temporary stay of eviction that allowed the business to stay open through a short-term lease. Frase, who still maintains a presence at the shop as occasional clerk and used book scout, happily signed over Cameron\u2019s to the new owner on the night before Christmas 2019. Zingsheim has spoken with Doug Whyte , executive director of the Hollywood Theater, about the possibility of moving bookstore operations toward the same not-profit status that allowed the beloved Movie Madness video rental store to survive changing economic conditions under the Hollywood\u2019s aegis. In addition, she has outlined plans for digitizing large swaths of Cameron\u2019s archive, which contains periodicals dating back to the mid-1800s, and building an easily-accessible database for both written content and images. \u201cMore than 30% of our collection is the last remaining copy,\u201d Zingsheim told the Oregonian, adding that \u201cthe information \u2026 encompasses the last couple hundred years of American history. It represents who and what makes up our country.\u201d ==Cultural Influence== Bishop's House, 2011 Portland City Commissioner and Independent Publishing Resource Center co-founder Chloe Eudaly, who first came to prominence as owner/operator of seminal mid-90s PDX zine emporium Reading Frenzy in 1994, has said an early stint working at Cameron\u2019s offered her first \u201cbasic overview of the book business.\u201d Longtime downtown resident Thomas Lauderdale, founder of internationally-celebrated PDX lounge-pop troupe Pink Martini, listed Cameron\u2019s as one of four candidates for his personal \u2018Portland Hall of Fame.\u2019 Pulitzer-winning historian Debby Applegate, raised in the nearby suburb of Clackamas, has credited childhood trips to the bookshop as helping cultivate her love of reading. Given its proximity to downtown Portland's hotel district, the shop regularly attracts visiting celebrities as well. While on tour with country legend Merle Haggard, iconic singer-songwriter Bob Dylan reportedly stepped inside Cameron\u2019s to purchase a Time feature on Haggard after spotting the cover within their window display. UK film star Richard Harris came into the store looking for a 1967 Life magazine and told former- owner Frase that he had been promised that issue\u2019s cover until news broke about the surprise defection of Svetlana Alliluyeva, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin\u2019s only daughter. (Alliluyeva\u2019s youngest daughter would herself open a curio boutique in NW Portland) Before embarking upon a 2009 global tour that took the avant-rock duo through Brisbane and Beijing, Kill Rock Stars act Panther shot a music video at Cameron\u2019s as part of The Penny Jam series of tastemaker PDX bands playing unlikely venues. In this clip, frontman Charlie Salas-Humara (Sun Angle founding member, Walter Salas-Humara nephew) and drummer Joe Kelly 31Knots are crammed into the north window display for a hurtling rendition of then-unreleased single \u201cControl Your Ships\u201d. In 2011, while attending the Wieden+Kennedy12 advertising school, future Nike designers Jin Ryu and Yi-fan Lu filmed a documentary exploring \u201cthe strong communities ... built up around the unique secondhand book market\" that focused on the shop's \u201cresurgence amongst the newest generation \u2013 a group known for their reliance on technology.\u201d Screened as part of the 38th Northwest Filmmakers' Festival, Willamette Week critic Matthew Singer deemed Cameron's Books \u201cbest and most straightforward\u201d of the short program and wrote that the doc achieved \u201cthe tenor of a nature program capturing a creature in the wild just before its species goes extinct.\u201d ==See also== * Powell's Books ==References== ==External links== * Category:1938 establishments in Oregon Category:Bookstores of the United States Category:Companies based in Portland, Oregon Category:Retail companies established in 1938 Category:Southwest Portland, Oregon ",
