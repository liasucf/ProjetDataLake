    "text": "Richard Wilson Wardill (3 November 1840 - 17 August 1873) was an Australian cricketer who played in ten first-class cricket matches, eight of which were for Victoria. He was the first cricketer to score a century in Australian first-class cricket, when he made 110 and 45 not out in Victoria's victory over New South Wales in 1867-68. Wardill was also an influential player and administrator in the early years of Australian rules football. On Boxing Day 1866 he captained the Melbourne Cricket Club against the Western District Aboriginal cricket team, led by Tom Wills. Wardill was a prolific gambler, and to nurture his habit he defrauded his employer, the Victorian Sugar Company, of \u00a37000. He confessed to his crime in August 1873 and soon after committed suicide by drowning himself in the Yarra River. He was survived by his wife, Eliza Helma Lovett (n\u00e9e Cameron), and a son, Richard. Cricket writer Gideon Haigh published an article on Wardill in 1992 titled \"The Drowned Bradman\". His brother Benjamin also played cricket for Victoria. ==See also== * List of Victoria first-class cricketers ==References== Category:1835 births Category:1873 deaths Category:Australian cricketers Category:Victoria cricketers Category:Suicides by drowning in Australia Category:Cricketers who committed suicide Category:Melbourne Cricket Club cricketers Category:Suicides in Victoria (Australia) Category:Melbourne Football Club (pre-VFA) players Category:English emigrants to colonial Australia ",
