    "text": "Coronation of King Ferdinand V of Bohemia in 1836, the last Bohemian coronation. The Coronation of the Bohemian monarch was a ceremony in which the king (or queen-regnant) and queen-consort (if there was at time) was formally crowned, anointed and invested with regalia. It corresponded to the coronation ceremonies that occurred in other European monarchies, especially France, Germany and partially neighboring Hungary and England. Like in France and England the king's reign began immediately upon the death of his predecessor. Location of all coronations was St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, from time it was founded. Person performing coronation of king was Archbishop of Prague. Until archbishopric of Prague was established in 1344, the archbishop of Mainz has the right to crown king (and queen) of Bohemia. This right was derived from his position as Primas Germaniae of Holy Roman Empire. Ordinance for coronation (with all requisites to be performed) was set in coronation prescription (ordo in Latin, korunova\u010dn\u00ed \u0159\u00e1d in Czech) made by king Charles I (Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor). The first crowned ruler (king) of Bohemia was Vratislaus II of Bohemia. During the Middle Ages, it was held that enthronement would make a person Duke of Bohemia and that only coronation would make a person King of Bohemia. So coronations were held shortly after accession of new king (or acceptance of new king). In modern era the new king ascended on throne after death of his predecessor as king and coronation ceremony was held some time after accession.Lisa Wolverton, Hastening Toward Prague: Power and Society in the Medieval Czech Lands, University of Pennsylvania Press, 2001 St. Vitus Cathedral was the coronation church.The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1911 Monarchs of Bohemia were crowned with the Crown of Saint Wenceslas and invested with royal insignia, among which a cap or mitre and a lance (symbols of Saint Wenceslas) were specific for Bohemian coronations. Maria Theresa, the only female monarch of Bohemia, was crowned literally as king in order to emphasize that she was the monarch and not consort. The last King of Bohemia to be crowned as such was Emperor Ferdinand I of Austria (Ferdinand V as king of Bohemia) and his wife queen Maria Anna.The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 1974 The Abbess of St. George's Abbey had traditionally the privilege to crown the wife of the King of Bohemia.The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1913 In 1791, the right to crown the Queen of Bohemia was transferred to the Abbess of the neighbouring Theresian Institution of Noble Ladies (a post always filled by an Archduchess of Austria). The coronation was not necessary for rule in Bohemia, but all kings except six were crowned. Kings of Bohemia who were not crowned during their reign were: * Wenceslaus III (ruled 1305\u20131306, short reign, murdered before coronation) * Henry of Bohemia (ruled 1307\u20131310, lost throne) * Joseph I (ruled 1705\u20131711, died before coronation) * Joseph II (ruled 1780\u20131790, not crowned in Hungary either) * Franz Joseph I (ruled 1848\u20131916, not willing to be crowned) * Charles III (ruled 1916\u20131918, short reign; state at war, deposed). On the other hand, king Ferdinand IV was crowned during the lifetime of his father (Ferdinand III), but he died before him, so he never actually reigned. Coronation of the heir during life of his father was only temporary custom for kings: Ferdinand III, Ferdinand IV and Leopold I. == List of royal coronations == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! align=center | Status !
