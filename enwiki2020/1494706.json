Her 1984 novel The Hero and the Crown won the Newbery Medal as the year's best new American children's book. , McKinley has written or contributed to twenty books. Her most recent novel is Shadows (2013). == Biography == Robin McKinley was born as Jennifer Carolyn Robin McKinley on November 16, 1952 in Warren, Ohio. Her father William McKinley was an officer in the United States Navy and her mother Jeanne Turrell McKinley was a teacher. As a result of her father's changing naval posts, McKinley grew up all over the world, including in California, New York, Japan, and Maine. She was educated at Gould Academy, a preparatory school in Bethel, Maine. McKinley went on to attend college, first at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania in 1970\u20131972 and later at Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine, where she graduated summa cum laude in 1975. Robin McKinley lives in Hampshire, England. Her husband was author Peter Dickinson; they were married from 1991 until his death in 2015. They had no children, though Dickinson had children from his first marriage. McKinley currently has two dogs, and her many \"obsessions\" include learning Japanese, playing the piano, horseback riding, gardening, cooking, and bell ringing. === Career === After graduating from college, she remained in Maine for several years working as a research assistant and later in a bookstore. During this time, she completed her first book, Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast. It was accepted for publication by the first publisher it was sent to and upon publication immediately pushed McKinley to prominence. The book was named an American Library Association Notable Children's Book and an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. === Awards === *1983 Newbery Honor for The Blue Sword. *1985 Newbery Medal for The Hero and the Crown. *1986 World Fantasy Award for Anthology/Collection for Imaginary Lands, as editor. *1998 Phoenix Award Honor Book for Beauty. *2004 Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature for Sunshine. === Writing === Robin McKinley has written a variety of novels, mostly in the fantasy genre. Several of her novels are her own personal renditions of classic fairy tales with a \"feminist twist\". These retellings usually feature a strong female protagonist who does not wait to be rescued but instead takes an active role in determining the course of her own life. Beauty and Rose Daughter are both versions of Beauty and the Beast, Spindle's End is the story of Sleeping Beauty, and Deerskin and two of the stories in The Door in the Hedge are based on other folk-tales. Besides adapting classic fairy tales, McKinley wrote her own rendition of the Robin Hood story in her novel The Outlaws of Sherwood. McKinley has written two novels set in the imaginary land of Damar, The Blue Sword and The Hero and the Crown. Her contribution to the Imaginary Lands anthology and the stories in A Knot in the Grain are also set there. Her standalone novels include Sunshine, Shadows, and Dragonhaven. The heroines in McKinley's books reflect certain qualities that she saw in herself as a young woman: clumsiness, plainness, bookishness, and disinterest in the usual social games that involve flirting and dating. In her Newbery Award acceptance speech, she said, \"I didn't discover boys because they didn't discover me, and because their standards of discovery seemed to me too odd to be aspired to. They were the ones who got to have adventures, while we got to\u2014well, not have adventures.\" McKinley says she writes about strong heroines because she feels very strongly about the potential for girls to be \"doing things\", and she feels that the selection of fantasy literature featuring girls is scarce and unsatisfactory. According to biographer Marilyn H. Karrenbrock, \"McKinley's females do not simper; they do not betray their own nature to win a man's approval. But neither do they take love lightly or put their own desires before anything else. In McKinley's books, the romance, like the adventure, is based upon ideals of faithfulness, duty, and honor.\" == Works == === Children's picture books === * Rowan (1992), Illustrated by Donna Ruff * My Father is in the Navy (1992), Illustrated by Martine Gourbalt * The Stone Fey (1998), Illustrated by John Clapp === Adaptations === * Black Beauty Storybook Edition (1986), Illustrated by Susan Jeffers.
