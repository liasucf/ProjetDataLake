    "text": "The Hurufiyya movement ( \u1e25urufiyyah, adjectival form \u1e25uruf\u012b, literally \"letters [of the alphabet]\") is an aesthetic movement that emerged in the second half of the twentieth century amongst Arab artists, who used their understanding of traditional Islamic calligraphy within the precepts of modern art. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a culture specific visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the Hurufi, an approach of Sufism which emerged in the late 14th\u2013early 15th century. Art historian Sandra Dagher has described Hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in Arabic art in the 20th century. ==Definition== The term, hurifiyya is derived from the Arabic term, harf which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe a contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.Mir-Kasimov, O., Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam, I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015 Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning.Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 p. 115 The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the Al-hurufiyyah movementAli, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16 or the Letrism movementIssa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,New York, Merrill, 2016) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.Mavrakis, N., \"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online: ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., A-Z Great Modern Artists, Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56 The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the Letterist International which had an Algerian section founded in Chlef in 1953 by Hadj Mohamed Dahou. The term, hurufiyya has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including Wijdan Ali, Nada Shabout and Karen Dabrowska. An alternative term, al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., \"Huroufiyah\" in: Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art, Routledge, 2016, DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67 ==Brief history and philosophy== An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth, page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement. Traditional calligraphic art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined it to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.Schimmel, A., Calligraphy and Islamic Culture, London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32 Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists, however, broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 p. 3 The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions.Dadi. I., \"Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective,\" South Atlantic Quarterly, 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the Old Khartoum School,Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202 and assumed a distinctive character, in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style.Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299; Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202 In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Amazigh motifs.Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202 In Jordan, it was generally known as the al-hurufiyyah movement, while in Iran, it was called the Saqqa-Khaneh movement.Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 Some scholars have suggested that Madiha Omar, who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 pp 115-119 However, other scholars have suggested that she was a precursor to Hurufiyya.Anima Gallery, \"Madiha Omar,\" [Biographical Notes], Online: Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of Ibrahim el- Salahi,Mavrakis, N., \"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online:;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., A-Z Great Modern Artists, Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi.

These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions.Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., The Modernist World, Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., \"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online:; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., A-Z Great Modern Artists, Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56 The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117 Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 p. 3 : \"They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings.\" The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, Mahmoud Taha, who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,Asfour, M., \"A Window on Contemporary Arab Art,\" NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/ and sculptors, such as the Qatari, Yousef AhmadAnima Gallery, \"Yousef Ahdmad,\" [Biographical Notes], Online: and the Iraqi sculptors, Jawad Saleem and Mohammed Ghani Hikmat. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's Al Bu'd al Wahad (or the One Dimension Group)\" which published a manifesto,\"Shaker Hassan Al Said,\" Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture, Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., \"Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective,\" South Atlantic Quarterly. Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006 Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. However, the Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither \"a movement nor a school.\"Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200 ===Evolution of hurufiyya=== Ashaar Baghdad (Baghdad's poetry) by Mohammed Ghani Hikmat. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of abstract calligraphy. Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists:Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,New York, Merrill, 2016 : First generation: The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, Princess Wijdan Ali, the Sudanese artist, Ibrahim el-Salahi; the Iraqi artists, Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id, Jamil Hamoudi and Jawad Saleem; the Lebanese painter and poet, Etel Adnan and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926). : Second generation: Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, Dia Azzawi is typical of this generation. : Third generation: Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of Golnaz Fathi and Lalla Essaydi is representative of the third generation. ==Types of hurufiyya art== Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of \"explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters.\"Reynolds, D.F., The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture, Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200 Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85 Ali identifies the following, which she describes as schools within the movement:Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here. ; Pure calligraphy : Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165 ; Neoclassical : Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of Khairat Al- Saleh (b. 1940)Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165 Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art ; Modern classical : Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this styleAli, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66 ;Calligraffiti : Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, Etel Adnan; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. Shakir Hassan Al Said.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69 ; Freeform calligraphy : Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170 ; Abstract calligraphy : Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and Mahmoud Hammad (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172 ; Calligraphy Combinations : Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, Dia Azzawi is a representative of this style.Shabout, N.M., Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics, University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88 ==Examples== File:Ceiling of Frere Hall.jpg|Roof of Frere Hall, Karachi, Pakistan, c. 1986.

Both Omar and Hamoudi joined the One Dimension Group when it was founded by Shakir Hassan Al Said in 1971 since its principles were based on the importance of the Arabic letter.Ali, W., Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity, University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 52 The artist and art historian, Princess Wijdan Ali, who developed the traditions of Arabic calligraphy in a modern, abstract format and is considered a pioneer of the movement in Jordan, has been able to bring hurufiyya to the attention of a broader audience through her writing and her work as a curator and patron of the arts.; Ramadan, K.D., Peripheral Insider: Perspectives on Contemporary Internationalism in Visual Culture, Museum Tusculanum Press, 2007, p. 49; Mavrakis, N., \"The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art,\" McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog, Online: Notable exponents of hurufiyya art include:Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G.
