He was made a Knight of the Bath at the coronation of King James I.G.M.C., 'Hopton, Arthur (d.1607), of Blythburgh, Suff. and Witham Friary, Som.', in P.W. Hasler (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603 (from Boydell and Brewer 1981), History of Parliament Online. Arthur was the first son of Sir Owen Hopton and Anne, elder daughter of Sir Edward Echyngham and Ann Everard. He married Rachel, daughter of Edmund Hall of Greatford, Lincolnshire: the marriage was arranged by May 1566.Marriage Settlement, 22 May 1566, Suffolk Record Office (Ipswich) ref. HA30/369/11 (Discovery Catalogue). Rachel was the niece of William Willoughby, 1st Baron Willoughby of Parham, whose sister Dorothy Willoughby was the wife of Sir Ralph Hopton (died 1571). Sir Ralph Hopton, who made himself responsible for Rachel's upbringing, arranged her marriage to Arthur and settled the reversion of most of his lands upon them in tail male, including his estate of Witham Friary in Somerset.R. Virgoe, 'Hopton, Sir Ralph (1509/10-71), of Witham, Som.', in S.T. Bindoff (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1509-1558 (from Boydell and Brewer 1982), History of Parliament Online; R. Virgoe, 'Hopton, Sir Ralph (c.1510-71), of Witham Friary, Som.', in P.W. Hasler (ed.), The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1558-1603 (from Boydell and Brewer 1981), History of Parliament Online. Although it has been claimed that Ralph was a half-brother of Sir Owen Hopton's, a suit of 1601 indicates that the marriage of Rachel and Arthur was arranged to ensure that Sir Ralph's estates continued in a family named Hopton, and not through any alliance of consanguinity.The National Archives (UK), Chancery: Final decrees, Mayowe v Hopton (1601), ref. C78/118/8 (Discovery catalogue); View original at AALT, images 0128-0136 (AALT). Sir Arthur himself was co-executor to his uncle Robert Hopton (died 1590) and guardian of Robert's daughter Dorothy,Will of Robert Hopton of London (P.C.C. 1591, Sainberbe quire). who married Arthur's son Owen Hopton. His father Sir Owen Hopton having died in 1595, leaving plentiful debts, Sir Arthur Hopton sold away the Hopton family estates around Yoxford and Blythburgh in east Suffolk to Robert Brooke, Alderman of London,A.B. Beavan, The Aldermen of the City London, temp. Henry III.-1908., 2 vols (The City Corporation, London 1913), II, p. 44 (Internet Archive). in 1597.Suffolk Record Office, Ipswich: Blois Family Archives, (1) Final concord (Trinity 1591), Robert Brooke and Arthur Hopton, ref. HA30/369/147; (2) Conveyance (12 June 1592), Owen Tasburgh to Robert Brooke, ref. HA30/312/2 (Discovery Catalogue). Brooke apparently bought them in anticipation of the first marriage of his son, also Robert Brooke, which occurred shortly afterwards.J.P. Ferris, 'Brooke, Sir Robert (1573-1646), of Cockfield Hall, Yoxford, Suff. and Walbrook, London', in A. Thrush and J.P. Ferris, The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1604-1629 (from Cambridge University Press 2010), History of Parliament. In the course of this transaction, Hopton brought a charge of fraud against the Brookes whom he accused of falsely interlineating the conveyance to include the manor of Blythburgh Priory and the Blythburgh rectory (not intended to be conveyed).W.A. Copinger (ed.), County of Suffolk: Its History as Disclosed by Existing Records, Vol. 1 (Henry Sotheran & Co., London 1904), pp. 222, 223, 224 (Internet Archive), citing Common Pleas, II, 13. There was a severe wrangle over the conveyances and payments, during which Sir Arthur was imprisoned by Brooke the elder; by 1601 Brooke the elder was dead and Hopton faced a costly adjustment of his affairs.The National Archives (UK), Chancery: Final decrees, Hopton v Brooke, ref C78/89/16; View originals, rots 32-39, at AALT, images 0527-0539 (AALT). The estates were settled upon Brooke the younger by 1598,Will of Robert Brooke, Alderman of London (P.C.C. 1601, Woodhall quire). who made his seat at the former Hopton manor of Westwood (Blythburgh) before rebuilding Cockfield Hall at Yoxford, all of which by marriage descended in a later generation to the Blois family. The recognisances and Statutes Staple applicable to the manors were released to Robert Brooke by Sir Arthur's son Robert Hopton in 1613,Suffolk Record Office, Ipswich, Blois Family Archives, ref. HA30/312/21 (Discovery Catalogue). six years after his father's death. ==Family== The children of Arthur and Rachel Hopton are shown as follows:'Hopton', in F.T.
