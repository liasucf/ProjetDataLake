The creek is designated as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery, but is not a trout fishery. ==Course== Winfield Creek looking downstream in Winfield Winfield Creek begins in a valley on a ridge in Union Township. It flows southwest for a short distance before turning south and entering a much broader valley. The creek then turns south-southeast for a few tenths of a mile, crossing Pennsylvania Route 304 before turning east-northeast. It flows in this direction through the valley for several miles, running alongside Pennsylvania Route 304 and entering the census-designated place of Winfield. However, the creek eventually turns northeast and crosses US Route 15 before turning east. A short distance further downstream, it reaches its confluence with the West Branch Susquehanna River. Winfield Creek joins the West Branch Susquehanna River upriver of its mouth, making it the final named tributary of the river. ===Tributaries=== Winfield Creek has no named tributaries. However, it does have four unnamed tributaries. Three join the creek on its right bank and one joins it on its left bank. ==Hydrology== Winfield Creek is designated as an impaired stream.
