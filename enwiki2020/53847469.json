In addition to Sana's popularity, Meskini has been praised for her portrayal of the character and her outstanding representation of Muslim youth within Western societies, but especially female Muslim teenagers living in Norway. Sana's appearance and portrayal on a show as popular as Skam at a time which saw a rise in Islamophobia across the globe was marked by many as essential in challenging stereotypes of hijab-wearing Muslim women and provided non-Muslim Norwegians with an alternative representation of their Muslim neighbours. ==References== Category:1997 births Category:Living people Category:Norwegian people of Tunisian descent Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:21st- century Norwegian actresses Category:Norwegian television actresses Category:Norwegian Muslims Category:People from Kolbotn ",
