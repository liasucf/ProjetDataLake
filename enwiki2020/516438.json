    "text": "The 1897 Quebec general election was held on May 11, 1897 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The Quebec Liberal Party, led by F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand, defeated the incumbent Quebec Conservative Party, led by Edmund James Flynn. This marked the start of over 39 consecutive years in power for the Liberals. The Conservative Party never held power again in Quebec, and ceased to exist in 1936 when it merged with the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale to form the Union Nationale, which formed a government later that year. Marchand died in office in 1900, and was succeeded by Simon-Napol\u00e9on Parent as Liberal leader and premier. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1892 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | F\u00e9lix-Gabriel Marchand |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|21 !align=\"right\"|51 |align=\"right\"|+143% |align=\"right\"|120,300 |align=\"right\"| 53.28% |align=\"right\"|+9.63% | Edmund James Flynn |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 51 !align=\"right\"| 23 |align=\"right\"| -54.9% |align=\"right\"|98,941 |align=\"right\"| 43.82% |align=\"right\"| -8.59% |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|1 !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|-100% |align=\"right\"|6,538 |align=\"right\"| 2.90% |align=\"right\"|-1.0% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|73 !align=\"right\"|74 !align=\"right\"|+1.4% !align=\"right\"|225,779 !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 9th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
