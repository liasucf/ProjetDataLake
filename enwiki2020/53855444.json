    "text": "Ferguson v. McKiernan was a 2007 Pennsylvania Supreme Court case in which, in a 3-2 decision, the court reversed a lower court ruling requiring sperm donor Joel McKiernan to pay child support. ==Factual background== Joel McKiernan met Ivonne Ferguson in May 1991, with their relationship becoming intimate several months later. In 1993, Ferguson expressed a desire to have another child. However, after finding out that her tubal ligation was irreversible, Ferguson submitted to in vitro fertilization (IVF) in order to conceive another child. During this process, she asked McKiernan to deliver his sperm so that she could use it for the IVF procedure. While he was initially hesitant to do so, she convinced him by promising that she would not track him down for any child support afterwards. Ferguson gave birth to male twins (Travis and Tyler) on August 25, 1994. Afterwards, McKiernan mostly maintained his anonymity until Ferguson found his phone number and filed for child support in May 1999. ==Decision and appeals== While both a trial and a Superior Court ruled in favor of Ferguson, their ruling was overturned by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court in a 3-2 vote on December 27, 2007. In the majority opinion (joined by Justices Ralph Cappy and Ronald Castille), Justice Max Baer upheld the validity of the verbal contract between Joel McKiernan and Ivonne Ferguson had and held that McKiernan had no obligation to pay child support. In his opinion, Justice Baer cited the Uniform Parentage Act and wrote that holding sperm donors responsible for paying child support would make them less likely to donate their sperm, which in turn would limit the reproductive prerogatives of would-be mothers. Justice Baer also noted the spread of unconventional methods of sperm donation in Pennsylvania in recent years. Finally, Baer rejected the causation argument in favor of forcing Kiernan to pay child support and pointed out that, were it not for McKiernan's actions, she would not have had children unless another, anonymous donor had given sperm, and she thus would not have been entitled to any child support. ==Dissents== In their dissents, Justices Thomas Saylor and J. Michael Eakin argued that there is no basis in Pennsylvania public policy for the court's ruling. In addition to this, in his dissent, Justice Eakin pointed out that relying on the 2002 Uniform Parentage Act is misplaced since this act was not adopted by the Pennsylvania General Assembly. ==References== Category:Child support Category:Sperm donation Category:United States reproductive rights case law Category:2007 in Pennsylvania Category:Pennsylvania state case law ",
