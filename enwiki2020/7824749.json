He qualified for the Olympic Games by placing second at the 2nd AIBA American 2004 Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Stewardson moved to Medicine Hat, Alta. in the leadup to the Olympics but was almost denied entry to the 2004 Games because of miscommunication between him and Boxing Canada.

In 1998 he won a bronze medal in the 1998 Commonwealth Games at Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Since Athens Stewardson has remained in Medicine Hat and in 2008 began a pro career in mixed martial arts.
