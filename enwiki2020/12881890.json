Arson in medieval Scandinavia (Old Norse h\u00fas-brenna or h\u00fas-bruni, \"house-burning\") was a technique sometimes employed in blood feuds and political conflicts in order to assassinate someone. In committing arson, a group of attackers would set fire to the home of an opponent, sometimes by quickly and surreptitiously piling wood, brush and other combustible materials against the exterior of a dwelling and set it on fire. Typically the attackers would surround the house to prevent the escape of its inhabitants, although women, the elderly, and small children were sometimes allowed to leave.Njal's Saga \u00a7 129. ==In Iceland== Under Icelandic law as codified in the Gragas, quickfire could be punished by death only if the arsonists were killed in the act. However, if captured alive the arsonists had to be tried and sentenced to outlawry, even if they were thralls. Failure to observe these formalities could result in the killer of quickfire-arsonists being prosecuted himself.Eyrbyggja Saga \u00a7 31. In this edition the translation given is simply \"arson\"; however, the earlier translation by William Morris and Eirikr Magnusson (Bernard Quaritch, London, 1892) uses the translation \"quickfire\". At least some Icelanders considered quickfire dishonorable, hence when the enemies of Gunnar H\u00e1mundarson attacked his home they refused to burn him inside, despite the fact that it would have been faster and less costly in lives.Njal's Saga \u00a7 77. Members of Gunnar's clan showed no such scruples when, around 1010, they burned Bergthorshvoll, home of Gunnar's erstwhile ally Nj\u00e1ll \u00deorgeirsson, his wife Berg\u00fe\u00f3ra, his sons Helgi and Skarph\u00e9\u00f0inn Nj\u00e1lsson, and his grandson \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur K\u00e1rason. It is because of this occurrence of quickfire that the name of the saga in Icelandic is Brennu-Nj\u00e1ls saga, \"The Saga of the Burning of Nj\u00e1ll\". One son-in-law, K\u00e1ri S\u00f6lmundarson, escaped and later killed many of the burners. Here is the description of the arson of Nj\u00e1ll's house : Another instance of quickfire is told in the Eyrbyggja Saga. According to it, in the late 10th century in Iceland, Ulfar, a freedman, was the victim of an attempted quickfire by thralls (slaves, or serfs) owned by his enemy Thorolf. Thorolf's own son, Arnkel Go\u00f0i, captured the thralls in the act and had them executed the following day. Arnkel's rival Snorri Go\u00f0i prosecuted Arnkel, at Thorolf's request, for the unlawful killing of the thralls.Eyrbyggja Saga \u00a7 31. The Sturlunga saga reports that in 1253, during the Age of the Sturlungs, the Flugum\u00fdri Arson was an unsuccessful attempt on the life of Gissur \u00deorvaldsson by his Icelandic enemies. This account is quite similar to what is told in Brennu-Nj\u00e1ls saga : an assault against a house is faltering, so the attackers have the idea to use fire against the besieged defenders. According to Lee M. Hollander, it is possible that this account inspired that of the burning of Nj\u00e1ll. However, the episode of the burning of Nj\u00e1ll also appears in the Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k and several other sources. ==In mainland Scandinavia== In both Norway and Sweden, arson had the specificity of being used by kings, either during succession wars (such as the civil war era in Norway) or during attempts at unification and expansion of territorial control by a king (for instance Harald Fairhair in Norway or Ingjald Illr\u00e5de in Sweden). According to the medieval Swedish ballad Stolt Herr Alf, Odin himself advised a king to kill one of his vassals with quickfire. ===Sweden=== The use of quickfire by 11th-century Swedish king Anund Jakob earned him the nickname \"charcoal- burner\". In Sweden, at least three kings are told as having used quickfire as a way to kill their opponents. The semi-legendary king Ingjald Illr\u00e5de (who may have reigned in the 7th century) used quickfire at least twice: first he used it to kill several invited petty kings in order to directly rule their territories, and lastly he used it to kill Granmar, the last independent king of S\u00f6dermanland., Ynglinga Saga , chapter 40 The regnal list of the Westrogothic law gave the 11th-century Swedish king Anund Jakob (King of Sweden 1022 \u2013 c. 1050) the epithet \"charcoal-burner\" because of his methods. He was said to have been \"generous in burning down men's homes\". According to the Orkneyinga saga and the Saga of Herv\u00f6r and Heithrek, the exiled Swedish king Inge the Elder retook the Swedish throne by using quickfire against his pagan opponent Blot-Sweyn. This happened c. 1087 : The Altuna RunestoneJansson, S. B. F. (1987). Runes in Sweden. p. 150 in Sweden also tells that a father and a son were burnt to death inside their home : ===Norway=== In the Heimskringla, Snorri Sturluson records many accounts of quickfire used in the struggles between powerful men in Norway. According to him, Harald Fairhair, the Norwegian king traditionally credited with unifying Norway at the end of the 9th century, often used quickfire, as an alternative to, and in addition with, battles. One of his first deeds was the killing, either by fire or with weapons, of four petty kings in a single quickfire raid. According to Snorri, this allowed Harald to seize control over \"Hedemark, Ringerike, Gudbrandsdal, Hadeland, Thoten, Raumarike, and the whole northern part of Vingulmark\". Later, Snorri recounts how arson was used to kill a rival king when a conventional armed expedition was not possible due to the season : In contrast with Icelandic accounts of quickfire in the Brennu- Nj\u00e1ls saga and the Sturlunga saga, where it is used when a siege becomes difficult, accounts given by the Heimskringla of arsons in Norway rely heavily on surprise, and setting fire to the targeted house is the first thing done. Thus, surprise and good knowledge of the target's whereabouts are at a premium. This is shown by this account of an attempt by Gregorius Dagsson to kill H\u00e1kon her\u00f0ibrei\u00f0r, who at that time (during the civil war era in Norway) vied for succession with Ingi Haraldsson : During the civil war era in Norway, Erling Skakke burns the house of a supporter of the pretender Sigurd Markusfostre, as imagined by artist Wilhelm Wetlesen in the 1899 edition of Heimskringla. ==Popular culture== *In Vikings, Ragnar Lothbrok murders his \"former\" enemy Jarl Borg's warriors by burning their couters. *In Saxon Stories, and its TV adaptation, The Last Kingdom, the house of the adoptive father of the protagonist Uhtred of Bebbanburg, Earl Ragnar, burns in similar fashion. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Cook, Robert, trans.
