    "text": "Engenheiro Manoel Feio is a train station on CPTM Line 12-Sapphire, located in the city of Itaquaquecetuba, in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo. In the future, it can be a terminus for the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Rail Ring. ==History== The station was built by EFCB between 1921 and 1926 and opened 7 February 1926, named after the EFCB engineer Manoel Feio. After a short period of operation, in which occurred a derailment on 6 May 1930, causing the death of 4 people and wounding 20, the station and Variante de Po\u00e1 were closed and reopened only on 1 January 1934. In 1979, it received a new building built by RFFSA, in the scope of construction of Variante do Parate\u00ed (branch between Engenheiro Manoel Feio and S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos), reformed in 1986. It is operated by CPTM since 1994. The precariousness of services, along with the feeling of unsafety in the region caused the occurrence of vandalism in the station during the 1980s and 1990s and a heist to its ticket offices with 26 hostages on 19 May 2000. ===Projects=== There are two projects for its rebuilt. In 2005, CPTM hired Una Arquitetos to make the project for a new edification and, in 2012, the JBMC office was hired to make a new project. Besides the projects are concluded, there is no prediction for the start of the construction. Recently, a group of local residents pleaded in the Legislative Assembly, through State Deputy Carlos Cezar (PSB), without success, a suggestion for the renaming of the station to Presidente Juscelino Kubitschek. The reason would be that the current name is considered pejorative for some residents, though it was done in 1926. After an article published in the 22nd Week of Metroviary Technology of the Metro Engineers and Architects Association (AEAMESP), the cost for an intermediary station renaming is almost 620,000 BRL ( USD), a reason why CPTM avoids the renaming of station, except when obligated by law. After the Information Requirement no. 254/2019, made by State Deputy M\u00f4nica Seixas (PSOL), CPTM published a schedule of investments predicted and done for the making of the reconstruction of the station. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1926 Category:Railway stations opened in 1934 Category:1926 establishments in Brazil ",
