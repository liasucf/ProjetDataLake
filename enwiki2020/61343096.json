    "text": "A trifora over Porta della carta, Doge's Palace, Venice Trifora is a type of the three-light window. The trifora usually appears in towers and belfrys\u2014on the top floors, where it is necessary to lighten the structure with wider openings. ==Overview== The trifora has three openings divided by two small columns or pilasters, on which rest three arches, round or acute. Sometimes, the whole trifora is framed by a further large arch. The space among arches is usually decorated by a coat of arms or a circular opening. Less popular than the mullioned window, the trifora was, however, widely used in the Romanesque, Gothic, and Renaissance periods. Later, the window was mostly forgotten, coming back in vogue in the nineteenth century, in the period of eclecticism and the rediscovery of ancient styles (Neo-Gothic, Neo-Renaissance, and so on). Compared to the mullioned window, the trifora was generally used for larger and more ornate openings. ==Gallery== File:Rivalta Scrivia Abbazia Santa Maria Trifora.jpg|Abbazia di Santa Maria di Rivalta in Tortona File:Stained glass window Constance Minster.JPG|Konstanz Minster File:Siena Palazzo Pubblico 20030813-349.jpg|Palazzo Pubblico in Siena File:Interno della cattedrale di Amiens (Francia 2009).jpg|Amiens Cathedral File:Mantova-Palazzo Bonacolsi.Trifora.JPG|Palazzo Bonacolsi in Mantua ==See also== *Monofora *Bifora *Quadrifora *Polifora *Diocletian window ==References== * AA.VV.
