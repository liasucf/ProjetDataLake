    "text": "The Kayts Island Fort (; Kayits Dupath Balakotuwa) was built by the Portuguese in 1629 and was abandoned in 1651. In the late 1600s, Dutch controlled the fort when they took over the Kayts island. During the Dutch rule, it was not normal to undergo restoration like the former forts of Portugal. The horseshoe shaped fort with four circular bastions was built to protect Jaffna Peninsula like other Portuguese forts in the peninsula. There was one of the primary commercial ports called \u201cUrundai\u201d beside the fort. Therefore, the fort was known as \u201cUrundai Fort\u201d. The Tamil word \u201cUrundai\u201d literally means sphere or round-shape. == See also == * Forts of Sri Lanka == References == * == External links == * Portuguese Forts in Sri Lanka Category:Dutch forts in Sri Lanka Category:Forts in Northern Province, Sri Lanka Category:Portuguese forts in Sri Lanka Category:1629 establishments in the Portuguese Empire Category:Archaeological protected monuments in Jaffna District Category:Kayts ",
