The three judges' scored the bout 98\u201390, 98\u201391, 97\u201390 in his favour. Peynaud started the fight swinging aiming to land big shots, however Benn used his feet to move around the ring and sensibly box. Peynaud managed to land clean shots on Benn, without doing too much damage. The first knockdown came in round 2, although it was clear that Peynaud lost balance and slipped to the canvas. In round 7, Peynaud took a knee following a hard body shot. A right hook dropped Peynaud down a third time in round 9. Benn was able to go the 10 round distance for the first time in his professional career. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |17 | | |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Sebastian Formella | |\u2013 (10) |Nov 21, 2020 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Stephane Jamoye |TKO |4 (10), |26 Oct 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jussi Koivula |TKO |2 (10), |21 Jun 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |align=left| Josef Zahradnik |PTS |8 |20 Apr 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |align=left| Cedrick Peynaud |UD |10 |28 Jul 2018 |align=left| |align=left| |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |align=left| Chris Truman |TKO |4 (6), |21 Apr 2018 |align=left| | |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |align=left| Cedrick Peynaud |PTS |6 |13 Dec 2017 |align=left| |align=left| |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |align=left| Brandon Sanudo |KO |2 (6), |11 Nov 2017 |align=left| |align=left| |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |align=left| Nathan Clarke |TKO |1 (6), |7 Oct 2017 |align=left| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |align=left| Kane Baker |TKO | 2 (6), |1 Sep 2017 |align=left| |align=left| |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |align=left| Mike Cole |TKO |3 (6), |1 Jul 2017 |align=left| |align=left| |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |align=left| Steven Backhouse |TKO |1 (4), |10 Dec 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |align=left| Ross Jameson |PTS |6 |24 Sep 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |align=left| Joe Ducker |KO |2 (4), |10 Sep 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |align=left| Lukas Radic |KO |1 (4), |25 Jun 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Luke Keleher |PTS |4 |28 May 2016 |align=left| |align=left| |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Ivailo Boyanov |TKO |1 (4), |9 Apr 2016 |align=left| | |} ==References== ==External links== Category:Living people Category:1996 births Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English male boxers Category:English people of Barbadian descent Category:Boxers from Greater London Category:People from Greenwich Category:Light-welterweight boxers Category:Welterweight boxers ",
