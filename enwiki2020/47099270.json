It lives alone or in small groups in or near reefs and lagoons between deep and can reach sizes of up to TL. It eats crabs and shrimps. Its dorsal fin is raised to scare off or startle predators. It also has a large venomous spine at the corner of its preopercle. It is relatively unaffected by commercial fishing, but is sometimes used as bait for tuna fisheries. ==References== ==External links== * Fishes of Australia : Neoniphon opercularis * blackfin squirrelfish Category:Marine fish of Northern Australia blackfin squirrelfish Category:Taxa named by Achille Valenciennes ",
