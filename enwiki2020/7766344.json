    "text": "What's Love? Tour is the sixth concert tour by American singer, Tina Turner. The tour supported Turner's autobiographical film and its soundtrack entitled What's Love Got to Do with It. The tour primarily visited North America along with a few shows in Europe and Australasia. ==Background== In 1990, Turner mentioned her record-breaking, 1990 tour, would be her last. Initially, Turner was to have a one-year break before resuming the tour in North America. The tour continuation was placed on hold as Turner decided to focus on acquiring movie roles. As time progressed, Turner changed her focus to the production of her semi-autobiographical film. In an interview with People, Turner stated, Turner's last tour of North America was in 1987 during her Break Every Rule World Tour. Turner later confessed that she did not tour her previous record due to lack of sales in that region, as many spectators still had a hard time disconnecting her from The Revue. After numerous sold out performances at stadiums in Europe, Turner wanted to do an intimate tour. The tour consisted of the same music and costumes of her previous set. Turner included new material from the soundtrack, along with different variations on her well- known hits. Originally destined as a North America only tour, Turner decided to add a few dates in Europe for summer music festivals and Australia where she appeared at the New South Wales Rugby League Grand Final, as their anthem was \"The Best\". In Australia, Turner also performed the after race concert following the 1993 Australian Grand Prix in Adelaide where she was joined on stage by race winner, triple World Drivers' Champion Ayrton Senna.Ayrton Senna with Tina Turner in 1993 ==Opening act== *Lindsey Buckingham (North America) (select dates) *Chris Isaak (North America) (select dates) *John Mellencamp (Switzerland) *Joe Cocker (Switzerland) ==Setlist== #\"Steamy Windows\" #\"Typical Male\" #\"Foreign Affair\" #\"Undercover Agent for the Blues\" #\"Private Dancer\" #\"We Don't Need Another Hero\" #\"I Can't Stand the Rain\" #\"Nutbush City Limits\" #\"Addicted to Love\" #\"The Best\" #\"I Don't Wanna Fight\" #\"Let's Stay Together\" #\"What's Love Got to Do with It\" #\"Proud Mary\" #\"What You Get Is What You See\" #\"Better Be Good to Me\" ;Notes *\"Legs\" was added to the setlist on September 10, 1993.
