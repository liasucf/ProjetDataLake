Thad's rich flugelhorn is as strong as on any date he ever recorded, while Hank's playing is a little more reserved than usual, and Elvin, known for his fierce attack, sticks mainly to brushes\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Thad Jones except where noted # \"Nice and Nasty\" \u2013 6:45 # \"Keepin' up With the Joneses\" \u2013 6:11 # \"Three and One\" \u2013 4:57 # \"Sput 'N' Jeff\" \u2013 6:04 # \"It Had to Be You\" (Isham Jones, Gus Kahn) \u2013 4:48 # \"On the Alamo\" (Isham Jones, Kahn) \u2013 3:13 # \"There Is No Greater Love\" (Isham Jones, Marty Symes) \u2013 4:04 ==Personnel== *Thad Jones \u2013 flugelhorn, trumpet *Hank Jones \u2013 piano *Elvin Jones \u2013 drums *Eddie Jones - bass ==References== Category:1958 albums Category:Thad Jones albums Category:Hank Jones albums Category:Elvin Jones albums Category:MetroJazz Records albums ",
