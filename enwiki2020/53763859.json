Her father, Minoru, is a farmer, and often goes to Tokyo to do extra work for the family. This time, however, he goes missing. Mineko travels to Tokyo to find him, and begins to work at a small electronics factory while continuing her search. She makes many friends there, but the factory goes bankrupt and she is left unemployed. Luckily, she is hired by Suzuko Makino as a waitress at her restaurant, the Suzufuri-tei, which happened to be her father's favorite eatery. She lives at the boarding house next door, in which live a variety of people, from manga artists to college students. Mineko falls in love with a college student, Junichir\u014d Shimatani, but they part when his father forces him to marry to save the family business. Mineko becomes friends with the movie star, Setsuko Kawamoto, who after learning of Mineko's father, reveals that Minoru has been living in her apartment all along. He lost his memory in a fight and Setsuko took him in. Mineko returns Minoru to his family in Ibaraki. Mineko then falls in love with Hidetoshi Maeda, one of the junior chefs at the Suzufuri-tei.
