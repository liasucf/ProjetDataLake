    "text": "Yevgeny Primakov's Cabinet (September 11, 1998, - May 12, 1999) was the seventh cabinet of government of the Russian Federation, preceded by Sergei Kiriyenko's Cabinet fallen as a result of the 1998 Russian financial crisis and followed by Sergei Stepashin's Cabinet. It was led by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, proposed by President Boris Yeltsin on September 10, 1998, as Viktor Chernomyrdin had failed to be approved by the State Duma twice by September 7 (August 31: 94 in favor, 252 against, nobody abstained, September 7: 138 in favor, 273 against, 1 abstained) ; According to the Constitution of Russia, if parliament rejects the president's nomination three times, then parliament must be dissolved and a general election held. On September 11 Primakov was approved by the Duma as Prime Minister (317 in favor, 63 against, 15 abstained) and appointed Prime Minister by the President. In the State Duma only Vladimir Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party of Russia was both in favor of Chernomyrdin and against Primakov. Fourteen ministers of the government out of thirty-one held positions in the previous cabinet: Primakov (Minister for External Affairs), Maslyukov (Minister of Industry and Trade), Bulgak (Minister of Science and Technology), Adamov, Stepashin, Gazizullin, Shoigu, Sergeyev, Aksyonenko, Semyonov, Generalov, Frank, Zadornov, Krasheninnikov (the same positions). According to the Russian legislation, the ministers were appointed by the President. On May 12, 1999 Yeltsin sacked the government and Prime Minister and claimed that Primakov had failed to improve the economy after the 1998 Russian financial crisis. By then Primakov had become the most popular Russian politician. The real reason of the government reshuffle was considered linked to the upcoming start of impeachment hearings against Yeltsin in the State Duma (Primakov refused to fire ministers belonging to the Communist Party). ==Ministers== {| align=\"left\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"6\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 0 0 0 1em; background: #ffffff; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; text-align:left; font- size: 95%;\" |- style=\"text-align: center; background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" !Minister !Period of office |- | Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov | September 11, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | First Deputy Prime Minister for Economy and Finance Yury Maslyukov | September 11, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | First Deputy Prime Minister for Regions, Youth and Nationalities Vadim Gustov | September 18, 1998 - April 27, 1999 |- | First Deputy Prime Minister Nikolai Aksyonenko | May 12, 1999 |- | First Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin | April 27, 1999 - May 12, 1999 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Industry Vladimir Bulgak | September 16, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Agriculture and Ecology Gennady Kulik | September 21, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Welfare and Mass Media Vladimir Ryzhkov | September 16, 1998 - September 21, 1998 |- | Valentina Matviyenko | September 21, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Deputy Prime Minister for Finance Alexander Shokhin | September 16, 1998 - September 30, 1998 (resigned protesting against the reappointment of Zadornov as Finance Minister) |- | Minister for Antimonopoly Policy and Entrepreneurship Support Gennady Khodyrev | October 28, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister for Atomic Energy Yevgeny Adamov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of the Interior Sergei Stepashin | September 11, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of State Property Farit Gazizullin | September 28, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Emergencies Sergei Shoigu | September 11, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister for Commonwealth of Independent State Affairs Boris Pastukhov | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Health Vladimir Starodubov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of External Affairs Igor Ivanov | September 11, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Culture Vladimir Yegorov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Science and Technology Mikhail Kirpichnikov | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister for Nationalities Ramazan Abdulatipov | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Defence Igor Sergeyev | September 11, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Education Vladimir Filippov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Natural Resources Viktor Orlov | October 6, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Railways Nikolai Aksyonenko | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Regional Affairs Valery Kirpichnikov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Agriculture and Food Viktor Semyonov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Fuel and Energy Sergei Generalov | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Trade Georgy Gabunia | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Transport Sergei Frank | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Labor and Welfare Development Sergei Kalashnikov | September 30, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Finance Mikhail Zadornov | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Economy Andrei Shapovalyants | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Justice Pavel Krasheninnikov | September 25, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister of Taxes Georgy Boos | December 23, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |- | Minister, Chief of Staff of the Government Yury Zubakov | September 14, 1998 - May 12, 1999 |} ==References== Primakov Category:1998 establishments in Russia Category:1999 disestablishments in Russia Category:Cabinets established in 1998 Category:Cabinets disestablished in 1999 ",
