Lando Norris briefly battled Lewis Hamilton for 3rd place, and Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen ran as high as 4th. R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen held the position until lap 7, when he was passed by Sebastian Vettel, who had started 9th. By lap 9, Verstappen had recovered after his poor start, passing R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Norris. Kevin Magnussen pitted on lap 12, dropping him to the back, but was handed a drive-through penalty soon afterwards after the stewards found he had over-stepped his grid line at the beginning of the race and started too far forward. He would only recover one place during the race, and eventually crossed the finish line in 19th. Valtteri Bottas and Sebastian Vettel pitted on lap 22, with Bottas emerging in clear air in 4th, but with Vettel stuck behind Norris, R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen and Pierre Gasly in 8th after a communication issue saw his pit-stop take longer than expected. Leclerc pitted on the following lap, handing the lead of the race to Hamilton. At this stage of the race, the Mercedes cars were suffering from the high air and track temperatures. Hamilton repeatedly ran wide at turn 1, driving over the sausage kerb. This eventually caused damage to his front wing, forcing him to pit for a replacement on lap 31 and dropping him to 5th place. Verstappen inherited the lead, but pitted on the following lap; Leclerc thus regained 1st place. Verstappen emerged from the pits in 4th place, and began his charge towards the front. He passed Vettel on Lap 50, on the straight after turn 2. Vettel subsequently pitted on the following lap. Verstappen then passed Bottas into turn 2 on lap 56. Finally, he caught up with Leclerc at the front, passing him into turn 2 with three laps to go. On lap 69, Verstappen took a wide line through the corner on the inside of Leclerc, making contact and resulting in Leclerc leaving the track and driving over the kerb. Verstappen held on to his lead until the chequered flag, and the stewards later deemed his overtake legal. Vettel passed Hamilton on the final lap to take 4th place. Verstappen's victory marked the first win for a Honda-powered F1 car since Jenson Button in the 2006 Hungarian Grand Prix. The race was also the first race in the season not to be won by a Mercedes driver, as Valtteri Bottas finished in third and Lewis Hamilton fifth. Antonio Giovinazzi scored his first ever career points in Formula One by finishing tenth place. This also marked the first race in which every driver saw the chequered flag since the 2016 Japanese Grand Prix. === Race classification === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" |Driver ! scope=\"col\" |Constructor ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" |Time/Retired ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" |Points |- !1 | align=\"center\" |33 |data-sort- value=\"VER\" | Max Verstappen |Red Bull Racing-Honda |71 |1:22:01.822 | align=\"center\" |2 | align=\"center\" |26 |- !2 | align=\"center\" |16 |data-sort- value=\"LEC\" | Charles Leclerc |Ferrari |71 | +2.724 | align=\"center\" |1 | align=\"center\" |18 |- !3 | align=\"center\" |77 | data-sort-value=\"BOT\" | Valtteri Bottas |Mercedes |71 |+18.960 | align=\"center\" |3 | align=\"center\" |15 |- !4 | align=\"center\" |5 |data-sort-value=\"VET\"| Sebastian Vettel |Ferrari |71 |+19.610 | align=\"center\" |9 | align=\"center\" |12 |- !5 | align=\"center\" |44 |data-sort-value=\"HAM\"| Lewis Hamilton |Mercedes |71 |+22.805 | align=\"center\" |4 | align=\"center\" |10 |- !6 | align=\"center\" |4 |data-sort-value=\"NOR\"| Lando Norris |McLaren-Renault |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |5 | align=\"center\" |8 |- !7 | align=\"center\" |10 | data-sort- value=\"GAS\" | Pierre Gasly |Red Bull Racing-Honda |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |8 | align=\"center\" |6 |- !8 | align=\"center\" |55 | data-sort- value=\"SAI\" | Carlos Sainz Jr. |McLaren-Renault |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |19 | align=\"center\" |4 |- !9 | align=\"center\" |7 | data-sort-value=\"RAI\" | Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen |Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |6 | align=\"center\" |2 |- !10 | align=\"center\" |99 |data-sort-value=\"GIO\"| |Alfa Romeo Racing-Ferrari |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |7 | align=\"center\" |1 |- !11 | align=\"center\" |11 |data-sort-value=\"PER\"| Sergio P\u00e9rez || |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |13 | |- !12 | align=\"center\" |3 |data-sort-value=\"RIC\"| Daniel Ricciardo |Renault |70 | +1 lap |align=\"center\" |12 | |- !13 | align=\"center\" |27 |data-sort-value=\"HUL\"| Nico H\u00fclkenberg |Renault |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |15 | |- !14 | align=\"center\" |18 |data-sort-value=\"STR\"| Lance Stroll || |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |14 | |- !15 | align=\"center\" |23 |data-sort-value=\"ALB\"| Alexander Albon |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |18 | |- !16 | align=\"center\" |8 |data-sort- value=\"GRO\"| Romain Grosjean |Haas-Ferrari |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |11 | |- !17 | align=\"center\" |26 |data-sort-value=\"KVY\"| Daniil Kvyat |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |70 | +1 lap | align=\"center\" |16 | |- !18 | align=\"center\" |63 |data-sort-value=\"RUS\"| George Russell |Williams-Mercedes |69 | +2 laps | align=\"center\" data-sort-value=\"20\" | | |- !19 | align=\"center\" |20 |data- sort-value=\"MAG\"| Kevin Magnussen |Haas-Ferrari |69 | +2 laps | align=\"center\" |10 | |- !20 | align=\"center\" |88 |data-sort-value=\"KUB\"| Robert Kubica |Williams-Mercedes |68 | +3 laps | align=\"center\" |17 | |- class=\"sortbottom\" | colspan=\"8\" align=\"center\" |Fastest lap: Max Verstappen (Red Bull Racing- Honda) - 1:07.475 (lap 60) |- ! colspan=\"8\" |Source: |} ;Notes * \u2013 Includes one point for fastest lap. == Championship standings after the race == ;Drivers' Championship standings {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" ! ! !
