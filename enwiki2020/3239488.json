However, the young defender found first-team football at Highbury hard to come by, making only a few League Cup appearances for the club. The first of these League Cup appearances was as a substitute against Manchester United in November 2001, a game in which Halls was dismissed for two bookable offences. Like many Arsenal juniors, he was frequently loaned out; firstly to Colchester United in January 2002 where he made six first-team appearances. The player spent the entire 2002\u201303 season playing for KSK Beveren in Belgian First Division along with fellow Arsenal youngsters Graham Stack, Steve Sidwell and Liam Chilvers. These loans came about as part of an agreement between the two clubs which existed between 2001 and 2006. In October 2003, Halls was loaned out again, this time to Stoke City, making his debut in the home match versus Nottingham Forest on 4 October. ===Stoke City=== After impressing manager Tony Pulis during his loan spell Halls joined Stoke City on a permanent basis in December 2003 and spent a little over two years at the Britannia Stadium before his departure in January 2006. During this period he featured in a total of 66 games (plus eight whilst on loan) and scored two goals. Both of these goals were scored in consecutive matches during August 2005. The first came in a 4\u20132 defeat at Leicester City, whilst the second was notched in a 1\u20130 defeat of Millwall. Halls also accumulated a total of three red cards during his time at Stoke. His last appearance in a Stoke shirt was on 28 December 2005 at home to Leeds United.

Fellow Championship sides Crystal Palace and Southampton had both shown interest in signing Halls at the time.\"Halls' Royal Appointment\", BBC Sport, 19 January 2006.

Retrieved 21 July 2008 He had to bide his time until making his league bow in April 2006, against his former club, Stoke, he also scored in this game, helping Reading to a 3\u20131 victory. The player found his first team chances limited after Reading's promotion in 2006. In the 2006\u201307 season he did not make a single Premier League appearance, having to settle for two League Cup appearances. His chances of breaking into the first team were hampered by an achilles injury which plagued him throughout the season. Halls' one and only Premier League appearance to date was away at Bolton Wanderers in August 2007. This was followed by two more League Cup run-outs, one of which was a game at home to Liverpool in which Halls scored. As first team opportunities again proved scarce at the Madejski Stadium he was loaned out on three separate occasions in the 2007\u201308 season. Halls was loaned out to Championship sides Preston North End, Crystal Palace,and Sheffield United making a handful of appearances for each. Despite Reading's relegation into the Championship, Halls was released by the club on 16 May 2008. During his two and a half-year stay at Reading he made eight first-team appearances, the majority of which came in cup competitions. He also scored two goals, one each in the Championship and the League Cup. On 19 July, Halls featured in a pre- season match for Blackpool, with whom he was on trial.
