Since its foundation in 1992, the foundation has grown from one residential treatment centre for adolescents to a broad range of initiatives, from four residential treatment centres for adolescents with drug and alcohol problems (PALM: Programme for Adolescent Life Management), to adolescent life management aftercare, family and adolescent counselling on an 'outclient' basis, schools counselling, indigenous counselling, an outreach/educational project called 'Street University' and a number of Social Enterprise endeavors such as fashion- oriented op-shops and 'Gideon's Shoes,' dealing in design, manufacture and retailing. ==History== The organisation was born out of its predecessor, The Wayside Foundation, which was established by the Rev.Ted Noffs in 1970 and renamed The Ted Noffs Foundation in 1992 to recognise the work of its founder. As early as 1969 Noffs had written, 'To the traditional hazards that adolescents have to face- in terms of adjustment to members of the opposite sex, separation from the family unit, finding a job, seeking a new area of accommodation, finding meaning and purpose in life- there must be added the new one of overcoming the trauma of exposure to drugs.'The Wayside Chapel, Ted Noffs Pp. 154-155, Collins, 1969 Since that time the organisation has expanded considerably, establishing a leading role in drug and alcohol services in NSW and the ACT. ==Services== The following are the programs run by the Organization. ===PALM (Programme for Adolescent Life Management).=== This programme now comprises four residential programmes in Sydney, Coffs Harbour and Dubbo in NSW and in Watson, ACT. These programmes are run on the basis of the therapeutic community model, augmented for the treatment of adolescents suffering the effects of drug and/or alcohol misuse and the many socio- psychological determinants and consequences of this problem PALM residences are 'client-centred' insofar as the clinical and therapeutic aspects of the programme are tailored to meet the needs of the individual, which are not homogeneous. A spectrum of therapeutic strategies exists in the residences including individual counselling, group counselling, vocational/educational modules and recreation. ===CO-OP (Community Outreach and Outclient Programme).=== This project commenced operation in 2005 in the ACT to provide a suite of flexible community-based services to assist young people aged 12 to 18 years of age who are experiencing the effects of problematic drug/alcohol use. This is a non-residential, 'outclient' initiative. Overall, the aims are to provide information on, and refer clients to, available services; to advocate on behalf of clients, provide them with counselling and, wherever appropriate, their families, and to reduce or eliminate substance abuse and related difficulties amongst young people. An outclient project run from its offices in Mt Druitt, NSW, this entity provides a number of schools programmes, individual and family counselling, and takes counselling services and schools programmes to indigenous communities in the surrounding areas. ===Outclient counselling services=== An 'outclient' and 'outreach' project working from its offices at Mt Druitt, this entity provides a number of schools programmes and individual and family counselling locally and to surrounding areas, including indigenous communities. For the latter an indigenous family and schools counsellor is employed. The aim of the Outclients Counselling Services is to effect a strategy of early intervention in drug and alcohol abuse problems amongst young people aged between 12-25yrs. Schools counselling provides education and skills to enhance students' ability to adopt a discerning point of view in relation to such activities and, if affected, to reduce or stop their intake altogether. A by-product is a decrease in school dropout rates. Individual and family counselling provides support and advice on a more personal level in the instances when this is desired. ===Street University=== Situated in Liverpool, NSW, this is a recently begun initiative, having opened in 2008. It represents an engagement of the community in situ. Created in a renovated warehouse, the premises now include a multimedia room, a recording studio, counselling rooms, class/lecture rooms, offices, a multi-purpose sports court, a library and a cafe. The combination of leisure and educational activities is designed for socially, educationally and economically marginalised young people who are vulnerable to drug/alcohol abuse, crime and other anti-social phenomena. The range of components that Street University provides includes numeracy and literacy classes, homework help, educational courses and lectures, music and art facilities, sports and social activities and counselling when desired. The project is attended by increasing numbers of young people from many cultural/ethnic backgrounds in Sydney's West. ===ADWU (Adolescent Drug Withdrawal Unit)=== Operating in Watson, ACT, this is a two-week residential detoxification unit for adolescents. It can function either as a withdrawal unit for young people suffering the effects of prolonged use of highly addictive substances such as opioids, or simply a professionally supervised two-week drug-free break from more intermittent but nonetheless problematic drug/alcohol use. ===ASK!=== This is a free legal service providing advice to young people between the ages of 14\u201321 years. The project functions in conjunction with King & Wood Mallesons. ==Partnerships== Ted Noffs Foundation partners with Caretakers Cottage, a South Eastern Sydney-based youth homelessness non-governmental organisation. The partnership commenced as a response to the New South Wales Government \"Going Home Staying Home\" reforms, first initiated under then Minister for Family and Community Services (FaCS), Pru Goward.\"The Year in Highlight.\" Annual Report 2014. Ted Noffs Foundations. Accessed 27 May 2015. Ted Noffs and Caretakers Cottage jointly tendered for a multi-purpose youth homelessness funding under the Going Home Staying Home reforms. The partnership allowed for the full implementation of the reform along with the elements of previous tenders. The partnership has enabled Ted Noffs to provide crisis accommodation with the added focus of drug & alcohol and lifestyle issues.Matthews, Laurie. \"Opening Address.\" Caretakers Cottage - \u201cGoing Home Staying Home\u201d \u2013 Launch.
