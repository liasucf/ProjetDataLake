S\u00e1mi Die\u0111ala\u0161 \u00c1ige\u010d\u00e1la (which translates from Northern S\u00e1mi into English as \"S\u00e1mi Scientific Journal\") was first published in 1994. Starting in 2004, S\u00e1mi Die\u0111ala\u0161 \u00c1ige\u010d\u00e1la was published once per year, and since 2010 mostly twice per year.

S\u00e1mi Die\u0111ala\u0161 \u00c1ige\u010d\u00e1la was the first peer- reviewed scientific publication founded to publish in S\u00e1mi languages, primarily Northern S\u00e1mi, and it is the most common outlet for S\u00e1mi University and University of Troms\u00f8 scholars looking to publish in that language.
