    "text": "Cheese is a GNOME webcam application, i.e. an application to handle UVC streams. It was developed as a Google Summer of Code 2007 project by Daniel G. Siegel. It uses GStreamer to apply effects to photos and videos. It can export to Flickr and is integrated into GNOME. It was officially added to GNOME in version 2.22. Guvcview does not use GStreamer. ==Overview== The webcam application started off as a way to take photos with a webcam, which could then easily be shared. It has gained features and usage and can now can be used in many ways that were not possible at its release. Cheese can record photos as well as video, and can use a timer before shooting as well as taking pictures in burst mode. Version 2.28 brought the ability to switch between multiple webcams with one click. The application has built-in sharing so that photos or videos can be uploaded to photo-sharing sites or used on a computer. It also has many different effects that can be applied to photos. ===Effects=== * Mauve * Noir/Blanc * Saturation * Hulk * Vertical Flip * Horizontal Flip * Shagadelic * Vertigo * Edge * Dice * Warp ==See also== * Comparison of webcam software * Guvcview ==References== ==External links== * Category:Free communication software Category:Free software programmed in Vala Category:GNOME Applications Category:Software that uses GStreamer Category:Video software that uses GTK Category:Webcams ",
