    "text": "The SuperUtes Series (known for commercial reasons as the ECB SuperUtes Series) is an Australian utility racing competition that was launched in 2018 as a successor to the V8 Ute Racing Series. The series is owned and operated by the Supercars Championship and its events are held as a support category to Supercars events throughout Australia. ==Background== The V8 Ute Racing Series, which ran from 2001 to 2017, used utility vehicles based on the Ford Falcon and Holden Commodore models. However, with production of the Falcon and Commodore finishing in 2016 and 2017 respectively, utility vehicles were no longer being mass produced in Australia, which led to investigations into a new platform for the Utes series as far back as the early 2010s. While an initial plan was proposed to continue with a generic utility chassis, the Supercars Championship purchased the series in 2015 and pursued a move to a production-based series which would move away from the traditional formula. After several delays, it was announced in 2016 that SuperUtes, based on production dual-cab diesel-powered utilities, would be introduced in 2018. ==History== The inaugural season launched at the 2018 Adelaide 500 with ten cars entered, representing five manufacturers in Ford, Holden, Mazda, Mitsubishi and Toyota. Isuzu would later join the championship while Dakar Rally winner Toby Price was amongst the entries in a Mitsubishi Triton. The first race for the new category was won by Ryal Harris, a three time championship winner in V8 Utes, who went on to win the championship in a Mazda BT-50. The new championship drew some criticism due to the small field sizes and slower lap times than V8 Utes. The higher centre of gravity also saw some SuperUtes roll over, most notably at the Queensland Raceway round in 2018 and Adelaide Street Circuit in 2019, where two vehicles rolled during each event. This led to various technical upgrades for the cars during the 2019 season, including lowered ride heights and a move to a race-specification Yokohama tyre. The series announced further changes for the 2020 season, with the turbo diesel engine to be replaced by a petrol V8 engine in an attempt to reconnect with fans of the V8 Utes era. The ownership of the series also transferred from Supercars Championship to the team owners themselves. ==Champions== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 87%;\" ! Year ! Winner ! Car !
