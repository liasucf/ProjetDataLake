    "text": "Greatest Hits is the twelfth album by country singer Trisha Yearwood. The album is the final album released during Yearwood's association with the record company MCA, after she signed to Big Machine Records in early 2007. The album is composed of hits from her 16-year tenure with MCA, and features two previously unreleased tracks, \"Just a Cup of Coffee\" and \"Nothin' to Lose.\" Both of these songs were recorded for Yearwood's 2005 album, Jasper County, but were not included on the album and are, as such, represented here as unfinished studio cuts. \"Nothin' to Lose\" was eventually recorded by fellow artist and former MCA labelmate, Reba McEntire, for her 2009 album Keep on Loving You. The album sold 22,000 copies in its first week, debuting at #22 on the US Billboard 200 chartKatie Hasty, \"Album Sales Down 9% Despite Huge Kanye, 50 Tallies\", Billboard.com, September 19, 2007. and at #2 on the Country Album chart.
