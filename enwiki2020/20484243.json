There were 148 teams in the open event and 115 in the women's event. In total, 1306 players were registered.Chess Olympiad 2010, Chessdom.com This was the fourth time Russia organized the Chess Olympiad after 1956 (Soviet Union), 1994, and 1998. Six cities had submitted bids to organize the Olympiad: Khanty-Mansiysk, Budva, Buenos Aires, Pozna\u0144, Riga, and Tallinn. The selection was part of the FIDE Congress held during the 37th Chess Olympiad in Turin in 2006. The main events in both competitions were held in indoor tennis courts, which opened in September 2008. With an area of , it hosted 3,500 chess fans. Both tournament sections were officiated by international arbiter Sava Stoisavljevi\u0107 (Serbia). For the second time, the number of rounds of the Swiss system was 11 with accelerated pairings. Both divisions were played over four boards per round, with each team allowed one alternate for a total of five players. The final rankings were determined by match points. In the event of a draw, the tie- break was decided by 1. Deducted Sonneborn-Berger; 2. Game points; 3. Deducted sum of match points.FIDE Handbook Retrieved on 2012-09-05. The time control for each game permitted each player 90 minutes their first 40 moves and 30 minutes for the rest of the game, with an additional 30 seconds increment for each player after each move, beginning with the first. The rule introduced at the previous Olympiad, according to which no draws by agreement were permitted before 30 moves, was once again abolished. ==Open event== The open division was contested by 148 teams representing 141 nations. Russia, as hosts, fielded no less than five teams, whilst the International Braille Chess Association (IBCA), the International Physically Disabled Chess Association (IPCA), and the International Committee of Silent Chess (ICSC) each provided one squad. Senegal were signed up, but did not turn up for their first round match and were disqualified. Ukraine, led by Vasyl Ivanchuk and former FIDE Champion Ruslan Ponomariov, took their second title after 2004. Once again, the Russian hosts were the pre-tournament favourites but, for the fourth Olympiad in a row, failed to live up to expectations, although they came close this time. Captained by former World Champion Vladimir Kramnik, the Russians trailed the Ukrainians by one point before the last round. When Ukraine and eventual bronze medallists Israel, led by Boris Gelfand, drew their final match, Russia had the opportunity to snatch the gold. They only drew as well, however, so in the end had to settle for silver. Although the Russian \"A\" team disappointed its fans on its home turf, the \"B\" squad, with five Olympic debutants, exceeded expectations by finishing sixth. Captain Ian Nepomniachtchi won an individual bronze medal on the top board. Defending champions Armenia had to settle for seventh place and Team United States for ninth. India was once again without reigning World Champion Viswanathan Anand and finished 18th, while his opponent in the recent championship match, Veselin Topalov, led Bulgaria to 31st place. Another former great power of chess, England, also disappointed in 24th place. The number one player in the world, Magnus Carlsen, only scored 4\u00bd points in 8 games, and his Norwegian team ended up in 51st place. Due to financial disagreements with the national federation, the top German players did not show up. Seriously weakened, Team Germany came recorded an all-time low in 64th place, just below the team of physically impaired players. Incidentally, the IPCA team were led by Thomas Luther, a former four-time Olympian for the German team. :{| class=\"wikitable\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" |Open event ! # !! Country !! Players !!

Each of the four Israeli players was thus awarded a technical victory.Round 2 Olympiad Games now up, The Week in chess, 2010 Three French players were caught in a scheme to use a computer program to decide moves. Their plan involved one player, Cyril Marzolo (IM), following the tournament at home and using the computer program to decide the best moves. He would send the moves by text message to the captain of the French team, Arnaud Hauchard (GM), who would then stand or sit at various tables as a signal to the player S\u00e9bastien Feller (GM) to make a certain move. Feller and Marzolo were given five year suspensions for this, while Hauchard was given a lifetime suspension. None of the other players on the French team knew of this or were involved. ==Notes== ==External links== *39th Chess Olympiad: Khanty-Mansiysk 2010 OlimpBase *Official site *Chess Olympiad 2010 details *Venue *Open section *Women's section Category:Chess Olympiads Category:Women's Chess Olympiads Category:Chess in Russia Olympiad Chess Olympiad Category:Sport in Khanty-Mansiysk ",
