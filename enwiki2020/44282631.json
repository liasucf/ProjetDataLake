    "text": "Academic ranks in Germany are the titles, relative importance and power of professors, researchers, and administrative personnel held in academia. ==Overview== Appointment grades * (Pay grade: W3 or W2) * (W3) * (W2) * (W2, only in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) \u2013 although paid like a professor appointed at level W2, lecturers in this position do not have a professor title; the term was formerly used in all states for senior lecturer positions with research and teaching responsibilities (C2, being phased out since 2002) * (not tenured, only rarely with tenure track) (W1) * (not tenured) (W1, only in Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg) * or (A13, A14, A15) * (TV\u00f6D 13/14/15, TvL 13/14/15) * (TV\u00f6D, TvL A13 a. Z.) * (TV\u00f6D, only in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg) * (TdL) * (TdL) Non-appointment grades * * \u2013 conferred, in some German states, to a Privatdozent who has been in service for several years, without formally being appointed as professor. Administrative ranks * \u2013 rector or president, highest representative of the university or Polytechnic, elected * \u2013 prorector or vice president, elected * \u2013 chancellor, administrative head, often a permanent job * \u2013 dean, elected * \u2013 head of department, elected ==Faculty== In the 20th century, after their doctorate, German scholars who wish to go into academia usually work toward a Habilitation by writing a second thesis, known as the . This is often accomplished while employed as a or (\"scientific assistant\", E13) or in a non- tenured position as (\"assistant professor/lecturer\", both 3+3 years teaching and research positions). Once they pass their Habilitation, they can work as and are eligible for a call to a chair. Since 2002 many paths may lead to a full professorship. One can reach a professorship at a university by habilitation, a successful evaluation as a junior professorship (after 5 years), a tenure track period (6 years) or equivalent performance. In engineering this is often attained through expert knowledge in the industry, and in natural science often by the number and quality of publications. While universities and (\"Universities of Applied Sciences\") do not have the same legal status, there are no formal differences in academic ranks except a higher teaching load in the Fachhochschulen as they have no research mandate. Since a new salary scheme was introduced in 2005, both types of universities can appoint W2 as well as W3 professors. In general, a professor at a has not gone through the process of habilitation or junior professorship; they also cannot supervise dissertations. Instead, a doctorate and at least three years of work experience in research and development outside academia are required. Usually, a professor at a university of applied science is more focused on teaching while a professor at a traditional university is more focused on research. In Germany it has been debated whether is a title that one may retain for life once it has been conferred (similar to the doctorate), or whether it is linked to an office and ceases to belong to the holder once the professor quits or retires (except in the usual case of becoming Professor emeritus). The latter view has won the day\u2014although in many German states, there is a minimum requirement of five years of service before \"Professor\" may be kept as a title\u2014and is by now both the law and majority opinion. ===Main positions=== * Professor (Prof.): Since about 2002 the standard title for full professors at universities in Germany. * Professor ordinarius (ordentlicher Professor, o. Prof., Univ. Prof.): professor with chair, representing the branch of science in question. In Germany, it was common to call these positions in colloquial use \"C4\" professorships, due to the name of the respective entry in the official salary table for Beamte (civil servant). (Following recent reforms of the salary system at universities, you might now find the denomination \"W3 professor.\") Today in most German federal states this title is obsolete for restaffing. Since 2002 all full professors at universities and applied universities are called \"professor\". In some federal states like Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg it is still possible for a professor at a university to apply for the title \"Univ. Prof.\" under special conditions.vgl. Zweites Gesetz zur \u00c4nderung hochschulrechtlicher Vorschriften von Baden- W\u00fcrttemberg vom 1. Januar 2005, Artikel 17, \u00a7 15 * Professor extraordinarius (\"extraordinary professor\", au\u00dferordentlicher Professor, ao. Prof.): professor without chair, often in a side-area, or being associated with a professor with a chair. In many states of Germany this is a special title, which gives full rights as for a full professor (such as supervision of PhD and habilitation, participation in all professorial meetings, right for a special opinion for a dissertation in its field of specialization etc. etc.). These positions are tenured and typically paid according to the W2 salary scale. In Prussia before the First World War, the average salary of full professors (\"Ordinarius\") was double that of associate professors and up to nine times that of professors at the beginning of their careers. * Professor emeritus (Prof. em.): just like in North America (see above); used both for the ordinarius and for the extraordinarius, although strictly speaking only the former is entitled to be addressed in this way. Although retired and being paid a pension instead of a salary, a Prof. em. may still teach, give exams and often still have an office. * Junior Professor (Jun.-Prof.): this position started in 2002 in Germany, this is a 6-year time-limited professorship for inexperienced young scholars without Habilitation. It is supposed to rejuvenate those who are eventually supposed to become professors ordinarius in other institutions. The concept is intensely debated due to a lack of experience with this new approach. The main criticism is that Juniorprofessors are expected to apply for professorships at other universities during the latter part of the six- year period, as their universities should not offer tenure themselves (unlike in the tenure track schemes used, e.g., in the USA). The number of academics appointed as 'junior professors' in Germany has risen from ca. 900 in 2008 to ca. 1600 in 2014. Increasingly, the junior professorship is replaced by the tenure track model similar to that in the US, where a scholar without habilitation is hired and will get tenure (W2 or W3) after successful evaluation. ===Other positions=== * Honorarprofessor (Hon.-Prof.): equivalent to the Dutch Extraordinary Professor, non-salaried. An honorary title (not related to any sort of honorarium) conferred upon the person by a university for particular merits, often earned outside university or through long-term commitments (e.g., continued teaching) at the institution that confers the title. A Hon.-Prof. is obligated to lecture on a small scale. However, this is sometimes circumvented by title holders, especially since the title became popular among executives. * au\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfiger Professor (apl. Prof. or Prof.): either a tenured university lecturer or a former Privatdozent to whom the title is awarded after a time during which she or he has done excellent research. The word au\u00dferplanm\u00e4\u00dfig (supernumerary) literally means \"outside of the plan\" and denotes that no pay is associated with the position (apl. Prof. might be employed as researchers with the university, however, but they might also be employed outside of the university system). As a member of the faculty he or she is obligated to lecture and conduct examinations and has the right to supervise doctoral theses. * Privatdozent (Priv.-Doz. or PD): member of a faculty who has passed the Habilitation; this title may also be awarded to a former Juniorprofessor and is comparable to the English-American assistant or adjunct professor. A Privatdozent is obligated to lecture and conduct examinations (often without pay) in order to keep the title and is allowed to supervise doctoral theses. * Lehrbeauftragter a paid part-time (for example 2 hrs per week in a semester) teaching position for scientists in general with non university position who often hold a doctorate; Lehrbeauftragter is sometimes comparable with an adjunct assistant professor or an adjunct associate professor (US). It is not considered a professor position in Germany. * Vertretungsprofessor: is an interim professor who officially represents a vacant chair or professorship for a limited amount of time, mostly 1 or 2 semesters. Very often a completed Habilitation is required. It is comparable with visiting associate professor (US). Some academics use this job as a changeover position before getting this particular job in a tenured way or before getting a tenured professorship at another institution. * Gastprofessoren: A visiting scholar. If he or she lectures he or she is sometimes also called a visiting professor. Further, a visiting scholar can also work as a Vertretungsprofessor. * Seniorprofessor (distinguished senior professorship): A special arrangement where a professor close to retirement is freed from the requirement to lecture and does only research. His or her salary is already paid from the pension fund, as if he or she retired early, and part of his previous regular salary is often used to hire a young successor to gradually take over the Seniorprofessor's work. ===Other professors=== Some other uses of the title professor: * Employment title outside the universities: In Germany, some civil servants like directors of certain public museums or research-oriented public institutions bear an employment title which contains the word 'Professor'. Examples: \"Pr\u00e4sident und Professor des Bundesinstituts f\u00fcr Risikobewertung\" (\"President and Professor of the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment\"), \"Pr\u00e4sident und Professor der Stiftung Deutsches Historisches Museum\" (\"President and Professor of the Foundation German Historic Museum\").Bundesbesoldungsordnung B * Gymnasialprofessor (Professor at Gymnasium): In some German states, senior teachers at Gymnasium, which is a type of secondary school, were also designated Professor in the late 19th and early 20th century. In Austria, tenured teachers at Gymnasium are still called Professor. ==In other countries== Similar or identical systems as in Germany (where a Habilitation is required) are in place, e.g., in Austria, the German-speaking part of Switzerland (however in Switzerland the term is used as a more general honorary title in the Universities of Applied Sciences, the Fachhochschulen), as well as in Poland, Slovakia, Hungary and Slovenia. In Poland, professor is an academic degree required to obtain the position of full (ordinary) professor. An extraordinary professorship is lower ranked, and does not require the professor title. In some countries using the German-style academic system (e.g. Austria, Finland, Sweden), Professor is also an honorific title that can be bestowed upon an artist, scholar, etc., by the President or by the government, completely independent of any actual academic post or assignment. ==See also== *Academic degree#Germany *Civil service in Germany ==References== Category:Academic ranks Category:Higher education in Germany Ranks ",
