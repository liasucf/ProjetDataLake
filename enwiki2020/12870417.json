Ltd The parish was created on the 1 April 1936 through the abolition of Cadney cum Howsham and Newstead. The parish boundary is defined by water on all sides, by the Old River Ancholme, Kettleby Beck and North Kelsey Beck. Within the parish, at Newstead on the River Ancholme, lies the site of the Gilbertine Holy Trinity Priory, founded by Henry II in 1171, and endowed with the island of Ancholme, and lands around Cadney and Hardwick. The priory was limited to 13 canons and lay brothers. It was surrendered in 1538 under the act of suppression. On the site of the priory stands Newstead Priory Farmhouse, which retains the remains of a Norman vaulted room and a Perpendicular window. The farm is Grade I listed. ==Notable people== The clergyman and ecologist Adrian Woodruffe-Peacock made his living here from 1891 onwards, the very rural and sparsely populated parish proving useful in his development as an ecologist. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Villages in the Borough of North Lincolnshire Category:Civil parishes in Lincolnshire ",
