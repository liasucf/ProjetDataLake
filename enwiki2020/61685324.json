Set in present-day London, Grainger stars as Detective Inspector Rachel Carey, who is assigned to arrest and charge United Kingdom Special Forces Lance Corporal Shaun Emery (Turner), who is looking to clear his name of a horrific crime supposedly captured by CCTV. The series premiered on BBC One on 3 September 2019, and received positive reviews from critics and audiences. It was announced in June 2020 that a second series had been commissioned. ==Premise== After being acquitted of a war crime in Afghanistan, former United Kingdom Special Forces Lance Corporal Shaun Emery finds himself accused of the kidnapping and murder of his barrister Hannah Roberts, backed by damning CCTV evidence. Whilst Emery works to clear his name, fast-tracked Detective Inspector Rachel Carey of Homicide and Serious Crime Command begins to uncover a complex conspiracy surrounding Emery, calling into question the validity of the footage. ==Cast== * Holliday Grainger as DI Rachel Carey * Callum Turner as Lance Corporal Shaun Emery * Cavan Clerkin as DS Patrick Flynn * Ben Miles as Commander Danny Hart * Paul Ritter as Marcus Levy * Sophia Brown as Karen * Famke Janssen as Jessica Mallory * Ginny Holder as DS Nadia Latif * Ron Perlman as Frank Napier * Lia Williams as DSU Gemma Garland * Ralph Ineson as DCI Alec Boyd * Barry Ward as Charlie Hall * Laura Haddock as Hannah Roberts * Nigel Lindsay as DSI Tom Kendricks * Tommy McDonnell as Matt, Sean Emery's best friend * Daisy Waterstone as Abigail, Rachel Carey's half-sister ==Production== ===Filming locations=== Production filmed interior scenes at Canterbury Prison, Kent, England doubling as HMP Gladstone, London for episode one.

Other interior scenes were filmed at the Printworks venue in Rotherhithe, and The Shard. ==Episodes== ==Reception== ===Critical response=== The series was reviewed positively by critics. On Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of 92% based on reviews from 39 critics. The Telegraph awarded the episode four stars, labelling the series as \"riveting\", and The Independent also awarded it four stars, designating it an \"intriguing, but rather flawed, sort of Big Brother thriller set in our contemporary world of digital snooping\". In his review in The Times James Jackson referred to the drama as a \"neatly structured thriller... clearly out to interrogate surveillance culture\", also awarding four stars. The Guardian was less enthusiastic, concluding it to be a \"twisty if lacklustre drama\", giving the opening episode only three stars out of five. Reviews improved over the course of the series, and the finale was highly praised by critics, with many drawing positive comparisons with the BBC's similar series Bodyguard which was broadcast around the same time the previous year. The Telegraph described it as a \"highly satisfying series finale\", whilst The Times critic James Jackson referred to the series as 'the thinking man's' Bodyguard: Sarah Hughes echoed these sentiments in her review of the finale in The Guardian, commenting that \"if there were any justice, everyone would be talking about The Capture right now\". She heralded the show as \"nuanced and complex\" and \"one of the most cleverly plotted dramas of recent years\", and the final episode as \"a refreshingly grownup hour of television\". The Capture was the most requested new show in 2019 on BBC iPlayer, with over 20 million requests for series 1. It was also the eighth most requested series overall in 2019. For his performance, Callum Turner received a nomination for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. == References == == External links == * * Category:BBC television dramas Category:English-language television shows Category:2019 British television series debuts Category:2010s British crime television series Category:2010s British drama television series Category:2010s British mystery television series Category:2020s British crime television series Category:2020s British drama television series Category:2020s British mystery television series Category:British thriller television series Category:Television series by Universal Television ",
