He also played in the Football League with Wolverhampton Wanderers, Hartlepool United and Oldham Athletic, before moving into Non-league football with Eastwood Town, Stalybridge Celtic, Worksop Town and Gainsborough Trinity. ==Career== Born in Hiller\u00f8d, Budtz became an instant hero in his first game for Doncaster Rovers when he replaced the injured Andy Warrington during a League Cup tie against Manchester City in September 2005. He saved two of the three penalties taken by the Premier League side during the shootout to send Doncaster into the next round (the first penalty, by Darius Vassell, hit the crossbar). His name was subsequently plastered all over local and national newspapers the following day and he also made several appearances on local TV news channels.Budtz unfazed by Man City stars, BBC Sport, 22 September 2005 Following his initial day of glory, he largely failed to progress though. Although he enjoyed a good run in the first team in the 2005\u201306 season, he was increasingly sidelined in Spring 2006.
