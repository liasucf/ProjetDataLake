By the middle of the decade, he was creating installations with his structured and organized system of objects and their symbolic associations. He arranged found objects that he had gathered during his travels around the world, channeling his passion and knowledge of antiquities through his work.Romanelli, Giandomenico (2005), Pilgrimage of Spiderman in Maurizio Pellegrin, Charta, Milano, Pellegrin has always been interested in the way objects transmit energy and how the memory of their use endures. He sees objects as the testimony of human life and artifacts of memory, as well as the remains of life after death. He ascribes meaning to his work based on the science of Numerology,Villa, Giuditta Pellegrin: Pop e Pitagora, Flash Art, Milano, March April, 1992Terrie Sultan.

His installations deal with the concept of space\u2013 both physically and philosophically\u2013 becoming universes organized by symbols and metaphors. The arrangements of objects and materials develop a new hierarchy in which their previous functions are drastically changed. Step by step, the capacity of communication and the inner power of the different elements (often wrapped by the artist to contain the energy) establish a new world of relations.Francesco Bonami, Dark Lantern in Writings on Maurizio Pellegrin 1980 - 2006, Skira., Milan, 2006 pp.78-81 Colors, which are always few, are then chosen for specific philosophical implications and psychological effects.Mac Adams, Alfred. Black and White Universe in Writings on Maurizio Pellegrin 1980 - 2006, Skira., Milan, 2006 pp.66-67 Pellegrin's wall arrangements and installations are characterized by a somber beauty, personal and historical references.

Pellegrin further developed his interest for the challenges given by the space, pre-existing energies, and history creating site-specific works also in historical museums, churches, palaces, and gardens throughout the world. The images of many of these site-specific works are collected in the books Maurizio Pellegrin - Reflection and Intention (1999)Caldura, Riccardo...et al., Maurizio Pellegrin: Reflection and Intentions, Arsenale Editrice, Venice, June 1999. and Maurizio Pellegrin by Alice Rubbini (2005).Rubbini, Alice.
