Anti Scl-70 antibodies are associated with more severe scleroderma disease. The etymology of scl-70 consists of an abbreviation of scleroderma and a 70 kD extractable immunoreactive fragment that can be obtained from the otherwise larger (100\u2013105 kD) target topoisomerase antigen (called the SCL-70 Antigen) of the antibodies.Product Name: SCL-70 Antigen at ImmunoVision.com, retrieved April 2011 ==References== Category:Autoantibodies ",
