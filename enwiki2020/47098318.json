Following the campaign, the Montreal Canadiens selected Vejdemo in the third round (87th overall) during the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. In the 2017\u201318 season, Vejdemo established career- highs of 10 goals and 22 assists in 47 games. On 2 May 2018, the Canadiens signed him to a two-year, entry-level contract.
