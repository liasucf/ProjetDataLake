It had a magnitude of 8.3 on the moment magnitude scale and a maximum perceived intensity of X (Extreme) on the Mercalli intensity scale. This event in the southern Philippines triggered a large tsunami, with a maximum run-up of 7.2 m, which affected the coasts of the Celebes Sea, causing widespread damage. The combined effects of the earthquake and the tsunami caused 52 casualties. The earthquake has been associated with the Cotabato Trench, the surface expression of an active east-dipping subduction zone beneath Mindanao. ==See also== *1897 Mindanao earthquakes *1976 Moro Gulf earthquake *List of earthquakes in 1918 *List of earthquakes in the Philippines ==References== ==External links== * Category:Earthquakes in the Philippines Category:1918 earthquakes Category:History of Sarangani Category:History of Sultan Kudarat Category:1918 tsunamis ",
