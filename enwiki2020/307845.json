    "text": "Cri\u0219ana region in Romania Cri\u0219ana (, ) is a geographical and historical region in north-western Romania, named after the Cri\u0219 (K\u00f6r\u00f6s) River and its three tributaries: the Cri\u0219ul Alb, Cri\u0219ul Negru, and Cri\u0219ul Repede. In Romania, the term is sometimes extended to included areas beyond the border, in Hungary; in this interpretation, the region is bounded to the east by the Apuseni Mountains, to the south by the Mure\u0219 River, to the north by the Some\u0219 River, and to the west by the Tisza River, the Romanian-Hungarian border cutting it in two. However, in Hungary, the area between the Tisza River and the Romanian border is usually known as Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal. Map of Crisana in Hungary and Romania == History == === Ancient history === In ancient times, this area was settled by Celts, Dacians, Sarmatians, and Germanic peoples. In the first century BC, it was part of the Dacian Kingdom under Burebista. === Middle Ages === Cri\u0219ana (\"Kaz\u00e1r-orsz\u00e1ga\" or Khazars' Land) in blue on a Hungarian map (from the 1890s) based on the Gesta Hungarorum In the Middle Ages, it was ruled by the Hunnic Empire, the Kingdom of the Gepids, the Avar Empire, the Bulgarian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary. Hungarian maps based on the Gesta Hungarorum call it Kaz\u00e1rorsz\u00e1g. The largest city in the region, Oradea (Hungarian: Nagyv\u00e1rad, BiUarad, Bihar), was most probably established during the early years of Hungarian rule. It is first mentioned in 1113 under the name \"Varadinum\" in a diploma belonging to Benedictine Zobor Abbey. The Romanian name Oradea originates from the Hungarian name V\u00e1rad, meaning \"fortified place\". The city was one of the most important cultural centres of the medieval Hungarian state: two Hungarian kings, Ladislaus I (1077-1095) and Sigismund (1387-1437) were buried there. After the canonization of Ladislaus I in 1192, his shrine at V\u00e1rad became a Catholic pilgrimage site. === Modern History === After the Battle of Moh\u00e1cs (1526), the region became part of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. In 1552, the Ottoman Empire occupied the southern part of Cri\u0219ana and included it in the newly established Teme\u015fvar Eyalet. According to the Treaty of Speyer (1570), the rest of Cri\u0219ana became part of the Principality of Transylvania, a successor state of the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. John Sigismund Z\u00e1polya abdicated as King of Hungary and in return, Maximilian II of Habsburg recognized John Sigismund's authority over the eastern territories of the Kingdom of Hungary. John Sigismund became princeps Transsylvaniae et partium regni Hungariae dominus \u2013 Prince of Transylvania and of a part of the Kingdom of Hungary (Partium). Cri\u0219ana was included in the Partium. Partium within the Principality of Transylvania in 1570 The Ottoman Varat Eyalet that was formed in the second half of the 17th century was centered on Cri\u0219ana. Since the end of the 17th century, the whole region became part of the lands of the Habsburg Monarchy and was administratively divided between the Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary, the Habsburg Principality of Transylvania and the Habsburg Military Frontier. Following the abolition of the Thei\u00df-Muresch section of the Habsburg Military Frontier (in 1750) and the abolition of the Principality of Transylvania in 1867, the whole area was included again into the Kingdom of Hungary, which was then part of the dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary. During Habsburg administration, Cri\u0219ana did not, on the whole, have special status such as that of Transylvania or the Banat; briefly, from 1850 to 1860, it was organized as the Military District of Gro\u00dfwardein. After disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, Cri\u0219ana was divided between Romania (eastern part) and Hungary (western part). ==Geography== Romanian Cri\u0219ana is bounded in Romania by Maramure\u0219 to the north, Transylvania proper to the east, Banat to the south, and Hungary to the west. The region consists of the current Romanian counties of Arad (most of it), Bihor and some parts of S\u0103laj, Satu Mare, parts of Maramure\u0219 County (Codru, Chioar) and Hunedoara counties. Nowadays it is sometimes considered part of the historical region Transylvania, although it did not fall fully within the boundaries of the historical principality. Hungarian K\u00f6r\u00f6svid\u00e9k is covered by the areas of Hajd\u00fa-Bihar County and B\u00e9k\u00e9s County. The southern part of Cri\u0219ana, near the Mure\u0219 River, was called Pomori\u0161je by the Serbs. ==Cities== The most important cities are: * Zal\u0103u, Oradea, Arad, Salonta, and Beiu\u0219 (in Romania) * Debrecen, B\u00e9k\u00e9scsaba, and Gyula (in Hungary) ==Gallery== File:Biserici-si-manastiri- sfanta-treime-centru-arad-small.jpg|Arad - Orthodox Cathedral File:TheaterArad.jpg|Arad - Ioan Slavici - Classic Theatre File:Arad- Belvaros.jpg|Arad - Administration Palace File:Piata Ferdinand.jpg|Oradea - The Ferdinand Square File:Medicina Oradea.jpg|Oradea - The Faculty of Medicine File:Oradea (Nagyv\u00e1rad) - pia\u0163a Unirii.JPG|Oradea - The Black Eagle Palace File:Catedrala Catolica.jpg|Oradea - Baroque Roman Catholic cathedral File:Oradea-Nagyv\u00e1rad - Cri\u015ful Repede and synagogue.jpg|Oradea - The Cri\u015ful Repede river File:Calvinist Cathedral.JPG|Salonta - Reformed Cathedral Image:RO BH Salonta Parcul din centru.JPG|Salonta - Orthodox Church File:ScoalaSalonta.JPG|Salonta - Arany Janos High School File:RO BH Salonta Alee parc.JPG|Salonta - The central park File:RO BH Salonta Locomotiva cu abur.JPG|Salonta - Train monument and the railway station File:Muzeul taranului.JPG|Salonta - The Peasantry Museum File:RO BH Salonta Consulat.JPG|Salonta - Consulate of Slovakia File:Bradet.peste sat.jpg|Wooden church in Br\u0103det ==See also== * Partium ==References== ==External links== Category:Historical regions of Transylvania Category:Historical regions in Hungary Category:Historical regions in Romania Category:Divided regions ",
