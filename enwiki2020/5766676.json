Braeburn is a community of subdivisions in southwest Houston, Texas along Brays Bayou west of Hillcroft Avenue and south of the Sharpstown community. The first of these middle class subdivisions was developed after World War II at a time when the Richmond Farm-to-Market Road (later renamed as Bissonnet Street) provided the route into the city, rather than U.S. Highway 59. Development continued into the 1970s. The Braeburn Country Club is located in the center of the community. Subdivisions found here include Robindell, Braeburn Terrace, Braeburn Glen, Larkwood, Braeburn Valley, Bonham Acres, Braes Timbers and--the acreage lot subdivision--Brae Acres. The area also includes commercial and multi-family developments. Braeburn is notable for its large number of mid-century modern homes, tree lined streets, and location close to the Galleria, the Texas Medical Center, Reliant Park, the major freeways- 59, 610 and the Beltway. The communities of Braeburn have in recent years formed the Braeburn Superneighborhood, a coalition of Home Owner Associations, in order to interact more effectively with the City of Houston and other area agencies. The Brays Bayou hike and bike trail runs through the community, providing easy access to over 15 miles of excellent trails. ==Fire service== This neighborhood is served by Fire Station 68 , located on the corner of Bissonnet and Gessner, next to Braeburn Glen Park and Lee LeClear Tennis center. ==Police service== The neighborhood is served by the Houston Police Department's Fondren Patrol Division, as well as the Beechnut substation .
