Ghomeshi was acquitted in 2016 of one count of choking and four counts of sexual assault, after over 20 women complained either to the police or in the media. The publication of the essay was controversial, in part, because Ghomeshi wrote that the allegations against him were \"inaccurate\". In an interview with Slate magazine, Buruma defended his decision to publish, and denied that the article was misleading because it had failed to mention that Ghomeshi had been required to issue an apology to one of the victims as part of the terms of a case against him. He also denied that the title, \"Reflections from a Hashtag\", was dismissive of the #MeToo movement; stated that the movement has resulted in \"undesirable consequences\"; and said: \"I\u2019m no judge of the rights and wrongs of every allegation. ... The exact nature of [Ghomeshi's] behavior \u2013 how much consent was involved \u2013 I have no idea, nor is it really my concern.\"Chotiner, Isaac. \"Why Did the New York Review of Books Publish That Jian Ghomeshi Essay?\", Slate, September 14, 2018 Buruma subsequently left The New York Review of Books amid \"outrage\" over his defense of the article.Pilkington, Ed. \"New York Review of Books editor Ian Buruma departs amid outrage over essay\", The Guardian, September 19, 2018Vanderhoof, Erin. \"How Ian Buruma\u2019s New York Review of Books Ouster Became Inevitable\", Vanity Fair, September 19, 2018O'Rourke, Meghan. \"What Magazines Can\u2019t Do in the Age of #MeToo\", The Atlantic, September 21, 2018 The Review later stated that it had departed from its \"usual editorial practices\", as the essay \"was shown to only one male editor during the editing process\", and that Buruma's statement to Slate about the staff of the Review \"did not accurately represent their views\".Williams, John. \"New York Review of Books Acknowledges 'Failures' in a #MeToo Essay\", The New York Times, September 24, 2018 Some commentators expressed fears that Buruma's exit threatened to inhibit the intellectual culture in the United States.Laura Kipnis, \"The Perils of Publishing in a #MeToo Moment\", The New York Times, 25 September 2018.
