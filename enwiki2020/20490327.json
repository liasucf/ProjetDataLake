    "text": "Yeduguri Sandinti Jaganmohan Reddy (born 21 December 1972), is an Indian politician serving as the 17th and current Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh. He is the founder and president of YSRCP. He was Leader of opposition in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Assembly from 19 June 2014 until 29 May 2019. He is the son of the former Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Jaganmohan Reddy started his political career by campaigning for Indian National Congress in the 2004 elections in Kadapa District, and in the 2009 elections he was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa constituency as a member of the Indian National Congress. After his father's sudden death, his popular Odarpu yatra tour led to his formation of the YSRCP in 2011. He led the party to several victories at both the state and national levels. However, he has been implicated in several high-profile corruption scandals. ==Personal life== Jaganmohan Reddy was born on 21 December 1972 in Kadapa district of Andhra Pradesh to Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy and Y. S. Vijayamma. He went to The Hyderabad Public School, up to 12th grade. He graduated with a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He married Bharathi Reddy on 28 August 1996. The couple has two daughters, the eldest of whom studied undergraduate in London. He is a Catholic Christian. He has a younger sister, Y. S. Sharmila, who is also a politician. ==Political career== Jaganmohan Reddy's father YS Rajasekhara Reddy popularly known as YSR, was a two-time Chief Minister of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh, serving from 2004 to 2009. Jaganmohan Reddy started his political career campaigning for Indian National Congress during the 2004 elections in Kadapa District. In 2009, Reddy was elected as Member of Parliament from Kadapa constituency. ===Post YSR's death=== Following the death of his father in Sep 2009, Jaganmohan Reddy started his earnest efforts to take up the political legacy left by his father. The majority of the legislators favored him to be appointed as the Chief Minister. Sonia Gandhi, party chief of the Indian National Congress and her son Rahul Gandhi, party general secretary did not agree to this. Six months after his father's death, he began an odarpu yatra (condolence tour) as promised earlier to go and meet the families of those alleged to have either committed suicide or suffered ill health on the news of his father's death. The Congress party's central leadership directed him to call off his odarpu yatra, an order which he defied leading to a fallout between the high command and himself. He went ahead with the yatra, stating that it was a personal matter. ===Founding YSR Congress=== On 29 November 2010, he resigned, after a fallout with the Congress party high command. He announced on 7 December 2010 from Pulivendula that he would be starting a new party within 45 days. In March 2011, he announced his party name at Jagganapeta of East Godavari district. Later, his party went to by polls in YSR Kadapa district and won almost all the seats with a huge majority. Reddy, as the president of YSR Congress, faced by-election from the Kadapa constituency and won by a large margin of 545,043 votes. ===2012 disproportionate assets case === The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has disclosed that Reddy, accepted Rs 1,172 crore from various investors as a bribe and in turn, helped them get favours from the state government. The favours are mainly land, mining leases, and licences for new industries. Reddy, Member of Parliament from Kadapa and late chief minister Y S Rajasekhara Reddy's son, was arrested by the investigating agency on 27 May in connection with a disproportionate assets case. A CBI special court in Hyderabad on 28 May remanded him to judicial custody for 14 days. He remained in the Chanchalguda Central Prison till 11 June. ====Arrest and 16 months in jail==== Reddy was arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation on embezzlement charges and his Judicial custody was extended repeatedly as the investigation proceeded. The Supreme Court also dismissed his petition on 4 July 2012, 9 August 2012, and on 13 May 2013. ====Other Congress ministers arrested for issuing orders==== In March 2012, the Supreme Court directed the CBI to extend their investigations to six ministers (Kanna Lakshminarayana, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, Sabita Indra Reddy, Ponnala Lakshmaiah, J Geetha Reddy and Dharmana Prasada Rao), and eight senior bureaucrats, who were implicated in issuing 26 Government orders that helped the companies investing in Reddy's firms. Andhra Excise minister Mopidevi Venkataramana was arrested on 24 May 2012. CBI also summoned BCCI chief N Srinivasan on 7 June 2012. As a sequel to allegations that CBI had selectively released information to the press to tarnish the image of Reddy, the Central Vigilance Commissioner sought a report on the matter from the investigating agency. ====Charges of political vendetta==== The YSR Congress and Reddy's family have been alleging a political conspiracy behind Reddy's investigations. BJP has noted that CBI has been pursuing this case with greater vigour than that of government-aligned politicians with similar charges such as Sushil Kumar Shinde or Vilasrao Deshmukh. ===Opposition to the formation of Telangana=== While in jail, Reddy started a hunger strike opposing the United Progressive Alliance's decision to endorse the creation of a separate Telangana state. After 125 hours of indefinite hunger strike, his sugar levels and blood pressure were down. He was moved to Osmania General Hospital for treatment. His mother, MLA Vijayamma, was also on hunger strike protesting the formation of Telangana out of AP. After his release, Reddy called for a 72-hour bandh protesting the formation of Telangana. Both Reddy and his mother resigned from their legislatures opposing the decision favoring the formation of Telangana === 2014 Election Defeat === In 2014, the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), was a pre- poll favourite among most analysts and psephologists. But, the YSRCP lost the 2014 elections, winning only 67 of 175 seats in the state assembly, with 45% of vote share. In the 2014 election, the Telugu Desam Party vote share went up to 47% and the 2% gap led to the defeat of YSRCP. === PrajaSankalpaYatra - Padayatra of more than 3,648 km === As a leader of the Opposition in Assembly and YSR Congress Party president, Reddy launched his 3,000-km-long walkathon named PrajaSankalpaYatra on 6 November 2017.
