Perhaps the biggest departure that Minerva Punjab was that of Chencho Gyeltshen. The Bhutanese attacker was the stand-out performer for Minerva in 2017 and was subsequently sold to Bengaluru FC. His departure left a huge gap in the Minerva squad. Following Chencho out of the door were Kiran Chemjong, Sukhdev Singh, Kamalpreet Singh, Bali Gagandeep, Kassim Aidara, Girik Khosla, Rakshit Dagar, and Abhishek Ambekar. Kamalpreet Singh, Gagandeep, Aidara, and Rakshit Dagar all signed for Minerva's title rivals East Bengal F.C.. Sukhdev Singh and Ambekar moved on to Mohun Bagan. Ahead of the 2018-19 I-League season, Minerva were left with a depleted squad. On 6 July 2018 Minerva Punjab signed forward Yu Kuboki on a permanent transfer from Australian club Sydney Olympic FC. He had been in scintillating form for Sydney the previous season, scoring 11 goals in 22 matches as an attacking midfielder or a withdrawn striker. In August 2018 Minerva signed three players including Nigerian forward Philip Njoku. In September 2018 they signed former Ozone FC striking duo C. S. Sabeeth and Brazilian Robert De Souza. They also extended contracts with defender Akashdeep Singh and striker Akash Sangwan. === Contract Extension === {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left\" !No. !scope=\"col\"|Position !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Date !scope=\"col\"|Ref |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Akash Sangwan | 6 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Akashdeep Singh | 9 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Amandeep Singh | 10 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Souvik Das | 14 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Deepak Devrani | 19 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| William Opoku | 21 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Arshdeep Singh | 22 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Arshpreet Singh | 23 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Bhaskar Roy | 26 September 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Randeep Singh | 1 October 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Rajan Negi | 9 October 2018 | |} === In === {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; text-align:left\" !No. !scope=\"col\"|Position !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Previous club !scope=\"col\"|Transfer fee !scope=\"col\"|Date !scope=\"col\"|Ref |- |10 | !scope=\"row\"| Yu Kuboki | Sydney Olympic FC |Free agent | 6 July 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Sandeep Rajput | MPFC winter Camp | Free agent |30 July 2018 | |- |4 | !scope=\"row\"| Philip Njoku | FC Inter Turku | Free agent |7 August 2018 | |- | | !scope=\"row\"| Liandala Fanai | Aizawl |Free agent |12 August 2018 | |- |7 | !scope=\"row\"| Hitova Ayemi | Fateh Hyderabad | Free agent | 25 August 2018 | |- |9 | !scope=\"row\"| C.
