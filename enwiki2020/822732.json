    "text": "The Oregon Vortex is a roadside attraction that opened to tourists in 1930, located on Sardine Creek in Gold Hill, Oregon, in the United States. It consists of a number of interesting effects, which are gravity hill optical illusions, but which the attraction's proprietors propose are the result of paranormal properties of the area. == Background == Prior to any construction of the area, local legend had it that Native Americans in the area referred to the site as a \"forbidden\" land, and travelers passing through would often find their horses refusing to go through the area. A gold assay office was built in the area in 1904 by the Old Grey Eagle Mining Company, which slid from its foundation in the early tens, coming to rest at an odd angle. In 1914 the outpost and assay house were rediscovered by a prospector named William McCollugh. McCollugh convinced his friend, geologist and engineer John Litster to come to the US from his birth place in Alva, Scotland. Litster says he researched the paranormal phenomena of the so-called 165-foot magnet radius. When Litster died in 1959, his wife sold the Oregon Vortex to Ernie and Irene Cooper. The Coopers' daughter Maria and grandson Mark kept the attraction open since then, making it one of Oregon's oldest examples of Roadside Americana. Odd angles create an illusion of objects seemingly rolling uphill. The same effect can be seen in The Montana Vortex and house of mystery, Pennsylvania's Laurel Caverns, and at Santa Cruz, California's Mystery Spot. Two UC Berkeley researchers studied the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot and published their conclusions in Psychological Science in 1999. They proposed that a framework called orientation framing which describes how the brain's visual processing uses spatial frames of reference. They noted similar illusions including the Ponzo illusion, the Z\u00f6llner illusion, the Poggendorf and W\u00fcndt-Hering illusions. James Randi, magician and illusionist, also described the Oregon Vortex (House of Mystery) as an optical illusion in 1998 using photography and mathematics to describe the illusion. Russ Donnelly, professor emeritus of physics at the University of Oregon visited the Oregon Vortex in 1966 and was convinced it was some sort of optical illusion. Owner Maria Cooper agreed with Donnelly that what people are seeing inside the House of Mystery is an optical illusion but insisted something else was happening outside the house that make people height appearing to grow and shrink depending on their location. Oregon Vortex is also famous for \"height change\" as the apparent relative height of two people varies, depending on where each stands.Oregon Vortex official website. Retrieved December 2008. The explanation of the strange phenomena is that they are caused by optical illusions. Distorted backgrounds that induce a forced perspective, as with an Ames room. Oregon No-Vortex Retrieved December 2008. The Oregon site also exhibits phenomena similar to those perceived by visitors at the mystery spot located outside St. Ignace in the upper peninsula of Michigan. == In popular culture == * The site was investigated on a second season episode of the SyFy reality show Fact or Faked: Paranormal Files, and although there seemed to be a small debate between the show's investigators over the \"height change\" phenomenon, they ultimately concluded that overall, all of the effects demonstrated were optical illusions. * It was also mentioned on season 3, episode 11 (\"Mystery Spot\"), of The CW's Supernatural by Jared Padalecki's character, Sam Winchester. * The Oregon Vortex was featured in a 1999 episode of X-Files. * The attraction is the inspiration for the Mystery Shack, a tourist trap and the main setting for the Disney Channel (later Disney XD) original series Gravity Falls. * The Oregon Vortex continues to attract visitors from around the world whether it is an optical illusion or some phenomena that bend light, defy gravity and/or alter mass is not understood. ==See also== * Mystery Spot, a similar attraction in Santa Cruz, California ==References== ==External links== *Oregon Vortex, Official website *SyFy Channel - Fact Or Faked: Paranormal Files *Oregonians for Science and Reason - Investigation (with pictures illustrating illusions and an animated Ponzo demonstration) *New York Times Travel Section Article *Dark Destinations - The Oregon Vortex Category:Buildings and structures in Jackson County, Oregon Category:Gravity hills Category:Paranormal places in the United States Category:Roadside attractions in Oregon Category:Tourist attractions in Jackson County, Oregon ",
