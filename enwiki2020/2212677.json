The popular myth is that the two industrialists, with no formal aerodynamics training, set about designing a single-seat aircraft with some spare plywood and a small engine, a Poinsard 25hp 2-cyl. The result was the 1948 D9 B\u00e9b\u00e9 (Baby) model. In fact, the two had much experience of building and designing aircraft, Delemontez being a trained aeronautical engineer, and Joly having built an aircraft before the war. The French government bought many of the aircraft, with more than 500 D9s being built during the next twenty years. Subsequently, the government expressed interest in a larger aircraft as a trainer and the two-seat D11 model followed in 1950. Jodel aircraft are all-wood, usually made from Sitka spruce and plywood made out of okoume (also known as gaboon), a kind of West African hardwood. Most of the designs are recognisable by their distinctive wings, which have \u2018cranked\u2019 dihedral only on the outer third. The wings also incorporate washout, retaining aileron effectiveness at or just prior to the stall. From above or below, the wings are also distinctive as this cranked section of the wing tapers sharply towards the wingtip. The design is popular in France and in Southern Europe, UK, but the type is little known in the USA. In Australia, the design has been brought up to date somewhat by Frank Rogers who produced new drawings to standards suited to Australian amateur builders. ==Production under license== Apart from prototypes, Jodels were made by a variety of French aviation manufacturers, but all construction ceased during the 1960s. Since that time, the Jodel company only sells licences to build its models and detailed plans to amateur builders of homebuilt aircraft. The Jodel designs were later licensed to the following companies which produced derivative designs that retained the Jodel wing: * Avions Robin, France *Aero Difusi\u00f3n, Spain *Falconar Avia, Canada ==Aircraft== The first model was built in 1948.
