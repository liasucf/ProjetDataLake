    "text": "Kre\u0161evo () is a town and municipality located in Central Bosnia Canton of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Kre\u0161evo is a mountainous town, located in a narrow valley of the Kre\u0161evka river, under the slopes of Mount Bitovnje. An old Franciscan monastery of St. Catharine is located in the town's outskirts. ==History== ===Antique period=== The area of Kre\u0161evo was inhabited since the Neolithic period. Various material remains are indicating that a life in Kre\u0161evo was intensified during the Roman Empire, when the municipality was part of the Roman province of Illyrcicum, as well as during the Migration Period. Reason for this are the subsoil assets of the Kre\u0161evo Municipality area, where gold, silver, copper, iron and mercury where exploited. A number of the Roman aqueducts can be found on the area of the Kre\u0161evo Municipality, as well as remains of the Roman settlement near the village of Zid. During the destruction of the old Kre\u0161evan church in 1964, a number of the romanesque capitals were found in its walls from the period of 11th and 12th century. A Roman epigraphic monument was also found, in which an anonymous Roman municipium is mentioned. During the Roman period, there were two connection roads to the Via Argentaria, one of them led to an area near Sarajevo, and the other led towards the Visoko area. ===Medieval period=== The largest development of the Kre\u0161evo area occurred during the period of the Bosnian Kingdom. The first written mention of Kre\u0161evan silver, copper and lead mines dates to 1381. When the Saxons arrived in Bosnia, the technology of extracting and ore processing was significantly developed. They brought legal norms called the \"Saxons' laws\" and modern technology. However, the biggest rise of the Kre\u0161evo area occurred when it became one of the seats of the Bosnian kings. The first mentioning of the town of Kre\u0161evo was in a charter of King Stephen Thomas from 12 August 1434. The King mentioned Kre\u0161evo as a \"royal town of Kre\u0161evo\". During that time, the Kingdom of Bosnia had an intensive cooperation with the Republic of Ragusa. On 3 September 1444, King Stephen Thomas approved trade privileges to the Ragusans in Kre\u0161evo. The remains of the royal town are preserved until today. The royal town is surrounded by ramparts, () so the area was named Bedem after them. In honor of Queen Catherine of Bosnia, a chapel was built in the Bedem in 1996. The royal town had suburbs in which craft, commerce and mining boroguhs developed. The ramparts remained functional after the Ottoman conquest, as they were mentioned in 1469 as a Turkish fortress. Ragusans, who had their colony in Kre\u0161evo, held there a customs office and led the entire mining trade. Along with Kre\u0161evo, De\u017eevice had also great significance in this period. Today, De\u017eevice are one of the Kre\u0161evan villages. De\u017eevice were mentioned for the first time in 1403 as one of the seat of the Bosnian king. During the medieval period, De\u017eevice were had important lead, silver and iron mines, as well as a market town and a Ragusan colony. Customs in De\u017eevice were mentioned for the first time in 1408. Knyaz of the market town named Pavle, was mentioned for the first time in 1412, and other knyazes were mentioned later, among them Knyaz Milutin Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 in 1422 and Knyaz Milivoj in 1425. De\u017eevice was a seat of a Franciscan Order who had a monastery there. ===Ottoman Empire=== The Ottomans conquered Kre\u0161evo in 1463, but Ragusans remained tenants of the customs office for some time. During the Ottoman Empire, Kre\u0161evo was a centre of a nahiyah, that was mentioned for the first time in 1469. At first, the Kre\u0161evo Nahiyah was a part of the kadiluk of Bobovac. In that year, the Kre\u0161evan fortress, bazaar and silver mines were mentioned, along with assisting miners in De\u017eevice and Dusina. Kre\u0161evo fortress was mentioned for another time in 1509, but by that time, it was already abandoned, perhaps even in 1489, when Dubrovnik was fortified. For some time, the Kre\u0161evo Nahiya belonged to the kadiluk of Sarajevo. In 1468, Kre\u0161evo was the second largest city in Bosnia, after Fojnica. In that year, there were 299 taxpayer households, and in 1485, there was 290 Christian and 9 Muslim households. This was the first appearance of Muslims in Kre\u0161evo. In 1489, there were 275 Christian households and 11 Muslims individuals. In De\u017eevice in 1468 there was 48 Christian households and 12 individuals, and in 1485 there was 49 Christian households and 11 individuals and one Muslim household. The Kre\u0161evo Nahiyah was also mentioned in 1485 and 1489, but it was left out in censuses from 1516 and 1530. Those censuses do not mention Fojnica and Lepenica as well, as all of them, like Kre\u0161evo, were integrated to the Visoko Nahiyah. In 18th century, Kre\u0161evo become a part of the Sarajevo Kadiluk, and in 19th century it was a part of the Fojnica Mudiriyah in Sarajevan Kaymakamluk. Franciscan monastery in Kre\u0161evo Even though the Ottoman period was harsh for the Kre\u0161evo area, as well as for the whole Bosnia, the status of Kre\u0161evo area was relatively favorable due to mines, smiths and other craftsmen and merchants. The Ottoman adopted almost entire legal regulative of the area (Kanun-sas, translated as the Laws of the Saxons), as well as the technology of craft and ore processing. Those law regulations remained in power until the Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Those qanuns (laws) provided autonomy for metallurgists, regulated the property rights between copartners and established executive bodies (an assembly, a knyaz and a messenger). As only Catholics were in the iron business, there were some favourable conditions for their existence as well as religious and cultural autonomy. The main product of the Kre\u0161evo area until 17th century was silver, when it was replaced by iron whose exploitation and processing found a wide range of usage. The main products of Kre\u0161evan smiths were, among other things, horseshoes and nails. The horseshoes were of the \"Arabic model\" and were known for their quality on the entire Balkans. Along with horseshoes, Kre\u0161evan smiths produced door locks, which were of \"Ragusan model\" with six feathers. During that time, Kre\u0161evo was a large workshop with high metal production and economic development. A detailed description of Kre\u0161evo was made by an Austrian Croat intelligence officer, certain sergeant major Bo\u017ei\u0107, in 1785, prior to the Austro-Turkish War. Bo\u017ei\u0107 wrote that there are some 200 Christian households and 100 Muslim households, a Franciscan monastery with 30 friars and the fortress of the old town. He also mentioned the village of Vranke in which medical devices were produced. Further Bo\u017ei\u0107 wrote that there were 10-12 Christian households in De\u017eevice and 7-8 Christian households in Kojsin. He also mentioned villages of Stoj\u010di\u0107i and Crni\u0107i with around 45 households. In 1848, the Franciscans established an elementary school, second in the entire Bosnia and Herzegovina. ===Austrian-Hungary=== After establishing the Austro- Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kre\u0161evo saw a period of stagnation. The previous rural economy was replaced by capitalism. The new modern technology in the area of mine and metallurgy production was introduced. This ended the local mining and crafts, which entered a major crisis and later entirely disappeared, and was replaced by the industrial production. The turning points occurred when blast furaces were built in Vare\u0161 in 1891 and Zenica in 1893. After that, iron operation in Kre\u0161evo stalled. For this reason, the Kre\u0161evan economy entered the hardest period in its history. The Austrian-Hungarian administration forbade the free forest cutting, which influenced the production of charcoal necessary for the iron production. This led to depopulation and displacement of the population to the other mining and metallurgy centres of the central Bosnia. Kre\u0161evans opposed to those new legislations. Later, the Austrian-Hungarian administration built a macadam road towards Kiseljak and connected Kre\u0161evo with rest of the country. After that, measures for saving Kre\u0161evo's economy were taken, so a smiths' cooperative was founded in 1908, which remained active until 1948, when it was transformed to the \"\u010celik\" company. In the Austria-Hungary, Kre\u0161evo was a district branch of the Fojnica District () in the Sarajevo Province (). In 1879, Kre\u0161evo had 261 households and 1319 inhabitants, and in 1910 it had 316 households and 1043 inhabitants, of which 860 Catholics, 175 Muslims and 2 Orthodox. The Kre\u0161evan population was engaged in agriculture, animal husbandry and beekeeping. Kre\u0161evo had a branch of a weaving company \"Tkaonica \u0107ilima Sarajevo\", a furrier and a smithy with a motor engine. Iron products were made, mostly horseshoes and nails, and there was also a nearby mine owed by Graf Ogsz Orzechowski. In 1901, the Croatian national reading room and library were established. Kre\u0161evo was the first among minor towns to have a water supply, a public bath, a pool, a phone line and a hydroelectric power plant. The town also had a gendarmerie station, a post office, a telegraph, an elementary school, a Muslim mektab, a Franciscan monastery, a Catholic parish and a Muslim mosque. === Communist Yugoslavia === After the World War II, the old production traditions were continued, but on the new foundations. The old smith craft was transferred into industrial production by establishing the \"\u010celik\" company and number of privately owned blacksmiths were modernised. The mining saw a great development by founding the company for production and processing of mineral resources named \"Barit\". The textile tradition was also continued by founding the \"Autooprema\" company, a successor of the \"Tvornica \u0107ilima Sarajevo\" from the Austrian-Hungarian period. ===Democratic period=== After the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the economy of Kre\u0161evo saw a rebirth. Along with existing traditional activity, the new factories for meat production and meat processing, production of dry mortar, construction metalware, joinery, furniture, styrofoam, sponge were opened. The construction had become one of the major economy branches of Kre\u0161evo. Today, Kre\u0161evo is among the rare municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina where unemployment is almost non-existing. ==Demographics== {| class=\"infobox\" ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|Year ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|Croats ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|% ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|Bosniaks ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|% ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|Serbs ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|% ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|others ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|% ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|Total ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|\u00b1% ! style=\"background:#C3C3C3; color:black\"|Ref. |- | 1961 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|5,009 | 77.44 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|845 | 13.06 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|144 | 2.23 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|470 | 7.27 | bgcolor=\"#C3C3C3\"|6,468 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|\u2014 | |- | 1971 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|5,284 | 76.13 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|1,484 | 21.38 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|118 | 1.70 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|55 | 0.79 | bgcolor=\"#C3C3C3\"|6,941 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|+7.3% | |- | 1981 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|5,012 | 74.08 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|1,498 | 22.14 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|54 | 0.80 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|202 | 2.99 | bgcolor=\"#C3C3C3\"|6,766 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|\u22122.5% | |- | 1991 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|4,714 | 70.03 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|1,531 | 22.75 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|34 | 0.51 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|452 | 6.72 | bgcolor=\"#C3C3C3\"|6,731 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|\u22120.5% | |- | 2013 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|4,149 | 78.68 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|1,014 | 19.23 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|26 | 0.49 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|53 | 1.00 | bgcolor=\"#C3C3C3\"|5,273 | bgcolor=\"#E1E1E1\"|\u221216.2% | |- |} ===Settlements=== {|border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 10px 0 10px 25px; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #AAA solid; border-collapse: collapse; font- size: 95%; float: left;\" class=\"sortable\" |- ! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" |Settlement ! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" |Population (1991) |- | Alagi\u0107i || 229 |- | Bjelovi\u0107i || 260 |- | Botunja || 178 |- | Bukva || 163 |- | Crkvenjak || 61 |- | Crni\u010dki Kamenik || 157 |- | Crni\u0107i || 465 |- | De\u017eevice || 246 |- | Dre\u017enice || 87 |- | Gunjar || 124 |- | Kojsina || 226 |- | Komari || 100 |- | Kre\u0161evo || 1,433 |- | Kre\u0161evski Kamenik || 197 |- | Lipa || 92 |- | Martini\u0107i || 557 |- | Pirin || 160 |- | Poljani || 53 |- | Polje (Kre\u0161evo) || 482 |- | Rakova Noga || 407 |- | Ratkovi\u0107i || 94 |- | Stoj\u010di\u0107i || 390 |- | Vidosovi\u0107i || 32 |- | Vodovoji || 65 |- | Volujak || 306 |- | Vranci || 97 |- | Zvizd || 70 |- |} == Economy == After the World War II, Kre\u0161evo saw a steady economic development. The traditional blacksmith craft was transferred to the industrial production with the foundation of the \"\u010celik\" company, which grew from the smiths' cooperative. Other smiths and metal processors united in a crafts cooperative named \"Unikov\". Old blacksmiths were eventually shot down, and those left were modernised. The mining also saw a great development, especially with the founding of a company for production and processing of mineral resources named \"Barit\". The textile industry from the Austrian- Hungarian era was also continued with foundation of the \"Autooprema\" company, which, however, remains small. After the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the privatisation process was mishandled and many markets were lost; technical backwardness and low productivity led to the reduction of economic activity in these sectors. The private sector expanded on other economic activities, such as meat production and processing, styrofoam production, dry mortar production and furniture production. From traditional economic activities, only metal processing and wood processing saw increase. Currently, there are around 70 economic companies in the Kre\u0161evo Municipality. There are around 130 commercial and tourist-catering activities. The production and service sector is also increasing. ==Politics== ===Municipal government=== The current mayor of Kre\u0161evo is Renato Pejak(2018), a member of the HDZ BiH. He was elected mayor at the early mayoral election held in July 2018 Vidovi\u0107 won 64.13% of the vote, while his opponent, \u017deljko Pulji\u0107 of the Croatian Democratic Union 1990, won 35.87%. ===Municipal council=== Council of Kre\u0161evo is a representative body of Kre\u0161evo's citizens and a body of local self- administration. It has 15 representatives. Last election for the Council of Kre\u0161evo were held in October 2012. President of the Council of Kre\u0161evo is Mirsad Beganovi\u0107 of the Party of Democratic Action. ==Sport== The town is home to the football club NK Kre\u0161evo-Stani\u0107. ==Features== The Franciscan monastery St. Catharine there has been serving its community for centuries and the Catholic traditions here are very strong. The monastery has a rustic museum, library and gallery. The monastery as an architectural ensemble, together with a number of its movable property and items, is being included into the List of National Monuments of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 2003. Famous student of the seminary in Kre\u0161evo include Albanian poet Gjergj Fishta.Pater Gjergj Fishta (1871-1940) With no more than a few thousand inhabitants, medieval Kre\u0161evo expanded with the arrival of Saxon blacksmiths. In several areas of Bosnia, small Saxon and Ragusan mining communities were established. The noble families of the Bosnian state were keen to exploit the plentiful resources of gold and silver but they didn't have the skills to do so. The craft was passed on from these migrant miners and can be found today in the old town. ==See also== * Dragutin Lerman ==References== ===Notes=== ===Books=== * * * * === Web sites === * * * * * == External links == *Official website of Kre\u0161evo (Croatian) Category:Populated places in Kre\u0161evo Category:Cities and towns in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Municipalities of the Central Bosnia Canton ",
