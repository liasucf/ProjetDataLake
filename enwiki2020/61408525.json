    "text": "Stemmatografia, known by its full name Stemmatografia sive Armorum Illiricorum delineatio, descriptio et restitutio (English: Stemmatography, or the sketch, description and revival of the Illyrian coats of arms) is a heraldic essay written and illustrated by Pavao Ritter Vitezovi\u0107, and originally published in 1701. ==Publication history== Its first edition was published in 1701, most likely in Vienna, considering the place of printing was never explicitly named. The second edition was published by Vitezovi\u0107 in Zagreb (1702). In the foreword to the second edition he notes that \"the first edition was printed and published in many numbers, was sold out and that there exists a great interest, which led to publishing the second edition of the work\".Ljubovi\u0107, pp. 32 It is regarded as among Vitezovi\u0107's most popular works.Mitev, pp. 88 There he also claims that the work is a \"testament to his dear homeland, because in the published arms the glow of the homeland radiates\", personally hoping that a luckier progeny will embrace \"Croatia in all its parts again whole\" and \"all of Illyricum which will unite with Croatia in love and devotion\", demonstrating patriotic and somewhat Romanticist tendencies. ==Description== The original work contains a total of 56 coats of arms from various lands drawn by Vitezovi\u0107, which are arranged alphabetically. Each page of the book contains an engraving of the Coat of Arms, along with its name in decorative letters and two Latin couplets describing or interpreting the coat of arms. The featured territories range from Muscovy, to Poland, Austria, Illyria, Albania and Turkey. The book contains both historical, fictional and contemporary coats, including those of former Roman provinces.Ljubovi\u0107, pp. 34 In creating his work, Vitezovi\u0107 used a variety of sources, such as seals, coins, stone monuments. At the end of Stemmatografia, he lists short description of every coat of arms featured.Ljubovi\u0107, pp. 35 Vitezovi\u0107 himself stated his intentions are to disclose every individual coat of arms of each kingdom, province, notable city and fortress of the Illyricum, as well as their customs, nature, and movement of clans. He intended to publish a separate book detailing every noble lineage, including those who have descended from them in other European lands. ==Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107 edition== Forty years after its original Vienna release, the book was translated by the monk Hristofor \u017defarovi\u0107Velchev, pp. 20 into the Serbian recension of the Old Church Slavonic,Clarke, Hupchik, pp. 99 under the orders of Serbian patriarch Arsenije IV Jovanovi\u0107. The copper engravings of the coats of arms were done by the young Viennese artist Thomas Messmer. According to Ivo Banac, this edition had a strong influence on the development of heraldry in Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania. The book is also regarded as the first \"Serbian book\" published in the 18th century. ==Gallery== Stematografija prva strana.jpg|Title page of the 1741 translated edition (see below) Dedication-stem.jpg|Dedication page of the same edition File:Dalmatia-stematografija-color.png|Page for Dalmatia File:Moscovia-stematografija-color.png|Page depicting and describing coat of arms of Muscovy, File:Istria-stematografija-color.png|Istria File:Romania- stemmatographia.png|Rumelia File:Scythis-colorized-stemmatographia.png|Scythia \u0413\u0435\u0440\u0431 \u041c\u043e\u043b\u0434\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0438 - \u0421\u0442\u0435\u043c\u043c\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0444\u0438\u044f 1702.jpg|Moldavia File:Wallachia- stemmatographia.png|Wallachia File:Japodia-stemmatograpfia.png|Japodia Coat of Arms of Serbia from Stemmatographia by Hristofor Zhefarovich (1741).jpg|Serbia Coat of Arms of Bulgaria from Stemmatographia by Hristofor Zhefarovich (1741).jpg|Bulgaria Coat of Arms of Bosnia from Stemmatographia by Hristofor Zhefarovich (1741).jpg|Bosnia Coat of Arms of Macedonia from Stemmatographia by Hristofor Zhefarovich (1741).jpg|Macedonia == References == ==Literature== *Grbovi Senjskih Rittera Vitezovi\u0107a, E.
