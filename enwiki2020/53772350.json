    "text": "The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a Twenty20 cricket competition based in India. The tournament honours players with several awards at the end of each season. They are Orange Cap, Purple Cap, Maximum Sixes Award, Most Valuable Player and Emerging Player of the Year. == Orange Cap == The Orange Cap is presented to the leading run scorer in the Indian Premier League (IPL). It was introduced on 25 April 2008, a week after the start of the inaugural season of the IPL. The batsman with most runs in the tournament during the course of the season would wear the Orange Cap while fielding, with the overall leading run- scorer at the conclusion of the tournament winning the actual Orange Cap award on the day of the season's final. Brendon McCullum became the first player to wear the Orange Cap, and Shaun Marsh became the first winner of the award. The then IPL chairman and commissioner Lalit Modi said of the initiative, \"Cricket is often remembered and recorded as statistics and not by material distinctions. The DLF Indian Premier League will create a distinction for the best performing batsman, which will be cherished and valued by each player through this initiative. The purpose of this initiative is to be innovative, create another unique piece of history that sets the DLF Indian Premier League apart from the crowd, and to reward outstanding achievements by the players.\" ; Winners {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !

The award is currently sponsored by Paytm and hence known as PAYTM Fair Play Award. The winner is decided on the basis of the points the umpires give to the teams. After each match, the two on-field umpires, and the third umpire, scores the performance of both the teams. A team can be awarded a total of ten points per match, out of which four points are given on the basis of how the team has adhered to the \"spirit of the game\" in the opinion of the umpires. The other three criteria are based on the respect towards to the opposition, the laws of cricket and the umpires. Each of these three criteria represents 2 points. If a team has got two points in the criterion, its performance is considered as \"good\", whereas getting one or zero points indicates that its performance is \"average\" or \"bad\" respectively. ; Winners {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !
