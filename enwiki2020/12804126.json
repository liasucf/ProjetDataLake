Retrieved June 29, 2018. ==History== The area was once home to bands of Native Americans, Spanish and French Explorers, and Highwaymen that were prominent during the time of the Neutral Strip (Louisiana). A road known as the El Camino Real, or the King's Highway, passed through what became Hodges Garden, and across the Sabine River at Gain's Ferry. It originated in Natchitoches, crossed west central Louisiana, through Texas to Mexico City. Andrew Jackson Hodges, Sr. (1890-1966), a native of Cotton Valley in Webster Parish, purchased more than of cut-over barren land and replanted in timber. The land included an old quarry. Hodges and his wife, the former Nona Trigg, planned a scenic garden around the natural rock formations. The quarry had been used to supply rocks, stones, and sandstone to build, among other things, the jetties in Port Arthur. Work began on the jetties in 1898; material from the quarry was delivered by wagon that would have been at least a six-day round trip. Water from a lake created in 1954 is pumped through the gardens to waterfalls, pools, a geyser, fountains, and to the watering system before it is recycled back into the lake. Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu, head of the Culture, Recreation, and Tourism Department, said that the state signed a transfer agreement with the Hodges Foundation. Landrieu, who left the lieutenant governorship in May 2010 to become mayor of New Orleans, noted that A. J. Hodges \"took a barren stone quarry and turned it into a thriving tourist area. The state\u2019s takeover of the park will restore the garden\u2019s original beauty, upgrade accommodations, and ultimately add value to this economic asset.\" In 2015, the gardens were listed on the National Register of Historic Places. ==Park features== The park includes referred to as Hodges Gardens, and features of gardens, a , that includes a lighthouse, bass fishing lake, hiking and biking trails, and RV and wilderness camping. ===Services and amenities=== * Amphitheater * Bicycle Riding * Bird Watching * Boating (Boat rental) * Cabins * Lodge (Accommodates up to 52) * Canoeing (Canoe Rental) * Fishing (Fishing Pier) * Hiking * Kayaking (Kayak Rental) * Lookout Tower * Pavilion * Picnicking * Tent Area * Walking * Waterfall * Wildlife Viewing ==Things to see== Many plants and flowers are grown in tropical greenhouses on the property and some flowers like tulips, hyacinths, & daffodils were imported to add variety for visitors.

Camping facilities became available a few months thereafter. But after nine years, the state, with a tight budget, chose not to continue to operate Hodges Gardens. Instead, the Louisiana Department of Culture, Recreation & Tourism and the Office of State Parks will effective October 1, 2017, return ownership to the A. J. and Nona Triggs Foundation. The state and the foundation have been since 2008 operating the park through a cooperative endeavor agreement. Mayor Kenneth Freeman of Many and private preservation groups have sought to preserve Hodges Gardens, which Freeman indicated that he has visited several times a year since 1964, when he was eight years of age. \"Every time I go I see something new and beautiful. I don't want to lose that for future generations, not to mention the economic impact it would have on our local economies,\" Freeman said. He urged area residents to patronize the park on a regular basis. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Sabine Parish, Louisiana ==References== ==External links== *HodgesGardens.net *ToledoBendLakeCountry.com -- Official site of the Toledo Bend (Sabine Parish) Tourist Commission *Hodges Gardens State Park - Louisiana Office of State Parks *Hodges Gardens near Toledo Bend Reservoir Category:State parks of Louisiana Category:Protected areas of Sabine Parish, Louisiana Category:Botanical gardens in Louisiana Category:Parks on the National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Sabine Parish, Louisiana ",
