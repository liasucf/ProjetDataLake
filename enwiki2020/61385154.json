He is an honors graduate of North Springs High School, Duke University, and the University of Michigan Law School, where he was also selected to serve in an externship in the State Department\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser. After college, Schrage worked in a restaurant and bar to save up money and then spent a year backpacking around the world using local transport and interacting with individuals ranging from Chinese students after the Tiananmen square protests to whiskey smugglers riding camels on the border of India and Pakistan. Following several years in government and private sector positions, Schrage began MBA studies at Harvard Business School where he was later awarded a full scholarship to conduct doctoral studies.

In July 2016, Schrage convened a high-profile conference at the University of Cambridge on the upcoming U.S. presidential election, entitled 2016\u2019s Race to Change the World, which was based on his Harvard and Cambridge research and experience on Campaigns and Foreign Policy.

During the 2000 presidential campaign, he worked on George W. Bush\u2019s policy team in Austin, Texas and later was selected to serve on Bush\u2019s White House transition team. Schrage was named as the new administration\u2019s first appointee, as Senior Advisor, in the White House\u2019s Cabinet Level Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) overseeing its operations until a new USTR was confirmed, and later served under the new USTR Robert Zoellick.

Part of his responsibility was to oversee global rule of law and criminal justice efforts, including the work of hundreds of Department of Justice, FBI, DEA and other law enforcement officials placed overseas and a network of International Law Enforcement Academies training foreign law enforcement in criminal, border security, anticorruption and other matters.

Based on this INL work, Schrage was also later selected by the White House and State Department to serve as the Co-Chair of the G8\u2019s Anti-Crime and Terrorism Group to lead post-9/11 efforts with the G8 group of world\u2019s leading powers on matters like border security, terrorism, cybercrime, airport/transportation security, and intelligence. In this role, he led U.S. delegations abroad from major U.S. cabinet agencies such as Department of Justice, Homeland Security and Treasury, and co-chaired the U.S. meeting of the Crime and Terrorism group among U.S. allies in 2004. Schrage later served as International Trade Counsel for the House Ways and Means Committee, where he was the point person for homeland security and border issues, the adoption of new labor and environmental standards in U.S. trade agreements, and for the successful bipartisan passage of several new Free Trade Agreements.

Senator Brown was elected to serve in the seat long held by legendary Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy. During the time Schrage was his chief of staff, Senator Brown won praise for his bipartisan actions and, even as a Republican in a heavily democratic state, received some of the strongest approval ratings of any sitting U.S. Senator. Following his government service, Schrage taught the core curriculum Economics and National Security course at Georgetown\u2019s Graduate School of Foreign Service, which has frequently been ranked as the top International Relations masters program by Foreign Policy magazine\u2019s survey. ==References== Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:21st-century American people Category:21st-century American male writers Category:Living people Category:Duke University alumni Category:University of Michigan Law School alumni Category:Harvard Business School alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
