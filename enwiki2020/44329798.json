    "text": "The rule of 80's is a method of interpreting a person's acid-base status using an arterial blood gas. It is a quick way to determine if a patient has metabolic acidosis, metabolic alkalosis, respiratory acidosis, or respiratory alkalosis. It does not say anything about the cause of the acid-base disturbance. ==Method== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" ! Step ! Procedure ! Rule ! Example |- | 1 | Look at pH and pCO2 | | pH = 7.30 pCO2 = 35 |- | 2 | Take decimal from pH and add it pCO2 | <77 = metabolic acidemia 77-83 = pure respiratory >83 = metabolic alkalemia | 30 + 35 = 65 Metabolic acidemia |- | 3 | Look at pCO2 | <40 = respiratory alkalemia >40 = respiratory acidemia | pCO2 = 35 Respiratory alkalemia |- | 4 | Look at pH If the patient has a pH less than 7.40, it is an acidosis. If the pH is greater than 7.40, it is an alkalosis. This is the primary process. If the pH = 7.40, nothing is termed \"-osis\". The acidemia and alkalemia remain named as is. | <7.40 = acidosis >7.40 = alkalosis | pH = 7.30 Acidosis |- | 5 | Rename the primary process If the patient has an acidosis, the metabolic or respiratory acidemia is termed a metabolic or respiratory acidosis. If the patient has an alkalosis, the metabolic or respiratory alkalemia is termed a metabolic or respiratory alkalosis. | Change name of primary process (-emia becomes -osis) | Metabolic acidemia becomes Metabolic acidosis |- | 6 | Final interpretation | | Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalemia |} ==Table/Examples== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: center;\" ! pH ! pCO2 ! Interpretation |- | 7.20 | 60 | Pure respiratory acidosis |- | 7.60 | 20 | Pure respiratory alkalosis |- | 7.20 | 20 | Metabolic acidosis with respiratory alkalemia |- | 7.50 | 50 | Metabolic alkalosis with respiratory acidemia |} ==References== Category:Acid\u2013base physiology Category:Acid\u2013base disturbances ",
