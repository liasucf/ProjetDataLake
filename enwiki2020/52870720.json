Soviet tanker \"Poltava\" traveling with kerosene to China, is captured by the Kuomintang. Additionally the motorist Raiskiy is accused of accidentally killing one of the soldiers (it turns out later that he is still alive), and under this pretext, the Kuomintang begin to look for the \"killer\", using this incident as one of the reasons for the ship's detention. The tanker with crew is delivered to Taiwan, where they are persuaded to voluntarily go over to the \"genuine freedom and democracy\", and are treated exceptionally well: they are housed in a luxurious villa, given food and drink. When persuasion does not work on them, they start using very different measures: concentration camp and oppression. Heroic adventures follow. Some return home after a few months, others only through many years, and some do not come back at all. The story is told from the viewpoint of the captain's first mate of educational work (played by Mikhail Kuznetsov). ==Cast== *Mikhail Kuznetsov \u2014 Anton Kovalenko *Alexander Anurov \u2014 Leonid Kalugin *Vyacheslav Tikhonov \u2014 Victor Rayskiy *Taisiya Litvinenko \u2014 Rita Voronkov\u0430 *Anatoly Solovyov Grachev *Giuli Chokhonelidze \u2014 Javakheti *Dmitri Kapka \u2014 Kharitonenko *Vladimir Rudin \u2014 Ivan Frolov *Yuri Sarychev *Paul Usovnichenko \u2014 Nikolai Sakharov *Vladimir Dalsky \u2014 Fang *Vladimir Uan-Zo-Li \u2014 Gao *Alexander Tolstoy \u2014 Doronin *Valery Zinoviev *Boris Ivchenko *Eugene Baliev - Sokolov *Witold Yanpavlis *Alexander Barushnoy \u2014 French Ambassador *Vladimir Volchik \u2014 American officer ==Awards== *First prize for art direction (M.
