Following the implementation of the Local Government Act 1888, which established county councils in every county, the Shire Hall also became the meeting place of Worcestershire County Council. After the creation of Hereford and Worcester County Council in 1974, a new building, which was designed by Robert Matthew Johnson-Marshall & Partners as a meeting place for the Council, opened in 1978. It became the home of Worcestershire County Council following the local boundary changes in 1998. ==References== W Category:Buildings and structures in Worcestershire Category:Government buildings completed in 1978 Category:1978 establishments in England ",
