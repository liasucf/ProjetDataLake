It was home to the St. Louis Red Stockings of the National Association during the 1875 season, so it is considered a major league ballpark by those who count the NA as a major league. It was also known as Compton Avenue Baseball Park or just Compton Park, as it was bounded by Compton Avenue, Gratiot Street, railroad tracks, Theresa Avenue and Scott Street.
