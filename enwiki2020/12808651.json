Following the 2011 Norway attacks, Anundsen was appointed second deputy leader of the 22 July Committee. In 2012, Jens Stoltenberg became the first ever incumbent Norwegian Prime Minister to be summoned to an open hearing, on the topic of the emergency preparedness of the government before the 2011 attacks. In 2013 the committee concluded unanimously to criticise the government for lack of preparedness before the attacks.\"Samlet kontrollkomit\u00e9 kritiserer regjeringen\", Dagbladet, 19.02.2013 ===Minister of Justice=== Minister Anundsen with Simonetta Sommaruga. On 16 October 2013 Anundsen was appointed Minister of Justice in the new government of Erna Solberg. Having won much acclaim for his committee work in parliament, Anundsen was considered one of his party's strongest candidates for a cabinet position prior to the official appointment.\"Kilder til VG: Anders Anundsen (Frp) blir justisminister\", VG, 14.10.2013\"Frp f\u00e5r justisdepartementet\", NRK, 14.10.2013 During the last week of July 2014, Anundsen introduced extraordinary security measures due to a short-term high-risk terror threat reported by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST), later revealed to have originated from a group of ISIL extremists from Syria. The measures introduced included full border controls and patrolling police across the country.\"Terrortrusselen: Fryktet drap p\u00e5 tilfeldig familie\", Nettavisen, 18.09.14\"165.000 ble terrorsjekket i sommer\", VG/NTB, 14.11.2014 In November the same year, Anundsen introduced temporary general arming of the Norwegian police due to a heightened terror risk.\"Anundsen sier ja til bev\u00e6pning\", NRK, 21.11.2014 Although initially introduced for four weeks, the period was later extended to an additional two months due to continued high terror threat.\"Frykter langvarig bev\u00e6pning av politiet\", Bergens Tidende/NTB, 17.12.2014 In order to alleviate a shortage of Norwegian prison spaces, Anudsen in 2014 signed a deal with the Netherlands to rent prison spaces in the country, with prisoners to be sent to the Netherlands during 2015.\"Norway Sends 242 Prisoners to the Netherlands\", The Nordic Page, 19.12.2014 The deal would apply to prisoners with long-term sentences, and foreign citizens set to be deported from Norway.\"Netherlands agrees to take Norway's criminals\", The Local, 09.09.2014\"Norway to 'export' inmates to Dutch jails to cut queues\", BBC News, 09.09.2014 == Controversies == === \"Asylum children\" case === 250px By late 2014 Anundsen became the subject of a controversy surrounding the deportation of so-called \"long-term asylum children\", children of asylum seekers who have had their application rejected, only to continue living in Norway illegally for several years. While the government's expressed policy has introduced measures to deport record numbers of illegal immigrants,\"Norway deports record number of immigrants\", The Local, 10.11.2014\"Siv Jensen gir millioner til tvangsutsendelser: M\u00f8tt med sinte tilrop p\u00e5 Trandum\", NRK, 08.10.2014\"Record number of foreigners deported\", The Local, 27.01.2014 it was revealed by Bergens Tidende that twice as many families had been sent out of Norway in 2014 than in 2013, despite that as part of the new government platform the Liberal and Christian Democratic parties had secured support for softening the rules on some long- term children, potentially allowing some to stay in Norway. As the cause was found to be that the new rules had not been communicated properly to the departments involved with deporting illegal immigrants, Anundsen in December apologised in parliament and took self-criticism for his handling of the case, saying he would signal the new rules better and go through routines.\"Anundsen tar selvkritikk i asylbarn-saken\", Aftenposten, 19.12.2014\"Mener Anundsen tilsl\u00f8rte asylbarnavtale\", Bergens Tidende, 19.12.2014 In February 2015 Anundsen was summoned to an open hearing in the parliamentary Committee on Scrutiny and Constitutional Affairs after increasing pressure, following which the Labour, Socialist Left and Centre parties proposed a motion of no confidence against him. The Liberals and Christian Democrats however only supported issuing a strong criticism of Anundsen, and as such the motion failed to gain majority support.http://www.dn.no/nyheter/politikkSamfunn/2015/03/24/1916/Anders- Anundsen/anundsen-slipper-unna-mistillit-i-asylbarnsaken On 8 April the four government-cooperation parties finally reached an agreement that would let some deported children have their asylum applications considered again under the new rules as a one-time solution, while in return some aspects of the general asylum policy would be further tightened.http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/asyl-debatten/enighet-i- asylbarnsaken/a/23431010/ Anundsen went on to state that he had secured \"a major tightening of immigration policy\" by the agreement.http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/politikk/Anundsen-sier-han- sikret-en-stor-innstramning-i-innvandringspolitikken-7974266.html === Criticism from Office of the Auditor General === 250px In March 2015 the Office of the Auditor General of Norway () criticized the Ministry of Justice and Public Security for the way the Ministry has coordinated the work with civil protection and prevention of future terror attacks. The criticism is a report revolving the coordination of the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning and the county governors. The Auditor General of Norway, Per-Kristian Foss stated that he is personally disappointed over the fact that the government has not come any further in improving the civil protection, four years after the 2011 Norway attacks.http://www.dn.no/nyheter/politikkSamfunn/2015/05/21/1633/foss-jeg-er- personlig-skuffet He also proclaimed that the report is the toughest criticism from the Office of the Auditor General of Norway against a ministry since the Office of the Auditor General of Norway was established.http://www.nrk.no/nyheter/foss_-_-sjeldent-alvorlig- kritikk-1.12371715 Anundsen responded to the criticism by saying that \"This is serious criticism, but not against me personally. This is criticism against the work that has been done over many years\".http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/norsk-politikk/anundsen-om- riksrevisjonens-slakt-forstaar-godt-at-foss-er-skuffet/a/23456628/ The director of the Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning, Jon Arvid Lea rejected the conclusions of the Office of the Auditor General, stating that it gave a wrong impression of the work and improvements that had been made in civil protection during recent years.DSB-sjef: Forst\u00e5r ikke Riksrevisjonens kritikk ==Personal life== Anundsen is married to Marianne Ringnes, and together they have three children.\"Klar for kamp\", NRK, 06.08.2009\"Anders Anundsen nysl\u00e5tt minister\", Advokatbladet, 2013 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Larvik Category:University of Oslo alumni Category:Norwegian jurists Category:Vestfold politicians Category:Progress Party (Norway) politicians Category:Members of the Storting Category:Government ministers of Norway Category:21st-century Norwegian politicians Category:Ministers of Justice of Norway ",
