It had been playing its latest run in the Belgian First Division from 2000\u201301 to 2005\u201306 included. Two players have been called to the Belgium national football team while at La Louvi\u00e8re: Guy Dardenne (6 caps when at La Louvi\u00e8re, 11 caps in all) and Silvio Proto (5 caps when at La Louvi\u00e8re). The matricule of the club was the number 93. In June 2009, it merged with R.A.C.S. Couillet to form Football Couillet La Louvi\u00e8re. ==History== The club was founded on January 26, 1913 during a meeting at the Place Maugr\u00e9tout in La Louvi\u00e8re. It was named A.A. Louvi\u00e9roise. After one season in a provincial league, the football stopped due to the War. The club did not play official matches until 1921 as it had no stadium. Between 1921 and 1937 Louvi\u00e9roise played in the provincial leagues. In 1937 the club changed its name to R.A.A. Louvi\u00e9roise and it reached the Promotion. The next year a Belgian international player (namely August Hellemans who played in the 1930 World Cup) was transferred at La Louvi\u00e8re. The club had its first spell in the first division between 1977 and 1979. In 1984 it was relegated to the third division and it played at that level for 10 years. Between 1994 and 2000 it played in the second division. In 2006 the club was one of the most frequently mentioned in a gambling scandal that rocked Belgian football. It was alleged in the Belgian press that several players, board members and manager Gilbert Bodart had accepted large sums of money from Chinese businessman Zheyun Ye, who wanted to influence the results in matches so he could manufacture high profits in gambling. At first the club strongly denied the allegations, but on February 21, 2006 Bodart resigned as manager. His assistant, former La Louvi\u00e8re forward Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Tilmant replaced him at the helm of the club but could not avoid RAAL finishing in last place in the division. This meant the club would have to play in the second division for the 2006\u201307 season. However, on May 16, 2006 the club was refused its license to play in the second division. It subsequently appealed the decision but the Appeal Commission of the Belgian Football Association confirmed the judgement of May 16. The club eventually seized the Evocation Commission which rejected the plaint of La Louvi\u00e8re on June 15, 2006. The day after, chairman Filippo Gaone retired from the club as it would play the third division in 2006\u201307. In 2009, La Louvi\u00e8re merged with R.A.C.S. Couillet to form Football Couillet La Louvi\u00e8re, with the matricule number 93 begin retired as the new club continued with the number 94 of R.A.C.S. Couillet. ==Honours== *Belgian Cup: **Winners (1): 2002\u201303 *Belgian Supercup: **Runners-up (1): 2003 *Belgian Second Division Final Round: **Winners (3): 1975, 1977, 2000 ==European record== {| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"2\" |- ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Competition ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Appearances ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Matches played ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Won ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Drawn ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | Lost ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | GF ! style=\"background:#efefef;\" | GA |- | 2003\u201304 UEFA Cup || 1 || 2 || 0 || 1 || 1 || 1 || 2 |} ==References== * UEFA page Louvieroise, R.A.A.
