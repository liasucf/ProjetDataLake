The Bridge Pavilion () is a building designed by British-Iraqi architect Zaha Hadid that was constructed for the Expo 2008 in Zaragoza (Spain) as one of its main landmarks. It is an innovative 280-metre-long (919 ft) covered bridge that imitates a gladiola over the river Ebro, connecting the neighbourhood of with the exposition site, and thus becoming its main entrance. The new bridge is, at the same time, a multi-level exhibition area; 10,000 visitors per hour were expected to frequent the Pavilion during world exhibition. Hadid chose fibre glass reinforced concrete from Austrian company Rieder to envelope the bridge: she covered the outer skin of the building with 29,000 triangles of fibreC in different shades of grey. During the Expo 2008, the Bridge Pavilion hosted an exposition called Water \u2013 a unique resource, designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates. When the Expo was over, the building was purchased by the local savings bank Ibercaja to use it as a site for expositions. ==External links== *Zaragoza Bridge Pavilion *Official site *Bridge Pavilion *Image fibreC Category:World's fair architecture in Zaragoza Category:Zaha Hadid buildings Category:Postmodern architecture Category:Modernist architecture in Spain Category:Bridges completed in 2008 Category:Cultural infrastructure completed in 2008 Category:Neo-futurism architecture ",
