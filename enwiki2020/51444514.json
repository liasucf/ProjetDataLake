    "text": "PSLV-C6 was the sixth operational launch and overall ninth mission of the PSLV program. This launch was also the fifty-fourth launch by Indian Space Research Organisation since its first mission on 1 January 1962. The vehicle carried and injected India's two satellites; Cartosat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P5) and HAMSAT into the Sun-synchronous orbit. PSLV-C6 was launched at 04:44 hours Coordinated Universal Time (10:14 hours Indian Standard Time) on 5 May 2005 from the second launch pad of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre. ==Mission highlights== *Seventh operational launch of the PSLV program. *Overall ninth mission of the PSLV program. *Overall fifty-fourth launch by Indian Space Research Organisation. *First flight to be launched from the second launch pad of Satish Dhawan Space Centre. *Carried and injected two satellites built by ISRO. ==Mission parameters== * Mass: ** Total liftoff weight: ** Payload weight: * Overall height: * Propellant: ** First stage: Solid HTPB based (138.0 + 6 x 9 tonnes) ** Second stage: Liquid UH 25 + (41.5 tonnes) ** Third stage: Solid HTPB based (7.6 tonnes) ** Fourth stage: Liquid MMH + MON (2.5 tonnes) * Engine: ** First stage: Core (PS 1) + 6 strap-on PSOM ** Second stage: Vikas ** Third stage: PS 3 ** Fourth stage: PS 4 * Thrust: ** First stage: 4,762 + 645 x 6 kN ** Second stage: 800 kN ** Third stage: 246 kN ** Fourth stage: 7.3 x 2 kN * Altitude: * Maximum velocity: (recorded at time of payload separation) * Duration: 1,120 seconds ==Payload== PSLV-C6 carried and deployed two Indian satellites, Cartosat-1 (a.k.a. IRS-P5) and HAMSAT into the Sun-synchronous orbit. Built by ISRO, Cartosat-1 was a stereoscopic remote sensing satellite and first of the Cartosat series of satellites. HAMSAT was a microsatellite, built for providing satellite based amateur radio satellite to the national as well as the international community of amateur radio operators (HAM). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
