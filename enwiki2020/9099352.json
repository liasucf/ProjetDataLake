    "text": "Surrey was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of England then of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1707 to 1800 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1832. It was represented by two Members of Parliament until 1832. The constituency was split into two two- member divisions, for Parliamentary purposes, in 1832. The county was then represented by the East Surrey and West Surrey constituencies. ==Boundaries== Surrey is one of the historic counties of England, located south of the River Thames, in south east England. The constituency comprised the whole county but had six towns which were boroughs for some of when it was a constituency: Bletchingley, Gatton, Guildford, Haslemere, Reigate and Southwark - each of which elected two MPs in their own right, these were not excluded from the county constituency, and owning property within the boroughs could confer a vote at the county election.) ==Members of Parliament== ===1290-1640=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Parliament!!First member!!Second member |- | 1290|| Roland of Oxted|| |- | 1360|| Nicholas Carew|| |- | 1377 (Oct)|| Nicholas Carew|| |- | 1378|| John Hathersham I |- | 1379|| John Legh|| |- | 1380 (Nov)|| William Weston I|| |- | 1381|| John Hathersham I|| |- | 1382 (May)|| John Hathersham I|| |- | 1383 (Oct)|| John Hathersham I|| |- | 1386|| Sir James Berners|| John Newdigate |- | 1388 (Feb)|| John Hathersham I|| Hugh Quecche |- | 1388 (Sep)|| John Thorpe|| Thomas Kynnersley |- | 1390 (Jan)|| John Thorpe|| John Hathersham I |- | 1390 (Nov)|| William Weston I|| John Bentley |- | 1391|| Sir Thomas Brewes|| Ralph Cuddington |- | 1393|| Sir Thomas Brewes|| William Weston I |- | 1394|| Nicholas Carew|| William Weston I |- | 1395|| Nicholas Carew|| Robert Loxley |- | 1397 (Jan)|| Nicholas Carew|| William Weston I |- | 1397 (Sep)|| Nicholas Carew|| Thomas Wintershall |- | 1399|| John Hathersham II|| Ralph Cuddington |- | 1401|| William Weston I|| John Wintershall |- | 1402|| John Waterton|| Ralph Cuddington |- | 1404 (Jan)|| Sir William Brantingham|| John Wintershall |- | 1404 (Oct)|| Sir William Brantingham|| William Croyser |- | 1406|| John Wintershall|| John Gravesend |- | 1407|| Ralph Cuddington|| Robert Bussebridge |- | 1410|| |- | 1411|| |- | 1413 (Feb)|| |- | 1413 (May)|| John Burgh II|| William Yerde |- | 1414 (Apr)|| John Bonet|| John Clipsham |- | 1414 (Nov)|| John Burgh II|| John Wintershall |- | 1415|| John Burgh II|| William Weston I |- | 1416 (Mar)|| John Burgh II|| William Yerde |- | 1416 (Oct)|| |- | 1417|| Nicholas Carew|| John Clipsham |- | 1419|| William Weston I|| William Yerde |- | 1420|| Robert Skerne|| William Ottworth |- | 1421 (May)|| John Clipsham|| John Bonet |- | 1421 (Dec)|| John Clipsham|| William Ottworth |- | 1422|| Robert Skerne|| |- | 1423|| John Clipsham|| |- | 1425|| John Wintershall|| |- | 1426|| John Clipsham|| |- | 1427|| John Clipsham|| |- | 1433|| John Wintershall|| |- | 1441|| Anthony Brocas|| |- | 1459|| Ralph Legh|| |- | 1460||John Wood|| |- | 1478||John Wood|| |- | 1510\u20131523|| No names known |- | 1529|| Sir William Fitzwilliam|| Sir Nicholas Carew |- | 1536|| ?Sir William Fitzwilliam|| ? |- | 1539|| Sir Anthony Browne|| Sir Christopher More |- | 1542|| Sir Anthony Browne|| Robert Southwell |- | 1545|| Sir Anthony Browne|| Sir Edmund Walsingham |- | 1547|| Sir Anthony Browne, died 1548 and repl.

Each voter had as many votes as there were seats to be filled. Votes had to be cast by a spoken declaration, in public, at the hustings, which took place in the county town of Guildford. The expense and difficulty of voting at only one location in the county, together with the lack of a secret ballot contributed to the corruption and intimidation of voters, which was widespread in the unreformed British political system. The expense, to candidates, of contested elections encouraged the leading families of the county to agree on the candidates to be returned unopposed whenever possible. Contested county elections were therefore unusual. Where there was only one candidate of a party in successive elections, for the same number of seats, change is calculated on the party vote. Where there was more than one candidate, in one or both successive elections for the same number of seats, then change is calculated on the individual percentage vote. ===Parliament of the United Kingdom 1801-1832=== * Seat vacated on appointment of Russell as a Lord of the Admiralty 10 February 1806 * Note (1806 by-election): (Source: The Times edition of 24 February 1806) * Note (1806): Poll 2 days. \"Although Mr. Thornton had lost his election for Hull, he resigned on the second day in favour of Sir J.
