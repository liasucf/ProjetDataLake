In the second half oh the 19th century an orthodox Spassko-Preobrazhenskiy convent was built near the Senty church. The church was much altered at the urging of the nuns, its original form was changed. In the soviet times the convent was turned into an orphan house. At the present time it is being rebuilt. Near the church lie the ruins of a mausoleum which is also dates back to the 10th century. Supposedly it was intended to be used as a burial place for higher church officials. This building is unique for North Caucasus. == Architecture == The church is built from polished sandstone with a use of limestone solution. It has one dome. It is cross-shaped in plan, with an apse from the eastern side. == Interior == In the Senty Church there are lots of traces of frescoes. This is the biggest mural complex in Alania. == See also == *Shoana Church *Zelenchuksky Churches *North Church (Alania) == External links == *History and exploration of the church *Frescoes of Senty Church *Photographs of the church == Gallery == File:\u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u043b\u0443\u0447\u0430\u0445 \u0432\u043e\u0441\u0445\u043e\u0434\u044f\u0449\u0435\u0433\u043e \u0441\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0446\u0430.jpg File:\u0425\u0440\u0430\u043c \u0432 \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0421\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b (\u0422\u0435\u0431\u0435\u0440\u0434\u0430).JPG|View of Senty Church File:SaintsChurch5.jpg|Senty Church File:SaintsChurch8.jpg|Frescoes of Senty church File:SaintsChurch7.jpg|Frescoes of Senty church File:SaintsChurch9.jpg|Apse in Senty Church File:Sysoev - Trip to the rivers Zelenchuk, Kuban and Teberda 1895 05.png|Senty Church in 1895 == References list == * Beletskiy D.V., Vinogradov A.U.
