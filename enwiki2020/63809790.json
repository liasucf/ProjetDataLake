    "text": "Kink is a 2013 documentary film on popular American fetish website Kink.com. The documentary produced by James Franco was originally released in January 2013 and had a staggered release worldwide in 2013 and 2015. == Plot == Director Christina Voros and producer James Franco pull back the curtain on the fetish empire of Kink.com, the Internet's largest producer of BDSM content. In a particularly obscure corner of an industry that operates largely out of public view, Kink.com's directors and models strive for authenticity. In an enterprise often known for exploitative practices, Kink.com upholds an ironclad set of values to foster an environment that is safe, sane, and consensual. They aim to demystify the BDSM lifestyle, and to serve as an example and an educational resource for the BDSM community. In kink, we discover not only a fascinating and often misunderstood subculture, but also, in a career far from the mainstream, a group of intelligent, charismatic, and driven people who really, truly love what they do. == Cast == == Release dates == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !

A review by Slant Magazine Drew Hunt said \"More than just a thorough examination of hardcore pornography, Christina Voros\u2019s doc is also a sort of chronicle of the filmmaking process.\" and also \"This intriguing paradox contributes to the familiar but no less truthful idea that appearances are often deceiving; rarely is that more exhilaratingly evident than in Kink.\" In a 2014 article by the New York Times called the documentary a \"well done in-depth look into the industry.\" == References == == External links == * Category:2013 films Category:BDSM in films ",
