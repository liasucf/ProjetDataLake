    "text": "The Bishop of Birmingham heads the Church of England Diocese of Birmingham, in the Province of Canterbury, in England. The diocese covers the North West of the historical county of Warwickshire and has its see in the City of Birmingham, West Midlands, where the seat of the diocese is located at the Cathedral Church of Saint Philip which was elevated to cathedral status in 1905. The bishop's residence is Bishop's Croft in Harborne, Birmingham. The office has existed since the foundation of the see in 1905 from the Diocese of Worcester under King Edward VII. The present bishop is David Urquhart, who was translated from Birkenhead (in the Diocese of Chester) in 2006 and installed at Birmingham Cathedral on 17 November 2006. The bishop is assisted, throughout the whole diocese, by the suffragan Bishop of Aston. ==List of bishops== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 95%;\" |- ! colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color: #7F1734; color: white;\" | Bishops of Birmingham |- ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 8%;\" | From ! style=\"background- color: #D4B1BB; width: 8%;\" | Until ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 24%;\" | Incumbent ! style=\"background-color: #D4B1BB; width: 55%;\" | Notes |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1905 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1911 | 60px Charles Gore | Translated from Worcester; nominated 20 January and invested 27 January 1905; translated to Oxford, 17 October 1911. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1911 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1924 | 60px Henry Wakefield | Nominated 20 October and consecrated 28 October 1911; resigned 1 August 1924; died 9 January 1933. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1924 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1953 | 60px Ernest Barnes | Previously a Canon of Westminster since 1918; nominated 1 September and consecrated 29 September 1924; resigned April 1953 and died 29 November 1953. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1953 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1969 | 60px Leonard Wilson | Previously Bishop of Singapore (as a POW) 1941\u20131948 then Dean of Manchester since 1948; nominated 30 June and confirmed 28 September 1953; resigned 30 September 1969; died 18 August 1970. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1969 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1977 | 60px Laurie Brown | Translated from Warrington; nominated 7 October and confirmed 9 December 1969; resigned 1 November 1977; died in 1993. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1977 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1987 | 60px Hugh Montefiore | Translated from Kingston-upon-Thames; nominated 7 November 1977 and confirmed 23 February 1978; resigned in 1987; died 13 May 2005. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1987 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2002 | 60px Mark Santer | Translated from Kensington; nominated and confirmed in 1987; resigned 31 May 2002. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2002 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2005 | 60px John Sentamu | Translated from Stepney; nominated 11 June 2002; translated to York in 2005. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: white;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2005 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | Michael Whinney (Acting) | Assistant bishop and former Bishop of Southwell; acting in interregnum. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background- color: #F7F0F2;\" | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 2006 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | present | 60px David Urquhart | Translated from Birkenhead; nominated 23 May 2006; inaugurated 17 November 2006. |- valign=\"top\" style=\"background-color: white;\" | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center;\" | Source(s): |} ==Assistant bishops== Among those who have served as assistant bishops of the diocese were: *19131937 (ret.): Hamilton Baynes, Vicar/Provost of Birmingham (from 1931), former Bishop of Natal and Assistant Bishop of Southwell *1937\u20131958 (d.): James Linton, Rector of Handsworth and former Bishop in Persia *1951\u20131953 (res.): James Hughes, Vicar of Edgbaston and former Bishop of Barbados; became Bishop of Matabeleland and Archbishop of Central Africa, then Bishop of Trinidad *1962\u20131972: George Sinker, Provost of Birmingham and former Bishop in Nagpur *19972003 (ret.): David Evans, Gen.
