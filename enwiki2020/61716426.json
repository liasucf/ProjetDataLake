    "text": "Theodor Hahn (May 19, 1824 \u2013 March 3, 1883) was a German hydrotherapist, naturopath and vegetarianism activist. ==Biography== Hahn was born at Ludwigslust. He was influenced by the hydrotherapy of his cousin J. H. Rausse and started his own water cure therapy in October, 1847.Kirchfeld, Friedhelm; Boyle, Wade. (1994). Nature Doctors: Pioneers in Naturopathic Medicine. Medicina Biol\u00f3gica. pp. 49-53. Lloyd, Iva. (2009). The History of Naturopathic Medicine: A Canadian Perspective. McArthur & Company. p. 46. He worked with Rausse until his death in 1848 at a water cure institution in Alexandersbad. Hahn was one of the first to use the term \"Naturheilkunde\" (Nature Cure). In 1850, he managed Buchenthal water cure in Canton of St. Gallen, Switzerland. In 1852, he became director of Tiefenau water cure in Canton of Z\u00fcrich. Hahn completed the second and third part of Rausse's book Instructions for the Use of Water Cure during 1851\u20131852. In the early 1850s Hahn gave up alcohol, coffee, meat and spices.Treitel, Corinna. (2017). Eating Nature in Modern Germany: Food, Agriculture and Environment, c.1870 to 2000. Cambridge University Press. pp. 41-42. He operated a naturopathic sanatorium Auf der Waid in Oberwaid near St. Gallen from 1862. Medical Historian Karl Eduard Rothschuh commented that Hahn \"started out exclusively with the water cure but with his addition of dietetics and vegetarianism to nature cure, he pushed its influence into the beginning of the health and life reform movement.\"Rothschuh, Karl E. (1983). Naturheilbewegung, Reformbewegung, Alternativbewegung. (Nature Cure Movement, Reform Movement, Alternative Movement). Stuttgart: Hippokrates. p. 79. Hahn was influenced by Christoph Wilhelm Hufeland's book Makrobiotik and began to prescribe to his patients a lacto-vegetarian diet from 1852 that consisted of whole wheat bread, milk and uncooked vegetables.Bergdolt, Klaus. (2008). Wellbeing: A Cultural History of Healthy Living. Polity Press. p. 286. Puskar-Pasewicz, Margaret. (2010). Cultural Encyclopedia of Vegetarianism. ABC-CLIO. p. 116. Hahn's vegetarianism influenced Eduard Baltzer, Richard Wagner and many others.Lentz, Carola. (1999). Changing Food Habits: Cases Studies from Africa, South America and Europe. Harwood Academic Publishers. p. 183. His Die naturgem\u00e4sse Di\u00e4t (The Natural Diet) in 1859 argued against the meat-based diet that was promoted by Jacob Moleschott, Gabriel Valentin and others. He argued for a meatless diet and provided evidence of its physiological benefits, including longevity and physical strength. In 1865, Hahn authored a bestseller Das Paradies der Gesundheit, das verlorene und das wiedergefundene (The Paradise of Health, the Lost One, and the One Regained). Hahn opposed animal vivisection. He died from colon cancer on March 3, 1883. ==Selected publications== *Die naturgem\u00e4sse Di\u00e4t: die Di\u00e4t der Zukunft (1859) *Das Paradies der Gesundheit, das verlorene und das wiedergefundene (1865) *Praktische Handbuch der Naturgem\u00e4ssen Heilweise (1865) *Der Naturarzt (1870) *Der Hausarzt (1878) ==See also== *Eduard Baltzer *Wilhelm Zimmermann ==References== Category:1824 births Category:1883 deaths Category:Anti- vivisectionists Category:German male non-fiction writers Category:Hydrotherapists Category:Naturopaths Category:People from Ludwigslust Category:Vegetarianism activists ",
