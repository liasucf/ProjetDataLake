    "text": "The Crescenta Valley is a small inland valley in Los Angeles County, California, lying between the San Gabriel Mountains on the northeast and the Verdugo Mountains and San Rafael Hills on the southwest. It opens into the San Fernando Valley at the northwest and the San Gabriel Valley at the southeast. It is nearly bisected by the Verdugo Wash, a smaller valley separating the Verdugo Mountains from the San Rafael Hills. Most of the valley lies at an elevation of over 1,500 feet (450 m). ==History== Crescenta Valley was a pastoral area under the Rancho Tujunga, Rancho San Rafael and Rancho La Canada land grants during the Spanish and Mexican periods. The first American settler in the valley was Theodore Pickens, who settled at the top of today's Briggs Avenue in 1871. The western portion of Rancho La Canada, which included the major portion of the valley, was subdivided in 1881 into 10-acre parcels by Dr. Benjamin B. Briggs. Significant suburban residential development began with the opening of the Montrose subdivision in 1913, accelerating significantly after World War II. Today, the Crescenta Valley is a mature suburban area. The name \"Crescenta\" does not derive from the Spanish word for \"crescent\", which is el creciente. Benjamin Briggs coined the name from the English word \"crescent\" because he could see three crescent-shaped formations from his home,Gudde, Erwin G. (1998). California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographic Names, 4th ed. Berkeley: University of California Press. or because of the shape of the valley.Dougherty, June (1993). Sources of History: La Crescenta. Privately printed. The post office was established in 1888, with the Post Office adding the \"La\" to the name to distinguish it from Crescent City, California. ==Communities== Incorporated cities, districts of Los Angeles, districts of Glendale, and unincorporated census-designated places in the Crescenta Valley include: * City of La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge * Crescenta Highlands (also known as \"Glendale Annex\"): City of Glendale * La Crescenta-Montrose: unincorporated LA county & City of Glendale * Montrose: City of Glendale * Sunland: City of Los Angeles * Tujunga: City of Los Angeles * Verdugo City: City of Glendale ==Weather== Daytime temperatures are generally 10 to 15 \u00b0F (6 to 8 \u00b0C) warmer than those in coastal regions during summer. Winter is somewhat colder than most L.A. area stations. Winter snow is rare, but not unknown on the valley floor. Because of proximity to the mountains, rainfall is generally higher than most Los Angeles area locations, averaging around 20 inches per year, mostly falling between November and March. ==References== ==External links== * Crescenta Valley Chamber of Commerce * Historical Society of Crescenta Valley * Crescenta Valley Weekly Category:Geography of Los Angeles Category:Geography of the San Fernando Valley Category:Geography of the San Gabriel Valley Category:Glendale, California Category:La Ca\u00f1ada Flintridge, California Category:Los Angeles County, California regions Category:San Gabriel Mountains Category:San Rafael Hills Category:Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles Category:Valleys of California Category:Valleys of Los Angeles County, California Category:Verdugo Mountains ",
