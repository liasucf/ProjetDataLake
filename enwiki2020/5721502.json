    "text": "Roman road Sarn Helen on the left of the image The Maen Madoc or Maen Madog stone is a menhir which lies adjacent to the Roman road Sarn Helen that runs across the Brecon Beacons in what was a key area of Roman Wales, about one mile (2km) north of Ystradfellte. It stands approximately 10 feet high. It is thought to mark a Christian burial \u2013 the stone is inscribed on one side, the Latin inscription reading DERVAC(IVS) FILIVS IVSTI (H)IC IACIT \u2013 \"Of Dervacus, Son of Justus. He lies here\". Though the stone is named after a Madoc, nothing is known of the Madoc referred to. The base of stone is surrounded by deeply embedded stones and this may mark the grave itself. Maen Madoc can be found at on the Brecon Beacons West and Central map. == External links == *Photos of Maen Madoc and surrounding area on geograph Category:Megalithic monuments in Wales Category:Fforest Fawr Category:Scheduled monuments in Powys Category:Archaeological sites in the Brecon Beacons National Park ",
