In 1799, he sold it to Charles Merryman Hall. His brother, William Hall, purchased 249 acres of the land from Charles in 1800. The house was built circa 1805 for William Hall, and it was designed in the Federal architectural style. Hall, his wife, his son and his daughter lived here with his forty slaves until 1820. It was purchased by Thomas Harding, who acquired up to 1,000 acres by 1847. James Anderson purchased the plantation in 1847, and he sold 200 acres and the house to Thomas McCampbell in 1852.
