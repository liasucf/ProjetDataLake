In Lucha Libre the Lucha de Apuetas match is considered more prestigious than a championship match and a lot of the major shows feature one or more Apuesta matches. The Guerra de Titanes show is hosted by a new location each year, emanating from cities such as Madero, Chihuahua, Chihuahua, Mexico City, Guadalajara, Jalisco and more. The 2014 Guerra de Titanes show was the seventeenth show in the series. ===Storylines=== The Guerra de Titanes show featured sixprofessional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines.
