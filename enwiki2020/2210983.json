    "text": "Cabarrus County Schools is a local education agency headquartered in Concord, North Carolina. The system presides over the vast majority of Cabarrus County, North Carolina, the exception being an area of Kannapolis in the northern part of the county that operates its own district. Over 32,000 students are enrolled in Cabarrus County Schools, and the school system employs over 2200 teachers. The current superintendent is Dr. Chris Lowder. The previous superintendent, Dr. Barry Shepherd, retired April 1, 2015. == Schools == ===Traditional K-12 schools=== The following lists the high schools of the system, including their feeder elementary and middle schools. Some exceptions to the following diagram exist, but this depiction is typically accurate.

In 2001 the county opened Jay M. Robinson High School, the first new high school in Cabarrus County in 35 years. However, new schools at all three levels tend to become quickly overcrowded (Robinson High School, built for 1,500 students, opened in the fall of 2005 with nearly 1,800 students enrolled). Therefore, new schools are being constantly planned and added, with eight new schools having been constructed since 1996 (plus four new buildings for outdated existing schools). The 2016\u201317 school year saw an opening of another new elementary school, the Odell 3\u20135 building (Odell Elementary School), which was constructed on the old Odell site. The Odell already in place will become the K-2 building and will be called Odell Primary School. Two new schools are scheduled to open in the 2020-21 school year, West Cabarrus High School as well as Hickory Ridge Elementary School. == Soccer partnership == Since 2005 FC Carolina Alliance Youth Soccer Club has served as the administrator for Cabarrus County Schools Middle School Soccer League. FCCA provides the venue, schedule, uniforms, coaches, referees, and end-of- season awards for a successful middle school soccer program. The program is open to all middle school boys and girls. Each school may enter a maximum of 2 teams in the boy\u2019s league, and 2 teams in the girl\u2019s league. (If a school is only able to form a co-ed team then that team will play in the boys division.) The program is run in a league format with an end-of-season play off tournament. Each team plays between 8\u201312 games, depending on their play-off results. The partnership with FCCA was terminated in 2014. FCCA also works with Cabarrus County School's \"Kid's Plus\" after-school program, providing free soccer clinics to Cabarrus County elementary schools. ==See also== *Cabarrus County, North Carolina *Kannapolis City Schools *List of school districts in North Carolina ==References== ==External links== *Cabarrus County Schools *Cabarrus County Schools' ABC's Report Card * Category:Education in Cabarrus County, North Carolina Category:School districts in North Carolina Category:Educational institutions established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in North Carolina ",
