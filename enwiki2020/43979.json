    "text": "T\u00f3rshavn (; lit. 'Thor's harbour'; , ) is the capital and largest city of the Faroe Islands. It is in the southern part on the east coast of Streymoy. To the northwest of the city lies the mountain H\u00fasareyn, and to the southwest, the Kirkjub\u00f8reyn. They are separated by the Sand\u00e1 River. The city itself has a population of 19,165 (2019), and the greater urban area has a population of 21,078. The Norse established their parliament on the Tinganes peninsula in AD 850. T\u00f3rshavn thus became the capital of the Faroe Islands and has remained so ever since. All through the Middle Ages the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T\u00f3rshavn. Early on, T\u00f3rshavn became the centre of the islands' trade monopoly, thereby being the only legal place for the islanders to sell and buy goods. In 1856, the trade monopoly was abolished and the islands were left open to free trade. == History == === Early history === It is not known whether the site of T\u00f3rshavn was of interest to the Celtic monks who were probably the first settlers in the Faroes. The Viking settlers in the 9th century established their own parliaments, called tings, in different parts of the islands, it being the tradition in each case to hold the ting at a neutral and thus uninhabited place, so no one location gave anyone an advantage. The main ting for the islands was convoked in T\u00f3rshavn in 825, on Tinganes, the peninsula that divides the harbour into two parts: Eystarav\u00e1g and Vestarav\u00e1g. The Vikings would thus meet on the flat rocks of Tinganes every summer, as the most central place on the islands, although there was no settlement at Tinganes at that time. The F\u00e6reyinga Saga says: \"the place of the ting of the Faroese was on Streymoy, and there is the harbour that is called T\u00f3rshavn\". The Viking age ended in 1035. The ting was followed by a market which gradually grew into a permanent trading area. All through the Middle Ages, the narrow peninsula jutting out into the sea made up the main part of T\u00f3rshavn. It belonged to the outfield of two farmers. Unlike other Faroese villages, T\u00f3rshavn was never a distinct farming community. During the 12th century, all trade between Norway and the Faroes, along with other tributary islands to the west, became centralised in Bergen. In 1271, a royal trade monopoly was established in T\u00f3rshavn by the Norwegian Crown. According to a document from 1271, two ships would sail regularly to T\u00f3rshavn from Bergen with cargoes of salt, timber and cereal. T\u00f3rshavn therefore had more contact with the outside world than did the other villages. Under the Norwegian, and then Danish rule, government officials made T\u00f3rshavn their home. All of these things, combined with the fact that T\u00f3rshavn was the seat of the ting of the islands, influenced the town's development. === 1500\u20131800 === Skansin fort has been rebuilt several times since it was first built in 1580. The current building dates back to 1790 Sources do not mention a built- up area in T\u00f3rshavn until after the Protestant reformation in 1539. In ca. 1580 a small fort, Skansin, was built by the Faroese naval hero and trader Magnus Heinason at the north end of the harbour. Later small fortifications were built at Tinganes. In 1584 T\u00f3rshavn had 101 inhabitants. The population was divided into three equally large groups made up of farmers, their families and servants, trade and government officials and people who owned no land and therefore not much else; this included the landless proletariat from the villages that during this period came to T\u00f3rshavn in search of work. They were set to guard duty on Skansin without pay, and for clothing and food they depended on the bounty of the farmers. In 1655 king Frederick III of Denmark granted the Faroe Islands to his favourite statesman Kristoffer Gabel, the rule of the von Gabel Family, 1655\u20131709, is known as Gablat\u00ed\u00f0in. It is the darkest chapter in the history of T\u00f3rshavn. Gabel's administration suppressed the islanders in various ways. The trade monopoly was in the family's hands and it was not designed for the needs of the Faroese people. People across the country brought products into town and had to be satisfied with whatever price they were given. At the same time imported goods were limited and expensive. There came considerable complaints from the islands' inhabitants of unjust treatment by the civil administration in T\u00f3rshavn. These not only included the persons in charge of the monopoly trade, but also the bailiff and others. It was during this period, in 1673, that Tinganes was ravaged by a fire after a store of gunpowder kept at Tinganes had blown up. Many old houses burnt to the ground and old Faroese records were lost as were Gabel's documents. Conditions improved in T\u00f3rshavn when the trade monopoly became a royal monopoly in 1709. The Danish royal trade monopoly was supplied with goods from Copenhagen three times a year. However, in 1709 T\u00f3rshavn was hit by a plague of smallpox, killing nearly the entire population. The town had by this time reached a population of 300 and 250 of the inhabitants died. Still, it was during the latter half of the 18th century that T\u00f3rshavn started to develop into a small town. This was while Niels Ryberg was in charge of the trade monopoly. From 1768 and during the next 20 years onwards Ryberg was allowed to carry on an entrepot trade which was mainly based on smuggling to England. Because of the French-British conflict there was room for this kind of operation. In T\u00f3rshavn his warehouses filled up with goods. Ryberg was the first person who thought of making a financial profit from fishing, which later became the most important economic factor to the islands. He experimented with salted cod and herring but at this point in time nothing much beyond this happened. T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral was first built in 1788 and partly rebuilt in 1865. Since 1990, it has been the seat of the Bishop of the Faroe Islands (in the Church of the Faroe Islands). === 1800\u2013present === T\u00f3rshavn in 1839, by Barth\u00e9lemy Lauvergne On 30 March 1808, during the Anglo-Danish Gunboat War, the Cruizer class brig- sloop HMS Clio entered T\u00f3rshavn and briefly captured the fort at Skansin. The fort surrendered without firing a shot as the landing party approached. The Clios men spiked the fort's eight 18-pounder guns and took all the smaller guns and weapons before leaving. Shortly after 6 May a German privateer who had assumed the name \"Baron von Hompesch\" plundered the defenceless city and seized the property of the Danish Crown Monopoly. The Admiralty Prize Court, however, refused to condemn it as a lawful prize. T\u00f3rshavn in 1864, the L\u00f8gting (parliament) is at top left In 1856, free trade came to the Faroe Islands. By opening the islands to the world, it transformed the economy, with T\u00f3rshavn at its centre. The farming land was rented to townspeople who could later buy it if they wished. These small plots of land enabled people to keep cows and sheep. In 1866, T\u00f3rshavn's town council was founded. The town has been the capital of the Faroe Islands ever since. Later, in 1909, T\u00f3rshavn became a market town with the same municipal charter as Danish market towns. In 1913, the Danish Folketing granted DKK 810,000 to construction of a harbour in T\u00f3rshavn. Local waves are 3m, the waters are icefree and have a tidal variation of 0.3m, and storms from the west are mitigated by the gentle eastwards slope of the mountains. Other harbours were also benefitted with an 80% grant to a total build cost of DKK 1.6 million. In 1927, T\u00f3rshavn had a modern harbour built. This made it possible for larger ships to berth. During the British occupation of the Faroe Islands in World War II, Skansin was used as the headquarters of the Royal Navy Command, and two 5.5-inch guns used aboard before World War II were deployed.[http://www.navweaps.com/Weapons/WNBR_55-50_mk1.htm British 5.5\"/50 (14 cm) BL Mark I] In 1974, the neighbouring villages Hoyv\u00edk and Hv\u00edtanes were made part of the town area. Later, even more municipalities joined the T\u00f3rshavn municipality. In 1978 Kaldbak, in 1997 Argir, in 2001 Kollafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur, and finally in 2005, Kirkjub\u00f8ur, Hestur, and N\u00f3lsoy. == Climate == T\u00f3rshavn Harbour Ferry Terminal, view towards Tinganes and 'Vesturb\u00fdur' The Western Town T\u00f3rshavn features a subpolar oceanic climate (Cfc) with average summer highs around and average winter highs around , and with winter lows averaging just above freezing, and frequent cloudy skies. Average monthly precipitation is highest in autumn and winter, peaking in January, owing to frequent, intense storms crossing the area from the North Atlantic Ocean, while May and June are markedly drier months. Because of the cloudy weather and the ice-free water surrounding T\u00f3rshavn, its winter temperatures are exceptionally mild for such a northerly location. However, summer temperatures are much lower than those found in continental Scandinavia on similar parallels. The temperature amplitude in the period from 1961 to 2010 is a mere between the absolute warmest and coldest temperatures. == Politics and government == T\u00f3rshavn is the capital of the Faroe Islands, and as such is the seat of the Faroes\u2019 self rule government. The government holds the executive power in local government affairs. Today a part of the government is located on the Tinganes peninsula of T\u00f3rshavn, the Prime Minister's office is here and the Ministry of Internal Affairs was here until it was closed in 2013. The other ministries are located in other office buildings in various places in T\u00f3rshavn, i.e. the Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Social Affairs are located near the Hospital of the Faroes in Eirargar\u00f0ur, and the Ministry of Finance is located in Argir in a building called Albert Hall on the street Kv\u00edggjart\u00fan. The parliament, the L\u00f8gting, which was originally located on Tinganes, was relocated to the town square, Vagli\u00f0, in 1856. == Sport == T\u00f3rsv\u00f8llur, the home stadium of the Faroe Islands national football team A boat race at the J\u00f3ans\u00f8ka Festival in Tv\u00f8royri in June 2011. T\u00f3rshavn, as the capital city, is the centre of sport in the islands; the largest sports centre is located in the Gundadalur district of T\u00f3rshavn. Also, the largest football stadium, T\u00f3rsv\u00f8llur, is located here, seating 6,000 spectators. The stadium serves as home to the Faroe Islands national football team. Around the city there are also two other football pitches, indoor tennis courts, badminton courts and a swimming pool. The city has several football clubs, including three Premier League teams: HB T\u00f3rshavn, B36 T\u00f3rshavn and Argja B\u00f3ltfelag. Other football clubs with connections to the city are FF Giza (N\u00f3lsoy), FC Hoyv\u00edk and Undri\u00f0 FF. Handball is the second most popular sport in T\u00f3rshavn. The city's handball teams are Kyndil, Neistin and \u00cdtr\u00f3ttafelagi\u00f0 H71 and the Faroe Island's national handball team practice in the city. T\u00f3rshavn city has several popular rowing clubs, including, Havnar R\u00f3\u00f0rarfelag and R\u00f3\u00f0rarfelagi\u00f0 Kn\u00f8rrur. Every year in July the Tour of Faroe Islands, which is a road bicycle race, is held around the islands. The race is called Kring F\u00f8royar (Tour de Faroe / Around the Faroes), it starts in Klaksv\u00edk and ends in T\u00f3rshavn. == Music == The T\u00f3rshavn Jazz Festival has been held annually since 1983. It attracts musicians from all over North America and Europe and has become a popular tourist event. == Transport == A map of T\u00f3rshavn showing road links The harbour is served by the Smyril Line international ferry service to Denmark and Iceland. The harbour is also used by domestic ferry services of Strandfaraskip Landsins within the Faroe Islands, chiefly on the route to Tv\u00f8royri. The town is served by Busslei\u00f0in \u2013 a network of local buses, with the service identified by its red livery. T\u00f3rshavn's Busslei\u00f0in has five routes and is operated by the T\u00f3rshavn municipality. Buses within T\u00f3rshavn have been completely free of charge since 2007. This is a green initiative intended to persuade people to use public transportation rather than drive their cars. Like Bygdalei\u00f0ir, the actual buses are privately owned, but contracted to Busslei\u00f0in. Buses also depart to villages throughout the islands. In addition, there is a helipad by the coast. == Sites of interest == T\u00f3rshavn Cathedral and Bryggjubakki street (left) and Undir Bryggjubakka street (right) at the centre of the city Listasavn F\u00f8roya on a national stamp, 1995. * Tinganes, the old part of town, is still made up of small wooden houses covered with turf roofs.
