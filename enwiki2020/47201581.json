    "text": "Results by ward. Elections to elect all members (councillors) of Thanet District Council were held on 5 May 2011, as part of the 2011 United Kingdom local elections taking place simultaneously with the Alternative Vote Referendum. No political party won an overall majority of seats, meaning that the council went into 'No Overall Control' status for the first time since 1991. The Conservative Party ran a minority administration until December that year, when a Conservative councillor defected to the Independents group, enabling The Labour Party to run a minority administration until 2015. The District has as its main towns the beach resort towns of Ramsgate, Margate and Broadstairs. ==Overall Results== After the election, the composition of the council is:http://democracy.thanet.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=49&RPID;=9538617 {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !+/\u2013 !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |align=left|Conservative Party||40,813||46.58|| ||27||6 |- |align=left|Labour Party||33,498||38.24|| ||26||7 |- |align=left|Liberal Democrats||2,302||2.63|| ||0|| |- |align=left|UK Independence Party||1,673||1.91|| ||0|| |- |align=left|Ramsgate First||519||0.59|| ||0||1 |- |align=left|Green Party||283||0.32|| ||0|| |- |align=left|Independent(s)||8,522||9.73|| ||3|| |- |- |align=left|Total||87,610||100||0||56||0 |- !colspan=6| |- |align=left|Valid ballots cast||39,318||98.60||colspan=3 rowspan=4| |- |align=left|Invalid/blank ballots cast||559||1.40 |- |align=left|Total ballots cast||39,877||100 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||93,589||42.61 |- |align=left colspan=6|Source: BBC |} ==Results by ward== Listed below are the resultshttp://democracy.thanet.gov.uk/mgElectionResults.aspx?ID=49&RPID;=9538676 in each of the 26 wards of Thanet District Council.
