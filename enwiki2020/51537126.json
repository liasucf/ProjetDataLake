    "text": "The IIT Delhi metro station is located on the Magenta Line of the Delhi Metro. It was opened to public on 29 May 2018. == Controversy == Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi (IIT-D) has approached the authorities to remove the mention of IIT or the coaching institute FIITJEE from the name of the Metro station near its campus, saying it could mislead students into thinking they have a tie-up. FIITJEE has become the sponsor of the soon-to-be opened Metro station opposite IIT-D. Signage installed at the station has named it FIITJEE IIT, coupling the two names. IIT Delhi has approached the high court opposing the naming rights of a metro station near the institute being acquired by a coaching institute. High Court decided in favor of IIT and ordered to remove FIITJEE branding from the IIT Metro Station. The new signage displays only the institute's name along with that of Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). On this the director of IIT Delhi quoted to media \"We never wanted the IIT\u2019s name to be associated with any coaching institute holding commercial interests. We are happy the issue has been settled, BIS is a good brand to be associated with as it aligns with the image of our institute. Both (IITD and BIS) set standards in their own domains,\u201d said Rao. The BIS is the national standards body of India working under the aegis of ministry of consumer affairs, food & public distribution.\" ==History== ==Station layout== {|table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 valign=top|G |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100 valign=top|Street Level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=390 valign=top|Exit/ Entrance |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|M |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Mezzanine |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\"|Fare control, station agent, Ticket/token, shops |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=50 rowspan=3 valign=top|P |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=100|Eastbound |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px white;\" width=390|Platform 1 \u2192 Toward Botanical Garden |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border- right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text-align:center;\" colspan=2|Island platform, doors will open on the right |- |style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=100|Westbound | style=\"border-bottom:solid 1px gray;\" width=\"390\" |Platform 2 Toward \u2190 Janakpuri West |} ===Track Layout=== ==Entry/exit== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" width=\"65%\" |- ! align=\"center\" colspan=\"5\" style=\"background:#;\"| IIT Delhi metro station Entry/exits |- ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Gate No-1 ! style=\"width:15%;\"|Gate No-2 |- | || |- | || |- | || |- | || |} == Connections == ===Bus=== Delhi Transport Corporation bus routes number 344, 448, 448B, 448CL, 507CL, 620, 764, 764EXT, 764S, 774, AC-620, AC-764, serves the station from nearby IIT Gate bus stop. ==See also== *Delhi *List of Delhi Metro stations *Transport in Delhi *Delhi Metro Rail Corporation *Delhi Suburban Railway *Delhi Monorail *Delhi Transport Corporation *South East Delhi *Indian Institute of Technology Delhi *National Capital Region (India) *List of rapid transit systems *List of metro systems ==References== ==External links== * Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd. - Official site * Delhi Metro Annual Reports * * Category:Delhi Metro stations Category:Railway stations in South Delhi district ",
