He is a graduate of both Oxford and Cambridge. He embraced Orthodox Judaism in his early twenties. ==Career== Blaker produced and directed Little Britain for BBC Radio 4. From 2012-13, he was producer, as well as co-creator and co-writer (with Matt Lucas) of The Matt Lucas Awards, a BBC TV show in which Blaker appeared on-screen in one episode. In 2017, he was commissioned by the BBC to create a show called \"Ashley Blaker's Goyish Guide To Judaism\",https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0b4zg8c#:~:text=BBC%20Radio%204.-,Ashley%20Blaker%2C%20Britain's%20only%20ultra%2DOrthodox%20stand%20up%20comedian%2C,world%20of%20strict%20Orthodox%20Judaism. described as \"an insider's view of his religion\"\".

And since we rarely hear the perspective of the ultra-Orthodox in comedy clubs, there\u2019s a pleasing freshness about an act that offers a look into a world often hidden from public view.\" ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:British comedians Category:Contestants on University Challenge Category:Jewish comedians Category:Ashkenazi Jews Category:Orthodox Jews Category:English Jewish writers Category:People educated at Haberdashers' Aske's Boys' School Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Alumni of the University of Cambridge ",
