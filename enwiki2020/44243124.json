The Soma sacrifice that takes twelve-days is called Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha in which a ten-day sequence called d\u0101\u015ba-r\u0101tra, is flanked by two intensive day and overnight sacrifices called atir\u0101tras as opening and closing days. The Agnistoma serves as the paradigm for all Soma sacrifices up to those of twelve days duration, the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha soma sacrifice is paradigmatic for Soma sacrifices of twelve days and more. The Aitareya Brahmana and the Kausitaki Brahmana, belong to the Rig Veda, both preserve this Rig Vedic rite. The Aitareya Brahmana (IV.25) calls the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha sacrifice as the 'sacrifice of Prajapati', and the Jaiminiya Brahmana (III.302) calls the stomas of Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha as the 'powerful sons of Prajapati'. The twelve-days Soma sacrifices are called Ahinas, and the longer ones are called Sattras. The Aitreya Brahmana describes the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha sacrifice in its Pancika IV.iv.23 to V.iv.25, beginning with the origin and the initial ritual of this sacrifice. The first six Prishtha days of the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha sacrifice represent the mouth, the Chandomah days are the seventh to the ninth which represent what is in the mouth as tongue palate and teeth; but that by which one produces articulate sounds of speech or by which one distinguishes sweet and not sweet, is the tenth day which is the 'day of happiness'. Those desirous of prosperity perform this ritual. The fundamental scheme of the sattras is that of a Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha comprising a prayaniya-atiratra (one day), a prishthaya-shada-aha (six days), chandomas (three days), an avivakya (one day) and an udayaniya-atiratra (one day), which programme can be suitably extended. The Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha sacrifice is both, Ahina and Sattra types of Soma sacrifice, the former is Vayudha, and the latter, Samudha. In the Sattra type of session, there is no sacrifice, only Brahmins perform this ritual. In this context, Badarayana states:- :\u0926\u094d\u0935\u093e\u0926\u0936\u093e\u0939\u0935\u0926\u0941\u092d\u092f\u0935\u093f\u0927\u0902 \u092c\u093e\u0926\u0930\u093e\u092f\u0923\u094b\u093d\u0924\u0903 | :\"Hence B\u0101dar\u0101yana considers the released souls to be of both kinds (i.e. with or without bodies and senses) just as it is the case with the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha (twelve- day) sacrifice.\" - (Brahma Sutras IV.iv.12) Shankara explains that when a liberated soul wishes to have a body, he gets one; and when he desires to remain without it, he has none; for his will is true and desires are diverse like the Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha which can be both a sattra and an ahina, because of the injunction about the sacrifice itself and the specification of the sacrificer. And, Gambhirananda clarifies that Dv\u0101da\u015b\u0101ha becomes Ahina when there is injunction about it along with the specification of its performer; it is Sattra when it is resorted to by many performers. ==References== Category:Hindu behaviour and experience Category:Indian philosophy ",
