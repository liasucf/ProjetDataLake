    "text": "The sapphire-spangled emerald (Chionomesa lactea) is a species of hummingbird that occurs in Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia and Brazil from the Amazon south to Santa Catarina; there are uncertain records from east Ecuador. Both male and female have a bright \"sapphire\" blue chest and chin and green-blue abdomen with a well-delineated white stripe. The bill is almost straight with a black upper mandible and pink lower mandible. The emerald is found in forest edges, mountainous regions and gardens in urban areas. The species has an estimated range of 1,500,000 km\u00b2, and while its population size is uncertain, it is believed to be large since it has been described as \"frequent\" in at least some parts of its range. It is not considered to be in decline and has been therefore evaluated as Least concern. It is depicted on the reverse side of the discontinued 1-Brazilian Real banknote. ==References== * ==External links== *Sapphire-spangled Emerald photo gallery VIREO Photo-High Res sapphire-spangled emerald Category:Birds of Brazil Category:Birds of the Bolivian Amazon Category:Birds of the Peruvian Amazon Category:Birds of Venezuela Category:Hummingbird species of South America sapphire-spangled emerald ",
