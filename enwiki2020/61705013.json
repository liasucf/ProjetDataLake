Coached by fourth-year head coach John McLendon, the Tigers finished the season with a 31\u20133 record and were crowned NAIA national champions by winning the 1958 NAIA Tournament. This marked the second of three consecutive national championships, a feat that no other team at any level of college basketball had previously accomplished. In 2019, all three national championship teams were inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. ==Individual honors== * Associated Press Little All-America \u2013 Dick Barnett * NAIA All-America \u2013 Dick Barnett, John Barnhill * NAIA Tournament MVP \u2013 Dick Barnett ==References== Category:Tennessee State Tigers basketball seasons Tennessee AandI Category:NAIA Men's Basketball Tournament championship seasons Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees Tennessee AandI State Basketball Team Tennessee AandI State Basketball Team ",
