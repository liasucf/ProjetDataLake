    "text": "Stormy Weather is a 1935 British comedy film directed by Tom Walls and starring Walls, Ralph Lynn and Robertson Hare. ==Plot== Sir Duncan Craggs retires from the Colonial Service and returns to London with his new French wife. The couple are devoted to each other, but continually flirt with other people. Sir Duncan is appointed to the board of clothing retail chain. On his tour of inspection, he encounters a successful store run by the efficient Mr. Bullock. By contrast, a neighbouring shop is filled with unhelpful staff overseen by an incompetent and lazy manager, Raymond Penny, who is more interested in horseracing than running his shop. Craggs is unimpressed by Penny and summons him to a meeting in London. Both Bullock and his domineering wife travel up to London as well, fearing that Penny will tell Craggs malicious stories about them. Back in London, Mrs. Craggs is horrified to discover she is still married to the White Russian Count Polotsky, whom she had thought was dead. The villainous Polotsky plans to kidnap her and blackmail her new husband. Craggs, Penny and Bullock eventually rescue her from the Chinatown dive where she is being held. It is discovered that Polotsky has married a young Chinese woman and is equally guilty of bigamy. They are able to recover all incriminating evidence as well. In gratitude, Craggs appoints Penny as his assistant. ==Cast== * Tom Walls as Sir Duncan Craggs * Ralph Lynn as Mr. Raymond Penny * Yvonne Arnaud as Louise Craggs * Robertson Hare as Mr. Bullock * Norma Varden as Mrs. Dulcie Bullock * Andrews Engelmann as Count Polotsky * Davy Burnaby as Merritt * Veronica Rose as Trixie Merritt * Stella Moya as Moya * Gordon James as Salt Jasper * Louis Bradfield as Lacey * Fewlass Llewellyn as Pullman * Peter Gawthorne as Police Inspector ==Production== Stormy Weather is based on a story by Ben Travers.
