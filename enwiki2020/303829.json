Despite the club badge stating 1879, primary sources show the club was actually founded on 25 September 1878 during a meeting at Rhyl Town Hall.https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3850959/3850961/2/https://newspapers.library.wales/view/3855684/3855691/55/ The team played its home matches at Belle Vue, which can accommodate 3,000 spectators.content & v by iew=article&id;=120&Itemid;=148 Rhyl FC The club was wound up on 21 April 2020. However, a phoenix club was set up the following month with the new name (voted by the fans association) of CPD Y Rhyl 1879. It was confirmed that the new club has secured the use of the Belle Vue stadium. ==History== Rhyl Football Club was formed on Wednesday, 25 September 1878, following a meeting held at Rhyl Town Hall. At a follow-up meeting a week later, it was decided that the club would play at a field adjacent to the Winter Gardens, and that the club colours would be all black with a white skull and crossbones on the chest. The first club captain was W. C. Langley. The club played in the 1878 Welsh Cup, but lost 1\u20130 in the First Round against Friars School, Bangor. There were several clubs in Rhyl at the time, one of these being Rhyl Grosvenor FC, who played a floodlit match against Rhyl FC in February 1879. Rhyl Grosvenor amalgamated with Rhyl FC in September 1879, prior to the start of the 1879\u201380 season. Rhyl FC became founder members of the Welsh League, formed in 1890, but withdrew the following year. By that point, the club colours were red and black. They reformed as Rhyl Athletic in November 1892 and became founder members of the North Wales Coast League, winning the title in 1894\u201395. Rhyl Amateur joined forces with Rhyl Town in May 1898 and switched to the Anglo-Welsh competition known as The Combination. Despite financial crises, they remained in membership until the league disbanded at the end of the 1910\u201311 season. Under the name of Rhyl United, they rejoined the North Wales Coast League, but following the First World War, they moved to the North Wales Alliance, before becoming founder members of the Welsh National League (North) in 1921. Rhyl won the title in 1925\u201326 and became a limited company in 1928 as Rhyl Athletic. In 1929, Rhyl applied to join the Football League but York City became the only non-league team elected to the Third Division North. With North Wales football in turmoil in the early 1930s, Rhyl sought to realise their ambitions elsewhere. Another unsuccessful application to the Football League was made in 1932 before joining the Birmingham and District League. Seeking relief from the onerous travelling to the Birmingham area, Rhyl Athletic successfully applied to join the Cheshire County League in 1936, at the same time as changing their name back to Rhyl, and began one of the most successful chapters in the club's history. In a post-war purple patch, Rhyl won the league title twice \u2013 in 1947\u201348 and 1950\u201351 \u2013 and the Welsh Cup twice in succession. In 1952, they beat Merthyr Tydfil 4\u20133 and became the first non-league side in the modern era to retain the trophy, by defeating Chester City 2\u20131 the following season. Rhyl had been losing finalists to Cardiff City in 1930 and Crewe Alexandra in 1937, but did not feature in the final again until 1993, when they lost 5\u20130 to Cardiff City. Between 1948 and 1972 Rhyl appeared regularly in the first round proper of the FA Cup. In 1957 Rhyl reached the fourth round proper, beating Notts County 3\u20131 away before losing 3\u20130 away to Bristol City;North Wales football's greatest stories \u2013 No17: Rhyl FC's FA Cup heroics, Grassroots North Wales, 16 April 2019 in 1971 they eliminated Hartlepool United and Barnsley before elimination by compatriots Swansea City. In the Cheshire County League, success eluded them for several years before they won the title in 1972. On the dissolution of the Cheshire County League in 1982, Rhyl became members of the North West Counties League, winning promotion to the Northern Premier League in their first season. In 1992, they reluctantly decided to join the League of Wales, but because their application was received too late, they were placed instead in the Cymru Alliance, the second level of the pyramid system. In 1993\u201394, they won the title by six points and gained promotion to the League of Wales. Over the years, the club have produced players of the highest calibre more than once, including Graham Williams (West Bromwich Albion), Barry Horne (Everton), Andy Jones (Charlton Athletic), Andy Holden (Oldham Athletic) and most recently Lee Trundle (Bristol City) after seeing his career revitalised in his short spell with Rhyl in 2000\u201301. For many years the club struggled in the top flight of Welsh football, but after being taken over by a consortium led by former player Peter Parry, a significant improvement in results saw Rhyl become one of the Welsh Premier League's leading clubs. In season 2003\u201304, the club won the Welsh Premier League, qualifying for the Champions League qualification rounds (though they lost 7\u20131 on aggregate, to Skonto Riga of Latvia in the first qualifying round), and were winners of the League Cup and Welsh Cup, although they lost the final of the FAW Premier Cup 4\u20131 to Wrexham. Rhyl completed a famous quadruple by rounding off the season with a 6\u20130 win against Halkyn United in the Final of the North Wales Coast Challenge Cup. However, these feats were later tainted by the revelation that leading scorer Andy Moran had been taking the banned stimulant Nandrolone throughout the season. Rhyl won many games with late goals, leading to widespread rumours that other players were also taking the drug. Moran was stripped of his Golden Boot as a result, although the results were allowed to stand. Rhyl could not reproduce their quadruple heroics in 2004\u201305. The club finished runners-up in the Welsh Premier League to TNS and also fell to the same team in both the Welsh Cup semi-final and Welsh Premier Cup quarter-final. A defeat to Carmarthen Town in the Final of the Welsh League Cup compounded a trophyless season for The Whites, although European qualification was gained by their runner-up finish in the Welsh Premier League. In 2005\u201306, Rhyl recorded their first-ever win in European competition when they defeated Lithuanian side FK Atlantas 2\u20131 in the home leg of the first qualifying round of the UEFA Cup. Rhyl lost the away leg 3\u20132, but progressed on the away goals rule, the first Welsh team to make the second qualifying round since Barry Town in 1996\u201397. They lost in the second round against Norwegian club Viking F.K., 3\u20131 on aggregate. The Lilywhites claimed more silverware in the 2005\u201306 domestic season when they lifted the Welsh Cup, beating Bangor City 2\u20130 at the Racecourse Ground, and the North Wales Challenge Cup after a 2\u20131 win over Denbigh Town in the Final. A third-placed finish in the Welsh Premier League meant Rhyl would compete for a third year in a row in European Club competitions. Rhyl's 2006\u201307 European adventure in the UEFA Cup was ended at the first round with a 2\u20131 aggregate defeat by Lithuanian side FK S\u016bduva of Marijampole. Back in the UEFA Cup in 2007\u201308, Rhyl achieved a memorable 3\u20131 home win over FC Haka only to be eliminated on away goals after a 2\u20130 defeat in the second leg in Finland. The club participated in the 2008 Intertoto Cup but were defeated in the first round 9\u20133 on aggregate by Bohemians of Ireland. In 2009 Rhyl won the Welsh Premier League for the second time comfortably finishing ahead of nearest challengers Llanelli, beating many club records including most wins in a season and most successive league wins. Rhyl took part in the Champions League starting in the second qualifying round against Partizan of Serbia. However, their efforts proved futile as Rhyl fell to Partizan with an aggregate score of 12\u20130, including an 8\u20130 rout at the Stadion Partizana. On 30 July 2009 Rhyl made an announcement that Allan Bickerstaff had left the club and defender Greg Strong was to become player/manager. On 17 May 2010, it was announced that Rhyl's Welsh Premier licence had been revoked. Their appeal was unsuccessful and they were relegated to the Cymru Alliance. The club finished Cymru Alliance runners-up to gap Connah's Quay in 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312. GAP secured promotion to the Welsh Premier League in 2012, having failed to obtain a domestic licence in 2011, leaving Rhyl as potential favourites for the title in 2012\u201313. From the terraces, Mike Jones was announced as the club's new general manager. Rhyl started the 2012\u201313 season magnificently, winning their first 8 games. On 6 May 2013, having won the league title on 20 April, Rhyl beat Cefn Druids 2\u20130, thereby becoming the first club to complete a Cymru Alliance season unbeaten. In winning 24 matches and drawing 6, Rhyl scored 100 goals and secured promotion back to the Welsh Premier League after an absence of three years. On 20 August 2013, Rhyl announced a three-year sponsorship deal with Corbett Sports that would see the Belle Vue ground renamed as the Corbett Sports Stadium. In May 2015, it was announced that manager Greg Strong had left the club by \"mutual consent\". Former player Gareth Owen was then appointed as manager, with Mark Roberts as his assistant, but a disastrous run of form during which the club won only three matches in all competitions meant Owen and Roberts departed in February 2016. They were replaced by 24-year-old academy director Niall McGuinness, whose father Laurie, a former Rhyl coach, was appointed as assistant manager. On 21 April 2020, the club announced it was going to be wound up after failing to find a \u00a3175,000 investment that would have saved the club. The club's directors cited the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason for its demise. The former club's league position under manager Eddie Maurice Jones at the time was at its worst and lowest in the past 30 years which has been erased due to the club's demise. In May 2020, two members of the old club as well as members of the Rhyl Fan Association formed a phoenix club taking Rhyl's place in working in liaison with the RFA to ballot a new name which resulted in CPD Y Rhyl 1879. A few days later, the new club directors secured the use of the old club's Belle Vue ground for the 2020\u201321 season, with an exclusive option to buy the ground as a whole for the new club. ==Rivalries== Rhyl shared a fierce rivalry with coast neighbours Bangor City with the two being less than apart. Games between the two often drew crowds of over 1,000 and a few have managed to reach over 1,500 spectators, a rarity in the Welsh Premier League. The police presence was often quite large when the two sides meet as away fans travel in their hundreds. On rare occasions, fighting broke out between the rival fans. In recent years Rhyl also shared an initially friendlier, but increasingly hot tempered, derby match with local neighbours Prestatyn Town, mainly due to the two towns being only apart. ==First Team honours== ===League=== *Welsh Premier League: **Winners (2): 2003\u201304, 2008\u201309 **Runners-up (2): 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307 *Cymru Alliance: **Winners(2): 1993\u201394, 2012\u201313 **Runners-up (2): 2010\u201311, 2011\u201312 *Cheshire County League: **Winners (3): 1947\u201348, 1950\u201351, 1971\u201372 **Runners-up (4): 1948\u201349, 1949\u201350, 1951\u201352, 1955\u201356 *Cheshire County League Division Two: **Runners-up (1): 1981\u201382 *North West Counties League: **Runners-up (1): 1982\u201383 *Border Counties Floodlit League: **Runners-up (1): 1972\u201373 ===Cup=== *Welsh Cup: **Winners (4): 1951\u201352, 1952\u201353, 2003\u201304, 2005\u201306 **Runners-up (4): 1926\u201327, 1929\u201330, 1936\u201337, 1992\u201393 *Welsh League Cup: **Winners (2): 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304 **Runners- up (4): 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310 *FAW Premier Cup: **Runners-up (1): 2003\u201304 *Cymru Alliance Cup: ** Winners (2): 1992\u201393, 2011\u201312 ** Runners-up (1): 1993\u201394 *North Wales FA Challenge Cup: ** Winners (14): 1927\u201328, 1929\u201330, 1933\u201334, 1934\u201335, 1938\u201339, 1947\u201348, 1949\u201350, 1950\u201351, 1951\u201352, 1953\u201354, 1954\u201355, 1969\u201370, 2003\u201304, 2005\u201306 *Welsh Amateur Cup: ** Winners (1): 1972\u201373 *Cheshire League Challenge Cup: ** Winners (3): 1948\u201349, 1951\u201352, 1970\u201371 ** Runners-up (2): 1955\u201356, 1957\u201358 *Northern Premier League President's Cup: ** Winners (1): 1984\u201385 ==European results== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
