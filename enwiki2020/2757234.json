He wrote that he \"did not explain the poems - a poem can't be explained - only clarified the background of some expressions.\"CMX === Rota === Rota was published in 2000 and divided the opinions of critics: some criticized his language as not being mature enough for serious poetry, and argued that he makes \"very simple mistakes, the kind they warn you about on writing courses.\"Arvostelu: Rokkarin runous ei kolahda \u203a Ylioppilaslehti Others praised Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 for his mythological visions and the massive intertextuality of the poems.Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4, Rota Vasara | 01.02.2002 | mielipide | Kirja-arvostelu Arcana and Rota were later published as a CD audiobook Arcana & Rota, performed by Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 himself. === Somnia === Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4's third book, Somnia, was a similar success. Jukka Koskelainen of Helsingin Sanomat appreciated Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4's exotic imagery and knowledge of different philosophies and religions, although he felt that the writer's language lacks the finer nuances of some of his more experienced colleagues.Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 A. W. - Somnia - Johnny Kniga 2003 - Kirjat - HS.fi Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 has said in an interview that when Somnia was finished, he thought it was great, but half a year later he started thinking that half of the poems could have been left out.Turun Sanomat Published in 2003, it was Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4's first book for Johnny Kniga publishing company. The first two collections were published by Like. === Mechanema === In Mechanema (2006), the themes of alchemy, metaphysics and ancient mythology were largely put to the background and accompanied by a melancholy everyday tone. Helsingin Sanomat regarded it as Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4's best work so far.Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 A.W. \u2013 Mechanema \u2013 Johnny Kniga 2006 \u2013 Kirjat \u2013 HS.fi The poet himself has stated that there will be another four (or possibly five) books to the same series, and that the starting letters of the books will form a word. According to him, Mechanema started its life as a single epic poem, but the idea was later abandoned because he considered the book would become too hard for both the writer and the reader. == Discography == === With CMX === :See CMX discography. === With Terveet K\u00e4det === *Pahan voima -87 (EP, 1987) *Oma koloni (EP, 1988) *Anno Domini (EP, 1989)Yrj\u00e4n\u00e4 === With Nelj\u00e4 baritonia === *\"Pop-musiikkia\" (single, 1997) ==References== == External links == Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:People from Kemi Category:Finnish rock singers Category:Finnish male singers Category:Finnish- language singers Category:Finnish bass guitarists Category:Writers from Lapland (Finland) Category:20th-century Finnish poets Category:CMX (band) Category:21st-century Finnish poets Category:Finnish male poets Category:Male bass guitarists ",
