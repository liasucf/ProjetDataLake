    "text": "Season twenty-one of the American television competition series Dancing with the Stars premiered on September 14, 2015. On November 24, 2015, Bindi Irwin and her partner Derek Hough were crowned champions. Nick Carter and Sharna Burgess finished second, Alek Skarlatos and Lindsay Arnold placed third. This season set records for the total number of perfect scores awarded (23) and the number of stars to receive at least one perfect score with 7 (Bindi Irwin, Nick Carter, Alek Skarlatos, Carlos PenaVega, Tamar Braxton, Alexa PenaVega, and Andy Grammer). Irwin also set a record with 8 perfect scores (a record broken in season 25 by Jordan Fisher) and became the second youngest winner of the show at 17 years old (after season 8 winner Shawn Johnson, who was 3 days younger at the time of her win, and later slipped to third behind season 23 winner Laurie Hernandez, who was 16 years old at the time of her win). This also marked Hough's sixth competitive win, extending his own record for the most wins for a professional dancer on the series. ==Cast== ===Couples=== On August 19, 2015, nine professional dancers were revealed during Good Morning America. Karina Smirnoff, who did not appear in season 20 returned for season 21. Anna Trebunskaya and Louis van Amstel would be returning after a five- season hiatus. Additionally, Lindsay Arnold would also be returning after spending the last four seasons in the troupe. While Peta Murgatroyd (who was to be paired with Andy Grammer) was originally announced as a professional, was sidelined for the season by an ankle injury, Allison Holker replaced her spot in the cast; Artem Chigvintsev and Kym Johnson also did not return. Bindi Irwin was the first celebrity revealed on August 24, on GMA; other celebrities were revealed at different dates through different media. The full cast of celebrities and professional dancers was revealed on September 2, 2015, on GMA. During the show, two celebrities (Kim Zolciak-Biermann and Tamar Braxton) withdrew during the competition due to health issues, marking the first time two contestants withdrew in midseason (Nancy O'Dell and Jewel both withdrew from Season 8 before the first episode). {| class= \"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin:auto; align: center\" |- !

After twenty seasons, Len Goodman did not return this season as a judge; in a video message during the finale, Goodman announced he would return for season 22. Season 19 champion Alfonso Ribeiro filled in for Tom Bergeron on October 5, 2015, when Bergeron went to be with his ailing father Raymond Bergeron, who subsequently died on October 12, 2015.

After suffering a mini-stroke, Kim Zolciak-Biermann was able to rehearse, but her doctors refused to clear her for air travel. As a result, she was unable to attend the dress rehearsal and the live show, which, according to the show's rules, meant she would have to withdraw from the competition. Had she not withdrawn from the competition, either Andy & Allison or Paula & Louis would have been eliminated that night. Her dance partner, Tony Dovolani, performed their routine during the live show with stand-in Jenna Johnson. There was no additional elimination. ;Running order {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:95%; |- ! style=\"width:13%;\"| Couple ! style=\"width:11%;\"| Scores ! style=\"width:10%;\"| Style ! style=\"width:35%;\"| Song / original artist ! style=\"width:13%;\"| TV show ! style=\"width:13%;\"| Result |- |Carlos & Witney |31 (7, 8, 8, 8) |Jazz |\"Thank You for Being a Friend\"\u2014Cynthia Fee |The Golden Girls |Safe |- |Paula & Louis |20 (5, 5, 5, 5) |Samba |\"The Ballad of Gilligan's Isle\"\u2014The Eligibles |Gilligan's Island |Last to be called safe |- |Tamar & Val |33 (8, 9, 8, 8) |Tango |\"A Beautiful Mine\"\u2014RJD2 |Mad Men |Safe |- |Alexa & Mark |36 (9, 9, 9, 9) |Jazz |\"Breaking Bad Theme\"\u2014Dave Porter |Breaking Bad | Safe |- |Andy & Allison |29 (7, 7, 8, 7) |Quickstep |\"Bandstand Boogie\"\u2014Larry Elgart |American Bandstand |Last to be called safe |- |Gary & Anna |25 (6, 7, 6, 6) |Tango |\"The Addams Family Theme\"\u2014Vic Mizzy |The Addams Family |Safe |- |Alek & Lindsay |33 (8, 8, 9, 8) |Tango |\"Bad Things\"\u2014Jace Everett |True Blood |Safe |- |Kim & Tony |N/A |Samba |\"Jeannie\"\u2014Hugo Montenegro |I Dream of Jeannie |Withdrew |- |Bindi & Derek |32 (8, 8, 8, 8) |Quickstep |\"Movin' on Up\"\u2014Ja'net Dubois |The Jeffersons |Safe |- |Nick & Sharna |36 (9, 9, 9, 9) |Viennese Waltz |\"Did I Make the Most of Loving You?\"\u2014Mary-Jess Leaverland |Downton Abbey |Safe |- |Hayes & Emma |30 (7, 8, 7, 8) |Jive |\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Theme\"\u2014Chuck Lorre & Dennis C.
