    "text": "Cuss\u00fcl an Tavas Kern\u00f4wek (formerly Cussel an Tavas Kern\u00fbak) - The Cornish Language Council - is an association founded in 1987 to teach, research and further the Cornish language in Cornwall (Cornish: Kernow), UK. Since the adoption of a Standard Written Form of Cornish (SWF) in 2008, it has worked closely with other bodies to achieve these aims. The Cuss\u00fcl encourages research into the Cornish of all periods but has a particular interest in developments after c.1600 and accordingly recommends a standard pronunciation based on c. 1600 to 1700. The Cuss\u00fcl largely draws its inspiration from those who attempted to save the language in the 18th century. The Cuss\u00fcl is run by volunteers and is a network of associates rather than a formal membership organization. ==See also== * List of topics related to Cornwall * Cornish language ==External links== *Cussel an Tavas Kernuak website Cornish language Category:Organisations based in Cornwall Category:Celtic language advocacy organizations ",
