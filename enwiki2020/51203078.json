Trinian had quite a reputation at the time, not all of it laudatory. Pulp pundit Rick Ollerman calls him \u201cone of the most realistic of the Gold Medal writers.\u201d\" \"(Marko), who was pals with Richard Brautigan, Allen Ginsberg, and Jack Kerouac, (as well as most of the Beat Poets, Writers and personalities of the day), lived the lives he writes about.\" John Trinian, North Beach Girl/Scandal on the Sand. \"Two California novels, both published in 1960. North Beach Girl is a twisted tale set in the world of San Francisco\u2019s beatniks, and Scandal is the story of a dozen strangers thrown together on an isolated stretch of beach with a dying whale and a sadistic cop. The double reprint includes new introductions by Rick Ollerman, Ki Longfellow and Belle Marko.\" \"Trinian's daughter, the artist Belle Marko, and a mid-volume remembrance by the novelist Ki Longfellow who, beginning when she was still a teenager, was Trinian's \"soul-mate\" \"May, 2014 : (Rick Ollerman's) In Pursuit of a Pleasant Oblivion originally appeared in North Beach Girl / Scandal on the Sand\" \"(Belle Marko), who wrote a short essay about him that appears in a forthcoming edition of his books, makes it clear that having him as a father was both a fascinating and difficult experience.\" \"Brautigan shared his notes and observations with Zekial Marko (the \"aspiring Hollywood scriptwriter\" noted in the story), Philip Whalen, Lew Welch, and others. He incorporated several of their remarks into his final story\" Richard Brautigan. \"The Menu/1965\" Evergreen Review (42) August 1966: 30-32, 86.
