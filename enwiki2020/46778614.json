    "text": "To Duke is an album by American jazz pianist Matthew Shipp, which was recorded in 2014 and released on the French RogueArt label. The album is a tribute to Duke Ellington, featuring Shipp's trio with bassist Michael Bisio and drummer Whit Dickey playing seven Ellington classics plus some Shipp compositions. ==Reception== The Down Beat review by Bradley Bambarger notes that \"Shipp\u2019s instrument has been captured well on To Duke\u2014whether he\u2019s playing glittering lines in the Ellingtonia or the prepared-piano phrases of his original \u201cTone Poem For Duke\u201d\u2014so it\u2019s too bad the hardworking rhythm section sounds so woolly and boomy.\"Bambarger, Bradley. To Duke review. Down Beat August 15: page 87. Print. The All About Jazz review by Mark Corroto states \"The trio suggests that if you want to listen to Duke, then buy Ellington records. But if you want to magnify the experience, then try some new music.\"Corroto, Mark.
