    "text": "Bob Greenlee (born July 6, 1941, in Omaha, Nebraska) is the executive director of the Greenlee Family Foundation. Greenlee was also the Republican mayor of Boulder, Colorado from 1998 to 1999 and city council member from 1983-1999. In 1998, he ran a narrowly unsuccessfully race as a moderate pro-choice Republican against Mark Udall in 1998 for Colorado's 2nd Congressional District. He was educated at Iowa State University where he received his B.A. in 1963 and M.A. in 1968. After a career in advertising, he purchased several radio stations and co-founded what would become CraftWorks Restaurants & Breweries, of which he is still a board member. He is President of Centennial Investment & Management Company, Inc., a Boulder-based venture capital and real estate firm, In 1997, Iowa State University initiated the Greenlee School of Journalism and Mass Communication in response to a large donation. He and his wife, Diane, have two children. In late December 2016, Greenlee was seriously injured in a highway accident in southern Colorado involving 5 vehicles. Another driver died and two other people were injured. Greenlee was driving the SUV that apparently started the chain reaction. ==2016 car accident== On Wednesday, December 28, 2016, Bob Greenlee and his wife were driving on U.S. 160 westbound across La Veta Pass between Walsenburg and Alamosa in their 2003 Cadillac Escalade. A high-speed passing maneuver by Greenlee apparently set off a chain reaction involving several passenger cars and a tractor trailer truck, resulting in one fatality, two serious injuries and five less-serious injuries. Everyone involved was wearing a seat belt and no one was ejected from a vehicle. Pat (Patricia) Lucero, 70, from Monte Vista died after the Toyota Camry she was driving was struck by Greenlee's vehicle, next hit a tractor trailer, then struck a Kia Spectra. The Greenlees' SUV also struck a BMW X5 head on, causing it to roll and land on its side. Both Greenlee and his wife suffered critical injuries and were hospitalized in two different facilities. In all, seven people were transported, by ground ambulance, to three different hospitals. The highway was closed for a few hours. Initial reports indicated speed was a contributing factor. Six weeks after the accident, a meeting between state patrol investigators and the District Attorney's office was being rescheduled and no charges had been filed. A week later, the news turned to aggressive driving and speed, as investigators reported Greenlee was \"passing improperly\" at 22 mph over the speed limit: 87 mph in a 65 mph zone. On Wednesday, Feb. 22, nine criminal charges were filed against Greenlee: two homicide charges - vehicular, criminally negligent - as well as vehicular assault, two counts of careless driving causing injury, reckless driving, speeding, reckless endangerment and improper passing on the left. Greenlee's court arraignment was set for Tuesday, Mar. 28 in Alamosa. The most serious of the nine charges - vehicular homicide, a Class 4 felony - could lead to a prison sentence of two to six years. In January 2018, Greenlee pleaded guilty to criminally negligent homicide and three other charges, with potential prison time of up 3 years. In late March 2018, Greenlee was sentenced in Costilla District Court to a year of home detention, a $100,000 fine, an annual charitable contribution of $100,000 for the ten-year probation term, and 200 hours of community service. Although the judge called Greenlee's role in the fatal accident \"egregious\u2026 inexplicable conduct\u2026 inexcusable behavior\", he felt that incarceration would essentially be a death sentence and would serve no purpose, and that the $1 million in charitable funds, to an entity selected by the prosecutor, would help the San Luis Valley community. ==Greenlee Family Foundation== The Greenlee Family Foundation is a \"private grant-making organization.\" Its mission is: \"to encourage, preserve and promote the well-being, education, welfare and enlightenment of our fellow citizens by investing in creative people and ideas.\" ==See also== * List of people from Colorado ==References== ==External links== * 1998 CNN Profile * Greenlee Family Foundation Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Mayors of Boulder, Colorado Category:Iowa State University alumni Category:Colorado city council members ",
