The filming of the first season took place between October 2016 and June 2017. The second was filmed during 2018, with all ten episodes airing on 8 November 2019. The first season was received very well by audience and critics alike, some controversy notwithstanding. The production, acting, editing and costume design have all received praise, as have the themes the series deals with. Since March 2020, the series has been available internationally on the Amazon Prime streaming service. == Premise == The series is divided into three seasons and encompasses the period between 1928 and 1940. The first season covers the period just before the assassination of the Croatian Member of the National Assembly Stjepan Radi\u0107 at the National Assembly of the Serbs, Croatians and Slovenians and the subsequent establishment of the the dictatorship. The main setting for the series is Belgrade in between the two world wars. Lead characters are fifty-year-old police inspector Andra Tanasijevi\u0107 \u201cTane\u201c and his new associate, a young forensic by the name of Stanko Pletikosi\u0107. Belgrade is portrayed as a place where crime consists of classic robberies and murders, but whose biggest problems are wars between opium cartels, which use the city as a route for smuggling the drug further into Europe and the United States. The plot of the first season starts with a peculiar and brutal murder occurring at a costume ball at which most of the Belgrade social elite is gathered. Inspector Tanasijevi\u0107 soon discovers that the cause of the eerie events, which multiply by the day, is an ancient relic: namely, the Holy Lance Jesus was pierced with on the cross, which seems to possess mystical power. The Inspector discovers there are people ready to do anything to acquire the Lance, and is sucked into a tangled web of crime involving a range of interest groups: the Russian White army under General Vrangel, the Soviet Union Secret Police (OGPU and NKVD), the Serbian Black Hand movement, IMRO, the Yugoslav communists, elements of the Belgrade underbelly and, not least, a secret society going under the name of Thule. Hot on the crime trail, the Inspector looks for the relic with one aim in mind: to transport it out of Belgrade and thereby prevent further deaths. The series is set to run over three seasons. The first season consists of ten episodes and is set in the run-up to the 6 January dictatorship. The second season also has ten episodes, and deals with the period before the assassination of King Alexander I of Yugoslavia in Marseilles.

The series had a premiere in Serbia on RTS on 12 October 2017 and had a time slot at 8 pm, which has long been the default time slot for all Serbian and Yugoslav TV series. The first episode in Serbia was watched by more than 2.123.000 viewers and was the most watched media on that channel. The premiere in Bosnia and Herzegovina was at the 23rd Sarajevo Film Festival, where two episodes which received ovations were shown. The first season was airing on RTRS. In Montenegro the series is aired on RTCG 1, and in Macedonia on MRT 1. The series debuted in Macedonia at the 38. Manaki Brothers Film Festival in Bitola on 25 September 2017, and Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107, Tomi Salkovski (co- producer), Igor Ivanov Izi (director on one of the episodes) as well as the actors Marija Bergam, Jana Stojanovska, Pero Arsovski and Petar Atanovski addressed the audience. There was a great controversy in Croatian media for not airing the first season, and the reasons cited were that it was due to the character of Ante Paveli\u0107 and also that Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107 himself forbade it. Bjelogrli\u0107 dismissed these claims and said that the main reason for the series not airing in Croatia was because no channel acquired the rights to air. Bjelogrli\u0107 gave 2019 as the year in which the second season will be airing. The name of the series was translated into English as \"Black Sun\" in reference to the eponymous symbol frequently seen in the series, as well as the more literal \"Balkan Shadows\".

Slivnicki-Manastir-MKD.jpg|Slivnica Monastery in North Macedonia, another series set location. == Production and inspiration == Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107 first got interested in the time period in which the series is set while filming the TV series as well as the movie version of Montevideo, God Bless You! He got interested in this period because he knew very little of it and he also thought that the Serbian public in general isn\u2019t well informed about it: \"Our destiny was such that we never learned much about that time period, it was almost never talked about. And those were important and in a way intense times, especially in Yugoslavia.\" The fact that Yugoslavia was called \"Colombia of Europe\" between the two Wars also served as an inspiration to him. In his article for Blic he wrote that he didn\u2019t want to compromise on any part of the show\u2019s creation: \"Shadows over Balkan is a piece for which I tried to make no compromises. There were no compromises on any level and in any phase of the show\u2019s production. From the screenplay, story, themes, national divisions, aesthetics, direction to the budget and cost. I didn\u2019t want to concern myself with the acquired taste of the RTS audience, ratings, political correctness, puritan moral principles, conservative historians, \"first\" and \"second Serbia\", and the like\u2026\" He seriously doubted in the success of the show, because \"in aesthetic, dramaturgic and narrative aspects it was different than everything else he worked on in the past.\" He was inspired by a number of American, German, Italian, Scandinavian and Eastern European TV series, and as the main source of inspiration he cited Boardwalk Empire. He was also inspired by the connection between crime and corruption saying how \"when he put some things in order, he came to the conclusion that there exists a historic constant which affects this region, because it is of utmost importance that when you are working on a piece of art which deals with the past, it is important to focus on the moment from which you are doing it.\" The filming of the first season took place between 1 October 2016 and end of July 2017. The series was shot on many different locations in Belgrade, Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, and a new film studio was also built in Baranda. Poor part of Belgrade from that period was constructed here -Jatagan Mala with fictive kafanas named \"Kod Ni\u0161liju\" (At Ni\u0161ki's) and \"Savsko bure\" (Sava barrel), Pi\u0161toljmala and Savamala), as well as the richer part with a marketplace, a candy shop and a quilt shop, as well as a barber shop. According to Bjelogrli\u0107, 30% of the filming took place in Baranda. Some particular scenes were shot on Zrenjanin streets as well as in its City Hall. Some scenes were supposed to be filmed in Slovenia as well, RTV Slovenija was in support of this, but it was later abandoned due to financial reasons. Together with Bjelogrli\u0107, the screenplay was worked on by screenwriters Danica Pajovi\u0107, Dejan Stojiljkovi\u0107 and Vladimir Kecmanovi\u0107 adapted to a film story by Stevan Koprivica. Koprivica worked on some of the early episodes, and according to Danica Pajovi\u0107, \"the story was a Conan-Doyle type mystical drama about two inspectors who are working on resolving a series of sacrificial murders in Belgrade set between the two Wars. Bjelogrli\u0107 then expanded the theme to the Belgrade underbelly and opium trade in Yugoslavia and convoluted the story to such an extent that Dejan Stojiljkovi\u0107 and I had to join the screenwriters team, with Vladimir Kecmanovi\u0107 also joining us later.\" According to his own words, this was the first time Dejan Stojiljkovi\u0107 wrote a screenplay for a movie or a TV series. Robert Pe\u0161ut \"Magnifico\", with whom Bjelogrli\u0107 already collaborated on Montevideo , worked on the soundtrack for the series. Ognjen \"Ogi\" Radivojevi\u0107 sang the song in the title sequence, and he was chosen by Magnifico and Bjelogrli\u0107 \"because of his specific tone of voice and emotions which emerge from his vocal range.\" Other notable musicians took part in series, such as Nikola Pejakovi\u0107, Ksenija Kulja\u010da etc. == References == == External links == * * Official Twitter page * Official page of Cobra film Category:Cinema of Serbia Category:2010s crime television series Category:Serbian crime television series Category:2017 Serbian television series debuts Category:Fiction set in 1928 Category:Fiction set in 1934 Category:Television shows set in Belgrade Category:Works about the Serbian Mafia ",
