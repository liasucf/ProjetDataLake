    "text": "Michael Tendler (; born 1947) is a Russian-Swedish Physicist, currently (Emeritus) Professor of Fusion Plasma Physics at the Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm (KTH) and Senior Science Expert and member of the External Management Advisory Board of the ITER Organization. == Education == He was educated at Leningrad State University and graduated in Theoretical Physics in 1971 under the supervision of Academician . He left the Soviet Union in 1975 and received his doctorate from Uppsala University in 1978 under the supervision of Erik T. Karlsson. == Career == Tendler moved to the Alfven Laboratory of the Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) as an Associated Professor in 1981 and gradually shifted his interest towards Fusion research. From 1992 until 2002 he was an invited professor at the Institut national de la recherche scientifique, Universit\u00e9 du Qu\u00e9bec, Canada. He became Full Professor at KTH in 2001. He is the former President of International Congress on Plasma Physics. In 2011 he became the Senior science expert at ITER. Tendler serves on the Advisory Committees of National Institute of Fusion Research in Toki (Japan), the Institute of Plasma Physics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and Saint Petersburg State Polytechnic University. == Research == In the 70s Tendler focused on kinetic and statistical properties of gases and plasmas.Michail B Tendler 1977 Phys. Scr. 15 59. doi:10.1088/0031-8949/15/1/005 Over time his research shifted towards thermonuclear fusion and has contributed to crucial issues like magnetic confinement and operation scenarios. In particular he has been instrumental in the theoretical understanding of Plasma rotation and L-H confinement mode transitions.V. Rozhansky, M. Tendler, \u201cThe Effect of the Radial Electric Field on the L-H Transitions in Tokamaks\u201d Physics of Fluids B, Vol. 4, No. 7, 1992 In latter years his research interests broadened into applications of Plasma physics, such as waste treatment.Tendler, M., Rutberg, P., and van Oost, G. 2005. Plasma Based Waste Treatment and Energy Production. Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion 47(5):A219-A230 == Awards == Tendler was awarded the 1999 Ernst Mach Medal in Physics by the Czech Academy of Scienceshttp://www.avcr.cz/en/about-us/awards/medals-of-the-cas/the-ernst- mach-honorary-medal-for-merit-in-the-physical-sciences/awarded-medals/. He was awarded honorary doctorates (Dr.h.c.) from the University of Gent, Belgium, the Russian Academy of Sciences and St. Petersburg State Polytechnical University. He is a (foreign) member of the Russian Academy of Scienceshttp://www.ras.ru/win/db/show_per.asp?P=.id-53806.ln-ru and the Royal Swedish Academy of Engineering Sciences. ==References== Category:Swedish physicists Category:Russian physicists Category:Swedish people of Russian- Jewish descent Category:Saint Petersburg State University alumni Category:KTH Royal Institute of Technology faculty Category:Nuclear physicists Category:1947 births Category:Living people ",
