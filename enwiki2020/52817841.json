    "text": "The dry bed of Wadi Feynan/Wadi Ghuwayr in late spring (May 2014). The archaeological site of Ghuwayr 1 is visible on the rise in the centre-right of the image. Wadi Feynan or Wadi Faynan () is a major wadi (seasonal river valley) and region in southern Jordan, on the border between Tafilah Governorate and Aqaba and Ma'an Governorates. It originates in the southern Jordanian highlands with the confluence of Wadi Dana and Wadi Ghuweyr, and drains into the Dead Sea via Wadi Araba. Historically, the area had the largest copper deposits in the Southern Levant, which were intensively exploited from the Chalcolithic (4500\u20133100 BCE) through to the Mamluk period (1250\u20131516 CE). It also has a number of significant early prehistoric sites. Part of the wadi is included in the Dana Biosphere Reserve. The Royal Society for the Conservation of Nature (RSCN) opened the first of its eco hotels, the Feynan Ecolodge, there in 2005. == Archaeological sites == * Barqa al-Hetiye * Khirbat Faynan * Khirbat en-Nahas * Wadi Faynan 16 == Excavations == Archaeological sites in Faynan have been extensively excavated by the Edom Lowlands Regional Archaeology Project, led by Thomas E. Levy and Mohammad Najjar. Levy and Najjar have argued that Iron Age sites in the region relate to the earliest phases of the Biblical kingdom of Edom. These scholars, along with Erez Ben-Yosef, also argue that Pharaoh Shoshenk I of Egypt (the Biblical \"Shishak\"), who attacked Jerusalem in the 10th century BC, encouraged the trade and production of copper instead of destroying the region. ==See also== *Timna Valley == References == Feynan ",
