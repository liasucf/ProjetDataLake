His father was a railway official. In 1889 he started to train as teacher in Oschatz. Whilst there he became involved with the German Freethinkers League. In 1895 he became the private tutor for the Countess von B\u00fchren, whilst also teaching at \u00d6deran. ==Political career== He joined the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in 1896 and soon established a socialist Sunday school. However he was dismissed as a primary school teacher in 1902, and soon supported himself as a writer and editor of social democratic newspapers in Hamburg, followed by Breslau, Chemnitz, Pirna and Zwickau. R\u00fchle had already became a vocal critic of existing teaching methods and set up a social democratic educational society for the Hamburg area. In 1907 he became an itinerant teacher for the In 1907 he became a traveling teacher of the SPD's educational committee and developed a reputation in the SPD, through his socially critical educational writings: \"Work and Education\" (1904), \"The Enlightenment of Children About Sexual Matters\", (1907), and, above all, \"The Proletarian Child\" (1911). R\u00fchle joined Karl Liebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg, Franz Mehring and others in founding the group and magazine Internationale, which proposed a revolutionary internationalism against a world of warring states. In 1916, R\u00fchle also took part in the Spartacus League. ===Reichstag=== In 1912 he was elected as deputy for Pirna-Sebnitz, in Saxon Switzerland. He represented the SPD in the Reichstag. In 1918, R\u00fchle decided not to seek re-election. Following the disorderly period of time in Germany, 1918\u201319, the dissolution of the Reichstag, which would subsequently be the end of R\u00fchle's term in office, is not exactly known. However, given that the abdication of Wilhelm II was the first event in a series of events that would eventually lead to a new republic, this is the date that shall be put as the end of his term in office. ==The German Revolution== The Spartacus League took an oppositional stance to Leninism and was criticized by the Bolsheviks for inconsistency. Although Liebknecht and Luxemburg were murdered in 1919 for their involvement in the German Revolution, R\u00fchle lived on to participate in the left opposition of the German labour movement, developing both an early communist critique of Bolshevism and an early opposition to fascism. R\u00fchle saw the Soviet Union as a form of state capitalism that had much in common with the state-centred capitalism of the West as well as fascism, saying: > It has served as the model for other capitalistic dictatorships. Ideological > divergences do not really differentiate socioeconomic systems. While R\u00fchle saw the Leninist vanguardist party as an appropriate form for the overthrow of tsarism, it was ultimately an inappropriate form for a proletarian revolution. As such, no matter what the actual intentions of the Bolsheviks, what they actually succeeded in bringing about was much more like the bourgeois revolutions of Europe than a proletarian revolution, arguing: > This distinction between head and body, between intellectuals and workers, > officers and privates, corresponds to the duality of class society. One > class is educated to rule; the other to be ruled. Lenin's organisation is > only a replica of bourgeois society. His revolution is objectively > determined by the forces that create a social order incorporating these > class relations, regardless of the subjective goals accompanying this > process. R\u00fchle was also critical of the party as a revolutionary organisational form, stating that \"the revolution is not a party affair\". As a result, he supported a more council communist approach which emphasised the importance of workers' councils. In October 1921, he was involved in setting up the Allgemeine Arbeiter-Union \u2013 Einheitsorganisation. In Anti-Bolshevik Communism, Paul Mattick describes R\u00fchle as an exemplary radical figure within a German labour movement that had become ossified into various official structures, a perpetual outsider defined by his antagonistic relationship with the labour movement and to Marxism\u2013Leninism as well as to bourgeois democracy and fascism.Mattick, Paul (1978). Anti-Bolshevik Communism. London: Merlin Press. See the PDF version. With the signing of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact in 1939, R\u00fchle began to see the parallels between the two ideological dictators, writing: > Russia was the example for fascism. [...] Whether party 'communists' like it > or not, the fact remains that the state order and rule in Russia are > indistinguishable from those in Italy and Germany. Essentially, they are > alike. One may speak of a red, black, or brown 'soviet state', as well as of > red, black or brown fascism.R\u00fchle, Otto (1939). \"The Struggle Against > Fascism Begins with the Struggle Against Bolshevism\". First appeared in the > American Councilist journal Living Marxism (4: 8). A longer text was > published in French as \"Fascisme Brun, Fascisme Rouge\" by Spartacus in 1975 > (S\u00e9rie B: 63). Because of his connection to Leon Trotsky, R\u00fchle found it difficult to find work in Mexico and was forced to hand-paint notecards for hotels to financially survive.Roth, Gary (2015). Marxism in a Lost Century: A Biography of Paul Mattick. Leiden/Boston: Brill Nijhoff and Hotel Publishing. p. 195. See the PDF version. R\u00fchle was a member of the Dewey Commission which cleared Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. In 1928, R\u00fchle wrote a very detailed Karl Marx: His Life and Works.R\u00fchle, Otto (1928); trans. 1929). Karl Marx: His Life and Works. New York: Viking Press. == Personal life == In 1921, R\u00fchle married Alice Gerstel, a German-Jewish writer, feminist and psychologist. In 1936, Gerstel followed him to Mexico in 1936 and committed suicide on the day of his death on 24 June 1943. == See also == * Exilliteratur == References == == Sources == * Otto R\u00fchle at the Marxists Internet Archive. * Kurasje.org Otto R\u00fchle at Kurasje. * \"Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils\" (2007).
