Retrieved April 3, 2019Encyclopedia del Jazz: Ralph Sutton. Retrieved April 3, 2019 The album follows the 1980 release of two LPs by Chaz Jazz entitled The Last of the Whorehouse Piano Players: Two Pianos Vol. I & Vol. II which were reissued by Chiaroscuro on CD in 1992 as Last of the Whorehouse Piano Players: The Original Sessions. ==Reception== Scott Yanow of AllMusic stated, \"Not to be confused with the CD reissue of the same name recorded in 1979, this reunion encounter by pianists Ralph Sutton and Jay McShann is up to the same level of the original dates, with plenty of heated moments ... While Sutton is the definitive stride pianist of the past half-century, McShann (who also takes a couple of vocals) finds space to infuse the music with a strong dose of blues and Kansas City swing\". A seven- minute \"Jazzspeak\" wraps up the enjoyable outing with some reminiscing about the session\". ==Track listing== # \"Honey\" (Seymour Simons, Haven Gillespie, Richard A.
