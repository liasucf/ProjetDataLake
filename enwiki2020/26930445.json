    "text": "Zahme Sau (German: tame boar) was a night fighter intercept tactic introduced by the German Luftwaffe in 1943 and conceived by Viktor von Lo\u00dfberg. At the indication of a forthcoming raid, the fighters were scrambled and collected together to orbit one of several radio beacons throughout Germany, ready to be directed en masse into the bomber stream by R/T running commentaries from the Jagd division. Once fed into the stream, fighters made radar contact with a succession of individual bombers and maintained contact (and combat) as far as their ammunition and fuel held out. == See also == *Wilde Sau (\"Wild Boar\") *List of World War II electronic warfare equipment: Tactics *Night fighter ==External links== *Luftwaffe night fighter control methods Category:Luftwaffe ",
