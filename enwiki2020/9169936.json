    "text": "Nutana Suburban Centre (sometimes abbreviated as Nutana SC) is a mixed- development neighbourhood located in south-central Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. It is a classified as a \"suburban centre\" subdivision, composed of medium to high-density multiple-unit dwellings, commercial areas and civic facilities. As of 2009, the area is home to 2,962 residents. Housing in the neighbourhood consists of high-density apartment-style dwellings and row houses. The neighbourhood is considered a lower-income area, with an average family income of $34,474, an average dwelling value of $266,311 and a home ownership rate of 29.3%. The low average income but comparatively high dwelling value is due to the number of senior citizens residing in the neighbourhood. The age distribution of Nutana SC's population is skewed very highly toward residents age 65 and older. According to MLS data, the average sale price of a home as of 2013 was $296,114. ==History== Nutana SC residences A 1913 map shows that the present-day Nutana Suburban Centre was a registered subdivision named Utopia. The land however, was not annexed until the period between 1955 and 1959. Development did not begin in earnest until the 1960s, when adjacent neighbourhoods like Brevoort Park and Eastview emerged. Home construction was most active between 1961 and 1980, but has continued at a steady pace to the present day due to a number of older buildings being replaced by new tower developments. Nutana SC was unique in that it was the first post-World War II neighbourhood to combine high-density housing with schools, businesses and civic facilities. This \"suburban centre\" concept would be repeated in later years with the development of the Lawson Heights, Confederation, Lakewood, University Heights and Blairmore suburban centres. Walter Murray Collegiate Institute, a public secondary school, opened in 1962. Holy Cross High School followed shortly after in 1963. Market Mall opened in 1966 as Saskatoon's first enclosed shopping mall. In 1966 a hospital was planned for Taylor Street east of Arlington Avenue, but it was ultimately never built. ==Government and politics== Nutana SC exists within the federal electoral district of Saskatoon\u2014Grasswood. It is currently represented by Kevin Waugh of the Conservative Party of Canada, first elected in 2015.
