Frol\u00edk scored his first goal as a Blackhawk on 2 March 2011, against the Calgary Flames. On 24 April, he scored the first Stanley Cup playoff penalty shot in Blackhawks history against goaltender Cory Schneider of the Vancouver Canucks in Game 6 of the Western Conference Quarterfinals. On 15 July 2011, Frol\u00edk signed a three-year contract extension with the Blackhawks at an annual average value at $2.333 million. During the 2012\u201313 NHL lockout, Frol\u00edk played for Pir\u00e1ti Chomutov of the Czech Extraliga. On 27 May 2013, during the 2013 playoffs, he scored the second playoff penalty shot goal of his career, against Jimmy Howard of the Detroit Red Wings, becoming the first player in NHL history to score more than one career penalty shot goal in the playoffs. He ultimately scored ten points in the playoffs en route to the Blackhawks' Stanley Cup victory over the Boston Bruins in six games. ====Winnipeg Jets==== Frolik with the Jets in 2013 In the subsequent off- season, on 30 June 2013, Frol\u00edk was traded to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for a third- and fifth-round pick at the 2013 NHL Entry Draft. In the 2013\u201314 season opener on 2 October 2013, at Rexall Place against the Edmonton Oilers, Frol\u00edk scored twice in a 5\u20134 Winnipeg win. On 29 July 2014, Frol\u00edk and the Jets agreed on a one-year, $3.3 million contract.
