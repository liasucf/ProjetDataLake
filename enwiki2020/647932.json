Serving as the administrative center of Mukachevo Raion (district), the city itself does not belong to the raion and is designated as a city of oblast significance, with the status equal to that of a separate raion. The population is . The city is now a rail terminus and highway junction, and has beer, wine, tobacco, food, textile, timber, and furniture industries. During the Cold War, it was home to Mukachevo air base and a radar station. Mukachevo is a traditional stronghold of the Rusyn language, and the population of Mukachevo is officially reported as 77.1% ethnic Ukrainian.Ukraine Census There are also significant minorities of: Russians (9.0%); Hungarians (8.5%); Germans (1.9%); and Romanians (1.4%). Up until World War II and the Holocaust, it was primarily a Jewish town, and half the population was Jewish (see below), the rest of the population being Rusyn, Hungarian, Slovak, and other minorities. Formerly in Czechoslovakia, and before that in Hungary, it was incorporated into Soviet Ukraine after World War II. ==Name== Etymologically the origin of the settlement's name from Hungarian. The name probably from the Hungarian surname \"Muncas\" - munk\u00e1s (worker) which later transformed into Munk\u00e1cs. The other names of the city derived from this. Today, there are many different ways to name Mukachevo. On 23 May 2017 the Ukrainian parliament officially renamed Mukacheve into Mukachevo, a year after the city council had decided to rename the city.Council renamed Mukacheve into Mukachevo, BBC Ukrainian (23 May 2017) Previously, it was usually spelled in Ukrainian as Mukacheve while \u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0456\u0432 (Mukachiv) was sometimes also used.Mukachiv in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine The city's name in Rusyn is \u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u043e (Mukachevo), which is also the Russian transliteration -- as well as a name adopted by the local authorities and portrayed on the city's coat of arms. Other names are ; ; Polish Mukaczewo; Slovak and Czech: Muka\u010devo; ; (Munkatsh). ==History== ===Early history=== Archaeological excavation suggest that early settlements existed here before the Middle Ages. For example, a Celtic oppidum and metal works center that existed in the 3rd-1st century BC were found between the Halish and Lovachka mountains. A Thracian fort of the Iron Age (10th century BC) was found on the mountain of Tupcha. Around the 1st century the area was occupied by the Carpi people who displaced the local Celts from the area. ===Hungarian rule=== In 895 the Hungarian tribes entered the Carpathian Basin through the Verecke Pass, about north of present-day Mukachevo. In 1397, the town and its surrounding was granted by King Sigismund of Hungary to his distant cousin, the exiled prince of Grand Duchy of Lithuania Theodor Koriatovich, who used to administrate the Ruthenian Podolia region of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, until was exiled for disobedience by Grand Duke Vytautas the Great in 1392. Theodor therefore became a vassal of Hungary and settled many Ruthenians in the territory. Other sources, however, state that Theodor bought the town and the surrounding area in 1396. During the 15th century, the city prospered and became a prominent craft and trade center for the region. In 1445, the town became a Hungarian free royal town. It was also granted the rights of Magdeburg law. During the 16th century, Mukachevo became part of the Principality of Transylvania. The 17th century (from 1604-1711) was a time of continuous struggle against the expansionist intentions of the Habsburg Empire for the Principality. In 1687 the anti-Habsburg Revolt of Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly started out from Mukachevo. The region also played an important role in R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence. St Nicholas Monastery (1772-1806) ===Austrian control and revolts=== After the defeat of Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi the city came under Austrian control in the mid-18th century as part of the Kingdom of Hungary and was made a key fortress of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1726, the Palanok Castle and the town, before 1711 owned by the R\u00e1k\u00f3czi family, was given by the Habsburgs to the Sch\u00f6nborn family, who were responsible for an expansion of the town. They also settled many Germans in the territory, thereby causing an economic boom of the region. During 1796\u20131897, the city's castle, until then a strong fortress, became a prison. The Greek national hero Alexander Ypsilanti was imprisoned at the Palanok Castle between 1821 and 1823. ===Mukachevo during and after the wars=== The Scala cinema in the centre of Mukachevo, 1942. Fortepan archive In 1919, after the American-Rusyns agreed with Tom\u00e1\u0161 Masaryk to incorporate Carpathian Ruthenia into Czechoslovakia, the whole of Carpathian Ruthenia was occupied by Czechoslovak troops. On June 4, 1920, Mukachevo officially became part of Czechoslovakia by the Treaty of Trianon. In November 1938, a part of the territory of the former Kingdom of Hungary was re-annexed by Hungary as part of the First Vienna Award. Without delay the new authorities decreed the expulsion of all the Jews without Hungarian citizenship. As a consequence Polish and Russian Jews, long-term residents of the now Hungarian-controlled Transcarpathian region, and also from Mukachevo, as well as the native Jews who could not prove their citizenship, were deported over the Ukrainian border where their fate was sealed by the hands of a German Einsatzgruppe commando led by Friedrich Jeckeln. On August 27 and 28 1941 they were all murdered by the Germans in Kamianets-Podilskyi's massacre.Kamenets-Podolski in Yad Vashem Even so, Mukachevo's population still held an important Jewish component, until in 1944 all the Jews were deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi German Eichmann Commando. They were the last Jewish community in Europe to succumb to the Holocaust. In the end of 1944, the Red Army stormed Carpathian Ruthenia. At first the territory was given to the reestablished Czechoslovakia, then became part of the Soviet Union by a treaty between the two countries, later in 1945. The Soviet Union began a policy of expulsion of the Hungarian population. In 1945, the city was ceded to the Ukrainian SSR (now Ukraine). Since 2002, Mukachevo has been the seat of the Roman Catholic diocese comprising Transcarpathia. ==Climate== Mukachevo has a humid continental climate (K\u00f6ppen: Dfb). ==Demographics== In 1921, 21,000 people lived in Mukachevo. Of these, 48 percent were Jews, 24 percent were Rusyns, and 22 percent were Hungarians. The city's population in 1966 was 50,500. Of these, 60% were Ukrainians, 18 percent Hungarians, 10% Russians and 6% Jews. According to the 2001 census, 82,200 people live in Mukachevo. Population in 1989 was 91,000, in 2004 77,300 and in 2008 93,738. Its population includes: *Ukrainians (77.1%) *Russians (9.0%) *Hungarians (8.5%) *Germans (1.9%) *Roma (1.4%) *Ashkenazi & Sephardic Jews (1.1%) Residents in seven villages of the Mukachevo Raion have the option to learn the Hungarian language in a school or home school environment.https://www.slovoidilo.ua/2017/09/26/infografika/polityka/skilky- ditej-ukrayini-navchayutsya-movamy-naczionalnyx-menshyn ==Economy== Railway Station in Mukachevo, Ukraine Fischer Sports, an Austrian company that produces Nordic Skiing, Alpine Skiing and Hockey equipment has a factory in Mukachevo.

The Jewish community of Munk\u00e1cs was an amalgam of Galician and Hungarian Hasidic Jewry, Orthodox Jews, and Zionists. The town is most noted for its Chief Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira who led the community until his death in 1937. By 1851, Munkacs supported a large yeshiva, thereby demonstrating the community's commitment to Talmudic learning and piety. Materially impoverished, yet wealthy in ideological debate, the Jews of interwar Munkacs constituted almost half of the town's population. The Munkacs Jewish community was famous for its Hasidic activity as well as its innovations in Zionism and modern Jewish education.One or more of the preceding sentences incorporates text from the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, and has been released under the GFDL: The Jewish population of Munkacs grew from 2,131 in 1825 to 5,049 in 1891 (almost 50 percent of the total population) to 7,675 in 1910 (about 44 percent). By 1921, the 10,000 Jews still made up about half the residents, though by 1930, the proportion had dropped to 43 percent, with a little over 11,000 Jews. The Jews of Munkacs constituted 11 percent of the Jewry of Subcarpathian Rus. Interwar Munkacs had a very large Jewish population, which was most visible on the Shabbat. On that day most stores were closed and, after services, the streets filled with Hasidic Jews in their traditional garb. The first movie house in the town was established by a Hasidic Jew, and it too closed on the Shabbat and Jewish holidays. The Chief Rabbi of Munkacs, Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira (who led the community from 1913 until his death in 1937) was the most outspoken voice of religious anti-Zionism. He had succeeded his father, Rabbi Zvi Hirsh Spira, who had earlier inherited the mantle of leadership from his father Rabbi Shlomo Spira. He was also a Hasidic rebbe with a significant number of followers. Rabbi Chaim Elazar Spira was succeeded by his son-in-law, Rabbi Baruch Yehoshua Yerachmiel Rabinowicz. Along with the dominant Munkacser hasidic community there co-existed smaller yet vibrant Hasidic groups who were followers of the rebbes Belz, of Spinka, Zidichov, and Vizhnitz. By the time of the Holocaust there were nearly 30 synagogues in town, many of which were Shtieblech (\"[small] house\" - small [Hasidic] synagogues). The Hebrew Gymnasium was founded in Munkacs five years after the first Hebrew speaking elementary school in Czechoslovakia was established there in 1920. It soon became the most prestigious Hebrew high school east of Warsaw. Zionist activism along with chasidic pietism contributed to a community percolating with excitement, intrigue and at times internecine conflict Latorica river In 1935, Chaim Kugel, formerly director of the Munkacs gymnasium (Jewish high school) and then Jewish Party delegate to the Czechoslovak Parliament, gave a speech during a parliamentary debate: \"\u2026It is completely impossible to adequately describe the poverty in the area. The Jews\u2026 are affected equally along with the rest\u2026. I strongly wish to protest any attempt to blame the poverty of the Subcarpathian Ruthenian peasantry on the Jews\" Quoted in Sole, \"Subcarpathian Ruthenia, 1918-1938,\" in The Jews of Czechoslovakia, vol. 1, p. 132. (Kugel later got to Mandatory Palestine and eventually became mayor of the Israeli city of Holon). Government policies were covertly directed against Jews, who bore a heavy share of taxes and had difficulty getting high civil service positions. In 1939, the Hungarians seized and annexed Subcarpathian Rus\u2014including Munkacs\u2014taking advantage of the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia. Though antisemitic legislation was introduced by the Hungarian authorities, Subcarpathian Rus, like the rest of Hungary, remained a relative haven for Jews until Nazi Germany occupied Hungary in 1944. In the spring of 1944 there were nearly 15,000 Jewish residents of the town. This ended on May 30, 1944 when the city was pronounced Judenrein (free of Jews after ghettoization and a series of deportations to Auschwitz). Today, Mukachevo is experiencing a Jewish renaissance of sorts with the establishment of a supervised kosher kitchen, a mikveh, Jewish summer camp in addition to the prayer services which take place three times daily. In July 2006, a new synagogue was dedicated on the site of a pre-war hasidic synagogue. ==Architectural landmarks== *Palanok Castle, 14th century. The castle of Munk\u00e1cs played an important role during the anti-Habsburg revolts in this territory and present-day Slovakia (1604\u20131711), especially at the beginning of the anti-Habsburg Revolt of Imre Th\u00f6k\u00f6ly (1685\u20131688), as well as at the beginning of the revolt of Ferenc II. R\u00e1k\u00f3czi (early 18th century). This important fortress became a prison from the end of the 18th century and was used until 1897. The Greek national hero Alexander Ypsilanti was imprisoned in Munk\u00e1cs castle from 1821 to 1823. *Saint Nicholas Monastery *Wooden church built in the Ukrainian architectural style, 18th century ==Notable people== *Lojza Bar\u00e1nek *Samuel Gottesman *Helena Kahan Jockel Helena Jockel (1919-), Memoir: We Sang in Hushed Voices (Azrieli Series of Holocaust Survivor Memoirs; VI), 2014. *Ihor Kharatin *Fyodor Koriatovych *Lolita Milyavskaya *Ivan Mozer *Mih\u00e1ly Munk\u00e1csy *Rio Preisner *Baruch Yehoshua Yerachmiel Rabinowicz *Moshe Leib Rabinovich *Ludv\u00edk R\u00e1\u017ea *J\u00e1n Strausz *Svyatoslav Vakarchuk *Yitzchok Yaakov Weiss *Joseph Meir Weiss *Yuri Yukechev *Naomi Blake ==Twin towns \u2013 sister cities== Mukachevo is twinned with: * Celld\u00f6m\u00f6lk, Hungary * Dabas, Hungary * Eger, Hungary * Humenn\u00e9, Slovakia * Kisv\u00e1rda, Hungary * M\u00e1t\u00e9szalka, Hungary * Ny\u00edrmeggyes, Hungary * Mielec, Poland * Pag, Croatia * Pelh\u0159imov, Czech Republic * Pre\u0161ov, Slovakia * Senta, Serbia * V\u00e1rker\u00fclet (Budapest), Hungary ==Gallery== File:\u0413\u0440\u0435\u043a\u043e- \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0423\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043d\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0440 P1370824.jpg| Dormition Cathedral File:P1380225 \u0432\u0443\u043b. \u042f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u041c\u0443\u0434\u0440\u043e\u0433\u043e, 10.jpg| A historical building on Yaroslava Mudroho Street File:\u0411\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043d\u043e\u043a \u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u0456\u0439\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0434\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0443.JPG|Mukachevo drama theater File:Munkacs Academia.jpg| Former Munkacs Academy File:\u0412\u0443\u043b.\u0406\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438 \u0417\u0440\u0456\u043d\u0456.\u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u043e.jpg| A street in the old town (Ilony Zrini Street) File:\u041f\u0430\u0440\u043a \u0456\u043c. \u0413\u043e\u0440\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e, \u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0435.JPG| Horkyi Park in Mukachevo File:Aero \u0417\u0430\u043c\u043e\u043a \u041f\u0430\u043b\u0430\u043d\u043e\u043a.jpg| Aerial view of Palanok castle File:\u00ab\u041b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u00bb. \u041f\u043e\u0433\u043b\u044f\u0434 \u0456\u0437 \u043c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0456\u0432\u0441\u044c\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043c\u043a\u0443 P1380061.jpg| Northern outskirts of Mukachevo File:Ukraine-Mukacheve-Cathedral of Nativity of Theotokos-1.jpg|A church in Mukachevo File:\u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u043e, \u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0440.jpg|Central square of Mukachevo File:\u0420\u0438\u043c\u043e- \u043a\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0446\u044c\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043c \"\u0425\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0430 \u0421\u043f\u0430\u0441\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044f\". \u041c\u0443\u043a\u0430\u0447\u0435\u0432\u043e.JPG|Roman Catholic cathedral File:\u041f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u043d\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u0432\u0430 111.jpg|Orthodox Church of Pochaiv Icon of Virgin Mary ==See also== *Zakarpattia Oblast *Eparchy of Mukachevo and Pre\u0161ov *Saint Nicholas Monastery (Mukachevo) *Byzantine Catholic Eparchy of Mukachevo *Roman Catholic Diocese of Mukachevo ==References== ==Further reading== * * *The History of Cities and Villages of the Ukrainian SSR of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine ==External links== * * * * *Mukachevo City Council - Mukachevo City Council website *mukachevo.net \u2013 Mukachevo city portal *Newspaper \"Mukachivsjka Ratusha\" Official news Mukachevo Mayor *Mukachevo News, Panorama Mukachevo - http://panorama-mukachevo.com *Mukachevo, Ukraine (Munk\u00e1cs, HU) ShtetLink on JewishGen.org *The Palanok Castle - Pictures of the Palanok castle and view on Mukachevo from Sergey Sorokin - a private mountain guide *Mukachiv in the Encyclopedia of Ukraine *United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Jewish Community of Munkacs *A Jewish Community in the Carpathian Mountains- The Story of Munk\u00e1cs - Yad Vashem *A Film of Jewish Life in Munkacs *security agency \"schit\" *Mukachevo Survey City tour *Mukacheve - ShtetLink *Mukacheve Mukachevo, historical information, archival and contemporary photos, landmarks Category:Cities in Zakarpattia Oblast Category:Shtetls Category:Cities of regional significance in Ukraine Category:Holocaust locations in Ukraine ",
