    "text": "Mary Wagner (born 1974) is a Canadian pro-life advocate who has served prison sentences for entering abortion clinics to counsel mothers against abortion without consent of the facility staff. == Biography == She protested in private abortion clinics in Toronto. Wagner was arrested for the first time in 2012. Following a nearly two-year-long trial, Judge Fergus O'Donnell found Wagner guilty of the charges, sentencing her to nine-month imprisonment and a two-year probationary limitation on being around abortion clinics. On December 23, 2014, after entering the Bloor West Village Women's Clinic abortion facility in Toronto she was arrested again and charged with disruption of business operations. In 2015, Wagner argued in court that violating her probation order by entering an abortion clinic and distributing pro-life materials to patients was a necessity in order to protect the lives of unborn children. Wagner's necessity defence was rejected by the court and upheld on appeal.https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/protester-fails-to-convince-judge- that-anti-pipeline-civil-disobedience-was-a-necessity Protester fails to convince judge that anti-pipeline civil disobedience was a \u2018necessity\u2019, National Post In April 2016, Wagner was released from prison after serving a sentence for counselling women at a clinic.https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23293691.2018.1523120 Conscientious Affirmations: A Response to Conscientious Objections to Abortion On December 12, 2016, Wagner was detained once again inside the abortion center in Bloor West Village on the day she effectively discouraged one of the women from aborting.
