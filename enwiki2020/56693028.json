    "text": "{| |} SS Corduff, a laden 2345 grt collier in East Coast convoy FS 32, was damaged, though without casualties, in an attack by Stuka divebombers in the Barrow Deep on 11 November 1940. One website wrongly attributes the attack to a Heinkel. (Sources--Convoy Reports ADM 199/39, Nore Cmd War Diaries ADM 199/375 at National Archives; Peter C Smith \"Divebomber\"' J Foreman \"The Battle of Britain--The Forgotten Months==November & December 1940). On the night of 7/8 March 1941 she was torpedoed and sunk by German E-Boat S28 while heading north with a convoy off Cromer. Seven of her crew were lost, and, after drifting for some hours and being hailed by the E-boat captain, the other 14 (including Captain Rees) were found by the Cromer lifeboat H F Bailey. It was the night of the most successful E-Boat raid on East Coast merchant shipping, with six other ships sunk. Corduff belonged to William Cory & Son Ltd. ==References== *The National Archives **E-Boat Actions ADM 199/670 **Nore Cmd WD ADM 199/407 *Lloyd's Lists *HMSO Shipping Losses list, 1947 *J P Foynes, Battle of the East Coast 1939-1945 *V Kuhn, Schnellboote in Einsatz 1939-1945 Category:1923 ships Category:Colliers Category:Maritime incidents in November 1940 Category:Maritime incidents in March 1941 Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:World War II shipwrecks in the North Sea ",
