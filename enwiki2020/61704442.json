    "text": "At Midnight (stylized in capital letters) is the third live EP by American contemporary worship band Elevation Worship. The EP was released through Elevation Worship Records on August 30, 2019. The EP was preceded by the release of \"See a Victory\" as a single on August 9, 2019. The EP was a commercial success, as it debuted at No. 2 on Billboard's Christian Albums chart. ==Background== At Midnight came into view when Hallels reported that Elevation Worship would be releasing a new single titled \"See a Victory\" on August 9, 2019. Chris Brown of Elevation Worship talked about the inspiration behind the EP, saying: ==Singles== \"See a Victory\" was released in digital format as the lead single to At Midnight on August 9, 2019. ==Critical reception== Kevin Davis of NewReleaseToday gave a favourable review of the EP, describing it as \"a moving and prayerful worship experience.\" Jesus Freak Hideout's Michael Weaver described the EP in his four-and-a-half star review as \"a really solid modern worship recording.\" In an otherwise negative review from 365 Days of Inspiring Media, Joshua Andre designated the EP a two-point- five out of five rating concluded that the release is \"a hiccup,\" noting the track length of some songs and their repetitiveness as working against the overall impact of the EP. ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+ Awards |- !
