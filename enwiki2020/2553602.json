Produced by Motown Productions, it guest-starred George Kirby and Kaye Stevens. Among the featured musical numbers were Temptations singles such as \"Get Ready\", \"Cloud Nine\", and \"Run Away Child, Running Wild\", pop standards such as \"Ol' Man River\" and \"Swanee\"., and a closing number, \"Somebody's Keepin' Score\", featuring an (early) \"rap\" by all three stars. Along with the TCB special in 1968, which featured both the Temptations and Diana Ross & The Supremes, this was one of Dennis Edwards' first appearances with the group. A soundtrack of the show was released on Motown's Gordy label as GS 933 that same year. ==Track listing== ==References== Category:1960s American television specials Category:Music television specials Category:1969 soundtrack albums Category:Television soundtracks Category:The Temptations soundtracks Category:Gordy Records soundtracks Category:1969 television specials Category:1969 in American television ",
