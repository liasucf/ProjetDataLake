    "text": "Pacific University is a private university in Forest Grove, Oregon. Founded in 1849 as the Tualatin Academy, the university's original Forest Grove campus is west of Portland. The university maintains three other campuses in the cities of Eugene, Hillsboro, and Woodburn, and has an enrollment of more than 4,000 students. ==History== Marsh Hall Tabitha Moffatt Brown, a pioneer emigrant from Massachusetts, immigrated to the Oregon Country over the new Applegate Trail in 1846. After arriving in Oregon she helped to start an orphanage and school along with Rev. Harvey L. Clark in Forest Grove in 1847 to care for the orphans of Applegate Trail party.Horner, John B. Oregon: Her History, Her Great Men, Her Literature. Corvallis, OR: Gazette-Times, 1919; pp. 159-160.Carey, Charles Henry. (1922). History of Oregon. Pioneer Historical Publishing Co. p. 340, 350, 507, 724. In March 1848, Tualatin Academy was established from the orphanage with Clark donating to the school. George H. Atkinson had advocated the founding of the school and with support of the Presbyterians and Congregationalists helped to start the academy. Eliza Hart Spalding, part of the Whitman Mission, was its first teacher. Although the university has long been independent of their founding affiliation with the United Church of Christ (UCC), it still maintains a close working relationship with the church as a member of the United Church of Christ Council for Higher Education. The academy was officially chartered by the territorial legislature on September 29, 1849. The reverend Clark served as the first president of the board of trustees and later donated an additional to the institution. In 1851, what is now Old College Hall was built and in 1853 Sidney H. Marsh became the school's first president. The current campus was deeded in 1851.Deed, April 3, 1851, Washington Country, Oregon In 1854, the institution became Pacific University. The first commencement occurred in 1863 with Harvey W. Scott as the only graduate. In 1872, three Japanese students started at the university as part of that country's modernization movement, with all three graduating in 1876. These students were Hatstara Tamura, Kin Saito, and Yei Nosea. President Marsh died in 1879 and was replaced by John R. Herrick. Marsh Hall was built in 1895 and named for Pacific's first president, serving as the central building on Pacific's campus. Carnegie Library (now Carnegie Hall) opened in 1912 after Andrew Carnegie's foundation helped finance the brick structure. The library was designed by Portland architecture firm Whidden and Lewis. In 1915, the preparatory department, Tualatin Academy, closed due to the proliferation of public high schools in the state. By 1920, the school had grown to a total of five buildings on and had an endowment of approximately $250,000. Marsh Hall was gutted by fire in 1975, but its shell was preserved, and the structure reopened in 1977. Dr. Phillip D.

Walker, who was a missionary to China, and by his mother. Qilin (pronounced chee-lin or ki-rin) is a mythical Chinese creature with a lion-like stance, a unicorn-like horn, and deer or ox hooves from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). During this period, qilin were often represented with a dragon head, fish scales, ox hooves and a lion's tail. Said to be a good omen of wisdom and prosperity, the Pacific qilin was nicknamed Boxer by its Chinese and Japanese students as an embodiment of the community's cultural diversity. In the first half of the twentieth century, the original mascot was the center of informal \"Boxer Toss\" events, where different clubs and groups would scrimmage for the statue as a tradition of passing its care from one group to another. In 1968, Boxer became the official mascot of the university to replace Benny Badger. The following year, the statue disappeared entirely, and only small pieces of have returned over the years. In the 1980s, the statue was recast as Boxer II; after supposedly enjoying an epic road trip across America, it too disappeared in the mid-2000s. In 2006, the university commissioned a 12-foot tall sculpture to replace the missing Boxers, which now stands in a central park welcoming students to the residence halls. Shortly thereafter, parts of the original Boxer statue were returned to the university by an alumnus in 2012. In 2018, alumni funded the design and casting of Boxer III by artist Pat Costello, unveiled during Homecoming weekend. Kept in trust as part of the university's art collection, the statue and exhibits on its cultural and community history are on display in the Tran Library. ==Academics== Performing Arts Center Pacific is home to 5 colleges offering undergraduate, graduate, and professional programs. ===College of Arts & Sciences=== Organized into 3 schools\u2014Arts & Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences\u2014the college offers over sixty undergraduate degree options, including unique options in Asia-Pacific Studies, Communication Sciences & Disorders, Creative Writing, Editing and Publishing, Music Therapy, Outdoor Leadership, Nonprofit Leadership, Social Work, and a suite of sustainability-centered art and science programs.
