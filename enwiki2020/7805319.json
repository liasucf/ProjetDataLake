In August 2014, Gorman co-curated an exhibition about Malcolm McLaren's engagement in fashion with Young Kim of the Malcolm McLaren Estate. Staged as part of the Copenhagen International Fashion Fair, it was entitled Let It Rock: The Look Of Music The Sound Of Fashion. The exhibition was based around six sections dedicated to the retail outlets McLaren operated with Vivienne Westwood in the 1970s and 80s. The exhibition received a positive response from the media. Financial Times fashion editor Charlie Porter noted \"the hang of the garments is exceptional\" while prominent style blogger Susie Bubble greeted the exhibition as \"an incredibly detailed and well-put together overview specifically about McLaren's fusion of music and fashion\". In autumn 2014 Gorman was one of the curators of Art In Pop, an exhibition about the engagement between the worlds of art and popular music at the Centre National d'Art Contemporain gallery Magasin in Grenoble, France. Overseen by Magasin curator Yves Aupetitallot, Art In Pop included a large space curated by Gorman and Young Kim dedicated to McLaren's work and including clothing exhibits, a soundtrack and photographs of his student paintings executed in the late 60s. Marie France described it as \"an invigorating exhibition not just to see but hear as well\". In summer 2018 Gorman curated an exhibition about the resurgence of independent magazines in the digital age in the Terrace Rooms Gallery at Somerset House. Print! Tearing It Up was co-curated with Somerset House senior curator Claire Catterall and ran from 8 June \u2013 22 August 2018. ==Plagiarism case against Vivienne Westwood, Ian Kelly and Picador== In October 2014, following the publication of the authorised biography Vivienne Westwood by the fashion designer and her co-author Ian Kelly, Gorman accused the authors and the publisher Picador of plagiarising substantial sections of material from his book The Look: Adventures In Rock & Pop Fashion. Gorman also described the Westwood biography as \"sloppy\" and \"riddled with inaccuracies\" and claimed it contained serious libels against two individuals, one of whom was pronounced to be dead by Westwood when in fact the individual was alive and practising as a therapist in west London. Picador publisher Paul Baggaley told The Bookseller: \"We always take very seriously any errors that are brought to our attention and, where appropriate, correct them.\" ==Books== * The Look: Adventures In Pop & Rock Fashion (Sanctuary, 2001).
