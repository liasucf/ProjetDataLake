Oxford University Press 1973, reprinted U.S.A.1978 Chapter 8 : pps. 125-150 : The Role of Hallucinogenic Plants in European Witchcraft. An early proponent of the last explanation was Renaissance scholar and scientist Giambattista della Porta, who not only interviewed users of the flying ointment, but witnessed its effects upon such users at first hand, comparing the deathlike trances he observed in his subjects with their subsequent accounts of the bacchanalian revelry they had 'enjoyed'. ==Body in coma and riding on beasts== Dominican churchman Bartolommeo Spina (1465? / 1475? -1546) of Pisa gives two accounts of the power of the flying ointment in his Tractatus de strigibus sive maleficis ('Treatise on witches or evildoers') of 1525. The first concerns an incident in the life of his acquaintance Augustus de Turre of Bergamo, a physician. While studying medicine in Pavia as a young man, Augustus returned late one night to his lodgings (without a key) to find no one awake to let him in. Climbing up to a balcony, he was able to enter through a window, and at once sought out the maidservant, who should have been awake to admit him. On checking her room, however, he found her lying unconscious - beyond rousing - on the floor. The following morning he tried to question her on the matter, but she would only reply that she had been 'on a journey'. Bartolommeo's second account is more suggestive and points toward another element in the witches' 'flights'. It concerns a certain notary of Lugano who, unable to find his wife one morning, searched for her all over their estate and finally discovered her lying deeply unconscious, naked and filthy with her vagina exposed, in a corner of the pigsty. The notary 'immediately understood that she was a witch' (!) and at first wanted to kill her on the spot, but, thinking better of such rashness, waited until she recovered from her stupor, in order to question her. Terrified by his wrath, the poor woman fell to her knees and confessed that during the night she had 'been on a journey'. Light is cast on the tale of the notary's wife by two accounts widely separated in time but revealing a persistent theme in European Witchcraft. The first is that of Regino of Pr\u00fcm whose De synodalibus causis et disciplinis ecclesiasticis libri duo (circa 906 C.E.) speaks of women who 'seduced...by demons...insist that they ride at night on certain beasts [italics not original] together with Diana, goddess of the pagans, and a great multitude of women; that they cover great distances in the silence of the deepest night...'Quoted in : Ginzburg, Carlo, Ecstasies. Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath, New York, 1991, . First published in Italian as Storia notturna: Una decifrazione del Sabba, 1989. (See also Canon Episcopi). The second account dates from some 800 years later, coming from Norway in the early 18th century and is the testimony, at the age of thirteen, of one Siri J\u00f8rgensdatter. Siri claimed that when she was seven her grandmother had taken her to the witches' sabbath on the mountain meadow Blockula ('blue-hill') : her grandmother led her to a pigsty, where she smeared a sow with some ointment which she took from a horn, whereupon grandmother and granddaughter mounted the animal and, after a short ride through the air, arrived at a building on the Sabbath mountain.Quoted in Pickering, David : A Dictionary of Witchcraft pub. David Pickering 2014. == Alleged sexual element in application == Some sources have claimed that such an ointment would best be absorbed through mucous membranes, and that the traditional image of a female witch astride a broomstick implies the application of flying ointment to the vulva.Emboden, William Narcotic Plants : Hallucinogens, stimulants, inebriants, and hypnotics, their origins and uses 2nd edition (revised and enlarged) pub. Macmillan, New York 1979 p.127 The passage from the trial for witchcraft in Ireland of Hiberno-Norman noblewoman Alice Kyteler in 1324 quoted above is, while not explicit, certainly open to interpretations both drug-related and sexual. It is also a very early account of such practices, pre-dating by some centuries witch trials in the early modern period. The testimony of Dame Kyteler's maidservant, Petronilla de Meath, while somewhat compromised by having been extracted under torture, contains references not only to her mistress's abilities in the preparation of 'magical' medicines, but also her sexual behaviour, including at least one instance of (alleged) intercourse with a demon.Williams, Bernadette, 'The Sorcery Trial of Alice Kyteler,' History Ireland Vol. 2, No.4 (Winter, 1994)Davidson, Sharon, and John O. Ward, trans. The Sorcery Trial of Alice Kyteler: A Contemporary Account (1324). Asheville, NC: Pegasus Press, 2004. According to the inquisition ('in which were five knights and numerous nobles') set in motion by Richard de Ledrede, Bishop of Ossory, there was in the city of Kilkenny a band of heretical sorcerers, at the head of whom was Dame Alice Kyteler and against whom no fewer than seven charges relating to witchcraft were laid. The fifth charge is of particular interest in the context of the 'greased staffe' mentioned above : Deducting from the above ingredients of purely symbolic significance relating to death and heresy, one is left with the cooking, in a fatty mixture, of 'unspecified herbs' and 'horrible worms' to produce, among other preparations, 'unguents' and 'ointments' - one of which was the 'staffe-greasing' ointment later found in the 'pipe' discovered in Dame Alice's closet. It is unfortunate that the identities of the herbs and 'worms' involved went unrecorded. Those of the 'unspecified herbs' may well be guessed at in the light of information regarding later flying ointment recipes, but the 'horrible worms' remain more cryptic : it is unclear whether actual worms or insect larvae are intended. If the latter, such larvae might themselves have been poisonous and intoxicating, from having fed on alkaloidal plants. Comparison of Alice Kyteler's 'staffe' and Siri J\u00f8rgensdatter's sow - both greased with a mysterious ointment, suggest the innate conservatism of European Witchcraft and the persistence of a body of women's knowledge related to sexuality and the use of a potent and complex drug. ==Possible opiate component== Opium Poppy : Papaver somniferum One possible key to how individuals dealt with the toxicity of the nightshades usually said to be part of flying ointments is through the supposed antidotal reaction some of the solanaceous alkaloids have with the alkaloids of Papaver somniferum (opium poppy). This is discussed by Alexander Kuklin in his brief book, How Do Witches Fly? (DNA Press, 1999). This antagonism was claimed to exist by the movement of Eclectic medicine. For instance, King's American Dispensatory states in the entry on belladonna: \"Belladonna and opium appear to exert antagonistic influences, especially as regards their action on the brain, the spinal cord, and heart; they have consequently been recommended and employed as antidotes to each other in cases of poisoning\" going on to make the extravagant claim that \"this matter is now positively and satisfactorily settled; hence in all cases of poisoning by belladonna the great remedy is morphine, and its use may be guided by the degree of pupillary contraction it occasions.\" The use of opiates in the treatment of belladonna poisoning is, however, strongly contraindicated in modern medical practice [see below]. The synergy between belladonna and poppy alkaloids was made use of in the so- called \"twilight sleep\" that was provided for women during childbirth beginning in the Edwardian era. Twilight sleep was a mixture of scopolamine, a belladonna alkaloid, and morphine, a Papaver alkaloid, that was injected and which furnished a combination of painkilling and amnesia for a woman in labor. A version is still manufactured for use as the injectable compound Omnopon. There is no definite indication of the proportions of solanaceous herbs vs. poppy used in flying ointments, and most historical recipes for flying ointment do not include poppy. Furthermore, a reputable publication by the former UK Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Fisheries (now DEFRA) states specifically that, in cases of poisoning by Atropa belladonna - far from being antidotes - 'Preparations containing morphine or opiates should be avoided as they have a synergic action with atropine'; an appropriate antidote being, by contrast, the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine salicylate.Cooper, Marion R. and Johnson, Anthony W.

HMSO London, 1984 page 213 == Sources citing ointments == The use by witches of flying ointments was first described, according to known sources, by Johannes Hartlieb in 1456. It was also described by the Spanish theologian Alfonso Tostado (d. 1455) in Super Genesis Commentaria (printed in Venice, 1507), whose commentary tended to accredit the thesis of the reality of the Witches' Sabbath. In 1477 Antone Rose confessed that the devil gave her a stick 18 inches in length on which she would rub an ointment and with the words \"go, in the name of the Devil, go\" would fly to the \"synagogue\" (an alternative name for Sabbath in early witchcraft).Encyclopedia of witchcraft and demonology, Page 50, octopus, 1974 ==In popular culture== ===Drama=== There is, in the work of the playwright Francisco de Rojas Zorilla (1607-1648) of Toledo, an exchange concerning the flying ointment, the (following) passage occurring in the play Lo que quer\u00eda el Marqu\u00e9s de Villena ('What the Marquis of Villena wanted').Quoted in : Baroja, Julio Caro The World of the Witches pub. Phoenix 2001 (Original Title Las brujas y su mundo) ) ===Literature and film=== *In Nathaniel Hawthorne's \"Young Goodman Brown\", Goody Cloyse, after meeting the Devil, says \"I was all anointed with the juice of smallage, and cinquefoil, and wolf's bane\" to which the Devil replies \"[m]ingled with fine wheat and the fat of a new-born babe\". *In Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita, Margarita, after agreeing to act as hostess at Dr Woland's ball, uses the ointment to become a witch and fly to the estate where the event is being held. *In Clayton Rawson's Death from a Top Hat, two recipes by Johann Weyer, a 16th-century demonologist, are given in a footnote: :1-Water hemlock, sweet flag, cinquefoil, bat's blood, deadly nightshade and oil. :2-Baby's fat, juice of cowbane, aconite, cinquefoil, deadly nightshade and soot. * In the movie serial Warlock, the villain kills an unbaptised boy to get this \"Flying Ointment\". *In Jodi Picoult's Salem Falls, a group of four girls practicing witchcraft ingest a flying ointment made of belladonna. * In the book Calling on Dragons (Book three of the Enchanted Forest Chronicles), the witch Morwen uses a flying potion on a straw basket and a broomstick, not on herself. * In E. L. Konigsburg's Jennifer, Hecate, Macbeth, William McKinley, and Me, Elizabeth, two characters try to make a flying ointment. * In the 2015 horror film The Witch, a witch kills an infant child and makes flying ointment out of his corpse. *In the 2016 movie, The Love Witch, the main character applies a flying ointment to her body. * In the 2019 movie, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, the two main characters apply a flying ointment to their armpits. * In the 2020 movie, Gretel and Hansel, directed by Oz Perkins, the witch, caressing a precious jar filled with ointment, applies it to herself, and then initiates Gretel into witchcraft by inducing her to do the same. ===Music=== * The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band song '11 Moustachioed Daughters' - a track on the Album The Doughnut in Granny's Greenhouse - is a darkly comic and surprisingly detailed evocation of the traditional Witches' Sabbath, featuring the flying-ointment- related lines : * The Swedish symphonic metal band Therion has a song called Unguentum Sabbati (Ointment of the Sabbat) on the album Sitra Ahra. ==Gallery== File:Illustration Aconitum napellus0.jpg|Wolfsbane or Aconite, Aconitum napellus (virulent poison) File:Illustration Conium maculatum0.jpg|Hemlock, Conium maculatum (virulent poison) File:Illustration Cicuta virosa0.jpg|Cowbane or Water Hemlock, Cicuta virosa (virulent poison) File:Herbier de la France (10038460935).jpg|Hemlock Water Dropwort or Water Hemlock, Oenanthe crocata (virulent poison) File:Sium latifolium Sturm13.jpg|Greater Water Parsnip or Sium, Sium latifolium (root poisonous) File:Illustration Berula erecta0.jpg|Lesser Water Parsnip or Sium, Berula erecta File:Illustration Aethusa cynapium0.jpg|Fool's Parsley Aethusa cynapium (poison) File:Illustration Apium graveolens0.jpg|Wild Celery Apium graveolens (wild form of well-known vegetable) File:Illustration Potentilla reptans0.jpg|Creeping Cinquefoil, Potentilla reptans File:Acorus calamus - K\u00f6hler\u2013s Medizinal-Pflanzen-006.jpg|Sweet Flag or Strewing Rush, Acorus calamus (aromatic) File:Soot, roet.jpg|Domestic chimney soot File:Adeps Humanus IMG 1893 edit.jpg|Human fat File:Pipistrellus flight2.jpg|Common pipistrelle in flight (bat's blood) File:Henbane flower.jpg|Henbane flower File:Jimsonweed flower.jpg|Jimsonweed flower File:Jimsonweed seed capsule.jpg|Jimsonweed seed capsule File:Opium poppy flower - Isle of Man.jpg|Opium poppy flower File:Opium poppy seed capsule.jpg|Opium poppy seed capsules ==See also== * Besom * Cunning folk * Deliriants * Hedgewitch * Nightshades == References == == External links == * Flying Potions and Getting to the Sabbat * Belladonna in flying ointments * Ritual of the Raven * If Witches No Longer Fly: Today's Pagans and the Solanaceous Plants * King's American Dispensatory on Belladonna * FLYING OINTMENTS: Their Ingredients and Their Use * Witches' Ointment: Information from the Gale Encyclopedia of Occultism & Parapsychology Category:Witchcraft Category:Hallucinations Category:Poisons ",
