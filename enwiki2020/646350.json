    "text": "Charles \"Don\" Aliassurname pronounced ah-LIE-ahs (December 25, 1939 in New York City \u2013 March 28, 2006 in New York City)Don Alias, 66, Percussionist And Sideman was an American jazz percussionist. Alias was best known for playing congas and other hand drums. He was, however, a capable drum kit performer: for example, Alias played drums on the song \"Miles Runs the Voodoo Down\" from trumpeter Miles Davis's album Bitches Brew (1969) when neither Lenny White nor Jack DeJohnette was able to play the marching band-inspired rhythm requested by Davis.see the notes for The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions (1998) Alias performed on hundreds of recordings and was perhaps best known for his associations with Miles Davis and saxophonist David Sanborn, though he also performed or recorded with the group Weather Report, singer Joni Mitchell, pianist Herbie Hancock, the Brecker Brothers, Jaco Pastorius, Pat Metheny, Nina Simone and many others. Alias was born in New York City and arrived in Boston in the early 1960s intending to study medicine but, after playing congas in a number of local bands, made an abrupt career switch. ==Discography== ===As sideman=== With Philip Bailey * Soul on Jazz (Heads Up International, 2002) With Carla Bley * Sextet (Watt, 1986\u201387) * Fleur Carnivore (Watt, 1988) * The Very Big Carla Bley Band (Watt, 1990) * Looking for America (Watt, 2002) With Marlena Shaw * Love is in Flight (Verve, 1988) With Marc Cohn * Marc Cohn (Atlantic, 1991) With Uri Caine * Toys (JMT, 1996) With Lou Reed * Ecstasy (Reprise, 2000) With Miles Davis * Bitches Brew (Columbia, 1970) * On the Corner (Columbia, 1972) * Amandla (Warner Bros., 1989) * Miles Davis at Newport 1955-1975: The Bootleg Series Vol. 4 (Columbia Legacy, 2015) With Bob Mintzer * One Music (DMP, 1991) With Roberta Flack * Oasis (Atlantic, 1988) With Jack DeJohnette * Oneness (ECM, 1997) With Michael Franks * Abandoned Garden (Warner Bros, 1995) With Joe Farrell * Penny Arcade (CTI, 1973) With Dan Fogelberg * The Innocent Age (Full Moon, 1981) With Bill Frisell * Unspeakable (Elektra Nonesuch, 2004) With Hal Galper * The Guerilla Band (Mainstream, 1971) With Kenny Garrett * Black Hope (Warner Bros, 1992) With Herbie Hancock * The New Standard (Veve, 1996) With Elvin Jones * Merry- Go-Round (Blue Note, 1971) With Dave Liebman * Sweet Hands (Horizon, 1975) With Joe Lovano * Tenor Legacy (Blue Note, 1993) With Joni Mitchell * Don Juan's Reckless Daughter (Asylum, 1977) * Mingus (Asylum, 1979) With Jaco Pastorius * Jaco Pastorius (Epic, 1976) * Word of Mouth (Warner Bros., 1980\u201381) With Carlos Santana and John McLaughlin * Love Devotion Surrender (Columbia, 1973) With Lalo Schifrin * Black Widow (CTI, 1976) With Nina Simone * To Love Somebody (RCA, 1969) With Jeremy Steig * Legwork (Solid State, 1970) * Wayfaring Stranger (Blue Note, 1971) * Energy (Capitol, 1971) * Fusion (Groove Merchant, 1972) With Ira Sullivan * Ira Sullivan (Horizon, 1976) With Steve Swallow * Carla (Xtra Watt, 1987) * Swallow (Xtra Watt, 1991) With James Taylor * New Moon Shine (Columbia, 1991) With Weather Report * Weather Report (Columbia, 1971) \u2013 uncredited * Black Market (Columbia, 1976) With Lou Reed * Ecstasy (Sire, 2000) With Pat Metheny Group * Imaginary Day (Warner, 1997) With Don Grolnick Group * The Complete London Concert (Fuzzy Music, 2000) * Medianoche (1995) With Eliane Elias * So Far So Close (1989) ==References== == External links == *Official Website Don Alias *Don Alias's Interview *Article in Drummerworld Category:1939 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Musicians from New York City Category:American jazz percussionists Category:American jazz drummers Category:Miles Davis Category:African-American drummers Category:Weather Report members Category:Conga players Category:Bongo players Category:Djembe players Category:Tambourine players Category:Triangle players Category:Bat\u00e1 drummers Category:Marimbists Category:Timbaleros Category:Timpanists Category:American session musicians Category:Snare drummers Category:20th-century American drummers Category:American male drummers Category:The Tony Williams Lifetime members Category:Blood, Sweat & Tears members Category:Jazz musicians from New York (state) Category:American male jazz musicians ",
