    "text": "This is a list of former high school athletic conferences in the Northeast Region of Ohio, as designated by the OHSAA. If a conference had members that span multiple regions, the conference is placed in the article of the region most of its former members hail from. Because the names of localities and their corresponding high schools do not always match and because there is often a possibility of ambiguity with respect to either the name of a locality or the name of a high school, the following table gives both in every case, with the locality name first, in plain type, and the high school name second in boldface type. The school's team nickname is given last. ==All-American Athletic Conference== This short-lived conference began when Hubbard left the Mahoning Valley Conference to join with four defectors from the Steel Valley Conference (leaving the SVC in a weakened state, with only four schools remaining). When Western Reserve closed in 1990, Hubbard and Warren Harding rejoined their former conferences, while Howland and Niles McKinley followed Hubbard into the MVC. * Warren Harding Panthers (1986\u201390, to Steel Valley) * Howland Tigers (1986\u201390, to Mahoning Valley) * Hubbard Eagles (1986\u201390, to Mahoning Valley) * Niles McKinley Dragons (1986\u201390, to Mahoning Valley) * Warren Western Reserve Raiders (1986\u201390, consolidated into Warren Harding) ==All-American Conference (Football)== This football-only conference featured six schools in northeastern Ohio, with some of the strongest gridiron teams in the state. Some of the schools also competed in the Ohio Big 8 League for other sports. The league lasted 16 seasons, and broke up primarily because of the dominance of Massillon Washington. * Warren Harding Panthers (1963\u201379) * Canton McKinley Bulldogs (1963\u201379) * Niles McKinley Red Dragons (1963\u201379) * Massillon Washington Tigers (1963\u201379) * Steubenville Big Red (1966\u201379) * Alliance Aviators (1969\u201379) ==All-Ohio Conference/League== The league began as the AOC in 1976, as the Chippewa Conference split into this league and the Pioneer League. After Coventry replaced Tuscarawas Valley in 1983, the name was changed to the AOL. * Navarre Fairless Falcons (1976\u201389, to PAC-7) * Canal Fulton Northwest Indians (1977\u201389, to Northeastern Buckeye) * Orrville Red Riders (1976\u20131989, to Ohio Heartland Conference 1999-2003) * Wooster Triway Titans (1976\u20131989, to Mohican Area) * Millersburg West Holmes Knights (1976\u20131989, to Mohican Area) * Zoarville Tuscarawas Valley Trojans (1977-1983) * Manchester Panthers (1976\u201389, to PAC-7) * Coventry Comets (1983\u201389, to PAC-7) ==Ashland County League== see Ashland County HS Sports Teams, Ohio * Albion Britons (colors: Navy & wine) (1929\u201338, consolidated into Homerville) * Hayesville Panthers (colors: orange & black) (1929\u201363, consolidated into Hillsdale) * Jeromesville Blue Jays (colors: blue & white) (1929\u201363, consolidated into Hillsdale) * Loudonville Redbirds (colors: scarlet & gray) (1929\u201362, moved to Johnny Appleseed Conference) * Nankin Knights (1929\u201337, consolidated into Polk) * Nova Trojans (colors: orange) (1929\u201349, consolidated into Ruggles-Troy) * Perrysville Admirals (colors: red & white) (1929\u201361, consolidated into Loudonville) * Polk Presidents (colors: orange & black) (1929\u201363, consolidated into Mapleton) * Ruggles Redskins (colors: crimson & royal blue) (1929\u201349, consolidated into Ruggles-Troy) * Savannah Sailors (colors: green & white) (1929\u201362, consolidated into Crestview) * Sullivan Bobcats (colors: red & white) (1929\u201358, consolidated into Black River) * Ruggles-Troy Golden Flashes (colors: green & gold) (1949\u201363, consolidated into Mapleton) * Sullivan Black River Pirates (1958\u201363, moved to Firelands) ==Chippewa Conference== * Brunswick Blue Devils (1963\u201377, to Pioneer) * Lodi Cloverleaf Colts (1963\u201377, to Pioneer) * Orrville Red Riders (1963\u20131976, to All-Ohio) * Wadsworth Grizzlies (1963\u201377, to Pioneer) * Millersburg West Holmes Knights (1968-1976, to All-Ohio) * Wooster Triway Titans (1970\u20131976, to All-Ohio) The larger schools with proximity to I-76, I-71 and I-271 (Brunswick, Cloverleaf and Wadsworth) merged with Brecksville, North Royalton and Strongsville as charter members of the Pioneer Conference. Those three Cuyahoga County Conference schools also experienced greater enrollment increases than the smaller schools in their conference. They also had proximity to I-71, as well as the newly constructed I-271. Although Highland is often mentioned in association with the league, it was never in the conference. They played in the Inland Conference (1958-1976) before joining the Suburban League in 1977. Many Chippewa Conference schools included Highland in their non-conference schedules among several sports. ==Crown Conference== (1967-1980) * Bedford St. Peter Chanel Firebirds (Closed) * Cleveland Cathedral Latin Lions (Now Notre Dame - Cathedral Latin) * Cleveland St. Joseph Vikings (Now Villa Angela-St. Joseph) * Lakewood St. Edward Eagles * Mentor Lake Catholic Cougars * Parma Padua Franciscan Bruins * Parma Heights Holy Name Green Wave ==Cuyahoga County Conference/League== The initial CCL split into the Eastern Cuyahoga County League and West Side Cuyahoga County League (later the East and West County Leagues) in 1929. Various defections from within the county led to a short reformation of the league in 1954. The East and West leagues were revived two years later. Further defections to other leagues led to neither league being stable, and they revived the county league (now under the CCC banner) in 1964.

Warrensville Heights was also growing in enrollment and joined another Cleveland area league with schools closer in size. Smaller schools like Brooklyn, Cuyahoga Heights, Independence and Lutheran West later joined the Inland Conference. The three public schools were limited in potential enrollment increase because their city limits were no longer expandable. They were also near I-480, making travel among their new Inland Conference opponents easier, and their competition consisted of schools similar in enrollment. Richmond Heights had the same city limit growth issues and left for the East Suburban Conference early on. ==East Suburban Conference== * Beachwood Bison (1968\u201389, to MAC-8) * Burton Berkshire Badgers (1968\u201396, to Chagrin Valley Conference (CVC)) * Middlefield Cardinal Huskies (1968\u201396, to CVC) * Kirtland Hornets (1968\u201396, to CVC) * Newbury Black Knights (1968\u201398, to CVC) * Richmond Heights Spartans (1968\u201389, to MAC-8) * Fairport Harbor Harding Skippers (1970\u201376 (to Grand River), 1989-2005 (to CVC)) * Chardon Hilltoppers (1980\u201383, to CVC) * Aurora Greenmen (1983\u201389, to MAC-8) * Perry Pirates (1984\u201396, to CVC) * Thompson Ledgemont Redskins (1989-2009, to Northeastern Athletic (NAC)) * Orwell Grand Valley Mustangs (1989\u201398, to CVC) * Vienna Mathews Mustangs (1989\u201391 (to Inter-County), football only 2004\u201309 (to NAC)) * Andover Pymatuning Valley Lakers (1989\u201398 (to Northeastern), football only 2004-2009 (to NAC)) * Bristolville Bristol Panthers (1992-2002 (No Football), to NAC) * North Bloomfield Bloomfield Cardinals (1996-2002 (No Football), to NAC) * Southington Chalker Wildcats (1996-2002 (Football 1997-2009), to NAC) * Lordstown Red Devils (1996-2002 (No Football), to NAC) * Cortland Maplewood Rockets (1996-2002 (No Football), to NAC) * Ashtabula Sts.

Brookside left in 1970 and was replaced by Lutheran West. Highland left in 1976 and was eventually replaced by Independence. Brooklyn and Cuyahoga Heights joined in 1979/1980 and the league was divided into an East Division (Brooklyn, Buckeye, Cuyahoga Heights, Independence, Lutheran West) and a West Division (Avon, Columbia, Firelands, Keystone, South Amherst). Season ending conference championship games in most sports were played between the winners of each division, to crown the overall conference champion. Avon, Firelands and Keystone left at the end of the 1985-86 school year and began play in the newly formed Lorain County Conference in the Fall of 1986. The remaining Inland Conference schools returned to the one division format, until the league dissolved at the end of the 1988-89 school year, which is when South Amherst was absorbed by Firelands. All remaining members, except Buckeye, joined the newly formed Metropolitan Athletic Conference in the Fall of 1989. * Avon Eagles (1957\u20131986) -- Left after Spring 1986 to join the Lorain County Conference * Sheffield Brookside Cardinals (1957\u20131970) -- Left after Spring of 1970 to join the Lakeland Conference * Medina Buckeye Bucks (1957\u20131989) -- Became an independent when the Inland Conference dissolved * Columbia Station Columbia Raiders (1957\u20131989) -- Joined the Metropolitan Athletic Conference in Fall of 1989 * Oberlin Firelands Falcons (1957\u20131986) -- Left after Spring 1986 to join the Lorain County Conference * Medina Highland Hornets (1957\u20131976) -- Left after Spring of 1976 to join the Suburban League * LaGrange Keystone Wildcats (1957\u20131986) -- Left after Spring 1986 to join the Lorain County Conference * South Amherst Cavaliers (1957\u20131988) -- Merged with Firelands in 1988 * Rocky River Lutheran West Longhorns (1970\u20131989) -- Joined the Metropolitan Athletic Conference in Fall of 1989 * Cuyahoga Heights Redskins (1979-1989) -- Joined the Metropolitan Athletic Conference in Fall of 1989 * Brooklyn Hurricanes (1979\u20131989) -- Joined the Metropolitan Athletic Conference in Fall of 1989 * Independence Blue Devils (1979\u20131989) -- Joined the Metropolitan Athletic Conference in Fall of 1989 Source: ==Inter-County League== This is one of the far East Ohio leagues that merged to for the Inter-Tri-County League, along with the Tri-County League, in 2006.

Toledo Waite representatives also mentioned that having to play conference newcomer Toledo Macomber in the Toledo City League would have made it impossible for them to continue playing in both leagues. An interest in joining the league was expressed by Hamilton, Middletown, Springfield, and Toledo Libbey in 1949, but those schools ultimately decided the travel was too much for them to consider as well. ==Pioneer Conference== (1977\u20132007) * Brecksville-Broadview Heights Bees (1977-2005) * Brunswick Blue Devils (1977-2007) * Lodi Cloverleaf Colts (1977-1997) * North Royalton Bears (1977-2007) * Strongsville Mustangs (1977-2007) * Wadsworth Grizzlies (1977-1984) * Berea Braves (1979-2005) * Middleburg Heights Midpark Meteors (1979-2005) * Medina Battling Bees (1986-2007) * North Ridgeville Rangers (1997-2005) * Elyria Pioneers (2003-2007) * Parma Normandy Invaders (2003-2007) * Parma Redmen (2003-2007) * Parma Heights Valley Forge Patriots (2003-2007) {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccf;\" ! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Pioneer Conference Divisions, 2003\u201305 |- !

The first was the mid/late 1970s where schools located south of the first ring suburbs near or through the I-71 corridor were realizing unprecedented growth. The conference's six charter members had outgrown their respective leagues. Berea and Midpark, both in the heart of the I-71 corridor, followed suit in 1979. During the 1980s Wadsworth, a member with strong athletic programs despite smaller enrollment, left for the Suburban League where opponents along the US-224 and I-76/I-94 corridors made better natural border rivalries. Cloverleaf followed suit in the late 1990s due to stagnation in its enrollment and its inability to maintain its programs at competitive levels in the PC. Conversely, Medina, also along the corridor, joined the PC in 1986 because of its unprecedented growth and the greater natural border rivalries among the league's charter members. The final shift was the early 2000s where first-ring south/west Cleveland suburbs found the charter PC members were now larger, more suitable opponents and closer in proximity; saving some travel among Lake Erie League opponents of years past. Lorain County schools, Elyria and North Ridgeville, were looking for closer, competitive opponents as an alternative to the continued shrinking of Lorain City and Sandusky schools. Their proximity to I-80 and I-480 made the jump to the PC more viable. This conference was a powerhouse in all sports and it was also the foundation of the Cleveland area's first suburban mega-conference, the NEO Conference, whose format was patterned after similar mega-conferences formed in Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati suburbs. ==Portage County League== One of the longest-surviving county leagues, lasting from 1918 until merging into the Portage Trail Conference in 2005. * Atwater Spartans (192?-67, consolidated into Waterloo) * Aurora Greenmen (192?-64, joined Chagrin Valley Conference) * Brimfield Bears (1918\u201330, converted to junior high in 1930, consolidated into Field, 1960) * Charlestown Wildcats (192?-50, consolidated into Southeast) * Deerfield Bison (192?-50, consolidated into Southeast) * Edinburgh Scots (192?-50, consolidated into Southeast) * Freedom Yellowjackets (192?-48, consolidated into Garfield) * Garrettsville Garfield G-Men (Garrettsville before 1948) (192?-2005, merged into PTC) * Hiram Huskies (1918\u201364, consolidated into Crestwood) * Mantua Hilltoppers, Big Red, then Red Devils (1918\u201350, consolidated into Mantua-Shalersville) * Mantua Center Mantua Township Trojans (1918\u201348, consolidated into Mantua) * Mogadore Wildcats (192?-57, 1968-2005, merged into PTC) * Nelson Pirates (192?-48, consolidated into Garfield) * Palmyra Southeast Pirates (1950\u201358, 1961-2005, merged into PTC) * Palmyra (1918\u201350, consolidated into Southeast) * Wayland Paris Nightriders (192?-50, consolidated into Southeast) * Randolph Tigers (192?-67, consolidated into Waterloo) * Ravenna Township Bulldogs (1918\u201360, consolidated into Ravenna) * Rootstown Rovers (192?-2005, merged into PTC) * Shalersville Rams, also Owls (192?-50, consolidated into Mantua-Shalersville) * Streetsboro Rockets (192?-1950; 1963\u20132005, merged into PTC) * Suffield Big Red, also Red Devils or Red Riders (192?-61, consolidated into Field) * Windham Bombers (Yellow Jackets before 1939) (192?-53, 1961-2005, merged into PTC) * Mantua Crestwood Red Devils (Mantua-Shalersville until 1955) (1950\u201358, 1961-2005, merged into PTC) * Kent State Statesmen (1960\u201372, Blue Devils before 1956, school closed) * Brimfield Field Falcons (Big Red until 1980s) (1961\u201376, 1990-2005, merged into PTC) * Atwater Waterloo Vikings (1967-2005, merged into PTC) * Peninsula Woodridge Bulldogs (1978-2005, merged into PTC) ==Premier Athletic Conference== * Chardon Hilltoppers (1998-2015, to Western Reserve Conference) * Ashtabula Lakeside Dragons (2007\u201315, to All-American Conference) * Geneva Eagles (2009\u201315, to Chagrin Valley Conference) * Madison Blue Streaks (1998-2015, to Western Reserve Conference) * Eastlake North Rangers (1998-2015, to Western Reserve Conference) * Painesville Riverside Beavers (1998-2015, to Western Reserve Conference) * Willoughby South Rebels (1998-2015, to Western Reserve Conference) * Hunting Valley University Preppers (2009\u201315, to Independents) ==Section One League== Originally the Stark County B League, this league ended in 1960, as its last remaining member moved to the Stark County AA League. * Beach City Pirates (1921\u201360, consolidated into Fairless) * Brewster Railroaders (1921\u201360, consolidated into Fairless) * Canal Fulton Indians (1921\u201352, consolidated into Northwest) * East Sparta Spartans (1921\u201353, consolidated into Sandy Valley) * Greentown Greyhounds (1921\u201353, consolidated into North Canton) * Hartville Blue Streaks (1921\u201358, consolidated into Lake) * Lexington Lions (1921\u201357, consolidated into Marlington) * Magnolia Panthers (1921\u201353, consolidated into Sandy Valley) * Marlboro Dukes (1921\u201357, consolidated into Marlington) * Navarre Rams (1921\u201360, consolidated into Fairless) * Uniontown Bobcats (1921\u201358, consolidated into Lake) * Washington Warriors (1921\u201357, consolidated into Marlington) * Waynesburg Mohawks (1921\u201353, consolidated into Sandy Valley) * Canton Oakwood Golden Raiders (1933\u201360, to Stark County AA League) ==Senate League== Originally the Stark County A League when formed in 1921, the league adjusted its name when Ohio went from \"A\"/\"B\" classification to \"AA\"/\"A\" in 1957.
