The dynasty governed as a Muslim theocracy for a century and a half from its capital Tiaret (in modern Algeria) until the Ismaili Fatimid Caliphate destroyed it. Their realm extended mostly to current central Algeria, but also Libya.Algeria.comConcise History of Islam - Muzaffar Husain Syed, Syed Saud Akhtar, B D Usmani \"The exact extent of its dominions is not entirely clear, but it stretched as far east as Jabal Nafusa in Libya\" ==History== Genealogy of the Rustamid dynasty The Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b movement reached North Africa by 719, when the missionary Salma ibn Sa'd was sent from the Ib\u0101d\u012b jama'a of Basra to Kairouan. By 740, their efforts had converted the major Berber tribes of Huwara around Tripoli, in the Nafusa Mountains and at Zenata in western Tripolitania. In 757 (140 AH), a group of four Basra-educated missionaries including \u02bbAbd ar-Rahm\u0101n ibn Rustam proclaimed an Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b imamate, starting an abortive state led by Abu l-Khattab Abdul-A'la ibn as-Samh which lasted until the Abbasid Caliphate dispatched Muhammad ibn al-Ash'ath al-Khuza'i to suppress it in 761, and Abul-Khattab Abdul-A'la ibn as-Samh was killed. On his death, the Tripolitanian Ib\u0101diyya elected Abu l-Hatim al-Malzuzi as Im\u0101m; he was killed in 772 after launching a second unsuccessful revolt in 768. After this, the center of power shifted to Algeria, and, in 777, \u02bbAbd ar-Rahm\u0101n ibn Rustam, an Ifriqiyan-born convert to the Ib\u0101\u1e0d\u012b movement of Persian originBritannica Encyclopedia, Retrieved on 18 December 2008. and one of the four founders of the imamate, was elected Im\u0101m; after this, the post remained in his family, a practice which the Ib\u0101diyya justified by noting that he came from no tribe, and thus his family had no bias towards any of the tribes of which the state was formed. The new imamate was centered on the newly built capital of Tiaret; several Ib\u0101d\u012b tribes displaced from Tunisia and Tripolitania settled there and strong fortifications were built. It became a major stop on the newly developing trade routes with sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East. Ibn as-Saghir also describes the Im\u0101m as ascetic, repairing his own house and refusing gifts; the citizens sharply criticized him if they considered him derelict in his duty. Religious ethics were strictly enforced by law. The Rustamids fought the Kairouan-based Aghlabids of Ifriqiya in 812, but otherwise reached a modus vivendi; this displeased Ib\u0101d\u012b tribes on the Aghlabid border, who launched a few rebellions. After Abdu l-Wahh\u0101b, the Rustamids grew militarily weak; they were easily conquered by the Ismaili Fatimids in 909, upon which many Ib\u0101\u1e0dis \u2013 including the last Im\u0101m \u2013 fled to the Sedrata tribe of Ouargla, whence they would ultimately emigrate to Mzab. The Rustamid dynasty, \"developed a cosmopolitan reputation in which Christians, non-Kharijite Muslims, and adherents of different sects of Kharijism lived\".John P. Entelis, Algeria: The Revolution Institutionalized, page 14. On the intellectual field, the Rustamids had many scholars and learned men, such as \u2018Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rustam, \u2018Abd al-Wahhab ibn \u2018Abd ar-Rahman, Aflah ibn \u2018Abd al-Wahhab, dan Abu al-Yaqzhan ibn Aflah, Mahdi an-Nafusi, \u2018Abd Allah al-Lamthi, and Mahmud ibn Bakr. \u2018Abd ar-Rahman had an exegesis of the Qur\u2019an. \u2018Abd al-Wahhab wrote his Masa'il Nafusah on Islamic jurisprudence. Aflah mastered Arabic literature, mathematics, and astronomy. Abu al-Yaqzhan wrote about 40 works. Because of their intellectual enthusiasm, the Rustamids vigorously transferred valuable works from the Mashriq to the Maghrib, especially to the library of al- Ma\u2018shumah (in Tahert) and that of Khizanah Nafusah (in Jabal Nafusah). Moreover, Tahert was famous as \u2018Iraq al-Maghrib, al-\u2018Iraq ash-Shaghir, Balkh al-Maghrib, or Little Basra. Apart from these achievements, the Rustamids also had significant contribution to Islamization in the Maghrib and Bilad as- Sudan. For about two centuries (130-340 AH / 750-950 AD), the Kharijite people gained control of trade routes in the Maghrib and Bilad as-Sudan. Many Ibadite merchants made journeys along the vast area, such as Tahert, Wargla, Nafzawa, Jabal Nafusah, Tadmakkat, Gao, and Ghana. By this economic activity, the Ibadites took advantages of trading business and preaching Islam at the same time.Ahmad Choirul Rofiq, \"Moderation and Civilization: A Historical Analysis on the Moderate Policy of the Rustamid Dynasty\" in http://journal.umpo.ac.id/index.php/aristo/article/view/1031 ==Rustamid Imams== *Abd al-Rahman ibn Rustam (B\u0101n\u016b-B\u0101d\u016bsy\u0101n) (776-788) *Abd al-Wahhab ibn Abd al-Rahman (788-824) * Aflah ibn \u02bfAbdi l-Wahhab (824-872) * Abu Bakr ibn Aflah (872-874) * Muhammad Abu l-Yaqzan ibn Aflah (874-894) * Yusuf Abu Hatim ibn Muhammad Abi l-Yaqzan (894-895) * Ya\u02bfqub ibn Aflah (895-899) * Yusuf Abu Hatim ibn Muhammad Abi l-Yaqzan, again (899-906) * Yaqzan ibn Muhammad Abi l-Yaqzan (906-909) ==References== === Sources === * Wheatley, Paul, \"The Places where Men Pray Together: Cities in Islamic Lands, Seventh Through the Tenth Centuries\", Published by University of Chicago Press, 2001, . * The Encyclopedia of World History * Card of Rustamid or Tahert Kingdom. * Rustamid Dynasty Encyclopedy Britanica. * Category:Medieval Algeria Category:Former countries in Africa Category:Algerian people of Iranian descent Category:Iranian Muslim dynasties Category:Lists of office-holders Category:777 establishments Category:States and territories established in the 770s Category:States and territories disestablished in the 900s Category:909 disestablishments Category:8th-century establishments in Africa Category:10th- century disestablishments in Africa ",
