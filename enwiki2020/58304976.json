    "text": "Essam Shiha is an Egyptian lawyer, politician and human rights activist. Shiha is a member of the supreme committee of The Wafd Party and was one of the protegees of one of the party's historical leaders Fouad Serageddin. Shiha led a reformist faction of the Wafd that opposed El-Sayyid el-Badawi's leadership of the party which led to his suspension for a few years. However Shiha was reinstated to his old post in the party after Bahaa El-Din Abu Shoka replaced el Badawi as party leader. Shiha is also an ardent defender of human rights and basic freedoms, and is currently the Secretary General of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights, one of Egypt's oldest and largest human rights associations. ==References== Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Egyptian lawyers Category:Wafd Party politicians Category:Egyptian human rights activists ",
