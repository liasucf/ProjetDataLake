    "text": "Otis Ray \"Killer\" Appleton (August 23, 1941 \u2013 October 7, 2015) was an American jazz drummer. Born in Indianapolis, Indiana, his interest in drums began when visiting the local fire department to hear their \"Drum and Bugle Corps\" practice. He played in school bands, but hearing Freddie Hubbard and James Spaulding led to a serious interest in jazz. He reportedly received his nickname \"killer\" from bassist Larry Ridley and became a person of note in Indianapolis's jazz community. He toured and recorded with John Coltrane, Freddie Hubbard, Wes Montgomery and others. Due to a car accident and diabetes, he lost part of his left leg in 1997. Ray Appleton died of congestive heart failure on October 7, 2015, at age 74. ==Discography== ;With Jimmy Witherspoon * The Blues Is Now (1967) ;With Freddie Hubbard * Backlash (1967) ==References== ==External links== *Ray Appleton website Category:1941 births Category:2015 deaths Category:African-American jazz musicians Category:American jazz drummers Category:American amputees Category:Musicians from Indianapolis ",
