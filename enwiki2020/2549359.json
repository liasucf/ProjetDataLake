Retrieved 27 February 2010. The band relocated to Melbourne in 2001. Full Scale released two extended plays; Black Arrows and White Arrows both in 2003 on Popstar Records. They also released a self-titled studio album issued in 2005 on Columbia Records, Full Scale. ==History== Full Scale were formed in 1998 in Perth as Full Scale Deflection. By 1999, they consisted of Ezekiel the Ox on lead vocals, Nic Frey on drums, Chris Frey on bass guitar, Forrester Savell on synthesiser, and Jimmy Tee on guitar. Matt Crute (aka Crutey) soon replaced Nic Frey on drums. Rob Kaay replaced Chris Frey on bass guitar by 2000. They released the album, Symptoms of Chaos, on 11 November 2000. The band dropped the word Deflection from their name and then moved to Melbourne in 2001. Despite playing their original songs for some of their shows, they developed new music. Kaay and Andrew McGuiness (a lawyer) formed a record label, Popstar Records, and Full Scale released their debut extended play, Black Arrows in March 2003. This was followed by a second EP, White Arrows in August. There was a brief line-up change; Tee left the band, being replaced by Tristan Ross for about six months. Under the management of Kaay, the band toured the east coast extensively. According to Allmusic's reviewer, Johnny Loftus, \"the band's hard-hitting, gristly sound \u2013 led by Ox's vocal seethe \u2013 caught the interest of American majors\". By the end of the year, Tee rejoined and the band moved to Los Angeles where they were signed to Columbia Records (SonyBMG) and released their self-titled album, Full Scale, on 8 March 2005. After the album's release they toured the United States as the opening act for US rap rock band, Hed PE. Upon returning to Australia, Crutey and Tee decided to play one last show with the band and Ben Brennan (Seven, Full Scale Revolution) played his first show with Full Scale on bass guitar at the Corner Hotel in Melbourne on 17 March 2006.
