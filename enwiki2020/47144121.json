Following his graduation, Hathaway joined the Abbotsford Heat of the AHL, skating in 8 games with the Heat before the end of the 2013\u201314 season. The following season he remained in the AHL, relocating with his team to play as a member of the Adirondack Flames. During the 2014\u201315 season, Hathaway played 72 games with Adirondack, where his 19 goals and 36 points impressed the Calgary Flames' general manager Brad Treliving. On April 13, 2015, the Calgary Flames of the National Hockey League (NHL) signed Hathaway to a two-year two-way contract. After spending much of the 2015\u201316 season with the Stockton Heat, Hathaway earned his first recall and made his NHL debut for the Flames on February 29, 2016, in a 4\u20133 loss to the Philadelphia Flyers. Hathaway scored his first career NHL goal on November 20, 2016, against the Detroit Red Wings. After six seasons within the Flames organization, Hathaway left as a free agent to sign a lucrative four-year $6 million contract with the Washington Capitals on July 1, 2019. ==Career statistics== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
