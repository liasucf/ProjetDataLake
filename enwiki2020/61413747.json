    "text": "The Atkins and Smith House, at 390 N. 400 West in Beaver, Utah, was built in 1873. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It was built in two parts, probably both by Thomas Frazer, the Scottish-born local stonemason. The first part was a one-room black rock cottage, with a symmetric window-door-window front facade, with ashlar stonework, and with wood lintels and a Greek Revival style cornice. It was one of the first \"permanent\" houses in Beaver, and was probably built for James Atkins. The second is a pink rock one-and-a-half-story addition built around 1890 on the north side of the original cottage, with jerkinheads and a broad cornice. Its windows and doors have pink rock lintels. It was built for John A. Smith, then the new owner. The house is significant for its \"unaltered, historic design.\" With ==References== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Beaver County, Utah Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1873 ",
