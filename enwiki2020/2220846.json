    "text": "In the theory of cybernetics, teleogenesis (from the Greek teleos = 'purpose' and genesis = 'creation') is the creation of goal-creating processes. According to Peter Corning: \"A cybernetic system is by definition a dynamic purposive system; it is 'designed' to pursue or maintain one or more goals or end-states\". Teleogenesis refers from an extension of classical cybernetics, as proposed by Norbert Wiener, Ashby and others in late 1950s. ==See also== *Homeostasis *Homeorhesis ==References== *Corning, Peter A. \"Thermoeconomics: Beyond the second law\" from: www.complexsystems.org Category:Cybernetics ",
