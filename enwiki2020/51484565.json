    "text": "Frank M\u00fccklich (born August 17, 1959) is a German materials scientist. He is professor at Saarland University and leads the Chair of Functional Materials. == Biography == Frank M\u00fccklich was born in Dresden, Germany. He grew up in Freiberg where he attended the Geschwister-Scholl-Gymnasium. From 1980 to 1985, M\u00fccklich studied Physical Metallurgy and Materials Science at the Freiberg University of Mining and Technology. In 1988, he received his PhD with a dissertation on 'X-ray diffraction analysis of point defects in highly perfect Gallium arsenide single crystals' at the Heinrich Oettel Institute. As postdoctoral researcher he stayed at the University of Technology in Freiberg where he headed the metallography working group at the Institute of Physical Metallurgy. In 1990, M\u00fccklich went on a Max Planck scholarship to the Max Planck Institute for Metals Research in Stuttgart led by G\u00fcnter Petzow and became group leader for functional materials. Five years later, he was appointed professor at Saarland University and built up the Chair of Functional Materials. In 2008, he founded the European School of Materials and, in 2009, the Material Engineering Center Saarland as a research center of the Steinbeis Foundation.Frank M\u00fccklich's Curriculum Vitae == Scientific contributions == M\u00fccklich works in the areas of surface structuring and material characterization. His focus is on surfaces and thin films exploring new possibilities of material functionalisation mainly by pulsed laser beams, as well as thin film phenomena and electrical erosion. His research concerns the three-dimensional microstructure of materials at micro-, nano- and atomic- scale. He works scale-dependent with various experimental and theoretical methods. Together with the mathematician Joachim Ohser he described the theoretical background of his research in the book 'Statistical Analysis of Microstructures in Materials Science'. == Honors == * 1994: Georg Masing Memorial Prize of the German Society for Materials Science * 1997: Alfried Krupp Prize for Young University Teachers of the Alfried Krupp von Bohlen und Halbach Foundation * 2007: Werner K\u00f6ster Award of the German Society for Materials Science (together with Claus Daniel and Andr\u00e9s Lasagni) * 2008: Roland Mitsche Prize of ASMET Austria and the German Society for Materials Science * 2010: Werner K\u00f6ster Award of the German Society for Materials Science (together with Alexandra Velichko) * 2012: L\u00f6hn Award, transfer prize of the Steinbeis Foundation * 2013: Copper innovation prize of the German Copper Institute * 2016: Henry Clifton Sorby Award of ASM International https://www.asminternational.org/documents/17848952/0/SORBY+AWARD+PAST+RECIPIENTS+ONLY.pdf/b5ad32eb-31de-6c0a-8990-58a73ef28893 * 2016: Berthold Leibinger Innovationspreis * 2018: Full member of the German Academy of Science and Engineering (acatech) * 2018: Fellow of the American Society for Materials *2018: President (Science) of the German Materials Society (DGM) == External links and sources == * Chair for Functional Materials at Saarland University * Material Engineering Center Saarland (MECS) * European School of Materials (EUSMAT) * Google Scholar Profile ==References== Category:1959 births Category:German materials scientists Category:Living people Category:Saarland University faculty Category:Scientists from Dresden ",
