    "text": "Cut view of a homoeoid in 3D A homoeoid is a shell (a bounded region) bounded by two concentric, similar ellipses (in 2D) or ellipsoids (in 3D).Chandrasekhar, S.: Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium, Yale Univ. Press. London (1969)Routh, E. J.: A Treatise on Analytical Statics, Vol II, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge (1882) When the thickness of the shell becomes negligible, it is called a thin homoeoid. The name homoeoid was coined by Lord Kelvin and Peter Tait.Harry Bateman. \"Partial differential equations of mathematical physics.\", Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1932 (1932). ==Mathematical definition== If the outer shell is given by : \\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\\frac{z^2}{c^2}=1 with semiaxes a,b,c the inner shell is given for 0 \\leq m \\leq 1 by : \\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\\frac{y^2}{b^2}+\\frac{z^2}{c^2}=m^2 . The thin homoeoid is then given by the limit m \\to 1 ==Physical meaning== A homoeoid can be used as a construction element of a matter or charge distribution. The gravitational or electromagnetic potential of a homoeoid homogeneously filled with matter or charge is constant inside the shell. This means that a test mass or charge will not feel any force inside the shell.Michel Chasles, Solution nouvelle du probl\u00e8me de l\u2019attraction d\u2019un ellipso\u00efde h\u00e9t\u00e9rog\u00e8ne sur un point exterieur, Jour.
