    "text": "Lugdunin is an investigational antibiotic, classified as a thiazolidine- containing cyclic peptide. It was isolated in 2016 after Staphylococcus lugdunensis was identified as the species of bacteria from the human nose that suppressed growth of species of disease-causing bacteria in that part of the human microbiome. Lugdunin is a non-ribosomally synthesized cyclic peptide that inhibits growth of Staphylococcus aureus strains. The lugdunin genes are located on a 30-kbp operon. The genes lugA, lugB, lugC, and lugD encode four non-ribosomal peptide synthases, which are preceded by a putative regulator gene lugR. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Gene ! locustag ! protein size/aa !
