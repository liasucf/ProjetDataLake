    "text": "Christian persecution complex is a belief, attitude or world view that Christian values and Christians are being oppressed by social groups and governments.: According to Hoover Linda \"...Castelli (2007) believed the reluctance to self-disclose could be the \"Christian persecution complex\" (p. 156), an ideology that Christian values are unfavorably targeted by social and governmental opposition...\" This belief is promoted by certain American Protestant churches, some Christian- or Bible-based cults and in Europe as well.: Afterword: White Nationalism, Trolling Humor as Propaganda, and the \"Renaissance\" of Christian Racism in the Age of Trump. \"In so doing, he, his speech writers, and advisors were pandering to the rising Christian white nationalist persecution complex in Poland and throughout Europe, giving voice to a message that Western Christianity\u2014and Europeans\u2014will defeat fundamentalist Islamism. He even concluded with an overt call to a modernday Crusade: \"So together, let us all fight like the Poles, for family, for freedom, for country, and for God.\"\" It has been called the \"Evangelical\", \"American Christian\" or \"Christian right\" persecution complex. ==Early Christianity== According to New Testament scholar Candida Moss the Christian \"persecution complex\" appeared during the era of early Christianity due to internal Christian identity politics.: Indeed, a recent study by Candida Moss, The Myth of Persecution has suggested that Christian \"persecution complex\" was the result of internal Christian identity politics Moss suggested that the idea of persecution is cardinal to the worldview of Christianity, noting that it creates the impression that Christians are a minority that are facing a war \u2013 even though they are numerically superior.: Candida Moss has argued that the notion of persecution is all but essential to Christianity as a worldview, tracing the discursive construction of martyrdom from Antiquity and up to the present, pointing to its constitutive role for the self-understanding of Christians as embattled minorities \u2013 even while numerically superior This perception is grounded in the manichaeistic belief that the world is divided into two factions, one led by God and the other by Satan. In this view there can be no compromise between the two, and even attempting to dialogue or engage with \"the other\" is seen as a form of collaboration with it.: The myth of persecution is theologically grounded in the division of the world into two parties, one backed by God and the other by Satan...And everyone knows you cannot reason with devil. Even when devil is not explicitly invoked, the rhetoric of persecution suggests that the persecutors are irrational and immoral and the persecuted are innocent and brave. In a world filled with persecution, efforts to negotiate or even reason with one's persecutors are interpreted as collaboration and moral compromise. We should not attempt to understand the other party, because to do so would be to cede ground to injustice and hatred Medieval historian Paul Cavill argues that the New Testament teaches that persecutions are inherent to Christianity.: The early Christian persecution complex is often underemphasised, but is important. The New Testament teaches that persecution is the inevitable by-product of effective Christianity. == 20th and 21st centuries == Many find it difficult to define the origin of the Christian persecution complex. According to Elizabeth Castelli,: \"There is no precise origin point for the contemporary discursive project of the Christian persecution complex\" some set the starting point in the middle of the 20th century, following a series of court rulings that declared public places to be out of bounds for religious activity (e.g. morning prayer in schools).: For those who have upped the ante by recently deciding to characterize the circumstances of Christians in the United States as the \"war on Christians, the historical turning point tends to reside in the mid-twentieth century, when a series of federal and Supreme court decisions declared certain public institutions off-limits for sectarian religious activity (e.g., prayer and Bible reading in public schools). For the Christian activists who view these court decisions as opening skirmishes in the war on Christians, the decisions and the \"activist judges\" who promulgated them effectively\u2014and dangerously\u2014banned God from the public square. However, it became apparent in the United States in the 1990s with the adoption of the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 as the official foreign policy. A few years later, the September 11 attacks boosted its development. This complex \"mobilizes the language of religious persecution to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of anti-religious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority\".:According to Elizabeth Castelli, this engagement can be ascribed to a 'Christian persecution complex' that gathered pace throughout the 1990s, with the adoption of the US International Religious Freedom Act in 1998 as a significant milestone, and with the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 as an accelerating factor (Castelli 2007: 173). This complex \"\u2026mobilizes the language of religious persecution to shut down political debate and critique by characterizing any position not in alignment with this politicized version of Christianity as an example of antireligious bigotry and persecution. Moreover, it routinely deploys the archetypal figure of the martyr as a source of unquestioned religious and political authority.\" (Castelli 2007: 154). The concept that Christianity is being oppressed is popular among conservative politicians in contemporary politics in the United States, and they utilize this idea to address issues concerning LGBT people or the Affordable Care Act's contraceptive mandate, which they perceive as an attack on Christianity.: \"...The notion that Christianity is under attack is prevalent in contemporary arguments for religious exemptions. Conservative legislatures, politicians and the media frequently characterize issues such as same-sex marriage and the ACA's Contraceptives Mandate as attacks on Christians or Christianity....\" The application of the contraceptive mandate to closely held corporations with religious objections was struck down by the Supreme Court in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. Hornback notes that the Christian persecution complex is widespread among nationalists in Europe, who feel that they are defending the continent from a new Islamic invasion. Stavrakopoulou explains that the advances of secularism, such as dropping catechism from public schools, is perceived by some Christians as persecution.at 22:40) It was recorded at the World Humanist Congress 2014, Oxford, UK. Held by IHEU, run by the British Humanist Association (BHA).. Christian persecution complex has an impact on popular culture, with films which \"imagine embattled Christians prevailing against entrenched secularist opposition\". Carey, G. (2017).

This term unfairly stigmatizes all evangelicals but identifies a widely shared sensitivity. Some Christians major in the persecution complex, even to the point of associating florists who will not serve same-sex couples with actual Christian martyrs in the Middle East.24 Recent films like God's Not Dead and God's Not Dead 2 imagine embattled Christians prevailing against entrenched secularist opposition\" That explains the film critique that was mentioned above. David Ehrlich, a film critic, describes how the persecution complex is fueled by films and media such as the God's Not Dead saga. In a conversation at the British Humanist Congress in 2014, Stavrakopoulou suggested that some Christian fundamentalists perceive the advancement of secularism as a threat, and that this may support the idea of a persecution complex.Video at 22:40) It was recorded at the World Humanist Congress 2014, Oxford, UK.

Some contemporary white nationalists promote a narrative of Western persecution of Christians, arguing that they, rather than minority or immigrant populations, are most often attacked and marginalized. ==See also== *God's Not Dead *God's Not Dead 2 *God's Not Dead: A Light in Darkness *Persecution of Christians *Victim mentality *Victim playing *White genocide conspiracy theory *Alliance Defending Freedom *Town of Greece v.
