Retrieved August 26, 2016. was an American professor of sociology at Brandeis University and an author. He was the subject of the best-selling book Tuesdays with Morrie, written by Mitch Albom, a former student of Schwartz. He was portrayed by Jack Lemmon in the 1999 television film adaptation of the book. ==Personal life== Schwartz was the son of Charlie Schwartz, a Russian-Jewish immigrant who migrated from Russia to escape the army. Schwartz's mother died when he was eight years old, and his brother David developed polio at a young age. His father would eventually marry a Romanian woman named Eva Schneiderman. Later in Schwartz's life, his father suffered from a heart attack after fleeing a mugging. Schwartz came from a Jewish family, but as an adult he adopted multiple beliefs from a variety of different religions. Schwartz had two sons with his wife Charlotte, Rob and Jon. ==Tuesdays with Morrie== Schwartz achieved national prominence posthumously after being featured as the subject of Mitch Albom's 1997 best- selling memoir, Tuesdays with Morrie. Albom had been a student of Schwartz's at Brandeis University, and years later had seen Schwartz on the television program Nightline. After Albom phoned Schwartz, he made a series of trips to visit him in the final weeks of Schwartz's life as he was gradually overtaken by ALS. The book recounts the fourteen visits Albom made, their conversations, Schwartz's lectures, and his life experiences. The book was adapted into a television film in 1999, starring Jack Lemmon as Schwartz. ==Works== *with Alfred H.
