A musical continuation of his commercially successful debut, he worked with a small number of new collaborators on the album apart from Bohlen, including Yak Bondy, Ingo Politz, and Brix. Like its predecessor, the album debuted atop the German Albums Chart and reached the top ten in Austria and Switzerland, but it ultimately failed to live up to the overwhelming success of his debut album. In spite of this, the album managed to snag Klaws another three hit singles, including the top five hits \"Behind the Sun\" and \"Sunshine After the Rain\" as well as the top 20 entry \"Here I Am\". Also in 2004, Klaws was cast in a supporting role in an episode of the German television series Das Traumhotel, filmed in Bali and broadcast the following year.

The English version of the song peaked at number 12 on the German Singles Chart was later included on his third album, Attention! (2006). Recorded after a short-living hiatus from recording in which she had studied song and acting at the Joop van den Ende Academie in Hamburg, it marked a departure from Klaws's previous work with Bohlen, who gained no credit on the record. Instead, Klaws consulted a wider range of producers to work with him on the album, including Terri Bjerre, Thorsten Br\u00f6tzmann, and Ivo Moring, who took his work further into the pop rock genre. Upon its release, Attention! became a top 20 success in Austria and Germany only, prompting SonyBMG not to release another single from the album. === 2007\u2013present: Musical theatre === Klaws performing in 2008 In December 2006, Klaws made his musical theatre debut at the Theater des Westens stage in Berlin in 2006, playing the role of Alfred in the musical remake of Roman Polanski's satirical horror drama Dance of the Vampires (1967).
