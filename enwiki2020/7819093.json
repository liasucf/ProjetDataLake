    "text": "7th Avenue is the major-label debut album by rapper KJ-52, and his only release before signing to BEC Recordings. The album notably contains little to no pop influence, instead favoring underground and old school hip hop. The album was largely recorded in 1998, shopped to labels in 1999 and finally released in early 2000. The original version released in 2000 initially sold only 20,000 copies and was considered a \"failure\" by the label. KJ was dropped soon after. In 2004, 7th Avenue was re-released by Essential after seeing the success of KJ's second release, Collaborations. The 2004 edition quickly sold 50,000 additional units and became a cult classic amongst fans. The re-release contained bonus tracks including \"Lift Me Up,\" \"All Around the World\", \"Need Someone\", \"It's The S.O.I. (Remix)\", and \"12 Round Knockout.\" All skits, as well as the songs \"Cipha All-Stars\" and \"They Know Not\" were removed for the re-release. ==Track listing== ===2000 version=== # \"The Greatest M.C.
