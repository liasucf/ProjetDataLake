    "text": "The 1978 season ended with the Los Angeles Dodgers winning their second straight National League pennant and losing to the New York Yankees in the World Series again. Dodger coach Jim Gilliam died at the end of the season and his uniform number, 19, was retired by the team prior to Game 1 of the World Series; the team also wore a black memorial patch with Gilliam's number during the World Series. Unlike the previous Dodger team, no member of the team hit 30 home runs after seeing four members hit that mark the previous season (the team leader was Reggie Smith, with 29). == Offseason == * November 23, 1977: Dennis Lewallyn was purchased from the Dodgers by the Minnesota Twins.Dennis Lewallyn page at Baseball Reference * January 31, 1978: El\u00edas Sosa was purchased from the Dodgers by the Pittsburgh Pirates.El\u00edas Sosa page at Baseball Reference == Regular season == === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Opening day lineup === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left\" |+ ! colspan=\"2\" |Opening Day starters |- !Name !!Position |- |Davey Lopes || Second baseman |- |Bill Russell || Shortstop |- |Reggie Smith||Rightfielder |- |Ron Cey || Third baseman |- |Steve Garvey || First baseman |- |Dusty Baker || Leftfielder |- |Rick Monday || Centerfielder |- |Steve Yeager||Catcher |- |Don Sutton ||Starting Pitcher |- |} === Notable transactions === * May 17, 1978: Glenn Burke was traded by the Dodgers to the Oakland Athletics for Billy North.Glenn Burke page at Baseball Reference * May 20, 1978: Mike Garman was traded by the Dodgers to the Montreal Expos for Larry Landreth and Gerry Hannahs.Mike Garman page at Baseball Reference * July 1, 1978: The Dodgers traded players to be named later to the Houston Astros for Joe Ferguson and cash.

Reggie doesn't go out and publicize himself. He doesn't smile at the right people or say the right things. Reggie's not a fa\u00e7ade or a Madison Avenue image. He's a real person.\" Garvey and Sutton wrestled for two minutes in the clubhouse over Sutton's words and had to be pulled apart by teammates. Neither was seriously injured. Both had facial scratches and bruises and Garvey had a bloodshot left eye where it appeared a finger or thumb had been inserted by Sutton. Days later, Sutton publicly apologized for the incident, but not to Garvey personally.https://www.si.com/vault/issue/70797/25 == Player stats == === Batting === ==== Starters by position ==== Note: Pos = Position; G = Games played; AB = At bats; H = Hits; Avg. = Batting average; HR = Home runs; RBI = Runs batted in {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

Of those, seven players would eventually play in the Major Leagues. The Dodgers did not have a first round pick this year in the June draft as their pick was given to the Pittsburgh Pirates as compensation for their signing of Free Agent pitcher Terry Forster. In the second round, they selected SS Clay Smith from Northwest Classen High School in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Smith played in the Dodgers farm system through 1981, hitting .271 in 277 games in the rookie leagues and class-A before he was released. This draft netted the Dodgers two key players for their championship teams of the 1980s. They drafted Mike Marshall in the 6th round and Steve Sax in the 9th. Marshall would hit 148 homers in 11 seasons and made the All-Star team in 1984 while playing both the outfield and first base. Sax played 14 seasons (8 of them with the Dodgers) and hit .281 with 444 steals. The Dodgers starting second baseman for most of the 1980s, he was the 1982 NL Rookie of the Year and a five time All-Star. {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%;
