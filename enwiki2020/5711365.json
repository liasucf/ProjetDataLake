    "text": "Rog\u00e9rio Lima Manganelli (born October 31, 1973), commonly known as Roger Lima, is a Brazilian-American bassist, guitarist, singer, songwriter and producer. He is best known as the bassist and co-lead vocalist of American ska-punk band Less Than Jake. Lima also performs as the lead singer and rhythm guitarist of punk rock band Rehasher, and has another band called Greenhorn. ==Less Than Jake== Lima (October 31, 1973, Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil) is the second bassist for Less Than Jake (replacing original bassist Shaun Grief) and has appeared on all of Less Than Jake's albums. Previously a guitar player, he played bass for the first time when he joined the band. In addition to playing bass, he shares singing duties with Chris DeMakes. Lima produces Less than Jake's demos and some official releases (for example, Absolution for Idiots and Addicts (EP) of 2006), and co-produced GNV FLA of 2008, and was the producer of See The Light of 2013. Lima often plays the guitar tracks on the records. Occasionally, he has also played the second guitar onstage with Less Than Jake - for example, when performing \"Last Hour of the Last Day of Work\" or \"The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out/Screws Fall Out.\" He has been known to be the most conspicuous member of the group due to his charismatic stage presence and his dreadlock hairstyle. For bass equipment, Roger currently uses Eden Electronics amplifiers and cabinets, Music Man Sterling basses in various colors, and Ernie Ball strings. ==Rehasher== Lima formed Rehasher in 2000 with members of Army of Ponch and Savage Brewtality. Rehasher was a return to his roots from the more serious, popular, Less than Jake. He is more proactive as a member of Rehasher\u2014as their lead singer, rhythm guitarist, songwriter, lyricist, and producer. In addition to this, in Rehasher's latest album Lima has been responsible for tracking all the guitar parts as well as the bass ones, hence assuming the roles previously belonging to band members Ryan Geis and Gui Amador (though neither of these members have quit Rehasher). Unfortunately, Lima is only able to work with Rehasher when Less than Jake has time off. Rehasher's second album was released in vinyl form on August 28, 2009; and in CD form on October 27, 2009. ==Greenhorn== Lima began another side project in 2014 with Jen Vito from the band No More. Greenhorn as the duo is called released a six song EP on anchorless records called \"I Want More \". On July 8, 2014 the EP became available on ITunes. Lima plays all the instruments on the EP as well as shares vocal duties with Vito. The EP was recorded at Lima's studio The Moathouse. ==Moathouse Productions== The Moat House is a nickname for Lima's house in Gainesville. Moathouse Productions is the name of his studio, run out of aforementioned Moat House. Lima works in his studio with small bands, mostly unsigned, but has recorded several Less Than Jake releases at the Moat House including 2013's \"See The Light\". He uses Pro Tools for his recording purposes, and his services include mixing, recording, producing, etc. He also has a range of instruments and gear available to those who wish to record at his studio. In 2009, with the launch of Rehasher's new album, High Speed Access to My Brain, Moathouse made a debut as a record label in addition to its existing function as a studio. Bands that Lima has worked with are The Dopamines, Teen Agers, Morning Fatty, Backyard Superheroes and Bullets to Broadway to name a few. ==References== == External links == *Moathouse Productions *Rehasher *Less than Jake *Eden Amplification Category:Living people Category:Musicians from Gainesville, Florida Category:American punk rock bass guitarists Category:American male bass guitarists Category:American ska bass guitarists Category:American ska singers Category:People from Porto Alegre Category:1974 births Category:Brazilian emigrants to the United States Category:Writers from Gainesville, Florida Category:Guitarists from Florida Category:21st-century American singers Category:21st-century American bass guitarists Category:21st-century male singers ",
