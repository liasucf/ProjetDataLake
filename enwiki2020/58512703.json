Fekete Sereg literally means \"black army\", which is a common name given to the military forces serving under the reign of King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary. The most famous general of the army was P\u00e1l Kinizsi, whose central estate was the Castle of Nagyv\u00e1zsony.For that very reason the founders had decided to give this name for the association, above all in honour of the famous general Kinizsi. In the village the Kinizsi cult is of significant importance also nowadays. For example, the name of the castle is \"Kinizsi-v\u00e1r\" i.e. \"Castle of Kinizsi\".In sum: the name symbolizes the cult of Kinizsi and the attachment to local traditions. ==Main activities== The Association has several activities. The target groups are diverse: students, unemployed, minorities (gypsies), disadvantages and handicaps people.http://www.annalindhfoundation.org/fr/members/fekete-sereg-youth- association The activities \\- EVS (European Voluntary Service https://www.bevolunteer.net/yosehungaryhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ExqWVNDR7chttps://www.up2europe.eu/european/projects/voice- of-nagyvazsony_99648.html \\- Media program (since 2001): Publisher of a local newsletter (Sereghajt\u00f3) and the local TV http://www.annalindhfoundation.org/fr/members/fekete-sereg-youth- associationhttp://www.fekete- sereg.hu/doc_gallery/14/14/1_45_sereghajto_2008marc.pdf ==Memberships== EVS (European Voluntary Service: The association is an accredited European Voluntary Service hosting, sending and coordinating associationhttps://www.bevolunteer.net/yosehungary Anna Lindh Foundation http://www.annalindhfoundation.org/fr/members/fekete-sereg-youth-association ==Sources== Category:Organizations established in 1997 Category:International organisations based in Hungary ",
