Members of the Big Sky Conference, the Vandals were led by second-year head coach Tim Floyd and played their home games on campus at the Kibbie Dome in Moscow, Idaho. The Vandals were overall in the regular season and in conference play, runner-up in the standings. At the conference tournament in Bozeman, Montana, the Vandals earned a bye into the semifinals, but lost to host Montana State for the second time in a week.
