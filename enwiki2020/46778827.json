One of Norway's prominent shipbuilders, it was founded in 1855. The yard was founded by T\u00f8rris Knudsen Nes (later T\u00f8rris Skaaluren) who built the first sloop. Through four generations it built boats of wood, and in 1955 it began building ships with steel hulls, in compliance with and under the supervision of the Norwegian Ministry of Marine. It later became known for its building of chemical tankers, such as in 1982. Skaalurensamlinga is currently a museum where one can see how the old ships were made and the tools used. ==References== Category:Shipbuilding companies of Norway Category:Companies based in Hordaland Category:Kvinnherad Category:Companies established in 1855 ",
