Today known as Saint-Great, Gratus of Oloron became in 506 the first known archbishop of the Ancient Diocese of Oloron then known as \"Iluro\". The history of the town during the Migration Period is little known. In 1080, the viscount Centule V, Viscount of B\u00e9arn built the new city of \"Oloron\" (medieval version of the Roman name Iluro) on the opposite side of the river from the diocese center. Centulle V restored the Roman walls and founded the strong city of Oloron that was to be used as a base to retake the Aragon held by the Maures. The Oloron Cathedral was built at the beginning of the 12th century. The viscountal town of Oloron and the episcopal town of Sainte-Marie were then rivals, but Oloron strove on its textile industry and commerce with neighbouring Spain. Sainte- Marie became economically dependent upon Oloron. The 18th century was the beginning of revival for Sainte-Marie as the end of French Wars of Religion allowed for restorations and new religious constructions in the town : cathedral, seminary, church Saint-Pierre. Moreover, the continued boom of commerce with Spain accelerated the construction of better communication and transportation routes to Oloron and Sainte-Marie. With the French Revolution Oloron lost its diocese to Bayonne but gained administrative importance by becoming one of the sous-pr\u00e9fectures of the new Republic. In the 1858, the regent Impress Eug\u00e9nie imposed the reunification of the towns of Oloron and Sainte-Marie. ==Geography== === Location === Situated at the feet of the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, 50 km from the Spanish border and 100 km from the Atlantic ocean, Oloron-Sainte-Marie is at the confluence of two gaves (mountain rivers), the Gave d'Aspe and the Gave d'Ossau that merge to form the gave d'Oloron. Capital of the Haut-B\u00e9arn, Oloron-Sainte-Marie is also at the point of origin of the three Haut-B\u00e9arn valleys : the Aspe Valley, the Ossau Valley and the Bar\u00e9tous Valley.

Oloron is also famous, among hat enthusiasts, as the capital of the basque beret, although the beret business has fallen victim to the widespread collapse of the European textile business as well as changing fashions. Today only one beret business survives in Oloron. This is the B\u00e9atex company which employs approximately 80 people. The area also benefits from an active agriculture sector, involving animal rearing and general agriculture as well as maize production. It is also part of the AOC defined districts entitled to produce the ewes' cheese, Ossau-Iraty. == Transport == The railway from Pau to Canfranc passes through Oloron. Oloron railway station is served by TER Aquitaine, who operate eight trains per day to Pau and six to Bedous.

It is predominantly used for light aviation and leisure. == Culture and heritage == === Language === The local vernacular language is the B\u00e9arnese dialect, a dialect of Gascon language.
