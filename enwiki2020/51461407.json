Filmed simultaneously in Telugu and Tamil, it stars Mahesh Babu, Rakul Preet Singh, and S. J. Surya in lead roles. The music is composed by Harris Jayaraj, while Santosh Sivan handled the cinematography and A. Sreekar Prasad took care of editing the film. This film marks the Tamil debut of Mahesh Babu. The film follows Shiva (Mahesh Babu), an Intelligence Bureau officer, who sets out to save the people of Hyderabad when he realises that a psychopath (S.J. Surya) is on the loose. The production of the film and the film's principal photography commenced in July 2016. The film's title was revealed on 18 March 2017, while the first look of the film was released on 12 April 2017. Spyder was theatrically released worldwide in Telugu, Tamil and Malayalam on 27 September 2017. ==Plot== Shiva (Mahesh Babu), an officer in the Intelligence Bureau office, spies on people's calls and messages to help them if needed. He developed a software to listen to the needing ones by tracking their phones. On the night of 16 March, he listens to Charlie/Shalini (Rakul Preet Singh) talking about her wish on getting 98% in her exams from 96% to get a USA scholarship with her friend. In order to do that, she decides to get concentration by dating with a guy. Shiva follows her, and both starts to fall in love, but he does not concentrate on his love. On the night of 28 April, Shiva listens in on a young girl asking her friend for help as she is alone in her house and scared because there is no electricity in her house, whilst everyone else on her street has it. Shiva sends his friend, new police constable Renuka (Himaja), to help the girl. However the next day, a news channel declares that the two women had been killed. They were undressed, chopped into different pieces, and were mixed together. Shiva goes to the crime scene and finds it has been a brutal murder. He resigned from his job stating, \"I didn't help them, and I should've never sent out Renuka,\" but his father (Jayaprakash) encourages him to find the murderer. To find out who murdered them, he sets out to \"spy\" the girl's chats and whereabouts. Shiva finds that a guy followed her at a cafe. Through technology, he finds someone who knows the guy. He then travels to the village where the guy grew up, through the person who knew the guy. From an elderly villager, he learns the past about the guy, Bhairavudu/Sudalai (S. J. Surya). He suffers from sadistic personality disorder and has an unusual desire to kill people and see the victims' families grieving. One day, a village kid sees him killing a person and tells the other villagers. They decide to burn Bhairavudu/Sudalai's house, which his parents died from. Angry, he left the village to continue his killing spree with his younger brother (Bharath). Shiva manages to catch him, but instead he reveals to be his brother. Bhairavudu/Sudalai reveals he killed 23 people and hid their bodies in 23 pillars of a metro bridge and threatens the citizens to leave his brother unscathed. He also reveals that he plans to destroy a hospital. Shiva kills Bharaivadu\u2019s/Sudalai\u2019s brother in front of the 40 people's families, including an angry Bhairavudu/Sudalai. Bhairavudu/Sudalai plans to kill Shiva's family. Shiva finds out when his mother (Dheepa Ramanujam) calls him and tells him she is scared because there is no current in their house whilst everyone else on the street does, exactly the same as what the girl had said earlier. Shiva manages to save his family through his workmates. After failing to kill the family, Bhairavudu/Sudalai tries to kill Shiva on his way home, and Shiva gets impaled on a truck. He slowly recovers and gets back on getting Bhairavadu/Sudalai. Because Shiva had shot him before he fell unconscious, he thinks Bhairavudu/Sudalai has hidden himself in a house where he can heal, but he has imprisoned the owners. Through the use of technology and local ladies, he finds Bhairavudu/Sudalai and arrests him, but Bhairavudu/Sudalai tells him that he had already planned a big rock fall in the city. Shiva manages to stop the big rock whilst Bhairavudu/Sudalai escapes from police and continues with his plan on destroying a hospital. Charlie/Shalini finds out which hospital but refuses to tell Shiva due to misunderstanding. Shiva tracks down her taxi and she tells him which hospital it is. He rushes to the hospital and starts evacuating everyone. He saved as many as he could but could not save some patients, which he feels heartbroken over. Bhairavudu/Sudalai sees Shiva's grief and gets very happy. Shiva finally kills Bhairavudu/Sudalai and tells the media, \"We have only killed the patient but not the disease. Helping people you don\u2019t know is the greatest happiness in the world. We shouldn\u2019t use technology all the time because we don\u2019t have time to spend with others.\" He also tells them that there are other people who may have the same exact disease. The movie ends with Shiva walking with Charlie/Shalini out of the crowd. == Cast == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:30%;\" ! Actor !! Role (Telugu) !!

A middling performer of an album, this. The vocals sound new with exceptions.\" Sharanya CR from The Times of India reviewed that \"Except for two songs, Harris doesn\u2019t really up the magic quotient for SPYder.\" 123Telugu gave a positive verdict stating that \"Fans and music lovers expect a good music album from star heroes films. As it\u2019s a Mahesh Babu film, the expectations were quite high on Spyder\u2019s audio album. Harris Jayaraj, who is back to Tollywood after a short gap, has tried to live up to the sky high expectations. Spyder\u2019s songs have a good quality of music. While the first, second and the fourth song in the album are a treat for class audiences, the third song is a pucca folk song. Overall, Spyder\u2019s audio album will attract the class audience and stands as a different album in Mahesh\u2019s career.\" Moviecrow rated the album 3 out of 5 stating that \"Harris Jayaraj delivers an engaging album filled with the composer\u2019s signature sounds throughout the soundtrack.\" ==Release== During the film's pre-production phase, it was announced that the film releases on 23 June 2017.

Apart from these minor issues, Spyder will entertain you if you are an action film lover\" and gave a verdict \"A high- power action entertainer with an extremely menacing villain to spice up the occasion.\" The Hindu stated that \"Spyder starts off well but the director\u2019s imagination goes overboard only to turn a purpose ridden plot to a piece of travesty.\" In a positive note 123Telugu rated 3.25 out of 5, and summarised that \"On the whole, Spyder is a decent action thriller which has some very interesting moments. Mahesh Babu\u2019s rocking performance and Surya\u2019s menacing act will surely impress you. But as the film has a routine and serious storyline, the class audience will lap it up but the mass audience might find it a bit difficult to digest. Also, the climax is weak and hurried up. If you are okay with the above-said things, then Spyder will entertain you this weekend.\" ==== Tamil version ==== M. Suganth of The Times of India rated 2 out of 5, stating that \"The writing lets Spyder down entirely after a point and, unlike Thuppakki (which was also about a man trying to save and a man trying to destroy), what should have been an edge-of-the-seat cat-and-mouse game between good and evil turns into a movie that cannot decide between wanting to be a crackling thriller and an anything-goes masala movie.\" India Today rated 2 out of 5, and summarised it as \"The core of Spyder seems to have been written for Telugu audience. Even for them, Spyder isn't a satisfying star vehicle. Or Maybe Spyder isn't what Murugadoss imagined on paper. Because, some scenes, even on paper, appear to be pompous. Consider the scene from the second half of 7am Arivu and you'll understand better.\" and concluded with \"Spyder looks to be passionate on many levels. But very little translates on- screen.\" Behindwoods rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and stated that \"SJ Suryah's performance and AR Murugadoss' touch makes Spyder a decent thriller.\" Indiaglitz rated the film 2.5 out of 5 and stated \"Watch SPYder for Mahesh's genuine efforts and SJ Surya\u2019s gritty performance. If you are looking for a fitting duel between the hero and villain you might get disappointed for the film shines only on their respective characters and is let down when it comes to their duel.\" International Business Times rated 3 out of 5 and stated that \"Spyder stands out as an enjoyable entertainer despite its flaws.\" Baradwaj Rangan of Film Companion called \" this film is a pretty decent god-vs-demon tale, with a solid hero and a spectacular villain\" in his review. === Box- office === The film grossed 24 crore on the first day of its release, with a share of 15.6 crore in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. On its opening day, the film saw more than 95% occupancy in theatres and managed to collect 51 crore gross on its first day at global box-office and it is said to have collected 1.30 crore in two days in Chennai alone.
