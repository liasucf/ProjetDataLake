Learning of Santa Anna's men at Huamantla, Lane left his train under guard and marched toward that city, Captain Samuel H. Walker's four companies of cavalry in the lead. ==Battle== Walker charged, upon seeing Santa Anna's lancers, driving the Mexicans from the town. Santa Anna led a counterattack, Walker was shot by a civilian in a nearby house, and his men retreated into a church. The Mexicans then retreated to Quer\u00e9taro. Lane turned his troops loose in a drunken sack of the town. They reached Puebla on 12 Oct. to lift the siege. ==See also== * Battles of the Mexican\u2013American War ==Order of battle== ===United States=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=25% | Brigade !
