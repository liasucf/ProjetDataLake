    "text": "The Treaty of Plessis-les-Tours was signed on 29 September 1580 between the Dutch Staten Generaal (with the exception of Zeeland and Holland) and Fran\u00e7ois, Duke of Anjou (supported by William the Silent). Based on the terms of the treaty, Fran\u00e7ois assumed the title of \"Protector of the Liberty of the Netherlands\" and became sovereign of the Dutch Republic. The accord was ratified at Bordeaux on 23 January 1581. When Fran\u00e7ois attempted to take Antwerp in the French Fury on 17 January 1583, the citizens massacred his army. He withdrew from the Low Countries in June and died of malaria the following year. ==See also== *List of treaties ==External links== *The Rise of the Dutch Republic - John Lothrop Motley Plessis Category:1580 in the Dutch Republic Category:1581 in the Dutch Republic Category:1580 treaties Category:1581 treaties ",
