    "text": "The French Rugby Federation ( (FFR)) is the governing body for rugby union in France. It is responsible for the French national team and the Ligue nationale de rugby that administers the country's professional leagues. ==History== It was formed in 1919 and is affiliated to World Rugby, the sport's governing body. In 1934 the FFR set up the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration internationale de rugby amateur, now known as Rugby Europe, in an attempt to organise rugby union outside the authority of World Rugby, then known as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB). It included the national teams of Italy, French national team, Catalonia, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Germany national team. Following German occupation, FFR officials closely associated with the Vichy government lobbied to have certain \"un-French\" sports banned. Between the end of 1940 and the middle of 1942, one semi-professional and at least six French Amateur Sport Federations were banned and destroyed by the Vichy regime.Badge of dishonour: French rugby's shameful secret from The Independent, 6 September 2007, retrieved 21 March 2015 These actions were independently verified by the French government in 2002. In 1978 the Federation became a member of the IRFB, which later became the International Rugby Board and is now World Rugby. ==Presidents== * Bernard Lapasset (1991\u20132008) * Pierre Camou (2008\u20132016) * Bernard Laporte (2016\u2013present) ==See also== * France national rugby union team * Ligue Nationale de Rugby * List of rugby union clubs in France ==References== ==External links== * Official site Rugby Category:Rugby union governing bodies in Europe Category:World Rugby members Category:Sports organizations established in 1919 Category:1919 establishments in France ",
