Right now, he creates anarchy & irregularity in the country, so, the King appoints Chief Commander Veera Mohan (N. T. Rama Rao) to dump out the turbulence. At present, Veera Mohan awakes the valor in public and makes them wear warrior bands Veerakankanam as a symbol. During that crunch, Rajaguru gets back Chandrasena to the fort when he tries to trap princess Rajani (Krishna Kumari) and sends a love letter. But unfortunately, it goes into the hands of Parvathi (Jamuna) daughter of Maha Mantri (K.V.S.Sarma) and starts loving him. Meanwhile, Veera Mohan & Rajani fall for each other. Eventually, Veera Mohan recognizes Chandrasena as the viper and stands him as a victim before the court. Here, the King empowers the verdict to Maha Mantri who gives death sentence to him. To protect her love Parvathi makes a play by speaking in the voice of a goddess, standing behind the statue and proclaims Chandrasena as innocent. Ultimately, the King too believes it and acquits Chandrasena. Simultaneously, Veera Mohan is affirmed as a traitor and ostracized from the kingdom when Rajani also accompanies him. Thereafter, Chandrasena marries Parvathi when she realizes the nefarious face of her husband. At that point in time, Chandrasena captures Rajani and tries to molest her. Learning it, Parvathi lands and being necessitated she slays him out. At the same time, Rajaguru tries to kill the King when Veera Mohan in disguise saves him, but Rajaguru cleverly throws the blame on Veera Mohan and he is accused.
