    "text": "Use Once and Destroy is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Superjoint Ritual. The guitar and bass work was done by Phil Anselmo and Eyehategod's Jimmy Bower. Drumming was performed by Joe Fazzio. For touring bass duties, Superjoint Ritual recruited Hank Williams III. Anselmo did not want to play bass live because he wanted to focus mainly on singing. Use Once and Destroy is a slightly different approach to music than the work of Pantera, one of Anselmo's other bands. The album was re-released in 2006 through Sanctuary / Mayan Records, featuring bonus tracks. ==Music videos== \"Fuck Your Enemy\" had a music video, directed by Jim Van Bebber. With its short song length, it found considerable airplay on Uranium throughout 2003. The black & white video begins by passing a door with a sign that reads \"Hippies use side door.\" It then features the band performing in a small room with its walls covered in music posters and logos. Brief shots have the band humorously playing air guitar and drums before reverting to actual instrument performance footage. The song title would be censored as \"F*** Your Enemy\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Superjoint Ritual *Phil Anselmo \u2013 vocals, guitars, bass *Jimmy Bower \u2013 guitars, bass *Joe Fazzio \u2013 drums ;Production *Dave Fortman \u2013 engineering, mixing, producer *Mark Casselman \u2013 mastering *Joe Fazzio \u2013 artwork, design *Keith Neltner \u2013 design *Neil Zlozower \u2013 photography ==Chart positions== Album - Billboard (North America) {| border=1 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2 !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Year !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Chart !align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Position |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2002 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|The Billboard 200 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|87 |- |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|2002 |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|Top Independent Albums |align=\"left\" valign=\"top\"|5 |} ==References== Category:2002 debut albums Category:Superjoint albums Category:Sanctuary Records albums ",
