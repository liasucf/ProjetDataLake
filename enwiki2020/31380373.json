    "text": "Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Mendoza (1390 - 23 December 1473) was the second Admiral of Castile, Count of Melgar and Rueda, and second Lord of Medina del Rioseco. He was a son of Alonso Enr\u00edquez, the first admiral of Castile. == 1426-1445 == Fadrique's father, Alonso Enr\u00edquez, was the son of Fadrique, an illegitimate child of Alfonso XI of Castile. The Enr\u00edquez family was an important family because of this descent from the royal line and their many possessions in Castile. When his father died in 1429, Alonso Fadrique inherited his estate and titles, including ricohombre, Master of Order of Santiago, lord of Medina de Rioseco, Castro Verde and Torrelobat\u00f3n. According to his contemporary Hernando del Pulgar (1436\u20131492), he was small in stature, a little nearsighted, and he gained much honor and fame with his performance as commander of the fleet of Castile.Fernando del Pulgar, Claros varones de Castilla Fadrique played an important role at court as one of the main advisers of King John II of Castile. He became involved in the conspiracy against the influential Constable of Castile \u00c1lvaro de Luna. In 1426, Fadrique Enr\u00edquez married Mariana Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba y Ayala, 4th Lady of Casarrubios (1385\u20131431). In 1425, Mariana gave birth to a daughter, Juana, Queen of Aragon. In 1431, he and Alvaro de Luna arrested Commander Diego Sarmiento because the latter did not obey the orders of the king. In the same year, his wife Mariana died. In 1432, he fought alongside Pedro Manrique de Lara against the princes Henry and Peter near C\u00e1ceres, Alburquerque and Acagala. On May 9, 1432, Fadrique married his second wife, Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de Qui\u00f1ones, with whom he had nine children. In 1437, when King John II of Castile had Pedro Manrique arrested, Fadrique came into conflict with the king. In August 1438, Pedro managed to escape from his prison in Fuentedue\u00f1as. Fadrique gathered troops in Medina de Rioseco to rebel against the king. John II of Castile also brought together his supporters, including Alvaro de Luna, his son Henry, Pero de Velasco, the Count of Haro, Diego G\u00f3mez de Sandoval and others. In 1440, negotiations were held and a temporary truce was agreed on. During this short period of peace, Henry married Blanche II of Navarre, and Fadrique was godfather of the couple. == 1445-1473 == In 1445, Fadrique again participated in an alliance against Alvaro de Luna. The admiral was captured but managed to escape to Medina de Rioseco. In 1448, Fadrique was accused of a conspiracy against the king and a plot to murder \u00c1lvaro de Luna. Fadrique fled again, went to Aragon to seek support and thence to Italy, where Alfonso V, king of Aragon was at the time. In 1449, an alliance against \u00c1lvaro de Luna was again forged. This time, Fadrique joined forces with John II, king of Navarre. In 1447, John II of Castile had married Isabella of Portugal. The new queen soon made short shrift of the influential nobles at court. \u00c1lvaro was arrested on April 4, 1453, and sentenced to death. He was beheaded on June 2, 1453. John II of Castile died in July 1454 and was succeeded by Henry IV. A new series of intrigues at the court of Castile began, and Fadrique again played a role. Fadrique Enr\u00edquez de Mendoza died in 1473 and was buried in the monastery of Our Lady of Hope of Valdescopezo in Medina de Rioseco. == Issue == With Mariana Fern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba y Ayala: * Juana Enr\u00edquez, later Queen of Aragon and mother of Ferdinand II of Aragon With Teresa Fern\u00e1ndez de Qui\u00f1ones: * Alonso Enr\u00edquez (1435-1485), 3rd Admiral of Castile * Pedro, fourth Adelantado Mayor of Andalusia (? - 1492) * Enrique Enr\u00edquez (? - 1504), major-domo mayor del rey, lord of Orso.
