It is the site of the ancient church and holy well of St. Mary\u2019s which stands on Bryn Glas Hill overlooking the River Lugg, as it makes its way to Presteigne. ==Name== The earliest reference to Pilleth is in the Domesday Book, where it is noted as Pilelei. There are various explanations as to the origins of the name:Pilleth Radnor Forest Valleys Association *Pwll-y-Llethr \u2013 translated from Welsh to The Pit on the Slope, which could refer to the healing well of the church of St. Mary *Pill Lledd \u2013 translated to The Wide Refuge which could refer to a tunnel from the monastery at Monaughty to the well ==Well and the church== St Mary's Church, Pilleth It is thought by historians that Pilleth has been a place of worship since the foundations of the early Celtic Christian church. People would make pilgrimages to the holy well, reputed to have healing properties for the eyes in particular. The church was much frequented in the Middle Ages, with the current structure dating mainly from the 13th century, the tower from the 14th century, and its single bell from circa 1450. The church was greatly damaged during the 1402 battle, and a fire in 1894 destroyed much of the ancient woodwork, with surviving items transferred to other local churches. As a result of new cottages being built, the village began to grow again in late Victorian times to a population of over 100.Population figures for Pilleth parish Victorian Powys In 1909 Edward Whitehead, a London lawyer resident in Nant-y-Groes, engaged Sir Walter Tapper who installed a temporary roof and the stone steps on the southern side.

A major programme of restoration was undertaken in 2002-2004, partly funded by a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and with support from the European Regional Development Fund.
