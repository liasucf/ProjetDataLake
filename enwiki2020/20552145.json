    "text": "__NOTOC__ Henrique \"Rico\" S. Malvar (born 1957) is a distinguished Brazilian engineer and a senior signal processing researcher at Microsoft Research's largest laboratory in Redmond, Washington, United States. He was the Managing Director of the lab following the departure of long-time Managing Director Dan Ling in 2007, and oversaw about 350 researchers. Currently, he is the Chief Scientist of Microsoft Research. == History and contributions == Malvar earned his bachelor's degree at the University of Bras\u00edlia and his master's degree at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. He received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1986, where his thesis was on \"Optimal pre- and post- filtering in noisy sampled-data systems,\"H. S. Malvar. Optimal pre- and post- filtering in noisy sampled-data systems. Ph.D. thesis. Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Mass, USA. September 1986. and served as a visiting professor at MIT for the next year. From 1979 to 1993, Malvar was a faculty member at the University of Bras\u00edlia, where he founded and headed the Digital Signal Processing Research Group (in Portuguese, Grupo de Processamento Digital de Sinais or GPDS). In industry, Malvar served as vice president of Research and Advanced Technology at PictureTel from 1985 to 1987 (which has since been acquired by Polycom). In Fall 1997, he joined Microsoft Research where he co-founded and managed the Signal Processing research group, now the Communication and Collaboration Systems and Knowledge Tools groups. He was a Redmond lab director from 2004 to 2007 before stepping up to become Managing Director. In 2010 he took on a new position of Chief Scientist, working on cross-labs strategic projects. Currently, he leads the Microsoft Research Enable group, which develops technologies to help people with disabilities. At Microsoft, Malvar contributed to the development of audio coding and digital rights management for the Windows Media Audio, Windows Media Video, and to image compression technologies, such as HD Photo / JPEG XR formats and the RemoteFX bitmap compression, as well as to a variety of tools for signal analysis and synthesis. As of December 2017, he has published over 160 technical articles and has been issued over 120 patents. == Editorial and committee positions == Malvar has served as an editor or committee member for the following journals, conferences, and organizations: * Associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing * Editorial board of Applied and Computational Harmonic Analysis * Technical committee for the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP) * Technical committee for the Data Compression Conference (DCC) * Advisory committee for the National Science Foundation Directorate for Computer & Information Science & Engineering == Titles and awards == Malvar holds the following prestigious titles and awards. A sample: * 1981: The Young Scientist Award from the Marconi International Fellowship Foundation * 1992: Best Paper Award in Image Processing from the IEEE Signal Processing Society * 1997: Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) * 2002: Technical Achievement Award from the IEEE Signal Processing Society * 2004: Wavelet Pioneer Award from SPIE * 2006: Distinguished Engineer at Microsoft. * 2012: Member of the US National Academy of Engineering (NAE). * 2014: 20th Century Landmark Award, IEEE Seattle Section. == References == == External links == * Bill Hinchberger. * Marcela Heitor. * Anais Fernandes. \"Ler pensamentos \u00e9 algo que n\u00e3o est\u00e1 longe.
