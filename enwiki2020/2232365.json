    "text": "Dynasty is the seventh studio album by the American rock band Kiss, produced by Vini Poncia and released by Casablanca Records on May 23, 1979. It was the first time that the four original members of Kiss did not all appear together for the entire album. ==Album information== The album and the following tour were billed as the \"Return of Kiss\". Kiss had not released a studio album since Love Gun in 1977. Instead, the band released their second live album, Alive II, and each member had recorded eponymous solo albums, which were simultaneously released on September 18, 1978. After pre-production and rehearsals were completed, Vini Poncia (who had produced Peter Criss), decided that Criss' drumming was substandard, an opinion shared by Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons. Criss was hindered by injuries to his hands that he had suffered in a 1978 car accident. Kiss hired the South African-born studio drummer Anton Fig, who played on Ace Frehley, to play on the Dynasty sessions. \"On Dynasty, Peter was pretty much out of commission through drugs and alcohol, and he was not being nice to most people. I wouldn't point to it as a classic Kiss album.\"Kitts, Jeff: \"Back in black (and white)\", Guitar World, September 1996, p68 With the exception of his song \"Dirty Livin' \", a rewrite of a song of the same title demoed during his pre-Kiss days in Lips, Criss does not play drums on the album, and he did not perform on another Kiss album until Psycho Circus in 1998, on which he again only played on one song. Fig was again hired to replace Criss during recording sessions for the following album, Unmasked. Eric Carr was hired as Criss' permanent replacement before the Unmasked Tour began. Frehley, who himself left the band three years later, sings three songs on Dynasty: \"Hard Times\", \"Save Your Love\" and a cover version of the Rolling Stones' song \"2000 Man\". Although he had frequently sung backing vocals and had written the Kiss classics \"Cold Gin\" and \"Parasite\", Frehley had only previously been lead singer on his songs \"Shock Me\" on Love Gun, and \"Rocket Ride\" on the studio side of Alive II, as he lacked confidence in his ability as a lead singer. Stanley's \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" was one of the band's most successful singles, peaking at #11 on the American singles chart. In eleven countries around the world it reached the #1 spot or 2nd position. He also sang on \"Sure Know Something\" and \"Magic Touch\". In contrast, Simmons sings lead vocals on only two songs, \"Charisma\" (which became a minor hit in Mexico) and \"X-Ray Eyes\". The album includes a colorful jacket cover which is actually a collage of photos taken from the photo session and not a group shot as it appears. The label shows a portrait of all four members instead of the usual Casablanca label. Inserts included a merchandise order form and a full- color poster. ==Tour== The Dynasty Tour ran in the second half of 1979 and was Kiss' most expensive. It was their first tour since the Alive II tour ended on April 2, 1978, in Japan. Kiss sported new costumes with colors that coincided with the colors of their respective solo albums: purple (Stanley), red (Simmons), blue (Frehley) and green (Criss). The new production had Simmons being hoisted to a small stage atop the scaffolding during his bass guitar solo (typically played before \"God of Thunder\"). The harness malfunctioned on several occasions. Frehley was similarly elevated for his guitar solo and the tour was the first to feature his \"light-guitar\" and his rocket-shooting stunt. A trick was designed for Stanley that involved him putting on a headset and shooting a laser out of his right eye (to mimic the effect seen in Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park a year before). After several run-throughs both Stanley and Bill Aucoin canceled the idea, citing the danger involved to both him and the fans. The tour saw a decline in audience. Shows at Madison Square Garden and the Pontiac Silverdome were canceled, while an additional night at the Los Angeles Forum was moved to the 10,000-capacity Anaheim Convention Center. The last concert with all the original members took place at the Toledo Sports Arena, in Toledo, Ohio, on December 16, 1979. The tour was considered a financial failure in the USA. But throughout Europe and Australia with Eric sitting behind the drums in the Fox makeup., KISS were huge & the band overseas became Known as SUPERKISS. the original band didn\u2019t get back together until the 1996 Reunion Tour sixteen years later. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Paul Stanley \u2013 vocals, rhythm guitar, bass on \"I Was Made for Lovin' You\", lead guitar on \"Sure Know Something\" and \"Magic Touch\" *Gene Simmons \u2013 vocals, bass, rhythm guitar on \"X-Ray Eyes\" *Ace Frehley \u2013 vocals, lead guitar, all guitars and bass on \"2,000 Man\", \"Hard Times\" and \"Save Your Love\" *Peter Criss \u2013 drums and lead vocals on \"Dirty Livin' \" ;Additional musicians *Anton Fig \u2013 drums (except on \"Dirty Livin' \") *Vini Poncia \u2013 producer, percussion, backing vocals, keyboards ;Production *Jon Mathias \u2013 engineer *Jim Galante \u2013 engineer *Jay Messina \u2013 mixing *George Marino \u2013 mastering engineer ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"|Chart (1979) !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |Australian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |Austrian Albums ChartKISS - Dynasty - swisscharts.com |align=\"center\"|13 |- |Canadian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|6 |- |Dutch Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|1 |- |align=\"left\"|Finnish Albums Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|27 |- |French Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |German Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|8 |- |Italian Albums ChartHit Parade Italia \u2013 ALBUM 1979 |align=\"center\"|16 |- |Japanese Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|21 |- |New Zealand Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|2 |- |Norwegian Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|34 |- |Swedish Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|17 |- |Swiss Albums Chart |align=\"center\"|13 |- |UK Albums ChartKISS | full Official Chart History | Official Charts Company |align=\"center\"|50 |- | US Billboard Pop Albums |align=\"center\"|9 |} ;Singles {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !Country !Single !Chart !Position |- |rowspan=\"17\"|1979 |rowspan=\"2\"|United States |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Billboard Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |\"Sure Know Something\" |Billboard Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|47 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Australia |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |\"Sure Know Something\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|5 |- |Austria |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Canada |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |\"Sure Know Something\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|48 |- |France |rowspan=\"2\"|\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text- align:center;\"|2 |- |Germany |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|The Netherlands |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |\"Sure Know Something\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|3 |- |Norway |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|10 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|New Zealand |\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |- |\"Sure Know Something\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |- |Sweden |rowspan=\"3\"|\"I Was Made for Lovin' You\" |Pop Singles | style=\"text- align:center;\"|19 |- |Switzerland |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|2 |- |United Kingdom |Pop Singles | style=\"text-align:center;\"|50 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:Kiss (band) albums Category:1979 albums Category:Albums produced by Vini Poncia Category:Casablanca Records albums Category:Albums recorded at Electric Lady Studios Category:Disco albums by American artists ",
