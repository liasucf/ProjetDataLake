    "text": "The Ranger Bridge (officially Veterans Memorial Bridge) between Wells River, Vermont and Woodsville, New Hampshire, is a three-hinged steel arch truss bridge over the Connecticut River. It was built in 1923 to replace a 1917 bridge. This is the oldest steel arch bridge over the Connecticut River. ==History== The Wells River Bridge was built in 1903 to carry rail and road traffic. In 1917, the road traffic was rerouted over a new bridge, a three- span Warren deck truss designed by John W. Storrs, just downstream, called the Ranger Bridge, for around $65,000 (US$ with inflation). A flood undermined and destroyed this bridge in 1922. J. R. Worcester designed the next bridge, which was built by the Boston Bridge Company, the same combination of designer and builder which made the Arch Bridge in Bellows Falls 18 years earlier. The current bridge was completed in 1923 as a three-hinged steel arch bridge. It was rehabilitated in 2001\u20133. This is the oldest steel arch bridge over the Connecticut River. ==See also== * * * * List of crossings of the Connecticut River ==References== ==External links== Category:Bridges over the Connecticut River Category:Woodsville, New Hampshire Category:Wells River, Vermont Category:Bridges completed in 1917 Category:Bridges completed in 1923 Category:Bridges in Grafton County, New Hampshire Category:Bridges in Orange County, Vermont Category:Road bridges in New Hampshire Category:Road bridges in Vermont Category:U.S. Route 2 Category:Bridges on the United States Numbered Highways Category:Through arch bridges in the United States Category:Steel bridges in the United States Category:1917 establishments in New Hampshire Category:Buildings and structures in Newbury, Vermont Category:Interstate vehicle bridges in the United States ",
