    "text": "World War I poster in the Library of Congress The term comrade is used to mean 'mate', 'colleague', or 'ally', and derives from the Spanish term ,Camarade - Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise literally meaning 'chamber mate', from Latin , meaning 'chamber' or 'room'. Political use of the term was inspired by the French Revolution, after which it grew into a form of address between socialists and workers. Since the Bolshevik Revolution, popular culture in the Western World has often associated it with communism. However, the term comrade is improperly attributed to Russian speakers, since Russians do not say comrade, but rather (). == Background == Upon abolishing the titles of nobility in France, and the terms and (literally, 'my lord' and 'my lady'), the revolutionaries employed the term for men and for women (both meaning 'citizen') to refer to each other. The deposed King Louis XVI, for instance, was referred to as to emphasize his loss of privilege. When the socialist movement gained momentum in the mid-19th century, socialists elsewhere began to look for a similar egalitarian alternative to terms like \"Mister\", \"Miss\", or \"Missus\". In German, the word had long been used as an affectionate form of address among people linked by some strong common interest, such as a sport, a college, a profession (notably as a soldier), or simply friendship. The term was often used with political overtones in the revolutions of 1848, and was subsequently borrowed by French and English. In English, the first known use of the word comrade with this meaning was in 1884 in the socialist magazine Justice. == Russian and Soviet usage == In the late 19th century Russian Marxists and other leftist revolutionaries adopted as a translation of the word the Russian word for () (from Old Turkic ; abbreviated ), whose original meaning was \"business companion\" or \"travel (or other adventure) mate\", deriving from the noun (, 'merchandise').Anrede \"Genosse\" nicht mehr zeitgem\u00e4\u00df as a form of address in international (especially German) social democracy and in the associated parts of the labour movement. For instance, one might be referred to as or Chairman, or simply as . After the Russian Revolution, translations of the term in different languages were adopted by communists worldwide. However, due to its common usage in portrayals of the Soviet Union in Cold War films and books, the term became most strongly associated in public consciousness with communism as known in the Soviet Union, even though many other socialists would continue to use Comrade among themselves (e.g., German and Austrian social-democrats and, to this day, members of the British Labour Party). In the early years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks used when addressing or referring to people assumed sympathetic to the revolution and to the Soviet state, such as members of the Communist party (and originally of other pro-revolution leftist formations such as the Left Socialist- Revolutionaries) and people from the \"working masses\". The more neutral republican form of address would translate as Citizen. Accordingly, supporters of the White movement in the Russian Civil War would use mockingly as a derogatory term for their enemies \u2013 although at the same time, the various socialist anti-Bolshevik forces such as the Socialist Revolutionary Party and the Mensheviks also used among themselves. By the mid-1920s, the form of address became so commonplace in the Soviet Union that it was used indiscriminately in essentially the same way as terms like \"Mister\" and \"Sir\" are employed in English. That use persisted until the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Still, the original meaning partly re-surfaced in some contexts: criminals and suspects were only addressed as \"citizens\" and not as , and expressly refusing to address someone as would generally be perceived as a hostile act or, in Stalinist times, even as an accusation of being \"Anti- Soviet\". The term Comrade is not used in Russian society, and the term is not often used in contemporary society, but it is still the standard form of address in the Russian Armed Forces and Police of Russia, where officers and soldiers are normally addressed as Colonel, General, Sergeant, or the like. The term is also used as part of idioms, for example: ('fellow-sufferer', from German ) or ([war] buddy), or as a part of such words as (partnership) that do not associate with communism. == Chinese usage == In Chinese, the translation of comrade is (), literally meaning '(people with) the same spirit, goal, ambition, etc.'. It was first introduced in the political sense by Sun Yat-sen to refer to his followers. The (Nationalist Party), which was co-founded by Sun Yat-Sen, has a long tradition of using this term to refer to its members, usually as a noun rather than a title; for example, a KMT member would say \"Mr. Chang is a loyal and reliable comrade ().\"See, for example, the remarks of Frank Hsieh after losing the Republic of China presidential election in 2008: \u51dd\u805a\u9ee8\u5167\u5718\u7d50 \u8b1d\u9577\u5ef7\uff1a\u6211\u6c7a\u5b9a\u7559\u5230\u4e94\u4e8c\u4e94 : \"\u5f88\u591a\u540c\u5fd7\u5e0c\u671b\u6211\u80fd\u5920\u7559\u5230\u4e94\u6708\u4e8c\u5341\u4e94\u65e5\" (\"Many comrades hoped that I could stay to May 25\". See \u4e2d\u570b\u570b\u6c11\u9ee8\u7b2c17\u5c46\u4e2d\u592e\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7b2c2\u6b21\u5168\u9ad4\u6703\u8b70\u51fa\u3001\u5217\u5e2d\u540c\u5fd7\u767c\u8a00\u9808\u77e5 (\"Rules for speaking for attending comrades at the 2nd plenary meeting of the 17th central committee of the Chinese Kuomintang\") for an example of its usage in the Kuomintang. Nevertheless, the term was promoted most actively by the Communist Party of China during its struggle for power. It was used both as a noun and as a title for basically anyone in mainland China after the People's Republic of China was founded. For example, women were ('female comrade'), children were ('little comrade') and seniors were ('old comrade'). However, after the 1980s and the onset of China's market-oriented reforms, this term has been moving out of such daily usage. It remains in use as a respectful term of public address among middle-aged Chinese and members of the Communist Party of China. Within the Communist Party, failure to address a fellow member as is seen as a subtle but unmistakable sign of disrespect and enmity. At party or civil meetings, the usage of the term has been retained. Officials often address each other as , and thus the usage here is not limited to Communist Party members alone. In addition, is the term of preference to address any national leader when their titles are not attached (e.g., Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Deng Xiaoping). In October 2016, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive urging all 90 million party members to keep calling each other \"comrades\" instead of less egalitarian terms. It is also in the regulations of the Chinese Armed Forces as one of three appropriate ways to formally address another member of the military (\"comrade\" plus rank or position, as in \"Comrade Colonel\", or simply \"comrade/s\" when lacking information about the person's rank, or talking to several servicepeople.) The SAR territories of Hong Kong and Macau generally use as a catch-all term to refer to members of the LGBT community; its use as a word for \"comrade\" has historically been uncommon due to both territories formerly being under foreign administrations. This definition of is becoming increasingly popular among mainland Chinese youth and a growing number of older Chinese people have stopped using due to its new association with the LGBT community. == South African usage == During the 1970s and 1980s, comrade emerged as a popular revolutionary form of address in South Africa among those involved in anti-apartheid political activities. For example, members of the African National Congress and South African Communist Party frequently referred to each other as comrade. Among poor residents of the country's segregated townships, it was also used to specifically denote members of militant youth organisations. These radical activists led consumer boycotts, organised anti-apartheid rallies and demonstrations, and intimidated those suspected of having ties to the South African government or security forces. In this particular context, the English title comrades was also used interchangeably with the Xhosa term . ==Zimbabwean usage== In Zimbabwe, the term is used for persons affiliated with the ZANU (PF) political party. The state media also use Cde as short for comrade. Members of other political parties mainly the Movement for Democratic Change are often referred by their names or Mr, Mrs or Prof. The revived Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU) members also call themselves comrades. == South Sudanese usage == Members of the Sudan People's Liberation Army call each other 'Comrade'. == Internet Culture usage == As aforementioned, the usage of the word comrade has resurfaced within internet culture. References to usage of \"Comrade\" can be connected with commentary upon communism and communistic symbols. == British Fascist Usage == The British Union of Fascists used the word commonly to refer to members, which was controversial. The Marching Song, set to the music of the began 'Comrades, the voices'. The writer, E.D. Randall, defended the usage of the word by stating that 'comrades' \u2018fittingly and completely expresses the ideal of unity in the service of a common cause\u2019 == In other languages == *In Albanian, the word (meaning friend, from Latin ) was used within communist circles. *The Arabic word () (meaning comrade, companion) is used in Arabic, Urdu and Persian with the same political connotation as \"comrade.\" The term is used both among Arab communists as well as within the Ba'ath movement and the Lebanese Forces.
