    "text": "RWJ-394674 is a drug that is used in scientific research. It is a potent, orally active analgesic drug that produces little respiratory depression. RWJ-394674 itself is a potent and selective agonist for \u03b4-opioid receptors, with a Ki of 0.24 nM at \u03b4 and 72 nM at \u03bc. However once inside the body, RWJ-394674 is dealkylated to its monodesethyl metabolite RWJ-413216, which is a potent agonist at the \u03bc-opioid receptor and has less affinity for \u03b4 (Ki 0.26 nM at \u03bc, 46.7 nM at \u03b4). The effect of RWJ-394674 when administered in vivo thus produces potent agonist effects at both \u03bc and \u03b4 receptors through the combined actions of the parent drug and its active metabolite, with the \u03b4-agonist effects counteracting the respiratory depression from the \u03bc-opioid effects, and the only prominent side-effect being sedation. == References == Category:Opioids Category:Delta-opioid agonists Category:Tropanes Category:Benzamides Category:Mu-opioid agonists ",
