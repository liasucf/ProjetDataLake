    "text": "Franz Handlos (born 9 December 1939 in Rusel, Bavaria, died 10 June 2013) was a German right-wing politician. Handlos first came to prominence as member of the Christian Social Union of Bavaria (CSU), serving the party in both the Bundestag, where he represented Deggendorf, and the Landtag of Bavaria. Handlos, along with Ekkehard Voigt, represented the right of the party within the Bavarian CSU, with both men staunch critics of the leadership of Franz Josef Strauss. Handlos broke from the CSU in 1983 when Strauss agreed to accepting a major bank loan from East Germany, a move Handlos saw as accepting partition and helping to stabilise the communist state.D. Art, The Politics of the Nazi Past in Germany and Austria, Cambridge, 2006, p. 147 As a result of the split Handlos and Voigt joined with well-known political commentator and former CSU activist Franz Sch\u00f6nhuber to form their own party, Die Republikaner (REP) in 1983, with Handlos as the leader.Russell J. Dalton, Germany Divided: The 1994 Bundestag Elections and the Evolution of the German Party System, 1996, p. 134 Handlos saw the party as only slightly to the right of the CSU and aimed to REP as a basis to build a bundesweite (federal) version of the CSU, rather than simply concentrating on Bavaria.Cas Mudde, Ideology of the Extreme Right, 2002, p. 31 This view was not shared by Sch\u00f6nhuber, who had a more right-wing populist outlook and was inspired by the success of the French National Front. A bitter struggle for power ensued, with the radical wing winning out and in 1985 Handlos stood down as leader of the party and resigned his membership. Handlos formed his own Freiheitlichen Volkspartei and this group contested the 1986 Bavarian Landtag elections. However the new party gained only 0.4% of the vote, leaving Handlos on the fringes.Andreas Schulze, Kleinparteien in Deutschland, 2004, p. 104 ==References== Category:1939 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Christian Social Union in Bavaria politicians Category:The Republicans (Germany) politicians Category:Members of the Bundestag for Bavaria Category:Leaders of political parties in Germany Category:Members of the Landtag of Bavaria Category:Members of the Bundestag for the Christian Social Union in Bavaria ",
