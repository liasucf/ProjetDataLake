In the context of Pure Land practice, it generally refers to the repetition of the name of Amit\u0101bha. It is a translation of Sanskrit ' (or, \"recollection of the Buddha\"). == Indian Sanskrit Nianfo == The Sanskrit phrase used in India is not mentioned originally in the bodies of the two main Pure Land sutras. It appears in the opening of the extant Sanskrit Infinite Life Sutra, as well as the Contemplation Sutra, although it is a reverse rendering from Chinese, as the following: :namo'mit\u0101bh\u0101ya buddhaya The apostrophe and omission of the first \"A\" in \"Amit\u0101bha\" comes from normal Sanskrit sandhi transformation, and implies that the first \"A\" is omitted. A more accessible rendering might be: :Namo Amit\u0101bh\u0101ya Buddhaya A literal English translation would be \"Hail Buddha of Infinite Light\". The Sanskrit word-by-word pronunciation is the following; : While almost unknown, and unused outside of the original Sanskrit, the texts provide a recitation of Amit\u0101bha's alternate aspect of Amit\u0101yus as; : namo'mit\u0101yu\u1e63e buddhaya Again, a more accessible rendering might be; : Namo Amit\u0101yu\u1e63e Buddhaya A literal translation of this version would be \"Hail Buddha of Infinite Life\". : == Nianfo in various forms == The six Chinese characters of the Nembutsu, resting on a lotus, flanked by Sakyamuni and Amitabha As the practice of nianfo spread from India to various other regions, the original pronunciation changed to fit various native languages. {| class=\"wikitable\" !

The most common form of this is the six syllable nianfo; some shorten it into \u0112m\u00edtu\u00f3f\u00f3/\u0100m\u00edtu\u00f3f\u00f3.\u6de8\u696d\u6301\u540d\u56db\u5341\u516b\u6cd5 In the Japanese Jodo Shinshu sect, it is often shortened to na man da bu. === Nianfo variants === In the Jodo Shinshu tradition in Japan, variant forms of the nianfo have been used since its inception. The founder, Shinran, used a nine-character in the Shoshinge and the Sanamidabutsuge (\u8b83\u963f\u5f25\u9640\u4f5b\u5048) hymns: Further, the \"restorer\" of Jodo Shinshu, Rennyo, frequently inscribed the nianfo for followers using a 10-character (: The latter was originally popularized by Shinran's descendant (and Rennyo's ancestor), Kakunyo, but its use was greatly expanded by Rennyo. == Purpose of Nianfo == Mushono-Dainembutsu amulet paper Regarding Pure Land practice in Indian Buddhism, Hajime Nakamura writes that as described in the Pure Land s\u016btras from India, Mindfulness of the Buddha (Skt. buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti, Ch. nianfo) is the essential practice.Nakamura, Hajime. Indian Buddhism: A Survey with Bibliographical Notes. 1999. p. 205 These forms of mindfulness are essentially methods of meditating upon Amit\u0101bha Buddha. In the \u015a\u016bra\u1e45gama S\u016btra, the bodhisattva Mah\u0101sth\u0101mapr\u0101pta tells how the practice of nianfo enabled him to obtain sam\u0101dhi. In Chinese Buddhism, the nianfo is specifically taken as a subject of meditation and is often practiced while counting with Buddhist prayer beads.Wei-an Cheng (2000). Taming the monkey mind: a guide to pure land practice, translation with commentary by Elder Master Suddhisukha; New York: Sutra Translation Committee of the U.S. and Canada, pp. 18\u201319 In China, Pure Land and Chan Buddhism merged entirely by the Yuan dynasty. The modern Chan revitaliser Nan Huai-Chin taught that the nianfo is to be chanted slowly and the mind emptied out after each repetition. When idle thoughts arise, the nianfo is repeated again to clear them. With constant practice, the mind progressively empties and the meditator attains sam\u0101dhi.Yuan, Margaret. Grass Mountain: A Seven Day Intensive in Ch'an Training with Master Nan Huai- Chin. York Beach: Samuel Weiser, 1986 In most Pure Land traditions, mindfully chanting of the name of Amit\u0101bha is viewed as allowing one to obtain birth in Amit\u0101bha's pure land, Sukh\u0101vat\u012b. It is felt that this act would help to negate vast stores of negative karma that might hinder one's pursuit of buddhahood. Sukh\u0101vat\u012b is a place of refuge where one can become enlightened without being distracted by the sufferings of our existence. Various Pure Land schools in Japan have different interpretations of the nianfo, often based on faith in Amit\u0101bha rather than on meditation. In J\u014ddo Shinsh\u016b, the nianfo is reinterpreted as an expression of gratitude to Amit\u0101bha. The idea behind this is that rebirth into Sukh\u0101vat\u012b is assured the moment one first has faith in Amit\u0101bha. == Origins of the Nianfo == Andrew Skilton looks to an intermingling of Mah\u0101y\u0101na teachings with Buddhist meditation schools in Kashmir for the rise of Mah\u0101y\u0101na practices related to buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti: The earliest dated sutra describing the nianfo is the Pratyutpanna Sam\u0101dhi S\u016btra (first century BCE), which is thought to have originated in ancient kingdom of Gandh\u0101ra. This sutra does not enumerate any vows of Amit\u0101bha or the qualities of his pure land, Sukh\u0101vat\u012b, but rather briefly describes the repetition of the name of Amit\u0101bha as a means to enter his realm through meditation. Both the Infinite Life Sutra and the Amit\u0101bha S\u016btra subsequently included instructions for practicing buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti in this manner. However, it has not been determined which s\u016btra was composed first, and to what degree the practice of buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti had already been popularized in India. Buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti directed at other buddhas and bodhisattvas is also advocated in s\u016btras from this period, for figures such as Ak\u1e63obhya and Avalokite\u015bvara. The practice of buddh\u0101nusm\u1e5bti for Amit\u0101bha became very popular in India. With translations of the aforementioned s\u016btras as well as instruction from Indian monks, the practice rapidly spread to East Asia. ==Nembutsu-ban== A reprint of nembutsu (nianfo) calligraphy composed by Honen, founder of Pure Land Buddhism in Japan. Printed in a Jodo Shu liturgy book. The term nembutsu-ban is applied to the event in Kyoto, Japan in 1207 where H\u014dnen and his followers were banned from the city and forced into exile. This occurred when the leaders of older schools of Buddhism persuaded the civil authorities to prohibit the newer practices including the recitation of Namu Amida Butsu. The ban was lifted in 1211. == Nianfo in modern history == Th\u00edch Qu\u1ea3ng \u0110\u1ee9c, a South Vietnamese Mah\u0101y\u0101na monk who famously burned himself to death in an act of protest against the anti-Buddhist policies of the Catholic President Ngo Dinh Diem, said the nianfo as his last words immediately before death. He sat in the lotus position, rotated a string of wooden prayer beads, and recited the words \"Nam M\u00f4 A Di \u0110\u00e0 Ph\u1eadt\" before striking the match and dropping it on himself, continuing to recite Amitabha's name as he burnt. == References == == Bibliography == * Baskind, James (2008).
