    "text": "The Bassan tribe (Basan) of the Ijaw people lives in western Bayelsa State, Nigeria. Bassan settlements include: Ezetu (I and II), Koloama (I and II), Sangana, Foropah, Ukubie, Lubia, Azuzuama, Akparatubo, and Ekeni. Unlike other Ijaw tribes, the Bassan do not have a cultural tradition of common origin. It is believed that each of the villages that make up the clan were settled by separate migrations. As a result, no form of central authority developed among the Bassan. Some of the villages forged temporary alliances; others quarreled with each other over land and fishing rights.Alagoa, Ebiegberi Joe (2005).
