    "text": "Hedbergia is a monotypic genus of flowering plants, initially classified in Scrophulariaceae, and now within the broomrape family Orobanchaceae. It contains a unique species, Hedbergia abyssinica. It is an afromontane genus, widespread in grasslands and scrubs of the mountains of tropical Africa, and known from Ethiopia, Zaire, Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Malawi, Nigeria, and Cameroons. The genus name is a taxonomic patronym honoring the Swedish botanist Karl Olov Hedberg. == Description == Hedbergia abyssinica is a high, very hispid perennial plant, with subsessile thick leaves, and densely crowded, white to pink or magenta flowers. == Phylogeny == The phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. Hedbergia belongs to the core Rhinantheae. Hedbergia is closely related to Odontites, Bellardia, and Tozzia. In turn, these genera share phylogenetic affinities with Euphrasia, and then with Bartsia. == References == Category:Orobanchaceae genera Category:Plants described in 1988 Category:Parasitic plants ",
