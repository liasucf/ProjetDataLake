    "text": "The Member of Parliament for Ipswich in Suffolk, Jamie Cann, of the Labour Party died on 15 October 2001. The by-election was held on 22 November that year, and was the first of six by-elections which took place during the 53rd Parliament (2001\u201305). With Labour still basking in the glow of their landslide general election victory just five months earlier, no opposition party was able to mount an effective challenge. The Liberal Democrats improved their position somewhat but remained in third place, and the Labour candidate Chris Mole was returned with a majority of over 4,000 votes. The declaration broke with tradition by using live computer images, club music and lasers after the result was announced. ==June 2001 result== (June 2001 was a general election) ==References== ==External links== *British Parliamentary By Elections: Campaign literature from the by-election ==See also== *List of United Kingdom by-elections 2001 Category:2001 elections in the United Kingdom Category:2001 in England Category:21st century in Suffolk Category:November 2001 events in the United Kingdom ",
