The club began to play in the Mexican Third Division in the 1979\u201380 season reaching the finals where they faced \u00c1guilas de la UPAEP beating them and crowning themselves champions, thus earning the promotion to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n Profesional. The club played 2 years in the second division. In the first 1980\u201381 season, the club did not fare so well, it was in their second year 1981\u201382 when the club won the championship and the promotion to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico after defeating Club Tepic, managed by Edelmiro Arnauda. The club played its first professional game on September 3, 1982 in the Estadio Azteca against Club Am\u00e9rica which they lost 2\u20130. Starting Goalkeeper Ricardo La Volpe who had played for a number of Argentine and Mexican clubs retired that year. The club finished 4th in Group 3 with 32 points in 38 games played. In the 1983\u201384 season, now retired goalkeeper Ricardo La Volpe took over as head coach and let the club to a 4th-place finish in Group 4 with 33 points gained in 38 games. This marked the last year for the club which was sold and transferred to the city of Puebla, becoming \u00c1ngeles de Puebla. In a strange situation, the club started the 1984\u201385 season as Oaxtepec, but after the first match the time was sold to the Government of Puebla and rebranded as \u00c1ngeles de Puebla for round 2 of the season. This club played from 1984\u20131989 in Puebla later to be sold to Torre\u00f3n in 1989.
