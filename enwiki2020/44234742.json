In 2015, Valdary graduated magna cum laude from the University of New Orleans, earning a BA in international studies. ==Career== Valdary founded a pro-Israel student group, Allies of Israel, while a student at the University of New Orleans. Before 2015, she served as a Robert L. Bartley Fellow and Tikvah fellow under journalist and political commentator Bret Stephens at The Wall Street Journal. Valdary has written articles for The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Atlantic magazine. She also developed the conflict resolution program called the Theory of Enchantment, based on three main principles, namely (1) we are human beings, not political abstractions; (2) use criticism to uplift and empower, and not to tear down or destroy; and (3) lead with love and compassion.https://theoryofenchantment.com/ ==Social commentary== * On the rise of mental health challenges in America: \"A study found that one in five college students last year had suicidal thoughts, which is a significant new trend that we\u2019re dealing with in this country. The curriculum [Theory of Enchantment] aims to teach basic life skills relating to knowing oneself and knowing one\u2019s neighbor (or, \u201cThe Other\u201d, if you will). The essential idea is that you cannot really navigate the complexity of the world if you don\u2019t understand the complexity of your own self. What that means is being aware of everything that human beings deal with, like insecurities and parental baggage, and all the things that we have to navigate that are part of the human condition..\u201d * \"Even music is a text of sorts, right? So we can look at lyrics from Jay-Z or from other contemporary artists - even Lil Wayne has certain songs that would be relevant to healthy identity-formation. And so I thought, let\u2019s expand this canon, because what Shakespeare is saying in this piece, I heard in a song by Drake earlier this week. Think of people like W. E. B. Du Bois, who said, \u201cI sit with Shakespeare and he winces not,\u201d or Baldwin, who was very explicit about how the Western canon shaped and informed his ability to write.\" ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Activists from New Orleans Category:University of New Orleans alumni Category:21st-century African- American activists Category:American Christian Zionists Category:African- American writers Category:African-American women writers ",
