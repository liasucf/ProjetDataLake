    "text": "\"When the Lady Smiles\" is a 1984 song by Dutch band Golden Earring. It was the first single from their album N.E.W.S. (NorthEastWestSouth). Following their top 10 \"Twilight Zone\", \"When the Lady Smiles\" was a U.S. chart disappointment, only reaching #76 on The Billboard Hot 100 chart. With a total of 5 \"Hot 100\"-releases, Golden Earring are by far the most successful Dutch band on the international charts. Dutch actor Huub Stapel has a cameo in the music video as an elevator mechanic, referencing the movie De Lift. Also appearing in several scenes (metro car, window washer) is Hans Vandenburg, lead singer of Gruppo Sportivo. ==Controversy== The video for this song, shot by Dick Maas, was controversial. In one scene, a man attempts to rape a nun. This particular scene was quickly removed from the video (the full cut was only shown after midnight). The bold video may have hurt the sales of the single in the New World, although it climbed to the number 3 position in the charts in Canada. In the Netherlands \"When the Lady Smiles\" became Golden Earring's fifth number one. ==Hillary Clinton== Hillary Clinton used this song during her campaign for the US presidency of 2008, baffling the band given the song's lyrics and controversial video.Pauw&Witteman; 2008 ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1984) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |Dutch Top 40 |align=\"center\"|1 |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|76 |- |Canada |align=\"center\"|3 |- |Belgium Ultratop 50 |align=\"center\"|1 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1984 singles Category:Dutch Top 40 number-one singles Category:Songs written by George Kooymans Category:Songs written by Barry Hay Category:1984 songs Category:Golden Earring songs ",
