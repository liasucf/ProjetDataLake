    "text": "The Building at 417-419 Lee Street is a historic apartment building at 417-419 Lee Street in Evanston, Illinois. The two-story four-flat building was built in 1902. Architect Edgar O. Blake, an Evanston architect who had designed houses in the city since the 1870s, designed the building. The building's design includes a Georgian entrance with side columns, sidelights, and a fanlight, limestone banding, a wooden entablature, and a brick parapet. The four apartments are an early example of upper-class apartment design in Evanston; of particular note are its screened porches, which were a precursor to the sunrooms commonly seen in later buildings. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on March 15, 1984. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Illinois Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Buildings and structures in Evanston, Illinois Category:Apartment buildings in Illinois Category:Residential buildings completed in 1902 ",
