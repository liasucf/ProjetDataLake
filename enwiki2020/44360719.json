    "text": "The Neo-Concrete Movement (1959\u201361) was a Brazilian art movement, a group that splintered off from the larger Concrete Art movement prevalent in Latin America and in other parts of the world. The Neo-Concretes emerged from Rio de Janeiro\u2019s Grupo Frente. They rejected the pure rationalist approach of concrete art and embraced a more phenomenological and less scientific art. Ferreira Gullar inspired Neo-Concrete philosophy through his essay \u201cTheory of the Non-Object\u201d (1959) and wrote the \u201cNeo-Concrete Manifesto\u201d (1959) which outlines what Neo-Concrete art should be. Lygia Clark, H\u00e9lio Oiticica, and Lygia Pape were among the primary leaders of this movement. == Background == After World War One, Europe witnessed a boom of art movements based upon rationalism such as De Stijl and Bauhaus. Artists believed humanity would be able to achieve progress through its ability to reason. In Latin America, ideas of rationalist and non-objective art took root in the early 1950s in reaction to the muralism controversy. Governments such as the Mexican government utilized muralists to create propaganda. Under repressive Latin American governments, artists rebelled against the idea of aiding the political regime through figurative art; therefore geometric abstraction and concretism ushered in an art that did not connote anything political or have really any meaning at all. Concrete Art was able to flourish beneath these repressive regimes because it held no political messages or incendiary material. In Brazil, ideas of rationalist art and geometric abstraction arose in the early 1950s following the establishment of a democratic republic in 1946. The period from 1946 to 1964 is known as the Second Brazilian Republic.Flynn, Peter. Flynn, Peter. Nations of the Modern World, Brazil: A Political Analysis. Boulder: Westview Press, 1978. Groups such as Grupo Ruptura in Sao Paulo and Grupo Frente in Rio de Janeiro rose. Specifically Ruptura followed the ideal of pure mathematical art which does not connote meaning outside of what it is.Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Latin American and Caribbean Cultures. Ed. Daniel Balderston, Mike Gonzalez, and Ana M. Lopez. London: Routledge, 2002. 1032. The Neo-Concrete art movement arose when Grupo Frente realized that Concretism was \u201cna\u00efve and somewhat colonialist\u201d and an \u201coverly rational conception of abstract structure.\u201dBrett, Guy. \"Lygia Clark and Helio Oiticica.\" Latin American Artists of the Nineteenth Century. New York: The Museum of Modern Art, 1993. 101. In 1961 as the political tides began to turn, the Neo-Concrete artists disbanded no longer content to limit themselves to this one philosophy. Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica, leaders of the Neo-Concrete movement, put their energy into Conceptual Art. Art historians often refer to Neo-Concretism as the precursor to Conceptual Art because of the foundation of \u201cabstruse metaphysics.\u201d On April 1, 1964, a military coup removed Joao Goulart and established a military government in Brazil until 1985. The increase of violence called for a new kind of art that had the potential to carry meaning and deconstruct traditional thought even further. This came in the form of Conceptual Art. == The Neo-Concrete Manifesto and the push against Concretism == Brazilian poet and writer Ferreira Gullar wrote the Neo-Concrete Manifesto in 1959 and described a work of art as \u201csomething which amounts to more than the sum of its constituent elements; something which analysis may break down into various elements but which can only be understood phenomenologically.\u201dGullar, Ferreira. \u201cNeo- Concrete Manifesto.\u201d History of Modern Latin American Art Course Reader. Spokane: Whitworth University, 2014. In contrast to the Concrete Art movement, Gullar was calling for an art that was not based upon rationalism or in pursuit of pure form. He sought works of art that became active once the viewer was involved. Neo-concrete art must disassemble the limitations of the object and \u201cexpress complex human realities.\u201d While Concretism built its art upon the basis of logic and objective knowledge with color, space, and form conveying universalism and objectivity, the Neo-Concrete artists saw colors, space, and form as \u201cnot [belonging] to this or that artistic language, but to the living and indeterminate experience of man.\u201dAmor, Monica. \u201cFrom Work to Frame, In Between, and Beyond: Lygia Clark and H\u00e9lio Oiticica, 1959\u20131964.\u201d Grey Room 38 (Winter 2010): 20-37. Though Neo-Concrete Art still maintained Concretism as the foundation for their ideas, Neo-Concretists believed objectivity and mathematical principles alone could not accomplish the Concretist goal of creating a transcendental visual language. Neo-Concretists believed that artworks were not simply static representations or forms; rather \u201cart should be like living organisms\u201d In Lygia Clark\u2019s theoretical statement written to address the intentions of the Neo-Concrete artists, she explains that as artists they wish to \u201cfound a new, expressive \u2018space\u2019.\u201dBois, Yve-Alain and Lygia Clark. \u201cNostalgia of the Body.\u201d The MIT Press 69 (Summer 1994): 85-109. This movement believed that through a direct relationship between the artwork and the viewer this \u201cnew, expressive \u2018space\u2019\u201d could be constructed. Neo-Concrete artists sought to create a multi-sensorial space which caused the spectator to feel more acutely their own body and existence. Clark also wrote of how Neo-Concretism sought to decipher the nature of humanity by creating a \u201cmedium of expression\u201d which allowed people to \u201cbecome aware of unity as an organic, living whole.\u201dClark, Lygia. \u201c1960: Death of the Plane.\u201d \u2018\u2019October\u2019\u2019 69 (Summer 1994): 96. It was not just restoring an awareness of the spectator\u2019s body but also of humanity\u2019s communal existence. The first Neo- Concrete Exhibition was held in Rio de Janeiro in March 1959, and the exhibiting artists were Amilcar de Castro, Ferreira Gullar, Franz Weissmann, Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, Reynaldo_Jardim, and Theon Spanudis. == Neo-Concrete Manifesto == This manifesto was written by Ferreira Gullar, and was signed by Amilcar de Castro, Ferreira Gullar, Franz Weissmann, Lygia Clark, Lygia Pape, Reynaldo Jardim and Theon Spanudis. It was published on 22 of March 1959 in Journal do Brazil. == Selected artworks == * H\u00e9lio Oiticica, Inventions, 1959, 30 x 30 cm wooden plaques. Oiticica sought to use the element of color in order to \u201cescape the constraints of painting while remaining in dialogue with it,\u201d and wanted his Inventions to embody rather than simply illustrate light. * Lygia Clark, Cocoons, 1959, metal. Clark cut one piece of metal and folded it irregularly in order to open \u201cup the pictorial support toward the viewer.\u201d This work made the viewer deal with the tension between form and space. ** (1959) * Lygia Pape, Book of Creation, 1959, 30 x 30 cm pages assembled.
