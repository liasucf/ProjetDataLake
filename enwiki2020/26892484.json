The regular 2010 election was to fill thirteen seats, one from each ward except Colnbrook with Poyle, for the 2010\u20132014 term. These thirteen seats were last contested in the Council election of 2006. The remaining twenty-seven Slough Councillors will continue in office, for seats which will be next contested in 2011 or 2012. ==Recent political history of Slough== Between 2004 and 2008, Slough council had no party in overall control. A coalition of the Britwellian, Independent, Liberal and Liberal Democrats Group (BILLD) and the Conservative Group formed a joint administration. In the 2008-2010 period the Labour Group had a majority and was in control of the council. The BILLD Group is itself a local coalition, containing members from four parties or groups of independents. The organisations represented in the group, as at April 2010, were the Slough Liberal Democrats, the Slough Liberals, the Independent Britwellian Residents and Independents from Wexham Lea ward. The existing members of the Group have an electoral pact for the 2010 election, continuing electoral arrangements which started with the 2001 Slough Council election. The Slough Party and a number of Independents, not affiliated with any of the three existing council groups, are also contesting the 2010 election. At the time of the 2008 election there were twenty councillors each supporting the joint administration and the Labour opposition, with one vacancy. After the election count Labour secured four net gains, to give the party a 23:18 margin and a majority of five for the start of the 2008-2009 municipal year. Shortly after the 2008 election, following some rapid defections and re-defections (see 2008 Slough Council election for additional details), a newly re-elected Labour Councillor (Pervez Choudhry who represents Central Ward) joined the Conservative Group. As a result, the Labour majority fell to three. For the 2010-2011 municipal year, Councillor Choudhry was named as the Conservative group leader. The former Tory leader (Derek Cryer representing Langley St Mary's ward) left the Conservative council group, but remained a member of the Conservative Party. {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\" |- bgcolor=\"CCCCCC\" ! || Party || Total Seats April 2010 || Seats Up 2010 || Seats Up 2011 || Seats Up 2012 || Candidates May 2010 |- | | bgcolor=\"FF6868\" | Labour | 22 | 8 | 8 | 6 | 13 |- | | bgcolor=\"5B76FF\" | Conservative | 6 | - | 2 | 4 | 12 |- | * | bgcolor=\"FFD800\" | Liberal Democrats | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 |- | * | bgcolor=\"white\" | Independent (BILLD | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |- | | bgcolor=\"DDDDDD\" | Independent (Non BILLD) | - | - | - | - | 7 |- | * | bgcolor=\"pink\" | Independent Britwellian Residents | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |- | * | bgcolor=\"orange\" | Liberal | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |- | | bgcolor=\"silver\" | The Slough Party | - | - | - | - | 2 |- | | bgcolor=\"5B76FF\" | Independent Conservative | 1 | 1 | - | - | - |- | | Total | 41 | 13 | 14 | 14 | 41 |- |} ==Election result 2010== The plus/minus figure is the change in votes percentage from the 2008 Slough Council election.

A candidate who was an incumbent Councillor for the ward being contested has an * following their name. Figures for the total published electorate are given, at 1 March 2010.Electorate on 1 March 2010, produced by Slough Borough Council. The number given is derived from the full register, not the edited register available to the general public. The spoilt votes and turnout figures were taken from the Slough Council website. The change columns record alterations from the previous local election results. Swing figures are only calculated when the same two parties shared the first two places in both the 2007 and 2008 elections. The swing given is two party or Butler swing, ignoring votes for other candidates. Swing is not calculated for Central Ward, for the same reasons why changes are not calculated. Contrary to the usual convention a positive swing figure is towards Labour and a negative swing towards Conservative (or other party as specified in the result).
