Beginning amid controversy, judge Kyle Sandilands was replaced by Sony Music record executive, Jay Dee Springbett. It was the only season where all four final contestants were eighteen years old or younger. Stan Walker was declared the winner on 22 November 2009. ==Overview== ===Format changes=== Ian Dickson, and Marcia Hines returned as judges; however, long-term judge Kyle Sandilands was sacked after causing controversy on his radio show prior to the premiere, although he was still present for the auditions as they had been pre-recorded some weeks earlier. On 23 August 2009, it was announced on the Idol show that the new judge taking over Kyle Sandilands' spot would be Jay Dee Springbett. Andrew G returned as host, with assistance from Ricki-Lee Coulter due to the departure of James Mathison. The first auditions saw guest judge Brian McFadden join the panel, and his fianc\u00e9e Delta Goodrem acted as a guest judge for the Sydney auditions. A further change was also decided for the Top 12 round eliminations. The Monday-night elimination show was axed in favour of a two-hour 'super Sunday' elimination/ performance show, in which a contestant was eliminated according to votes tallied the previous week, followed by performances. ===Ratings=== The first episode, which featured auditions in both Melbourne and Brisbane, achieved an audience of 1.3m. This was considerably lower than previous first episodes. In 2006, the premiere garnered 1.4m, the 2007 reached 1.65m and 2008 achieved 1.4m. The peak audience, however, of 1.77m was the biggest-seen in years. The show won the night in the 18\u201349 demographic.Behind Idol (2009) Australian Idol Launch peaks at 1.77m. {Accessed 13 August 2009} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px; width:99%;\" |- style=\"background:#cccccc;\" ! width=10% colspan=\"2\"| Episode ! width=10%| Airdate ! width=10%| Timeslot ! width=10%| RatingsOverall national viewers, numbers in brackets indicate nightly ratings position. ! width=10%| Rank ! width=10%| Ref |- | 1 ! rowspan=\"2\" align=centre| \"Auditions\" | 9 August 2009 | rowspan=3| Sunday 6:30 pm\u20138:30 pm | 1.300 | 5 | |- | 2 | 16 August 2009 | 1.171 | 8 | |- | 3 ! align=centre| \"Top 100\" | 23 August 2009 | 1.086 | 8 | rowspan=\"5\"| |- | 4 ! rowspan=\"4\" align=centre| \"Semi Finals\" | 24 August 2009 | Monday 7:30 pm\u20138:30 pm | 1.110 | 10 |- | 5 | 25 August 2009 | Tuesday 7:30 pm\u20138:30 pm | 1.049 | 14 |- | 6 | 26 August 2009 | Wednesday 7:30 pm\u20138:30 pm | 1.049 | 12 |- | 7 | 27 August 2009 | Thursday 7:30 pm\u20138:30 pm | 1.153 | 5 |- | 8 ! align=centre| \"Verdict Semi Final 4/Wildcard\" | 30 August 2009 | rowspan=3| Sunday 6:30 pm\u20138:30 pm | 0.992 | 10 | |- | 9 ! align=centre| \"Verdict Wildcard/Final 12\" | 6 September 2009 | 0.883 | 11 | |- | 10 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 11\" | 13 September 2009 | 0.990 | 12 | |- | 11 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 10\" | 20 September 2009 | rowspan=12|Sunday 7:30 pm\u20139:30 pm | 0.976 | 9 | |- | 12 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 9\" | 27 September 2009 | 0.984 | 10 | |- | 13 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 8\" | 4 October 2009 | 0.926 | 11 | |- | 14 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 7\" | 11 October 2009 | 0.978 | 14 | |- | 15 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 6\" | 18 October 2009 | 1.064 | 8 | |- | 16 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 5\" | 25 October 2009 | 1.003 | 9 | |- | 17 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 4\" | 1 November 2009 | 0.942 | 9 | |- | 18 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 3\" | 8 November 2009 | 0.890 | 11 | |- | 19 ! align=centre| \"Live Verdict/Final 2\" | 15 November 2009 | 0.924 | 10 | |- | 20 ! \"align=centre\" | \"Grand Finale\" * * * | 22 November 2009 | 1.108 * * * 1.471 | 10 * * * 3 | rowspan=2| |} ==Auditions== The auditions were held at the following locations: {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px; width:99%;\" |- !
