The series makes use of interviews, cartoons, and animation. == Episodes == There are 5 episodes, each lasting around 20 minutes. ==Release== The Mind, Explained was released globally on September 12, 2019 on Netflix. == Reception == The show received mostly positive reviews. The website Decider called it \"one of those shows you turn on when you just want to see something short and interesting without having to follow a plot. And though it can be superficial at times, you generally come away from each episode knowing something about your brain you didn't know before.\" The Review Geek calls the series \"[maybe not] the most cerebrally challenging documentary series on the topic but it does have enough engaging material to make for an educational and entertaining watch.\" While the delivery was appreciated, most people found the content to be fleeting. Emma Stone's narration was widely regarded as doing well. The first episode of the series has been found lacking compared to others by many reviewers. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2019 American television series debuts Category:2019 American television series endings Category:2010s American documentary television series Category:Netflix original documentary television series Category:English-language television shows Category:Vox Media ",
