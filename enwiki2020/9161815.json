    "text": "The last logo for Concerned Children's Advertisers, before the name change. right Companies Committed to Kids () (formerly known as Concerned Children's Advertisers) was a Canadian non-profit organization based in Toronto, founded in 1990 by former chief executive officer Sunni Boot and former president of the Global Television Network David Mintz as a contributive production-wide body dedicated to launching campaigns and expressing the significance of their public service announcements to target children between the ages of eight and 12. It produced over 30 announcements, covering topics such as drug abuse, conformity, self-esteem, and bullying. Each PSA ends with the logo of the organization. Usually, the commercials partnered up with Health Canada. The organization and its campaigns are supported by various television networks, stations and specialty channels throughout the country, as well as one border station in the United States (KVOS-TV). Its members are private companies that market to children and families, including McDonald's, Disney, Mattel, PepsiCo, Teletoon, Hasbro, Corus Entertainment, Bell Canada, Cadbury Canada, Hershey's, Kellogg's, Kraft, Shaw Media, Loblaw, Nestle, General Mills, Weston, Canwest, CTV, Publicis, and the Institute of Communication Agencies.Who is Helping Us Out? In 2014, the organization earned around $4 million from its associate media organizations and companies letting it to extend the word across its main goal: bullying, mental health and self-esteem. Almost 25 years, the company estimates having earned $50 million for media donations, $5 million for qualifying corporation and one year and almost two months donated by the businesses minds of marketing. During an event the organization received the David Mintz Visionary Award and the Sunni Boot Leadership Award. The former chief executive officer went to Publicis thanks to his help with planning out and making strategies with media, with the Mintz prize being split by the former president of the organization Cathy Loblaw and the former chair of the organization Craig Hutchison. On March 30, 2017, the organization was permanently shut down because of a decline in business after almost 27 years of running public service announcements. == Public service announcements == ===Substance abuse prevention=== *Brain (1990): One of the first commercials by the organization, this commercial depicts a brain made up of a series of electrical wires.

The commercial ends with the female voice saying: \"Think about it\u2014while you still can.\" AGENCY: Cossette, Inc. *Crack (1990): This brief commercial depicts a body bag on a stretcher.

A man's voice says, \"There's a lot of stories about the stuff that gets into street drugs.\" The hand holding the syringe pushes the plunger down, as if the contaminated water is being injected into someone. The empty syringe is tossed in the air and comes down shattering on to the concrete while the rat flees. Then the man's voice says, \"So if you're afraid of what's been done to them, wait till you see what they do to you,\" as more filthy water runs down over the pieces of the syringe.
