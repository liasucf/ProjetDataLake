Pictures and Village Roadshow Pictures and is scheduled to be released on December 22, 2021. ==Cast== * Keanu Reeves as Neo * Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity * Jada Pinkett Smith as Niobe * Lambert Wilson as The Merovingian * Daniel Bernhardt as Agent Johnson Additionally, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II, Neil Patrick Harris, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Toby Onwumere, Max Riemelt, Er\u00e9ndira Ibarra, Priyanka Chopra, Andrew Caldwell, Brian J. Smith, Lavish and Ellen Hollman have been cast in undisclosed roles. ==Production== ===Development=== While making the Matrix films, the Wachowskis told their close collaborators that they, at the time, had no intention of making another film in the series after The Matrix Revolutions. In February 2015, in interviews promoting Jupiter Ascending, Lilly Wachowski called a return to The Matrix a \"particularly repelling idea in these times\", noting the studios' tendency to green-light sequels, reboots, and adaptations over original material, while Lana Wachowski, addressing rumors about a potential reboot, said they had not heard anything but believed the studio might be looking to replace them. In March 2017, The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Warner Bros. was in early stages of developing a relaunch of the franchise, with Zak Penn in talks to write a treatment, and interest in getting Michael B. Jordan attached to star. Neither of the Wachowskis were involved at that stage, although the studio had hoped for their blessing. The notion of a reboot or remake was denounced by Penn, and ideas for stories set in the already established universe were explored, including, reportedly, a prequel film about a young Morpheus. In March 2018, Penn said he was working on a revival of the franchise and teased the possibility of an expanded universe. Penn clarified in October 2019 that he had been working on one of two Matrix projects at Warner Bros., and that his work was separate from the planned film. In May 2019, it was reported that Chad Stahelski, who worked as stunt coordinator on the previous Matrix films, claimed that at least one of the sisters was involved with a new Matrix film, although he was not sure whether they would be directing it. Shortly later, Stahelski clarifed he was talking hypothetically and didn't mean to confirm their involvement. ===Pre- production=== Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss film a motorcycle scene in the Financial District of San Francisco under the direction of Lana Wachowski. The film was officially announced by Warner Bros. on August 20, 2019. Lana Wachowski would return as sole director, with Reeves and Moss confirmed to reprise their roles. The script was written by Wachowski, Aleksandar Hemon and David Mitchell, who had previously written the series finale of Sense8 together. The Wachowskis also previously directed the film adaptation of Mitchell's novel Cloud Atlas. Lilly Wachowski was not involved with the film due to work on the Showtime series Work in Progress, but gave her blessing to those involved to come up with a story even \"better than the original.\" John Toll was hired to serve as cinematographer that same month. Toll had previously acted as cinematographer for the Wachowskis on Cloud Atlas, Jupiter Ascending and Sense8.'Braveheart' Cinematographer John Toll Boarding 'Matrix 4' In October 2019, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II was cast in the film, with some sources speculating he would be playing a young Morpheus, while Neil Patrick Harris was added in an undisclosed role.
