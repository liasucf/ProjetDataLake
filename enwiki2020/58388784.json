He later almost doubled it in size. Benzon kept Gislingeg\u00e5rd until his death in 1735. The estate was then sold by his heirs to county manager Jacob J\u00f8rgensen. It than changed hands a number of times until it was acquired by Erik Svitzer in 1771. He implemented the agricultural reforms of the time and expanded the sairy. The main building was destroyed by fire in 1773 and later rebuilt at a new location further to the south. The value of the estate dropped significantly during the agricultural crisis from 1713 to 1830. Gisleg\u00e5rd on an old photo Baron Frederik L\u00f8venskiold acquired Gislingeg\u00e5rd in 1845. He leased it out and sold some of the tenant farms to the tenant farmers. Udstykningsforening For Sj\u00e6lland og Fyns Stifter purchased Gislingegaard in 1915. Some of the land was used for the establishment of nine new smallholdings. The rest of the estate was sold toa farmer named Christoffersen later that same year. ==Architecture== The main building is a single-storey Neo-Gothic building from 1873. It is built in Gothic Revival style with crow-stepped gables. ==Today== The estate covers 250 hectares of which 222 hectares are farmland and 16 hectares are meadows. ==List of owners== * (1730-1736) Peder Benzon * (1736-1740) Jacob J\u00f8rgensen * (1740-1747) H.
