The station is licensed to Prescott, Arizona & serves the Prescott/Flagstaff/Phoenix area. It first began broadcasting on September 9, 1981. ==History== KAHM went on the air on September 9, 1981, providing the Prescott area with a format of \"Beautiful Music\" which remains virtually unchanged.. First broadcasting under 1,000 watts, KAHM's signal expanded in the early 1990s to 58,000 watts, serving the people of northern & central Arizona, along with the metropolitan Phoenix market. KAHM broadcasts 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and could easily be heard in southern Arizona as far south as Peoria, Scottsdale and Anthem. Until September 14, 2015, KAHM also had an Internet stream. The stream was ended due to high demand on the server from the spike in listeners following the cancellation of the similarly- formatted Sirius XM Escape channel on conventional receivers. On February 1, 2016, KAHM began streaming again, this time under a $20 per month subscription model. Effective January 12, 2018, Southwest Broadcasting sold KAHM (as well as translator K269EE and sister talk KYCA and its translator K278CN) to Phoenix Radio Broadcasting, a holding company for the Cesar Chavez Foundation's Farmworker Educational Radio Network. ==Translators== K269EE.jpg|2007 Photo of translator K269EE 101.7FM KAHM 102.1 FM - Transmitter 61510.jpg|2008 Photo of Transmitter site 102.1FM ==References== ==External links== *KAHM official website *Listen Live Category:Radio stations established in 1982 Category:Prescott, Arizona AHM Category:Easy listening radio stations Category:1982 establishments in Arizona ",
