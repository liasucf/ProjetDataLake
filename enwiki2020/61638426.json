    "text": "...And Seven Nights is an album by blues musician John Lee Hooker that was recorded in London in 1964 and released by the Verve Folkways label the following year. The album features Hooker with British band, the Groundhogs and was re-released with the title Hooker and the Hogs and with overdubbed horns as On the Waterfront. ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer Bruce Eder stated: \"The sound is raw, tight, and raunchy, some of the best band-backed recordings of Hooker's career. He's notoriously difficult to play support for because of the spontaneity of his work, but these guys keep up and then some, adding engaging flourishes and grace notes. Hooker is in excellent voice, and his material is as strong as any album in his output, rough, dark, and moody\". ==Track listing== All compositions credited to John Lee Hooker # \"Bad Luck and Trouble\" \u2013 4:05 # \"Waterfront\" \u2013 4:20 # \"No One Pleases Me But You\" \u2013 2:20 # \"It's Raining Here\" \u2013 3:55 # \"It's a Crazy Mixed Up World\" \u2013 4:10 # \"Seven Days And Seven Nights\" \u2013 3:55 # \"Mai Lee\" \u2013 3:36 # \"I'm Losin' You\" \u2013 3:50 # \"Little Girl Go Back to School\" \u2013 3:55 # \"Little Dreamer\" \u2013 4:10 # \"Don't Be Messin' with My Bread\" \u2013 3:24 ==Personnel== *John Lee Hooker \u2013 guitar, vocals *Tom Parker \u2013 piano, organ *Tony McPhee \u2013 guitar *Pete Cruickshank \u2013 electric bass *Dave Boorman \u2013 drums ==References== Category:John Lee Hooker albums Category:The Groundhogs albums Category:1965 albums Category:Verve Forecast Records albums ",
