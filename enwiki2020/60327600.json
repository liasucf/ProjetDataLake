Emilio Milutinovi\u0107 (Serbian: \u0415\u043c\u0438\u043b\u0438\u043e \u041c\u0438\u043b\u0443\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u045b; 1870 \u2013 after 1919) was a Chetnik voivode in Old Serbia during the struggle for Macedonia. As a subject of Austria-Hungary at the turn of the twentieth century, he was called to serve in the army but later his conscience would not allow him to continue because it went against his patriotic feelings as a Serb. He deserted and fled to Serbia where he entered the Serbian army with the rank of sergeant. From the year 1904, he was a Chetnik in the company of \u0110or\u0111e Risti\u0107-Skopljance, Van\u0111el Skopljan\u010de, Rista Stara\u010dki, and Vojislav Tankosi\u0107. Because he had a military education and Chetnik experience at the end of 1905, he was appointed voivode by the Serbian Chetnik Organization to head their staff headquarters in Skopska Crna Gora. Vasilije Trbi\u0107 was given the task to take Emilio Milutinovi\u0107 to his post in Skopska Crna Gora. But they never reached their destination. On 21 January 1906 (Julian Calendar), Vasilije Trbi\u0107 came close to losing his entire \u010deta of 22 men when a Turkish force together with Albanians from surrounding areas ambushed them at \u010celopek (not to be confused with the Fight on \u010celopek, the previous year, 1905). Emilio Milutinovi\u0107, who survived the slaughter with Trbi\u010d and a couple of his men, was so grieved that he resigned from further guerrilla action. Later, however, he went on to participate in both Balkan Wars and the Great War as a Chetnik volunteer.\u0414. \u0421. \u0408\u0435\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0438\u045b, \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0432\u043e\u0434\u0435 \u0438\u0437 \u0447\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0438\u0447\u043a\u0435 \u0430\u043a\u0446\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0443 \u0421\u0442\u0430\u0440\u043e\u0458 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0438 \u0438 \u041c\u0430\u045b\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0438 1903-1912, \u0414\u043e\u0431\u0440\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0459\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0438 \u0433\u043b\u0430\u0441\u043d\u0438\u043a, \u0431\u0440. 32. \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0430 17, 2008. ==See also== *List of Chetnik voivodes ==References== ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * D.
