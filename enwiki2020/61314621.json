It was produced by Linda Perry, and follows eight years after the reissue of her third studio album Strip Me, released in 2010. ==Background== Bedingfield said her intention with the album was to \"make music that moves people and makes them move their bodies and hair. It's bright and bold but in a way that is also raw and honest.\" Linda Perry stated that she wanted to work with Bedingfield because she feels she is \"one of the best live performers I have ever seen and has one of the most versatile voices I have ever heard\". ==Commercial performance== The album debuted at number 36 on the US Billboard Independent Albums chart. ==Track listing== Adapted from Apple Music. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:Natasha Bedingfield albums Category:Albums produced by Linda Perry Category:Universal Music Group albums ",
