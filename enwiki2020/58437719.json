It is accredited through the Independent Schools Association of the Central States (ISACS). ==History== Logos High School was founded in 1970 in a warehouse. It was originally founded to assist troubled adolescents obtain a GED. Within a year, the mission had expanded to giving a full high school education to troubled teens. The original layout of the school was classrooms with pillows and sofas instead of chairs and desks. Student Therapy was introduced from the start of Logos High School to help students. Eventually the school grew into a 4-year program and leased and later bought a former grade school from Ladue School District. In 1991, the school expanded to include grades 7-8 with their own separate class room. In 2008, the school expanded to include 6th grade as well. Since Logos High's inception, over 2,000 adolescents have graduated from the high school. 92% of students go to college, while 99% graduate high school. With a student-teacher ratio of 6-1, Logos High School shows itself as an alternative for students who cannot succeed in a traditional high school setting. In an interview with St. Louis Public Radio, Dr. Boyd-Fenger says many students leave after 2 years for public high schools after \"being pointed in the right direction\" and vigorous discussion between staff, parents and administration. The school annually receives $1 million from various alumni and donors for financial aid for incoming students. ==References== Category:Educational institutions established in 1970 Category:High schools in St. Louis County, Missouri Category:1970 establishments in Missouri Category:Buildings and structures in St. Louis County, Missouri ",
