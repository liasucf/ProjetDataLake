    "text": "Bean Rock Lighthouse is a lighthouse situated at the end of a reef in the Waitemata Harbour in Auckland, New Zealand. It is the only remaining example in New Zealand of a wooden cottage-style lighthouse, and it is one of only a few remaining worldwide. It is also the oldest wooden lighthouse and only wave-washed tower in New Zealand. It is owned, operated and maintained by Ports of Auckland. == History == Bean Rock lighthouse was built c.1870 at a cost of 3000 pounds and was first lit on 24 July 1871, using a kerosene lamp of 350 candlepower. The location had been recommended by James Balfour and he did the early conceptual design work but was drowned in an accident before the design was completed. His design work was finished by James Stewart. It was named for Royal Navy Lieutenant P.C.D. Bean of HMS Herald, which surveyed and charted the Waitemata Harbour in the 1840s. Bean Rock was inhabited by lighthouse keepers and their families until 1912, when it was automated and the keepers were withdrawn. In 1936, cable was laid from the city side of the harbour to the lighthouse and the light was run by electricity. At the time, the beacon had a distinctive signalling sequence and a coloured light display to indicate the correct course to shipping in the channel. In 1985, the lighthouse was restored, with new timber legs being sunk into new concrete foundations. In the mid-1990s, the lighthouse was converted to solar power and synchronised with an automatic foghorn. Bean Rock lighthouse has a Category 1 registration (number 3295) under the Historic Places Act. As it is a working lighthouse, it is not open to the public. == See also == * List of lighthouses in New Zealand == References == == External links == * * Lighthouses of New Zealand Maritime New Zealand Category:Lighthouses completed in 1871 Category:Lighthouses in New Zealand Category:Buildings and structures in the Auckland Region Category:1870s architecture in New Zealand Category:NZHPT Category I listings in the Auckland Region ",
