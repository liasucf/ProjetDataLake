    "text": "Saint Mary's Redoubt (), also known as Migart Redoubt (), was a redoubt on the island of Comino in Malta. It was built by the Order of Saint John in 1716 or 1761 (sources vary) as one of a series of coastal fortifications around the Maltese Islands. The redoubt was located on the northern coast of Comino, far away from the island's other defences of Saint Mary's Tower and Saint Mary's Battery. It was demolished and no traces of it can be seen today. ==References== Category:Redoubts in Malta Category:Castles and fortifications of the Knights Hospitaller Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Malta Category:Comino Category:Limestone buildings in Malta Category:18th- century fortifications ",
