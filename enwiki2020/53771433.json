In baseball statistics, a putout (denoted by PO or fly out when appropriate) is given to a defensive player who records an out by a tagging a runner with the ball when he is not touching a base (a tagout), catching a batted or thrown ball and tagging a base to put out a batter or runner (a force out), catching a thrown ball and tagging a base to record an out on an appeal play, catching a third strike (a strikeout), catching a batted ball on the fly (a flyout), or being positioned closest to a runner called out for interference. A right fielder, abbreviated RF, is the outfielder in baseball or softball who plays defense in right field. Right field is the area of the outfield to the right of a person standing at home plate and facing towards the pitcher's mound. In the numbering system used to record defensive plays, the right fielder is assigned the number 9. Paul Waner is the all-time leader in putouts by a right fielder with 4,759 career. Roberto Clemente (4,458), Dwight Evans (4,247), Hank Aaron (4,161), Tony Gwynn (4,052), Nick Markakis (4,025), Sammy Sosa (4,017), and Ichiro Suzuki (4,005) are the only other right fielders to record over 4,000 career putouts. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:100%;\" | Rank || Rank amongst leaders in career putouts.
