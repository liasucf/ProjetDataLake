She has competed at world championships, including at the 2015 World Weightlifting Championships. Rogers won the silver medal in 2019 in Pattaya Thailand, Pattaya marked the 24-year- old\u2019s fourth senior worlds and the third in a row at which she medaled. After her 2017 silver she was the first medal in 12 years for an American of either gender and her 2018 clean & jerk bronze marked the first time a U.S. lifter had medaled at consecutive worlds since 1994, Rogers is now the first from her country to medal at three straight in 25 years; Byrd-Goad earned medals each year from 1991 through 1994. She holds the United States record in the snatch, clean & jerk, and total. Rogers has broken multiple of her own American records, and is a junior pan American champion. Starting out as a competitive cheerleader, Rogers transferred into CrossFit at age 17, and transferred into weightlifting a year later. ==Early life== Rogers was born August 23, 1995 in Apopka, Florida. Before weightlifting, Rogers competed in cheerleading and gymnastics. She began training in CrossFit when she was 17 years old. After one year of training, she competed in her first weightlifting meet. In 2014, she made her International Weightlifting Federation debut at the 2014 IWF Pan- American Junior Championships. She made her senior-level debut a year later at the 2015 World Championships where she finished 15th overall with a total of 226 kg. In 2016, Rogers narrowly missed qualifying for the 2016 Summer Olympics. She was awarded best overall lifter at the 2016 National Championships & Olympic Trials, but did not qualify for the Olympic Games because Jenny Arthur, Morghan King, and Sarah Robles would give the United States a better chance at winning an Olympic medal. ==Major results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=2 width=40 | Year ! rowspan=2 width=250 | Event ! rowspan=2 width=250 | Venue ! rowspan=2 width=60 | Weight ! colspan=4 | Snatch (kg) ! colspan=4 | Clean & Jerk (kg) ! rowspan=2 width=40 | Total ! rowspan=2 width=40 | Rank |- ! width=40 | 1 !! width=40 | 2 !! width=40 | 3 !! width=40 | Rank !! width=40 | 1 !! width=40 | 2 !! width=40 | 3 !! width=40 | Rank |- | 2015 || align=left | 2015 World Weightlifting Championships || align=left | Houston, United States || 69 kg || 97 || 100 || ~~102~~ || 16 || 120 || 123 || 126 || 13 || 226 || 15 |- | 2016 || align=left | 2016 National Championships \u2013 Olympic Trials || align=\"left\" | Salt Lake City, United States || 69 kg || 100 || 106 || ~~109~~ || 1 || ~~132~~ || 132 || ~~141~~ || 1 || 238 || 1 |- | 2016 || align=left | 2016 National University Championships || align=\"left\" | New Orleans, United States || 69 kg || 95 || 98 || 101 || 1 || 120 || 124 || 127 || 1 || 228 || 1 |- | 2016 || align=left | 2016 World University Championship || align=\"left\" | Merida, Mexico || 69 kg || 95 || 99 || 103 || 1 || 122 || 126 || 132 || 1 || 235 || 1 |- | 2016 || align=left | 2016 American Open || align=\"left\" | Orlando, United States || 69 kg || 97 || 100 || 103 || 1 || 123 || 126 || 132 || 1 || 235 || 1 |- | 2017 || align=left | 2017 National Championships || align=left | Chicago, United States || 69 kg || 98 || 102 || 105 || 1 || 126 || 130 || 134 || 1 || 239 || 1 |- | 2017 || align=left | 2017 Pan-American Championships || align=left | Miami, United States || 69 kg || ~~95~~ || 96 || 100 || 2 || 125 || 130 || 133 || 2 || 233 || 2 |- | 2017 || align=left | 2017 World Weightlifting Championship || align=\"left\" | Anaheim, CA United States || 69 kg || 101 || 104 || ~~107~~ || 3 || 131 || ~~135~~ || ~~135~~ || 3 || 235 || 3 |- | 2018 || align=left | 2018 Pan-American Championship || align=\"left\" | Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic || 69 kg || ~~99~~ || 99 || ~~103~~ || 2 || 126 || 130 || ~~136~~ || 2 || 229 || 2 |- | 2018 || align=left | 2018 World Weightlifting Championship || align=\"left\" | Ashgabat, Turkmenistan || 71 kg || 100 || 103 || 105 || 5 || 130 || 133 || ~~137~~ || 3 || 238 || 5 |} == References == ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:American female weightlifters Category:People from Apopka, Florida Category:World Weightlifting Championships medalists ",
