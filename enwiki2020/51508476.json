(1937) p. 141) (October 5, 1904 \u2013 2000) was an American sculptor born in Niles, Michigan to Bertha Wright de Coux and the Reverend Charles John de Coux. She is best remembered for her ecclesiastical reliefs and statues. ==Early years== When she was eight years old her family moved to Gibsonia, Pennsylvania, near Pittsburgh. While still in high school De Coux began attending the Carnegie Institute of Technology where she studied with Joseph Bailey Ellis. Deciding that the program there was not geared enough to the fine arts she moved to The Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation and then she attended the school of the Art Institute of Chicago. Whitney Warren wrote her a letter of introduction to C. Paul Jennewein, for whom she worked as an assistant. This was followed by stints working for Aristide Cianfarani in Providence, where she attended the Rhode Island School of Design, and with Alvin Meyer in Chicago.Rubenstein, Charlotte Streifer, American Women Sculptors, G.K. Hall & Co., Boston (1990), p. 282-282. Later she served as an assistant to James Earle Fraser after she had helped enlarge his equestrian statue of Theodore Roosevelt.Evert, Marilyn, Discovering Pittsburgh\u2019s Sculpture, photographs by Vernon Gay,University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh (1983), p. 401. During the Great Depression US President Franklin Deleno Roosevelt initiated the New Deal. One of its programs was the Federal Art Projects under which the federal government hired artists, mostly painters and sculptors to create art for a variety of public places, often post offices. De Coux carved a relief, \"Vacation Time\" for the post office in Girard, Pennsylvania. In 1984 the piece was listed as \u201cin storage.\u201dPark, Marlene and Gerald E.
