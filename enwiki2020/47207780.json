Tradition has it that Kalidasa, one of the greatest Sanskrit poets, was motivated to compose his Meghad\u016bta, a lyrical poem, by the Ramagiri Fort; however, Kalidasa is thought to have lived in the fifth century CE, well before the fort's construction. ==Features== View from the Ramagari Fort Built in stone, the fort has many bastions and occupies a large area of a few square kilometres.
