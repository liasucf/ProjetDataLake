    "text": "The British milk company Unigate produced a series of TV advertisements in the 1970s featuring characters called the Humphreys. The Humphreys were milk thieves whose only visible presence was a red-and-white striped straw with which to suck up the milk. TV personalities of the time, including Barbara Windsor, Arthur Mullard, and Rod Hull, featured in the adverts; but the campaign is best known for the slogan: \"Watch out, watch out\u2014there's a Humphrey about!\" A merchandising campaign accompanied the adverts; and the Humphrey-themed mugs, milk bottles, and straws are now collectors' items. The campaign was devised by John Webster of the Boase Massimi Pollitt advertising agency. ==Celebrities featuring in the Humphrey ads== *Muhammad Ali *Benny Hill *Rod Hull *Sid James *Henry McGee *Spike Milligan *Frank Muir *Arthur Mullard *Barbara Windsor Several campaign stickers were produced, of which the following are just three examples: \"Watch Out, Watch Out, There's a Humphrey About\", which features two red-and-white striped straws projecting from a pocket; \"Watch Out for the Humphrey Patrol\", which features a row of the tops of thirteen red and white striped straws; and \"Drink it Quick, Humphreys are Slick\", which features a red-and-white striped straw projecting from a partially drunk glass of milk. Three different full sticker sheets can be seen online. ==References== ==External links== *UK TV Commercials page featuring the lyrics to the Humphrey song. Category:Food advertising characters ",
