    "text": "\"A Toast to Men\" is a song recorded by American singer Willa Ford, featuring vocals by Lady May. Lava released it on October 21, 2003 as a single from her cancelled second studio album SexySexObsessive. Toby Gad produced the song and wrote it with Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Ford had spent approximately two years working on material for a follow-up to her debut album Willa Was Here (2001). She said that she wanted to revolutionize pop music through using the word \"fuck\". After SexySexObsessive was shelved, \"A Toast to Men\" was promoted as a solo single. Ford was hesitant on whether or not Lava Records would release the song given its provocative content. A pop song with dance influences, its lyrics are based on Ford's experiences at a sorority party; it has a hook reminiscent of sorority chants. An extended play (EP) and a music video were released to promote the song. It was featured in the 2004 film Barbershop 2: Back in Business. \"A Toast to Men\" received positive reviews from critics, who noted its composition and Ford's sex appeal. It peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart and number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. == Background and composition == Following the release of debut studio album Willa Was Here (2001), Willa Ford spent two years working on new music. She had developed the concept for \"A Toast to Men\" at a sorority party, after hearing girls chant: \u201cHere\u2019s to the men we love / Here\u2019s to the men who love us / Fuck the men, let\u2019s drink to us.\u201d The lines were used for the song's hook. Ford was uncertain if her record label, Lava, would approve of the single's use of profanity. Describing her intentions behind its lyrics, she said: \"I was part of the revolution, as far as changing the way people think of pop music. I wanted it to be sexy and fierce and be OK to say the word 'fuck.' I just needed some time to get out of it and figure out what the fuck was going on.\" \"A Toast to Men\" was produced by Toby Gad, who contributed to the songwriting with Willa Ford and Rhonda Robinson. Tom Coyne served as the track's mastering engineer. It includes vocals by American rapper Lady May. A pop song, \"A Toast to Men\" lasts three minutes and twelve seconds. Rolling Stone's Gil Kaufman wrote that the song had elements of dance music, while Elysa Gardner of the Chicago Sun-Times as inspired by hip hop music and dancehall. The lyrics were compared to \"an age-old sorority chant\", and \"salty sorority chant into a female-empowerment anthem\". == Release and promotion == \"A Toast to Men\" was released as a digital download by Lava on October 21, 2003. An extended play (EP), which included the original and four remixes, was made available on November 18 of the same year. Lava promoted the song as part of Ford's second studio album SexySexObsessive. After the album's cancellation, \"A Toast to Me\" was referenced as a \"solo single\" instead. Due to the song's obscenity, critics question if radio personalities could say the single's full title on air. An edit was created to better accommodate radioplay, and the song was subsequently placed on heavy rotation on both radio stations and television. The song was featured in the 2004 film Barbershop 2: Back in Business. Jay Hainsworth of IGN wrote that \"A Toast to Me\" was \"surrounded by controversy due to its risqu\u00e9 lyrics\". A music video was released to promote the single, which Billboard's Chuck Taylor praised as \"saucy (but graciously playful)\" and \"add[ing] fuel to the flamboyant raunch\". == Reception == Critics had a positive response to \"A Toast to Me\". A writer from Maxim said that Ford \"proved she's still a hellcat\" with the song, and an AskMen commentator wrote that the singer \"decided to hit hard again\". Gil Kaufman praised the single as a combination of \"Christina Aguilera's dance- influenced raunch with Pink's confessional pop\". Despite commending \"A Toast to Men\" as catchy, Chuck Taylor criticized its intention to shock the listener as too overt, and called it a \"cheap thrill\". Commercially, \"A Toast to Men\" peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales chart on December 6, 2003. It also peaked at number 45 on the Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales chart. ==Track lists== ==Credits and personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. ;Management *Lava Records ;Personnel * Songwriting \u2013 Willa Ford, Rhonda Robinson, Toby Gad * Production \u2013 Tony Gad * Mastering engineer \u2013 Tom Coyne ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !Chart (2004) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Billboard Hot Dance Singles Sales | style=\"text- align:center;\"|11 |- !scope=\"row\"|Billboard Hot 100 Singles Sales | style=\"text-align:center;\"|45 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders unsortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\"|Country ! scope=\"col\"|Date ! scope=\"col\"|Format ! scope=\"col\"|Label |- !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"|Worldwide |rowspan=\"1\"|October 21, 2003 |Digital download |rowspan=\"2\"|Lava Records |- |November 18, 2003 |CD single |} == Notes == ==References== == External links == * * \"A Toast to Men\" music video at Toby Gad's official website Category:2003 singles Category:Willa Ford songs Category:Songs written by Toby Gad Category:Song recordings produced by Toby Gad Category:Songs with feminist themes ",
