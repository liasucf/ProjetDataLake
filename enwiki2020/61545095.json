His performances saw him make the Northland Mitre 10 Cup team playing in 11 games before moving on to a fully professional contract with SU Agen in France, as a medical joker (injury replacement) for Canadian wing Taylor Paris. His impressive performances saw Agen make him a permanent signing at the end of the season with a two-year contact. However in November 2016 it was announced Nakosi had signed for Toulon to join his brother Josua Tuisova, before allowing him to remain at Agen for a further season on loan. After playing only one season for Toulon Nakosi moved on again to Castres Olympique in the summer of 2019. In August 2019 he was named in Fiji's squad for the 2019 Rugby World Cup. ==References== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Fijian rugby union players Category:RC Toulonnais players Category:SU Agen Lot-et-Garonne players Category:Rugby union wings Category:Fijian expatriate rugby union players Category:Expatriate rugby union players in France Category:Fiji international rugby union players ",
