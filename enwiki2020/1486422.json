    "text": "Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are an American candy consisting of a chocolate cup filled with peanut cream, marketed by The Hershey Company. They were created on November 15, 1928 https://www.snackhistory.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cupsby H. B. Reese, a former dairy farmer and shipping foreman for Milton S. Hershey. Reese left his job at The Hershey Company to start his own candy business. Reese's generates more than $2 billion in annual sales for The Hershey Company https://www.foodbusinessnews.net/articles/14762-reeses-thins-a-win-for- hersheyand Reese's Peanut Butter Cups are #1 on the List of top-selling candy brands. ==The history of the H.B. Reese Candy Company== In 1923, The H.B. Reese Candy Company was established in the basement of Reese's home in Hershey, Pennsylvania. Reese had originally worked at a Hershey dairy farm, and from the start he used Hershey Chocolate in his confections. Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were his most popular candy, and Reese eventually discontinued his other lines. H. B. Reese died on May 16, 1956, in West Palm Beach, Florida passing the company to his six sons, Robert, John, Ed, Ralph, Harry, and Charles Richard Reese. On July 2, 1963, the Reese brothers merged the H.B. Reese Candy Company with the Hershey Chocolate Corporation in a tax- free stock-for-stock merger. In 2020 after 57 years of stock splits, the Reese brothers' original 666,316 shares of Hershey common stock represented 16 million Hershey shares valued at over $2.5 billion that paid annual cash dividends of $51.4 million. In 1969, only 6 years after the Reese/Hershey merger, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups became The Hershey Company's top seller. The H.B. Reese Candy Company is maintained as a subsidiary of Hershey because the Reese plant workforce is not unionized, unlike the main Hershey plant. In 2012, Reese's was the best-selling candy brand in the United States with sales of $2.603 billion, and was the fourth-best-selling candy brand globally with sales of $2.679 billion\u2014only $76 million (2.8%) of its sales were from outside the United States market. Additionally, the H.B. Reese Candy Company manufactures the Kit Kat in the United States, which had 2012 U.S. sales of $948 million. As of October 2017 in the U.S. convenience store channel, Reese's was the largest confection brand by far: it was 62% larger than the next brand, with more households purchasing Reese's than any other confection brand across the United States. Reese's includes the overall top-selling confection item\u2014the Reese's Peanut Butter Cups King Size\u2014as well as six of the top 20 chocolate/non-chocolate items. Additionally, the Reese's brand accounts for over 47% of all seasonal sales within the U.S. convenience store channel, including the top two items in the largest four commercial seasons: Valentine's, Easter, Halloween, & Christmas. As a comparison, the next largest brand accounts for only 10% of seasonal sales. ==Product Brand Variations== The first Peanut Butter Cup, a peanut butter and chocolate confection, was launched in 1928 by The H.B. Reese Candy Company. The official product name was actually \"Penny Cups\" because the cost was only one cent at that time. In 1963, The Hershey Company purchased The H.B. Reese Candy Company from H.B. Reese's sons. Since then, the famous Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product portfolio has grown to sell different variations of the product, using alternate chocolate or candy coatings, offering different sizes, and honoring different seasonal holidays and events. As the introduction of these variations took off in popularity, they soon earned a permanent spot in the product portfolio. The first non-original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product brand variation was launched in 1976, under the product name \"Reese's Crunchy\". The Reese's Crunchy product brand variation featured a crunchy peanut butter creme, as opposed to the smooth peanut butter creme in the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup. In 1987, the first Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, King Size was launched. In 1993, Hershey nationally launched the Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkins. The White Creme pumpkins were added to the Reese's Peanut Butter Pumpkin line in 2017. In 1997, Hershey added another seasonal product brand variation to the Peanut Butter Cups product line with national launch of the Reese's Peanut Butter Hearts. In March 2003, Hershey's introduced a Sugar Free variation of the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup, called Reese's Sugar Free Peanut Butter Cups. In December 2003, the White Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product variation was permanently added to the Reese's Peanut Butter Cup product line. The product brand variation originally launched as \"White Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups\" but was changed to White Reese's or White Creme Reese's after much scrutiny for its misrepresentation since the product does not actually include any chocolate. Reese's Big Cups are a thicker version of the traditional Reese's Peanut Butter Cup which was introducted in 2003, but was not added to the permanent product brand portfolio until 2005. In 2007, Hershey released a limited edition \"Elvis Peanut Butter & Banana Creme\" Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Cup product variation to honor the King. The filling flavor was inspired with by Elvis Presley's known love of peanut butter and banana sandwiches. Although this product brand variation has not made its way onto the list of the permanent product brand offerings, there is a petition to bring it back permanently. Although being introduced on and off as part of limited edition product variations for many year, the Dark Chocolate Reese's Peanut Butter Cups product made its permanent debut in 2009. In July 2016, The Hershey Company launched a product variation that merges two of Reese's popular product brands: Reese's Pieces and Reese's Peanut Butter Cups. The new product brand variation is called Reese's Pieces Peanut Butter Cups which consist of the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup that has Reese's Pieces candy mixed in to the peanut butter filling. IIn March of 2017, Hershey added the Reese's Crunchy Cookie Peanut Butter Cup which are a variation of the original Reese's Peanut Butter Cup including crunchy cookie bits in the peanut butter filling. Hershey has since launched a Big Cup version called Reese's Big Cup Crunchy Cookie. In October 2018, Reese's Peanut Butter Cups launched a product brand variation that was 40% thinner than the original cup, called Reese's THiNs. Reese's THiNs were first launched in only milk chocolate or dark chocolate, but now are offered in white creme as well. In April 2019, the Chocolate Lovers and the Peanut Butter Lovers product brand variations of Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were launched. The Peanut Butter Lovers Cup features a peanut butter top on the shell coating, and the Reese's Chocolate Lovers cup features more chocolate. Variations of these two product brands were launched originally in 2005 as a limited edition. The Peanut Butter Lovers cup in 2005 did not have extra peanut butter in the shell coating as it does today. In July 2020, Hershey announced its first-ever colored product brand variation, the Reese's Peanut Butter Franken-Cup. The Reese's Franken-Cup consists of milk chocolate, white creme that is dyed green, and the traditional peanut butter creme filling. In September 2020, The Hershey Company announced the introduction of a new product variation on the Reese's Peanut Butter Big Cup that will include pretzel pieces within the peanut butter creme filling, called \"Reese\u2019s Big Cups with Pretzels\". At the same time, Hershey also announced the limited edition Big Cup launched in March 2021 called \"Big Cup with Chips\" which will be a Reese's Big Cup with potato chips mixed into the peanut butter creme filling. == Variations == A trio of different sized cups.

They are sold in a 6-pack packaging configuration but are usually available individually. Although exterior packaging is altered to reflect the theme of the representative holiday, the actual holiday itself is never presented. * Reese's Peanut Butter Hearts: Available mainly during January and February, these are heart-shaped confections representing Valentine's Day. At various retailers, an individually-packaged, larger heart is available as well. These are packaged in all-red exterior packaging. A packet of Peanut Butter Cups * Reese's Peanut Butter Eggs: Available mainly during March and April, these are egg-shaped confections representing Easter. Exterior packaging is usually yellow and orange (milk chocolate), white and orange (white chocolate), or dark brown and orange (fudge-flavored chocolate). This is the only holiday-themed item available in three chocolate varieties.Are you a Cadbury Cr\u00e8me or Reese\u2019s Peanut Butter Egg?

The \"Classic\" two-pack is a 0.75 oz. cup since 2001 (originally a 0.9 oz. size, reduced to 0.8 oz. in 1991), the \"King Size\" four-pack introduced in the early 1980s is a 0.7 oz. cup (originally a 0.8 oz. cup until 1991) and the \"Lunch\" eight-pack is a 0.55 oz. cup. \"Large Size\" packs of three 0.7 oz. cups, as well as bags containing 0.6 oz. cups, are also available. The \"mini\" cups come in various bag sizes and foil colors for seasonal themes like red, gold and green for the Christmas holiday season. In Canada, where they are packaged as Reese Peanut Butter Cups, but still widely referred to by their American name, they come in a standard pack of three 0.55 oz. cups or the king-size variation with four cups. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, they were originally available only in two-packs, though are now available in three-packs, five-packs and minis. In 2008 Reese's Peanut Butter Cups were made available in Europe by Hydro Texaco and 7-Eleven. In Australia, Reese's products can be found in many specialty candy stores, as well as from American stores such as Costco. In the 1970s and 1980s, a series of commercials were run for Reese's Peanut Butter Cups featuring situations in which two people, one eating peanut butter and one eating chocolate, collided. One person would exclaim, \"You got your peanut butter on my chocolate!\" and the other would exclaim, \"You got your chocolate in my peanut butter!\" They would then sample the mixture and remark on the great taste, tying in with the slogan \"Two great tastes that taste great together.\" In the 1990s, the product's slogan was: \"There's no wrong way to eat a Reese's.\" In 2006, its slogan was: \"Perfect\". The current slogan, introduced in 2018, is: Not Sorry Reese's. Reese's was an associate sponsor of NASCAR Cup Series drivers Mark Martin (1994), and Kevin Harvick (2007\u20132010). ==See also== * List of peanut dishes == References == ==Further reading== * == External links == * * Reese's Facebook Page * Reese's Seasonal Products * Reese Brands at Hershey Canada * https://www.hersheys.com/reeses/en_us/products.html Category:Products introduced in 1928 Category:American brands Category:The Hershey Company brands Category:Peanut butter ",
