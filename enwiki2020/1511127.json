Founded in 1960, the club has spent 60 years in Liga MX, the top tier of the Mexican football league system. The club had their first major success in the 1975\u201376 season, becoming the first team from Nuevo Le\u00f3n to win a trophy by conquering the Copa MX against Club Am\u00e9rica.

They previously were named the Jabatos de Nuevo Le\u00f3n. In 1967, their venue, the Estadio Universitario was built. In the 1973\u201374 season, Jos\u00e9 \"Ch\u00e9\" G\u00f3mez guided the team to the title and promotion to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n de M\u00e9xico, now Liga MX. They defeated the Leones Negros de la Universidad de Guadalajara for 3\u20132. In the 1975\u201376, Tigres won their first domestic cup, the Copa M\u00e9xico (now Copa MX), against Am\u00e9rica after winning 3\u20132. Under the command of Uruguayan coach Carlos Miloc and players such as Tom\u00e1s Boy and Geronimo Barbadillo, for the 1977\u201378 season Tigres aimed to the league championship. In the quarter-finals of the liguilla (play-offs), they defeated Estudiantes Tecos by 1\u20130 and 3\u20132 (4\u20132). In the semi-finals Tigres defeated Cruz Azul 0\u20131 and 3\u20130 (3\u20131). In the finals they defeated UNAM 2\u20130 and 1\u20131 (3\u20131). Tigres made their best season ever with 48 points in the 1978\u201379, but did not reach the finals. In the 1979\u201380 season, Tigres made it to the finals against Cruz Azul. In the first leg, Cruz Azul won 1\u20130 at the Estadio Universitario, and in the second leg, at the Estadio Azteca, Tigres, although down 3\u20130 at one point, rallied back to ensure a 3\u20133 draw. Nonetheless, Tigres still lost the finals by an aggregate scoreline of 4\u20133. In the 1981\u201382 season, they won their second League championship against Atlante at the Estadio Azteca. In the quarter-finals of postseason, they tied with Guadalajara 1\u20131 and 1\u20131 (2\u20132). In the semi-finals, they defeated Am\u00e9rica 2\u20130 and 0\u20131 (2\u20131), and in the finals they tied 2\u20131 and 0\u20131 (2\u20132) against Atlante.

In 1988, after fourteen years in the team, the iconic Mexican midfielder Tom\u00e1s Boy retired. In the 1989\u201390 season, meanwhile, Tigres finished the tournament as the first place of their group with 40 points and went to liguilla. They lost in quarter-finals by 3\u20132 and 1\u20133 (4\u20135) against Club Universidad de Guadalajara. In 1990, Tigres lost the finals of the 1989\u201390 Copa Mexico against Puebla. In the 1992\u201393 season, they earned 44 points and went to play-offs. In the quarter-finals, Tigres lost 0\u20132 and 2\u20134 (2\u20136) against Club Le\u00f3n. ===Relegation, quick return to Primera Divisi\u00f3n, 2001 and 2003 runner-up=== In 1996, Tigres hired the Chilean international forward Claudio N\u00fa\u00f1ez and after several years of ups and downs the team won their second domestic cup defeating Atlas by 2\u20131 but were relegated to Primera Divisi\u00f3n A, now Ascenso MX, because of negative results of past seasons. Note that the Mexican League uses a percentage-based relegation system, in which the team with the worst performance percentage by year (instead of the worst team in the season) is relegated. Under the command of Victor Manuel Vucetich, the team qualified to play-offs in 1996 but because of the relegation they were unable to compete. After some negotiations, the administration of the team was given for ten years to Sinergia Deportiva, a trust-holder run by CEMEX. In 1997, after two consecutive Primera Divisi\u00f3n A championships, the team returned to the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. In 1998, Tigres hired international striker Luis Hern\u00e1ndez. Under the command of the Brazilian coach Ricardo Ferretti, Tigres finished the Verano 2001 season in the fourth place with 27 points and secured postseason. In the quarter-finals Tigres lost by 3\u20131 and 2\u20132 (5\u20133) against Puebla. In the Invierno 2001 season, Tigres finished the tournament as leader with 36 points. In the play-offs, they beat Santos Laguna in the quarter-finals 1\u20131 and 3\u20130 (4\u20131). In the semi-finals, they tied with Cruz Azul 1\u20131 (0\u20131 and 1\u20130), and because of the 36 points they achieved in the tournament, they went to the next stage. In the finals, Tigres lost 2\u20130 and 1\u20131 (3\u20131) against Pachuca in the Estadio Universitario. In June 2002, the talented Argentine attacking midfielder Walter Gait\u00e1n was hired, a player that later would become an icon of the team. In the Clausura 2003, Tigres finished the tournament as the fourth place with 34 points, and went to postseason. In the quarter-finals, they defeated Toluca by 2\u20131 and 2\u20132 for an aggregate of 4\u20133. In the semi-finals, Tigres lost against arch-rival Monterrey. In the first game they lost by 4\u20131, while in the second Tigres won 2\u20131 for an aggregate score of 5\u20133. After the loss, coach Ricardo Ferretti was fired. Coach Ricardo Ferretti has given some of the team's highest numbers. On the Apertura 2003, now under the command of Argentine coach Nery Pumpido (with a team that Ferretti build), Tigres finished the tournament as leader now with 38 points. In the play-offs, they tied 1\u20130 and 1\u20132 (2\u20132) with Cruz Azul in the quarter-finals. In the semi-finals, they faced Toluca, who was now under the command of Ricardo Ferretti, and defeated them 0\u20131 and 2\u20130 (2\u20131). In the finals, Tigres lost 1\u20133 and 1\u20130 (3\u20132) once more against Pachuca in the Estadio Universitario. In the Clausura 2004, Argentine striker Andr\u00e9s Silvera finished the tournament as one of the top goal scorers, but Tigres ended in 12th place and missed the play-offs. That same tournament they scored the biggest result in a Cl\u00e1sico Regiomontano, beating archrival Monterrey 6\u20132. In October 2004, Sinergia Deportiva purchased the rights to a franchise in the MISL called the \"Monterrey Tigres\". However, due to conflicts with the previous MISL franchise \"Monterrey Fury\", the team elected not to complete the purchase of the team, and the MISL terminated the indoor franchise in December 2004. In the Clausura 2005, Tigres went to postseason and tied with Monarcas Morelia 2\u20132 and 2\u20132 (4\u20134) in the quarter-finals, and Morelia went to the next stage because of the points they achieved in the regular season. In the Apertura 2005, Walter Gait\u00e1n finished the season as the top scorer of the tournament and Tigres went to play-offs in 8th place. In the quarter-finals, under the command of the iconic Osvaldo Batocletti, Tigres played the historical \"Aztecazo\", a way to describe a difficult victory over Am\u00e9rica or the Mexico national team in their venue, the Estadio Azteca. In the first game, Tigres lost in the Estadio Universitario by a 1\u20133 score. Against all odds, however, they defeated Am\u00e9rica in the second game 4\u20131 for an aggregate scoreline of 5\u20134, leaving Am\u00e9rica out of the postseason. In the semi-finals, Tigres drew Monterrey after 1\u20130 and 1\u20132 (2\u20132) scorelines, although Monterrey progressed to the next round because of the points in the tournament. On 3 August 2006, CEMEX, the company that controls Tigres, celebrated its first 100 years with a match between Tigres and Barcelona in Monterrey. The game ended with the locals losing by 3\u20130. Sindey Balderas of Tigres scored an own goal, Ronaldinho scored with a free kick and later passed to Ei\u00f0ur Gu\u00f0johnsen for a third goal. Tigres finished the Clausura 2007 season as eighth with 23 points, securing play-offs. Tigres lost in quarter-finals against Guadalajara 3\u20131 and 3\u20132 (6\u20133). In December 2007, Tigres hired who would become the last idol of the team, the skilled Argentine attacking midfielder Lucas Lobos. On 19 July 2008, Tigres played Atl\u00e9tico Madrid as their official presentation for the Apertura 2008 tournament. Atl\u00e9tico opened the score with goals from John Heitinga and Diego Forl\u00e1n for a sturdy 2\u20130 in favour of the Spanish side. Tigres responded well to this for Blas P\u00e9rez and Manuel Viniegra tied the game 2\u20132. In the Apertura 2008, under the command of Manuel Lapuente, Tigres ended the tournament as sixth place and qualified for the play-offs. They tied in the quarter-finals against Atlante 1\u20131 and 1\u20131 (2\u20132), though Atlante progressed to semi-finals because they finished the regular season higher than Tigres, in third place. ===Risk of relegation, Third Ferretti era and the Team of the Decade=== In 2010, Santiago Mart\u00ednez presided over the team's worst season in the past few years. On 27 March 2010, after their seventh loss in the season, and with only 25% effectiveness, the fans and media heavily criticized coach Daniel Guzm\u00e1n. Eventually, Mart\u00ednez was fired and replaced by a former president of the team, Alejandro Rodr\u00edguez. He signed Ricardo Ferretti as the head coach for the third time, upon which the face of the team changed completely. Tigres was saved from relegation and became one of the most competitive teams in the league. With the adherence of Argentine winger Dami\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez, Brazilian attacking midfielder Danilinho and Chilean striker H\u00e9ctor Mancilla to captain Lucas Lobos, the offensive line of Tigres became the so-called \"Cuatro Fant\u00e1sticos\" (\"Fantastic Four\"). Lucas Lobos was of great importance in achieving the 2011 Apertura title, ending 29 years of drought without title. In the Clausura 2011 season, Tigres finished the tournament as leader with 35 points and as the best defence in the history of the short seasons, allowing only 9 goals in 17 games. Tigres faced Guadalajara in the postseason. In the first leg of the quarter-finals, Tigres lost 3\u20131, while in the second they tied to 1\u20131 at the Estadio Universitario. With an aggregate score of 4\u20132, Tigres was eliminated. On the Apertura 2011, Tigres hired Carlos Salcido and was the best defense again, this time allowing 13 goals in 17 games. In playoffs, they faced old rival Pachuca: In the first leg of quarter-finals, Tigres defeated Pachuca by 1\u20130, while in the second they won 3\u20130 at the Estadio Universitario for an aggregate score of 4\u20130. In the semi-finals, Tigres beat Quer\u00e9taro 1\u20130 in the second leg after a 0\u20130 draw in the first. In the finals, they faced Santos Laguna. In the first leg, Tigres won 1\u20130 in Torre\u00f3n with goal from Dami\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez. On 11 December 2011, with goals from H\u00e9ctor Mancilla, Danilinho and Alan Pulido, Tigres won 3\u20131 at the Estadio Universitario, becoming champion for the third time after 29 years. For the Clausura 2012, Tigres hired Brazilian forward Edno and midfielder Elias Hern\u00e1ndez. The season ended with Tigres in fifth place, securing postseason. In the quarter-finals, they beat Monarcas Morelia 1\u20130 at the Estadio Universitario with a goal from H\u00e9ctor Mancilla, while in the second leg, they triumphed 4\u20131 in Morelia with goals from Hugo Ayala, Edno, Lucas Lobos and Elias Hern\u00e1ndez; the aggregate score was 5\u20131. In semi-finals, they faced old rival Santos Laguna; in the first leg, at the Estadio Universitario, the teams drew 1\u20131, with Lobos scoring for Tigres. In the second, after a total domain of Tigres, and winning 2\u20130 with goals of Mancilla, Santos tied dramatically 2\u20132 with goals from Oribe Peralta in the 87th and 90th minutes. With an aggregate score of 3\u20133, Santos progressed to the next phase because they had finished the regular season in first place. In the Apertura 2012, Tigres replaced H\u00e9ctor Mancilla with Spanish forward Luis Garc\u00eda. Tigres finished in 12th place, thus missing playoffs. Tigres against Xolos de Tijuana in 2011 Tigres brought in experienced Argentine striker Emanuel Villa while Danilinho returned from his loan to Brazil, giving the team a highly offensive power for the Clausura 2013 season. The regular season ended with Tigres as the leader with 35 points and only two defeats. Quer\u00e9taro was the eighth-placed and meant to be the rival of Tigres, but was relegated to Ascenso MX, so Monterrey was dragged to postseason. In the away leg of quarter-finals, Monterrey defeated Tigres 1\u20130 in a game where Monterrey had less ball possession and offensive plays. In the second game, Tigres had to win by 1\u20130 or by a two-goal advantage because of the away goals rule (3\u20131, 4\u20132, 5\u20133). Tigres came out aggressive and Danilinho scored a goal early in the game. Minutes later, with a game totally handled by Tigres, Israel Jim\u00e9nez scored an own goal that tied the game at 1\u20131, and Tigres lost with an aggregate score of 2\u20131. For the Apertura 2013 tournament, Tigres hired midfielders Guido Pizarro and \u00c9dgar Lugo. Finishing the tournament in eight place, the team went to playoffs. In quarter-finals, they faced Am\u00e9rica, leaders of the tournament and reigning champions. In the home game at the Estadio Universitario, they tied by 2\u20132, with Guido Pizarro and Alan Pulido scoring for Tigres. In the away game, at the Estadio Azteca, the teams drew at 1\u20131, leaving Tigres out of the postseason. After the game, coach Ricardo Ferretti criticized the work of the referee, claiming that Am\u00e9rica is the only team in the world that \"plays with 12 men\". Tigres hired Colombian winger Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo Burban, defender Jorge Iv\u00e1n Estrada and Argentine striker Emanuel Herrera for the Clausura 2014 tournament, but finished the season in 14th place, missing the playoffs. On 9 April 2014, Tigres won the Clausura 2014 Copa MX against Alebrijes de Oaxaca 3\u20130 at the Estadio Universitario. Ricardo Ferretti became the first coach in Mexico to win a league and cup title with the same team. By winning the Clausura 2014 Copa MX, Tigres secured the Supercopa MX and faced Monarcas Morelia, winners of the Apertura 2013 Copa MX. Tigres lost the 2014 Supercopa MX against Morelia and failed to qualify to the following year's Copa Libertadores as \"Mexico 3\". For the Apertura 2014 tournament, Tigres hired the Argentine goalkeeper Nahuel Guzm\u00e1n, American striker Herculez Gomez, Argentine striker Marco Ruben, Ecuadorian winger Joffre Guerr\u00f3n, young defender Antonio Brise\u00f1o and the international Uruguayan midfielder Egidio Ar\u00e9valo R\u00edos.

On 14 December, in the second game, Tigres lost 3\u20130 at the Estadio Azteca in a controversial match where Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo Burbano, Dami\u00e1n \u00c1lvarez and goalkeeper Nahuel Guzm\u00e1n were sent off on red cards, leaving Tigres with eight men. Tigres lost the finals by an aggregate of 3\u20131.

Tigres finished the season in fifth place with 28 points, best defense allowing 16 goals and securing playoffs. Gignac scored 11 goals in the regular season, the highest number for a Tigres player in the first season.

On 19 May 2005, both teams tied (away, score: 1\u20131) and then, Tigres won on the second game on 26 May 2005 (home, score: 2\u20131) thus qualifying to quarter-finals against S\u00e3o Paulo, who later went on to become champion, and who only lost a match in this tournament against this team. In the Quarter-Finals, the first game on 1 June 2005 was lost (away, score: 0\u20134) and the next game on 15 June 2005 was won (home, score: 2\u20131).

In January 2006, after defeating their arch-rival, Monterrey, at the Home Depot Center in California, Tigres won their second consecutive Interliga and became the first Mexican team to qualify to two consecutive Copa Libertadores de Am\u00e9rica. In this edition, Tigres faced the Universidad Cat\u00f3lica from Chile, the Corinthians, from Brazil, and Deportivo Cali, of Colombia. This was a tougher group stage than they had had the previous year, and was one of the toughest in the tournament. However, Tigres qualified for the next round, but only by goal-difference advantage, and after a last minute goal by Carlos Ram\u00edrez. Because of its intensity, this group staged produced a lot of memorable games, particularly against Universidad Cat\u00f3lica and against Corinthians at home and away. Tigres ended second in the group due to goal difference advantage, in a last minute goal against Universidad Cat\u00f3lica, and so qualified again for play-offs. In summary, Tigres played 8 games and produced 3 wins, 3 ties, and two defeats. This performance at the beginning was considerably lacking, and it produced its first penalty kicks experience in Copa Libertadores. On 5 August 2009, Tigres won the final of the 2009 North American SuperLiga against the Chicago Fire at their home stadium in the Chicago's suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois. After finishing 3rd in the regular season of the Apertura 2011 Tournament, they returned after a 6-year absence to the 2012 Copa Libertadores, playing in the first stage. Tigres played home and away qualifying matches against Chile's Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola. They played the first match in Chile, on 25 January 2012 at 6:50pm local time (3:50pm CST). Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola took the first game by a score of 1\u20130, scoring at the 58th minute, after Tigres sent a reserve squad to play the match. They hosted their Chilean rival on 2 February 2012, at 8:00 pm CST. They tied 2\u20132 and failed to qualify for the Group Stage. Coach Ricardo Ferretti was criticized by the media and fans for sending a reserve squad to play the matches. After the championship of the Apertura 2011, Tigres qualified for the first time to the CONCACAF Champions League. They lost in quarterfinals against Seattle Sounders by 1\u20130, 3\u20131, for an aggregate of 2\u20133. Ferretti was criticized again for sending a reserve squad to play the second match against the Sounders like he did in the Copa Libertadores. ====Copa Libertadores 2015==== By finishing the regular season of the Apertura 2014 as second place with 31 units, Tigres advanced to Copa Libertadores 2015 as Mexico 1 to play in Group 6 against River Plate, San Jos\u00e9 and Juan Aurich.

Tigres before the match against Emelec Tigres, first place of the group and already qualified to the next phase, sent a reserve squad. The decision was heavily criticized by the Argentinian press, that stated that River Plate would not get to the second stage if Tigres lost against Juan Aurich.

Since the foundation of the club in 1960, its distinctive colors are light gold and dark blue. In the home jersey, light gold is always predominant over dark blue, but in the away jersey, it is the opposite, the dark blue is predominant. The third colour has been inconsistent, sometimes presented as black, white, red, green, copper or dark gold. ===Rivalry=== Tigres' biggest rival is Monterrey. Their derby is called Cl\u00e1sico Regiomontano. On every Cl\u00e1sico the stadium is sold out as soon as tickets go on sale. It is known for being one of the most intense and competed derbies in Mexican football, and is widely regarded as the most important Mexican derby after the Cl\u00e1sico Nacional. Tigres and Monterrey played their first Cl\u00e1sico on 13 July 1974 at the Estadio Universitario, game that ended with a 3\u20133 draw. The teams played a historical final for the Liga MX championship of the Apertura 2017 season. In the first leg the teams tied by 1\u20131 at the Estadio Universitario. In the Estadio BBVA Bancomer, Tigres beat Monterrey by 2\u20131 with goals of Edu Vargas and Francisco Meza, winning the first league final between the two. In 2019, Tigres lost the final of the CONCACAF Champions League against Monterrey. ===Fanbase=== Tigres claims to have Mexico's most loyal supporting crowd. Every season Tigres play in front of a sold-out Estadio Universitario due to their over 39,000 season-ticket holders. Since the reactivation of the domestic cup (Copa MX) in 2012, the Estadio Universitario has registered a full attendance in the cup games as well. After getting relegated and made all of their games Local-PPV in 1996, fans continued their unwavering support during the year it took the club to achieve promotion back to Liga MX. It was the only team in the Ascenso MX that registered a full attendance for every home game during that entire year. Its fan base expands to other states such as Coahuila, Durango, San Luis Potos\u00ed, Tamaulipas, Veracruz and Texas. Several Mexican sports media have ranked the Tigres' fans as the best in the Liga MX, citing their loyalty during the club's bad streaks. The fans, nicknamed \"Incomparables\" (Incomparable ones), are the best known travelling support group due to the thousands of members chanting for the team in the away games. Founded in 1998, Libres y Lokos are the biggest group of ultras of the club. On 9 March 2013, over 23,000 fans traveled to the city of San Luis Potos\u00ed to support the team in a game against San Luis FC at the Estadio Alfonso Lastras. ==Season to season== {|
