    "text": "Sabrina D. Harman (born January 5, 1978) is a war criminal and former United States Army reservist, one of several persons convicted by the U.S. Army in connection with the 2003\u20132004 Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal in Baghdad, Iraq, during and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Harman and several other soldiers were tried for allowing and inflicting sexual, physical, and psychological abuse of Iraqi prisoners of war. Harman held the rank of specialist in the 372nd Military Police Company during her tour of duty in Iraq. She was sentenced to six months in prison, reduction in rank and a bad conduct discharge. Harman was imprisoned in the Naval Consolidated Brig, Miramar in San Diego, California.Siegel, Andrea F. \"Convicted reservist testifies.\" The Baltimore Sun. July 17, 2005. Retrieved on July 18, 2010. ==Early life and education== Harman was born in Lorton, Virginia. Her father was a homicide detective, and the family often saw photos of dead people at crime scenes. Harman's mother, Robin, has been described as a \"forensics buff.\" Harman graduated from Robert E. Lee High School in Springfield, Virginia. ==Career== Sabrina Harman and Charles Graner in Abu Ghraib After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Harman joined the Army Reserves and was assigned to the Cresaptown, Maryland-based 372nd Military Police company. Harman worked for a time as an assistant manager at Papa John's Pizza in Alexandria, Virginia, before her company was activated for duty in Iraq in February 2003, and was deployed to Fort Lee, Virginia for additional training; however, this was in combat support, not I/R (military jargon for \"internment and resettlement.\"). While Harman acknowledged that she knew there was a lot of wrong being done, she claims she knew nothing about there being any official rules about prisoner treatment (i.e., the Geneva Conventions). ===Harman's response=== * A letter home quoted in The New Yorker: * As quoted in The Washington Post: > [She] said she was assigned to break down prisoners for interrogation. \"They > would bring in one to several prisoners at a time already hooded and > cuffed,\" Harman said in interviews by e-mail this week from Baghdad. \"The > job of the MP was to keep them awake, make it hell so they would talk.\" She > said her military police unit took direction from the military intelligence > officers in charge of the facility and from civilian contractors there who > conducted interrogations. *At her sentencing: > As a soldier and military police officer, I failed my duties and failed my > mission to protect and defend. I not only let down the people in Iraq, but I > let down every single soldier that serves today. My actions potentially > caused an increased hatred and insurgency towards the United States, putting > soldiers and civilians at greater risk. I take full responsibility for my > actions. ... The decisions I made were mine and mine alone. ==Citings== Harman's attorney said he hoped to see the military chain of command put on trial, rather than low-ranking reservists like Harman. \"I don't think we can even begin to imagine the kind of environment that she was in. First of all, she wasn't trained to be a prison guard, so she didn't even know the basic rules. She wasn't trained in military intelligence. I don't think any American can really truly appreciate the stress that existed along with the fact they were undermanned and not trained to perform this mission,\" he said. ==See also== *Megan Ambuhl *Lynndie England *Ivan Frederick *Charles Graner *Jeremy Sivits *Death of Manadel al-Jamadi *Standard Operating Procedure (film) ==References== ==Further reading== * \" She's No Stranger To Grisly Images.\" CBS: 10 May 2004. 18 June 2004. * Spinner, Jackie. \"Soldier: Unit's Role Was to Break Down Prisoners.\" The Washington Post: 8 May 2004. 18 June 2004. * Gourevitch, Philip and Errol Morris.
