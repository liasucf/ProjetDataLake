However, the Japanese meaning of the two kanji used for the name mean \"deep inside/innermost\" and \"buttocks/hips\". ==History== On July 12, 1993, the Southwest Hokkaido Open Sea earthquake (\u5317\u6d77\u9053\u5357\u897f\u6c96\u5730\u9707) of magnitude 7.8 in the Sea of Japan off southwest Hokkaido created a devastating tsunami. This tsunami killed 198 people in the town, despite a tsunami warning system and a seawall, and also caused landslides on the hills above. Another 32 people were missing, including 3 in Russia and 129 were injured. The subsequent fire burned down much of what remained. The island was reshaped by the tsunami, which was 10 meters high in town. The tsunami struck within five minutes of the earthquake, leaving residents absolutely no warning. *1906: The village of Okushiri was founded. *1966: Okushiri Village became Okushiri Town. *1993: Southwest Hokkaido Open Sea earthquake occurred. ==Transportation== Okushiri Island is accessible by air or sea. Okushiri Airport serves the island with daily flights to and from Hakodate Airport.
