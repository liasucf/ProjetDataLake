    "text": "{| |} The Isotta Fraschini Beta was an air cooled aircraft engine produced by the Italian engineering company Isotta Fraschini in the 1940s. ==Design and development== The Isotta Fraschini derived the Beta inverted 6-cylinder in- line aircraft engine from the Gamma, with which it shared its bore and stroke. The engine had a one-piece aluminium alloy crankcase with steel and aluminium cylinders, each with a single inlet and a single exhaust valve. It had a carburettor designed by Isotta Fraschini and a single speed supercharger. It was produced in small numbers and fitted to a number of Italian training aircraft, including the Nardi FN.316 used in limited quantities by the Regia Aeronautica, Aeronautica Nazionale Repubblicana and German Luftwaffe during World War II. ==Variants== ;Beta R.C.10 ISZ: for take-off at ==Applications== * CANSA C.6 * IMAM Ro.63 * Nardi FN.316 * Ambrosini SAI.7 ==Specifications== ==See also== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * Category:Aircraft air-cooled inline piston engines Category:1940s aircraft piston engines Category:Inline-six engines Beta ",
