Voter turnout was 95.0%, although this figure represents the turnout in the 25 constituencies to be contested,Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume II, p255 with PAP candidates earning walkovers in the other 41; this was the second general election, after the 1968, where PAP returned to power on nomination day due to a majority of walkovers; a collaborative effort amongst all the opposition parties headed by Chiam See Tong decided to not contest all seats, so as to reassure voters to vote in ease for the opposition, known as a \"by-election effect\". This was to date, the only election, where no Non-constituency Member of Parliament seats were offered, as the four seats won by the opposition is more than the minimum number of oppositions at three. ==Background== This was the inaugural election for Prime Minister and current PAP secretary-general Goh Chok Tong after then-Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew stepped down on November 28, 1990. Goh decided to call a snap election merely three years after the last election to court a fresh mandate, setting Parliament's shortest term ever. An unprecedented four seats were won by the opposition, the biggest number since the 1963 election, and its share of votes fell for the third consecutive time since 1984, down to then-lowest share of 61.0%. The Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) had eight out of nine candidates came in among the top ten opposition candidates, with the party added two more spoils to the seat as well as retaining Potong Pasir SMC by leader Chiam See Tong in a record-69.6% vote, clocking in then the best performance for an opposition party at the time of the election at 48.6% of the votes and becoming the main opposition party in Parliament. The Workers' Party of Singapore (WP) made its second in- road into the legislature with the victory of its organizing secretary Low Thia Khiang (who previously contested Tiong Bahru GRC in the last election and Hougang SMC on this election), who would years later become WP secretary- general and leader (2001-2018). All three incumbents who were defeated in the election were one-term MPs including Seet Ai Mee, Ng Pock Too and Tang Guan Seng; only Tang returned to the 1997 election as a member in Ang Mo Kio GRC. At a post-election press conference on the night of 31 August, Goh glumly attributed the loss to his \"open and consultative style of government\" and pledged to re-evaluate his style. Since the introduction of the Non- Constituency Member of Parliament scheme in 1984, this was the first (and to date the only) election no NCMP seats were offered since four elected opposition seats exceeded the minimum of three NCMP seats allotted; the narrow defeat of WP's Eunos GRC team, helmed by Lee Siew Choh again, did not see to Lee's return as NCMP as a result. This was Lee's final legislature and electoral presence as he resigned from WP and retired from politics in 1993. The maximum of six Nominated MPs were appointed for this term, up from two Nominated MPs previously. Goh would later went to call an by-election for his constituency (Marine Parade GRC) in the following year to court another fresh mandate and paving the chance for J. B. Jeyaretnam to participate in the by- election after his ban expiring that year. ==Timeline== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Date !Event |- |8 August|| Publication of Electoral Boundaries report |- |14 August||Dissolution of 7th Parliament |- |21 August||Nomination Day |- |31 August||Polling day |- |6 January 1992||Opening of 8th Parliament |} ==Electoral boundaries== ===Existing GRCs=== Another group of changes were necessary as it increased from three seats to four.
