She hopes to find his former business partner, Thomas Putnam, to gain some kind of understanding or explanation. In the meantime, Roger Mansfield, a British businessman, marries a Japanese girl who is pregnant with his child. Roger one day encounters Sheryl and, after listening to her, volunteers to use his contacts in the city to help her locate Putnam if he can. Roger expresses his desire for Sheryl, who is unaware that he has a wife. A blackmailer turns up wanting money from Roger, threatening to reveal that he and Putnam are one and the same. Sheryl overhears him being called \"Tom\" and suspects the truth. Roger goes on a rampage, beating his wife, causing her to lose the baby and driving her to suicide. Roger burns down the house and flees, but, when caught, falls on his own knife. ==Cast== * Martha Hyer as Sheryl * Byron Michie as Roger ==References== ==External links== * * * http://orientalevil.pro Category:1951 films Category:Foreign films shot in Japan Category:1951 drama films Category:American black-and-white films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films produced by George Breakston Category:Films directed by George Breakston Category:Films scored by Albert Glasser Category:Films set in Japan Category:Japan in non-Japanese culture ",
