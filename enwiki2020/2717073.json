    "text": "Forbes Ernest Phillipson-Masters (born 14 November 1955) is an English former footballer who played in the Football League as a central defender for Southampton, Exeter City, Bournemouth, Luton Town, Plymouth Argyle and Bristol City. ==Playing career== Phillipson-Masters was born in Bournemouth. He originally signed with Southampton as an apprentice goalkeeper in August 1972, but was given a free transfer two years later by Lawrie McMenemy. John McGrath, then Saints' youth team coach, persuaded the player to try his luck in the centre-half position. The conversion was successful, and, after playing nine times for the Saints first team, and spending spells on loan to Exeter City, A.F.C. Bournemouth and Luton Town, Phillipson-Masters was sold to Plymouth Argyle for \u00a350,000 in 1979, where he was to make over a hundred league appearances. He went on to Bristol City, where he made nearly another hundred, before winding up his career with a season with Yeovil Town. ==Later career== In 1987, he moved into non-League football management in the Dorset area, and now has his own building company in Verwood, Dorset. ==Personal life== Ollie Phillipson-Masters, son of Forbes, has played for Bournemouth \"Poppies\" F.C. of the Wessex League since August 2009.Player profile: Ollie Phillipson-Masters Bournemouth Poppies F.C. official website ==References== ==External links== * League stats at Neil Brown's site Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Bournemouth Category:English footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Southampton F.C. players Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:AFC Bournemouth players Category:Luton Town F.C. players Category:Plymouth Argyle F.C. players Category:Bristol City F.C. players Category:Yeovil Town F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:House painters ",
