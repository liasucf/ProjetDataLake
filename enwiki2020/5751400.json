Despite knowing the ruling of Islam towards the intoxicating drink, an-Nuayman struggled with breaking his addiction, and was flogged twice for drinking. During the second incident one of the companions of the Prophet, Said \"La 'nat Allah alayhi - may God's curse be on him.\" The Prophet heard this and responded with \"No, no, don't do (such a thing). Indeed he loves God and His Apostle. The major sin does not put one outside the community and the mercy of God is close to the believers.\" ==References== ==External links== *biography from MSA West Compendium of Muslim Texts.
