    "text": "Eduard Prugove\u010dki (March 19, 1937 - October 13, 2003) was a Canadian physicist and mathematician of Croatian-Romanian descent. Prugove\u010dki was born in Craiova, Romania to a Romanian mother, Helena (n\u00e9e Piatkowski), and Croatian father, Slavoljub. He completed the first four years of secondary education in Bucharest, before his family was forced to relocate to Zagreb in 1951, due to an anti-Yugoslav campaign by the communist authorities. He finished high school there and proceeded to study physics at the University of Zagreb, getting his diploma in 1959. He joined the Department of Theoretical Physics at the Institute Ru\u0111er Bo\u0161kovi\u0107 in Zagreb, where he worked as a research assistant until 1961. In 1961, as the best student of his generation in Zagreb, Prugove\u010dki was sent to Princeton University, New Jersey, United States. He wrote his doctoral thesis under the direction of theoretical physicist Arthur Wightman, and earned his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1964. In 1965, he moved to Canada, where he first spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in Edmonton, Alberta, and then a year as a lecturer at the University of Alberta. He taught physics at the University of Toronto from 1967 to 1997. In 1974, he spent one year as a visiting professor at the Centre national de la recherche scientifique in Marseille, France. Around 1986 he resigned from his membership in the International Association of Mathematical Physics. His research interests were quantum field theory, unification of theory of relativity and quantum theory and quantum gravity. He introduced the concept of informational completeness. In 1998 he retired to live in Honey Harbour, Ontario. Prugove\u010dki died at the age of 66 at his home at Lake Chapala, Mexico. ==References== ==Works== *Quantum Mechanics in Hilbert Space, Academic Press 1971, *Stochastic Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Spacetime, Kluwer 1984, *Quantum Geometry, Kluwer 1992 *Principles of Quantum General Relativity, World Scientific 1995, * Janko Herak (editor), Distinguished Croatian Scientists in America, Part Two, ==External links== * * List of publications Category:1937 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th-century mathematicians Category:Canadian mathematicians Category:Canadian physicists Category:Canadian people of Romanian descent Category:Canadian people of Croatian descent Category:Croatian physicists Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Romanian emigrants to Canada Category:Romanian mathematicians Category:Romanian physicists Category:Romanian people of Croatian descent Category:University of Alberta faculty Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:Faculty of Science, University of Zagreb alumni Category:People from Craiova Category:People from Toronto ",
