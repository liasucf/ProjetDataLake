    "text": "The 2016\u201317 Campeonato de Portugal (also known as Campeonato de Portugal Prio, for sponsorship reasons) was the fourth season of Portuguese football's renovated third-tier league, since the merging of the Second and Third Divisions in 2013, and the second season under the current Campeonato de Portugal title. A total of 80 teams compete in this division, which began on 20 August 2016 and ended on 18 June 2017. ==Format== The competition format consists of two stages. In the first stage, the 80 clubs were divided in eight series of 10 teams, according to geographic criteria. The only exceptions were teams from Madeira, which were placed in the first series, and teams from the Azores, which were distributed through the latter series. In each series, teams play against each other in a home-and-away double round-robin system. In the second stage, the two best-placed teams from each first-stage series were divided in two groups of eight teams, again according to geographic proximity, with home-and-away matches. The two group winners secured promotion to the LigaPro. To determine the overall division champion, the group winners contested a one-off grand final on a neutral ground. On 15 March 2016, the LPFP announced that four teams (instead of three) would be relegated to the 2017\u201318 Campeonato de Portugal, and two teams (instead of three) would be promoted directly from the Campeonato de Portugal to reduce the number of LigaPro teams to 20 for the 2017\u201318 season. There would also be a two-legged promotion/relegation play-off involving the 17th- and 18th-placed teams of 2016\u201317 LigaPro and both second-placed teams of the Campeonato de Portugal promotion groups (North and South). The remaining eight clubs from each first- stage series were divided into eight groups of eight teams, with home-and-away matches, but there was a reshuffle so that teams from Series A, C, E and G ending the first stage from seventh to tenth were placed in the second stage's Series B, D, F and H and vice versa. Each teams only conserved 25% of first- stage points. The bottom-two teams from each group were relegated to the District Championships. The sixth-placed teams were paired into four two- legged play-out ties, with the four winners being paired into two further two- legged play-out ties. All six play-out losers were also relegated. ==Teams== Relegated from the 2015\u201316 LigaPro: * Farense * Mafra * Atl\u00e9tico CP * Oriental * Oliveirense From the 2015\u201316 Campeonato de Portugal: * Bragan\u00e7a * Vilaverdense * Mar\u00edtimo B * Pedras Salgadas * Mirandela * Limianos * Camacha * AD Oliveirense * Torcatense * S\u00e3o Martinho * Felgueiras 1932 * Trofense * Gondomar * Pedras Rubras * Salgueiros * Sousense * Cinf\u00e3es * Amarante * Coimbr\u00f5es * Estarreja * Anadia * Sanjoanense * Cesarense * Lusitano de Vildemoinhos * Mort\u00e1gua * Gafanha * Praiense * Angrense * Oper\u00e1rio * Sporting Ideal * Acad\u00e9mica \u2013 SF * Pampilhosa * Tourizense * AD Nogueirense * Benfica e Castelo Branco * Uni\u00e3o de Leiria * Alcanenense * Caldas * Vit\u00f3ria de Sernache * Sertanense * Naval 1\u00ba de Maio * Casa Pia * 1.\u00ba Dezembro * Sintrense * Atl\u00e9tico da Malveira * Loures * Real * Torreense * Sacavenense * Moura * Almancilense * Barreirense * Lusitano VRSA * Pinhalnovense * Louletano Promoted from the 2015\u201316 District Championships: * Algarve FA: Armacenenses * Aveiro FA: Recreio de \u00c1gueda * Beja FA: Mineiro Aljustrelense * Braga FA: Merelinense * Bragan\u00e7a FA: Torre de Moncorvo (\u00c1guia de Vimioso declined the promotion) * Castelo Branco FA: Oleiros (Sporting da Covilh\u00e3 B declined the promotion) * Coimbra FA: Carapinheirense * \u00c9vora FA: Sporting de Viana do Alentejo * Guarda FA: Gouveia * Leiria FA: Gin\u00e1sio de Alcoba\u00e7a * Lisboa FA: Vilafranquense * Madeira FA: Cani\u00e7al * Portalegre FA: Gafetense (Mosteirense declined the promotion) * Porto FA: Alian\u00e7a de Gandra * Santar\u00e9m FA: F\u00e1tima * Set\u00fabal FA: Fabril do Barreiro * Viana do Castelo FA: Ponte da Barca * Vila Real FA: Montalegre * Viseu FA: Moimenta da Beira * Azores League: Lusit\u00e2nia ==First stage== === Serie A === === Serie B === === Serie C === === Serie D === === Serie E === === Serie F === === Serie G === === Serie H === ==Second stage== ===Promotion groups=== ====North zone==== ====South zone==== ===Promotion play-off=== ===Final=== ===Relegation groups=== ==== Serie A ==== ==== Serie B ==== ==== Serie C ==== ==== Serie D ==== ==== Serie E ==== ==== Serie F ==== ====Serie G==== ====Serie H==== ===Relegation play-out=== ====First round==== Carapinheirense lost 2\u20130 on aggregate and were relegated. \\---- Angrense lost 3\u20132 on aggregate and were relegated. \\---- Mineiro Aljustrelense lost 2\u20131 on aggregate and were relegated. \\---- Atl\u00e9tico CP lost 1\u20130 on aggregate and were relegated. ====Second round==== 2\u20132 on aggregate.
