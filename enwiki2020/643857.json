    "text": "The term \"Trekking Peak\" is a commonly misunderstood colloquial term which may refer to a variety of types of peaks in the Himalayan Region. The term is most often associated with Group \"B\" NMA Climbing Peaks classified by the Nepal Mountaineering Association or easier.http://project-himalaya.com/info- trekking-peaks.html Some may use the term \"Trekking Peak\" to solely describe peaks requiring little to no technical climbing experience. Others may use the term to describe all mountains regulated by the Nepal Mountaineering Association including Group \"A\" NMA Expedition Peaks which may require considerable difficulties and technical climbing skill.http://peakware.com/peaks.php?pk=941 Because of the term's loose classification of peaks it can be misleading, encompassing peaks of significant varying difficulties. There is less general consensus for the use of the term in this context of Group \"A\" NMA Expedition Peaks. ==Nepal== There is currently a total of 15 Group \"B\" NMA Climbing Peaks.http://www.nepalmountaineering.org/noticespage-13-NMA%20Peaks These peaks do not exceed in elevation and can be reasonably climbed from a base camp with the possible use of a high camp. To be climbed, these peaks typically require an amount of mountaineering experience and skills and the use of specialized mountaineering equipment, such as crampons and ice axes. The easiest routes to the summits of these mountains are all challenging enough to warrant a mountaineering difficulty grade by the International French Adjectival System. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"caption- side:bottom; color:#000000;\"|*A number of these peaks remain rarely climbed and therefore do not have clear associated climbing grades. ! align=left|Group \"B\" NMA Climbing Peaks || AKA || Elevation || Grade* || Himal |- | Singu Chuli || Fluted Peak|| || AD ? || Annapurna |- | Mera Peak || || || PD || Khumbu |- | Kusum Kanguru || || || D+ ? || Khumbu |- | Kwandge || Kongde Ri || || D ? || Khumbu |- |Chulu West|| || || PD- || Manang |- |Imja_Tse|| Island Peak || || PD+ || Khumbu |- | Pharchamo || || || ? || Rolwaling |- | Lobuje || Lobuche || || PD+ || Khumbu |- | Ramdung || || || ? || Rolwaling |- | Pisang Peak || || || PD || Manang |- | Chulu East || || || PD- || Damodar |- | Khongma-tse || Mehar Peak || || ? || Khumbu |- | Ganja-la Chuli || Naya Kanga || || PD+ || Langtang |- | Paldor Peak || || || F+ || Langtang |- | Hiunchuli || || || ? || Annapurna |} In Nepal there are numerous peaks that require no technical expertise to climb, which may also be considered trekking peaks. These peaks are not tracked by the Nepal Mountaineering Association. Many of these peaks see a substantial number of summits each year by hikers and trekkers in the region without the use of specialized equipment. The routes to the summits of these mountains may not be challenging enough to warrant a mountaineering difficulty grade by the International French Adjectival System. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ style=\"caption-side:bottom; color:#000000;\"|*Peaks without associated climbing grades do not pose enough mountaineering difficulty to meet the minimum standard of an IFAS Alpine grade of F(\"Facil/Easy\") ! align=left|Popular Low/Non-Technical Peaks || AKA || Elevation || Grade* || Himal |- | Yala Peak || || || F+ || Langtang |- | Tharpu Chuli || Tent Peak || || F || Annapurna |- | Tukuche Peak || || || F || Annapurna |- | Pokalde || Dolma Ri || || n/a || Khumbu |- | Gokyo Ri || || || n/a || Khumbu |- | Chhukung Ri || || || n/a || Khumbu |- | Kala Patthar || || || n/a || Khumbu |} ==India== The Indian Mountaineering Foundation describes trekking peaks closer to the true definition of trekking, where peaks have a defined route that requires less technical mountaineering skill.https://www.whitemagicadventure.com/blog/trekking-peaks-india There peaks are open for climbing, where climbers are not required to book permits with or pay royalties to the Indian Mountaineering Foundation. Although some peaks are located in inner line, meaning close to border thus due to security reason, permissions and permits may be required from local civil or army authorities. Also, some peaks may be out of reach from foreign climbers. The Indian Mountaineering Foundation has designated 3 trekking peaks in the Indian Himalayan Region. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! align=left|IMF trekking peaks || Elevation || State |- | Friendship Peak || || Himachal Pradesh |- | Ladakhi Peak || || Himachal Pradesh |- | Stok Kangri || || Ladakh |} ==References== Category:Himalayas ",
