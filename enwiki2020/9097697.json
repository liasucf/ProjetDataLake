    "text": "California Music Channel (CMC)United States Patent and Trademark Office IC 035, 038, 041 is an American music video broadcast television network based in the San Francisco Bay Area.Billboard, September 5, 1987 p. 57 It is one of the longest running local music video television stations in the world. CMC has been broadcasting the hottest music videos over the air in the Bay Area since 1982. Over the past 38 years, CMC has grown from an hour-long program to two 24/7 stations with digital simulcast capabilities. CMC has constantly been adapting with the technologies of the world to figure out new ways to enrich the lives of their loyal audience. The live broadcasts feature on-camera disc jockeys, audience participation, and contemporary music videos. It is owned by CMC Broadcasting Company, Inc. CMC is carried as a Digital Broadcast Network on thirteen Northern California television stations originating from KKPM. == History == ===1981-1982=== CMC was founded on August 31, 1981, by Rick Kurkjian, debuting on March 1, 1982, as a half-hour show telecast twelve times per week on Teleprompter Cable Oakland Channel 12. The notion of a Bay Area Interconnect was developed early on as CMC expanded by doing local original cable channels on Concord TV Cable Ch. 11, Viacom Cable of San Francisco Ch 6, Viacom of Marin and Castro Valley Cable TV. After a little more than a year on the local cable channels CMC started running a Saturday night version of the program on KCSM-TV Ch 60 in San Mateo. The CMC broadcast was simulcast in stereo on KCSM-TV's sister station, KCSM-FM 91.1. ===1983=== In 1983, KCSM-TV was one of a handful of educational-access television stations to experiment with running expanded underwriting announcements and full 30-second commercial TV spots from non-profit organizations. In addition to the U.S. Army, many of its other advertisers were coincidentally set up as non-profit organizations under dealer associations and franchise organizations such as the California Milk Advisory Board and the McDonald's \"Golden Arches Advertising Fund\". As such, CMC was able to include commercials for these organizations on the otherwise non-commercial, educational, KCSM. This revenue allowed the show to remain profitable, when other local music video shows were struggling to remain on the air or even on non commercial Public-access television.Rockamerica's Videofile August 1984 p.12 ===1984=== In 1984, the demand from CMC advertisers grew beyond the scope of underwriting announcements and non profit 30s. On October 1, 1984, the California Music Channel debuted its Monday to Friday broadcast on full power independent KTSF- TV where CMC remained through February 23, 2018. ===2016=== In 2016 and 2018 Nielsen Media Research encodes, samples, and reports the San Francisco DMA transmissions of CMC as local broadcast TV station CMC-TV and CMC-USA as station CMCU-TV.Nielsen Answers ===2018=== In 2018, CMC Broadcasting purchased KTVJ-LD channel 6 licensed to Nampa/Boise, Idaho from OMI.Radio+Television Business Report, June 13, 2018 ===2019=== In 2019, Gracenote and other TV listing services classified CMC and CMC-USA as Digital Broadcast Networks.zap2it TV Listings Local Over the Air Broadcast (94111) \"Cruisin' with Chuy\" launched on October 6.
