It is located adjacent to the railway line in western Victoria\u2019s vast wheatbelt 560 upright poles, some 80-foot-long, went into building the cathedral-like structure. Many more poles went into fabricating the roof trusses and bracing. The slender mountain ash poles were probably salvaged from native forests at Powelltown, Noojee and Erica burnt during the 1939 bushfires.Forests Commission Victoria Annual report The Murtoa Stick Shed, as it became known, is 870 feet long, 198 feet wide and 62 feet 10 inches high at the ridge, covering an area of 170,000 square feet and with a capacity of 3.4 million bushels or 95,000 tonnes. Australia experienced a wheat glut in the late 1930s as traditional export markets of Great Britain and Western Europe evaporated due to a shift in world trade and restrictions to shipping. By the outbreak of the War in 1939, the Australian wheat industry produced between 150 and 160 million bushels per year, of which 100 million had been traditionally exported. But only 48 of the 160 silos planned under the 1935 Victorian Silo Scheme had been completed. The Murtoa Stick Shed was hurriedly built over four months between September 1941 and January 1942 and filled with grain within six months of its construction. The wheat stayed in storage until 1944. It was the first emergency bulk wheat storage shed built in Victoria and is the only one remaining of its type in Australia. Wartime shortages meant the builders had to rely upon and adapt traditional bush construction techniques. It\u2019s claimed to be the largest \u201crustically-built\u201d structure in the world. The Forests Commission Victoria (FCV) produced over half a million lineal feet of poles from State forests mainly for emergency storage of wheat in 1941/42.

It was a 'temporary' grain shed, 270m long and 60m wide, built in late 1941 and early 1942, using 560 unmilled mountain ash tree trunks. [Australian heritage site: Murtoa No 1 Grain StoreA second and much larger Stick Shed, with double the capacity, was erected in 1942/43 at Murtoa using poles largely supplied from forests at East Gippsland and Beaufort. This second shed was demolished in 1975. The Murtoa Stick Shed No 1 became increasingly expensive to maintain and was eventually phased out of service from 1989. The building was listed on the Australian National Heritage List in 2014, recognising its place \"as a significant part of Australia\u2019s history associated with Australia\u2019s wheat industry and the impact of World War Two on the home front\". ==References== ==External links== *Murtoa No.1 Grain Store - National Heritage Listed - Department of Environment and Energy *The Stick Shed - Official website Category:Australian National Heritage List Category:Wimmera Category:1942 establishments in Australia Category:Buildings and structures in Victoria (Australia) ",
