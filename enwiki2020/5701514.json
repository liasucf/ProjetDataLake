An advertising executive by profession, Kender entered the Estonian literary scene in 1998 with his debut novel \"Independence Day\" (\"Iseseisvusp\u00e4ev\"). His writing is as controversial and provocative as his own life and personality \u2013 he has once said that sometimes he wishes that truck drivers and prostitutes would write more books because they have unusual stories to tell. Kender provided both input and investment to support his fellow Estonian author Robert Kurvitz first through his novel Sacred and Terrible Air (2013), and then later the development of the video game Disco Elysium, which had become a critical darling and financial success for Kurvitz's development team ZA/UM. ==Bibliography== * Iseseisvusp\u00e4ev (Independence Day) (1998) * Yuppiejumal (Yuppiegod) (1999) * Ebanormaalne (Abnormal) (2000) * L\u00e4bi rahulike silmade (Through Peaceful Eyes) (2001) * Check Out (2001) * Pangapettus (Bank Con) (2002) * Kuidas saada isaks (How to Become a Father) (2003) * Raha (Money) (2002) (together with Rain L\u00f5hmus) * Comeback (2010) ==References== ==External links== * Excerpts from \"Through Peaceful Eyes\" Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:Estonian male novelists Category:20th-century Estonian novelists Category:21st-century Estonian novelists ",
