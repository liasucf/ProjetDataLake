    "text": "Works of authority on the United Kingdom constitution are books written by constitutional theorists that are considered to be authoritative guides to the UK constitution. The United Kingdom has no written overall Constitution, thus these are guides as to the rules and customs of the land. They can be adopted or overridden by acts of Parliament. The most prominent works of authority are: * Walter Bagehot's The English Constitution (1867) * An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution (1885) by A. V. Dicey * A Treatise on the Law, Privileges, Proceedings and Usage of Parliament (popularly known as Parliamentary Practice), first published in 1844, by Erskine May. * The Rule of Law by Lord Bingham The former two are now historical, while the latter two are regularly updated to reflect developments in parliamentary procedure. ==References== ==External links== * An Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution Category:Legal writing Category:Constitution of the United Kingdom Category:British non-fiction literature Category:Wikipedia articles which are legal bibliographies ",
