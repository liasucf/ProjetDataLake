Grabble shut down in 2018.https://www.drapersonline.com/news/mobile-shopping-app-grabble-winds- down/7031307.article ==History== Grabble was originally launched in 2013, by founders Daniel Murray and Joel Freeman, with the idea of curating high street fashion, whereby users could save pieces by \u201cgrabbing\u201d them from both the Grabble website and external retail sites using the \u201cGrab\u201d button. Relaunched in August 2014 as an app for Android and iOS, the app was described as \u201cASOS meets Pinterest, with sales alerts\u201d and \u201cTinder for fashion\u201d, due to the swiping system used to like or dislike a product, and a small editorial team was set up to \u201ccurate items separately to give the app a more exclusive feel.\u201d ==Features== Everything featured on Grabble can be saved to a wish-list and purchased by the user on the app itself. Products can be found through searching brands or categories, however, Grabble encourages the discovery element through curated editorial content. Editorial content consists of stories covering upcoming designers; trend spotting across fashion, interiors, home ware, beauty tutorials; and lifestyle, such as fitness, food, and travel. Grabble offers sale alerts, a daily curated New In section and daily themed collections, where users can swipe left or right on products. Users are able to track their orders and share products or wishlists via email or social media. In 2016, Grabble introduced a rewards scheme for both new and existing users. ==Funding== In February 2015, Grabble closed an Angel funding round whose investors included Skimlinks founder Alex Hoye; Guy Hipwell, former Harrods e-commerce director; Alex Tait, former head of e-commerce at Topshop owner Arcadia; and media guru Darren Childs, chief executive of UKTV. ==Reception== Since launch, Grabble has gained mostly positive reactions and coverage from various British media outlets: InStyle Future Fifteen 2016: Daniel Murray TechCity Insider 100 List (2014) WIRED Europe\u2019s 100 Hottest Start Ups 2016 ==Awards== Drapers Digital Awards 2015: Best Tech Start Up Decoded Fashion Awards 2015: Best Use of Mobile Everline Future 50 2014 Winner 02 Smarta 100 Award 2014: Mobile Business of the Year Shell LiveWIRE Young Entrepreneur of the Year 2014 (Awarded to Daniel Murray) ==References== Category:Mobile social software Category:Online retailers of the United Kingdom Category:Fashion websites ",
