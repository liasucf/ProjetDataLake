Its medium-sized fruit-body (25 cm) hangs from the stem and contain 70-90 individual fruits. ==Distribution and habitat== It is endemic to Seychelles, and was especially common on all the granitic islands. It was formerly extremely common along the coast, and its local name \"Vakwa bordmer\" refers to this habitat preference. However, it has been known to live in more rocky areas at higher altitudes too. It is threatened by habitat loss. Other indigenous Pandanus of the Seychelles include Pandanus sechellarum, Pandanus hornei and Pandanus multispicatus. The Madagascan species Pandanus utilis is introduced and is now also widespread. ==Gallery== File:Pandanus balfourii - Seychelles Botanical Gardens 3.jpg | Detail of the rosette and drooping leaves of Pandanus balfourii.
