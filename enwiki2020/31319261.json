    "text": ":For the American criminal defense lawyer, see William G. Hundley. William Hundley (born 1976) is an American artist born in St. Paul, Minnesota, who lives and works in Austin, Texas. In 2006 he began an ongoing series of photographs that he titled \u201cEntoptic Phenomena\u201d in which he photographs people jumping underneath fabrics and other various materials. The instant of the jump can be thought of as super ephemeral sculpture, lasting only a few seconds before reverting to their base components. The resulting photographs appear to have been made by computer manipulation, but Hundley stresses that \u201cthey are just photographs\u201d and that there were absolutely no computer applications used in creating the images. He goes on to say that having \u201cacrobatic models\u201d is the key to the success of the imagery. A few of his \"Entoptic Phenomena\" photographs were featured in the 2007 Texas Biennial in which he was awarded the Juror\u2019s Choice Award. In 2008 he started a new series of photographs \u201cw/ cheeseburgers\u201d that went on to become wildly popular or \u201cviral\u201d on the internet, primarily due to the photograph \u201cChihuahua on Cheeseburgers\u201d. Another series of photographs, entitled \u201cLittle Naked Person Storage,\u201d consists of photographs of naked people hiding in various places around the average American household. In an article on Sight Unseen, Hundley is quoted as saying, \u201cMy work started with the influence of Erwin Wurm and Maurizio Cattelan, these absurdists. I love the practical-joke nature of it; if I can make humor and beautiful aesthetics come together, that\u2019s the biggest powerhouse I can imagine.\u201d His photography has been featured in numerous publications and countless blogs and websites. In 2007 Hundley was nominated for Best Artist in the Austin Critics Table Awards. Though not initially mentioned in the credits, a few of his ideas were re-created in the music video \u201cHeaven Can Wait\u201d by Charlotte Gainsbourg featuring Beck. Eventually the director, Keith Schofield, contacted Hundley to apologize for not crediting his work as \u201cinspiration\u201d for portions of the video. Although most widely known for his photography, Hundley\u2019s work also includes sculptures and installation and has been exhibited across the US and in Berlin. Recent works have focused on assembled collages and a series of tribal inspired masks with the idea of gathering objects from contemporary culture and using them in a \u201ctribal\u201d way. He recently contributed to the TEDx event in Austin, TX in February 2011. In 2011, a Hundley photograph is to be published in Adbusters magazine and he will also have an exhibition at Show & Tell Gallery in Toronto, Canada. == References == == External links == * Official Website * Beale, Scott (2007-10-10) \"Jumping Fabric Photography by William Hundley\" Laughing Squid * Bec, Alex (2011-01-26) \"William Hundley: Becomes\" It's Nice That * Curcio, Seth (2007-04-15) \"William Hundley\" Daily Serving * Fei (2009-10-27) \"William Hundley\" Beautiful/Decay * Hudson, Will (2009-12-03) \"William Hundley\" It's Nice That * Khemsurov, Monica (2010-11-19) \"8 Things: William Hundley, Artist\" Sight Unseen * VVORK \"William Hundley\" Category:1976 births Category:Living people Category:American photographers ",
