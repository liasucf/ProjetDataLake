    "text": "Pilot Butte is a lava dome that was created from an extinct volcano located in Bend, Oregon. It is a cinder cone butte which rises nearly above the surrounding plains. Bend is one of four cities in the United States to have a volcano within its boundaries. Portland, with Mount Tabor, is the only other city in Oregon with a volcano within its city limits. Jackson Volcano in Jackson, Mississippi, and Diamond Head in Honolulu are the others. The Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint, presented as a gift to the State of Oregon in 1928, is a Bend icon. Pilot Butte itself is a popular hiking destination with two trails to the summit, each gaining about in elevation. There is also a trail around the base of Pilot Butte that was constructed in 2010. A scenic road also winds up and around the cone. The park had 949,968 annual visits in 2018, making it the most visited Oregon State Park east of the Cascade Mountains and the ninth most popular in the state. From the top, the entire city of Bend is visible, as well as several major Cascade peaks. Most prominent are the Three Sisters, Broken Top, and Mount Bachelor, which are located about to the west. The City of Bend launches Fourth of July fireworks from Pilot Butte each year. Pilot Butte was named in 1851 by Thomas Clark, leader of the first party of European settlers to camp on the future site of Bend. The Clark wagon train approached the area from the east after recovering from the Clark Massacre. == Geology == Pilot Butte is believed to be less than 780,000 years old due to the rock having normal polarity, and thus most likely laid down after the most recent reversal. == References == == External links == * * * * Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint, from The Oregon Encyclopedia Category:1928 establishments in Oregon Category:Bend, Oregon Category:Buttes of Oregon Category:Cascade Range Category:Cascade Volcanoes Category:Cinder cones of the United States Category:Extinct volcanoes Category:Volcanoes of Deschutes County, Oregon Category:Municipal parks in Oregon Category:Parks in Deschutes County, Oregon Category:State parks of Oregon Category:Tourist attractions in Bend, Oregon Category:Volcanoes of Oregon Category:Mountains of Deschutes County, Oregon Category:Mountains of Oregon Category:Landforms of Oregon de:Pilot Butte State Scenic Viewpoint ",
