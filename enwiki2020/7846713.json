The Greek National Road 42 (Vasiliki - Lefkada (city) - Amfilochia) passes through the town. Nydri is a popular tourist town. In the sea in front of Nydri are several small islands including Madouri, Skorpios, Skorpidi and Sparti. The island Skorpios is the property of the Ribolovlev family. The German archaeologist Wilhelm D\u00f6rpfeld, having examined the geographical descriptions of Homer in the Iliad and the Odyssey believed that Lefkada was Homer's Ithaca, and that the palace of Odysseus was located west of Nydri on the south coast of Lefkada. He performed extensive excavations at Nydri and uncovered Mycenaean tombs, walls, ruins and artefacts which supported his hypothesis. D\u00f6rpfeld spent the last years of his life at Nydri and he is buried there. ==Population== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Year !! Village population !!
