    "text": "The Duisburg Canals are part of the master plan developed by Foster and Partners for the reconstruction of the Duisburg Inner Harbour. They are part of the Duisburg: Town and Harbour section of the Ruhr Industrial Heritage Trail. An eastern port area was created separated from the rest of the port by the forming an artificial lake 26 m above sea level. The water level is maintained by ensuring that rainwater is channeled into the basin. Excess water is drained to the north side onto a bed of gravel. In case of drought a solar-powered fountain with an annual capacity of 90,000 m\u00b3 has been installed by the Hanse canal. Pre-treatment of the water supply is provided by small biotopes at the southern end of the canal. The area includes housing, some of which is low price. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Duisburg Category:Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank Category:Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in Germany Category:Canals in Germany ",
