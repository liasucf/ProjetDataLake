    "text": "Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s GKS 1157 fol. The Gray (Grey) Goose Laws () are a collection of laws from the Icelandic Commonwealth period. The term Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s was originally used in a medieval source to refer to a collection of Norwegian laws and was probably mistakenly used to describe the existing collection of Icelandic law during the sixteenth century. The Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s laws in Iceland were presumably in use until 1262\u20131264 when Iceland was taken over by the Norwegian crown. == Origins of Icelandic Law == According to Ari Thorgilsson, the earliest Icelandic laws were modeled on those from the Norwegian west-coast law-province, Gulathing. These were introduced to Iceland by an immigrant from Norway named \u00dalflj\u00f3tr, sometime during the 920's. Following several years of modification and revision, \u00dalflj\u00f3tr's laws were approved by an initial assembly. Out of this meeting, the annual general assembly known as the Althing was established. Each following summer, Icelanders would convene at Thingvellir for legislative and judicial meetings which would be supervised by the Lawspeaker. ==Etymology== The term \"Gray Goose Laws\", used to describe the laws of the Icelandic Commonwealth by the 16th century, may refer to the following: * the fact that the laws were written with a goose quill, * the fact that the laws were bound in goose skin, or * because of the age of the laws\u2014it was then believed that geese lived longer than other birds. == Manuscripts == The existing Icelandic Commonwealth laws that now exist as the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s never actually existed in one complete volume during medieval times. The Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s does not contain a unified body of law, as arguably one never existed in the Icelandic Commonwealth. Instead, the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s was derived from two smaller, fragmentary volumes known as the Konungsb\u00f3k (Copenhagen, Royal Library, GKS 1157 fol), apparently written around 1260, and Sta\u00f0arh\u00f3lsb\u00f3k (Reykjav\u00edk, \u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson Institute for Icelandic Studies, AM 334 fol), apparently written in 1280. The ornate detail and appearance of the volumes suggests that they were created for a wealthy, literate man, though scholars cannot be certain. Because the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s laws originally existed in two different forms, each has a unique written account of the law. Sometimes the Konungsb\u00f3k and Sta\u00f0arh\u00f3lsb\u00f3k present different information, sometimes complementary information, and sometimes contradictory information. This could represent the way in which the law was interpreted differently by different scribes or by different citizens. According to the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s, one third of the Icelandic laws were recited by the Law Speaker at the Icelandic national parliament, the Al\u00feingi, each year over a three-year period. In 1117 the Al\u00feingi decided that all the laws should be written down and this was accomplished at Hafli\u00f0i M\u00e1sson\u2019s farm over that winter and published the following year. These laws remained in force until 1271\u20131273 at which time the Ironside Laws\u2014based on Norwegian laws\u2014were adopted. There is scholarly disagreement, however, about how representative the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s are regarding the legal tradition that existed during Viking age Iceland. Arguably, the codification of oral law in the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s better represents Icelandic legal tradition post-Christianity, thus after the year 1000. ==Contents== The sections of law contained within the Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s are: *Christian Laws Section *Assembly Procedures Section *Treatment of Homicide *The Wergild Ring List (see Weregild) *The Lawspeaker's Section *The Law Council Section ==References== ===Editions and translations=== * Vilhj\u00e1lmur Finsen (ed. and trans.), Gr\u00e1g\u00e1s: Isl\u00e6ndernes lovbog i fristatens tid, udg. efter det kongelige Bibliotheks Haanskrift, 2 vols (Copenhagen: Berling, 1852), http://www.septentrionalia.net/etexts/gragas.pdf.
