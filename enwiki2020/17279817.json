They assert that when Maitreya first arrived in London he lived in the Brick Lane area for several yearsBarrett David V. The New Believers 2001 , page 347Brown, Mick. The Spiritual Tourist. Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 8 before moving to another unspecified location in the city. ==Beliefs, practices, and background== Share International's publications claim that the coming of Maitreya (meaning \"friendly\" in Sanskrit) fulfills not only Buddhist prophecies about the appearance of a future great teacher named Maitreya, but also the prophecies of a number of other world religions \u2015 including Christianity (the second coming of Christ), Hinduism (the Kalki avatar of Vishnu), Islam (the Imam Mahdi) and Judaism (the Jewish Messiah). Creme claims that Maitreya manifested himself through (or overshadowed) Jesus 2,000 years ago, that Maitreya resided in the Himalayas, and that in 1977 he descended from his ancient retreat in the Himalayas and took an aeroplane to London. His belief is that Maitreya is omniscient and omnipresent, and that he took up residence in the Indian-Pakistani community of London in the Brick Lane area and has been living and working there, seemingly as an ordinary man, his true status known to relatively few. Furthermore, that Maitreya has been emerging gradually into full public view so as not to infringe humanity's free will.Share International website: http://shareintl.org/introduction/introduction3.htmMick Brown.

Creme beweert dat in 1977 de nieuwe wereldleraar, Maitreya genaamd, in Londen is gearriveerd. Deze zou ook een avatar zijn, degene die de aarde zal helpen de geestelijke revolutie welke naar zijn zeggen gaande is, te begeleiden. Het is een revolutie die liefde als middel en als doel heeft. Maitreya belichaamt in dit gebeuren het planetaire liefdesaspect, Sai Baba het kosmische. Volgens Creme staat Sai Baba hoger in de 'hi\u00ebrarchie der meesters' dan Maitreya en is hij op aarde gekomen om Maitreya te helpen bij zijn werk.13 De relatie tussen Sai Baba en Maitreya werd door Vroon niet vermeld, maar deze informatie verscheen prompt via een ingezonden brief in de krant.\" Partial English translation \"Vroon wrote further about Maitreya whose apostle is Benjamin Creme.

[....] \" Journalists had been invited to find Maitreya in the Brick Lane area but were unable to do so.Barrett, David V. The New Believers 2001 , page 347-349 According to Creme, Maitreya influenced the ending of the Cold War, German reunification, and the ending of apartheid in South Africa. In 1974, Benjamin Creme introduced a meditation called Transmission Meditation which he says is a way of transmitting spiritual energies through the meditators to create a pool of positive, spiritual energy for the benefit of humanity. Share International says there are 600 Transmission Meditation groups all over the world. The groups sit silently while spiritual energy is transmitted or 'stepped-down' by the Masters of Wisdom (also called by some groups Ascended Masters). This group meditation is a form of service, rather than the traditional personal meditation, which can be continued as well as this service activity.Brown, Mick. The Spiritual Tourist. Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 250Melton J. Gordon, Gale Research Inc, Jerome Clark, Aidan A. Kelly Original from the University of Michigan, New Age Encyclopedia, 1990, , entry nr. 96, page 136 Transmission Meditation is a non-denominational meditation and people from all faiths (or none) take part in this form of service.http://www.share- international.org/background/xmission/tm_main.htm Benjamin Creme was a student of the teachings of Alice Bailey, Helena Blavatsky and Helena Roerich.Barrett, David V. The New Believers 2001 , page 348 Share International says that Maitreya appeared before a Christian gathering of 6,000 people on the outskirts of Nairobi, Kenya on 11 June 1988. This happening was widely published, and photographs of the Jesus-like apparition were distributed worldwide.Brown, Mick. The Spiritual Tourist, Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 349Limpt, Cokky van 23 December 1997 'Rouw om Diana teken van Zijn komst'/'Mourning about Diana sign of His advent' in Dutch newspaper Trouw English translation: \"\"Share International knows how the world teacher looks in his present outfit.

From 1991 to 2002, they say Maitreya appeared before gatherings of orthodox religious groups worldwide. He addressed them briefly in their own language and was recognized by the majority of people in attendance as their awaited Teacher. Maitreya also apparently created healing springs of water in the areas near these appearances. These healing waters in Mexico, Germany, and India have drawn millions of visitors.http://shareintl.org/introduction/introduction7.htm The organisation has published a list of Maitreya's alleged appearances. ==1982 onwards== In the spring of 1982 Creme held a press conference in Los Angeles, California, USA. Afterwards, Creme wrote: \"It was hoped that the media would respond to my information at a level which would allow Him to come forward to them. This hope, however, was not fulfilled. While the media did show an interest in the reappearance story, it did not go so far as to actually get involved in searching for Maitreya. Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14 Creme wrote: In January 1986, Maitreya contacted media representatives at the highest level in Britain who agreed to make an announcement living in the Asian community of London. Under pressure from high religious and government officials, however, this statement was withheld. Maitreya's Mission, Vol.1, p. 14 Alcuin Bramerton: Christ and Jesus at the BBC - London 1986 BBC misses biggest story in English history. UK church establishment rejects Second Coming of Christ. Why did the BBC, the Queen and the Church of England bishops choose to ignore the Second Coming of Christ in 1986? In 1997 Creme made similar announcements that there would be imminent global TV broadcasts from Christ/Maitreya, though with far less media interest. In the last month of 2008 Creme & Share International distributed a news release stating that soon, a very bright star would appear visible throughout the world, both night and day. Creme said it would be a sign that Maitreya\u2019s first major public appearance would be very soon. In January 2009, several sightings of the \u2018star\u2019 were reported in the media, posted on YouTube, described in letters to Share International's magazine. For the News Media: What's next? On 14 January 2010 in London, Benjamin Creme reported that Maitreya had given his first television interview recently \"...on a major US television network, inaugurating his public work.\" Creme stated that Maitreya had given over two dozen television interviews in 2010, and had not been introduced as Maitreya \"but as a seemingly ordinary man\" and that His media interviews continue with him proposing \"practical solutions to our pressing global problems.\" For the News Media: What's next? Creme continued until his demise in October of 2016,https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2016/11/11/benjamin-creme-artist- and-esotericist--obituary/ to claim that time is now very near for Maitreya's emergence. He did not receive any money for this work or royalties from his 14 books, and for over 30 years gave free public lectures around the world. A worldwide network of volunteers worked with Benjamin Creme to inform the public of this information.THE NEW AGE CONSPIRACY Share International maintains that Maitreya's interviews will eventually \"lead to an international press conference and, ultimately, Maitreya's 'Day of Declaration' when he will reveal his true identity.\" For the News Media: What's next? ==Main priorities of Maitreya and the idea of sharing== Share International does not claim Maitreya as a religious leader, or that he is to found a new religion, but that he is a teacher and guide for people of every religion and those of no religion. They believe this to be a time of great political, economic and social crisis, that Maitreya will inspire humanity to see itself as one family, and create a civilization based on sharing, economic and social justice, and global cooperation. They highlight the main goals that Maitreya will immediately recommend dealing with after the 'Day of Declaration.' They say that he will call to action the people of the world to save the hundreds of millions who are starving and hungry in a world of plenty. Among Maitreya's recommendations will be a shift in social priorities so that adequate food, housing, clothing, education, and medical care become universal human rights.http://shareintl.org/maitreya/Ma_main.htm Believers claim that through the years, Maitreya has given 140 messages.http://shareintl.org/maitreya/messages/Ma_mess.htm Share International quotes him as saying, \"See your brother as yourself\".http://shareintl.org/magazine/SI_current.htm They say that Maitreya says only through sharing can the world be renewed, and that only sharing will bring justice and peace, and that his can only be achieved by the perception of brotherhood. ==Share International magazine and organization== Share International cover, featuring one of Benjamin Creme's artwork Share International has offices in Amsterdam, London, Berkeley, Tokyo and several other countries. Brown, Mick. The Spiritual Tourist, Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 13 It publishes a monthly magazine, also called Share International.Limpt, Cokky van 23 December 1997 'Rouw om Diana teken van Zijn komst'/'Mourning about Diana sign of His advent' in Dutch newspaper Trouw English translation:\"Their club magazine Share international [..]\" Dutch original \"Hun verenigingsblad Share International [..]\" In it, Creme has published a number of articles that he claims were dictated to him telepathically by a Master of Wisdom (Ascended Master), an enlightened being who apparently has already passed through evolution on this planet and has an expanded consciousness and therefore does not have to reside in a fixed human body. The magazine documents the gradual Emergence of Maitreya the World Teacher & the Masters of Wisdom, world changes, and many miracles sent in by people experiencing them, that they assert appear all over the world.Brown, Mick. The Spiritual Tourist, Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 257 Share International magazine... covers news, events, and comments bearing on the priorities of Maitreya, the World Teacher: an adequate supply of the right food; appropriate housing for all; health care and education as universal rights; and the maintenance of ecological balance in the world. ==Reception and criticisms== According to the American religious scholar J. Gordon Melton, Creme's statement served as a catalyst for assessment of the New Age movement by Evangelical Christians.Newport, John P. The New Age Movement and the Biblical Worldview: Conflict and Dialogue, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 1998, , pages 180-181 A week after the advertisements in 1982, other advertisements appeared in the Los Angeles Times denouncing Creme as an instrument of the Antichrist. Constance Cumbey (an Evangelical Christian and a Detroit area attorney and author) holds that \"Maitreya\" is a pseudonym for the Antichrist and regards Share International as an openly Luciferian movement. She bases this on Creme's open professions of loyalty to Lucifer on various talk radio shows - some of which she has personally participated in. She also bases this on Creme's recitation of his belief in the contents of the Alice Bailey books - books which are published by Lucis Press - an organization that originally published under \"Lucifer Publishing Company\". Brown, Mick. The Spiritual Tourist. Bloomsbury publishing, 1998. page 23 \"Creme was agent for the AntiChrist. I had come across a pamphlet published by an organisation called the Christian Research Institute declaring its belief that Mr. Creme was indeed 'deriving his inspiration from a spiritual realm, albeit a malevolent one'.\" Barrett, David V. The New Believers 2001 , page 349 Quote \"Sensing a good offbeat story, a number of journalists search the Brick Lane area, but no one could point them at the returned Christ. Creme lost credibility and supporters, and gained some serious enemies among Evangelical Christians. An Evangelical book, The Hidden Dangers of the Rainbow (1983) attacked all New Age and esoteric movements - especially Creme and the Maitreya [sic] - as a satanic conspiracy [..]\" Other Christian Evangelicals distanced themselves from Cumbey's conspiracy theory. British journalist Mick Brown wrote \"I came to enjoy my talks with Mr. Creme. His stories of the Hierarchy, of hidden retreats in Tibet, of... the cogs... guiding the planet towards an age of harmony and enlightenment ...\" He described Creme's claims as fantastic and outlandish.Brown, Mick.
