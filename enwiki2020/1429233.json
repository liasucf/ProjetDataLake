The goal was to make the audience believe that E*TRADE was easy to use. The campaign, which appeared online, on television, and in print, was created by Tor Myhren, then of Grey Global Group. At first, Myhren had doubts if the ad campaign would work. In January 2008, during Super Bowl XLII, the company debuted advertisements featuring the baby, voiced by comedian Pete Holmes, discussing investing in an adult voice in front of a webcam. In February 2009, during Super Bowl XLIII, the company once again aired a 30-second advertisement featuring the baby, along with a Facebook page, updates on Twitter, and videos on YouTube. As a result of the advertisement, the company realized a 19% increase in online applications and an 86% increase in website traffic in the week after the game. In 2011, the baby was featured in an advertisement called \u201cEnzo the Tailor\u201d, in which the baby was fitted for a custom-made suit and talked about how his tailor could retire in Tuscany. In January 2013, the company aired an advertisement during Super Bowl XLVII featuring the baby. In the advertisement, the baby focuses on how much money is at stake in 401(k) account fees and offers a better approach: \"come to E*TRADE, and Save It\". On March 21, 2014, the company announced the end of the E*TRADE baby via a commercial which aired during the NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament. ==See also== * Ajaxo Inc. v.
