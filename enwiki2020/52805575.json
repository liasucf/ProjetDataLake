    "text": "Anthony Joseph De Nonno (born January 12, 1947) is an Italian-American filmmaker, photographer, puppeteer, historian, and speaker in humanities. == Early life == De Nonno was born in Brooklyn, New York to Antoinette (n\u00e9e Carifa) and Jerry De Nonno, two residents of Manhattan's Little Italy neighborhood.Carlozo, Louis R. \u201cCultural Troubadour.\u201d Fra Noi, Dec. 2016, pp. 27\u201328. His grandparents, Giovanni and Angelina Carifa, owned and operated the Columbia Restaurant on Mulberry Street in Manhattan. His father, Jerry, was a sports columnist and horse racing handicapper who worked at the New York Post from 1927 to 1977. He wrote a daily column called \"De Nonno's Picks,\" which highlighted racing odds at the Aqueduct and Belmont tracks. Former colleague and sports editor Vic Ziegel wrote about Jerry De Nonno in a 1997 remembrance: \"He had [an index card] for every horse who ran in New York, squeezed into a half-dozen long cabinets that sat on his desk...De Nonno had a well-deserved reputation for picking longshots, which will happen when you don't have enough time to find the logical and boring even-money favorite.\" De Nonno attended New Utrecht High School and later received a B.F.A. in Communications from the New York Institute of Technology-Manhattan. Around this time, he worked as a copy boy for the New York Post, the newspaper where his father worked. == Career == Between 1970 and 1993, De Nonno has photographed a number of public figures including Muhammad Ali, Tina Turner, Cary Grant, David Bowie, Joan Baez, Bette Midler, The Who, The Rolling Stones, Elvis Presley, Frank Sinatra, and Stevie Wonder. He served as Eric Clapton's 1974 American tour photographer. Since 1970, De Nonno has written, produced, and directed over 50 short films and documentaries. While studying at NYIT-Manhattan, De Nonno made his first films: El Fang-Dango, a spoof of Dracula, The Kiss of Death, a gangster-film spoof, and It's All In My Hands, a documentary on local shoemaker John Principe. It's All In My Hands was an end-of-year project that cost him $800 (~$4,800 in 2018). De Nonno recalls in an account on Folkstreams: \"...Finnish TV acquired the rights to broadcast It's All in My Hands six times over a 2 year period-and paid me exactly $800.\" Subjects of his documentaries have included Itzhak Perlman, Anne Akiko Meyers, and Antonio Meucci, as well as senior citizens, physically challenged persons, and family businesses in New York City. Many of his documentaries have aired on ABC, PBS, Bravo, and New York's WLIW. Meucci, in particular, had resonated with De Nonno in his filming of 1992's Antonio Meucci: Father of the Telephone. He would later advocate House Resolution 269 among the U.S. House of Representatives to honor Meucci, which passed on June 11, 2002. In a recollection of It's All In My Hands on Folkstreams, De Nonno states his ethos on filmmaking: > \"At the heart of what I do as a filmmaker...is to mine the essence and core > of the individual(s) I am focusing upon and reveal something about him or > her, which touches a chord in all of us. I see myself as a storyteller and I > love to shine my filmmaker\u2019s eye on the often unspoken and unrecognized > \u201cSalt of the Earth\u201d individuals of this world...I am especially determined > to honor the legacy and dignity of Italian Americans as well as the heritage > and traditions of culturally-diverse people of our great nation.\" From 1981, after filming It's One Family: Knock on Wood, he has offered public performances and workshops with a marionette of a knight based on the epic poem Orlando Furioso. De Nonno is a close friend of the film's subjects: the Manteo family of puppeteers versed in the marionette shows of Catania, Sicily. He has also worked as a Senior Security Officer at The New School in Manhattan. == Reception == * Film critic Pauline Kael praised his 1977 documentary, Part of Your Loving, about Italian-born baker Ben Togati: \"It's just about impeccable. The camera is always where it should be. The man is treated with affection. And it's very complete. You get a sense of his life.\" Part of Your Loving was also featured in PBS's The Short List documentary series in 1999. * Author and Associate Dean of Undergraduate Studies at USC Dornsife Richard Fliegel, who associate produced De Nonno's 1980 segment for ABC's 20/20 on rock band Fleetwood Mac, commented on De Nonno's 1993 Rebuilding the South Bronx, showing its subjects as \"people who lived, believed and came together... to save their neighborhood and rebuild it for the future generations.\" * CUNY Queens College literary scholar and Italian- American historian Fred Gardaphe praised De Nonno's 2010 Serving Society with Heart: UNICO National's 85-Year Contribution to America, saying it \"paints an inspiring portrait of UNICO members nation wider and their service and devotion to American society over the last 85 years.\" * His 2001 Heaven Touches Brooklyn In July, about the Festa de Giglio (Feast of Lilies, which De Nonno has, in his words, \"become obsessed\" with) celebrating St. Paulinus of Nola in Williamsburg, was sharply criticized by Joseph Sciorra of the John D. Calandra Italian American Institute at Queens College. Sciorra called the film \"extremely problematic and ultimately dishonest,\" noting numerous historical inconsistencies, derivation from other documentaries (i.e Jeff Porter's The Men Who Dance The Giglio), and an \"exaggerated, overly sentimental, and clumsy script.\" * From De Nonno's recollection of It's All In My Hands on Folkstreams: > \"Michael Racanelli, director of the Vocational Division of the New York City > Department of Education, called it 'An impressive personalized film on > working.' Dr. Paul Patane, trustee of the School Art League said 'it awakens > young people to the dignity of working with their hands.' Joan Eskenaski of > the National Career Counseling and Resource Center cited the film in a > review calling it 'A film of feeling and quality...a great vocational > guidance film.' Her review inspired librarians across New York State to > acquire 16mm prints for their film collection.\" == Filmography == {| class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title |- |1970 |The Kiss of Death |- |1971 |El Fang-Dango |- |1972 |It's All In My Hands |- |1977 |Part of Your Loving |- |1979 |One Generation Is Not Enough |- |1980 |Moira: A Vision Of Blindness Fleetwood Mac |- |1981 |The Way of The Wind It's One Family: Knock on Wood |- |1982 |Itzhak Perlman: In My Case, Music Dancing's All of You |- |1983 |Anne Akiko Meyers: Beyond The Gift of Music Just Be Me |- |1984 |Housing With a Heart: The Enterprise Foundation |- |1985 |Just Be Me Navigation Without Sight |- |1986 |Liberty Minutes Portraits of Liberty |- |1987 |a3520 For Piano Solo(a composition by Matthias Kriesberg) |- |1988 |Fast and Sexy |- |1989 |A Fistful of Words |- |1990 |Everybody Rejoice |- |1991 |The Morris Magnet School for the Arts |- |1992 |Antonio Meucci: The Father of the Telephone |- |1993 |Rebuilding the South Bronx: The Story of SEBCO |- |1994 |Italian American Visions: Portraits of 20th Century Immigration |- |1995 |An Empowering Partnership |- |1996\u201397 |The UN in Queens: A Global Celebration |- |1998 |Teaching Technology to the World |- |2000 |Tai Chi and Seniors: A Meditation in Movement |- |2001\u20132005 |Heaven Touches Brooklyn in July |- |2003 |Teaching Technology to the World |- |2004 |A Gift of Joy New York City Through Time: The Museum of the City of New York Public Schools are Everybody's Business |- |2005 |Forming Men for All Seasons |- |2006 |Young People: Building Bridges to a Safer World |- |2010 |John LaCorte: A Monument to History Serving Society With Heart: UNICO National's 85-Year Contribution to America |- |2007\u20132010 |From Devastation to Celebration: The South Bronx: A Community Reborn A Century of Laughter, Heart, and Song: The Art of Italian Comedy in America |} == References == ==External links== *It's All In My Hands: De Nonno's debut documentary, 1972, hosted on Folkstreams. *November 26, 2012 lecture, part of Doc Studies at The New School *Tony De Nonno on the Internet Movie Database *Tony De Nonno on Brooklyn Arts Council's Registry of Artists Category:1947 births Category:American filmmakers Category:Italian-American culture Category:Living people Category:Photographers from New York City Category:People from Bay Ridge, Brooklyn ",
