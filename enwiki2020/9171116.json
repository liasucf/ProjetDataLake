    "text": "Color of Success is the 1985 debut album by the funk/R&B; singer, Morris Day. Released a year after departing previous band, The Time, the album is similar in style to The Time's material, even going so far as to copy The Time's formula of six songs per album. The album's highlight is \"The Oak Tree\", a funky-pop number about a dance, akin to \"The Bird\" by The Time. The album was produced, arranged and composed by Day, who also played drums and keyboards throughout the album. Also on keyboards was Rickey \"Freeze\" Smith, who would later join Day in the revamped version of The Time in the mid-1990s. ==Track listing== All tracks composed by Morris Day # \"Color of Success\" \u2013 5:20 # \"The Character\" \u2013 4:07 # \"The Oak Tree\" \u2013 7:22 # \"Love Sign\" \u2013 6:22 # \"Don't Wait For Me\" \u2013 7:12 # \"Love / Addiction\" \u2013 5:10 ==Personnel== *Drums and Percussion - Morris Day *Drum Programming - Steve Mitchell *Engineer - Richard Kaplan *Guitar - Horace Bokie Coleman Jr., Howie Rice, Roland Bautista, Tony Berg *Mixing - Michael Brauer, Morris Day *Piano - Greg Phillinganes *Producer - Morris Day *Synthesizer - Howie Rice, Larry Dunn, Morris Day, Ricky \"Freeze\" Smith, Steve Mitchell *Vocals - Morris Day (lead), Angie Johnson, Bunny Hull, Clydene Jackson, Kit Hain, Mary Bridges, Maxayne Lewis, Mimi Brodsky, Sharon Robinson ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
