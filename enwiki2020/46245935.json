    "text": "Spango Valley is a steep sided valley to the south-west of Greenock, Scotland. A small river, the Spango Burn, runs through the valley. Spango Valley and Valleypark is connected by road (the A78). The electrified Inverclyde railway line between Glasgow Central and Wemyss Bay passes through Spango Valley (between Branchton and Inverkip stations. IBM railway station, which opened in May 1978 to serve the IBM factory had its services suspended on 8 December 2018 following demolition of the factory. From the 1950s Spango Valley was the site of a large factory manufacturing IBM computers; in the early 1980s the A78 at Spango Valley was substantially upgraded to dual carriageway to accommodate the increased traffic to and from the IBM complex and the nearby Inverkip Power Station which has also been demolished. The (now largely demolished) factory is no longer owned by IBM and the site was renamed Valleypark, with the intention of attracting other businesses to the site. In October 2016 IBM vacated Spango Valley although they still possess offices elsewhere in Greenock. What is now known as Valleypark was built in the flat base of the valley between the A78 road and the railway line. As of 2017 the site is completely unoccupied, and local police have warned the public not to enter the site as a number of fires have been started there. ==References== ==External links== *Spango Valley on The Gazetter for Scotland website *Spango Valley on the Scotland's Places website *Valleypark - official website ==Gallery== File:Spango Hole - geograph.org.uk - 809845.jpg|Spango Valley: view of IBM railway station and the \"Hole of Spango\" from Ailleymill Road Category:Valleys of Inverclyde ",
