Latour- Marliac founded a water lily nursery at Le Temple-sur-Lot in 1875. A display of his plants at the Exposition Universelle of 1889 in Paris attracted the attention of the painter Claude Monet who then obtained water lilies for his garden in Giverny from Latour-Marliac.Eyewitness Travel Family Guide France, Penguin Books, 2014, p. 273 ==References== Category:1830 births Category:1911 deaths Category:French gardeners ",
