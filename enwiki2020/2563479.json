    "text": "Cristina Galb\u00f3 S\u00e1nchez (born 17 January 1950) is a Spanish actress who achieved moderate fame in Europe during the late 1960s and early 1970s, making a name for herself in film mostly for European horror films. In 1967 she appeared in Dove si spara di pi\u00f9, directed by Gianni Puccini and starring Peter Lee Lawrence, with whom she married. Arguably her best-known role is as \"Elizabeth Seccles\", a boarding school girl having an affair with a married professor of Italian and gymnastics, in the 1972 Massimo Dallamano giallo, What Have You Done to Solange? A recent DVD release of her 1975 film The Killer Must Kill Again, the most notable work of Luigi Cozzi (a friend and associate of giallo film master Dario Argento) has presented her controversial work in that more obscure representative of the Italian horror genre. Cozzi mentions on his DVD commentary for the film how Galb\u00f3 was uncomfortable with the film's most disturbing scene, the killer's rape of her kidnapped and abused character. Galb\u00f3 also has a significant role in another boarding school shocker, Narciso Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez Serrador's 1969 Spanish film The House That Screamed. == Filmography == * 1966 La ciudad no es para m\u00ed * 1969 Blood in the Bullring - Paloma Dom\u00ednguez. * 1969 Shoot Twice * 1969 The House That Screamed * 1972 Cosa avete fatto a Solange?
