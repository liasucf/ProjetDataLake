It employs the principle of gate control theory to organically block pain receptors by sending continuous electrical pulses through electrodes along the body's nerve pathways in order to block out the pain signals before they reach the central nervous system. This is done using a specific frequency and length of its electrical pulses, which block out the specific type of pain associated with menstruation. The device has undergone a clinical trial, of which no results have been published. ==Further reading== * Femtech == References == Category:Science and technology in Israel Category:Medical technology Category:Women's health ",
