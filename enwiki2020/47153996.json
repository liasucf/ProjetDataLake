    "text": "Permanence is the debut studio album by rock band No Devotion. It was released on 25 September 2015 through Collect Records. ==Background== Following Lostprophets frontman Ian Watkins' incarceration for child sex offences, No Devotion was formed. Bassist Stuart Richardson explained that they were unsure \"if we would ever make music again or if people would look us in the face. Everything felt like it was over\". In April 2014 it was announced that Thursday frontman Geoff Rickly would be working with No Devotion through his own label, Collect Records. Rickley regarded their new material as being influenced by Joy Division, New Order, and The Cure, although he did not speculate whether or not he was going to be joining the band. A month later, the group confirmed they would be making music with Rickly on vocals as he said they \"deserved a second chance\". On 1 July, the band released their first single \"Stay\", with B-side \"Eyeshadow\". In late July, the band went on a short tour. On 27 October 2014, \"10,000 Summers\" was released as a single with the B-sides \"Only Thing\" and the demo version of \"10,000 Summers\". In early January 2015 it was announced that drummer Luke Johnson had left the band, feeling that he would be unable to fulfill commitments. Matt Tong of Bloc Party filled in on drums to help the band finish recording their debut album. Also in January, the band supported Gerard Way on his tour of the UK. Stuart Richardson stated in 2019 that the album was written during the period Watkins' trial was going on. ==Production== Asked about influences his song writing, Rickly replied with \"Film[s and] Novels. I think music is always aching for two things: narrative and visual pacing. The narrative is the job of a good singer or a truly visionary producer. The visual is often overlooked. That's why our album is so design heavy\". Permanence was mixed by Dave Fridmann and produced by Richardson and Alex Newport. ==Release== On 30 June 2015, Permanence was announced for release. On 6 July, \"Addition\" was released as a single. \"Addition\" was released to radio on 17 August. A day later, \"Permanent Sunlight\" was released as a single. Permanence was made available for streaming on 21 September. The album was released through Collect Records on 25 September. In October and November, the band went on a tour of Europe. ==Reception== Permanence charted in the UK at number 120. \"I Wanna Be Your God\" was included on Alternative Presss list of \"12 new songs you need to hear from September 2015\". Rock Sound reviewer Rob Sayce noted the album's fusion of \"shimmering electronic textures with elements of post-punk, psychedelic pop and a hefty dose of gloom.\"Sayce 2015, p. 88 Sayce wrote how Rickly managed to sow together the collection's \"various threads with real passion and intensity.\" Sayce mentioned that those who grew up with The Cure's material \"should feel right at home\". The album was ranked at number 8 in Alternative Presss \"10 Essential Records of 2015\" list.Pettigrew 2015, p. 96 Jason Pettigrew of Alternative Press wrote that the album \"exceed[ed] fans' and detractors' preconceived notions with equal measures of heart-hitting pop and urbane rock cool.\" The album was included at number 12 on Rock Sounds top 50 releases of 2015 list.Bird, ed. 2016, p. 27 Permanence won Best Album at the 2016 Kerrang! Awards. ==Track listing== All songs written by No Devotion. #\"Break\" \u2013 4:17 #\"Permanent Sunlight\" \u2013 4:36 #\"Eyeshadow\" \u2013 3:50 #\"Why Can't I Be with You\" \u2013 4:00 #\"I Wanna Be Your God\" \u2013 3:58 #\"Death Rattle\" \u2013 2:52 #\"10,000 Summers\" \u2013 4:15 #\"Night Drive\" \u2013 6:03 #\"Stay\" \u2013 4:00 #\"Addition\" \u2013 3:36 #\"Grand Central\" \u2013 5:59 ==Personnel== ;No Devotion * Geoff Rickly \u2013 lead vocals * Jamie Oliver \u2013 vocals, piano, keyboards, synths * Lee Gaze \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Mike Lewis \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Stuart Richardson \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals * Luke Johnson \u2013 drums, percussion (tracks 3\u20135, 7\u201310 and 11) ;Additional musicians * Matt Tong \u2013 drums, percussion (tracks 1, 2, 4 and 6) ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums Chart | 120 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 33 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Scottish Singles and Albums Chart | 20 |} ==References== ; Citations ;Sources * * * ==External links== *Permanence at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:2015 debut albums Category:No Devotion albums Category:Albums produced by Alex Newport Category:Albums produced by Dave Fridmann ",
