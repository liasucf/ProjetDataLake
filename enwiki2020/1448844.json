    "text": "Sufficiently Breathless, the second album by Captain Beyond, was released in 1973 and features a jazzier, smoother sound than its predecessor, reminiscent of mid-1970s Santana. The medley format of the first album is retained only for the last six minutes of Sufficiently Breathless: \"Voyages of Past Travellers\" flows directly into \"Everything's a Circle\", which in turn is actually two distinct songs despite being listed under a single title. Original drummer/songwriter Bobby Caldwell had been replaced by Marty Rodriguez and Guille Garcia in the band. According to bassist Lee Dorman, the songs were written by vocalist Rod Evans, guitarist Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt, and Dorman himself, but Rodriguez and Garcia were allotted a percentage point of the songwriting royalties due to their contributions to the arrangements. Sufficiently Breathless also featured a sixth band member, pianist Reese Wynans, but his time with Captain Beyond was brief; he did not play on the album's title track and quit after one show with the band due to his economic situation. Dorman alone was credited as writing the songs on the album, due to Rhino and Rod Evans being in litigation with Iron Butterfly and Deep Purple respectively. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Rod Evans \u2013 lead and harmony vocals * Larry \"Rhino\" Reinhardt \u2013 electric, acoustic, and slide guitars * Lee Dorman \u2013 bass guitar * Marty Rodriguez \u2013 drums, backup vocals * Reese Wynans \u2013 electric and acoustic pianos * Guille Garcia \u2013 congas, timbales, percussion ;Additional personnel * Paul Hornsby \u2013 organ on \"Starglow Energy\" ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Year !align=\"left\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"| |} ==References== Category:Captain Beyond albums Category:Capricorn Records albums Category:1973 albums ",
