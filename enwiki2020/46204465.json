He supported Tutush, a member of the Seljukid house whose province was the Greater Syria. Tutush appointed him as the governor of Kud\u00fcs (Jerusalem). After his death in 1091, Sokman and his brother Ilghazi became the co-governors of Kud\u00fcs. However S\u00f6kmen lost his position in K\u00fcdus. when Kud\u00fcs was sieged by Fatimids in 1098. Sokman abandoned the city and moved to north. ==In Anatolia and Syria== Even before the loss of Kud\u00fcs, S\u00f6kmen used to spend much time in Anatolia and Syria. After Tutush's death in 1095, S\u00f6kmen took service with Ridwan of Aleppo, Tutush's son. S\u00f6kmen made use of the fight between Ridwan and his brother Duqaq to a gain a territory of his own around Suru\u00e7 (now a district center in \u015eanl\u0131urfa Province of Turkey).Y\u00fccel-Sevim p.164 In 1098 Great Seljuk Empire formed an army under the commandship of Kerbogha of Musul to assist Ya\u011f\u0131s\u0131yan of Antakya (Antioch) during the siege of Antioch by the Crusades. S\u00f6kmen took part in this army. But the campaign was a failureNicolle p.13 and the army arrived in Antakya a few days after Antakya was surrendered. In 1101 Baudouin de Boulogne (Baldwin I of Jerusalem) captured Suru\u00e7.G\u00fcray ==S\u00f6kmen\u2019s beylik== Kerbogha died in 1102 and during the ensuing struggle to control Musul, S\u00f6kmen supported Musa, the viceroy of Musul. For his services, Musa granted the city Hasankeyf (then called H\u0131sn\u2019\u0131 Keyfa; now a district center in Batman Province of Turkey) to S\u00f6kmen. S\u00f6kmen founded a small beylik around Hasankeyf. This beylik is now considered as one of the three Arkukid beyliks. (The other two were \u0130lghazi's Mardin beylik and Harput beylik.) Hasankeyf beylik lived up to 1231.Y\u00fccel-Sevim p.165 After being a bey, he supported his brother Ilghazi who had recently been dismissed from his post as a Seljukid shihna in Baghdad. In 1104, in the battle of Harran he defeated a Crusaders army. In this battle he took Baldwin II of Jerusalem and Joscelin I captive.Y\u00fccel-Sevim p.165 ==Death== Toghtekin, the ruler of Damascus asked S\u00f6kmen to support him against the Crusaders. S\u00f6kmen agreed; but on the way to Damascus, at al-Qaryatayn, he died of a pertussis in October 1104.G\u00fcray ==Citations== ==Sources== * * * Category:11th-century births Category:1104 deaths Category:Artuqids Category:Turkic rulers Category:Medieval Jerusalem Category:Muslims of the First Crusade Category:Hasankeyf District Category:Deaths from whooping cough Category:People of the Seljuq Empire Category:11th-century Turkic people ",
