Her research interests include meta-analysis, survival analysis, and ethics in mathematics, and she has participated in highly-cited studies on autism and cerebral palsy. She is a professor of statistics at the University of Warwick. She also frequently visits the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in South Africa as a volunteer statistics instructor. ==Education and career== Hutton read mathematics and statistics at the University of Edinburgh, earning a bachelor's degree with first class honours in 1982. After studying for a diploma in mathematical statistics at the University of Cambridge, she earned a PhD at Imperial College London in 1986. Her dissertation, Non-negative time series and shot noise processes as models for dry rivers, was supervised by David Cox. She worked at the University of Liverpool from 1986 to 1995 and at Newcastle University from 1996 to 2000, before moving to the University of Warwick in 2000. ===USS director=== Hutton became a director of the Universities Superannuation Scheme on 1 November 2015.https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/hutton/. On 21 May 2019, it was revealed that, in her capacity as a non-executive director on the USS board of trustees, she had in March 2018 complained to the Pensions Regulator, alleging that her efforts in 2017 to check whether the USS deficit had been miscalculated had been frustrated by delays and obstructions to providing her with data to which she needed access to fulfil her fiduciary duties. As of May 2019, the Pensions Regulator and Financial Reporting Council were investigating the allegations.Josephine Cumbo, 'Regulators probe claims about university pension plan', Financial Times (21 May 2019). On 14 June 2019, as the investigation continued, the Regulator rebuked USS for claiming that aspects of USS policy were mandated by the Regulator when in fact they were not.Josephine Cumbo, 'Regulator rebukes UK university pension scheme', Financial Times (14 June 2019). Hutton was suspended from USS's board in June 2019.'Suspended USS board member questions \u2018quality\u2019 of pension scheme\u2019s calculations', UniversityBusiness (26 June 2018). On 11 October 2019, it was reported that she had been dismissed as a director of USS on the grounds that, according to an independent investigation by Slaughter and May, \"she had breached a number of her director\u2019s duties owed under company law and contract\". USS said that the dismissal was independent of Hutton's whistleblowing and the ongoing investigation; Hutton said she did not view the decision as valid and was considering further action.Anna McKie, 'Whistleblowing professor Jane Hutton fired from USS board', Times Higher Education (11 October 2019).Jack Gray, 'USS whistleblower fired', PensionsAge: (11 October 2019). The events surrounding Hutton are intimately entangled with the long-standing dispute over the valuation and sustainability of USS as a defined benefit pension scheme.'The Insider: Jane Hutton and USS', USSbriefs (20 October 2019). Information about Hutton's dismissal was leaked on 22 February 2020.Anna McKie, \"USS whistleblower \u2018breached confidence\u2019 by talking to press\", Times Higher Education (24 February 2020). On 9 March Hutton gave an extensive interview to Portfolio Institutional.Mona Dohle, \"\u201cThe deficit is a myth\u201d \u2013 USS whistleblower Jane Hutton on pension valuation challenges\", Portfolio Institutional (9 March 2020). ==Recognition== Hutton won a Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award in 2013.
