    "text": "Joktheel is a geographic name used in the Hebrew Bible, meaning \"God-subdued\". ==In Judah== A place named Joktheel is mentioned in the Book of Joshua as located in the low country of Judah between Mizpah and Lachish (). ==In Edom (Sela)== A different place, located in Edom and originally called Sela, is renamed as Jokhteel by King Amaziah of Judah after his conquest of the area (, ). The Second Book of Chronicles offers a clearer explanation of how that name, which means \"God-subdued\", was chosen due to the fact that Amaziah attributed his victory to God.http://biblehub.com/topical/j/joktheel.htm Biblehub ==References== Category:Hebrew Bible places ",
