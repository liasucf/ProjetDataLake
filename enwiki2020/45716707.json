    "text": "True Colors is the second studio album by Russian-German electronic music producer Zedd released on 15 May 2015 by Interscope Records. The album features collaborations with singers Jon Bellion, Troye Sivan, Selena Gomez, rapper Logic, upcoming production duo Botnek and bands such as Echosmith, Bahari and X Ambassadors, as well as uncredited production by Rock Mafia and KDrew. The first single from the album, \"I Want You to Know\" featuring Selena Gomez was released on 23 February 2015. The single entered the top 20 on Billboard Hot 100, at number 17. On 14 April 2015, Zedd released another track, \"Addicted to a Memory\" that features the group Bahari, that was released as a promotional single alongside the pre order of the album on iTunes. \"Beautiful Now\", featuring the guest vocals of Jon Bellion, was released on iTunes as the album's second official single. The song was released on 13 May 2015. Zedd embarked on the True Colors Tour from August 2015 to January 2016 in support of the album. The album has achieved moderate success, peaking at number one for Billboard's Dance/Electronic Albums, as well as charting on various international charts. ==Background== In late February during an interview with a radio station, when answering a question on his album-making processes, Zedd stated that \"I'm really far advanced in my album right now. It's probably still going to take me a good month, month-and- a-half to finish it, you know, the last touches. And then depending on if I can keep that promise of one-and-a-half months, it's going to come out sooner or later!\" In the middle of March, Zedd took on his Twitter and uploaded a series of short videos that teased True Colors. The videos uploaded unveiled a website that was mostly empty except for Zedd's logo and a timer counting down to the March 18, at 5 P.M. On 7 April 2015, Zedd finally released the name, artwork, and release date of the album via Instagram. The artwork features a tree with an array of bright colours as the leaves. He also announced that T-Mobile, through a promotional partnership, offered 250,000 free downloads of the remix of \"I Want You to Know\" to the fans who followed T-Mobile's Facebook and Twitter on the morning of 8 April. ==Promotions== The website revealed the start of a colour-themed promotional campaign for the album that covered 10 North American venues, with a new song to be premiered in each location. When talking about his album, Zedd remarked that he \"...wanted fans to experience the album in a whole new way\". He further said that each song is associated with a color, and this is evident through his promotional tour, in which each location has different color scheme to match with the vibe of the song previewed in the location. Zedd commented during the promotional campaign in Los Angeles that, \"To me, certain things sound a certain color. A lot of reverb will always sound cold, which will always make me think blue. On this song (\"Straight Into the Fire\"), the drop is very energetic and very aggressive, kind of like fire, too, so this one was super easy to pick orange.\" In Austin, the theme colour was purple, while yellow was used in Phoenix, and blue was used in Denver.
