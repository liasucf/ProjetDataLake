    "text": "Marine Industries Limited (MIL) was a Canadian ship building and rail car manufacturing company, in Sorel-Tracy, Quebec, with a shipyard located on the Richelieu river about 1 km from the St. Lawrence River. It employed up to 10,000 people during the post World War II boom. Opened in 1937, the yard saw many contracts during its early years for vessels used on the Great Lakes and Canada's Atlantic coast. MIL began building railroad cars in 1957, with production focused mainly on flat cars, gondolas and covered hoppers for the domestic and export markets. In 1986 the federal government asked Quebec to rationalize its shipyards, which saw MIL merge with Davie Shipbuildinghttps://www.wrecksite.eu/ownerBuilderView.aspx?599 in Lauzon; the Sorel shipyard was called M.I.L. Tracy (for Tracy, Quebec) and the Lauzon shipyard was called M.I.L. Lauzon. Shortly after the merger, the new company, MIL Davie Shipbuilding closed the Sorel shipyard along with the Versatile Vickers shipyard in Montreal, resulting in a total loss of 1,700 jobs. ==Ships built== MIL's Sorel shipyard was responsible for numerous Royal Canadian Navy, Canadian Coast Guard and CN Marine vessels. ===Warships=== * ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** ** * ** * ** * ** * ** ** * Unclassed hydrofoil ** ===Icebreakers=== * A.T Cameron (1958) - built for the federal Fisheries Research Board, sold and renamed Arctic Ranger and RV Arctic Discoverer * * * * === Coast Guard vessels === * === Ferries=== * MV Howe Sound Queen - car and passenger ferry built as MV Napoleon L in 1964 and sold to BC Ferries in 1971 (hull unknown) * * * MV Ambrose Shea (1967) - built for CN Marine, car and passenger ferry was transferred to Marine Atlantic; sold and renamed MV Erg and scrapped * MV Camille-Marcoux (1974) - car ferry for Government of Quebec and operated route from Matane\u2013Baie-Comeau\u2013Godbout - scrapped 2017 ===Floating dry dock === * Pamamax drydock 1982; acquired by Halifax Shipyard and renamed Novadock ==References== Category:Shipbuilding companies of Canada Category:Manufacturing companies of Canada Category:Former defence companies of Canada Category:Defunct companies of Quebec Category:Companies based in Quebec Category:Sorel-Tracy ",
