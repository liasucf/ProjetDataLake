He was a younger son of Sir John Erskine, 3rd Baronet, M.P. of Alva, Clackmannanshire, and Catherine Sinclair, was probably educated at Eton College and entered Lincoln's Inn to study law in 1728. However, instead of a legal career he joined the Army and rose to the rank of Lieutenant-General in 1765. He succeeded to the baronetcy and family estate when his elder brother Charles was killed in action at the Battle of Lauffeld in 1747. Erskine then served as Member of Parliament (MP) for Ayr Burghs 1749\u20131754 and for Anstruther Easter Burghs 1754\u20131765. He died in 1765. He had married Janet, the daughter of Peter Wedderburn, Lord Chesterhall, and with her had two sons and a daughter. He was succeeded by his eldest son James, who later became the 2nd Earl of Rosslyn. ==References== * *Historical list of MPs: A * Category:1710s births Category:1765 deaths Category:Members of Lincoln's Inn Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for Scottish constituencies Category:British MPs 1747\u20131754 Category:British MPs 1754\u20131761 Category:British MPs 1761\u20131768 Category:67th Regiment of Foot officers Category:King's Own Scottish Borderers officers Category:Royal Scots officers Henry ",
