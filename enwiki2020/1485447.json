    "text": "Corona Extra is a pale lager produced by Mexican brewery Cervecer\u00eda Modelo and owned by Belgian company AB InBev. It is commonly served with a wedge of lime or lemon in the neck of the bottle to add tartness and flavour. It is one of the top-selling beers worldwide, and Corona Extra has been the top-selling imported drink in the U.S. since 1998. == Ingredients == Mexican Corona truck According to Sinebrychoff, a Finnish company owned by the Carlsberg Group, Corona Extra contains barley malt, corn, hops, yeast, antioxidants (ascorbic acid), and propylene glycol alginate as a stabilizer. Propylene glycol alginate is a synthetic, colorless, odorless, tasteless liquid that belongs to the same chemical class as alcohol. ==Packaging== Corona beer is available in a variety of bottled presentations, ranging from the ampolleta (labeled Coronita and just referred as the cuartito) up to the Corona Familiar (known as the familiar, Litro or Mega). A draught version also exists, as does canned Corona in some markets. In Spain, the beer is branded as (literally, 'little crown'), as renowned winemaker Bodegas Torres has owned the trademark for \"Coronas\" since 1907. The packaging is otherwise unchanged. In the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and the US, smaller, 210ml (7 fl. oz) bottles of the beer are also branded as \"Coronita\". ==Sponsorship partners== cl = bottle and carton that is marked 6 \u00d7 0.33 L (partially visible). This bottle features eight languages for export to the Common Market. Corona was a longtime sponsor of boxing in Mexico, including sponsorship of Saturday night fights on Televisa, but reduced its sponsorship after Anheuser-Busch InBev took full control of the brand. In the United States, Constellation Brands continues to sponsor boxing through Corona, most notably with undefeated featherweight champion Floyd Mayweather Jr. Corona was the title sponsor of the LPGA Tour tournament Corona Championship (later Tres Marias Championship) from 2005 to 2009, and of the NASCAR Mexico Corona Series (now NASCAR PEAK Mexico Series) from 2004 to 2011, the most followed stock car racing series in Mexico. In addition, Corona is a \"second sponsor\" for four of the top-flight professional football teams of Mexico's first division, Liga MX. The teams sponsored by Corona are Atlas, Santos Laguna, Quer\u00e9taro, Puebla, Chiapas, Am\u00e9rica, Pachuca, Morelia, Le\u00f3n, Toluca, and Necaxa. Corona also sponsored the Mexico national football team. Corona and the ATP had a 5\u00bd year sponsorship in which Corona was the ATP's premier worldwide sponsor. Corona was also the title sponsor of the SBK Superbike World Championship from 1998 until 2007. ==Use in cocktails== Some bars and restaurants serve a \"Coronarita\", a beer cocktail that consists of a bottle of Corona upturned to drain into a margarita. ==Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic== Corona bottle with a lime slice As of February 2020, after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, Corona suffered a $170 million loss in earnings in the virus' origin country of China. The company attributed the sales drop to fewer people going out in public, with many bars and restaurants being forced to close down. Multiple brands of beer experienced relative sales slumps in the country, as the spread of COVID-19 had generally dampened public activities. Sales were typically high over the period due to Chinese New Year celebrations. However, Constellation Brands reported a 5% increase in sales of Corona Extra in the U.S. in the four weeks ending February 16, though the company's new hard seltzer had to stop promotion because its ads were perceived as being in \"poor taste\". CNN reported that a survey by 5W Public Relations said that 38% of Americans would not buy Corona \"under any circumstances\" because of the outbreak, and another 14% said they would not order a Corona in public. The survey of 737 American beer drinkers over the age of 21 was conducted via phone on February 25 and 26, 2020. The PR firm's news release said the survey was done \"regarding their opinions about the popular Mexican beer brand, Corona, as a result of the deadly COVID-19 coronavirus that's spreading around the world\". The company did not publish detailed methodological data. The question responsible for the 38% statistic did not explicitly mention COVID-19 as a motivation, which might have instead simply indicated a preference for a different brand of beer. Among regular Corona drinkers, only 4% said they planned to stop drinking the brand. Grupo Modelo announced on Twitter that it would stop producing Corona beer during a shutdown of non-essential businesses lasting from March 30 to April 30 by the Mexican government due to COVID-19. ==See also== * Beer in Mexico * Cocktail garnish * Shandy * Compa\u00f1\u00eda Cervecera de Puerto Rico ==References== ==External links== * Category:Beer in Mexico Category:Mexican brands Category:Products introduced in 1925 ",
