    "text": "Empress Bian, personal name unknown, was an empress of Cao Wei during the Three Kingdoms period of China. She was married to Cao Huan (Emperor Yuan), the fifth and last emperor of Cao Wei. She was a daughter of Bian Lin (\u535e\u9716) and a granddaughter of Bian Bing (\u535e\u79c9), a brother of Lady Bian (the mother of Cao Pi, the first Wei emperor). Cao Huan married Empress Bian in 263, when he was 17. Her age is not known. There was no further records of her activities, as her husband was himself under the tight control of the regent Sima Zhao. There is also no record of her activities after her husband abdicated in favour of Sima Zhao's son Sima Yan, ending the Cao Wei state and establishing the Jin dynasty, although presumably, since her husband was created the Prince of Chenliu, that she became the Princess of Chenliu. She also was presumably granted a posthumous imperial title after her death (as her husband was), but there is no record of what that posthumous name was. ==See also== * Cao Wei family trees#Lady Huan * Lists of people of the Three Kingdoms ==References== * Chen, Shou (3rd century).
