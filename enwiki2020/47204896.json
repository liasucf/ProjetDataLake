It was owned between 1977 and 1984 by Patrick (Patsy) Lennon who some years later built and owned the Limelight nightclub and Dome Bar (two adjacent premises in Ormeau Avenue, Belfast). The Harp Bar is synonymous with the history of punk rock, particularly from a Northern Ireland context.Canning, Margaret (2013) \"Middle-age kicks won't be hard to beat when Harp Bar goes live\", Belfast Telegraph, 27 August 2013. Retrieved 11 July 2015 It was functioning as a city centre bar and music venue at the height of the conflict/troubles in Northern Ireland. Despite tensions in the city and occasional bomb attacks on the premises by paramilitaries the bar continued to trade and young people from all across the city and further afield regularly attended gigs. Many local punk rock bands including The Outcasts, Rudi, Stiff Little Fingers, The Defects and others appeared at the venue. It was quickly recognised as the premier punk rock venue in Ireland and started attracting touring bands such as The Nipple Erectors and The Monochrome Set. According to one regular, \"It stank. It smelled of armpit and stale beer. The toilets were DREADFUL.\" They loved it. Alan Dein \"The Godfather of Ulster Punk\", BBC Radio 4, 5 July 2012. Retrieved 29 December 2017 The original venue closed in the 1990s, and a new Harp Bar opened elsewhere in Belfast in 2013, as a tribute to the original venue. In 2019 there were plans to build a hotel on the Hill Street site. ==References== Category:Music venues in Belfast Category:Former pubs Category:Former music venues in the United Kingdom ",
