    "text": "PropertyPro.ng is a Nigeria web-based platform for property rentals and sales. The company was founded in February 2013 with a vision of re-organizing the rental market in Nigeria that was soiled as a result of trust issues and fraud. In a bid to tackle the trust and fraud issues, the company created a system that exercises a lot of control on how participating agents offer their services. The agents are expected to conduct their business and customer relations in line with Tolet\u2019s prescribed code of business conduct. ==History== The company started with the founders' collective personal savings of $400 in 2012. The company was founded in February 2013 by a team of four visionary young men: Fikayo Ogundipe, Sulaiman Balogun, Oladapo Eludire, and Oluwaseyi Ayeni. The company started by reaching out to landlords and agents in Lagos. ToLet.com.ng is one of Spark\u2019s (Jason and Bastian\u2019s \u201caccelerator\u201d fund) portfolio companies.

In September 2016, Tolet.com.ng raised $1.2m in a Series A funding round led by Malaysia-based Frontier Digital Ventures. The company employs area specialists who inspect all properties before posting them on the website. The website started off as a rental property focused service, before its adoption of sales properties 11 months ago.
