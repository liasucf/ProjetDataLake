    "text": "\"Some People\" is a song by British musician Belouis Some, released as the third single from his 1985 eponymous debut album. The song reached the top 40 in the UK, peaking at No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart in April 1986. In the U.S., the song reached No. 67 on the Billboard Hot 100. A cover version by Murray Head was recorded and released as a single in 1986. ==Music video== The music video was directed by Storm Thorgerson, who also directed the controversial video to Belouis Some's earlier hit, \"Imagination\". The video features scenes from seaside towns on the east coast of England, including Aldeburgh in Suffolk. After the music video was filmed, watchmaker Swatch paid for a second take which included extras dressed in Swatch apparel. The company hoped that Swatch would become so associated with the song that when the music video aired, people thought of Swatch even though the product was not present. \"It becomes a Swatch video,\" said Nancy Kadner, director of advertising for the Swiss-based company. ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1985) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Italian Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|34 |- |align=\"left\"|South African Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|9 |- |align=\"left\"|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|33 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|67 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1986) !Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Irish Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|21 |} ==References== Category:1984 songs Category:1985 singles Category:1986 singles Category:Belouis Some songs Category:Murray Head songs Category:Parlophone singles Category:Songs written by Belouis Some ",
