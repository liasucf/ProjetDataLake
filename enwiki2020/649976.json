    "text": "Yuan-Cheng \"Bert\" Fung (September 15, 1919 \u2013 December 15, 2019) was an American bioengineer. He is regarded as a founding figure of bioengineering, tissue engineering, and the \"Founder of Modern Biomechanics\".YC \u201cBert\u201d Fung: The Father of Modern Biomechanics (pdf) ==Biography== Fung was born in Jiangsu Province, China in 1919. He earned a bachelor's degree in 1941 and a master's degree in 1943 from the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University in mainland China and reinstated in Taiwan), and earned a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in 1948. Fung was Professor Emeritus and Research Engineer at the University of California San Diego. He published prominent texts along with Pin Tong who was then at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology. Fung died at the Jacobs Medical Center in San Diego, California, aged 100, on December 15, 2019. Republished as: ==Research== He is the author of numerous books including Foundations of Solid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics, and a series of books on Biomechanics. He is also one of the principal founders of the Journal of Biomechanics and was a past chair of the ASME International Applied Mechanics Division. In 1972, Fung established the Biomechanics Symposium under the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This biannual summer meeting, first held at the Georgia Institute of Technology, became the annual Summer Bioengineering Conference. Fung and colleagues were also the first to recognize the importance of residual stress on arterial mechanical behavior. ===Fung's Law=== Fung's famous exponential strain constitutive equation for preconditioned soft tissues is :w = \\frac{1}{2}\\left[q + c\\left( e^Q -1 \\right) \\right] with :q=a_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl} \\qquad Q=b_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl} quadratic forms of Green-Lagrange strains E_{ij} and a_{ijkl}, b_{ijkl} and c material constants. w is a strain energy function per volume unit, which is the mechanical strain energy for a given temperature. Materials that follow this law are known as Fung-elastic. ==Honors and awards== * Theodore von Karman Medal, 1976 * Otto Laporte Award, 1977 * Worcester Reed Warner Medal, 1984WORCESTER REED WARNER MEDAL RECIPIENTS * Jean-Leonard-Marie Poiseuille Award, 1986The International Society of Biorheology: Yuan-Cheng Fung, 1986 Recipient of the Jean-Leonard- Marie Poiseuille Award * Timoshenko Medal, 1991 * Lissner Award for Bioengineering, from ASME * Borelli Medal, from ASB * Landis Award, from Microcirculation Society * Alza Award, from BMES * Melville Medal, 1994MELVILLE MEDAL RECIPIENTS * United States National Academy of Engineering Founders Award (NAE Founders Award), 1998 * National Medal of Science, 2000 * Fritz J. and Dolores H.
