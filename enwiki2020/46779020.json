Learning of her relationship status from social media, her mother, Linda, tells her to come home in order to move on, where she reunites with her agoraphobic brother, Jeffrey. Initially refusing, Linda agrees to go on the trip with her daughter. In Ecuador, after they check into the upscale hotel, Emily meets a handsome man named James at the hotel bar, and they begin a relationship. After one night of drinking and dancing with James, Emily and her mother take a sightseeing day trip with him. During their ride, a white van rams James' Jeep and the masked men abduct Emily and Linda. James escapes, but Linda suspects he was in on the kidnapping plot from the start. Emily awakens inside a cell and begins to panic, while Linda tries to calm herself by reading men's magazines. The leader, Hector Morgado, contacts Jeffrey and demands $100,000 in ransom money. Morgado then has his nephew take both women away from the kidnappers' hideout to another location. They manage to escape from their captors' car and stow away into a passing truck. As it drives away, Emily kills the leader's nephew who is chasing them by pounding his head with a shovel. The truck's driver then stops his truck and leaves them both in the middle of the jungle. They find a phone at a nearby bar, where they call the U.S. State Department officer Morgan Russell, saying that they are in peril, and Morgan advises them to go to the US Embassy in Bogota, Colombia. They meet a rugged-looking American named Roger Simmons. He agrees to help them find the consulate. After the three share a meal, Morgado and his men track them down. Morgado is about to kill them both as revenge for his only nephew's death, but Linda distracts him while Emily retrieves a nearby spear gun with which to threaten him. As she retrieves it, she accidentally fires it, killing Morgado's only son. They manage to escape with Simmons onto a boat. Soon, however, they are forced off the boat when the captain detects another boat nearby that is looking for the two women. Meanwhile, Jeffrey, learning that his mother and sister have been kidnapped, calls Morgan at the State Department, saying he will join forces with the agents in order to find his mother and sister. Morgan reluctantly agrees. In Colombia, Emily, Linda, and Simmons hike through the jungle until Simmons falls to his death from a cliff. Later, Emily passes out from the effects of a tapeworm infestation. After a local village doctor removes the tapeworm from her body, Morgado and his men track them down again. They spot a zip line and decide to use it to escape. Unfortunately, the zip line is good for only one person. Linda forces Emily to leave her behind and is recaptured. Emily safely arrives at the US Consulate. Determined to find her mother, she seeks help from two feisty American women veterans, Ruth and Barb, whom Emily met at the resort in Ecuador. Ruth and Barb take her to James, who was conspiring with Morgado, to the apartment where he is being interrogated for the kidnappers' location. With the ladies' help, Emily rescues her mother at the kidnappers' apartment. They try to escape in another truck, but Morgado intercepts them. As he is about to kill Emily, Linda blows her dog whistle, summoning a dog that attacks Morgado. U.S. State Department agents arrive to arrest Morgado, and Jeffrey reunites with his mother and sister. One year later, Emily and Linda take another trip to Kuala Lumpur, where Emily meets another man, who offers her a drink. Emily refuses, and she and Linda proceed to dance. == Cast == * Amy Schumer as Emily Louise Middleton, Jeffrey's sister, Linda's daughter and Michael's girlfriend * Goldie Hawn as Linda Middleton, Emily and Jeffrey\u2019s mother * Ike Barinholtz as Jeffrey Middleton, Emily\u2019s agoraphobic brother and Linda's son * Wanda Sykes as Ruth, Barb's friend and a woman Emily and Linda meet on vacation * Joan Cusack as Barb, Ruth's friend * Christopher Meloni as Roger Simmons * \u00d3scar Jaenada as Morgado * Bashir Salahuddin as Morgan Russell, an officer at the U.S. State Department * Tom Bateman as James * Randall Park as Michael, Emily's boyfriend who breaks up with her * Tom Choi as the Colonel * Raven Goodwin as Lew, Emily\u2019s boss *Al Madrigal as Embassy Official * Arturo Castro as Dr. Armando == Production == On May 22, 2015, trade reports announced that Amy Schumer would star in an action-comedy film scripted by Katie Dippold, which was rewritten by Schumer and her sister Kim Caramele.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"B\" on an A+ to F scale. Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"The tantalizing enticement of Goldie Hawn pairing with Amy Schumer for a mother- daughter, road-trip buddy comedy has some moments, but never fulfills its promise. As their onscreen adventures and antics grow zanier and broader, the laughs actually grow softer and more sporadic.\" ===Home media=== Snatched was released on DVD and Blu-Ray August 8, 2017. == References == == External links == * * * Category:2017 films Category:2017 action comedy films Category:American action comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films about kidnapping Category:Films about families Category:Films about vacationing Category:Films directed by Jonathan Levine Category:Films produced by Peter Chernin Category:Films scored by Theodore Shapiro Category:Films set in Colombia Category:Films set in Ecuador Category:Films shot in Hawaii Category:Films with screenplays by Katie Dippold Category:TSG Entertainment films Category:2017 comedy films ",
