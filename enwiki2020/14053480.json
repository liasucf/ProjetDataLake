    "text": "The works of William Gibson encompass literature, journalism, acting, recitation, and performance art. Primarily renowned as a novelist and short fiction writer in the cyberpunk milieu, Gibson invented the metaphor of cyberspace in \"Burning Chrome\" (1982) and emerged from obscurity in 1984 with the publication of his debut novel Neuromancer. Gibson's early short fiction is recognized as cyberpunk's finest work, effectively renovating the science fiction genre which had been hitherto considered widely insignificant. At the turn of the 1990s, after the completion of his Sprawl trilogy of novels, Gibson contributed the text to a number of performance art pieces and exhibitions, as well as writing lyrics for musicians Yellow Magic Orchestra and Debbie Harry. He wrote the critically acclaimed artist's book Agrippa (a book of the dead) in 1992 before co-authoring The Difference Engine, an alternate history novel that would become a central work of the steampunk genre. He then spent an unfruitful period as a Hollywood screenwriter, with few of his projects seeing the light of day and those that did being critically unsuccessful.Johnny Mnemonic at Rotten Tomatoes. Retrieved 2008-01-15. Although he had largely abandoned short fiction by the mid-1990s, Gibson returned to writing novels, completing his second trilogy, the Bridge trilogy at the close of the millennium. After writing two episodes of the television series The X-Files around this time, Gibson was featured as the subject of a documentary film, No Maps for These Territories, in 2000. Gibson has been invited to address the National Academy of Sciences (1993) and the Directors Guild of America (2003) and has had a plethora of articles published in outlets such as Wired, Rolling Stone and The New York Times. His third trilogy of novels, Pattern Recognition (2003), Spook Country (2007) and Zero History (2010) have put Gibson's work onto mainstream bestseller lists for the first time. == Novels == * Sprawl trilogy: *# Neuromancer (1984) *# Count Zero (1986) *# Mona Lisa Overdrive (1988) * The Difference Engine (1990; with Bruce Sterling) * Bridge trilogy: *# Virtual Light (1993) *# Idoru (1996) *# All Tomorrow's Parties (1999) Gibson discussing Spook Country (2007) on August 8, 2007 while touring in support of the novel. * Blue Ant trilogy: *# Pattern Recognition (2003) *# Spook Country (2007) *# Zero History (2010) * The Peripheral (2014) * Agency (2020) == Short fiction == === Collected === * \"Burning Chrome\" (1986, preface by Bruce Sterling): ** \"Johnny Mnemonic\" (May 1981, Omni) ** \"The Gernsback Continuum\" (1981, Universe 11) ** \"Fragments of a Hologram Rose\" (Summer 1977, UnEarth 3) ** \"The Belonging Kind\", with John Shirley (1981, Shadows 4) ** \"Hinterlands\" (October 1981, Omni) ** \"Red Star, Winter Orbit\", with Bruce Sterling (July 1983, Omni) ** \"New Rose Hotel\" (July 1984, Omni) ** \"The Winter Market\" (November 1985, Vancouver) ** \"Dogfight\", with Michael Swanwick (July 1985, Omni) ** \"Burning Chrome\" (July 1982, Omni) === Uncollected === The San Francisco \u2013 Oakland Bay Bridge, a fictional squatted version of which formed the setting for Gibson's short story \"Skinner's Room\" (1990).
