After he was educated in Habsburg Kingdom of Hungary \u0160krinjari\u0107 first worked as a teacher in a school in Aszalo and later as a rector of a school in Vara\u017edin. He was also a notary and judge in Vara\u017edin. He reached the position of a president of the octaval court. == Trial == In 1588 \u0160krinjari\u0107 was accused of committing adultery with a certain Ur\u0161ula Geljani\u0107 and for being a father of the child she gave birth to three years after her husband died. \u0160krinjari\u0107 was stripped of all judicial privileges and forced to hand over the key and stamp of the city to the new judge. Geljani\u0107 was taken to prison but managed to escape. After \u0160krinjari\u0107 was accused for helping her escape he found her and brought her to trial where she swore that she had no relation with him. Based on the court's decision, Geljani\u0107 was \"put into shackles\" in the house of the city guardian to be tortured to confess who was the father of her child. \u0160krinjari\u0107 was released of accusations because he swore innocence, while the fate of the widow Geljani\u0107 is unknown. == Bibliography == In 1587 \u0160krinjari\u0107 published his Latin language work De Agno Paschali in the Printing House of Ivan Manlius. A copy of this work can be found in the University Library in Budapest. \u0160krinjari\u0107 dedicated this book to Antun Vramec. The relation between \u0160krinjari\u0107 and Vramec corresponded to the relation between a student and his teacher. Although he published his only work on Latin language and there is no single sentence he wrote using Kajkavian dialect, because of the influence on the other members of the Vara\u017edin literary circle, he is frequently connected with first written Kajkavian works. == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * (copy at Google Books, not accessible in the EU) * (another copy, digitised and freely accessible at the dLib.si, portal of the Digital library of Slovenia) Category:1520 births Category:1592 deaths ",
