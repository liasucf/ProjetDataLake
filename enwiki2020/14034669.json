She made her first voyage, from Bremen to New York City, 7\u201316 September 1946, carrying \"more than 500 Jewish immigrants from the United States zone of Germany\" including \"ten orphaned Jewish children...brought... under the sponsorship of the United States Committee for the care of European Children\" . She completed her last crossing, from Bremen to New York, on 17 July 1949, on which passengers were mostly from Stuttgart, Germany, and were of Armenian descent. In 1952 she was intended to be transferred to the U.S. Navy as a transport but was not acquired. In 1965 she was converted to a dry cargo ship for Central Gulf Steamship Corp. and renamed Green Bay. On 17 August 1971, she was sunk in Qui Nonh harbor after an underwater explosion caused by Viet Cong frogmen while discharging military supplies. On 1 September 1971, she was refloated and towed to Hong Kong where she was scrapped in 1972. ==References== Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington Category:1945 ships ",
