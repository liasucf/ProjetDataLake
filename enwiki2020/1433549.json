Later on, in 2005, \"Meygan\", \"Fianna\", \"Cameron\" and \"Dana\" joined the Bratz Babyz group. Also, in 2005, they released the 'Hair Flair' collection. Instead of having plastic hair, the dolls had fiber hair like regular Bratz dolls. ==Bratz Big Babyz== Soon after, they made Bratz Big Babyz; dolls approximately five times the size of regular Babyz dolls.
