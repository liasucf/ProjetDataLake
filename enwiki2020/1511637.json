    "text": "Church station or Church Street station is a Muni Metro light rail station in San Francisco, California. It is located at the six-way intersection of Market Street, Church Street and 14th Street in the Duboce Triangle neighborhood. Service at the station began in June 1980. ==Station layout== alt=A red-and- silver light rail train at a surface stop in the center of a city street The station consists of two side platforms next to the tracks on the second level down with the concourse mezzanine level overlooking it. The J Church line, which enters and exits the Market Street subway tunnel in a portal near the station, connects to this station at two surface-level platform. The inbound stop is near the corner of Church and Market Streets, while the outbound stop is near the corner of Church and 14th Streets. The F Market & Wharves streetcar line, running along Market Street, also has stops at the intersection. The N Judah line also exits the Market Street tunnel before reaching the Church Street station and stops one block away at Church and Duboce Avenue. At both Church Street station and Castro Street station, there is only one stairway on each side of Market Street leading into the station. (All other stations on the Market Street subway have entrances spread out along the length of the station.) One of these entrances is located on the northwest corner of Market and 14th Street, and the other is on the southwest corner of Market and Church Street. As part of August 2020 changes to Muni Metro, the J became an all-surface line. The J terminates at the inbound platform on Church Street, providing an accessible transfer between the J and subway trains. A mini-high platform will be constructed on the inbound platform at Church and Duboce, and an outbound mini-high platform will be built on Church Street south of Market Street, allowing the J to be re- extended slightly to Duboce Street in October 2020. The forced transfer at Church station - which requires J Church riders to cross two streets and use two elevators to transfer - was criticized by disability advocates. ==In popular culture== Church Street station is featured in the Nick Nolte/Eddie Murphy cop dramedy 48 Hours, with shots of entrances, plaza and platform levels, and train operations. ==References== ==External links== Category:Muni Metro stations Category:Market Street (San Francisco) Category:Western Addition, San Francisco Category:Railway stations located underground in California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1980 ",
