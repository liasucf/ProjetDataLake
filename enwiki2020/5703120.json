    "text": "The Naung Mung scimitar babbler (Napothera naungmungensis) is a bird in the family Pellorneidae, described as new to science in 2005. Naung Mung scimitar babbler is found in temperate rainforest on steep, sub-Himalayan hillsides. It was discovered in February 2004 in far northern Myanmar, and is named after the village of Naung Mung, the closest settlement to its discovery site. It is believed to be fairly common within its range. Due to its recent description, its conservation status has not been formally evaluated, however. ==References== *Collar, N.J. 2011.
