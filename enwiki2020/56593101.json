    "text": "Retama raetam is a species of flowering plant in the family Fabaceae, native to northern Africa from the Western Sahara to Sudan, Sicily, the Sinai Peninsula, Palestine and Saudi Arabia, and widely naturalized elsewhere. File:Osmia gracilicornis male 1.jpg|Flowers with pollinating bee, Osmia gracilicornis ==Taxonomy== The species was first described in 1775 by Peter Forssk\u00e5l as Genista raetam. The epithet was derived from the Arabic name which Forssk\u00e5l transcribed as \"r\u00e6t\u00e6m beh\u00e2m\". The species was transferred to Retama by Philip Barker-Webb and Sabin Berthelot in part of a publication that has been dated to 1842. The species that occurs in the Canary Islands is now considered to be Retama rhodorhizoides, rather than R. raetam, although the latter name has been used for Canary Island plants. ==References== Category:Genisteae Category:Flora of North Africa Category:Flora of Sudan Category:Flora of Sicily Category:Flora of Sinai Category:Flora of Saudi Arabia Category:Plants described in 1775 ",
