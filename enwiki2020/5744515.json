    "text": "The B\u1e5bhat-Tray\u012b (literally \"the great triad (of compositions)\") refers to three early Sanskrit encyclopedias of medicine (Skt \u0101yurveda). These are contrasted with the Laghu-Tray\u012b or the \"lesser triad\", a secondary set of later authoritative compositions. This classification was first devised probably at some time in the 19th century, although its earliest use has not yet (2008) been identified. The classification is not known to authors before the 18th century. It is part of an effort to create a formal canon for ayurvedic literature. There are older medical encyclopedias than are not included in the B\u1e5bhat-Tray\u012b, for example the Bhe\u1e37a-sa\u1e43hit\u0101. ==Overview== The following three works constitute the B\u1e5bhat-Tray\u012b: * Charaka Samhita (\u091a\u0930\u0915\u0938\u0902\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e) was composed by Agnivesa (\u0905\u0917\u094d\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0947\u0936) and later edited by Charaka (\u091a\u0930\u0915). * Sushruta Samhita (\u0938\u0941\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924\u0938\u0902\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e) was composed by Sushruta (\u0938\u0941\u0936\u094d\u0930\u0941\u0924). * Ashtanga Hridayam Samhita (\u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0919\u0939\u0943\u0926\u092f\u0938\u0902\u0939\u093f\u0924\u093e) was composed by Vagbhata (\u0935\u093e\u0917\u094d\u092d\u091f) (fl. ca. AD 610, in Sindh). A work called A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-sa\u1e43graha (\u0905\u0937\u094d\u091f\u093e\u0917\u094d\u0919\u0938\u0902\u0917\u094d\u0930\u0939) is also ascribed to the last author, V\u0101gbha\u1e6da \u0935\u093e\u0917\u094d\u092d\u091f. It is a more diffuse work than the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga-h\u1e5bdaya-sa\u1e43hit\u0101, and is in mixed prose and verse (the Ashtanga Hridayam is in verse only). These two works are versions of the same material, but their exact relationship, authorship and priority is still debated by scholars. There are thousands of medieval manuscripts of the Ashtanga Hridayam in archives and libraries across India, while the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga Sa\u1e43graha is rare, having survived to the 20th century in only a few partial copies. It is thus clear that the Ashtanga Hridayam is the text that was most widely studied in pre-modern times, and was in fact the standard textbook of ayurveda for several hundred years. In spite of this, probably through a misunderstanding some time in the early 20th century, it is the A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101\u1e45ga- sa\u1e43graha that is primarily taught as part of the modern ayurvedic BAMS syllabus at Government ayurvedic colleges. The B\u1e5bhat-Tray\u012b or \"Triad of the Great\" is also sometimes called the V\u1e5bddha-Tray\u012b, which means \"the triad of the old/mature (classics or authors)\". All three works have been published in numerous Sanskrit editions, and all have been translated into English more than once. The English translations of P. V. Sharma and of Srikanthamurthy are considered among the better ones. The German translation of the Ashtanga Hridayam by Hilgenberg and Kirfel is widely considered the very best and scholarly translation available. ==References== * G. J.
