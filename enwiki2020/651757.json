    "text": "On May 11, 2004, the website of the militant Islamist group Muntada al-Ansar broadcast a video titled \"Sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi slaughters an American infidel with his hands and promises former president George W. Bush more\", which shows American citizen Nick Berg being decapitated. The web page, on a site located in Malaysia, was then immediately shut down. It is unclear whether al-Zarqawi is one of the men in the video. Both al-Zarqawi and Muntada al-Ansar are associated with the Al-Qaida movement. ==See also== *Abu Musab al-Zarqawi ==References== ==External links== * Muntada al-Ansar (Archive) Category:Islamist groups ",
