    "text": "John Selden's 1617 section on the name of Syria and Assyria (from the 1629 edition). The name Syria is latinized from the (Greek ). Herodotus used it loosely to refer to Cappadocia.Hdt. VII.63. In Greek usage, Sur\u00eda and Assur\u00eda were used almost interchangeably, but in the Roman Empire, Syria and Assyria came to be used as distinct geographical terms. \"Syria\" in the Roman Empire period referred to the region of Syria (the western Levant, \"those parts of the Empire situated between Asia Minor and Egypt\"), while As\u014drist\u0101n was part of the Sasanian Empire and only very briefly came under Roman control (AD 116-118, marking the historical peak of Roman expansion). Etymologically, the name Syria is connected to Assyria, ultimately from the Akkadian . Theodor N\u00f6ldeke in 1881 was the first to give philological support to the assumption that Syria and Assyria have the same etymology,The Origin of the Terms \u2018Syria(n)\u2019 and Suryoyo: Once Again, Johny Messo a suggestion going back to John Selden (1617). Current academic opinion favours the connection. Modern Syria ( \"Syrian Arab Republic\", since 1961) inherits its name from the Ottoman Syria Vilayet, established in 1865. The choice of the ancient Latin name for the Ottoman province reflects a growing historical consciousness among the local intellectuals at the time.The Arabs of the Ottoman Empire, 1516-1918: A Social and Cultural History, pp. 177, 181-182. Bruce Masters, Cambridge University Press, 2013. The Classical Arabic name for the region is bil\u0101d a\u0161- \u0161a'm (\"land to the north\", Modern Standard Arabic a\u0161-\u0161\u0101m) from \"left hand; northern\".The Levant as \"the northern region\" (as seen from Arabia), from the convention of east-oriented maps. Lane, Arabic Lexicon (1863) I.1400. In contrast, Baalshamin (), was a Semitic sky-god in Canaan/Phoenicia and ancient Palmyra. Hence, Sham refers to (heaven or sky). ==Etymology== Majority mainstream scholarly opinion now strongly supports the already dominant position that 'Syrian' and Syriac indeed derived from 'Assyrian', and the 21st-century discovery of the \u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription seems to clearly confirm that Syria is ultimately derived from the Assyrian term A\u0161\u0161\u016br\u0101yu.Frye, R. N. (October 1992). \"Assyria and Syria: Synonyms\" (PDF). Journal of Near Eastern Studies 51 (4): 281\u2013285. doi:10.1086/373570. The question was addressed from the Early Classical period through to the Renaissance Era by the likes of Herodotus, Strabo, Justinus, Michael the Syrian and John Selden, with each of these stating that Syrian/Syriac was synonymous and derivative of Assyrian. Acknowledgments being made as early as the 5th century BC in the Hellenistic world that the Indo-European term Syrian was a derived from the much earlier Assyrian. Some 19th-century historians such as Ernest Renan had dismissed the etymological identity of the two toponyms.\"Syria is not but a contraction of Assyria or Assyrian; this according to the Greek pronunciation. The Greeks applied this name to all of Asia Minor.\" cited after Sa Grandeur Mgr. David, Archev\u00eaque Syrien De Damas, Grammair De La Langue Aram\u00e9enne Selon Les Deux Dialects Syriaque Et Chaldaique Vol. 1,, (Imprimerie Des P\u00e9res Dominicains, Mossoul, 1896), 12. Various alternatives had been suggested, including derivation from Subartu (a term which most modern scholars in fact accept is itself an early name for Assyria, and which was located in northern Mesopotamia), the Hurrian toponym , or (the Phoenician name of Tyre). Syria is known as (, referring to the Hurrian occupants prior to the Aramaean invasion) in the Amarna Period Egypt, and as , \u02be in Biblical Hebrew. J. A. Tvedtnes had suggested that the Greek Suria is loaned from Coptic, and due to a regular Coptic development of to . In this case, the name would derive directly from that of the language isolate-speaking Hurrians, and be unrelated to the name A\u0161\u0161ur. Tvedtnes' explanation was rejected as highly unlikely by Frye in 1992. Various theories have been advanced as to the etymological connections between the two terms. Some scholars suggest that the term Assyria included a definite article, similar to the function of the Arabic language \"Al-\".A New Classical Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography, Mythology and Geography, Sir William Smith, Charles Anthon, Harper & Brothers, 1862 \"Even when the name of Syria is used in its ordinary narrower sense, it is often confounded with Assyria, which only differs from Syria by having the definite article prefixed.\" Theodor N\u00f6ldeke in 1881 gave philological support to the assumption that Syria and Assyria have the same etymology, a suggestion going back to John Selden (1617) rooted in his own Hebrew tradition about the descent of Assyrians from Jokshan. Majority and mainstream current academic opinion strongly favours that Syria originates from Assyria. A hieroglyphic Luwian and Phoenician bilingual monumental inscription found in \u00c7inek\u00f6y, Turkey, (the \u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription) belonging to Urikki, vassal king of Que (i.e. Cilicia), dating to the eighth century BC, reference is made to the relationship between his kingdom and his Assyrian overlords. The Luwian inscription reads whereas the Phoenician translation reads , i.e. , which according to Rollinger (2006) \"settles the problem once and for all\". According to a different hypothesis, the name Syria might be derived from \"Sirion\" ( \u0160iry\u00f4n, meaning \"breastplate\"), the name that the Phoenicians (especially Sidonians) gave to Mount Hermon, firstly mentioned in an Ugaritic poem about Baal and Anath: ==History== The Greek name appears to correspond to Phoenician \"Assur\", \"Assyrians\", recorded in the 8th-century BC \u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription.Rollinger, Robert (2006). \"The terms \"Assyria\" and \"Syria\" again\" (PDF). Journal of Near Eastern Studies 65 (4): 284\u2013287. doi:10.1086/511103. Writing in the 5th century BC, Herodotus stated that those called Syrians by the Greeks were called Assyrians by themselves and in the East.(Pipes 1992), s:History of Herodotus/Book 7 In Greek usage, Syria and Assyria were used almost interchangeably in reference to Assyria, although Herodotus distinguished between the names Syria and Assyria, and for him, Syrians are the inhabitants of the Levant. Randolph Helm emphasised that Herodotus never applied the term Syria on the Mesopotamian region of Assyria which he always called \"Assyria\". In the Roman Empire, Syria and Assyria came to be used as distinct geographical terms. \"Syria\" in the Roman Empire period referred to those parts of the Empire situated between Asia Minor and Egypt, i.e. the western Levant, while \"Assyria\" in northern Iraq, southeast Turkey and northeast Syria was part of the Persian Empire as Athura, and only very briefly came under Roman control (116\u2013118 AD, marking the historical peak of Roman expansion), where it was known as Assyria Provincia. In 1864, the Ottoman Vilayet Law was promulgated to form the Syria Vilayet.The Arabs of the Ottoman Empire, 1516\u20131918: A Social and Cultural History, pp. 177, 181-182. Bruce Masters, Cambridge University Press, 2013. The new provincial law was implemented in Damascus in 1865, and the reformed province was named Suriyya/Suriye, reflecting a growing historical consciousness among the local intellectuals. ==See also== *Names of the Levant *Syria (region) *Greater Syria *Names of Syriac Christians *\u00c7inek\u00f6y inscription *Name of India ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * Assyrians, Syrians and the Greek Language in the late Hellenistic and Roman Imperial Periods, Nathanael Andrade, Journal of Near Eastern Studies, Vol. 73, No. 2, October 2014, DOI: 10.1086/677249, https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/677249 * * Syria Category:History of Syria ",
