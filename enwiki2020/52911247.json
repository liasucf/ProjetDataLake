After spells at AS Cetef de Bonab\u00e9ri and Les Astres FC, he agreed to a contract with Paris Saint-Germain on 10 September 2009. After only appearing for PSG's B-team in Championnat de France amateur, Owona moved to Spain and joined Real Oviedo Vetusta on 31 January 2011. Although he did not play with the side due to bureaucratic problems, he was still promoted to the first team in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B on 28 May. After leaving Oviedo, Owona continued to appear in the third level but also in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n in the following years, representing SD Noja, Arroyo CP, CF Villanovense (two stints) and Caudal Deportivo. In 2015, while representing Villanovense, he suffered racial abuse from the supporters of Real Betis B. On 17 January 2017, Owona signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side AD Alcorc\u00f3n. He made his professional debut the following day, starting in a 0\u20132 Copa del Rey home loss against Deportivo Alav\u00e9s. Owona scored his first professional goal on 19 February 2017, netting the first in a 1\u20131 home draw against Real Zaragoza. On 22 July he terminated his contract, and signed a three-year deal with fellow second-tier club UD Almer\u00eda just hours later. On 22 January 2020, after suffering a serious injury, Owona cut ties with the Rojiblancos. On 23 September, after nine months without a club, he signed for Extremadura UD in the third tier. ==International career== After representing Cameroon at under-20 level, Owona was included in Hugo Broos's final 23-man squad for the 2017 FIFA Confederations Cup. After failing to appear during the whole tournament, Owona made his full international debut on 13 June 2017, starting in a 0\u20134 friendly loss against Colombia. ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Douala Category:Cameroonian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Les Astres players Category:Paris Saint-Germain F.C. players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Real Oviedo Vetusta players Category:Real Oviedo players Category:CF Villanovense players Category:Caudal Deportivo footballers Category:AD Alcorc\u00f3n footballers Category:UD Almer\u00eda players Category:Extremadura UD footballers Category:Cameroon youth international footballers Category:Cameroon international footballers Category:Cameroonian expatriate footballers Category:Cameroonian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:2017 FIFA Confederations Cup players ",
