SwimSwam launched as a website in March 2012 and quickly became the most-read swimming website in the world. SwimSwam was named one of NBC Sports's 100 must-follow social media handles for the 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2016, SwimSwam launched a quarterly print magazine called SwimSwam magazine, which was included in Mr. Magazine's \"30 Hottest New Launches of the Year.\" The news organization was founded by Braden Keith, Garrett McCaffrey, Davis Wuolle, Tiffany Stewart and Olympic gold medalist Melvin Stewart, widely known as Gold Medal Mel. The site also compiles a listing of swim-related jobs and ranks NCAA recruits and recruiting classes among other things. == Awards == SwimSwam is known for its yearly Swammy Awards, which honor the top international, NCAA and age group swimmers at the end of each year. ==Notable stories== SwimSwam made international headlines when it published statistical data suggesting the pool used for the 2016 Summer Olympics was affected by currents that unfairly advantaged some lanes over others. The original SwimSwam report was picked up and reported on by The Washington Post, Deadspin, Australia's News.com.au and Inside Science. The organization's website was also the outlet in which G Ryan, a national champion swimmer, came out as transgender in 2016. SwimSwam's Olympic coverage has also been referenced by The Washington Post, Slate (magazine) and Bleacher Report and its coverage has also been referenced by Sports Illustrated ==References== Category:American sport websites Category:Swimming websites Category:Water polo websites ",
