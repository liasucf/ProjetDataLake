She is best known for her webcomics, which she posts regularly to her website, The Little World of Liz, and her Rory the Dinosaur children's book series. She has also been animating on the television series The Simpsons since 2003. == Biography == Climo was born and raised in Silicon Valley, where she attended San Jose State University (SJSU). At SJSU, Climo applied for the university's animation program, but was not accepted. Despite this setback, and before graduating from SJSU, Climo was hired as an animator on The Simpsons and moved to Los Angeles. After working in the industry for a few years, Climo started a blog on Tumblr, where she occasionally posted comics and drawings. The blog eventually gained momentum, which led to her career in publishing. Since then, Climo has worked as a children's book author, has published calendars, and has a successful greeting card line featured at Target and Walmart. Climo currently lives in Los Angeles with her husband and daughter. == Works == *Rory the Dinosaur: Me and My Dad *Rory the Dinosaur Wants a Pet *Rory the Dinosaur Needs a Christmas Tree * Forthcoming Rory the Dinosaur title *The Little World of Liz Climo *Lobster is the Best Medicine *You Don't Want A Unicorn! *Will Somebody Please Scratch My Back? *You're Mom: A Little Book for Mothers (and the People Who Love Them) == Filmography == === Film === {| class=\"wikitable\" !

School Library Journal praises Climo's \"simple yet clear, colorful, and expressive\" illustrations, while Kirkus Reviews lauds her \"lighthearted approach\" and describes the title as \"an appealing read-aloud\" with an \"innocent silliness.\" == References == == External links == * The Little World of Liz * Liz Climo on Tumblr * * Lambiek Comiclopedia article.
