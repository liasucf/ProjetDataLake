    "text": "The 1926\u201327 season was the 50th Scottish football season in which Dumbarton competed at national level, entering the Scottish Football League and the Scottish Cup. In addition Dumbarton played in the Dumbartonshire Cup. ==Scottish League== Dumbarton's fifth successive season in the Second Division saw a further decline in performances, and with 5 defeats coming in their first 7 games it was clear that the team would struggle. In the end a miserable 18th place out of 20 was achieved with 32 points - a distant 34 behind champions Bo'ness. Indeed going into the last league game, Dumbarton were lying in 19th place and favourites to go through the election process for relegation to the Third Division, but an unbelievable 5-0 away win at Ayr would save their Second Division status. ==Scottish Cup== Dumbarton reached the second round before losing out to Alloa after a replay. ==Dumbartonshire Cup== Dumbarton were again runners-up in the Dumbartonshire Cup. A fortunate 'toss of the coin' win over Clydebank in the replayed semifinal was followed by a heavy defeat to non-league Helesburgh in the final. ==Player statistics== ===Squad=== |} Source: ===Transfers=== ==== Players in ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%;width:98%; text- align:left\" |- !Player !From !Date |- | Martin Davin | Vale of Clyde | 31 May 1926 |- | Robert Main | St Bernard's | 9 Jun 1926 |- | James Reid | Vale of Leven | 28 Jul 1926 |- | John Granger | Vale of Leven | 29 Jul 1926 |- | John Cameron | Johnstone | 9 Aug 1926 |- | David Yuill | St Mirren | 19 Aug 1926 |- | George Greenshields | Motherwell | 9 Sep 1926 |- | David Kyle | Airdrie | 9 Sep 1926 |- | Archibald Muir | Bathgate | 21 Oct 1926 |- | Hugh Reid | Stenhousemuir | 10 Feb 1927 |- | John Black | Gartsherrie Athletic | |} ==== Players out ==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:95%;width:98%; text-align:left\" |- !Player !To !Date |- | Archibald McLardie | Johnstone | 20 Jul 1926 |- | William Gibson | emigrated | 11 Aug 1926 |- | Harry Britton | Arbroath | 23 Sep 1926 |- | David Broadley | Arbroath | 23 Sep 1926 |- | Philip Kennedy | Bathgate | 6 Oct 1926 |- | David Kyle | Bathgate | 30 Nov 1926 |- | John Anderson | Armadale | 23 Dec 1926 |- | John McGrath | St Bernard's | 21 Jan 1927 |- | Robert Hosie | Fall River Marksmen | |- | Joseph McDonald | Cowdenbeath | |} In addition Francis Carlow, Albert Ferguson, William McDonald, Thomas McKinney, Archibald McNish and Martin Travers all played their last games in Dumbarton 'colours'.
