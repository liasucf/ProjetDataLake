At the beginning of his career, Bulgakov worked in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He served as an official with special duties attached to the Governor General of Moscow in 1809\u20131832. In 1832, Bulgakov stopped his diplomatic career and was appointed to Director of Posts in Moscow. He served in this position in 1832\u20131856. His younger brother Konstantin Bulgakov (1782\u20131835) was the Director of the Saint Petersburg Post Office at that time. Because both were the top officers of the Russian Postal Service, they could freely correspond with each other. Both brothers were much respected by their staff for their effort to improve working conditions for postal workers. == See also == * Feodor Pryanishnikov * Konstantin Bulgakov * Postage stamps and postal history of Russia * Yakov Bulgakov == References == == External links == * Category:1781 births Category:1863 deaths Category:Russian nobility Category:Imperial Russian diplomats Category:Senators of the Russian Empire Category:Russian postmasters ",
