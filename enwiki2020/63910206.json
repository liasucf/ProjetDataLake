He is among the faculty of Ducere Business School in Prahran, Victoria and is a visiting professor at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia. He is also the director of the Imagineering Institute in Malaysia, the Mixed Reality Lab in Singapore and the CEO of Nikola Tesla Technologies Corporation in Malaysia. Cheok has sparked controversy for his conservative politics. == Education == Cheok obtained a Bachelor of Engineering (Electrical and Electronic) with First Class Honors in 1992, and PhD in Engineering in 1998 from the University of Adelaide. == Career == === Academic === In 2004, Cheok developed Human Pacman, an early augmented reality game. In 2005, he created the Poultry Internet project which used a customised haptic jacket to allow him to remotely hug a chicken. In 2015, Cheok and his students created Scentee, a device which allowed individuals to transmit fragrances via smartphones with the installed device and aroma cartridges. He has also performed research on taste simulation. In 2016, Cheok and student Emma Yang Zhang co-created Kissenger, a device which allows people to remotely transmit the physical sensation of kissing. Cheok is a professor at iUniversity in Tokyo, Japan. He is also among the faculty of Ducere Business School in Prahran, Victoria, and is a visiting professor at the University of Novi Sad in Serbia, at the Mihailo Pupin technical faculty. Cheok's research, in recent years, has focused on human sexual interaction with robots. Cheok has been criticised by colleagues for equating human-robot marriage with inter-racial and same-sex marriage, and concerns were raised over his professional conduct, specifically the ethical and consent issues of demonstrating cybersexual inventions with young female students. In 2019 Cheok announced plans to set up an institution called the Nikola Tesla Graduate School, with right-wing Australian politician Fraser Anning as honorary chairman and president. At the time, the school was asking for donations but did not yet have any physical address and was not registered with the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency. ===Conferences=== Cheok is a General Co-Chair of David Levy's Love and Sex with Robots conference. The conference presented papers which explored the ethics and practical considerations surrounding sexuality and the field of robotics, specifically sex robots. Its 2015 conference in Malaysia was cancelled by police who declared it illegal and inappropriate for the country's culture, and in 2016 the conference was hosted by Goldsmiths, University of London. in 2017 Cheok provided a keynote speech for the Foundation of Digital Games conference. After the conference the organisers issued a formal statement censuring Cheok for his behaviour after he personally attacked an academic on Twitter when she criticised aspects of his presentation.Matsakis, Louise. (31 October 2018). \"The Weird Saga of the Gaming Conference Hosting Steve Bannon\", Wired. Retrieved 25 June 2020. Cheok served as chairman of the academic conference Advances in Computer Entertainment, and contributed to its demise in 2018 when members of the conferences's committee objected to Cheok appointing David Levy, who has been criticised for his views on the use of child sex robots, to the conference's steering committee without consultation, and adding a \"Love and Sex with Robots\" strand to the conference. Cheok responded by inviting Steve Bannon to give that year's keynote speech, prompting widespread international criticism from universities. Springer cancelled their involvement due to a low number of papers and concerns over irregularities in the paper submission and reviewing process.Matsakis, Louise. (31 October 2018). \"The Weird Saga of the Gaming Conference Hosting Steve Bannon\", Wired. Retrieved 25 June 2020. \"The number of submissions to ACE 2018 compared to previous years is extremely low and remains well behind expectations ... [m]oreover, the decision to withdraw has been made following a number of irregularities reported to us regarding the paper reviewing and selection process and regarding the organization of the ACE 2018 conference.\" When many delegates declined to attend, Cheok cancelled the conference, criticising academia as \"a bunch of weak willies\". == Politics == Cheok is a supporter of Australian politician Fraser Anning, sharing his strong anti-immigration stance. At the 2019 Australian federal election, Cheok ran as a candidate for Anning's Conservative National Party in the Adelaide division of Boothby, receiving 0.79% of the vote.Boothby, SA, Tally Room 2019, Australian Electoral Commission. Cheok has been criticised for Islamophobic Facebook posts, and his use of Twitter has been unfavourably compared to Donald Trump tweets by critics. Cheok was a member of Clive Palmer's United Australia Party, but stood down from the right-wing party after being asked by Palmer to \"dumb down\" his policies.Gailberger, Jade. (3 May 2019). \"The bricklayer, the professor and the revived Democrat\", The Advertiser. p10. ==Awards and honours== In 2003 Cheok received a Young Scientist Award from the Singapore National Academy of Science. He is a member of the World Technology Network, and was a Young Global Leader for the World Economic Forum. He is a Fellow, Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. In 2016, he was awarded the Distinguished Alumni Awards by University of Adelaide, in recognition of his achievements and contribution in the field of Computing, Engineering and Multisensory communication.

Cheok has an h-index of 47, meaning that 47 of his papers have been cited at least 47 times: this is the among the highest 0.05% of h-indices in computer science. In the 2019 Queen's Birthday Honours, he was made a Member (AM) of the Order of Australia for his work in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence. This resulted in a formal request by the Australian chapter of the Digital Games Research Association to the Governor-General of Australia, for it to be withdrawn.\"Governor-General to face formal request to cancel Adrian Cheok's Queen's Birthday honour\" (28 June 2019).
