    "text": "The Symphony No. 2 of Douglas Lilburn was completed in 1951, and received its premiere in 1959. It appears to have been revised in 1974.See: The work is divided into four movements: *Prelude: Moderato (half note=betw. 52-56 (tempo in beats per minute)) *Scherzo: Allegro vivace (quarter note=approx. 152) *Introduction: Poco lento (quarter note=approx. 69) - without pause - *Finale: Allegro (half note=betw. 116-120)metronome markings are from the 1979 score. A typical performance of the piece lasts around 30 minutes, and several recordings exist. The work was published in 1979 by Price Milburn of WellingtonSee: (e.g. University of Missouri Kansas City, other locations. Typeset miniature score, 116 pages.) though it seems to have circulated in manuscript copies earlier.This makes sense as there were several earlier recordings. A holograph of the 1974 revision is at Victoria University of Wellington (see OCLC link), for instance. (According to library and Worldcat, holograph score- 136 pages.) ==References== *Douglas Lilburn. The Three Symphonies.
