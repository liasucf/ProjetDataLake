He is best known for the development of what the media termed \"The Silence Machine\" which was covered in some press,Rowe, Mark. \"Peace and quiet ... at the press of a button.\", The Guardian, London, UK.

Retrieved on 9 January 2008. ==Scientific contributions== Responsible for publishing over one hundred archived scientific journal documents and awarded six technology patents, Selwyn Wright was primarily a wave theorist who provided solutions to problems related to power systems, produced in-depth research focusing on sound and vibration technology, and helped advance the development of noise cancellation systems. He most recently re-adapted his classical acoustic wave theories, framing them in a series of publicationsWright, Selwyn. \"Electromagnetic Sources and Observers in Motion I.\", Progress In Electromagnetics Research, Xi'an, China.
