The French motto \"Nous Soutiendrons\" means \"We Shall Serve\" the crest of the 53rd Coast Artillery is the symbol of the Railway Artillery Reserve The Oozlefinch (unofficial) coat of arms from a 1957 military ceremony pamphlet. The Latin motto \"Quid ad sceleratorum curamus\" translates roughly as \"What the hell do we care?\" The Oozlefinch is the unofficial historic mascot of the Air Defense Artillery - and formerly of the U.S. Army Coast Artillery Corps. The Oozlefinch is portrayed as a featherless bird that flies backwards (at supersonic speeds) and carries weapons of the Air Defense and Coast Artillery, most often a Nike- Hercules Missile. Oozlefinch has been portrayed in many different forms and artistic interpretations through its history. == History == There are many legends about the origins of the Oozlefinch. Most agree that the legend began in 1905 at Ft. Monroe, Virginia, then home of the Coast Artillery Corps. A Captain H. M. Merriam, no doubt under the effects of alcohol, first reported seeing a large-eyed, flight-challenged bird outside the officers' club. Soon more people would report seeing this bird, and even sketches were made. Eventually, the legend of this bird would become so great that even a statue was erected at the club in its honor. The Oozlefinch was used on the patch of the Railway Artillery Reserve during World War I; In some descriptions, this bird is instead a pelican. The DUI of the 42nd Field Artillery Brigade later included the oozlefinch, describing the insignia thus: \"On a wreath of the colors (Or and Gules) an oozlefinch (from the shoulder sleeve insignia worn by the Railway Artillery Reserve in France) Vert, armed, capped and collared on the legs.\" == Symbolism == The Oozlefinch's eyes are very large, allowing it to see very distant and very clearly in the sky. Its vision is unobstructed by eyelids or eyebrows, and the eyes are said to be able to turn 180 degrees so the Oozlefinch can look inward, symbolizing the need of a good leader for inward reflection. === Heraldry === The heraldic tradition of the Oozlefinch includes a coat of arms, the symbology of which is: Matched Pair of Oozlefinches ca. 1951 by COL John R.
