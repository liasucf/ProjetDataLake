    "text": "The 1993 Invercargill mayoral by-election was held on 20 March 1993 as a result of the death of Mayor Eve Poole on Boxing Day the previous year. ==Background== Since losing the Waitemata City mayoralty in 1989, Tim Shadbolt had made several unsuccessful electoral runs, including 1992 mayoral elections in Auckland and Dunedin, in both of which he placed third. The election attracted an unusually large pool of 14 candidates, including the incumbent deputy mayor and the two deputy mayors preceding him. Former Southland County Council chairman and father of candidate Janet Malloch, Sir Erskine Bowmar, described it as \"a bit of a joke\". ==Results== The following table gives the election results: ==References== Category:1993 elections in New Zealand Category:Mayoral elections in Invercargill Category:March 1993 events in Oceania ",
