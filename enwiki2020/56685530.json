He studied business, as well as sociology and psychology, and finished with a master's degree. Except for some small anecdotal food work, he will fully enter the workforce directly as a professional artist. It was at the age of 11, in 1986, that Norbert Ferr\u00e9 attended the magician Christian Preston's show at La Ciotat: it was love at first sight for this art. The gift of a traditional box of magic for children, reading all the magic books he can find, will strengthen his passion. At the age of 14, he was accepted at the Magicians Club of Marseille, affiliated to the F.F.A.P. F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Fran\u00e7aise des Artistes Prestidigitateurs: the national French federation of conjuring artists), a club of which he will become a few years later the president from 1998 to 2001.

He began, in 1989, to mount an act he decided to present in 1991, at the first magic contest Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin de Blois (he still performs under the stage name Maginor), he there wins a second prize that will encourage him. He will receive, on this occasion, the advice of Pierre Brahma, the only French at the time who won the Grand Prix at the FISM (sort of the Olympic Games of conjuring held every three years).Pierre Brahma, also from Marseille, was a Grand Prix FISM in 1964 and 1976 (one of the few to have won twice). Norbert Ferr\u00e9 continues to work on his act and presents it this time in the national contest of the AFAP (formerly name of the FFAP) in Perpignan in 1999. He wins the third prize of manipulation. He submitted his act to the 26th Convention of the Royal Club of Magicians of Brussels in Belgium (Circle 86 of the International Brotherhood of Magicians, commonly called I.B.M.), he won the second place in the category of Manipulation.

On a stage with minimal decoration (a pedestal table with a box marked \"Surprise,\" a sign on which we read \"Prediction\"). Norbert Ferr\u00e9 will play two characters: the host, debonair, funny and clumsy, and the magician, very serious and skillful. The act begins with the host, whose task is to make the time pass pleasantly while waiting for the arrival of the great magician. This will be the occasion of some jokes, and a few taps, the host being very proud of his new shoes and holding to draw attention to them. After a tour of himself of the artist, the \"great magician\" is revealed: the act is no longer spoken, we hear, in the background, an excerpt from the musical \"A Fiddler on the roof\",This is the 4th song of Act I: To life. and then begins a series of manipulations, flourishes, magical effects and great dexterity with balls and cards, for a few minutes.In this part of frills with balls and mysterious re- appearances of holsters around the deck of cards, Norbert Rail has created new techniques in the magic art. The routine ends, the artist does again a turn on himself, and the first character, the debonair, makes his appearance again. This one goes to look for the sign prediction and returns it: what is marked surprises the spectators, who understands to have been handled. After some new jokes, the \"great magician\" is once again appearing for a new demonstration of dexterity. After this, one last time, we find the good-natured character, who will reveal the contents of the box with marked \"surprise\": again, the public will be surprised by what the box contains, and that is, in fact, an ultimate Magic trick. The act ends with some last touches of humour... The act combines magical effects and exploits on frills to acting, a theatralization, following a precept known illusionists statement by Jean Eug\u00e8ne Robert-Houdin: \u00ab The magician is a comedian who plays the role of a magician \u00bb. == Additional activities == Norbert Ferr\u00e9 occasionally writes articles for magician's magazines, such as The FFAP's magazine of conjuring.For example, the editorial of La Revue de la Prestidigitation No. 537 of September\u2013October 2003 page 2, or the article A helping hand?, Idem, No. 509 January\u2013February 199 page 31, or the article Minor art magic or major art?, Published in the German magazine Magische Welt of December 2017 under the title: Zauberei: Kleine oder gro\u00dfe kunst?, p.242 to 247.
