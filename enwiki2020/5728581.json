A remake of the game, X-Change 2 R was later produced by Crowd, but Peach Princess has stated they do not intend to market this game. == Synopsis == In X-Change 2, the player plays as Takuya Aihara, a student at Miyanomori Chemistry School who is afraid about changing into \"a new, partially familiar self\". When a strange chemical turns her thoughts into Maiko's last year, the player has a bizarre string of experiences and has her thoughts in his or her brain. One year later, Takuya is enjoying her school life with Asuka, her best friend. A chemistry club member Chisato uses Takuya for a new experiment, which turns Takuya's thoughts around again. As a girl, Takuya finds she is more popular than before but with practically everyone around her asking to be with her. This dating-sim adventure features a large number of characters as the game goes on. The shy boy Kouji, whose virginity Takuya took last year on the roof of the school, has him waiting for his chance all the time. The teacher Mr. Sano, who is known for his interest in his students, is curious about you. While all this is going on, Takuya tries to keep her relationship with Asuka intact. == Gameplay == As the game unfolds, the player makes various decisions at set in the game. These choices lead to different interactions with the multiple characters throughout the game. Throughout the game the character is worried and has unusual moments with many different people.

The game has multiple endings, some with Takuya returning to his real self and remaining with Asuka, and others where he chooses another person to make friends with instead or even no one at all.
