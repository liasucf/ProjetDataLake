    "text": "P\u014dmare I (?\u20131826), also called Whetoi, was a M\u0101ori rangatira (chief) of the Ng\u0101puhi iwi (tribe) in New Zealand. He was a leader of the Ng\u0101ti Manu hap\u016b (subtribe) of the Ng\u0101puhi. Whetoi adopted the name of P\u014dmare, which was the name of the first king of Tahiti and founder of the P\u014dmare dynasty. After his death he was called Pomarenui (P\u014dmare the Great) by the Ngati Manu in order to distinguish him from his nephew Whiria. The Ng\u0101ti Manu originally lived at Tautoro, south of Kaikohe, however disputes with the Ng\u0101ti Toki (Ng\u0101ti Wai) in P\u014dmare\u2019s lifetime forced them to move and settle at Koror\u0101reka, Matauwhi, Otuihu, Waikare and Te Karetu on the southern shore of the Bay of Islands. P\u014dmare I established a p\u0101 at Matauwhi, near to Kororareka, in what is now called Pomare Bay. Following the death of P\u014dmare I in 1826, his nephew Whiria adopted his uncle\u2019s names, Whetoi and P\u014dmare, so that Whiria is referred to as P\u014dmare II, so as to distinguish him from his uncle. ==Relations with the Church Missionary Society (CMS)== The Church Missionary Society (CMS) arrived in the Bay of Islands in 1814. P\u014dmare supplied food and timber to the missionaries. He traded timber for tools and he also traded timber for muskets to provided security against the northern hap\u016b within the Ng\u0101puhi, which was led by Hongi Hika, Tareha, Ruatara, and Rewa (Manu) a chief of the Ng\u0101ti Tawake hap\u016b of Kerikeri. At this time there was fighting between the hap\u016b of the Ng\u0101puhi as well as intertribal fighting (known as the Musket Wars). The Rev. Henry Williams was appointed the leader of the CMS mission in 1823. He stopped the CMS trading muskets with the Ng\u0101puhi. However other Europeans continued to trade muskets with the Ng\u0101puhi and other M\u0101ori tribes. The missionaries regarded P\u014dmare as one of the important leaders in the Bay of Islands, together with Hongi Hika, Te Whareumu and Rakau. In July 1815 P\u014dmare went to visit Port Jackson (Sydney) in the missionary vessel Active. ==P\u014dmare I as a war leader== P\u014dmare I led a number of war parties against other M\u0101ori tribes: *In 1820 he engaged in a six-month siege of Te Whetu-matarau p\u0101 at Te Kawakawa (Te Araroa) in the East Cape region of the North Island; *In 1821 he joined Hongi Hika in the attack on the Ng\u0101ti P\u0101oa at the Mau-inaina p\u0101 at Mokoia (Panmure) between the Waitemat\u0101 and Manukau Harbours; then the Ng\u0101puhi attached the Ng\u0101ti Maru of Te Totara p\u0101, in the Thames area; *In 1822 he led an attack on the Nga-uhi-a-po p\u0101 on Tuhua (Mayor Island), and then pursued the Ng\u0101ti Awa of the eastern Bay of Plenty, up the Whakatane River valley and into Te Urewera, the land of the Ng\u0101i T\u016bhoe; *In 1823 he joined Hongi Hika in the attack on against the Te Arawa on Mokoia Island in Lake Rotorua. A dispute arose between P\u014dmare I and Hongi Hika over the conduct of the attack; *In 1824 he attacked the Ng\u0101ti Wh\u0101tua of the Kaipara. Later that year he joined Te Maitaranui of Te Urewera and attacked Wairoa and took the Titirangi p\u0101 near Lake Waikaremoana; *In 1826 P\u014dmare I was killed during a raid in the Waikato. ==Legacy== The death of Tiki, the son of P\u014dmare I, and the subsequent death of Te Whareumu in 1828 threw the Hokianga into a state of uncertainty as the Ng\u0101puhi chiefs debated whether revenge was necessary following the death of a chief. The Rev. Henry Williams, Richard Davis and the chief Tohitapu mediated between the combatants. As the chiefs did not want to escalate the fighting, a peaceful resolution was achieved. P\u014dmare I was succeeded as leader of the Ng\u0101ti Manu hap\u016b by his nephew, Whiria, who took his uncle\u2019s names, Whetoi and P\u014dmare. == Footnotes == Category:1826 deaths Category:People from the Northland Region Category:Musket Wars Category:M\u0101ori Category:Ng\u0101puhi ",
