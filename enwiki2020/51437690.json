    "text": "Lyse Lafontaine (born 1942) is a Canadian film producer known for working with directors Jean-Claude Lauzon and Xavier Dolan. She works at Lyla Films in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. ==Early life== Born to La Presse reporter Gaston Lafontaine, Lyse studied literature at the Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al and earned her degree. She married St\u00e9phane Venne and managed the rock band Offenbach in 1972. She became a stage manager on the 1974 film The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz, and married her second husband, moving to The Bahamas for two years before returning to Canada. ==Career== In 1976, Lafontaine served as location manager for the film The Little Girl Who Lives Down the Lane, starring Jodie Foster. Lafontaine met Lauzon when he was pitching his screenplay for L\u00e9olo (1992), which other producers had rejected. It became the first film she produced, with Aim\u00e9e Danis, for which they were nominated for the Genie Award for Best Motion Picture. While in Italy during filming, Lauzon gave Lafontaine a letter thanking her for her ineptitude in business, which he considered necessary to make a film with feeling. She kept it as a cherished keepsake. Working with Dolan, she produced Laurence Anyways (2012) and served as an associate producer for Mommy (2014). Dolan's Laurence Anyways was inspired by Lafontaine's ex-boyfriend Luc Baillairg\u00e9, the father of her son Mika\u00ebl, who had a small part in L\u00e9olo. With Dolan, she personally traveled to London in 2017 to work on his The Death and Life of John F. Donovan. In 2015, Lafontaine produced La Passion d\u2019Augustine with Fran\u00e7ois Tremblay, winning the Qu\u00e9bec Cin\u00e9ma Award for Best Film. On 1 June 2017 at the 19th Quebec Cinema Awards, she was awarded the Iris Hommage for 30 years of contributions to Quebec cinema. ==Filmography== Her films include: * The Decline of the American Empire (1986) * Jesus of Montreal (1989) * L\u00e9olo (1992) * A Sunday in Kigali (2006) * Mommy Is at the Hairdresser's (2009) * Barney's Version (2010) * Laurence Anyways (2012) * Mommy (2014) * The Passion of Augustine (2015) * Un sac de billes (2017) * Worst Case, We Get Married (2017) * The Death and Life of John F.
