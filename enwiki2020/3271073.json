Due to ideological disputes, he was removed from his teaching positions in Hungary in 1973, and fled in 1977 to Australia, where from 1978 he taught at the University of Sydney. Following political liberalisation in Hungary, Markus was reassimilated and taught regularly in his homeland, although he remained resident in Sydney. He was external member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences (1990). He was also on the editorial board of the academic journal Thesis Eleven: Critical Theory and Historical Sociology. He was married to eminent Polish sociologist Dr. Maria M\u00e1rkus, a lecturer at the University of New South Wales. They have two sons, Gy\u00f6rgy and Andr\u00e1s. ==Selected publications== * Marxizmus \u00e9s \u201eantropol\u00f3gia\u201d.
