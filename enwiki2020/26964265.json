    "text": "The Plastics 2020 Challenge is a campaign to reduce the quantity of plastic materials sent to landfill. In 2009, the plastics industry, PlasticsEurope, the Packaging and Films Association (PAFA) and the British Plastics Federation (BPF), launched its Plastics 2020 Challenge campaign in the UK to challenge itself, consumers and government to step up resource efficiency and stop sending plastic materials to landfill. The Plastics 2020 Challenge was named runner-up \"Campaign of the Year\" for 2009 by Packaging News. ==Pledges== The industry is pledging several commitments including to help double the recycling rate of plastic packaging in the UK by the year 2020 and the diversion of plastics from landfill. ==Plastic recycling== Plastics are too valuable a resource to send to landfill at their end of life. Industry wants these materials back to recycle whenever possible. When plastics cannot be sustainably recycled such non-recyclable plastics provides a valuable energy resource for advanced thermal process, contributing to energy security and displacing virgin fossils fuels. ==Call for action== The plastics industry cannot achieve this alone, and calls on policy makers and the value chain to work with them in achieving its goal, thereby increasing the UK's resource efficiency and creating new jobs in the Green sector. ==Sponsors== The Plastics 2020 Challenge is sponsored by three organisations: * PlasticsEurope * British Plastics Federation (BPF) * Packaging and Films Association (PAFA) ==See also== * Plastic recycling * Reuse of water bottles * Waste Implementation Programme * Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs ==References== ==External links== * Category:2009 in the environment Category:Recycling in the United Kingdom Category:Plastic recycling ",
