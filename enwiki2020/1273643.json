    "text": "Ryan Daniel Montgomery (born July 5, 1977), known professionally as Royce da 5'9\", is an American rapper and songwriter. He is best known for his longtime association with Eminem as well as his solo career, recording primarily with producers Carlos \"6 July\" Broady and DJ Premier, as well as ghostwriting for the likes of Diddy and Dr. Dre. Royce is currently one half of the rap duo Bad Meets Evil with Eminem and one half of the hip hop duo PRhyme with DJ Premier. He was also one quarter of the hip hop group Slaughterhouse with Joe Budden, Joell Ortiz and Kxng Crooked. The editors of About.com ranked him No. 31 on their list of the \"Top 50 MCs of Our Time (1987\u20132007)\". ==Early life== In an interview with DJ Vlad on YouTube, Royce stated that his only early stage name prior to the \"Royce\" nickname was R-Dog, which \"didn't even last a year\". He moved to Oak Park, Michigan when he was 10 years old, later acquiring the nickname \"Royce\" during high school after wearing a British link chain with an R pendant resembling the Rolls Royce symbol. Royce's name comes from his height, 5 feet 9 inches (175 cm). However, the numbers five and nine have been in his life numerous times as he \"found his calling\" as a rapper in 1995 and in his song \"Tabernacle\" he discusses his grandmother dying on the fifth floor of a hospital and his first son being born on the ninth. Similar instances suggest that his name has numerous meanings besides his height. He started rapping at age 18, influenced mainly by Ras Kass, Redman, Tupac Shakur, The Notorious B.I.G., Esham, Detroit's Most Wanted, and N.W.A.\"Royce Da 5'9\" Interview\", Hip Hop Galaxy, 22 July 2005 .

After Tommy Boy Records shut down, he signed a deal with Columbia and Game Recordings where he started recording an album called Rock City, referring to Detroit's former status as home to Motown Records. When the project was heavily bootlegged, Royce left the label for Koch to re-record some of the album, eventually releasing it in 2002 as Rock City (Version 2.0). While the album did not sell very well, the DJ Premier-produced single \"Boom\" gained Royce some underground recognition and eventually resulted in the two working together more closely. ==Career== ===1997\u20132001: Early years=== Through his manager Kino Childrey, Royce was introduced to Eminem on December 29, 1997 at a concert, and the two formed a working relationship; they formed up as a duo, Bad Meets Evil, and released several tracks together. On August 20, 1998, Royce and Eminem both appeared on The Stretch Armstrong and Bobbito Show for the first time. Furthermore, Royce appeared on Eminem's major-label debut studio album The Slim Shady LP, in which he was featured on a song called \"Bad Meets Evil\". Royce and Eminem also released a track called \"Renegade\", from which Royce's vocals would later be replaced with Jay-Z's on the latter's The Blueprint. Through Eminem, Royce would also be introduced to both Dr. Dre and execs at Game Recordings.

The first, \"Shit on You\", was recorded over the instrumental of D12's track of the same name and mainly attacked group member Bizarre. Following Royce's second track, \"Malcolm X\", D12 responded with \"Smack Down\", over the instrumental of 50 Cent's \"Back Down\". Proof himself released the tracks \"Many Men\", over the instrumental of 50 Cent's \"Many Men (Wish Death)\"; and \"Beef Is Ova\", with rap group The Purple Gang. Royce responded with his third track, \"Death Day\", recorded over 50 Cent's \"In Da Club\".

Proof and Royce were arrested and jailed overnight in adjacent cells, where they talked out their differences and ended the feud.Royce Da 5'9\" Youtube Interview. Retrieved 2014-15-04.

In 2001, Royce was featured on pop singer Willa Ford's song \"I Wanna Be Bad\". In 2004, he released his second and most critically successful album to date, Death Is Certain, charting with another Premier-produced single, \"Hip-Hop\". After the relative success of his second effort, Royce put out a third solo project, Independent's Day, in 2005. This was met with less acclaim than either of his previous releases. During this time, the rivalry between Royce and former friend Proof reached a boiling point in the streets of Detroit, on an occasion where the two rappers drew guns; they were subsequently arrested and left to work out their differences while spending the night in neighboring cells in jail.
