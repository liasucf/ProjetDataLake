After stints hosting Electric Circus and Gonna Meet A Rockstar, among other shows, he left MuchMusic on October 30, 2003 to pursue other ambitions. In 2004, he applied to join VH1, and became a co-host of the channel's Top 20 countdown, alongside another former Muchmusic VJ, Rachel Perry. He also co- hosted with Aamer Haleem. He also hosted Nick at Nite's \"Bet The House\". ==Notes== * He is known to have a deep and booming voice and his height is over 6'2. * He was raised in Winnipeg, Manitoba, getting his start in radio at CKUW-FM, the radio station at the University of Winnipeg. * He is quoted as saying \"MuchMusic will always be a unique and pivotal point in my professional career. The artists I've seen perform, the people I've met, the places I've been and the afternoons I've spent saying video names and waxing frivolous and philosophic with whoever happened to be watching. Maybe tomorrow I'm going to settle down; until tomorrow the whole world is my home. Thanks for joining me, my little video channel friends.\"Bradford How - TV.com Screenvision - The worldwide leader in cinema advertising * In November 2006, Bradford spent several weeks in Biloxi, MS doing Hurricane Katrina relief work with Urban Life Missions Relief and an AmeriCorps*NCCC team, helping with various construction projects. ==References== Category:People from Winnipeg Category:1977 births Category:Much (TV channel) personalities Category:Living people Category:Canadian VJs (media personalities) ",
