Her recordings were archived by the Hamburger Archiv f\u00fcr Gesangskunst in 2011, grouped by the genres opera, spieloper and operetta, concert and oratorio, and lied. *Ruth- Margret P\u00fctz Vol. 1: Oper (3 CDs) *Ruth-Margret P\u00fctz Vol. 2: Spieloper + Operette (2 CDs) *Ruth-Margret P\u00fctz Vol. 3: Konzert + Oratorium (2 CDs) *Ruth- Margret P\u00fctz Vol. 4: Lied (2 CDs) A 2018 CD, Recital, provides an overview of her singing: Gilda's aria, Norina's aria, Frau Fluth's aria, a concert aria by Mozart, K. 416, three excerpts from Die Entf\u00fchrung, and Zerbinetta's aria. All opera arias are sung in German in the custom of the time. A reviewer noted the perfect accuracy and purity of her singing, and her embellishments in repeats which were not customary at the time. Another reviewer wrote about her controlled voice in all registers, rich in overtones and with exquisite legato, in dynamic flexibility and with freely floating top notes. A third reviewer described her \"fluid delivery\", with an \"extraordinary projection of her brilliant high notes\", and noted her intelligible diction in all registers, and her \"ability to communicate a wide range of emotion\", especially a \"tender expressive quality\". == Notes == == References == == Further reading == * Klaus Ulrich Spiegel: Brava, brava, bricconcella!
