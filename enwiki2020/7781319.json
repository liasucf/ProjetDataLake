    "text": "The MacRory Cup is an inter-college (school) Gaelic football tournament in Ulster at senior \"A\" grade. The MacLarnon Cup is the competition for schools at senior 'B' grade. Players must be under nineteen at the start of the tournament. The winners advance to the semi-finals of the Hogan Cup, the All- Ireland colleges \"A\" senior football championship. The competition and trophy are named after Joseph MacRory, then Bishop of Down and Connor, who donated the first cup in 1923. The 2020 final, along with all other Gaelic game activity, between St. Colman's, Newry and St. Patrick's, Maghera was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemichttp://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/games- postponed/. Ulster Colleges announced in June 2020 that they hoped to find a date in October to play the MacRory and McLarnon Cup finals. Ulster Colleges had provisionally scheduled the MacRory final for 9th October 2020. However the decision to cancel the final was made after an emergency Ulster Schools GAA meeting. As a result, the 2019/20 Danske Bank MacRory Cup will be shared between St Patrick's Maghera and St Colman's Newry.http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/announcement-danske-bank- macrory-maclarnon-cup-finals/ The final is held every year on (or close to) St. Patrick's Day and is televised live on BBC Northern Ireland along with the Ulster Rugby Schools Cup final. The venue for the last number of years has been the Athletic Grounds in Armagh. Previous finals have been held in Coalisland and Casement Park. ==History== An inter-seminary football competition between St. Macartan's College, Monaghan and St. Patrick's Grammar School, Armagh had been started in 1902. This was a soccer competition until, in the aftermath of the 1916 Rising, a vote was taken to change over to Gaelic rules and St Patrick's won the first Gaelic encounter in 1918 by 4\u20134 to 0\u20131. Bishop Joseph MacRory, the Bishop of Down and Connor at this time, \u201coffered\u201d to present a Cup for the winners of an Ulster Secondary schools\u2019 competition. The \u201coffer\u201d was not honoured for another five seasons however and in the interim the matches between other seminaries and St Patrick's Armagh are recorded as \u201cchallenges\u201d until the arrival of the first MacRory Cup in late spring 1923. Over the next five seasons the competition was played on a league basis until in 1928 an Ulster Colleges\u2019 Committee was established and the MacRory Cup competition became the new body's main competition. Participation in the MacRory Cup in its early years was confined to those who attended boarding schools. St. Patrick's Armagh were the first winners in 1923, and dominated the competition in its early years. First time victories by other challengers were recorded by St. Macartan's (1930), St. Patrick's College, Cavan (1935), and St. Colman's College, Newry (1949). The 1930s was notable for the affiliation of a number of Christian Brothers\u2019 schools. These were \u2018day schools\u2019 (i.e. non boarding schools) which catered mainly for boys from humble backgrounds, but they did not yet have the prowess to compete with the established diocesan colleges, as was confirmed by comprehensive defeats for Monaghan CBS (1935), and Abbey CBS, Newry (1944 and 1947). 1954 was a watershed year in that the triumph of Abbey CBS after a replay over St Patrick's Cavan was the first MacRory Cup win by a \u2018day school\u2019; the Abbey CBS repeated this feat in 1959 and 1964, but no other day school made the breakthrough until St Mary's CBS in 1971; next came Omagh CBS in 1974. 1976 marks another significant landmark in the history of the competition although that particular Final ended in defeat for St. Patrick's College, Maghera a. It ushered in an extraordinary sequence of 14 Final appearances by St. Patrick's College, Maghera in the following 15 years, 8 of which were won, including 4 consecutive victories 1982\u201385. Those 15 years witnessed a legendary rivalry between St. Patrick's College, Maghera and St. Colman's College, Newry when they faced one another in 10 Finals, including replays. These included the iconic 1989 Final, won by St. Patrick's College, Maghera on the scoreline 4\u201310 to 4\u20139, a game which is widely and rightly regarded as one of the greatest ever played at any level in Ulster. Those were the days when the blanket defence would have been regarded as a distasteful, unchivalrous, and unthinkable option. The 1990s marked the arrival of St. Patrick's Academy, Dungannon and St. Michael's College, Enniskillen at centre stage, and accelerated change in the educational domain with the disappearance of the remaining boarding departments in schools, and an equalisation in standards across a greater range of schools. The new millennium produced a victory in 2000 for the original kingpins, St. Patrick's Armagh, their first victory since 1953, and the next decade was marked by the emergence and appearance of Omagh CBS in 7 Finals. The MacRory Cup, first donated by Bishop MacRory in 1923, is now fiercely contested by 10 schools annually, and a feature of each successive year is the number of genuine contenders and the unpredictability of the outcome. That original trophy was replaced in 1962, and that trophy, in turn, was retired and donated to the O\u2019Fiaich Library in February 2012. A magnificent replacement trophy has been donated to Ulster Colleges by Cardinal Brady, thereby perpetuating the historic link between the Archdiocese of Armagh and this unique competition. The trophy won in March 2012 by St. Michael's, Enniskillen is therefore the 3rd Cup to bear the name of the original visionary, Cardinal MacRory. Fifteen schools have their names on the MacRory Cup with St. Colman's College, Newry winning the first of their record 19 titles in 1949 and St. Patrick's College, Maghera, who are in second place with 15 crowns, won their first in 1977. St. Colman's College, Newry and St. Patrick's College, Maghera also lead the way in terms of Hogan Cup titles won by Ulster schools with eight and five respectively. http://www.danskebankulsterschoolsgaa.com/history/macrory-cup/ https://www.irishnews.com/sport/gaafootball/2019/11/01/news/macrory-cup-the- stats-1748138/ ==Competition format== Current Format The format introduced at the start of the 2017\u201318 season continues. Sixteen teams compete in four groups of four teams. After the group rounds, all matches are knock-out. The four group winners are given byes to the quarter-finals. The four teams who finished third play the four teams who finished fourth in playoff round 1 with the winners playing the four group runners-up in playoff round 2 for the four remaining quarter-final places. 2016-17 Format The format was changed for the 2016\u201317 season. Fourteen teams competed in three groups - Groups A and B had five teams and Group C had four teams. The three group winners and the best group runner-up advanced to the quarter-finals. The fifth-placed teams in groups A and B were eliminated. The remaining eight teams played-off in four matches with the four winners completing the quarter-final line-up. From the quarter-finals onwards all matches were knock-out. Previous Format The competition began with a round-robin tournament consisting of two groups of six teams. The top two teams from each group advanced to the knockout stages. Four playoff matches were held between the bottom four teams of Group A and Group B to complete the quarter final lineup. ==List of titles by college== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !
