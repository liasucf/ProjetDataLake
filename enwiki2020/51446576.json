They also ship cargo from Zamboanga City to Manila with twelve of their container carriers. ==History== The company was founded on October 1, 1976, and its first vessel MV Estrella del Mar transported passengers and cargo, mainly rice, to the neighboring islands. In 1980, the company acquired its first cargo vessel, thus the debut of MV Aleson. The company expanded in the 1980s with more cargo ships, along with voyages to Singapore for trade and commerce purposes. During the 1990s the company concentrated on the passenger and roll-on/roll-off ferry sector. Additional vessels were added to carry more passengers and travel on more routes. In 1994, a new route between Zamboanga Port and Sandakan Port, Malaysia was opened in response to the development of BIMP-EAGA routes. Aleson's MV Danica Joy was one of the first vessels that sailed on this route. In 1999, the company expanded into containerizing cargo, with the addition of new container carriers. The first fast craft of the corporation was bought on 2004 and was named MV Seajet. At present, Aleson operates a fleet of 36 vessels and is the largest shipping operator in Western Mindanao. == Ports of call == Aleson Shipping Lines Inc. main port of call is Zamboanga City, but some of their ships are actively in service for Tubigon, Bohol, Cebu, Manila, Dapitan, Dumaguete, Bongao, Tawi-Tawi, Isabela City, Basilan, Lamitan City, Basilan, and Bongao, Tawi-Tawi == Routes == * Zamboanga City - Isabela, Basilan * Zamboanga City - Lamitan, Basilan * Zamboanga City - Jolo, Sulu * Zamboanga City - Bongao, Tawi-Tawi * Zamboanga City - Sandakan, Malaysia * Dapitan - Dumaguete, Negros Oriental * Cebu City - Tubigon, Bohol * Manila - Bacolod - Zamboanga City* *for cargoes only == Fleet == MV Trisha Kerstin 2 in Zamboanga International Seaport MV Lady Mary Joy 3 in Zamboanga International Seaport Bus shuttle of Aleson Shipping Lines, carrying passengers from terminal to port and vice versa Current (as of March 2017) *MV Antonia (current flagship) *MV Danica Joy 1 *MV Danica Joy 2 * MV Lady Mary Joy 1 *MV Lady Mary Joy 3 *MV Kristel Jane 2 *MV Kristel Jane 3 *MV Kristel Jane 5 *MV Anika Gayle *MV Anika Gayle 2 * MV Stephanie Marie *MV Stephanie Marie 2 *MV Ciara Joie *MV Ciara Joie 2 *MV Ciara Joie 3 * MV Ciara Joie 5 *MV Ciara Joie 7 *MV Trisha Kerstin 1 *MV Trisha Kerstin 2 *MV Trisha Kerstin 3 *MV SeaJet *MV Nico Bryan *MV Estrella Del Mar *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 1 *MV Aleson Con- Carrier 2 *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 3 *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 5 *MV Aleson Con- Carrier 6 *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 8 *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 9 *MV Aleson Con- Carrier 10 *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 11 *MV Aleson Con-Carrier 12 *MV Aleson Con- Carrier 14 *Mv Aleson Con-Carrier 15 Former * MV Danica Joy * MV Lady Mary Joy 2 * MV Estrella Del Mar * MV Aleson == Notable incidents == On February 18, 2016, MV Lady Mary Joy 1 with 308 passengers and 38 crew members grounded off Pampat Point at Bongao island, Philippines.
