    "text": "Wisconsin Family Council (WFC) is a 501(c)(3) group that advocates for Christian fundamentalist policy. WFC's Madison headquarters also house its 501(c)(4) government lobbying arm, Wisconsin Family Action. It was founded as Family Research Institute of Wisconsin by Marvin Munyon in 1986, patterned on the Family Research Institute. The organization got its start advocating for corporal punishment in religious schools and opposing laws granting rights to children. It has since expanded to opposing sex education, campaigning against gay marriage, and opposing laws designed to punish sexual abuse in churches. Today WFC is a Family Policy Council, an organization affiliated with Focus on the Family and the Family Research Council. ==History== Founder Marvin Munyon left his job as an assistant principal at Calvary Baptist School in Watertown, Wisconsin, in 1986 and founded WFC's predecessor organization later that year. A 1991 CNN broadcast about Munyon's time at the school reported \"abuse that several former students are now saying they suffered at the hands of Munyon. They say they weren't just spanked; they were beaten.\" Saying in 1987 that \"youngsters subjected to corporal punishment in Christian schools are taught discipline and respect for authority\", Munyon lead the organization to oppose Senate Bill 163, the first of many campaigns in support of legal corporal punishment in religious schools. In the 1990s, WFC opposed Assembly Bill 387 and Senate Bill 501, laws intended to grant children rights and to allow termination of parental rights for parents who abused or neglected their children. WFC campaigned for a 2006 amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution making gay marriage illegal, and supported a provision to imprison gays for up to 9 months, and fine them up to $10,000, for attempting to marry outside of the state. WFC's campaign was successful; the referendum prohibiting same-sex marriage passed in the 2006 general election. In addition to opposing gay marriage, WFC set about making it more difficult for heterosexual couples to get divorced. CEO Julaine Appling said \"that marriage is indeed under attack and no-fault divorce is one of those attacks.\" In 2009 Wisconsin began to allow same-sex couples to form domestic partnerships so that they could enjoy some of the shared rights of married couples. WFC filed a lawsuit to stop the domestic partnerships. Appling complained that government officials \"are pandering to a marginal group of people and we're challenging that in court.\" In 2010, WFC collaborated with Juneau County District Attorney Scott Southworth in an attempt to criminally prosecute teachers for teaching state- mandated comprehensive sex education. Governor Jim Doyle, who had signed the sex education law, described the attempted prosecutions as \"an unusual argument to make: Follow the law and I'll prosecute you.\" In 2017 WFC opposed legislation to make it easier to prosecute clergy members who molest children and to sue religious organizations for failing to deal with abusers. In August 2019, WFC opposed a birth control access law. The law was introduced by pro- life Republican lawmakers who intend it to reduce abortion. In September 2019, members of the Wisconsin Assembly proposed awarding $500,000 in government grants to an organization named Choose Life Wisconsin, for distribution to crisis pregnancy centers. A representative of the Wisconsin Department of Financial Institutions states that Choose Life Wisconsin \"appears to be an offshoot of the Wisconsin Family Council\". ==Board of directors== The board of directors are responsible for WFC policy. Notable members include: *Jack Hoogendyk, Michigan politician *Randy Melchert, former President of the Civil Rights Section of the State Bar of Wisconsin *Lee Webster, representative on the Wausau School District school board *Jo Egelhoff, Appleton politician ==References== Category:Religion in Wisconsin Category:Christian organizations established in 1986 Category:American Christian political organizations Category:Politics of Wisconsin Category:1986 establishments in Wisconsin Category:Evangelical parachurch organizations Category:Organizations that oppose LGBT rights in the United States Category:Organizations that oppose same-sex marriage ",
