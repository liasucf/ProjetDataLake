She became acquainted with Adam von Trott zu Solz in 1935, happened to travel with him to China, and married him in June 1940. Living in Berlin, the young couple had two daughters, Verena, born in 1942 and Clarita, born in 1943. Given the increasing bombings, she took refuge with her two daughters at her family in-law's in Imshausen, part of the city of Bebra in Hesse. This is where the Gestapo came to arrest them on 20 July 1944. Under the Sippenhaft law (criminal liability of the next of kin to a person considered a criminal), she was placed in custody in the Moabit prison in Berlin while her two daughters, aged respectively 2 years and nine months, were interned under false names in the SS-run children's home of Bornheim in Bad Sachsa. In 1947, Clarita von Trott was one of the first Germans allowed out of Germany after the end of the war, in order to take part in Caux conferences and participate in the reconstruction of Europe. She was invited by Swiss diplomat Philippe Mottu who had been in contact with the conspirators of the plot against Hitler during the war. Her personal testimony transformed the French Socialist MP and former Resistance fighter Irene Laure who became from then on a Franco-German reconciliation activist.\"I ask your forgiveness because we Germans didn't resist early enough, nor strongly enough.\", quoted by Jacqueline Piguet, Pour l'amour de demain, \u00c9ditions de Caux, 1985, 140 pages, , pp. 17-18. In 1950, Clarita von Trott began studying medicine and, in 1965, wrote her thesis on \"the influence of the usual fixers of ultraviolet absorption by serum protein bodies.\" She then obtained qualifications as a psychotherapist and psychoanalyst and practised in Hamburg and Berlin. At the same time, she led the fight to defend the memory of 20 July plot participants and the memory and message of her husband. (Until the 1950s, the widows of the conspirators against Hitler received no state pension, their husbands being listed as \"traitors\".) She teamed up with Freya von Moltke and Rosemarie Reichwein in order to initiate the International Meeting of Youth Kreisau / Krzy\u017cowa. Clarita von Trott kept expressing her message especially to young people, until the end.Article written by German schoolchildren after a visit to Clarita von Trott in 2007 She was honorary president of the Adam von Trott Foundation. The Wilhelm Leuschner medal was awarded to her by the State of Hesse in 1998. ==Family== On 1 March 1942, Verena, the first daughter of Adam and Clarita von Trott, was born in Berlin. Their second daughter Clarita, born on 9 November 1943, would become a famous sociologist and marry fellow sociologist Urs M\u00fcller-Plantenberg. \"My life has been exceptionally rich as a mother thanks to my daughters and their families, and a therapist, thanks to the friendships and the medical treatment of people in a state of mental distress, but in the centre of my existence, Adam's place has remained empty,\" she wrote in 1987, adding in another statement \"My four years of marriage - although they were war years - were in spite of all my most happy years.\" ==Publications== Adam von Trott zu Solz.
