Although Morrisson did not know the man, he knew of Wilson, who was a neighbouring farmer of good financial standing. Accordingly, he let the man have the two cows on credit. In fact, the man was not the son of Wilson but a rogue called Telford. Telford sold the two cows to Robertson. When Morrisson found this out he sought to recover the cows from Robertson. ==Judgment== The action was successful. It was held that there had been no contract between Morrisson and Telford. The purported transaction was a complete nullity. Accordingly, Telford had no rights which he could pass on to Robertson, so Morrisson was entitled to recover his cows. ==See also== * Cundy v Lindsay (1878) 3 App Cas 459, a similar case in English law * Shogun Finance Ltd v Hudson, a 2003 case == References == * Contract, Third Edition, Greens Concise Scots Law, Stephen Woolman & Jonathan Lake.
