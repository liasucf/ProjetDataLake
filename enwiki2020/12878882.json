    "text": "Fish oil, sold under the brand name Omegaven, is a fatty acid emulsion. It is used for total parenteral nutrition (feeding directly into a venous catheter), e.g. in short bowel syndrome. It is rich in omega-3 fatty acids. It has gained popularity in children in preference to the more commonly used Intralipid after case reports that it reduced the risk of liver damage. A 2007 study indicated that the use of Omegaven may be an appropriate intervention strategy for newborns with a very low birth weight, gastrochisis, and jejunal atresia. It is currently undergoing a clinical trial at National Taiwan University Hospital.
