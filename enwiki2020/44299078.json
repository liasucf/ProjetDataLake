    "text": "Maple Hill Cemetery is located on Holly Street, north of the center of Helena, Arkansas. It is set on of land on the east side of Crowley's Ridge, overlooking the Mississippi River, and is the city's largest cemetery. The cemetery was established in 1865, and is laid out in the rural cemetery style which was popular in the mid-19th century. It departs from the norms of this style in retaining a largely rectilinear layout despite having parklike features. The cemetery's entrance is through an elaborately-decorated wrought iron archway, whose posts were given in 1914, and whose arch was given in 1975. The largest monument in the cemetery is the Coolidge Monument, placed by Henry P. Coolidge on the family plot, which is at the highest point of section 3; the monument is a granite column in height, with a life-size sculpture of Coolidge on top. Most of the cemetery (an area of excluding the then-empty section 6) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Helena's Confederate Cemetery, located in the southwest corner of this cemetery, is also separately listed on the National Register. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Phillips County, Arkansas ==References== Category:1865 establishments in Arkansas Category:Arkansas Heritage Trails System Category:Beaux-Arts architecture in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1865 Category:Buildings and structures in Phillips County, Arkansas Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Phillips County, Arkansas ",
