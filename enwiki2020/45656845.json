    "text": "Apollodorus was a tyrant of the ancient Greek city of Cassandreia (formerly Potidaea) in the peninsula of Pallene. He at first pretended to be a friend of the people, but when he had gained their confidence, he formed a conspiracy for the purpose of making himself tyrant, and bound his accomplices by most barbarous ceremonies described in Diodorus.Diodorus Siculus XXII Exc. p. 563. When Apollodorus had gained his object, about 279 BC, he began his tyrannical reign, which in cruelty, rapaciousness and debauchery has seldom been equalled in any country. The ancients mention him along with the most detestable tyrants that ever lived.Polybius VII 7 ; Seneca, De Ira, II 5, De Benef. VII 19. But notwithstanding the support which he derived from the Gauls, who were then penetrating southward, he was unable to maintain himself, and in 276 or 275 he was conquered with the help of the pirate Ameinias the Phocian and put to death by Antigonus II Gonatas.Polyaenus VI 7, IV 6, 18 ; Aelian, F. If. XIV 41 ; Hist. An. V. 15 ; Plutarch, De Sera Num. Vind. 10, 11; Pausanius IV. 5. \u00a7 1; Heinsius, ad Odd. ex Pont.
