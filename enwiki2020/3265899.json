The family moved to Torquay when she was three years old. She attended White Rock Primary school in Paignton. Her father worked intermittently as a painter and decorator, paying for his daughter's vocal lessons while narrowly avoiding bankruptcy, until one Christmas when bankruptcy made the family temporarily homeless. Keedie left school when she was 14 years old to pursue a singing career, signing her first record contract when she was 16 years old, but soon became disillusioned and left to pursue her career alone. ==Career== ===2003\u20132005=== In 2003 Keedie appeared in a local Torquay talent show, \"Stairway to the Stars\"; this appearance brought her to fame.
