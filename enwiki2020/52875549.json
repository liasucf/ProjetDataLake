    "text": "Drumlohan souterrain and ogham stones, known locally as the Ogham Cave, is a souterrain with ogham stones forming a National Monument located in County Waterford, Ireland. ==Location== Drumlohan souterrain and ogham stones are located in farmland 4 km (2\u00bd mi) east of Lemybrien. ==History== The ogham stones were carved between 400 and 700 AD. The souterrain is believed to have been constructed around the 9th century AD and is aligned WSW, facing the setting sun. Souterrains were storage sites and places of refuge. In July/August 1867 a local farmer rediscovered the souterrain and ogham stones. In 1936 part of the souterrain was dismantled and some of the ogham stones re- erected above ground. ==Description== ===Souterrain=== This souterrain gallery is about 4.9 m (16 ft) long and 1.3 m (4 ft) wide, with a roof height of up to 1.2 m (4 ft). It is constructed of orthostats roofed with lintels, and ten ogham stones were used as lintels and sidestones (some of them being installed upside-down). One of the roofstones bears cup marks. ===Ogham stones=== The stones (CIIC 272\u2013281) vary in size. All are greenschist, except for two of slate and one of conglomerate. The inscriptions are: *MANU MAGUNO GATI MOCOI MACORBO (of Manu the boy of G\u00e1eth, of the tribe of Macorbo) \u2014 perhaps the D\u00e1l Maic-Cuirp, one of the D\u00e9isi Muman *CALUNOVIC[A] MAQI MUCOI LIT[EN]\u1eca (of Culann, son of the tribe of Litenos) *MAQI-INI \u0323 \u0323 ? \u0323 \u0323 MAQI(?)
