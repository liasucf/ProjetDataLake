    "text": "Martha Skelton Jefferson (n\u00e9e Wayles; October 19 or 30, 1748 \u2013 September 6, 1782) was the wife of Thomas Jefferson. She served as First Lady of Virginia during Thomas' term as Governor from 1779 to 1781, but did not serve as First Lady of the country because she died in 1782, 19 years before he became President. Of the six children born to Thomas and Martha, only two survived to adulthood, Martha and Mary. Martha died four months after the birth of her last child. It is widely held that Thomas had a long-standing relationship and children with Martha's half-sister, Sally Hemings, a favored slave who was three-quarters white. Thomas burned their letters to each other and rarely spoke of her, so she remains a somewhat enigmatic figure. (Similarly, Jefferson did not speak much of his mother, Jane Randolph Jefferson, or his best friend.) == Early life and education == Martha Wayles was born on October 19 or 30, 1748, the daughter of Martha Eppes Wayles (1721\u20131748) and John Wayles (1715\u20131773) of The Forest plantation near Colonial Williamsburg in Charles City County, Virginia. Their only child, Martha was nicknamed \"Patty\". John Wayles was an attorney, slave trader, business agent for Bristol-based merchants Farrell & Jones, and prosperous planter. Born in Lancaster, England, he emigrated to the Colony of Virginia, probably in the 1730s. Martha Eppes Wayles was a daughter of Francis Eppes of Bermuda Hundred, an early Virginia settlement along the Appomattox River. While little is known of Martha Eppes Wayles' life, she had an appreciation for fine literature, such as her favorite novel, Tristram Shandy and Les Aventures de T\u00e9l\u00e9maque. (Her rebound version of the book, The Adventures of Telemachus, contains her signature on the title page and resides at the Library of Congress). Martha Wayles had two stepmothers, neither of whom lived long after their marriages to John Wayles, and through one stepmother she had four half-sisters. John Wayles then took Betty Hemings as a mistress, and gave Martha additional half-siblings. Martha likely received her education\u2014including literature, dance, music, French language and Bible study\u2014 from private tutors or women in the family. She became the \"Lady of the House\" after her second stepmother died when she was 13 years of age and was often a hostess to John Wayles' social events and helped manage his business and household affairs. She knew how to make candles, soap, butter and remedies for illnesses. == Marriages and children == Martha Wayles first married Bathurst Skelton (born 1744), an attorney, on November 20, 1766. Their son, John, was born on November 7, 1767. Bathurst Skelton died on September 30, 1768. Martha moved back to The Forest following her husband's death. Three-year-old John died on June 10, 1771. Mather Brown, Thomas Jefferson, 1786, oil painting, National Portrait Gallery Her third cousin, Thomas Jefferson likely began courting Martha in December 1770. They shared an interest in horse-back riding, literature, and music. As part of Martha's dowry for their January 1, 1772 wedding, Thomas and Martha received property, including the Elk Hill plantation, where Martha had lived with her first husband, and a great number of slaves, which helped Thomas complete the construction of the Monticello residence and landscaping of the estate's 5,000 acres. While Monticello was undergoing construction and Thomas was away, Martha often stayed at the Elk Hill plantation. They had six children, but only two daughters reached adulthood. An unnamed son, Jane Randolph, and Lucy Elizabeth, who died of whooping cough, died as infants. Only the eldest, Martha \"Patsy\" Jefferson, survived past the age of 25: * Martha \"Patsy\" Jefferson (September 27, 1772October 10, 1836) * Jane Randolph Jefferson (April 3, 1774September 1775) * unnamed son (May 28June 14, 1777), lived for 17 days * Mary \"Maria or Polly\" Jefferson (August 1, 1778April 17, 1804) * Lucy Elizabeth Jefferson (November 3, 1780April 15, 1781/April 15, 1782) * Lucy Elizabeth Jefferson (May 8, 1782October 13, 1784/November 17, 1785) ==Slaves and Wayles' estate== Martha and Thomas Jefferson acquired a number of slaves as part of her dowry for her marriage, and later from the estate of John Wayles, which made Thomas the second largest slave owner in Albemarle County. The dowry increased the number of slaves he owned from 52 to 187. Among the more than 100 slaves were Betty Hemings, of mixed-race ancestry, and her 10 mixed-race children. The youngest, an infant, was Sally Hemings. The six youngest were three-quarters white in ancestry and half-siblings of Martha Wayles Jefferson, as they were fathered by her father. Betty also had four children born before those of Wayles'. All the Hemings family members gained privileged positions among the slaves at Monticello, where they were trained and worked as domestic servants, chefs, and highly skilled artisans. Sally Hemings, who was fathered by John Wayles, was the half-sister of Martha Wayles Jefferson, and the subject of a scandal about her relationship with Thomas Jefferson. Martha's father, John Wayles, died at age 58 in 1773. He left substantial property, including slaves, but the estate was encumbered with debt.Death notice from The Virginia Gazette, June 3, 1773: \"On Friday last died, at his house in Charles City, JOHN WAYLES, Esquire, attorney at law.\" Upon Wayles' death, Betty Hemings and her six children with John Wayles were moved \"without hesitancy\" to Monticello to prevent the Hemings from being separated. The estate was worth \u20a430,000, but was in debt to Farrell and Jones in Briston for \u20a411,000. Wayles three sons-in-law, including Thomas Jefferson, decided to break up the estate and its debts. Martha and her husband Thomas Jefferson inherited the Willis Creek and Elk Hill plantations and a total of 135 people, including members of the Hemings family. They also inherited \u20a44,000 in debt. Jefferson and other co-executors of the Wayles estate worked for years to clear the debt and the overwhelming debt led to Thomas Jefferson's financial ruin. ==Temperament and appearance== A 1965 oil portrait of Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson by artist George Geygan, based on contemporary descriptions of her physical attributes and executed 183 years after her death. (First Ladies Cookbook, Parents Press) There are no surviving contemporaneous portraits of Martha Jefferson, but she has been described by family members and Isaac Granger Jefferson as small, graceful, and pretty and like her daughter, Mary Jefferson Eppes. She was described by Robert Skipwith, her sister's husband, as having possessed \"... the greatest fund of good nature ... that sprightliness and sensibility which promises to ensure you the greatest happiness mortals are capable of enjoying.\" As Thomas was having Monticello built, he obtained a piano forte from England for Martha as a wedding present. She played the harpsichord piano forte, while Thomas Jefferson played violins. It was said that Martha played the Harpsichord \"very skilfully and who, is in all respects a very agreeable sensible and accomplished lady,\" according to a Hessian officer, Jacob Rubsamen, who visited Monticello in 1780. Original front elevation drawing of Monticello, 1771 According to her daughter, Martha Jefferson was highly educated and musical, a constant reader, with a good nature and a vivacious temper that sometimes bordered on tartness. She had great affection for her husband. She was a little over five feet tall, with a lithe figure, auburn hair, and hazel eyes. She was an accomplished needlewoman, some of her embroidery still exists. Martha maintained a collection of notes regarding her household duties and recipes, such as butchering and curing meat and the creation of large batches of soft and hard soap, candles, and beer. During her first year of marriage she began the practice of brewing beer, producing 170 gallons that year. ==First lady of Virginia== Governor's Palace, Governor Jefferson's residence in Williamsburg Martha Jefferson was First Lady of Virginia from 1779 to 1781, during the American Revolution. In that capacity, and in response to a request from Martha Washington, Mrs. Jefferson led a drive among the women of Virginia to raise funds and supplies for her state's militia in the Continental Army to the extent that her health permitted.Kukla, John. Mr. Jefferson's Women, p. 118 (New York: Knopf Books, 2007). The letter to James Madison's mother, Eleanor Conway Madison, is the only letter written by Martha Jefferson known to now exist. She published an appeal in the Virginia Gazette, announcing that collections would be taken in the churches. Nationally, the Ladies Association raised $300,000 to buy linen shirts for Washington's army.Hendricks, Nancy. America's First Ladies: A Historical Encyclopedia and Primary Document Collection of the Remarkable Women of the White House, p. 23 (ABC-CLIO, 2015). Mrs. Jefferson also contacted other prominent Virginians to raise funds for the troops, including Nelly Madison, mother of James Madison. ==Health problems and death== Monticello Family Graveyard, including Thomas Jefferson's gravesite Managing the Jefferson household became increasingly difficult for Martha Jefferson, who had endured at least one case of smallpox, may have had diabetes, and was weakened by her numerous pregnancies, which would ultimately kill her. She bore the stress of having to flee a British invasion of Richmond in early January 1781 and a raid on Monticello in June of that year, during which she had to travel with infant children, many of whom died. She was aware that the British were interested in capturing her or her husband. Thomas limited his political service due to her health. Jefferson, in Philadelphia for the Second Continental Congress of 1776 that drafted the Declaration of Independence, wished to return to her as soon as possible. Thomas served as governor and in the House of Delegates in Virginia. He rejected the offer to serve as the as a commissioner to France made by the Continental Congress while she was alive. The birth of their youngest child in May 1782 was reportedly the most difficult pregnancy for Mrs. Jefferson, having carried a very large baby. Edmond Randolph wrote in the month of her death that Thomas was \"inconsolable\" about Martha's declining health and pain.\" Mrs. Jefferson's health worsened and she died on September 6, 1782, four months after the birth of her last child. Jefferson was inconsolable. She was buried at Monticello and her tombstone included the words from Thomas' perspective: \"Torn from him by death\" and \"This monument of his love is inscribed\". So that her children would not grow up with stepmothers, Martha had asked Thomas Jefferson to never marry again, and he never did. Her request has been attributed to her own disagreeable relationships with her step- mothers. At her death, she was 33; he was 39.Hyland Jr., William G.
