The President of the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, delivered his sixteenth commemorative address to the nation after the parade inspection presided over by Minister of Defense General of the Army Sergey Shoygu, accompanied by the parade commander General of the Army Oleg Salyukov, Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Ground Forces, who participated in the parade for the sixth straight year. == Particularities == As in past pre-jubilee parades, the parade serves as a preparatory celebration and a national kick-off to the 75th Diamond Jubilee celebrations of the Allied victory in Eastern Europe over the Axis powers (slated for May 2020), while also honoring the men and women of the Russian Armed Forces who have served in Syria. A specialized version of an Aurus Senat armored limousine was expected to be introduced during the parade, serving the purpose of carrying the Defence Minister and the parade commander in Red Square, replacing the vehicles used in past parades.https://www.urdupoint.com/en/amp/world/high-class-convertible-aurus- to-take-part-in-580006.html Nikolai Samokhvalov's Ceremonial Fanfare was sounded for the first time in close to 20 years prior to the speech of President Putin.

Celebrations of the holiday are held in almost all the former republics of the Soviet Union.
