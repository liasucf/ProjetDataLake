It was set up in 2005What is the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Hub, archived 2006-04-06 by archive.org, accessed 2014-06-07 and closed in 2008. The Hub worked to create sustainable environment whereby charities and community groups can benefit from the use of information and communications technology (ICT). Smaller organisations can benefit enormously from effective use of technology, whether this is by building a website to communicate with its beneficiaries, or creating a database to manage its members. However charitable organisations often do not have the funds or expertise to implement technological solutions successfully. The ICT Hub aimed to help charities overcome these barriers. To achieve this the Hub offered services and support including: *Educational events and seminars *Publications that cover all aspects of ICT *Circuit Rider \u2013 mobile IT technicians who offer low cost IT support *IT volunteers \u2013 professionals who give up their time to help charities implement technology solutions *Accessibility audits for charities *Online resources and useful information *Regional champions - individuals in each of the English regions who offer local advice and support e.g. Regional ICT Champion for Yorkshire and Humber *Helpdesk \u2013 a free telephone number where charities can be signposted to services and support in their local area The ICT Hub was part of the UK\u2019s Home Office ChangeUp programme for strengthening the capacity of the voluntary and community sector. Funding for the ICT Hub ended March 2008. The Hub consisted of a partnership of organisations: *NAVCA (National Association for Voluntary and Community Action) *AbilityNet *NCVO (National Council for Voluntary Organisations) *Lasa (London Advice Services Alliance) *iT4Communities * Media Trust == References == == External links == *The ICT Hub website *The Knowledgebase *Lasa *NAVCA There is also a Wikipedia page explaining what a Council for Voluntary Service is. *iT4Communities *NCVO, the National Council of Voluntary Organisations *Regional ICT Champion for Yorkshire and Humber Category:2005 establishments in England Category:2008 disestablishments in England Category:Information technology organisations based in the United Kingdom ",
