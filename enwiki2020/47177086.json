    "text": "Music of African heritage in Cuba derives from the musical traditions of the many ethnic groups from different parts of West Africa that were brought to Cuba as slaves between the 16th and 19th centuries. Members of some of these groups formed their own ethnic associations or cabildos, in which cultural traditions were conserved, including musical ones. Much of this music is associated with traditional African religionLucumi, Palo, and othersand preserves the languages formerly used in the African homelands. The music is passed on by oral tradition and is often performed in private gatherings difficult for outsiders to access. Lacking melodic instruments, the music instead features polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call-and-response), and dance. African styles have been brought into some mainstream Cuban music. == Origins of Cuban African groups == Rumba drummers Clearly, the origin of African groups in Cuba is due to the island's long history of slavery. Compared to the USA, slavery started in Cuba much earlier and continued for decades afterwards. Cuba was the last country in the Americas to abolish the importation of slaves, and the second last to free the slaves. In 1807 the British Parliament outlawed slavery, and from then on the British Navy acted to intercept Portuguese and Spanish slave ships. By 1860 the trade with Cuba was almost extinguished; the last slave ship to Cuba was in 1873. The abolition of slavery was announced by the Spanish Crown in 1880, and put into effect in 1886. Two years later, Brazil abolished slavery.Detailed references in Thomas, Hugh 1971. Cuba, or the pursuit of freedom. Eyre & Spottiswoode, London; Thomas, Hugh 1997.

Although the exact number of slaves from each African culture will never be known, most came from one of these groups, which are listed in rough order of their cultural impact in Cuba: # The Congolese from the Congo basin and SW Africa. Many ethnic groups were involved, all called Congos in Cuba. Their religion is called Palo. Probably the most numerous group, with a huge influence on Cuban music. # The Oy\u00f3 or Yoruba from modern Nigeria, known in Cuba as Lucum\u00ed. Their religion is known as Regla de Ocha (roughly, 'the way of the spirits') and its syncretic version known as Santer\u00eda. Culturally of great significance. # The Kalabars from part of Nigeria and Cameroon. These semi-Bant\u00fa groups are known in Cuba as Carabali, and their religious organization as Abaku\u00e1. The street name for them in Cuba was \u00d1\u00e1\u00f1igos. # The Dahomey, from Benin. They were the Fon, known as Arar\u00e1 in Cuba. The Dahomeys were a powerful group who practised human sacrifice and slavery long before Europeans arrived, and allegedly even more so during the Atlantic slave trade.Sublette, Ned 2004.

Leaving aside the French, who also came, the Africans from Haiti were a mixture of groups who usually spoke creolized French: and religion was known as vod\u00fa. # From part of modern Liberia and C\u00f4te d'Ivoire came the Gang\u00e1. # Senegambian people (Senegal, the Gambia), but including many brought from Sudan by the Arab slavers, were known by a catch-all word: Mandinga. The famous musical phrase Kikiribu Mandinga! refers to them. ==Subsequent organization== The roots of most Afro-Cuban musical forms lie in the cabildos, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves, separate cabildos for separate cultures. The cabildos were formed mainly from four groups: the Yoruba (the Lucumi in Cuba); the Congolese (Palo in Cuba); Dahomey (the Fon or Arar\u00e1). Other cultures were undoubtedly present, more even than listed above, but in smaller numbers, and they did not leave such a distinctive presence. Cabildos preserved African cultural traditions, even after the abolition of slavery in 1886. At the same time, African religions were transmitted from generation to generation throughout Cuba, Haiti, other islands and Brazil. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as Lucumi or Regla de Ocha if they derived from the Yoruba, Palo from Central Africa, Vod\u00fa from Haiti, and so on. The term Santer\u00eda was first introduced to account for the way African spirits were joined to Catholic saints, especially by people who were both baptized and initiated, and so were genuinely members of both groups. Outsiders picked up the word and have tended to use it somewhat indiscriminately. It has become a kind of catch-all word, rather like salsa in music.Sublette, Ned 2004. Cuba and its music: from the first drums to the mambo. Chicago. The \u00f1\u00e1\u00f1igos in Cuba or CarabaliA corruption of the correct term: the Kalabari in their secret Abaku\u00e1 societies, were one of the most terrifying groups; even other blacks were afraid of them: > Girl, don't tell me about the \u00f1\u00e1\u00f1igos! They were bad. The carabali was evil > down to his guts. And the \u00f1\u00e1\u00f1igos from back in the day when I was a chick, > weren't like the ones today... they kept their secret, like in Africa.as > told by an 80-year-old black woman to Lydia Cabrera, 1958.

The best preserved are the African polytheistic religions, where, in Cuba at least, the instruments, the language, the chants, the dances and their interpretations are quite well preserved. In few or no other American countries are the religious ceremonies conducted in the old language(s) of Africa, as they are at least in Lucum\u00ed ceremonies, though of course, back in Africa the language has moved on. What unifies all genuine forms of African music is the unity of polyrhythmic percussion, voice (call- and-response) and dance in well-defined social settings, and the absence of melodic instruments of an Arabic or European kind. Not until after the Second World War do we find detailed printed descriptions or recordings of African sacred music in Cuba. Inside the cults, music, song, dance and ceremony were (and still are) learnt by heart by means of demonstration, including such ceremonial procedures conducted in an African language. The experiences were private to the initiated, until the work of the ethnologist Fernando Ort\u00edz, who devoted a large part of his life to investigating the influence of African culture in Cuba. The first detailed transcription of percussion, song and chants are to be found in his great works.Ortiz, Fernando 1950. La Africania de la musica folklorica de Cuba. La Habana, revised ed 1965.Ortiz, Fernando 1951. Los bailes y el teatro de los negros en el folklore de Cuba. Letras Cubanas, La Habana. Continuation of the previous book. There are now many recordings offering a selection of pieces in praise of, or prayers to, the orishas. Much of the ceremonial procedures are still hidden from the eyes of outsiders, though some descriptions in words exist. ==Yoruba and Congolese rituals== Religious traditions of African origin have survived in Cuba, and are the basis of ritual music, song and dance quite distinct from the secular music and dance. The religion of Yoruban origin is known as Lucum\u00ed or Regla de Ocha; the religion of Congolese origin is known as Palo, as in palos del monte.Palo is a word derived from the Ki-Kongo mpali, meaning witchcraft. Orovio, Helio 2004. Cuban music from A to Z. p159 There are also, in the Oriente region, forms of Haitian ritual together with its own instruments and music. In Lucumi ceremonies, consecrated bat\u00e1 drums are played at ceremonies, and gourd ensembles called abwe. In the 1950s, a collection of Havana-area bat\u00e1 drummers called Santero helped bring Lucum\u00ed styles into mainstream Cuban music, while artists like Mezcla, with the lucum\u00ed singer L\u00e1zaro Ros, melded the style with other forms, including zouk. The Congo cabildo uses yuka drums, as well as gallos (a form of song contest), makuta and mani dances. The latter is related to the Brazilian martial dance capoeira. ==References== . .
