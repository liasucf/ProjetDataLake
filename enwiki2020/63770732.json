    "text": "M.C. and Others v Italy (also known as Affaire M. C. et Autres c. Italie) is a case decided by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) on 3 September 2013 in which Article 1 of Protocol 1 (A1P1) was engaged due to the applicants not being afforded annual uprating which the court deemed damage to their property of a disproportionate character in the form of an exorbitant charge. ==Background== The applicants were 162 Italian nationals who had either received blood transfusions or blood products contaminated with various blood- borne viruses. The applicants, all of whom were given anonymity, complained that part of the compensation they received because of the contamination was not being afforded an annual reassessment according to the inflation rate. Following transfusions or the administration of blood derivatives, the applicants were infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and/or hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C. Forty of the applicants or their relatives suffered from haemophilia, a condition that requires frequent infusions of blood products. The other applicants were infected through blood transfusions carried out during hospital treatment. The compensation was to include a supplementary indemnity, in Italian \u2033indennit\u00e0 integrativa speciale\u2033, abbreviated to \u2033IIS\u2033. This indemnity component (IIS) was to be subject to reassessment based on the annual rate of inflation and was intended to prevent or reduce the effects of currency devaluation. However, the Italian government made interventions as to the re-assessment of this supplementary allowance (the IIS) as they believed that it was not possible to uprate the amount in line with inflation. In the absence of the annual revaluation, the monetary value of the IIS was fated to gradually decrease. In addition, the IIS was thought to represent between 90% and 95% of the total amount of the compensation. The applicants presented accountancy expertise demonstrating that those who had a right to the revaluation of the IIS were being deprived every month of around 200 euros. ===Applicant's situation=== During the case, the health of several of the applicants suffered serious deterioration due to the viruses with which they were infected. The infection with contaminated blood and blood products had led to some suffering liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or a combination of several pathologies, in some, both AIDS and hepatitis. In some cases, this was often accompanied by the underlying condition of haemophilia. One applicant suffered from a nervous breakdown leading to several suicide attempts. From the point the case application had been communicated to the Italian government, six applicants unfortunately died. Their heirs were then established in the Court proceedings. The applicants provided medical certificates and expert medical reports showing the reduced life expectancy of people infected with the hepatitis virus and HIV. The expert evidence made out a strict link between the applicant\u2019s prognosis of survival and the beneficial effect of the compensation allowances in question. The Court considered that they were obligated to take the pathologies of the applicants into account. In particular, how during the proceedings, six of them had died. The judges also attached particular importance to the fact that the annual reassessment (the IIS) represented more than 90% of the total amount of the compensation paid to the applicants. ==Relevant law== Under Law No. 210/1992, the applicants received compensation from the Italian Ministry of Health for the permanent damage they suffered as a result of their contamination. Law No. 210/1992 stated that additional compensation, \u2033indennizzo ulteriore\u2033, is to be granted to persons who have suffered damage as a result of compulsory vaccinations and that this additional compensation should be subject to an annual reassessment based on the rate of inflation. The applicant's arguments relied on various articles and protocols of the European Convention on Human Rights as follows: Article 6 section 1, Article 13, Article 14, Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 12. ==Judgment== The judges decided that the applicants had suffered damage to their property of a disproportionate character due to the adoption by the Italian government of Legislative Decree No. 78/2010. This decree placed an \u2033abnormal and exorbitant charge\u2033 (\u2033charge anormale et exorbitante\u2033) on the applicants, and in the opinion of the court upset the fair balance between the demands of the general interest and the safeguarding of individual\u2032s fundamental rights. The judges were unanimous in finding that there had been a violation of Article 14 of the Convention along with a declaration that the application was admissible under A1P1 (Article 1 of Protocol No. 1). By way of remedy, the Italian government was required by the ECHR to set, within 6 months, a time\u2013limit by which the State must undertake to guarantee the payment of the re\u2013assessed IIS to any applicant entitled to the compensation under Law no. 210/1992 and that the payments should be back- dated to the point from which it had been granted to them. ==See also== * A and Others v National Blood Authority and Another (UK Consumer law case involving claimants infected with hepatitis C) * R (March) v Secretary of State for Health, 2010 judicial review by a claimant treated with contaminated blood products. * Contaminated blood scandal in the United Kingdom * Contaminated haemophilia blood products (mentions contaminated blood in Italy) ==References== Category:2013 in case law Category:European Court of Human Rights cases involving Italy Category:Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights Category:Article 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights ",
