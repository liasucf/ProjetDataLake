    "text": "Cura-Mall\u00edn Group () is a heterogeneous group of volcano-sedimentary formations of Oligocene-Miocene age, Colhuehuapian to Laventan in the SALMA classification, in south-central Chile and nearby parts of Argentina.Pedroza et al., 2017 The sediments belonging to the group were deposited in a lacustrine environment and alongside rivers in an intra-arc basin.Su\u00e1rez & Emparan, 1995 Southeast of Laguna del Laja Cura-Mall\u00edn Group has a thickness of more than . The sediments making up the group deposited in an interval between 22 and 8 million years ago. The Cura-Mall\u00edn Group has a north-south elongate form. The group is considered an equivalent of Abanico Formation, either as a southern extension or as a lateral equivalent of that formation.Flynn et al., 2008 == Stratigraphy and members == Various subdivision schemes have been proposed for the Cura-Mall\u00edn unit since the 1980s. In 1983, Niemeyer and Mu\u00f1oz identified two members; the R\u00edo Queuco Member, overlain by the Malla Malla Member. In two publications published in 1995 and 1997, Su\u00e1rez and Emperan divided Cura-Mall\u00edn Formation in two diachronous members: Guapitr\u00edo and R\u00edo Pedregoso. Utg\u00e9 et al. (2009) proposed instead a subdivision into an upper Arroyo Pincheira Member and a lower Lumabia Member.Utg\u00e9 et al., 2009 In a 2017 revision the Cura-Mall\u00edn, formerly a formation, was redefined as a group given its great variety of lithologies. The Guapitr\u00edo, R\u00edo Pedregoso members of Su\u00e1rez and Emperan became formations according to this scheme. In addition the new scheme include the Mitrauqu\u00e9n Formation that overlies both the Guapitr\u00edo and R\u00edo Pedregoso Formations as a third formation in the group. == Cura-Mall\u00edn Basin == A number of geologists consider Cura-Mall\u00edn Basin, the sedimentary basin where the formation deposited, an extensional basin that developed on the western fringes of the much larger Neuqu\u00e9n Basin, while others consider it a back-arc basin. In the Upper Miocene the sedimentary basin was inverted.Radic, 2010 Relative to other nearby sedimentary basins of Miocene and Oligocene age Cura-Mall\u00edn Basin has been more researched.Franzese et al., 2011 == Fossil content == The group contains abundant mammal fossils including bony fishes, birds and mammals such as rodents, marsupials, Mylodontidaes and Notoungulatas. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !

Of all units the Ruca\u00f1anco Member of Guapitrio Formation has been judged to have the most promising reservoir potential. == References == === Bibliography === * * * * * * * Category:Geologic groups of South America Category:Geologic formations of Chile Category:Geologic formations of Argentina Category:Miocene Series of South America Category:Oligocene Series of South America Category:Laventan Category:Colloncuran Category:Friasian Category:Santacrucian Category:Colhuehuapian Category:Neogene Chile Category:Paleontology in Chile Category:Geology of Araucan\u00eda Region Category:Geology of Biob\u00edo Region Category:Geology of Maule Region Category:Geology of Neuqu\u00e9n Province ",
