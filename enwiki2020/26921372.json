    "text": "PMI Colleges, formerly known as Philippine Maritime Institute, is a private, non-sectarian, co-educational higher education, Maritime institution established on September 18, 1948 in Sta. Cruz, Manila, Philippines where its main campus is located. PMI Colleges is considered as the second oldest and the largest among over one hundred private maritime schools in the country. At present, it is the biggest nautical school in the country, averaging nearly 3500 nautical and marine engineering graduates every year. ==History== The Philippine Maritime Institute was founded on September 18, 1948 by Atty. Tomas Cloma, also a Self-Styled Admiral and his father Tomas Cloma Sr., discoverer of the Kalayaan Group of Islands. It was the first private maritime school in the Philippines with nineteen (19) students enrolled in the Associate in Nautical Science course in a classroom on a floating barge moored in Pasig River at Plaza Lawton. The first quarterly enrolment was fifty-four. The school provided a one-year Nautical course in three separate session-morning, afternoon and evening. It was housed in two buildings in David Street, now Burke Street, near Escolta, Manila. The first graduates successfully passed the Civil Service examination given by the Board of Marine Engineers for Deck Officers. The school had two training ships: the motor launched \"Victoria\" and the \"S/S Clavecillia\" which were used as training ships during weekends. It was granted recognition by the Secretary of Department of Education in January 1950. The Graduates had the same status as those of the government nautical school. Legislation had favored graduates of the school by exempting them from taking the Third Mate\u2019s technical examination given by the board of marine Examiners for Deck Officers until 1954. The Nautical curriculum was lengthened to two years after PMI petitioned the Department of Education through the private Schools to offer a two-year course in Nautical Science leading to the title of Associate in Nautical Science (ANS), which was granted on February 13, 1953. On June 14, 1983 the four-year course in Nautical Science was granted recognition by the then Ministry of Education and Culture. PMI currently has three campuses in the country \u2013 Manila, Quezon City, and Tagbilaran City. ==College Academic Departments== *Department of Marine Transportation. The Department of Marine Transportation is the PMI's first flagship program that started as the Associate in Marine Transportation (AMT) in 1948 with twenty five students. *Department of Marine Engineering.

The Department of Customs Administration was born on 1954.

The curriculum was approved by the Department of Education. *Department of Naval Science and Tactics. The school also has its Department of Naval Science and Tactics under the control and supervision of the Naval Reserve Command (NavResCom) of Philippine Navy.
