He is the co-founder and CEO of OpenBCI, a company dedicated to open source innovation of brain-computer interface technologies. Conor is also a teacher, having taught graduate level courses at Parsons School of Design and NYU Tisch School of the Arts. ==Early life== Conor Russomanno was born in Livingston, NJ, but spent his childhood growing up in Northern Virginia. After attending Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, Conor was recruited to Columbia to play NCAA college football. After playing college football for 1 year, Conor quit and joined Columbia's rugby club, CURFC. He then served as the club's president and was voted first-team All-Ivy Fullback as a senior. ==Career== As an undergraduate at Columbia University, Conor studied civil engineering & engineering mechanics while teaching computer graphics and developing Unity-based virtual environments under NSF funding. Conor later discovered brain-computer interfacing (BCI) as a Design & Technology MFA student at Parsons School of Design. After graduating from Parsons, Conor led two successful Kickstarter campaigns, raising close to $500,000, allowing him to develop OpenBCI. Conor has also worked as adjunct faculty at Parsons School of Design and NYU's Interactive Telecommunication Program (ITP), where he has taught Creative Coding, Brain Hacking, Designing Consciousness, and a number of other courses.http://conorrussomanno.com/ He now teaches a course titled \"Neuromachina: Man & Machine\" at NYU Tisch School of the Arts. Conor now serves as a \"Something In Residence\" in the ITP program at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. ==Speaking Engagements & Workshops== * \"Brain-Computer Interfaces & Apparel\" \u2013 Brooklyn Fashion + Design Accelerator (BF+DA) (Brooklyn, NY), February 21, 2017 * \"Brain-Computer Interface\" \u2013 NYU Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP) (New York, NY), February 2, 2017 * \"AR Human Computer Interfaces\" (Panel) \u2013 AR in Action, MIT Media Lab (Cambridge, MA), January 17, 2017 * Guest Lecture for Topics in Computational Neuroscience and Neuroengineering: Brain-Computer Interfaces, Columbia University Biomedical Engineering (New York, NY), November 1, 2016 * \"An Introduction to BCI\" \u2013 Columbia University Neuroscience Society (New York, NY), October 24, 2016 * \"Dawn of The Neurorevolution\" \u2013 SuperHuman Summit 2016 (Vancouver, Canada), October 22, 2016 * \"The Democratization of Neurotechnology\" \u2013 NeuroTech NYC 2016 (New York, NY), June 8, 2016 * \"An Introduction to BCI\" \u2013 Xtech & Neurogaming Hackathon 2016 (San Francisco, CA), May 14, 2016 * \"DIY Cyborgia\" \u2013 BodyHacking Con 2016 (Austin, TX), February 20, 2016https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BeX9adlEGOY * \"Neural Interfaces for Makers and Biohackers\" \u2013 MakerCon Bay Area (San Francisco, CA), May 12, 2015 * \"Future of Augmented Reality Panel\" \u2013 NeuroGaming 2015, (San Francisco, CA), May 8, 2015 * \"The Digital Self: Interfacing the Body\" \u2013 Eyebeam Studio (Brooklyn, NY), April 25, 2015 * \"BCIs for the Masses\" (panel) \u2013 IBT BrainTech 2015 (Tel Aviv, Israel), March 11, 2015 * The Startup Segment \u2013 FT Innovate America 2014 (New York, NY), December 12, 2014 * \u201cOut of Your Mind: Rise of The Brain-Computer Interface\u201d \u2013 Make Magazine (Vol. 41 Oct/Nov 2014) * \"Brain- Computer Interfaces & Serious Gaming\" \u2013 Nordic Digital Business Summit 2014 (Helsinki, Finland), Sept. 4th, 2014 * \"Future of Augmented Reality Panel\" \u2013 NeuroGaming 2014, (San Francisco, CA), May 5, 2014 ==References== ==External links== * \"Meet the Hackers Who Are Decrypting Your Brainwaves\".
