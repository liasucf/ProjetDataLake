He studied up to F.A. with the financial support of his father. After completing his studies, Mappillai began working as a treasury officer (Muthalpadikkaran). Later on he took up the job of a \u2018munshi\u2019 (Malayalam teacher) in a CMS School for a short period. He was the editor of \u2018Kerala Mithram\u2019 which was published in 1881 from Cochin. His journalistic mind and love for literature paved way for establishing the Malayala Manorama Company in 1888. On 22 March 1890, (M.E 1065, Meenam 10th) the first issue of Malayala Manorama was published. ==Literary contributions== The Malayalam language and journalism were the soul and spirit of Varghese Mappillai. Under his leadership and vision Malayala Manorama progressed. He utilized the media to nourish and flourish Malayalam language and literature. K. M. Cherian, Kattakayam Cherian Mappillai, Kottarathil Sankunni, K. C. Kesava Pillai and C. S. Subramaniam Potti were his close associates. Varghese Mappillai became an established writer at his young age. The Malayalam Primer for Children written by Varghese Mappillai was, however, not known to many. The drama Abrayakutty, an independent Malayalam translation of William Shakespeare\u2019s The Taming of the Shrew, and Keerthanamala were some of the contributions by him to Malayalam literature. Varghese Mappillai formed an association for Malayalam writers called Kavisamajam. He also formed an association called Bhashaposhini which later on became a magazine encouraging literature and language. Varghese Mappillai also made noteworthy contributions in reforming the Malayalam alphabet. == References == Category:Malayalam-language writers Category:1857 births Category:1904 deaths Category:19th-century publishers (people) Category:Indian publishers (people) ",
