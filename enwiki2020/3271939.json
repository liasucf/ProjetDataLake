It was designed by Prasit Nunsung from Nonthaburi. The three boats in the logo represents the development, the blending of colours and the technology of Thailand. While the yellow colour on the largest boat represents the King itself, it along with red and blue are the colours on the flags of the Southeast Asian nations and represents the unity and friendship among the games participants and the people of Southeast Asia. The Southeast Asian Games Federation logo, the 10-circle chain represents the 10 member nations, excluding Timor-Leste and the Southeast Asian Games itself. The shape of the boats that resemble the Pimai castle, represents the host city Nakhon Ratchasima, the Northeast region of Thailand and its civilisation one thousand years ago. The mascot of the 2007 SEA Games is a Korat cat named Can. The Korat cat is a slate blue-grey shorthair domestic cat with a small to medium build and a low percentage of body fat. It is one of the oldest stable cat breeds in Thailand and named after the Nakhon Ratchasima (Korat) province. As a mascot it wears \"Pha Khao Ma\", a traditional Thai loincloth, and plays the khaen, a Northeastern-style mouth organ. The name of the musical instrument aforementioned, coincidentally has a similar pronunciation to the mascot's name. The mascot was created by Sa-ard Jomnagrm and its name \"Can\" was given by an eight-year-old girl, Piyathida Sreewimon. The word \"Can\" in English simply means Can which is a short word that can be spoken easily and represents the attitude of the athletes in their quest to win gold medals. Four songs were composed for the games including Rhythm of The Winner, the theme song of the games. The other songs are: We are The Water, Friendship Card and Korat SEA Games.Songs SEA Games 2007 Songs ==Venues== Most of the games will be held in the $65 million sports complex on Pakthongchai Road in Nakhon Ratchasima.Organizing committee reports sports stadium ready for the Games The sports complex holds the 20,000-seater His Majesty the King's 80th Birthday Anniversary, 5th December 2007 Sports Complex.
