The organisation had its beginnings at the Universities of Melbourne and Adelaide in 1887 and later became a national body in 1918. It now has six state offices as well as a Federal Office in Melbourne. The Federal Board consists of representatives of educational institutions that are signatories to the AMEB constitution. These are the Universities of Melbourne, Adelaide and Western Australia, the Minister for Education and Training, New South Wales, the Minister for Education, Training and Employment, Queensland and the Minister for Education and Skills, Tasmania through the University of Tasmania. The AMEB is used to determine admission into the Defence Force School of Music in Victoria.https://books.google.com/books?id=70ezTRBX- CcC&pg;=PA75&dq;=Australian+Defence+Force+School+of+Music&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwj49sCHj8PmAhVOWs0KHVCvBGIQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q;=Australian%20Defence%20Force%20School%20of%20Music&f;=false AMEB examinations are based on syllabuses set by the Federal Board in conjunction with the music and speech and drama community.
