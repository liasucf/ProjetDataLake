    "text": "Rachel May is an American academic, university administrator, and politician. She is a member of the New York State Senate, representing the 53rd district since 2019. The district comprises Syracuse, New York and surrounding communities. A Democrat, May defeated incumbent David Valesky in the primary election to first take the seat. == Background == May graduated with an A.B. in Slavic languages and literature from Princeton University in 1978 after completing a 99-page long senior thesis titled \"Leisure Time and Its Functions in the Upbringing of New Soviet Men.\" She was awarded a Marshall Scholarship and graduated from the University of Oxford with a Master of Arts in 1981 before graduating from Stanford University with a Doctor of Philosophy in Slavic languages and Slavic literature in 1990. She taught at Stony Brook University in Stony Brook, New York and Macalaster College in St. Paul, Minnesota as a tenured professor of Russian language and literature. In 2001, she and her husband moved to Syracuse, New York, when her husband became a professor of philosophy at Le Moyne College. After May and her family settled in Syracuse, New York, she graduated from the State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry with a master's degree in environmental communications. She worked as an administrator at Syracuse University for fifteen years, first as the Director of the Office of Environment and Society and later as the Coordinator of Sustainability Education until her election to the New York State Senate. Prior to her election to the Senate, May served on the Onondaga County Board of Zoning Appeals and the Democratic County Committee. She is married with a daughter. == New York Senate == Following the election of Donald Trump, voters became more aware of the Independent Democratic Conference, where state Senators elected as Democrats ultimately caucused with Republicans to provide them with the majority in return for better committee assignments and larger office budgets, among other benefits. Among the members of the IDC was David Valesky, who had represented the district since 2005. In the 2018 elections, May ran for New York State Senate against Valesky in the Democratic primary, making it Valesky's first real challenge since taking office. In a year with strong anti-IDC sentiment, May narrowly defeated Valesky. With the district leaning Democratic, she was elected in November. With Democrats taking the majority in the general election, May is serving as the Chair of Committee on Aging. ==References== ==External links== Category:Living people Category:New York (state) Democrats Category:Syracuse University people Category:New York (state) state senators Category:Princeton University alumni Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Stanford University alumni Category:State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry alumni Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
