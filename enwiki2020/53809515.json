    "text": "Zimbabwe Republic Police High School, also called ZRP High School, is situated in Borrowdale Harare, Zimbabwe. This school was established in 2001 in the Hatcliffe neighborhood of Harare but officially opened its doors to the first batch of students on February 3, 2003. It is privately run by the Zimbabwe Republic Police, thus making it a Private School. The school was set up by the then Commissioner of Police, Augustine Chihuri as a means to curb the inconveniences to children of Police force members when their parents are transferred to a different province. Despite it being built to mainly cater for police force children, it is also open to non-police force members' children. However, school fees is pegged differently for both groups with the latter paying close to double of the former considering their parents contributed towards the construction of the school through deductions from salaries. This is the first and only Zimbabwe Republic Police High School and more so boarding school. On February 3, 2003, the school opened its doors to the first batch of students with just under 100 students being enrolled and all being in Form 1. This was mainly because construction was still on-going and the resources were not yet adequate to cater for a full batch of students. These students had 6 teachers (all who were civilians) with each taking 2 subjects each. Basic infrastructure had been set up and a lot of improvising took place to make sure that the students were properly cared for and received the best education possible. The headmaster was Mr. Rinashe who was coming from St. Augustine's, The deputy being Mr. Muzhanye who was also the History and Geography teacher and Senior Lady being Mrs. Kundeya who was also the English and Shona teacher. The rest of the teaching staff included, Mr Munzverengwi for Computers and Agriculture, Mr. Majilana for Science and Maths and Mr. Muzuwa for Technical Graphics and Principles of Accounts. Later on Mrs. Maguta joined the team and took over in Geography and Shona. Towards the end of that year, a batch for of students were chosen to be prefects who would later become school prefects for the next 4 years till they completed their O Level studies. These included; Keith Tapfuma (Head-boy), Sibo Bero (Head- girl), Nyasha Maruta (Vice Head-boy), Gamuchirai Rinashe (Vice Head-girl), Peshel Muvuti, Tinashe Zimbwa, Vhofholowani Moyo, Brian Hamadziripi, Nomsa Manyevere, Sichelesile Siwela, Patience Munyuki, Nyasha Chirowamhangu and Shingirai Alexander Makina a student from 2004 Class who became the first Police Officer and a Police Dog Handler from ZRP HIGH SCHOOL. 2004 saw the enrollment of a new batch of students thus offering form 1 and form 2 education. With this increase meant staff also need to be increased, therefore more teachers where recruited to accommodate the growing number of classes. This was a process that continued until 2008, which is when it became a full- house with students starting Form 1 up to Form 6. In October 2005, the school was struck by tragedy when the then Headmaster Mr. Rinashe passed on. He was mourned by all as he was a respected and admired gentlemen. He was laid to rest in Chitungwiza. Mr. Muzhanye became Acting Headmaster until, 2006 when Mr. Tarehwa, a former Head at St Ignatius took over. This being a new school, means until 2006 no public examination had been written in the school. 2006, saw the first batch of student, take their Ordinary Level examinations with slightly over 100 candidates registering to write. All the hard work and determination paid off as the school registered a 98% pass rate thus making it the best performing school in Harare and one of the Top in the country. 4 candidates recorded 9 As; Keith Tapfuma (9As and 3Bs), Sichelesile Siwela(9As and 3Bs), Gabriel Simango(9As and 2Bs) and Regina Chigweremba(9As and 3Bs). The 2006 O Level results put the school on the map and to date it is still one of the top performing schools in the country. Due to inadequate equipment, the school had to improvise a lot which saw the first batch of A Level student, particularly in Science suffer a lot. They had to make do with the little that was available for experiments. However, this did not stop the candidates from performing well and saw then record a 92% pass rate during the 2008 A Level examinations making ZRP High School one of the top performing schools in the country, a title which they still proudly hold to date. Apart from academics, the school offers co curricular activities which include Sport and Clubs. One of the most successful has been the debate club which was initiated in 2006 and saw the school win the Harare Nugget Debate Championships with the help of Keith Tapfuma, Regina Chigweremba, Gabriel Simango, Sichelesile Siwela, Yvette Savanhu and Kundai Pasi. Teacher in charge at that time was Mrs. Kundeya. To date the school has been a force to reckon with in the debating spheres and has further produces students who have managed to be part of the junior parliament of Zimbabwe. ==References== Category:High schools in Zimbabwe Category:Schools in Harare Category:Boarding schools in Zimbabwe Category:Educational institutions established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Zimbabwe ",
