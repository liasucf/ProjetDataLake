    "text": "The 2018 Maryland House of Delegates elections were held on November 6, 2018, as part of the biennial United States elections. All 141 of Maryland's state delegates were up for reelection. Prior to the election, there was little doubt that Democrats would hold their majority in the chamber. Maryland's House of Delegates has had a Democratic majority since the elections of 1920, and it remains a solidly Democratic in elections at both the national and state level. Still, there was some discussion about whether or not Republicans would be able to make inroads in the chamber, especially considering that popular incumbent Governor Larry Hogan was running for reelection at the top of the ticket simultaneously. These hopes were not met; though Hogan won his race by double digits, there was very little down-ballot appetite for Republicans, including in the House of Delegates. Democrats picked off eight seats from Republicans, while Republicans flipped one seat from Democrats. The result was a net gain of seven seats for the Democrats, which came from across the state. Six counties had seats flip to the Democrats, including two in Baltimore County. The one seat Republicans did pick up was in a conservative Anne Arundel County district where a retiring incumbent had switched parties from Republican to Democratic the month before the election. Overall, the results were a seen as a disappointment for Republicans, who had hoped Hogan's success would carry more Republicans to Annapolis. After the elections, Democrats held 99 seats to the Republicans' 42, meaning Democrats were in possession of more than 70% of seats in the chamber\u2014enough to capture a two- thirds supermajority capable of overriding gubernatorial vetoes. Many factors contributed to the Democrats' gains, but President Donald Trump's unpopularity in the Old Line State, as well as Maryland's large and growing minority population and its heavily suburban nature, were among the most important. ==Election results== All election results are from the Maryland Board of Elections. ===District 1A=== ===District 1B=== ===District 1C=== ===District 2A=== ===District 2B=== ===District 3A=== ===District 3B=== ===District 4=== ===District 5=== ===District 6=== ===District 7=== ===District 8=== ===District 9A=== ===District 9B=== ===District 10=== ===District 11=== ===District 12=== ===District 13=== ===District 14=== ===District 15=== ===District 16=== ===District 17=== ===District 18=== ===District 19=== ===District 20=== ===District 21=== ===District 22=== ===District 23A=== ===District 23B=== ===District 24=== ===District 25=== ===District 26=== ===District 27A=== ===District 27B=== ===District 27C=== ===District 28=== ===District 29A=== ===District 29B=== ===District 29C=== ===District 30A=== ===District 30B=== ===District 31A=== ===District 31B=== ===District 32=== ===District 33=== ===District 34A=== ===District 34B=== ===District 35A=== ===District 35B=== ===District 36=== ===District 37A=== ===District 37B=== ===District 38A=== ===District 38B=== ===District 38C=== ===District 39=== ===District 40=== ===District 41=== ===District 42A=== ===District 42B=== ===District 43=== ===District 44A=== ===District 44B=== ===District 45=== ===District 46=== ===District 47A=== ===District 47B=== ==References== House of Delegates Maryland House of Delegates ",
