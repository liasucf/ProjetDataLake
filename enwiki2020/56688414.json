Rodrigo da Cunha (1577 \u2013 3 January 1643) was an important Portuguese prelate of the first half of the seventeenth century and who, as Archbishop of Lisbon, played an important role in supporting the restoration of Portuguese independence from Spain.RELA\u00c7\u00c3O de tudo o que passou na felice Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o do mui Alto & mui Poderoso Rei D. JO\u00c3O O QUARTO, nosso Senhor, cuja Monarquia prospere Deos por largos anos.

Rodrigo was born in Lisbon, son of D. Pedro da Cunha, Lord of the Majorat of T\u00e1bua, and his wife Maria da Silva. He began his studies at the College of Saint Anthony the Great (Col\u00e9gio de Santo Ant\u00e3o), a Jesuit college in Lisbon. He received his doctorate in Canon Law at the University of Coimbra. In his religious career, he passed the Holy Office as a deputy, and was an inquisitor in Lisbon. He was Bishop of Portalegre (1615-1618), and of Porto (1618-1626); was Archbishop of Braga (1626-1634) and Lisbon (1635-1642). He authored the reform of the Brevi\u00e1rio Bracarense in 1634, and presided over the Lisbon Synod of 1640. D. Rodrigo da Cunha was one of the main opponents of the incorporation of Portugal in Spain, a policy followed by Philip IV of Spain. In 1638, he was even invited to become a cardinal in Madrid, refusing the offer. During the Portuguese Restoration War, he supported the revolutionaries and, together with the Archbishop of Braga, ruled the kingdom until the return of Jo\u00e3o IV. His name appears as one of the main presences in the \"Act of Accession and Oath of King John IV\" performed on 15 December 1640.Auto do Levantamento e Juramento d' El-Rei Dom Jo\u00e3o IV and as in the following act solemnly confirming it on 28 January 1641.Cronicas e Vidas dos Reys de Portugal..., por Duarte Nunez do Li\u00e3o, e autos de Levantamento e Juramentos a El-Rey D.
