    "text": "Ian Ritchie Redpath (born 11 May 1941, Geelong, Victoria) is a former Australian cricketer who played in 66 Tests and 5 ODIs from 1964 to 1976. Greg Chappell said he was one of only two players he knew who would kill to get into the Australian Test team, the other being Rod Marsh.Greg Chappell, \"Old Hands Showed The Way\", Test Series Official Book 1986\u201387, The Clashes For The Ashes, Australia vs England, Playbill Sport Publication, 1986. ==Career== Educated at Geelong College, Redpath played first-class cricket for Victoria in 92 matches scoring 6,103 runs with a highest score of 261 made in only his tenth first-class innings, scored in February 1962 against a Queensland attack including Wes Hall. He made his test debut on New Year\u2019s Day at Melbourne in the second test of the 1963\u201364 series against South Africa. Opening the batting with Bill Lawry, the pair added 219 before Redpath was bowled on 97. Redpath was the last Australian Test cricketer to play as an amateur. He declined the match fee in his early tests in order not to jeopardise his amateur football career.Lavelle, A. (2008) \"It's My Birthday\", Sunday Age, 11 May 2008 With his lean, gangly body and long neck, Redpath attracted the early nickname \"Gandhi\" among his teammates. However, when some concerns about this were expressed by local fans on the Australian tour of India in 1964\u201365, his colleagues permanently reverted to the simpler \"Redders\". Originally a sweet striker of the ball, Redpath turned into something of a stonewaller, with impressive powers of concentration and a sound technique. He matured late. It would not be until the Sydney test of February 1969 against the West Indies that he reached his maiden test century. In that same series, at Adelaide, he was infamously run out backing up at the bowler's end by Charlie Griffith, without any warning from the bowler. Having broken through with a big score, Redpath flourished and proceeded to score seven Test centuries in the second half of his career, including five in his final 15 Tests, and three in his final test series in 1975\u201376 whilst opening the batting against a vaunted West Indian fast bowling attack featuring Michael Holding and Andy Roberts. It was not until his penultimate test that he struck his first six, advancing down the wicket to loft Lance Gibbs over the fence. Having done so, he promptly hit another six in the same innings. Considered the most correct batsman in the world by Trevor Goddard in 1966\u201367, in his maturity, he was a fine player of spin bowling. ===Vice-captaincy=== He was Australian vice captain to Ian Chappell in 1974\u201375, and to Greg Chappell in 1975\u201376. He was batting when the young Greg Chappell made a century on debut against England in 1970\u201371, who later wrote > My first innings in Test cricket was, as you might expect, a trying > experience, but proved to be one of the best cricket lessons of my career, > thanks to Ian Redpath.

Redpath made his highest Test score of 171 before he was caught and bowled by Ray Illingworth. He and the younger Chappell put on 219 for the sixth wicket. Redpath made 497 runs (49.70) in the series and the England fast bowler John Snow wrote \"I liked bowling to him least of all\" and added that he was \"a real nuisance batsman\".p109, John Snow, Cricket Rebel, Hamlyn, 1976 At Auckland in 1973\u201374, he carried his bat for 159* out of a total of 346 against New Zealand. Redpath shared a first-wicket century stand in Tests with four different partners \u2013 Bill Lawry, Keith Stackpole, Rick McCosker and Alan Turner. Redpath was widely regarded as an affable individual. However, during player payment negotiations in 1974\u201375, despite record takings at the gate, the Australian Cricket Board refused any thought of a player pay rise. When Australian Cricket Board administrator Alan Barnes told a dressing room of Australian cricketers that there were 50,000 others who would be prepared to play for Australia for nothing, the normally mild mannered Redpath reacted. According to Ian Chappell, Redpath grabbed Barnes around the throat and had him up against a wall, saying \"You bloody idiot. Of course there are 500,000 out there who would play for nothing. But how bloody good would the Australian team be?\" Previously, when then captain Bill Lawry drafted a stinging letter to the board critical of the arrangements that players had been forced to endure on the combined tours of India and South Africa in 1969\u201370, Redpath proposed that all the players should sign it. Lawry demurred, signing it only in his own name. This sealed the fate of Lawry\u2019s career. Redpath was one of the few to survive that disastrous tour of South Africa with a reputation intact, averaging 47.17 in the four Tests. During an innings on tour of 152 against Orange Free State at Bloemfontein, he scored 32 runs off a six-ball over, which remains a record for any Australian in first class cricket. An outstanding fieldsman in the slips or at short leg, Redpath took 83 Test catches. His bowling was undistinguished; he was once called for throwing against Glamorgan in 1964. ===World Series Cricket=== Redpath retired from Test cricket in order to devote himself full-time to proprietorship of an antique business in Geelong. He had already declined the 1975 Ashes tour to tend to this neglected enterprise. However his absence from top cricket was brief. After a season out of the game, he signed for World Series Cricket, lured by a personal visit to Geelong by Kerry Packer\u2019s lieutenant Austin Robertson, and despite Packer\u2019s initial reluctance to contract the Victorian. As with many of his colleagues, the personal costs of supporting the rebel entrepreneur were significant; after two decades of service to the South Melbourne Cricket Club, Redpath was made persona non grata. In an early world series match at Kardinia Park, Geelong in 1977\u201378, Redpath snapped his Achilles tendon, an injury that ruled him out for the season. Packer declared that Redpath would be paid for the duration. The Victorian repaid the loyalty by returning again for 1978\u201379, playing mainly in World Series country cup games. He was recalled for international duties once more, playing two supertests at the age of 37. At Sydney, against the by then fearsome West Indies XI attack, he took blow after blow on the body, holding out for 143 minutes to make 9, and adding 71 critical runs with David Hookes which contributed to an improbable 10 wicket victory for the Australian XI. He remains among Victoria's top ten run-makers of all time. Years after his WSC days, Redpath was accepted back into the Victorian fold and appointed as the coach of Victoria. ==Later life== He was awarded an MBE in 1975. He wrote his cricketing memoirs, Always Reddy, with Neill Phillipson in 1976. After retiring from playing, he coached Victoria. He is now retired from the antique business, but remains active at the Geelong Cricket Club. ==References== ==External links== * *Victorian Premier Cricket Legends Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Australia One Day International cricketers Category:Australia Test cricketers Category:Australian cricket coaches Category:Sportspeople from Geelong Category:South Melbourne cricketers Category:Victoria cricketers Category:World Series Cricket players Category:People educated at Geelong College Category:Australian cricketers Category:Cricketers from Victoria (Australia) ",
