    "text": "Leo D. Stoller (born June 5, 1946) is an American self-styled \"intellectual property entrepreneur\" based in suburban Chicago, Illinois. Stoller claimed rights to a large inventory of well-known trademarks and engaged in the assertive enforcement of those alleged trademark rights, threatening infringement action against people and companies who attempt to use similar marks. Though he managed to obtain license payments in some circumstances through demand letters, Stoller lost some key challenges in federal court, and was sanctioned by United States regulators for filing thousands of motions. A federal court labeled Stoller and his companies as \"vexatious litigants\" in 2005, and his bankruptcy filing from that year was converted to a liquidation in 2006 after the judge found Stoller's filing to have been made in bad faith. On August 8, 2007, the bankruptcy court approved the sale of Stoller's trademark assets to the Society for the Prevention of Trademark Abuse, LLC.In re Leo Stoller, Debtor, no. 05-B-64075 (N.D. Ill., Aug. 8, 2007); Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Order Approving Sales of Debtor's Assets ==Background== Stoller's companies included Rentamark.com, Stealth Industries Inc., S Industries Inc., Sentra Sporting Goods U.S.A., and Central Manufacturing Company. Through these companies, Stoller has registered trademarks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for over 25 years including Stealth, Sentra, Dark Star, Air Frame, Triana, Stradivarius, Havoc, Chestnut, Trillium, White Line Fever, Fire Power, Love Your Body, and many others. Stoller has filed oppositions to others' trademark applications with the USPTO Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) numerous times, and filed applications for extension of the deadline to file such oppositions even more times. Stoller claims a number of large and small companies have resolved trademark controversies. When approaching infringers, Stoller is reported to document his claims with copies of letters which demonstrate capitulation with his demands. Such letters are said to be from companies such as K-Mart, and often marked \"Confidential\". A list of thousands of proceedings involving Leo Stoller and his companies (Stealth Industries, Inc., Leo Stoller Stealth Industries Inc., Leo Stoller Central Mfg. Co, Central Mfg. Co., Central Mfg. Inc., Sentra Industries Inc.) can be found in the USPTO site.http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Stealth%20Industries,%20Inc. http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=CENTRAL%20MFG.%20INC.http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Sentra%20Industries%20INC.

See Exhibit 54 in the Schmetterer opinion. Twelve charities Stoller listed said they never received any money from Stoller, despite assurances on the site that \"100 percent of all donations\" would be forwarded. He was accused of not being a licensed charitable organization and listing charities without their permission. Benjamin Steverman (August 1, 2002).

Medill News Service Stoller paid a $2,000 fine and was barred from soliciting for charities in Illinois, but made no admission of wrongdoing. ===Trademark litigation=== ====S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000==== In 1996 S Industries, Inc. filed suit alleging that Centra 2000, a producer of data management software, infringed its/Stoller's \"Sentra\" trademark in violation of the Lanham Act. District Judge George W. Lindberg ruled in favor of Centra 2000, finding that S Industries did not hold a federal registration for the \"Sentra\" mark for use on computer hardware or software. Because S Industries' claims were, in the judge's view, completely unfounded and because its procedural maneuvering multiplied the cost of defending against the suit, Centra 2000 was awarded attorney's fees in July 1998.S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000, Inc. Case No. 96 C 3524 This was affirmed on appeal.S Industries, Inc. v. Centra 2000, Inc.

Brett==== A case decided by summary judgment on September 30, 2005, Central Manufacturing Co. v. Brett, Central Mfg Co. v. Brett (No. 1:04-cv-03049 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 30, 2005)) pitted a Stoller-owned company against Hall-of-Fame baseball player George Brett, whose company, Brett Brothers Sports International Inc., sells a bat under the name \"Stealth\". It was alleged in this case that the use of that name infringed upon Stoller's trademark rights. In its decision, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois determined that there was no likelihood of confusion where consumers would mistakenly regard Brett's bats as being from Stoller's company. The court also found that Stoller failed to provide adequate proof that his company and its licensees had even sold baseball-related merchandise at all. The court found likelihood of confusion in the opposite direction, found Brett's trademark rights to be senior, and hence canceled Stoller's (Central Manufacturing) registration. In the decision, the court described Stoller's tactics and enumerated dozens of unsuccessful infringement cases he had brought in that court. Chief Judge Charles P. Kocoras from the Northern District of Illinois then issued a citation to Stoller after reviewing his \"filing history\" having filed at least \"49 lawsuits in this court, individually or through one of his many wholly owned corporations\". \"The Executive Committee (of the Northern District of Illinois) in its capacity as the supervisor of the assignment of cases, has directed that Leo Stoller inform this court of any claim by him why the Executive Committee should not impose reasonable and necessary restraints upon Mr. Stoller's ability to file civil cases in this District.\" After a thorough review of Leo Stoller's entire filing history the Executive Committee of the Northern District of Illinois issued a decision stating that \"the committee will take no further action in this matter.\" On July 9, 2007, in an opinion that opened with a laudatory description of the George Brett \"Pine Tar Incident\", the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's judgment, including the order for Stoller to pay Brett's attorney fees.https://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/circs/7th/062083p.pdf ====Central Mfg. Co. v. Pure Fishing, Inc.==== Stoller and the \"Central Mfg. Co. (a Delaware corporation)\" sued a fishing tackle company, Pure Fishing, Inc. in February 2005 in Illinois for selling Spiderwire Stealth fishing line.Central Mfg. Co. v. Pure Fishing, Inc., No. 05 C 00725 (N.D. Ill.) Pure Fishing denied infringement and counterclaimed alleging that Stoller's trademark business violated various state and federal laws against unfair business practices. Pure Fishing also acquired and asserted in another counterclaim (piercing the corporate veil and continuation of business theories) the unsatisfied 1998 sanction judgment that had been awarded to Centra 2000 against Stoller's S Industries, Inc. Pure Fishing also showed that Stoller had signed his attorney's name to pleadings that were filed with the court.Notice of Appearance for the corporate entities and a court-ordered Rule 11 certification as to the accuracy of facts in a Second Amended Complaint Stoller's case was dismissed with prejudice and default judgments entered against all corporate defendants for lack of prosecution and against Stoller as a sanction under Rule 11. During Stoller's 2006 bankruptcy proceedings (see below), Pure Fishing went back to the district court for entry of a Final Judgment. On October 4, 2006, a federal court in Chicago entered final judgment in Central Mfg. Co., et al. v. Pure Fishing, Inc., et al. The Court declared the case to be \"exceptional\" under 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1117(a) and ordered Central Mfg. to pay Pure Fishing\u2019s costs, charges and disbursements, including a reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred in the action. The court further ordered that Stoller and his companies were \"vexatious litigants\" and barred them \"from instituting any lawsuit or trademark opposition without prior leave of this Court pursuant to this Court\u2019s authority under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651(a).\" The court also cancelled the marks asserted in the Complaint. Stoller filed a Notice of Appeal from the October 4 judgment and has moved to stay the enforcement of the said judgment pending the appeals. On December 12, 2006, the Court entered judgment in favor of Pure Fishing, Inc. in the total amount of $969,751.81. Press release (December 14, 2006).

In 2006, Stoller filed an opposition to Google's attempt at registering a trademark to the name \"Google\" in the category of exercise balls. Stoller claims that the \"Google\" mark has become generic, yet also claims that it infringes on prior alleged rights to the name held by Stoller's company. The case against the Google mark, however, was dismissed with prejudice at the instigation of Stoller's trustee in bankruptcy, who is empowered to take action in all cases in which Stoller and his companies are involved. Subsequently, on January 19, 2007, Google filed a suit against Stoller's companies alleging violations of the anti-racketeering RICO law.http://www.roylance.com/Uploads/CentralMfgCo/Complaint%20FILED.pdf On April 2, 2008 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed a judgment in favor of Google, on the ground that the case had been pursued using contradictory principles, both treating those companies as extensions of Stoller himself, and as separate legal entities. The case was remanded to the lower court for further action. The court noted, however, that Stoller remained subject to an order \"directing that all federal courts in [the Seventh Circuit] return unfiled any papers he submits directly or indirectly unless and until he pays a $10,000 fine we imposed against him in August 2007,\" and \"he will have to pay the outstanding sanction or, as a practical matter, face certain default.\" Google, Inc. v.
