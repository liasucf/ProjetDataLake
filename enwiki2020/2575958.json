    "text": "Esther Szekeres (; 20 February 191028 August 2005) was a Hungarian\u2013Australian mathematician. ==Biography== Esther Klein was born to Ignaz Klein in a Jewish family in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary in 1910. As a young physics student in Budapest, Klein was a member of a group of Hungarians including Paul Erd\u0151s, George Szekeres and P\u00e1l Tur\u00e1n that convened over interesting mathematical problems. In 1933, Klein proposed to the group a combinatorial problem that Erd\u0151s named as the Happy Ending problem as it led to her marriage to George Szekeres in 1937, with whom she had two children. Following the outbreak of World War II, Esther and George Szekeres emigrated to Australia after spending several years in Hongkew, a community of refugees located in Shanghai, China. In Australia, they originally shared an apartment in Adelaide with M\u00e1rta Sv\u00e9d, an old school friend of Szekeres, before moving to Sydney in 1964. In Sydney, Esther lectured at Macquarie University and was actively involved in mathematics enrichment for high-school students. In 1984, she jointly founded a weekly mathematics enrichment meeting that has since expanded into a programme of about 30 groups that continue to meet weekly and inspire high school students throughout Australia and New Zealand. In 2004, she and George moved back to Adelaide, where, on 28 August 2005, she and her husband died within an hour of each other. ==Recognition== In 1990, Macquarie gave Szekeres an honorary doctorate. In 1993, she won the BH Neumann Award of the Australian Mathematics Trust. ==References== Category:1910 births Category:2005 deaths Category:20th-century Hungarian mathematicians Category:Australian mathematicians Category:Hungarian Jews Category:Macquarie University faculty Category:Mathematicians from Budapest Category:People from Sydney Category:20th-century women mathematicians ",
