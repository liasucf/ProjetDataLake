    "text": "Selenium monochloride is an inorganic compound with the formula Se2Cl2. Although it is called selenium monochloride, a more descriptive name might be diselenium dichloride. It is a reddish-brown, oily liquid that hydrolyses slowly. It exists in chemical equilibrium with SeCl2, SeCl4, chlorine, and elemental selenium. Selenium monochloride is mainly used as a reagent for the synthesis of Se-containing compounds. ==Structure and properties== Selenium monochloride has the connectivity Cl-Se-Se-Cl. With a nonplanar structure, it has C2 molecular symmetry, similar to hydrogen peroxide and sulfur monochloride. The Se-Se bond length is 2.23 \u00c5, and the Se-Cl bond lengths are 2.20 \u00c5. The dihedral angle is 87\u00b0. ==Preparation== Selenium monochloride was originally produced by the chlorination of selenium. An improved method involves the reaction of a mixture of selenium, selenium dioxide, and hydrochloric acid:Feh\u00e9r, F. \"Diselenium Dichloride\". In Handbook of Preparative Inorganic Chemistry; Brauer, G., Ed.; Academic Press: New York, 1963; Vol. 1; p 422-433. :3 Se + SeO2 \\+ 4 HCl \u2192 2 Se2Cl2 \\+ H2O A dense layer of selenium monochloride settles from the reaction mixture, which can be purified by dissolving it in fuming sulfuric acid and reprecipitating it with hydrochloric acid. A second method for the synthesis involves the reaction of selenium with oleum and hydrochloric acid: :2 Se + 2 SO3 \\+ 3 HCl \u2192 Se2Cl2 \\+ H2SO3 \\+ SO2(OH)Cl The crude selenium monochloride product is collected via distillation. In acetonitrile solutions, it exists in equilibrium with SeCl2 and SeCl4. Selenium dichloride degrades to the monochloride after a few minutes at room temperature: :3 SeCl2 \u2192 Se2Cl2 \\+ SeCl4 ==Reactions== Selenium monochloride is an electrophilic selenizing agent, and thus it reacts with simple alkenes to give bis(\u03b2-chloroalkyl)selenide and bis(chloroalkyl)selenium dichloride. It converts hydrazones of hindered ketones into the corresponding selenoketones, the structural analogs of ketones whereby the oxygen atom is replaced with a selenium atom. Finally, the compound has been used to introduce bridging selenium ligands between the metal atoms of some iron and chromium carbonyl complexes. ==References== Category:Selenium compounds Category:Chlorides Category:Nonmetal halides Category:Chalcohalides ",
