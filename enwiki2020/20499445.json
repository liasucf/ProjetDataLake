Chiautla de Tapia, Puebla, 20 July 1892 - 4 July 1995) was a Mexican career diplomat and before that a militant in the Mexican Revolution and a leftist legislator. As a consul in Marseille, Vichy France, BosquesA note on the spelling of the second surname. Under Hispanic cultural tradition, a person's second surname, when they use one, is that of their mother. Etymologically, the surname Sald\u00edvar is Zald\u00edvar. In Hispanic America, it occasionally happens that the 'z' in the spelling of a surname is replaced with 's'. took initiative to rescue tens of thousands of Jews and Spanish Republican exiles from being deported to Nazi Germany or Spain, but his heroism remained unknown to the world at large for some sixty years, until several years after his death at the age of 102 (not 103, as sometimes reported). For about two decades after World War II, Bosques served as Mexico's ambassador to several countries. Since 2003, international recognition has been accruing to him. In 1944, he described his efforts thus: \"I followed the policy of my country, of material and moral support to the heroic defenders of the Spanish Republic, the stalwart paladins of the struggle against Hitler, Mussolini, Franco, Petain, and Laval.\"Turismo Puebla Web site In 2010, a documentary film about him was produced in Mexico, directed by Lillian Lieberman, titled Visa al para\u00edso (Visa to Paradise). ==Early years== Gilberto Bosques Sald\u00edvar was born in Chiautla, a mountain village in southern portion of the state of Puebla, southeast of Mexico City. At the age of 17, he took up arms in the Mexican Revolution under the command of Aquiles Serd\u00e1n Alatriste, the first martyr of the Revolution. Bosques organized the First National Pedagogy Congress (Primer Congreso Nacional Pedag\u00f3gico), and worked as a journalist with several newspapers and publications. He went on to serve as a state legislator in Puebla and as a federal deputy on two occasions: 1922-1923 and again in 1934-1937. In the latter period, he belonged to a bloc of legislators supporting the new president, general L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas (from 1934 to 1940).Gonz\u00e1lez Mar\u00edn 2006:127 He was the President of the Chamber of Deputies in 1935. In 1938, he was the director of the government owned newspaper, El Nacional. ==Mexican Consul in France during World War II== Bosques was stationed in France from 1939\u20131943, coinciding with most of World War II, initially as Mexico's Consul General. Fleeing the German occupation of Paris in May 1940, Bosques was instructed by his government to organize a consulate to represent Mexico in Vichy France, which he set up in Marseille. Once Nazi Germany had occupied France and entrusted much of the governance of the country to Vichy France, he directed consular employees to issue a visa to anybody wanting to flee to Mexico. Under his auspices, visas were issued to approximately 40,000 people, mostly Jews and Spaniards. The Spaniards rescued were refugees from Francoist Spain after the conclusion of the Spanish Civil War in April 1939. Bosques rented a castle and a summer holiday camp in Marseilles to house refugees under the protection of what he maintained was Mexican territory under International Law.Grabman, Bosques War, pp. 15-19 Bosques' courageous initiatives and actions mirror those of two other consuls placed in similar situations in war-torn Europe, i.e. the Portuguese Aristides de Sousa Mendes in Bordeaux and the Japanese Chiune Sugihara in Kaunas. In 1943, Bosques, his family (wife and three children), and 40 consular staff members were arrested by the Gestapo and detained in Germany for a year. He was released under an agreement between the German and Mexican governments after Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho (then President of Mexico from 1940 to 1946) made an exchange of prisoners with imprisoned German citizens.\"Gilberto Bosques Biography\" http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/saviors/diplomats/bosques/gilberto-bosques- biography.801.htm ==Post-World War II== In the decades after his release from German captivity, he served as Ambassador of Mexico in Portugal, Finland, Sweden and Cuba. In 1962, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, Bosques \u2014 who was both a personal friend of Fidel Castro and the diplomatic representative of a neutral country trusted by the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba, worked to facilitate communications between the disputants and bring Cuba into agreement with the \"face-saving\" agreements worked out between the two nuclear powers.Grabman, Bosques' war, p. 36 Bosques Sald\u00edvar died just days short of his 103rd birthday. Bosques's feat in saving nearly 40,000 people from execution by the Third Reich or Francoist Spain went unrecognized even among specialists in the history of rescuers of Jews until after 2000, and especially the year 2008. At an award ceremony held in Beverly Hills, California, on 13 November 2008, the United States organization, the Anti- Defamation League (ADL) gave him the Courage to Care Award, created in 1987 to honor rescuers of Jews during the Holocaust Era. But this was not the first major posthumous recognition given to him. He was memorialized in Vienna on 4 June 2003 by having a street in the 22nd district named after him: the Gilberto-Bosques-Promenade.
