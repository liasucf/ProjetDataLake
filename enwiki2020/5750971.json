    "text": "The Grand Valley State Lakers football team represents Grand Valley State University (GVSU) in NCAA Division II football. The team currently competes in the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference and was once affiliated with the now defunct Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference. The Lakers football team has appeared in six NCAA Division II national title games, winning four championships, since 2001. The team has made the playoffs in 20 seasons. They have also won or shared 17 conference titles (GLIAC & MIFC). Since the start of the football program in 1970, the team has an overall winning percentage of .730 (409\u2013150\u20133) which places the program as the highest in NCAA D2 and among the highest regardless of division. The Lakers all time home record is 219\u201346\u20131. Grand Valley has played its home field games at Lubbers Stadium since 1973. The stadium has undergone numerous renovations and expansions in recent years to accommodate the overflow crowds that regularly exceed the stadium's 10,444 seat capacity. ==Early History== ===1970s=== Grand Valley State College, as it was known at the time, launched its football program with a junior varsity schedule in 1970 and became a varsity sport in 1971. Robert \"Rip\" Collins, a successful high school coach at Grand Rapids Ottawa Hills High School, became the program's first head coach. In their first two seasons, the Lakers did not even have a home field or stadium to host games. They played the third game of their inaugural season at Soldier Field versus University of Illinois-Chicago Circle. The Lakers lost the game 27\u20137. Success didn't come quickly for the Lakers as it took almost three years for them to win their first football game. Coach Collins was unable to get the program off to a successful start after going 0\u201313 and being outscored 534\u201358 in 1971 and 1972. E. James Harkema took over as head coach in January 1973, coming to GVSU from Northern Illinois where he was an offensive backfield coach. Also awaiting Harkema was a brand new football field constructed in 1972 which featured the first \"Prescription Athletic Turf\" (PAT) football playing surface in the country. 1974 marked the first conference play for Grand Valley with the forming of the Great Lakes Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. GVSU went 6\u20133 and finished third in that inaugural year. Offensive guard Ron Stallard became the second individual Laker honored as he was awarded NAIA AAHM status at the end of the season. 1976 would be the year Grand Valley would receive national attention. The game that put Grand Valley on the map was the season finale against Northern Michigan University. The Wildcats came into Allendale as the defending NCAA Division II National Champions, boasting an 18-game winning streak, ranked No. 1 in Division II and fresh off an 82\u20137 win over University of Nebraska-Omaha. And, as they were the team which ended the Lakers chances from going to the NAIA National Playoffs the year prior. GVSU was seeking some payback on their home field. The Lakers, playing 21 seniors built up a 24\u20130 lead and went on to shock the Wildcats 31\u201314 before a large crowd, which included many top recruits. Winning this game allowed Grand Valley to sign many top All-State players which started the program's push to national attention. Harkema had traditionally built his teams on defense and a solid running game, but in 1977 with the transfer of quarterback Roy Gonzalez from the University of Wyoming, a solid offensive line and using many talented freshmen, Harkema went to the air and won their first ever Great Lakes Conference Championships, ultimately winning three in the next five years. The 1977 team went 7\u20133 and had one NAIA All-American, offensive tackle Gary Evans and eight NAIA AAHM athletes: Roy Gonzalez-QB, Daryl Gooden-DT, Mack Lofton-DE, Tim Maki-LB, Roger McCoy-PK, Clint Nash-WR, Joe Pollard-S and Rusty Steffens-OG. Gonzalez was followed by quarterbacks David Quinley, Steve Michuta and Jeff Lynch, who gave GVSU the most feared passing attack in the Grand Lakes Conference. They had been blessed with talented receivers like Clint Nash, Rick Cunningham, Michael Woods, Rob Rubick, Jeff Chadwick and Bill Luckstead as the Lakers averaged seven wins a year from 1977 to 1982. In 1978, with Quinley at the controls, the Lakers suffered early losses to Northern Michigan and Bowling Green State, but bounced back to win eight straight games including a repeat of the GLIAC title and an NAIA Playoff victory over University of Wisconsin\u2013La Crosse. The team ultimately lost to Elon College in the NAIA Semi-Finals on a wet, muddy field in North Carolina. The team finished 9\u20133 and secured the winningest season in school history at the time. The team celebrated two NAIA All-Americans in Bob Beaudrie-C and Joe Pollard-DB and four AAHM, Wade Bent-LB, Ron Essink-OT, Roger McCoy-PK and Rick VanEss-FB. This was the highlight of the first decade of football for Grand Valley State. Two players that stood out and won individual national honors: All-American Ron Essink-OT (NCAA DII/NAIA/Kodak) who went on to have an outstanding career in the NFL as a starting tackle with the Seattle Seahawks, and NAIA AAHM Mark Szczytko-DT. 1979 also saw the completion and dedication of the new stadium and track complex named after its president, Arend D. Lubbers, on September 15. The stadium was built around the existing PAT field and had permanent seating for 4,146 fans. The team had one of its few losing seasons, finishing with a 4\u20135 record. ===1980s=== Coach Harkema quickly got the Lakers back to their winning ways finishing the 1980\u201382 seasons with records of 7\u20132, 7\u20133, & 7\u20132 respectively. Harkema resigned in November 1982 to accept the head coaching job at Eastern Michigan. He was replaced by Ball State assistant Bob Giesey. Under Giesey in 1983, the Lakers were 4\u20134 entering their last two games of the season. The team lost its final two games by two points, 31\u201330 to Northwood and 15\u201314 to Saginaw Valley to finish 4\u20136. The roof caved in the following year and GV went 0\u201310 and managed only 99 points for the season. Giesey resigned. Athletic Director Dr. George MacDonald hired Tom Beck away from his assistant coaching job with Chicago Blitz of the United States Football League. Beck had previously turned losing programs at Illinois Benedictine and Elmhurst College, into winners. It took Beck three games to get the Lakers back on track in 1985. Faced with a 14-game losing streak, Beck made some key personnel changes. Beck installed Guy Schuler at quarterback and moved wide receiver Ray Buckner to tailback, linebacker Sylvester Johnson to fullback, and defensive tackle Brian Mulcahy to middle linebacker. The Lakers went out and defeated Evansville 28\u201314 and finished the year 6\u20135. The next five years would see explosive offenses, outstanding players and solid coaching which would result in trips to the NCAA Division II playoffs, as well as the Lakers becoming a fixture in preseason and postseason rankings. Beck's 1986 team posted a 9\u20132 record, In 1987, Beck hired a 25-year-old by the name of Brian Kelly as a graduate assistant and defensive backs coach, a move that would positively impact Lakers football for the next 17 seasons. After a pair of 7\u20134 seasons in 1987 and 1988, Beck coached the Lakers to their first undefeated regular season with an 11\u20130 record and the final Great Lakes Conference Championship in 1989. Four players obtained national honors: Mark Prins, OT was both AP and Football News AAHM in \"87\" and Football News AA in \"88\"; while Guy Schuler again was named AP AAHM and Frank Miotke was a Football News AAHM for his first time. GV led Division II in total offense, averaging 480.9 yards per game and also in points with 44.5. One of the highlights of the 1989 season was GVSU's record breaking 91\u20130 victory over Valparaiso. The Lakers jumped out to a 56\u20130 halftime lead as they rolled up 731 yards in total offense. Freshman kicker Miguel Sagaro from Spain set a Division II record when he connected on 65 of 66 extra points for the season and sophomore fullback Eric Lynch scored 21 touchdowns. Lynch went on to begin an outstanding career with the Detroit Lions. Grand Valley finished third in the final 1989 Division II poll and earned the first of three consecutive playoff berths, losing to Indiana, PA, 34\u201324 on a frigid November afternoon highlighted by 11 inches of snow on the ground. ==1990s== In 1990, Grand Valley, along with GLIAC members Ferris State, Hillsdale, Northern Michigan, Saginaw Valley and Wayne State, joined forces with the schools from the Heartland Conference which included Ashland University, Butler, University of Indianapolis, St Joseph's College and Valparaiso to form the Midwest Intercollegiate Football Conference (MIFC). The Lakers continued their winning ways, posting a 22-game regular season winning streak before falling at Hillsdale, 38\u201334. GV won the inaugural MIFC crown, finished with a 10\u20132 record and lost to East Texas State, 20\u201314 in the playoffs. That 1990 season saw five Lakers win national recognition: Chris Tiede, OC \u2013 AA Football Gazette; Jim Cramer, DT \u2013 AA Football Gazette; Eric Lynch, FB \u2013 AA Football Gazette; Mike Flannery, CB \u2013 AA Football Gazette and Charles Sippial, LB \u2013 AA Football Gazette. The 1991 team had eight players earn national awards at the conclusion of the season with five AA and three AAHM. Chris Tiede and Eric Lynch earned AA honors for the second year \u2013 Tiede from the AP, Football Gazette & Kodak \u2013 Lynch from the Football Gazette; Todd Wood, DB \u2013 AA (GTE/COSIDA); Mark Smith, OT \u2013 AA (GTE/COSIDA); Jim Cramer, DT \u2013 AA Football Gazette; Jack Hull, QB \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette; Bill McGory, OG \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette and Bob Michell, TE \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette. Grand Valley shared its second MIFC crown with Butler, Ferris and Hillsdale in 1992 with an 8\u20133 record. The 1993 season saw the Lakers slide a bit posting a 6\u20133\u20132 record with key losses to Indiana (PA), Ashland and Hillsdale. Kelly and the Lakers bounced back in 1994 with a return trip to the playoffs and finished with an 8\u20134 record and a first round playoff loss. They started and ended that 1994 season with losses to Indiana(PA), regular season opener and first round of playoffs. The Lakers then posted back-to-back 8\u20133 seasons in \"95\" and \"96\", finishing second in the MIFC both years, but no playoff games either season. They again started each season with games against non-conference national competition but both ended in losses \u2013 \"95\"-Indiana(PA) and \"96\"-SW Texas State. Multiple Lakers over those years earned All-American or AAHM status. 1992 \u2013 Miguel Sagaro, PK \u2013 AA Football Gazette; Jamarl Eiland, FB \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette; Jorgen Gustafsson, OT \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette; Brian Tazic, QB \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette. 1993 \u2013 Hardie Farr, SS \u2013 AA (CM Frank/AP); Youssef Sareini, WR \u2013 AA Football Gazette; Jorgen Gustafsson, OT \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette; Dan McLean, CB \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette; Mike Sheldon, OG \u2013 AAHM Football Gazette; 1994 \u2013 saw two repeats \u2013 Mike Sheldon, AA (AFCA/CM Frank/Football Gazette) and Youssef Sareini, AAHM (CM Frank/Football Gazette);Darnell Jamison, FB \u2013 AAHM CM Frank; Kwame McKinnon, QB \u2013 AAHM CM Frank and Tim Postema, LB \u2013 AAHM CM Frank. 1995 \u2013 Four players were awarded AAHM for a second year they were Darrell Jamison, Kwame McKinnon Tim Postema and Rich Hurley, OL \u2013 AA CM Frank; Kevin Gee, OL \u2013 AA CM Frank; Matt Potter, DL \u2013 AAHM CM Frank; Paul Siembida, DB \u2013 AAHM CM Frank and the most honored from this class was Diriki Mose, WR \u2013 AA (AFCA/Football Gazette/CM Frank/CoSIDA/Daktronics). 1996 \u2013 saw one player win multiple All-American awards after earning AAHM honors the year before \u2013 Matt Potter, AA (AFCA/Football Gazette/AP/CoSIDA/Daktronics) while Doug Kochanski, PK earned AAHM honors from the Football Gazette. Quarterback Jeff Fox led the Lakers to their second straight MIFC title and back into the playoffs in 1998 with a 9\u20131 conference mark. They again lost to UC Davis (38\u201340) finishing the regular season 9\u20132 overall. Fox became Grand Valley State's first-ever Harlon Hill Trophy Finalist (Division II Heisman) as he rewrote the GVSU single-season and career offensive record books. The Laker season was ended by Slippery Rock, again in the first round of the playoffs, 37\u201314. Jeff Fox was awarded AA status from CoSIDA/Daktronics/Football Gazette as did Billy Cook, Spcl Teams \u2013 AA Football Gazette. ==2000s== Grand Valley Football entered its most successful period during the 2000s (decade). === 2000 === The year 2000 saw the Lakers start their season slowly losing their first three games to South Dakota State, Saginaw Valley State and Northwood. But this sophomore-dominated team regrouped and finished by winning 7 of 8 remaining games, posting a 7\u20134 record. === 2001 === In 2001, the dividends of valuable experience in the young players showed as the Lakers not only won their first ever Division II playoff game, but advanced to the 2001 National Championship. Behind a potent offensive attack, Grand Valley State posted a perfect 10\u20130 regular season (September 11, 2001 game was canceled) with an average of 58.4 points per game and 48.0 points average margin of victory. GVSU's march to the championship game was not easy, however, as GLIAC Player of the Year quarterback and Harlon Hill Runner-Up Curt Anes, was injured in the Lakers' first playoff game.http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/grva/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/08fbhistory.pdf Grand Valley responded with a first round 42\u201314 victory over Bloomsburg, a 33\u201330 second round win over Saginaw Valley State, and a semi-final win over Catawba College, 34\u201316. One of the backup quarterbacks used during this run was actually a wide receiver brought in to run an option style offense when the other young backup ran into difficulty. In the championship game against North Dakota, the Lakers took a 14\u201310 lead with 2:46 left in the game, but the Fighting Sioux responded with a last minute drive of their own to take the title, 17\u201314.Bob Johnson, USA Today, \"North Dakota tops Grand Valley State for D-II title,\" December 8, 2001. QB Curt Anes set the Division II record for passing efficiency in 2002 (min. 15 attempts per game) with a 221.6 rating (271 attempts, 189 completions, 3 interceptions, 3,086 yards, 48 touchdown passes). === 2002 === A football signed by the 2002 NCAA Division II Champion Grand Valley State Lakers football team The Lakers opened at home against a tough non-conference opponent, California-Davis (which was in its last year of Division II competition) and won 24\u201314. The Lakers went on to defeat three ranked teams en route to the undefeated season. The playoffs began with a convincing 62\u201313 win over Long Island University-C.W. Post. Then came a matchup against longtime nemesis Indiana University of Pennsylvania. GVSU entered the game 0\u20136 against the Indians all-time, however, the Lakers scored on their first eight possessions in the first half and built a 50\u20137 halftime lead. The Lakers cruised to a 62\u201321 win and advanced to the NCAA DII Semifinals. Grand Valley State again jumped out to an early lead and never looked back with an impressive 44\u20137 victory over Northern Colorado (also in its last year of Division II competition). The win advanced GVSU to the NCAA DII National Championship game for the second straight year. The top-ranked Lakers squared off against second-ranked Valdosta State. GVSU led 17\u20136 at the half and 24\u20136 midway through the fourth quarter. However, VSU scored 18 unanswered points to tie the game with just over three minutes remaining. Curt Anes, who won the Harlon Hill Trophy as the D-II Player of the Year less than 24 hours earlier, utilized his All-American receiver David Kircus to drive the Lakers 68 yards in 2:05 for a touchdown to give GVSU the 2002 NCAA DII National Championship. Anes hit Kircus on a 10-yard pass for the winning score, finishing the season with a perfect 14\u20130 record, and was also ranked No. 1 in the AFCA poll each week of the 2002 season. The 2002 team had twelve players earn post season national honors, four of which were repeat winners \u2013 Curt Anes \u2013 Harlon Hill Award, All-American (AFCA/D2Football/Daktronics/Football Gazette), GLIAC Player of the Year; David Kircus \u2013 All-American (AFCA/AP/D2Football/Football Gazette/Daktronics); Dale Westrick \u2013 All-American (D2Football/Football Gazette/Daktronics) and Dan Vaughn \u2013 All-American (Football Gazette/AP/D2Football) others include; Keyonta Marshall, DT \u2013 All-American (Football Gazette/D2Football/Daktronics); Scott Mackey, DB \u2013 All-American (Football Gazette/AP/D2Football/Daktronics); Reggie Spearman, RB \u2013 All-American (Football Gazette/D2Football/Daktronics); Anthony Burlison, LB \u2013 All-American (Football Gazette/Daktronics); Phil Condon, TE \u2013 All-American (D2Football); Terrance Banks, WR \u2013 All-American (Football Gazette) and Tom Hosford, OC \u2013 All-American Honorable Mention (Football Gazette). Dan Torres receives Special Player of the Year award with 8 carries and 8 fumbles to his name. === 2003 === Following 2002, the 2003 motto was \"Tradition Never Graduates.\"http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/grva/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/ucd-2003.pdf Gone from the 2002 team were 25 seniors that concluded their careers with back-to-back appearances in the NCAA D-II Championship game. The 2003 campaign started with a road win over perennial power and now Division I-AA, UC-Davis. GVSU limited the high-powered offense of the Aggies to just two field goals, while GVSU's All-American kicker David Hendrix, booted three field goals, the final one coming in overtime. The defense did the job the following week as well as they scored two touchdowns en route to a 40\u201310 victory over rival Ferris State. Additional wins built GVSU's winning streak to 20 games and their conference streak to 29 games. A date with fourth-ranked Saginaw Valley State was next on the ledger. A GVSU and GLIAC record crowd of 12,832 attended the anticipated contest at Lubbers Stadium in Allendale. After suffering a concussion (which was not discovered until later), GVSU starting quarterback Freshman Cullen Finnerty had several turnovers and miscues in the second half. The Cardinals capitalized to claim a 34\u201320 victory. GVSU regrouped and notched a 33\u201314 victory at Northwood to build momentum toward another playoff run. However this playoff run had to be done on the road as GV entered the playoffs seeded third in the Northeast Region. The Lakers opened with a 65\u201336 win at Bentley College that set up a rematch with SVSU in the Regional Final. The game was a defensive struggle as neither offense could find scoring opportunities. Scott Mackey, GV's All-American DB picked off a pass late in the second quarter to score the game's only touchdown and give GVSU a 10\u20133 win. The National Semi-Finals saw another new foe for GVSU: Texas A&M-Kingsville.; GVSU's offense and defense dominated the game and GV won 31\u20133 and was off to their third straight NCAA D-II National Championship. A familiar foe was to meet Grand Valley: North Dakota. The game was sure to be a defensive battle as both teams rode their defenses to the title game. GVSU was leading 3\u20130 in the third quarter, but UND was driving into Laker territory looking for the lead when Lucius Hawkins made the play of the game. Hawkins forced the Sioux QB to fumble, and Lucius returned the ball 59 yards to the North Dakota 20-yard line. All-American Running Back Michael Tennessee scored three plays later and gave GVSU a 10\u20130 lead. GVSU led 10\u20133 in the closing minutes as North Dakota was driving. Senior linebacker Mike Hoad picked off a pass on the Laker 10-yard line to preserve the win and give GVSU back-to-back NCAA DII National Championships. The 2003 GVSU senior class etched their names in the record books by becoming just the second team (the other being the University of North Alabama) in NCAA Division II history to make three consecutive trips to title game. GVSU's defense held North Dakota to just 22 yards rushing in the title game, and held three straight playoff opponents without a touchdown. Saginaw Valley State, Texas A&M-Kingsville; and North Dakota. The Lakers were the first NCAA DII football playoff team to win four straight road games en route to a championship. The Laker seniors were 47\u20132 in their final 49 games and tallied a four-year GLIAC record of 34\u20134. === 2004 === The 2004 season opened the era of a new mentor as Brian Kelly left following the 2003 season to take the head coaching job at Central Michigan University. Chuck Martin became the fifth head coach in the history of the Laker football program. Martin won more games (10) than any of the four previous head coaches in their first year at the helm. GVSU went 8\u20132 in the regular season finishing 2nd in the GLIAC (Michigan Technological University won its first GLIAC title that year). They also played in front of the largest crowd (50,123) in their history when they played against Michigan Tech in Michigan Stadium at the University of Michigan in the \"Bash at the Big House\".http://archive.wzzm13.com/news/article/33049/0/Grand-Valley-is-best-at- Big-House However, since they were the lowest-seed (6th) in the Northwest region (the GLIAC had been moved out of the NE after DII playoffs were expanded from 16 teams to 24 teams, GV had to go on the road in the playoffs, again. They played the NSIC champion Winona State University at their field and won a hard fought game 16\u201313. In the second round, Grand Valley was able to beat Northwood, avenging a regular season loss, winning 10\u20137. Grand Valley appeared in their fourth straight Regional Final against a new, growing rival: North Dakota. In a hard fought game that the Lakers let slip away late in the fourth quarter (15\u201319), GV ended Coach Martin's first season at 10\u20133. The 2004 Laker senior class concluded their careers with a 51\u20135 record, including two National Championships and three title game appearances. The 51 wins by the Lakers senior class tied the D-II record for wins in a career. DT Keyonta Marshall became GVSU's first-ever three time All-American and played for the Philadelphia Eagles after being drafted in the 7th round of the 2005 NFL Draft. Grand Valley State continued to set single-season attendance records with a single-game average of 10,799 in 2004. Several players earned honors after the season: Keyonta Marshall, DT \u2013 AA (AFCA/AP/Football Gazette/Daktronics/D2Football/College Sports Report); Scott Greene, PK \u2013 AA (AP/D2Football/College Sports Report); DeJuane Boone, DB \u2013 AA (Football Gazette/Daktronics); Lucius hawkins, DB \u2013 AA (Football Gazette/Daktronics/D2Football/College Sports Report); Demonte Collins, WR \u2013 AAHM D2Football. === 2005 === Because GV did not advance to the national title game in 2004, the 2005 season came with much anticipation and concern. Coach Chuck Martin proceeded to lead the Lakers to their second undefeated season in history, going 13\u20130 and defeating Northwest Missouri State University in the NCAA Division II Football Championship title game. The Bearcats were ranked 21st in the nation coming into the tournament, the lowest ever for a Division II football playoff team. Chuck Martin's 23\u20133 record over his first two years as a head coach sets the records for Grand Valley Head Coaches in most wins in their first two seasons (23), and best winning percentage (0.885). Lubbers Stadium also saw numerous improvements, including a new football complex with home and visiting locker rooms, and expanded seating, bringing the official capacity of Lubbers Stadium to nearly 9,000. However, crowds of over 10,000 have frequently packed Lubbers Stadium to watch important games and the attendance record was broken twice during this season. The current record of 14,557 people was set when No. 1 Grand Valley State defeated rival Ferris State in the first game of the season. 2005 also saw the first year of the much-needed new scoreboard. Daktronics Inc. installed a new scoreboard, complete with digital video display at the North end of Lubbers Stadium. Several players from the 2005 squad won national awards. Leading the way was junior defensive end Michael McFadden who was a consensus All-American and received the Gene Upshaw award for best defensive lineman in DII. Coach Martin was voted by the American Football Coaches Association as the National Coach of the Year for Division II. === 2006 === The Lakers had an undefeated 2006 season, winning the GLIAC title, and the NCAA Division II National Championship, ranked No. 1 throughout the season and finishing with a (15\u20130) record. In the national title match, the Lakers again faced undefeated and second-ranked Division II rivals Northwest Missouri State, which finished the season with a (14\u20131) record. Senior quarterback Cullen Finnerty became the winningest quarterback in NCAA All-Division history, with a career record of 51\u20134, and was named to the 2006 American Football Coaches Association All America Team. He finished the 2006 season with a 15\u20130 record, completing 195 of 343 passes for 3,220 yards and 41 touchdowns, and leading the nation in quarterback efficiency with 169.32. He also rushed for 580 yards and 8 touchdowns himself, for a total offense of 3,800 yards and 49 touchdowns on the season. Finnerty was awarded second place for the Harlon Hill Trophy, just prior to the national championship match in Florence, Alabama.http://www.harlonhill.com/Current_News/Hill%20History%2086-13.pdf During the Championship game, held on Saturday, December 16, Finnerty ran the ball for 115 yards, leading the Lakers through an exciting game to a 17\u201314 victory. Finnerty, WR Eric Fowler, OL Brandon Barnes, DL Mike McFadden, LB Anthony Adams, and CB Brandon Carr each earned Daktronics First Team All American honors. Additionally, senior defensive end Michael McFadden tied the NCAA All-Division record for consecutive games with a quarterback sack (17), and broke the Division II quarterback sack record (34.5) for a career. McFadden also won the Gene Upshaw award that is given to the best defensive lineman in DII for the second year in a row. The 2006 senior class produced a career record of 52\u20134 over 4 seasons. Coach Chuck Martin improved his 3-season record as the head coach to 38\u20133 (0.927 winning percentage), and to 86\u20139 overall (.905) since joining the GVSU coaching staff as an assistant in 2000. Steve Brockelbank was the offensive coordinator for the second year as well as the assistant head coach. Coach Martin was voted by the American Football Coaches Association as the National Coach of the Year for Division II for the 2nd consecutive year, repeating Brian Kelly's back-to-back honors for the same award in 2002 & 2003. Cullen Finnerty finished his Laker career with a record of 51\u20134 as the team's starting QB, making him the winningest quarterback in college football history, regardless of NCAA Division. === 2007 === December 8: GVSU's 40 game win streak \u2013 an all-time Division II record \u2013 was snapped when they lost at Northwest Missouri State in the Division II National Semifinal game at Bearcat Stadium that was known as the \"Ice Bowl\" because it was played during the Mid-December 2007 North American Winter storms that would destroy more than 100 trees at Northwest's Missouri Arboretum campus. Grand Valley was ranked #1 and was undefeated and Northwest was ranked #5 and had lost one game but hosted the game because of strength of schedule. It began as a close game with Grand Valley leading 13\u201310 at halftime. The Lakers were able to pull within one, 17\u201316, late in the third quarter on Justin Trumble's third field goal. After NWMSU kicker Tommy Frevert made one from 22 yards early in the fourth quarter and Xavier Omon scored on an 11-yard pass 2\u00bd minutes later, the Bearcats were up 27\u201316. Five plays later, Omon broke loose for a 98-yard touchdown run with just over 9 minutes remaining. Final score: GVSU 16, NWMSU 34. Game totals: GV's Brad Iciek threw for 273 yards and a touchdown and an interception on 23 of 42 passing. Xavier Omon ran for 292 yards and four touchdowns.
