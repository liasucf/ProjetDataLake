    "text": "Guo Yunshen () (1829 - 1898) was a famous Xingyiquan master. He represented the xingyi martial philosophy of preferring to become highly proficient with only a few techniques rather than to be less proficient with many techniques. His skill with one technique Beng Quan was legendary: it was said from him that \"with his 'half-step bengquan', he could fight anyone under heaven without finding an equal.\" (banbu bengquan da yu tianxia wu dishou), and earned the nickname \"the steadfast\" (bu daota). Although it is not historically reliable, he is said to have fought Dong Hai Chuan, the founder of baguazhang, whereby neither was able to defeat the other. The outcome of their purported match was that practitioners of both arts each highly respected the others. In another version of this story, Guo Yunshen, desiring to fight Dong Hai Chuan, he first went to visit Cheng Tinghua, another native of Hebei province. Cheng invited Guo to dinner. Guo demonstrated his \"Divine Crushing Fist\", which Cheng evaded twice. Because of this, he rethought his plan to challenge Dong, knowing him to be a superior practitioner to Cheng. His teaching was based on the \"three truths\" (san li), the \"three capacities\" (san gong), the \"three methods\" (san fa) and the single/double weight notion (danzhong/shuangzhong) during santishi standing practice. His students should stand still for at least three years before they could learn the forms. Guo Yunshen had learned with Li Luo Neng and was also a member of the Hebei xingyiquan school. He taught famous students like Qian Yantang, Xu Zhanao, Li Kui Yuan and his disciple Sun Lutang. Wang Xiangzhai, founder of dachengquan was his last closed door disciple. Wang Xiangzhai was Guo Yunshen's nephew. Wang was taught Guo's traditional Xing Yi Quan. It is stated that Master Guo would instruct young Wang to hold the San Ti posture, without explanation, until a puddle of perspiration formed at his feet. This latter has been publicly revealed \"Zhan Zhuang\" by Wang Xiangzhai, a term commonly in use throughout the martial community today. ==References== ==External links== *Xingyi Quan history *Baguazhang history; Ottawa Chinese Martial Arts * Category:1829 births Category:1900 deaths Category:Chinese xingyiquan practitioners Category:Sportspeople from Hebei Category:People from Hengshui ",
