After his execution, he became known as a case of an avenging spirit. ==History== Following a rumor that a woman would jeopardize the town of [Jiangshan], King Xuan of Zhou (827\u2013783 BCE) ordered a mass execution of women.\u300a\u53f2\u8bb0\u6b63\u4e49\u300b After Du Bo admonished the king for his decision, King Xuan executed Du Bo, despite having been warned that Du Bo's ghost would haunt him.https://seeksghosts.blogspot.com/2015/07/china-ghost-of-tu-po.html Three years, King Xuan fell ill and died after dreaming that Du Bo shot him to death with an arrow.

If none have heard them and none have > seen them, then how can we say they do? But those who deny the existence of > the spirits say: \"Many in the world have heard and seen something of ghosts > and spirits. Since they vary in testimony, who are to be accepted as really > having heard and seen them?\" Mo Zi said: As we are to rely on what many have > jointly seen and what many have jointly heard, the case of Tu Po is to be > accepted.\"The Ethical and Political Works of Motse [Mo-tzu] Book VIII, > Chapter XXXI \"On Ghosts (III) Electronic republication of the translation by > W.
