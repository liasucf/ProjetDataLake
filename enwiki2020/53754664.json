    "text": "Residente (stylized as Res\u012bd\u03b5nt\u04d9) is the debut solo album from Puerto Rican rapper of same name, released on March 31, 2017, during the hiatus of his main band Calle 13. Following a DNA test which revealed that he descends from people of multiple parts of the world, Residente felt inspired to visit those locations and record with local musicians. The trips resulted in a 13-track album, two of which (\"Somos Anormales\" and \"Desencuentro\") were released as singles and received promotional videos. A documentary and book (both homonymous to the album) were also prepared based on his journey. A world tour will follow the album's release with shows in France, Germany, Spain, Denmark, Switzerland, Netherlands, Argentina, Chile, Mexico and Puerto Rico. == Background and production == A few years before the album's release, Residente took a DNA test that revealed his roots trace back to 10 different locations around the world, including Armenia, Ghana, China, and his homeland, Puerto Rico. Such diversity inspired him to produce what would later result in a solo album, a documentary and a book released via Fusion Media Group (Univision Communications) under the same common title Residente. He signed a five-year production deal with the label. The album was written and recorded over the course of two years and saw Residente travel around the world to the places where his roots are, including Siberia, Moscow, China, the Caucasus, France, Spain, England, Armenia, Ossetia in Georgia, Antigua, Ghana, Burkina Faso, and Niger, aside from Puerto Rico. In all these places, he worked with local, mostly amateur or unknown artists, some of whom were poor or affected by war. Despite this, Residente rejects the idea of it being a world music album because he \"wanted to do something new\". All of the artists would be paid for their royalties. He also said: About the album's general sound, he said, \"at a sound level it is not the most organic [album he's ever made], but the most real and precise. All sounds are from those countries, the drums, the voices, anything that sounds comes from that place.\" Parts of the pre and post- production of the album were done at Loisaida Center in New York City. Residente also worked at Electric Lady Studios in West Village. The album deals with themes such as equality and unity. Though Residente's initial approach to his trips were mainly musical, he was inspired by his conversations to focus on the subject of race. Despite being produced much before Donald Trump won the 2016 United States presidential elections, Residente admits its themes could relate to the scenario of the time of its release: \"I think that... the topic now is even more relevant because of what is happening with Trump and not only Trump, because there's a lot of racism around the world. [...] We all came from the same place, even though we are different, we are equally different\". Residente intends to release an English language version of the album and has already translated all lyrics with the help of Puerto Rican poet Urayo\u00e1n Noel, associate professor at New York University. The effort will be put out depending on Residente's satisfaction with it. == Song information == Lin-Manuel Miranda, Residente's distant cousin, guest performs on the album's opening track \"Intro ADN/DNA\" and narrates how both discovered their relationship. The second track and first single, \"Somos Anormales\", was recorded in Kyzyl, Tuva, after a one-week stay. Kyzyl was Residente's first stop in his trip around the world, and 6% of his DNA come from there. The song has guest performances of Chirgilchin and received a video shot in Spain featuring John Leguizamo, Leonor Watling, \u00d3scar Jaenada and Juan Diego Botto. The romantic song \"Desencuentro\" features French indie pop singer SoKo, and talks about two people perfect for each other but at the same time a mismatch. About including it on the album, Residente said: \"Everything that's in my albums are things that surround me, and this [love] also surrounds me\". The song received a video shot at the Cr\u00e9merie-Restaurant Polidor and featuring Charlotte Le Bon and \u00c9dgar Ram\u00edrez. While recording parts for the track \"Guerra\" at Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan military forces bombed the region, forcing the musicians to seek a safer location for recording at a church in Ossetia. About the experience, Residente said: The final version of the song includes drums performed by South Ossetian children, combined with a Georgian bandura and a Chechen choir. In China, from where 6% of his DNA comes, he worked with a group of Peking opera. About the experience, he says: He mixed their voices with two organs, one from Temple Church in London and another from Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in Barcelona. The resulting work became the song \"Apocal\u00edptico\", inspired by Beijing's \"choking pollution and the juxtaposition of modern buildings and a crumbling past\". In Africa, responsible for 10% of his DNA, he went to Burkina Faso, where he drew inspiration from Thomas Sankara to create \"La Sombra\", which features Niger-born Tuareg guitarist Bombino. \"Milo\" was inspired by a dream Residente had and it was named and written after his son. The song was conceived in Ghana. The dystopian-like song \"El Futuro Es Nuestro\" projects a future in which people eat cockroaches and the Moon is no more since terrorists blew it up. It features Goran Bregovi\u0107 and his brass band. \"Dagombas en Tamale\" features Dagomba tribal singers from Ghana and \"celebrates the spirit of the penniless\". The closing track \"Hijos del Ca\u00f1averal\", written in Puerto Rico, features vocals by his sister ILE. == Documentary == A self-titled documentary directed by Residente himself was produced simultaneously with the album. It debuted on March 16 at South by Southwest and depicts his childhood, his struggle with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, his times as a young artist, his rise with Calle 13 and why he decided to leave it and pursue a solo career. It received a favorable review by Michael Rechtshaffen from The Hollywood Reporter. In the week of its premiere, Residente and his solo band performed at the Latino Resist Concert at Lady Bird Lake. == Reception == === Accolades === The album received critical acclaim and some of its songs multiple nominations for the 18th Annual Latin Grammy Awards. The album itself was nominated for Album of the Year and Best Urban Music Album, winning the latter. \"Somos Anormales\" won the Best Urban Song award, \"Dagombas en Tamale\" was nominated for Best Urban Fusion/Performance, \"Desencuentro\" was nominated for Best Short Form Music Video, \"Guerra\" was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year, \"Apocaliptico\" was nominated for Best Alternative Song and \"Hijos del Ca\u00f1averal\" was nominated for Best Tropical Song. The album was elected the best Latin album of 2017 by the critics of Billboard, as well as the 19th best album overall of the same year. It was also ranked 38th at Rolling Stone's 50 Best Albums of 2017 list. ==Track listing== == Personnel == *Residente \u2013 vocals, producer, songwriting (all tracks) *Trooko \u2013 producer, programming (all tracks) *Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez \u2013 electric guitar (all tracks) *Ted Jensen \u2013 Mastering (all tracks) *Lin-Manuel Miranda \u2013 vocals (track 1) *Rafael Arcaute \u2013 producer, co-composer, additional engineering, additional programming (track 2, 4, 6\u20139, 11) *Igor Koshkendey \u2013 backing vocals, doshpuluur (track 2\u20133) *Mongun-ool Ondar \u2013 backing vocals (track 2\u20133) *Aidysmaa Koshkendey \u2013 backing vocals (track 2\u20133) *Aldar Tamdyn \u2013 backing vocals (track 3) *Brandon Bost \u2013 audio engineering (track 2), mixing assistant (track 4), assistant engineering (track 7\u201313) *Barry McCready \u2013 assistant engineering (track 2, 4, 6\u201313) *Gosha Usov \u2013 assistant engineering (track 2, 6\u20139, 11\u201312) *Phil Joly \u2013 recording engineering (track 2, 4, 6, 8, 10\u201313) *Tom Elmhirst \u2013 mixing engineering (track 2, 4, 6\u201313) *Pan Xiaojia \u2013 vocals (track 4) *Jin Jiujie \u2013 vocals (track 4) *Li Yang \u2013 luo drums (track 4) *Xu Ziling \u2013 guzheng, erhu (track 4) *Beatriz Artola \u2013 engineering (track 4, 6, 9\u201311) *Haruna Fati \u2013 vocals (track 5\u20136) *Kofo \u2013 vocals (track 6, 11) *Dela Botri \u2013 percussion (track 6), flute (track 11) *Tamma Cultural Troupe \u2013 percussion (track 6) *La Tortuga China \u2013 composer, writer (track 7) *Brandee Younger \u2013 harp (track 7) *Felipe Rodr\u00edguez \u2013 piccolo trumpet (track 7) *Anthony Calder\u00f3n \u2013 french horn (track 7, 13) *Harry Almod\u00f3var \u2013 cello (track 7, 11, 13) *Mar\u00eda Santiago \u2013 viola (track 7) *Gretchen O'Mahoney \u2013 violin (track 7, 11, 13) *Alexis Vel\u00e1zquez \u2013 violin (track 7, 11, 13) *Tony Royster, Jr. \u2013 drums (track 7, 8) *Leo Genovese \u2013 piano (track 7) *DJ Kraze \u2013 scratching (track 7) *Harold Wendell Sanders \u2013 assistant engineering (track 7) *Irakli Akhalaia \u2013panduri (track 8) *St. Mary's Church, Tskhinvali \u2013 choir (track 8) *Aznash Ensemble \u2013 choir (track 8) *Rhythms of the Mountains \u2013 percussion (track 8) *Darejan Margoshvili \u2013 vocals (track 8) *Nato Mutoshvili \u2013 vocals (track 8) *Rusudan Pareulidze \u2013 vocals (track 8) *Manana Alkhanashvili \u2013 vocals (track 8) *Alex Berdz \u2013 engineering (track 8) *Akihiro Nishimura \u2013 engineering (track 7\u20138) *Juan Camilo Arboleda \u2013 musical arranger (track 8) *Julio Reyes Copello \u2013 musical arranger (track 8) *Duan Ya Wen \u2013 vocals (track 9) *Tang Tian \u2013 backing vocals (track 9) *Juan De La Rubia \u2013 pipe organ (track 9) *Roger Sayer \u2013 pipe organ (track 9) *Edgar Abraham \u2013 musical arranger (track 7, 9, 11, 13) *Bombino \u2013 vocals, guitar (track 10) *Henry Cole \u2013 drums (track 10, 12) *Panagiotis Andreou \u2013 bass (track 10) *Supa Sa\u00ef \u2013 engineering (track 10) *Nyornuwofia Agrosor \u2013 vocals (track 11) *Meg Gbrindey Adom \u2013 vocals (track 11) *Edgard Marrero \u2013 viola (track 11, 13) *Hubert Kofu Anti \u2013 engineering (track 11) *Daniela Radkova \u2013 vocals (track 12) *Lyudmila Radkova \u2013 vocals (track 12) *Ogi Radivojevic \u2013 engineering (track 12) *Seth Paris \u2013 engineering (track 12\u201313) *Goran Bregovi\u0107 \u2013 guitar, co-writer, producer (track 12) *ILE \u2013 vocals (track 13) *Francisco \"Cholo\" Rosario \u2013 vocals (track 13) *Luis Sanz \u2013 cuatro (track 13) *H\u00e9ctor Mel\u00e9ndez \u2013 acoustic guitar (track 12\u201313) *Neftal\u00ed Ortiz \u2013 g\u00fciro (track 13) *Anthony Carrillo \u2013 bongo (track 13) *Daniel D\u00edaz \u2013 percussion (track 13) *Carlos Velazquez \u2013 engineering (track 13) ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !class=\"unsortable\"|Chart (2017) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|US Latin Albums (Billboard) | 3 |- !scope=\"row\"|US World Albums (Billboard) | 1 |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !class=\"unsortable\"|Chart (2017) !Position |- !scope=\"row\"|US Latin Albums (Billboard) | 83 |- !scope=\"row\"|US World Albums (Billboard) | 14 |} ==References== == External links == * Official website Category:2017 debut albums Category:Residente albums Category:Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album Category:Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album Category:Culture in Kyzyl ",
