    "text": "Music of Thrace is the music of Thrace, a region in Southeastern Europe spread over southern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and European Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The music of Thrace contains a written history that extends back to the antiquity, when Orpheus became a legendary musician and lived close to Olympus.Orpheus and Greek Religion (Mythos Books) by William Keith Guthrie and L. Alderlink, 1993), , page 61, \"... is a city Dion. Neadr it is a village called Pimpleia. It was there they say that Orpheus the Kikonian lived ... Though the Thracian people were eventually assimilated by surrounding Balkan groups, elements of Thracian folk music continue. Traditional Thracian dances are usually swift in tempo and are mostly circle dances in which the men dance at the front of the line. The gaida, a kind of bagpipe, is the most characteristic instrument, but clarinets and toumbelekis are also used. The Thracian gaida, also called the avlos, is different from the Macedonian or other Bulgarian bagpipes. It is more high in pitch then the Macedonian gaida but less so than the Bulgarian gaida (or Dura). The Thracian gaida is also still widely used throughout Thrace in northeastern Greece. ==Types of dances== *Chelebinsko (Chain Dance of the Gentlemen): is a choreography by Belco Stanev with great music in an interesting meter. It's 9/8 divided : 2 3 2 2. In the vocal part, the steps are exactly on the meter: QSQQ, but in the instrumental refrain, half a bar is added 2 3 (QS). The steps are in 2 2 2 3 (QQQS) and the missing half bar 2 2 (QQ) is added at the end so that is missing (mathematically). *Izgryala E Mesechinka (The moon has risen): A beautiful song from Northern (Bulgarian) Thrace that has inspired many choreographies, all of them with extensive arm work that is typical in dances from this region. *Jambolsko Paidushko: Pajdusko/Paidushko horo/Baiduska, etc. is a family of dances usually danced to 5/16 or 5/8 (Q S) rhythm and found in a large area spanning Serbia, Macedonia, Bulgaria, Greece, and beyond. It is the classic \"aksak\" (Turkish for limping) dance and rhythm. Its various forms reflect local preferences. This one is from the Jambol region in Northern (Bulgarian) Thrace, and was first introduced in the States by Dick Crum. *Krivo Sadovsko Horo (Twisted chain dance from Sadovo, Northern Thrace): Very fast dance, with special rhythm (13/8), this dance has many versions. *Pazardzhishka Kopanitsa: Pazardzhik Kopanitsa from Pazardzhik, Northern Thrace. *Pravo Trakiisko Horo: Pravo Trakiisko Horo (Straight Thracian chain dance) is from Northern Thrace. It has very little in common with the simple Pravo horo (straight chain dance). It's a challenging choreography by a performing group that was brought down from the stage. *Sedi Donka (Donka is sitting): One of the most unusual musical patterns in Bulgaria, Sedi Donka is in 25/16 meters.

This one is Pses idia st'oniro mu. *Sfarlis: Sfarlis is a beginner's dance from Western Thrace. *Troiro: Many Bulgarian dances from Northern Thrace have \"cousins\" (very similar dances) in Western (Greek) Thrace, and this is one of them: a Greek dance that sounds and feels Bulgarian. *Dostlar Bizim Halaya: This is a rom dance from Eastern (Turkish) Thrace. It is a reminder of the so-called \"tsigansko horo\" (gypsy chain dance), but the dances are not at all alike. *Hassapia: an ancient dance that simulates a stealth approach on any enemy camp, from beginning to victory. The hassapia dance has been dated back to Hellenistic times, before the time of Alexander the Great whose soldiers brought it to Macedonia. It is a warrior's dance in which the movements represent the noiseless approach on the enemy camp, the encounter, the fight, and the victory. This dance is done in a circle using a shoulder hold. A similar dance called \"kasapsko horo\" (butcher's chain dance) is performed in Bulgaria. *Kallinitikos: performed by three people (either two men and one woman or two women and one man), named after the kalines, or friends of the bride during her wedding, who escort her to the church performing this dance.

Performed in Western Thrace. *Mandilatos (Mandra): a couples dance performed at weddings. Mandilatos is a couples' dance which takes its name from the mandilia or handkerchiefs that the dancers hold while dancing.

A similar dance called \"rachenitsa\" (from \"raka\" - an arm) is performed in Northern Thrace. *Stis tris: a slow but swift dance.

This is the primary dance of Western Thrace and primarily danced by men where many tricks are performed.

A similar dance called \"na poyas\" (for belt) is found in Northern Thrace. *Dousko Zonaradiko-Tsestos: Tsestos is a challenging dance from Northern Greece (the region named Thrace or in Greek language Thraki).

As it goes on men come in front and they catch each other by the zonari (belt). At this point the dance becomes very quick and it consists of figures only(on twelve steps too). It performed by the Greek population of Northern Thrace (Anatoliki Romylia) and continues to be performed by all Greeks. It has roots in the most ancient dance of the world, the Greek dance Pyrihios which also has twelve steps. Bulgarian Trakiisko Pravo Horo has a lot in common with dousko zonaradiko Tsestos because in the past Greek population live on this field of Northern Thrace at Byzantine ages and now Bulgarians and many Greeks live in this area. *Paidushko (Baiduska, Pajdusko, Pajduska, Payduska): a very aggressive dance, usually performed by men.
