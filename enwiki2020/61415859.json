By the end of the month the size of the fires reached . As of 30 July, there have been no reported deaths or injuries due to the fires. The 2019 Siberia wildfires generated significant publicity, especially among the social media users. As a result, a process of reviewing legal regulations regarding forest protection and forest fire extinguishing activities has started at the state level. == Extent == On 31 July 2019, Russian authorities reported that 3 million hectares () were on fire, an area roughly the size of Belgium. The smoke from the fires has affected air quality in much of Siberia, including cities Novosibirsk, Krasnoyarsk, Omsk and other. Air travel was also disrupted. According to NASA data, on 31 July the smoke from burning Siberian forests reached the territory of Alaska and, possibly mixed with smoke from local fires, reached the western coast of Canada. As most of the area affected is in uninhabited and/or poorly accessible areas, most of the fires are not being attended by firefighters. As of 6 August, Russia's Aerial Forest Protection Service was fighting 161 fires on , and only monitoring others. The smoke from the fires is making aerial firefighting unsafe. In 2020, extreme heat fueled enormous outbreaks of wildfires in the Arctic Circle exceeding the 2019 record for CO2 emissions. == Reactions == On 1 August, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered an investigation into the accusation that fires have been started intentionally to conceal illegal logging. Officials in Krasnoyarsk were under investigation for neglecting to fight the fires. Medvedev also proposed revising regulatory acts in the field of extinguishing fires in regions including control zones, and instructed to consult with foreign experts in developing proposals to fight with wildfires, while US President Donald Trump offered Russia help in extinguishing the wildfires. ==See also== * August curse * 2010 Russian wildfires * 2015 Russian wildfires * 2018 Russian wildfires ==References== Siberia Siberia wildfires Category:Wildfires in Russia Category:Krasnoyarsk Krai Category:Sakha Republic Category:Zabaykalsky Krai ",
