    "text": "Life, Love & Other Mysteries is the third album by Contemporary Christian group Point of Grace. It was released in 1996 by Word and Epic Records. ==Background== The girls have mentioned that this was their hardest album to record. They called it a \"growing pain\" because John Mays, the man who signed the group to Word Records, had left the label.Album leaflet. Shortly afterwards, Word was sold, so this left them to make all major decisions on their own. Shelley originally did not want to do \"Circle of Friends\" because she thought it was something kitschy, like a Kumbayah song. Similar to what happened in the music videos for two of the group's previous songs, in \"Keep the Candle Burning\", there is a scene on the Dallas Mavericks' jet where Chris Jones (Terry), Stu Jones (Denise), and David Breen (then Shelley's fianc\u00e9; they married 2\u00bd months after the album was released) have cameos in the music video. \"Circle of Friends\" has been regarded as the group's signature song; a book by the group and their fan club both share this title. The current trio served as background vocalists on Kenny Rogers' cover of the song on his 2011 album The Love of God. Since Heather Payne's departure from the group in 2008, they have performed the song \"Keep The Candle Burning\" as a medley with \"The Great Divide\" and the song \"You Are The Answer\" as a medley with \"I'll Be Believing.\" ==Track listing== # \"Life, Love & Other Mysteries\" (Joel Lindsay, Reggie Hamm) - 4:03 # \"Keep the Candle Burning\" (Gayla Borders, Jeff Borders, Lowell Alexander) - 4:26 # \"That's the Way It's Meant to Be\" (Bruce Sudano, Michael Omartian) - 3:31 # \"Jesus Doesn't Care\" (Scott Krippayne, Tony Wood) - 4:43 # \"Gone Are the Dark Days\" (G.
