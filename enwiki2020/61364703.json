Meiser was lead on a project, which developed a website with UNSW, Neuroscience Research Australia (NeuRA) and collaborators at other universities to address a gap in treatment of psychiatric treatment that is currently not available to people concerned about their own or family members\u2019 vulnerability to depression. \u201cThere aren\u2019t really any specialised genetic counsellors who cover psychiatric illnesses in Australia\u201d, she said in an interview, in 2019. \u201cThe vast majority of genetic counsellors do prenatal genetic counselling or cancer genetic counselling.
