The station in split in two by Estrada de Taipas. This way, the level crossing is open faster for the local traffic and avoid delays. ==History== The station was opened by S\u00e3o Paulo Railway on 1 October 1891, named Taipas. In the 1940s, it was renamed to Jaragu\u00e1 because of a telegraph post that was next to the station with the same name. The located in the Km 95 of the SP-1452 road. In 1947, SPR lines were incorporated to the public state company Estrada de Ferro Santos-Jundia\u00ed (EFSJ). Besides many federal administrations, the station didn't went through any improvements, as in the 1970s and 1980s the lines were getting more abandoned. The scrapping of the commuter train system caused revolt in the commuters, who destroyed many stations, including Jaragu\u00e1, which was set on fire on 28 October 1983. In the following year, the station was reformed in the 1980s, the current building was constructed, and the train system was transferred to another federal company (CBTU). Currently, the building keeps its original characteristics and, since then, it attends the CPTM metropolitan trains, which started operating in 1994. Jaragu\u00e1 rail station was certified as a historical site by the CONDEPHAAT (Council of Defence of Historic, Archaeological, Artistic and Touristic Site) on 21 June 2010, by the Circullar Letter No, 1453/2010 of Process 60308/2009.
