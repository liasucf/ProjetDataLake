    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Ireland Tri-Nation Series was a cricket tournament that was held in September 2019 in Ireland. It was a tri-nation series that featured Ireland, the Netherlands and Scotland, with all the matches played as Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). The series was arranged after the planned first edition of the Euro T20 Slam was cancelled. The matches were used by all the teams as part of their preparation for the 2019 ICC Men's T20 World Cup Qualifier tournament. Both Cricket Scotland and the KNCB thanked Cricket Ireland for agreeing to host the tournament, following the cancellation of the Euro T20 Slam. The fifth match of the series saw Scotland beat the Netherlands by six wickets. The result meant that the Netherlands were knocked out of contention of winning the series. Ireland beat Scotland by one run in the sixth and final match, to win the series. Scotland's George Munsey was named as the player of the series for his batting, which included a century against the Netherlands in the second match. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left; margin:auto\" |- ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Gary Wilson (c) * Mark Adair * Andrew Balbirnie * David Delany * Gareth Delany * George Dockrell * Shane Getkate * ~~Jacob Mulder~~ * Kevin O'Brien * Boyd Rankin * Simi Singh * Paul Stirling * Harry Tector * Stuart Thompson * Lorcan Tucker * Craig Young | * Pieter Seelaar (c) * Philippe Boissevain * Ben Cooper * Scott Edwards (wk) * Clayton Floyd * Brandon Glover * Fred Klaassen * Bas de Leede * Paul van Meekeren * Max O'Dowd * Vikramjit Singh * Shane Snater * Antonius Staal * Tobias Visee | * Kyle Coetzer (c) * Richie Berrington * Matthew Cross * Alasdair Evans * Ollie Hairs * Michael Leask * Calum MacLeod * George Munsey * Adrian Neill * Safyaan Sharif * Tom Sole * Hamza Tahir * Craig Wallace * Mark Watt |} Jacob Mulder was ruled out of Ireland's squad due to injury and was replaced by Simi Singh. ==Points table== ==Matches== ===1st match=== ===2nd match=== ===3rd match=== ===4th match=== ===5th match=== ===6th match=== ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Series home at ESPN Cricinfo Category:2019 in Scottish cricket Category:2019 in Irish cricket Category:2019 in Dutch cricket Category:International cricket competitions in 2019\u201320 Category:Dutch cricket tours abroad Category:Scottish cricket tours abroad Category:September 2019 sports events in Europe ",
