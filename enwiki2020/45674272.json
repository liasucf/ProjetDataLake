In 2010 there were 150,000 baptized. The current vicar of Patriarch Youssef Absi is \"sede vacante\". ==Territory and statistics== The archeparchy is headquartered in the city of Damascus, where the seat is held at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Dormition. The territory is divided into 20 parishes and there were 150,000 Melkite Catholics in 2010. ==History== The headquarters in Damascus has ancient origins (3rd century). From the 14th century, with the decline of the city of Antioch, Damascus became the seat of the Greek Orthodox patriarchs. Following the schism within the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch in 1724 was erected a seat of Melkite Greek Catholic Church. Since 1838 Melkite Greek Catholic Archeparchy of Damascus is subject to the Melkite Patriarch of Antioch, who is represented by a patriarchal vicar, almost always with the dignity of bishop. From 21 June 2017 the patriarchal vicar is \"vacant\" because of the election of Archbishop Joseph Absi as the new Patriarch of Greek Melkite Catholic Church. ==See also== List of Melkite Greek Catholic Patriarchs of Antioch ==References== ==External links== * http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddamm.html * http://www.pgc- lb.org/fre/melkite_greek_catholic_church/Siege-patriarcal-d-antioche-Damas * https://web.archive.org/web/20120419194326/http://www.pgc- lb.org/english/Church3.shtml#Damas * https://web.archive.org/web/20150402111747/http://pgc-sy.org/ Category:Melkite Greek Catholic Church in Syria Category:Melkite Greek Catholic eparchies ",
