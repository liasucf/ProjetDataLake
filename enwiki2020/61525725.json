It is also referred to as the \"Portcullis badge\", the \"Holloway Prison brooch\" and the \"Victoria Cross of the Union\". ==Background== Violet Ann Bland's Hunger Strike Medal and Holloway Brooch Beginning in 1902 Holloway Prison was a female-only prison in London, England. In the early part of the twentieth century many suffragettes were incarcerated at the prison. As their actions became more militant the women received more severe sentences. Once in prison the women continued their protests, eventually going on hunger strikes as they demanded to be designated as \"political prisoners\". ==Holloway brooch== The Holloway brooch was designed by Sylvia Pankhurst. Made of silver, it depicts the portcullis symbol of Parliament and a broad arrow, associated with prison uniforms, in purple, white, and green enamel. The brooches were given to suffragettes upon their release from Holloway. The size is one inch by of an inch. It was manufactured by Toye & Co London. On 29 April 1909 the first brooches were distributed at a large meeting at the Albert Hall organised by the WSPU. The first brooches were presented by Christabel Pankhurst and Emmeline Pankhurst, Annie Kenney and Emmeline Pethick-Lawrence. ==Recipients of the Holloway brooch== *Dora Beedham *Sarah Benett *Mabel Capper *Leonora Cohen *Joan Cather *Louie (Louisa) Cullen *Emily Davison *Kate Williams Evans *Theresa Garnett *Clara Giveen *Katie Edith Gliddon *Laura Geraldine Lennox *Edith Bessie New *Annie Seymour Pearson *Pleasance Pendred *Grace Roe *Janie Terrero *Minnie Turner Edith New by Peter McNairn of Hawick who died in 1923.jpg|Edith New (1908) Louie Cullen Holloway (cropped).jpg|Louie Cullen (1908) Theresa Garnett par Linley Blathwayt.jpg|Theresa Garnett (1909) Minnie Turner 1909.jpg|Minnie Turner (1909) Janie_Terrero_Holloway_c1912.jpg|Janie Terrero (1912) Suffragette Mabel Capper Bow Street arrest 1912 (cropped).jpg|Mabel Capper (1912) Emily Wilding Davison.jpg|Emily Davison (1913) Clara Elizabeth Giveen 1914.jpg|Clara Giveen (1914) Miss Grace Roe - Daily Mirror (cropped) (cropped).jpg|Grace Roe (1914) ==See also== * Emmeline and Christabel Pankhurst Memorial * Hunger Strike Medal * Suffrage jewellery * The Suffragette Handkerchief ==References== Category:Brooches Category:Feminism and the arts Category:Women's suffrage Category:Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom ",
