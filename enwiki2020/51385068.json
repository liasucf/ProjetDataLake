    "text": "El Buey is a reef break and surfing location in Arica (Northern Chile). El Buey is a huge oceanic wave (big wave surfing) that breaks in the deep waters in the middle of the bay in front of El Gringo, about half a mile from the coast, and can deliver rides of more than 600 feet. It only starts breaking at eight feet and can reach 20 to 25 feet on good big south swells. The wave breaks left and right; the right here can take more size. It reaches its greatest size between April and August and can be good in October and November. The best swell direction is SSW between 190 and 210 degrees for the left to break perfect 15-foot tubes, swells over 220 degrees for the right to deliver huge, steep drops and potentially barreling tubes. ==References== Category:Surfing locations in Chile ",
