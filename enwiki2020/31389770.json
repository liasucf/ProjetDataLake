    "text": "Thomas Chase (died 1449) was a 15th-century judge and cleric who was Chancellor of the University of Oxford, and subsequently held the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland. Chase was Warden of the Hospital of St Bartholomew near Rye in 1420 and was subsequently attached to the free chapel at Jesmond near Newcastle. In politics he was a supporter of Humprey, the \"Good Duke of Gloucester\", and served as one of his chaplains.Griffiths, Ralph A. The Reign of Henry VI- the Exercise of Royal Authority Ernest Benn Ltd. 1981 p.413 He was Chancellor of the University of Oxford from 1426 until 1431, and Lord Chancellor of Ireland from 1441 until 1446. The Crown had originally appointed him as Irish Chancellor in 1432, and he travelled to Ireland to take up office, but Richard Talbot, Archbishop of Dublin, the outgoing Chancellor, simply refused to hand over the seal of office.O'Flanagan, J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors of Ireland London 1870 Vol.1 p.94 Chase, perhaps intimidated by the Archbishop's formidable personality, seems to have meekly returned to England, until such time as Archbishop Talbot was willing to surrender his office, as he duly did in 1441.O'Flanagan p.94 Due to the more than usually turbulent political conditions in Ireland, which was wracked by the feud between the Butler and Talbot factions, Chase when he eventually took up office was urged not to leave the country unless strictly necessary and, if he must travel abroad to hurry back as soon as possible.Griffiths p.413 Although he was described as a man of great learning,Griffiths p.413 Chase, unlike most holders of high office at the time, never became a bishop, and spent his last years as parson of High Ongar in Essex, where he died in 1449.Ball F. Elrington, The Judges in Ireland 1221\u20131921. John Murray, London, 1926. As Lord Chancellor he is mainly remembered for his petition to the Privy Council that Irish law students seeking admission to the Inns of Court in London should receive equal treatment with their English colleagues, to which the Council returned a favourable response.Kenny, Colum The King's Inns and the Kingdom of Ireland Irish Academic Press Dublin 1992 p.19 St Mary, High Ongar St Mary, High Ongar- Chace spent his later years as vicar here. == References == Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1449 deaths Category:Chancellors of the University of Oxford Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland ",
