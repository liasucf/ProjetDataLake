Alconbury Weston is situated north-west of Huntingdon. ==History== In 1085 William the Conqueror ordered that a survey should be carried out across his kingdom to discover who owned which parts and what it was worth. The survey took place in 1086 and the results were recorded in what, since the 12th century, has become known as the Domesday Book. Starting with the king himself, for each landholder within a county there is a list of their estates or manors; and, for each manor, there is a summary of the resources of the manor, the amount of annual rent that was collected by the lord of the manor both in 1066 and in 1086, together with the taxable value. Alconbury Weston was listed in the Domesday Book in the Hundred of Leightonstone in Huntingdonshire; the name of the settlement was written as Westune in the Domesday Book. In 1086 there was just one manor at Alconbury Weston; the annual rent paid to the lord of the manor in 1066 had been \u00a31 and the rent was the same in 1086. The Domesday Book does not explicitly detail the population of a place but it records that there was 4 households at Alconbury Weston. There is no consensus about the average size of a household at that time; estimates range from 3.5 to 5 people per household. Using these figures then an estimate of the population of Alconbury Weston in 1086 is that it was within the range of 14 and 20 people. The Domesday Book uses a number of units of measure for areas of land that are now unfamiliar terms, such as hides and ploughlands. In different parts of the country, these were terms for the area of land that a team of eight oxen could plough in a single season and are equivalent to ; this was the amount of land that was considered to be sufficient to support a single family. By 1086, the hide had become a unit of tax assessment rather than an actual land area; a hide was the amount of land that could be assessed as \u00a31 for tax purposes. The survey records that there was one ploughland at Alconbury Weston in 1086 and that there was the capacity for a further one ploughland. The tax assessment in the Domesday Book was known as geld or danegeld and was a type of land-tax based on the hide or ploughland. It was originally a way of collecting a tribute to pay off the Danes when they attacked England, and was only levied when necessary. Following the Norman Conquest, the geld was used to raise money for the King and to pay for continental wars; by 1130, the geld was being collected annually. Having determined the value of a manor's land and other assets, a tax of so many shillings and pence per pound of value would be levied on the land holder. While this was typically two shillings in the pound the amount did vary; for example, in 1084 it was as high as six shillings in the pound. For the manor at Alconbury Weston the total tax assessed was one geld. In 1086 there was no church at Alconbury Weston. ==Government== As a civil parish, Alconbury Weston has a parish council. The parish council is elected by the residents of the parish who have registered on the electoral roll; the parish council is the lowest tier of government in England. A parish council is responsible for providing and maintaining a variety of local services including allotments and a cemetery; grass cutting and tree planting within public open spaces such as a village green or playing fields. The parish council reviews all planning applications that might affect the parish and makes recommendations to Huntingdonshire District Council, which is the local planning authority for the parish. The parish council also represents the views of the parish on issues such as local transport, policing and the environment. The parish council raises its own tax to pay for these services, known as the parish precept, which is collected as part of the Council Tax. In 2015, Alconbury Weston parish council had seven members; meetings were held on a Monday every six to eight weeks in the Memorial Hall in Alconbury. Alconbury Weston was in the historic and administrative county of Huntingdonshire until 1965. From 1965, the village was part of the new administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough.

The brook floods occasionally during winter months (see flood '98) and can cause residents to be blocked from travelling by car and have to walk to get out of the village. (Assuming they got their warning in time and moved their vehicles, outside of the flooding area.) Conversely, the brook can become almost dry in the summer in certain areas. ===Location=== ===Climate=== The climate in the United Kingdom is defined as a temperate oceanic climate, or Cfb on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, a classification it shares with most of northwest Europe.
