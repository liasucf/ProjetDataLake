    "text": "Until September 1999, East Timor formed part of the Indonesian numbering plan, using the country code +62, followed by area codes for the two largest cities, Dili (390)Travel Indonesia, Volume 16, 1994, page 46 and Baucau (399).The Official Catholic Directory for the Year of Our Lord, Part 2, 1999, page 72 Following the violence in the wake of Indonesia's departure from the territory, most of the telecommunications infrastructure was destroyed, and Telkom Indonesia withdrew its services from East Timor. In the interim, the code +672, used by the Australian External Territories, was used to reach numbers in the territory.Telstra is reconnecting East Timor to the world, Telstra, 21 February 2000 Originally, the +672 code had been allocated to the then Portuguese Timor, before its invasion and occupation in 1975.White Book, Volume 2, Part 1, International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative Committee, International Telecommunication Union, 1969, page 30 A new country code, +670, was allocated to East Timor, but international access often remained severely limited. A complicating factor is that 670 was previously used by the Northern Marianas, with many carriers not aware that the code is now used by East Timor, and that the Northern Marianas, now part of the North American Numbering Plan, use the code 1 and the area code 670 instead, although calls to the Northern Marianas from the US are billed as calls to East Timor.Saipan is not in East Timor, The Saipan Blog, December 15, 2010 East Timor now has a closed numbering plan; all fixed line subscribers' numbers are seven digits, while mobile phone subscribers' numbers are now eight digits, with a '7' being added to the old seven-digit number.Timor Telecom Telephone numbering in East Timor is as follows: ==Area codes in East Timor== {| class=\"wikitable\" border=1 ! colspan=\"2\"|List of area codeshttp://www.itu.int/oth/T02020000D0/en |- !Area code || Area |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Western Region |- | 21X XXXX || Manufahi |- | 22X XXXX || Cova Lima |- | 23X XXXX || Bobonaro |- | 24X XXXX || Ainaro |- | 25X XXXX || Dekuse |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Central Region |- | 31X XXXX || Dili (reserve) |- | 32X XXXX || Dili (reserve) |- | 33X XXXX || Dili (initial) |- | 36X XXXX || Liquica |- | 37X XXXX || Aileu |- | 38X XXXX || Ermera |- | 39X XXXX || Oekusi |- ! colspan=\"2\"|Eastern Region |- | 41X XXXX || Baucau |- | 42X XXXX || Manatuto |- | 43X XXXX || Viqueque |- | 44X XXXX || Lautem |} *Mobile: 73xx-xxxx ~ 78xx-xxxx *Service numbers: 721-XXXX *Government departments: 333-YYYY *Ambulance service: 110 *Fire Dept: 115 *Emergency: 112 ==References== ==External links== * ITU allocations list East Timor Category:Communications in East Timor ",
