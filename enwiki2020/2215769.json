    "text": "Qasim ibn al-Hasan () (Sha'aban 7, 47 AH /October 2, 667 CE - Muharram 10, 61 AH /October 10, 680 CE), supported his uncle Husayn Ibn Ali in fighting off the Umayyad forces during the Battle of Karbala where he was killed in his teens. ==Early life== Qasim was born the son of Hasan ibn Ali, the second Imam, and his wife Umm Farwa. His father was the elder son of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatimah, and Qasim was thus a great-grandson of the prophet Mohammad, father of Fatimah. Qasim was only three years old when his father died. However he grew up in the company of his paternal family. Like his cousins, Awn and Muhammad, the sons of his paternal aunt Zaynab, Qasim were taught fencing by his uncle Abbas ibn Ali and cousin Ali Akbar. When Hasan's brother Husayn ibn Ali prepared to leave Medina in 680, Qasim's mother Umm Farwa asked Husayn to take her and the young Qasim with him. == Battle == === Preparation === Qasim asked his uncle, \"Will I also be among the martyrs?\" Husayn ibn Ali replied: \"How do you see death?\" Qasim said, \"O uncle, death to me is sweeter than honey.\" === Ashura === On the day of Ashura, Qasim, like other cousins before him, went to his uncle to ask for permission. Husayn would not permit him to fight because he was too young and Husayn could not bear the thought of anything happening to him. Qasim asked many times before going to his mother. When his mother saw that her son was upset, she gave him a letter that Qasim's father had written before he died. The letter stated: Qasim read the letter and gave to his uncle. After reading the letter Husayn said, He went to the battlefield and killed many fighters. A man came from behind and struck Qasim on the head. He fell to the ground, bleeding heavily. He called out for his uncle. Husayn and Abbas rushed over. The army of Yazid got scared thinking they were coming to attack them, creating confusion. Horses began running from one side to another, trampling and killing Qasim. Husayn and Abbas called out for him, but no reply came. When they found his body Husayn as took off his abaa and with Abbas collected his remains. ==See also== *List of casualties in Husayn's army at the Battle of Karbala *Sakinah bint Husayn == References == Category:667 births Category:680 deaths Category:People killed at the Battle of Karbala Category:Family of Muhammad Category:7th-century Arabs Category:Alids ",
