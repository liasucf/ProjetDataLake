It has been tentatively identified with Medeli, a Roman era town in the province of Africa Proconsularis. The ancient city was also the seat of an ancient Catholic bishopric the suffragan of the Archdiocese of Carthage.Titular Episcopal See of Medeli It is difficult to attribute with certainty the bishops to the diocese of Medeli, because of the different variants reported in the manuscripts. Mesnage assigns Iader, who took part in the Council of Carthage (256) of St. Cyprian to discuss the question of the lapsiJ. Mesnage, L'Afrique chr\u00e9tienne, Paris 1912, p. 115 while Morcelli and Jaubert put this bishop to the diocese of Midila in Numidia.Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa Christiana, Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), pp. 226, 229-230 and 272 The Donatist Bishop, Liberal, took part in the Conference of Carthage (411). (The city appears to have had no Catholic bishop at this time). Bishop Felicissimo, intervened at the Council of Carthage (525) though Morcelli attributes this to a hypothetical Bishop Diocese of Sedela not documented otherwise.Stefano Antonio Morcelli, Africa Christiana, Volume I, (Brescia, 1816), pp. 226, 229-230 and 272 Today Medeli survives as titular bishop; the current titular bishop is Zbigniew Zieli\u0144ski, auxiliary bishop of Gda\u0144sk. ==References== Category:Catholic titular sees in Africa Category:Former Roman Catholic dioceses in Africa Category:Roman towns and cities in Tunisia ",
