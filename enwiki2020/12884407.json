    "text": "PAS diastase showing Histoplasma in a liver biopsy. Periodic acid\u2013Schiff\u2013diastase (PAS-D, PAS diastase) stain is a periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS) stain used in combination with diastase, an enzyme that breaks down glycogen. PAS-D is a stain often used by pathologists as an ancillary study in making a histologic diagnosis on paraffin-embedded tissue specimens. PAS stain typically gives a magenta color in the presence of glycogen. When PAS and diastase are used together, a light pink color replaces the deep magenta. Differences in the intensities of the two stains (PAS and PAS-D) can be attributed to different glycogen concentrations and can be used to semiquantify glycogen in samples. In practice, the tissue is deparaffinized, the diastase incubates, and then the PAS stain is applied. An example of PAS-D in use is in showing gastric/duodenal metaplasia in duodenal adenomas. ==Additional images== Image:Histoplasma pas-d small.jpg|Histoplasma. PAS diastase stain.
