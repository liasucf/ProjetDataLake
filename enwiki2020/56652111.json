His first large project was the development of the \u201cATF Bank\u201d and its successful sale to UniCredit (from 1995 until November 2007).

Unicredit acquired ATF Bank for $2.1 billion in 2007 and Utemuratov reportedly made $785 million from the sale. Subsequent reports suggested that Utemuratov's stake in ATF had been larger than previously known and that he and family members made more than $1 billion from the sale. The deal turned out to be a poor one for Unicredit and within a year of acquiring ATF, the Italian bank had written down the value by \u20ac500 million.

This included Secretary of the Security Council from 2003 to 2006 and head of the President's private office from 2006 to 2008.https://www.linkedin.com/in/bulat- utemuratov-1b32447a/?originalSubdomain=kz From 2008 to 2013 he was described as an \u201cadviser to the President\u201d and he also held a role as a special representative to Kyrgyzstan.https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/8510797/Glencores-7.6bn- Kazakh-business-under-threat.html This close relationship between Utemuratov and President Nazarbayev has led to questions about the origins of Utemuratov's wealth.http://kazakhstanvoice.blogspot.com/2011/05/to-investors- of-glencore-on-kazakhstan.html In a letter to the London Stock Exchange, they opposition leaders said:https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/09ASTANA1762_a.html \"Bulat Utemuratov, the former head of administration for the President of Kazakhstan, is a co-owner of Kazzinc. Utemuratov is widely believed to be holding these assets for the benefit of Nazarbayev.\" This close relationship with President Nazarbayev led to Utemuratov being given the nickname \u201cthe grey cardinal\u201d in Kazakhstan.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/glencore-bought- jet-from-kazakh-dictators-sidekick-bulat-utemuratov-fz2lxrm56 He was also described as President Nazarbayev's \u201cpersonal financial manager\u201d in a US diplomatic cable leaked by Wikileaks. == Utemuratov and Glencore == Glencore International, the Swiss-based mining and commodities company, acquired the Vasilkovskoye gold mine in Kazakhstan from Utemuratov's Verny Capital.https://www.marketscreener.com/GLENCORE- PLC-8111440/pdf/278842/Glencore%20PLC_Annual-Report.pdf As part of this transaction, Verny was given shares in Kazzinc \u2013 Glencore's copper subsidiary in Kazakhstan. When Glencore announced its initial public offering (IPO) in London in 2011, the company said that some of the proceeds would be used to buy back the Kazzinc shares held by Verny Capitalhttps://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/commodities/8496018/Glencore-float- could-create-Kazakhstans-richest-man.html In 2012, Glencore bought the Kazzinc shares back from Verny Capital for $1.359 billion,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/glencore-in-new-deal-to- buy-1891-kazzinc-stake-2012-09-25 including $400 million in cash and the rest in Glencore shares.

The school was opened by President Nazarbayev. The Times quoted a spokeswoman for Utemuratov saying he: \"is neither a middleman, nor proxy for President Nazarbayev\" and that he had not profited from his relationship with the President. In 2013, Glencore gave a loan to Astana Property Management (APM), a company owned by Bulat Utemuratov via Verny Capital. The loan was to finance APM's construction of the Talan Towers hotel and apartment complex in Astana, Kazakhstan. Glencore loaned a total of $237 million to the project but the miner was forced to write off $96.5 million in 2018 after reported poor performance.https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/glencore-takes-96m-hit-on-loan- to-kazakhstans-bulat-utemuratov-wv895whgp ==Awards== * Kurmet Order (2002) *The First President's Order (2009) * Honorary citizen of Kyzylorda Region *Second Class Dostyk Order (2014) *The Philanthropist of the Year, Altyn Zhurek Award (2018) *Zhomart Zhurek Award (2018) for opening Asyl Miras autism-center in Uralsk and a joint project with the Red Crescent Society to support the population of East Kazakshstan Oblast affected by floods.
