Trustee Len Derkach argued that the school board \"wanted to keep politics out of the school system\", although a spokesperson for the premier indicated that the talk would not have been partisan in nature. The spokesperson added that Pawley had never been refused permission to speak to students before.\"School turns down premier's proposal to address students\", Globe and Mail, 2 November 1985, A4. ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:School districts in Manitoba ",
