    "text": "Goodbye Blue & White is a rarities album by Less Than Jake. It contains a number of songs from throughout their career, ranging from unreleased material, rarities to covers, mainly sourced from their numerous 7\" releases. The album was originally released on Gainesville's No Idea, then later re- released by Fueled by Ramen - a label then owned by Vinnie Fiorello, the band's drummer - with slight differences in track list and order. The album's name is a tribute to the very first van that Less Than Jake used for tours. \"The Blue & White\" survived through most of the band's early years before breaking down on the way to a Pez convention. The band compiled some material and dedicated this hard-to-find album to it. Album art shows pictures of the band in the van through LTJ's early years. The track listing includes several covers, including two Slayer covers. This album was re-released on March 18, 2008 with a bonus DVD featuring live performances from 1994 to 2007. ==Track listing== ===Fueled By Ramen release=== ===No Idea release=== 12\" Vinyl Track Listing ==References== ==External links== *Goodbye Blue & White at YouTube (streamed copy where licensed) Category:Less Than Jake albums Category:2002 compilation albums Category:Fueled by Ramen compilation albums Category:No Idea Records albums ",
