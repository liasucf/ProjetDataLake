Despite the demise of the Intercollegiate Hockey Association, The Greens had a chance to capture the Intercollegiate Championship if they could defeat the major powers. Their first test came against Princeton and while the team was able to withstand the assault from the Tigers, Dartmouth was unable to score in the game and lost 0\u20132. The team still had a chance for a title if they could get some help but, after dropping their next game to Harvard, Dartmouth saw their opportunity slip through their fingers. The offense resurfaced when they began playing again in February and carried the team to four consecutive victories. The Greens ended the year as the third best team in the country (behind only the teams they could not defeat) while Clarence Wanamaker set a program record with 20 goals on the year. Note: Dartmouth College did not possess a moniker for its athletic teams until the 1920s, however, the university had adopted 'Dartmouth Green' as its school color in 1866. ==Roster== ==Standings== ==Schedule and Results== |- !colspan=12 style=\";\" | Regular Season ==References== Category:Dartmouth Big Green men's ice hockey seasons Dartmouth Dartmouth Category:1914 in sports in New Hampshire Category:1913 in sports in New Hampshire ",
