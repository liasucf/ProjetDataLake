He is best known for his reconstruction of the inner city wall of A\u0161\u0161ur. ==Biography== Messerschmidt\u2019s line art for A\u0161\u0161ur-r\u0101\u2019im-ni\u0161\u0113\u0161u\u2019s memorial cone.Cone VAT? 2764, first published KAH 1 no. 63 (1911).All three extant Assyrian KinglistsKhorsabad Kinglist iii 7.SDAS Kinglist iii 1.Nassouhi Kinglist iii 11. give his filiation as \u201cson of A\u0161\u0161ur-b\u0113l-ni\u0161\u0113\u0161u,\" the monarch who immediately preceded him, but this is contradicted by the sole extant contemporary inscription, a cone giving a dedicatory inscription for the reconstruction of the wall of the inner city of A\u0161\u0161ur, which gives his father as A\u0161\u0161ur-n\u0113r\u0101r\u012b II (written phonetically on the third line of the illustration), the same as his predecessor who was presumably therefore his brother. With Ber-n\u0101din-a\u1e2b\u1e2be, another son of A\u0161\u0161ur-n\u0113r\u0101r\u012b who was given the title \"supreme judge,\" it seems he may have been the third of A\u0161\u0161ur-n\u0113r\u0101r\u012b's sons to rule. The cone identifies the previous restorers as Kikkia (c. 2000 BC), Ikunum (1867\u20131860 BC), Sargon I (1859 BC \u2013 ?), Puzur-A\u0161\u0161ur II, and A\u0161\u0161ur- n\u0101r\u0101ri I (1547\u20131522 BC) the son of Ishme-Dagan II (1579\u20131562 BC). The reference to Kikkia's original fortification of the city is repeated in one of the later king's, Salm\u0101nu-a\u0161ar\u0113d III, own inscriptions. It was recovered from an old adobe wall three meters from the northern edge of the ziggurat. He was succeeded by his son, A\u0161\u0161ur-nadin-a\u1e2b\u1e2b\u0113 II. ==Inscriptions== ==References== Category:15th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:14th-century BC Assyrian kings Category:Assyrian kings Category:14th-century BC rulers ",
