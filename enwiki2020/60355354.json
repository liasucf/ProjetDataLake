    "text": "Map of the Philipse Patent showing the holdings of Philip, Susanna, and Mary Philipse Susanna Philipse (also \"Susannah\", 8 September 1727 \u2013 22 November 1822) was the eldest surviving daughter of Frederick Philipse II, 2nd Lord of Philipsburg Manor of Westchester County, New York. She was, along with her elder brother Philip and younger sisters Mary (1730\u20131825), and Margaret (1733-1752), a one-quarter heir to the roughly \"Highland Patent\" of her father (later to become known as the Philipse Patent, and in time today's Putnam County of southeastern New York). Susanna was married to Beverley Robinson, a soldier from a prominent family in the Colony of Virginia who had relocated to the Province of New York. He was a childhood friend of future American general and statesman George Washington, who was for a time during the French and Indian War an irregular guest at their home on Susanna's land on the east bank of the Hudson. It is there Washington is said to have developed an attraction to Susanna's younger sister Mary. During the Revolution Susanna's lands and the Robinson family fortune were confiscated by the rebel government of the New York Colony. Their home became the headquarters of soon to turn treasonous Continental Army general Benedict Arnold. During an extended stay there by Washington Arnold's plans were revealed through the capture of British spymaster Major John Andre. Following his trial and sentencing Beverley Robinson was sent to Washington to plead for Andre's wife. Washington refused to see him. Following the war the Robinsons relocated to Southwest England, where in time they received a partial payment for their seized properties. Both died and were interred there. ==Marriage== On 7 July 1748, she married then-Captain Beverley Robinson, a soldier from a prominent family in the Colony of Virginia, in Trinity Church, New York City.Gentleman's Magazine, Beverley Robinson, February 1852 pp 188\u2013190 Robinson had personally raised a company of troops there in 1745 and relocated it to the Province of New York to defend that state's frontier against Indian attack.Loyal American Regiment: Beverley Robinson The couple went on have at least five children, four boys and a girl, including Beverley Honorable Robinson (1754\u20131816), Morris (1759-1815), Susanna Maria Robinson (1760\u20131833), John Robinson (1761\u20131828), and Frederick Philipse Robinson (1763-1852). ==Inheritance== Margaret Philipse died intestate in 1752, and her share of the Highland Patent was equally divided among her named living siblings. A redistribution of the land among them was done in 1754.French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860): \u201cThe Philipses Patent\u2026 divided among the remaining three [children] Philip\u2026 Susannah married to Beverly Robinson, and Mary married to Col. Roger Morris. On the 7th of Feb 1754, the patent was divided into 9 lots: 3, each 4 mi. square, bordering upon the Hudson and denominated \u2018water lots;\u2019 3, each 4 mi. wide by 12 long, extending N. and S. across the patent, and denominated \u2018long lots;\u2019 3, each 4 mi. square, upon the E. border denominated \u2018back lots.\u2019 Philip, Susannah and Mary Philipse each owned one of each kind of lots.\" Susanna's eldest brother, Frederick Philipse III (1720\u20131785), inherited the family's vast hereditary estate in lower Westchester County, New York, Philipsburg Manor, and was its third and last Lord. Upon Susanna's inheritance of her interest in the Patent, the Robinsons settled on her land, gradually renting parcels to tenant farmers. It was a pleasant life, though Susanna's plots were only lightly settled and lacked the commerce and industry of her eldest brother's Manor. ==American Revolution== With the onset of the American Revolutionary War Beverley sought to remain uninvolved, but in time relented. In 1777, he formed the Loyal American Regiment, which proved a very active Loyalist force in that conflict. In addition to serving as its Colonel and commander through the British defeat 1783, he was known for his work with the British secret service during the war, particularly in regards to the betrayal of Continental general Benedict Arnold in the Andr\u00e9 Affair.
