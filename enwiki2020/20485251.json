The castle is on a strategic hill point overlooking the town of Saranda, southeast of the town centre. From here one can control the whole town as well as the islands of Ksamil. ==History== The castle of L\u00ebkur\u00ebs was built in 1537 by Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent who had attacked Corfu and needed to control the harbor of Saranda and the road that connected it with Butrint. The region traditionally belonged to the southern part of the region of Himara. At the end of the 18th century the castle was attacked by Ali Pasha of Ioannina and the surrounding habitation raided. The castle used to withhold the old L\u00ebkur\u00ebs village. It has a square shape with two round towers on its north-western and south-eastern corners. To climb up to the castle, visitors need to leave the main road on Qaf\u00eb Gjasht\u00eb and go up the town hill from the other side of the town. Today tourist facilities are built next to the castle (restaurant etc.) in similar architectural style. ==Gallery== Kalaja e Lekursit 01.JPG Kalaja e Lekursit 02.JPG Kalaja e Lekursit 03.JPG Kalaja e Lekursit 04.JPG ==See also== *Tourism in Albania *Albanian Riviera *History of Albania ==References== Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1537 Category:Castles in Albania Category:Ruined castles in Albania Category:Buildings and structures in Sarand\u00eb Category:1537 establishments in the Ottoman Empire Category:Tourist attractions in Vlor\u00eb County ",
