His father was a Hungarian\u2013Jewish immigrant who fled Hungary in 1937 to Belgium where, as soon as his country came under German occupation, he entered the resistance by specialising in forging papers. Gyula Balk\u00e1ny was arrested in Paris in 1941, and sent to intern\u00e9 \u00e0 Drancy An Auschwitz survivor, Balkany senior returned to Neuilly after the war; he bought and sold equipment that was too heavy for Americans to ship home, and invested his earnings in a line of women's clothing and a chain of luxury ready-to-wear stores.. His mother is the daughter of a family of Latvian and Ukrainian Jewish tailors. === Education and early career === After studying at a Swiss international school, Balkany took over the family ready-to-wear business, R\u00e9ty, founded by his father until 1975... He was the treasurer of an association of amateur filmmakers, the independent Cinema Team, founded by Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Davy.Adrien Gombeaud, \"Merci qui ? Merci Davy \", Vanity Fair , may 2017, pages 116\u2013123. He tried out as an actor between 1965 and 1967, holding several secondary roles in cinema and television. He appeared in Soleil noir (Black Sun) by Denys de La Patelli\u00e8re and J'ai tu\u00e9 Raspoutine (I killed Rasputin) by Robert Hossein. Between 2001 and 2010, he occasionally played himself in television series, notably making an appearance in Commissaire Moulin.. In 1970, he was 22 years old and performed his military service at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e Palace, in Georges Pompidou's office, where he got in touch with the secretary general Michel Jobert, who would later be witness at his wedding.. === Personal life === In 1976, Balkany married Isabelle Smadja. Together they have two children, Alexandre (b. 1976) and Vanessa (b. 1980).... Balkany was accused of sexual harassment on several occasions: in 1996 by his ex-companion (who filed an official complaint), then in 2011 Marie-Claire Restoux, former judo champion and former substitute of Balkany at the National Assembly, also testified against him... ==Political career== Being close to Michel Jobert, Balkany was a founder member of RPR in December 1976, and was also member of its central committee. During the 1978 French legislative election, he was sent by Jacques Chirac to fight a seat in the first constituency of Yonne, where he obtained 10% of the vote, thus forcing the secretary general of the UDF, Jean-Pierre Soisson, to a second round ballot. === Levallois-Perret === After failing to take Auxerre, Balkany opened a surgery in Levallois-Perret. In 1981, after the dissolution of the National Assembly by Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand, he ran in the legislative elections where he was defeated by getting 46% of the votes against the Communist deputy mayor of Clichy, . A year later, during the cantonal elections in 1982, he won the seat of general councillor of the canton of South Levallois-Perret and became vice-president of the general council of the Hauts-de-Seine. In 1983, his list won the majority in the first round of municipal elections in Levallois-Perret with 51.1% of the vote. During his first two terms, he contributed to the radical re-shaping of Levallois-Perret, transforming the deliquescent industrial zones or wastelands (occupying nearly a quarter of the city's area) into residential and office districts. During the presidential campaign of 1995, he supported the candidacy of \u00c9douard Balladur, who was defeated by Jacques Chirac. In the following municipal elections, he lost to the Chiric-supporting Olivier de Chazeaux. In May 1996, Balkany was convicted (decision upheld on appeal on 30 January 1997) by the 9th chamber of the Nanterre Criminal Court, to 15 months suspended sentence, 200,000 francs fine and two years of ineligibility, for \"misappropriation of public funds for personal gain\".. Between 1985 and 1995, he had put three people on the city's payroll as municipal employees, while these individuals dealt only with his Levallois-Perret apartment and his second home near Giverny.. His wife Isabelle, vice-president of the general council of Hauts-de-Seine and city councilor in Levallois-Perret, was sentenced to the same penalty for misappropriation. On 28 July 1999, the Regional Auditor of Ile-de-France sentenced Patrick Balkany to reimburse the municipality of Levallois-Perret the amount of salaries of municipal employees subject to his conviction, in the amount of \u20ac523,897.96. . On the failure of his appeal to the State Council on 27 July 2005, Balkany spreads the reimbursement to the city from 2000 to 2006. He also owed Levallois-Perret \u20ac230,865.57, being the interest on the debt that the judges made run as of 31 May 1995, date of the dismissal by the mayor of the municipal agents. In February 2007, Balkany appealed to Thierry Breton, then Minister of the Economy, Finance and Industry, for the cancellation of this debt. On 12 February 2007, the Levallois-Perret municipal council (now with a majority of UMP) gave its consent to his request.. After Fran\u00e7ois Baroin rejected this request in June 2011, Balkany settled \u20ac63,684.43 and obtained from the Treasury a repayment schedule for the outstanding balance of \u20ac123,000.. In 2003, he was sentenced in the criminal court of Nanterre to a fine of \u20ac1,500 for intentionally and publicly libelling during a municipal council meeting Annie Mandois, a communist elected to the council, of having used public funds in the interest of a political party or for her personal interest. His accusations of her indoctrinating children while she was a teacher were overruled at trial.. This judgment was confirmed by the Court of Appeal of Versailles on 31 March 2004..

But Balkany and his wife always react by claiming that they are targeted. \"Je me demande s'il n'y a pas une volont\u00e9 de nuire...\", interview by Jean-Pierre Thiollet, France Soir, 2 July 2009 Balkany made international news on 17 July 2012, just days before the vote on a new national sexual harassment bill, when male lawmakers in the National Assembly including Balkany hooted and made catcalls as Housing Minister C\u00e9cile Duflot, who was wearing a floral dress and speaking about an architecture project. \"We were just admiring her,\" Patrick Balkany, a conservative legislator, told Le Figaro. In September 2019, Balkany and his wife Isabelle were convicted of tax fraud. The Paris tribunal sentenced him to a 4 years jail sentence and ordered his immediate arrest. His wife, Isabelle, was condemned to a three-year sentence. In October 2019, he was condemned to five years' imprisonment in second instance and corruption charges were dropped. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Official blog Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:The Republicans (France) politicians Category:French Jews Category:Jewish French politicians Category:French people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:People of Latvian-Jewish descent Category:French people of Ukrainian-Jewish descent Category:People named in the Panama Papers Category:Deputies of the 12th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 13th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:Deputies of the 14th National Assembly of the French Fifth Republic Category:People from Neuilly-sur-Seine ",
