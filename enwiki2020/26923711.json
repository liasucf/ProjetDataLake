    "text": "Colonel Mohommed Rayyan (died 1986), nicknamed \"Sky Falcon,\" was a fighter pilot with the Iraqi Air Force during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. He scored 5 air combat kills, making him an ace and the most successful Iraqi fighter pilot of that war.Arab MiG-19 and MiG-21 Units in Combat, by David Nicolle and Tom Cooper, (2004) Osprey Publishing, p.82He was the most successful MiG-25 pilot. Rayyan, while only a Flight Lieutenant and flying a MiG-21MF, claimed two (later confirmed) kills against Iranian F-5 Freedom Fighters in 1980. Later a Captain, he qualified on the MiG-25P in 1981 and claimed 5 more victories (3 verified by western sources.) Most of his victories were F-4 Phantoms. Having flown the MiG-25 was evidence of his considerable skill, as Soviet \"advisers\" were stationed in Iraq specifically to limit access to this advanced jet, and only the best pilots flew them.Exhumating the Dead Iraqi Air Force: Short History of MiG-25 in service with the Iraqi Air Force, since 1980, by Tom Cooper, Air Combat Information Group, Sept. 25, 2003Iraqi Air-to-Air Victories since 1967 In 1986, having attained the rank of Colonel, Rayyan was shot down and killed by IRIAF Grumman F-14 Tomcats. His 5 to 8 air combat victories make Rayyan the most successful MiG-25 fighter pilot ever. ==See also== *Jalil Zandi *Hossein Khalatbari == References == Category:1955 births Category:1986 deaths Category:Iraqi Air Force officers Category:Iraqi flying aces Category:Iran\u2013Iraq War flying aces Category:Iraqi military personnel of the Iran\u2013Iraq War Category:Aviators killed by being shot down ",
