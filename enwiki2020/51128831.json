    "text": "The Itingu\u00e7u State Park () is a state park in the state of S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. ==Location== The Itingu\u00e7u State Park covers a group of mountains along the Atlantic coast to the southwest of the town of Peru\u00edbe. The park is in the municipality of Peru\u00edbe on the south coast of S\u00e3o Paulo. It is divided into two sections. The N\u00facleo Itingu\u00e7u, a conservation unit in the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units, receives most of the visitors. The N\u00facleo do Arpoador is only open for visits for the purpose of education or scientific research. To the northeast the Guara\u00fa River separates the park from the Balne\u00e1rio Gar\u00e7a Vermelha. The Atlantic Ocean forms the east and southeast boundary. The Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge is offshore to the east. To the south it adjoins the Barra do Una Sustainable Development Reserve. To the west and northwest it adjoins the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station (ESEC), separated from the ESEC by the Una do Prelado River. The Ilha do Ameixal Area of Relevant Ecological Interest, which lies between two arms of the Una do Prelado, intrudes into the state park. ==Environment and facilities== The Itingu\u00e7u State Park contains large areas of well-preserved Atlantic Forest, waterfalls, beaches, rocky shores, mangroves and salt marsh forest. It is rich in fauna, especially birds, including 30 species of hummingbirds and woodpeckers. The park has administrative facilities in the Guara\u00fa Beach community, an auditorium with capacity for 40 people, a laboratory and a craft store. It is reached from there via the Guara\u00fa Road. In the park itself there is parking, food kiosks and toilets. There are several marked trails with stairs and handrails. The park has the infrastructure to conduct educational programs, and provides environmental monitors for groups. ==History== The Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Mosaic of conservation units was created by law 12.406 of 12 December 2006. It included the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station and the newly created Itingu\u00e7u and Prelado state parks, the Despraiado and Barra do Una sustainable development reserves and the Ilhas do Abrigo e Guararitama Wildlife Refuge. The state parks and sustainable development reserves were carved out of the ecological station. On 11 September 2007 the procurer general of the state declared that law 12.406 was unconstitutional. On 10 June 2009 a judgement upheld the finding of unconstitutionality. Law 14.982 of 8 April 2013 again altered the limits of the Jur\u00e9ia-Itatins Ecological Station, re-categorising some areas. These included the Itingu\u00e7u State Park. The law recreated the Jureia-Itatins Mosaic, which includes the park and other conservation units. The law defined the park as a \"special zone of ecotourism interest\". Work and activities in the park were to be mainly performed by the traditional residents of the conservation unit mosaic. ==Notes== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * Category:State parks of Brazil Category:Protected areas of S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Protected areas established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in Brazil ",
