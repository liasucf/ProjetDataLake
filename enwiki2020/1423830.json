He was a scholar sometimes known as The Father of Finnish History. ==Biography== He was born at Viitasaari in Tavastland, Finland. Parents were Sigfrid Porthan and Kristina Juslenius. His father was a vicar who became mentally ill in 1744. He was raised by his uncle Gustaf Juslenius (1702-1774) who was the vicar of Kronoby in the county of Ostrobothnia. In 1754, at the age of 15, Porthan entered the Royal Academy of Turku (now University of Helsinki). He was a student of professor Daniel Juslenius (1676\u20131752) who later served at Bishop of the Diocese of Borg\u00e5. Porthan was awarded his Master of Philosophy in 1760. In 1762, he became an associate professor. He was a professor 1777\u20131804 and served as rector 1786\u20131787 and 1798\u20131799. He became a Fennophile and brought Finnish history-writing, study of mythology and folk poetry, and other humanistic sciences to an international level. His De Po\u00ebsi Fennica (published in five parts 1776-78), a study on Finnish folk poetry, had great importance in awakening public interest in the Kalevala-poetry and Finnish mythology, and the study was also the basis of all later study of the poetry.Juha Y.

He was among the founders of the Aurora Society that advocated Finnish literary pursuits and was the editor of the first Finnish newspaper, Tidningar ugifne af et s\u00e4llskap i \u00c5bo, founded in 1771. He instructed Kristian Erik Lencqvist (1761\u20131808) whose 1782 dissertation De superstitione veterum Fennorum theoretica et practica was a seminal study of historic Finnish customs.Juha Y.

Porthan was also the instructor of poet Frans Mikael Franz\u00e9n (1772\u20131847) and also inspired the following generation of Finnish authors, poets and researchers, many of whom were among the founders of the Finnish Literature Society in 1831. The Porthania building of the University of Helsinki is named after Porthan. ==Editions== The main edition of Porthan's works remains Opera selecta.
