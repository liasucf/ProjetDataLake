    "text": "Lyuboslav Mladenov Penev (; born 31 August 1966) is a Bulgarian professional football manager and former player, who is the current manager of Bulgarian First League club Tsarsko Selo Sofia. Penev played as a striker for several clubs in Bulgaria and Spain. He started his career at CSKA Sofia in 1984, winning two Bulgarian League titles and four Bulgarian Cups. In 1989 he moved to Valencia, where he established himself as among the most prolific goalscorers in La Liga. After six seasons at Valencia, Penev joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, winning the 1995\u201396 La Liga. After leaving Atl\u00e9tico, he had stints with Compostela, Celta Vigo, CSKA and Lokomotiv Plovdiv. ==Career== Penev's first professional team was CSKA Sofia of the Bulgarian capital. He made his first team debut in 1984, when he was only 18 years old. CSKA of the late 1980s was the football \"alma mater\" to several Bulgarian players like Hristo Stoichkov who made it to the international team in the 1990s. During those days Lubo's teammates included defender Trifon Ivanov, winger Emil Kostadinov, and striker Hristo Stoichkov. With CSKA, Penev won the Bulgarian A Football Group twice (in 1987 and 1989) and the Bulgarian Cup three times (in 1987, 1988 and 1989). He was also voted Bulgarian Footballer of the Year in 1988. In 1989, after reaching stardom in Bulgarian football, he took an important step in his career by moving to the Spanish League. In Primera, Penev played for four clubs: Valencia CF, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, SD Compostela and Celta Vigo. The highlight of the Spanish years was the 1995\u20131996 season with Atl\u00e9tico, when the club won both the league championship and the Spanish Cup. Penev was the most efficient player of the \"double squad\" by scoring 22 goals in 44 games (including both league and cup matches). ==International career== Penev represented Bulgaria in 1996 European Football Championship in England and in the 1998 World Cup in France. He could not take part in the 1994 World Cup, as he had been diagnosed with testicular cancer since the beginning of 1994. For the same reason he was replaced by Nasko Sirakov during the match Bulgaria vs Romania at UEFA Euro 1996 in England. ==Coaching career== In March 2009, he succeeded his uncle Dimitar Penev as manager of CSKA Sofia and under his guidance the team qualified for the group stages of the UEFA Europa League, defeating FC Dynamo Moscow \u2013 2\u20131 on aggregate. On 6 November 2009, he gave his resignation, after a 1\u20133 loss to Swiss side FC Basel due to a conflict with the club's owners. CSKA finished 4th in the group behind Roma, Basel and Fulham. CSKA won its single point in the opening game against the future finalist Fulham (1\u20131 after a good strike from Michel Platini and a mistake from CSKA goalkeeper Ivan Karadzhov). However, Penev's resignation was not accepted, because the CSKA fans wanted him to stay. The club was leader in the Bulgarian championship before the last round, when Litex Lovech took the leadership. On 13 January 2010, after another clash with the owners, he was fired. After the lost game against Minyor Pernik he withdrew nine players from training sessions for breaking the club's rules, this led to the conflict with the owners.CSKA Sofia suspends 9 players for partying During the summer many rumours connected him with a transfer to a Spanish clubs (mainly from Liga Adelante, but from Liga BBVA sides too), but he remained a free agent. On 2 September 2010, he became manager of Litex Lovech and won the 2010\u20132011 A PFG Group championship. On 23 October 2011, he resigned as Litex Lovech coach and was appointed manager of the national team. In his first game in charge, on 29 February 2012, Bulgaria earned a 1\u20131 draw away to Hungary. On 26 May 2012 his team defeated the runners-up of the 2010 FIFA World Cup Netherlands in Amsterdam by a score of 2\u20131. Under his management, Bulgaria's fortunes picked up and the team put in credible performances against Italy, Denmark and the Czech Republic in the qualifications for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. As a result, Bulgaria climbed from 96th in the FIFA World rankings when Penev took over, to 40th in November 2012. At one point Bulgaria stood second in Group B on 13 points. Their next game was against the Czech Republic in Sofia on 15 October 2013, a match which Bulgaria lost 0\u20131. On 1 November 2013, Lyuboslav Penev extended his contract with the national team of Bulgaria for two years. During this period, he would be able to qualify the team for the UEFA Euro 2016 in France.\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u041f\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u043e\u0449\u0435 2 \u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043b\u043e \u043d\u0430 \u0411\u044a\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u0438\u044f On 6 June 2014, Penev was unveiled as the new manager of Botev Plovdiv, emphasising that his new duties will not in any way affect his commitment to the national team.\u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e \u041f\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432: \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043c\u0438 \u0432 \"\u0411\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0432\" (\u041f\u0434) \u0449\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043d\u0435 \u043d\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u043d\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0431\u043e\u0440, \u043d\u044f\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u0438\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u0449\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043d\u0438 The sudden financial troubles of the club, however, led to the quick termination of his contract in early July after only one game (4\u20130 home victory against Libertas at the first qualifying round for UEFA Europa League).\u041f\u0440\u0438\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435, \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 \u043a\u043e\u0438\u0442\u043e \u041f\u0435\u043d\u0435\u0432 \u0438 \u0411\u043e\u0442\u0435\u0432 \u041f\u0434 \u0441\u0435 \u0440\u0430\u0437\u0434\u0435\u043b\u044f\u0442 On 8 July 2014, Penev left Botev Plovdiv after just one game to focus on the Bulgaria National Team.http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2122381.html On 20 November 2014, Penev was sacked by Bulgaria National Team following a run of poor results that culminated in a frustrating 1\u20131 home draw with Malta.https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/247/711/4/index.html In late April 2015, Penev took over as coach of former club CSKA Sofia until the end of the season, replacing Galin Ivanov after the club had found itself in a difficult situation due to a string of unsuccessful performances that had started at the beginning of 2015.\u0412\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0445\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u044a\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0430 On 22 January 2016 it was announced that he is going to manage Litex Lovech for a second time. The team was lately expelled from A Group, but had matches for the Bulgarian Cup until end of the season. In late September 2016, national team coach Ivaylo Petev agreed to a managerial contract with Dinamo Zagreb and therefore resigned. Many of the top national team players have spoken out in favour of Penev being reappointed as a national team coach - this is due to his tough and successful coaching. Many players such as Stanislav Manolev (who was, however, released from CSKA Sofia in 2019 while Penev was the manager) have stated that Bulgaria has been at their best in many recent years under coach Penev, as he is tough and very tactically mindful of the game and knows exactly what to do to bring the Bulgarian national team back to its original status as a side competitive with the European powerhouses in football.\u0412\u044a\u0432\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0445\u0430 \u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438 \u043f\u0440\u0430\u0432\u0438\u043b\u0430 \u0432 \u0441\u044a\u0431\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043b\u043d\u044f\u0442\u0430 He was appointed as manager of CSKA Sofia for a third time on 8 February 2019, but resigned in early May due to disagreements with the club's board. On 30 April 2020, Penev took over as head coach of Tsarsko Selo Sofia. He managed to secure the team's place in the top flight of Bulgarian football. ==Managerial statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=8|Record |- !G !W !D !L !Win % !GF !GA !GD |- |align=left|CSKA Sofia |align=left|6 March 2009 |align=left|13 January 2010 |align=centre|52 |align=centre|18 |align=centre|+34 |- |align=left|Litex Lovech |align=left|2 September 2010 |align=left|24 October 2011 |align=centre|76 |align=centre|26 |align=centre|+50 |- |align=left|Bulgaria |align=left|1 November 2011 |align=left|20 November 2014 |align=centre|28 |align=centre|24 |align=centre|+4 |- |align=left|CSKA Sofia |align=left|28 April 2015 |align=left|30 June 2015 |align=centre|6 |align=centre|5 |align=centre|+1 |- |align=left|Litex Lovech |align=left|22 January 2016 |align=left|6 June 2016 |align=centre|1 |align=centre|2 |align=centre|-1 |- |align=left|Litex Lovech II |align=left|22 January 2016 |align=left|6 June 2016 |align=centre|32 |align=centre|8 |align=centre|+24 |- |align=left|CSKA Sofia |align=left|8 February 2019 |align=left|3 May 2019 |align=centre|22 |align=centre|13 |align=centre|+9 |- |align=left|Tsarsko Selo |align=left|30 April 2020 |align=left| present |align=centre|11 |align=centre|11 |align=centre|0 |- !colspan=3|Total !align=centre|228 !align=centre|107 !align=centre|+121 |} ==Honours== ===As a player=== CSKA Sofia *Bulgarian League: 1986\u201387, 1988\u201389 *Bulgarian Cup: 1984\u201385, 1986\u201387, 1987\u201388, 1988\u201389 *Cup of the Soviet Army: 1985, 1986, 1989 *Bulgarian Super Cup: 1989 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid *La Liga: 1995\u201396 *Copa del Rey: 1995\u201396 Individual * Bulgarian Footballer of the Year: 1988 ===As a manager=== Litex Lovech *Bulgarian League: 2010\u201311 ==References== ==External links== * Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Sofia Category:Association football forwards Category:Bulgarian footballers Category:Bulgaria international footballers Category:Bulgaria youth international footballers Category:Bulgarian expatriate footballers Category:First Professional Football League (Bulgaria) players Category:La Liga players Category:PFC CSKA Sofia players Category:Valencia CF players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Madrid footballers Category:SD Compostela footballers Category:RC Celta de Vigo players Category:PFC Lokomotiv Plovdiv players Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Bulgarian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:UEFA Euro 1996 players Category:1998 FIFA World Cup players Category:Testicular cancer survivors Category:Bulgarian football managers Category:PFC CSKA Sofia managers Category:PFC Litex Lovech managers Category:Bulgaria national football team managers Category:PFC Botev Plovdiv managers ",
