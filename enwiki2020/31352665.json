The markings are prismatic violet-blue-metallic, finely black-edged. There are six slender streaks rising from white dots on the costa, the first at one-third somewhat oblique, reaching half across the wing, the others direct, the second shorter, the third and fourth reaching nearly half across the wing, the last two short. A rather short erect streak is found from the dorsum beyond the middle, and one from before the tornus reaching half across the wing. There is a dot in the disc beyond the middle, one towards the termen above the middle, two on lower part of the termen, and one on the termen beneath the apex.
