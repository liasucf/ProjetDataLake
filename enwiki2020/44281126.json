While labeled as a new wave band, the director of Wild Romance's record label, Ariola, disputed this categorization when first promoting the band to the American audience in 1979, saying it came about \"because he [Brood]'s a European artist\". The band was formed in 1976 in Groningen and had various lineups. The band got its name from the lyric \"...and I lost my mind in a wild romance\" which they heard on the American jazz and blues singer, Mose Allison\u2019s 1957 recording of the song Lost Mind, which was written by Percy Mayfield in 1951; both Brood and manager Koos van Dijk were fans of Allison.
