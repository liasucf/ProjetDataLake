    "text": "Stockton is a historic plantation house located near Woodville, Perquimans County, North Carolina. It was built in 1840, by Josiah T. Granbery and consists of a two-story, three bay, temple form central section flanked by one-story wings. The Greek Revival style frame house has gable roofs on each section and a prostyle tetrastyle Doric order portico on the front of the central section. It was the boyhood home of Robert W. Welch, Jr. (1899-1930). The house and 500 acres was then sold to Alvie Cook in 1935 who owned it until his death in 1970. Alvie and Mabel Cook raised five daughters in the home: Marguerite, Sue, Peggy, Grace, and Mabel Louise (known as Pete and later Kate). After Alvie's death, Mabel Cook, sold it in 1972 to Eugene and Ellen Rountree. In 1992 Historic Preservation Foundation of North Carolina holds Protective Covenants and the house is sold to Terry L. and LuAnn H. Cobbs who own Stockton to this day. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Plantation houses in North Carolina Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Greek Revival houses in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1848 Category:Houses in Perquimans County, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Perquimans County, North Carolina ",
