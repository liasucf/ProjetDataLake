    "text": "Christian Brothers Academy (CBA) is a private Catholic college preparatory school in suburban Syracuse, New York run by the Brothers of the Christian Schools, founded by St. John Baptist de La Salle. Located within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Syracuse, the school has more than 750 students in grades seven through twelve. It was founded in 1900 by the Christian Brothers, who still run the school, though most of the teachers are laity. In 1960, it moved from its original site on Willow Street in downtown Syracuse to its current location in suburban Dewitt on Randall Road. CBA was a boys-only school until September 1987. CBA opened to girls after Syracuse's all-girls school, The Franciscan Academy, closed and many of those parents actively lobbied to have CBA accept female students. In 2019, CBA was named a National Blue Ribbon School of Excellence, one of 50 private schools nationally, and the only private school in New York State. CBA was also ranked as the No. 1 Catholic high school in all of Upstate New York (Albany, Rochester, Buffalo, Binghamton, etc.). Members of the graduating class of 2019 received college acceptances into such schools as Notre Dame, Harvard University, Princeton, Yale, Cornell University, Boston College, Georgetown, Villanova University, United States Air Force Academy, Clemson University, Colgate University, Clarkson University, Hamilton College, Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and other equally prestigious colleges and universities. The class of 2019 received a total of over $25,000,000 in scholarships, had six National Merit Commended Students, and had seven students who committed to play Division I athletics. The average standardized test scores achieved by CBA students are in the top 15% of all high schools in the country. In 2019, CBA students outperformed the State average on all Regents exams. CBA students on average scored 30 percentage points higher on the New York State Math and ELA exam compared to students throughout New York State. With over 25 Advanced Placement Courses offered, on average, CBA students take more than 4 AP courses-preparing students for college and potentially offering college credit during their time at the school. CBA has a noted history of athletic achievements at the local and state levels. In the past 25 years, the school has captured State Championships in baseball, boys basketball, football, girls lacrosse (4 state titles), boys lacrosse, boys soccer, ice hockey and cross country.
