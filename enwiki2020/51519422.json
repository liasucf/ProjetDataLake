The family belonged to the Turkish- Sephardi Jews. The family came to ViennaHaim D. L. in: Vienna address book, 1891, part 3, p. 501. \"Haim, D.L. Ges. d. F.D. & R. Haim & D.

From 1912 to 1914 she studied in Paris, where her works attracted the interest of the sculptor Auguste Rodin. With a bust of her sister, her first work, she participated in an exhibition of the Berlin Secession. A long-standing friendship linked her to the sculptor K\u00e4the Kollwitz. In 1914 she married the Berlin painter (1881-1961). From 1921 the couple undertook study trips to Greece, Italy, Egypt and a longer trip to Bali and Java in 1931/32. From 1927 to 1931 she was a member of the Association of Berlin artists. In 1933, they decided on the advice of K\u00e4the Kollwitz not to return to Germany because of the deteriorating situation for Jews. They stayed in China (1932\u201333) and Indonesia (1933\u201334) and in around 1935/36 in Siam and Cambodia, 1936-37 in SingaporeDistinguished Artists In Singapore - Husband And Wife As Painter And Sculptress.

With the outbreak of World War II, the couple was deported in 1940 as \"Enemy Aliens\" to Australia, where they were interned until 1942 in Tatura, Victoria. After release they settled in Melbourne, received Australian citizenship in 1946, and anglicized their name to \"Wentcher\". Tina Haim-Wentcher joined the Melbourne Society of Women Painters and Sculptors, and in 1958 she was awarded the \"Interstate Sculptors Prize\" of Newcastle, New South Wales. Her charitable work for the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne led to a close friendship with the philanthropist Dame Elisabeth Murdoch (1909-2012), the mother of media mogul Rupert Murdoch. Tina Haim-Wentcher died in 1974 in Melbourne at the age of 87. ==Work == In 1920 the art patron Henri James Simon gave the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, among of other pieces, the bust of the Egyptian queen Nefertiti, the most famous exhibit of his collection. Simon had financed the excavations of Ludwig Borchardt in the Egyptian Amarna and brought the artifacts to Germany. Heinrich Sch\u00e4fer, director of the Egyptian Museum, greatly appreciated the works of Tina Haim. He commissioned her in 1913 to make a detailed copy of the bust. She made two copies in artificial stone for Wilhelm II, German Emperor and James Simon. In the early 1920s Haim-Wentscher once again made a model bust of Nefertiti, which was used for many years for molding all subsequent replicas. (\"Historical replica of Nefertiti.
