The youth teams play in the Y-League and National Premier Leagues (U20, U18, U15). Melbourne Victory Youth is the highest level squad within the setup. They play the majority of their home games at Epping Stadium. Senior players occasionally play in the youth side, as in the case when they're recovering from injury. Jamie Monteith currently manages the NPL team. The team is currently captained by centre back, Benjamin Carrigan. ==Youth team history== On 7 November 2014, it was confirmed that the team would compete in the National Premier Leagues Victoria 1 competition for 2015 season onwards. Victory managed promotion at their first attempt, placing second in the NPL1 East division, going on to beat Moreland Zebras FC in the qualification playoff and then North Geelong Warriors FC in the promotion playoff. For the club's first season in the top tier of football in Victorian state football, Matt Hennessey and Ryan Lambert were signed from Hume City FC and Richmond SC respectively. ==Youth current squad== ==Under-23s team history== The team was founded in 2008, as a Melbourne Victory representative team for the inaugural season of the National Youth League competition, along with six other youth squads, and finished a disappointing sixth. The development side has had three managers, Mehmet Durakovic, who was promoted to manager of the senior squad in 2011, and current managers Darren Davies and John Aloisi. Davies led the youth side to its first silverware victory in winning the premiership plate, finishing first on the National Youth League ladder in the 2012-13 season. It would be current club chairman Anthony Di Pietro's first silverware victory as well. ==Under-23s current squad== ===Young Pros=== ===Second Years=== ==Current staff== {{Fb cs staff |bg= |p=Coach|s=Vacant ==Honours== ;Youth *La Ionica Community Cup ::Winners (1): 2015 National Premier Leagues Victoria Premiership **Runners-up (1): 2015 ;Under-23s *Y-League Premiership **Premiers (1): 2012\u201313 ;Academy *National Premier Leagues Victoria U-20 Premiership **Premiers (1): 2015 *National Premier Leagues Victoria 2 U-20 Premiership **Premiers (2): 2017, 2019 **Runners-up (1): 2018 National Premier Leagues Victoria U-18 Premiership **Premiers (1): 2019 ==Stadiums== The team play their home matches at Epping Stadium in Melbourne's northern suburb of Epping. The stadium has a total capacity of 10,000, with a single grandstand of approximately 1,000 seats. Past venues used as a home ground by the club have been South Melbourne FC home ground Lakeside Stadium in Albert Park, Bentleigh Greens' Kingston Heath in Cheltenham and Northcote City's John Cain Memorial Reserve in Thornbury; however, with the side now competing the top division of Victorian football, along with all three of these sides, ground-sharing with any of the sides was not a preferred option, with Epping Stadium providing the club with the facilities required. The team has also played competitive matches at Victory's senior team home venues, AAMI Park and Etihad Stadium. ==Former players== This is a list of former Melbourne Victory Youth players, who have played at least 20 A-League competitive matches for the first team. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !style=\"width:11em\"|Name!!Nationality!!Position!!Melbourne career!!Appearances!!Goals |- |align=\"left\"|Nick Ansell||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2011\u201317, 2018\u2013|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Thomas Deng||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2015\u2013|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Mate Dugandzic||align=\"left\"|||Forward||2009\u201311|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Diogo Ferreira||align=\"left\"|||Midfielder||2010\u201313|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Matthew Foschini||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2009\u201313|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Petar Franjic||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2010\u201313|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Scott Galloway||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2013\u201316|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Jason Geria||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2012\u201318|||| |- |align=\"left\"|James Jeggo||align=\"left\"|||Midfielder||2011\u201314|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Mitchell Langerak||align=\"left\"|||Goalkeeper||2007\u201310|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Dylan Murnane||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2013\u201316|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Andrew Nabbout||align=\"left\"|||Forward||2012\u201315|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Sebastian Ryall||align=\"left\"|||Defender||2007\u201309|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Connor Pain||align=\"left\"|||Forward||2013\u201316|||| |- |align=\"left\"|Stefan Nigro||align=\"left\"|||Midfielder||2015\u2013|||| |- |} *Bold denotes players still playing in Melbourne Victory *Appearances only consist of competitive domestic league appearances ==Managerial history== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
