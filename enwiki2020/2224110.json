    "text": "A self-portrait by Nicholas Hilliard (1577) The Hilliard Ensemble was a British male vocal quartet originally devoted to the performance of early music. The group was named after the Elizabethan miniaturist painter Nicholas Hilliard. Founded in 1974,[ The Hilliard Ensemble biography by Timothy Dickey, discography and album reviews, credits & releases] at AllMusic the group disbanded in 2014. Although most of its work focused on music of the Medieval and Renaissance periods, the Hilliard Ensemble also performed contemporary music, working frequently with the Estonian composer Arvo P\u00e4rt and included in its concerts works by John Cage, Gavin Bryars, Giya Kancheli, and Heinz Holliger. ==History== ===Membership=== The group was founded by Paul Hillier, Errol Girdlestone, Paul Elliott, and David James, although the membership was flexible until Hillier left in 1990. After that, the core members were David James (counter-tenor), Rogers Covey-Crump (tenor/high tenor), John Potter (tenor), and Gordon Jones (bass), except that in 1998 John Potter was replaced by Steven Harrold. ===Recordings=== The Hilliard Ensemble, under Paul Hillier, had an extensive discography with EMI's Reflexe early music series during the 1980s. The ensemble then recorded mainly for the ECM label. In 1994, when popular interest in Gregorian chant was at its height, the ensemble released the CD Officium, an unprecedented collaboration with the Norwegian saxophonist Jan Garbarek. The disc became one of ECM's biggest-selling releases, reaching the pop charts in several European countries and receiving five gold discs in sales. Officium's sequel, the 2-CD set Mnemosyne, followed in 1999. The third album, Officium Novum, was released in 2010.Jan Garbarek / The Hilliard Ensemble / Officium Novum ECMJohn Eyles: Will please both jazz aficionados and followers of choral music BBC 28 September 2010 Their recordings have also been included in Craig Wright's Listening to Music textbook for music students and music appreciation. ===Performances=== In 2005 the ensemble took part in the Rheingau Musik Festival's composer's portrait of Arvo P\u00e4rt, together with the Rostock Motet Choir.Rostocker Motettenchor In 2008 the Hilliard Ensemble premiered Heiner Goebbels' avant-garde staged concert I went to the house but did not enter at the 2008 Edinburgh International Festival, repeated at the Berliner Festspiele.Heiner Goebbels mit dem Hilliard Ensemble Die Welt 19 November 2008 ===New music=== In 2009 the ensemble premiered five new works: Guido Morini's Una Iliade, Fabio Vacchi's Memoria Italiana, Steffen Schleiermacher's Die Beschw\u00f6rung der Trunkenen Oase, Simon Bainbridge's Tenebrae and Wolfgang Rihm's Et Lux.
