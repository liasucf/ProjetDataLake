Further festivals celebrated in this village are Manabasa Gurubara, Raja, Dasahara, Holi, Diwali and Dola festival. Manabasa Gurubara is the biggest festival celebrated in this village because the religion of the locals is Hindu. Manabasa Gurubara is celebrated for the goddess of Laxmi, the deity of wealth and prosperity. This festival is celebrated each Thursday in the month of Margasira, which is four times during the month. Women clean their houses and make jhoti chita from rice paste. It is believed that Laxmi visits each home on these days and gives blessings. There is a story about this festival in Laxmi Puran. Raja (festival), is another popular festival in this village, being for girls only. During this festival, girls wear new dresses, their best jewellery, eat all types of pitha, visit their friends, relatives and for two days of the festival the girls will not consume salt nor bathe. At this time large swings are hung from the banyan trees and the girls are encouraged to swing on them. All people abstain from walking barefoot on the earth and no work in the fields is allowed. The women do not grind, will not tear anything apart, will not cut anything and are relieved from cooking. This is also the time they expect to catch the eye of a young man and sing of how they will produce many healthy babies as this festival is linked to fertility, Mother Earth and the monsoon season. Dola festival is also celebrated by villagers on the day of Holi, and is similar to the better-known festival. An image, made specifically for this day, of Lord Krishna is taken to everyone's home on a wooden cart and is traditionally sprinkled with abira/phalgu (this is a red/violet powder made from the root of a species of curcuma and sapan wood). The villagers also play with abira themselves and on the day of Holi a similar coloured powder (traditionally made from dry leaves and sand) is scattered and smeared on each other's faces, along with the squirting of rose water at passers by. Typically both types of powder have been a similar colour (including the rose water), in modern times however powders of many colours (known simply as \"colour\") are used for this festival leading it to be also known as the Festival of Colours. There has been some concern about locally produced \"colour\" due to the lead content. Therefore, colour using more natural, less harmful dye elements are being called for. It is believed on this day Lord Krishna offers the first crop of mangoes from the trees for the almost year long devotion of his followers and their offerings to him. ==Sports== There is a cricket ground in the village where children can play cricket and other types of games, such as marbles, Kabaddi, and Gilli-danda. The people of Sisua also organize cricket tournaments every year to promote the sport and for both players and spectators to enjoy. ==See also== * Salepur * Oriya Literature * Oriya language * Odisha * Jagannath ==References== Category:Cuttack district ",
