The school has been housed in several different buildings over its lifetime, beginning in a small four-room cottage on St. Mary Street, then moving up to a slightly larger building which was destroyed by fire in 1929. Then the school moved into a large wood framed building donated by the Richey Family. The School/convent remained in that building until the early 1960s when a modern facility was completed on Fourth Street which houses the school to this day. In 2005 and 2006, the School was host to many students from Hurricane Katrina destroyed Catholic schools in the New Orleans area, including Redeemer Seton High. ==Demographics== The demographic breakdown of the 305 students enrolled for the 2013-2014 school year was: *Asian/Pacific islanders - 0.4% *Black - 13.1% *Hispanic - 1.6% *White - 84.9% ==Athletics== The school, despite its 1A status, offers a number of sports and after school programs, including football, soccer, power lifting, baseball, softball, basketball, cross-country, track, cheer and dance.
