    "text": "Night & Day is the third studio album by Canadian recording artist Keshia Chant\u00e9. The album is her first release under Tanjola Brand management Inc and Universal Music Group. Recording sessions for the album began in 2007, a year after her 2006 release, 2U, under Sony Music Canada. The album is a duo-album, with the 'Night' side (tracks 1-7) being dance-pop and the 'Day' side (tracks 8-14) being R&B.; This is the first album that Keshia controlled the creative side of the album, writing 10 out of 14 songs and executive producing ==Background== Keshia's previous album 2U (2006) was a commercial success and received generally favorable reviews from most music critics. The album featured 4 singles\u2014including the radio airplay Top 10 single \"Been Gone\". The album was failed to achieve the success as her debut album, \"Keshia Chant\u00e9\", which was certified Gold by the CRIA. After the release of the third single, Fallen, Chant\u00e9 refused to finish promoting her album to its full potential because of \"dirty label politics\" infuriating her to ask to be released from her record label. After a few months, her wish was granted and she was released from Sony BMG Canada. In 2007, after her departure from Sony BMG Canada, Chant\u00e9 took a brief absence from the spotlight, wanting to learn more about the music business and being mentored by respected entertainment lawyers in Hollywood and Toronto. She later made the decision to move to Atlanta and West Hollywood, where she worked closely the camps of Ne-Yo, Missy Elliott and OutKast. She began honing her skill as a songwriter and her acting chops, starring as the lead actress in the TV series \"Soul\". In September 2010, Chant\u00e9 announced that she would release a 2 disc album titled \"Night & Day\" slated for a release in Spring 2011. One disc, titled 'Night' will be all Dance music and the other disc, titled 'Day' will be R&B;, reminiscent of Chant\u00e9's first two albums. When looking for inspiration and the direction that she wanted for this album, she stated that wanted something with \"no-genre\", sing something that was real and to the heart. Keshia found inspiration from Brandy's Afrodisiac. ==Recording and music== In an interview with Sway Magazine, Keshia stated \u201cI was travelling all over New York, Miami and L.A., working with different writers and producers,\u201d she says. \u201cAt one point, I had 100 songs, but it still didn\u2019t feel like it was happening for me. This is the third album and I had more substantial things to say. So I came back to Toronto, assembled some musicians and a couple of writers and just let it flow.\u201d Keshia also stated that she had been in the studio with Ne-Yo and his camp of writers, as well as The Outsyders, who produced Britney Spears' \"Womanizer\", but feel she didn't find her own sound by working with them. In 2009, a song leaked by the title 'I Hope You Cry'. The song generated hype, as it was rumored to be from the Aaliyah biopic, which was obviously false. The song was produced by Atlanta-based producer, J-New. Singer Tiffany Evans recorded the song as well, but the first recording was done by Chante, which was confirmed by her in 2011. In 2010, when asked if the song will make the album via Ustream, she answered \"Yes\", although plans may have changed. In 2010, another track entitled 'Dead To Me' was leaked. The track was written by JC Smith, Keshia Chante and Roz Bell. Smith described the song before it leaked, stating \"\u2026think Madonna\u2019s \u2018Frozen\u2019 mixed with OneRepublic/Timbaland \u2018Apologize\u2019. Of course, those are just reference points\u2026this song is definitely it\u2019s own thing\u2026as it should be.\". Chante began working with Canadian producers VicPark after experimenting in US with many other producers. Chante stated \"I got into the studio with Vic Park and had a great time! We have crazy musical chemistry & I was able to find \"my\" sound. For the rest of the album, I did just that. Working with musicians and creating what I wanted as opposed to adding to music that already exists. The entire album process has been very organic.\" VicPark has credits on tracks such as \"If U Say\" and \"Test Drive\". In 2010, during a Ustream session with the fans, Chante previewed and early version of \"Table Dancer\" and VicPark produced track, \"Hang My Jersey Up\". \"Hang My Jersey Up\" was named as the first single from the album, but was later switched for \"Table Dancer\". During a later session, she previewed \"If U Say\". In September 2010, The singles for the album were confirmed as \"Table Dancer\" from the Night side of the album, and \"Test Drive\" from the single from the Day side of the album. \"Test Drive\" would later only be used for viral promotion. == Promotion == She promoted the album all around across Canada.
