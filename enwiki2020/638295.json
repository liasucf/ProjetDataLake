    "text": "Snufkin (original Swedish: Snusmumrik[en] or Mumrik[en], Finnish: Nuuskamuikkunen or Muikkunen) is a character in the Moomin series of books authored by Swedish-speaking Finn Tove Jansson, appearing in six of the nine books. He is the best friend of the series' protagonist, Moomintroll, and lives a nomadic lifestyle, only staying in Moominvalley in the spring and summer, but leaving for warmer climates down south every winter. He is the son of the elder Mymble and the Joxter, and is half-brother to the Mymble's daughter and Little My. Snufkin wears old green clothes and a wide-brimmed hat that he has had since birth. He lives in a tent, smokes a pipe and plays the harmonica. Snufkin also has a great dislike for authority figures such as the Park Keeper, and the many regulation signs and fences he erects. At one point, he sabotages the Park Keeper by planting Hattifatteners in his garden, causing them to grow and drive him out. He has a great hatred for all symbols of private property, even losing his temper with the Hemulen after the latter attempts to put up a sign declaring \"Moominvalley.\" His first appearance is in the second book, Comet in Moominland. The age of Snufkin is difficult to determine. He often enjoys playing with Moomintroll and other children, but on the other hand, he has more serious and adulty conversations with Moominpappa. His wisdom, life experience, and independence suggest that he would be an adult. In problem situations, others often turn to the help of Snufkin, as he enjoys the unreserved admiration of the inhabitants of the valley for his multi-consciousness. His advice is also followed. There are intersections with a wide range of philosophical views on the way Snufkin thinks. He is undoubtedly one of the most multi-faceted characters in Moomins. Snufkin has said that no one should own more than they can handle, and he cannot understand his friend Sniff\u2019s affection for things and worldly things. Snufkin once even throws his tent in the gorge, because he thinks it is not worth clinging to useless property, but instead can even write a poem when he sees something beautiful. Tove Jansson based the character of Snufkin on her friend and one-time fianc\u00e9, Atos Wirtanen. ==Reception== The character has a mostly positive reception. ==Notes== ==References== * * Category:Literary characters introduced in 1946 Category:Moomin characters Category:Fictional hoboes Category:Male characters in film Category:Male characters in animation Category:Male characters in comics Category:Male characters in literature ja:\u30b9\u30ca\u30d5\u30ad\u30f3 ",
