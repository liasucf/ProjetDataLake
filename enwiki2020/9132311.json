The 6-1, 185 pound Bork rewrote the Northern Illinois University football record book with some help from end Hugh Rohrschneider during his junior and senior years at the DeKalb school. In 1962, Bork broke 14 college passing records ranging from yardage gained to best completions percentage. The following year, he bettered 10 of his own records, tied one and set nine more for a total of 20. He also set a record of 244 pass completions during the 1963 NIU season. He was the first college quarterback at any level to throw for 3,000 yards in one season. Bork first played football at Arlington High School, where he was an all-conference selection. Offered a basketball scholarship to Michigan, the athlete turned it down because he wanted to play football. Bork played in 1964 to 1967 with the Montreal Alouettes in the Canadian Football League before signing with the Chicago Owls of the Continental Football League in 1968. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1999.
