The lizard is known as blue-tongue because its tongue can range from bright to dark blue, and it has a habit of displaying it prominently and hissing loudly when disturbed. The eastern blue-tongued lizard is a stout and slow lizard with brown to grey scales and a barred pattern across the body and tail. The underside is usually pale. Blue-tongued lizards are popular as pets and can live up to 30 years in captivity. They give birth to live young, between six and a record 20 per litter. The young consume the egg sac immediately after birth. They resemble the adult form closely. Several other types of blue- tongued lizard are in the genus Tiliqua, such as the northern blue-tongued skink and the shingleback or stump-tailed skink. This subspecies was first described as Lacerta scincoides, by the Irish surgeon and botanist John White. ==References== ==External links== *BlueTongueSkinks.net *Blue-tongued skinks, Melissa Kaplan's Herp Care Collection *Tiliqua scincoides , James Cook University Category:Skinks of Australia Category:Reptiles described in 1790 ",
