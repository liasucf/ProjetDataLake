The ship fulfilled its first task before it had actually entered service when on 15 March 2012 it returned a mirror that had been taken from after the Raid on the Medway.

In July 2018, the crew of HNLMS Holland ended a three-month drug patrol in the Dutch Caribbean with a visit to New York. While in the Caribbean Sea, Holland also performed coast guard duties.
