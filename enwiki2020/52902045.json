Because of this railroad junction, control of Corinth was of strategic importance during the American Civil War.Corinth Civil War Interpretive Center, Shiloh Military Park Retrieved 2017-01-16.

The depot is a one-story, wood frame building with a V-shaped floor plan, designed to accommodate the intersection of the two railways. The exterior walls have stucco veneer with brick wainscot. The two railways had separate brick portico entrances into the depot. Passengers, that arrived for departure, entered the depot on the opposite side of the building, in the crook of the V. The depot received its greatest usage during the 1930s and 1940s, when it served dozens of passenger trains.Corinth, Mississippi (Crossroads Museum), Town Square Publications Retrieved 2017-01-16.
