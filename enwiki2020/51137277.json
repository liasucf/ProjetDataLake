Both Principlist and Reformist camps are active in the province. Conservative Society of Seminary Teachers of Qom is the most prominent political organization headquartered in Qom. Its reformist rival, Assembly of Qom Seminary Scholars and Researchers, is also based in Qom. Qom serves as the main ideologic base of the Front of Islamic Revolution Stability (its spiritual leader, Mohammad Taghi Mesbah Yazdi also resides in Qom), which tends to dominate its political arena with concentration on ethnic issues, according to some spectators. Islamic Coalition Party and Front of Followers of the Line of the Imam and the Leader have active branches in the province. Provincial affiliates of NEDA Party, Democracy Party, Union of Islamic Iran People Party and Islamic Labour Party are among reformist organizations of the province, which has also a reformist \"policymaking council\". == Election results == {| class=\"wikitable\" class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin- left:1em; font-size: 90%\" |+ Presidential election results |- style=\"background:lightgrey;\" !
