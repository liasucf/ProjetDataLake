    "text": "Metr\u00f3 was a Hungarian rock band in the 1960s and early 1970s. Despite the Communist regime's condemnation of rock music, Metr\u00f3 found success and was able to release an album and appear on some television shows, as were their contemporaries Ill\u00e9s and Omega. The band broke up due to the difficulty of promoting their music under Communism. Some members of Metr\u00f3 later formed the long-running hard rock bands Taurus and Locomotiv GT. Band leader Zor\u00e1n Sztevanovity has pursued an active solo career. The band played reunion shows in 1992, 2001, and 2006. ==References== Category:Hungarian progressive rock groups Category:Musical groups established in 1960 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1972 ",
