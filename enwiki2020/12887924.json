    "text": "Pubowal is a village in Una district in the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. == History == The village is named after Pubo Mann, a commander in the reign of king Ram Singh of Jaijon Douaba. Ram Singh took over Jaijon in AD 1701. Pubo won a major battle fighting with Nadir Shah's military in 1739 and was awarded the land by Ram Singh. Originally from Bathinda, Punjab, Pubo brought his family, along with members of the Brahmin and other castes, to settle this village in the 1740s. He established the area as distinct village for the first time. The number of Brahmin residents has given rise to the production of laureates from the village at the time when nearby all villages comprised illiterate populations. After some time, the village was subdivided, leading to the creation of Bilna, Haleran, Aujle and Badewale. Those newer villages got their own panchayats recently. == Geography == Pubowal has an average elevation of 498 metres in the district Una of Himachal Pradesh which lies in its south western part.
