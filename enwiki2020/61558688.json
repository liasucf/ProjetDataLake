What follows is a list of organisms that require handling at the most stringent, biosafety level 4, protocol. Organisms include those harmful to human health, to animal health, or to plant health. The Plant Protection and Quarantine programs (PPQ) of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) are listed in 7 CFR Part 331. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) lists are located at 42 CFR Part 73.3 and 42 CFR Part 73.4. The USDA animal safety list is located at 9 CFR Subchapter B. ==Select agents== ===HHS human threats: select agents and toxins=== *Abrin *Bacillus cereus biovar anthracis* *Botulinum neurotoxins*,5 *Botulinum neurotoxin producing species of Clostridium* *Conotoxins (Short, paralytic alpha conotoxins containing the following amino acid sequence X1CCX2PACGX3X4X5X6CX7)1,5 *Coxiella burnetii *Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever orthonairovirus *Diacetoxyscirpenol *Eastern equine encephalitis virus *Ebolavirus *Francisella tularensis *Lassa mammarenavirus *Lujo mammarenavirus *Marburg virus *Monkeypox virus *Reconstructed 1918 influenza virus *Ricin *Rickettsia prowazekii *Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARSr-CoV) *Saxitoxin *Chapare mammarenavirus *Guanarito mammarenavirus *Argentinian mammarenavirus (formerly Jun\u00edn virus) *Machupo mammarenavirus *Brazilian mammarenavirus (formerly Sabi\u00e1 mammarenavirus) *Staphylococcal enterotoxins (subtypes A, B, C, D, E) *T-2 mycotoxin *Tetrodotoxin *Far Eastern subtype Flavivirus *Siberian subtype Flavivirus *Kyasanur Forest disease virus *Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus *Variola virus (Smallpox virus) *Variola virus minor (Alastrim) *Yersinia pestis ===HHS human or animal threats: select agents and toxins=== *Bacillus anthracis *Bacillus anthracis Pasteur strain *Brucella abortus *Brucella melitensis *Brucella suis *Burkholderia mallei *Burkholderia pseudomallei *Hendra henipavirus *Nipah henipavirus *Rift Valley fever phlebovirus *Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus === USDA select agents and toxins === *African horse sickness virus *African swine fever virus *Avian influenza virus *Pestivirus C (formerly Classical swine fever virus) *Foot-and-mouth disease virus *Goatpox virus *Lumpy skin disease virus *Mycoplasma capricolum *Mycoplasma mycoides *Avian avulavirus 1 (formerly Newcastle disease virus) *Small ruminant morbillivirus (formerly peste des petits ruminants virus) *Rinderpest morbillivirus *Sheeppox virus *Swine vesicular disease virus === PPQ select agents and toxins === *Coniothyrium glycines (formerly Phoma glycinicola and Pyrenochaeta glycines) *Peronosclerospora philippinensis *Peronosclerospora sacchari *Ralstonia solanacearum *Rathayibacter toxicus *Sclerophthora rayssiae *Synchytrium endobioticum *Xanthomonas oryzae ==References== Category:Safety Category:Biological hazards Category:Biosafety level 4 laboratories Category:Infectious disease-related lists ",
