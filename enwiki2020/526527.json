The Stoop, his name given to the ground His association with Harlequins lasted from his debut against Oxford University in November 1901 until 1950 when he ended his 30-year stint as president of the club. He played his last game in Quins colours in 1939, at the age of 56. He made 182 appearances in total, captained the side 143 times and scored 86 tries, being club captain for 8 consecutive seasons from 1906/07 to 1913/14. Stoop was born on 27 March 1883 in Cromwell Road, London. His father was Dutch and his mother was half Scottish/half Irish. He went to Dover College in 1896 and on to Rugby School in 1898, where he played for the school team, and then to Oxford University, where he was captain of the rugby team in 1904. It was whilst he was still at Rugby school that he was asked to join Harlequins. He had also been approached by Blackheath, who at the time were a bigger name than Quins, but he decided to accept the offer from Quins. In 1905, Stoop made his debut for England against Scotland and it was also against Scotland that he earned the last of his 15 caps in 1912. During this time he captained the national side twice, including the first ever international played at Twickenham in 1910. Had it not been for a broken collarbone in 1907 he would have added to his international appearances. Stoop is widely credited with revolutionising back play. Previously, the two half backs were designated as \"left and right\", but Stoop incorporated ideas already being used in Wales and New Zealand to introduce the concept of the Scrum Half and Outside Half. He used these ideas to great success for both Harlequins and England. As well as being club captain from 1906\u20131914, Stoop was secretary from 1905\u201314 and from 1920-38 as well as president from 1920\u20131950.

He is buried at Hartley Wintney, Hampshire, where he had lived for many years. == References == * Immortal Harlequin: The Story of Adrian Stoop by Ian Cooper (2004) Category:1883 births Category:1957 deaths Category:People from Kensington Category:English rugby union players Category:England international rugby union players Category:People educated at Dover College Category:People educated at Rugby School Category:Alumni of University College, Oxford Category:Barbarian F.C. players Category:Harlequin F.C. players Category:Oxford University RFC players Category:English people of Dutch descent Category:Middlesex County RFU players ",
