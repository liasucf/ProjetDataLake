Bantamweight Vladimir Nikitin was given a unanimous decision against Ireland's World champion Michael Conlon in the quarterfinal of the tournament judges all scoring for the Russian in rounds one and three. Afterwards, in an irate television interview, Conlon claimed AIBA (www.aiba.org) were cheats and had been paid to fix fights. In order to reach the quarterfinal bout with Conlon, Nikitin was controversially awarded the win by split decision when he fought Thailand's Chatchai Butdee. According to the Bangkok Post, Butdee was quoted as saying, \"I should have won the fight. I think I was more on target. I do not really understand the judges' decisions\". The day after the quarterfinal AIBA denied these allegations however removed several Judges and Referees for the panel for the rest of the games over irregularities in scoring. They also stated decisions will stand. Russia Category:Boxing in Russia Category:Amateur boxing organizations ",
