The Armitage \"sanitary pottery manufacture\" became a successful toilet manufacturer in the United Kingdom. In 1907, Armitage Ware Limited was incorporated. In 1969, Armitage merged with Shanks Holdings Limited, a competing \"sanitary engineering company\" established at Barrhead near Glasgow, Renfrewshire in 1878, producing the famous brand name Armitage Shanks. In 1980, Armitage Shanks was purchased by Blue Circle Industries, and in February 1999, Blue Circle sold its bathroom division (consisting of Armitage Shanks and the Italian Ceramica Dolomite) to United States based American Standard Companies for US$430 million. Following this purchase, the Armitage Shanks brand continued in the United Kingdom, and their former export markets.
