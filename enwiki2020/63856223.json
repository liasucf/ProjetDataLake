    "text": "The Portrait of Prince Alessandro Farnese is a painting by the 16th-century artist Sofonisba Anguissola. It depicts the prince, later the Duke of Parma and Piacenza, as 15-year old boy, dressed in refined courtly clothing. Prince Alessandro was the son of Ottavio Farnese, Duke of Parma, and the grandson of King Charles V of Spain. The portrait was painted in and now hangs in the National Gallery of Ireland. The painting was purchased by the National Gallery of Ireland in 1864. At the time it was attributed to Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello, but later study of the painting revealed it to be the work of Anguissola. The reattribution revealed this to have been the first painting by a female artist to enter the gallery's collection. == References == Farnese, Alessandro Category:Collection of the National Gallery of Ireland Category:1560s paintings ",
