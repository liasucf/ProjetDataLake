    "text": "The flag that the color is named after Navajo White is an orangish white color, or pastel yellow orange, and derives its name from its similarity to the background color of the Navajo Nation flag. The name \"Navajo White\" is usually only used when referring to paint. As the name indicates, the color is often considered a shade of white, even though it is more properly categorized as a yellow. From the 1970s to the 1990s it was, along with the color bone, one of the standard interior paint colors used in many tract homes in the United States and especially apartment complexes as, like the color bone, it does not easily show stains from cigarette smoke or fingerprints. In recent years it has lost favor to other shades of off-white, grey, and pastel colors. ==Trivia== In 1989, the color \"Navajo white\" was included in the X11 color list. As such, it became and continues to be (2019) part of the web colors. ==References== ==See also== *List of colors Category:Shades of white Category:Shades of yellow Category:Shades of orange Category:Navajo Nation ",
