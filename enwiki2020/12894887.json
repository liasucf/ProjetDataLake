It was originally a publication of the H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh Communist Youth Union (Vietnamese: \u0110o\u00e0n Thanh ni\u00ean C\u1ed9ng s\u1ea3n H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh) of Ho Chi Minh City, and while it is still the official mouthpiece of that organization, it has grown to become the largest newspaper in the country . As of 2007 its daily circulation was 450,000. The printed newspaper includes: Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb daily, weekly Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb Cu\u1ed1i Tu\u1ea7n, semimonthly Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb C\u01b0\u1eddi. Online versions includes: a Vietnamese version Tu\u1ed5i Tr\u1ebb Online and an English version Tuoi Tre News. ==History== Tuoi Tre Newspaper was officially established on September 2, 1975. However, its precursor was propaganda leaflets issued by students and pupils in Saigon during their anti-American movements in the Vietnam War. In its early stage, Tuoi Tre circulated tri- weekly. On September 1, 2000, it started to issue one more on Friday. From April 2, 2006, it became a daily newspaper. ==Offices== Its headquarters is located on 60A, Ho\u00e0ng V\u0103n Th\u1ee5 street, Ward 9, Ph\u00fa Nhu\u1eadn District, in the urban area of Ho Chi Minh City and not so far from Tan Son Nhat International Airport. Tuoi Tre has 8 representative offices in Hanoi at 72A Thuy Khue street (currently at 15 Doc Ngu street - Ba Dinh district while the building at Thuy Khue street is under reconstruction), Ngh\u1ec7 An, Hu\u1ebf, \u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng, Qui Nh\u01a1n, Nha Trang, \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t, and C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1. ==Stance== Described as \"pro-reformist\" by the BBC, the newspaper had run into trouble with the communist authorities several times. In May 1991, its editor in chief was sacked when the paper ran an article trepidly acknowledging Ho Chi Minh's early marriage to Zeng Xueming. Ms. Vu Kim Hanh, former Tuoi Tre Newspaper's editorial direction, was dismissed for lack of serious \"demerit\". Mr Le Van Nuoi, who was the Ho Chi Minh City Community Assistant at that time, had to dismiss her and managed the office until he completed his term of office at Ho Chi Minh City Community. In 2000, it commissioned a survey among youths in Ho Chi Minh City which found out that Bill Gates is more admired than Ho Chi Minh. This resulted in the published copies being destroyed by state censors and the three editors harshly sanctioned. In 2005, the newspaper published a series of investigative articles about the monopolization of the pharmaceutical market by Zuellig Pharma. The reporter, Lan Anh, was subsequently disciplined and discharged. In July 2018, the government suspended the newspaper from publishing online for 3 months and fined it 220 million VND. The disciplinary action came after the newspaper published an article on June 19, 2018 quoting President Tr\u1ea7n \u0110\u1ea1i Quang agreeing with the need for a new law regarding protests and left in place a reader's comment in another article published back on May 26, 2017 that was deemed to be \"splitting national unity\" by the Press Authority. The Press Authority determined that the content of the article quoting the President was \"untrue\" and \"caused severe impact\". ==See also== * List of newspapers in Vietnam * Media of Vietnam ==References== ==External links== *English version Tuoi Tre News *Vietnamese version Tuoi Tre Online *Tuoi Tre TV * Tuoi Tre Cuoi Online: Tuoi Tre Cuoi Category:Newspapers published in Vietnam Category:Vietnamese-language newspapers Category:English-language newspapers published in Asia Category:Mass media in Ho Chi Minh City ",
