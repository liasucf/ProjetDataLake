    "text": "Deniliquin Council was a local government area in the Riverina region of south-western New South Wales, Australia. At the date of its abolition, Deniliquin Council was the last rural local government area in New South Wales left consisting only of a rural town. Deniliquin Council was proclaimed as the Municipality of Deniliquin on 16 December 1868. ==Amalgamation== A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the Deniliquin Council merge with the Conargo Shire to form a new council with an area of and support a population of approximately 9,000. On 12 March 2016, Deniliquin Council was abolished and, along with the former Conargo Shire, the area incorporated into the new Edward River Council. == Council == ===Composition and election method=== The last election was due to be held on 8 September 2012.
