It is divided from the inland Yeongseo region by the Taebaek Mountains. Although Yeongseo describes the western half of the two provinces and Gwandong describes both halves together, \"Yeongdong\" is used much more frequently in South Korea than either of the other two names, and may be taken loosely to refer to the entire region. The region's name lends itself to the Yeongdong Railway Line and Yeongdong Expressway, which are major transportation corridors connecting Seoul to Gangwon. ==See also== *Regions of Korea *Yeongnam *List of Korea-related topics Category:Regions of Korea ",
