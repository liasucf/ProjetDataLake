    "text": "Marjaniemi Lighthouse () is a lighthouse located in the village of Marjaniemi at the westernmost point of Hailuoto island on the Gulf of Bothnia. The lighthouse is located approximately west of Oulu. The lighthouse was designed by Axel Hampus Dalstr\u00f6m as his fourth lighthouse and it was first lit in 1872. The tower is brick masonry, and has 110 steps inside with no intermediate floors. Originally the light was equipped with a Fresnel lens system, and it displayed a white light towards a sector clockwise from south to northeast. There were two lighthouse keepers and a master until 1962 when the lighthouse was automated. A pilot station was built next to the tower, currently the pilot station serves as a hotel. The lighthouse also houses a smaller sector light that is used to guide vessels to and from the fishing harbour. Today the lighthouse also houses a webcam. == References == ==External links== *Lighthouse Webcam Category:Lighthouses completed in 1872 Category:Gulf of Bothnia Category:Lighthouses in Finland Category:Hailuoto Category:Buildings and structures in Northern Ostrobothnia ",
