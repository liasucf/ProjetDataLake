(A) The Akhmediev breather; (B) the Peregrine breather; (C) the Kuznetsov\u2013Ma breather.Figure 1 from: In theoretical physics, the (one-dimensional) nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation (NLSE) is a nonlinear variation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. It is a classical field equation whose principal applications are to the propagation of light in nonlinear optical fibers and planar waveguides and to Bose\u2013Einstein condensates confined to highly anisotropic cigar-shaped traps, in the mean-field regime. Additionally, the equation appears in the studies of small-amplitude gravity waves on the surface of deep inviscid (zero-viscosity) water; the Langmuir waves in hot plasmas; the propagation of plane-diffracted wave beams in the focusing regions of the ionosphere; the propagation of Davydov's alpha-helix solitons, which are responsible for energy transport along molecular chains; and many others. More generally, the NLSE appears as one of universal equations that describe the evolution of slowly varying packets of quasi-monochromatic waves in weakly nonlinear media that have dispersion. Unlike the linear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, the NLSE never describes the time evolution of a quantum state. The 1D NLSE is an example of an integrable model. In quantum mechanics, the 1D NLSE is a special case of the classical nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger field, which in turn is a classical limit of a quantum Schr\u00f6dinger field. Conversely, when the classical Schr\u00f6dinger field is canonically quantized, it becomes a quantum field theory (which is linear, despite the fact that it is called \u2033quantum nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation\u2033) that describes bosonic point particles with delta-function interactions \u2014 the particles either repel or attract when they are at the same point. In fact, when the number of particles is finite, this quantum field theory is equivalent to the Lieb\u2013Liniger model. Both the quantum and the classical 1D nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equations are integrable. Of special interest is the limit of infinite strength repulsion, in which case the Lieb\u2013Liniger model becomes the Tonks\u2013Girardeau gas (also called the hard- core Bose gas, or impenetrable Bose gas). In this limit, the bosons may, by a change of variables that is a continuum generalization of the Jordan\u2013Wigner transformation, be transformed to a system one-dimensional noninteracting spinless fermions. The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a simplified 1+1-dimensional form of the Ginzburg\u2013Landau equation introduced in 1950 in their work on superconductivity, and was written down explicitly by in their study of optical beams. Multi-dimensional version replaces the second spatial derivative by the Laplacian. In more than one dimension, the equation is not integrable, it allows for a collapse and wave turbulence. == Equation == The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation, applicable to classical and quantum mechanics. === Classical equation === The classical field equation (in dimensionless form) is:. Originally in: Teoreticheskaya i Matematicheskaya Fizika 19(3): 332\u2013343. June 1974. for the complex field \u03c8(x,t). This equation arises from the Hamiltonian :H=\\int \\mathrm{d}x \\left[{1\\over 2}|\\partial_x\\psi|^2+{\\kappa \\over 2}|\\psi|^4\\right] with the Poisson brackets :\\\\{\\psi(x),\\psi(y)\\\\}=\\\\{\\psi^*(x),\\psi^*(y)\\\\}=0 \\, :\\\\{\\psi^*(x),\\psi(y)\\\\}=i\\delta(x-y). \\, Unlike its linear counterpart, it never describes the time evolution of a quantum state. The case with negative \u03ba is called focusing and allows for bright soliton solutions (localized in space, and having spatial attenuation towards infinity) as well as breather solutions. It can be solved exactly by use of the inverse scattering transform, as shown by (see below). The other case, with \u03ba positive, is the defocusing NLS which has dark soliton solutions (having constant amplitude at infinity, and a local spatial dip in amplitude). === Quantum mechanics === To get the quantized version, simply replace the Poisson brackets by commutators :\\begin{align} {}[\\psi(x),\\psi(y)] &= [\\psi^*(x),\\psi^*(y)] = 0\\\\\\ {}[\\psi^*(x),\\psi(y)] &= -\\delta(x-y) \\end{align} and normal order the Hamiltonian :H=\\int dx \\left[{1\\over 2}\\partial_x\\psi^\\dagger\\partial_x\\psi+{\\kappa \\over 2}\\psi^\\dagger\\psi^\\dagger\\psi\\psi\\right]. The quantum version was solved by Bethe ansatz by Lieb and Liniger. Thermodynamics was described by Chen-Ning Yang. Quantum correlation functions also were evaluated by Korepin in 1993. The model has higher conservation laws - Davies and Korepin in 1989 expressed them in terms of local fields. == Solving the equation == The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is integrable in 1d: solved it with the inverse scattering transform. The corresponding linear system of equations is known as the Zakharov\u2013Shabat system: : \\begin{align} \\phi_x &= J\\phi\\Lambda+U\\phi \\\\\\ \\phi_t &= 2J\\phi\\Lambda^2+2U\\phi\\Lambda+(JU^2-JU_x)\\phi, \\end{align} where : \\Lambda = \\begin{pmatrix} \\lambda_1&0\\\\\\ 0&\\lambda_2 \\end{pmatrix} , \\quad J = i\\sigma_z = \\begin{pmatrix} i&0\\\\\\ 0&-i \\end{pmatrix} , \\quad U = i \\begin{pmatrix} 0&q;\\\\\\ r&0 \\end{pmatrix}. The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation arises as compatibility condition of the Zakharov\u2013Shabat system: : \\phi_{xt}=\\phi_{tx} \\quad \\Rightarrow \\quad U_t=-JU_{xx}+2JU^2U \\quad \\Leftrightarrow \\quad \\begin{cases} iq_t=q_{xx}+2qrq \\\\\\ ir_t=-r_{xx}-2qrr. \\end{cases} \\, By setting q = r* or q = \u2212 r* the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with attractive or repulsive interaction is obtained. An alternative approach uses the Zakharov\u2013Shabat system directly and employs the following Darboux transformation: : \\begin{align} & \\phi \\to \\phi[1]=\\phi\\Lambda-\\sigma\\phi \\\\\\ & U \\to U[1]=U+[J,\\sigma] \\\\\\ & \\sigma = \\varphi\\Omega\\varphi^{-1} \\end{align} which leaves the system invariant. Here, \u03c6 is another invertible matrix solution (different from \u03d5) of the Zakharov\u2013Shabat system with spectral parameter \u03a9: : \\begin{align} \\varphi_x &= J\\varphi\\Omega+U\\varphi \\\\\\ \\varphi_t &= 2J\\varphi\\Omega^2+2U\\varphi\\Omega+(JU^2-JU_x)\\varphi. \\end{align} Starting from the trivial solution U = 0 and iterating, one obtains the solutions with n solitons. The NLS equation is a partial differential equation like the Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation. Usually it does not have analytic solution and the same numerical methods used to solve the Gross\u2013Pitaevskii equation, such as the split-step Crank\u2013Nicolson and Fourier spectral methods, are used for its solution. There are different Fortran and C programs for its solution . == Galilean invariance == The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is Galilean invariant in the following sense: Given a solution \u03c8(x, t) a new solution can be obtained by replacing x with x + vt everywhere in \u03c8(x, t) and by appending a phase factor of e^{-iv(x+vt/2)}\\,: :\\psi(x,t) \\mapsto \\psi_{[v]}(x,t)=\\psi(x+vt,t)\\; e^{-iv(x+vt/2)}. == The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation in fiber optics == In optics, the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation occurs in the Manakov system, a model of wave propagation in fiber optics. The function \u03c8 represents a wave and the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the propagation of the wave through a nonlinear medium. The second-order derivative represents the dispersion, while the \u03ba term represents the nonlinearity. The equation models many nonlinearity effects in a fiber, including but not limited to self-phase modulation, four-wave mixing, second- harmonic generation, stimulated Raman scattering, optical solitons, ultrashort pulses, etc. == The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation in water waves == hyperbolic secant (sech) envelope soliton for surface waves on deep water. Blue line: water waves. Red line: envelope soliton. For water waves, the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation describes the evolution of the envelope of modulated wave groups. In a paper in 1968, Vladimir E. Zakharov describes the Hamiltonian structure of water waves. In the same paper Zakharov shows, that for slowly modulated wave groups, the wave amplitude satisfies the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, approximately. Originally in: Zhurnal Prikdadnoi Mekhaniki i Tekhnicheskoi Fiziki 9 (2): 86\u201394, 1968.] The value of the nonlinearity parameter \u043a depends on the relative water depth. For deep water, with the water depth large compared to the wave length of the water waves, \u043a is negative and envelope solitons may occur. For shallow water, with wavelengths longer than 4.6 times the water depth, the nonlinearity parameter \u043a is positive and wave groups with envelope solitons do not exist. In shallow water surface-elevation solitons or waves of translation do exist, but they are not governed by the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation is thought to be important for explaining the formation of rogue waves. The complex field \u03c8, as appearing in the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation, is related to the amplitude and phase of the water waves. Consider a slowly modulated carrier wave with water surface elevation \u03b7 of the form: : \\eta = a(x_0,t_0)\\; \\cos \\left[ k_0\\, x_0 - \\omega_0\\, t_0 - \\theta(x_0,t_0) \\right], where a(x0, t0) and \u03b8(x0, t0) are the slowly modulated amplitude and phase. Further \u03c90 and k0 are the (constant) angular frequency and wavenumber of the carrier waves, which have to satisfy the dispersion relation \u03c90 = \u03a9(k0). Then : \\psi = a\\; \\exp \\left( i \\theta \\right). So its modulus |\u03c8| is the wave amplitude a, and its argument arg(\u03c8) is the phase \u03b8. The relation between the physical coordinates (x0, t0) and the (x, t) coordinates, as used in the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation given above, is given by: : x = k_0 \\left[ x_0 - \\Omega'(k_0)\\; t_0 \\right], \\quad t = k_0^2 \\left[ -\\Omega(k_0) \\right]\\; t_0 Thus (x, t) is a transformed coordinate system moving with the group velocity \u03a9'(k0) of the carrier waves, The dispersion-relation curvature \u03a9\"(k0) \u2013 representing group velocity dispersion \u2013 is always negative for water waves under the action of gravity, for any water depth. For waves on the water surface of deep water, the coefficients of importance for the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation are: :\\kappa = - 2 k_0^2, \\quad \\Omega(k_0) = \\sqrt{g k_0} = \\omega_0 \\,\\\\! so \\Omega'(k_0) = \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\omega_0}{k_0}, \\quad \\Omega(k_0) = -\\frac{1}{4} \\frac{\\omega_0}{k_0^2}, \\,\\\\! where g is the acceleration due to gravity at the Earth's surface. In the original (x0,t0) coordinates the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation for water waves reads: :i\\, \\partial_{t_0} A + i\\, \\Omega'(k_0)\\, \\partial_{x_0} A + \\tfrac12 \\Omega(k_0)\\, \\partial_{x_0 x_0} A - u\\, |A|^2\\, A = 0, with A=\\psi^* (i.e. the complex conjugate of \\psi) and u=\\kappa\\, k_0^2\\, \\Omega(k_0). So u = \\tfrac12 \\omega_0 k_0^2 for deep water waves. == Gauge equivalent counterpart == NLSE (1) is gauge equivalent to the following isotropic Landau-Lifshitz equation (LLE) or Heisenberg ferromagnet equation :\\vec{S}_t=\\vec{S}\\wedge \\vec{S}_{xx}. \\qquad Note that this equation admits several integrable and non-integrable generalizations in 2 + 1 dimensions like the Ishimori equation and so on. == Relation to vortices == showed that the work of on vortex filaments is closely related to the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. Subsequently, used this correspondence to show that breather solutions can also arise for a vortex filament. == See also == * AKNS system * Eckhaus equation * Quartic interaction for a related model in quantum field theory * Soliton (optics) * Logarithmic Schr\u00f6dinger equation == Notes == == References == === Notes === === Other === * * * * * == External links == * * Tutorial lecture on Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation (video). * Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with a Cubic Nonlinearity at EqWorld: The World of Mathematical Equations. * Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation with a Power-Law Nonlinearity at EqWorld: The World of Mathematical Equations. * Nonlinear Schrodinger Equation of General Form at EqWorld: The World of Mathematical Equations. * Mathematical aspects of the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation at Dispersive Wiki Category:Partial differential equations Category:Exactly solvable models Category:Schr\u00f6dinger equation Category:Integrable systems ",
