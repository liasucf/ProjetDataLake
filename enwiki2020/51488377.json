    "text": "Daniel Griffith (born September 29, 1987), known by his stage name Gryffin (often stylized as GRYFFIN), is an American musician, DJ, and music producer. He gained recognition for remixing some well-known songs such as Tove Lo's \"Talking Body\", Maroon 5's \"Animals\" and Years & Years' \"Desire\". == Background == Gryffin was born in San Francisco, California. Gryffin grew up as a classically trained pianist and learned to play the guitar at an early age. He played in bands to initially hone his instrumental abilities. He studied electrical engineering at the University of Southern California where he spent much of his leisure time in his dorm room to work on music. When asked on his key lessons of music production, he said: \"At the beginning, I just released music with the main goal of having my friends play it at college parties and I never would have imagined it would get to this point\". He made his 'world' debut as Gryffin at the SnowGlobe Music Festival 2015. He moved to Los Angeles to be closer to his label and management. == History == ===2016=== On January 22, 2016, Gryffin released his debut single titled \"Heading Home\" featuring Australian singer Josef Salvat via Darkroom/Interscope Records. On May 2, 2016, an official music video was uploaded on his YouTube channel. The song peaked at number 22 on the Hot Dance/Electronic Songs chart, number 21 on the Dance/Electronic Digital Songs chart, number 1 on Spotify Viral 50 chart and number 5 on the Billboard Twitter Emerging Artists chart. On August 26, 2016, he released a song titled \"Whole Heart\" with Bipolar Sunshine. In an interview, about the song \"Whole Heart\", Gryffin said \"'Whole Heart\u2019 is a big step for me as an artist, as it represents a developing maturity of my sound and depth of songwriting\". ===2017=== 2017 saw three singles for Gryffin. \"Feel Good\", a collaboration with DJ Illenium and singer Daya, was released on March 3. \"Love in Ruins\" with singer Sin\u00e9ad Harnett was released on July 7 and \"Nobody Compares to You\" with Katie Pearlman was released on October 6. ===2018=== 2018 proved to be a big year for Gryffin, releasing five singles throughout the year.
