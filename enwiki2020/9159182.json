(2016): Phylogenetic Relationships of Five Asian Schilbid Genera Including Clupisoma (Siluriformes: Schilbeidae). PLoS ONE, 11 (1): e0145675. These fish tend to swim in open water. Schilbid catfishes usually have dorsal fins with a short base and a spine, but Parailia lack a dorsal fin altogether. Most species also possess an adipose fin. The base of the anal fin is very long. There are usually four pairs of barbels. Several species lack anal fins. The family name is sometimes spelled Schilbidae in scientific literature. ==References== Category:Fish of Africa Category:Fish of Asia Category:Catfish families Category:Taxa named by Pieter Bleeker ",
