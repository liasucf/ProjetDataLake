    "text": "Cold Water Music is the debut studio album by British musician Aim, released on 11 October 1999 by Grand Central Records. The album was re-issued in 2007 by ATIC Records. ==Song information== The first track, \"Intro\", contains a sample from the documentary Hoop Dreams (1994) of William Gates, one of the basketball players followed in the film, speaking from his recovery room after surgery. The commentary forms the lyrics to the track. The track \"Cold Water Music\" contains a sample of \"Maureen in the Desert\", written by Carter Burwell and taken from the soundtrack to the film Psycho III (1986). The extended dialogue in the track \"Demonique\" was sampled from the John Carpenter horror films, Halloween (1978) and Halloween II (1981). It features (primarily) the exchanges between the characters of Dr. Sam Loomis (Donald Pleasence) and Sheriff Leigh Brackett (Charles Cyphers). The track \"Ain't Got Time to Waste\" is featured on the soundtrack of the European version of the video game Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits for Cold Water Music adapted from album liner notes. * Aim \u2013 arrangement, production, scratching, sleeve design Additional musicians * A.G. \u2013 performance * Q'n'C \u2013 performance * Kate Rogers \u2013 performance * Josef Ward \u2013 horns * YZ \u2013 performance Production * Mike Ball \u2013 engineering (assistant) * Steve Christian \u2013 engineering, mixing * Nilesh Patel \u2013 mastering Design * Nick Fry \u2013 artwork, design * Benge Newman \u2013 liner notes * Tony Stone \u2013 photography * Phil Turner \u2013 photography ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" !scope=\"col\"| Chart (1999) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:1999 debut albums Category:Aim (musician) albums Category:Grand Central Records albums ",
