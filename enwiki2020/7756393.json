    "text": "\u00c9cole Centrale de P\u00e9kin (ECPk) is a Sino-French engineering school in the centre of Beijing, China. It was established in 2005 by the initiative of the \u00c9coles Centrales Network, a group of France's leading graduate schools in engineering research and education including the prestigious \u00c9cole Centrale Paris, together with China's Beihang University - the nation's top research institution in the field of aeronautics and astronautics. ==History== In 2004, an agreement was signed by the \u00c9coles Centrales and Beihang University to create the \u00c9cole Centrale de P\u00e9kin, which was then founded in 2005 in Beijing. In line with the Centrale education model which promotes close ties with the industry, the school signed partnerships with several major corporations in France and China, such as Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, Alstom, Airbus, Schlumberger, Orange S.A., Safran, PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn, COMAC, Total, and Ernst & Young, which have committed to support the institution's development as founding partners. Their contributions are to include defining the school's education strategy as well as providing financial support, research cooperation, industrial training, and publicity. \u00c9cole Centrale Beijing was inaugurated in September 2005 by Herv\u00e9 Biausser, director of Ecole Centrale Paris (now CentraleSup\u00e9lec) and representative of the \u00c9coles Centrales. The first class of students graduated in January 2012. ==Admission== It recruits 100 students each year among the best of the Chinese education system, after the nation's intensive university entrance examinations (Gaokao, \u9ad8\u8003). ==Training== Most lessons are conducted in French, and the training lasts 6 years, after which graduates receive a master's degree from the Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (Beihang University) and the French dipl\u00f4me d'ing\u00e9nieur. The first three years correspond to preparatory classes similar to the French classes pr\u00e9paratoires and are based on 4 domains: language, mathematics, physical sciences, and industrial engineering. The last three years correspond to the \"generalist\" engineer curriculum followed by the \u00c9coles Centrales. Some of the specialization options include Materials Science, Computer Science, Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Physics, Aeronautical Engineering, and Aerospace Science. International exchange programs are also being planned as part of the curriculum. ==External links== * Official website Category:Educational institutions established in 2005 Pekin Category:Universities and colleges in Beijing Category:Engineering universities and colleges in China Category:2005 establishments in China ",
