Putatively he was a soldier in the army of Charlemagne. The church has undergone at least two major reconstructions: once in 1440, when it was rebuilt in Gothic style, and the church we see today, reconstructed under the archbishop Federico Borromeo starting in 1625.Guida di Milano, Parte prima contenente la descrizione della citta, Volume 1 (1818), page 151. For example, the facade was designed by Fabio Mangone from 1628 to 1634 with the two tall Corinthian pilasters. The portico was added in later centuries. In the center of the facade, above the window is the Latin word for \"humility\" below two crowns, part of the crest of the Borromeo family, whose main family palace in Milan stands across the square. In front of the church is a statue of Saint Charles Borromeo by Dionigi Bussola. Inside the apse chapel on the right, was dedicated to the Holy Family, and was a private chapel for the Borromeo family. On the left there is a small chapel designed in 1859 by Carlo Cerada and dedicated to the Madonna del Parto (Our Lady of Childbirth) with a fresco above the altar attributed to Michelino da Besozzo. On the right of the nave is an altar dedicated to Saint Renato, which contains his relics. The Organ was constructed by Eugenio Biroldi in 1827. The polychrome marble main altar dates to 1625\u20131629. ==References== Category:871 establishments Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 1634 Category:Baroque architecture in Milan Maria Category:17th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:1634 establishments in Italy Category:9th- century establishments in Italy Category:Gothic architecture in Milan ",
