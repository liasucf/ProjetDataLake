His name is also spelt Eochaidh, Eochy, and his epithet is variously spelled Feidleach, Feidhleach, Feidlioch, Feidhlioch. son of Finn, son of Fionnlogh, son of Rogen Ruad, son of Essamain Emna, son of Blathnachta, son of Labraid Lorc, son of Enna Aignech was, according to medieval Irish legends and historical traditions, a High King of Ireland. He is best known as the father of the legendary queen Medb of Connacht. According to the 12th century Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn, he took power when he defeated the previous High King, Fachtna F\u00e1thach, in the Battle of Leitir R\u00faaid.R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 299 The Middle Irish saga Cath Leitrech Ruibhe tells the story of this battle. While Fachtna F\u00e1thach was away from Tara on a visit to Ulster, Eochu, then king of Connacht, raised an army, had the provincial kings killed and took hostages from Tara. When news reached Fachtna at Emain Macha, he raised an army of Ulstermen and gave battle at Leitir R\u00faaid in the Corann (modern County Sligo),Joseph O'Neill (ed. & trans), \"Cath Boinde\", \u00c9riu 2, 1905, pp. 173-185 but was defeated and beheaded by Eochu. Eochaid S\u00e1lbuide, the king of Ulster, was also killed. Fergus mac R\u00f3ich covered the Ulster army's retreat, and Eochu marched to Tara.Margaret C. Dobs (ed. & trans.), \"La Bataille de Leitir Ruibhe\", Revue Celtique 39, 1922, pp. 1-32 Various Middle Irish tales give him a large family. His wife was Cloithfinn,Margaret C. Dobs (ed. & trans.), \"Cath Cumair\", Revue Celtique 43, 1926, pp. 277-342 and they had six daughters, Derbriu, Eile, Mugain, Eithne, Clothru and Medb, and four sons, a set of triplets known as the three findemna, and Conall Anglondach. Derbriu was the lover of Aengus of the Tuatha D\u00e9 Danann. Her mother-in-law, Garbdalb, turned six men into pigs for the crime of eating nuts from her grove, and Derbriu protected them for a year until they were killed by Medb.Edward Gwynn (ed. & trans.), The Metrical Dindshenchas Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 1906, Vol 3, Poem 70: Duma Selga, pp. 387-395 When Conchobar mac Nessa became king of Ulster, Eochu gave four of his daughters, Mugain, Eithne, Clothru and Medb, to him in marriage in compensation for the death of his supposed father, Fachtna F\u00e1thach. Eithne bore him a son, Furbaide, who was born by posthumous caesarian section after Medb drowned her. Clothru, according to one tradition, bore him his eldest son Cormac Cond Longas, although other traditions make him the son of Conchobar by his own mother, Ness. Medb bore Conchobar a son called Amalgad, but later left him, and Eochu set her up as queen of Connacht. Some time after that, Eochu held an assembly at Tara, which both Conchobar and Medb attended. The morning after the assembly, Conchobar followed Medb down to the river Boyne where she had gone to bathe, and raped her. Eochu made war against Conchobar on the Boyne, but was defeated. The three findemna tried to overthrow their father in the Battle of Druimm Criaich. The night before the battle, their sister Clothru, afraid that they would die without an heir, seduced all three of them, and the future High King Lugaid Riab nDerg, was conceived. The next day they were killed, and their father, seeing their severed heads, swore that no son should directly succeed his father to the High Kingship of Ireland.Gwynn, The Metrical Dindshenchas Vol 4, Druimm Criaich Poem 13: Druimm Criach, pp. 43-57; Vernam Hull, (ed. & trans.), \"Aided Meidbe: The Violent Death of Medb\" , Speculum v.13 issue 1, Jan 1938, pp. 52-61; O'Neill, \"Cath Boinde\"; Dobs, \"Cath Cumair\" He ruled for twelve years, and died of natural causes at Tara, succeeded by his brother Eochu Airem. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with the dictatorship of Julius Caesar (48\u201344 BC). The chronology of Geoffrey Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 94\u201382 BC,Geoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.31 that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 143\u2013131 BC.Annals of the Four Masters M5057-5069 ==References== Category:Ulster Cycle Category:Cycles of the Kings Category:People from County Meath Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland Category:1st-century BC legendary rulers ",
