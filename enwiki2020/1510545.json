    "text": "Whitfell (or sometimes Whit Fell) is a hill in the southwestern part of the Lake District. It is the highest point between Black Combe and Harter Fell on the broad ridge to the west of the Duddon Valley. Views from the summit include the full length of the Duddon Valley including its estuary; the western side of the Coniston fells; the Eskdale fells including Scafell and Bowfell; much of western Cumbria including the estuary of the Rivers Esk, Mite and Irt; the Isle of Man; as well as the hills to the south culminating in Black Combe. The hill is relatively infrequently visited, and is a fairly characterless grassy mound, extensively grazed by sheep, though with a very large cairn, whose stones may be from a tumulus. A bridleway crosses the fell to the north of the summit, but it is probably more frequently visited on a round including Burn Moor at , Kinmont Buck Barrow at , and Buck Barrow at from the summit of the Corney Fell road, a route described by Alfred Wainwright in the \"Whit Fell\" chapter of his book The Outlying Fells of Lakeland. ==References== Category:Marilyns of England Category:Fells of the Lake District ",
