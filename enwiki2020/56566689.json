Pre-registered voters cast their vote during the live show for their favorite couple (a maximum of 100 votes on the website platform and 100 votes on the mobile platform; a total of 200 votes per registered voter). The ranking determined by the judges gives each position on the leaderboard assigned points. With 11 contestants the system works as follows; first place is awarded 11 points, second place is awarded 10 points, third place is awarded 9 points and so on until eleventh place which is awarded 1 point. The public vote is tallied at the end of the Live Show and a ranking is determined based on those votes. Once again, this ranking assigns points based on position. With 11 contestants the system works as follows; first position is awarded 11 points, second position is awarded 10 points, third position is awarded 9 points and so on until eleventh position which is awarded 1 point. For each contestant the points earned by the Judge's ranking and points earned by the public votes are added to create a final score and the couple with the lowest combined score is eliminated. === Scoring charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ ! rowspan=\"2\" |Couple ! rowspan=\"2\" |Place ! rowspan=\"2Zola \" |1+2 ! rowspan=\"2\" |3 ! rowspan=\"2\" |4 ! rowspan=\"2\" |5 ! rowspan=\"2\" |6 ! rowspan=\"2\" |7 !8 ! colspan=\"2\" |9 ! colspan=\"2\" |10 - Quarter-Finals ! colspan=\"2\" |11 - Semi-Finals ! colspan=\"2\" |12 - Final |- !(30) !1 !240 !1 !2 !1 !2 !1 !2 |- |Connell & Marcella |1 |25 |29 |25 |32 |33 |39 |28 |33 |6 |36 |34 |34 |37 |style=\"background:gold;\"|40 |style=\"background:gold;\"|39 |- |Eden & Ash-Leigh |2 |24 |15 |26 |30 |28 |28 |25 |38 |5 |27 |30 |33 |38 |style=\"background:silver;\"|39 |style=\"background:silver;\"|40 |- |Zola & Tebogo |2 |27 |20 |28 |28 |25 |34 |N/A |32 |4 |29 |28 |40 |34 |style=\"background:silver;\"|40 |style=\"background:silver;\"|39 |- |Vanes-Mari & Johannes |4 |26 |18 |25 |22 |31 |25 |23 |30 |2 |38 |30 |style=\"background:orange;\"|29 |style=\"background:orange;\"|32 | colspan=\"2\" | |- |Frank & Jeann\u00e9 |5 |20 |21 |18 |18 |24 |23 |16 |28 |1 |style=\"background:orange;\"|23 |style=\"background:orange;\"|26 | colspan=\"4\" | |- |Liesl & Ryan |6 |20 |18 |24 |22 |28 |28 |18 |style=\"background:orange;\"|27 |style=\"background:orange;\"|3 | colspan=\"6\" | |- |Juanita & Johan |7 |21 |21 |24 |31 |35 |29 |style=\"background:orange;\"|22 | colspan=\"8\" | |- |Delron & Angelique |8 |18 |17 |19 |26 |27 |style=\"background:orange;\"|21 | colspan=\"9\" | |- |Tando & Michelle |9 |17 |20 |23 |20 |style=\"background:orange;\"|21 | colspan=\"10\" | |- |Odessa & Dylon |10 |20 |21 |19 |style=\"background:orange;\"|19 | colspan=\"11\" | |- |Thembisa & Devomn |11 |21 |21 |style=\"background:orange;\"|23 | colspan=\"12\" | |- |Ebenhaezer & Nombulelo |12 |23 |style=\"background:orange;\"|15 | colspan=\"13\" | |} :Red numbers indicate the lowest score for each week :Green numbers indicate the highest score for each week : the couple eliminated that week : the winning couple : the runner-up couple === Average Score Chart === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ !Rank by average !Place !Couple !Total Points !Number of Dances !Average |- |1 |1 |Connell & Marcella |470 |15 |82.8 |- |2 |2 |Zola & Tobogo |408 |14 |74.6 |- |3 |2 |Eden & Ash-Leigh |426 |15 |73.9 |- |4 |7 |Juanita & Johan |183 |7 |68 |- |5 |4 |Vanes-Mari & Johannes |331 |13 |67.5 |- |6 |6 |Liesl & Ryan |188 |9 |59.4 |- |7 |5 |Frank & Jeann\u00e9 |218 |11 |54.2 |- |8 |11 |Thembisa & Devomn |65 |3 |54.2 |- |9 |8 |Delron & Angelique |128 |6 |53.3 |- |10 |9 |Tando & Michelle |101 |5 |50.5 |- |11 |10 |Odessa & Dylon |79 |4 |49.4 |- |12 |12 |Ebenhaezer & Nombulelo |38 |2 |47.5 |} == Times and reception == The show airs on M-Net on a Sunday at 17:00 to 19:00 and the Live Results Show takes place after M-Net's flagship Investigative show Carte Blanche from 20:00 to 20:30. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Dancing with the Stars Category:South African reality television series Category:South African music television series Category:2018 South African television series debuts Category:South African television series based on British television series ",
