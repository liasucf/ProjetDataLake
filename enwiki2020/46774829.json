    "text": "The 2016 Philippine Gubernatorial elections were held in the Philippines on May 9, 2016. All provinces elected their provincial governors for three-year terms, who will be inaugurated on June 30, 2016 after their proclamation. Governors that are currently serving their third consecutive terms are prohibited from running as governors (they may run for any other posts however). Highly urbanized cities and independent component cities such as Angeles, Bacolod, Baguio, Cagayan de Oro City, Cebu City, Davao City, Iloilo City and Metro Manila with the municipality of Pateros are outside the jurisdiction of any province and thus won't run elections for governors of their mother provinces (Pampanga, Negros Occidental, Benguet, Misamis Oriental, Cebu, Davao del Sur and Iloilo for Angeles, Bacolod City, Baguio City, Cagayan de Oro City, Cebu City, Davao City and Iloilo City respectively). These cities and Pateros would elect mayors instead. Davao Occidental held its first gubernatorial election on this day. ==Summary== {|class=wikitable style=\"text-align:right\" |- !colspan=2|Party !!width=40px|2013 elections !!width=40px| Before elections !!width=40px| Gains !!width=40px| Holds !!width=40px| Losses !!width=40px| Total !!width=40px| % !!width=40px| Change (vs. before) |- || 38 || 40 || 4 || 35 || 5 || 39 || 48.1% || 1 |- || 13 || 8 || 1 || 8 || 0 || 9 || 11.1% || 1 |- || 8 || 9 || 2 || 7 || 2 || 9 || 11.1% || |- || 6 || 8 || 2 || 7 || 1 || 9 || 11.1% || 1 |- || 3 || 4 || 2 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 3.7% || 1 |- || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1.2% || |- || 1 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0.0% || 1 |- | ||align=left|Local parties || 4 || 7 || 0 || 6 || 1 || 6 || 7.4% || 1 |- || 6 || 2 || 3 || 2 || 0 || 5 || 6.2% || 3 |- !colspan=2|Totals !! 80 !! 80 !! 14 !! 67 !! 13 !! 81 !! 100% !! 1 |} ==Luzon== ===Ilocos Region=== ====Ilocos Norte==== Incumbent governor Imee Marcos is running for reelection unopposed. ====Ilocos Sur==== Incumbent governor Ryan Singson is running for reelection unopposed. ====La Union==== Incumbent Governor Manuel Ortega is term limited ====Pangasinan==== Incumbent Governor Amado Espino, Jr. is term limited ===Cagayan Valley=== ====Batanes==== Incumbent Vicente Gato is running for reelection ====Cagayan==== Incumbent Governor Alvaro Antonio is term limited ====Isabela==== Incumbent Governor Faustino Dy III is running for reelection. ====Nueva Vizcaya==== Incumbent Governor Ruth Padilla is running for Congresswoman ====Quirino==== Incumbent governor Junie Cua is running for reelection unopposed. ===Cordillera Administrative Region=== ====Abra==== Incumbent Governor Eustaquio Bersamin is term limited ====Apayao==== Incumbent governor Elias Bulut, Jr. is running for reelection unopposed. ====Benguet==== Incumbent Governor Nestor Fongwan is term limited ====Ifugao==== Incumbent Denis Habawel is running for reelection ====Kalinga==== Incumbent Jocel Baac is running for reelection ====Mountain Province==== Incumbent Governor Leonard Mayaen was running unopposed for reelection to a third term, but died in office from a heart attack on March 31, 2016.
