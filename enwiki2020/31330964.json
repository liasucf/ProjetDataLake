At the age of 4, she moved with her family (father Carlo Esposito, mother Iris Barzaghi, and sister Adriana Esposito) to Padova. After graduating from High School (classics, with Greek and Latin) she studied Chinese language and philosophy at the University of Venice (Ca'Foscari), Fudan University in Shanghai, and the University of Gent in Belgium. After graduation with a thesis on Qigong in 1987, she continued her studies under the direction of Prof. Isabelle Robinet at the Department of Far Eastern Studies of the University of Paris. After obtaining the Diploma of Advanced Studies (D.E.A.) on texts of the Daoist canon in 1988, she returned to Shanghai and studied at the Academy of Social Science of Shanghai under the direction of Prof. Chen Yaoting. Her graduate studies ended in 1993 with a summa cum laude Ph.D. in Far Eastern Studies; thesis The Dragon Gate - The Longmen school of Mount Jin'gai and its alchemical practices according to the Daozang xubian (complement to the Daoist canon). During several stays in China and Tibet, Dr. Esposito conducted extensive field work on Qigong, Taiji, Daoist and Buddhist (particularly Dzogchen) practices in China. After post- doctoral studies at the Department of Indological and Far-Eastern Studies of the University of Venice (1994\u20131995), at the Sorbonne in Paris (1995\u20131997), and at Kansai University in Osaka, she established permanent residence in Kyoto in 1998 and married Urs App. Between 1998 and 2003 she concentrated on field studies in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and continental China leading to the production, together with her husband, of several highly acclaimed video productions about Far Eastern religions. After being elected Associate Professor at Kyoto University's Institute for Research in Humanistic Studies (Jinbun Kagaku kenky\u016bsho) in 2003, Dr. Esposito continued her research on Daoist texts of the Ming and Qing periods. She conceived and directed the Daozang Jiyao research project, an international research project with over sixty scientific collaborators on the most important Daoist text collection of the Qing period. For portions of this large project, which began in 2006, Dr. Esposito obtained important grants from the Chiang Ching-kuo foundation (2006\u20132009 and 2010-2013Project number CCKF RG006-P-09; director Monica Esposito, vice-director Christian Wittern) and from the Japanese Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS; 2008-2011Director: Monica Esposito; Project supervision: Prof. Kunio Mugitani, Institute for Research in Humanistic Studies (Jinbun Kagaku kenky\u016bsho) at Kyoto University; vice-director Prof. Christian Wittern, Institute for Research in Humanistic Studies (Jinbun Kagaku kenky\u016bsho) at Kyoto University.).
