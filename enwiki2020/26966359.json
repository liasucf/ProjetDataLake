The complex includes three buildings, two of which are wood frame and one which is brick. The two wood frame buildings include the Queen Anne-style former home of Joseph Nutt, who established a machine shop providing services to Danbury's hat making industry in 1886. Nutt's home also served as his company's office, and is attached to a single-story monitor-roofed brick structure. The factory is most notable as the location where Lewis Heim, owner of the Ball and Roller Bearing Company, invented the modern centerless grinding machine in 1917. and The complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 25, 1989. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Fairfield County, Connecticut ==References== Category:Industrial buildings completed in 1917 Category:Industrial buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Connecticut Category:Buildings and structures in Danbury, Connecticut Category:Rolling-element bearings Category:Companies based in Fairfield County, Connecticut Category:National Register of Historic Places in Fairfield County, Connecticut ",
