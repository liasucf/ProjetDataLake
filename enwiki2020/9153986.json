    "text": "Madame Figaro is a French magazine supplement to the Saturday edition of the daily newspaper Le Figaro, focusing on and catering to women. ==History and profile== The first edition was published in 1980. Madame Figaro was spearheaded by Robert Hersant, who succeeded Jean Prouvost (creator of the French women's fashion magazine Marie Claire). The magazine experienced immediate success, owing to its diverse contents, and the quality of the writing, targeting affluent readers. The first female Editor-in-Chief of the magazine was Marie-Claire Pauwels, daughter of Louis Pauwels. The launch of Madame Figaro in 1980 marked a distinct distancing from the feminist movement of the preceding decade (notably from the movement to \"liberate pornography\" that had a goal of seizing power from the dominant moral and religious institutions). Madame Figaro had its origins as a single page feature appearing in Figaro Magazine, because that magazine's majority of readers were female, drawn to its orientation towards topics on culture and the art of living (l\u2019art de vivre).Claire Blandin, Le Figaro: Deux si\u00e8cles d\u2019histoire, Armand Colin, 2007, p.264 Le Figaro publishes a number of other supplements, each on a particular day of the week, for example, an economic news supplement, a supplement for its Paris-region readers, and so on. Madame Figaro is devoted solely to topics interesting to female readers. This has included such highly debated topics of the 1980s as: sexual relationships between men and women; aspirations towards equality between the sexes and to further women's emancipation; how to make families succeed during marriage; children and strong families. Madame Figaro is a mainstream women's magazine, feminine and a vehicle for ideas that are both liberal and conservative, since the beginning of the 1980s. A vital part of \"Madame Figaro's\" content is its focus on enhancing women's careers, and challenging conventional views of women's roles in society.Marianne Lohse, \u00ab 40 femmes qui font la France \u00bb, Madame Figaro, n\u00b0 11420, May 1981, p.18 Madame Figaro was among the first news publications in France to publish feature-length articles on the condition of women in foreign countries, using its own journalists. The worlds of fashion, beauty and interior design are the fundamental content of the magazine. Articles discussing elegance and distinction, all while taking a critical view of fashion's social conformity, have been hallmarks of the presentation of fashion in Madame Figaro.Marie-Claire Pauwels, \u00ab Madame Figaro ou le snobisme de masse \u00bb, Les \u00c9chos de la Presse et de la Publicit\u00e9, n\u00b0 1476, 15 December 1986, p. 44 Culture in its broad sense occupies a place of importance in Madame Figaro, from literature, to history, as well as music. The magazine has had many articles on French celebrities such as Jean Giono,Catherine Caubere, \u00ab D\u00e9couvrez la Provence de Giono \u00bb, Madame Figaro, n\u00b011242, October 1980, p.20 Jean Anouilh,Constance Pontiatowski et Marion Thebaud, \u00ab Les spectacles du mois \u00bb, Madame Figaro, n\u00b011528, September 1981, p.10 as well as the Rolling Stones, and Bob Dylan.Jacques Doucelin et Jean-Luc Wachthausen, \u00ab Les disques du mois \u00bb, Madame Figaro, n\u00b011528, September 1981, p.22 The magazine had been published by Hachette Filipacchi until 2001 when it began to be published Quebecor World Inc. The first international edition was published in Portugal under the name M\u00e1xima. During the 1980s, Madame Figaro expanded into several countries, such as Japan and Turkey, following the trend of globalization in women's magazines. In the 1990s, the Chinese version began to be published. In 2019, Madame Figaro further developed to a total of ten editions, latest of which started in Hong Kong in fall 2019.
