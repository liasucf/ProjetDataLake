    "text": "Glycitin (glycitein 7-O-glucoside) is an isoflavone found in soy, and remain to various degrees in soy products like tofu and soymilk. as well as fermented soy sauce. Although glycitin has its own health associated properties (below), it can be transformed to glycitein by human intestinal flora by the action of beta-glucosidases. ==Properties== Some interesting effects of glycitin include human dermal fibroblast cell proliferation and migration via TGF\u2010\u03b2 signaling, glycitin treatment produces anti-photoaging effects such as collagen type I and collagen type III increase at both the mRNA and protein levels. Other noted effects decreased elastase, and decreased \u03b2\u2010galactosidase activation. In conjunction with 4\u2032,6,7-trimethoxyisoflavone (TMF), an isoflavone that promotes fibroblast migration but not proliferation, wound healing and anti- scarring activity (reorganization and wound fibrosis inhibition) were significantly and synergistically boosted in both in vivo mice and in vitro. == References == Category:Glucosides Category:Isoflavones ",
