    "text": "Kappa Theta Epsilon Sorority (\u039a\u0398\u0395) is the first Greek-lettered sorority established and incorporated for LGBT professional and entrepreneurial women. Membership is exclusive to lesbian women, and primarily college-educated. The sorority was founded February 24, 2009, in Houston, Texas. The organization's founding tenets are sisterhood, fidelity, accomplishment and service. ==History== ===Cultural context=== The political climate of the early 21st century played a large role in the founding of Kappa Theta Epsilon Sorority, Incorporated. Negative media portrayal of lesbians and gays, and the emergence of same-sex marriage as a recurring political issue, inspired the Sorority's Founder to consider a Sorority as a medium for creating change. From the year 2000 to 2009, LGBT rights took a leading role in both politics and the justice system. Legally, the issue of marriage equality began to gain momentum, and laws criminalizing homosexuality were being overturned. Kappa Theta Epsilon's founder believed that a group of young leaders could advocate for more equitable policies in both the legislative and judicial arenas. ===Sorority establishment=== The sorority was founded on the morning of February 24, 2009 in Houston, Texas. After researching existing organizations, it was decided that the group would adopt the letters Kappa Theta Epsilon (\u039a\u0398\u0395) to reflect its fundamental ideals. On February 25, the sorority's official colors and mascot were finalized. Other symbols adopted in the early stages of the sorority were the founding tenets, flower and jewel. It was agreed in September 2009 that, for the first two years, development of infrastructure would take precedence over the initiation of new members. ==Philanthropy and programming== {| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin:0 0 0.5em 0.5em; font-size:88%;\" |+ \u039a\u0398\u0395 National Signature Programs |- | | Leadership Development | | The Academy |- | | Educational Advancement | | Plum Goes Green Campaign |- | | Holistic Health and Wellness | | Life 360 Wellness Symposium |- | | Economic Empowerment | | Lesbians in Business Incubator |- | | Social Impact and Policy Awareness | | The For Eudy Project |} ===Service philosophy=== Kappa Theta Epsilon states that through its philosophy of \"servant leadership,\" members have a direct impact on the conditions of their community and world.
