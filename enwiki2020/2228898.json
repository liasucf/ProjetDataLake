    "text": "Ameriflight LLC is an American cargo airline with headquarters at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. It is the largest United States FAA Part 135 cargo carrier, operating scheduled and contract cargo services from 19 bases to destinations in 250 cities across 43 US states, as well as Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and South America. Ameriflight serves major financial institutions, freight forwarders, laboratories and overnight couriers in the US and provides feeder services for overnight express carriers nationwide and internationally. Ameriflight averages 525 daily departures with over 100,000 combined flight hours annually and a 99.5% on-time performance. Ameriflight employs over 700 people (225 pilots, 140 mechanics). ==History== Ameriflight was established in 1968 as California Air Charter. The company's first route, CalAir 103, was bank mail and cancelled checks flown in a Piper Cherokee Six (PA-32) from Hollywood-Burbank Airport to Riverside Municipal Airport, and then on to Blythe Airport near the Colorado River. The company merged in 1971 with United Couriers (UCI), a wholly owned subsidiary of ATI Systems International (ATIS). In April 1993 the fixed-wing division of Wings Express (which was based at Van Nuys Airport) was purchased, and the outstanding shares of Sports Air Travel were acquired in mid-1997. In March 2007, when Canadian company Garda Security bought ATIS, Ameriflight was sold to a group of investors including the company's president, Gary Richards. In May 2014 the airline announced it was moving its headquarters to Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. Maintenance operations and flight operations are scheduled to move to DFW.Murray, Lance and Nicholas Sakelaris. \"Cargo carrier Ameriflight to relocate HQ, operations to D/FW Airport.\" Dallas Business Journal. May 15, 2014. Retrieved on May 16, 2014. In late 2014 Ameriflight reached agreement to acquire Wiggins Airways (48 aircraft and 100 employees), which would result in Ameriflight becoming the largest regional air cargo carrier in the world with 163 aircraft in its fleet. ==Flight services== An Ameriflight Beechcraft Model 99 upon take-off from Mojave Air and Space Port (2009). The majority of Ameriflight's operations consists of air feeder service for major package express integrators such as UPS, FedEx, and DHL. Other significant customers include Lantheus Medical Imaging, ACS Products, and Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals. On schedules set by the customers, cargo is received in the early morning from large jet freighters at hub airports and distributed by Ameriflight airplanes to smaller communities whose traffic (or airports) would not support the big airplanes. In the evening, the Ameriflight aircraft fly back to the hubs, in order to feed them with cargo from the smaller communities, which is carried onwards to the integrators' distribution centers for sorting and redistribution to the ultimate destinations. Although demand is decreasing as use of digital imaging and electronic data transfer increases, Ameriflight also transports high priority intercity financial documents. Pharmaceuticals, film for development, medical laboratory samples, and other miscellaneous cargo are also carried. Ameriflight is one of the few Part 135 cargo carriers in the U.S. with a special Department of Transportation permit to carry high Transport Index radioactive cargo, an important element in the company's time-critical radioactive medical raw materials business, which transports radioactive \"generator\" materials between points of manufacture and cities where it is used to produce materials used in diagnostics and cancer therapy. In addition to scheduled flying (with contract schedules set by customers), all Ameriflight bases can respond to unscheduled on-demand cargo flights to destinations in Alaska, Canada, throughout the contiguous U.S., Mexico, the Caribbean, and into South America. A single King Air 200 was used for on-demand passenger charter flights but has since been retired. ==Fleet== ===Current=== EMB-120ER Brasilia rests on the ramp at the company's new DFW Airport headquarters.

The pilot was killed in the crash. The NTSB determined that a propeller blade separated from the right propeller hub. The rest of the propeller hub then separated striking the right front of the fuselage and the damage done made the aircraft uncontrollable.NTSB Report LAX89FA314 - 09/09/1992 |- | |AMF107 |An Ameriflight Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (registered N78DE) on a cargo flight, departed from Hollywood-Burbank Airport flying non-stop to Oakland International Airport. At approximately 23:46 local time the aircraft collided with terrain near the summit of Mount Pinos approximately 9 miles west of Frazier Park. The airplane was destroyed, and the ATP rated pilot was killed in the crash. The NTSB determined the probable cause was the pilot's failure to select a cruise altitude which would ensure adequate terrain clearance. Contributing factors related to the dark, nighttime condition and to the pilot's lack of attentiveness.NTSB Report LAX94FA149, adopted - 02/24/1995 |- |16 November 1994 | - |An Ameriflight Beechcraft Model 99 (registered N63995) on a cargo flight from Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport to Oakland International Airport descended steeply into the ground from cruise altitude near Avenal and the pilot was killed in the crash. The probable cause could not be determined, although pilot incapacitation was suspected.Ameriflight 1994 crash at the Aviation Safety Network |- |23 December 1995 | - |While performing a 135.297 instrument competency check, an Ameriflight Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (registered N27954) impacted terrain in the hills southeast of Oakland International Airport (KOAK) at approximately 00:19 local time. The airplane was destroyed, and the two pilots were killed in the crash. In the National Transportation Safety Board's narrative, they determined the probable cause as the failure of the air traffic controller to comply with instructions contained in the Air Traffic Control Handbook and vectoring an aircraft at below the minimum vectoring altitude (MVA). In addition, the ATC supervisor\u2019s failure to detect and correct the situation. Lower situational awareness by the flightcrew was also considered a contributing factor.NTSB Report LAX96FA078, adopted - 03/31/1997 |- |13 August 1997 |AMF262 |A Beechcraft 1900 (registered N3172A) was damaged in a crash, landing at Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport and destroyed in a fire that had erupted from spilled fuel. Investigation into the accident determined that the airplane had been overloaded and that the pilot had been misinformed by staff members of the company that contracted for the flight about the cargo weight and center of gravity, which led to a stall1997 accident at the Aviation Safety Network during the landing flare. |- |12 February 1999 | - |A Beechcraft C99 (registered N205RA) crashed into a canyon of the White Mountains, while en route a positioning flight from Tonopah Airport to Bishop Airport. The wreckage was finally discovered two days later. According to relatives and witnesses, the pilot (who was killed in the crash) had stated his intent to take aerial pictures of the local scenery and likely lost control of the aircraft while doing so.1999 crash at the Aviation Safety Network |- |14 October 1999 |AMF121 |An Ameriflight Piper PA-31-350 Navajo Chieftain (registered N1024B) on a cargo flight from North Las Vegas Airport (KVGT) to Sacramento Executive Airport (KSAC) impacted terrain 11 miles north of KVGT airport. The pilot was fatally injured. In the National Transportation Safety Board's narrative, they determined that the probable cause was the failure of the pilot-in-command to maintain separation from terrain while operating under visual flight rules. Contributing factors were the improper issuance of a suggested heading by air traffic control personnel, inadequate flight progress monitoring by radar departure control personnel, and failure of the radar controller to identify a hazardous condition and issue a safety alert.NTSB Report: LAX00FA014, adopted 04/06/2001 |- |29 November 2003 |AMF1966 |Flight 1966 from Boeing Field crashed into trees in bad visibility conditions while approaching its destination Felts Field, by which the pilot was killed. The aircraft involved, a Fairchild Metro III registered N439AF, had one of its two ILS receivers deferred due to intermittent flag activity at the time of the accident. The pilot had initiated his final descent late and then descended through the glide slope.2003 accident at the Aviation Safety Network |- |18 March 2006 |AMF2591 |A Beechcraft Model C99 (registered N54RP) crashed during a flight from Helena to Butte in Montana about 8.1 miles South West of its destination, killing the two pilots on board.
