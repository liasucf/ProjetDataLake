He is generally recognized (together with Martin Benka and \u013dudov\u00edt Fulla) as one of key personalities in the beginning of Modern Slovak Art. ==Life== He studied at the Akademie V\u00fdtvarn\u00fdch Um\u011bn\u00ed (Academy of Visual Arts) in Prague by Vlaho Bukovac, Maximilian Pirner and Max \u0160vabinsk\u00fd. He lived in Liptovsk\u00fd Mikul\u00e1\u0161, Martin and from 1937 in Bratislava. He began his creative artistic career with socially motivated expressive works from the environment of the urban periphery, as he called it. He developed genre painting in an original way, inspired by ballads, folk songs and legends (H\u00f4rni chlapci \u2013 Mountain Robbers). He also devoted attention to stained glass and tapestries. Pastel was his most characteristic artistic technique. Alexy's decorative genre of pastels is prevalent throughout his rural pieces (K\u00faria Baanovcov v Trstenom \u2013 Curia of the Baans in Trsten\u00e9). Alexy was especially adept at painting cityscapes, though peculiarly, for usually an air of abstract expressionism resided in the works. He also created several models for architectural projects, e.g. the window- pane at the P. O. Hviezdoslav Theatre in Bratislava. In his literary works J. Alexy preferred themes from the life of Slovak bohemia and autobiographical topics: \u017divot nie je maj\u00e1les (1956, Life is Not a May Festival), Osudy slovensk\u00fdch v\u00fdtvarn\u00edkov (1948, Destinies of Slovak Graphic and Plastic Artists).
