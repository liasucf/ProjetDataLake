    "text": "Ga\u00facho (, alternatively [ga\u02c8u\u0283u]), more rarely called Sulriograndense, is the Brazilian Portuguese term for the characteristic accent spoken in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil's southernmost state, including its capital, Porto Alegre. It is heavily influenced by Spanish and somewhat influenced by Guarani, Hunsr\u00fcckisch, Venetian and other native languages. ==Phonology== Its phonology is heavily similar to Rioplatense Spanish, including its characteristics of the speaking syllabic rhythm, use of L-vocalization in the syllable coda, and little use nasal vowels, basically restricted to the monophthong and the diphthongs . In the western and some central variations there is the absence of vowel reduction with word-final and (for example, is instead of and is instead of ). In some other cities of the region, the nasal monophthong is heightened to . ==Grammar== Grammatically, one of its most notable features is the use of , instead of , with the verb conjugating differently: e.g. and instead of and . However, use of the standard voc\u00ea is also not rare. The same feature also occurs in other dialects of Brazilian Portuguese. ==Vocabulary== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Ga\u00facho !
