    "text": "The Nur movement (, also known as Nurcu) is an Islamist movement in Turkey based on the writings of Said Nursi (d. 1960), which promoted the concept of the Quran as a \"living document\" which needed to be continually re- interpreted. The group was opposed by the government during the 1960s and 1970s due to its Islamism. The group fragmented substantially in the 1970s and 1980s, resulting in offshoots such as the G\u00fclen movement. ==References== Category:Islamism in Turkey Category:Sunni Islamic branches Category:Quranic exegesis Category:Kurdish Islamism ",
