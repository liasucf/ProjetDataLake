    "text": "Driven is a film directed by Nick Hamm and written by Colin Bateman. The film stars Lee Pace, Jason Sudeikis, Corey Stoll, Judy Greer, Isabel Arraiza, Michael Cudlitz, and Erin Moriarty. The film premiered at the 75th Venice International Film Festival on September 8, 2018 and subsequently screened at the 2018 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released on August 16, 2019. == Plot == John DeLorean's quest to design the ultimate car of the future leads to his downfall thanks to his friendship with an FBI informant. == Cast == * Jason Sudeikis as Jim Hoffman * Lee Pace as John DeLorean * Judy Greer as Ellen Hoffman * Corey Stoll as Special Agent Benedict Tisa * Isabel Arraiza as Cristina Ferrare * Michael Cudlitz as Morgan Hetrick * Erin Moriarty as Katy Connors * Justin Bartha as Howard Weitzman * Iddo Goldberg as Roy * Tara Summers as Molly Gibson * Jamey Sheridan as Bill ==Production== The film is set in San Diego but was filmed in Puerto Rico. It was five days into production when Hurricane Maria hit. Rather than abandon production entirely and film elsewhere they decided it was important to return and continue the production, as a business bringing money to the local economy. Sets needed to be rebuilt and repaired, and film locations changed. Resources were scarce, many families had no running water or power, so the few hotel rooms available were shared out. Electricity was scarce and the filmmakers had to lobby the Puerto Rican government for access to limited quantities of fuel for generators. The film employed more than 200 locals, and raised $330,000 towards relief efforts. ==Reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 63% based on 51 reviews, with an average rating of 5.79/10. The website's critics consensus reads: \"Compelling performances from an outstanding cast help Driven take audiences on an enjoyably stranger-than- fiction joyride.\" On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 55 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Boyd van Hoeij of The Hollywood Reporter wrote: \"If the pic is ultimately an entertaining ride, it is because Sudeikis takes the audience by the hand through this very unlikely story that was inspired by true events.\" Guy Lodge of Variety magazine gave the film a mixed review put praised Pace for his performance: \"Against the film's own boisterous inclinations, Pace gives it something like a heart, albeit a closed, melancholic one: that\u2019s some acting, and it\u2019s maybe more than these agreeably derivative proceedings deserve.\" DeLorean historians and the family of John DeLorean have criticized the film and portrayal of John DeLorean for being wildly inaccurate. The film depicts a close friendship between DeLorean and FBI informant James Hoffman, which was never the case. The character of Katy Connors portrayed by Erin Moriarty is also a fictional character created for the film. The DeLorean automobile used in the film was provided by the Puerto Rico DeLorean club, who has since expressed regret having loaned the car for the production after seeing the completed film. Had they been made aware of the negative storyline of both John DeLorean and the car, they have stated they would have not loaned the car out. == See also == * Framing John DeLorean, a 2019 documentary film about the life of John DeLorean == References == == External links == * Category:English-language films Category:2018 films ",
