    "text": "The Great Crown of Victory (; ) is one of the regalia of Thailand. Made of gold and enamelled in red and green during the reign of King Rama I in 1782, the crown is 66 centimeters (26 inches) high and weighs 7.3 kg (16 pounds). In the reign of King Rama IV, a set of diamonds was added to the crown. Also added was a large cut diamond from India to decorate the top of the crown, called the Great Diamond (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35 Phra Maha Wichian Mani). The crown is of a distinctive Thai design, being a multi-tiered conical diadem, terminating in a tapering spire. The crown is worn only when a king is crowned. He places the crown on his own head. The shape of the crown represents the concept of divine monarchy. The tall spire signifies divine authority and the right to rule over his subjects. The Great Crown of Victory is the most important of the five regalia of Thailand, yet at one time the crown was accorded the same importance as the other regalia. == Gallery == File:Great Crown of Victory (heraldry).svg|The Great Crown of Victory (heraldic version) File:Str\u00f6hl-Regentenkronen-Fig. 43.png|The Great Crown of Victory (heraldic version), drawn by Hugo Gerard Str\u00f6hl File:Privy Seal of King Rama IV (Mongkut).svg|The privy seal of King Mongkut (Rama IV), depicting the Great Crown of Victory.
