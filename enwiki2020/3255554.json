    "text": "\"Gossip Folks\" is a song by American hip-hop artist Missy Elliott, featuring Ludacris. The song appears on her 2002 album Under Construction and was chosen as second single release. It peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number nine in the United Kingdom. \"Gossip Folks\" also went to number one on the dance charts. ==Background== The song is Missy's response to different rumors about her (e.g., her sexual orientation, her weight), and essentially tells those who spread these rumors to mind their own business. The refrain of \"Gossip Folks\" samples the 1981 song \"Double Dutch Bus\" by Frankie Smith. ==Music video== The music video for \"Gossip Folks\" was directed by Dave Meyers. In the beginning Elliott is walking through the hallway when students start announcing her entrance and begin to start rumors about her. As Missy's verse starts, Missy and the students begin dancing through the chorus. The second verse starts in the cafeteria where Missy has her group of students have a food fight with another group. Also in the cafeteria are Tweet, Eve, and Trina impressing while sitting on a cafeteria table. In the middle of the video a clip of \"Funky Fresh Dressed\" featuring Ms. Jade was played. The \"Funky Fresh Dressed\" segment of the video features Elliott and Ms. Jade with their green shades in a classroom. Missy begins to aggravate the teacher Faizon Love while Ms. Jade takes over the class with a yardstick as a symbol of power. Ludacris's verse begins directly after the \"Funky Fresh Dressed\" segment. He appears to be the principal. The Bus Driver, that appears in the last ten seconds, is Darryl McDaniels (DMC of Run-DMC). Toward the end of the video a mural dedicated to the late R&B;/hip hop stars Aaliyah (1979\u20132001), Lisa Lopes (1971\u20132002), and Jam Master Jay (1965\u20132002) is shown. The video features several young dancers. Including Monica Parales of former girl group School Gyrls and Alyson Stoner of The JammX Kids. Monica Parales auditioned for the role of Lead Kid Dancer in Work It (Missy Elliott song), but lost the role to Alyson Stoner. Monica eventually co-starred with Alyson in \"Gossip Folks\" and I'm Really Hot. The music video also stars dancer and actress Jenna Dewan from Step Up.Whatever Happened to the Little Girls From Missy Elliott's Music Videos? ===Tributes in the end of the video=== * Aaliyah Dana Haughton (born January 16, 1979 - died August 25, 2001) \u2013 plane accident * Lisa Nicole Lopes (born May 27, 1971 - died April 25, 2002) \u2013 car accident * Jason William Mizell (born January 21, 1965 - died October 30, 2002) \u2013 murdered ==Remixes== * Fatboy Slim Remix (6:42) * Fatboy Slim Radio Remix (3:31) * Fatboy Slim Dub (7:04) * Mousse T.'s Original Alternative (3:46) * Mousse T.'s Pogo Remix Extended (5:05) * Mousse T.'s Pogo Remix Instrumental (5:04) * Mousse T. & Royal Garden Remix Extended (5:15) * Mousse T. & Royal Garden Remix Instrumental (5:15) * Mousse T. & Royal Garden Remix Radio (3:37) * Mousse T.'s So Phat Remix Extended (4:35) * Mousse T.'s So Phat Remix Instrumental (4:35) * Mousse T.'s Afropean Ride Remix Extended (7:27) * Mousse T.'s Afropean Ride Remix Video Version (3:47) * Mousse T.'s Afropean Ride Remix Instrumental (7:27) * Mousse T.'s Original Alternative Acapella (3:45) ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Chart (2003) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |20 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 singles Category:2002 songs Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number-one singles Category:Ludacris songs Category:Missy Elliott songs Category:Music videos directed by Dave Meyers (director) Category:Song recordings produced by Timbaland Category:Songs written by Ludacris Category:Songs written by Missy Elliott Category:Songs written by Timbaland ",
