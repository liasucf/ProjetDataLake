Some of the main themes in his works are the relations between individuality and authority, life and death, and other existential problems. ==Biography== Selimovi\u0107 was born to a prominent Muslim family of Serbian origin on 26 April 1910 in Tuzla, Bosnia and Herzegovina, where he graduated from elementary school and high school. In 1930, he enrolled to study the Serbo-Croatian language and literature at the University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology and graduated in 1934. His lecturers included Bogdan Popovi\u0107, Pavle Popovi\u0107, Vladimir \u0106orovi\u0107, Veselin \u010cajkanovi\u0107, Aleksandar Beli\u0107 and Stjepan Kuljbakin. In 1936, he returned to Tuzla to teach in the gymnasium that today bears his name. At that time he participated in the Soko athletic organisation. He spent the first two years of the Second World War in Tuzla, until he was arrested for participation in the Partisan anti-fascist resistance movement in 1943. After his release, he moved to liberated territory, became a member of Communist Party of Yugoslavia and the political commissar of the Tuzla Detachment of the Partisans. During the war, Selimovi\u0107's brother, also a communist, was executed by partisans' firing squad for alleged theft, without trial; Selimovi\u0107's letter in defense of the brother was to no avail. That episode apparently affected Me\u0161a's later contemplative introduction to Death and the Dervish, where the main protagonist Ahmed Nurudin fails to rescue his imprisoned brother. After the war, he briefly resided in Belgrade, and in 1947 he moved to Sarajevo, where he was the professor of High School of Pedagogy and Faculty of Philology, art director of Bosna Film, chief of the drama section of the National Theater, and chief editor of the publishing house Svjetlost. Exasperated by a latent conflict with several local politicians and intellectuals, in 1971 he moved to Belgrade, where he lived until his death in 1982. In his 1976 letter to the Serbian Academy of Science and Arts, Selimovi\u0107 stated for the historical record that he regarded himself as a Serb and belonging to the corpus of Serbian literature.Ve\u010dernje Novosti: Prona\u0161ao mir u Beogradu, Dragan BOGUTOVI\u0106, 9 July 2010 In his autobiography, Sje\u0107anja, Selimovi\u0107 states that his paternal ancestry is from the Orthodox Christian Vujovi\u0107 brotherhood of the Drobnjak clan, his ancestor having converted to Islam in the 17th century for pragmatic reasons, given the presence of the Muslim Ottoman Empire in the area at the time. Selimovi\u0107 was a member of Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts.Me\u0161a SELIMOVI\u0106 . Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts ==Works== Selimovi\u0107 began writing fairly late in his life. His first short story (Pjesma u oluji / A song in the storm) was published in 1948, when he was thirty-six. His first book, a collection of short stories Prva \u010deta (The First Company) was published in 1950 when he was forty. His subsequent work, Ti\u0161ine (Silences) was published eleven years later in 1961. The following books Tu\u0111a zemlja (Foreign land, 1962) and Magla i mjese\u010dina (Mist and Moonlight, 1965) did not receive widespread recognition either. However, his novel Death and the Dervish (Dervi\u0161 i smrt, 1966) was widely received as a masterpiece. The plot of the novel takes place in 18th-century Sarajevo under Ottoman rule, and reflects Selimovi\u0107's own torment of the execution of his brother; the story speaks of the futility of one man's resistance against a repressive system, and the change that takes place within that man after he becomes a part of that very system. Some critics have likened this novel to Kafka's The Trial. It has been translated into many languages, including English, Russian, German, French, Italian, Turkish and Arabic. Each chapter of the novel opens with a Qur'an citation, the first being: \"In the name of God, the most compassionate, the most merciful.\" The next novel, Tvr\u0111ava (The Fortress, 1970), placed still further in the past, is slightly more optimistic, and fulfilled with faith in love, unlike the lonely contemplations and fear in Death and the Dervish. The Fortress and Death and the Dervish are the only novels of Selimovi\u0107 that have thus far been translated into English. Subsequent novels Ostrvo (The Island, 1974), featuring an elderly couple facing aging and eventual death on a Dalmatian island, and posthumously published Krug (The Circle, 1983), have not been translated into English. He also wrote a book about Vuk Karad\u017ei\u0107's orthographic reforms Za i protiv Vuka (For and Against Vuk),http://www.rastko.rs/rastko- bl/umetnost/knjizevnost/mselimovic/mselimovic-vuk_l.html as well as his autobiography, Sje\u0107anja. ==Bibliography== Plaque at his former home in Belgrade *Uvrije\u0111eni \u010dovjek (An Insulted Man) (1947) *Prva \u010deta (The First Company) (1950) *Tu\u0111a zemlja (Foreign Lands) (1957) *Sje\u0107anja (Memories) (1957) *No\u0107i i jutra (Nights and Days) (film scenario) (1958) *Ti\u0161ine (Silence) (1961) *Magla i mjese\u010dina (Mist and Moonlight) (1965) *Eseji i ogledi (Essays and Reflections) (1966) *Dervi\u0161 i smrt (Death and the Dervish) (1966) *Za i protiv Vuka (Pro et Contra Vuk) (1967) *Tvr\u0111ava (The Fortress) (1970) *Ostrvo (The Island) (1974) *Krug (The Circle) (1983) ===Translations into English=== *Death and the Dervish, 1996, Northwestern University Press, *The Fortress, 1999, Northwestern University Press, ==References== ;Citations ==External links== *Death and the Dervish by Mesa Selimovic (fragments), translated by Lazar Pascanovic *Mesa Selimovic in South Slavic Literature Library *For and Against Vuk, study by Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107, 1967; courtesy of Project Rastko \u2013 Banja Luka *Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107's 'Oriental Novels' *Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107's parts of biography *Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107 \u2013 Facebook page Category:1910 births Category:1982 deaths Category:People from Tuzla Category:20th-century novelists Category:Serbian writers Category:Yugoslav writers Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina writers Category:Yugoslav Partisans members Category:University of Belgrade Faculty of Philology alumni Category:Members of the Association of Writers of Serbia Category:Members of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts Category:Burials at Belgrade New Cemetery ",
