In 1988, she was at the Winter Olympics in Calgary, slated to compete in the 1,500 m. However, an injury forced her to withdraw just minutes before the start of her race. She had her best year in 1989 when she became World Allround Champion, won silver at the European Allround Championships, and also won the World Cup on the 1,500 m, as well as ending third on the 1,000 m and the 3,000/5,000 m. She also won 4 medals at various German Championships in that same year. In 1990, she won a bronze medal at the World Allround Championships. After the birth of her daughter Elisa Moser on 27 November 1990, she ended her speed skating career. Currently, she works at the Th\u00fcringen Department of Economics. ==Medals== An overview of medals won by Moser-Scandolo at important championships she participated in, listing the years in which she won each: {| class=\"wikitable\" !
