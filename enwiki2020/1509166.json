    "text": "Andr\u00e9 Marcel L\u00e9v\u00eaque (23 October 1896 - 1 March 1930) was a French engineer, famous for his work on heat transfer. ==Career in the army== Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque was born at Beauvais, France, as the first son of Henri Eug\u00e8ne L\u00e9v\u00eaque and his wife, Blanche Eug\u00e9nie Paintr\u00e9. During World War I (1914 - 1918), he served his country as a soldier, and was decorated with the croix de guerre. Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque joined the armed forces as a simple artillerist, but very soon, became an officer. Several times, he was cited as being very cold-blooded, serving in extremely dangerous situations. Three times (during the battles of the 14th and 15 July, as well as of the 20th of August 1918), he is said to have been exposed to poison gases (citation de l\u2019Association des Officiers de R\u00e9serve). ==Engineering education== After the war, as the first major in the competition, Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque was admitted to the famous \u00c9cole polytechnique in 1919 and graduated, ranking first on 25 July 1921 . There was no diploma awarded by the polytechnic in those times). Later, he continued his studies at the \u00c9cole des Mines and received his diploma in mining engineering [dipl\u00f4me d\u2019ing\u00e9nieur des Mines] on 9 August. 1923. On 30 March 1928, Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque defended his doctorate thesis entitled, Les lois de la transmission de chaleur par convection before a jury (MM. Koenigs, Fabry, Villat) of the Faculty of Science in Paris (Facult\u00e9 des Sciences de Paris). This thesis is published in full (192 printed pages) in the Annales des Mines, Tome XIII, p. 201-299, 305-362, 381-415. The most important part of his thesis deals with the derivation of an asymptotic equation of convective heat transfer in a fully developed flow (the L\u00e9v\u00eaque equation, p. 287), found on p. 283-299. The 47 references listed on p. 413-415, contain 24 papers of German authors, 13 of these, being from Wilhelm Nusselt, and one entitled Die W\u00e4rme\u00fcbertragung im Rohr from the Festschrift zur Hundertjahrfeier der Technischen Hochschule Karlsruhe, 1925. ==Career as an engineer== At the Corps de Mines, Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque became an engineer in July 1923. He was put in charge of the mines in the sub arrondissement of Arras-East at his hometown in B\u00e9thune in 1924, and of the sub arrondissement B\u00e9thune East in 1927. In that same year, he was named Engineer-in-Chief of the first class. ==Personal life== At B\u00e9thune, on 24 July 1925, Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque married Clotilde Marie Elise Foret who was born at Carvin on 19 February 1902. A daughter seems to have been born in 1925; unfortunately she died in 1928 at the age of three. In 1929, his son, Jean Andr\u00e9 Eug\u00e8ne L\u00e9v\u00eaque, was born. Twenty years later, in 1949, the younger L\u00e9v\u00eaque was admitted to the Ecole polytechnique, the polytechnic that Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque attended. Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaque died on 1 March 1930 from tuberculosis at Pau, in a suburb called Bizanos. This place, close to the Pyrenees, has been recommended to him by the doctors because of the better air quality. He was buried at Beauvais, where he was born, only 33 years and 4 months before. Note: The biographical data obtained from the Mairies de Beauvais (Oise) et de B\u00e9thune (Pas de Calais), from the \u00c9cole des Mines, and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, Paris and especially from Andr\u00e9 L\u00e9v\u00eaques son, M. Jean L\u00e9v\u00eaque, Boulogne/Seine, are gratefully acknowledged. ==External links== * https://web.archive.org/web/20050609083839/http://student.dcu.ie/~mcmahon4/hm_leveque.html Category:1896 births Category:1930 deaths Category:French engineers Category:French military personnel Category:\u00c9cole Polytechnique alumni Category:20th-century engineers ",
