The 16 teams allocated into four pots were drawn into four groups of four teams. The country protection rule was applied, i.e. two clubs from the same country could not face each other in the same group. In each group, teams played against each other home-and-away in a round-robin format. The matchdays were 13\u201314 February, 20\u201321 February, 27\u201328 February, 5\u20136 March, 19\u201320 March, and 26\u201327 March 2016. If two or more teams are equal on points on completion of the group matches, the following criteria are applied to determine the rankings (in descending order): #number of points in matches of all teams directly involved; #goal difference in matches of all teams directly involved; #higher number of plus goals in matches of all teams directly involved; #goal difference in all matches of the group; #higher number of plus goals in all matches of the group; If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by drawing lots. Lots shall be drawn by the EHF, if possible in the presence of a responsible of each club. ===Seeding=== On 3 December 2015, EHF announced the composition of the group phase seeding pots. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=25%| Pot 1 !width=25%| Pot 2 !width=25%| Pot 3 !width=25%| Pot 4 |- | Fraikin BM.

The first pot contained the three group winners and the second pot contained the top three second-placed teams. {| |- valign=top | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=205| Pot 1 |- | SC Magdeburg |- | Bjerringbro-Silkeborg |- | Chambery Savoie Handball |} | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=205| Pot 2 |- | Fraikin BM Granollers |- | Frisch Auf G\u00f6ppingen |- | Saint-Raphael Var Handball |} |} |} ===Final four=== ==Top goalscorers== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Name !Team !Goals |- |1 |align=\"left\"| Ferran Sol\u00e9 |align=\"left\"| Fraikin BM.
