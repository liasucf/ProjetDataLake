    "text": "1797 was the eleventh season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). It also marked the completion of 200 years since the earliest known definite reference to the sport in January 1597 (Julian date). MCC enjoyed great success on the field, winning nine of their eleven known matches. == Matches == {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"5\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" ! width=\"125\" align=\"left\" | Date ! width=\"250\" align=\"left\" | Match Title ! width=\"125\" align=\"left\" | Venue ! width=\"50\" align=\"left\" | Source ! width=\"200\" align=\"left\" | Result |- | 11\u201312 May (Th-F) | MCC v Middlesex | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB214 | MCC won by 6 wkts |- | colspan=\"5\" | |- | 15\u201316 May (M-Tu) | C Lennox v Earl of Winchilsea | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB214 | Lennox's XI won by 132 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" | |- | 19\u201320 May (F-S) | Lennox v Earl of Winchilsea | Lord's (Dorset Square) | SB215 | Winchilsea's XI won by innings & 94 runs |- | colspan=\"5\" | WDC has this game taking place on 10\u201311 May and ACS includes both entries.

Pontifex (MCC; amateur) - played 15 matches from 1797 to 1810 * Hon. Charles Douglas (MCC; amateur) - played 13 matches from 1797 to 1799 * Benjamin Clifton (Middlesex; amateur) - played eleven matches from 1797 to 1798 * G. Cooper (MCC cricketer) (MCC; amateur) - played six matches from 1797 to 1807 * Earl of Dalkeith (MCC; amateur) - played four matches in 1797 * May (Hampshire cricketer) - played four matches from 1797 to 1798 * Lord Yarmouth (MCC and Surrey; amateur) - played three matches from 1797 to 1799 * Clair (Hampshire cricketer) - played two matches from 1797 to 1803 * Gunnell (Surrey cricketer) - played two matches from 1797 to 1810 * Wilson (Surrey cricketer) - played two matches from 1797 to 1809 ==Leading batsmen== Note that many scorecards in the 18th century are unknown or have missing details and so it is impossible to provide a complete analysis of batting performances: e.g., the missing not outs prevent computation of batting averages. The \"runs scored\" are in fact the runs known. Lord Frederick Beauclerk scored 758 runs to top the 1797 run-scoring list Others who scored more than 200 runs were John Hammond 603; John Tufton 592; Tom Walker 491; William Beldham 430; Edward Bligh 382; William Fennex 346; Robert Robinson 310; James Aylward 296; Charles Lennox 270; Henry Tufton 246; Harry Walker 243; Jack Small 227; Thomas Ray 214 ==Leading bowlers== Note that the wickets credited to an 18th-century bowler were only those where he bowled the batsman out. The bowler was not credited with the wickets of batsmen who were caught out, even if it was \"caught and bowled\". In addition, the runs conceded by each bowler were not recorded so no analyses or averages can be computed. Lord Frederick Beauclerk with a massive haul of 66 wickets was easily the top bowler Other leading wicket-takers were John Wells 31; Thomas Boxall 24; Thomas Lord 20; Sylvester 20; John Hammond 18 ==Leading fielders== Note that many scorecards in the 18th century are unknown or have missing details and so the totals are of the known catches and stumpings only. Stumpings were not always recorded as such and sometimes the name of the wicket-keeper was not given. Generally, a catch was given the same status as \"bowled\" with credit being awarded to the fielder only and not the bowler. There is never a record of \"caught and bowled\": the bowler would be credited with the catch, not with the wicket. Thomas Ray took the most known catches with 19 but he may have been beaten by John Tufton who definitely took 18 (plus one definite stumping) but could have had more. The Tufton brothers again starred in the field and Henry was the best keeper with 11 ct, 15 st. There were another 3 catches and 3 stumpings credited to one or other of the Tuftons. Other good performances were by Charles Lennox 16 ct, 1 st; Lord Frederick Beauclerk 12 ct; John Wells 11 ct 5 st; Edward Bligh 10 ct; William Beldham 9 ct; William Fennex 9 ct; Andrew Freemantle 9 ct; John Hammond 9 ct, 7 st; Sylvester 8 ct ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * ==Further reading== * * * * * Britcher, Samuel, A list of all the principal Matches of Cricket that have been played (1790 to 1805), annual series * * * ==External links== * * Category:1797 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1787 to 1815 ",
