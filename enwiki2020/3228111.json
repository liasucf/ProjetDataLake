It is located in Lawngtlai district, in the southeastern region of Mizoram near the Myanmar border. ==Geography== Phawngpui is the highest peak of the Lushai Hills. There is a semi-circular series of cliffs on the western side called Thlazuang Kh\u00e0m, which have a sharp and deep fall, and serve as the natural home of mountain goats. These cliffs are believed to be haunted by spirits. On the peak, there is a level ground of about 2 km2 in area. ==Etymology and origin== A highly revered peak, considered to be the abode of local deities, Phawngpui was a major centre of folk religion and location for folklore stories. The name is derived from the Lai language, phong meaning \"grassland\" or \"meadow\", and the suffix -pui meaning, \"great\". This was because the mountain was mostly covered with all types of meadows, hence appropriately the \"great meadow\". The mountain was, according to the belief of the natives, the abode of several spiritual races. The most important folktale, perhaps, is that of a deity king named \"Sangau\"; the actual town at the base of the mountain has become Sangau. Sangau had a son who married the princess of another royal family called Cherian. At the wedding was an exchange of gifts, a couple of hoolock gibbons from Sangau and a pine tree from Cherian. The base area, the main entrance of the mountain bears that name Farpak (meaning \"pine only\"). ==Conservation== Since 1992 the mountain has been included in the protected area of the Phawngpui National Park, one of only two national parks of India in Mizoram. The Government of Mizoram allows ecofriendly visit to the mountain only during November to April. ==Flora and fauna== The area is encircled by matted bamboo groves and other alluring vegetations. There are varieties of butterflies, including some rare species found in this region. The Farpak area in Phawngpui is a huge grassland adjacent to a cliff area where one can sight birds like peregrine falcon, Blyth's tragopan, sunbirds, grey sibia, golden-throated barbet, Mrs. Hume's pheasant, hornbill, dark-rumped swift, mountain bamboo partridge, black eagle and other birds. The very rare clouded leopard has been recorded in the Farpak area since 1997. There have been instances of wild orchids being stolen from Phawngpui, efforts are being taken to protect and conserve it. ==See also== *List of mountains in India *Phawngpui National Park ==Gallery== File:2007-blue-mountain-np.jpg|Park at sunrise File:2007-blue-mtn- farpak.jpg|Farpak grassland ==References== ==External links== # Mizoram Tourism ''' Category:Lushai Hills Category:Hills of Mizoram Category:Tourist attractions in Mizoram Category:Highest points of Indian states and union territories Category:Mountains of Mizoram ",
