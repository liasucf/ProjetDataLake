The lower molars also have a long and obliquely directed cristid obliqua and a small paraconid on the first molar. The lower molars of this species had sharply defined and high occlusal crests and cusps. Based upon the jaw bone, Oligopithecus savagei had a body mass of . ==Range== Oligopithecus savagei was found in Africa and discovered in Egypt. ==References== ==External links== * Mikko's Phylogeny archive Category:Oligocene mammals of Africa Category:Oligocene primates \u2020Oligopithecus Category:Prehistoric primate genera Category:Fossil taxa described in 1962 ",
