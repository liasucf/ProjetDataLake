By Mary Breux he had several children. His descendant Rachel Waller, daughter of Edmund Waller VI or VII, considering the Breux family's connections with Barbadoes wrote in 1939 that: this probably gave rise to the assumption that she was not of pure European blood.

In these latter, the long face and aquiline lineaments of the poet have given way to round blunt features and curly black hair.Notes on Past Days, by Cecil and Rachel De Salis, Henley-on-Thames, 1939, page 5 The children included: *Benjamin, somewhat lacking in his father's wit, he was sent to Jersey, a colony in the West Indies;Poems, &c.; written upon several occasions, and to several persons, By Edmund Waller, with An Account of the life and writings of Edmund Waller, printed for Jacob Tonson, in the Strand, 1722 *Edmund II or III (1652-dsp Bristol1699/1700), MP for Amersham 1689-98,The History of Parliament: the House of Commons 1690-1715, ed.
