    "text": "St. Louis\u2013San Francisco Railway (reporting mark SLSF, also known as the \"Frisco\") locomotive 4500 is a 4-8-4 Northern type steam engine. ==History== No. 4500 was built as an oil-burning steam locomotive by Baldwin in 1942 for Frisco passenger service. It was the first 4-8-4 Northern that Frisco ordered. Along with similar locomotives 4501 and 4502, it was painted in the zephyr blue, white and gray paint scheme with \"Meteor\" spelled out on the side of the tender in bold, red letters. It was used for pulling Frisco's crack Meteor train service. No. 4500 even saw service pulling Frisco's Texas Special. When the Meteor was dieselized, No. 4500 was re-painted into Frisco's standard black with gold striping and lettering, and assigned to passenger trains such as the Will Rogers. ==Specifications== While the Frisco 4500-series 4-8-4s designed to be coal-burning weighed 462,500 lbs, oil-burning models like Numbers 4500 to 4502 weighed 454,000 lbs. But the whole series had 74\" drivers, 28 x 31 cylinders, a boiler pressure of 250 psi, and a tractive effort of 69,800 pounds. ==Preservation== No. 4500 was repainted back into the Meteor paint scheme and is on static display for free public viewing at the Route 66 Village at 3770 Southwest Blvd. in Tulsa, Oklahoma. ==References== * Class 4500 specs 4500 Category:4-8-4 locomotives Category:Baldwin locomotives Category:Individual locomotives of the United States Category:Preserved steam locomotives of the United States Category:Passenger locomotives Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1942 ",
