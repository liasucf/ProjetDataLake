Laid down on 10 April 1944 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, by the Dravo Corporation, Neville Island; launched on 20 May 1944; sponsored by Mrs. George W. Scott; and commissioned on 23 June 1944, Lt. Ralph B. Flynn in command. ==Service history== During World War II, LST 749 was assigned to the Pacific theater and participated in the Leyte landings in October and November 1944. On the way to Mindoro, Philippines, in the Sulu Sea, she was struck by a Japanese kamikaze on 21 December 1944. The plane crashed into the bridge of the LST, instantly killing many of the navy personnel on board. The LST floundered and a first attempt at rescue was abandoned for fear of an explosion. Eventually many of the survivors were rescued by the crew of the destroyer . The ship was struck from the Navy list on 19 January 1945. LST-749 earned one battle star for World War II service. Edward A. Ferguson was an engineer being transported by LST-749 to Mindoro. He was having lunch on the deck of LST-749 when the aerial attack began and his memoirs of this event and others have been donated to the Utah State University library. ==See also== * List of United States Navy LSTs ==References== * * ==External links== * Edward A.
