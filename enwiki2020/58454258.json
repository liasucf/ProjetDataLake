Ptolemy mentions a place Spercheia between Echinus and Thebes in Phthiotis; and Pliny the Elder places Sperchios in Doris. William Smith concludes it probable that these three names indicate the same place. Livy relates that the place was destroyed by the Aetolians in 198 BCE. Sperchiae's site is at a place called Kastrorakhi. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Former populated places in Greece Category:Ainis ",
