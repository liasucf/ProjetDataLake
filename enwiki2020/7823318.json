    "text": "On November 7, 2006, a deadly tornado struck the town of Saroma, Hokkaid\u014d in northern Japan. The tornado destroyed forty buildings. Nine people were confirmed dead and 26 people injured (seven seriously) as of November 9, 2006.http://www.asahi.com/english/Herald-asahi/TKY200611090156.html Most of the casualties occurred at the work site for a tunnel, where the storm swept over prefabricated housing that was being used by workers. The Japan Meteorological Agency says the tornado is the deadliest ever recorded in Japan. The previous recent most deadly tornado occurred September 18, 2006, killing three people on the southern island of Ky\u016bsh\u016b. The agency's records only go back to 1961, however. The previous deadliest tornado struck Toyohashi City, Aichi Prefecture in 1941, killing 12; and the deadliest killed 16 in Miyazaki, Miyazaki Prefecture in 1881.Japanese Tornadoes Not As Uncommon as Believed The November tornado also took out power to approximately 600 homes and destroyed 40 separate buildings. The meteorological agency estimates a wind speed for the tornado at more than F2 on the Fujita scale. The tornado was later confirmed as an F3. It was likely a low-mild F3 with winds around 160-165mph, well built, conventional earthquake resistant homes lost their roofs and some walls and even conventional multi floor houses lost their stories as well, cars were thrown for a short distance and overturned, and poorly built structures were swept away entirely. Stronger reinforced-concrete buildings had partial roof collapse, all doors blown in, and total loss of glass windows; they also lost the entrances if they were not made of steel- reinforced concrete, patios were swept away, and garages were blown in.https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Damage-to-construction-work-offices- due-to-a-tornado-in-Saroma-cho-Hokkaido-Japan- on_fig1_311838885https://extremeplanet.me/tag/hokkaido-tornado/ == See also == * Tornadoes of 2006 * List of Asian tornadoes and tornado outbreaks == References == Category:2006 in Japan Category:Tornadoes of 2006 Tornadoes Category:History of Hokkaido Category:F3 tornadoes Category:November 2006 events in Asia Category:Tornadoes in Japan ",
