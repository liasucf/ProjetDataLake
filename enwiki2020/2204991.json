The company merged with Bass in 1961. With the brand currently under ownership of Coors Brewers, the brewery closed in 2002 with production switched to Burton upon Trent. Their most famous beer was Brew XI (using Roman numerals, and so pronounced Brew Eleven), advertised with the slogan \"for the men of the Midlands\". It is now brewed under licence for Coors by Brains of Cardiff. ===Bass=== Bass plc, based in Burton-on-Trent, transformed into separate brewing and retail divisions following the Beer Orders of 1989 and then proceeded to build a large hotel portfolio alongside its bingo, betting and electronic leisure interests. In the late 1990s the latter interests were sold. On 21 July 1995, Bass bought 78 Harvester restaurants for \u00a3165 million from the Forte Group. ===Six Continents=== In 2000, Bass also divested its brewing arm and rebranded itself Six Continents before another split in April 2003 into two separate companies, with the hotel assets forming InterContinental Hotels Group and the Mitchells & Butlers name brought back for the pubs and restaurants company. In March 2003, Six Continents fought off a proposed \u00a35.5 billion takeover by Hugh Osmond (Punch Taverns). ===M and B=== Mitchells & Butlers was formed on 15 April 2003. In April 2006, it was approached by a consortium led by Robert Tchenguiz in a \u00a32.7 billion takeover, which was dropped in May 2006. In February 2008, Punch Taverns offered to merge with Mitchells & Butlers, but decided not to in April 2008. Mitchells & Butlers then took an interest in Punch's subsidiary, Spirit Group. ===Financial loss=== A Harvester pub with adjacent Travelodge in Colton, Leeds In January 2008, Mitchells & Butlers announced significant losses (\u00a3274million) arising out of closure of hedge positions taken in anticipation of a property joint venture that were eventually cancelled due to the credit crunch caused by the subprime mortgage financial crisis. ===Acquisitions=== By 2006, Mitchells & Butlers had 130 Harvester restaurants. In 2001, it added Arena, Ember Inns, Flares, Goose, Sizzling Pub Co, Browns, Alex and Inn Keeper's Lodge to its list of brands. In July 2006, Mitchells & Butlers purchased 239 pub restaurants (Beefeater and Brewers Fayre without a Premier Inn) from Whitbread for \u00a3497 million to strengthen its food business ahead of the introduction of a smoking ban in enclosed public spaces in England in 2007. It had first announced its interest in April 2006. In July 2008 Mitchells & Butlers bought 44 restaurants from Whitbread \u2013 its former Brewers Fayre and Beefeater outlets that were not next to a Premier Inn. In September 2010 Mitchells & Butlers bought the 22 restaurants of the (upmarket) Ha Ha! chain from the Bay Restaurant Group for \u00a319.5 million. Twelve were turned into All Bar One and six into Browns Restaurants. The Ha Ha! brand disappeared. In June 2014, the company announced plans to acquire the bulk of one of its major competitors, Orchid Group, for \u00a3266 million. The acquisition included 173 pubs. ===Sale of pubs=== In October 2006, Mitchells & Butlers sold off 102 of its smaller community pubs to Chorley-based Trust Inns for \u00a3101 million. On 15 July 2010, it was announced that Travelodge had acquired the leases of 52 Innkeeper's Lodge Hotels around Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool, Northampton, Milton Keynes and Leeds areas from Mitchells & Butlers. It also sold its 25 Hollywood Bowl outlets in August 2010 for \u00a339 million to AMF Bowling. In November 2010, Mitchells & Butlers sold 333 pubs to the Stonegate Pub Company (of London and owned by TDR Capital) for \u00a3373 million. ===Poor results and dismissal of CEO=== In September 2015, Mitchells & Butlers issued a profits warning and dismissed CEO Alistair Darby. He was replaced by Phil Urban, who joined as COO in January from Grosvenor Casinos and previously ran Whitbread's pub restaurants division. ==Operations== Mitchells & Butlers owns several brands of pubs, including: * Alex * All Bar One * Browns Restaurants * Castle * Crown Carveries * Ember Inns * Harvester * Innkeeper's Lodge * Oak Tree * Orchid Pubs * Premium Country Pubs (formerly Premium Country Dining Group) * Miller and Carter * Nicholson's * O'Neill's * Sizzling Pubs * Stonehouse Pizza & Carvery * Toby Carvery * Vintage Inns Nicholson's pubs tend to be historic pubs aimed at the tourist market, located in London and other historic cities.
