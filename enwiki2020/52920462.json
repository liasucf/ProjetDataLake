In 2016 the couple committed US$1 billion to support the institute\u2019s work, which focuses on research in three core areas \u2013 brain discovery, brain treatment and brain development. Towards that end, the institute supports interdisciplinary research concerning neuroscience, particularly research on brain mechanics, perception,\"Focus Vision Cornerstone Partnerships\" - Chen Institute and the impact of perception on behavior and well-being.\"The Mysterious Case of the Missing Internet Billionaire\" - Bloomberg - Yoolim Lee - August 15, 2017 ==History== === Background === The Chen Institute was founded by Chrissy and Tianqiao Chen, both philanthropists known for co- founding the Chinese conglomerate Shanda Group in 1999.Kerry Dolan, They decided to create the Chen Institute to fund various brain-related research initiatives and institutions,\"Why Chinese billionaire Tianqiao Chen transitioned from investing in video games to CHS, neuroscience\" - Becker's Hospital Review - Alyssa Rage - August 17, 2017 citing a project by Caltech scientist David J. Anderson as being particularly inspirational. Upon seeing Richard A Andersen's, who along with David J.

The couple subsequently set aside $1 billion to donate to related efforts on brain-related treatment, as well as research and development.\"Chinese Donors Step Up Giving to American Universities\" - The Chronicle of Higher Education - Mimi Leung - December 21, 2016 They then spent two years researching possible partners. In March 2017, the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute announced a plan to annually donate around $100 million each year. With the goal of \"[passing] the ball to whoever is closest to the goal,\" new proposals from universities would be gauged for at least a year each, and after that point, money would be donated to scientists directly. === Caltech institute === In its first donation,Qian Tongxin, \"Chinese investor in CHS donates $115 million for brain research\" - Modern Healthcare - Dave Barkholz - December 7, 2016 on December 8, 2016 it was announced that the Chen Institute was donating $115 million to fund the formation of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience at Caltech. The Chens stated that they selected Caltech as the first recipient because of the school's entrepreneurial and interdisciplinary approach to the field. The $115 million Caltech donation resulted in some controversy in Chinese academia, with arguments made that the donations would have been more beneficial to a Chinese university. Other academics defended the donation on the grounds that Chinese universities were often less transparent,\"Should Chinese Billionaires Donate Overseas?\" - Beijing Review - Chris Surtees - January 5, 2017\"Are Chinese donations to US college unpatriotic?\" - China Daily - December 24, 2016 noting that the Chens had previously withheld gifts to Chinese institutions when they refused to provide usage reports. The funds were set aside to establish the new institute's building and provide Caltech with continuous resources for neuroscience research, with direction of that research to be decided by the university. It was announced that the upcoming building would serve as the administrative center for the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience,\"Billionaire-Backed Brain Research Center Breaks Ground at Caltech\" - Pasadena Now - Brandon Villalovos - December 6, 2017 and house five interdisciplinary research centers which together formed \"the core of the Chen Institute.\" The university explained that the research complex\"CHS' largest shareholder donates $115M to Caltech for brain research\" - Becker's Hospital Review - Ayla Ellison - December 8, 2016 would combine \"biology, engineering, chemistry, physics, computer science and the social sciences to tackle brain function in an integrated, comprehensive way.\" In August 2017, it was announced that David J. Anderson would serve as director of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience. Also that month, plans for the new Caltech building were heard by the design commission of Pasadena. The groundbreaking of the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Neuroscience Research Building took place in December 2017. With construction to begin in January 2018, the opening was scheduled for the fall of 2020. === Shanghai institute === In November 2017, the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute announced that $80 million would fund The Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Brain Disease (Shanghai). The nonprofit brain disease institute was formed as a partnership with Huashan Hospital in Shanghai, which in turn is affiliated with Fudan University, and Zhou Liangfu Foundation. The institute announced a focus on international collaboration and brain disease research,\"TCCI Establishes the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Brain Disease (Shanghai) in Partnership with Huashan Hospital and Zhou Liangfu Foundation\" - Chen Institute - November 2, 2017 with plans to study \"brain tumors, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Parkinson\u2019s disease, depression and other brain ailments.\" In June 2018, the institute announced that it was partnering with the Shanghai Mental Health Center to fund the study of mental illness.\"Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute Signs Agreement with Shanghai Mental Health Center\" - Chen Institute - June 6, 2018 == Areas of focus and mission == The Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen InstituteJeevan Vasagar, Kerry Dolan, is interested in three core areas: brain discovery, brain treatment, and brain development. In particular, the institute aims to support fundamental brain research with a focus on \"understanding the sensation-perception mechanisms and related systems of memory, attention, learning and expectations.\" The institute's stated goal is to fund universities and institutions in forms such as endowed institutes,\"Design Commission Hears Details of Major New Caltech Research Center\" - Pasadena Now - August 7, 2017 grants for researchers, professorships, or \"topic-specific programs\" for scientists. Co-founder Tianqiao Chen has explained that \"the key of [the institute's] philanthropy vision\" is furthering understanding of perception, arguing that such research would help people master negative emotions. According to Chen, \u201cfor thousands of years, we improved our happiness through changing the physical world. We now have to solve this problem by exploring inward. == Programs and institutions == *The Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Neuroscience at Caltech *The T&C; Chen Brain-Machine Interface Center *The T&C; Chen Center for Social and Decision Neuroscience *The T&C; Chen Center for Systems Neuroscience *The Center for Molecular and Cellular Neuroscience *The Caltech Brain Imaging Center *The Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute for Brain Disease (Shanghai) == Research and recognition == Since its inception, researchers at the Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute at Caltech have published work on topics such as aiding paralyzed patients feel sensation,\"Paralyzed Patient Feels Sensation Again\" - Caltech - April 10, 2018 the neural processes associated with fear,\"You Don't Think Your Way Out of a Tiger Attack\" - Caltech - March 5, 2018 deciphering how the brain manages thirst,\"Hierarchical neural architecture underlying thirst regulation\" - Macmillan Publishers Limited - 2018 the mechanisms behind memory recollection,\"New Caltech Research Provides Insight into How the Brain Works to Recall Memories\" - Pasadena Now - Lori Dajose - December 19, 2017 the neural codes for body movements, and others.\"The Neural Codes for Body Movements\" - Caltech - July 20, 2017 A number of Tianqiao and Chrissy Chen Institute researchers have received awards for their work.
