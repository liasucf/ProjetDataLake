    "text": "1871 was the 85th season of cricket in England since the foundation of Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Derbyshire County Cricket Club became a first- class club and the last matches were played by Cambridgeshire, who in the days of Bob Carpenter, the first Tom Hayward and George Tarrant had been one of the leading cricket counties. W. G. Grace surpassed his previous season\u2019s record of 1,808 runs and his 1869 average of 57.39 by scoring 2,739 at the outstanding average of 78.25 at a time when most pitches were still unrolled and very dangerous to batsmen \u2013 though the heavy roller was already producing major improvements to Lord\u2019s and eliminating the bottom-of-the-stump shooters.Baily\u2019s Magazine of Sports and Pastimes, Volume 20 (1871); p. 286 These records were not beaten until Arthur Shrewsbury averaged 78.71 in 1887 and Ranjitsinhji scored 2,780 runs in 1896. ==Playing record (by county)== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

This was blamed on the reluctance of the leading players in the county to appear for the Cambridgeshire side, preferring to play for the touring elevens.First Class Cricket Matches 1871 \u2013 ACS \u2013 Nottingham Ed. Robert W Brooke * In Derbyshire\u2019s opening season the club played its initial first-class match v. Lancashire at Old Trafford on 26 and 27 May. * Middlesex CCC, after being threatened with disbanding due to lack of a ground,Wisden, John (editor); John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers' Almanac; Eighth Edition (1871); p. 121 acquired the Lillie Bridge ground in West Brompton as a \"home\" venue, but played only one match there. * Prince's Cricket Ground was opened on former market gardens in Chelsea by two brothers dissatisfied with the condition of the Lord\u2019s pitchRae, Simon; W. G. Grace: A Life; p. 106 \u2013 ironically Lord\u2019s improved markedly this very season. Prince\u2019s was a major ground in the middle 1870s but was built-on between 1877 and 1886. * 28 June: William Game, with 281 for Sherborne against Motcombe, hit the first double century in a public school gameWisden, John (editor); John Wisden\u2019s Cricketers' Almanac; Eighth Edition (1871); pp. 148\u2013149 * W. G. Grace caused a sensation by scoring 2,739 runs \u2013 this being the first time 2,000 was exceeded. He was to repeat the feat in 1876 and 1887, but no other player was to equal Grace until Andrew Stoddart and William Gunn did so in 1893. Grace's dominance is shown by comparing his figures for the season with the next best. Richard Daft had the next highest average among batsmen playing 10 innings or more, with 37.66, less than half Grace\u2019s figure. Harry Jupp had the next highest runs aggregate, with 1068. * With ten centuries, Grace beat his 1869 record of six in one season. This was not equalled until Ranjitsinhji in 1896 and beaten by Ranji in 1900. No other batsman made more than a single hundred. * Surrey played thirteen county games without a single win, an ignominy not surpassed until Derbyshire in 1897 played sixteen winless games. Surrey were not to fail to win a single county game again until 2008. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite's Cricketer's Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1872 * James Lillywhite's Cricketers' Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1872 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack, 1872 ==Notes== Hampshire, though regarded until 1885 as first-class, played no inter-county matches between 1868 and 1869 or 1871 and 1874 ==External links== * CricketArchive \u2013 season summaries Category:1871 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
