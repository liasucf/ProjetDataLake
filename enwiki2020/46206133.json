Therefore, it is also called Chaozhou Daa Laang, which refers to the popular cold cuts and hot dishes from the food stalls in Chaozhou. Marinated food, seafood, pickled products and cooked dishes are the four main types of Daa Laang. It was then spread into Hong Kong by immigrants from Chaozhou in the 1950s.

Hence, the word \u201cdaa\u201d can refer to eat at a restaurant.\" \u5b57\u8a5e\u6eaf\u6e90\uff1a\u300c\u6253\u51b7\u300d\u8d77\u6e90\", Retrieved 1 June 2004 * The word \u201claang\u201d specifies Chaozhou, because it means \"people\" in their dialect. Thus, Guangdong People are used to call the people in Chaozhou as \u201c\u51b7\u4f6c\u201d (Cantonese: laang5lou2). When they say they are going to the places of \"Laang Lou\" for dinner, in fact they mean going to the Chaozhou stalls.http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/supplement/food/art/20130307/18186576 Then gradually the term Daa Laang was formed at referring to dinner at Hong Kong\u2019s Chaozhou stalls. === Influence of Teochew dialect === * In the 1950s, there were many Teochew people selling late-night supper and marinated food at Hong Kong\u2019s streets. They used to carry baskets with poles on their shoulders, and then peddled along the streets. They were called as the \u201cbasket carriers\u201d. The pronunciation of this term in Chaoshan is similar to \u201cdaa laang\u201d, so then Hong Kong people call them the Daa Laangs. In the course of time, \u201cDaa Laang\u201d became the term that represents eating Teochew cuisine in Hong Kong.\"\u7cb5\u6e2f\u6fb3\u751f\u6d3b\u5708\uff1a\u6e2f\u300c\u6f6e\u300d\u4eba\u6df1\u7a57\u300c\u6253\u51b7\u300d\u5403\u5bb6\u9109\u5473\", Retrieved 9 January 2015 *Besides, at that period, many gangs dined and dashed at the Chaozhou stalls, then a Chaozhou gang was formed in Hong Kong to show the Chaozhou\u2019s solidarity. Once they found someone who came for a meal, they would yell \u201chit them!\u201d to gather near- by fellows, so as to deal with these people. \u201cDaa Laang\u201d in Teochew dialect means \"hit them\", thus gradually people related Daa Laang and Chaozhou cuisine together.\"\u6f6e\u6c55\u7f8e\u5473\u5927\u641c\u7d22\", Retrieved 18 June 2012 == Dishes == Different food like cattlefish, beancurd and goose pieces are cooked with marinate sauce There is usually a counter put up all the marinated food for the chef to chop when customers need to takeaway. Salt and Pepper Tofu Oyster Meat congee One must- have item for Hong Kong people to go Daa Laang is called the marinated or the Chaozhou soy-sauce goose. The marinated sauce is adjusted by every top chef in the Daa Laang so there is a slight difference between every Daa Laang. People usually order marinated tofu and cuttlefish together with the goose or directly order a marinated combination to taste the effort by the chef. Another item that Daa Laang is famous for is the pepper and salt fried food. Daa Laang usually use some light food like tofu and squid to cook with.

For cold items, people will order iced cockle, which the chef will boils the cockle and freeze it, then serve it with a special sauce made with garlic, sugar and vinegar; and iced crab, the chef steams the live-crab with cold water until it is boiled. == Opinions == Having congee with Daa Laang already become a popular trend of supper among Hong Kong people since 1950s. People love socializing and gathering at the Chaozhou restaurant or Dai Pai Dong after working for the whole day as the dishes are very common and affordable-a bowl of Chaozhou congee only cost a few cents of Hong Kong dollars in the past. The old and well-known Daa Laang restaurants provide good service and the waiters usually wear smile as they have already worked for many years and built a close relationship with customers. == References == Category:Hong Kong cuisine Category:Chinese cuisine ",
