The company expanded, increasing the number of retail bakeries and in-store supermarket bakeries. In 1965, McGlynn\u2019s launched an innovative new approach to selling cakes by focusing on decorating cakes in view of consumers instead of the back room. In the 1970s, McGlynn\u2019s produced a book about decorated cakes, The Magic of Cakes. In 1982, DecoPac was formed as an internal unit supplying cake decorations to its own McGlynn\u2019s Bakery stores. Soon other bakeries learned of DecoPac through industry associations and DecoPac began marketing pre-packaged cake decorating kits, called DecoSets, to supermarkets, independent retail bakeries and bakery distributors. Since 1987, DecoPac has developed relationships and licensing agreements that give the company the right to market cake decorating products featuring popular characters and properties from Disney, Nickelodeon, Mattel, DreamWorks, Marvel Comics, LucasFilm, Warner Bros., Star Trek, Peanuts and professional sports such as from the NHL, NBA, NFL, and MLB. DecoPac acquired Culpitt, Ltd., a supplier and wholesaler of sugar crafting edibles and equipment in the UK, in 1998. Culpitt manufactures cake boards, cake decorations, sugar fondant sheets, printed edible cake decorations and molded sugar cake decorations and sells to customers in the UK, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In 2002, DecoPac launched Cakes.com to connect consumers with bakeries to place cake orders online. Since that time, Cakes.com has evolved and in 2014 began selling DecoSets and other cake decorating products directly to consumers for use in decorating their own cakes. In 2015 DecoPac purchased one of their largest competitors, Bakery Crafts. This strategic decision made them the world's largest supplier of cake decorations in the world.
