    "text": "Lady in a Fur Wrap is an oil painting attributed to Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello, dated to 1577-1579 and now held at the Pollok House in Glasgow. ==Description== Against a dark background a young woman gazes at the viewer, dressed in a fur robe covering the rest of her dress. A fine transparent veil covers her head, and vaguely a necklace can be seen that she is wearing underneath it. The robe falls into darkness behind its fur lining, that may be ermine or lynx. The painting is unsigned but has traditionally been attributed to El Greco since it was in the collection of French king Louis Philippe I and hung at the Louvre. It was purchased by Sir William Stirling-Maxwell at the king's estate sale of his 'Spanish Gallery' in 1853. It was bequeathed to the city of Glasgow along with Pollok House by his heirs in 1966.Art UK The painting's attribution has been brought into question and some have claimed it is by Sofonisba Anguissola. The sitter is also unknown, but considering the painting's royal provenance, the value of the fur and the jeweled necklace, various guesses have been made based on her widow's peak that it could be someone from Louis Philippe's royal family. Following an investigation by Museo del Prado, Glasgow Museums and The University of Glasgow the painting is now attributed to Alonso S\u00e1nchez Coello.
