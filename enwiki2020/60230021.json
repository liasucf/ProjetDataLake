    "text": "St Bernward of Hildesheim The Stammheim Missal (made between 1160 and 1170) is an illuminated manuscript Roman missal now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, which bought it from the barons of F\u00fcrstenberg's private collection; they sold it to raise funds to repair Schloss K\u00f6rtlinghausen. A Carolingian ivory diptych had been used on or for its binding, but was taken off in 1904 and was in the State Museums of Berlin, where it disappeared during the museum's bombing in 1945. It was produced by Henricus of Middel, a priest, for Hildesheim Abbey, and was later held at Stammheim Castle. It was made in the same era as the Ratmann Sacramentary. It is richly decorated with full-page miniatures, including one showing Bernward of Hildesheim (died 1022, subject of a local cult from 1150 and formally canonised in 1192). == References == Category:12th-century illuminated manuscripts Category:Illuminated manuscripts of the J.
