    "text": "Dutch rabbit The Dutch rabbit, also known as Hollander or Brabander is easily identifiable by its characteristic colour pattern, and was once the most popular of all rabbit breeds. However, after dwarf rabbits were developed, the popularity of the Dutch rabbit dwindled. Nevertheless, the Dutch rabbit remains one of the top ten most popular breeds worldwide. http://mom.me/pets/small-pets/19118-popular-pet-rabbit-breeds/item/dutch- rabbit/ \"Although the name suggests that the Dutch rabbit is from the Netherlands, it was actually developed in England. During the 1830s rabbits were imported to England from Ostend in Belgium every week for the meat market. Amongst these rabbits was a breed known as the Petit Braban\u00e7on, as it originated from Brabant in Flanders. The Petit Braban\u00e7on may still be found in paintings from the fifteenth century. The Dutch rabbit has its genetic roots in this old breed. The Petit Braban\u00e7on would often display Dutch markings, and breeders in England selected those with even markings, fixing those markings into the breed we know today.\" Dutch are popular both as pets and among show breeders. == Appearance == The American Rabbit Breeders Association standard calls for a small to medium rabbit. Dutch are a 4-class breed. Junior bucks and does are those under 6 months of age with a minimum weight of 1.75 lbs (0,793kg). Seniors are 6 months of age and over, weighing between 3.5 (1,58kg) and 5.5 lbs (2,48kg), with 4.5 (2,04kg) being the ideal weight. Dutch are to have a compact, well-rounded body; rounded head; short, stocky, well-furred ears; and short, glossy \"flyback\" fur. Six colors (in conjunction with white) are recognized for show: Black, a dense, glossy black with a slate blue undercolor. Eyes-- dark brown. Blue, a medium blue-gray with a slate blue undercolor. Eyes-- blue-gray. Chinchilla, (the newest variety to be recognized by the ARBA) an agouti color with bands of pearl white and black with a slate blue undercolor. The ears must have black lacing. Eyes-- brown (preferred). Chocolate, a rich chocolate brown with a dove-gray undercolor. Eyes-- brown (with a ruby cast). Gray, (UK: Brown Grey) an Agouti color similar to that of the American cottontail, with bands of color on the hairshaft which produce a ring effect when blown into. The bands of color should be a light tan, a thin charcoal band then a darker tan over a slate blue undercolor. Eyes--dark brown. Steel, (UK: Steel Grey) a black color with off-white tips to the hairshaft on some hairs. The undercolor is slate blue. Eyes-- dark brown. Tortoise, (UK: Tortoiseshell) a bright, clean orange with slate blue shadings along the ears, whisker beds and hindquarters. the undercolor is dark cream. Eyes-- dark brown. In the UK, Yellow (no US equivalent) and Pale Grey (US: Gold) Dutch are also recognized for show. New varieties under development in the United States include Harlequin (UK: Tri Coloured Dutch) (a pattern of black and orange patches) and Chinchilla. Despite its popularity, the Dutch rabbit has not changed much over the years. The most striking aspect of the breed is the marking pattern: The blaze is an even wedge of white running up the rabbit's face. It is shaped by the cheeks which are the rounded circles of color on either side of the face. The neck marking is a white wedge on the back of the head. The saddle is to be a straight line running behind the shoulders and continuing underneath the rabbit to the undercut across the belly. The stops are located on the rear feet, which should be white from the toes to a point one third the length of the foot. The American standard allots 50 of the 100 total points to markings, 25 points to general type, 10 points to color, 10 points to fur and 5 to condition.American Rabbit Breeders. extinct Association, Standard of Perfection 2006\u20132010 ==Personality== The Dutch Rabbit is in general a calm, easy-going rabbit.

Chinchillation - A mixture of colours ticked with a darker shade, often found on the cheeks of yellows. The steel, pale and brown grey are chinchillated varieties to a certain extent.
