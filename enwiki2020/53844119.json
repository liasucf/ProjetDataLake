He was made a Fellow of the American Physical Society after being nominated by their Division of Fluid Dynamics in 2006. Balachandar has contributed to the understanding of thermal convection in the earth's mantle, the structure of bluff body wakes and their effect on the dynamics of small particles, the dynamics of vortices in wall turbulence, and the theory of two- phase flow, including the equilibrium Euler formulation for dispersion force. == References == Category:Fellows of the American Physical Society Category:American physicists Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
