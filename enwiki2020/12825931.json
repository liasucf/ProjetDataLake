It was formerly part of Food Terminal Inc. before being sold to Ayala Land. == History == With the decline of FTI, there have been several attempts over multiple Philippines presidential administrations to sell off part of the property, including a public auction in 2009, but they all failed. In November 2012, the Philippine government announced the sale of the 74 hectares of the 120-hectare property to Ayala Land, Inc. for 24.3 billion Philippine pesos. Ayala plans to turn the property into a mixed-use development. Proceeds from the sale are pledged to the programs of the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Agrarian Reform. The remaining 46 hectares remains in FTI. In 2013, Ayala Land renamed their property into Arca South. == Current developments == === Residential === * Arbor Lanes * Gardencourt Residences * The Veranda * Park Cascades * Avida Towers One Union Place * Avida Towers Vireo === Commercial/Institutional === * Arca South Corporate Center * Ayala Malls Arca South (Transit, Regional, & Lifestyle Malls) * Sunshine Mall * Arca Main Street * Tryne Enterprise Plaza * Makati Development Corporation (MDC) Headquarters * Savya Financial Center * Bamberton Place * Z2 Tower * Mantra Corporate Plaza * QualiMed Hospital * Seda Hotel * AANI Outdoor Market == Transportation == === Land === The planned North\u2013South Commuter Railway and Metro Manila Subway Line 9's FTI station will be connected to the Taguig Integrated Terminal Exchange, which is located in Arca South. == References == == External links == * Official website Category:Mixed-use developments in Metro Manila Category:Buildings and structures in Taguig Category:Planned communities in the Philippines ",
