    "text": "Alice Seymour (January 10, 1857 \u2013 October 24, 1947) was an English follower of Joanna Southcott. Southcott predicted the second coming of Christ and had left prophesies to be used in time of crisis. == Life == Seymour was born in Plymouth. Her parents were members of the Christian Israelite Church who followed the evangelist John Wroe. She read the works of Joanna Southcott as a child. In 1907 she said she was visited by spirits who told her that she was to write a life of Joanna Southcott. She did this and it was published in 1909, \"The Express\". She had previously thought that she was to write a Southcott biography book with the Reverend Walter Begley, but he had died in 1905. The 1909 book was well received at the Daily News, which made it their book of the week. In 1914 she led a campaign to get the secret prophesies of Joanna Southcottt opened. The prophesies were intended for a moment of crisis and Southcott had laid down the conditions under which they could be opened including the presence of 24 bishops. Seymour created a group who followed the ideas of Southcott and she was in disagreement with the Panacea Society who she described as \"the Bedford group.\" Seymour died in Blockley in 1947 at Rock Cottage. == References == Category:1857 births Category:1947 deaths Category:People from Plymouth Category:Schoolteachers from Devon ",
