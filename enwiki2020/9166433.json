Federer had a chance for the second consecutive year to become the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to hold all four Grand Slam tournaments at once, having won the Wimbledon, U.S. Open and Australian Open, in 2006\u201307, but he lost the second consecutive final to Nadal, and for the third consecutive year (lost to Nadal in 2005 semifinal). Novak Djokovic, who would go on to hold all four Grand Slams at the 2016 French Open, made his first Slam semi-final at the event. Federer reached a record-breaking 8th consecutive Grand Slam final appearance (streak started at the 2005 Wimbledon Championships), surpassing Jack Crawford who had reached 7 consecutive finals between 1933 and 1934. ==Seeds== ==Qualifying draw== ==Draw== ===Finals=== ===Top half=== ====Section 1==== ====Section 2==== ====Section 3==== ====Section 4==== ===Bottom half=== ====Section 5==== ====Section 6==== ====Section 7==== ====Section 8==== ==External links== *Official Roland Garros 2007 Men's Singles Draw *Qualifying Draw *2007 French Open \u2013 Men's draws and results at the International Tennis Federation Men's Singles Category:French Open by year \u2013 Men's Singles Category:2007 ATP Tour ",
