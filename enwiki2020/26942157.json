Ukraine is a republic in Eastern Europe. It is bordered by the Russian Federation to the east; Belarus to the north; Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; Romania and Moldova to the southwest; and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south. After decades of Soviet occupation, Ukraine re-established its independence in 1991. The city of Kyiv is both the capital and the largest city of Ukraine. == Zemstvo stamps == Around 800 Russian Zemstvo stamps were issued in Ukraine between 1866 and 1917 at 39 locations. The first stamps were issued at Verkhnodniprovsk, Katerynoslav Guberniya, and in Dniprovsk, Tauridia Gubernia - both of which are now located in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. == Ukrainian People's Republic == In 1918 an independent Ukrainian People's Republic was established and a series of five definitive stamps were issued. They were printed imperforate on thin paper and then on thicker paper with perforations. The 10 and 20-shah stamps were designed by the artist Anton Sereda and the 30, 40, and 50-shah stamps by Heorhiy Narbut, a master graphic artist and president of the Ukrainian Academy of Arts in Kyiv. This 1918 issue of shahs was designed by graphic artists Anton Sereda and Heorhiy Narbut. == Trident series == In 1918 Russian stamps were overprinted with a trident for use in Kyiv, Odessa, Yekaterinoslav, Kharkiv, Poltava, Podolia, and Kherson. There are hundreds of different stamps with many varieties of overprint. The stamps have been widely forged. == West Ukrainian National Republic == In 1918 and 1919 Eastern Galicia had internal autonomy as the West Ukrainian National Republic.

After liberation, Soviet stamps were used once again. == Independent Ukraine == On July 16, 1990 the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine. Kyiv artist Alexander Ivachnenko received from the Ministry of Communications of the USSR order for a stamp dedicated to the event. He offered some sketches that were discussed in the Ministry of Communications of the USSR and the Supreme Council of the Republic. On one of the first choices a girl symbolizing Ukraine, was dressed in a shirt, tunic and barefoot. She suggested, \"shod\" in boots and red skirt instead of \"put\" Plahty. In the wreath a blue ribbon was added, causing the blue background of the brand changed to gold. The inscription on the stamp was \"Mail of the USSR\", but in the preparation of drawings for the press, it was changed to the traditional - \"Mail of the USSR\". This postal stamp went into circulation on 10 July 1991. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ukraine declared its independence and the first stamps of the new republic were issued on 1 March 1992.Stanley Gibbons Stamp Catalogue Part 10 Russia. 6th edition.

Other Soviet stamps overprinted with similar designs are not believed to have been postally valid. Since 1992, a variety of commemorative and definitive stamps have been issued. === Ukrainian crisis === In 2014, the Republic of Crimea was declared and subsequently annexed by Russia.
