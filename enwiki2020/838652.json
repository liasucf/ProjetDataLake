    "text": "Jules Louis Dupr\u00e9 (April 5, 1811 \u2013 October 6, 1889) was a French painter, one of the chief members of the Barbizon school of landscape painters. If Corot stands for the lyric and Rousseau for the epic aspect of the poetry of nature, Dupr\u00e9 is the exponent of its tragic and dramatic aspects.Chisholm, Hugh, ed. (1911). Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (11th ed.). Cambridge University Press. ==Biography== Dupr\u00e9 was born in Nantes. He exhibited first at the Salon in 1831, and three years later was awarded a second-class medal. In the same year he came to England, where he was impressed by the genius of Constable. From then on he learned how to express movement in nature; and the districts around Southampton and Plymouth, with their wide, unbroken expanses of water, sky and ground, gave him good opportunities for studying the tempestuous motion of storm-clouds and the movement of foliage driven by the wind. He was named an Officer of the French L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1848. His daughter Therese-Marthe- Francoise also became a painter. Dupr\u00e9's colour is sonorous and resonant. He showed preference for using dramatic sunset effects and stormy skies and seas as the subjects of his paintings. Late in life he changed his style and gained appreciably in largeness of handling and arrived at greater simplicity in his colour harmonies. Among his chief works are the Morning and Evening at the Louvre, and the early Crossing the Bridge in the Wallace Collection. ==Selected paintings== File:Jules Dupr\u00e9 - Le moulin \u00e0 vent.jpg|The Windmill (1850s) File:The Old Oak by Jules Dupr\u00e9, c1870.jpg|The Old Oak (1870) National Gallery of Art.
