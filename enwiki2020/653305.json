    "text": "Leonel Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Reyna () (born December 26, 1953) is a Dominican lawyer, academic, and was the 50th and 52nd President of the Dominican Republic from 1996 to 2000 and from 2004 to 2012. Since January 2016, he is the President of the EU\u2013LAC Foundation. Fern\u00e1ndez became the first elected president of the Dominican Republic under his political party, the Dominican Liberation Party (Partido de la Liberaci\u00f3n Dominicana, or PLD), although party founder Juan Bosch was also sworn in as president in 1963 after the first democratic elections held in roughly four decades in the country. Fern\u00e1ndez's administrations have focused much on technological and infrastructural development and macroeconomic and monetary stability. He is a native of Villa Juana, Distrito Nacional and lived for much of his childhood and early adulthood in New York City. Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez is the President of the World Federation of United Nations Associations and a member of the Inter-American Dialogue. ==Early life== Fernandez is the son of sergeant major Jos\u00e9 Antonio Fern\u00e1ndez Collado and Yolanda Reyna Romero. His family moved to New York City in the United States. They lived most of the time in the Washington Heights neighborhood, a dense neighborhood dominated by ethnic Dominicans. After he finished high school, Fernandez returned to his country and started law studies in the Universidad Autonoma de Santo Domingo. He joined the Dominican Liberation Party when it was founded in 1973 by former Dominican President Juan Bosch, leaving the Dominican Revolutionary Party (PRD) to do so. Fern\u00e1ndez was known as a close pupil of Bosch. He accompanied him as a vice- presidential candidate in the 1994 presidential election. ==First presidential term (1996-2000)== Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez in 1996 The 1994 presidential election results, which resulted in a reelection of President Joaqu\u00edn Balaguer, were widely opposed by runner-up opposition leader Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez and his party. In the meantime, the international community rose their concerns on the tightening of the political tensions and fear the country was on the verge of a civil uprising. Upon an official agreement widely known as \"Pact for Democracy\" (\"Pacto por la Democracia\" in Spanish) a special election was scheduled for May 1996 and President Balaguer acceded to not run in this election as part of the arranged treaty.Morgan, Jana and Espinal, Rosario (2006) Cultura pol\u00edtica de la democracia en la Rep\u00fablica Dominicana. p. 3. PRSC opted to present Vice-President Jacinto Peynado as their candidate,Grull\u00f3n, Sandino (2006) Historia electoral dominicana : siglo XX 1900-2004\\. Imp. Servicios Gr\u00e1ficos Tito. . however PRSC supporters feared he wasn't properly endorsed by their historical leader, therefore creating a vast independent mass of electors. In the first-round election on 16 May 1996 Fern\u00e1ndez received 38.9% of the votes in the first round achieving second place behind Jos\u00e9 Francisco Pe\u00f1a G\u00f3mez and PRD. Peynado obtained 15% of the votes, the lowest outcome in Balaguer's party history which initiated a long- term downfall. After 2010 Presidential election, PRSC lost briefly its official recognition as a majority party, but regained it after an alliance with PLD was announced by Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez for 2010 mid-term elections, in where both parties achieved 100% of Senate positions and obtained over 2/3 of the seats on the Chamber of Deputies. In the run-off election, held on 30 June 1996, the \"Patriotic Front\" integrated, and Fern\u00e1ndez thus secured 51.2% of the votes to win the election. He was sworn in as President on 16 August 1996, succeeding Balaguer. During his term in office, Fern\u00e1ndez's political agenda was one of economic and critical reform. He helped enhance Dominican participation in hemispheric forums, such as the Organization of American States and the Summit of the Americas. The Dominican economy enjoyed an average growth rate of seven percent, the highest in Latin America for that period, and was among the highest in the world along with South Korea's and the People's Republic of China's. Inflation was stabilized in the low single digits, also among the lowest of Latin America. Fern\u00e1ndez also began a visionary plan to run the Dominican Republic. When developers proposed the country's first modern port during his first term, he said that \"We could be the Singapore of the Caribbean\".Stier, Ken (16 April 2006) Tropical Paradox, Time In Santo Domingo and Santiago, which comprised 40% of the country's population, he favored \"mega-projects\", building numerous highways and tunnels which improved transit across the greater extent of these cities and created OMSA (Metropolitan Office of Autobus Services in English). His administration also gave incentives for foreign direct investment. In 2000, Fern\u00e1ndez was unable to run for a consecutive term as the 1994 constitution prohibited it. His party held primaries to elect a presidential nominee, which were won by Danilo Medina with 52% of the votes against Vice-President Jaime David Fern\u00e1ndez Mirabal. Medina, who was sworn as the PLD candidate for the 2000 presidential election, was defeated by the PRD candidate, Hip\u00f3lito Mej\u00eda. Mejia did not satisfy the 50% rule to avoid a feared run-off election, but Medina, who placed second, recognized Mejia's win immediately. ==Second presidential term (2004-2008)== George W. Bush welcomes Fernandez to the White House Fern\u00e1ndez was elected to a second term of office in the presidential election held on 16 May 2004 with an absolute majority and the second highest percentage ever in Dominican history of 57%. He was sworn in on 16 August 2004. His victory was due in large part to the collapse of the Dominican economy. This collapse has been attributed to skyrocketing oil prices and a slumping international economy post-9/11, excessive borrowing under the Mej\u00eda administration and the failure of three banks in the country: Banco Intercontinental (Baninter), Bancr\u00e9dito and Banco Mercantil. In an effort to avoid further economic chaos, the Mej\u00eda administration effectively underwrote all three banks, repaying their customers but generating even greater public debt. Some of the bankers involved have been or are on trial, yet the extent of their fraud is hard to measure as their widespread largess with officials within both the Fern\u00e1ndez and Mej\u00eda administrations has made it nearly impossible to achieve a true accounting of what conditions led to the bank's demise. According to local sociologist Jos\u00e9 Oviedo, \"The country trusts him with the economy, but he doesn't seem to pay that much attention to social issues.\" The economic prosperity which his government prided itself on seemed to fail in reaching enough people. According to The Wall Street Journal,Mary Anastasia O'Grady (25 November 2012) The Dominican Republic's Taxing Turn, The Wall Street Journal the economy situation worsened during his last term. Fern\u00e1ndez received World Peace Culture Award on 6 April 2008. ==Third presidential term (2008-2012)== Barack and Michelle Obama during a reception at the Metropolitan Museum in New York with Fern\u00e1ndez and Margarita Cede\u00f1o de Fern\u00e1ndez During the Mej\u00eda administration, the constitution was changed to again allow the immediate re-election of presidents. Although Mej\u00eda was ultimately unsuccessful in his bid for re-election, this opened the door for Fern\u00e1ndez to attempt a similar run. On 7 May 2007, despite great controversy over whether the PLD party should support the concept of re-election, Fern\u00e1ndez won the PLD primary election with a 72% voting percentage against his former Chief of Staff and confidant, Danilo Medina. As a result, Fern\u00e1ndez became the official PLD candidate for the presidency in the May 2008 General Election. Fern\u00e1ndez was declared the victor of the 2008 election, defeating six others, including the PRD candidate and former president Mej\u00eda's right- hand man, Miguel Vargas, and the PRSC's candidate, Amable Aristy. Fern\u00e1ndez defeated Vargas 53% to 41%. Vargas accepted the defeat the same day, 16 May. Fern\u00e1ndez was sworn in for his third term on 16 August 2008, with the traditional ceremony at the National Congress.\"Dominican president sworn in for third term\", Xinhua (People's Daily Online), 17 August 2008. An ongoing international economic which occurred during this time did not prevent the Dominican Republic from remaining the fastest growing economy in Latin America, with a growth rate of 3.5 percent in 2009 and a projected growth rate of 6.5 to 7 percent in 2010.https://www.as-coa.org/articles/president-leonel- fern%C3%A1ndez-dominican-republics-economic-position == Civil Society Engagement == In 2000, Leonel Fernandez founded the Fundaci\u00f3n Global Democracia y Desarrollo (FUNGLODE), headquartered in Santo Domingo, as a think tank as well as a resource and training center.

On 20 October 2018, the 42nd Plenary Assembly of the World Federation of United Nations Associations (WFUNA) unanimously elected him president of the global body for a 3-year renewable term thus succeeding to South Korea's senior Ambassador Park Soo-gil and former International Atomic Energy Agency Director General, Hans Blix.
