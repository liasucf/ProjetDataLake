    "text": "\"Englishman in New York\" is a song by English artist Sting, from his second studio album ...Nothing Like the Sun, released in October 1987. Branford Marsalis played soprano saxophone on the track, while the drums were played by Manu Katch\u00e9 and the percussion by Mino Cin\u00e9lu. The single was released in February 1988 as the third single from the album, but only reached #51 on the UK Singles Chart. In the US, \"Englishman in New York\" peaked at #84 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in April 1988 and reached #32 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart that same month. However, the single was more successful in continental Europe, becoming a hit in several countries, reaching the Top 40 (and sometimes the Top 20) in France, Netherlands, Spain, Belgium, etc. \"Englishman in New York\" was also a Top 20 hit in Ireland. In South Africa, it peaked at no. 9. In 1990, just prior to the release of his third studio album The Soul Cages, Sting's record label licensed Dutch DJ and producer Ben Liebrand to remix \"Englishman in New York\" and subsequently released it as a single. The remix played around with the introduction and some of the instrumentation, but the essence of the song remained the same. The new version was commercially successful, reaching number 15 in the UK charts in mid-1990. In 2010, Sting re-recorded the song in an orchestral version for his album Symphonicities. ==Content== Sting wrote the song about the famous eccentric and gay icon Quentin Crisp, who is the \"Englishman\" of the title. The song was composed not long after Crisp had moved from London to an apartment in the Bowery in Manhattan. Sting had met him and Crisp remarked jokingly to the musician \"that he looked forward to receiving his naturalisation papers so that I can commit a crime and not be deported.\" ==Music video== The video was shot in black-and-white and was directed by David Fincher, and featured scenes of Sting and his band in New York, as well as the elusive Quentin Crisp. At the end of the video, after the song fades, an elderly male voice says: \"If I have an ambition other than a desire to be a chronic invalid, it would be to meet everybody in the world before I die... and I'm not doing badly.\" In 2011, the official video was replaced with a version without the male voice. ==Track listing== * 12\" Single (AMY 431) #\"Englishman in New York\" \u2013 4:25 #\"Ghost in the Strand\" \u2013 2:33 #\"Bring on the Night\"/\"When the World Is Running Down\" (Live) \u2013 11:42 * 7\" Single (AM 1200) #\"Englishman in New York\" \u2013 4:25 #\"If You There\" \u2013 4:08 * CD Maxi Single (75021 2370 2) #\"Englishman in New York\" \u2013 4:03 #\"Someone to Watch Over Me\" \u2013 4:35 #\"Up from the Skies\" \u2013 10:07 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1988) !Peak position |- |- |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM)Canadian Top Singles RPM |align=\"center\"|60 |- |Ireland (IRMA) |align=\"center\"|12 |- |- |Spain (AFYVE) |align=\"center\"|21 |- |United Kingdom (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|51 |- |U.S. Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|84 |- |U.S. Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks |align=\"center\"|32 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1990 remix) !Peak position |- |United Kingdom (The Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|15 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" border=\"1\" !Chart (2019) !Peak position |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1863 |} ==Certifications== == Covers == *In 1993, the song was partially remade by Shinehead, re-titled as \"Jamaican In New York\" (1993).
