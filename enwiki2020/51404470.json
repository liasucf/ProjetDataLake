    "text": "Following is a table of United States presidential elections in Maine, ordered by year. Since its admission to statehood in 1820, Maine has participated in every U.S. presidential election. Prior to 1820, much of the territory currently comprising the state of Maine was part of the state of Massachusetts, and citizens residing in that area have thus been able to participate in every U.S. election. In 1972, Maine passed legislation to split its Electoral votes between its two congressional districts. Winners of the state are in bold. ==Elections from 1864 to present== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- ! Year ! Winner (nationally) ! Votes ! Percent ! Loser (nationally) ! Votes ! Percent !

The election was the only one in history to be decided by the House of Representatives under the provisions of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution after no candidate secured a majority of the electoral vote. It was also the only presidential election in which the candidate who received a plurality of electoral votes (Andrew Jackson) did not become President, a source of great bitterness for Jackson and his supporters, who proclaimed the election of Adams a corrupt bargain. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
