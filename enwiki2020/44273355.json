Metin Alt\u0131ok studied philosophy at Ankara University. After graduating he went on working first as a civil servant and subsequently as a teacher. He held teaching posts in various Anatolian cities, and taught for several years at the religious \u0130mam Hatip school in the city of Bing\u00f6l. Alt\u0131ok published his first collection of poems, Gezgin (\"Gadding about\"), in 1976, which was followed two years later by Yerle\u015fik yabanc\u0131 (\"Settled stranger\") and eight additional collections until 1992. His works were awarded several literary prizes. In addition to his literary achievements, he engaged in drawing with pen and charcoal. On 2 July 1993 he was killed while attending a cultural festival in the central Turkish city of Sivas, when a group of radical Salafists set fire to the hotel in which the festival was held. In 2003, the prominent Turkish composer Faz\u0131l Say devoted an oratorio (Requiem for Metin Alt\u0131ok) to Alt\u0131ok, who was a friend of Say. ==Bibliography== * 1976: Gezgin * 1978: Yerle\u015fik yabanc\u0131 * 1981: K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck tragedyalar * 1987: \u0130pek ve klabtan * 1990: D\u00f6rtl\u00fckler ve desenler * 1991: S\u00fcveyda * 1992: Alaturka \u015fiirleri * 1992: \u015eiirin ilk atlas\u0131 * 1993: Hesap i\u015fi \u015fiirler * 1998: Bir ac\u0131ya kirac\u0131 ==Literary awards== * 1979: Ahmet Telli Poetry Prize * 1990: Cemal S\u00fcreya Poetry Prize Category:1941 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Turkish male poets Category:Turkish writers Category:Ankara University alumni Category:20th-century Turkish poets Category:20th-century male writers ",
