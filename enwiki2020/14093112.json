    "text": "Caught in a Free State was a dramatised television series made by RT\u00c9 in 1983. This four-part series was about German spies in neutral Ireland during World War II, known in Ireland as \"The Emergency\". ==Production== The series was written by Brian Lynch, with music by Se\u00f3irse Bodley and directed by Peter Ormrod. The series was the winner of the best drama award at the Banff World Television Festival in Canada and also won a Jacob's Award in Ireland. Parts of the dialogue were recorded in German with English subtitles, partly in the hope of a sale of the series to a German television station. ==Principal actors== *Goetz Burger as \"Gunther Schultz\" (based on G\u00fcnther Sch\u00fctz of Abwehr) *Peter Jankowsky as Hermann G\u00f6rtz (chief spy of Abwehr in Ireland) *John Kavanagh as \"Colonel Brian Dillon\" (based on Colonel Dan Bryan of the G2 section of the Irish Army) *Barry McGovern as \u00c9amon de Valera (Taoiseach) *Niall T\u00f3ib\u00edn as Stephen Hayes (Irish Republican Army) *O. Z. Whitehead as David Gray (US Ambassador to Ireland) ==Episodes== The spies are frequently depicted as out of touch with the realities of Irish life. They are also often depicted as individuals highly unsuited for espionage. At times, the absurdities take on a comic dimension - such as in the arrest of Henry Obed, an Indian working for Abwehr. It is notable that the German plans for Operation Green (the intended invasion of Ireland) also included a considerable amount of outdated information. Whilst dramatised (and some names have been changed, notably that of Sch\u00fctz to \"Schultz\") the plots in Caught in a Free State are based on actual events and persons. The anachronistic reference to \"Free State\" is deliberate as the Irish Free State had been superseded by the new Constitution of Ireland of 1937, which is a recurring theme. Both G\u00fcnther Sch\u00fctz and Dan Bryan were still alive during the filming (in 1983), hence the change of names. *Episode 1: Hermann G\u00f6rtz is parachuted into Ireland. He tries to return to Germany by boat but is intercepted by the Irish Navy and interned. *Episode 2: Ernst Weber-Drohl, a 60-year-old former circus strongman, is landed by submarine on the coast of County Wexford. *Episode 3: \"Gunter Schultz\" is arrested, interrogated and threatened with execution for spying. *Episode 4: The end of the War. Herman G\u00f6rtz commits suicide rather than face deportation. ==Transmission== It was also broadcast in the United Kingdom on Channel 4 in April 1984, and was repeated in July 1986. ==See also== *History of the Republic of Ireland *Irish neutrality *Irish neutrality during World War II *IRA/Abwehr collaboration in World War II *Plan Kathleen *Operation Green *Oskar Metzke ==References== ==External links== *Brian Lynch (writer) * *RT\u00c9 Category:1983 Irish television series debuts Category:1983 Irish television series endings Category:Independent Ireland in World War II Category:Irish drama television series Category:RT\u00c9 original programming Category:World War II espionage Category:World War II television drama series Category:Cultural depictions of \u00c9amon de Valera Category:Television series set in 1940 ",
