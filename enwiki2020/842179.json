    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Maria Ferreira de Castro (May 24, 1898 in Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is - June 29, 1974 in Oporto) was a Portuguese writer and journalist. ==Life== Elder son of Jos\u00e9 Eust\u00e1quio Ferreira de Castro and Maria Rosa Soares de Castro. At 8 years old, he was orphaned by a father, a poor peasant and decides, at 12 years old, to emigrate with the intention of supporting his family. On January 7, 1911, he embarked on the \"Jer\u00f4me\" steam ship bound for Bel\u00e9m do Par\u00e1, Brazil [1]. There he would publish his first criminal novel by ambition, in 1916. Later, for four years, he lived in the rubber plantation of Para\u00edso, in the middle of the Amazon rainforest, along the bank of the Madeira River. After leaving the rubber tree Para\u00edso, he lived in precarious conditions, having to resort to jobs such as pasting posters, boarding boats on Amazonian ships, etc. Later, in Portugal, he was editor of the newspaper O S\u00e9culo, director of the newspaper O Diabo and contributor to the magazines O domingo ilustrado [2] (1925-1927), Renova\u00e7\u00e3o (1925-1926) [3] and Ilustration [4] (started in 1926). In the service of the Pereira da Rosa newspaper, he signed vibrant chronicles, such as the day he was arrested in Limoeiro to witness the lives of prisoners in Portuguese prisons or his exclusive interview in Dublin with Eamon de Valera, leader of Sinn Fein in 1930. [5 ] In 1930, he published The Selva, the work that would make him an international writer, including a Nobel Prize candidate. The book receives positive reviews in The New York Times and paves the way in Hollywood and allows him to join the French Pen Club. At that time, he tragically lost his wife, Diana de Liz, to whom he dedicated the book. After the death of his wife, Ferreira de Castro left for England by boat, in the company of the writer Assis Esperan\u00e7a. He is sick, with septicemia, but is treated by the doctor and art historian Reynaldo dos Santos. As a result of the state of mourning, in December 1931, Ferreira de Castro attempted suicide to no avail. For convalescence, he left for Madeira, where he wrote the novel Eternidade (1933), whose theme is the obsession with death [6]. He was also famous for his travel literature, namely his book A Volta ao Mundo, recounting his travels around the world in the outset of World War II. He is buried in Sintra, due to his expressed will [7]. ==References== ==External links== * Centro de Estudos Ferreira de Castro * / Ferreira de Castro * Category:Portuguese male novelists Category:Portuguese journalists Category:1898 births Category:1974 deaths Category:People from Oliveira de Azem\u00e9is Category:Portuguese anti-fascists Category:20th-century journalists ",
