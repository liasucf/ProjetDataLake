Smith) and Thomas Kelly, descendants of Irish Quakers. She had a sister, Marguerite Kelly.https://www.geni.com/people/Marguerite-Kelly- King/6000000014504893511 In August 1916, she married wealthy lumber dealer Harvey Hevenor. \"H.H. Hevenor, lumber dealer, first saw Dorothy Kelly on the screen.\" In 1922, she gave birth to twin daughters, Ann and Bessie, who later became a portrait painter. \"Bess was born in New York City August 19, 1922 to silent screen actress Dorothy Kelly and Harvey Hevenor.\" She died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1966. == Career == After attending the National Academy of Design and earning a position in a publishing firm, Kelly decided to give up her career as an illustrator.\"Dorothy's Change of Art\" Cosmopolitan Magazine, May 1917. \"Dorothy Kelly effected a quick change of art when she gave up her work as an illustrator to become a photo-play actress.\" Seeking more lucrative work, she decided to become a performer and, despite having no previous acting experience, applied for a position in the stock company at Vitagraph, \"She went to the Vitagraph studio at Flatbush and made application for a position in a stock company. The first question fired at her was: 'Have you had any experience?' 'I have not.' replied Dorothy Kelly.\" signing a contract in the early teens. Her first film was a bit part in a 30-minute version of A Tale of Two Cities in 1911, which also featured future silent stars Norma Talmadge and Mabel Normand. She continued to make 70 films with Vitagraph and during these years she played opposite almost all of the Vitagraph comedians, including John Bunny and his successor Hughie Mack, as well as child star Bobby Connelly.
