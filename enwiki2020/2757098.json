    "text": "Pereskiopsis (from Greek -opsis, \"looking\", because of its resemblance with the genus Pereskia) is a genus of cacti (family Cactaceae). Peireskiopsis Vaupel is an orthographic variant. ==Description== The shape of Pereskiopsis is not that of a typical cactus, since it has large green leaves and grows like a bush. Only the presence of areoles, usually with spines and glochids, and the flowers, allow it to be identified as a cactus. Flowers open during the day. Pereskiopsis is often used as a grafting stock for other cacti, as it promotes quick growth of the scion. Its small diameter makes it an excellent grafting stock for small seedlings, but many species will outgrow the stock and need to be re-grafted or rooted. Pereskiopsis are tropical cactus and can not withstand any frost. Maintain a temperature of approximately 12 \u00b0C during winter and be careful with water. The stem tends to rot very easily, especially with low temperatures when the plant is not actively growing. ==References== #Anderson and Brown. Cactus Family.
