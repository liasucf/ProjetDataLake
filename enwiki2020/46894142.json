The league is sanctioned by the United States Adult Soccer Association, an affiliate of the United States Soccer Federation. ==History== Founded in 1953 as the Minnesota Soccer Association, the Minnesota Amateur Soccer League (MASL) is the oldest soccer association in Minnesota. The state\u2019s only sanctioned competitive soccer league for men changed its name to MASL in 1987 when the Minnesota Soccer Association (MSA) became Minnesota\u2019s umbrella organization for adult soccer. In addition to MASL, Minnesota Soccer Association now includes the American Premier League (APL), Duluth Amateur Soccer League (DASL), Minnesota Recreational Soccer League (MRSL), Southern Minnesota Amateur Soccer Association (SMASA), Minnesota Senior Soccer League (MSSL) and the Minnesota Women\u2019s Soccer League (MWSL). The MSA, which began with four teams, spent its first 15 years as the only governing soccer body in Minnesota that was affiliated with the U.S. Soccer Federation. In 1968, a new youth soccer association, the Minnesota Junior Soccer Association, joined the MSA. MASL has 41 teams and remains the premier amateur soccer league in the state. This prevalence is due in part to the strong reputation around the state and country as well as the vast number of MSA Hall of Fame members that continue to support the league. ==Teams== ===Division 1=== * Cardinals * Cougars * FC Minnesota * Fire SC * Force FC * Haaka * SPAM FC * Stegman\u2019s 1977 * Vlora City FC * WB Burn ===Division 2=== * Dukes *Dynamo FC St. Cloud * Scorpion Strikers *FC Shango * Kelix * Lewis Dragons * Lions FC * Maple Bums * Wolverines FC * VSLT FC ===Division 3=== * Camargo FC * Force FC 19 *FC Minnesota B * Inferno Rebels *Northrop United *River City FC * Stegman's Athletic *Stegman's Old Boys *Vlora City FC II *Waconia FC ===Division 4=== * Alchemy * Alloy BC * Dynamo FC \u201818 * Lino FC * Mediocre Strikers * SPAM FC 09 * Turbo Sports FC * V-Hawks * Wolfpack ==Champions== {| style=\"width:100%; margin:0\" !
