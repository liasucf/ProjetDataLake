    "text": "The Syrian wild ass (Equus hemionus hemippus), less commonly known as a hemippe, an achdari,or a Mesopotamian or Syrian onager, is an extinct subspecies of onager native to the Arabian peninsula and surrounding areas. It ranged across present-day Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Iran, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Turkey. ==Description== The Syrian wild ass, only one metre high at its shoulder, was the smallest equine, and could not be domesticated. Its coloring changed with the seasons \u2014 a tawny olive coat for the summer months, and pale sandy yellow for the winter. It was known, like other onagers, to be untameable, and was compared to a thoroughbred horse for its beauty and strength. ==Distribution and habitat== The Syrian wild ass lived in deserts, semi-deserts, arid grasslands and mountain steppes. Native to West Asia, they were found in Israel, Palestine, Jordan, Iran, Turkey, Syria, Saudi Arabia and Iraq. ==Ecology and behavior== ===Diet=== The Syrian wild ass was a grazer. It fed on grass, herbs, leaves, shrubs and tree branches. ===Predation=== Syrian wild asses were preyed upon by Asiatic lions, Arabian leopards, striped hyenas, Syrian brown bears, Arabian wolves and Caspian tigers. Asiatic cheetahs may have also preyed on foals. ==History== European travelers in the Middle East during the 15th and 16th centuries reported seeing large herds. However, its numbers began to drop precipitously during the 18th and 19th centuries due to overhunting, and its existence was further imperiled by the regional upheaval of World War I. The last known wild specimen was fatally shot in 1927 at al Ghams near the Azraq oasis in Jordan, and the last captive specimen died the same year at the Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn, in Vienna. == Restoration == After the extinction of the Syrian wild ass, the Persian onager from Iran was chosen as the appropriate subspecies to replace the extinct onagers in the Middle East. The Persian onager was then introduced to the protected areas of Saudi Arabia and Jordan. It was also reintroduced, along with the Turkmenian kulan, to Israel, where they both reproduce wild ass hybrids in the Negev Mountains and the Yotvata Hai-Bar Nature Reserve. == Cultural references == * It is believed this may be the \"wild ass\" which Ishmael was prophesied to be in Genesis in the Old Testament. References also appear in the Old Testament books of Job, Psalms, Jeremiah and the Deuterocanonical book of Sirach. * The Qur\u2019an, the main book of Islam, in Surat al-Muddaththir, refers to a scene of humur (, 'asses' or 'donkeys') fleeing from a qaswarah (, 'lion'). This was to criticize people who were averse to Muhammad's teachings, such as supporting the welfare of the less wealthy. ==Related subspecies== * Mongolian wild ass (khulan), Equus hemionus hemionus * Turkmenian kulan (kulan), Equus hemionus kulan * Indian wild ass (khur), Equus hemionus khur * Persian onager (gur), Equus hemionus onager ==References== Category:1927 in the environment Category:Equus (genus) Category:Extinct mammals Category:Extinct mammals of Asia Category:Mammal extinctions since 1500 Category:Mammals described in 1855 Category:Species endangered by warfare Category:Species made extinct by human activities ",
