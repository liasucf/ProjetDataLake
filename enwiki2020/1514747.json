    "text": "The N Broadway Express is a rapid transit service in the B Division of the New York City Subway. Its route emblem, or \"bullet\", is colored , since it uses the BMT Broadway Line in Manhattan. The N operates at all times between Ditmars Boulevard in Astoria, Queens, and Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue in Coney Island, Brooklyn via the BMT Astoria Line in Queens, Broadway Line in Manhattan, the south side of the Manhattan Bridge, and the BMT Fourth Avenue Line and BMT Sea Beach Line in Brooklyn. North of 57th Street, limited rush hour service operates via the Second Avenue Subway, originating and terminating at 96th Street in the Upper East Side, Manhattan, instead of Ditmars Boulevard. During the daytime on weekdays, the N runs express between 34th Street\u2013Herald Square in Manhattan and 59th Street in Brooklyn and local elsewhere. Local service in Manhattan is provided by the W, which is internally staffed and scheduled as part of the N. Weekend daytime service is the same as weekday service, except that the N makes all stops in Manhattan between 34th and Canal Streets. During late nights, the N makes all stops along its entire route and uses the Montague Street Tunnel to travel between Manhattan and Brooklyn. The N was originally the Brooklyn\u2013Manhattan Transit Corporation's 4 service, running along the BMT Sea Beach Line to the Manhattan Bridge. The 4 used the BMT Nassau Street Line in Lower Manhattan from 1915 to 1917, after which it ran express on the BMT Broadway Line. The 4 became the N in 1961. The N ran local in Queens along the IND Queens Boulevard Line to Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue from 1976 until 1987, when it switched terminals with the R. From 1986 to 2004, reconstruction on the Manhattan Bridge forced the N to run local on the Broadway Line via the Montague Street Tunnel. == Service history == {| style=\"width:90px;\" 90px |- | Original designation for the Sea Beach Line |} ===Before 1970=== 90px 1967-1979 bullet {| style=\"width:90px;\" 90px |- | A NX service used in 1967-68 |} The route that is now the N was originally BMT service 4, known as the Sea Beach Line or Sea Beach Express. On June 22, 1915, the current BMT Sea Beach Line opened, replacing a street level \"el\" that branched off of the Fifth Avenue El with the former BMT West End Line. Originally, it used the south tracks of the Manhattan Bridge, which at that time connected to the BMT Nassau Street Line. On September 4, 1917, the first part of the BMT Broadway Line and the north side tracks of the Manhattan Bridge opened. Trains ran from 14th Street\u2013Union Square to Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue, now using the bridge's northern tracks. On January 15, 1918, service was extended to Times Square\u201342nd Street. On May 2, 1957, service was extended north via the express tracks to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue. In 1959, trains began stopping at DeKalb Avenue during midday hours. Previously, they bypassed DeKalb Avenue at all times except late nights. Beginning on January 1, 1961, trains bypassed DeKalb Avenue during rush hours only. In addition, on weekday evenings, late nights, and all day Sundays, they ran local on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. The N designation began to appear when R27 subway cars were moved to the service in April 1961. Poster advertising a new NX service Poster advertising the NX service's discontinuation The NX designation was used for a rush hour peak- direction \"super-express\" service along the express tracks of the Sea Beach Line, beginning at Brighton Beach on the BMT Brighton Line, running through Coney Island, and then following the N route to 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue. This short-lived service began on November 27, 1967 (when the Chrystie Street Connection opened)service notice, effective November 27, 1967 and ended April 12, 1968 due to low ridership. Starting on Monday, April 15, 1968, the five NX trips instead ran as N trips.service notice, effective April 15, 1968 ===1970\u20131980=== On August 30, 1976, weekday N service was extended north over the BMT 60th Street Tunnel Connection to Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue to replace the discontinued EE. While many N trains ran the full route from Coney Island to 71st Avenue, via the Manhattan Bridge and Broadway Express, some trains ran local during the rush hours only between Whitehall Street\u2013South Ferry in Lower Manhattan and Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue, which had been the former EE route. On August 27, 1977, N service was cut back during late nights, only operating between 36th Street and Coney Island. ===1980\u20131990=== Reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge between 1986 and 2004 disrupted N service, usually rerouting it via the Montague Street Tunnel. On April 26, 1986, the north side tracks (leading to the IND Sixth Avenue Line) were closed and services that normally ran on them were moved to the south side, running via the BMT Broadway Line. Because of the large amount of train traffic now running on those tracks, rush hour and midday N service was rerouted via the Montague Street Tunnel, making local stops in Manhattan (at all times) and Brooklyn, though evening, night and weekend trains continued to use the bridge and express tracks in Brooklyn. The , which was rerouted from the BMT Brighton Line to the BMT West End Line, replaced the N as the weekday express on the Fourth Avenue Line. As part of the New York City Transit Authority's proposed service plan to serve the new Archer Avenue Line upper level, the N would have been extended to Jamaica Center during weekdays. When N trains terminated at 71st Avenue or 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue during weekends and evenings, G trains would have been extended to Jamaica Center, and during late nights a G train shuttle would have run between Jamaica Center and Van Wyck Boulevard. This service plan would have allowed E and F trains to remain on the Queens Boulevard mainline toward 179th Street. The final service plan, which took effect on December 11, 1988, had the extension served by E trains, with R trains extended to 179th Street. On May 24, 1987, the N swapped northern terminals with the . The N was switched to Astoria\u2013Ditmars Boulevard, while the went to Forest Hills\u201371st Avenue. This was done to give the direct access to Jamaica Yard; previously, the had direct access to both Jamaica Yard and Coney Island Yard, and the R, running from Bay Ridge to Astoria, lacked direct access to either yard. This change was intended to improve the appearance and reliability of service on the R, since all trains on the Astoria and Broadway Lines were part of the graffiti-free program. When the north side of the Manhattan Bridge reopened and the south side was closed on December 11, 1988, the N began running local in Manhattan and via the Montague Tunnel at all times; In order to replace B service to Ditmars Boulevard, additional N service was provided during rush hours. Trains continued to run express in Brooklyn between Pacific Street and 59th Street/Fourth Avenue evenings and weekends. The Transit Authority and politicians pressured the New York State Department of Transportation to resume N train service on the bridge's south side on September 30, 1990, despite warnings from engineers that the structure was unsafe and major repairs still had to be made. Trains ran express on Broadway in Manhattan (stopping at 49th Street) and Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn at all times except late nights. On December 27, state inspectors forced N service to be rerouted via the Montague Street Tunnel again after discovery of corroded support beams and missing steel plates, running local on its entire route at all times. ===1990\u20132000=== R68s at 39th Avenue R68As at 36th Avenue R160s approaching 30th Avenue On May 31, 1994, the N began running express in Brooklyn between Pacific Street and 59th Street/Fourth Avenue during weekday midday and rush hours, with the M running local during those times. From 1994 to May 22, 1995, the southern terminal of the N was 86th Street due to rehabilitation work at Coney Island\u2013Stillwell Avenue. On November 4, 2001, it was cut back again as the terminal's reconstruction project continued. From April 30, 1995 to November 12, 1995, the north side of the Manhattan Bridge was closed during weekday midday and weekends for structural repairs. Midday N service ran local in Brooklyn, replacing the M, which was cut back from 9th Avenue to Chambers Street. The N continued to run express during rush hours. ===2001\u20132010=== After the September 11, 2001 attacks, Broadway Line service through Lower Manhattan was suspended; N service was also suspended and replaced by the in Manhattan and Queens and the in Brooklyn. On October 28, N service was restored, but Cortlandt Street remained closed until September 15, 2002. On September 8, 2002, because of the ongoing reconstruction of Coney Island terminal, weekend and late night N service was reduced to a shuttle between 86th and Pacific Streets, running express on the BMT Fourth Avenue Line. In its place, the was extended to Manhattan and Astoria, Queens at all times; this was because the W was the only route still serving Stillwell Avenue during this part of the reconstruction. On February 22, 2004, the Manhattan Bridge work was finally completed. The N returned to its full route in Manhattan and Queens at all times, and returned to using the Manhattan Bridge at all times except nights (via Fourth Avenue express, bypassing DeKalb Avenue). On weekdays, N trains ran express between 34th Street in Manhattan and 59th Street/Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn via the Manhattan Bridge, and local elsewhere; several trains ran express on the entire Broadway Line and short- turned at 57th Street\u2013Seventh Avenue or Times Square during the AM rush hour. On weekends, it makes local stops in Manhattan, but express in Brooklyn, using the bridge. During late nights, it runs local along its entire route via the Montague Street Tunnel, replacing the train. On May 29, 2005, the new Stillwell Avenue terminal was completed, and N service between 86th Street and Coney Island was restored. On June 28, 2010, the N began running local in Manhattan north of Canal Street at all times, replacing the on weekdays which was discontinued due to budget problems, effectively adopting the weekend service pattern. However, the handful of short-turn N trains continued to run express in Manhattan. ===2011\u2013present=== From August 2, 2013 to September 14, 2014, the Montague Street Tunnel was closed for Hurricane Sandy-related repairs. During this time, overnight N service was rerouted via the Manhattan Bridge, skipping six stations it normally served. On November 7, 2016, the MTA restored the BMT Broadway Line services to their 2004-2010 service pattern in preparation for the rerouting of the train to the Second Avenue Subway. As a result, the N train once again became a weekday express between 34th Street\u2013Herald Square and Canal Street, with local service replaced by the restored W train.* * The MTA approved the service change on May 23, 2016. All short-turn N trains that originally terminated at 57th Street-Seventh Avenue were extended to 96th Street-Second Avenue on January 3, 2017 following the opening of the Second Avenue Subway. In January 2017, the MTA revealed plans to rehabilitate the tunnel structure above the BMT Fourth Avenue Line's express tracks between 36th Street and 59th Street. As a result, from July 30, 2018 to July 29, 2019, N trains ran local along that section at all times. Between October 21, 2019 and May 4, 2020, N trains terminated at 86th Street so work could be completed to protect Coney Island Yard from flooding. An out- of-system transfer was available between the N at 86th Street and the F at Avenue X station. Afterward, between May and September 2020, the N will make local stops on Fourth Avenue on weekends to provide a transfer to the F at Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street, since the F will be suspended south of Church Avenue due to construction on the IND Culver Line. == Route == === Service pattern === The following table shows the lines used by the N, with shaded boxes indicating the route at the specified times: {| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"width:auto;
