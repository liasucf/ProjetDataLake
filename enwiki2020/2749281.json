    "text": "NGC 3132 (also known as the Eight-Burst Nebula, the Southern Ring Nebula, or Caldwell 74) is a bright and extensively studied planetary nebula in the constellation Vela. Its distance from Earth is estimated at about 613 pc. or 2,000 light-years. ==Planetary nebula nucleus (PNN)== Images of NGC 3132 reveal two stars close together within the nebulosity, one of 10th magnitude, the other 16th. The central planetary nebula nucleus (PNN) or white dwarf central star is the fainter of these two stars. This hot central star of about 100,000 K has now blown off its layers and is making the nebula fluoresce brightly from the emission of its intense ultraviolet radiation. ==See also== *List of NGC objects *List of planetary nebulae == References == ==External links== * Hubble Heritage release \u2013 A Glowing Pool of Light * Hubble Heritage Project \u2013 Image of NGC 3132 * Category:Planetary nebulae Category:Vela (constellation) 3132 074b 18350302 ",
