    "text": "Typhoon Thompson in Search for the Sea Child is a 1988 computer game created by Dan Gorlin. It was published by Broderbund for the Atari ST and later for Amiga (1990). Typhoon Thompson is a remake of the Apple II game from Broderbund called Airheart, also written by Gorlin. ==History== Airheart is a particularly notable title for the Apple II as it is the best example of the rarely used 16-color \"Double High Res\" graphics mode available in the enhanced Apple //e and Apple //c (and, later, Apple IIGS) in an arcade-style game. The backstory presented to the user as well as the in-game mechanics are almost identical between the two titles. While Typhoon Thompson is controlled with the mouse, Airheart is controlled with the analog joystick. ==Reception== The game was ranked the 24th best game of all time by Amiga Power.Amiga Power magazine issue 0, Future Publishing, May 1991 ==References== ==External links== *Typhoon Thompson at Atari Mania *Typhoon Thompson at Lemon Amiga *STart Vol.3 No.6 review of Typhoon Thompson (Atari ST).
