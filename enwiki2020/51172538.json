    "text": "Will Parks (born July 29, 1994) is an American football safety for the Philadelphia Eagles of the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Denver Broncos in the sixth round of the 2016 NFL Draft. He played college football at the University of Arizona. ==Professional career== The Denver Broncos selected Parks in the sixth round (219th overall) of the 2016 NFL Draft. He was the 17th safety selected in 2016 and the second safety drafted by the Broncos, after third-round draft pick Justin Simmons. ===Denver Broncos=== ====2016==== On May 13, 2016, the Denver Broncos signed Parks to a four-year, $2.44 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $100,356. Throughout training camp, Parks competed with veteran Shiloh Keo for the backup strong safety role. Head coach Gary Kubiak named Parks the backup strong safety behind T. J. Ward to start the regular season. He made his professional regular season debut in the Denver Broncos' season-opening 21-20 victory over the Carolina Panthers. In Week 3, he made two solo tackles, two pass deflections, and had his first career interception off a pass by Andy Dalton during a 29-17 victory at the Cincinnati Bengals. On November 13, 2016, Parks recovered a blocked field goal during the New Orleans Saints' extra point and returned it for the game-winning two point score after teammate Justin Simmons leaped over the offensive line and blocked Wil Lutz's attempt to defeat the Saints 25\u201323 in the final 1:30 seconds. The play was challenged by the Saints after it appeared Parks may have stepped out of bounds during the return, but the ruling was upheld after it was determined there was not enough conclusive evidence showing Parks had stepped out of bounds. Parks finished his rookie season with 22 combined tackles (17 solo), four pass deflections, a fumble recovery, one interception, and a touchdown in 16 games and zero starts while appearing on special teams and as a reserve safety on defense. The Denver Broncos finished third in the season AFC West with a 9-7 record and head coach Gary Kubiak retired due to health concerns. ====2017==== The Denver Broncos hired Vance Joseph as their new head coach and Joe Woods as their new defensive coordinator, replacing Wade Phillips. Parks was named the backup free safety behind Darian Stewart to begin the regular season. On October 30, 2017, Parks earned his first career start and recorded two solo tackles during a 29-19 loss at the Kansas City Chiefs. In Week 15, he started at strong safety after Simmons had been placed on injured reserve with a high ankle sprain. Parks went on to make a season-high seven combined tackles in their 25-13 win at the Indianapolis Colts. The following week, he collected two combined tackles, defended a pass, and intercepted a pass attempt by Kirk Cousins in the Bronco's 27-11 loss at the Washington Redskins. Parks finished the 2017 season with 51 combined tackles (36 solo), four pass deflections, and an interception in 16 games and four starts. He started three games at strong safety and appeared on special teams and as an extra defensive back during dime packages. In their first season under head coach Vance Joseph, the Denver Broncos finished last in their division with a 5-11 record. ===Philadelphia Eagles=== On March 24, 2020, Parks signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles. He was placed on injured reserve on September 6, 2020. He was activated on October 17. ==Personal life== On June 2, 2017, Parks was arrested for misdemeanor harassment and non-physical domestic violence charges involving a former girlfriend. ==References== ==External links== *Official Website of Will Parks *Arizona Wildcats bio *Denver Broncos bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from Pennsylvania Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:American football safeties Category:Arizona Wildcats football players Category:Denver Broncos players Category:Philadelphia Eagles players ",
