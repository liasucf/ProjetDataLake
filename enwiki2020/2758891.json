O'Faolain's formative years coincided with the emergence of the women's movement, and her ability to expose misogyny in all its forms was formidable, forensic and unremitting.

Unlike most commentators, who maintain a detached, lofty tone, O'Faolain, placed herself at the centre of things, a high-risk strategy that worked because of her broad range of erudition, worn lightly, her courage and a truthfulness that sometimes bordered on the self-destructive. ==Awards== * 1985: Jacob's Award as producer of RT\u00c9 television programme Plain Tales *Journalist of the year * 2006: Prix Femina \u00e9tranger, The Story of Chicago May\"2006 Prix Femina winners announced \". literaryawards.vertebratesilence.com, 31 October 2006.
