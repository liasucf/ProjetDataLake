    "text": "Sean Bowie, best known by the recording alias Yves Tumor, is an American producer of experimental electronic music, born in Miami, Florida and currently based in Turin, Italy. ==Life and career== Raised in Knoxville, Tennessee, Tumor started making music at age 16 as an outlet away from \"dull, conservative surroundings.\" They were self taught in learning how to play drums, bass, guitar, and keyboards. Describing their experience growing up in Tennessee as unpleasant, Yves moved at age 20 to San Diego, and after college to Los Angeles, and met Mykki Blanco in 2012, they later toured for two and a half years throughout Europe and Asia. Yves Tumor\u2019s pronouns are they/them. In the early 2010s, Tumor recorded as Teams, and made music which AllMusic described as \"post-chillwave\". The artist debuted the Yves Tumor project in 2015 with an EP for Berlin's experimental club label Janus, and another one for Blanco's label, Dogfood MG. That same year, the artist released the first album, When Man Fails You (which would later be re-released by Apothecary Compositions on April 29, 2016). In September 2016, Tumor signed with PAN Records and released its label debut, Serpent Music. Yves had worked on the album for three years after moving to Leipzig, Germany. The album was recorded between Miami, Leipzig, Los Angeles and Berlin. In Pitchforks review of the album, critic Andy Beta compared Tumor's musical style to James Ferraro and Dean Blunt, and noted their use of \"unsettling percussive loops and field recordings to create a mood as if lost in a strange urban landscape\". In September 2017, Tumor released a compilation album titled Experiencing the Deposit of Faith for free. Later that week, it was revealed through a tour announcement that Tumor had signed to Warp Records. Following the announcement, the artist embarked on a tour with a new audiovisual show. In September 2018, Tumor released the Warp debut, Safe in the Hands of Love, with no prior announcement. It was preceded by the singles \"Noid\" on July 24, \"Licking an Orchid\" featuring James K on August 29, and \"Lifetime\" on September 3. The album received universal acclaim from music critics. Pitchforks Jayson Greene stated in the review that the album \"dwarfs everything the artist has released by several orders of magnitude. The leap is so audacious it's disorienting.\" Tumor's fourth album, Heaven to a Tortured Mind, was released on April 3, 2020, preceded on March 3 by the single \"Kerosene\" featuring Diana Gordon. Alexis Petridis, reviewing the album for The Guardian, awarded it Album of the Week, describing it as \"extraordinary: experimental, capable of any genre, with an internal logic powering its shifts in mood. Tumor uses both gender-neutral pronouns and masculine pronouns. Tumor believes his gender or sexuality should not define his art, and is quoted as saying \"I really like to drop hints in the way I express myself, instead of making my gender or my sexuality or my feelings about equality my personal brand. That\u2019s not why I do what I do.\" ==Musical style== Tumor has cited Throbbing Gristle as a major influence, saying: \"There's something about their music, like the hypnotic trance vibes, that really influenced me.\" ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| When Man Fails You | * Released: July 2, 2015 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download, cassette |- ! scope=\"row\"| Serpent Music | * Released: September 22, 2016 * Label: PAN * Format: LP, digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| Safe in the Hands of Love | * Released: September 5, 2018 * Label: Warp * Format: LP, CD, digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| Heaven to a Tortured Mind | * Released: April 3, 2020 * Label: Warp * Format: LP, CD, digital download |} ===Compilation albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Experiencing the Deposit of Faith | * Released: September 13, 2017 * Label: Self-released * Format: Digital download |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Noid\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2018 | rowspan=\"3\"| Safe in the Hands of Love |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Licking an Orchid\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Lifetime\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Gospel for a New Century\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2020 | rowspan=\"3\"| Heaven to a Tortured Mind |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Kerosene!\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Romanticist\" / \"Dream Palette\" |- |} ===Guest appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:8em;\"| Artist ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Histrionic I\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2015 | rowspan=\"4\"| Mykki Blanco | rowspan=\"4\"| Mykki Blanco Presents C-ORE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Childish\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Histrionic II\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Histrionic III / Skunk of the Earth\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Reanimator\" | 2020 | Joji | Nectar |} ===Remixes=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Artist ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Zure\" | 2017 | Ryuichi Sakamoto | Async Remodels |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"The Altar\" | 2018 | Alice Glass | Alice Glass (Remixes) |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Yves Tumor on Warp Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Ambient musicians Category:American electronic musicians Category:American experimental musicians Category:21st- century American musicians Category:Musicians from Knoxville, Tennessee Category:Warp (record label) artists Category:American expatriates in Italy Category:African-American musicians Category:African-American singers Category:Non-binary musicians Category:LGBT African Americans Category:LGBT musicians from the United States ",
