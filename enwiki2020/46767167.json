The music video for the song was released on YouTube the following day. It was serviced to US contemporary hit radio on April 11, 2016 as the album's fifth official single. The song peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100. ==Composition== \"Ride\" is an uptempo alternative rap song that lasts for a duration of three minutes and thirty-four seconds. The track combines elements of rock, hip-hop, reggae, punk, and pop. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music, it written in the time signature of common time, with a fast tempo of 150 beats per minute. \"Ride\" is composed in the key of G-flat major, while Tyler Joseph's vocal range spans five notes, from a low of D4 to a high of B5. The song has a basic sequence of G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013C/D during the introduction, changes to G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013Dsus2 in the sung verse, has G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013C during the pre-chorus, follows G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013Dsus2 at the refrain, changes to G\u2013Am\u2013Em\u2013C\u2013G\u2013Am\u2013 Em\u2013C/D in the rap verse and follows G\u2013Am\u2013D\u2013Em\u2013Am7(add4)\u2013Em\u2013D\u2013D/F during the bridge as its chord progression. The song has a mix of infectious aspects built on a rich reggae influence infused with rock sounds. The musical composition is drenched deeply in Caribbean- tinged riffs and shimmery synths. Dun's drumming provides the upbeat track with rhythmic dexterity, playing in a punk-inspired fashion. Joseph recites contemplative rhymes over electropop-oriented reggae beats. His vocal parts demonstrate a crisp delivery, one that abruptly goes from balladry to rapping to screaming. After singing an opening verse, Joseph delivers his lyrics in a hard, staccato style of fast-paced rapping. The song's chorus has him elongating its syllables and shouting his lines: \"Oh, I'm falling, so I'm taking my time on my ride.\" During the bridge, Joseph engages in call-and- response patterns. The track's instrumental also takes dub-inspired deviations. Its musical arrangement closes with a piano-driven conclusion. The lyrical content of \"Ride\" is home to idioms. Despite its upbeat atmosphere, the song harbors melancholic rumination concerning the human condition. Joseph's lyrics address millennial angst while discussing relatable life struggles. While he tries to relax and feel confident about his accomplishments, Joseph's mind digresses on who or what he'd die for and what is truly important in life. At one point, he proclaims, \"Yeah I think about the end just way too much/But it\u2019s fun to fantasize.\" He sings lyrics with a hint of darkness that have him confessing, \"I've been thinking too much/help me.\" ==Critical reception== Billboards Gab Ginsberg called the single \"irresistible.\" Erik Leijon of Montreal Gazette described \"Ride\" as \"impossibly catchy faux-reggae.\" Jason Pettigrew from Alternative Press claimed it \"might be the most happiest song in TOP's songbook, and there's still an ominous message.\" Mitchell Hillman for Phoenix New Times remarked that the song \"is pushed even further into a blissful realm by [Joseph]'s supersonic rapping.\" Chelsea Deeley from Music Feeds praised the vocal parts Tyler Joseph contributed to the song, writing that it \"showcases a succinct vocal delivery that can go from rapping to balladry to screaming in a heartbeat and flourish with complete satisfaction to the ears.\" Kerrangs Sam Law described \"Ride\" by saying, \"Ostensibly the most upbeat track in the twenty one pilots back-catalogue ... Wearing its rich reggae influence on its (short) sleeve, luxuriating in a deep well of Caribbean-kissed riffage and shimmering synth-work, it introduced newcomers to another infectious facet of their sound.\" Anne Nickoloff and Troy Smith for The Plain Dealer considered the single \"a hodgepodge of everything the band does best.\" Conversely, George Palathingal for The Sydney Morning Herald claimed, \"'Ride, meanwhile, proves an equal-opportunity offender to fans of dub, hip-hop and rock.\" Likewise, Philip Cosores from Consequence of Sound questioned, \"Is this the future of rock? A little hip-hop, a little dub, a little aggravating, and a lotta catchy?\" He concludes, \"'Ride' represents the worst-case scenario for Twenty One Pilots \u2014 a musical cornucopia that lacks for good taste.\" == Commercial performance == The song peaked at number five on the Billboard Hot 100, number one on the Hot Rock Songs, Mainstream Top 40, and Alternative Songs charts, number four on the Adult Top 40 chart and number five on the Hot Dance Airplay chart.

It is the duo's third highest ranking single to date, behind \"Stressed Out\" and \"Heathens\". \"Ride\" has also reached the top 20 in various other countries, including Australia, Canada, Slovakia and France.
