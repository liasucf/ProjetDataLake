    "text": "Giltbrook is a village in England situated approximately northwest of Nottingham and within close reach of junction 26 of the M1 motorway. It is part of Greasley (Giltbrook and Newthorpe) ward, which had a population of 6,076 in 2001, increasing to 6,233 at the 2011 Census. The name Giltbrook is believed to come from the old English name \"Gylden Broc\", which means golden stream, or brook. This relates to the brook that runs from the fields to the north of IKEA, and then continues under Nottingham Road at Giltbrook, and under the IKEA entrance, finally flowing into the River Erewash. Notable events include Giltbrook being the end point of the Pentrich rising where a small force of soldiers: twenty men of the 15th Regiment of Light Dragoons ended the rising. Some streets have been named after the ring leaders, with names such as Brandreth, Turner and Ludlam being used. The village is home to the Giltbrook Retail Park which has been developed due to the presence and popularity of IKEA, Decathlon and a Next store. In 2009\u201310 a whole retail park was built on the land next to IKEA, including Pets at home, Laura Ashley, Comet, BHS, Boots, and Carpet Right. Comet and BHS have now ceased trading, with Comet being replaced by TK Maxx.
