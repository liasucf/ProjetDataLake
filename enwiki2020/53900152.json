It was established in 1972 as a single award, and is now the highest honour in the Western Australia Tourism Awards. The awards were established in 1972, by John Wood, founder of the Fleetwood caravan company. He said later: Speaking in parliament in 2013 John Day commented that David Brand's widow Lady Brand, then aged 92, had at that time attended all but one of the 41 presentation ceremonies for the award. ==Winners== *2016: ADAMS Coachlines *2015: Sandalford Wines *2014: Broome's Cable Beach Club Resort & Spa *2013: Kings Park and Botanic Garden *2012: Challenger Institute of Technology, School of Hospitality & Tourism *2011 Eco Beach Broome *1994 Feature Tours *1992 Esplanade Hotel, Albany *1984 York Motor Museum *1983: Atlantis Marine Park (closed 1990) *1978: Elizabethan Village ==References== Category:Tourism in Western Australia ",
