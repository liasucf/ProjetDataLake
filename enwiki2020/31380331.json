The club was founded in 1961 as Athlitikos Omilos Rouvas, and mostly played friendly matches due to lack of a home ground. In 1968, the Greek military junta of 1967\u20131974 shut down the club as \"inactive\", as a result of it not being registered in any regional league of the Heraklion Football Clubs Association. The club remained inactive throughout 1974\u22121985, occasionally playing friendly matches only. In 1985, the club was re-established and participated for the first time in the Heraklion FCA Championship. The club has since been competing at regional level, with a short break during 1992\u221294. During the 2008\u221209 season, Rouvas was crowned Heraklion FCA Champion and was promoted to the Delta Ethniki, the fourth tier of the Greek football league system for the first time in their history.
