Outside rowing, he was a partner in a furniture making business, Beresford & Hicks. Beresford initially sculled at Kensington Rowing Club in Hammersmith with some success, winning many trophies although failing in attempts at the Wingfield Sculls in 1902 and 1903Wingfield Sculls Record of Races and in the London Cup at the Metropolitan Regatta. By 1904 he had decided that he had reached his limits as a single sculler and moved to Thames Rowing Club in order to row seriously in crew boats. He remained a member of Thames for the rest of his life. In 1909 and 1911, he was in the crew that won the Stewards Challenge Cup at Henley Royal Regatta. Also in the 1911 regatta, he partnered Arthur Cloutte to win the Silver Goblets & Nickalls' Challenge Cup.Henley Royal Regatta Results of Final Races 1839\u20131939 In a heat of this event he and Cloutte dead heated against Bruce Logan and Charles Rought to set a course record which lasted until 1934.Henley Royal Regatta When they prayed for rain 29 June 2009 Rought and Logan joined Beresford who was the bowman, in the Thames Rowing Club coxed four which won the silver medal for Great Britain rowing at the 1912 Summer Olympics. Beresford served as captain of Thames Rowing Club in 1914 and again in 1926. In 1922 he was appointed as Vice President of the club. He was a dedicated coach with strong opinions. Despite holding similar views on techniques, Beresford clashed with Steve Fairbairn and a dispute between the two was an underlying cause of Fairbairn's move from Thames to London Rowing Club in 1927. As a coach at Thames, Beresford's greatest successes came in 1927 when Thames won four events at Henley Royal Regatta and in 1928 when the club repeated the feat. Beresford's son Jack Beresford was also a rower and won medals at five successive Olympics. His grandson Michael Beresford also became an Olympic rower. ==Achievements== ===Olympic Games=== * 1912 \u2013 Silver, Coxed Four ===Henley Royal Regatta=== * 1909 \u2013 Stewards' Challenge Cup * 1911 \u2013 Stewards' Challenge Cup * 1911 \u2013 Silver Goblets & Nickalls' Challenge Cup * 1919 Victory Regatta \u2013 Fawley Cup ==References== Category:1868 births Category:1959 deaths Category:English male rowers Category:Olympic rowers of Great Britain Category:Rowers at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic silver medallists for Great Britain Category:Olympic medalists in rowing Category:Medalists at the 1912 Summer Olympics Category:English people of Polish descent ",
