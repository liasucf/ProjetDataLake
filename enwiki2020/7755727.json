    "text": "Torbj\u00f6rn, Thorbj\u00f6rn, Torbj\u00f8rn, or Thorbj\u00f8rn (given name) are modern Swedish, Norwegian and Danish forms of the Old Norse and Icelandic name \u00deorbj\u00f6rn, meaning thunder (from the name Thor) and bear. Other variants of the name include the Danish/German form Torben and the predominantly German form Thorben. English variants include Thurburn, Thorburn, Thorbern, Thorebern, Thorber, and Thurber, which are, however, normally used as surnames. Tubby is common in the Norfolk area of England and the early whaling communities of North America. The Icelandic short form is \"Tobbi\"; the Swedish is \"Tobbe.\" The supposed site of \u00deorbj\u00f6rn's farm in Hrafnkels saga was known as \"Tobbah\u00f3l\" by the locals. == Notable people named Torbj\u00f6rn == * Torbj\u00f8rn Agdestein (born 1991), Norwegian footballer * Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen (born 1989), Danish Professional golfer * Torbj\u00f6rn Arvidsson (born 1968), Swedish football player * Torbj\u00f6rn Axelman (born 1932), Swedish TV producer, director and writer * Thorbj\u00f8rn Egner (1912\u20131990), Norwegian children's author * Torbj\u00f8rn Bergerud (born 1994), Norwegian handball player * Torbj\u00f6rn Blomdahl (born 1962), Swedish billiards player * Torbj\u00f6rn Blomqvist (1941\u20132017), Finnish sprint canoer * Torbj\u00f8rn Brundtland (born 1975), band member of the Norwegian electronic music duo, R\u00f6yksopp * Torbj\u00f6rn Caspersson (1910\u20131997), Swedish cytologist and geneticist * Torbj\u00f8rn Clausen (1931\u20132001), Norwegian boxer * Torbj\u00f6rn Ek (1949\u20132010), Swedish bandy- and soccer player * Torbj\u00f6rn Eriksson (born 1971), Swedish athlete * Torbj\u00f6rn Evrell (1920\u20132008), Swedish inventor and businessman * Thorbj\u00f6rn F\u00e4lldin (1926\u20132016), Swedish politician * Torbj\u00f6rn Flygt (born 1964), Swedish novelist * Torbj\u00f8rn Gaarder (1885\u20131970), Norwegian chemist * Torbj\u00f8rn Hansen (born 1972), Norwegian politician * Thorbj\u00f8rn Harr (born 1974), Norwegian actor * Thorbj\u00f8rn Jagland (born 1950), Norwegian politician from Norwegian Labour Party * Torbj\u00f6rn Johansson (born 1970), Swedish middle-distance runner * Torbj\u00f6rn Jonsson (born 1936), Swedish footballer * Torbj\u00f8rn Kjerrg\u00e5rd (born 1983), Norwegian football defender * Torbj\u00f8rn Kristoffersen (1892\u20131986), Norwegian gymnast * Torbj\u00f6rn \"Ebbot\" Lundberg (born 1966), Swedish artist, songwriter and music producer * Torbj\u00f8rn L\u00f8kken (born 1963), Norwegian nordic combined skier * Torbj\u00f6rn Martin (born 1981), Swedish film and music video director * Torbj\u00f6rn Nilsson (born 1954), soccer player * Thorbj\u00f8rn Olesen (born 1989), Danish golfer * Torbj\u00f6rn \"Pugh\" Rogefelt (born 1947), Swedish singer, musician, guitarist and songwriter * Thorbj\u00f8rn Schierup (born 1990), Danish Olympic sailor * Torbj\u00f8rn Sunde (born 1954), Norwegian jazz musician * Torbj\u00f8rn Sindballe (born 1976), Danish triathlete * Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00e4nnsj\u00f6 (born 1946), Swedish philosopher * Torbj\u00f6rn Thoresson (born 1959), Swedish sprint canoer * Torbj\u00f8rn Urfjell (born 1977), Norwegian politician for the Socialist Left Party * Torbj\u00f8rn Yggeseth (1934\u20132010), Norwegian ski jumper * Torbj\u00f6rn Zetterberg (born 1976), Swedish jazz musician and composer == Fictional characters == * Torbj\u00f6rn (Overwatch), a character from the 2016 video game ==Mountain== * \u00deorbj\u00f6rn (mountain) near Grindav\u00edk, Reykjanes, Iceland ==References== Category:Scandinavian masculine given names Category:Danish masculine given names Category:Norwegian masculine given names Category:Swedish masculine given names ",
