    "text": "MBS International Airport , located in Freeland, Michigan, is a commercial and general aviation airport serving the nearby cities of Midland, Bay City, and Saginaw. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017\u20132021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility. MBS was formerly named Tri- City Airport or Freeland Tri-City Airport. The airport was renamed MBS International Airport in 1994 (representative of its IATA airport code) to prevent confusion with other airports named \"Tri-City Airport\" across the United States. While owned by three municipalities, the IATA and FAA city name associated with the airport is Saginaw, i.e. the control tower is known to pilots as \"Saginaw Tower\". The commercial airport is a special municipal body owned by Bay County and the cities of Midland and Saginaw. The airport's name is an initialism formed from the names of these three communities and it is governed by a nine-member commission made up of three members from each of them. In October 2012, MBS opened a brand new $55 million new 6-gate terminal to replace the old 3 gate terminal which was built in 1965. The construction on this project was completed nearly a year ahead of schedule. The old terminal, which sat empty since Oct 2012, was demolished in 2017. MBS International Airport enjoyed a robust 2018 with passenger numbers up 13 percent, and the airport is poised to embark on a major rehabilitation of its main runway to ring in the New Year. ==Facilities== MBS International Airport covers and has two runways: * Runway 5/23: , Surface: Asphalt * Runway 14/32: , Surface: Asphalt For the 12-month period ending December 31, 2017, the airport had 20,358 aircraft operations, an average of 77 per day. In December 2017, there were 23 aircraft based at this airport: 5 single-engine, 7 multi- engine, 11 jet and 1 helicopter. ==History== Current Terminal boarding concourse During World War II, it was used to hold prisoners of war. Civilian control of the airport resumed in the mid-1940s. The current terminal on the north side of the air field opened on October 31, 2012. The terminal, which replaced an older terminal on the west side of the air field, was designed by RS&H; and cost $55 million.Lynch-Morin, Kathryn. By the numbers: New MBS International Airport passenger terminal, The Saginaw News via MLive, October 26, 2012 The Airport Commission approved plans for the construction of the state-of-the-art passenger terminal in 2006, with construction beginning in 2008. Airport officials hope the terminal will bring more airlines and more competition to MBS.Stanton, Ryan J. Plans reach high with federal funds , The Bay City Times via MLive, December 26, 2007 Air Force One landed at the airport two times during the 2004 United States Election for nearby rallies in support of George W. Bush. It landed once again on September 10, 2020 for a campaign speech by Donald Trump, and was attended by over 10,000 people, twice what was expected, plus thousands that were not able to get in https://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw-bay-city/2020/09/trump-michigan-rally- crowd-nearly-twice-what-was-expected-up-to-10000-airport-manager-says.html.

Air Force Two also made an appearance in 1992 when Vice President Dan Quayle spoke from a hangar the day before the 1992 Presidential Election https://www.latimes.com/archives/la- xpm-1992-11-03-mn-1267-story.html. ===Former airline service=== Ticketing Area of the former terminal The 1980s and 1990s saw a lot of growth at MBS. During this time, airline service expanded and many airlines began serving MBS. * Air Canada (Operated by Air Ontario) served MBS with its only International destination, Toronto, Ontario, Canada. * Allegiant Airlines served MBS in the early 2010s with weekly MD-80 service to Orlando-Sanford, but the route was dropped a few months later when Allegiant announced they would operate from Flint. * American Eagle Airlines operated Shorts 360 turboprop aircraft to Chicago O'Hare, as well as Lansing, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, and Traverse City. American left MBS in the late 1980s. * Chicago Express Airlines, the now-defunct ATA Airlines carrier, served MBS in the early 1990s with daily service to Chicago Midway Airport using the Jetstream 31 turboprop aircraft. * Delta Connection carrier Comair briefly linked MBS with Cincinnati, Ohio using Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, a 30-seat turboprop. Comair left MBS and started service in Flint. Delta returned to MBS in 2010 after their merger with Northwest Airlines. * Continental Airlines provided mainline service in the 1980s to Cleveland, Ohio using McDonnell Douglas DC-9 and Boeing 737 aircraft. Mainline service was downgraded to Continental Express service in the late 1980s using Beechcraft 1900 turboprop aircraft. Service to Flint and Chicago Midway also existed in 1992. The airline left MBS in the mid-1990s and returned in 2002. Service was dropped to Cleveland again in 2003. *Northwest Airlines was a major player at MBS during the late 1980s until their merger with Delta in 2008. In their 20+ years at MBS, Northwest served Detroit & Minneapolis with a fleet of McDonnell Douglas DC-9 series aircraft along with the Boeing 727 and Airbus 319 & 320\\. Northwest Airlink linked MBS to Flint, Lansing and Alpena throughout the 1980s with turboprop aircraft and eventually supported mainline Northwest with CRJ service to Detroit, Minneapolis and in 2008, operated a once daily nonstop to New York's LaGuardia airport in New York City using a CRJ-200 regional jet. * Republic Airlines began service to MBS in the 1960s linking MBS with Detroit using the DC-9 aircraft.

Republic merged with Northwest Airlines in the 1980s, who subsequently merged with Delta Air Lines in 2010. Delta still serves MBS today. * Skyway Airlines (The Midwest Express Connection) served MBS in the 1990s with service to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, using the Beechcraft 1900 turboprop aircraft.

Mainline service ended soon after, and US Airways Express assumed the Pittsburgh flights using the Beech 1900 and Saab 340 aircraft. US Airways suspended service to MBS just two days after entering Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in late 2002. At the time it was the only city for US Airways to drop. Eventually, US Airways also left Flint, Lansing, Kalamazoo, and Grand Rapids, leaving Detroit as the only Michigan destination served by US Airways. ==Current operations== SkyWest Airlines runs ground services for United Express.
