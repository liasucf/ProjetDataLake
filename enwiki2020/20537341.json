    "text": "Heartland Cafe The Heartland Cafe was a restaurant in the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago. Originally opened in 1976 by two activists as the \"Sweet Home Chicago Heartland Caf\u00e9,\" it became a cultural icon for the diverse neighborhood, known as much for its hippie ambience and left-leaning politics as for its largely (but not exclusively) vegetarian food. ==Political center== Part of a complex of buildings that also contained a theatre studio, an adjoining music venue, and a newsstand and general store within the restaurant itself, the restaurant was routinely referred to as an \"institution\" and a social and political center of the neighborhood. Politicians ranging from local candidates to Barack Obama held rallies and events at the Heartland creating a long history of political activism and served as a civic forum for Rogers Park and Chicago. A radio show, Live from the Heartland, hosted in-part by the cafe's original founders, Katy Hogan and Michael James, was broadcast live every Saturday on WLUW (88.7FM) from the dining room while customers ate. ==Sale== Heartland Cafe's last owner was Tom Rosenfeld, an organic farmer who also operated Earth First Farms in southwest Michigan. Under Rosenfeld's ownership, Heartland was home to a full service natural food grocery store, sit down restaurant and live music venue. ==Demise== Plans to sell the building and close the business were announced and the restaurant closed on December 31, 2018. The owners hope to reopen in a new location in the future. A demolition permit for the building was issued on April 15, 2019 and demolition began within a week. == External links == *Official website == References == Category:Restaurants in Chicago Category:Restaurants established in 1976 Category:1976 establishments in Illinois ",
