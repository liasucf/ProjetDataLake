    "text": "Shushanik (, ), born Vardeni Mamikonian (c. 440 \u2013 475) was a Christian Armenian woman who was tortured to death by her husband Varsken in the town of Tsurtavi, Georgia. Since she died defending her right to profess Christianity, she is regarded as a martyr. Her martyrdom is described in her confessor Jacob\u2019s hagiographic work, the oldest extant work of Georgian language literature. The hagiography details extensive resistance to forms of imprisonment, isolation, torture and cruelty by Shushanik. Shushanik was a daughter of the Armenian military commander Vardan Mamikonian and married the Mihranid ruler (pitiakhsh) Varsken, son of Arshusha II. Varsken was a defiant vassal of Vakhtang I Gorgasali, King of Kartli (Iberia), and took a pro- Persian position, renouncing Christianity and adopting Zoroastrianism. He killed his spouse after she refused to submit to his order to abandon her Christian faith. Varsken himself was put to death by King Vakhtang in 483. Shushanik has been canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church and is venerated by the Armenian Apostolic Church. Her feast day is celebrated on October 17 in Georgia and Tuesday between September 20\u201326 in Armenia. == External links == *Martyrdom of Shushanik Category:440s births Category:475 deaths Category:Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church Category:Saints of Georgia (country) Category:Late Ancient Christian female saints Category:5th-century Christian saints Category:5th-century Christian martyrs Category:Mamikonian family Category:5th-century women Category:Christians in the Sasanian Empire Category:People executed by the Sasanian Empire Category:Women of the Sasanian Empire Category:People of the Sasanian Empire of Armenian descent ",
