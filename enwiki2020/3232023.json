    "text": "Phellandrenes are a pair of organic compounds that have a similar molecular structure and similar chemical properties. \u03b1-Phellandrene and \u03b2-phellandrene are cyclic monoterpenes and are double-bond isomers. In \u03b1-phellandrene, both double bonds are endocyclic and in \u03b2-phellandrene, one of them is exocyclic. Both are insoluble in water, but miscible with ether. \u03b1-Phellandrene was named after Eucalyptus phellandra, now called Eucalyptus radiata, from which it can be isolated.Jacobs, S.W.L., Pickard, J., Plants of New South Wales, 1981, . It is also a constituent of the essential oil of Eucalyptus dives.Boland, D.J., Brophy, J.J., and A.P.N. House, Eucalyptus Leaf Oils, 1991, . \u03b2-Phellandrene has been isolated from the oil of water fennel and Canada balsam oil. The phellandrenes are used in fragrances because of their pleasing aromas. The odor of \u03b2-phellandrene has been described as peppery-minty and slightly citrusy. The \u03b1-phellandrene isomer can form hazardous and explosive peroxides on contact with air at elevated temperatures. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of phellandrene begins with dimethylallyl pyrophosphate and isopentenyl pyrophosphate condensing in an SN1 reaction to form geranyl pyrophosphate. The resultant monoterpene undergoes cyclization to form a menthyl cationic species. A hydride shift then forms an allylic carbocation. Finally, an elimination reaction occurs at one of two positions, yielding either \u03b1-phellandrene or \u03b2-phellandrene. 660x600px ==References== Category:Hydrocarbons Category:Perfume ingredients Category:Monoterpenes Category:Cyclohexenes Category:Cyclohexadienes Category:Conjugated dienes ",
