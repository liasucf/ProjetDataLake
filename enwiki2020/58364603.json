    "text": "Argyris Kampetsis (; born 6 May 1999), also known as Anargyros Kampetsis, is a Greek professional footballer who plays as a striker for Panathinaikos. ==Club career== Kampetsis started playing as a 5 year old for Aris Petroupolis and within 2 years, he was unearthed by AEK Athens legend Toni Savevski at a tournament in the Athens suburb of Pallini. After playing for AEK Athens Academies he moved to Olympiacos Academies where Kampetsis\u2019 career really took off and went to the next level. His dominance, goal scoring record and all- round game at youth level could not be ignored, and as a result, he became a regular fixture in the youth teams of the Greek national football team setup. He attracted interest from top clubs from England, Germany and Italy but it was German giants Borussia Dortmund who made him the best offer. One that Olympiakos could not match as his playing time would not be guaranteed by then manager Paulo Bento. He plays mainly as a forward, and joined Panathinaikos from the ranks of Borussia Dortmund II. Kampetsis made his first professional appearance for the team in the 2018\u201319 Super League game against Lamia on September 1, 2018. On 23 September 2018, he scored his first goal with the club in a 3\u20130 home win game against Levadiakos. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! rowspan=2 | Club ! rowspan=2 | Season ! colspan=3 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Other ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
