Most of the land was reclaimed from Hang Hau Village and Shui Bin Village (). == History == The earliest history referring to Hang Hau was in the 19th century. It was an agricultural and fishing village. Hang Hau got its name from a large water channel near Mang Kung Uk () that led to the sea. In days gone by, Hang Hau was on the sea front, facing Junk Bay. Many of the village names in Hang Hau reflect this \u2013 Shui Bin Village () means Waterside Village, for example. On 2 October 1957, Hang Hau Rural Committee was established. The rural committee was to serve the indigenous inhabitants in Hang Hau Village, Shui Bin Village, Tin Ha Wan Village, Yau Yue Wan Village, Tseng Lan Shue, Tai Po Tsai, Mang Kung Uk and Po Toi O.\u5751\u53e3\u9109\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703. Retrieved on 19 July 2015 Between the 1960s and 1980s, Hang Hau was a large ship scrapyard area. Since there was a ferry from Junk Bay to Island East Hong Kong, Hong Kong Oxygen Company started building factories in Hang Hau. Manufacturing business and trading services were established. Long before the development of Tseung Kwan O New Town, Hang Hau was near settlements such as Hang Hau Village, Boon Kin Village and Tin Ha Wan Village. Most of the Villages were relocated at the current site near the Tseung Kwan O Hospital, which were moved after the new town's development. Now, about two-thirds of Hang Hau is on reclaimed land, and the sea is far away. ==Housing== Indigenous three storey village houses still can be found in the eastern edge of Hang Hau. Nowadays, Hang Hau is fully built-out with private and public estates owing to the development of Tseung Kwan O New Town. ===Villages=== Hang Hau Village * Boon Kin Village * Hang Hau Village * Shui Bin Village * Tin Ha Wan Village ===Home Ownership Scheme Estates=== * Chung Ming Court * Hin Ming Court * Wo Ming Court * Yu Ming Court * Yuk Ming Court ===Private Sector Participation Scheme (PSPS) Estates=== * Fu Ning Garden * Jolly Place * On Ning Garden ===Public Estates=== * Hau Tak Estate * Ming Tak Estate ===Private Estates=== * East Point City * Maritime Bay * Residence Oasis * La Cite Noble * Nan Fung Plaza ==Infrastructures== Hong Kong Velodrome.
