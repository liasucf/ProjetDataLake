Twenty-eight teams participated in the competition, divided in four groups. Groups A and B played with eight teams each, in a round robin, home and away format. The top team in each group qualified directly for the quarter-finals, the bottom two in each group dropped out of the competition and the remaining 10 teams qualified for the first knock-out phase. In groups C and D, six teams played in each group in a round robin format, playing both home and away. The top two teams in each group then met in a \u2018semi-final\u2019 play-off, with the two winners going through to the first knock-out phase. The remaining teams dropped out of the competition. ;Knock-out Phase 1 (Last 12) 12 teams played home and away in the first knock-out phase, with the 10 teams qualified from groups A and B and the two teams qualified from groups C and D. ;Knock-out Phase 2 (Quarterfinals) The six winners of the matches in the first knock-out phase joined with the winners of groups A and B to play home and away for the right to play in the VELUX EHF FINAL4. ;Final four The culmination of the season, the VELUX EHF FINAL4, with the four top teams from the competition competing for the title. ===Round and draw dates=== All draws held at the European Handball Federation headquarters in Vienna, Austria. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Phase !Draw date |- |Group stage |rowspan=2|26 June 2015 |- |Knockout stage |- |Final Four (Cologne) |3 May 2016 |} ==Qualification stage== There was no draw held. The four teams played a semifinal and final to determine the last participant. Matches were played on 5 and 6 September 2015. RK Banja Luka organized the tournament. ===Bracket=== All times are local (UTC+2). ===Semifinals=== \\---- ===Third place game=== ===Final=== ==Group stage== The draw for the group stage was held on 26 June 2015, 20:00 CEST, in the Vienna city centre. The 28 teams were drawn into four groups, two containing eight teams (Groups A and B) and two containing six teams (Groups C and D). The only restriction was that teams from the same national association could not face each other in the same group. Since Germany qualified three teams, the lowest seeded side (Flensburg- Handewitt) had necessarily to be drawn with one of the other two. In each group, teams played against each other in a double round-robin format, with home and away matches. The matchdays are 16\u201320 September, 23\u201327 September, 30 September\u20134 October, 7\u201311 October, 14\u201318 October, 21\u201325 October, 11\u201315 November, 18\u201322 November, 25\u201329 November and 2\u20136 December 2015. For Groups A and B, additional matchdays include 10\u201314 February, 17\u201321 February, 24\u201328 February and 2\u20136 March 2016. After completion of the group stage matches, the teams advancing to the knockout stage were determined in the following manner: *Groups A and B \u2013 the top team qualified directly for the quarter-finals, and the five teams ranked 2nd\u20136th advanced to the first knockout round. *Groups C and D \u2013 the top two teams from both groups contested a playoff to determine the last two sides joining the 10 teams from Groups A and B in the first knockout round. {| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" id=\"Tiebreakers\" |- ! Tiebreakers |- |In the group stage, teams are ranked according to points (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). After completion of the group stage, if two or more teams have scored the same number of points, the ranking will be determined as follows (article 4.3.1, section II of regulations): #Highest number of points in matches between the teams directly involved; #Superior goal difference in matches between the teams directly involved; #Highest number of goals scored in matches between the teams directly involved (or in the away match in case of a two-team tie); #Superior goal difference in all matches of the group; #Highest number of plus goals in all matches of the group; If the ranking of one of these teams is determined, the above criteria are consecutively followed until the ranking of all teams is determined. If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by EHF through drawing of lots. During the group stage, only criteria 4\u20135 apply to determine the provisional ranking of teams. |} ===Group A=== ===Group B=== ===Group C=== ===Group D=== ===Playoffs=== ==Knockout stage== The first-place team from the preliminary groups A and B advanced to the quarterfinals, while the second through sixth place teams advanced to the round 16 alongside the playoff winners. ===Round of 16=== ===Quarterfinals=== ===Final four=== Drawing the final four in May in Cologne ===Final=== ==Awards and statistics== ===Top goalscorers=== Statistics exclude qualifying rounds and play-off round. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !Rank !Player !Team !Goals |- |1 |align=left| Mikkel Hansen |align=left| Paris Saint-Germain |108 |- |2 |align=left| Momir Ili\u0107 |align=left| MVM Veszpr\u00e9m |97 |- |3 |align=left| Kiril Lazarov |align=left| Barcelona |94 |- |4 |align=left| Marko Vujin |align=left| THW Kiel |93 |- |5 |align=left| Dean Bomba\u010d |align=left| Pick Szeged |89 |- |rowspan=2|6 |align=left| Domagoj Duvnjak |align=left| THW Kiel |rowspan=2|87 |- |align=left| Micha\u0142 Jurecki |align=left| Vive Targi Kielce |- |rowspan=3|8 |align=left| Anders Eggert |align=left| Flensburg-Handewitt |rowspan=3|72 |- |align=left| Nikola Karabati\u0107 |align=left| Paris Saint-Germain |- |align=left| Barys Pukhouski |align=left| Motor Zaporozhye |} ===Awards=== The all-star team was announced by EHF on 29 May 2015. *Goalkeeper: *Right wing: *Right back: *Centre back: *Left back: *Left wing: *Pivot: ;Other awards *Best Defender: *Best Young player: *Coach: ==See also== *2015\u201316 EHF Cup *2015\u201316 EHF Challenge Cup ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:EHF Champions League seasons EHF Champions League EHF Champions League ",
