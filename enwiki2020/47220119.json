He went to the United States to study at the University of Oregon in 1989. He got back to Japan in 1991 as his mother died. Preparing to return to the United States again, he suddenly had an accident with his lower back, forcing him to stay until a full recovery, which took him six years. As the backache eased by treatment and therapy, he grew determined to become an actor, at which point he entered acting school. ==Entertainment career== Shibuya started his acting career in 1993. Determined to become globally active, he felt the need to accumulate experiences in Japan first until an opportunity occurs. Besides acting on a daily basis, Shibuya further improved his performing skill in various ways, including method acting class taught by Yoko Narahashi who would later become a prominent figure of Japanese film industry at United Performers\u2019Studio which associated with NY Actors Studio, (Method Method acting later became Shibuya's present basic style of acting) ; film acting classes at Eizoujuku, a professional film college founded by Genji Nakamura, director of over 40 films; Japanese classical dancing class from Nishikawa\u2019 Kazuma, the master of Nishikawa school; vocal training at AK MUSIC specializing in opera, chanson and pop music. Shibuya acted in a number of independent and short films, in addition to his guest appearances for various film productions, which familiarized him with their methods and styles. Meanwhile, he had also taken part in filmmaking. He would even sing his original songs while playing guitar. Shibuya sought improvement day and night. Shibuya's commercial debut was in Sadistic Song (1995), a film directed by Genji Nakamura. And in 1997 comes theatric opportunities for Shibuya. In March, he participated in Bolero, a famous ballet work. The performance was choreographed by Maurice B\u00e9jart, directed by Shiro Mizoshita of Tokyo Ballet, as one of dance ensembles presented at Tokyo culture hall. In July, he took parts in Princess Sayo, as both a character and Japanese folk dancer. In August 1997, Shibuya served as assistant director in Annie Get Your Gun, a famous Broadway musical, in Nagoya Chunichi Theater. In the next year, he had the longed opportunity to work with a famous theatric director. He passed the audition and played Capulet in Romeo and Juliet, as directed by Yukio Ninagawa. He kept at his cinematic career nonetheless. In 2001, Shibuya got a role in Agitator, a film by Takashi Miike, prolific filmmaker. He played a member of the Mafia, who would support his leader played by Naoto Takenaka. Shibuya was only able to play small bits as detective, gangster, doctor, lawyer during this period. Shibuya's first experience with computer-generated animation was in Appleseed. His playing of 4 characters was recorded and later processed into animation through \"motion capture\" technique. The film was directed by Shinji Aramaki, and was released in 2004 globally. Shibuya had made plans to start performing in China, only deterred by linguistic difficulties. After learning Mandarin in Beijing Language and Culture University for six months, he'd officially started his acting career in Chinese show business world. He starred in his first Chinese TV drama Caoyuanchunlaizao, playing an actual person on history, Shouji Kanai, in autumn 2006. In the following year, he co-led his first movie in China, Feihuduidiezhan. Directed by Li Shu, this film was the most rebroadcast program of the year, aired by the predominant movie channel in China, CCTV-6. Although still a new face to Chinese audiences, his performances were soon recognized in the industry. Shibuya had been noticed, and would have been picked for a role in his next show by the director, Li Shu, which in turn led to more opportunities to play. Shibuya is grateful for all the support his co- workers have given. In 2008, Shibuya played in Ip Man (film), a kung-fu movie by Wilson Yip, which would win the best film award of 28th Hong Kong Film Awards. Shibuya's role, Colonel Sato, a cold-blooded and crafty villain, not only gained him reputation among professionals, but also made his impression in general public. In fact, the director, Wilson, had half-jokingly warned him to stay away from movie theaters, noticing the excitement of the audience and the success of the film. Shibuya was offered an opportunity to act in his first costume TV drama, Yangguifeimishi, in 2009. Directed by You Xiaogang, starring Yin Tao, Anthony Wong, the show was set in China in the Tang dynasty. Being a foreigner, Shibuya sensed and successfully portrayed his ancient- Chinese character, fascinating thousands of viewers all over China. In 2010, Shibuya took a main role in Shenhe, Minetsugu Yoshida, an ornithologist who came to Zhalong Lake to search two lost cranes from Japan. The entire film was shot in Qiqihar, a northeastern city in China where, during the shooting of the film, would reach a temperature of -30\u02daC. Shibuya's next TV drama, Jieqiang(Borrow Gun)(cast:Zhang Jiayi), was both commercially successful and critically acclaimed. His part, Kato Keiji, an emotional and cunning antagonist, was remarked by critics as both evil and fascinating.http://news.163.com/11/0321/03/6VL1HUNP00014AED.html The program has broken the record of the highest revenue in the history of Chinese TV shows. Participating in such works as Yip Man(Ip Man) and Jieqiang, Shibuya certainly became one of the most popular Japanese actors in China. As his works being broadcast in other countries, he gained popularity all over the world. In 2011, Shibuya had a chance to play scenes with an Oscar-winner Christian Bale in The Flowers of War(directed by Zhang Yimou), it was right after the successful TV drama, Jieqiang broadcast, so they gained attention of Chinese media. TV drama Daxifa\uff08Chinese Traditional Magic\uff09http://chinesemov.com/tv/2012/Chinese-Traditional-Magic.html, released in 2012, gave Shibuya a chance to play a complex and unique character. The role of Wutengzhang, Japanese Magician who came to China to steal a secret document of Chinese traditional magic, differs greatly from the soldier roles that Shibuya was used to. As the story progresses, the character adapts various identities such as honest young man, sexy female dancer of kabuki, magician playing magic on the stage, old woman, mad middle aged man. Yet another challenge to Shibuya is to speak Mandarin fluently in all 40 episodes. Overcoming all challenges, Shibuya gained praises for his acting skill and professionalism. Shibuya once again impressed his fans by playing Ichiro Nakamura, the second male leading role in the film Hushed Roar in 2012. Ichiro was a simple-minded person suffered from hypoglycemia, whose marriage with his long-time lover was deterred for his fear of his illness being heredity. This film officially participated in Montr\u00e9al World Film Festival. The character, rich in emotions, was quite a new type for Shibuya to play, as he played numerous stereotypical, sometimes one-sided roles so far. Shibuya spoke only English in the film as required by the setting of the film. Without knowing him in person, the producer said that Shibuya's playing as a comical role gave her confidence to cast him, and that she was very satisfied with Shibuya's performance. In 2013, Shibuya participated in KANO as the only Japanese cast from mainland China. The film tells a story about a high school baseball team in Taiwan. Umin Boya, the director, offered the role as he was impressed by Shibuya's performance in Ip Man. Shibuya was also happy to accept his offer not only base on the strength of the script, but also the reputation of the director of being cooperative and accepting to different opinions. Breaking the box office record in Taiwan, the film was also very successful in Japan, Hong Kong and some other countries. Shibuya appeared in Xiaobaohelaocai in 2013. It was his first opportunity for a comedic role in China which he loves to play. Being busy in Taiwan for shooting KANO at the time, he was able to join for one day shooting in Beijing. The supporting role of colonel Qingtian was a complicating one, despite appearance in few scenes. Colonel Qingtian, who stationed in China In the ending WW\u2161, got desperate as the situation of the war worsen. Knowing he would dispatch from his station the next day, he murdered another character, leading the turn of the plot. His part was insufficient to depict the character's personality, but Shibuya was able to act impromptu and even added humor to it. His performance was praised by both the crew members and the audience. Shibuya had been noted in main cast in spite of his small part. Shibuya continued to expand his range of roles that he could play in China through TV dramas Fenghuoshuangxiong (2013), Youchai (2015) and Tiezaishao (2015). In Fenghuoshuangxiong, he falls in love with a Japanese girl and losses her at the end of the story;http://ent.news.cn/2014-09/23/c_127022786.htmhttp://ent.qq.com/a/20140916/056812.htm in Youchai, he had a relationship with a Japanese female spy whose death causes his seek to vengeance;http://ent.163.com/16/0612/18/BPCNET59000333J5.htmlhttp://www.sznews.com/ent/content/2016-06/12/content_13471288.htm in Tiezaishao, he falls in love with a Chinese girl but is forced to kill her. Through his performance, viewers were able to see different emotions, and carefully shaped personalities, which is rare to see on roles such as Japanese soldiers. Shibuya had more freedom on choosing his future appearance as his fame and wealth increased by 2015. He led in Wanfeng, a graduation project by a group of student in Beijing Film Academy. Shibuya found it interesting to work with students because of their passion and talent, regardless of the budget of the film. He decided to join students\u2019 graduation film; not only to be an actor but also to give advises in all aspects of filmmaking. Shibuya values communication with directors and other crews, leading his repeated collaborations with many directors, including Xiao Feng. They kept in touch since they worked together in Hushed Roar in 2012, and when Xiao Feng directed Air Strike (Dahongzha) four years later, he entrusted Shibuya with the only Japanese main role.https://xw.qq.com/amphtml/20150723038263/ENT2015072303826300https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4743226/?ref_=nm_knf_i4https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/04/bruce- willis-signs-up-for-chinese-second-world-war- epichttps://worldwarwings.com/bruce-willis-stars-in-new-wwii-film-from-china- and-its-completely-ridiculous/https://www.rtbf.be/tv/detail_le-trailer-de-the- bombing-avec-adrien-brody-avec-bruce-willis-devoile?id=10015091 The film was co-produced by Chinese, Korean, and Hollywood teams.

All of the air battle scenes Shibuya acted were taken in the studio of special effect, which would have restricted his acting. Being in the cockpit, he could only act by facial expressions.
