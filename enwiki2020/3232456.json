    "text": "The Under-Secretary for Ireland (Permanent Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland) was the permanent head (or most senior civil servant) of the British administration in Ireland prior to the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922. The Under-Secretary's residence was at Ashtown Lodge in Phoenix Park, also known as the Under Secretary's Lodge. Among the best- known holders of the office was Thomas Henry Burke, who was assassinated along with the Chief Secretary for Ireland, Lord Frederick Cavendish, in the so- called Phoenix Park Killings on Saturday, 6 May 1882. In April 1887 Colonel Edward Robert King-Harman was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary to the Lord Lieutenant, but he died on 10 June 1888 and no further appointments were made.Haydn's Book of Dignities, third edition (1894) p. 564. ==Under- Secretaries for Ireland== * Thomas Waite 1747\u20131774 * Sackville Hamilton 1780\u20131795 * Lodge Morres 1795 * Sackville Hamilton 1795\u20131796 * Edward Cooke 1796-1801 * Alexander Marsden 1801-1806 * James Traill 1806-1808 * Sir Charles Saxton 1808-1812 * William Gregory 1812-1831 * Sir William Gossett 1831-1835 *Thomas Drummond 1835\u20131840Famous scots, Retrieved 9 January 2009 *Norman Hilton Macdonald 1840\u20131841 *Edward Lucas 1841\u20131845 *Richard Pennefather 1845\u20131846 *Sir Thomas Nicholas Redington 1846\u20131852 *John Arthur Wynne 1852\u20131853 *Sir Thomas Aiskew Larcom 1853\u20131868 *Sir Edward Robert Wetherall 1868\u20131869 *Thomas Henry Burke 1869\u20131882 *Sir Robert George Crookshank Hamilton 1882\u20131886 *Sir Redvers Henry Buller 1886\u20131887 *Sir Joseph West Ridgeway 1887\u20131893 *Sir David Harrel 1893\u20131902 *Sir Antony MacDonnell 1902\u20131908 *Sir James Brown Dougherty 1908\u20131914 *Sir Matthew Nathan 1914\u20131916 *Sir Robert Chalmers 1916 *Sir William Byrne 1916\u20131918 *James Macmahon 1918\u20131922 (jointly with Sir John Anderson from 1920) *Sir John Anderson 1920\u20131922 (jointly with James Macmahon) ==Assistant Under-Secretaries for Ireland (1895 onwards)== *Sir James Brown Dougherty 1895\u20131908 *Sir Alfred Cope 1920\u20131922 *Sir Mark Beresford Russell Grant-Sturgis 1920\u20131922 ==References== * Chris Cook and Brendan Keith, British Historical Facts 1830\u20131900 (Macmillan, 1975) p. 149.
