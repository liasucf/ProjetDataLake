    "text": "Line G is a planned addition to the Buenos Aires Underground which has been on the drawing board in numerous forms since the 1930s. After a failed attempt at financing and building the line in 2009, its most recent proposal was put forward in 2015 by the government of Buenos Aires. ==History== The original plan proposed by CHADOPyF includes large parts of what today is known as Line G. The history of Line G dates back to 1930 when the Hispano-Argentine Company for Public Works and Finances (CHADOPyF) was tasked with expanding the network following the construction of Line A by the Anglo-Argentine Tramways Company. The company had been tasked with building four new lines, with Line 3 running from Plaza de Mayo to the intersections of San Mart\u00edn and Gaona Avenues, the current location of the Sid Campeador monument, which would be built in 1935. By 1932, the original plans had been revised twice and the number of projected lines was reduced to three, with parts of lines 3 and 4 being merged into a new Line 3 (today known as Line D), and the western section of Line 3 being left on the drawing board, later to re-emerge as the planned Line G. ===Law 670=== On 8 November 2001, the government of the City of Buenos Aires established a law outlining the future expansion of the Underground network, which included three new lines; F, G and I, as well measures for the advancement of Line H. Line G would start at Retiro Mitre railway station and then head west, terminating at the Cid Campeador monument, near Parque Centenario in the Caballito neighborhood. The line, which was to stretch 7.3km and have 11 station, was then planned as follows: In December 2009, the City of Buenos Aires had made significant advances in negotiating financing and construction equipment from Exim Bank of China and China Railway Group Limited (CREC). The construction of the line was to be done with tunnel boring machines, allowing for the tunnel to advance an average of 15 metres per day and CREC would be in charge of all aspects of construction and sourcing of materials as well as rolling stock. By early 2011, it was announced that the government had obtained financing for $1.4 billion for the line and was to begin construction in 2012, concluding in 2016. The line was now to be 12.5km long and terminate further west at Villa del Parque, continuing on from the Sid Campeador terminus envisioned in Law 670. Once the project had reached the Buenos Aires City Legislature, many aspects of the deal were questioned, including the cost of the line which was estimated to be significantly cheaper ($1 billion) if built directly by the city. Following these setbacks, later that year construction was postponed indefinitely. ===PETERS Plan=== In 2015 plans for the Underground published by the Buenos Aires, the line was re- designed completely, running through the financial district of the city in between Line F and Line C before running westwards towards Palermo, proximately parallel to and just north of Line D. Construction on the line was to begin sometime after construction begins on Line F. ==References== == External links == * Subterr\u00e1neos de Buenos Aires (Official Page) New Lines * Buenos Aires Ciudad (Official Government Page) Nuevas L\u00edneas: F, G and I (Spanish) * Current system map Category:Buenos Aires Underground Category:Proposed railway lines in Argentina ",
