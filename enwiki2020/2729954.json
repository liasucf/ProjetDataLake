He is also the former CEO of Football Operations at the Newcastle Knights. He played the majority of his career at Newcastle, winning a premiership in 2001, before playing four seasons for St Helens in the Super League. ==Background== Gidley was born in Newcastle, New South Wales, Australia. Matt is the older brother of the former Newcastle Knights and Warrington Wolves halfback Kurt Gidley. Playing as a youngster in the Newcastle Rugby League for the Wests club, While attending Glendale High School, Gidley played for the Australian Schoolboys team in 1995. ==Playing career== ===Newcastle=== Gidley had played all his junior football in the position, however with Matthew Johns taking up the position in the Knights line up, he slotted in to right . Gidley was selected for the Australian team to compete in the end of season 1999 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against New Zealand he played at centre in the Kangaroos' 22-20 victory. Gidley played at centre for Newcastle in their 2001 NRL grand final victory against the Parramatta Eels.

Gidley played at centre and scored a try in Newcastle's loss. Gidley became famous for his wing/centre combination with former Knight Timana Tahu. A common play was for the ball to be sent out to the right side of the field where Gidley would run, draw one or two players in before doing the famous Gidley flick pass to Tahu or placing a grubber kick down the line. This play was used at both club and representative level. 2006 saw a rejuvenation of sorts for Gidley seeing him recapture some of his old magic flick pass play with Knights winger Brian Carney. In 2006 Gidley retired from representative football, aiming to focus on playing well at club level.
