This was the second year in which broadcaster France 3 had been in charge of the French participation, and as in 1999 they opted to choose their entry via public selection, with a national final being organised on 15 February 2000. However the poor result obtained by Nayah in 1999 followed by the even worse result in 2000, together with the controversy surrounding the 2000 selection process, led to France 3 changing to internal selection in the years following, initially with much greater success. ==Before Eurovision== === Eurovision 2000: La S\u00e9lection === 14 entries were selected to compete in the national final after France 3 requested proposals from record companies in October 1999. The final took place on 15 February 2000 at L'Olympia in Paris, hosted by Julien Lepers and Karen Cheryl. The winning song was determined by public televoting (50%) and a jury panel (50%). The jury panel included former French Eurovision representatives Patrick Fiori (1993) and Marie Myriam (1977). Only the top three placings were announced. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto; text-align:center\" |- bgcolor=\"#CCCCCC\" ! Draw ! Artist ! Song !

The explanation of France 3 - that \"On aura le ciel\" came second in the televote while \"Espoir\" was ranked only fourth by the jury - prompted complaints that in the event of the televote and jury vote coming up with different winners, the televote should have taken precedence, otherwise there was a degree of dishonesty in asking the public to pay to vote, only for their choice to be overruled by a small group of jurors (A similar controversy would later engulf the 2005 Swedish selection).ESC National Finals database 2000 == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Mestari performed fifth in the running order, following Estonia and preceding Romania. At the close of voting \"On aura le ciel\" had received only 5 points (3 from Russia and 2 from the Netherlands), placing France 23rd of the 24 entries, ahead only of Belgium. This was the second time in three contests that France had finished one place off the bottom, and led to reiterated claims that the wrong song for a televoting environment had been sent. The 12 points from the French televote were awarded to Turkey.ESC History - France 2000 ===Points awarded by France=== ====Final==== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"gold\"|12 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"silver\"|10 points|| |- |width=20% bgcolor=\"#CC9966\"|8 points|| |- |width=20%|7 points|| |- |width=20%|6 points|| |- |width=20%|5 points|| |- |width=20%|4 points|| |- |width=20%|3 points|| |- |width=20%|2 points|| |- |width=20%|1 point|| |- |} ===Points awarded to France=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Points awarded to France (final) |- !width=20%|12 points !width=20%|10 points !width=20%|8 points !width=20%|7 points !width=20%|6 points |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | |- !width=20%|5 points !width=20%|4 points !width=20%|3 points !width=20%|2 points !width=20%|1 point |- | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | * | valign=\"top\" | |} ==See also== *France in the Eurovision Song Contest *Eurovision Song Contest 2000 == References == Category:Countries in the Eurovision Song Contest 2000 Category:France in the Eurovision Song Contest Category:2000 in French music ",
