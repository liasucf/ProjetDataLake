The album included a cover version of a song by Jack Bruce with whom Coryell toured in 1968.The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Rock, ed. by Nick Logan & Bob Woffinden of New Musical Express, Harmony Books-Salamander Books, London, 1976, p.44 Rolling Stone stated the album showed Coryell with a power-trio in rock form. In his memoir, Coryell stated that Bronson and Wilkinson formed a tight rhythm-section, although it may seem an odd combination. His son Murali appeared on the album jacket.Improvising: My Life in Music, Larry Coryell, Hal Leonard Corp-Backbeat Books, Milwaukee, 2007, p.83 ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Larry Coryell \u2013 guitar, vocals * Julie Coryell \u2013 vocals on \"Beyond These Chilling Winds\" * Mervin Bronson \u2013 bass * Harry Wilkinson \u2013 drums ==References== Category:1971 albums Category:Larry Coryell albums Category:Albums recorded at the Village Gate Category:Vanguard Records albums Category:Vanguard Records live albums ",
