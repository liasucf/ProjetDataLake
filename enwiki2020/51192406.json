    "text": "Just Sing is a karaoke video game developed by iNiS and published by Ubisoft, which was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on September 6, 2016. After only 18 months Ubisoft announced they will pull the plug on the online features of Just Sing in June 2018 leaving those that purchased the game with just the core base game to play. Those that bought extra packs have been directed to Ubisoft support for compensation, amounts will be updated here once known. == Gameplay == Just Sing is divided into \"Party\" and \"Battle\" modes; Party mode allows players to record lip sync music videos, while Battle is a competitive mode. The game supports the use of a companion mobile app for Android and iOS smartphones, which utilizes the device's internal microphone and camera in-game (as opposed to a wired USB microphone). Kinect and PlayStation Camera can also be used to record video footage. ==Soundtrack== The following songs are contained within the game: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%;\" |+ |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\" | Song ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:150px;\" | Artist ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:30px;\" | Year |- | \"All About That Bass\" || Meghan Trainor || 2015 |- | \"All of Me\" || John Legend || 2014 |- | \"...Baby One More Time\" || Britney Spears || 1998 |- | \"Call Me Maybe\" || Carly Rae Jepsen || 2012 |- | \"Can You Feel the Love Tonight\" || Elton John, Disney's The Lion King || 1994 |- | \"Zero\" || Chris Brown || 2015 |- | \"Chandelier\" || Sia || 2014 |- | \"Colors of the Wind\" || Disney's Pocahontas || 1995 |- | \"Counting Stars\" || OneRepublic || 2013 |- | \"Don't Worry, Be Happy\" || Bobby McFerrin || 1988 |- | \"Drag Me Down\" || One Direction || 2015 |- | \"Focus\" || Ariana Grande || 2015 |- | \"I Love Rock 'n' Roll\" || The Arrows || 1975 |- | \"I Want to Break Free\" || Queen || 1984 |- | \"I Want You Back\" || Jackson 5 || 1969 |- | \"I Will Survive\" || Gloria Gaynor || 1978 |- | \"It's Raining Men\" || The Weather Girls || 1983 |- | \"Kryptonite\" || 3 Doors Down || 2000 |- | \"Let Her Go\" || Passenger || 2013 |- | \"Let It Go\" || Disney's Frozen || 2013 |- | \"Love Me Like You Do\" || Ellie Goulding || 2015 |- | \"Love Shack\" || The B-52's || 1989 |- | \"My Heart Will Go On\" || Celine Dion || 1997 |- | \"No One\" || Alicia Keys || 2007 |- | \"One More Night\" || Maroon 5 || 2012 |- | \"Radioactive\" || Imagine Dragons || 2013 |- | \"Relax, Take It Easy\" || Mika || 2007 |- | \"Rude\" || Magic! || 2014 |- | \"Shut Up and Dance\" || Walk the Moon || 2014 |- | \"Stand By Me\" || Ben E.
