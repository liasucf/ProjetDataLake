The song was chosen internally by broadcaster France 3. == At Eurovision == On the night of the final Fran\u00e7ois performed 17th in the running order, following Belgium and preceding Germany. \"Il faut du temps\" was a tuneful big ballad which built to a dramatic climax, and was tipped to do well in an unspectacular field. At the close of voting \"Il faut du temps\" had received 104 points (including a maximum 12 from Finland), placing France 5th of the 24 entries - the first time France had gained back-to-back top 5 placements since 1990/1991.
