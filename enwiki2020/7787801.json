The players demanded security of contract for all games during the season and the right to organise their own termsKynaston, David; WG\u2019s Birthday Party; p. 28. rather than those set by the MCC, which during the 1870s as county cricket grew established a strong grip on terms for professional players. The dispute meant that seven of Nottinghamshire\u2019s top players did not play for the first half of the season, and leading batsman Arthur Shrewsbury played only three first-class games all year. Shaw and Shrewsbury used the dispute to organise an eight-month tour of Australia and New Zealand during the winter. ==Notable events== * The scheduled 18 to 20 July county match between Lancashire and Middlesex was cancelled because Harrow Wanderers booked Lord\u2019s ground and no alternative arrangement could be made to play the game. ==See also== *Derbyshire County Cricket Club in 1881 ==Notes== An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted. Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. The match between Middlesex and Lancashire at Lord\u2019s was cancelled because Harrow Wanderers had booked the ground on the same day. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketer\u2019s Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1882 * James Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1882 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1882 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1881 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
