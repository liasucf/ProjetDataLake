In 1804, upon the death of another unmarried and childless cousin John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe, the titles Earl Ker and Baron Ker, which had been created for his uncle in 1722 in the Peerage of Great Britain, became extinct and seventy-five year old William succeeded to the dukedom, all of its other subsidiary titles, and the family seat, Floors Castle in Roxburghshire on the banks of the River Tweed in south-east Scotland. ==Personal life== William was twice married.
