    "text": "Joe Slattery is a former ice hockey winger who played for Colorado College in the 1940s. ==Career== Joe made the Tigers' varsity squad just in time for their first full season since the end of World War II. His scoring punch helped the Tigers become one of the more dominant teams of the era, finishing with records of above 0.650 in each of his three seasons. Slattery's breakout year happened in 1947\u201348 when he led the team with 38 goals and was selected as one of the inaugural AHCA First Team All-Americans. He did not lead the team in scoring until the following year, however, when he posted 25 goals and 25 assists and was honored with his second All-American selection. Slattery's team records would not stand for long as nearly all of his scoring milestones were surpassed by Ron Hartwell. ==Statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text- align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
