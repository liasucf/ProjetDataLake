    "text": "The Shade of Poison Trees is the fifth studio album recorded by the band Dashboard Confessional. ==Production and composition== The Shade of Poison Trees had been recorded over 10 days in Florida with producer Don Gilmore and engineer Mark Kiczula. Recording took place at Bieler Brothers Studio with assistant engineer Matt LaPlant, and at The Dungeon with assistant engineer Joe Williams. Gilmore mixed the recordings with help from Kiczula, at Bieler Brothers Studio. George Marino mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound. The Shade of Poison Trees is heralded as a return to form, so to speak, breaking away from the electric, full band sound of their previous two albums and returning to the acoustic sound that Carrabba was previously known for. However, the album is unmistakably more mature, as the songs sound similar to their more recent work, yet without the heavily produced style. ==Release== On August 17, 2007, The Shade of Poison Trees was announced for release, and \"Thick as Thieves\" was made available for streaming via the group's Myspace account. \"Thick as Thieves\" was released as the first single off the album in August. On August 23, the band posted \"Little Bombs\" on their Myspace page. On September 7, Chris Carrabba posted a video message on his Myspace blog, inviting his fans to create a music video for the song \"Thick as Thieves\". The winning director wins a prize of $2,500 cash, two VIP tickets, and a \"Golden Ticket\" to any and all Dashboard Confessional concerts in the next year. From mid-September to mid-November, Carrabba went on a solo US tour with support from Augustana and John Ralston. On September 25, the band added \"Keep Watch for the Mines\" to their Myspace page. The album in its entirety was posted on the band's Myspace page on September 28, 2007, and it was released on October 2 on Vagrant Records. \"Thick as Thieves\" was released to radio on October 2. In November and December, the band went a brief arena tour in the UK with Maroon 5. \"These Bones\" was Dashboard Confessional's second single off the album and was released December 3, 2007. In late January 2008, the band went on a brief tour of the UK. In April, the band went on another tour of the UK. \"Thick as Thieves\" was released as a single on April 14. In October and November, the band co-headlined the Rock Band Live tour with Panic! at the Disco.
