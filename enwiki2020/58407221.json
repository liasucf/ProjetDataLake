    "text": "Umm Al Nar tomb at Al Sufouh, Dubai The territory currently known as the United Arab Emirates was formerly populated by inhabitants of a number of coastal and inland settlements, with human remains pointing to a pattern of transmigration and settlement as far back as 125,000 years. Prehistoric settlement in the UAE took place in the Neolithic, with a number of distinctive eras of ancient settlement including the Stone Age Arabian Bifacial and Ubaid cultures from 5000 to 3100 BCE; the Hafit period with its distinctive beehive shaped tombs and Jemdet Nasr pottery, from 3200 to 2600 BCE; the Umm Al-Nar period from 2600 to 2000 BCE; the Wadi Suq Culture from 2000\u20131300 BCE and the three Iron Ages of the UAE. Iron Age I spanned 1200\u20131000 BCE; Iron Age II from 1000\u2013600 BCE and Iron Age III from 600\u2013300 BCE. This was followed by the Hellenistic Mleiha era, from 300 BCE onwards through to the Islamic era which commenced with the culmination of the 7th century Ridda Wars. The remains of settlements, burials and other extensive evidence of human habitation throughout these eras is littered throughout the UAE, with many extensive finds of rich materials in the shape of pottery, jewellery, weapons and both human and animal remains providing archaeologists and researchers with an increasingly sophisticated picture of longstanding involvement in regional trade alongside nomadic cultures eking out a living from the frequently arid and inhospitable desert and mountain environment of the UAE. == Settlements == {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Settlement !Emirate (modern) !Populated !Notes |- |Al-Ashoosh |Dubai |2500\u20132000 BCE |Umm Al Nar site with no burial discovered. |- |Al Madam |Sharjah |1100\u2013300 BCE |Iron age aflaj (water systems) |- |Al Sufouh |Dubai |2500\u20132000 BCE |Umm Al Nar site with tomb |- |Bidaa bint Saud |Abu Dhabi |3200\u20132600 BCE |Hafit and Iron age burials |- |Bithnah |Fujairah |2000\u2013300 BCE |Wadi Suq burials and iron age petroglyphs |- |Ed-Dur |Umm Al Quwain |5300 BCE\u2013300 CE |Major ancient city/settlement spanning Ubeid period through Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq to Iron Age |- |Hili |Abu Dhabi |3200\u20132600 BCE |Hafit and Umm Al Nar tombs |- |Jebel Buhais |Sharjah |5000\u20131300 BCE |Necropolis featuring Stone, Bronze, Iron and Hellenistic age burials |- |Jebel Faya |Sharjah |125,000 BCE |Neolithic, Paleolithic, Stone, Bronze age finds (See Mleiha) |- |Jebel Hafeet |Abu Dhabi |3200-2600 BC |Gave its name to the Hafit period, extensive beehive tombs, with some reconstructed |- |Jumayra |Dubai | |Connected to the historical region of Tawam. |- |Kalba |Sharjah |2500\u20131300 BCE |Umm Al Nar settlement |- |Masafi |Ras Al Khaimah |1300\u2013300 BCE |Iron age finds |- |Mleiha |Sharjah |5300\u2013300 BCE |Settlement through Ubaid, Hafit, Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq and Iron Age to Hellenistic Mleiha period. |- |Muweilah |Sharjah |1100\u2013600 BCE |Iron Age II settlement |- |Qattara Oasis |Abu Dhabi |1800\u20131500 BCE |Bronze and Iron age settlement |- |Rumailah |Abu Dhabi |2000\u20131000 BCE |Umm Al Nar through to Iron Age II settlement |- |Saruq Al Hadid |Dubai |2600 BCE\u20131000 CE |Occupation since Umm Al Nar period, major Iron Age metallurgical centre |- |Seih Al Harf |Ras Al Khaimah |2000\u20131300 BCE |Extensive Wadi Suq burial site |- |Shimal |Ras Al Khaimah |2500\u20131300 BCE |Umm Al Nar/Wadi Suq burials |- |Tell Abraq |Umm Al Quwain/Sharjah |2500\u2013400 BCE |Major settlement, spanning Umm Al Nar, Wadi Suq and Iron Age |- |Thuqeibah |Sharjah |1100\u2013400 BCE |Iron age II and III settlement |- |Umm Al-Nar |Abu Dhabi |2600\u20132000 BCE |Burials and settlement defined the Umm Al Nar period |} == See also == * List of cultural property of national significance in the United Arab Emirates * List of cities of the ancient Near East == References == Category:History of the United Arab Emirates Category:History of the United Arab Emirates by period Category:Archaeology of the United Arab Emirates Category:United Arab Emirates-related lists ",
