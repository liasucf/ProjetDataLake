    "text": "Hawthorn Elementary School, in Marengo, Illinois, was originally in Consolidated District 7, when it was built. Later, it joined with Marengo Consolidated District 140 and Union Consolidated School District 8 to form what is currently known as Marengo-Union Elementary School District 165. Hawthorn was for grades 2\u20134. Hawthorn stayed with District 165 for many years, until 2004, when they stopped using the school due to septic problems. In the years of 2008 and 2009, District 165 rented out the school to a private high school. Currently, the school is rented out for boy scouts and wrestling. ==References== Category:Former elementary schools in Illinois Category:Schools in McHenry County, Illinois ",
