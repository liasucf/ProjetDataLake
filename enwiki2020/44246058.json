Although Pakistan stalled, citing insufficient internal preparations, signing of two other agreements on Vehicular Traffic and Railways respectively. Although Nepalese Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, current SAARC Chair, expressed his hope that the 'Regulation of Passenger and Cargo Vehicular Traffic amongst SAARC Member States', and 'SAARC Regional Agreement on Railways' would be signed later after the Transport Ministers of these countries reviewed them. It was also decided that Pakistan will host the next summit in 2016. The India-Pakistan stand-off on the first day threatened to jeopardize the entire summit process as Pakistan seemed to be in the mood to block every Indian led proposal. But the next day things have changed when the two Prime Ministers met privately at the retreat session which led to Pakistan agreeing one out of three proposed agreements and they also met and shook hands publicly during the closing ceremony and this 'transient peace' in the relation was believed to brokered by the Nepalese side as a face-saving measure for the Kathmandu summit. China, which holds an observer status in the group, was represented by Vice Foreign Minister Liu Zhenmin seen actively promoting a more active role for itself in the region including infrastructure funding through its proposed 'Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank' (AIIB) and extending its ambitious Maritime Silk Road project to South Asian nations. Pakistan, China's all weather friend, also vouched for a more participatory role for the observer nations in the summit process, indirectly advocating for a more Chinese involvement. Although no such proposal was accepted because of India's reservation. ==Aftermath== With the ongoing cold relationships between India and Pakistan, the formal handshake between the Prime Ministers from both the countries caught a lot of attention and was applauded by everyone in the Summit Hall. In this way the 18th SAARC summit was over ==Gallery of participating leaders== File:Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai July 2014 (cropped).jpg| Ashraf Ghani President of Afghanistan File:Sheikh_Hasina_-_2009.jpg| Sheikh Hasina Prime Minister of Bangladesh File:Tshering Tobgay.jpg| Tshering Tobgay Prime Minister of Bhutan File:PM Modi 2015.jpg| Narendra Modi Prime Minister of India Abdulla Yameen President of Maldives File:Sushil Koirala.jpg| Sushil Koirala Prime Minister of Nepal File:PrimeMinisterNawazSharif.jpg| Nawaz Sharif Prime Minister of Pakistan File:Maithripala- Russia (portrait).jpg| Maithripala Sirisena President of Sri Lanka File:Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom in January 2014.jpg| Abdulla Yameen President of the Maldives ==See also== * List of SAARC summits * Declaration of 18th SAARC Summit * SAARC satellite ==References== ==External links== * Summit, 18 Category:2014 in international relations Category:2014 in Nepal Category:Kathmandu Category:21st century in Kathmandu Category:21st-century diplomatic conferences Category:2014 conferences Category:History of Nepal (2008\u2013present) Category:Diplomatic conferences in Nepal ",
