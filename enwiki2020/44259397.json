    "text": "Chlorodiisopropylphosphine is an organophosphorus compound with the formula [(CH3)2CH]2PCl. It is a colorless liquid that reacts with water and oxygen. The compound is used to prepare tertiary phosphines and phosphinite ligands. ==Synthesis and reactions== The compound is prepared by treating phosphorus trichloride with the Grignard reagent isopropylmagnesium chloride: :PCl3 \\+ 2 (CH3)2CHMgCl \u2192 [(CH3)2CH]2PCl + 2 MgCl2 Relative to the reaction of less hindered Grignard reagents with PCl3, this reaction affords a superior yield of the monochloro derivative. Chlorodiisopropylphosphine reacts with Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds to give phosphines: : [(CH3)2CH]2PCl + RM \u2192 [(CH3)2CH]2PR + MCl Chlorodiisopropylphosphine reacts with alcohols and phenols to give phosphinites, this reaction typically is conducted in the presence of a base: : [(CH3)2CH]2PCl + ROH \u2192 [(CH3)2CH]2POR + HCl Phosphinites are versatile ligands.for example: Pandarus, V., Zargarian, D., \"New Pincer- Type Diphosphinito (POCOP) Complexes of Nickel\", Organometallics 2007, volume 26, 4321. == References == Category:Phosphines Category:Isopropyl compounds ",
