    "text": "The Lady's Museum was a monthly magazine published in the United Kingdom between 1760 and 1761. The magazine was edited and largely\u2014if not entirely\u2014written by British novelist and translator Charlotte Lennox. Like most eighteenth-century periodicals, The Lady\u2019s Museum presented itself as a means of educating and informing its readers. In this, it resembles an earlier women\u2019s periodical, The Female Spectator (1744-6), by Eliza Haywood. ==References== Category:Magazines established in 1760 Category:Defunct women's magazines published in the United Kingdom ",
