Before 1887, no more than two had ever done so in one season.Wynne- Thomas; The Rigby A-Z of Cricket Records; pp. 17\u201320 # W.G. Grace for the third time reached 2,000 runs; an aggregate not reached by any other batsman until 1893. # Arthur Shrewsbury averaged 78.71 for twenty-three innings, beating W.G. Grace's 1871 record of 78.25. This was not beaten until Robert Poore averaged 91.23 in 1899. # Shrewsbury's innings of 267 against Middlesex, at 615 minutes,Nottinghamshire v Middlesex in 1887 remains the longest innings ever played in a county match. # Walter Read became the first batsman to play two consecutive innings of over 200,Webber, Roy; The Playfair Book of Cricket Records; p. 43. Published 1951 by Playfair Books. scoring 247 against LancashireLancashire v Surrey in 1887 and 244 against Cambridge UniversitySurrey v Cambridge University in 1887 * For the last time until 1970,Preston, Norman (editor); Wisden, 108th Edition (1971); p. 278 no bowler took nine wickets in an innings, with the best analysis being eight for 26 by Dick Barlow. * As a result of some extremely bad results (only three wins and twenty-nine losses from thirty-five games) and financial trouble, Derbyshire were demoted from first-class status at the end of the season, not to return until 1895. * An unofficial points system of one point for a win and half a point for a draw was devised by the \"Cricket Reporting Agency\" as a replacement for the former method of fewest matches lost to decide the \"Champion County\". Along with a more rigid schedule, it became the ancestor of the official County Championship from 1890 onwards. ==Notes== An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted. Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi- official status can be ascribed. The 1887 season saw an unofficial point system of 1 point for a win and 0.5 points for a draw devised by the \"Cricket Reporting Agency\" ==References== ==Annual reviews== * James Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketers' Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1888 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1888 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1887 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
