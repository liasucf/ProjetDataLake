    "text": "James Anthony Stodart, Baron Stodart of Leaston PC (6 June 1916 \u2013 31 May 2003) was a Scottish Conservative politician. The son of a colonel in the Indian medical service, he took over the family farm at Kingston, North Berwick, East Lothian, after his father died when he was just eighteen years old. Eventually, he farmed more than at Leaston, near Humbie, East Lothian. Although he was an active Unionist in his youth, he fell out with the party and joined the Liberal Party, standing as their candidate in Berwick and East Lothian at the 1950 general election. By the following year, Stodart had returned to the Tory fold and was Unionist candidate for Midlothian and Peebles at the 1951 snap election and for Midlothian in 1955. At the 1959 general election, he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Edinburgh West, which he held until the October 1974 general election, when he was succeeded by fellow Conservative Lord James Douglas-Hamilton. Stodart served as a junior Scottish Office Minister under Sir Alec Douglas-Home from 1963\u201364, and at the Ministry of Agriculture under the leadership of Edward Heath, from 1970\u201374. After leaving the House of Commons, he became chairman of the Agriculture Credit Corporation from 1975-1987 and chaired an inquiry into Scottish local government in 1980. He was created a life peer as Baron Stodart of Leaston, of Humbie in the District of East Lothian on 1 June 1981. His wife Hazel died in 1995. They had no children. == References == * == External links == * Category:1916 births Category:2003 deaths Stodart of Leaston Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Members of the Parliament of the United Kingdom for Edinburgh constituencies Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ministers in the Macmillan and Douglas-Home governments, 1957\u20131964 Category:People educated at Wellington College, Berkshire Category:People from Edinburgh Category:People from Midlothian Category:People from North Berwick Category:People from the Scottish Borders Category:Scottish Conservative Party MPs Category:Scottish Liberal Party parliamentary candidates Category:UK MPs 1959\u20131964 Category:UK MPs 1964\u20131966 Category:UK MPs 1966\u20131970 Category:UK MPs 1970\u20131974 Category:UK MPs 1974 Category:Unionist Party (Scotland) MPs ",
