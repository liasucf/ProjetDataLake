Osuna obtained her PhD in 2010 at the University of Girona (Spain) under the supervision of Miquel Sol\u00e0 and Marcel Swart. Upon graduation, she moved to the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA, USA) for a two-year postdoctoral position at the group of Prof. K. N. Houk. In 2013, she was awarded the Juan de la Cierva postdoctoral position, and in 2015 the Ram\u00f3n y Cajal position. In 2015, she was awarded an ERC-StG project for developing a new computational protocol for designing new enzymes (ERC-2015-StG-679001, NetMoDEzyme). She is currently the group leader of CompBioLab group at the Institute of Computational Chemistry and Catalysis (IQCC) at the University of Girona. During her scientific career, she has worked on the computational design of enzymes important for their potential applications in medicine. Osuna is author of several publications in international peer-reviewed journals.Romero-Rivera, A.; Garcia-Borr\u00e0s, M.; Osuna, S.
