    "text": "Prayagraj Ardh Kumbh Mela, 2019 was the Ardh Kumbh Mela held at Triveni Sangam in Prayagraj, Uttar Pradesh, India from 15 January to 4 March 2019. ==Governance== A bill was passed in Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly to set up Prayagraj Mela Authority, a permanent body to oversee the mela. The divisional commission of Allahabad, now known as Prayagraj(the city's original name was reverted back into use) serves its chairperson while the district magistrate and inspector general of police as the vice-chairpersons. Mela officers and other district officials are also the members of this authority. ==Projects== Around \u20b94200 crore will be allotted by the state government for the Ardh Kumbh 2019, over two times more than it had spent on the last Kumbh held in 2013. About 199 projects of 16 government departments are underway under four phases which includes a six-lane bridge over the river Ganga and a four-lane railway over-bridge worth \u20b9275 crore. The Public Works Department has to execute projects worth \u20b9430 crore including building an inner ring road in the city. \u20b9210 crore would be spent on safe drinking water facilities and \u20b960 crore to electrify the Kumbh area. Focus is also laid on solid waste management to ensure that Ganga water is not contaminated and putting up LED lights. Moreover, widening and beautification of 18 roads and 25 road crossings is being done with the deadline of October 2018. ==Promotion== The logo of 2019 Kumbh shows a group of Sadhus bathing in the Sangam confluence of the Ganga and the Yamuna. The Uttar Pradesh government has decreed that all state government documents, letterheads and publicity material, including advertisements and hoardings, should carry the new logo. Moreover, cinema halls in the state are directed to display the logo straight after the national anthem is played. ==See also== *Prayag Kumbh Mela ==References== ==External links== * Official Website * Kumbh Mela 2019 in Prayagraj: documentary photo of the largest religious gathering in the world.
