Ignorance is a lack of knowledge and information. The word \"ignorant\" is an adjective that describes a person in the state of being unaware, or even cognitive dissonance and other cognitive relation, and can describe individuals who deliberately ignore or disregard important information or facts, or individuals who are unaware of important information or facts. Ignorance can appear in three different types: factual ignorance (absence of knowledge of some fact), object ignorance (unacquaintance with some object), and technical ignorance (absence of knowledge of how to do something).Nottelmann, Nikolaj. \"ignorance.\" Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, edited by Robert Audi, Cambridge University Press, 3rd edition, 2015. ==Consequences== Ignorance can have negative effects on individuals and societies, but can also benefit them by creating within them the desire to know more. For example, ignorance within science opens the opportunity to seek knowledge and make discoveries by asking new questions.[null Firestein], Stuart. Ignorance: How It Drives Science. Oxford University Press, 2012. Though this can only take place if the individual possesses a curious mind. Studies suggest that adults with an adequate education who perform enriching and challenging jobs are happier, and more in control of their environment.Schieman, Scott and Gabriele Plickert. \"How Knowledge Is Power: Education and the Sense of Control.\" Social Forces, vol. 87, no. 1, Sept. 2008, pp. 153-183. The confidence that adults obtain through the sense of control that education provides allows those adults to go for more leadership positions and seek for power throughout their lives. In 1984, author Thomas Pynchon observed: \"We are often unaware of the scope and structure of our ignorance. Ignorance is not just a blank space on a person's mental map. It has contours and coherence, and for all I know rules of operation as well. So as a corollary to writing about what we know, maybe we should add getting familiar with our ignorance, and the possibilities therein for ruining a good story.\" ==See also== * Agnoiology \u2013 the theoretical study of the unknown and the unknowable * Agnotology \u2013 the study of culturally-induced ignorance or doubt * Avidy\u0101, ignorance, a concept in Vedanta.
