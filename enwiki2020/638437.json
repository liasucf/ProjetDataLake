Born to a family of high-ranking servants to the Tokugawa Shogunate, he was trained by Kan\u014d school artists Kan\u014d Gyokuen and Kan\u014d Chikanobu, although he was never officially recognized as a Kan\u014d school painter. ==Art career== After retiring from service to the shogunate, he became a teacher to numerous apprentices in poetry and painting. He was among the first to apply Kan\u014d techniques to ukiyo-e printmaking, inventing key new techniques along the way, such as fuki-bokashi, which allowed for replicating color gradations. Most famously, he was the teacher of Kitagawa Utamaro and Utagawa Toyoharu. Sekien is best known for his mass-produced illustrated books of y\u014dkai that had appeared in Hyakki Yagy\u014d monster parade scrolls. The first book proved popular enough to spawn three sequels, the last of which features y\u014dkai mainly out of Sekien's imagination. Although sometimes described as a \"demonologist,\" his work is better described as a literary parody of encyclopedias such as the Japanese Wakan Sansai Zue or the Chinese Classic of Mountains and Seas, which were popular in Japan at the time. His portrayals of these creatures from folklore essentially established their visual portrayals in the public's mind and deeply inspired other Japanese artists in his own and later eras, including ukiyo-e artists Tsukioka Yoshitoshi, Kawanabe Ky\u014dsai, and manga artist Mizuki Shigeru. ==Notable works== * * * * * * ==References== ==External links== *Toriyamabiko, a copy of his first book, in the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston *Bridge of dreams: the Mary Griggs Burke collection of Japanese art, a catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Toriyama Sekien (see index) Category:1712 births Category:1788 deaths Category:Ukiyo-e artists Category:18th-century Japanese people Category:18th-century Japanese artists ",
