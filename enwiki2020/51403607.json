    "text": "James Samuel Thorne is an English professional footballer who most recently played for Hartlepool United as a forward. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Having progressed through the academy at his hometown club Manchester City, Thorne was released in 2014 without having made a first-team appearance. Following this, he had a short spell with Salford City before signing on non- contract terms with Macclesfield Town in 2015, for whom he made one appearance on the bench. Later that year, Thorne joined the academy at Nottingham Forest. ===Nottingham Forest=== Thorne began the 2015\u201316 season for Forest's under-21 side in fine form, scoring four goals in three games in the Professional Development League. As his form continued, clubs in Football Leagues One and Two were reported to be interested in taking Thorne on loan, but no move ever materialised. The following season, Thorne made his professional debut for the club on 23 August 2016, starting in a 2\u20131 win over Millwall in the EFL Cup. On 24 February 2017 Thorne returned to Macclesfield Town on a one-month loan deal, having failed to make another first-team appearance for Forest. ===Hartlepool United=== Thorne signed for Hartlepool United on 28 September 2017, following a successful trial period with the North-East club. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Macclesfield Town |2014\u201315 |Conference Premier |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!0!!0 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Nottingham Forest |2015\u201316 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |Championship |0||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!1!!0 |- |Macclesfield Town (loan) |2016\u201317 |National League |6||0||0||0||0||0||1||0||7||0 |- !colspan=3|Career total !6||0||0||0||1||0||1||0||8||0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Manchester Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Salford City F.C. players Category:Macclesfield Town F.C. players Category:Nottingham Forest F.C. players Category:Hartlepool United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:1996 births ",
