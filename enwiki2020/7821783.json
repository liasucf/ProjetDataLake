    "text": "Guglielmo Ciro Nasi (21 February 1879 \u2013 21 September 1971) was an Italian general who fought in Italian East Africa during World War II. ==Biography== Nasi was born in Civitavecchia, Latium. In 1912 he was sent to Libya as a Captain with the 8th Artillery Regiment and the following year was decorated for military valor at the action at Safsaf. He fought in the First World War and ended the conflict as a Lieutenant Colonel. From 1924-1928, he was the military representative of the Italian Regio Esercito (Royal Army) in Paris. In 1928, Nasi was sent to the Italian colonies as Chief-of-Staff for the Colonial Troops and was Vice-Governor of Cyrenaica in 1934-1935, Governor of Harar from 1936\u20131939, and Governor of Shewa in 1939-1940. He also served as a Vice-Governor of Italian East Africa from 1939. Nasi promoted a moral reformation of the military and civil administration and he showed notable skills in dealing with indigenous chiefs. In April 1936, during the Second Italo-Abyssinian War, Nasi commanded the left column of three columns during Generale Rodolfo Graziani\u2032s advance on the southern front. Most of Nasi's troops were Libyans. After the beginning of World War II, Nasi led the Italian conquest of British Somaliland in August 1940. He successfully invaded British Somaliland and, with the advantage of air cover and tanks, forced the defending British and Commonwealth forces to evacuate by sea to Aden after defeating the main body of their army at the Battle of Tug Argan from 11-15 August. In early 1941, during the British counter-offensive, Nasi was forced to retreat to the stronghold of Gondar. During the East African Campaign, Nasi led the last stand of an Italian garrison in East Africa. On 6 July, after Duke Amedeo of Aosta and Generale Pietro Gazzera surrendered, Nasi became the acting Governor-General of Italian East Africa. While he held out long after other Italian strongholds had fallen, Nasi finally surrendered his stronghold of Gondar on 28 November 1941. Nasi was sent to Kenya as a prisoner of war. After the death of Duke Amedeo, he was responsible for the 60,000 Italian prisoners kept there. Nasi returned to Italy in 1945. Four years later, he was appointed as Commissar for Somalia when the latter was assigned to United Nations suzerainty. Nasi died at Modena in 1971. ==Aftermath== Although Nasi was listed as a war criminal by the post-war Ethiopian government, Italian historian Angelo Del Boca, usually very severe in judging the behaviour of Italian army in the colonies, considers him the best officer of the Italian Royal Army (Regio Esercito) in East Africa. Solomon Getahun supports this view of Nasi, noting that his behavior towards the inhabitants of Gondar and the adjoining territories helped him to sustain the fight against both British and Ethiopian forces as long as he did.Solomon Getamun, History of the City of Gondar (Africa World Press, 2005), pp. 38f Near Gondar a mount is still named Mount Nasi. ==See also== * Second Italo-Abyssinian War * East African Campaign (World War II) * Italian conquest of British Somaliland * Battle of Gondar ==References== Category:1879 births Category:1971 deaths Category:People from Civitavecchia Category:Italian generals Category:Italian diplomats Category:Italian military personnel of World War II Category:Italian military personnel of the Second Italo-Ethiopian War Category:People of former Italian colonies Category:Italian East Africa Category:Italian prisoners of war Category:Grand Officers of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus Category:Grand Officers of the Military Order of Savoy Category:Knights of the Order of Vittorio Veneto Category:Recipients of the Silver Medal of Military Valor Category:Recipients of the Maurician medal Category:Recipients of the War Merit Cross (Italy) Category:Governors of British Somaliland ",
