    "text": "Lurnea is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. It is 35 kilometres south-west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Liverpool. ==History== Lurnea was originally home to the Cabrogal people who spoke the Darug language. Following British settlement of the area in the 1800s, it was given the colloquial name Hillview as the suburb had nice views of the surrounding Liverpool area, and this name persisted until after World War I when the land was converted into a soldier settlement which provided the soldiers with enough room for a house and a small farm. It was renamed Lurnea which means \"a resting place\". Lurnea Post Office opened on 15 February 1921. A street was also named after the old name of the suburb - Hillview Parade. In the 1970s the area was redeveloped again into a residential suburb for a small number of veterans from the Vietnam War. It also became home to several Vietnamese refugee families of the aforementioned war.
