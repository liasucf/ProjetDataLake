Commonwealth Public Broadcasting Corporation, owners of WCVE-TV and WCVW-TV, applied for and received, a license to temporarily broadcast at 101.1 until a suitable permanent frequency could be found. From March 1988 to October 1989, 101.1 was the home of WCVE-FM and NPR. After WCVE-FM moved to a permanent home at 88.9, the 101.1 frequency went dark.\"Goodbye, radio WRFK, and hello new WCVE\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 5, 1988.\"Radio station to change today\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 6, 1988.\"WRFK-FM crosses river\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, May 7, 1988.\"WCVE to begin airing on from 88.9 FM on Monday\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, October 21, 1989.\"Richmond's public radio is home at last at 88.9\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, November 4, 1989. ===WDYL=== In December 1968, WDYL signed on first as a country station, then later as a religious station, where it operated on 92.1 FM until 1995.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-YB/1986/B-Radio-NE-to-Ter- B-Radio-All-BC-YB-1986.pdf Throughout its first stage of operation, WDYL-FM was a Christian music and ministry station, focusing on Contemporary Christian music. WDYL also was home to several sports teams, such as VCU basketball, VMI football, Virginia Tech football and basketball, and the Richmond Renegades pro hockey team. In a complicated series of events, on November 8, 1995, WDYL moved to 105.7 to allow WCDX (which was on 92.7 FM at the time) to move closer to the city with more power on 92.1. The 101.1 frequency was allotted to Chester (the former city of license of 92.1).\"Stations play musical frequencies to expand their listening audience\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, November 4, 1995. In September 1998, Sinclair Telecable sold the 101.1 frequency to Hoffman, who moved the WDYL call sign and format to 101.1 and traded the 105.7 frequency to Sinclair. Sinclair then signed off WSMJ, which had been on 101.1 and airing a smooth jazz format, and debuted the country- formatted WJRV on their newly purchased 105.7 frequency.\"Jazz station WSMJ off the air here\", The Richmond Times-Dispatch, September 29, 1998. WDYL then continued on 101.1 with Christian music.
