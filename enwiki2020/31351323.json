The game had a high reception of 8/10 on IGN, and as the 2010 title, it has an arcade and simulation mode with all the realistic motorbike settings, whilst the arcade has no realism and even slows the bike down off track. ==External== * Category:2011 video games Category:Windows games Category:Xbox 360 games Category:PlayStation 3 games Category:Superbike World Championship video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Milestone srl games Category:Video games developed in Italy ",
