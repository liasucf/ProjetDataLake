    "text": "The Western Women's Hockey League (WWHL) was a women's hockey league in Canada. The league was established in 2004, and consisted of teams in Canada (some former National Women's Hockey League teams) and one from the United States. The league office was in Vancouver, British Columbia and managed by Recreation Sports Management. == History == On July 13, 2006, the National Women's Hockey League announced it would absorb the WWHL's teams into its new West division. However, scheduling conflicts between the 2007 Women's World Championships and the WWHL championship game saw the merger collapse. In 2007, Hockey Canada announced it would revamp the Esso Women's Nationals, with the WWHL champion and finalist meeting the Canadian Women's Hockey League champion and finalist.https://www.thestar.com/article/261338 Since 2009, teams from the two leagues instead compete for the Clarkson Cup at the end of the season. In 2010, the WWHL champion Minnesota Whitecaps won the Clarkson Cup tournament, defeating three rivals from the Canadian Women's Hockey League. The Canadian Women's Hockey League announced on April 19, 2011, that it would merge with the Western Women's Hockey League for the 2011-12 season. The merger would feature one team based in Edmonton and Calgary and would be combination of the former WWHL franchises the Edmonton Chimos and Strathmore Rockies. The team would play their games in various locations around Alberta.Chimos Part of Merger With CWHL However, the WWHL was never folded properly. The WWHL executive committee accepted the resignations of the owners of the Strathmore Rockies and Edmonton Chimos at their meeting in Minneapolis on August 19, 2011. The president of the WWHL also stepped down at that time. New board members were elected and the league began a series of monthly board meetings to develop their 2011-12 season and their strategic plan as sanctioned by Hockey Alberta. In 2012, the relations between the LCHF and the WWHL tightened: the director-manager of the Minnesota Whitecaps accused the Canadian Women's Hockey League of deliberately sabotaging possible participation of Whitecaps in the next Clarkson Cup tournament. Minnesota Whitecaps cry foul on exclusion from Canadian Women's Hockey League As of 2015, the league website is defunct. The Minnesota Whitecaps continue to be an active team as part of the National Women's Hockey League, and the Manitoba Maple Leafs were active as late as 2014. ==Championship== The champion of the WWHL is given the WWHL Champions cup.
