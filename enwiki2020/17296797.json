The Liberty town name was taken from the nearby Liberty School District. Given the district's proximity to Mounds, Oklahoma on the west side of US-75, a former school superintendent referred to the district as \u201cLiberty-Mounds\u201d to distinguish it from another Liberty school district near Morris in Okmulgee County. So the highway signs reference the school, although both the town and the school district are actually named Liberty. ==References== ==Further reading== *Fact Sheet, Liberty town, Oklahoma.
