    "text": "Linfield Football Club is a professional football club based in Belfast, Northern Ireland, which plays in the NIFL Premiership \u2013 the highest level of the Northern Ireland Football League. The club was founded in 1886 as Linfield Athletic Club and in 1905 moved into their current home of Windsor Park, which is also the home of the Northern Ireland national team. The club's badge displays Windsor Castle, in reference to the ground's namesake. Historically, Linfield's main rival has been Glentoran with whom they contest the Big Two derby. This rivalry traditionally includes a league derby played on Boxing Day each year, which usually attracts the largest league attendance of the season. Linfield's average league home attendance is approximately 2,500,http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn/avenir.htm the highest in the division and more than double the league's overall average of about 1,000. The club, nicknamed the Blues, are managed by former Northern Ireland international and current all-time NI record goalscorer, David Healy. Healy was appointed on 14 October 2015 to succeed Warren Feeney, who had resigned in order to become assistant manager of Newport County. Linfield holds several domestic records and two world records. The club was inaugural winners and one of the eight founding members of the Irish League in 1890, and is one of only three clubs (along with Glentoran and Cliftonville) to have remained in the top division continuously. Linfield has won 54 league championships to date - more than twice as many titles as any other Northern Irish club, and shares the world record for the most top division league titles won by any club with Rangers, who have won 54 Scottish titles. In 1922, Linfield completed a clean sweep of all seven available trophies in a season, and in 2006 repeated the feat by winning all four available domestic trophies, to achieve a domestic quadruple. They have also won three domestic trebles along with a world record 24 domestic doubles. The club has lifted the Irish Cup a record 43 times, the League Cup a record ten times, and has won 4 all- Ireland competitions \\- the 1960\u201361 North-South Cup, 1970\u201371 Blaxnit Cup, 1980\u201381 Tyler Cup and the 2005 Setanta Cup. The club has never won a European trophy, but did reach the quarter-finals of the 1966\u201367 European Cup. ==History== ===Formation and early years (1886\u20131918)=== The club was founded in March 1886 in an area of south Belfast known as Sandy Row by workers at the Ulster Spinning Company's Linfield Mill. Originally known as Linfield Athletic Club, the team played on ground owned by the company at the back of the mill known as the Meadow. Initially, it was planned to have a rule in place to limit membership of the club to employees of the mill only. However, this was quickly changed to allow for the strongest team possible, with six of the club's first eleven being non-employees. Credited with originating the passing game in Ireland, where a dribbling based approach had been the norm until around 1890, for three seasons during the club's early years they competed in the English FA Cup. In the 1888\u201389 qualifying rounds they defeated Ulster and Bolton Wanderers to reach the fourth qualifying round, where they faced Cliftonville. After two draws, they won 7\u20130 in the second replay, which was played on 25 December 1888. This is notable for being the only FA Cup match ever to be played on Christmas Day. This victory meant they qualified for the first round proper for the first and only time, where they were drawn to face Nottingham Forest in what would turn out to be a controversial tie. Linfield had earned an impressive 2\u20132 draw in Nottingham, which meant a replay back in Belfast. In an apparent cup upset, Linfield then defeated Forest 3\u20131 at the Ulster Cricket Ground in Ballynafeigh, with the large crowd celebrating the fact that Linfield had progressed to the second round. However, a few days later the Belfast Telegraph revealed that the 'replay' had actually been played as nothing more than a friendly. Prior to the match, Linfield had conceded the tie after discovering that they had inadvertently fielded an ineligible player, William Johnston, in the first match. Officials from both clubs had agreed to keep this information a secret from the players and the public in order to play the match as planned. In any case, Linfield would have been unlikely to have played any further part in the cup, as the costs of travelling to Kent to play the second round tie against Chatham at an open ground with no gate money would have been prohibitive. Linfield made their final FA Cup appearance during the 1890\u201391 first qualifying round, being defeated 5\u20134 by Nantwich. This was the last season in which Irish clubs competed in the competition. Success on the field meant that the club had to accommodate bigger crowds, so this brought about a move to Ulsterville Avenue in 1889. In 1890, Bob Milne signed for the club from the Gordon Highlanders. The Scot would soon become a key member of the team, helping the Blues to lift the Irish Cup at the young age of 20. The club stayed at Ulsterville for five years before housing development on the ground in 1894 meant that the club had to move on once again. Between 1894 and 1897, Linfield played all of their home games at opponents' grounds until the president of the club, Robert Gibson \u2013 who had donated the Gibson Cup trophy to the Irish League for the championship \u2013 along with other club members eventually secured a ground lease at Myrtlefield in the Balmoral area of the city. However, this was another temporary home. The club stayed here until 1905, when they moved into Windsor Park. The club's first silverware at Windsor arrived in the 1906\u201307 season, with the club lifting both the league title and the County Antrim Shield. This would be the first of a trio of league titles, with the 1907\u201308 and 1908\u201309 league titles to follow. In 1910, team captain Bob Milne left the club with a legacy as one of Linfield's best ever players. He had amassed nine Irish Cups, eight league titles, and had earned 27 international caps for the Ireland national team during his time at the club. Another Scottish player, Marshall McEwan, joined the club in 1911 at the age of 26. He had previously played for English clubs Blackpool, Bolton Wanderers and Chelsea. McEwan is perhaps best remembered for his performance in the 1913 Irish Cup final, described by some fans as the best in years. McEwan retired in 1916, but remained in Belfast and later opened several businesses in the city. In 1915, the Irish League was suspended as a result of the First World War. In its place, a temporary unofficial league known as the Belfast & District League was set up and ran for four seasons until the return of the Irish League in 1919. As this was an unofficial competition, any titles during this time are not counted as Irish League Championships. Linfield won this competition twice, in 1915\u201316 along with the Irish Cup, and in 1917\u201318. The team that lifted an unprecedented seven trophies in the 1921\u201322 season. ===Two seven-trophy seasons (1921\u201322 & 1961\u201362)=== Newcastle United legend Jackie Milburn. In the 1921\u201322 season, the club achieved a clean sweep of all the domestic competitions they entered \u2013 the Irish League, Irish Cup, County Antrim Shield, Alhambra Cup, Belfast Charity Cup, Gold Cup and the City Cup. The club followed this up the next season by winning a treble including the Irish League, Irish Cup and County Antrim Shield in 1922\u201323. In 1927, Joe Bambrick signed for the Blues, and would become one of the club's all-time top goal scorers. In the 1929\u201330 season, Bambrick scored a remarkable 94 goals \u2013 a record that surprisingly stood for only one season, until Glentoran's Fred Roberts scored an incredible 96 goals during the following campaign. In 1930, Bambrick scored six goals in one game for Ireland \u2013 a 7\u20130 win over Wales. The 1931\u201332, 1933\u201334 and 1934\u201335 league titles followed for Linfield, before Bambrick left the club to join Chelsea in 1935 having scored 286 league goals in just 183 games for Linfield \u2013 a remarkable ratio of 1.56 goals per game. The Irish League was once again suspended in 1940 as a result of the Second World War, with another temporary unofficial league set up which was called the Northern Regional League. Linfield won this league three times \u2013 in 1942\u201343, 1944\u201345 and 1945\u201346. This league ran for seven seasons until the return of the Irish League once again in 1947. In 1957, Jackie Milburn famously signed for the Blues as player- manager from Newcastle United, and won the Ulster Footballer of the Year award for his performances during his first season at the club. Milburn's presence dramatically increased average crowds at matches, with the Belfast Telegraph calling it the \"signing of the century\". Milburn is famous for scoring Linfield's first ever goals in European competition. In September 1959, he scored both goals against IFK G\u00f6teborg in a 2\u20131 Linfield win at Windsor Park in the first leg of the 1959\u201360 European Cup preliminary round tie \u2013 the club's European debut. Milburn was also the Irish league's top goal scorer on two occasions before leaving the club in 1960 to join Yiewsley. In 1962, forty years after Linfield's remarkable seven-trophy season, the club repeated the feat in the 1961\u201362 season under manager Isaac McDowell. They won another seven-trophy haul including the Irish League, Irish Cup, County Antrim Shield, Gold Cup, City Cup and the Ulster Cup. They also won the North-South Cup final that season, but it was actually the conclusion of the 1960\u201361 competition. Fixture congestion had meant that the final could not be played before the end of the previous season, so it was rescheduled to take place during the 1961\u201362 season. A commemorative event was held in April 2012, celebrating the 90th and 50th anniversaries of the 1921\u201322 and 1961\u201362 seven-trophy-winning teams. ===Roy Coyle's 31-trophy haul (1975\u20131990)=== Following a spell in England playing for Sheffield Wednesday and Grimsby Town, Roy Coyle joined the club as player-manager, taking over the reins from outgoing manager Billy Campbell. After a tough start to his managerial career at the club, Coyle went on to become the most successful Linfield manager in history, winning numerous trophies during his time at Windsor Park. His first season in charge was without silverware. In fact, having been Irish Cup runners-up the previous season when Coleraine defeated the Blues 1\u20130 after two replays, Linfield suffered one of the biggest upsets in Northern Irish football history when B Division club Carrick Rangers defeated the Blues 2\u20131 in the 1975\u201376 Irish Cup final on 10 April 1976. This giant-killing act in which a junior club defeated a senior club in the Irish Cup final had only happened twice before in the cup's history, and not since 1955. The club stuck by Coyle however, and it was not long before he brought silverware to the club. His first honour arrived in the 1976\u201377 season in the form of the County Antrim Shield. However, the Blues suffered defeat in the Irish Cup final for the third consecutive season when they lost 4\u20131 against Coleraine. The 1977\u201378 season saw the club win an Irish League, Irish Cup and Ulster Cup treble. Runners-up in the last three Irish Cup finals, this time they were not to be denied. A 3\u20131 victory over Ballymena United secured the club's third trophy of the season. Coyle retired from playing duties in 1980, but continued as manager. In 1982, future manager David Jeffrey joined the club following a stint in the Manchester United youth team and played for Coyle under many of his trophy successes, captaining the side for much of that time. One of Coyle's biggest achievements as manager was leading the club to six consecutive league titles between 1981\u201382 and 1986\u201387, equalling the record for the most consecutive titles which was set by Belfast Celtic in 1947\u201348. 1986 was the year that Noel Bailie began what would turn out to be a 25-year career at the club. Although a defender for most of that time, Bailie began as a left midfielder. Coyle's final trophy as Linfield manager was the Gold Cup in 1989\u201390. During his 15 years at the club he had amassed 10 League titles, 3 Irish Cups, 7 Gold Cups, 4 Ulster Cups, 5 County Antrim Shields, the Irish League Cup, and the Tyler Cup \u2013 31 major honours in total. Coyle left the club in April 1990. Eric Bowyer was appointed as Coyle's replacement, but it was a relatively unsuccessful reign that only lasted for two years until he was sacked in 1992, with David Jeffrey also leaving the club that year to join Ards. Next into the managerial hot seat was Trevor Anderson, who brought more silverware to the club during his five years in charge between 1992 and 1997, including 2 Irish League titles and 2 Irish Cups. After retiring as a player in 1996 following a one-year spell at Larne, David Jeffrey returned to the club as Anderson's assistant manager. This partnership lasted until Anderson resigned on the morning of 4 January 1997. Anderson later became Director of Football at Newry Town. David Jeffrey was Linfield manager for between January 1997 and April 2014, winning a record- equalling 31 trophies during that time. ===The David Jeffrey years (1997\u20132014)=== Jeffrey took charge of the team in a caretaker capacity for a league match against Portadown that afternoon, and remained as caretaker manager for the following match against Ballyclare Comrades in the Floodlit Cup on 7 January. He was officially appointed as manager on a permanent basis on 8 January 1997. In his first full season in charge he led the club to three trophies \u2013 the League Cup, County Antrim Shield, and Floodlit Cup \u2013 and narrowly missed out on the league title to champions Cliftonville by four points. Jeffrey won his first league title as manager in the 1999\u20132000 season however, along with a third consecutive League Cup triumph. The Blues retained the league title the following season, and also won the Charity Shield and the County Antrim Shield. The 2001\u201302 season saw the club win a cup double, lifting both the Irish Cup and the League Cup. In 2005, the inauguration of the Setanta Cup meant the return of an all-Ireland cup competition for the first time since 1980. The Blues qualified as league champions, but started the competition poorly \u2013 losing 2\u20131 away to Longford Town. However, they recovered to eventually reach the final against Shelbourne, and although the Blues were major underdogs going into the match against professional League of Ireland opposition, they overcame the odds with a 2-0 scoreline to become inaugural winners of the competition. Incidentally, Linfield were in fact the reigning all-Ireland champions at the time, having won the final staging of the Tyler Cup in 1980 before the competition was discontinued. The 2005\u201306 season was the most successful of Jeffrey's tenure, with the Blues achieving a clean sweep of all four domestic competitions; the Irish Premier League, Irish Cup, Irish League Cup, and County Antrim Shield. However, they did fail to retain the Setanta Cup as defending champions when they were narrowly beaten 1\u20130 at Windsor Park in the semi-finals by eventual winners, Drogheda United. In April 2010, former captain Noel Bailie made his 1,000th appearance for the club when he played in a 0\u20130 draw against Crusaders in the league. A few days later, Linfield won their 49th league title after a 1\u20130 home win against Cliftonville. The following year, a landmark 50th league title arrived during the club's 125th anniversary year. Bailie retired from football in April 2011 at the age of 40, after making 1,013 appearances for the club in all competitions since making his debut against Ballymena United in March 1989. Linfield subsequently retired the number 11 shirt in his honour. In the 2011\u201312 season, Linfield won a league and cup double for the third consecutive season and the sixth time in seven seasons \u2013 a record 51st league title, 42nd Irish Cup win, and 23rd double overall. Linfield and Crusaders lining up before the 2013\u201314 County Antrim Shield final. Linfield would go on to win the Shield 4\u20131 on penalties. It was David Jeffrey's final trophy as Linfield manager. The 2012\u201313 season was undoubtedly a low ebb for the club under Jeffrey's reign. The Blues were off the pace for most of the league campaign \u2013 their season encapsulated in a 3\u20131 home defeat by newly promoted Ballinamallard United in October 2012. Cliftonville were the eventual champions, securing their fourth league title after defeating Linfield 3\u20132 at Solitude on 13 April 2013. Crusaders secured the runners-up place, leaving the Blues in third place \u2013 a distant 29 points behind the champions. The club went out of the 2013 Setanta Sports Cup after a heavy aggregate defeat in the quarter-finals, went out of the League Cup at the semi-final stage, and exited the Irish Cup in the fifth round after a replay. The club's first Irish Cup defeat in four years was also the first time in 16 years they had lost their opening tie of the competition. When the 2014 Setanta Sports Cup was confirmed in December 2013, the club opted not to enter the competition, citing inconvenient fixture scheduling, reduced prize money, and the difficulties faced for Linfield supporters to attend away games as the reasons behind their withdrawal. At the time, the club did not rule out future participation, however they would never compete in the competition again. League champions Cliftonville also withdrew from the competition for similar reasons, with the next two highest placed sides from the previous season's league table (Ballinamallard United and Coleraine) being drafted in as replacements. In February 2014, Jeffrey announced that he would be stepping down at the end of the 2013\u201314 season, bringing an end to his trophy-laden reign after 17 years. In March 2014, the Blues lifted the County Antrim Shield for a record 43rd time by defeating Crusaders 4\u20131 on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw after extra time in the final. This was a significant milestone for Jeffrey \u2013 his 31st and last trophy as Linfield manager, equalling Roy Coyle's record. Jeffrey still had the opportunity to win a record-breaking 32nd trophy as manager in the form of the 2013\u201314 league title. However, despite topping the league table for much of the season, the Blues had to settle for the runners-up spot, six points behind champions Cliftonville. Jeffrey's reign came to a winning end with a 5\u20132 victory over Glenavon on the final day of the 2013\u201314 league season. ===Feeney & Healy (2014\u2013present)=== Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney succeeded Jeffrey as Linfield manager. Feeney had been player-assistant manager at English Conference Premier side Salisbury City at the time of his appointment. His cousin, Lee Feeney, played for Linfield in two spells between 1997\u20131999 and 2002\u20132003. Former Blackburn Rovers player, Andy Todd, was appointed as Feeney's assistant. Feeney's only full season in charge of the club ended without silverware. The Blues challenged for the league title for most of the season, but ultimately had to settle for the runners-up spot for the second successive season, behind champions Crusaders. One positive for the season was the team's record in the four \"Big Two\" league derbies against Glentoran, of which the Blues won three and drew the other. The lowest point of the season for the team was undoubtedly a shock 1\u20130 loss against second-tier side Ballyclare Comrades in the second round of the 2014\u201315 League Cup, while their 2014\u201315 Irish Cup campaign ended when they were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 3\u20132 to eventual runners-up Portadown. In May 2015, the Blues were invited to compete in the Setanta Sports Cup scheduled to take place in June 2015. The club declined once again, with inconvenient fixture scheduling still remaining a concern. The competition was ultimately cancelled, when suitable fixture dates could not be agreed upon. With the Blues top of the table after 10 games of the 2015\u201316 NIFL Premiership season, Feeney's reign came to an end in October 2015, when he resigned to become assistant manager (and subsequently the manager) of English Football League Two side Newport County. Former Northern Ireland striker and the country's all-time record international goalscorer David Healy was appointed as Feeney's successor, with Andy Todd staying on as Healy's assistant manager. However, in January 2016 Todd also departed the club to join Newport County and reunite with Warren Feeney, who had subsequently been promoted to County's manager following the departure of John Sheridan. Todd once again became Feeney's assistant manager. ==Stadium== Windsor Park, the club's home since 1905. Since 1905, Windsor Park in south Belfast has been Linfield's home ground. In the initial years after the club was formed in 1886, Linfield had to change grounds several times for various reasons such as housing development. The numerous ground changes and the club's desire to have a permanent home with which to build an identity resulted in the purchase of a piece of land known as the 'bog meadows' just off lower Windsor Avenue on 1 October 1904. Later known as Windsor Park, this became the club's permanent home as well as the venue for international matches. The first game at Windsor took place on 29 August 1905, with Linfield playing out a 0\u20130 draw against Distillery in a friendly match arranged to officially commemorate the opening of the stadium. The first competitive game played at the stadium took place just a few days later on 2 September 1905, and ended with a 1\u20130 win for Linfield over Glentoran \u2013 the other half of the \"Big Two\" Belfast teams \u2013 though Belfast Celtic were Linfield's main rivals at the time. Windsor Park is the largest Association football stadium in Northern Ireland, with Glentoran's ground, the Oval, being the next largest. The governing body of Northern Irish football, the Irish Football Association, manages the stadium, while Linfield retains ownership of the land. In 2012, Linfield and the IFA were in talks to agree a new 51-year contract for the use of Windsor Park. The club would receive an annual payment as rent for the IFA to use the ground for the Northern Ireland national football team, but would no longer receive 15% of the ticket sales, TV rights, and commercial rights from international matches as they did under the old agreement. The 51-year agreement took effect from May 2014, with Linfield receiving an annual payment of \u00a3214,000 - subject to review (being adjusted for inflation etc.) every four years. The contract will expire in 2065. In 2010, UEFA provided \u20ac500,000 towards substantial refurbishment of the stadium, to increase capacity and improve safety. The following year, the Northern Ireland Executive allocated \u00a3138 million for a major programme of stadium redevelopment throughout Northern Ireland, with \u00a328 million allocated to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. In June 2012, further details of the stadium's redevelopment were released. The plan was to redevelop Windsor Park into an 18,000 all-seater stadium with a series of phased works originally intended to begin in the middle of 2013. The redevelopment would include the demolition of the existing East and South Stand structures, to be replaced by new purpose built stands that would partially enclose the stadium; complete renovation of the existing North and West Stands; and construction of both new conferencing facilities and a new headquarters facility for the IFA. In February 2013, planning permission for the redevelopment was granted. The cost of the project was estimated to be around \u00a329.2 million, of which \u00a325.2 million would come from government funding. It was initially planned for the work to begin in September 2013. Two months later however, Crusaders began legal proceedings against the redevelopment. The club called for the process to be judicially reviewed, believing it to be against European Union competition laws and also a form of State aid towards Linfield. They, along with other Irish League clubs, felt that this gives Linfield an unfair advantage by allowing them to offer more attractive wages and have a larger squad than all of the other clubs. When Crusaders played Linfield at Windsor Park at the end of April, their club officials were allegedly informed that they would not be welcome in the directors box or the boardroom during the game \u2013 an apparent reaction to Crusaders' legal challenge of the stadium redevelopment. In a hearing that took place on 22 May 2013, Crusaders' request was granted. It was ruled that it was a possibility for the redevelopment to be classed as state aid towards Linfield. The aspect of the challenge concerning competition law however, was dismissed. In July 2013, Crusaders agreed to a possible settlement brought forward by the judicial review. The details of the settlement were not made public, but Crusaders said that it had the \"potential to benefit the entirety of the football family\". In September 2013, sports minister Car\u00e1l N\u00ed Chuil\u00edn said that she was still committed to making sure the redevelopment went ahead as scheduled, after previously stating that she would not sign off on the funding until the IFA resolved \"governance issues\" surrounding David Martin's return to the role of deputy president. In December 2013, three months after the work was originally scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on \u00a331 million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013\u201314 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known if that was directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, the West Stand was demolished and rebuilt. The redevelopment was completed in October 2016, with an official capacity of 18,614. ==Supporters and rivalry== ===Big Two rivalry=== Linfield's main rivals are Glentoran from east Belfast \u2013 a rivalry which is commonly referred to as the Big Two. However, this term did not always refer to Linfield and Glentoran; up until 1949, the Big Two consisted of Linfield and Belfast Celtic, as they had traditionally been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football to that point. However, after Belfast Celtic withdrew from the league in 1949, Glentoran established themselves as Linfield's biggest rivals. The earliest recorded match between the two clubs was played on 1 October 1887 \u2013 just over a year after Linfield's formation. A friendly match played at King's Field, Westbourne in Ballymacarrett was won 3\u20131 by Linfield (then known as Linfield Athletic). In 1890, the two teams played each other competitively for the first time, during the inaugural Irish League season. Linfield won 7\u20130 at Musgrave Park on 18 October, and 6\u20130 at Ulsterville Avenue on 21 March 1891. The first meeting at the Oval took place on 8 October 1892, and the first meeting at Windsor Park took place 13 years later on 2 September 1905. During the second World War in 1941, the Oval \u2013 including most of Glentoran's assets \u2013 was severely damaged in a German aerial bombing raid on the nearby Harland & Wolff shipyard. Glentoran approached Distillery F.C to play at Grosvenor Park, which they did until the Oval was rebuilt with help from other clubs. During this time, Glentoran considered resigning from senior football to become a junior club, but after borrowing kits from Distillery and Crusaders they continued to compete at Grosvenor until 1949. Out of 14 league games at Grosvenor Park however, they were only victorious over Linfield on one occasion. Traditionally, the two clubs play each other in the league on Boxing Day every year, with the match usually attracting the biggest league attendance of the season. However, in 2009 the match was moved to a new date by the Irish Football Association due to crowd trouble at Windsor Park. The Boxing Day match returned in 2011, and usually alternates venues between the Oval and Windsor Park each year. ===Trophy dominance=== Linfield and Glentoran have been the two most successful clubs in Northern Irish football to date, regularly being the two main contenders for the major domestic honours. They have won more league titles, Irish Cups, and League Cups than any other clubs. Linfield hold the record for the most League titles (54), Irish Cups (43), and League Cups (10). In comparison, Glentoran have won 23 league titles, 23 Irish Cups, and 7 League Cups. Almost half (47.1%) of the 140 Irish Cup competitions to date have been won by one of the two clubs, with at least one of the clubs reaching the final on 91 occasions (65% of all finals), winning the cup a combined 66 times. Of those 91 finals, the two clubs have met in 15 of them \u2013 making it the most common final. Linfield have won eight of the head-to-head final meetings compared to Glentoran's seven wins, with the most recent meeting between the two clubs in the final occurring in 2006, when Linfield won 2\u20131 to lift the Cup for the 37th time. Almost two-thirds (64.7%) of all Irish League titles have been won by one of the Big Two. Of the 119 completed league seasons, the title has been won by either club on 77 occasions. The duo also make up two of the three clubs that have appeared in every season of the Irish League since its inception in 1890; the other club being Cliftonville. Up to and including the 2019\u201320 season, the two clubs have played each other 273 times in the Irish League since its formation in 1890 \u2013 excluding unofficial wartime results between 1915 and 1919 (first World War) and 1940\u20131947 (second World War). Linfield have won 125 of the meetings, with 74 Glentoran victories and 74 drawn matches. Linfield's record victory over their rivals is 8\u20130. This occurred on 21 November 1891, during the 1891\u201392 Irish League season. Linfield's record post-war win over Glentoran in all competitions is by a six-goal margin \u2013 a 7\u20131 win over the Glens at Grosvenor Park in the 1961\u201362 North-South Cup, and a 6\u20130 victory at Windsor Park in the 2006 Setanta Sports Cup group stage. Since 2009, the rivalry has not been as intense as it once was, with the Big Two's domination of the domestic game decreasing as competitiveness across the league has improved. This is partly due to the resurgence of North Belfast derby rivals Cliftonville and Crusaders, and to a lesser extent Coleraine and Glenavon. In 2013, Cliftonville became the first club other than Linfield or Glentoran to lift the league title since Portadown did so in 2002. In 2014, Cliftonville went on to retain the title for the first time in the club's history, with Crusaders then winning the 2014\u201315 title in convincing fashion, finishing 10 points ahead of runners-up Linfield. During this time, Glentoran lifted the Irish Cup in 2013, 2015 and 2020, however the club has gone 11 years without a league title, winning only three titles since the turn of the 21st century; in 2002\u201303, 2004\u201305 and 2008\u201309. Since then, they have finished as low as ninth place in the 2016\u201317 season. The last season in which the two clubs finished as champions and runners-up in either order was 2008\u201309, and they have not met in a major domestic cup final since 2006, when they contested both the Irish Cup and the League Cup finals. the Oval in February 2014. Linfield won the match 1\u20130. ===Sectarianism and violence=== Linfield are regarded as a 'Protestant club' and draw the vast majority of their support from one side of the community. However, the squad itself is diverse. The club has also been regarded as sectarian in the past, both in respect of its alleged employment policy and of the repeated behaviour of its fans. This sectarian reputation is partly the result of the actions of fans who have a history of anti-Catholic behaviour ranging from sectarian chanting on the terraces to outright physical violence. Part of the problem has been attributed to Windsor Park's location in a part of Belfast that was once predominantly Protestant. A relatively small number of local Catholics played for the club during the Troubles, which led to a widespread accusation that the club held a historical policy of not signing Catholic players. However, the existence of such a policy has been continually refuted: Sectarian tensions have long been a cause of conflict at football matches in Northern Ireland since the 1920s, and crowd trouble occasionally marred games involving Linfield throughout the twentieth century. One of the most notable such instances occurred in 1948, at a Boxing Day match between Linfield and Belfast Celtic (a team whose support was largely composed of Catholics and Irish nationalists). Immediately following a 1\u20131 draw in which Linfield scored in the last minute, there was a pitch invasion by Linfield supporters. In the ensuing violence, three Belfast Celtic players were seriously injured, including Protestant striker Jimmy Jones, who was left unconscious and suffered a broken leg. Belfast Celtic subsequently withdrew from the league in protest at the end of the 1948\u201349 season. In the 1979\u201380 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face Dundalk from the Republic of Ireland. In the first leg, which was played in Dundalk and ended in a 1\u20131 draw, crowd disturbance prompted UEFA to switch the second leg to the Haarlem Stadion, Netherlands. Linfield were held almost entirely accountable for the events, and were forced to pay Dundalk's costs to travel to the Netherlands as well as an additional \u00a35,000 for damage sustained to Oriel Park. Dundalk were fined \u00a3870 for providing insufficient security at the match. Dundalk eventually won the match 2\u20130 to progress 3\u20131 on aggregate. In the 1987\u201388 campaign, Linfield's home game against Lillestr\u00f8m was marred by missile throwing, resulting in UEFA sanctions which meant that the club had to play their next two home games in European competitions at Welsh club Wrexham in 1988\u201389 and 1989\u201390. A 1997 match against Coleraine was abandoned when Linfield fans hurled bottles onto the pitch after two Linfield players were sent off. In May 2005 there were disturbances in Dublin at the Setanta Cup final between Linfield and Shelbourne. In the same month, Linfield fans were banned from travelling to the Oval for a match against Glentoran, allegedly as a result of disturbances involving both sets of fans the previous month. However, Glentoran denied this was the reason behind the ban, citing health and safety regulations that forced them to close the away stand. In 2008, three Linfield fans were charged in a Dublin court with public order offences at a Setanta Cup match against St Patrick's Athletic, but were released. The management of Linfield has continually attempted to reverse the stigma of negative press attached to the club. The club has moved forward in co- operation with the Irish Football Association, which has launched a campaign called \"Give sectarianism the boot.\" It assisted a local Camogie team who needed space to train in 2005, and also built links with the Gaelic Athletic Association which has traditionally had little support from the Protestant community in Northern Ireland. In 2006 FIFA officially commended Linfield for their anti-racism initiatives. A play dealing with the conflict between Linfield and Belfast Celtic, Lish and Gerry at the Shrine, was staged by the IFA at Windsor Park in October 2010, with the co-operation of the Linfield management. Since 2008, the number of incidents has significantly decreased. However, in February 2014, Linfield were fined \u00a33,000 and Cliftonville were fined \u00a33,250 by the IFA following sectarian chanting from sections of both sets of supporters during a County Antrim Shield semi-final at Windsor Park in October 2013. Cliftonville's fine of an extra \u00a3250 came as a result of their fans causing a big bang during the game. Both clubs criticised the decision, and expressed their intent to appeal against the fines. In April 2014, the punishments were rescinded on appeal. There was also crowd trouble at a league fixture between the clubs at Windsor Park in March 2014, with reports of missiles being thrown after the game. The Northern Ireland Football League condemned the actions of a \"small minority\" of supporters. In May 2014, Linfield were fined \u00a31,200 by the Irish Football Association over the singing of sectarian songs by supporters, ruling that Linfield fans had been guilty of breaching the code of conduct during a league game at Coleraine.Linfield fined \u00a31,200 by IFA over sectarian songs BBC News, 14 May 2014 In a Champions League qualifier match on 14 July 2017, some Linfield supporters threw bottles and coins at Celtic players and sang sectarian songs throughout the game.http://m.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/linfield-face- penalties-after-yobs-ruin-historic-night-and-attack-celtic-players-with- bottles-and-coins-35933394.html ==European record== As Northern Ireland's most dominant club side, Linfield have been regular campaigners in European football. The club first participated in European competition in 1959 against G\u00f6teborg in the 1959\u201360 European Cup. In the first round of the 1961\u201362 European Cup, Linfield were drawn to face an East German team, Vorw\u00e4rts. The away leg was played, which Linfield lost 3\u20130. However, Vorw\u00e4rts were denied visas to enter the UK to play the second leg, and (similarly to Glenavon the previous season) travelling to play the second leg in a neutral country was not financially viable for Linfield. They were therefore forced to withdraw from the competition. Linfield's most notable achievement in European competition to date is reaching the quarter-finals of the 1966\u201367 European Cup. After beating Aris of Luxembourg and V\u00e5lerenga of Norway they faced CSKA Red Flag of Bulgaria in the last eight. This resulted in a 2\u20132 draw at home and 1\u20130 defeat away. In the 1984\u201385 season, after overcoming Shamrock Rovers on away goals (the first and so far only series of meetings between the two Irish superpowers outside all-Ireland tournaments), Linfield faced eventual semi-finalists Panathinaikos in the second round. After a 2\u20131 defeat in Greece, Linfield raced into a 3\u20130 lead at half-time in the second leg at Windsor Park. However, Panathinaikos staged a remarkable comeback in the second half to level the match at 3\u20133 and eliminate Linfield 5\u20134 on aggregate. The 1993\u201394 UEFA Champions League saw Linfield drawn with Dynamo Tbilisi of Georgia. After losing 3\u20132 on aggregate, they were later reinstated when the Georgian side were expelled from the competition for alleged match fixing and bribing officials. Linfield faced Copenhagen in the first round proper. They won the first leg 3\u20130, but lost the second leg 4\u20130 after extra time. This proved costly, as victory would have meant a financially lucrative tie against eventual champions A.C. Milan in the next round. The club then had to wait seven years to participate in the competition again, due to the format of the two European competitions being altered. The league's relatively low ranking in the UEFA coefficient system has meant that the club has entered in the early qualifying rounds of either the UEFA Champions League or the UEFA Cup/Europa League, with the Blues becoming the first Irish League side to reach the play-off round of the Europa League in 2019. In the 2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League, the Blues entered the competition in the first qualifying round, and defeated B36 T\u00f3rshavn 4\u20133 on penalties to progress to the second qualifying round, after both legs ended as 0\u20130 draws. This was the first time since the 1984\u201385 season (excluding their opponent's expulsion in 1993\u201394) that the club had won a tie in the competition. However, they were defeated 3\u20130 on aggregate in the next round by AEL Limassol. The 2013\u201314 UEFA Europa League campaign started in record-breaking fashion. In July 2013, the club won 2\u20130 away from home against \u00cdF Fuglafj\u00f8r\u00f0ur of the Faroe Islands in the first qualifying round. This was the Blues' first win in Europe since 2005, and their first away win in Europe since 1966, when they defeated V\u00e5lerenga 4\u20131 during their run to the quarter-finals of the 1966\u201367 European Cup. In the second leg at Windsor Park, the Blues won 3\u20130 to go through to the next round 5\u20130 on aggregate. This was the club's largest aggregate victory in a European tie since defeating Aris Bonnevoie 9\u20134 on aggregate in the first round of the 1966\u201367 European Cup. It was also the first time that a Northern Irish club had won both legs of a European tie in any competition. They followed this up in the next round by winning away from home again. Despite being massive underdogs for the tie, a 1\u20130 victory away to Xanthi of Greece made it three consecutive victories in Europe, without conceding a goal in the process \u2013 another first for the club. However, in the second leg at home they went down 2\u20131 after extra time, which eliminated them on the away goals rule. The following season, Linfield's first venture into Europe under new manager Warren Feeney was in the Faroe Islands against B36 T\u00f3rshavn in the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League first qualifying round, which was also Feeney's first competitive game in charge of the club. Linfield came out 2\u20131 victors with goals coming from Jamie Mulgrew and Michael Carvill. The return leg was played at Glenavon's ground, Mourneview Park, due to the redevelopment of Windsor Park. Linfield had to settle for a 1\u20131 draw, but that was enough to secure passage into the second qualifying round for the second successive season, where they were drawn to face AIK from Sweden. An 87th-minute Andrew Waterworth goal in the home leg at Mourneview Park ensured a 1\u20130 win for Linfield in their 100th competitive European match since their debut in 1959. However, the Blues fell to a 2\u20130 defeat in the away leg, which meant they were eliminated 2\u20131 on aggregate. Linfield playing against Allsvenskan side AIK in the second leg of the 2014\u201315 UEFA Europa League second qualifying round. The match was played at the Friends Arena, Solna on 24 July 2014. As 2018\u201319 NIFL Premiership champions, Linfield initially entered the 2019\u201320 UEFA Champions League first qualifying round, where they were drawn to face Rosenborg. In naming Charlie Allen to the final 25 man squad for this match, the Blues set a new record for the youngest UK player named to a final squad for a match in the Champions League. The Norwegian champions had eliminated the Blues from the competition back in the 2010\u201311 season, and again they proved to be too strong. A 6\u20130 aggregate defeat saw the Blues drop down into the UEFA Europa League second qualifying round Champions Path, where they faced Faroese champions HB T\u00f3rshavn \u2013 the fifth occasion since 2012 that they had faced Faroese opposition in Europe. A 3\u20132 win on aggregate secured a place in the third qualifying round of the Europa League for the first time, and indeed the third stage of any European competition since a 5\u20132 aggregate win over V\u00e5lerenga in November 1966. More history was made in the next round when the Blues faced Montenegro champions Sutjeska. A 2\u20131 win in the away leg was followed up with a 3\u20132 win in the second leg at Windsor Park, with the Blues winning 5\u20133 on aggregate to become the first Irish League side to reach the play-off round of the Europa League. It was only the second time that the club had won both legs of a European tie \u2013 the first being in 2013 against \u00cdF. Additionally, it was only the second time that the club had ever progressed through back-to-back rounds in Europe, again the first time since November 1966. In the play-off round, the Blues were drawn to face Azerbaijan champions Qaraba\u011f, with the winners qualifying for the Europa League group stage. ===Summary=== {| class=\"wikitable\"

In the early years after the club was formed in 1886, the team was selected by the club committee, a standard practice by football clubs at the time. Since then, 25 different men have held the position of Linfield first team coach/manager. However, only six have been appointed since Billy Campbell's departure in 1975. David Jeffrey holds the record for the longest reign as manager, having been in charge for 17 years and 16 weeks between 4 January 1997 and 26 April 2014. Jeffrey and Roy Coyle jointly hold the record for the most trophies won as manager, having led the club to 31 major honours each. Former Northern Ireland international Warren Feeney is the club's previous manager, having been appointed in May 2014. He resigned in October 2015 to become assistant manager of Newport County, with current manager David Healy appointed as his successor. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Dates !Name !Notes |- |1886\u2013? |Team Committee |A committee was responsible for the first team. |- |Unknown |Lincoln Hyde |Manager for at least the 1932\u201333 season, possibly for longer. |- |Unknown |Tommy Sloan | |- |1939\u20131940 |Billy McCleery |Resigned due to World War II, and concentrated on his Cricket career.

The character remains placid until the situation causes him inconvenience at which point he confronts the terrorists, hijackers etc., and while everyone else in the scene cowers in fear for their lives he responds to the demands of the villains with a catchphrase \"Are ye by f***!\" and then verbally scares them into surrender, thus saving the situation.\"Comedy sketch riles Linfield boss\", BBC, 19 February 2007 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Linfield FC Website * Linfield Statistics and Results at the Irish Football Club Project Category:Association football clubs established in 1886 Category:Association football clubs in Northern Ireland Category:NIFL Premiership clubs Category:Association football clubs in Belfast Category:1886 establishments in Ireland Category:Unrelegated association football clubs ",
