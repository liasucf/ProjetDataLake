He commissioned nearly 300 miniature portraits of Gilded Age socialites. ==Early life== Peter Mari\u00e9 was born in France in 1826. He was the fourth son in a family of nine children born to John Baptiste Mari\u00e9 (d. 1835), a ship merchant who traded with Mexico, and Leontine (n\u00e9e Arnaud) Mari\u00e9, who married in 1811. Among his many siblings was eldest brother, Camille Mari\u00e9 (father of Elizabeth La Montagne Pendleton), Joseph Mari\u00e9, the Vicomtesse de Bermingham, and another sister who married Ferdinand Thieriot of Leipzig, whose father had been Chamberlain to the King of Saxony. His maternal grandparents were General Joseph Louis Arnaud, a French planter and from Santo Domingo (now known as Haiti), and his American wife, Mary (n\u00e9e Nicholson) Arnaud. His paternal grandfather was a merchant from Cap Fran\u00e7ais, also in Santo Domingo. His grandfather was assassinated during a native uprising in Santo Domingo, at which point his grandmother brought Peter's mother and two aunts to New York City. His paternal grandfather was ma\u00eetre de port (harbour master) in Cap- Francais in the French West Indies who died in 1792 from an accidental drowning. ==Career== Miniature portrait of Antoinette Polk, Baroness de Charette, done by Katherine Arthur Behenna, now kept at the New York Historical Society. Mari\u00e9 worked for his father and as a banker until his retirement in 1865 at the end of the American Civil War. Upon his retirement, Mari\u00e9, \"a man of cultivated tastes who inherited a sufficient fortune to indulge them at a comparatively early age,\" became a socialite in New York. ===Miniature portraits=== Mari\u00e9 commissioned up to 300 miniature portraits of female socialites, many by Fernand Paillet, of the Gilded Age.Beauties of the Gilded Age: Peter Mari\u00e9's Miniatures of Society Women, New York Historical Society, November 11, 2011-September 09, 2012 These included Edith Minturn Stokes, Hope Goddard Iselin, Emeline Winthrop, Emily Post, Frances Cleveland, Maude Adams, Anna Hall Roosevelt, and many others.Emma Mustich, Hot chicks of the Gilded Age?, Salon, November 5, 2011Catalogue of the Gallery of Art of the New York Historical Society, 1915, pp. 121-138, via Project Gutenberg A collector of rare books, he also self-published Book of Beauty, a book featuring some miniatures of Gilded Age socialites.

More recently, it was exhibited at the New-York Historical Society from November 11, 2011 to September 9, 2012. ==Personal life== According to his obituary in The New York Times, \"It was the custom for men to marry young in the antebellum days, and Mr. Mari\u00e9 was one of the very few bachelors in town, who, although most gallant and most devoted to the fair sex, was content with his own lot, and who lived in a house of his own and entertained as a bachelor host.\" He hosted many society dinners from his residence at 48 West 19th Street and, later at, 6 East 37th Street in Manhattan and summered in Bar Harbor, Maine and Newport, Rhode Island. He died on January 13, 1903 at his residence, 6 East 37th Street, in Manhattan. His funeral took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral and he was buried at Calvary Cemetery in Woodside, Queens. Mari\u00e9's estate at the time of his death was valued at $1,568,201. ===Society life=== In February 1892, Mari\u00e9 was included in Ward McAllister's \"Four Hundred\", purported to be an index of New York's best families, published in The New York Times. Conveniently, 400 was the number of people that could fit into Mrs. Astor's ballroom. He first joined the Union Club of the City of New York, a private members' club in Manhattan, as early as 1854. He subsequently joined the Knickerbocker Club, the Grolier Club, the City Club of New York, the Tuxedo Club, and the Gridiron Club. Additionally, he was a member of the American Geographical Society, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Fine Arts Society. He made charitable contributions to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Academy of Design and the American Museum of Natural History. He served as the Vice President of the New York Institute for the Blind. He also donated to Catholic outreach to the poor in New York City, but did not publicize his goodwill. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1826 births Category:1903 deaths Category:People from Manhattan Category:American book and manuscript collectors Category:American socialites Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:American people of French descent Category:People included in New York Society's Four Hundred Category:19th- century philanthropists ",
