It was designated a Grade II* listed building on 20 June 1988. The church is of \"coursed sandstone rubble with ashlar dressings\". The nave has buttresses and \"clumsy\" pinnacles and ends in a \"blunt\" west tower. The interior is aisled and \"particularly impressive for its complete (nineteenth century) interior with the extremely unusual survival of all the fine boxes and other pews\". The churchyard contains the war graves of ten service personnel of World War I and seven of World War II.
