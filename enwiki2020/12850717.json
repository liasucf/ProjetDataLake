    "text": "Couple or Trouble (; lit. Fantasy Couple) is a 2006 South Korean television series loosely based on the 1987 Hollywood film Overboard. Starring Han Ye- seul and Oh Ji-ho, it aired on MBC from October 14 to December 3, 2006 on Saturdays and Sundays at 21:40 for 16 episodes. The romantic comedy series was popular in the ratings, and received recognition at the MBC Drama Awards. ==Plot== Anna Jo (Han Ye-seul) is a rude, spoiled, arrogant and impossible-to- please American-bred heiress. She returns to Korea only to continue being a controlling wife to her already cowardly husband, Billy Park (Kim Sung-min). When her yacht gets stuck for repairs, she hires local handyman Jang Chul-soo (Oh Ji-ho) to fix her shower, but when they have a heated spat over her dissatisfaction with his work and refusal to pay, she pushes him overboard and dunks his tools into the ocean right along with him. Later, after a quarrel with Billy that threatens to end their marriage, she herself gets drunkenly pitched overboard and falls victim to a bad case of amnesia. In the hospital, she ends up beside none other than Chul-soo, who's still recovering from his own swim in the ocean for his lost tools. Unknown to her, he's been raising his three orphaned nephews in their unkempt house and desperately needs a nanny. Taking advantage of her memory loss, he manages to convince her that she's his live-in girlfriend and renames her Na Sang-shil. But he didn't expect her spoiled selfishness to slowly turn into compassion. And he didn't expect to fall overboard again \u2014 this time, for her. ==Cast== ===Main characters=== *Han Ye-seul as Anna Jo / Na Sang-shil *Oh Ji-ho as Jang Chul- soo *Kim Sung-min as Billy Park *Park Han-byul as Oh Yoo-kyung ===Supporting characters=== *Kim Kwang-kyu as Department head Gong *Kim Jung-wook as Ha Deok-gu *Lee Mi-young as Oh Kye-joo *Jung Soo-young as Kang-ja *Lee Suk-min as Jang Joon-seok *Kim Tae-yoon as Jang Yoon-seok *Park Joon-mok as Jang Geun- seok *Lee Sang-yi as Shim Hyo-jung ==Awards and nominations== ; 2006 MBC Drama Awards * Drama of the Year * Excellence Award, Actress: Han Ye-seul * Popularity Award, Actress: Han Ye-seul * Popularity Award, Actor: Oh Ji-ho * Best Couple: Oh Ji-ho and Han Ye-seul * Nomination - Excellence Award, Actor: Oh Ji-ho ; 2007 43rd Baeksang Arts Awards * Popularity Award (TV): Han Ye-seul * Nomination - Best Actress (TV): Han Ye-seul * Nomination - Best New Director (TV): Kim Sang-ho * Nomination - Best Screenplay (TV): Hong Jung-eun, Hong Mi- ran ==Ratings== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! width=100 | Episode ! width=100 | Original broadcast date ! width=100 | Nilsen ! width=100 | TNS |- align=center | 1 || 2006.10.14. ||10.4% || 11.1% |- align=center | 2 || 2006.10.15. || 9.9% || 10.9% |- align=center | 3 || 2006.10.21. ||11.0% || 12.5% |- align=center | 4 || 2006.10.22. || 11.7% || 13.6% |- align=center | 5 || 2006-10-28 || 14.6% || 16.6% |- align=center | 6 || 2006-10-29 || 11.8% || 15.1% |- align=center | 7 || 2006-11-04 || 11.4% || 11.7% |- align=center | 8 || 2006-11-05 || 11.4% || 13.7% |- align=center | 9 || 2006-11-11 || 12.9% || 13.5% |- align=center | 10 || 2006-11-12 || 13.2% || 13.7% |- align=center | 11 || 2006-11-18 || - || 14.9% |- align=center | 12 || 2006-11-19 || 15.8% || 16.1% |- align=center | 13 || 2006-11-25 || 14.1% || 16.4% |- align=center | 14 || 2006-11-26 || 16.7% || 17.7% |- align=center | 15 || 2006-12-02 || 18.6% || 21.1% |- align=center | 16 || 2006-12-03 || || |- |- align=\"center\" sdaasd |} == References == == External links == *Couple or Trouble official MBC website * * Category:MBC TV television dramas Category:2006 South Korean television series debuts Category:2006 South Korean television series endings Category:Korean-language television shows Category:South Korean romantic comedy television series Category:Television shows written by the Hong sisters Category:Live action television shows based on films ",
