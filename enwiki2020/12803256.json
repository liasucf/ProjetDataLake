On Monday, October 1, 2001, Canal de las Estrellas started broadcasting El Manantial weekdays at 8:00pm, replacing Sin pecado concebido. The last episode was broadcast on Friday, February 8, 2002 with Entre el amor y el odio replacing it the following day. Adela Noriega and Mauricio Islas starred as protagonists, while Alejandro Tommasi, Karyme Lozano and Daniela Romo starred as antagonists. == Plot == In the village of San Andres, the rivalry between two families the Valdez and the Ramirez is centered on \"El Manantial\", a beautiful fountain of water that happens to bathe the small property of the Valdez and not the neighboring ranch, the rich and prosperous hacienda \"Piedras Grandes\", where the best cattle are raised and is property of the Ramirez. But the spring is not the real reason for the hatred between the families. Justo Ramirez, married to Margarita Insunza, had a relationship with Francisca Rivero, wife of his enemy and neighbor Rigoberto Valdez. This relationship, founded in the betrayal, will cause the utmost bitterness and the destruction between the two families. The Valdez have a beautiful daughter named Alfonsina, who was born in the same year as Alejandro, the son and heir of the Ramirez. Although they have grown separately with their souls full of prejudices against their respective families, the two cannot avoid feeling attracted to each other. Margarita will not permit this and so she tells her husband to make sure her son will never be together with Alfonsina so he could marry Barbara, her cousin's daughter. Justo rapes Alfonsina and she leaves along with her mom and her aunt. Five years later... Alfonsina is graduating from school and has a good life until her mother commits suicide because she found out she was deathly ill and could no longer live with the guilt of her lifestyle. Before dying, her mother confesses to Alfonsina that Justo Ramirez destroyed her life and after that Alfonsina vows revenge on the man who destroyed her family. She returns to San Andres and there she once again sees Alejandro who is now engaged to Barbara. Their love is still present in their hearts. They will have to fight for their love and see if they can be happy by the shores of El Manantial. == Cast == *Adela Noriega as Alfonsina \"Adriana\" Vald\u00e9z Rivero *Mauricio Islas as Alejandro Ram\u00edrez Insunza *Daniela Romo as Do\u00f1a Margarita Insunza de Ram\u00edrez *Alejandro Tommasi as Don Justo Ram\u00edrez *Olivia Bucio as Gertrudis Rivero *Karyme Lozano as B\u00e1rbara Luna Zaval *Sylvia Pasquel as Pilar Zaval de Luna *Raymundo Capetillo as Dr. \u00c1lvaro Luna Castillo *Patricia Navidad as Mar\u00eda Magdalena \"Malena\" Osuna Casta\u00f1eda *Jorge Poza as H\u00e9ctor Luna/H\u00e9ctor Ram\u00edrez Rivero *Manuel Ojeda as Father Salvador Vald\u00e9z *Azela Robinson as Francisca Rivero Vda. de Vald\u00e9z *C\u00e9sar \u00c9vora as Rigoberto Vald\u00e9z *Nuria Bages as Martha/Elo\u00edsa Casta\u00f1eda Vda. de Osuna *Sergio Reynoso as Ferm\u00edn Aguirre *Angelina Pel\u00e1ez as Altagracia Herrera de Osuna *Justo Mart\u00ednez as Melesio Osuna *Rafael Mercadente as Gilberto Morales *Gilberto de Anda as Joel Morales *Socorro Bonilla as Norma de Morales *Lorena Enr\u00edquez as Mar\u00eda Eugenia \"Maru\" Morales *Leonor Bonilla as Mirna Barraza *Socorro Avelar as Do\u00f1a Catalina \"Cata\" Sosa *Marga L\u00f3pez as Mother Superior *Marisol del Olmo as Mercedes *Luis Couturier as Carlos Portillo *Alejandro Arag\u00f3n as Hugo Portillo *Julio Monterde as Father Juan Rosario *Salim Rubiales as Javier Jim\u00e9nez *David Galindo as Cipriano Pe\u00f1a *Ricardo de Pascual as Obispo*Teo Tapia == Awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#b0c4de; !
