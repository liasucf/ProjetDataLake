The building is in private ownership and is in a very bad condition. == History == Evidence of a Jewish community in Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Jur dates from before 1529, when the Jews were expelled from the town. Settlement of individual Jewish families began again in the 17th century. The synagogue dates from the late 18th century and resembles a late Baroque rural mansion. In 1876 the building underwent some reconstruction. It stands in the former Jewish courtyard and was surrounded by other Jewish institutions. These were demolished by the current owner, who acquired the property after World War II. Today it is used for storage and is dilapited == Architecture == On the western side stands a doorway projection with vestibule and women's gallery above. Access to the gallery was through a covered staircase, attached next to it. The sanctuary (the men's prayer room) on the eastern side is a large rectangular hall, emphasised by three bays of windows in the Rundbogenstil. The Holy Ark stood in the centre of the long side, flanked by two wndows (also in Rundbogenstil) and a round window above. Today only an empty niche is visible. Originally the women's gallery projection opened into the hall. When the synagogue underwent a reconstruction in 1876, interioir walls were redecorated with Moorish ornaments and a new women's gallery was constructed. This is supported by cast-iron columns and runs on three sides of the sanctuary.Maro\u0161 Borsk\u00fd: Synagogue Architecture in Slovakia Towards Creating a Memorial Landscape of Lost Community Dissertation an der Hochschule f\u00fcr J\u00fcdische Studien Heidelberg 2005, Page 135.
