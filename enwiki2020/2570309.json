    "text": "The Santiago de Compostela Cathedral (Spanish and Galician: ) is part of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Santiago de Compostela and is an integral component of the Santiago de Compostela World Heritage Site in Galicia, Spain. The cathedral is the reputed burial place of Saint James the Great, the apostle of Jesus Christ. It is also one of the only three known churches in the world built over the tomb of an apostle of Jesus, the other two being St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City and St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica, Chennai in India. The cathedral has historically been a place of pilgrimage on the Way of St. James since the Early Middle Ages and marks the traditional end of the pilgrimage route. The building is a Romanesque structure, with later Gothic and Baroque additions. ==History== According to legend, the apostle Saint James the Great brought Christianity to the Iberian Peninsula. According to legend, this tomb was rediscovered in AD 814 by the hermit Pelagius, after he witnessed strange lights in the night sky. Bishop Theodomirus of Iria recognized this as a miracle and informed king Alfonso II of Asturias and Galicia (791\u2013842). The king ordered the construction of a chapel on the site. Legend has it that the king was the first pilgrim to this shrine. This was followed by the first church in AD 829 and then in AD 899 by a pre-Romanesque church, ordered by king Alfonso III of Le\u00f3n,Portela Silva 2003: p. 54 which caused the gradual development of this major place of pilgrimage.Garrido Torres 2000: p. 100 In 997 the early church was reduced to ashes by Al-Mansur Ibn Abi Aamir (938\u20131002), army commander of the caliph of C\u00f3rdoba. The Al- Andalus commander was accompanied on his raid by his vassal Christian lords, who received a share of the loot, while St James' tomb and relics were left undisturbed. The gates and the bells, carried by local Christian captives to C\u00f3rdoba, were added to the Aljama Mosque.Garrido Torres 2000: p. 101 When C\u00f3rdoba was taken by king Ferdinand III of Castile in 1236, these same gates and bells were then transported by Muslim captives to Toledo, to be inserted in the Cathedral of Saint Mary of Toledo. Construction of the present cathedral began in 1075 under the reign of Alfonso VI of Castile (1040\u20131109) and the patronage of bishop Diego Pel\u00e1ez. It was built according to the same plan as the monastic brick church of Saint Sernin in Toulouse, probably the greatest Romanesque edifice in France. It was built mostly in granite. Construction was halted several times and, according to the Liber Sancti Iacobi, the last stone was laid in 1122. But by then, the construction of the cathedral was certainly not finished. The cathedral was consecrated in 1211 in the presence of king Alfonso IX of Leon.Bravo Lozano 1999: p. 235 According to the Codex Calixtinus the architects were \"Bernard the elder, a wonderful master\", his assistant Robertus Galperinus, and, later possibly, \"Esteban, master of the cathedral works\". In the last stage \"Bernard, the younger\" was finishing the building, while Galperinus was in charge of the coordination. He also constructed a monumental fountain in front of the north portal in 1122. The city became an episcopal see in 1075 and the church its cathedral. Due to its growing importance as a place of pilgrimage, it was raised to an archiepiscopal see by pope Urban II in 1100. A university was added in 1495. The cathedral was expanded and embellished with additions in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. ==Exterior of the cathedral== Overview of the cathedral complex. Each of the fa\u00e7ades along with their adjoining squares constitute a large urban square. The Baroque fa\u00e7ade of the Praza do Obradoiro square was completed by Fernando de Casas Novoa in 1740. Also in baroque style is the Acibechar\u00eda fa\u00e7ade by Ferro Caaveiro and Fern\u00e1ndez Sarela, later modified by Ventura Rodr\u00edguez. The Pratar\u00edas fa\u00e7ade, built by the Master Esteban in 1103, and most importantly the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria, an early work of Romanesque sculpture, were completed by Master Mateo in 1188. ===P\u00f3rtico da Gloria=== The P\u00f3rtico da Gloria (\"Portico of the Glory\" in Galician) of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela is a Romanesque portico by Master Mateo and his workshop commissioned by King Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n. To commemorate its completion in 1188, the date was carved on a stone and set in the cathedral, and the lintels were placed on the portico. Finalising the complete three- piece set took until 1211, when the temple was consecrated in the presence of King Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n. The portico has three round arches that correspond to the three naves of the church, supported by thick piers with pilasters. The central arch, twice as wide as the other two, has a tympanum and is divided by a central column\u2014a mullion\u2014containing a depiction of Saint James. Vertically, the lower part is formed by the bases of the columns, decorated with fantastic animals, the middle portion consists of columns adorned with statues of the Apostles, and the upper part supports the base of the arches crowning the three doors. The sculpture is intended to serve as an iconographic representation of various symbols derived from the Book of Revelation and books of the Old Testament.V\u00e1zquez/Yzquierdo/Garc\u00eda/Castro 1996: pp. 76\u201377 ====Tympanum==== The arrangement of the tympanum is based on the description of Christ that John the Evangelist makes in Revelation (Chapter 1 v 1 to 18). In the centre, the Pantocrator is shown, with the image of Christ in Majesty, displaying in his hands and feet the wounds of crucifixion. Surrounding Christ is the tetramorph with the figures of the four Evangelists with their attributes: left, top St. John and the eagle and below St. Luke with the ox; on the right above, St. Matthew on the hood of the tax collector and below St. Mark and the lion. On both sides of the evangelists, behind Mark and Luke, are four angels on each side with the instruments of the Passion of Christ. Some are, without touching them directly, the cross and crown of thorns (left) and lance and four nails (right), another the column in which he was whipped and the jar through which Pontius Pilate proclaimed his innocence. Above the heads of these angels, two large groups of souls of the blessed, forty in all. In the archivolt of the central tympanum are seated the elders of the Apocalypse, each holding a musical instrument, as if preparing a concert in honor of God. Pantokrator's tympani P\u00f3rtico da Gloria. ====Mullion==== Mullion with the figure of Santiago. In the mullion, the figure of Saint James is seated with a pilgrim's staff, as a patron of the basilica. St. James appears with a scroll which contains written Misit me Dominus (the Lord sent me). The column just above his head with a capital which represents the temptations of Christ. On three of its sides, facing the inside of the temple, two kneeling angels pray. At the foot of the saint is another capital with the figures of the Holy Trinity. Under the Apostle is a representation of the tree of Jesse, the name given to the family tree of Jesus Christ from Jesse, father of King David; this is the first time that this subject is represented in religious iconography in the Iberian Peninsula. The column rests on a base where there is a figure with beard to his chest (perhaps an image of Noah) and two lions. At the foot of the central column at the top inside, looking towards the main altar of the cathedral, is the kneeling figure of the Master Mateo himself, holding a sign on which is written Architectus. This image is popularly known as Santo dos Croques from the ancient tradition of students hitting their heads against the figure for wisdom, a tradition that was adopted later by pilgrims, although steps are being taken to limit access, to stem deterioration from which the work has suffered. ====Jambs==== jambs of the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria. In the columns of the central door and two side doors, the apostles are represented, as well as prophets and other figures with their iconographic attributes. All are topped with its own capital which represents different animals and human heads with leaf motifs. The names of all the figures are on the books or scrolls held in their hands. The four pillars of the portico are based on strong foundations which represent various groups of animals and human heads with beards. For some historians, these figures are images of demons and symbolize the weight of glory (the portico in this case) crushing sin. Other sources give an apocalyptic interpretation, with wars, famine and death (represented by the beasts) with situations that can only be saved by human intelligence (the heads of older men). ====Side doors==== The archivolt of the right door is the Last Judgment. The arch of the right door represents the Last Judgment. The double archivolt is divided into two equal parts by two heads. Some authors identify these heads with the figures of archangel Michael and Christ. For others, they are Christ-Judge and an angel or may indicate God the Father and God the Son. To the right of these heads, Hell is represented with figures of monsters (demons) that drag and torture the souls of the damned. On the left is Heaven with the elect, with figures of angels with children symbolizing the saved souls. The arch of the left door depicts scenes from the Old Testament, with the righteous awaiting the arrival of the Savior. In the center of the first archivolt is God the Creator who blesses the pilgrim and holds the Book of Eternal Truth; to his right are Adam (naked), Abraham (with the index raised), and Jacob. With them are two figures that could be Noah (new father of humanity saved through the Flood) and Esau or Isaac and Judah. To the left of God are Eve, Moses, Aaron, King David and Solomon. In the second archivolt, the top, ten small figures represent the twelve tribes of Israel. ===Fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro=== Night view of the fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro. The Obradoiro square in front of the fa\u00e7ade alludes to the workshop (obradoiro, in Galician) of stonemasons who worked on the square during the construction of the cathedral. In order to protect the P\u00f3rtico da Gloria from deterioration caused by weather, this fa\u00e7ade and towers have had several reforms since the 16th century. In the 18th century it was decided to build the current Baroque fa\u00e7ade, designed by Fernando de Casas Novoa. It has large glazed windows that illuminate the ancient Romanesque fa\u00e7ade, located between the towers of the Bells and of the Ratchet. In the middle of the central body is St. James and one level below his two disciples Athanasius and Theodore, all dressed as pilgrims. In between, the urn (representing the found tomb) and the star (representing the lights Hermit Pelagius saw) between angels and clouds. The tower on the right depicts Mary Salome, mother of St. James, and the tower on the left depicts his father Zebedee. The balustrade on the left side depicts St. Susanna and St. John and the one on the right depicts St. Barbara and James the Less. A stair allows entrance to the fa\u00e7ade. The stair was made in the 17th century by Gin\u00e9s Mart\u00ednez and it is of Renaissance style inspired by Giacomo Vignola of Palazzo Farnese. It is diamond-shaped with two ramps that surround the entrance to the old 12th century Romanesque crypt of the Master Mateo, popularly called the \"Old Cathedral\". Between the existing plane of the fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro and the old Romanesque portal (P\u00f3rtico da Gloria) there is a covered narthex. This fa\u00e7ade has become a symbol of the cathedral and the city of Santiago de Compostela. As such, it is the engraving on the back of the Spanish euro coins of 1, 2 and 5 cents. ===South fa\u00e7ade or das Pratar\u00edas=== The square of the Romanesque fa\u00e7ade das Pratar\u00edas, this facade keep the trace of its second church, which was built between 1103 and 1117. The fa\u00e7ade of the Silverware (Pratar\u00edas in Galician) is the southern fa\u00e7ade of the transept of the cathedral of Santiago de Compostela; it is the only Romanesque fa\u00e7ade that is preserved in the cathedral. It was built between 1103 and 1117 and elements from other parts of the cathedral have been added in subsequent years.Navascu\u00e9s 1997: p. 223 The square is bound by the cathedral and cloister on two sides. Next to the cathedral is the Casa do Cabido. It has two entrance doors in degradation with archivolts and historical tympanums. The archivolts are attached over eleven columns, three are of white marble (middle and corners) and the rest of granite. In the center are the figures of twelve prophets and the Apostles on the sideline. On the tympanums is a large frieze separated from the upper body by a strip supported by grotesque corbels; on this floor are two windows decorated with Romanesque archivolts. In the central frieze is Christ, with various characters and scenes. On the right six figures belong to the choir of Master Mateo that were placed in the late 19th century. The original provision of the iconographic elements was invalidated since in the 18th century numerous images were introduced recovered from the dismantled Acibechar\u00eda facade. A central medallion shows the Eternal Father (or Transfiguration) with open hands and on the top surface there are four angels with trumpets heralding the Final Judgment. In the tympanum of the left door is Christ tempted by a group of demons. To the right is a half-dressed woman with a skull in her hands, which could be Eve or the adulterous woman. This figure is not praying on her knees but is sitting on two lions. The jambs are Saint Andrew and Moses. In the left abutment, the Biblical King David seated on his throne with his legs crossed, translucent through the thin fabric of his clothes, and playing what appears to be a rebec, personifies the triumph over evil and is an outstanding Romanesque work, sculpted by Master Esteban. The creation of Adam and Christ's blessing is also shown. Many of these figures come from the Romanesque fa\u00e7ade of the north or do Para\u00edso (current fa\u00e7ade of the Acibechar\u00eda) and were placed on this fa\u00e7ade in the 18th century. In the tympanum of the right door there are several scenes from the Passion of Christ and the Adoration of the Magi. In one of the jambs is the inscription commemorating the laying of the stone: ERA / IC / XVI / V IDUS / JULLII Registration follows the Roman calendar, according to the computation of the Spanish era, corresponding to July 11, 1078. An image, unidentified, of a fox eating a rabbit and, against this, a badly dressed woman with an animal in her lap. Supported on the wall of the tower Berenguela appear other images representing the creation of Eve, Christ on a throne, and the Binding of Isaac. ===North fa\u00e7ade or da Acibechar\u00eda=== Facade da Acibechar\u00eda. The fa\u00e7ade \"da Acibechar\u00eda\" (Galician name derived from the jet gemstone) is in the Praza da Inmaculada or Acibechar\u00eda, draining the last section of urban roads: French, Primitive, Northern and English through the old gate Franx\u00edgena or Paradise door. The Romanesque portal was built in 1122 by Bernardo, treasurer of the temple. This portal was demolished after suffering a fire in 1758; some sculptural pieces that were saved were placed on the fa\u00e7ade das Pratar\u00edas. The new fa\u00e7ade was designed in Baroque style by Lucas Ferro Caaveiro and finished by Domingo Lois Monteagudo and Clemente Fern\u00e1ndez Sarela in the neoclassical style in 1769, although it retained some traces of the baroque. At the top of the fa\u00e7ade is an 18th-century statue of St. James, with two kings in prayer at his feet: Alfonso III of Asturias and Ordo\u00f1o II of Le\u00f3n. In the centre is the statue of Faith. ===East fa\u00e7ade or da Quintana=== Porta Real The fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral that overlooks the Quintana Square has two gates: the Porta Real (royal gate) and the Porta Santa (holy gate). The construction of the Porta Real, baroque, was begun under the direction of Jos\u00e9 de Vega y Verdugo and by Jos\u00e9 de la Pe\u00f1a de Toro in 1666, and was completed by Domingo de Andrade in 1700, who built some of the columns that span two floors of windows, a balustrade with large pinnacles, and an aedicula with an equestrian statue of Saint James (now disappeared), well adorned with decorative fruit clusters and large-scale military trophies. The kings of Spain entered the cathedral through this door, hence its name, and the royal coat of arms on its lintel. The so-called Holy Door (Porta Santa) or Door of Forgiveness (Porta do Perd\u00f3n) is the closest to the steps. It is usually closed with a fence and opened only in Jubilee Years (years when St James's Day, 25 July, falls on a Sunday). It was one of the seven lesser gates and was dedicated to St. Pelagius (whose monastery is just opposite). On this door niches contain the image of James, with his disciples Athanasius and Theodore at his side. On the bottom and sides of the door were placed twenty-four figures of prophets and apostles (including St. James) coming from the old stone choir of Master Mateo. Inside this door through a small courtyard is the true Holy Door, which enters into the ambulatory of the apse of the church.Otero Pedrayo 1965: pp. 405\u2013406 ===Bell Towers=== Treasure tower The early towers in the main fa\u00e7ade of the cathedral were Romanesque (current fa\u00e7ade of the Obradoiro). They are called the Torre das Camp\u00e1s, which is situated on the side of the Epistle (right) and Torre da Carraca, to the side of the Gospel (left). The two have a height of between 75 and 80 metres. The first part of the tower was built in the 12th century, but in the 15th century several modifications were made and King Louis XI of France donated in 1483 the two largest of the thirteen bells. Due to a tilt that was detected in its structure between the 16th and 17th centuries, the towers had to be reinforced with buttresses, between 1667 and 1670. The towers housing the bells were made by Jos\u00e9 de la Pe\u00f1a de Toro (1614\u20131676) in a baroque style, and completed by Domingo de Andrade. The architecture of the towers has a great effect in perspective with its vertical lines and the sequencing of its floors.Navascu\u00e9s 1997: p. 226 ===North Tower or da Carraca=== Tower da Carraca. It is located to the left of the fa\u00e7ade del Obradoiro, and was built \u2013 like its partner \u2013 on the opposite side of an earlier tower of the Romanesque period. It was designed by Fernando de Casas Novoa in 1738, imitating the bell towers by Pe\u00f1a de Toro and Domingo de Andrade in the 17th century: baroque decorations adorned all kinds of ornamentation that provided a unifying architecture across the fa\u00e7ade. ===Clock Tower, Torre da Trindade or Berenguela=== Clock Tower The Clock Tower, also called Torre da Trindade or, Berenguela, is at the intersection of the Pratar\u00edas square and the Quintana square. Traditionally, construction was thought to begin in 1316, at the request of Archbishop Rodrigo de Padr\u00f3n as a defence tower. After his death his successor, Archbishop B\u00e9renger de Landore, continued work on it, though these dates are questioned by some authors. When he became main master of the cathedral, Domingo de Andrade continued with its construction and between 1676 and 1680 raised it two floors higher; the use of various structures achieved a harmonious and ornamental design, with a pyramid-shaped crown and a lantern as a final element, with four light bulbs permanently lit. It rises to seventy-five metres. In 1833 a clock was placed on each side of the tower by Andr\u00e9s Antelo, commissioned by the Archbishop Rafael de V\u00e9lez. As part of its mechanism it has two bells, one, at the hour, called Berenguela, and a smaller one marking the quarter hours. These two were cast in 1729 by G\u00fcemes Sampedro. Berenguela has a diameter of 255 cm and a height of 215 cm, weighing approximately 9,600 kilos, and the smaller weighs 1,839 kilos with diameter 147 cm and height 150 cm. Both original bells cracked, forcing their replacement. The current replicas were cast in Asten (Netherlands) by the Eijsbouts house in 1989 and were placed in the cathedral in February 1990. ==Interior== The cathedral is 97 m long and 22 m high. It preserves its original, barrel-vaulted, cruciform, Romanesque interior. It consists of a nave, two lateral aisles, a wide transept, and a choir with radiating chapels. Compared with many other important churches, the interior of this cathedral gives a first impression of austerity until one enters further and sees the magnificent organ and the exuberance of the choir. It is the largest Romanesque church in Spain and one of the largest in Europe. ===The P\u00f3rtico da Gloria=== P\u00f3rtico da Gloria The 12th-century Portico da Gloria, behind the western fa\u00e7ade, is in the narthex of the west portal. It is a remain from the Romanesque period, a masterwork of Romanesque sculpture built between 1168 and 1188 by Master Mateo at the request of king Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n. The vigorous naturalism of the figures in this triple portal is an expression of an art form, varied in its details, workmanship and polychromy (of which faint traces of colour remain). The shafts, tympana and archivolts of the three doorways which open onto the nave and the two aisles are a mass of strong and vibrant sculpture representing the Last Judgment. The central tympanum gives an image of Christ in Majesty as Judge and Redeemer, showing His wounds in His feet and hands, accompanied by the tetramorph. He is surrounded on both sides by a retinue of angels carrying the symbols of the Passion. In the archivolt are represented the 24 Elders of the Apocalypse, who are playing musical instruments. organistrum (in the archivolt) The column statues represent the apostles with their attribute, along with prophets and Old Testament figures with their name on a book or parchment. These were all polychromed. The faint smile of the prophet Daniel as he looks at the angel of Reims is especially noteworthy. Saint James on the middle pier The middle pier represents Saint James, his face conveying an ecstatic serenity. The text scroll in his hand shows the words Misit me Dominus (the Lord sent me). Below him is the Tree of Jesse (the lineage leading to Christ), while above is a representation of the Trinity. It is customary for the pilgrims to touch the left foot of this statue, signifying that they have reached their destination. So many pilgrims have laid their hands on the pillar to rest, that a groove has been worn in the stone. The lateral portals are dedicated to the Jews on the left and to the unbelievers on the right. The right tympanum is divided into three parts and is dedicated to the theme of salvation. In the centre are Christ and St Michael, flanked by Hell (represented by demons) and Heaven (represented by children). Purgatory is shown on the side. The left tympanum shows scenes from the Old Testament. Demons are represented at the bottom of the p\u00f3rtico, signifying that Glory crushes sin. View of the altar. Chapel of Salvador Nave and choir. Behind the portico stands the statue of Maestro Mateo, the master architect and sculptor put in charge of the cathedral building programme in the 12th century by Fernando II. It is said that whoever butts their head three times against the statue will be given a portion of Mateo's geniusLonely Planet: Spain. 4th Ed. 2003 and perhaps enhanced memory. There was formerly a long line of visitors waiting to touch their head against the statue, but it is now blocked off because an indentation started to develop from the repeated contact. The sculptures in this portico were a reference point for Galician sculpture until the 15th century. ===The nave=== The barrel-vaulted nave and the groin-vaulted aisles consist of eleven bays, while the wide transept consists of six bays. Every clustered pier is flanked by semi-columns, three of which carry the cross vaults of the side aisles and the truss of the arched vaults, while the fourth reaches to the spring of the vault. Lit galleries run, at a remarkable height, above the side aisles around the church. The choir is covered by three bays and surrounded with an ambulatory and five radiating chapels. The vault of the apse is pierced by round windows, forming a clerestory. The choir displays a surprising exuberance in this Romanesque setting. An enormous baldachin, with a sumptuous decorated statue of Saint James from the 13th century, rises above the main altar. The pilgrims can kiss the saint's mantle via a narrow passage behind the altar. In the choir aisle the beautiful lattice work and the vault of the Mondragon chapel (1521) stand out. The radiating chapels constitute a museum of paintings, retables, reliquaries and sculptures, accumulated throughout the centuries. In the Chapel of the Reliquary () is a gold crucifix, dated 874, containing an alleged piece of the True Cross. ===Crypt=== St James The crypt, below the main altar, shows the substructure of the 9th-century church. This was the final destination of the pilgrims. The crypt houses the relics of Saint James and two of his disciples: Saint Theodorus and Saint Athanasius. The silver reliquary (by Jos\u00e9 Losada, 1886) was put in the crypt at the end of the 19th century, after authentication of the relics by Pope Leo XIII in 1884. Throughout the course of time, the burial place of the saint had been almost forgotten. Because of regular Dutch and English incursions, the relics had been transferred in 1589 from their place under the main altar to a safer place. They were rediscovered in January 1879. ===Botafumeiro=== The swinging Botafumeiro dispensing clouds of incense A dome above the crossing contains the pulley mechanism to swing the \"Botafumeiro\", which is a famous thurible found in this church. It was created by the goldsmith Jos\u00e9 Losada in 1851. The Santiago de Compostela Botafumeiro is the largest censer in the world, weighing and measuring in height. It is normally on exhibition in the library of the cathedral, but during certain important religious holidays it is attached to the pulley mechanism, filled with of charcoal and incense. In the Jubilee Years (whenever St James's Day falls on a Sunday) the Botafumeiro is also used in all the Pilgrims' Masses. Eight red-robed tiraboleiros pull the ropes and bring it into a swinging motion almost to the roof of the transept, reaching speeds of and dispensing thick clouds of incense. ==Other burials== * Alfonso Daniel Rodr\u00edguez Castelao, at the Pante\u00f3n de Galegos Ilustres (\"Pantheon of Illustrious Galicians\"), Bonaval * Fructuosus of Braga * Rosal\u00eda de Castro * Fernando P\u00e9rez de Traba * Ferdinand II of Le\u00f3n * Alfonso IX of Le\u00f3n * Pedro Fern\u00e1ndez de Castro * Gaspar de \u00c1valos de la Cueva ==Old images== File:El P\u00f3rtico de la Gloria de la Catedral de Santiago de Compostela, 1849, Jenaro P\u00e9rez Villaamil, Palacio de la Moncloa, Madrid.JPG|P\u00f3rtico da Gloria in 1849 by Jenaro P\u00e9rez Villaamil File:036 Santiago (da Compostela) Portico de la G loria in der Kathedrale.jpg|P\u00f3rtico da Gloria, Collotype 1889 File:110 Santiago (da Compostela) Westfassade der Kathedrale.jpg|Westside main fa\u00e7ade of the Cathedral towards Praza do Obradoiro, Collotype 1889 ==See also== * Asturian architecture * Catholic Church in Spain * Santiago de Compostela * 12 Treasures of Spain ==References== == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * * Reconstruction of the swinging motion of the Botafumeiro * Photographs of the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain * Pictures of Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela * HyperSculpture \u2013 P\u00f3rtico de la Gloria *The Art of medieval Spain, A.D. 500\u20131200, an exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries (fully available online as PDF), which contains material on Santiago de Compostela Cathedral (pp. 175\u2013183) Category:9th-century churches Category:13th-century Roman Catholic church buildings Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1211 Category:Galicia (Spain) Category:Basilica churches in Spain Santiago de Compostela Category:Churches in Galicia (Spain) Category:Galician architecture Category:Galician culture Category:Camino de Santiago Category:Buildings and structures in Santiago de Compostela Category:Church buildings with domes Category:Pre-Romanesque architecture in Spain Category:Romanesque architecture in Galicia (Spain) Category:Baroque architecture in Galicia (Spain) Category:Bien de Inter\u00e9s Cultural landmarks in the Province of A Coru\u00f1a Category:Burial sites of the Anscarids Category:13th-century establishments in Spain Category:Spanish legends Category:Tombs of apostles ",
