There is an Azerbaijan-Georgia border crossing at Postbina in the rayon that is open to both local residents and foreigners. ==History of the rayon== Archaeological finds including many historical monuments and kurgans in the region speak of early human habitation. Balakan was a part of Caucasian Albania. A Greek writer of the time who authored books on the battle between the Roman troops and Caucasian Albanians on the bank of Alazani (Qan\u0131x) river in 65 AD., described the locals as calm, prideful and full of courage. In the 7th century, Balakan was invaded by Arabs and Balak\u0259n settlement was destroyed. After the Arab rule was overthrown in 9th\u201310th centuries, Balakan established its political and economic links with Shaki. Both provinces developed sericulture as their primary industry. The etymology of names such as \"Getovlar\" (similar to Hettax), Hunbulanchay (similar to Huns), Ingiloy (similar to Gellah) and others confirm habitation of the region by early nomadic Turkic tribes. In 1803 the Balakan Rayon territory was incorporated into the Russian Empire and was administratively a part of Georgia until 1842, after that it was a separate oblast. In 1844 the Char- Balakan Military Region was founded. From 1860 to the end of the Russian Empire it was a part of Georgia within the Tiflis Governorate. When Democratic Republic of Georgia was established, Balakan was a part of Zaqatala District, one of Georgia's eastern provinces. After the Soviet occupation of Georgia in 1921, Zaqatala District was handed over to Azerbaijani SSR by the Bolshevik Government. During the Great Patriotic War, 6,882 residents of Balakan fought Nazi Germany and 2,315 of them died on the front lines. During Nagorno- Karabakh War, Balakan lost 152 residents who fought in Karabakh. Balakan rayon was created on 8 August 1930. The settlement Balak\u0259n was assigned to be the administrative center of the rayon. It later grew to become a city type settlement in 1954 and received a status of a city in 1968. In 1963, the rayon was abolished and joined with Zaqatala Rayon. In 1965, it was again re- established as an independent rayon.
