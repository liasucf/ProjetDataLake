    "text": "Where? is the debut album by bassist Ron Carter recorded in 1961 and released on the New Jazz label. Ron Carter discography accessed February 21, 2011 Some reissues of the album appear under Eric Dolphy's name.Discogs album entry, accessed March 30, 2015 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Jim Todd stated \"Carter and Dolphy had played together in Chico Hamilton's group and on Dolphy's important 1960 date Out There. Where? has elements in common with both, but is closer to Hamilton's late-'50s chamber jazz than to the more outward-bound Dolphy date. ... Carter's skill is undeniable, but his playing on Where? is a bit polite and monochromatic. ...Dolphy -- playing bass clarinet, alto sax, and flute -- is a far more interesting prospect, even if he doesn't blow his face off to the extent he did in other settings\" ==Track listing== :All compositions by Ron Carter except as indicated # \"Rally\" -- 5:42 # \"Bass Duet\" -- 5:43 # \"Softly, as in a Morning Sunrise\" (Oscar Hammerstein II, Sigmund Romberg)\" -- 7:37 # \"Where?\" (Randy Weston)\" -- 5:58 # \"Yes, Indeed\" (Sy Oliver)\" -- 5:51 # \"Saucer Eyes\" (Weston)\" --5:08 ==Personnel== * Ron Carter -- bass (tracks 3, 4 & 6), cello (tracks 1, 2, 4 & 5) * Eric Dolphy -- alto saxophone, bass clarinet, flute (tracks 1, 3, 5 & 6) * Mal Waldron -- piano * George Duvivier -- bass (tracks 1, 2, 4 & 5) * Charlie Persip -- drums ==References== Category:New Jazz Records albums Category:Ron Carter albums Category:Eric Dolphy albums Category:1961 albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Albums produced by Esmond Edwards ",
