Stateside, it peaked at number 27 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its accompanying music video was directed by Dave Meyers. The song was featured in the comedy The Hot Chick. Milian performed the song on All That in 2002. The song was also included on the album \"Madison Mix\" which was released to promote the My Scene dolls. ==Music video== The music video for \"AM to PM\" was directed by Dave Meyers. It starts with Milian waking up after going to bed that night. She then gets ready to leave the house, and decides to sneak out of the house. She turns off the alarm, hides from her mom, by hanging below the stairs. She stops the dog from barking by throwing him a bone and then exits the house. She grabs her backpack, which she had thrown out from the window in her room, and jumps in the backseat of her friends' car. She and her friends then go to a club, and they are able to skip the line by showing the bouncer a beeper that reads \"AM to PM.\" She and her friends then proceed into the club and start to dance. They all dance and Christina dances on a stage with many background dancers. After Christina and her friends leave, she attempts to sneak back into her house. Her dad is reading the newspaper and the dog is barking again. She sees this and then runs around to enter the house through the backdoor. She sprints to her room and dives into her bed. Her dad checks on her, thinking that she's asleep, and she pretends to be. After he leaves, Christina says \"from AM to PM,\" and the video ends. Kevin Federline is featured in the main nightclub dance sequence throughout the video. ==Formats and track listings== These are the formats and track listings of major single-releases of \"AM to PM.\" UK Promotional Single # \"AM to PM\" (Radio Edit) - 3:51 # \"AM to PM\" (Instrumental) - 3:51 US CD Single # \"AM to PM\" (Album version) - 3:52 # \"Between Me and You\" (Ja Rule featuring Christina Milian) \\- 4:24 # \"A Girl Like Me\" (snippet) - 2:03 # \"You Make Me Laugh\" (snippet) - 2:06 # \"When You Look at Me\" (snippet) - 1:46 # \"It Hurts When...\" (snippet) - 2:01 # \"Satisfaction Guaranteed\" (snippet) - 2:34 # \"AM to PM\" (Enhanced Music Video) UK CD single # \"AM to PM\" (Album Version) - 3:51 # \"AM to PM\" (Ignorants Remix) - 4:18 # \"AM to PM\" (E-Smoove House Mix) - 7:22 # \"AM to PM\" (Enhanced Music Video) European/Australian CD Maxi Single # \"AM to PM\" (Radio Edit) - 3:51 # \"AM to PM\" (E-Smoove House Mix) - 7:12 # \"AM to PM\" (Hex Hector / Mac Quayle Club Mix) - 6:18 # \"AM to PM\" (Irv Gotti's Gutta Remix) - 3:35 # \"AM to PM\" (Enhanced Music Video) European CD Single # \"AM to PM\" (Radio Edit) - 3:51 # \"AM to PM\" (E-Smoove House Mix) - 7:22 Japanese CD Single # \"AM to PM\" (Radio Edit) - 3:53 # \"AM to PM\" (Irv Gotti Remix) - 3:51 # \"AM to PM\" (Instrumental) - 3:43 ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2001\u20132002) !Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |align=\"center\"|16 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |Romania (Romanian Top 100) |align=\"center\"|69 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2001) !Position |- |Netherlands (Dutch Top 40) |align=\"center\"|100 |- |Netherlands (Single Top 100) |align=\"center\"|81 |} {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (2002) !Position |- |Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders) |align=\"center\"|74 |- |UK Singles (Official Charts Company) |align=\"center\"|79 |} ===Certifications=== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2001 debut singles Category:Christina Milian songs Category:Songs written by Christina Milian Category:Dance-pop songs Category:Music videos directed by Dave Meyers (director) Category:Song recordings produced by Bloodshy & Avant Category:Songs written by Pontus Winnberg Category:Songs written by Christian Karlsson (record producer) Category:2000 songs ",
