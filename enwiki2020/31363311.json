    "text": "Chris Connor is an album by jazz singer Chris Connor. Atlantic Records released the album, Connor's first for the label, in 1956. The recording was Atlantic's first jazz vocal LP record. == Recording == The tracks appearing on Chris Connor were recorded over the course of three sessions. The first of these occurred on January 19, 1956, with a small orchestra accompanying Connor, using arrangements by Ralph Burns. On January 23, Connor was accompanied by a quartet led by pianist John Lewis with Oscar Pettiford on bass. On February 8, Connor's accompanists included Nick Travis, Zoot Sims and Milt Hinton, with arrangements by Burns. The album comprises four tracks from each recording session. == Critical reception == The Penguin Guide to Jazz includes Chris Connor in its \"Core Collection\", and assigns it a four-star rating (of a possible four), noting that \" 'Ev'ry Time', 'It's All Right With Me', 'I Wonder What Became Of Me', and several more are unlikely to be bettered\". John Bush, writing for allmusic, calls the album one of Connor's best, giving the album a rating of four-and-a-half stars (of a possible five). == Track listing == == Personnel == On \"Something to Live For\", \"When the Wind Was Green\", \"He Was Too Good to Me\" and \"My April Heart\" (recorded January 19, 1956): * Chris Connor \u2013 vocals * 19-piece orchestra (Ralph Burns, conductor) On \"I Get a Kick Out of You\", \"Where Are You?\", \"Everytime\" and \"Almost Like Being in Love\" (recorded January 23, 1956): * Chris Connor \u2013 vocals * John Lewis \u2013 piano * Barry Galbraith \u2013 guitar * Oscar Pettiford \u2013 bass * Connie Kay \u2013 drums On \"Get Out of Town\", \"Anything Goes\", \"You Make Me Feel So Young\", and \"Way Out There\" (recorded February 8, 1956): * Chris Connor \u2013 vocals * Nick Travis \u2013 trumpet * Zoot Sims \u2013 tenor saxophone; solo on \"Way Out There\" * Al Young, Sam Marovitz, Ray Beckenstein, Danny Banks \u2013 saxophones * Moe Wechsler \u2013 piano * Barry Galbraith \u2013 guitar * Milton Hinton \u2013 bass * Osie Johnson \u2013 drums == References == Category:Chris Connor albums Category:Atlantic Records albums Category:1956 albums Category:Albums produced by Nesuhi Ertegun Category:Albums produced by Ahmet Ertegun Category:Albums produced by Jerry Wexler Category:Albums conducted by Ralph Burns ",
