    "text": "Ailill (or Oilioll), son of Sl\u00e1noll, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland; scholars now believe these kings to be a pseudohistorical construct of the eighth century AD, a projection into the distant past of a political entity which did not become a reality till Maelseachlainn I. He took power after killing his cousin Berngal. He ruled for twelve, fifteen or sixteen years, according to various versions of the Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9rennR. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, pp. 239-240 (Geoffrey KeatingGeoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.26 and the Four MastersAnnals of the Four Masters M4003-4019 agree on sixteen) before he was killed by S\u00edrna S\u00e1eglach, a great grandson of Rothechtaid mac Main. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises his reign with that of Deioces of the Medes (694-665 BC). The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his reign to 831\u2013815 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 1197\u20131181 BC. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland Category:Pseudohistory ",
