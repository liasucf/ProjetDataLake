    "text": "This is a list of colleges, seminaries, and universities that do not have educational accreditation. In many countries, accreditation is defined as a governmental designation. Degrees or other qualifications from unaccredited institutions may not be accepted by civil service or other employers. Some unaccredited institutions have formal legal authorization to enroll students or issue degrees, but in some jurisdictions (notably including the United States) legal authorization to operate is not the same as educational accreditation.Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) , Oregon Office of Degree Authorization, accessed October 5, 2010John Bear and Mariah P. Bear (2003), Bears' guide to earning degrees by distance learning, Ten Speed Press. Institutions that appear on this list are those that have granted post- secondary academic degrees or advertised the granting of such degrees, but which are listed as unaccredited by a reliable source. An institution may not maintain accreditation for one of several reasons. A new institution may not yet have attained accreditation, while a long-established institution may have lost accreditation due to financial difficulties or other factors. Some unaccredited institutions are fraudulent diploma mills.Important Questions about Accreditation, Degree Mills, and Accreditation Mills , Council on Higher Education Accreditation website, retrieved October 17, 2010. Other institutions (for example, some Bible colleges and seminaries) choose not to participate in the accreditation process because they view it as an infringement of their religious, academic, or political freedom.An example of a school that has historically refused to participate in an accreditation process is Pensacola Christian College. The Chronicle of Higher Education reported (in Bartlett, Thomas, \"A College That's Strictly Different ,\" March 24, 2006): \"Pensacola has shown no interest in outside approval of any kind. Nor does it advertise its unaccredited status. A search of the Web site turns up no mention of accreditation. It is not mentioned in the college's viewbook either, which dedicates four pages to sports activities and two to campus facilities. It is mentioned, in small print, on the inside flap of the course catalog: 'Pensacola Christian College has never made application for regional accreditation as the College believes it would jeopardize the College's philosophical distinctives.' The catalog goes on to say that getting other colleges to accept Pensacola's credits 'has seldom been an insurmountable problem.'\" Some government jurisdictions exempt religious institutions from accreditation or other forms of government oversight.Religious Exempt Schools , Oregon Office of Degree Authorization website, accessed October 17, 2010. Still other institutions are not required to have accreditation. Some of the institutions on this list are no longer in operation. Several unaccredited universities have names that are similar to those of accredited institutions, and thus some persons may be misled into thinking that an entity is an accredited university. Accreditation is date-related: In the United States, colleges and universities are typically not fully accredited until several years after they open. Also, in the United States, many colleges and universities existed prior to the development of the modern accreditation system. There are many organizations which give their own accreditation, not generally recognised as valid by governments and others, to educational institutions. Many of these are listed in the article List of unrecognized higher education accreditation organizations. Some of the educational institutions listed here claim accreditation from such organizations. == A == * Accademia di Belle Arti di Medicino, ItalyFiocchetti, C., Checcacci, C. & Lantero, L., \"How to spot and counter diploma mills\", Chapter 4 (November 2010) Information Centre on Academic Mobility and Equivalence (CIMEA) * Accademia Normanna, Italy, Gambia, Florida (issues degrees through \"Studiorum Universitas Ruggero II\") * Acad\u00e9mie Europ\u00e9ene d'Informatisation, a.k.a.
