    "text": "International Container Terminal Services, Inc. (ICTSI) () is a global port management company headquartered in Manila, Philippines. Established December 24, 1987, ICTSI is the Philippines' largest multinational and transnational company, having established operations in both developed and emerging market economies in Asia Pacific, the Americas, and Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The company is ranked the eighth largest container terminal operator, according to TEU equity volume. ==History== ICTSI was established by Spanish- Filipino businessman Enrique K. Razon Jr., whose family has been managing harbors in the Philippines for three generations, in connection with the bidding for the privatization of the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT). In 2019, Forbes named Razon the fourth richest Filipino and the 379th richest individual in the world, with a personal wealth of $5.1 billion. In May 1988, the Philippine Ports Authority awarded the MICT contract to ICTSI, which started its operations of MICT on June 12, 1988. In March 1992, ICTSI's shares were listed on the Manila and Makati Stock Exchanges (now the Philippine Stock Exchange) following the initial public offering of its shares. ICTSI is an international operator of common user container terminals serving the global container shipping industry. Its business is the acquisition, development, operation and management of container terminals focusing on facilities with total annual throughputs ranging from 50,000 to 3,000,000 twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs). It also handles break bulk cargoes and provides a number of ancillary services such as storage, container packing and unpacking, inspection, weighing, and services for refrigerated containers or reefers. ICTSI is an independent port operator with no vested interests in shipping line activity. It is, therefore, looked upon as a neutral operator that can offer an equal standard of service to all shipping line clients. ICTSI management is known throughout the world for the development and management of highly efficient and operationally effective container terminals and ports, in both developing and developed political and economic environments. ==Asia Pacific== Manila International Container Terminal, Manila, Philippines In 1988, ICTSI won in an international tender a 25+25-year concession to manage, operate and develop the Manila International Container Terminal (MICT), ICTSI's flagship operation and the Philippines\u2019 leading international trading gateway.

The MICT is one of the three terminals in the Port of Manila, the core of the Philippine port system.

A dedicated container terminal, the MICT mainly handles international containerized cargo. ICTSI also handles bulk cargo at the MICT basin anchorage. The MICT today is the Philippines' largest international container terminal in terms of volume and capacity, capturing an estimated 65 percent market share in the Port of Manila. Guaranteed efficiencies make it the most efficient in the country, at par with the best terminals in the world. Moreover, seamlessly integrated operational and administrative systems make it the most modern and efficient terminal in the country.
