The first class of two persons (Edgar Dawson and Walter Simpson) was graduated April 16, 1917. In 1929 a new brick building was erected by E.E. Nupp Construction Co., Starford, Pa. This is now incorporated into the present high school building. The faculty was headed by William A. McCreery who had been teaching here since 1925 and was elected principal in 1928. In 1954 work on an extensive addition to the high school was begun and continued into 1955. Addition classrooms, including a new commercial department, a shop, and storage facilities were added to the building in 1962. The Marion Center East Mahoning Joint School Board was organized in 1928. In 1951 an important change came with the organization of a new high school jointure consisting of Marion Center, Canoe Independent, East Mahoning, Grant, Rayne, South Mahoning, Plumville, and Washington. The new joint school board, with representatives from each district, supplanted the old Marion Center-East Mahoning Joint Board effective July 1, 1951. From this point, the high school and its affiliate elementary buildings became known as the Marion Center Area School District. Mr. McCreery was elected Supervising Principal. In 1955 the jointure was extended to the elementary grades. Under the School District Reorganization Act of 1963, effective July 1, 1966, the school assumed the title of Marion Center Area High School. == Athletics == === Boys Athletics === * Baseball - Class AA * Basketball - Class AA * Cross Country - Class AA * Football - Class AA * Swimming - Class AA * Track and Field - Class AA * Wrestling - Class AA === Girls Athletics === * Basketball - Class AA * Cross Country - Class AA * Softball - Class AA * Swimming- Class AA * Track and Field - Class AA * Volleyball - Class AA The school district has many extra-curricular activities, including an AFJROTC and a marching band. == External links and references == * Marion Center Area School District * Penna.
