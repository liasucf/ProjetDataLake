    "text": "The was a Japanese coin worth half of a Japanese yen, as 100 sen equalled 1 yen. These coins circulated from the late 19th century to the early 1950s, when Japan adopted a single currency unit and this coin was demonetized. ==History== Fifty sen coins were first minted in 1870 during the reign of the Meiji emperor. The New Currency Act of 1871 stipulated the adoption of the decimal accounting system of yen (1, \u5713), sen (1\u2044100, \u92ad), and rin (1\u20441000, \u5398), with the coins being round and manufactured using Western machinery.A. Piatt Andrew, Quarterly Journal of Economics, \"The End of the Mexican Dollar\", 18:3:321\u2013356, 1904, p. 345 Although mintages numbered in the hundreds of thousands, it was reported in 1904 that fifty sen coins were not commonly seen in circulation. Production of silver coins stopped in 1938, and the coins were replaced by brass ones starting in 1946. The final fifty-sen coins were produced two years later, and the coin was eventually taken out of circulation at the end of 1953. ==Composition== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Years !

Coins for this period all begin with the Japanese symbol \u660e\u6cbb (Meiji). Fifty sen pieces that were minted between 1874 and 1877, and in 1880, are considered key date coins with a value in the thousands of US dollars. Early silver fifty sen coins have often been counterfeited, so grading by an expert is recommended for collectors. *Inscriptions on Japanese coins from this period are read clockwise from right to left: \"Year\" \u2190 \"Number representing year of reign\" \u2190 \"Emperor's name\" (Ex: \u5e74 \u2190 \u4e94\u5341\u4e09 \u2190 \u6cbb\u660e) {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
