    "text": "The Albrecht family is a North German family whose members have been prominent as civil servants, politicians and businesspeople. The family is descended from Barthold Albrecht (born 1557), who was a pastor in Bodenwerder. Numerous of his descendants were doctors, jurists and civil servants in what became the Electorate and Kingdom of Hanover, a state that was in a personal union with the United Kingdom from 1714. The family was among the h\u00fcbsche (\"courtly\" or \"genteel\") families of Hanover, the informal third elite group after the nobility and the clergy that encompassed the higher bourgeoisie and university-educated civil servants. The lawyer Karl Franz Georg Albrecht (1799\u20131873) became director-general of direct taxation in the Kingdom of Hanover in 1847, and then director-general of customs from 1854 and member of the State Council of Hanover from 1856. He was the father of George Alexander Albrecht (1834\u20131898), who became a wealthy cotton merchant in the city state of Bremen, where he became part of the Hanseatic elite and was appointed as the Austro-Hungarian Consul in 1895. He married Louise Dorothea Betty Knoop (1844\u20131889), the daughter of the major cotton industrialist, Baron Ludwig Knoop, who had been ennobled in the Russian Empire. They were the parents of the cotton merchant Carl Albrecht (1875\u20131952), who married Mary Ladson Robertson (1883\u20131960), who belonged to a prominent American family of the Southern aristocracy from Charleston, South Carolina; she was a descendant of James Ladson and several colonial governors of Carolina. Carl and Mary Albrecht were the parents of the medical doctor and psychologist Carl Albrecht (1902\u20131965). The latter was the father of the conductor George Alexander Albrecht and the European civil servant and later Prime Minister of Lower Saxony Ernst Albrecht. The conductor George Alexander Albrecht was the father of the chief conductor of the Dutch National Opera Marc Albrecht while Ernst Albrecht was the father of the President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen (n\u00e9e Albrecht) and of the businessman Hans-Holger Albrecht.Ehrengast mit Bremer Wurzeln The family is included in the Deutsches Geschlechterbuch which covers prominent families in Germany.
