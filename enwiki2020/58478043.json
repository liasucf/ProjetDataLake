    "text": "The Jaci (, , ) is a river of Sicily, Italy on the eastern coast of the island, and immediately at the foot of Mount Etna. It rises under a rock of lava, and has a very short course to the sea at Acireale (ancient Acium). It is celebrated on account of the mythological fable connected with its origin, which was ascribed to the blood of the youthful Acis, crushed under an enormous rock by his rival Polyphemus.Ovid Met. 13.750, etc.; Sil. Ital. 14.221-226; Anth. Lat. 1.148; Serv. ad Virg. Eel. ix. 39, who erroneously writes the name Acinius. It is evidently in allusion to the same story that Theocritus speaks of the \"sacred waters of Acis.\"\u1f0c\u03ba\u03b9\u03b4\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f31\u03b5\u03c1\u1f78\u03bd \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1, Idyll. 1.69. From this fable itself we may infer that it was a small stream gushing forth from under a rock; the extreme coldness of its waters noticed by SolinusSolin. 5.17 also points to the same conclusion. There is every appearance that the town of Acium derived its name from the river. ==References== Category:Rivers of Sicily Category:Locations in Greek mythology Category:Rivers of Italy ",
