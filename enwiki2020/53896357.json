Fukuro Publishing, Japan. (Anticipated distribution: May, 2017) == Technological Competency as Caring in Nursing: A Model for Practice == Locsin's middle range nursing theory is an interesting discussion of the correlation between hands-on patient care and the use of technology. Technology is defined as anything that makes things efficient \u2013 from basic diagnostic technologies to therapeutic practices familiar to all nurses. Specifically, he discusses the importance of understanding the need for knowing \u201chigh-tech\u201d instruments, e.g. monitors, implants, and devices, that are a part of patient care, as these will provide opportunities for the nurse to know the patient fully as person. Nurses use and encounter technology in nearly every aspect of their profession. What does it mean to be technologically competent? What does it mean to be a caring nurse? How does technology support nursing work? How does it hinder nursing work? How can nurses care for their patients as technological advancements are introduced nearly every day? Technological Competency as Caring in Nursing: A Model for Practice provides insight and answers into how nurses can express their nursing by being technologically competent. As such, Locsin sustains the understanding that being technological competent is being caring. Locsin's work is obviously guided by the question asked by thoughtful nurses everywhere: How can I satisfactorily reconcile the idea of competent use of technology with the idea of caring in nursing? His theory significantly describes a practical understanding of the solution enriching the practice value of all of the general theories of nursing which are grounded in caring. Technological competency as caring in nursing informs nursing as a critical process of knowing persons\u2019 wholeness. Locsin's theory book explores, clarifies, and advances the conception of technological competency as caring in nursing. His theory is essential to modeling a practice of nursing from the perspective of caring. It is a practical illumination of excellent nursing in a technological world. == References == Category:Filipino nurses Category:1954 births Category:Living people Category:Filipino expatriates in Japan Category:People from Dumaguete Category:Florida Atlantic University faculty Category:University of the Philippines alumni Category:Silliman University alumni ",
