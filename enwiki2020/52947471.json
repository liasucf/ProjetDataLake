The vessel was launched by the California Shipbuilding Company on April 29, 1944, and completed on June 19, 1944. The ship's US Maritime Commission designation was VC2-S-AP3, hull number 14 (V-14). The Sapulpa served in the Pacific Theater during World War II and was operated by the Alcoa SS Company. The 10,500-ton Victory ships were designed to replace the earlier Liberty ships. While Liberty ships were designed to be used only during World War II, Victory ships were designed to last longer and serve the US Navy both during and after the war. Victory ships differed from Liberty ships in that they were faster, longer, wider, taller, had a thinner stack set further toward the superstructure and had a long raised forecastle.National Parks, Reading 2: Victory Ships SS Sapulpa Victory was christened and launched at the yards of the California Shipbuilding Corporation on Terminal Island in Los Angeles.
