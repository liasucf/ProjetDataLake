It is inscribed on the back \"Lych Gate The Deserted Village\" E.M.B. and includes four handwritten lines from the poem.

She lectured before Ruskin Societies. She took a course in architecture by Sir Bannister Fletcher. She graduated from the Royal College of Art, South Kensington in 1887 at the age of 18. In 1897 she received her Art Masters Certificate from that same college. She took certificates in biology, botany and geology. She moved to Canada in 1919 and lived in Ottawa, Ontario. She lived in Montreal, Quebec from 1928 to 1934.
