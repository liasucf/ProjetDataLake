It will run from 17 December 2016 until a yet to be determined date in 2017, with the formal structure of the league having been changed to incorporate 3 additional teams, each from a different state or territory. The AJIHL is the highest Australian national junior ice hockey competition. ==League business== Ice Hockey Australia made the announcement that the Australian Junior Ice Hockey League would be expanding in the 2016-17 season. It planned to include teams from Queensland, South Australia and Australian Capital Territory into the regular season format after the previous season using a Tier 2 tournament for the 3 new teams. Due to cost of travel after adding 3 additional cities to the league, the season format was changed to a multiple weekend tournament format and the league was divided into 2 conferences. Two other issues faced at the beginning of the season were that there was no ice availability reserved in Melbourne, Victoria to schedule games for the Melbourne Glaciers and Adelaide was again experiencing issues with its main rink cooling system. With the first schedule originally announced and ready for December, the Canberra Junior Brave pulled out of the weekend and it is unknown if they would return later in 2017 in a future weekend tournament. With a shrinking junior talent pool in Melbourne, the Melbourne Whalers suspended operations for the 2016-17 season, leaving only the Melbourne Glaciers to participate. The Perth Pelicans would also suspend operations for the 2016-17 season, leaving the Perth Sharks as the only representation for junior talent in Western Australia. ==Exhibition Games== Exhibition games were planned for both the Sydney Sabres and the Sydney Wolf Pack to keep the teams active as neither team had any training sessions allocated for them to use. These games did not count as regular season games. ===February=== {| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"85%\" style=\"margin: 1em auto 1em auto\" |- ! width=\"1%\" | Game ! width=\"6%\" | Date ! width=\"4%\" | Time !
