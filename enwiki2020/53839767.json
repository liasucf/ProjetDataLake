Pope from the Cornell University, was awarded the status of Fellow in the American Physical Society, after they were nominated by their Division of Fluid Dynamics in 1991, for contributions of archival value to probability- density-function methods in turbulence modeling, to understanding of the geometry and distortion of surfaces in turbulent flows, and to extraction of Lagrangian statistics from direct numerical simulations. He is the recipient of 2008 Ya. B. Zeldovich Gold Medal from The Combustion Institute. and Propellants and Combustion Award (2012) from American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics.
