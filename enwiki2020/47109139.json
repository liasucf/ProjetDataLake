    "text": "Yours, Dreamily, is the debut album by The Arcs, a side-project by Dan Auerbach of The Black Keys. The album was released on September 4, 2015. ==Recording== The album originated as an Auerbach solo project but morphed into a collaborative effort, with musicians Leon Michels, Richard Swift, Homer Steinweiss, and Nick Movshon. All members of the band share songwriting credit for the album. It was recorded over two weeks at the Sound Factory in Los Angeles, Electric Lady Studios in New York, Auerbach's Easy Eye Sound in Nashville, and the Sound Mine in New York. Auerbach and Michels co-produced the album, and Tchad Blake mixed it. The New York-based all-female mariachi band Mariachi Flor de Toloache perform backing vocals on several album tracks and the lead vocals on \"Chains of Love\". ==Promotion== The first track released from the album was \"Stay in My Corner\", a song inspired by the May 2015 Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Manny Pacquiao boxing match. \"Stay in My Corner\" was released as a special 7\" vinyl record for the Mayweather-Pacquiao match and backed with the non-album track \"Tomato Can\". On June 9, 2015, the album was announced and \"Stay in My Corner\" was made available for download with pre-orders of the album via iTunes and the band's website. One month later, on July 10, 2015, the track \"Outta My Mind\" was released for download as the second single from the album, and with the non-album track \"My Mind\" on 7\" vinyl record. A video for the song \"Put a Flower in Your Pocket\" was released in mid-August 2015. ==Track listing== All songs produced by Dan Auerbach and Leon Michels. ==Personnel== Personnel adapted from Yours, Dreamily liner notes.http://www.discogs.com/The-Arcs-Yours- Dreamily/release/7426816 ;The Arcs *Dan Auerbach \u2013 vocals (all tracks except 1), electric guitar (tracks 2, 4-8, 9, 10, 12, 13 and 14), bass guitar (tracks 2, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11 and 13), acoustic guitar (tracks 3 and 14), keyboards (tracks 2, 9, 11, 12 and 13), synthesizer (track 3), buzz (track 13), percussion (tracks 12 and 14) *Leon Michels \u2013 piano (tracks 2, 6, 8, 9, 12 and 13), organ (tracks 2, 7, 8 and 9), keyboards (tracks 6, 9, 11, 12 and 13), saxophone (tracks 5, 10, 12 and 14), electric guitar (tracks 10, 11 and 12), percussion (track 1, 9 and 12), synthesizer (track 3), drums (track 9), bass guitar (track 12) *Richard Swift \u2013 drums (tracks 3, 4, 10, 11 and 13), keyboards (tracks 5, 10 and 11), acoustic guitar and percussion (track 4), vocals (track 5) *Homer Steinweiss \u2013 drums (tracks 2, 6 and 8) *Nick Movshon \u2013 bass guitar (tracks 6 and 8) ;Additional personnel *Mariachi Flor de Toloache \u2013 vocals (tracks 3, 4, 8, 11 and 13), horns and strings (track 4) *Veronica Medellin \u2013 guitarr\u00f3n (tracks 4 and 7) *Russ Pahl \u2013 electric guitar (track 3) *Chamberlin \u2013 drums (track 5) *Thomas Brenneck \u2013 guitar (track 8) *Ray Mason \u2013 trombone (track 9) *Lee Fields \u2013 vocals (track 9) *Bobby Emmett \u2013 piano, organ, horns and vocals (tracks 14) *Kenny Vaughan \u2013 baritone guitar (track 14) *Russ Pahl \u2013 pedal steel guitar (track 14) *Dave Roe \u2013 upright bass (track 14) *Jeffery Clemens \u2013 drums (track 14) *Brian Olive \u2013 vocals (track 14) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 75 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 27 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 albums Category:Nonesuch Records albums Category:The Arcs albums Category:Albums produced by Dan Auerbach ",
