    "text": "Kotugodella Fort (), also known as Katugodalla Fort or Katugod\u00e6lla Balakotuwa, was a Portuguese fort, located near Haldummulla. In 1630 the Portuguese, under the command of Constantino de S\u00e1 de Noronha attempted to use the ldalgashinna pass to force a way into the Uva. The fort was used as a staging post for troops in the attack. The fort is south of the Idalgashinna railway station, within the Needwood tea plantation. All that remains of the fort are the stone foundations of the semi-circular bastions. The fort was declared a protected archaeological site in November 2002. == References == ==See also== *Forts in Sri Lanka *Haldummulla fort Category:Buildings and structures in Badulla District Category:Forts in Uva Province Category:Portuguese forts in Sri Lanka Category:Archaeological protected monuments in Badulla District ",
