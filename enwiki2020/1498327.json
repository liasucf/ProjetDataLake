It is part of the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education and accredited by the Middle States Commission on Higher Education. It has more than 4,600 enrolled students spread between the main campus and the Porreco College in Erie, Pennsylvania.Edinboro University, \"Edinboro University Fact Sheet\", www.edinboro.edu, 2019-2020 == History == Edinboro University was founded as the Edinboro Academy, a private training school for Pennsylvania teachers in 1857, by the region's original Scottish settlers. It is the oldest training institution west of the Allegheny Mountains and the second oldest in all of Pennsylvania. In the beginning, Edinboro modestly consisted of one two-story building, six classrooms, three instructors, 110 students and a principal. That original building Academy Hall is currently used as the undergraduate admissions office. In 1861, the Edinboro Academy affiliated with the state government of Pennsylvania to become the second State Normal School in Pennsylvania, occasionally known as the Northwest State Normal School. (Normal schools are teachers colleges.) In 1914, the state purchased the school from the original stockholders and renamed it the Edinboro State Normal School. By 1927, the advancement of academic programs to include liberal arts study required the school to rename itself Edinboro State Teachers College. Further development of the liberal arts to include degree programs outside the field of education resulted in Edinboro becoming Edinboro State College in 1960. Continued development of undergraduate liberal arts programs and advanced graduate degrees earned Edinboro university status in 1983.Edinboro University, \"Edinboro University History\", www.edinboro.edu, 2019-2020 === Scottish heritage and traditions === Ross Hall As of Spring 2020, Edinboro is the first school in the world to offer a music education degree (BAME) that is open to students with a focus in bagpiping. The university and town that share the Edinboro name were founded by Scottish immigrants. Holding to its tradition, Edinboro University has a pipe band (a band that consists of bagpipes, snare drums and a bass drum) that performs alone and also with the \"Spirit of the Scots\" marching band for school related functions. Each year, Edinboro hosts a three-day highland games festival complete with Scottish heavy athletics; dancing; bagpipe band; Celtic harp; and other competitions. The University's fight song is a version of Scotland the Brave. == Campuses == The main campus is located from Erie, Pennsylvania and within of the educational and population centers of McKean, Waterford, and Albion. The main campus has 42 buildings on a campus which includes a lake, open fields and woods, 10 on-campus residence halls (Highlands 1~8, Rose Hall and Earp Hall) for approximately 2,500 students, and the seven-story Baron-Forness Library. Edinboro University offers 150 degree programs and 57 minors. The student- faculty ratio is 18:1. Edinboro students may also choose to complete coursework toward workforce-related associate degrees at the Porreco College in Erie. The Porreco College sits on the former Louis Porreco farm and estate in Millcreek Township and allows local students to complete a community college-like education. The Porreco College consists of 10 buildings in a farm-like setting. == Athletics == Baron-Forness Library Edinboro University offers 17 varsity sports: women's basketball, cross country, lacrosse, volleyball, swimming, soccer, softball, tennis, and indoor and outdoor track and field, and men's football, wrestling, cross country, basketball, swimming, tennis, wheelchair basketball and outdoor track and field.
