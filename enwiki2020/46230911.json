As a doctor and a mother, Swanson advocates the use of online tools, such as blogs, Facebook, Twitter and other social media sites, to strengthen communication between healthcare providers and patients. Swanson asserts that online technologies can assist patients and families in becoming stewards of their own health. Swanson has dedicated her career to helping physicians learn to use online tools more effectively in helping patients make informed decisions based in science. \"While we don't have the capability just yet,\" Swanson states, \"my goal is to prove that an empowered and informed patient reduces health care costs and improves outcomes.\" ==Education and training== Swanson was born and raised in Minnesota. She attended Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, where, in 1996, she earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in psychology. For two years, she taught bilingual science and math to middle school children in Oakland, California, with Teach for America. With this experience, Swanson developed an interest in working with youths. She went on to earn a medical degree and Master of Bioethics (MBE) degrees from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Swanson completed her pediatric residency training at Seattle Children's Hospital in Seattle, Washington. She completed her training in 2006. Swanson began her medical career at the Everett Clinic in Mill Creek, Washington,. In 2009, Swanson started the Seattle Mama Doc blog for Seattle Children's Hospital. In January 2011, Swanson was named to the Mayo Clinic's Center for Social Media Advisory Board. The goal of the board is to help the health care community \"improve care through the use of social media tools like Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. Swanson is an official spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), a member of the Board of Advisors for Parents Magazine, and blogs for The Huffington Post. She has also appeared on The Today Show. ==Conferences and keynote speeches== With the popularity of Swanson's blog, as well as her activism in improving physician use of social media, came invitations to speak at health care conferences within the U.S., Canada and the Netherlands. * Social Media Summit, hosted by the Mayo Clinic for Social Media, in Rochester, Minnesota (October 2011).

In her blog posts, Swanson offers general health and safety tips, discusses issues in the media like HPV, vaccinations, sudden infant death syndrome, car seats, and trends in breast-feeding, and shares her own experiences as a parent. \"The abundance of online noise invokes fear in all of us when making decisions for our children,\" said Swanson. \"At the end of the day, we as parents just want to do what is right.\" Swanson is a proponent of vaccinations, which reduce the risk of contracting diseases like whooping cough, polio and measles. Her interest in social media stems, in part, from a desire to counteract misinformation reported in popular media about the safety of childhood immunizations and other health concerns promoted by people like Jenny McCarthy, Dr. Mehmet Oz and Alicia Stone. \"I feel physicians are obligated to be online,\" Swanson told reporter Carol M. Rostrum. \"If celebrities are going to be online, then we educated, practicing physicians had better be there, too.\" Swanson uses Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, Doximity, and YouTube to educate and inform parents and her adolescent patients.
