    "text": "Easy Action is the second studio album by the American rock band Alice Cooper, released by Straight Records in March 1970. The title comes from a line from one of the band's favorite films, the musical West Side Story. As with Pretties for You, the band's debut from the previous year, Easy Action was neither a commercial nor critical success. Singles include \"Shoe Salesman\" and \"Return of the Spiders\". Drummer Neal Smith later said of the record producer David Briggs, \"David hated our music and us. I recall the term that he used, referring to our music, was 'Psychedelic Shit'. I think Easy Action sounded too dry, more like a TV or radio commercial and he did not help with song arrangement or positive input in any way.\" None of Easy Action\u2019s songs have ever been performed live by Cooper since the tour in support of their third album Love It to Death;Alice Cooper Tour Archive in fact, only \"Return of the Spiders\" was performed on the tour for that album. A small number of early U.S. copies were pressed on the blue Bizarre Records label. These copies carry the same catalog number WS-1845 and album cover as the regular Straight Records release. Though perhaps seen as being an overlooked work in terms of later releases, Easy Action tracks \"Mr. & Misdemeanor\" and \"Refrigerator Heaven\" were both later included in the well-received compilation album The Life and Crimes of Alice Cooper. \"Refrigerator Heaven\" was also included in the Warner Bros. compilation album Zapped, which showcased acts signed or produced by Frank Zappa. The closing track \"Lay Down And Die, Goodbye\", which was originally written and recorded as a demo by the band when it was called Nazz, begins with a sample of Tom Smothers saying \"You are the only censor; if you don't like what I'm saying, you have a choice: you can turn me off\". This is followed by an instrumental jam and finishes with the chorus from the demo. (The last part of the song is listed on the Science Fiction album as \"I've Written Home to Mother\", while the instrumental jam section is listed as \"For Alice\" or \"An Instrumental\". ==Production== According to Alice Cooper's band manager, Shep Gordon, the band's record label wouldn't use the production tapes from producer David Briggs. Instead, the label opted to use the band's rehearsal tapes in the final cut of the album.http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-758-shep-gordon Cooper and Dunaway were fond of the musical film West Side Story, and quotes from the film appear in the song \"Still No Air\" (\"got a rocket in your pocket\", \"when you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way); another quote gives the album its title. ==Release and reception== The album appeared in 1970 with a cover on which the band poses turned away from the camera, their uncovered backs exposed except where covered with their long hair. A radio commercial that accompanied the album's release touted the band as \"unisex, raw, together, and violent\u2014just like you, fellow American\". The staff of Rolling Stone did not like the album, stating that \"there's nothing nearly that interesting\" and that \"the pretty stuff sounds like something Walt Disney had the good sense to leave in the can\". Robert Christgau, in The Village Voice, rated it a C, explaining that it has very few of the \"pseudo-decadent and -psychedelic charms\" shown on Pretties for You, along with \"tuneless singing, tuneless playing, tuneless tunes, and pseudo-musique concrete\". The music showed little of the hard rock the band became famous for; the songs on its first two albums are more reminiscent of the pop-rock and psychedelia of bands such as mid-1960s the Who and Jefferson Airplane. They failed to find an audience and sold poorly. The group moved to Detroit, and with the next album, Love It to Death, producer Bob Ezrin had them strip down their sound and simplify the songwriting; the album and its first single, \"I'm Eighteen\" were the first in a string of big successes. ==Legacy== AllMusic's Joe Viglione feels that the album \"might be the perfect picture of an evolving Alice Cooper Group\". And that it \"gives evidence that Cooper has more of a voice than he got credit for\". He concludes by saying: \"That this band could run the gamut from [Frank] Zappa to [David] Bowie, and perhaps inspired both, makes Easy Action a good study and entertaining record.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by Alice Cooper, Glen Buxton, Michael Bruce, Dennis Dunaway and Neal Smith. ;Side one #\"Mr. & Misdemeanor\" \u2013 3:05 #\"Shoe Salesman\" \u2013 2:38 #\"Still No Air\" \u2013 2:32 #\"Below Your Means\" \u2013 6:41 ;Side two #\"Return of the Spiders\" \u2013 4:33 #\"Laughing at Me\" \u2013 2:12 #\"Refrigerator Heaven\" \u2013 1:54 #\"Beautiful Flyaway\" \u2013 3:02 #\"Lay Down and Die, Goodbye\" \u2013 7:36 ==Personnel== ;Alice Cooper band *Alice Cooper \u2013 vocals *Glen Buxton \u2013 lead guitar *Michael Bruce \u2013 rhythm guitar, piano, backing vocals, lead vocals on \"Below Your Means\" and \"Beautiful Flyaway\" *Dennis Dunaway \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals *Neal Smith \u2013 drums, backing vocals with: *David Briggs \u2013 piano on \"Shoe Salesman\" ==External links== * ==References== ===Works cited=== * * * * * * Category:Alice Cooper albums Category:1970 albums Category:Albums produced by David Briggs (producer) Category:Straight Records albums Category:Enigma Records albums Category:Acid rock albums ",
