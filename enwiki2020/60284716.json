    "text": "Mineplex is a Minecraft minigame server. Mineplex is one of four Minecraft servers officially partnered with Mojang Studios, the developer of Minecraft. Mineplex is currently co-owned by Caleb Applegate. As of mid-2016, Mineplex had millions of unique players monthly. At its peak, the server had around 10,000 concurrent players at almost any given time, and broke a Guinness World Records record on January 28, 2015 for having 34,434 concurrent players, the most on a Minecraft server at the time. ==History== Mineplex was founded and created on January 24, 2016 by Gregory Bylos, known in Minecraft as \"Sterling_\", and \"Spu_\". The server is among the oldest Minecraft servers that are still running to this day. The server received large increases in player count after YouTuber CaptainSparklez published videos about the server. In 2016, the Dallas Mavericks partnered with Mineplex to create Dallas Mavericks World, a minigame for the server. According to a news release by the team, it will allow players to compete in building competitions and play a basketball minigame in a full-scale model of the American Airlines Center. The minigame was launched on the server in the summer of 2016. In Guinness World Records 2016: Gamers Edition, Mineplex was listed as the most popular Minecraft server network, having 34,434 players on the server at once on January 28, 2015. This record was lost to Hypixel the same year. Mineplex's popularity has been declining since its peak years, and now averages around 3,000 players simultaneously. == Features == The server's main feature is its various minigames, specially customized and heavily-modded multiplayer maps with different objectives. These minigames provide winnable gameplay mechanics to the sandbox game. They are divided into categories such as Classics, Arcade, Champions, Clans, and Holiday minigames. To pay for the server and its development, Mineplex sells in-game cosmetics and special features to players. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Minecraft servers ",
