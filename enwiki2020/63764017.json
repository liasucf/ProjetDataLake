    "text": "Zeynep Bast\u0131k (born 8 July 1993) is a Turkish singer, songwriter and actress. == Life == Zeynep Bast\u0131k was born on 8 July 1993 in \u00c7anakkale. When she was three years old, her family moved to \u0130zmir and she completed her secondary and high school education there. In 2010, she started professional music with the band \"Jackpot\" in \u0130zmir, performing mainly cover songs. Until 2012, she performed with this group on stage in different cities, including \u0130zmir, Eski\u015fehir and Bursa. She later joined the Fire of Anatolia as a dancer. Her backing vocals were featured in Murat Dalk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7's song \"L\u00fczumsuz Sava\u015f\", and she worked as Dalk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7's backing vocalist for three years. With Dalk\u0131l\u0131\u00e7's help, she released her first single \"F\u0131r\u00e7a\" in 2014. She started her solo career shortly afterwards. She became famous after releasing a cover version of Ezhel's song \"Felaket\". Additionally, she covered a number of other songs, notably by Fikri Karayel, Harun Kol\u00e7ak and \u00dcmit Say\u0131n, which she shared on her YouTube channel. These covers helped with increasing her fame. In June 2019, she released a single with An\u0131l Piyanc\u0131 titled \"B\u0131rakman Do\u011fru Mu?\". She also had minor roles in various TV series such as Ad\u0131 Mutluluk, Yasak Elma, Sil Ba\u015ftan and Umuda Kelep\u00e7e Vurulmaz. She gained further popularity after her single \"Her Yerde Sen\" became the theme song for the TV series of the same title \"Her Yerde Sen\", which aired its first episode on 14 June 2019. The song presents a lively mood, starting with an electric guitar riff that became the motive of the entire song. The song aptly narrates the backdrop of the show - two different people, Demir and Selin, who were forced to live in the same house because of a mishandled sale, the former being the managing director of the firm which the latter works in. An instrumental version of the song was also featured in the show's soundtrack, composed mainly by Zeynep Alasya and Alpay G\u00f6ltekin. She became an advertising face for Adidas in 2019 and Elidor in 2020. == Music style == Bast\u0131k mainly performs acoustic and electronic music. According to Tolga Aky\u0131ld\u0131z, performing the songs of artists such as Aylin Asl\u0131m, \u0130zel, Ferda An\u0131l Yark\u0131n, Kenan Do\u011fulu, Levent Y\u00fcksel, Jabbar, Tarkan, Mustafa Sandal, \u015eebnem Ferah, Harun Kol\u00e7ak, Ajda Pekkan, Nil\u00fcfer, Kerim Tekin, \u015eahsenem, Pinhani and Sezen Aksu, and her duets with multiple artists have contributed to her popularity in the digital music market. Bast\u0131k was able to come to the fore with these advantages. It has been suggested that Can Ozan, who made his debut in the same time as Bast\u0131k, became more popular and known after his duet with her was released. == Discography == ; Singles * 2014: \"F\u0131r\u00e7a\" * 2017: \"\u015eahaneyim\" * 2019: \"Her Yerde Sen\" * 2019: \"B\u0131rakman Do\u011fru Mu?\" (with An\u0131l Piyanc\u0131) * 2019: \"Mod\" (with Mustafa Sandal) * 2020: \"Uslanm\u0131yor Bu\" * 2020: \"\u00c7ukur\" * 2020: \"Her Mevsim Yaz\u0131m\" * 2020: \"Bir Daha\" * 2020: \"Darg\u0131n\" (with Emir Can \u0130\u011frek) == Filmography == ;TV series * 2014: Sil Ba\u015ftan * 2015: Ad\u0131 Mutluluk \u2013 Gonca G\u00fcl Duran * 2016: Umuda Kelep\u00e7e Vurulmaz \u2013 R\u00fcya * 2018: Yasak Elma \u2013 \u0130rem == References == == External links == * Category:1993 births Category:Living people Category:Turkish female singers Category:Turkish lyricists Category:Turkish pop singers Category:Golden Butterfly Award winners Category:21st-century Turkish singers Category:People from \u00c7anakkale Category:Turkish television actresses Category:21st-century women singers ",
