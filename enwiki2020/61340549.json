Retrieved July 22nd, 2019. Key findings of his research include: Concerning early childhood education, Deming has studied the impact of Head Start, finding that participants gain 0.23 SD on a summary index of young adult outcomes, which closes one-third of the gap between children from the median and bottom quartile family income.Deming, D. (2009). Early childhood intervention and life-cycle skill development: Evidence from Head Start. American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, 1(3), pp. 111-134. In earlier research with Susan Dynarski, he has also highlighted criticized redshirting, i.e., the continuously increasing practice of postponing the entry of children into school, arguing that little evidence supports the notion that doing so benefits children and some evidence suggests that redshirting reduces educational attainment by increasing high school dropout rates and depresses lifetime earnings by delaying entry into the labour market.Deming, D., Dynarski, S. (2008). The lengthening of childhood. Journal of Economic Perspectives, 22(3), pp. 71-92. In research with Dynarski on the link between college costs and educational attainment, he highlights the potential of college costs to depress college entry and persistence, arguing that simple and transparent programmes in general and programmes linking money to incentives and/or the takeup of academic support services in particular appear to be most effective.Deming, D., Dynarski, S. (2009). Into college, out of poverty? Policies to increase the postsecondary attainment of the poor. NBER Working Paper Series, No. 15387. Deming estimated that, in North Carolina, giving students and their families the choice which secondary school they attend substantially helped to reduce crime and incarceration rates among those given the choice, with the impacts being concentrated among high-risk youth whose propensity to become criminal and to commit severe crimes is cut by about half.Deming, D.J. (2011). Better Schools, Less Crime? Quarterly Journal of Economics, 126(4), pp. 2063-2115. In further work with Thomas Kane, Douglas Staiger and Judith Hastings, Deming finds that giving such the choice of school to students and their families induces them to generally choose public schools that are generally of higher quality, which in turn tends to raise girls' college attainment as these are most likely to benefit from improved learning environments.Deming, D.J. et al. (2014). School Choice, School Quality and Postsecondary Attainment. American Economic Review, 104(3), pp. 991-1013. Together with Claudia Goldin and Lawrence F. Katz, Deming has investigated the for-profit sector of U.S. higher education , observing that for-profit students are comparatively more likely to be unemployed or \"idle\" and to earn less after graduation as well as to have far higher default rates on their student loans relative to comparable students from non-profit institutions; by contrast, for-profits tend to educate a larger fraction of minority, disadvantaged and older student and are more successful in first-year student retention and AA and certificate level completion.Deming, D., Goldin, C., Katz, L. (2012). The for-profit postsecondary school sector: nimble critters or agile predators? Journal of Economic Perspectives, 26(1), pp. 139-164. In further research with them as well as with Noam Yuchtman and Amira Abulafi, Deming finds that a business bachelor's degree from a for-profit online institution is 22% less likely to receive a callback from an employer than one from a nonselective public institution, especially in the absence of external quality indicators.Deming, D.J. et al. (2016). The value of postsecondary credentials in the labor market: An experimental study. American Economic Review, 106(3), pp. 778-806. Examining whether online learning technologies have helped decrease prices in higher education, they find that real and relative prices for full-time undergraduate online education has fallen between 2006 and 2013, raising hopes that edtech can \"bend the cost curve\" of U.S. higher education, although they caution that the impact of online learning on education quality remains uncertain.Deming, D.J. et al. (2015). Can Online Learning Bend the Higher Education Cost Curve? American Economic Review, 105(5), pp. 496-501. Relative to the 1980s and 1990s, the U.S. labour market increasingly rewarded social skills in the 2010s, especially in combination with math skills, which Deming attributes to social skills reducing coordination costs and enabling worker specialization and cooperation.Deming, D.J. (2017). The growing importance of social skills in the labor market.
