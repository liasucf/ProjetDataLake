Rani was the first elected Governor of Bangka-Belitung Islands, serving between 2002 and 2007. ==Biography== Rani was born in the town of Sungailiat in Bangka Regency on 20 November 1950. He went through his first twelve years of education there, before studying his higher education in Bandung. In the 1980s, he worked in the tin mining company UPTB (today PT Timah). In 1997, he was elected speaker of Pangkal Pinang's city council. He later joined the provincial council (DPRD) of Bangka-Belitung and became its deputy speaker. After winning a gubernatorial vote in the provincial council, he was sworn into office on 22 April 2002 as the province's first elected governor, with a delay caused by differences between the provincial and national regulations. His term expired and Eko Maulana Ali replaced him on 25 April 2007 after defeating Rani in the province's first direct gubernatorial election. He was later elected as a member of the Regional Representative Council representing his home province and was sworn in on 1 October 2014. ==References== Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Regional Representative Council Category:People from the Bangka Belitung Islands Category:Members of Indonesian city councils Category:Members of Indonesian provincial assemblies Category:Governors of the Bangka Belitung Islands ",
