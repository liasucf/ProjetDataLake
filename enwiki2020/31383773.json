    "text": "Yaduvanshis a term used for describing various Rajputs groups claiming descent from the ancient king Yadu. Several inscriptions links the to the legendary Lunar dynasty. According to these, Chudasamas were a branch of the Samma lineage that acquired the principality of Vanthali from the local ruler and subsequently occupied the already fortified city of Junagadh. Later inscriptions and the text Mandalika-Nripa-Charita link them to the Yadava family of the Hindu deity Krishna. For example, the inscriptions at Neminath Temple (c. VS 1510/c. 1454 CE) on Girnar calls the Chudasama Rajputs of the Yadava origin. Samira Sheikh says that Chudasama were originally pastoralists. She adds that, according to Charans, the Jadejas, Chudasamas, Bhatis and Sammas originate from four brothersAspat, Gajpat, Narpat and Bhupatwho descended from Krishna. This mythologised genealogy claims that the brothers first together conquered Egypt. After the Islamic conquest, Aspat converted to Islam and founded the Samma dynasty; then Gajpat conquered Ghazni; Bhupat established Bhatner; and Narpat, after first founding Nagar-Samoi in Sindh, became ancestor of Chandracuda, the first Chudasama ruler. in Similar claims with slightly different details have been recorded by past Indologists including Tod, Burgess, Desai and Rayjada. In addition, Tuhfat al Kiram, used by Elliot and Dowson in their History of India, records an Islamicised version of the myth. ==References== Category:Rajputs ",
