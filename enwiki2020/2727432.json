    "text": ":For other star systems with this Bayer designation, see \u03c9 Cygni. Omega2 Cygni, Latinized from \u03c92 Cygni, is the Bayer designation for a solitary star in the northern constellation of Cygnus. It has an apparent visual magnitude of 5.5, which is faintly visible to the naked eye on a dark night. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 8.17 mas, it is located roughly 399 light years from the Sun. At that distance, the visual magnitude is diminished by an extinction factor of 0.08 due to interstellar dust. This is a red giant star on the asymptotic giant branch, with a stellar classification of M2 III. It is a suspected variable star, although the evidence is considered \"doubtful or erroneous\". If it does exist, the variability is small with an amplitude of 0.05 magnitude and a timescale of around 30 days. There is a 58.3% chance that this star is a member of the Hercules stream. ==References== Category:Suspected variables Category:M-type giants Category:Double stars Cygni, Omega2 Category:Cygnus (constellation) Category:Durchmusterung objects Cygni, 46 195774 101243 7851 ",
