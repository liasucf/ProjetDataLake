    "text": "\"Hero\" is a song by the American rock band Weezer. It was released on May 6, 2020 as the second single from the band's upcoming fourteenth studio album, Van Weezer. ==Composition== Rolling Stone described \"Hero\" as an outcast anthem, which focuses on frontman Rivers Cuomo's feelings of inadequacy. The band described the song as for \"the stay at home dreamers, the zoom graduators, the sourdough bakers, and the essential workers\". Following the style of Van Weezers return to the band's roots in hard rock, \"Hero\" has been described musically as an upbeat Weezer song with heavy guitar usage. Spin described it as \"a dose of power pop.\" On July 30, the band released an alternate version of the song titled \"Hero (Piano)\", arranged as a piano ballad.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgaVuxUGBOU ==Music video== The music video for the song was directed by Brendan Walter and Jasper Graham. It begins with a scene of Cuomo writing a letter, which is then seen passed along Weezer fans, accompanied with footage of the band performing the song. At the end of the video, the letter is opened to reveal a tribute to essential workers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The video includes a cameo from the band Real Estate. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Songs written by Rivers Cuomo Category:Weezer songs Category:Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on music Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Crush Management singles Category:Song recordings produced by Suzy Shinn ",
