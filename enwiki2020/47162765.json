    "text": "The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia was a British Government initiative aimed at resolving an international crisis threatening to lead to war in Europe in the summer of 1938. The Mission, headed by a former British cabinet minister Lord Runciman, was sent to mediate in a dispute between the Government of Czechoslovakia and the Sudeten German Party (SdP), representing the radicalised ethnic German minority within the country. The British mediators were active on the ground in Czechoslovakia during the late summer, issuing their report shortly before the Munich Conference in September. ==Background== Districts in Czechoslovakia with an ethnic German population of 25% or more (pink), 50% or more (red), and 75 % or more (dark red) according to the census of 1930.Statistick\u00fd lexikon obc\u00ed v Republice \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 I. Zem\u011b \u010desk\u00e1, Prague, 1934 and Statistick\u00fd lexikon obc\u00ed v Republice \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 II. Zem\u011b moravskoslezsk\u00e1, Prague, 1935. The crisis in Czechoslovakia arose from demands for territorial autonomy (and probable eventual secession) for the predominantly German-speaking areas located mainly along the western borders of Czechoslovakia, known as the Sudetenland. These territories and their population of over 3 million ethnic Germans, historically parts of Bohemia within the Habsburg Empire, had been included in Czechoslovakia, largely for strategic and economic reasons, at the formation of the state in 1918.Perman, D., The Shaping of the Czechoslovak State: Diplomatic History of the Boundaries of Czechoslovakia, 1914\u20131920, Leiden, 1962, pp. 125\u201336. Following Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise to power in neighbouring Germany in 1933, the German minority population within Czechoslovakia, radicalised by economic hardship and propaganda, turned to the SdP \u2013 which emulated the Nazis across the border.Wiskemann, Elizabeth, Czechs and Germans: A Study of the Struggle in the Historic Provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, 2nd edn., London, 1967, pp. 197\u2013206. In April 1938, the party leader, Konrad Henlein, demanded not only full administrative autonomy for the German areas but also the right to practice National Socialism within them.Eight demands by Konrad Henlein, Carlsbad, 24 April 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918\u20131945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, no. 135. Earlier, in March 1938, during a meeting with Hitler in Berlin, Henlein was instructed to keep tension high by continuing to make demands of the Czechoslovak authorities but to avoid reaching a settlement with them.Henlein\u2019s report on meeting with Hitler, 28 March 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918\u20131945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, no. 107. The secret plan of preparation for the invasion of Czechoslovakia, \u201cCase Green\u201d, was set for completion by 1 October 1938.Directive for Operation \u201cGreen\u201d, Berlin, 30 May 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918\u20131945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, no. 221 ==Negotiations== Lord Runciman and his small teamIn addition to Runciman himself and Ashton-Gwatkin (a Foreign Office official), who acted as chief-of- staff, the Mission comprised, Robert Stopford (a banker with experience of international financial negotiations), Ian Henderson (a former British Consul at Innsbruck), Geoffrey Peto (a former Conservative Member of Parliament and parliamentary aid to Runciman), David Stephens (a parliamentary official), with secretarial provision by Rosemary Miller and Aline Tillard. Basil Newton, the British Minister in Prague, was also, in effect, part of the team. Hilda Runciman (a former Liberal Member of Parliament) accompanied her husband in a private capacity. [Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Palgrave Macmillan, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 128\u201333.] arrived in Prague on 2 and 3 August 1938. Although ostensibly independent of the British Government, a key member of the Mission was Frank Ashton-Gwatkin, technically on secondment from his official duties at the London Foreign Office.Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 128\u201330. Separate negotiations were held with the Czechoslovak Government and the SdP with a view to achieving a mediated settlement of the dispute. During meetings with the Czechoslovak President, Edvard Bene\u0161, and other government officials, Runciman repeatedly pressed for significant concessions be made to the SdP. Runciman also met Henlein on several occasions but did not subject him to the same pressure for an agreement.Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 243\u201360. The Czechoslovak Government initially resisted the SdP demand for full autonomy of the German areas but, under intense diplomatic pressure from Britain and France (Czechoslovakia\u2019s principal allyLukes, Igor, Czechoslovakia between Stalin and Hitler: The Foreign Policy of Edvard Bene\u0161 in the 1930s, New York, 1996, p. 34.), Bene\u0161 conceded the point in the so-called 'Fourth Plan' \u2013 in effect, calling the bluff of the SdP.Message from Hencke to the Foreign Ministry, Prague, 8 September 1938, Documents on German Foreign Policy, 1918\u20131945, Series D, vol. 2, London, 1950, nos. 441 and 442. This development caused the SdP to break off contacts with the Czechoslovak authorities and led to an increase of unrest in the German areas. The situation was further exacerbated by a bellicose speech from Hitler on September 12 which triggered an uprising in the Sudeten territories. Decisive action by the Czechoslovak authorities restored order and the SdP leadership fled to Germany.Smelser, Ronald M., The Sudeten Problem, 1933\u20131938: Volkstumspolitik and the Formulation of Nazi Foreign Policy, Folkestone, 1975, pp. 237\u201340. In this atmosphere of rising international tension in Central Europe, Runciman was summoned back to London on 16 September to brief ministers. The following day he informed a meeting of the Cabinet that, in his view, \u2018\u2019Czechoslovakia could not continue to exist as she was today\u2019\u2019 and some territory would have to be ceded to Germany, even if \"no more than cutting off certain fringes\". Other solutions \u2013 including the use of a plebiscite for the German areas, the creation of an independent Sudeten-German state, the calling of a four-power conference, the federalisation of Czechoslovakia or the implementation of a variant of Benes\u2019s \u2018Fourth Plan\u2019 \u2013 Runciman now considered impractical.Minutes of Cabinet meeting on 17 September 1938, Cabinet 39 (38), CAB 23/95, National Archives, London. ==Visiting Hitler== Towards the end of August, the lack of progress in negotiations in Czechoslovakia, accompanied by signs of increasing belligerence in Nazi Germany, prompted the British Government to seek direct contact with Hitler. The initial idea was for Runciman to undertake the task.Message from Halifax to Runciman, 25 August 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, no. 686. He, however, resolutely refused to do so. Arguing that it would compromise the independence of his Mission (and also on account of suffering ill health in the late summer heat in Prague), he declared: \u201cI am just not going to do it!\u201dStopford, R.J., Prague 1938\u20131939, p. 34, unpublished memoir, Stopford Papers, RJS 2/1, Imperial War Museum, London. Runciman\u2019s refusal resulted in the Prime Minister, Neville Chamberlain, developing plans for the dramatic step of himself flying to Germany to meet Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 15 September.Notes by Chamberlain of conversation with Hitler at Berchtesgaden on 15 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, no. 895. ==Report== The report of the Runciman Mission, in the form of letters to the British and Czechoslovak prime ministers dated 21 September 1938, was strongly hostile in tone towards the Czechoslovak Government and recommended the immediate transfer of the mainly German-inhabited territories to Germany. The 2000-word report placed the responsibility for the breakdown in negotiations very firmly on the SdP leadership who used the pretext of civil unrest in some German areas to sever contacts. The report also noted that Bene\u0161\u2019s 'Fourth Plan' proposals met \u201calmost all the requirements\u201d of the SdP\u2019s demands. Nevertheless, when itemising the grievances of the German minority, Runciman expressed his sympathy for the Sudeten case observing that it was \u201ca hard thing to be ruled by an alien race\u201d. Although declaring that Czech rule was \u201cnot actively oppressive, and certainly not \u2018terroristic\u2019\u201d, the report alleged \u201cit was marked by tactlessness, lack of understanding, petty intolerance and discrimination\u201d. Letter from Runciman to Bene\u0161, 21 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, appendix II, pp. 675\u20139. The issues complained of, in addition to the electoral system in which the SdP could be outvoted in parliament, included the appointment of Czech officials in German areas, Czech farmers moving into these areas and Czech schools being built for their children, discrimination in favour of Czech firms in government contracts and Czechs receiving preferential economic relief. Runciman was highly critical of the Czechoslovak authorities for failing to provide adequate remedies for these perceived injustices. This failure, he noted, resulted in a feeling of \u201dhopelessness\u201d amongst the German population but the \u201crise of Nazi Germany\u201d gave them \u201cnew hope\u201d, adding: \u201cI regard their turning for help towards their kinsmen and their eventual desire to join the Reich as a natural development in the circumstances.\u201d Foreseeing the danger of increased violence and even \u201ccivil war\u201d, Runciman considered that the \u201cfrontier districts should at once be transferred from Czechoslovakia to Germany\u201d, without recourse to a plebiscite which would be a \u201csheer formality\u201d. Amongst other measures the report proposed the neutralisation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia and an international guarantee of its security.Letter from Runciman to Bene\u0161, 21 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, appendix II, pp. 675\u20139. The report ostensibly provided the evidential basis for the proposals made by Chamberlain during his second meeting with Hitler at Bad Godesberg on 22 September. These proposal involved the transfer to Germany of those districts in Czechoslovakia with a majority German population.Notes of conversation between Chamberlain and Hitler at Godesberg on 22 September 1938, Documents on British Foreign Policy, 1919\u20131939, Third Series, vol. 2, London, 1949, no. 1033. Archival evidence suggests that the report was revised at a late stage, probably by Ashton-Gwatkin, in order to bring the document fully into line with British policy. The original draft of the report proposed the transfer of some territory, though the extent of the area concerned is open to question.Bruegel, J.W., Czechoslovakia Before Munich: The German Minority Problem and British Appeasement Policy, Cambridge, 1973, pp. 275\u20136.Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 344\u20139. However, when previously addressing the Cabinet on 17 September, Runciman indicated that he had in mind the specific possibility of transferring the areas with high concentrations of German inhabitants around the towns of Cheb and A\u0161, in the extreme west of the country. Minutes of Cabinet meeting on 17 September 1938, Cabinet 39 (38), CAB 23/95, National Archives, London. ==Reactions== Runciman\u2019s activities in Czechoslovakia were eagerly followed by a large international press corps, some of whom, in the course of their reporting, were critical of the use of his leisure time. The 67-year-old mediator (who was accompanied in Czechoslovakia by his wife, Hilda) spent most of his weekends relaxing in the company of the Sudeten German aristocracy, many of whom were supporters of the SdP.Runciman\u2019s stay in Czechoslovakia extended over six weekends, five of which were spent on the estates of the German aristocracy, located mostly in areas where he was exposed to the influence of the SdP. Only one of his hosts, Zden\u011bk Kinsk\u00fd, at \u017d\u010f\u00e1r in Moravia, was openly supportive of the Czechoslovak government. The other weekends were spent with Ulrich Kinsky near \u010cesk\u00e1 Kamenice, Adolf Schwarzenberg at \u010cesk\u00fd Krumlov, Clary-Aldringen at Teplice and Eugen Czernin at Petersburg. In addition, the estate of Max Hohenlohe, near Chomutov, who acted as the Mission\u2019s go-between with the SdP leadership, served as the venue for Runciman's meetings with Henlein. [Glassheim, Eagle, Noble Nationalists: The Transformation of the Bohemian Aristocracy, Cambridge, Mass., 2005, pp. 178\u201386.] These activities were arranged at the behest of the SdP with the aim of exposing the mediator to a social milieu favourable to their cause. Despite his rejection of the criticism, Runciman\u2019s claim of impartiality became severely compromised in the eyes of many. Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003, pp. 330\u20133. Following the publication of the Runciman report on 28 September, the American journalist Dorothy Thompson drew attention to a perceived internal inconsistency in the document, terming it \u201cillogical\u201d. She also expressed the suspicion that the report was \u201cmade to order to fit the agreement\u201d reached between Hitler and Chamberlain at Berchtesgaden and was a \u201cpiece of propaganda\u201d.New York Herald Tribune, 1 and 3 October 1938. Ashton- Gwatkin subsequently stated that Runciman had asked him to write a report that would \u201csupport the Prime Minister\u2019s policy\u201d.Ashton-Gwatkin to Stopford, 22 January 1970, Stopford Papers, RJS, Imperial War Museum, London. ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * Vy\u0161n\u00fd, Paul, The Runciman Mission to Czechoslovakia, 1938: Prelude to Munich, Basingstoke, 2003. * Wiskemann, Elizabeth, Czechs and Germans: A Study of the Struggle in the Historic Provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, 2nd edn., London, 1967. ==Notes== ==References== Category:Territorial disputes of Czechoslovakia Category:History of the foreign relations of the United Kingdom Category:Politics of World War II Category:Munich Agreement Category:Sudetenland ",
