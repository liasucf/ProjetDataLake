    "text": "Australian Biological Resources Study (ABRS) is a project undertaken by Parks Australia Division of Australia's Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts (DEWHA). == Background == ABRS was founded in 1973 from the recommendations of a 1972 Senate Select Committee report on Wildlife Conservation. Its purpose is to collate from the many libraries, museums and other collections the taxonomy of Australia's estimated 2 million species of flora and fauna, including aquatic species. These represent almost 20% of the earth's biodiversity, 80% of which are unique to Australia. ABRS has undertaken active funding for taxonomic research of Australia's biodiversity and is internationally recognised for its extensive data bases and publications. == Publications == The most important outputs of the ABRS has been the publication of the multi-volume Flora of Australia and Fauna of Australia series. Other output includes The Banksia Atlas and the \"Platypus\" database package for taxonomists. Sponsored publications from grants, or publishing projects include: : : : ==References== ==External links== * Category:Biota of Australia Category:Botany in Australia Category:Environment of Australia Category:Natural history of Australia ",
