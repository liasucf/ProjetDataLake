Dedicated to his friend General Nikolay Raevsky, it was inspired by the poet's time spent in Pyatigorsk during his southern exile. The poem is about a Byronic Russian officer who is disillusioned with elite life and decides to escape by seeking adventure in the Caucasus. He is captured by Circassian tribesmen but then saved by a beautiful Circassian woman. Despite its Romantic and Orientalist themes, Pushkin's use of academic footnotes and reliable ethnographic material gave it credibility in its day.Layton, p. 28 It was highly influential on popular perceptions of the Caucasus for its time. The poem remains one of Pushkin's most famous works and is often referenced in Russian popular culture, in films such as the Soviet comedy Kidnapping, Caucasian Style. ==English translations== * Roger Clarke, in ==References== ==See also== * Russian conquest of the Caucasus * The Prisoner of the Caucasus, a short story by Leo Tolstoy * A Journey to Arzrum, a later work by Pushkin on the Caucasus == External links == * The text of The Prisoner of the Caucasus at Russian Wikisource Category:Poetry by Aleksandr Pushkin Category:1821 poems Category:Narrative poems ",
