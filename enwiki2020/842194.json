    "text": "The Beau was an annual literary journal edited by Maurice Scully. It ran to three issues: 1981, 1982/83 and 1983/84. Although the journal was short-lived, its contributor list, featuring writers from Ireland, Britain and the United States, was impressive and it played an important role in the emergence of a number of experimental Irish poets. It also carried reproductions by a number of Irish artists. Contributors included Roy Fisher, Knute Skinner. William Oxley, Randolph Healy, Brian Coffey, David Wright, Paul Durcan, John Freeman, John Jordan, Anthony Cronin, Gavin Ewart, Eoghan \u00d3 Tuairisc, George Barker, Dermot Bolger and Jim Burns. The featured painters were Michael Mulcahy, Patrick Hall, Alice Hanratty and Patrick Pye. ==References== Category:Defunct literary magazines published in Europe Category:Defunct magazines published in Ireland Category:Literary magazines published in Ireland Category:Magazines established in 1981 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1984 Category:Annual magazines ",
