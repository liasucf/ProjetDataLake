    "text": "David Drury Macklin (1 September 1928 - 29 March 2015) was a British international rower. Macklin was born in Cambridge in 1928. He attended St John's College, Cambridge, and rowed for Cambridge in the 1951 Boat Race in which Oxford sank. This forced a re-row which Cambridge won by 12 lengths. He and his college crew also won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley in 1951, the last college crew to do so. Macklin went on to row for Leander Club, winning the Grand Challenge Cup in 1952 and 1953. He was selected for Great Britain and rowed in the men's eight at the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, being part of the crew who finished fourth. Macklin became the chief executive of Devon County Council. He died on 29 March 2015, survived by his wife Janet and their four children. In the 2016 Boat Races, Macklin's grand-daughter Fiona Macklin rowed for Cambridge. ==References== Category:1928 births Category:2015 deaths Category:Cambridge University Boat Club rowers Category:Rowers at the 1952 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic rowers of Great Britain Category:British male rowers Category:Commanders of the Order of the British Empire Category:Alumni of St John's College, Cambridge Category:European Rowing Championships medalists ",
