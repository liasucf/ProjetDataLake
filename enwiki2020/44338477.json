    "text": "Svend Johansen (10 September 1890 \u2013 6 October 1970) was a Danish painter, scenographer and illustrator. ==Biography== Born in Gentofte, Johansen attended the Copehangen Technical School where he met Poul Henningsen who became a friend and associate for the rest of his life. He studied painting at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from 1912 to 1916 under P. Rostrup B\u00f8yesen. In 1919, he began an extended stay in France where he met Vilhelm Lundstr\u00f8m in Paris in 1922. Together with Karl Larsen and Axel Salto, Johansen and Lundstr\u00f8m settled in Bormes near Cannes, establishing De Fire (The Four). They exhibited together until 1930. Johansen became a member of the Gr\u00f8nningen artists association in 1933, exhibiting there for many years. His stay in Bormes had brightened up his paintings, possibly under the influence of Henri Matisse and Auguste Renoir, depicting nude women and landscapes of the south of France. In addition to richly coloured prints, he also produced posters for Gr\u00f8nningen, Tuborg and for the theatre. He contributed sketches to Politikens Magasin and illustrated books by Pierre Lou\u00ffs, Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais and Johan Herman Wessel. Svend Johansen was perhaps most effective in contributing to scenic design in the theatre. From 1924, he brought new life into stage decoration in Tivoli's Sommerteater, including cubic curtain patterns. For productions of Maskarade, Bortf\u00f8relsen fra Seraillet and Slaraffenland, he not only designed striking stage sets but also provided the costumes. He also collaborated with Poul Henningsen in producing P\u00e5 ho'det (1929), a revue in N\u00f8rrebros Theater. ==Awards== In 1948, he was awarded the Eckersberg Medal and, in 1966, the Thorvaldsen Medal. ==References== ==Literature== * * ==External links== *Illustrated list of works by Svend Johansen in Danish museums from Kunstineks Danmark Category:1890 births Category:1970 deaths Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:Danish scenic designers Category:People from Gentofte Municipality Category:Recipients of the Thorvaldsen Medal Category:Recipients of the Eckersberg Medal Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts alumni ",
