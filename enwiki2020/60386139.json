The Queens Ledger has a circulation of 150,000, and is published weekly. Its main publisher is BQE Media. == History == The Queens Ledger was founded in 1873, and combined with the Long Island Register in 1941. Queens Ledger columnist Frank Borzellieri wrote a column comparing Queens representative of the New York Board of Education Terri Thomson to Adolf Hitler in July 2000. Borzellieri was originally suspended, but later that year, publisher Walter Sanchez rehired him even though Borzellieri refused to apologize. Sanchez cited his reasoning to many readers expressing their interest in Borzellieri's columns and opinions. As a result, Sanchez and the Queens Ledger received a lot of scrutiny, specifically from the Anti- Defamation League. == Significant coverage == In 1990, a public hearing was held in Long Island City, New York regarding the expansion of the Queens Boulevard subway line (F train) into 63rd street in Manhattan. There were many well known newspapers from the New York were covering the public hearing, such as the New York Times, and the Queens Ledger was among those newspapers.
