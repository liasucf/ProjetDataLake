This is a list of seasons completed by the Atlanta Flames of the National Hockey League. This list documents the records and playoff results for all eight seasons that the Atlanta Flames have completed in the NHL before their relocation to Calgary, Alberta in 1980. Atlanta would be left without an NHL franchise for 19 years. The Atlanta Thrashers were founded as an expansion team in 1999; however, the Thrashers would subsequently relocate to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 2011, becoming the current incarnation of the Winnipeg Jets, again leaving Atlanta without an NHL franchise. {| class=\"wikitable\" |bgcolor=\"#ffeeaa\"|Stanley Cup Champions |bgcolor=\"#ddffdd\"|Conference Champions |bgcolor=\"#d0e7ff\"|Division Champions |bgcolor=\"#ffbbbb\"|League Leader |} Note: GP = Games played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime losses, Pts = Points, GF = Goals for, GA = Goals against {| class=\"wikitable\" |-align=center style=\"font-weight:bold; background- color:#dddddd;\" | |Season || Team || GP || W || L || T || Pts || GF || GA || Finish || Playoffs |-align=center |1972\u201373 || 1972\u201373 || 78 || 25 || 38 || 15 || 65 || 191 || 239 || 7th in West || Did not qualify |-align=center |1973\u201374 || 1973\u201374 || 78 || 30 || 34 || 14 || 74 || 214 || 238 || 4th in West|| Lost in Quarter-finals 0\u20134 (Flyers) |-align=center |1974\u201375 || 1974\u201375 || 80 || 34 || 31 || 15 || 83 || 243 || 233 || 4th in Patrick || Did not qualify |-align=center |1975\u201376 || 1975\u201376 || 80 || 35 || 33 || 12 || 82 || 262 || 237 || 3rd in Patrick || Lost in Preliminary Round 0\u20132 (Kings) |-align=center |1976\u201377 || 1976\u201377 || 80 || 34 || 34 || 12 || 80 || 264 || 265 || 3rd in Patrick || Lost in Preliminary Round 1\u20132 (Kings) |-align=center |1977\u201378 || 1977\u201378 || 80 || 34 || 27 || 19 || 87 || 274 || 252 || 3rd in Patrick || Lost in Preliminary Round 0\u20132 (Red Wings) |-align=center |1978\u201379 || 1978\u201379 || 80 || 41 || 31 || 8 || 90 || 327 || 280 || 4th in Patrick || Lost in Preliminary Round 0\u20132 (Maple Leafs) |-align=center |1979\u201380 || 1979\u201380 || 80 || 35 || 32 || 13 || 83 || 282 || 269 || 4th in Patrick || Lost in Preliminary Round 1\u20133 (Rangers) |- | colspan=\"11\" align=\"center\" | Relocated to Calgary |-align=center style=\"font-weight:bold; background-color:#dddddd;\" | |colspan=\"2\"|Totals || 636 || 268 || 260 || 108 || 644 || 2057 || 2013 || || |} ==See also== *List of Calgary Flames seasons *List of Atlanta Thrashers seasons ==References== *2007\u201308 Calgary Flames Media Guide, pg. 105 * Category:National Hockey League team seasons Atlanta Flames Category:Atlanta Flames lists ",
