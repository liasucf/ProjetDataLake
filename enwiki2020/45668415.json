It was part of the traditional region of Upper Carniola and is now included with the rest of the municipality in the Central Slovenia Statistical Region. ==Geography== Podgora lies south of \u0160entvid, between Klagenfurt Street (Celov\u0161ka cesta) and Gradi\u0161\u010de Hill (441 m) along the old road to Pr\u017ean.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971.

A creek rises from a spring above the village and follows a ditch along the main road, where much residential housing was built after the Second World War. ==Name== The name Podgora is a fused prepositional phrase that has lost its case inflection (from pod 'below' + gora 'mountain'), literally meaning 'below the mountain'. Place names like Podgora (e.g., Podgorica, Podgorje) are relatively common in Slovenia. ==History== Podgora was annexed by \u0160entvid in 1961, ending its existence as an independent settlement.Spremembe naselij 1948\u201395. 1996.
