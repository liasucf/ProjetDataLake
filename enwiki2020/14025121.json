Nieves works as a maid in the big house, Quirce is doing his military service, and Charito is severely handicapped. The parents accept the repeated humiliations of their position as dependents at the whim of the owners and the estate manager, but Nieves and Quirce aim for a better life. The family is joined by R\u00e9gula's mentally handicapped brother Azar\u00edas, sacked from another estate, who loves birds. The owner's son Ivan often comes back to the estate for two reasons: he is conducting an affair with the manager's bored wife Pura and he is fanatical about shooting birds. Paco, who he forces up a tree to decoy pigeons, falls and breaks a leg. Then he tries using the simple Azar\u00edas and, in a fit of pique, shoots the man's pet jackdaw. Next time Azar\u00edas is sent up a tree to work decoys, he drops a noose round Ivan's neck and hangs him. Mentally a child, he is shut up in a secure asylum. ==Cast== * Alfredo Landa as Paco el Bajo * Terele P\u00e1vez as R\u00e9gula, his wife * Bel\u00e9n Ballesteros as Nieves, their elder daughter * Juan S\u00e1nchez as Quirce, their son * Susana S\u00e1nchez as La Ni\u00f1a Chica, their younger handicapped daughter * Francisco Rabal as Azar\u00edas, R\u00e9gula's handicapped brother * Agust\u00edn Gonz\u00e1lez as Don Pedro, the estate manager * \u00c1gata Lys as Do\u00f1a Pura, his wife * Mary Carrillo as Se\u00f1ora Marquesa, the estate owner * Juan Diego as Se\u00f1orito Iv\u00e1n, her son * Maribel Mart\u00edn as Se\u00f1orita Miriam, her daughter * Manuel Zarzo as Don Manuel, the doctor ==About the film== The distinctive landscapes are of the empty region of Extremadura, around the towns of Alburquerque and Zafra.
