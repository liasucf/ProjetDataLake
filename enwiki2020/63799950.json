    "text": "Upton and North Elmsall railway station, was a railway station on the Hull and Barnsley Railway (H&B;) in Yorkshire, England. The station served the communities of Upton and North Elmsall, (both now in the Wakefield District of West Yorkshire). The station closed completely in 1959 and the track was lifted in 1967, however, in 2020, a proposal was forwarded to reinstate over of line for a new heritage railway. ==History== Upton and North Elmsall was opened in July 1885 and was closed to passengers in January 1932. The station was west of Hull Cannon Street, west of railway station and east of the lines' first terminus at . Passenger services were always limited as the line had been built to exploit the South Yorkshire Coalfield, and export the coal through Hull Docks, but part of the Parliamentary approval for the line was conditional on the company providing a passenger service to the communities that the line went through. Bradshaw's timetable from 1906 has seven workings in each direction daily, whereas by 1922, just two services are shown running between Cudworth and Hull Cannon Street. The station lost its passenger trains when the service from Hull only went as far west as ; all other H&B; branches being closed to passengers in January 1932. Although the station closed to regular passenger traffic in 1932, it was still used for rail tours and special traffic such as football excursions until 1954. Closure of the station to goods came in 1959, but the line from the western portal of Barnsdale Tunnel to Cudworth, remained open for colliery traffic until 7 August 1967. The old trackbed in the area is now part of Upton Country Park. In 1996, a cutting to the east of the station site was designated as a nature reserve. ==Heritage site== In June 2020, a proposal was put forward to revamp the site and use it as a heritage railway centre. The proposal also includes laying of track through the Barnsdale Tunnel and stopping just short of the A1 road at Barnsdale Bar. ==References== ===Sources=== * ==External links== *Mapping of the station from 1906 *Map of the Hull and Barnsley system *Image of the station in 1961 Category:Disused railway stations in Wakefield Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1885 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1959 Category:Former Hull and Barnsley Railway stations ",
