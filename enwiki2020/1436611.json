    "text": "Northumbrian () was a dialect of Old English spoken in the Anglian Kingdom of Northumbria. Together with Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon, it forms one of the sub-categories of Old English devised and employed by modern scholars. The dialect was spoken from the Humber, now within England, to the Firth of Forth, now within Scotland. In the Danelaw after the Viking invasions, Northumbrian came under the influence of the invaders' Norse language. The earliest surviving Old English texts were written in Northumbrian: these are Caedmon's Hymn (7th century) and Bede's Death Song (8th century). Other works, including the bulk of Caedmon's poetry, have been lost. Other examples of this dialect are the Runes on the Ruthwell Cross from the Dream of the Rood. Also in Northumbrian are the 9th-century Leiden RiddleIn MS. Voss. lat. Q. 166 at the University of Leiden (see article by R. W. Zandvoort in English and Germanic Studies, vol. 3 (1949-50)) and the mid-10th-century gloss of the Lindisfarne Gospels. The Viking invasion forced a division of the dialect into two distinct subdialects. South of the River Tees, the southern Northumbrian version was heavily influenced by Norse, while northern Northumbrian retained many Old English words lost to the southern subdialect and influenced the development of English in northern England, especially the dialects of modern North East England (the modern Northumbrian dialect) and Scotland. In addition, Scots (including Ulster Scots) is descended from the Northumbrian dialect, as is modern Northumbrian and other dialects of Northern English. ==History== Extent of Northumbria, Historians of languages recognise four distinct dialects of Old English: Northumbrian, Mercian, Kentish and West Saxon. The Northumbrian dialect () was spoken in the Kingdom of Northumbria (from the Humber on the east coast of northern England to the Firth of Forth in the Scottish Lowlands). Modern Scots, Northumbrian and northern English accents and dialects originate from Northumbrian. It was significantly different from the accents spoken by other Kingdoms, especially that of West- Saxon (the primary dialect). Modern Standard English, on the other hand, has its origins in Mercian dialect. The Angles brought their language (Englisc) to Northumbria in the 6th century AD, where it reached the modern-day Scottish Lowlands. This form of Northumbrian Old English was first recorded in poetic; e.g. C\u00e6dmon's Hymn ), writings of the Venerable Bede () and the Leiden Riddle. The language is also attested in the Lindisfarne Gospels , in modern Scotland as a carved runic text, the Dream of the Rood, and on the Ruthwell Cross, . Old Northumbria was later conquered by the Danes (867\u2013883 AD) and from this day forth the language became influenced with Old Norse. The region of Lothian in the Lowlands, which was originally a part of the Kingdom of England, was invaded by Kenneth III of Scotland and became part of Scotland's sovereign territory. Despite the king being a Scottish Gaelic speaker, he allowed the region to keep its Northumbrian dialect, which was then still known as Inglis. However, the region became divided from Northumbria following the Battle of Carham (with the northern half of the territory under Scottish rule and the southern part under the English); the language north of the divide later became known as Scottis or Scots. The anonymous author of the Northumbrian Cursor Mundi, said southern English texts needed to be translated into northern dialects for people to understand what they were reading. Ralph Higden in 1364 described Northumbrian as incredibly difficult for southern natives to understand, believing the reason for this to be the \"strange men an nations that speaketh stronglie\" (i.e. the Scots) the region bordered. John of Trevisa spoke about nearby \"strange men an aliens\" in discussing northren English's alleged outlandishness, and in Osbern Bokenam wrote about Scots' influence on northern English in his Mappula Angliae. Bi the 14th-century, Lowland Scots became the main language of Scotland's Lowlands (excluding Galloway, which still spoke Gaelic). Despite this, Northumbrian began to lose its significance in England by the 16th century. Northumbrian dialectical terms, accents, and manners of speaking were considered incorrect and inelegant those in power, who were seated in the south of England. As England began to centralise its power in London and the south of England, texts in the midland and southern dialects became the de facto standard. Although a great number of letters, poems an newspaper articles were written in Northumbrian dialect throughout the 19th an 20th centuries, the southern form became the standard of the accent. The modern Northumbrian dialect is currently promoted by the Northumbrian Language Society. ==The Lord's Prayer== Some Scottish and Northumbrian folk still say or \"our father\" and \"thou art\".Gray, Alasdair, The Book of Prefaces, Bloomsbury Publishing, London 2000 (2002 edition) The Lord's Prayer as rendered below dates from .
