Some of the 48 hairpin turns near the top of the northern ramp of the Stelvio Pass in Italy Hairpin turn on Mont Ventoux in France Hairpins on a track to the south of Mont Valier, Pyrenees A hairpin turn (also hairpin bend, hairpin corner, etc.), named for its resemblance to a hairpin/bobby pin, is a bend in a road with a very acute inner angle, making it necessary for an oncoming vehicle to turn about 180\u00b0 to continue on the road. Such turns in ramps and trails may be called switchbacks in American English, by analogy with switchback railways. In British English \"switchback\" is more likely to refer to a heavily undulating road\u2014a use extended from the rollercoaster and the other type of switchback railway. == Description == Hairpin turns are often built when a route climbs up or down a steep slope, so that it can travel mostly across the slope with only moderate steepness, and are often arrayed in a zigzag pattern. Highways with repeating hairpin turns allow easier, safer ascents and descents of mountainous terrain than a direct, steep climb and descent, at the price of greater distances of travel and usually lower speed limits, due to the sharpness of the turn. Highways of this style are also generally less costly to build and maintain than highways with tunnels. On occasion, the road may loop completely, using a tunnel or bridge to cross itself at a different elevation (example on Reunion Island: ). When this routing geometry is used for a rail line, it is called a spiral, or spiral loop. In trail building, an alternative to switchbacks is the stairway. == Roads with hairpin turns == Some roads with switchbacks (hairpin turns) include: === Europe === United Kingdom: * The UK, in particular mountainous Scotland, has many mountain passes with hairpin bends; the Pass of the Cattle (Bealach na B\u00e0) in Scotland has many such turns. *Zig Zag Hill in Dorset, England, part of the B3081, is known for being one of the bendiest roads in the country. *Continental Europe: *Alpe d'Huez in the French Alps, famous for its 21 hairpin bends *Stelvio Pass (German: Stilfserjoch) with its 48 hairpin bends (Italian: tornanti; German Spitzkehren) on the northern ramp is one of the most famous Alpine Mountain passes *Transf\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015fan in the Romanian Carpathians (Fagaras Mountains), famous for its hairpin bends * In rallying, the cars slide sideways around hairpins in spectacular style, such as at the Col de Turini of the Monte Carlo Rally *Hillclimbing is a special kind of automobile racing mainly held of mountain roads with hairpins, which keeps average speeds lower than on tracks * In bicycle racing, climbs up mountains roads with many U-turns are considered the most difficult, and often feature in Tour de France, Giro d'Italia, Tour de Suisse and also Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a * The roads above Monaco, on the foothills of the Alps; also seen in Hitchcock's To Catch a Thief and the Loews Hairpin at the Circuit de Monaco * The road between Lysefjord and the mountain plateau has 27 hairpin bends * The Trollstigen road in Rauma, Norway, from \u00c5ndalsnes to Valldal has 11 characteristic bends.Statens vegvesen, M\u00f8re og Romsdal (2001): Vegminner i M\u00f8re og Romsdal fylke.

Due to the mountainous profile of the country, many public streets in Greece have tight bends. The asphalt is also slippery in these areas, making it easy to lose traction (and thus control). The situation worsens with the first rains after the long dry summer, making the asphalt more slippery than usual. * The Veleta access road in Granada, Spain is the highest paved road in Europe === North America === One of the most famous NASCAR tracks with hairpin turns was the old Riverside International Raceway in Riverside, California WA 129 in Joseph Canyon Shafer Trail Road in Canyonlands National Park * USA - city streets: ** Winters Street (Sacramento, California) ** Vermont Street (San Francisco, California) ** Lombard Street (San Francisco, California) ** Snake Alley (Burlington, Iowa) ** Mountain Road (Jersey City, New Jersey) ** Shippen Street (Weehawken, New Jersey) * US Highways: ** US 6 through Loveland Pass over the Continental Divide in Colorado (N39.65726, W105.87456) ** US 44/NY 55 on the east face of the Shawangunk Ridge in Gardiner (N41.73803, W74.18433). ** US 93 used to be on both the Nevada and Arizona sides of Hoover Dam, though these sections were bypassed by a new highway alignment and bridge south of the dam that opened in 2010 (N36.01612, W114.73716) ** US 250 between the West Virginia border and West Augusta, Virginia (N38.44073, W79.63908) ** US 129 around the Tennessee/North Carolina border, 318 curves in (N35.47612, W83.91830) ** US 191 (Coronado Trail Scenic Byway) in Arizona between Morenci and Alpine), has a few switchbacks and about 460 curves.(N33.16616, W109.36697) ** US 441 through Great Smoky Mountains National Park on the Tennessee/North Carolina border.

WRC car taking a hairpin turn during 2007 Rallye Deutschland * Fairmont Hotel Hairpin is the slowest turn in Formula One * Many venues used for motor racing incorporate hairpin turns in the racecourse even if the terrain is relatively level. In this case the purpose is to provide a greater challenge to the drivers, to increase overtaking opportunities or simply increase the lap length without increasing the area occupied by the track. * Martinsville Speedway is a paper clip shaped short track on the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series circuit, measuring around in length. * The eleventh turn at Sonoma Raceway is a hairpin turn used in NASCAR. * Turn 14 at the Shanghai International Circuit, taken at just 65 km/h (40 mph). ==Bicycles== The eastern ramp of the Liniebrug, a bike and footbridge built over the Amsterdam- Rhine Canal near Nigtevecht in the Netherlands in 2018, consists of a pair of hairpin bends. == Railways == If a railway curves back on itself like a hairpin turn, it is called a horseshoe curve. However, the radius of curvature is much larger than that of a typical road hairpin. See this example at Zlatoust or Hillclimbing for other railway ascent methods. == Skiing == Sections known as hairpins are also found in the slalom discipline of alpine skiing. A hairpin consists of two consecutive vertical or \"closed gates\" which must be negotiated very quickly. Three or more consecutive closed gates are known as a flush. == See also == * Dead Man's Curve * Spiral bridge == References == == External links == Category:Motorsport terminology Category:Road transport Category:Road hazards ",
