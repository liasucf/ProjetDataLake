    "text": "\"No Aphrodisiac\" is the third single by Australian rock group the Whitlams, from their third album, Eternal Nightcap. It was released as a CD maxi, with three B-sides and a remix version of the lead track, on 14 December 1997 and peaked at No. 59 on the Australian Singles Chart. The lead track was written by the band's founding mainstay, Tim Freedman, together with Pinky Beecroft (Matt Ford) and Chit Chat Von Loopin Stab (Glen Dormand): both from the band, Machine Gun Fellatio. It was produced by Freedman with Rob Taylor. \"No Aphrodisiac\" won Song of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998. The lead track is the band's most well known song on national youth radio station, Triple J: it was listed at No. 1 on their Hottest 100 for 1997. Former Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam, for whom the band was named, announced news of their win on air. One of its B-sides is \"Gough\". Machine Gun Fellatio provided a re-mix of \"No Aphrodisiac\" for the remixes version of the single. ==Details== \"No Aphrodisiac\" was written for Freedman's then- girlfriend, who was living in Melbourne, while he was in Sydney. He later recalled, \"We were growing apart, not writing to each other so much... Pinky Beecroft and Chit Chat had just played me a demo of theirs, which consisted of very funny personal classifieds, and we used 6 lines of that to finish the song.\" One of the lyric lines is \"truth, beauty and a picture of you\", Freedman later explained \"their role in the song is just to be comedic. I'm saying 'I miss you but the universe will turn me on in your absence'. Truth of course doesn't exist, and beauty is all.\" AllMusic's Jonathan Lewis felt it was \"a melancholy, piano-driven song about long-distance relationships\". According to Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald, it was \"A ballad about infidelity, or even masturbation \u2013 'there's no aphrodisiac like loneliness' \u2013 it became a national love-song request. The single was released independently by Freedman's own label, had no film clip, no commercial radio airplay and no marketing budget.\" \"No Aphrodisiac\" won Song of the Year at the ARIA Music Awards of 1998 and was also nominated for Single of the Year but lost out to Natalie Imbruglia's cover version of \"Torn\". The track was performed by the band at a ceremony in Sydney before the Millennium. It was also performed live during the closing ceremony of the Sydney 2000 Paralympic Games. The single mix version adds more electric guitar and is almost a minute shorter than the album version. This version does not appear on the band's 2008 compilation album, Truth, Beauty and a Picture of You \u2013 the title is a line from the lyrics \u2013 instead the album version was used, which was also the preferred radio version. ==Track listings== There are four releases of the \"No Aphrodisiac\" single, one that consists of different mixes of the lead track and three versions which have different bonus tracks as detailed below: CD- Maxi: BYO-E8 (C) / EAN 9398603201025 (14 December 1997) # No Aphrodisiac (single mix) \u2013 3:32 # Winter Lovin' \u2013 3:22 # 1995 \u2013 4:44 # Charlie No.3 \u2013 4:24 # No Aphrodisiac (edit#1 mix) \u2013 3:28 BYO-E8 \"No Aphrodisiac \u2013 The Remixes\" (1998) # No Aphrodisiac (Single mix) \u2013 3:29 # No Aphrodisiac (Room for your Dog mix) \u2013 5:54 # No Aphrodisiac (Machine Gun Fellatio mix) \u2013 4:23 # No Aphrodisiac (Headspace Caisidorpha mix) \u2013 5:25 # No Aphrodisiac (Album mix) \u2013 4:20 BYO-E8 (A) \"No Aphrodisiac\" (1998) # No Aphrodisiac (single mix) \u2013 3:29 # Gough \u2013 3:16 # Met My Match \u2013 3:36 # Up Against the Wall \u2013 5:28 # No Aphrodisiac (edit#1 mix) \u2013 3:28 BYO-E8 (B) # No Aphrodisiac (single mix) \u2013 3:29 # Where is She \u2013 4:17 # I Make Hamburgers \u2013 3:36 # You Sound Like Louis Burdett \u2013 4:01 # No Aphrodisiac (edit#1 mix) \u2013 3:28 ==Awards and nominations== |- | rowspan=\"3\" | 1998 | rowspan=\"2\" | ARIA Music Awards of 1998 | Song of the Year | |- | Single of the Year | |- | APRA Music Awards of 1998 | Song of the Year | |} ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1997\u20132000) !Peak position |- !scope=\"row\"|Australia (ARIA) |59 |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Official site Category:1997 singles Category:1997 songs Category:ARIA Award-winning songs Category:Songs written by Tim Freedman Category:The Whitlams songs ",
