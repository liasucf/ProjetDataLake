The station opened on 25 July 2014, along with the Eski\u015fehir-Istanbul portion of the high-speed railway and is for the moment one of three railway stations in Turkey to be dedicated to high-speed rail. Boz\u00fcy\u00fck YHT has three tracks served by two platforms and two tracks in the middle for passing trains. Prior to the opening of the high- speed railway, the now indefinitely closed Boz\u00fcy\u00fck station, located in the center of the town, was serviced by many trains running from Istanbul to Ankara and points beyond. This older railway station is expected to re-open to passenger traffic, once the construction of the Marmaray commuter rail system in Istanbul is finished and Intercity train services resume. ==Station Layout== ==References== ==External links== *Boz\u00fcy\u00fck YHT station information Category:Railway stations in Bilecik Province Category:Boz\u00fcy\u00fck District Category:High-speed railway stations in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in Bilecik Province Category:Transport in Bilecik Province Category:Railway stations opened in 2014 Category:2014 establishments in Turkey ",
