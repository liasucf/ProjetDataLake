    "text": "The Gladstein Fellowship is a program operated by the Jewish Theological Seminary allowing selected students of the seminary to serve in the capacity of rabbi of a selected congregation. Congregations selected by JTS to benefit from the Gladstein Fellowship program are offered three Gladstein fellows each for a two-year period for a total of six years with the option of hiring any of the fellows to a permanent position. Gladstein fellows normally visit the congregations for which they are selected monthly, are available to congregants by phone and email at other times, and receive a stipend in exchange for their services. ==History== The Gladstein Fellowship program was founded by Ned and Jane Gladstein in 2003. The first congregation to benefit from the program was Loudon Jewish Congregation in Leesburg, Virginia.http://njjewishnews.com/njjn.com/100506/mwNCaldwellPhilanthropists.html ==List of benefiting congregations== {|class=wikitable !Congregation name !Location !Years !Fellows |- |Sha\u2019are Shalom |Leesburg, Virginia | |Michael Ragozin |- |Beth Shalom |Lake Norman, North Carolina | |Adam Baldachin (2011\u201313)http://www.huntersvilleherald.com/news/2011/8/4/2520/new-galdstein- fellow-joins-beth-shalom-of-lake-norman |- |Beth Sholom |Frederick, Maryland |2013- |Jordan Hersh (2013\u201315)http://m.fredericknewspost.com/your_life/life_news_collection/religion/beth- sholom-welcomes-visiting- rabbi/article_3c2d365a-ee6d-5c69-a642-aabc1604abd8.html?mode=jqm |- |New Stoke Newington Shul |London, England |2013-2015 |Roni Tabick (2013\u201315)http://www.masorti.org.uk/newsblog/newsblog/news-single/article/meet- the-rabbi-rabbi-roni-tabick.html#.Vq9Rc4-cHIU(Roni became synagogue's rabbi after ordination in 2015) |- |Chevrei Tzedek Congregation |Baltimore, Maryland |2015-2019 |Emily Barton (2015\u201317);http://www.jtsa.edu/jts-partners-with- congregation-chevrei-tzedek-to-expand-gladstein-fellowship-in-entrepreneurial- lead Rory Katz (2017-2019 and hired after ordination)http://www.chevreitzedek.org/our-rabbi.html |- |- |Congregation Eitz Chaim |Monroe, New York |2016\u2013Present |Louis Polisson (2016-2018)https://www.templeisraelcenter.org/About_Us/Who_We_Are/Clergy ;http://www.recordonline.com/news/20161011/rabbi-polisson-to-join-monroe- congregation Ariana Siegel (2018\u2013present) |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== *General information and timeline of the Gladstein Fellowship Category:Conservative Judaism in the United States Category:Internship programs Category:Jewish education ",
