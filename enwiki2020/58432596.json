    "text": "Fujiwara no Nagaie (; 26 September 1005 \u2013 19 December 1064) was a Japanese nobleman and waka poet of the Heian period. == Life == Fujiwara no Nagaie was born on the 20th day of the eighth month of Kank\u014d 2 (26 September 1005 in the Julian calendar), to Fujiwara no Michinaga and His adoptive mother was Michinaga's principal wife (\u6b63\u5ba4) . He was the sixth and youngest of Michinaga's sons. He was fawned over by his father, adoptive mother, eldest sister Sh\u014dshi and eldest brother Yorimichi. Nagaie lived for a long period in the Mikohidari manor on Sanj\u014d Avenue, from which he acquired the nicknames Sanj\u014d (\u4e09\u6761) and Mikohidari (\u5fa1\u5b50\u5de6). At the height of his career, immediately before his death, he held the position of Provisional Senior Counselor and the Senior Second Rank. On the 25th day of the tenth month of K\u014dhei 7 (5 December 1064) he took the tonsure as a result of illness. He died shortly thereafter, on the ninth day of the eleventh month of K\u014dhei 7 (19 December 1064). He was sixty years old, by Japanese reckoning. === Descendants === Nagaie was the founder of the famous Mikohadari lineage of waka poets, which included his son Tadaie, grandson Toshitada, great-grandson Shunzei and great-great-grandson Fujiwara no Teika. == Poetry == Nagaie was a patron of the poetic arts, which were seen as a key element in the education of the ruling class. He hosted poetic gatherings, including uta-awase contests and meetings for the composition of both waka and kanshi, at his residence. He participated in a number of uta- awase at the palace, notably acting as the poetic arbiter (\u6b4c\u64b0\u8005) of the right team (\u53f3\u65b9) at the K\u014dg\u014dg\u016b Shunj\u016b Uta-awase (\u7687\u540e\u5bae\u6625\u79cb\u6b4c\u5408) in Tengi 4 (1056). 43 of his waka were included in imperial anthologies from the Gosh\u016bi Wakash\u016b on. He supposedly produced a kash\u016b (personal collection), but this does not survive. == Notes == == References == === Citations === === Works cited === * * * * Category:Waka poets Category:11th-century Japanese poets Category:Kuge Category:1005 births Category:1064 deaths ",
