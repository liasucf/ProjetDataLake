Later, I understood that when he opened his mouth it was only to say meaningful things. With him, I went from the level of a Sup 'Aero student to the highest level the profession.\" On November 27, 1940, Marcel Bloch gave him a letter, for the Association des anciens \u00e9l\u00e8ves de Sup'A\u00e9ro: > My dear comrades, if the time is difficult, do not despair of the future. > (...)

(...) \"No doubt that the > government of the French state in a rebuilt Europe will keep our country > from aircraft production amounts to our technique and our geographical > position in the world.
