She was founder of the Dorset Wildlife Trust. ==Early life and education== Helen Brotherton was born at Harscott in Lincolnshire, and raised at Leamington Spa, the daughter of Eric and Helen Jakeman Brotherton. She trained as a teacher at Roehampton.Michael J. Allen, \"Brotherton, Helen Alice Jane (1914\u20132009)\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (Oxford University Press, Jan 2013; online edition, May 2013). Brownsea Island Sign ==Career== Her first teaching job was at Norwich High School for Girls. During World War II, she joined the Women's Voluntary Service, and eventually ran the Sick Bays in Warwickshire, for which she received the British Empire Medal in 1943. She moved to Poole, Dorset, after the war, to care for her aging mother. An avid birdwatcher, she volunteered with the Dorset Field Ornithology Group, and through that group came to know the specific environmental issues in Dorset. She sailed her own boat to Brownsea Island for explorations, against the ban on public access, issued and enforced by the island's reclusive owner, Mary Bonham-Christie.Sophie Campbell, \"The Island that was Saved by a Demon\" Telegraph Travel (28 July 2007). In the early 1960s, after Bonham-Christie's death, Brotherton organized a group to oppose development on Brownsea Island, because the planned development would threaten a wading birds habitat. Because of her group's efforts, the National Trust took ownership of Brownsea, and the group developed into the Dorset Wildlife Trust.Hester Lacey, \"Brownsea-Dorset Island Life\" Kent Life (19 February 2010), Retrieved 24 August 2016 Helen Brotherton was the Trust's first and longtime secretary. In 1963, she was awarded an OBE for her environmental work.Stephen Moss, \"Obituary: Helen Brotherton\" The Guardian (30 August 2009). Brotherton worked with the coastal protection project \"Operation Neptune\" as the National Trust's regional representative in Wessex. In 1984, she was appointed a CBE for this activism. She founded the Portland Bird Observatory, was a trustee of the Chesil and Fleet Trust. In 1992, she received the Christopher Cadbury medal from the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, and in 2007 she won the Octavia Hill medal for her lifetime achievements in environmental conservation.\"Wildlife Champion Passes Away\" Dorset Wildlife Trust (6 August 2009). ==Personal life and legacy== As a side interest, Helen Brotherton contributed funds to the Salisbury Diocesan Guild of Ringers, to purchase bells in memory of her brother, Roderic Brotherton, who died in World War II.Salisbury Diocesan Guild of Ringers, Face to Face Newsletter (Autumn 2009): 19.
