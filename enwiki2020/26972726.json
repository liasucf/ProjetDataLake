He began World War I with this unit, but transferred to aviation in November 1916. He flew two-seaters a bit, then joined Jagdstaffel 12 in late 1917. In early January 1918, he transferred to Jagdstaffel 15 to fly a Fokker Triplane. He scored for the first time on 9 January 1918. On the 29th, he got a confirmed win but had a second one not confirmed. He switched squadrons to Jagdstaffel 18. Between 27 March and 13 September, he shot down and destroyed five more opponents. Between 9:00 and 9:15 AM on 14 September, M\u00fcller shot down three Spad XIIIs from the American 13th Aero Squadron . At 2:40 PM that same afternoon, he shot down a fourth Spad from that same squadron. A week later, he finished his tally with one last Spad. ==Post World War I== Hans M\u00fcller, at some point, had a neighbor with that identical name. The aviator changed his last name to Garrelt to obviate confusion in their mail delivery.The Aerodrome website http://www.theaerodrome.com/aces/germany/muller1.php Retrieved on 15 April 2010 During World War II, M\u00fcller served on the staff of Luftflotte 3 of the Luftwaffe.
