    "text": "23 Parachute Engineer Regiment is a Royal Engineers regiment in the British Army that was formed in 2003. It provides engineer support to 16 Air Assault Brigade in both the parachute and air assault role. The regiment is currently based at Rock Barracks in Suffolk and consists of three regular squadrons and one Army Reserve squadron. As part of 16 Air Assault Brigade it can be called upon to deploy on operations across the globe at extremely short notice. ==History== 23 Engineer Regiment can trace its roots to the founding of the airborne forces of the Parachute Regiment and other related during World War II. In July 1948, 23rd Field Engineer Regiment was formed in Iserlohn from the former 2nd Division Divisional Engineer regiment. In December 1948, the regiment moved to Halen and two years later moved to Dortmund. In September of 1957, 2 Field Squadron was allocated to 6th Infantry Brigade and 5 Field Squadron to the 5th Infantry Brigade. In May of 1958, the regiment was split and its headquarters became the new \"Headquarters Royal Engineers, 2nd Division\". Eleven years later in April of 1969, it was re-organised into the new 23 Engineer Regiment at Osnabruck. The regiment served as infantry in Northern Ireland from March - July of 1972. In September of 1976 the 2nd Division was re-organized as the new 2nd Armoured Division, and the regiment was broken up for the second time. In January 1983 at Osnabruck the regiment reformed and part of the regiment, 73 Field and 39 Field Support Squadrons, participated in the Gulf War. The regiment was later disbanded in 1992 as a result of the Options for Change. In 2001, 23 Engineer Regiment was tasked to provide engineer support to the newly formed 16 Air Assault Brigade. The regiment was deployed for Operation Herrick and in September 2009 on their return from Afghanistan the regiment was granted the Freedom of the town of Woodbridge. In 2015, the \"Parachute\" title was officially added to the name, although the unit had already been supporting 16 Air Assault Brigade since its re-establishment, and a new flag was presented to the regiment to mark the occasion. ==Organization== * 23 Parachute Engineer Regiment ** 12 Parachute HQ & Support Squadron ** 9 Parachute Squadron ** 51 Parachute Squadron ** 299 Parachute Squadron (Army Reserve), in Wakefield, Hull and Gateshead ==References== ==External links== *23 Parachute Engineer Regiment Category:Airborne units and formations of the United Kingdom Category:Regiments of the Royal Engineers Category:2003 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Military units and formations established in 2003 Category:Royal Engineers ",
