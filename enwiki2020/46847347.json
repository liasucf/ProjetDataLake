    "text": "Turkish conquests, and remains of Hungarian Kingdom by 1572, including upper Slavonia and Croatia The Eparchy of Mar\u010da () refers to two historical ecclesiastical entities: Eastern Orthodox eparchy and Eastern Catholic vicariate. The term vas derived from the name of the monastery at Mar\u010da (today Stara Mar\u010da) near Ivani\u0107-Grad, Habsburg Monarchy (present-day Zagreb County, Republic of Croatia). Although Serbian Orthodox bishop Simeon Vratanja traveled to Rome in 1611 and formally accepted jurisdiction of the Pope over this bishopric, until 1670 Serb bishops continued to recognize the jurisdiction of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107 and struggled against conversion attempts by Roman Catholic bishops from Zagreb. This semi-union existed until the 1670 appointment of Pavle Zor\u010di\u0107 as bishop. All Serb Orthodox clergy who objected to the union were arrested and sentenced to life in prison in Malta where they died. The bishopric eventually became the Eastern Catholic Eparchy of Kri\u017eevci. ==Name== The name Mar\u010da was derived from the name of the nearby hill, Mar\u010da. Other names used for this bishopric include Svidnik (Svidni\u010dka eparhija), Vretanija (Vretanijska eparhija), and the \"Uskok\" bishopric. == Background == After the Ottoman capture of Smederevo fortress in 1459 and fall of Bosnia 1463 different populations of Orthodox Christians moved into Syrmia and by 1483 perhaps 200,000 Orthodox Christians moved into central Slavonia and Syrmia: \"Population movements began in earnest after the Battle of Smederevo in 1459, and by 1483, up to two hundred thousand Orthodox Christians had moved into central Slavonia and Srijem (eastern Croatia).\" Miller, Nicholas John, 1997, Between Nation and State,{ \"Each wave was distinct: different populations, provoked by different causes, made their way to new homes. The first groups of settlers were pushed northward by the Ottoman conquests of Serbia after the Battle of Smederevo in 1459 and the fall of Bosnia in 1463. Orthodox Christians moved into Srijem thereafter. By 1483, perhaps two hundred thousand had moved into central Slavonia and Srijem\" } https://books.google.hr/books?id=huXruAEACAAJ&dq;=Between+Nation+and+State+:+Serbian+Politics+in+Croatia+Before+the+First+World&hl;=hr&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwiy6_nE94znAhXupIsKHeMVC80Q6AEIKTAA #page=6 At the beginning of the 16th century settlements of Orthodox Christians were also established in western Croatia.: \"In the early sixteenth century Orthodox populations had also been established in western Croatia.\" In the first half of the 16th century Serbs settled Ottoman part of Slavonia while in the second part of the 16th century they moved to Austrian part of Slavonia. In 1550 they established the Lepavina Monastery.As Vlach settlements by name and signature we find marked Mali i Veliki Poganac (Poganetz) which was mentioned as Vlach settlement in year 1610. and Lepavina (Lipavina) and Mar\u010da Monastery Kartografski izvori za povijest etnokonfesionalnih odnosa na podru\u010dju Vara\u017edinskog generalata i dijela Kri\u017eeva\u010dke \u017eupanije, Mirela Slukan Alti\u0107, Vol. 7 No. 13, 2008. https://hrcak.srce.hr/78016 #page43 At the end of the 16th century a group of Serb Orthodox priests built a monastery dedicated to Saint Archangel Gabriel () on the foundations (or near them) of the deserted and destroyed Catholic Monastery of All Saints. === Eparchy of Vretanija=== Some scholars promoted the view that Mar\u010da, as a diocese of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107, was established in the late 16th century (1578 or 1597). This theory was used as evidence of the long-time presence of the Serb population on the northern bank of river Sava. In 1609 Serb Orthodox priests established Mar\u010da Monastery in Mar\u010da near Ivani\u0107-Grad. In the same year the Mar\u010da Monastery became a seat of the Eparchy of Vretanija. This bishopric was the westernmost eparchy of the Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107. Its name was derived from Vretanija () which was a part of the title of the Serbian Patriarch. Its first bishop was Simeon Vratanja, appointed in 1609 by the Serbian Orthodox patriarch Jovan to the position of bishop of all Orthodox Serbs who settled to Croatia. This appointment marked establishment of the Eparchy of Vretanja in 1609 according to historian Aleksa Ivi\u0107. ==Establishment as Eastern Catholic Church== Being under strong pressure from Croatian clergy and state officials to recognize the jurisdiction of the Pope, and to convert the population of his bishopric to Eastern Catholicism, Simeon Vratanja visited Pope Paul V in 1611 and recognized his jurisdiction and maybe the Union of Florence as well.Milutin Miltojevi\u0107, Serbian Historiography of Union of Serbs in the 17th century, Ni\u0161 University, p. 225 The strongest influence to his decision had Martin Dobrovi\u0107, who convinced Simeon to recognize papal jurisdiction and to accept the Eastern Catholicism. In November 1611, the Pope appointed Simeon as bishop of Serbs of Slavonia, Croatia and Hungary. He also granted all estates that once belonged to the Catholic Monastery of All Saints to the Mar\u010da Monastery. On 21 November 1611 Mar\u010da was established as an eparchy (bishopric) of the Eastern Catholic Church,Z.

Vinkovi\u0107's activities were aimed against Serb bishop of Mar\u010da, Maksim Predojevi\u0107, whom he reported to the Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith when Predojevi\u0107 refused to support the conversion of the population of his bishopric to Catholicism. Vinkovi\u0107 had intention to depose Predojevi\u0107 and appoint Rafael Levakovi\u0107 instead. In 1648 the king appointed Sava Stanislavi\u0107 as bishop of the Bishopric of Mar\u010da, as wished by the Slavonian Serbs, although Petar Petreti\u0107, bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Zagreb proposed another candidate. This kind of semi-union attitude of Serb bishops of the Bishopric of Mar\u010da remained until 1670 and appointment of Pavle Zor\u010di\u0107 on the position of bishop.Milutin Miltojevi\u0107, Serbian Historiography of Union of Serbs in the 17th century, Ni\u0161 University, p. 225 All priests of the Bishopric of Mar\u010da who objected to the union were arrested and imprisoned in Malta where they all died.Milutin Miltojevi\u0107, Serbian Historiography of Union of Serbs in the 17th century, Ni\u0161 University, p. 225 ===Period of union (1670\u20131753)=== In 1754 around 17,000 Serb Uskoks rebelled in support of the Mar\u010da monastery, the seat of Uskok bishopric. The monastery was abandoned, as ordered by Empress Maria Theresa, and its treasury was looted. ==Bishops== The bishops of the Eparchy of Mar\u010da were: * Simeon Vratanja (1607\u20131629) * Maxim Predojevi\u0107 (1630\u20131642) * Gabrijel Predojevi\u0107 (1642\u20131644) * Vasilije Predojevi\u0107 (1644\u20131648) * Sava Stanislavi\u0107 (1648\u20131661) * Gabrijel Mijaki\u0107 (1663\u20131670) * Pavao Zor\u010di\u0107 (1671\u20131685) * Marko Zor\u010di\u0107 (1685\u20131688) * Isaija Popovi\u0107 (1689\u20131699) * Gabrijel Tur\u010dinovi\u0107 (1700\u20131707) * Grgur Jugovi\u0107 (1707\u20131709) * Rafael Markovi\u0107 (1710\u20131726) * Georg Vu\u010dini\u0107 (1727\u20131733) * Silvester Ivanovi\u0107 (1734\u20131735) * Teofil Pa\u0161i\u0107 (1738\u20131746) * Gabrijel Palkovi\u0107 (1751\u20131758) * Vasilije Bo\u017ei\u010dkovi\u0107 (1759\u20131777) ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * * * * * * * == Further reading == * * * * * Category:History of the Serbian Orthodox Church in Croatia Category:Eastern Catholic dioceses in Europe Category:Greek Catholic Church of Croatia and Serbia Category:1611 establishments in Europe Category:1753 disestablishments ",
