    "text": "Sam Zeloof (born ) is an American autodidact who at the age of 17 constructed a home microchip fabrication facility in his garage. In 2018 he produced the first homebrew lithographically fabricated microchip, the Zeloof Z1, a PMOS dual differential amplifier chip. His work takes inspiration from Jeri Ellsworth's 'Cooking with Jeri' which demonstrates a homebrew transistor and logic gate fabrication process. ==References== Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American electronics engineers Category:American inventors ",
