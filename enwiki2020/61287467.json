During late Warring States period and Qin dynasty, the region was part of Jiuyuan Commandery (\u4e5d\u539f\u90e1), which was possibly established during King Wuling of Zhao's reign after a successful campaign against the Linhu (\u6797\u80e1) and Loufan (\u6a13\u7169) peoples.Records of the Grand Historian, Chapter 43. The Xiongnu controlled the region after the fall of Qin dynasty. In 127 BC, general Wei Qing of Han dynasty attacked Xiongnu and conquered Hetao. Wuyuan Commandery was subsequently established on part of the newly gained land.Book of Han, Chapter 64. In late Western Han dynasty, the commandery administered 16 counties, including Jiuyuan (\u4e5d\u539f), Guling (\u56fa\u9675), Wuyuan (\u4e94\u539f), Linwo (\u81e8\u6c83), Wenguo (\u6587\u570b), Heyin (\u6cb3\u9670), Puze (\u84b1\u6fa4), Nanxing (\u5357\u8208), Wudu (\u6b66\u90fd), Yiliang (\u5b9c\u6881), Manbai (\u66fc\u67cf), Chengyi (\u6210\u5b9c), Guyang (\u7a12\u967d), Mopang (\u83ab\u5e9e), Xi'anyang (\u897f\u5b89\u967d) and Hemu (\u6cb3\u76ee). The population was 231,328, or 39,322 households in 2 AD.Book of Han, Chapter 28. During Eastern Han dynasty, the counties Guling, Puze, Nanxing, Guyang, Mopang and Hemu were abolished. The population in 140 AD was 22,957, or 4,667 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 113. Toward the end Han dynasty, the area's population decreased sharply as residents fled from invading northern nomadic peoples, and the commandery was dissolved.Book of Jin, Chapter 14. ==References== Category:Commanderies of the Han dynasty ",
