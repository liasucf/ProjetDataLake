    "text": "The Jushi (), or Gushi (), were a people who established a kingdom during the 1st millennium BC in the Turpan basin (modern Xinjiang, China).Jan Romgard, \u201cAncient Human Settlements in Xinjiang and the Early Silk Road Trade\u201d Sino- Platonic Papers, 185 (November, 2008) The kingdom included the area of Ayding Lake, in the eastern Tian Shan range. During the late 2nd and early 1st century BC, the area was increasingly dominated by the Han Dynasty and the northern neighbours of the Jushi, the Xiongnu, and became one of the many minor states of the Western Regions of Han dynasty China. The Jushi capital (Jiaohe, later known as Yarkhoto, and Yarghul) was destroyed in a Mongol attack in the 13th century. Contemporary Chinese sources suggest that the Jushi were Caucasoid in appearance. They may have been one of the Tocharian peoples and spoken one of the associated languages. ==Historical accounts== According to J. P. Mallory and Victor H. Mair, the earliest accounts of the Jushi report them to have \"lived in tents, followed the grasses and waters, and had considerable knowledge of agriculture. They owned cattle, horses, camels, sheep and goats. They were proficient with bows and arrows\". Jushi and the kingdom of Kror\u00e4n were linked in the account of Zhang Qian (d. 113 BC), in part because both were under the control of the Xiongnu. In or about 60 BC, the Han\u2014ruled at the time by Emperor Xuan\u2014defeated Xiongnu forces at the Battle of Jushi, during the Han\u2013Xiongnu War. Afterwards the main part of the Jushi lands was divided into two states: a southern area controlled by the Han, who referred to it as \u201cNearer Jushi\u201d (or \"Anterior Jushi\"), and a northern area known to the Han as \u201cFurther Jushi\" (or \"Posterior Jushi\") that was dominated by the Xiongnu. Nearer Jushi was administered by the Han from a capital at Jiaohe (16 kilometres west of the site of modern Turpan). The capital of Further Jushi appears to have been called Yuli or Yulai, and was located about 10 km north of Jimasa, 200 km north of Jiaohe.Fan Ye , Chronicle on the 'Western Regions' from the Hou Hanshu. (transl. John E. Hill), 2011] \"Based on a report by General Ban Yong to Emperor An (107\u2013125 CE) near the end of his reign, with a few later additions.\" (20 December 2015) The Jushi never regained their independence. ==Archaeology== A 2,700-year-old grave discovered in 2008 at the Yanghai Tombs, an ancient cemetery (54,000 m2 in area), has been attributed to the Jushi or a precursor culture. The grave contains the remains of a shaman who had blue eyes and light-coloured hair. Near the shaman's head and foot were a large leather basket and wooden bowl filled 789 grams of dried cannabis, superbly preserved by climatic and burial conditions. An international team demonstrated that this material contained tetrahydrocannabinol, the psychoactive component of cannabis. The cannabis was clearly \"cultivated for psychoactive purposes,\" rather than as fibre for clothing or as food. It may have been employed as a medicinal agent, or an aid to divination. This is the oldest known use of cannabis as a pharmacological agent. The extremely dry conditions and alkaline soil acted as preservatives, allowing a team of scientists to carefully analyze the stash, which still looked green though it had lost its distinctive odour. ==See also== * Tarim mummies == References == === Citations === === Sources === * Hill, John E.
