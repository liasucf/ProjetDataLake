    "text": "\"Insatiable\" is a song by Prince and The New Power Generation, from the 1991 album Diamonds and Pearls.http://www.discogs.com/Prince-And-The-New-Power- Generation-Prince-Insatiable/release/1474407 It is a slow, simmering ballad that often draws comparisons to 1989's \"Scandalous!\". The B-side was \"I Love U in Me\", which was originally the B-side to \"The Arms of Orion\". \"Insatiable\" was only released in the US as a 7\" single, a 12\" promo was sent only to Urban radio stations, and the track was not released to Pop radio stations. It performed well on the R&B; chart, reaching number 3, but did not break the top 40 on the US Pop chart. Its single sales were moderate, and it received heavy airplay on Urban and UAC radio stations, but it did not make the Hot 100 Airplay (the R&B; airplay chart did not appear until spring 1992). ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (1992) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|77 |- |align=\"left\"|US Billboard Hot R&B; Songs |align=\"center\"|3 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:Prince (musician) songs Category:1991 singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Soul ballads Category:Songs written by Prince (musician) Category:Paisley Park Records singles Category:Warner Records singles Category:Song recordings produced by Prince (musician) Category:1991 songs ",
