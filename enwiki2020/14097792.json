    "text": "KRAJ (100.9 FM, \"100-9 The Heat\") is a commercial radio station that is licensed to Johannesburg, California, United States and serves the Antelope Valley area. The station is owned by Adelman Broadcasting and airs a rhythmic contemporary music format. ==History== KRAJ signed on at 103.9 FM (now KGBB) in August 1988 with an adult contemporary music format, branded as \"103.9 The Heat\",http://www.wtfda.org/vud90s/1990/09-90vud.pdf before moving to the new 100.9 license and frequency in October 1998. At that time, the station rebranded as \"The Zone\". The Zone sourced its programming primarily from Jones Radio Networks but also aired some shows hosted locally from a studio in Quartz Hill, California. In mid-2004, after KCEL (106.9 FM) dropped oldies in favor of a regional Mexican format, KRAJ began broadcasting Jones' nationally syndicated Good Time Oldies format. For a few months after KRAJ's format change, the station held over its local specialty shows from the Zone era but later replaced them with syndicated programs that were originally carried by KCEL. In 2005, KFXM-LP, a low-power FM station in Lancaster, California, signed on with an oldies format. With a significant portion of KRAJ's audience migrating to KFXM with its stronger signal, KRAJ dropped oldies in favor of a rhythmic contemporary format called \"100.9 The Party Station\". Adelman moved Good Time Oldies to KLOA (1240 AM) \u2014 a station that cannot be received clearly in the Antelope Valley. In July 2006, Adelman Broadcasting hired Dan Garite (formerly of KOCP and KCAQ in Oxnard-Ventura, California) as program director and morning drive co-host. Retaining the hip-hop format, KRAJ rebranded as \"100-9 The Heat\". In mid-2008, the station hired Craig EC as program director; he adjusted the format to feature more mainstream pop while continuing to emphasize rhythmic content. ==References== ==External links== * * RAJ Category:Rhythmic contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations established in 1998 Category:1998 establishments in California ",
