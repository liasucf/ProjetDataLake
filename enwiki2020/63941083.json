While experiencing writer's block, he hesitantly calls his ex-girlfriend Jessie, who fled the effects of the pandemic in New York City and is under lockdown in Kerala. After the phone call, Karthik resumes his writing and composes Kamal & Kadambari \u2013 A Love Story. == Cast == *Silambarasan as Karthik Sivakumar *Trisha as Jessie Thekekuttu == Production == The film was primarily shot using an iPhone. == Reception == Kirubhakar Purushothaman of Cinema Express said, \"The filmmaking is minimalistic with not-so-seamless cuts. Of course, one is expected to cut slack for the film given the immense constraints the team has made this under. But it's a paradox when you realise there would have been no Karthik Dial Seytha Yenn without the coronavirus or the constraints.\" == References == == External links == * Category:2020 films Category:Films about the COVID-19 pandemic Category:Films directed by Gautham Menon Category:Indian films Category:Indian romantic drama films Category:Indian sequel films Category:Indian short films Category:2020s Tamil-language films Category:2020 romantic drama films Category:2020 short films ",
