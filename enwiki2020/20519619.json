This album produced Mattea's first Top Ten country hit in \"Love at the Five and Dime\", which reached #3 on the Billboard country charts. Following this song were three more Top Ten hits: the title track at #10, \"You're the Power\" at #5, and \"Train of Memories\" at #6. \"Love at the Five and Dime\", which features backing vocals from Don Williams, was also recorded by Nanci Griffith on her 1986 album The Last of the True Believers. \"Song for the Life\" has been covered by several artists, and was originally recorded by Rodney Crowell on his 1977 debut Ain't Livin' Long Like This. This song would later be released in 1995 as a single by Alan Jackson. ==Track listing== #\"Walk the Way the Wind Blows\" (Tim O'Brien) \u2013 3:43 #\"Train of Memories\" (Andy Byrd, Jimbeau Hinson) \u2013 2:48 #\"Reason to Live\" (Joanne Christy, Johnny Pierce, Geoff Levin) \u2013 3:21 #\"Evenin'\" (Mitchell Parish, Harry White) \u2013 3:34 #\"Leaving West Virginia\" (Kathy Mattea) \u2013 3:43 #\"Love at the Five and Dime\" (Nanci Griffith) \u2013 3:36 #\"You Plant Your Fields\" (Wendy Waldman, Donny Lowery) \u2013 3:08 #\"Back Up Grinnin' Again\" (David Goodman) \u2013 3:02 #\"You're the Power\" (Craig Bickhardt, F.C.
