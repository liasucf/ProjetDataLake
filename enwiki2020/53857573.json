As a champion could not be crowned in time, the dates for the semi-finals were pushed back a week. Cove Rangers played 2017\u201318 Lowland Football League champions Spartans in the League Two play-off, winning 4\u20130 at home in the first leg. Cove went through on with a 5\u20132 aggregate win despite losing the second leg 2\u20131. This set up a final against Cowdenbeath. The first leg at Harlaw Park finished 0\u20130 before Cove lost 3\u20132 in the second leg at Central Park, meaning that Cowdenbeath were victorious on aggregate and retained their place in League Two. Cove would remain in the Highland League. ==References== Category:Highland Football League seasons 5 Scottish ",
