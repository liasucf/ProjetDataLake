    "text": "Pico das Agulhas Negras () is the fifth-highest mountain in Brazil, standing at above sea level, making it one of the highest in the Brazilian Highlands.IBGE Pontos Culminantes It is located in Itatiaia National Park, in the Serra da Mantiqueira range, on the border of the states of Rio de Janeiro and Minas Gerais. It is the highest point in the state of Rio de Janeiro, the third-highest peak in Minas Gerais, and the second-highest in the Mantiqueira range. The climb to the top was first attempted by Franklin Massena in 1856. Further attempts were made by Andr\u00e9 Rebou\u00e7as in 1878 and by Hor\u00e1cio de Carvalho in 1898, but the summit was only reached in 1919, by Carlos Spierling and Osvaldo Leal.DOCUMENTA\u00c7\u00c3O DE IMAGENS DE MONTANHA - PARTE 4 IMAGENS BRASILEIRAS - Blog do Dubois ==Etymology== Its name means Black Needles Peak, because of the sharp dark rocks on its top, which give it a distinctive shape. The peak's massif is known as Itatiaia, which means \"stone with many sharp points\" in Tupi. The highest rock, with the summit, is known as Itatiaia\u00e7u, or simply A\u00e7u (a Tupi suffix meaning \"big\") among Brazilian mountaineers. ==Geography== state of Rio de Janeiro, and the fifth-highest mountain in Brazil. Pico das Agulhas Negras can be seen to the northwest of Resende when driving between S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro on the Via Dutra highway, but this is only possible at a few points on the road, because a lower mountain range closer to the road stands in the line-of-sight at most other nearby spots. A mountain shelter called Abrigo Rebou\u00e7as is located near the base of the peak, at an elevation of about . It is accessible by a badly maintained gravel road (BR-485) from the BR-354 federal highway at the Garganta do Registro mountain pass, via Itatiaia National Park's north entrance. The access road reaches an altitude of at the entrance of the park, and a short spur from it leading to a communications tower of the Eletrobras Furnas electricity company reaches ; these are the highest points one can reach in a regular car (as opposed to off-road vehicles) in Brazil. ==Elevation measurements== Tourist information signs in Itatiaia National Park close to Pico das Agulhas Negras, with the peak in the background. For years, Pico das Agulhas Negras was thought to be the highest mountain in Brazil. The title later went to Pico da Bandeira, in the Capara\u00f3 range between the states of Minas Gerais and Esp\u00edrito Santo (now known to be at ). In 1965, it was found that Pico da Neblina, in the state of Amazonas, was, in fact, the highest, with a currently revised height of . Even then, Pico das Agulhas Negras was still thought to be the highest point in the Mantiqueira Mountains, until a 2001 GPS measurement (later confirmed by an official joint expedition of the Brazilian Army and the Brazilian Institute for Geography and Statistics - IBGE) showed that nearby Pedra da Mina was that mountain range's highest point at , about seven metres higher than Agulhas Negras. Pedra da Mina was higher even though Agulhas Negras was also found to be slightly higher than previously thought, at , rather than its previous official altitude of . Pico das Agulhas Negras remains the highest point in Rio de Janeiro state. In 2015, IBGE completed a new and more accurate mapping of the Brazilian territory regarding the geoid, the irregular imaginary surface based on the Earth's gravitational field that is the reference for altitude measurements. This led the institution to recalculate the altitude of the mountains measured in the earlier project, according to the new reference. The new data were published in February 2016. Pico das Agulhas Negras was then found to stand at , a difference of 61 cm or about two feet. == Notes == ==References== Category:Mountains of Brazil Category:Highest points of Brazilian states Category:Bornhardts Category:Landforms of Minas Gerais Category:Landforms of Rio de Janeiro (state) ",
