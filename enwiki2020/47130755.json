    "text": "Gnostikoi Ha-Shaitan is the first studio album by Finnish black metal band Saturnian Mist. It was recorded at three locations, Watercastle Studios, Desolate Star Studios and Ordo Templi Keliokis, during December 2010 - February 2011. The title is combination of Hebrew and Ancient Greek and it loosely translates: \"Those who are able to know the adversity\". According to Metal Rules interview of the band's vocalist Zetekh \"Adversity\" refers here to an archetype of the Devil and \"Gnostikoi\" means \"Those who are able to know\", derivative from the works of Plato and the term Gnosis. A music video was made from the album, from the track \u201dAura Mystica\u201d which was also serving as a directorial debut of Zetekh. ==Track listing== All lyrics written by fra.
