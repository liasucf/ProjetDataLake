    "text": "Freestyle skaters in action at Les Invalides, Paris Freestyle slalom skating is a highly technical field of roller skating that involves performing tricks around a straight line of equally spaced cones. The most common spacing used in competitions is , with larger competitions also featuring lines spaced at and .http://www.worldslalomseries.com/rules/ ==Equipment== Most freestyle slalomers use inline skates, although some use quad skates. Those who use inline skates tend to use a full rocker wheel configuration, however there are other variations of the rocker set-up which are used. Some skaters prefer to use a 'full hi-lo' rocker, which means the largest wheel is the second in from the back, with the smallest at the front. A common way to rocker your wheels is by putting larger wheels in the center and smaller wheels on each end. An example of this is having 80 mm wheels in the 2nd and 3rd position and 76 mm in the front and back. A short frame (230\u2013245 mm) is used to give the skate the maximum possible maneuverability. Inline skates used for slalom have a very tight fit with a strong cuff, to give sustained ankle support. Popular skates used in the past include the FSK skate range by Salomon, now unavailable. The market is now arguably dominated by Seba skates, formed by a world class slalom skater; other brands such as Powerslide and RollerBlade also offer popular slalom skate models. ==List of slalom moves== The list of basic moves from easiest to hardest.
