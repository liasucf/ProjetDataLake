    "text": "Aerial view by NASA Province Island () is an island mostly in the Canadian province of Qu\u00e9bec, but partly in the U.S. state of Vermont. It is situated in Lake Memphremagog. The island's area is 0.31 km\u00b2. Although 0.028 km\u00b2 (9%) at its southern point is part of the United States (Town of Derby, Orleans County in the state of Vermont), the greater part belongs to the municipality of Ogden, Quebec, in Memphr\u00e9magog Regional County Municipality, Quebec. At the end of the 18th century a pioneer named Martin Adams and his wife built a house on the island, where they grew flax and vegetables. It is under private ownership; a pheasant hunt is organized annually. The Canada\u2013United States border is marked by a five-meter strip cut through the forest. ==References== Category:Landforms of Estrie Category:Landforms of Orleans County, Vermont Category:Lake islands of Quebec Category:Lake islands of Vermont Category:International islands Category:Derby, Vermont Category:Magog, Quebec ",
