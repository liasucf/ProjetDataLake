There is very little information that has existed for Engke Khan and there are questions about the identity of Engke Khan: some scholars believed that Jorightu was Yes\u00fcder and Engke Khan was Yes\u00fcder's son succeeding him, while other believed that the two were the same person. His name \"Engke (Enkh) Khagan\" means \"Peaceful King\" in the Mongolian language. According to Mongolian historian J.Bor, Engke made an alliance with Timur against the Ming dynasty. An envoy of his met Engke for preparations all the way to China for his master's conquest. But Timur died while he was marching into China in 1405. ==See also== * List of khans of the Northern Yuan dynasty Category:1392 deaths Category:Northern Yuan rulers Category:14th- century Mongol rulers Category:Year of birth unknown ",
