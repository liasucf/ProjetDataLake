    "text": "The War and Treaty are an American husband and wife duo of Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount, formerly known as Trotter & Blount. ==Career== In 2016, Michael Trotter Jr. and Tanya Blount released the duet album Love Affair as Trotter & Blount. In the same year, the duo released the single \"Hi Ho\" as The War and Treaty. \"Hi Ho\" was described by Paste writer Chris Estey as 'the break out soul hit'. In 2017, The War and Treaty released the EP Down to the River, described as a mix of 'blues, gospel, soul, bluegrass, country' and heralded by Estey as 'a splendidly made immediate classic about conflict and redemption'. Estey describes 'in songs about personal turmoil and the dread at the end of time, every kind of fear and joy is addressed through gut-stirring and feet-moving anthems like \"Hit Dawg Will Holla\", \"Set My Soul On Fire\", and the title track. Yet the two can sensually help heal the wounds from those confessional blasts with a sweet ballad like \"Till The Mornin\u2019\" \u2014 they truly live up to the dynamic tension of their moniker.' In 2018, Rolling Stone reported The War and Treaty's debut album Healing Tide is due for release on August 10, 2018, describing the lead single as a 'joyfully relentless title track, reminiscent of classic Ike and Tina Turner rock-infused soul'. On September 25, 2020, The War and Treaty released their sophomore studio album, Hearts Town, on Rounder Records. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of albums, with selected chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"150\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" width=\"400\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\"| Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| US Curr.
