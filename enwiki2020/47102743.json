    "text": "This article features a listing of the top level professional minor league sports teams based in the United States. The minor leagues listed below also include five teams in Canada (one in the NBA G League and four in the American Hockey League). Triple-A minor league baseball has two leagues in the International League and Pacific Coast League. The United States Soccer Federation has had one top level league since 2018, when the league then known as the United Soccer League, now the USL Championship (USLC), was promoted to a Division II status after a provisional year with two Division II leagues. The North American Soccer League (NASL) contested their loss of Division II sanctioning but lost the case, canceling its 2018 season before effectively folding. There are no affiliated minor leagues for American or Canadian football as most of its recruiting is done through college football, and minor football leagues do not historically have long lifespans before folding. Teams that will join a league for a future season are indicated in italics. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Rank ! Metropolitan area ! Triple-A Baseball ! NBA G League ! American Hockey League !
