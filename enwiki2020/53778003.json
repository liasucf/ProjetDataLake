    "text": "One human poll made up the 2017 National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) football rankings, sometimes called the NAIA Coaches' Poll or the football ratings. When the regular season was complete, the NAIA conducted a playoff to determine the year's national champion. A final poll was taken after completion of the 2017 NAIA Football National Championship. ==Poll release dates== The poll released a spring edition of the rankings on April 10, 2017. A complete schedule of poll release dates will be: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\" |- !style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" \"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"2\"|2017 Poll Release Dates |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Spring || April 10 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Preseason || August 7 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 1 || September 11 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 2 || September 18 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" || Week 3 || September 25 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 4 || October 2 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 5 || October 9 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 6 || October 16 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" || Week 7 || October 23 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 8 || October 30 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 9 || November 6 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Week 10 (Final Regular Season) || November 12 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" || Postseason || December 19 |} ==Week by week poll== {| style=\"border:1px solid black;\" align=center |+ Legend |- | style=\"background:#ffffff; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"| | | No change in ranking |- | style=\"background:#D8FFEB; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"| | | Increase in ranking |- | style=\"background:#FFE6E6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"| | | Decrease in ranking |- | style=\"background:#FFFFE6; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"| | | Not ranked previous week |- | style=\"background:#9cf; width:20px; border:1px solid black;\"| | | NAIA National Champion |- | - style=\"text-align:center;\"|(\u0442) | | Tied with team above or below also with this symbol |} ==Leading vote- getters== Since the inception of the Coaches' Poll in 1999, the #1 ranking in the various weekly polls has been held by only a select group of teams. Through the last (postseason) poll of the 2017 season, the teams and the number of times they have held the #1 weekly ranking are shown below. The number of times a team has been ranked #1 in the postseason poll (the national champion) is shown in parentheses. There has been only one tie for the leading vote-getter in a weekly poll. In 2015, Southern Oregon was tied with Marian (IN) in the preseason poll. In 1999, the results of a postseason poll, if one was conducted, are not known. Therefore, an additional poll has been presumed, and the #1 postseason ranking has been credited to the postseason tournament champion, the Northwestern Oklahoma State Rangers. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%;\" |- !style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Team !style=\"background:#4169E1; color:white;\" |Total #1 Rankings |- style=\"text- align:center;\" |||57 (6) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||55 (3) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||25 (2) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||24 (2) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||20 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |Saint Francis (IN)||17 (2) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||14 (1) |- style=\"text- align:center;\" |||12 (1) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||5 (1) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||4 (1) |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||4 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||3 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" |||2 |} ==References== Rankings Category:NAIA football rankings ",
