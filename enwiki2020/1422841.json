It is targeted to women, offering a blend of lifestyle, information and entertainment programming. Until 2018, OWN was the only Canadian channel maintaining a brand licensing deal with Discovery Inc. that was not owned by Bell Media and remains the only other Canadian network that Discovery does not have an ownership stake in (the other being Investigation Discovery). After completing its acquisition of Scripps Networks Interactive in 2018, Discovery took stakes in the Canadian versions of DIY Network, Food Network, Cooking Channel and HGTV; all of which are majority- owned by Corus Entertainment. ==History== ===As Canadian Learning Television=== In September 1996, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Ltd. (LSTA) (controlled by CHUM Limited through a 60% interest in the company) was granted a television broadcasting licence by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) called Canadian Learning Television. The channel was licensed to provide \"formal and informal educational programs on a wide range of topics.\" Canadian Learning Television logo used from 1999 to 2003.

The company would later be renamed Access Media Group. In 2003, Canadian Learning Television adopted a new logo and on-air presentation. With this change, the channel began using the brand \"CLT\" in most media, instead of using its full name, although Canadian Learning Television remained the official name of the channel. Logo as CLT (2003-2008), often the wording below the circle was omitted In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated CAD$1.7 billion, included in the sale was CLT.Bell Globemedia acquires CHUM ; Fasken Martineau; 2006-07-12 The sale was approved by the CRTC on June 8, 2007,Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2007-165; CRTC; 2007-06-08 and the transaction was completed on June 22, 2007. In less than a year after taking ownership of Canadian Learning Television, on March 7, 2008, CTVglobemedia announced it would sell the channel to Corus Entertainment for approximately $73 million CAD. The deal was approved by the CRTC on August 22, 2008.Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-206; CRTC; 2008-08-22 The transaction was then finalized on September 1, 2008. ===Refocusing as a lifestyle channel=== In October 2008, Corus announced it would relaunch CLT as Viva, a female-focused entertainment and lifestyle channel targeting the baby boomer demographic. The rebrand took effect on November 3, 2008.Corus set to bow new women's specialty net MediaInCanada.com 2008-10-15 Logo used as Viva On September 29, 2010, Corus announced it had finalized an agreement to launch a Canadian version of the Oprah Winfrey Network in Canada in 2011. Although Corus had said the new channel would involve rebranding an existing channel owned by the company, it had not announced which channel it would be, nor did Corus announce a specific launch date. However, in November 2010, Corus announced that Viva would be rebranded as OWN on March 1, 2011,CORUS ENTERTAINMENT ANNOUNCES MARCH 1, 2011 AS THE CANADIAN LAUNCH DATE FOR OWN: OPRAH WINFREY NETWORK, CNW, 2010-11-09 two months after the Discovery Health channel in the United States was relaunched as the Oprah Winfrey Network on January 1. During that time, select OWN programming was broadcast on Viva and on another Corus-owned female-targeted channel, W Network. An HD feed was also launched. ====CRTC licence controversy==== In December 2012, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission held a hearing investigating OWN's non- compliance with its mandate to air formal education programming \u2013 a holdover of its establishment as Canadian Learning Television. Although Corus stated that it was planning changes to the network's programming to comply with the requirements (including the introduction of four new weekly educational programs to its lineup), the CRTC warned that it could revoke the channel's license or require Corus to apply for a new category B license to operate the channel under. right On March 15, 2013, the CRTC further issued a \"mandatory order\", the last step before license revocation. The order asked for the reduction of programming about \"life enhancement,\" and for more programming addressing the building of job and credit-building skills, along with violations of programming, including airing films, which the network is not allowed to do, and that what did air had only a short professor introduction without any tie-in to the film. The CRTC increased monitoring requirements for the network and asked Corus for a new programming plan to be introduced no later than April 5. In October 2015, the requirement to air adult education programming, as well as the increased monitoring requirements, were both dropped by the CRTC at the request of Corus, as the CRTC is currently in the process of discontinuing the genre protection rules as part of reforms to policies regarding specialty television services. ==Programming== When the channel was launched as CLT, it aired a mix of formal and informal educational and informational programming in the style of newsmagazines, talk shows, documentaries, and more. Over time, the channel introduced more entertainment- based programs such as films and television dramas. The channel maintained a similar scheduling format as Access (now CTV Two Alberta), a television service in Alberta which aired a mix of entertainment and educational programming, both of which were under the same ownership of CHUM and later CTVglobemedia before CLT was sold to Corus Entertainment. As Viva, the channel aired a mix of entertainment and loosely based educational programming to satisfy its CRTC licence requirements, and to that end, many programs continued to be tied to some sort of ongoing course at a Canadian post- secondary institution as it did under CLT. However, with the changeover to Viva, most of the programs had begun with a short introduction from an instructor at the applicable institution. Under the OWN moniker, the channel continues to target female audiences with programming ranging from lifestyle and information to entertainment programming. ===Current=== As of April 2015http://tvschedule.zap2it.com/tvlistings/ZCSGrid.do?stnNum=20714&channel;=72&aid;=tvschedule * 2 Fat 2 Fly * 20/20 * All for Nothing? * Anna & Kristina's Grocery Bag * Be the Boss Canada * Breaking Down the Bars * Cold Blood * Dateline * Divine Design * Extreme Makeover: Home Edition * Family Feud * Ghostly Encounters * Iyanla, Fix My Life * Motives & Murders: Cracking the Case * Murder She Solved * Oprah's Master Class * Oprah's Next Chapter * Oprah: Where Are They Now? * Our America with Lisa Ling * Psychic Investigators * Rescue Mediums * Super Soul Sunday * The Devil You Know * To Catch a Killer * Undercover Boss * Undercover Boss Canada * What Would You Do? ===Former=== * Buy.o.logic * Chef Worthy * Dark Waters of Crime * Eat Yourself Sexy * Extraordinary Acts of Courage * Extreme Clutter with Peter Walsh * Fearless in the Kitchen * Golden Sisters * The Haves and the Have Nots * He Said, She Said * Healthy Gourmet * Houston Beauty * In the Bedroom with Dr. Laura Berman * Let's Learn Japanese (as CLT) * Maxed Out * Million Dollar Neighbourhood * Miracle Detectives * Mystery Diagnosis * Remedy Me! * Searching For... * Shimmy * Simple Fresh Delicious * Snapped * The Cupcake Girls * The Locator * The Nate Berkus Show * The Oprah Winfrey Show * The Right Fit * The Shopping Bags * Tosca: Flexing at 49 * True CSI * Unfaithful: Stories of Betrayal ==References== ==External links== * Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999 Category:Corus Entertainment Category:Analog cable television networks in Canada Category:Oprah Winfrey Category:Women's interest channels Category:English-language television stations in Canada Category:1999 establishments in Canada ",
