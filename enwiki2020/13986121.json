    "text": "Ueckerm\u00fcnde Heath The Ucker/Uecker in Torgelow Ueckerm\u00fcnde Heath (, ) is a large area of forest and heath, 1,000 km\u00b2 in area, in northeastern Germany and northwestern Poland, on the Oder river and the Szczecin Lagoon. In 1945, the eastern part went to Poland and is now called the Puszcza Wkrza\u0144ska. \u015awidwie Lake near Tanowo is the site of a nature reserve and Ramsar site. == Geography == The region is about 1000 km\u00b2 large. In the north it borders to the Szczecin Lagoon and in the east on the Oder. In the west the lowland of the Friedl\u00e4nder Gro\u00dfen Wiese forms the border and in the south the line Stettin-Pasewalk forms it. The Ueckerm\u00fcnde Heath is a lowland area, where only a few points reach heights above the 20 metre above sea level (except for: Dachsberge south of Hintersee with 48 metres). The forest area is crossed by the rivers Uecker, Randow and Zarow. There are also numerous protected moors, especially in the border area with Poland. The swamps were also the reason why the heath was colonised relatively late. In the 17th century it was mainly colonists who set up charcoal burners and glassworks. The frequent occurrence of bog iron was the basis for the metal processing plants, primarily in Torgelow. In the middle of the area there is a military training area of about 50 km\u00b2, which is used by the Bundeswehr (barracks in Torgelow and Eggesin). Today, the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Heath is important for forestry, but also increasingly for tourism. In addition, there is a diverse flora and fauna. Since 2015 there has also been a pack of wolves and their offspring living in the Ueckerm\u00fcnde Heath.
