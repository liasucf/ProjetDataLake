    "text": "The Gergely Csiky Theatre is a theatre in Kaposv\u00e1r, Hungary. Opening in 1911, the theatre became a major cultural center in Somogy County, with its company achieving their greatest successes between 1970\u20131985. ==The building== Designed by the well-known Ede Magyar and J\u00f3zsef Stahl, and named after 19th century dramatist Gregor Csiky, the theatre was opened in 1911 in the former B\u00faza square of Kaposv\u00e1r, as the city's first theatre. With its unique semi- cylindrical sides and distinct roofing it is regarded as an outstanding architectural achievement of its time. It was originally planned with a capacity of 1400, but with modifications, this number shrank to 860. Despite this, the theatre is one of the major such institutions in the country. The structure was Hungary's first to utilize ferro-concrete roofing. It saw two major renovations, first in the fifties, extending the stage area, and another during the eighties, this time fully renewing the building, and upgrading its technical apparatus. The park surrounding the theatre is a favoured public place. ==The company== Premiering in 1911 with the operetta Cig\u00e1nyb\u00e1r\u00f3, the company of the Csiky Gergely Theatre employed several outstanding actors, achieving the greatest success during the lead of Istv\u00e1n Komor, G\u00e1bor Zs\u00e1mb\u00e9ky, and later L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babarczy from the beginning of the 1970s. Several actors were asked to join the National Theatre of Budapest during its renewal in 1978, but many of them quit in 1982 to form the Katona J\u00f3zsef Theatre. After reassembling the cast under the lead of L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Babarczy, the success continued, and the company won all three awards of the 1982 Belgrade International Theatre Festival with the play Marat hal\u00e1la. Notable actors who played in the company include Juli B\u00e1sti, Eszter Cs\u00e1k\u00e1nyi, G\u00e1bor M\u00e1t\u00e9, R\u00f3bert Koltai, J\u00e1nos Kulka, and Judit Pog\u00e1ny. ==External links== * Official website of the Csiky Gergely Theatre *Repertory on Port.hu == Sources == * Mih\u00e1ly, G\u00e1bor.
