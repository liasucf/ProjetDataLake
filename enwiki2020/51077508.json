It was the first Maori language record to hit the no 1 spot in New Zealand. \"The Bridge\" is an example of an artist in the 1980s contributing to the success of a record. This was done by kick starting the process in the beginning by self- financing the record, having a hand in its own promotion by employing various tactics to get the record heard by the public. ==Background== It was sung in M\u0101ori language, and set to Nini Rosso's tune \"Il Silenzio\".The New Zealand Herald March 30, 2009 You must remember this - By Alan Perrott The words were written Waretini's cousin, George Tait, a Te Arawa elder.NZ On Screen The Bridge It pushed John Lennon off the charts when it climbed to the top.New Zealand Herald Monday September 10, 2012 \"Talking Heads: Deane Waretini and Orlando Stewart\" - By Sam Wicks The Bridge was originally independently and self-released. It wasn't picked up CBS until later. After that it became the first no 1 song to be sung in the Maori language. It stayed at the top of the charts for two weeks.NZ On Screen Deane Waretini The song has a meaning to it. It centers around the construction of the Mangere Bridge. The song's lyrics refer to the linking of two cultures in New Zealand, M\u0101ori and Pakeha.New Zealand Herald, Saturday, July 25, 2015 \"Songs that took Te Reo into the Pop Charts, Deane Waretini - The Bridge\" ==Making the record== ===Recording=== It was recorded in Auckland in the suburb of Henderson. The session took place in a garage studio that belonged to a country singer. The ensemble that backed him on the recording included musicians from the Blind Institute. According to Alan Perrotts article, \"You must remember this\" in the March 30, 2009 edition of The New Zealand Herald, the group that backed Waretini, referred to there as The Rising Suns, was formerly called The Radars. The trumpet player on the song who happened to be married to the niece of George Tait was Kevin Furey formerly of the Quincy Conserve. Waretini didn't have money to pay the musicians so he paid them in Kentucky Fried Chicken. ===Production & promotion=== His use of a tactic first employed by Gary Havoc & The Hurricanes of self-financing a record,Stranded in Paradise: New Zealand Rock'n'Roll, 1955-1988, by John Dix, Page 219, Page 294 Waretini paid for his own record. He had a pile of the singles produced, which cost him $96. Some singles were sent to Radio 1ZB. Waretini then bombarded them with play requests. He also managed to get it played at intermission time at Auckland's Civic Theatre. Another tactic was recruiting a news paper boy to sell copies to passing people for 50 cents a piece.
