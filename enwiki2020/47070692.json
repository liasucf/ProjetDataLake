    "text": "Waikavirus is a genus of viruses in the order Picornavirales, in the family Secoviridae. Plants, poaceae, cyperaceae, and gramineae serve as natural hosts. There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Rice tungro spherical virus. Diseases associated with this genus include: MCDV: plant stunting and chlorotic striping of tertiary leaf veins in maize. ==Taxonomy== Group: ssRNA(+) ==Structure== Viruses in Waikavirus are non-enveloped, with icosahedral geometries, and T=pseudo3 symmetry. The diameter is around 30 nm. Genomes are linear, around 12kb in length. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Structure || Symmetry !! Capsid !!

Entry into the host cell is achieved by penetration into the host cell. Replication follows the positive stranded RNA virus replication model. Positive stranded RNA virus transcription is the method of transcription. The virus exits the host cell by tubule-guided viral movement. Plants, poaceae, cyperaceae, and gramineae serve as the natural host. The virus is transmitted via a vector (insects). Transmission routes are vector and mechanical. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! Genus !! Host details !! Tissue tropism !! Entry details !! Release details !!
