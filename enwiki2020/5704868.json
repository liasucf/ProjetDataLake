    "text": "The Swiss Life Group is the largest life insurance company of Switzerland and one of Europe\u2019s leading comprehensive life and pensions and financial services providers, with approximately CHF 254.4 bn of assets under management. Founded in 1867 in Zurich as the Schweizerische Lebensversicherungs und Rentenanstalt cooperative, the company entered the Swiss stock market in 1997 and adopted its current name in 2002. In 2019 the group declared an adjusted profit from operations of CHF 1.69 billion, a 10% increase over the previous year. Net profit increased by 12% to CHF 1.20 billion. Swiss Life is one of the twenty companies listed under the Swiss Market Index, as SLHN. ==History== ===Foundation and growth=== Conrad Widmer established the Schweizerische Rentenanstalt (\"Swiss annuity institution\") in 1857 as the first life insurance company in Switzerland, backed by guarantees from Schweizerische Kreditanstalt. Prominent Zurich politician Alfred Escher was closely involved in the development of the cooperative, whose goal was to provide Swiss families with insurance against the uncertainties of life: the company's board included representatives of most Swiss cantons.Chronik der Stadt und des Bezirkes Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich 1964, S. 624f In 1866, Widmer obtained a license in Prussia, and a year later, the Rentenanstalt had business operations in Hamburg and Bremen. Beginning in 1894, it was one of the first insurance institutions to offer occupational insurance. Between 1866 and 1987, Rentenanstalt expanded to Germany, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Spain, Luxembourg, and Italy. In 1988 it took over La Suisse insurance company of Lausanne. The first registered office of Rentenanstalt was in the Tiefenhoefe buildings on the Paradeplatz in Zurich. Rapid expansion saw the offices moving in quick succession from the Gruene Schloss on Zwingliplatz, to the Chamhaus on the Untere Z\u00e4une and finally to the Alpenquai, where the new head office was opened in 1898. Although this building was spacious for its time, further expansion in the interwar period necessitated yet another move. During 1937\u20131939 a modern building designed by the Pfister firm of architects was constructed close to the old head office. It is this building, extended during 1961\u20131963 and later, that houses today's company head office in Zurich.Chronik der Stadt und des Bezirkes Z\u00fcrich, Z\u00fcrich 1964, S. 624f. ===Going corporate=== In 1997, under the management of Manfred Zobl, Rentenanstalt changed from a mutual into a publicly traded proprietary company, with Rentenstalt/Swiss Life shares debuting in the Swiss Market Index in 1998. Swiss Life then embarked on an expansionary strategy, acquiring Livit, Banca del Gottardo, the Lloyd Continental and UTO Albis in 1999, and Schweizerische Treuhandgesellschaft in 2000, and taking over the real estate properties of Oscar Weber Holding AG in 2001. In 2002, the rapid acquisitions ceased as the company looked to restructuring and going back to its core business. ===Acquisitions and divestments=== In 2002, the company changed its name to Swiss Life for all its operations except in the Netherlands, where it remained under the old name Zwitser Leven (Dutch for \"Swiss Life\"); the Netherlands company was sold in 2007 to SNS Reaal together with the Belgium business.NRC Handelsblad, SNS Reaal koopt Zwitserleven, 19 November 2007 klik hier voor artikel, geraadpleegd op 9 November 2012 In 2004, it sold its British operations to Resolution Life Group. In November 2007, Swiss Life sold off Banca del Gottardo for 1.775 billion CHF. On 3 December 2007, Swiss Life announced that it had launched a takeover bid for AWD Holding; on 13 March 2008, it succeeded in acquiring a total of 86.2% of AWD, which became Swiss Life Select in 2013.
