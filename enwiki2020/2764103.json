Lindenlea has a children's park, tennis courts, a bowling green and a community centre. The community centre was originally a communal garage\u2014there were so few cars that the land was purchased by three local residents for use as a car park, but was later donated to the City. It is the earliest planned community in Ottawa, dating back to the end of the First World War. The community was planned by Thomas Adams and is an example of Adams' garden suburb style. Most of the homes have large back yards, a feature of this planning style. The community is divided into upper Lindenlea, north of Rideau Terrace, and lower Lindenlea. Only upper Lindenlea was planned by Adams. Lower Lindenlea was developed later but followed many of the garden suburb principles, including the large back yards.Lindenlea Community Association - History Lindenlea is notable for its picturesque architecture, mature trees, and plentiful green space.
