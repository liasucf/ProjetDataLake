Speech and Song are this program's main features. The Speech portion offers a large dictionary of words to which Sato Sasara, Suzuki Tsudumi, and Takahashi speak from and are accurate in the Japanese language, although the option to manually edit it exists as well. The Speech portion was created with help of the HTS method. This method is famous in the VOCALOID fanbase because this method created the online synthesizers Sinsy, Open J-Talk, Renoid Player, and many more. The Speech portion offers different types of voices for each character. CeVIO Creative Studio's speech intonation can be controlled with three parameters: cheery, angry, and sad. Other things can be controlled as well, such as volume and speed of consonants and vowels. The software was initially released as \"CeVIO Creative Studio FREE\" with Sato Sasara as the only voice. One was free to create tracks, insert lyrics, and add breaths to the end of notes, but even then those would get caught up in the end of her already automatically set breaths.
