    "text": "Middleton House, also known as the Chatham\u2013Hanes House and R. Philip Hanes Jr. House, is a historic home located at Winston-Salem, Forsyth County, North Carolina. It was built about 1829, and located on a hill overlooking the Savannah River in northwestern North Carolina. The two-story, five bay, Federal style frame dwelling was dismantled and moved to its present site in 1930. It was subsequently reconstructed by architect William Roy Wallace and set in a landscape designed by Ellen Biddle Shipman. The front facade features a two-tier, center-bay porch with graceful Tuscan order columns. Also on the property is the contributing compatible garage/apartment (c. 1930). The house and grounds are owned by Wake Forest University. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. ==References== ==External links== *\"Wake Forest may sell land for home development,\" Triad Business Journal, May 4, 2012 *\"Historic home is donated to Wake,\" Winston-Salem Journal, February 1, 2011; December 11, 2012 Category:Wake Forest University Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Federal architecture in North Carolina Category:Houses completed in 1930 Category:Houses in Winston-Salem, North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Winston-Salem, North Carolina ",
