It is a full-time high school providing education to students aged from 11-15 (junior high school) and 15-18 (senior high school). Foreign language teaching is traditionally a specialty. Shanghai Foreign Language School (SFLS), affiliated with the Shanghai International Studies University (SISU), is a seven-year boarding school located in northeast Shanghai. It covers an area of 33 mu, with the total construction area of 22,508 square meters. SFLS was established in 1963, and reports directly to the Chinese Ministry of Education. ==Location== The school is located at 295 Zhongshan Bei Yi Road(), Hongkou District(), Shanghai, China. In February 2012, SFLS campus was temporarily moved to 730 North Station Road (\u8f66\u7ad9\u5317\u8def730\u53f7) because of the demolition and refurbishment project on old school buildings. In September 2015, SFLS moved back to the campus due to the finish of the project. ==History== It was founded in 1963 as one of China's seven earliest foreign language schools in the metropolis. The school is affiliated with the Shanghai International Studies University. It is a full-time boarding school specializing in foreign language education.

Supplementary materials include \"Look, Listen and Learn\" (Louis George Alexander) for students in 6th to 9th grade (Junior High), and \"Look Ahead Books 3 and 4\" for students in 9th to 12th grade (Senior High). Languages classes are smaller than other classes, and are usually between 20-25 students. Teaching focuses on cultivating students' oral and written abilities in foreign languages. Some of the teaching activities are conducted by foreign experts. The school is equipped with advanced audio-visual equipment. The school shifted from the traditional teaching methods centering on translation and grammar to a set of \"elicitation method of teaching in situations\". This emphasizes the students' audio-lingual skills by training their pronunciation and intonation. ==Teaching focus== In teaching foreign languages, besides emphasizing students' abilities in different practical situations, the school practices the \"going out and inviting in\" method. The so-called \"going out\" means that a number of students are provided with opportunities to study abroad as exchange students at locations like Sukura Nobirin College in Japan, Christina College in Hamburg, Germany, La Salle College, Hong Kong, and The Culver Academies, in Indiana US. The so-called \"inviting in\" means that the school invites foreign visitors so as to provide the students with the opportunity to practice what they have learned in school. Every year, more than 100 students in the school have the chance to receive foreign visitors including members of government delegations, foreign students, and foreign reporters. In order to extend students' scope of knowledge, the school provides additional courses in the form of the Second Classroom, such as: * Second foreign language courses * Selective courses in foreign language study (e.g. Newspaper Reading in Original, Foreign Literature, Foreign History, and Survey of the Countries in the World, etc.) * Public Relations * English of Science and Technology * Cultures and Customs Worldwide * Reading on Ancient Poems ==Schools== *School of English *School of Japanese Culture and Economy *Graduate Institute of Interpretation and Translation *School of International Cultural Exchange Many other schools will be found in the website as follows. ==Languages== *English *Russian *French *German *Spanish *Japanese ==Seminars== In Activities courses, there are seminars on Spare-time Politics school, and workshops such as \"Green-Grass\" Literature, Cartoon, Computer, Film Review, Chinese Calligraphy, Sketch, Wind Band, Chorus, Piano, Food Sculpture, Handcraft, and so on.
