In 1974, he reached a career-high ATP singles ranking of world No. 54, though this is not a true indication, as he was one of the top 20 players in 1971 before the creation of the ATP ranking system, making the year-end Masters the same year. He was also a US Open doubles champion in 1970, partnering Nikola Pili\u0107. ==Grand Slam finals== ===Doubles: 1 (1 title)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:60px\"|Result !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:130px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:150px\"|Partner !style=\"width:150px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" |style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win || 1970 || US Open|| Grass || Niki Pili\u0107 || Roy Emerson Rod Laver || 6\u20133, 7\u20136, 4\u20136, 7\u20136 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:French male tennis players Category:Sportspeople from B\u00e9ziers Category:US Open (tennis) champions Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's doubles Category:Professional tennis players before the Open Era ",
