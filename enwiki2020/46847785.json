    "text": "A nipple tattoo that covers most of the areola The nipple tattoo, or tittoo as it is occasionally known, is a body trend which gained widespread recognition in 2013. It is a type of tattoo which appears on the areola and is semi- permanent. Nipple tattooing has its origins as a medical procedure (medical tattoo) for breast reconstruction after a mastectomy. It is increasingly commonly used as a cosmetic procedure, which began being reported on in early 2013, used to enlarge, darken and define the nipples and areola, with the intent to improve the 'sexiness' of the nipple. This practice began in the United States but slowly trickled through to the United Kingdom, with many Britons opting to travel to the US to have the procedure done. The procedure involves having the participant picking the colour of the nipple tattoo (usually involving a mixture of pigments), and then having a local anesthetic applied. The tattoo device is dipped into the pigment and then applied to the nipple until uniform. The procedure usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes. Breasts can be tattooed so that the colour and shape of the nipples and the areola appear bigger, more deeply coloured, more shapely or with better definition. However, the cosmetic procedure has been criticized, with one blogger on The Guardian complaining that the whole idea of the nipple tattoo \"smacks of media confection\". Since September 2011, the Royal Derby Hospital offers free nipple tattoos for breast surgery patients in order to mask the scars of surgery. The purchase of the tattoo device was funded by the Ashbourne Breast Cancer Walk. Vinnie Myers of Little Vinnie's Tattoos in Finksburg, Maryland, has performed nipple tattoos on over 5,000 women who have undergone surgery for breast cancer, including those of Caitlin Kiernan, who wrote a story about Mr. Myers in The New York Times. A similar service offered without charge in 2017 by a cosmetic tattooist in the UK was booked up six months ahead. ==References== Category:Tattooing by body part Category:Tattooing and medicine Tattoo ",
