The mansion still stands at the southern end of St Helens Park Drive but it's not the oldest building in the suburb. That honour goes to a farmhouse on Appin Road called Denfield and Curtilage which was built in the 1830s by John Farley of Fisher's Ghost fame. Both buildings are listed on the Register of the National Estate. By the 1940s, the St Helens Park property had become a fly spray testing laboratory and acquired the local nickname Blowfly Farm. It was later restored as a residence and grazing property. In 1975, Campbelltown Council designated the area for suburban development and in 1976, it was formally named St Helens Park. Although development was slow at first, it continued throughout the 80s, 90s and into the 21st century. == Heritage listings == St Helens Park has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Appin Road: Denfield * St Helens Park Drive: St Helen's Park ==Schools== There are two primary schools in the suburb.
