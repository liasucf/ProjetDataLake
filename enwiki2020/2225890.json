In 1090 he left the kal'a (Beni Hammad Fort), the traditional capital of the Hammadids to settle in B\u00e9ja\u00efa (Bougie) with his troop and His court, which he considered less accessible to the nomads. He left the region because of the destruction caused by the arrival of the banu Hilal. His father had already prepared this transfer by transforming a fishing port into a city he calls An-Nasiriya but which was to assume the name of Bougie, the name of a tribe that inhabit this region. Al-Mansur has built public buildings, palaces, a water distribution network and gardens in Bejaia. The Hammadid kingdom thus becomes a sedentary kingdom and not nomadic one. the Kal'a was not completely abandoned by al-Mansur and he even embellished it with a number of palaces. The Hammadids had therefore at this time two capitals joined by a royal road. == References == == Bibliography == * * Category:11th-century births Category:1104 deaths Category:Hammadids Category:11th-century rulers in Africa Category:12th-century rulers in Africa Category:11th-century Berber people Category:12th-century Berber people ",
