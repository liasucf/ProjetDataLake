    "text": "Blizzard of 2006 Nor'easter The climate of New York City features a humid subtropical climate (Cfa), with parts of the city transitioning into a humid continental climate. (Dfa) This gives the city cold, snowy winters and hot, humid summers and plentiful rainfall all year round. Meteorological records have been kept at Central Park since 1821, although the station was relocated to a different part of the park on January 1, 1920. There are also other weather stations in the area including one at LaGuardia Airport, beginning in 1940, and at JFK Airport, beginning in 1948. However, due to Central Park's long records and central location, it is often considered the main station for the city. Hence, all records unless otherwise stated will be for this station. The highest temperature ever observed in New York City is on July 9, 1936 and the lowest is on February 9, 1934. The lowest daily maximum is on 30 December 1917 at Central Park. The highest daily minimum at Central Park is on 4 dates, including: July 7, 1908, August 14, 1908, July 15, 1995 and July 22, 2011 However, LaGuardia reported on July 7, 1966. The city can be prone to extremes. Snowfall is a rare occurrence in the city, on average occurring on only 12 days per year, and it is infrequently heavy, but can be on occasion. Thunderstorms are also an occasional, on average occurring on 11 days per year. The city can also be prone to strong winds, being a coastal location it is exposed to the Atlantic. This can be especially pronounced during the autumn and winter months, with a gust of being reported on December 2, 1974.https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/extremes.pdf == Classifications == Union Square in autumn As a result of the city sitting in transitional zones, its climate can be characterised by more than one classification. In the Holdridge life zones system, having a mean annual biotemperature above and mean annual precipitation above , New York City features a warm temperate moist forest climate. ==Temperature== The city's regime of temperature features large seasonal swings, with 4 distinct seasons. However, due to its proximity to the Atlantic ocean, these swings are less significant than areas further inland. The Atlantic serves as a moderator of the temperature meaning the city is milder than areas inland during the winter and cooler during the summer. Although, being on the east coast, this effect is less pronounced. All extremes are for the Central Park station. ===Averages=== In an average year, the temperature will usually be between and with temperatures exceeding these values being uncommon. Temperatures above and below are very rare, with the last occurrences being July 18, 2012 and February 14, 2016, respectively. ===Highest daily temperatures=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record temperature !Date |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Jan 6, 2007\"| Jan 6, 2007 Jan 26, 1950 |- | ||| Feb 21, 2018 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Mar 31, 1998\"| Mar 31, 1998 Mar 29, 1945 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Apr 17, 2002\"| Apr 17, 2002 Apr 18, 1976 |- | ||| May 19, 1962 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Jun 27, 1966\"| Jun 27, 1966 Jun 29, 1934 |- | | || Jul 9, 1936 |- | | || Aug 7, 1918 |- | | || Sep 2, 1953 |- | | || Oct 5, 1941 |- | | || Nov 1, 1950 |- | | || Dec 7, 1998 |} ===Lowest daily temperatures=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record temperature !Date |- | | || Jan 24, 1882 |- | ||| Feb 9, 1934 |- | ||| Mar 5, 1872 |- | ||| Apr 1, 1923 |- | ||| May 6, 1891 |- | | || Jun 1, 1945 |- | | || Jul 1, 1943 |- | | ||data- sort-value=\"Aug 29, 1986\"| Aug 29, 1986 Aug 29, 1982 Aug 31, 1976 Aug 29-30, 1965 Aug 27-28, 1885 |- | | || Sep 30, 1912 |- | | || Oct 27, 1936 |- | | || Nov 30, 1875 |- | | || Dec 30, 1917 |} ===Daily record warm minima=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record temperature !Date |- | | ||Jan 4, 1950 |- | | ||Feb 24, 2017 |- | | ||Mar 31, 1998 |- | | ||Apr 18, 2002 |- | | ||May 31, 1987 |- | | ||Jun 26, 1952 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Jul 22, 2011\"|Jul 22, 2011 Jul 15, 1995 Jul 7, 1908 |- | | ||Aug 14, 1908 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Sep 2, 1898\"|Sep 2, 1898 Sep 7, 1881 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Oct 5, 1898\"|Oct 5, 1898 Oct 4, 1898 |- | | || Nov 2, 1971 |- | | || Dec 24, 2015 |} ===Daily record cold maxima=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible sortable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Period !Record temperature !Date |- | | ||Jan 24, 1882 |- | | ||Feb 5, 1918 |- | | ||Mar 5, 1872 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Apr 7, 1982\"|Apr 7, 1982 Apr 5, 1881 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"May 5, 1891\"|May 5, 1891 May 3, 1873 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Jun 2, 1946\"|Jun 2, 1946 Jun 4, 1945 Jun 2, 1907 |- | | ||Jul 6, 1956 |- | | ||data-sort-value=\"Aug 21, 2007\"|Aug 21, 2007 Aug 31, 1911 |- | | ||Sep 19, 1875 |- | | ||Oct 30, 1925 |- | | || Nov 30, 1875 |- | | || Dec 30, 1917 |} === Highest averages === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record mean !Year |- |Year ||| 2012 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 2010 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) ||| 2010 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1931, 2015 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 2001\u20132002 |- | January | || 1932 |- | February ||| 2018 |- | March ||| 1945 |- | April ||| 2012 |- | May ||| 1991 |- | June | || 1943 |- | July | || 1999 |- | August | || 1980 |- | September | || 2015 |- | October | || 2017 |- | November | || 2015 |- | December | || 2015 |} === Lowest averages === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Period !Record mean !Year |- |Year | || 1888 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) | || 1888 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) | || 1903 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) | || 1871 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1917\u20131918 |- | January | || 1918 |- | February ||| 1934 |- | March ||| 1888 |- | April ||| 1874 |- | May ||| 1917 |- | June | || 1903 |- | July | || 1888 |- | August | || 1927 |- | September | || 1871 |- | October | || 1888 |- | November | || 1873 |- | December | || 1876 |} ==Precipitation== Snow at Central Park during the winter in 2011. The city sees frequent, heavy rainfall which averages annually, with spring being the wettest season and February the driest month. Every single month in the cities recorded history has reported some rainfall, alerting the variability of the climate. Further highlighting the city's variability of weather is the record of only 36 consecutive days without precipitation, between October 10 and November 13, 1924. The city also sees snow, primarily in winter, but sometimes in the late autumn and early spring. Snowfall averages per year but is highly variably between winter seasons. The most rainfall in 24 hours was on September 23, 1882 and the most snowfall was on January 23, 2016. ===Averages=== === Rainfall Extremes === ==== Lowest ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record rainfall !Year |- |Year |align=\"right\"||| 1965 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 1885 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) ||| 1966 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1908 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1901\u20131902 |- | January ||| 1981 |- | February ||| 1895 |- | March ||| 2006 |- | April ||| 1891 |- | May ||| 1903 |- | June ||| 1949 |- | July ||| 1999 |- | August ||| 1995 |- | September ||| 1884 |- | October ||| 1963 |- | November ||| 1976 |- | December ||| 1955 |} ==== Highest ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !Period !Record rainfall !Year |- |Year ||| 1983 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 1983 |- | Summer (June\u2013August) ||| 2011 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1913 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1978\u20131979 |- | January ||| 1979 |- | February ||| 1869 |- | March ||| 2010 |- | April ||| 1983 |- | May ||| 1989 |- | June ||| 2003 |- | July ||| 1889 |- | August ||| 2011 |- | September ||| 1882 |- | October ||| 2005 |- | November ||| 1972 |- | December ||| 1973 |} === Snowfall === ==== Highest ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record most snowfall !Year |- |Year ||| 1896 |- | Seasonal (July\u2013June) ||| 1995\u20131996 |- | Spring (March\u2013May) ||| 1896 |- | Autumn (September\u2013November) ||| 1898 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 2010\u20132011 |- | January ||| 2011 |- | February ||| 2010 |- | March ||| 1896 |- | April ||| 1875 |- | May |Trace|| 2020, 1995, 1977, 1956, 1946 |- | June\u2013September ||| \u2013 |- | October ||| 2011 |- | November ||| 1898 |- | December ||| 1947 |} ==== Lowest ==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Period !Record least snowfallhttps://www.weather.gov/okx/CentralParkHistorical !Year |- |Year ||| 1913 |- | Seasonal (July\u2013June) ||| 1972\u20131973 |- | Winter (December\u2013February) ||| 1997\u20131998 |- | January ||| 1890 |- | February ||| 1998 |- | March ||| 2012, 1903, 1894, 1878 |- | April\u2013November ||| many |- | December ||| 2011, 2006, 1891, 1882, 1877, 1870 |} ==Other phenomena== ===Sunshine, UV and daylight=== The city generally experiences sunny conditions, with cloudy days occurring infrequently, although they are more common in the city than inland areas. As a result of New York City's latitude, , it is not subject to the extremes of daylight that places much farther north see.https://www.gps- coordinates.net/ However, it is far north enough for there to be a moderate change of possible daylight hours throughout the year. ===Wind=== The wind is seldom strong in New York City but can occasionally be noticeable. This is especially true in the autumn and winter seasons when extratropical depressions often bring strong winds. The strongest gust in Central Park, of , occurred on December 2, 1974 however, a station at The Battery reported a gust of on October 14, 1954. https://www.weather.gov/media/okx/Climate/CentralPark/extremes.pdf However, tropical storms can sometimes affect the area, although they are infrequent and usually weak. Most recently Hurricane Sandy struck the city on October 29, 2012 causing billions of dollars in damage. It resulted in loss of power, severe flooding and many residents being displaced.https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cdbgdr/about/About%20Hurricane%20Sandy.page#:~:text=Impact%20of%20Hurricane%20Sandy&text;=The%20storm%20resulted%20in%20the,New%20Yorkers%20were%20temporarily%20displaced. ==Climate change== Queens\u2013Midtown Tunnel after flooding caused by Hurricane Sandy on October 29, 2012. Climate change means events like this will become more likely. Being a coastal city, New York City is expected to experience significant affects from rising sea levels. Predictions that the sea level will rise by as much as by 2100 have prompted the city's mayor to invest $10 million dollars into keeping the city safe.https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265833/new-york-city-climate-change- sea-level-rise-bill-de-blasio-development The city is also expected to become more susceptible to storm surges and flooding, meaning events like Hurricane Sandy's impacts will become more likely in the future. ===Temperature=== The temperature in New York City has generally increased steadily of the last 150 years and this trend is expected to continue due to anthropocentric warming. By 2080, it is predicted that the climate of the city will be similar to southern Kansas. The mean temperature has risen by since the 1970s and this warming is expected to accelerate in the coming decades.https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2019/02/12/global-warming- climate-change-shift-climates- south/2847860002/https://www.dec.ny.gov/energy/94702.html#:~:text=The%20annual%20average%20temperature%20statewide,northern%20parts%20of%20New%20York. ===Precipitation=== Precipitation in the city has significantly increased since 2000; both rainfall and snowfall have risen, but snowfall has increased much more significantly. However, it is argued that such trends, being so recent, are impossible to predict whether such increases will continue or become steadier. https://newyorkyimby.com/2017/12/why-new-york-citys-rapidly- rising-snowfall-totals-are-no-holiday-miracle.html ===Data=== ==Station data== ;Time series plot for Central Park, 1869-present ==Notes== ==References== New York City Category:New York City Category:Climate by city ",
