    "text": "Stained Glass, Soma Fountains is a compilation album by the Legendary Pink Dots, issued in 1997 on Soleilmoon Records. The album covers several tracks from the group's early career; some were previously released on small and independent labels, while others were private demos. It was originally intended for these songs to be included as bonus tracks on Soleilmoon's CD reissues of the early Legendary Pink Dots albums, but contractual reasons prevented this. \"April's Song\" dates from 1980, when the group was still known as \"One Day\". ==Track listing== #A Pale Green Introduction/Love on a Pale Green Postage Stamp #Premonition 12 #Mmmmmmmmmmmm ...
