Although the same kind of tea trees are also planted around Dongting Lake, where Junshan Island is located, those teas should not be called Junshan Yinzhen. The tea resembles the White tea Yinzhen known as Bai Hao Yinzhen. Junshan Yinzhen, allegedly the preferred tea of Chairman Mao Zedong, is a rare tea sometimes sold as White tea. ==See also== * Baihao Yinzhen * China Famous Tea ==References== Category:Junshan District Category:Yellow tea Category:Chinese teas Category:Chinese tea grown in Hunan ",
