    "text": "Nicrosil is a nickel alloy containing 14.4% chromium, 1.4% silicon, and (in some sources) 0.1% magnesium. Nicrosil is used as the positive leg of type N thermocouples. In this application another nickel alloy, Nisil, is used as the negative leg. The Nicrosil alloy in this case does not contain magnesium. ==References== ==External links== * Materials properties of thermocouple wires sold by Omega Engineering, Inc. * * Data sheets NICROSIL Category:Nickel alloys Category:Silicon alloys Category:Chromium alloys Category:Refractory metals ",
