Balaram is mainly known for his work in the field of synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. He was given the Excellence in Carbohydrate Research Award by the Association of Carbohydrate Chemists and Technologists India (ACCTI) in 2018 for his contribution towards field of carbohydrate. == Biography == 254x254px Balaram Mukhopadhyay, born on January 12, 1973 in Bankura, a district town in the Indian state West Bengal, graduated with honors in chemistry from the Bankura Christian College in 1994 and followed it up with a master's degree from the Burdwan university in 1996. His journey with the world of carbohydrates is started when he enrolled for doctoral studies at the Indian Association For The Cultivation Of Science(IACS), Kolkata, under the guidance of Prof. Nirmolendu Roy and after securing a PhD in 2001, he moved to the UK for the post-doctoral studies, under the supervision of Robert A Field of the University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK (2001 - 2005). After 4 years of Post-doctoral studies, Balaram joined as a Scientist-C at the Medicinal and Process Chemistry Division in Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Lucknow. He left CDRI at 2008 and joined as an Assistant professor at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata (IISER Kolkata), where he now holds a position of Professor. At IISER, he heads a laboratory, named Sweet Lab, where he hosts several researchers. Balaram focuses his research mainly in oligosaccharide synthesis and published a number of articles. Later he also explore the fields like Glyco- nanoparticles, Supramolecular chemistry of carbohydrate gels and crystals, Carbohydrate protein interaction. He becomes a member of the Editorial Board of the international peer reviewed scientific journal Carbohydrate Research in 2017. == Career == === Academic background === # PhD (Chemical Sciences), IACS (Jadavpur University), 2001 # MSc (Chemistry (Organic Chemistry Special)), Burdwan University, 1996 # BSc (Chemistry (Honours), Physics, Mathematics), Bankura Christian College (Burdwan University), 1994 # Higher Secondary (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology), Bankura Christian College (WBCHSE), 1991 # Madhyamik (Bengali, English, Physical Science, Life Science, Mathematics, History, Geography), Bankura Zilla School (WBBSE), 1989 === Work positions === # Professor, IISER Kolkata ( 2018 - ) # Associate Professor, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata (2012 - 2015) # Assistant Professor, Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER) Kolkata (2008 - 2012) # Scientist-C, Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI) Lucknow (2005 - 2007) # Post Doctoral Research Associate, University of East Anglia, Norwich, UK (2001 - 2005) == Selected publications == === Synthesis of biologically relevant oligosaccharides from plant and bacterial origin === # Synthesis of the tetrasaccharide related to the repeating unit of the O-antigen from Azospirillum brasilense Jm125A2 in the form of its 2-aminoethyl glycoside: Vikramjit Sarkar and Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Carbohydrate Research 2018, 470, 13\u201318. # Synthesis of Two Hexasaccharides Related to the Repeating Unit of the O-Antigen from Escherichia coli TD2158: Kumar Bhaskar Pal and Balaram Mukhopadhyay, ChemistrySelect 2017, 2, 7378-7381. # Concise synthesis of two trisaccharides related to the saponin isolated from Centratherum anthelminticum: Santanu Mandal and Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Tetrahedron 2007, 63, 11363-11370. # Glycosylated N-sulfonylamidines: Highly efficient copper catalyzed multicomponent reaction with sugar alkynes, sulfonyl azides and amines: Santanu Mandal, Harsh Mohan Gauniyal, Kausikisankar Pramanik, Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Journal of Organic Chemistry 2007, 72, 9753-9756. === Novel methodologies for protecting group manipulations and glycosylation === # Sulfuric acid immobilized on silica: an efficient promoter for one-pot acetalation\u2013acetylation of sugar derivatives: Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Tetrahedron Letters 2006, 47, 4337-4341. # H2SO4-silica promoted \u201con-column\u201d removal of benzylidene, isopropylidene, trityl and tert- butyldimethylsilyl groups: Bimalendu Roy, Priya Verma, Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Carbohydrate Research 2009, 344, 145-148. # A one-pot synthesis of novel sugar derived 5,6-dihydro-quinazolino[4,3-b]quinazolin-8-ones: an entry towards highly functionalized sugar-heterocyclic hybrids: Abhijeet Deb Roy, Arunachalam Subramanian, Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Raja Roy, Tetrahedron Letters 2006, 47, 6857-6860. # Hydrogen bonding-induced conformational change in a crystalline sugar derivative: Kumar Bhaskar Pal, Vikramjit Sarkar and Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Crystal Engineering Communications 2016, 18, 1156-1163 === Carbohydrate materials, metal-carbohydrate complexes and glyco nanoparticles === # Samarium trifluoromethanesulfonate: an efficient moisture tolerant acylation catalyst under solvent free condition: Bimalendu Roy, Somnath Dasgupta, Vishal Kumar Rajput and Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Journal of Carbohydrate Chemistry 2008, 27, 1-9. # Organoiridium complexes: efficient catalysts for the formation of sugar acetals and ketals: Soumik Mandal, Prashant Ranjan Verma, Balaram Mukhopadhyay, Parna Gupta Carbohydrate Research 2011, 346, 2007-2010. # Phase-selective carbohydrate gelator: Somnath Mukherjee and Balaram Mukhopadhyay RSC Advances 2012, 2(6), 2270 - 2273. # Carbohydrates in Fluoride Sensing: Use of Cyclodextrin and CNC-Based Chemical Probes: Rituparna Das and Balaram Mukhopadhyay, ChemistrySelect, 2017, 2, 4499-4504. == Selected publications == # Streamlined Synthesis of Per-O- acetylated Sugars, Glycosyl Iodides or Thioglycosides from Unprotected Sugars, Balaram Mukhopadhyay, K.
