    "text": "Sandemar Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in Stockholm County in Sweden. The nature reserve lies close to Sandemar Castle and the landscape is characterised by having been part of the manorial estate for a long time. The area is considered to be one of the foremost examples in Stockholm County of such a landscape. It includes coastal meadows rich in bird-life and a rich fen situated in the eastern part of the reserve. The fen is regularly tended to in order to preserve its special flora and fauna, which includes early marsh orchid, fen orchid, marsh helleborine and the carnivorous common butterwort. The coastal meadows contain stands of elder-flowered orchid and Fritillaria meleagris, and the flat meadows and shallow water is also an important habitat for birds. For the convenience of visitors, a bird watching tower has been built not far from the water's edge. The nature reserve is part of the EU-wide Natura 2000-network. ==Gallery== File:Sandemar Naturreservat 2012.jpg|Entrance to the nature reserve File:Sandemar Naturreservat 2012a.jpg|Bird-watching tower File:Sandemar f\u00e5gelseservat 2012b.jpg|Coastal meadow in the nature reserve, with Dalar\u00f6 Fortress in the background ==References== ==External links== * Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Natura 2000 in Sweden Category:Geography of Stockholm County Category:Tourist attractions in Stockholm County Category:Protected areas established in 1997 Category:1997 establishments in Sweden ",
