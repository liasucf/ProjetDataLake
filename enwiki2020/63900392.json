    "text": "Norma Therese Falby (May 10, 1917 \u2013 September 19, 2006), better known under her pen name Norma Lorre Goodrich, was an American professor of French, comparative literature and writing who taught in the University of Southern California and Claremont Colleges for 45 years and published several popular books on Arthuriana. Goodrich was noted for her thesis, first presented in a 1986 book titled King Arthur, that the legendary monarch was not a myth, but a real person, who lived not in England or Wales, as conventionally understood, but in Scotland. In her interpretation, Queen Guinevere was a Pictish queen, and Sir Lancelot a Scottish king. Her scholarly methodology involved back- translating Latin place names found in Geoffrey of Monmouth\u2019s Historia Regum Britanniae to what she believed to be their Celtic originals.Stewart, Jocelyn Y. (30 September 2006), \u201cNorma Lorre Goodrich, 89: Shed New Light on King Arthur\u201d [Obituary; Erratum published 7 October 2006]; The Los Angeles Times, Section A. Her findings have not been accepted by Galfridian scholars. ==Biography== ===Youth and education=== Goodrich was born May 10, 1917, in Huntington, Vermont, the daughter of Charles Edmund and Edyth Annie (Riggs) Falby. When she was 5, an aunt gave her a copy of Alfred, Lord Tennyson\u2019s book The Idylls of the King, and set her on a literary path. Goodrich graduated from the University of Vermont in 1938 with a bachelor\u2019s degree and continued her studies at universities in France, where she lived for many years and once owned and directed a school. ===Career=== She married Joseph Lorre and the couple had a son, Jean-Joseph Lorre, but they divorced in 1946. At the age of nearly 50 she earned doctoral degrees in French and Roman philology from Columbia University in 1965. The previous year, she had remarried, to John Hereford Howard, and began teaching French and comparative literature at the University of Southern California rising ultimately to an assistant professorship. In 1971, after an associate professorship, she became dean of the faculty at Scripps College, a women\u2019s college in Claremont and one of the five undergraduate Claremont Colleges. After retirement, she became a professor emerita. ===Popular writings=== Using the pen name \u201cNorma Lorre Goodrich\u201d, she began publishing books for a popular audience in 1960, beginning with \u201cMyths of the Hero,\u201d an exploration of myths from ancient and medieval times. In it she wrote, \u201cThe hero myth may be the one that has most influenced culture down the centuries.\u201d By 1986, now professor emerita at the Claremont Colleges, she had turned her attention full-time to the legend of King Arthur. That year she told a Los Angeles Times reporter that she had discovered a void in Arthurian scholarship: \u201cAll the books on Arthur have been on the mythology, the legend,\u201d but not the history. (Of course, this was not true; many books had already investigated the \u201chistorical Arthur\u201d.) Goodrich traveled extensively in Britain and France and laid claim to having mastered several ancient and modern languages. She and her husband traveled to Scotland and followed routes laid out by ancient maps, unearthing clues to the historical King Arthur. She adopted the view that the 12th century pseudo- historian, Geoffrey of Monmouth had known that Arthur had not been in England, but in Scotland, but had concealed this unpopular view by listing the names of Arthur's battles in Latin rather than Gaelic\u2014the original Celtic language of Scotland. \u201cWhen I finally figured out what he was doing, I translated the Latin back into Gaelic,\u201d Goodrich told the Riverside Press-Enterprise in 1994. She then found that the names coincided with places in Scotland. (The conventional view has always been that Geoffrey was describing places in southwestern England or Wales.) Guinevere was a Pictish queen, Goodrich decided, and Lancelot was a Scottish king. Goodrich's books were infrequently reviewed in scholarly journals and generally ignored by academic authorities. (For example, neither Norris J. Lacy's The New Arthurian Encyclopedia (1996) nor Alan Lupack's The Oxford Guide to Arthurian Literature and Legend (2005), both of which are exhaustive, mention her works in their vast indexes.) One exception was Rosemary Morris's review of King Arthur in the journal Albion. Morris was scathing. She found Goodrich's work to be \u201cuneven and erratic\u2026. It is so fundamentally unsound that one would take it as an elaborate joke.... For an Arthurian expert, reading this book is a nightmare: familiar details are there, but in the grossest confusion. Even a non-initiate will probably find that the book denounces itself by innumerable inconsistencies and logical absurdities\u2026. She claims to be a specialist on the written texts (p. 27), whose difficulty she greatly exaggerates\u2026. In linguistics she is lost.... Professor Goodrich regularly mangles the history, literature, and language both of the Dark Ages (which she does nothing to illuminate) and of the High Middle Ages (which she totally fails to understand). But modern critics fare no better. If they agree (?) with her, they are \"brilliant,\" but if they \"disagree\" they are insulted....\u201dAlbion 19.3 (1987), pp. 391-3.Another unflattering review is: Frantzen, Allen J. (Jun 1987), The American Historical Review, Vol. 92, No. 3, pp. 641-642. Her husband John died in February 1995 at the age of 77.https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/82003529/john-hereford- howard Goodrich died on September 19, 2006 of natural causes at her home in Claremont, California. Her obituary in the Los Angeles Times stated that \"the fact that her King Arthur findings contradicted those of other scholars did not trouble Goodrich\". ==Works== *Myths of the Hero (1960) *The Ancient Myths (1960; PB: Mentor, New American Library) *Medieval Myths ** Revised/expanded edition (1977) *Le Morte D'Arthur, Abridged and introduced By Norma Lorre Goodrich (1963; Washington Square Press) *Charles, Duke of Orleans: Poet and Prince (1963; Macmillan Company) *The Ways of Love: Eleven Romances of Medieval France (1965; George Allen & Unwin) *Charles of Orleans: A Study of His French and His English Poetry (1967; Geneva: Libraire Droz) *Giono: Master of Fictional Modes (1973; Princeton University Press) *King Arthur (1986) *Priestesses (1989) *Merlin (1987; PB 1989: HarperPerennial) *Guinevere (1992, Franklin Watts; PB: HarperPerennial) *The Holy Grail (1992, HarperCollins) *Heroines: Demigoddess, Prima Donna, Movie Star (1994) *The Doctor and Maria Theresa *Charlemagne *The Jungle of Academe: The Poetry of Norma Lorre Goodrich (2013; Compiled by Andrew Whitenack) ==Accolades== *Dame, Knights Templar, Commandery of Nova Scotia, Scotland *Member of the Metropolitan Opera Guild *Member, National Society Daughters of American Revolution (NSDAR) *Royal Society of Descendants of Charlemagne ==References== Category:1917 births Category:2006 deaths Category:Academics from Vermont Category:Arthurian scholars ",
