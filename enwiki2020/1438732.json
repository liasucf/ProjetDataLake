    "text": "Waysted were a British heavy metal band, formed by the UFO bass guitarist Pete Way and the Scottish rocker Fin Muir (Ian Muir) in 1982. Recruiting Frank Noon (formerly with Def Leppard), Ronnie Kayfield and Paul Raymond, Waysted signed to Chrysalis Records and released Vices in 1983. The band has gone through multiple line up changes over the years, with members leaving, rejoining and leaving again, as well as periods of complete dormancy while Way pursued other projects. The band then split up in 1987, but then reformed in 2003. In 2008, Waysted were touring the UK in support of their new album The Harsh Reality. However, the outfit has not released any new material since that time. Way died on 14 August 2020 from injuries sustained in an accident. ==Discography== * Vices (1983) No. 78 UK * Waysted \u2013 EP (1984) No. 73 UK * The Good the Bad the Waysted (1985) * Save Your Prayers (1986) No. 185 US * Wilderness of Mirrors (2000) * You Won't Get Out Alive (2000) * Back from the Dead (2004) * The Harsh Reality (2007) * Totally Waysted (2008) ==Current members== * Pete Way \u2013 bass guitar (1982\u20131987. 2003\u20132020; died 2020) * Fin Muir \u2013 vocals (1982\u20131985; 2003\u20132020) * Chris George \u2013 guitar (2004\u20132020) * Paul \"RD\" Haslin \u2013 drums (2003\u20132020) * Jason Poole \u2013 guitar (2007\u20132020) ==Former members== * Neil Wilkinson \u2013 guitar (2007) * Danny Vaughn \u2013 vocals, tambourine (1985\u20131987) * Johnny Dee \u2013 drums (1985\u20131987) * Jimmy DiLella \u2013 keyboards, piano, guitar (1985\u20131987) * Paul Raymond \u2013 keyboards, guitar (1982\u20131984) * Ron E.
