Starting in the early 1970s, Levine began working on jingles for television commercials, as well as singing on them, with one of his most well-remembered jingles being \"Sometimes You Feel Like A Nut\" for Mounds and Almond Joy chocolate bars. Levine founded Crushing Enterprises in New York City in 1969, and continues to write music for commercials and television. Popular campaigns from the past include: \u201cPepsi \u2013 The Joy of Cola\", \"Gentlemen Prefer Hanes\", \"Just For the Taste of It \u2013 Diet Coke\", \"Orange you smart, (for drinking Orange Juice)\", \"Come See the Softer Side of Sears\", \"Heartbeat of America \u2013 Chevrolet\", \"Dr Pepper \u2013 You Make the World Taste Better\", \"You Asked For It, You Got It, Toyota,\" \"Who's that Kid With the Oreo Cookie,\" and \"This Bud's For You\" for Anheuser-Busch. Most recently he wrote the current Budweiser anthem, \"This Is Budweiser, This Is Beer.\" In addition, Levine has also contributed songs, some of them with his 1960's bubblegum pop sound, to the PBS series Dragon Tales. ==References== ==External links== * http://www.crushingmusic.com Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:American male musicians Category:American musicians Category:American record producers Category:American Jews Category:Jingle writers Category:Musicians from New York (state) ",
