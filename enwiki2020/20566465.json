    "text": "Claude-Ernest Ndalla (born 25 May 1937R\u00e9my Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique (1997), Karthala Editions, page 440 .Les \u00c9lites africaines (1970), page 207 .) is a Congolese politician. First coming to prominence as a radical youth leader in 1960s Congo- Brazzaville, he was one of the leading members of the Congolese Labour Party (PCT) in the period immediately following its founding in 1969, but after a few years his career fell into a long decline due to factional struggles within the PCT. Later, he served in the government of Congo-Brazzaville as Minister of Youth Redeployment and Sports from 1997 to 1999, and he has been a Special Adviser to President Denis Sassou Nguesso since 2003. ==Political career in the 1960s and 1970s== Ndalla was born in Brazzaville in 1937Ren\u00e9 Gauze, Virginia McLean Thompson, and Richard Adloff, The Politics of Congo- Brazzaville (1973), page 255. and studied mathematics at the University of Toulouse in France.Africa, issues 77-88 (1978), page 58. At Toulouse, he was known for his appetite and was nicknamed Graille, or crow. Back in Congo- Brazzaville, he quickly attained a prominent place in the radicalized political scene of the period that followed the August 1963 ouster of Fulbert Youlou, and he started a magazine, Dipanda.Achille Kissita, Congo: trois d\u00e9cennies pour une d\u00e9mocratie introuvable (1993), page 150 . In 1964, Ndalla was included on the executive committee of the Youth of the National Movement of the Revolution (JMNR), the radical youth wing of the ruling National Movement of the Revolution (MNR), and he acquired a reputation as a radical leftist and ideologue. On 6 April 1965, President Alphonse Massemba-D\u00e9bat appointed Ndalla as Secretary of State at the Presidency in charge of Youth and Civic Education.Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 112 . However, Massemba-D\u00e9bat dismissed Ndalla from that post in December 1965. In light of Ndalla's prominent identification with the JMNR, his dismissal indicated that the JMNR had lost some influence, but Ambroise Noumazalaye--a strong advocate for the JMNR--was appointed as Prime Minister in April 1966.Gauze, Thompson, and Adloff, The Politics of Congo-Brazzaville, page 220. Ndalla was the Director of Congolese Radio and Television Broadcasting from 1967 to 1969, and he was appointed as Ambassador to the People's Republic of China in 1969; in the latter post, he was also assigned responsibility for relations with North Vietnam and North Korea.Africa Diary (1970), page 4,933. He arrived in Beijing on 24 April 1969Xinhua, 24 April 1969. and was received by the Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Lin Biao at Tiananmen Square on 1 May 1969.\"Chairman Mao and Vice-Chairman Lin Piao receive new ambassador of Congo (B) to China\", Xinhua, 1 May 1969. He held a reception in Beijing on 15 August 1969 to mark the sixth anniversary of the revolution; various high-ranking Chinese officials, including Premier Zhou Enlai, attended.Peking Review (1969), page 37. Along with various other prominent politicians, including Massemba-D\u00e9bat and Pascal Lissouba, Ndalla was put on trial by President Marien Ngouabi in 1969 for involvement in the murder of government officials, but he was acquittedGauze, Thompson, and Adloff, The Politics of Congo-Brazzaville, pages 175-176.\"Congo (Brazzaville) - Former President Acquitted\", Africa Diary (1970), page 4,767.Bazenguissa- Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 153 . on 21 November 1969. He then spent a few weeks at his diplomatic post in Beijing before returning home. In December 1969, a new ruling Marxist-Leninist ruling party was created under President Ngouabi: the Congolese Labour Party (PCT). Ndalla was one of the party's founding members; he was included in the PCT's original Political Bureau and was designated as First Secretary in charge of Organization,Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 160 . in which capacity he was responsible for managing internal organizational matters.Africa Research Bulletin: Political, Social and Cultural Series, volume 7 (1970), page 1,639. Ndalla represented the far-left faction of the PCT, and his designation as First Secretary bolstered the far-left while positioning him as \"Ngouabi's principal rival\", as he was effectively the second-ranking figure in the PCT regime. Despite his clear affinity for China and Maoism, Ndalla led a Congolese delegation that visited the Soviet Union in June 1970.Yearbook on International Communist Affairs (1971), page 100. (Yearbook on International Communist Affairs series) Student protests and a strike led Ngouabi to sideline the PCT's radical leftist leaders, who were associated with Maoism, in November 1971. Ndalla and another high-ranking radical, Ange Diawara, were among those affected by Ngouabi's move. Diawara then led an unsuccessful left- wing coup attempt against Ngouabi on 22 February 1972. Ndalla and the others who supported a far-left, pro-Chinese political line were known as the 22 February Movement (M-22).Africa Contemporary Record: Annual Survey and Documents, volume 18 (1987), page B-213.\"President wins decisive victory over pro-Soviets\", Africa Confidential, 17 October 1984, pages 1-3. Implicated in the plot, Ndalla was tried along with 177 others\"Jun 1972 - Presidential commution of death sentences imposed on alleged plotters\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 18, June 1972 Congo, page 25,308. and sentenced to life in prison on 25 March 1972. President Ngouabi later released him as part of an amnesty, along with others from the M-22, in September 1975. Following his release, Ndalla faced difficulties and it took him some time to find work. President Ngouabi was assassinated under mysterious circumstances in March 1977. Various prominent political figures suspected of disloyalty were immediately brought before a military tribunal and tried for complicity in the assassination. Massemba-D\u00e9bat was executed, while Ndalla and Lissouba were among those sentenced to life in prison. ==Political career from the 1980s to the 1990s== Under Denis Sassou Nguesso, the M-22 was partially rehabilitated and regained influence beginning in 1980, to the point that some M-22 figures were considered part of \"the backbone\" of the PCT regime. By that time, the M-22 was considerably less radical, although still ideologically Marxist. Like the PCT in general, the M-22 was \"clearly dominated by northerners\", and it was the northern M-22 leaders, rather than southerners like Ndalla, who most clearly benefited from Sassou Nguesso's favor. Ndalla was arrested prior to a PCT party congress in 1984. At the time, Sassou Nguesso was trying to assert his authority in the PCT leadership against a hard-line, pro-Soviet faction led by Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Katali, and it was believed that Sassou Nguesso wanted to prevent Ndalla from encouraging other M-22 southerners to support Katali's faction. The arrest of Ndalla was part of a series of successful moves by Sassou Nguesso in 1984, culminating in his victory over the Katali faction at the party congress. While in detention, Ndalla was recorded on video saying that Jean-Pierre Thyst\u00e8re Tchicaya, a key figure in the PCT regime, had orchestrated bomb attacks that occurred in Brazzaville in 1982. Those bomb attacks killed nine people and wounded 92 others.Edward F. Mickolus, Todd Sandler, and Jean Marie Murdock, International Terrorism in the 1980s: A Chronology of Events (1989), Iowa State University Press, page 266. Sassou Nguesso used Ndalla's claim as evidence when he launched a sudden attack on Thyst\u00e8re Tchicaya at the 1984 congress. Although Ndalla told a party commission sent to investigate the matter that his incriminating statements were untrue and that he had only made them to avoid being tortured, Thyst\u00e8re Tchicaya was removed from the PCT leadership on the basis of Ndalla's claim. Ndalla was tried before the Revolutionary Court of Justice for his alleged role in the 1982 bomb attacks and was sentenced to death in August 1986.\"Sep 1987 - Internal political developments - Economic situation - Foreign relations\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 33, September 1987, Congo, page 35,370.Richard F. Staar, Yearbook on International Communist Affairs (1987), Hoover Institution Press, page 9. (Yearbook on International Communist Affairs series)When the State Kills: The Death Penalty v. Human Rights (1989), Amnesty International, page 124. Ndalla had no right to appeal the decision, which was criticized by international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and the International Federation of Human Rights on the grounds that the trial was unfair and the evidence of guilt was insufficient.Africa Research Bulletin: Political Series (1986), page 8,193. The death sentence was never carried out, however, and Sassou Nguesso commuted Ndalla's sentence to life imprisonment with hard laborGaston-Jonas Kouvibidila, Histoire du multipartisme au Congo-Brazzaville: La marche \u00e0 rebours, 1940-1991 (2000), L'Harmattan, page 171 . as a gesture of clemency to mark the 25th anniversary of the 1963 revolution in August 1988.Africa Contemporary Record: Annual Survey and Documents (1989). Two years later, on the 27th anniversary of the revolution, Sassou Nguesso granted Ndalla and other political prisoners an amnesty on 14 August 1990;Bazenguissa-Ganga, Les voies du politique au Congo: essai de sociologie historique, page 396 . he was accordingly released from prison on 15 August. By that time, Sassou Nguesso and the PCT regime were struggling to maintain control of the country amidst increasingly vocal demands for democratic reform, and Ndalla wasted no time in returning to the political stage by adding his voice to those calling for reform.West Africa (1990), page 2,410. As a delegate to the February-June 1991 Sovereign National Conference, Ndalla criticized the record of the PCT regime.Gankama N'Siah, \"La Conf\u00e9rence nationale souveraine : arrive le moment des d\u00e9clarations de politique g\u00e9n\u00e9rale\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 8 June 2007 . ==Political career since the 1990s== Ndalla was associated with opposition leader Bernard Kol\u00e9las and his party, the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI), during the 1990s, and he helped to recruit fighters for the Ninja militia loyal to Kol\u00e9las. During the June- October 1997 civil war, Ndalla objected to the MCDDI's moves toward an alliance with President Pascal Lissouba and defected to the side of Denis Sassou Nguesso and his rebel Cobra militia.R\u00e9my Bazenguissa-Ganga, \"The Spread of Political Violence in Congo-Brazzaville\", in African Affairs, vol. 98, no. 390, January 1999, pages 389-411. The civil war ended in victory for the Cobras on 15 October 1997; Lissouba and Kol\u00e9las were ousted and Sassou Nguesso regained control of the country. When Sassou Nguesso formed a government on 2 November 1997, he appointed Ndalla as Minister of Youth Redeployment and Sports, in charge of Civic Instruction.Calixte Baniafouna, Congo d\u00e9mocratie : La bataille de Brazzaville (5 juin-15 octobre 1997) (2003), L'Harmattan, page 184 . He was not included in the next government, appointed on 12 January 1999;\"D\u00e9cret n\u00b0:99-1 du 12/01/1999 portant nomination des membres du Gouvernement\", Decree of the President of Congo-Brazzaville, 12 January 1999 . subsequently he was appointed as Political Delegate of the Head of State, in which capacity he acted as Sassou Nguesso's representative.\"Cl\u00f4ture \u00e0 Bacongo (Brazzaville) de la conf\u00e9rence sur la paix dans la r\u00e9gion du Pool\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 3 May 2002 . Ndalla strongly backed Sassou Nguesso when the latter stood as a candidate for the March 2002 presidential election. He was present for the launch of the support committee for Sassou Nguesso's candidacy on 6 February 2002, and on that occasion he elaborated his view that Sassou Nguesso was \"a symbol of hope, peace and freedom\" by symbolically assigning a positive characteristic to each letter of the name \"Sassou\", in French: \"S is for security (s\u00e9curit\u00e9), A is for joy (all\u00e9gresse), S is for concern for others (souci des autres), S is for the salvage of the property of the people of Mfilou (sauvetage des biens des gens de Mfilou), O is for organizer of peace (organisateur de la paix), and U is for national unity (unit\u00e9 nationale)\".\"Pr\u00e9sentation officielle du comit\u00e9 de soutien \u00e0 la candidature de Denis Sassou Nguesso\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 9 February 2002 . Ndalla subsequently worked on Sassou Nguesso's campaign as head of the coordination of the support committee for the Mfilou district of Brazzaville.\"Anguios Nganguia-Engamb\u00e9: \u00abLa R\u00e9publique M\u00e2\u00bb\", La Semaine Africaine, N\u00b0 2684, 6 April 2007, page 9 . In his capacity as Political Delegate of the Head of State, Ndalla presided over a meeting of the Youth Committee for Peace in the Pool on 24-28 April 2002. The meeting called on the security forces to show restraint in the Pool Region while also urging Ninja rebels to disarm. He was present at the Marien Ngouabi Mausoleum for a ceremony at which the eternal flame commemorating Ngouabi, which had been extinguished during the 1997 war, was rekindled on 11 November 2002.\"Jean- Claude Gakosso ranime la flamme du mausol\u00e9e Marien Ngouabi \u00e0 Brazzaville\" , Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 14 November 2002 . On 30 January 2003, Sassou Nguesso appointed Ndalla as a Special Adviser to the President.\"Trois conseillers sp\u00e9ciaux nomm\u00e9s au cabinet du chef de l'Etat\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 3 February 2003 . Ndalla accompanied Claude-Alphonse Nsilou, the Minister of Urban Affairs, during the latter's campaign for a seat in the June 2007 parliamentary election, calling on the people of Bacongo's second constituency to give Nsilou a majority in the first round of voting.Thierry Noungou, \"Elections l\u00e9gislatives : Claude Alphonse Nsilou vient en aide aux vendeurs de la 2e circonscription \u00e9lectorale de Bacongo\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 19 June 2007 . Speaking in mid-2007, Ndalla expressed dismay regarding the poor state of Congo-Brazzaville's prison conditions and said that the system needed more money. He also noted that the prisons could cause increased criminalization among inmates, making them more dangerous to society upon release.\"Congo: Prison system criticised for ill-treatment\", IRIN, 31 July 2007. On 1 October 2008, Ndalla participated in the founding of the Convention for the Rebirth of Congo (CRC),Roger Ngomb\u00e9, \"La Convention pour la renaissance du Congo signe son acte de naissance\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 1 October 2008 .Gankama N'Siah, \"Le fait du jour - Visages, id\u00e9es et convictions...\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 5 October 2008 . a pro-Sassou Nguesso political grouping that was created through an agreement signed by five parties, eight associations, and nine individuals. Gabriel Bokilo was designated as President of the CRC, while Ndalla became its First Vice- President. In Bokilo's absence, Ndalla chaired an ordinary session of the CRC National Coordination on 15 November 2008.Fortun\u00e9 Ibara, \"Claude Ernest Ndalla a dirig\u00e9 les travaux de la session ordinaire du CRC\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 17 November 2008 . At a forum for peace in Congo-Brazzaville, held in Paris in April 2009, Ndalla gave a presentation on \"the major political currents in Congo from 1956 to the present day\".Carmen F\u00e9viliye, \"Un forum pour la Paix aura lieu samedi au palais des Congr\u00e8s de Paris\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 1 April 2009 .\"Le Forum pour la consolidation de la paix \u00e0 Paris - Un d\u00e9bat entre Congolais passionn\u00e9 et serein\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 6 April 2009 . Drawing on decades of political experience, Ndalla argued in his presentation that democracy had to be developed gradually and consolidated through peace. In an October 2009 presidential decree, Sassou Nguesso barred top officials from travelling abroad for the remainder of 2009 except in cases of urgency. Speaking to the BBC, Ndalla explained that some officials were taking needless and expensive trips outside the country, sometimes merely for their own pleasure. He said that henceforth travel plans would have to be reviewed and they would be allowed only if they were considered to be worthwhile.\"Downturn grounds Congo ministers\", BBC News, 9 October 2009. ==Poetry== Ndalla began writing poetry when he was 12 years old and published several collections of poetry later in life. A dedication ceremony for his works was held on 9 March 2006 in the presence of various literary and academic features, including the foremost Congolese poet, Jean- Baptiste Tati-Loutard.\"Claude-Ernest Ndalla rentre dans le monde des \u00e9crivains congolais\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 10 March 2006 . ==Awards and honors== As a former Minister of Sports, Ndalla was awarded an honorary medal by the Supreme Council of Sport in Africa in December 2007.Charlem L\u00e9a Legnoki and Quentin Loubou, \"Le ministre Marcel Mbani est nomm\u00e9 \u00e0 la t\u00eate du Conseil sup\u00e9rieur du sport en Afrique\", Les D\u00e9p\u00eaches de Brazzaville, 20 December 2007 . ==References== Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:Government ministers of the Republic of the Congo Category:University of Toulouse alumni Category:Congolese Party of Labour politicians ",
