    "text": "The British Academy Television Craft Awards is an accolade presented by the British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), a charitable organisation established in 1947, which: \"supports, promotes and develops the art forms of the moving image \u2013 film, television and video games \u2013 by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners and benefiting the public.\" Having previously been handed out with the British Academy Television Awards, the awards were established in 2000 as a way to spotlight technical achievements, without being overshadowed by the production categories. ==Rules== To be eligible for nomination, programmes must be: broadcast in the UK between the eligibility period, on terrestrial, cable, satellite or digital channels; both a financial and creative contribution in the case of an international programme, and have its first broadcast in the UK; an entry for the television awards first (not previously entered for the film or children's awards). The top six programmes and/or individuals in each category are chosen by television voting members and Chapter members in three rounds, to make up the jury shortlist. The shortlist then goes forward to a jury, who decides the top four final nominees and the winners. ==Ceremonies== In the following table, the years correspond to the year the ceremony took place, and are held for achievements of the previous year (e.g. the 2000 awards are celebrated for television productions of 1999). {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Date ! scope=\"col\" | Venue ! scope=\"col\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Host ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | |- ! 2000 | scope=\"row\" |30 April | 195 Piccadilly | Westminster | Gabby Logan | |- ! 2001 | scope=\"row\" |22 April | Sadler's Wells Theatre | Islington | Liza Tarbuck | |- ! 2002 | scope=\"row\" |12 May | Savoy Hotel | Westminster | Harry Enfield | |- ! 2003 | scope=\"row\" |11 May | rowspan=\"6\"|The Dorchester | rowspan=\"8\"|Mayfair | rowspan=2|Alistair McGowan | |- ! 2004 | scope=\"row\" |16 May | |- ! 2005 | scope=\"row\" |8 May | rowspan=2|Jon Culshaw | |- ! 2006 | scope=\"row\" |19 May | |- ! 2007 | scope=\"row\" |22 April | Jon Snow | |- ! 2008 | scope=\"row\" |11 May | Claudia Winkleman | |- ! 2009 | scope=\"row\" |17 May | rowspan=\"2\"|Hilton Hotel, London | Alexander Armstrong | |- ! 2010 | scope=\"row\" |23 May | Christine Bleakley | |- ! 2011 | scope=\"row\" |8 May | rowspan=\"9\"|The Brewery | rowspan=\"9\"|City of London | Stephen Mangan | |- ! 2012 | scope=\"row\" |13 May | Alan Davies | |- ! 2013 | scope=\"row\" |28 April | rowspan=8|Stephen Mangan | |- ! 2014 | scope=\"row\" |24 April | |- ! 2015 | scope=\"row\" |26 April | |- ! 2016 | scope=\"row\" |24 April | |- ! 2017 | scope=\"row\" |23 April | |- ! 2018 | scope=\"row\" |22 April | |- ! 2019 | scope=\"row\" |28 April | |- ! 2020 | scope=\"row\" |17 July | colspan=\"3\" | |} ==Categories== As of 2012, the awards include twelve competitive categories: {| |- valign=top | *Breakthrough Talent *Costume Design *Digital Creativity *Director \u2013 Factual *Director \u2013 Fiction *Director \u2013 Multi-Camera *Editing \u2013 Factual *Editing \u2013 Fiction *Entertainment Craft Team *Makeup and Hair Design | *Original Music *Photography \u2013 Factual *Photography and Lighting \u2013 Fiction *Production Design *Sound \u2013 Factual *Sound \u2013 Fiction *Visual and Graphic Effects *Writer \u2013 Comedy *Writer \u2013 Drama |} A Special Award is also presented, at the discretion of the Television Committee, which \"honour[s] an individual or a team of craftspeople for outstanding creative contribution in the craft sector.\" ==References== ==External links== * * TV Craft section of BAFTA Awards Database Category:British Academy of Film and Television Arts \\+ Category:British television awards Category:Awards established in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
