    "text": "Charles Stanard Severance (born September 25, 1960) is a convicted American serial killer whose crimes took place in Alexandria, Virginia between 2003 and 2014. He was convicted by a Virginia court in 2016 of three shooting deaths and sentenced to life in prison plus an additional 48 years. https://www.northernvirginiamag.com/culture/culture- features/2020/04/22/recently-released-the-parable-of-the-knocker-sheds-new- light-on-charles-severance/ He was tried for the killings of three individuals: Ruthanne Lodato in 2014, Ronald Kirby in 2013, and Nancy Dunning in 2003. The case received considerable attention in the city because Severance (as convicted) attacked in broad daylight by knocking on victim's doors and killing those who answered with a .22 caliber firearm, with investigators eventually finding writings from Severance titled \"Knock. Talk. Enter. Kill. Exit. Murder.\" Severance was ultimately arrested on March 13, 2014 following the release of a police sketch taken after the shooting of Lodato. Prosecutors alleged he did so out of hatred for elites in the generally wealthy city of Alexandria. == See also == * List of serial killers in the United States ==References== Category:1960 births Category:People from Fairfax, Virginia Category:American serial killers Category:People convicted of murder by Virginia Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by Virginia Category:Alexandria, Virginia Category:Living people ",
