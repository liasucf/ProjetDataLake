    "text": "Timber is a 1941 animated short film, featuring Donald Duck and Pete. ==Synopsis== Donald Duck is portrayed as a hobo, walking along railroad tracks singing \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\". He smells tasty things, and follows the scent to a log cabin which, unfortunately, is the home of the lumberjack Peg-Leg Pete. While Pete is trying to enjoy lunch, Donald steals all the food off of Pete's table, which makes Pete angry. Pete then hands Donald a stick of dynamite which Donald takes, thinking it is food; it blows up on him. Pete (in a French-Canadian accent) asks Donald whether he wants food. When Donald says \"Yes\", Pete throws an axe at Donald, telling him to get to work. The axe is so heavy it pushes Donald into the trunk of a tree. In an attempt to get out of the job, Donald breaks the axe with a stone and shows it to Pete, but Pete simply responds by putting the blade on a piece of wood and hitting it, creating a new handle. Donald ends up swinging the axe so hard it breaks the blade off, which goes over Pete and cuts off part of his pants. Deciding that it is too hard to work with an old-fashioned axe, Donald finds a crosscut saw in a tree trunk and begins using it instead. When the saw gets stuck in the thick bark of the tree and jams, Donald attempts to pull it, but the force pushes Donald backwards and throws him into Pete, knocking both to the ground. Donald ends up inside of Pete's shirt along with the saw, which apparently is partially inside Pete's belly. Donald starts pulling the saw out, tickling Pete. Later however, Pete gets up and angrily chases Donald, threatening to \"kill you [Donald] to pieces.\" While running away, the saw suddenly vibrates back and forth. Donald bounces on the ground with the saw and flies over Pete, with the saw's ends hitting Pete in the bottom and pushing his head in the ground. As Pete notices him, Donald chops off a tree branch, causing it to fall on Pete. But Pete quickly gets up and kicks Donald, causing him to get his head stuck between the saw's ends. As Donald tries to free himself, he accidentally chops down a huge tree. The tree collapses and falls on Pete. Furious, Pete roars like a lion with anger and begins chasing Donald. The chase leads Donald and Pete onto a railroad track, where they begin a chase on flatcars. After chasing Donald through a tunnel, Pete tries to grab Donald by the tail, but fails every time, forcing him to pump his flatcar fast enough to bump Donald's rear end. As Donald gets away, Pete resorts to using a peavey to stab Donald. However, he only ends up taking pieces off of Donald's flatcar until it is nothing but wheels. Pete then sharpens the tip of the peavey and increases its temperature by laying it on his flatcar's wheel so that it burns Donald. But the heat only causes Donald to go faster. Donald then jumps off and pulls a lever at a station, triggering a coal storage door. The coal lands right onto Pete and dismantles his flatcar, leaving him cycling on one wheel. Now fleeing on foot, Donald outruns Pete and, in the nick of time, pulls a lever which turns the track the other way, causing Pete to veer off course and crash through a row of boxcars. Satisfied, Donald says farewell to Pete through the boxcar hole, and walks off into the sunset, singing \"She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain\". ==Voice actors== * Donald Duck: Clarence Nash * Pete: Billy Bletcher ==References== ==External links== * * *More Information Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:American films Category:1941 films Category:Donald Duck short films Category:1941 animated films Category:Films directed by Jack King Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Oliver Wallace ",
