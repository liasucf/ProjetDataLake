In the 1970s he was also part of guitarist Joe Pass's trio. He was based in Los Angeles at this time; critic Ted Panken described him and Donald Bailey as \"first-call drummers\" of the area. Severino appeared on Clark Terry's Memories of Duke album. Taking after his father, Severino and Shelly Manne invented a drum with quick changeable batter heads. ==Discography== * 1965 Woman Talk, Carmen McRae * 1965 \"Live\" and Wailing, Carmen McRae * 1965 Billie Holiday Revisited, Billie Holiday * 1965 Red Soul, Red Holloway * 1967 Les Is More, Les McCann * 1973 It Takes a Whole Lot of Human Feeling, Carmen McRae * 1974 Live at Donte's Joe Pass * 1978 Soul Believer, Milt Jackson * 1979 Bags' Bag, Milt Jackson * 1980 Memories of Duke, Clark Terry * 1980 Mello' as a Cello, Al Viola * 1981 My Desiree, Tommy Tedesco * 1983 Coming Out, Johnny O'Neal * 1985 The River, Monty Alexander * 1992 Fine Fretted Friend, Tommy Tedesco * 1992 My Flame, Jim Nichols * 1992 Velvet Soul, Carmen McRae * 1994 Maybeck Recital Hall Series Vol. 40, Monty Alexander * 1995 I Was Born in Love with You, Denise Jannah * 1997 Guitar Virtuoso, Joe Pass * 1998 How's Your Mother?, Les McCann * 2000 Ballad Essentials, Monty Alexander * 2000 Les Incontournables, Clark Terry * 2000 Live in Las Vegas 1962, Warne Marsh * 2000 Ms. Jazz, Carmen McRae * 2000 Resonance, Joe Pass * 2003 I'll Never Be the Same, Marilena Paradisi * 2005 Live at the Iridium, Monty Alexander * 2006 Look at Me Now!, Laika Fatien * 2010 Second Chance, Irene Kral ==References== Category:1936 births Category:1987 deaths Category:American jazz drummers Category:American jazz percussionists Category:American jazz composers Category:American male jazz composers Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American drummers Category:American male drummers Category:20th-century American male musicians Category:20th-century jazz composers ",
