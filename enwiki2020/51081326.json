Engelmuller driving gloves - vintage poster Emil Engelm\u00fcller inherited the Engelm\u00fcller glove shop in 1895 from his father Ferdinand Engelm\u00fcller. Ferdinand founded his first glove shop in Prague in 1865, but due to high quality of his products he was soon able to expand across the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and he opened new shops in Vienna and Budapest. After ten years of Emil Engelm\u00fcller\u2019s management, in February 1904, Engelm\u00fcller presented new driving products at the first automobile exhibition in Bohemia, where the Czech automobile club was founded. Besides new gloves, the range featured elegant leather coats, drivers\u2019 peaked caps and leather helmets. Since then, Engelm\u00fcller was forever connected with driving gloves and motoring accessories. \u201cMr Emil Engelm\u00fcller is our leading designer in his field.\u201d wrote the magazine Sport & Games in 1908. The outbreak of World War I led to a decline in exports and the loss of some traditional European markets, but this was quickly counterbalanced by supplies to the Austro-Hungarian and German armies. In 1915, Emil Engelm\u00fcller\u2019s son Richard enrolled in the air force, and after the war brought back inspiration from the \u201clozenge\u201d camouflage used on his aircraft. This design pattern would later become a hallmark of the brand. The First Republic of Czechoslovakia brought the Engelm\u00fcller brand its heyday. Its shops offered leather suits, caps, gloves and trousers made of the best Russian and Swedish leather. Its advertisements appeared in the majority of motoring and society magazines, such as Automobil, Motor Revue or Touch of society. Engelm\u00fcller gloves were worn by car racing driver Eli\u0161ka Junkov\u00e1, by Czech aerobatics legend Franti\u0161ek Nov\u00e1k, actress L\u00edda Baarov\u00e1 and many others. Engelm\u00fcller glove styles were also popular with international automobile racing stars such as Tazio Nuvolari, Louis Chiron and Bernd Rosemeyer. Before World War II, the Engelm\u00fcller company was manufacturing gloves for pilots of Czechoslovak Air Force and many Czech pilots still wore them during Battle Of Britain while fighting for Royal Air Force. After German occupation in 1939, the company\u2019s entire output was commandeered by the Wehrmacht. The worst moment for Engelm\u00fcller was still yet to come. Emil Engelm\u00fcller died in 1944, one year before the end of the war, and in 1948, the company was nationalised by the new Communist regime. Engelmuller was revived as gloves and luxury motoring-related goods manufacturer in 2015, and on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of its founding, the brand has launched a new collection that pays homage to its past, ensuring that its tradition lives on. ==References== Category:1873 births Category:1944 deaths Category:19th-century Czech businesspeople Category:20th-century Czech people Category:People from Prague Category:Czech businesspeople Category:Manufacturing businesspeople Category:Leather manufacturers Category:Gloves ",
