    "text": "List of British banknotes and coins, with commonly used terms. ==Coins== ==Pre-decimal== Prior to decimalisation in 1971, there were 12 pence (written as 12d) in a shilling (written as 1s or 1/-) and 20 shillings in a pound, written as \u00a31 (occasionally \"L\" was used instead of the pound sign, \u00a3). There were therefore 240 pence in a pound. For example, 2 pounds 14 shillings and 5 pence could have been written as \u00a32 14s 5d or \u00a32 14/5. The value of some coins fluctuated, particularly in the reigns of James I and Charles I. The value of a guinea fluctuated between 20 and 30 shillings before being fixed at 21 shillings in December 1717. These are denominations of British, or earlier English, coins \u2013 Scottish coins had different values. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"100%\" ! scope=\"col\" | Coin ! scope=\"col\" | Pre-decimalisation value ! scope=\"col\" | Post-decimalisation value ! scope=\"col\" | Dates of use ! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Notes |- | MiteMentioned in the King James Bible: Mark 12:41\u20134, but referring to a European currency. http://www.medievalcoinage.com/denominations/index.htm | d; see notes || \u00a30.0001736; see notes || Tudor dates, back to Anglo-Saxon England, at least. | In Tudor times, mites weren't minted but were used in accounting; one mite was one twenty-fourth of a penny or one sixth of a farthing.

The medieval florins were withdrawn within a year because they contained insufficient gold for their face value and thus were unacceptable to merchants.

Originally the term \"new pence\" was used; the word \"new\" was dropped from the coinage in 1983. The old shilling equated to five (new) pence, and, for example, \u00a32 10s 6d became . The symbol for the (old) penny, \"d\", was replaced by \"p\" (or initially sometimes \"np\", for new pence). Thus 72 pence can be written as \u00a30.72 or 72p; both were commonly read as \"seventy-two pee\". {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"75%\" |+ Post-decimalisation British coins. |- ! Name !
