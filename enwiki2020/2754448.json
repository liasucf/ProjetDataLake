    "text": "Rong\u00e9 Island (also Curville Island, De Rong\u00e9 Island, Isla Curville, or Rouge Island) is a high, rugged island long, the largest island of the group which forms the west side of Errera Channel, off the west coast of Graham Land in Antarctica. Rong\u00e9 Island was discovered by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition (BAE) of 1897\u20131899 under Adrien de Gerlache who named it for Madame de Rong\u00e9 (cousin of Johannes Ronge), a contributor to the expedition. == Geography == Ketley Point forms the western end of Rong\u00e9 Island. Sherlac Point marks the southeast end of the island. Both were charted by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Gerlache and named by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960. Ketley was named for John Ketley, a Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey (FIDS) assistant surveyor at the Danco Island station in 1956 and at Arthur Harbour in 1957. Sherlac was initially named \"Cap Charles\" by Gerlache, but to avoid confusion with Charles Point in Hughes Bay, it was renamed \"Sherlac\", an anagram of Charles. ==See also== * Gerlache Strait Geology * Composite Antarctic Gazetteer * List of Antarctic and sub-Antarctic islands * List of Antarctic islands south of 60\u00b0 S * SCAR * Territorial claims in Antarctica ==References== Category:Islands of Graham Land Category:Danco Coast ",
