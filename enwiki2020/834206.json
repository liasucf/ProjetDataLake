    "text": "Troll 1956 The Troll was a small car made by Troll Plastik & Bilindustri of Lunde, Norway, from 1956 to 1958. It was one of few attempts at car production in Norway, but only five cars were ever built. ==The car== The Troll was built as a 2+2 sports car with a glass-reinforced plastic (or fibreglass) body. The idea was to build the first mass-produced car outside the US in this material. In the US Chevrolet made its Corvette in fibreglass, but no one in Europe had built cars in plastic, except for the East German Trabant, which was also a 2-cylinder, 2-stroke car. Fibreglass was a relatively new material in the late 1950s, and the benefits were many. It would not rust, it would be 130 kg lighter than an equivalent metal car, and the production would be significantly simpler and therefore cheaper. The chassis was taken from a Gutbrod Superior and made 15 cm longer. The gearbox was a three speed Hurth gearbox. ===Engine=== *700 cc straight-twin two-stroke engines made by Gutbrod of Germany with Bosch fuel injection. *30 hp (22 kW) *Top speed: ca 130 km/h *Fuel consumption: 5 litres/100 km (47mpg) There were plans to change to a SAAB engine, but these were never implemented. ==The story== ===The beginning=== Engineer Per Kohl-Larsen got hold of the molds for the car in Germany. The man behind the design was Hanns Trippel. ===The first car=== The first Troll car was revealed to the press in October 1956. It was not completely finished, and although the form of the chassis was final, the car could not be driven. This car was later used as a prototype, and many changes were made during later testing. Norwegian and foreign press showed much enthusiasm towards the project, and the car was compared with brands like Porsche, Citro\u00ebn and SAAB. The first customer received his car May 1, 1957. ===Production and bankruptcy=== As the production commenced, Kohl-Larsen had to work hard to get a permit from the government to sell the car. He was allowed to sell only 15 cars in Norway. The reason for this was a barter treaty Norway had with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to buy cars from them as they bought fish products from Norway. The government was afraid that domestic car production would disrupt this trading balance. Kohl-Larsen therefore started plans to export the cars to Germany and Denmark. There were also requests from other countries like Finland and Belgium. At one point there were plans to build 2,000 cars per year, but after some moderation they said they would be happy with one finished car per day. However, the company was never allowed to sell more than those 15 cars on the Norwegian market. In addition they did not secure the investment capital necessary to start large scale production. When the government made it clear that they never wanted to support the Troll car, all the potential investors closed negotiations. Hence, one of Norway's few ventures into car production went bankrupt in early 1958. Only five complete cars had been produced. ==External links== *Online.no: The Troll automobile Category:Car manufacturers of Norway Category:Defunct motor vehicle manufacturers Category:Defunct companies of Norway Category:Cars introduced in 1956 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1956 Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies disestablished in 1958 Category:1956 establishments in Norway Category:1958 disestablishments in Norway ",
