Paul, which follows 2017's Gumbo Unplugged, was described by Morton to be \"the most honest expression of myself and my art that I've ever made\". \"Everybody calls me PJ, but I came into this world as Paul. That struck me as the perfect title for this album because Paul is the purest form of who I am.\" According to Morton, Gumbo was originally set to be his last album, but his move back to his hometown re-inspired him. \"I was struggling to figure out who I wanted to be and where I could fit in as a solo artist, and it honestly left me feeling pretty defeated,\" he said. \"Coming back to New Orleans inspired a lot of new growth and perspective, though, and it helped me realize that the best thing I could be was myself.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Top Album Sales | 66 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Top Current Albums | 48 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Digital Albums | 24 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Independent Albums | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard R&B;/Hip-Hop Album Sales | 9 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard Heatseekers Albums | 4 |- |} ==References== Category:2019 albums Category:PJ Morton albums ",
