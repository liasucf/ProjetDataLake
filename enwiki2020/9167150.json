When in his early twenties, Reilly joined his father's firm in the pharmaceutical business. The company did very well, but was hit hard when Britain left the Gold standard system in the early 1930s. Reilly was interned in Vichy France during World War II. He returned to England after the war ended, and became a full-time chess editor and writer.BCM, Sept. 1981 Reilly won the Nice Club championship in 1924.
