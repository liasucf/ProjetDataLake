    "text": ", was a biweekly manga anthology published by Shueisha under the Jump line of magazines. Released in Japan on December 20, 1986, the magazine provided serialized chapters of various seinen manga series. The manga series were published under the Jump Comics Deluxe imprint. == History == The magazine started as a special issue of Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump (WJ) on December 20, 1986. It later got split into its own independent bi-monthly manga anthology. It was primarily drama manga and was intended for young adult males in their early years of college. Super Jump manga artists were normally Sh\u014dnen artists from Weekly Jump, or were supported by another sh\u014dnen magazine. Some Weekly Jump series moved with Super Jump's split, due to their higher age level (e.g. Cobra). Very rarely Weekly Jump handed a series over to Weekly Young Jump. If it was, the manga had a much more mature audience. Shueisha (publisher of Super Jump and other Jump anthologies) was worried that if too many series were moved, the younger fans would have been exposed to older, mature series (also an issue with other major Japanese publishing companies). Titles like Business Jump, Ultra Jump, etc. were restricted from having Weekly Jump series moved into their anthologies. On December 11, 1988 Super Jump made a special anthology; . The \"Oh\" in Oh Super Jump stands for \"Otaku\" (the name for an obsessive anime and manga fan). Some series from the offshoot have also been moved to the main magazine in 2007. Super Jump published its last issue in late 2011. Three ongoing series were moved to a new title, Grand Jump. == Features == === Oh Super Jump === was an offshoot of the leading magazine, Super Jump. Oh Super Jump started as a special issue of the main manga magazine Super Jump in January 2004. After 2004 the magazine became a monthly publication, with many serializations.

The \"Oh\" in Oh Super Jump stood for Otaku, a name for an established anime and manga fan. === Serializations === {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background: #FFF;\" width=\"99%\" !Title !Began !Ended !Author/Illustrator |- | |2001 | |Akira Miyashita |- | |2009 |Current |Ky\u014d Hatsuki |- | |2008 |Current |Hikari Hayakawa, Kokura Hashimoto |- | |2008 |Current |Ton \u014cgawara |- | |2009 |Current |Yua Kotegawa |- | |2010 |Current |Hiroyuki Shouji |- | |2000 |2010 |Motoka Murakami |- | |1991 |2011 |Ai Eishi, Katsura Satomi |- | |2010 |Current |Kenichi Kotani |- | | | |Yasutaka Togashi |- | |2010 |Current |Makoto Samejima |- | | | |Hidebu Takahashi |- | |2008 |Current |Y\u016bji Kitamura |- | |2008 |Current |Hiroshi Hoshino |- | |2008 |Current |Masaya Tokuhiro |- | | | |Sh\u014d Kitagawa |- | | | |Takeshi Wakasha |- | | | |Sh\u014d Makura, Takeshi Okano |} ==== Former series ==== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background: #FFF;\" width=\"99%\" !Title !Began !Ended !Author/Illustrator |- | |1993 |1994 |Masami Kurumada |- | | | |Shinji Hiramatsu |- | |2004 |2011 |Araki Shiro, Takeshi Nagatomo |- | | | |Masatoshi Usune |- | | | |Hikari Hayakawa, Kokura Hashimoto |- | | | |Onisoto Fukunai, Kazutoshi Yamane |- | | | |Sachiji Takahashi |- | |2003 |2006 |Baku Yumemakura, Satoshi Noguchi |- | | | |Yasuhiro Nakanishi |- | | | |Yoshinobu Yamaguchi |- | | | |Tsukasa Yamaguchi |- | | | |Yasuhiro Nakanishi |- | | | |Buichi Terasawa |- | | | |Buichi Terasawa |- | | | |Jun Tomizawa |- | | | |Tei Ogata |- | | | |Masaya Tokuhiro |- | | | |Y\u016b Terashima, Hiroshi Koizumi |- | | | |Makoto Isshiki |- | | | |Yoshihiro Takahashi |- | | | |Ry\u014d Kuraka, Manabu Narita |- | | | |Ry\u014dka Sh\u016b, Satoru Mori |- | | | |Kengo Kaji, Hijiri Kisaki |- | |1995 |2002 |Buichi Terasawa |- | |1992 |1997 |Tatsuya Egawa |- | | | |Kanrai K\u014d-samurai |- | | | |Ry\u014dka Sh\u016b, Yasuteru Iwata |- | | | |Hirohiko Araki |- | | | |Kazuma, Itokatsu |- | | | |Masaya Tokuhiro |- | | | |K\u014dichi Masuno |- | | | |\u014cmaru Takeshi, Shinji Imaizumi |- | | | |Bakunin Watanabe |- | | | |Kazuo Akasaka |- | | | |Akira Miyashita |- | | | |Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro |- | | | |Kokorozashi Motomiya |- | | | |Izumi Matsumoto |- | | | |Ke\u012bchi It\u014d |- | | | |Ken'ichi Kotani |- | | | |Ken'ichi Kotani |- | | | |Tsunomaru |- | | | |Shin Yoshikawa |- | | | |Baku Yumemakura, Hideaki Koyasu, Satoshi Noguchi |- | | | |Masao Yajima, Takeshi Wakasa |- | | | |Tanakajun |- | | | |Masao Yajima, Funwari |- | | | |Takeshi Wakasa |- | | | |Gatsu J\u014dyubi, Aokitetsuo |- | | | |Ayumu Nanase |- | | | |Tsuyoshi Adachi |- | |2006 |2007 |Y\u014dz\u014dr\u014d Kanari, Yutaka Takahashi |- | | | |Keishi Edogawa, Y\u014dji Ishiwatari |- | | | |Masaya Tokuhiro |- | | | |Masayuki Yamamoto |- | | | |Hitoshi K\u014d, Shinji Imaizumi, Kisho |- | | | |Shinji Hiramatsu |- | |2000 |2002 |Shinji Hiramatsu |- | | | |Hisashi Tanaka |- | |2004 |2004 |Takaji Yamasaki |- | | | |Kanrai K\u014d-samurai |- | | | |Buronson, Tsuyoshi Adachi |- | | | |K\u014dnen Shimabukuro |- | | | |Baku Yumemakura, Y\u016bko Umino |- | | | |Hikari Hayakawa, Kokura Hashimoto |- | |2003 |2003 | |- | |2001 |2002 | |- | |2002 |2002 |Buichi Terasawa |- | |2002 |2002 | |- | |2001 |2002 |Aieishi, Katsura Satomi |- | |2000 |2009 |Masami Kurumada |- |Released in volume format as | | |Ken'ichi Kotani |- | | | |B\u014d Mitaki |- | | | |Tsukasa Yamaguchi |- | |2007 | |Hiroyuki Tamakoshi |- | |2006 | |Bakunin Watanabe |- | | | |Aki Katsu |- | |2008 | |Takeshi Takahashi |- | |2007 | |Ry\u014d Kuraka, Kaoru Tsukishima |- | |2008 | |Kichir\u014d Nabeta, Yasuteru Iwata |- | |2008 | |Hiroshi Hashimoto, Kensaku Watanabe, Kumichi Yoshiduki |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1986 establishments in Japan Category:2011 disestablishments in Japan Category:Defunct magazines published in Japan Category:Magazines established in 1986 Category:Magazines disestablished in 2011 Category:Magazines published in Tokyo Category:Monthly manga magazines published in Japan Category:Shueisha magazines Category:Seinen manga magazines Category:Semimonthly manga magazines published in Japan ",
