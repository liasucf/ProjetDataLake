The film stars Allu Arjun and Pooja Hegde in the lead roles, while Rao Ramesh, Subbaraju, Chandra Mohan, and Murali Sharma play supporting roles. Devi Sri Prasad composed the film's music, while Ayananka Bose handled the cinematography. Principal photography commenced in August 2016 in Hyderabad. The production crew also chose Abu Dhabi as a filming location, as they would benefit from the Emirate's 30% film production rebate. The film grossed approximately 115.10 crore in its theatrical run. == Plot == Duvvada Jagannadham Shastri (Allu Arjun) is a cook working as a caterer in Vijayawada along with his family. He rescues a high-profile cop named Purushottam (Murali Sharma) from the attack of a crime mafia in Hyderabad. Seeing the quality of a rebellion in the priest and his sharpshooting skills, Purushottam trains Jagannadham to become DJ, an undercover officer who fights crime in the disguise of a Brahmin priest. Jagannadham falls in love with Pooja (Pooja Hegde) the daughter of a corrupt home minister named Pushpam (Posani Krishna Murali) involved with yet another real estate crime lord, Royyala Naidu (Rao Ramesh). Royyala Naidu operates Naidu Industries and the Agro Diamond Financing company in disguise. On the other hand, DJ decides to take on Royyala Naidu in his mission but does not know who he is in actual life. The rest of the story is how DJ uses Royyala Naidu's son Royyala Avinash (Subbaraju), who suffers with histrionic personality disorder, and through him, DJ destroys Royyala Naidu's corrupt business empire, thereby rescuing the Agro Diamond scam victims. == Cast == * Allu Arjun as Duvvada Jagannadham Shastri / DJ * Pooja Hegde as Pooja\"Pooja Hegde finalised for Allu Arjun's next\".
