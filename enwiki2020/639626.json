Their music has been featured on the soundtracks for three films, The Basketball Diaries, I Know What You Did Last Summer, and Homegrown. They disbanded in 1998 and then re-emerged more than a decade later to perform more shows in 2010, with Willman hopeful of releasing their third album. As of May 2010, the band consisted of lead vocalist Ty Willman, guitarist Dana Turner, and drummer Geoff Reading, with guitarist Mike Squires and vocalist Christa Wells joining them for the reunion shows. ==History== ===Early years as Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys (1989\u20131992)=== Green Apple Quick Step started as the Tacoma- based band, Inspector Luv and the Ride Me Babys, consisting of vocalist Tyler Willman, guitarists Steve Ross and Dan Kempthorne, drummer Bob Martin and bassist Eric Munday. The band played a few shows locally and in 1989, Aroma Records released 700 copies of their numbered, limited edition purple vinyl EP,\"Another World\", which was recorded at Tombstone Records and contained 4 songs: \"Soul Step\", \"Seamonkeys\", \"Another World\", and \"Eleventeen\".

They performed locally, sharing bills with Sweet Water, Meddaphysical and Best Kissers in the World, before recording their debut album, Wonderful Virus, at Bad Animals Studios in Seattle The album was produced by Daniel Rey and released in 1993 through The Medicine Label, which was initially backed by Reprise Records before switching to Giant Records. They filmed a music video for the album track \"Dirty Water Ocean\" which depicted the band in a garbage sluice. The band toured in support of the album, performing with bands that included The Pleasure Elite Gruntruck and Sister Psychic. In order to keep secret a Pearl Jam show at the Off Ramp in Seattle, it was billed as a Green Apple Quick Step show, though the band was touring Eastern Washington at the time. In the middle of their fourth US tour in support of Wonderful Virus, their van was stolen along with all of their equipment inside. The band later packed up their remaining belongings and returned to Seattle to begin recording their second album. ===Reloaded (1994\u20131996)=== With Nick DiDia and Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard producing, Green Apple Quick Step began recording their second album in October 1994. The band had befriended Gossard previously and asked if he would be interested in working with the band. The album was primarily recorded at Gossard's home studio, though Gossard asked not to receive any royalties. Unlike Wonderful Virus, their second album featured Willman splitting vocal harmonies with Braeden. Green Apple Quick Step's second album entitled Reloaded was released on May 23, 1995, through The Medicine Label and was distributed by WEA. The song \"Dizzy\", which was featured on the soundtrack to the film The Basketball Diaries, was chosen as the band's first single from the album, followed by \"Los Vargos\" as the second single, while a three-song sampler of \"Los Vargos\", \u201cUnderwater\" and \"Ed No. 5\" was sent to metal and hard rock radio stations.

Willman and Braeden contributed to the song \"Oh! Sweet Nuthin'\", by Mike McCready's side-project $10,000 Gold Chain, which was featured on the soundtrack to the 1996 film The Cable Guy. Willman also sang with Devilhead, led by Kevin Wood and former members of Hater; recording lead vocals for one song, Buying Milk, on their album Pest Control, released in 1996 on Loosegroove Records. ===New Disaster and lineup changes (1996\u20131998)=== Green Apple Quick Step then signed with Columbia Records and spent over a year writing songs for their new album, prior to which, guitarist Ross left the band to later, along with Kempthorne, form The Briefs, under the pseudonym Steve E. Nix and Daniel J. Travanti. Guitarist Dana Turner took Ross' place, and they recorded their third album in Los Angeles at Ocean Way Studios with producer Matt Wallace. GAQS' drummer Geoff Reading noted in a March 2010 issue of his regular column in the Weekly Volcano that after New Disaster was recorded, drummer Bob Martin was also replaced, by Dain Hudson who appeared on the recording and later Geoff Reading who played live shows. Reading joined the band in June 1997 following a successful tryout in May 1997 and they recorded a music video for the album song \"Kid\", which was later shown on MTV and featured on the soundtrack to the 1997 film I Know What You Did Last Summer. The band performed at the premier of the film, receiving some radio airplay, which was later re-serviced to Seattle radio stations KNDD, KISW, Cleveland station WENZ, and Boston station WBCN. Another song from the album, \"Stars\", was featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 comedy-thriller film Homegrown. Willman formed a side project, Calm Down Juanita, with drummer Kevin Guess, that featured bassist Cole Peterson, engineer & project catalyst Steve Wilmans, and contributions from several other notable \"players\", including Braeden, who also plays bass on one song, Girlfriend, on the five-song EP that band recorded during the summer of 1997. Green Apple Quick Step continued to play shows in Seattle, and they played a show with 10 Minute Warning in Portland. Though a March 3, 1998 release date was set for New Disaster, Green Apple Quick Step's management was not satisfied with the label's efforts to promote the album, pulling it from the label with hopes of gaining another record deal. Green Apple Quick Step disbanded soon after. ===Post\u2013breakup activities (1998\u20132009)=== Calm Down Juanita released their self-titled debut EP in 1998, and then recorded a follow-up LP, Undertown, which they released in 2002. Braeden also formed a female trio called Celebrity Damage. Willman also recorded lead and backing vocals for some tracks on Stone Gossard's debut solo album, Bayleaf, released in 2001. One of the tracks he sang, \"Unhand Me\", was chosen as the first single from the album. Willman also performed with several other projects including Hula Bess in July 1999, with former Gigolo Aunts' Phil Hurley and Mass Sugar in 2007\u20132008. Reading joined New American Shame, in 1999, before joining Loaded, with former Guns N' Roses bassist Duff McKagan, the following year.

The original line up less Bob Martin (Geoff Reading on drums). They also played the Crocodile on December 23, 2018. ==Musical style== Green Apple Quick Step's music was described as post-grunge, alternative rock, pop rock and psychedelic rock. They have drawn some comparisons to the music of Jane's Addiction and Porno for Pyros. Reviewing Reloaded for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine stated that the band \"expands their sound by adding other styles to their basic grunge rock\" and that \"Experimenting with psychedelia and adding a better pop sensibility, the band sounds more confident and accomplished\". Erlewine also reviewed the unreleased New Disaster album, stating that \"the band concentrates on hard-edged post- grunge rock.\", and said of their sound that it was \"tighter than ever, but they still have trouble coming up with indelible hooks and melodies.\" ==Band members== *Tyler Willman \u2013 lead vocals (1991\u20131998, 2009\u2013present) *Mari Ann Braeden \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (1991\u20131998, 2018-present) *Daniel Kempthorne \u2013 guitar, backing vocals (1991\u20131998, 2018-present) *Geoff Reading \u2013 drums (1997\u20131998, 2009\u2013present) *Steve Ross \u2013 guitar (1991\u20131997, 2018-present) ;Former members *Bob Martin \u2013 drums (1991\u20131997) *Dana Turner \u2013 guitar (1996\u20131998, 2009) ==Discography== * Wonderful Virus (1993) * Reloaded (1995) * New Disaster (1998) ==References== ==Further reading== * * * ==External links== * *Feel my Way video *Kid video *Los Vargos video Category:American post-grunge musical groups Category:Columbia Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1998 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2009 Category:Musical groups from Seattle ",
