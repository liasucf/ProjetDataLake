    "text": "Fernando Kelley Poe II (May 4, 1943 \u2013 May 20, 1995), professionally known as Andy Poe, was a Filipino actor. He was a brother of Philippine action movie king Fernando Poe Jr. ==Early life and career== He was born Fernando Kelley Poe II on May 4, 1943, son of Filipino actor Fernando Poe, Sr. and Irish American mestiza wife Elizabeth \"Bessie\" Kelley, and brother of Elizabeth or Liza, Genevieve, Evangeline, Ronald Allan (\"Ronnie\") and Freddie Poe, as well as half-brother of Conrad Poe. Poe studied at the San Beda College in Mendiola, Manila from his elementary years up to his sophomore high school years. He transferred to the Jos\u00e9 Rizal College for junior and senior high school. He enrolled at the University of the Philippines to study Architecture. After college, he pursued a career in the movies like his older brother Ronnie. Because his real name was used by Ronnie professionally (\"Fernando Poe Jr.\"), he opted to use his nickname \"Andy\" as his professional name. ==Marriage== In 1979, he met 20-year-old, Yvette Christine de Marcaida who was the leading lady of his brother FPJ in \"Ang Lihim Ng Guadalupe\" which was the entry of FPJ Productions in the 1979 Metro Manila Film Festival. Yvette descended from the Portuguese-Indian Barrettos of the Philippines and distantly related to the Barrettos based in Zambales. Poe and de Marcaida got married in Matinez County, California, on July 31, 1980. They had two sons, Fernando Poe IV (\"Donnie\") and Alexander Vaughn Poe (\"Lex\") in 1981 and 1983 respectively. From 1982 to 1984, Poe and his wife Yvette de Marcaida established DAY FILMS and produced three movies namely: Pamilya Dimagiba, Brando Bandido, and Magtago Ka Na Sa Pinanggalingan Mo. In 1985, Poe and his family immigrated to the United States and resided in Jersey City, New Jersey, until 1993 where the couple became active in the real estate business as realtors with Century 21. Poe returned to the Philippines in 1993 and did several movies until his sudden demise in 1995. ==Filmography== ===Movies=== * Bukas, Bibitayin si Itay (1995) * Gising na ang Higanteng Natutulog (1995) as Delfin Guerrero * Lagalag: The Eddie Fernandez Story (1994) * Megamol (1994) as Elias * Nandito Ako (1993) as Col.
