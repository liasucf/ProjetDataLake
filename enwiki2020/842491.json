WMNI is locally owned by Columbus-based North American Broadcasting Company, Inc. It broadcasts with one kilowatt of power during the day, but reduces to 500 watts at night. The Indy 500, the Brickyard 400, Notre Dame football, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Columbus Clippers are all carried on the station. The studios are located on Dublin Road in Marble Cliff while the transmitter is in Grove City. WMNI went from carrying chiefly a satellite-delivered music format (\"Adult Standards\" from Westwood One) to mostly local programming. As of August 2007, WMNI reportedly shifted back to the Westwood One (later Dial Global) \"Adult Standards\" format. Previously, WMNI was Columbus's predominant country music station through the 1970s and 1980s. On Thursday, June 14, 2012 at 6:00 a.m., WMNI switched to a simulcast of WMNI-FM, which had switched from a classic hits format as WTDA-FM to a news format. On Thursday July 18, 2013, the AM/FM simulcast ended, with WMNI returning to the adult standards format. On Saturday and Sunday mornings, WMNI hosts radio shows such as Plant Talk with Fred Hower and At Home With Gary Sullivan (specialty programs list) On June 12, 2017, WMNI changed their format from adult standards to soft adult contemporary, branded as \"Easy 95.1 & 920\" (simulcast on FM translator W236CZ 95.1 FM Columbus).WMNI Rebrands as Easy 95.1 ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Corporate Website * MNI Category:Radio stations established in 1958 Category:Soft adult contemporary radio stations in the United States Category:1958 establishments in Ohio ",
