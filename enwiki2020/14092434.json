    "text": "The bibcode (also known as the refcode) is a compact identifier used by several astronomical data systems to uniquely specify literature references. == Adoption == The Bibliographic Reference Code (refcode) was originally developed to be used in SIMBAD and the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED), but it became a de facto standard and is now used more widely, for example, by the NASA Astrophysics Data System who coined and prefer the term \"bibcode\". == Format == The code has a fixed length of 19 characters and has the form :`YYYYJJJJJVVVVMPPPPA` where `YYYY` is the four-digit year of the reference and `JJJJJ` is a code indicating where the reference was published. In the case of a journal reference, `VVVV` is the volume number, `M` indicates the section of the journal where the reference was published (e.g., `L` for a letters section), `PPPP` gives the starting page number, and `A` is the first letter of the last name of the first author. Periods (`.`) are used to fill unused fields and to pad fields out to their fixed length if too short; padding is done on the right for the publication code and on the left for the volume number and page number. Page numbers greater than 9999 are continued in the `M` column. The 6-digit article ID numbers (in lieu of page numbers) used by the Physical Review publications since the late 1990s are treated as follows: The first two digits of the article ID, corresponding to the issue number, are converted to a lower-case letter (01 = a, etc.) and inserted into column `M`. The remaining four digits are used in the page field. == Examples == Some examples of bibcodes are: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Bibcode ! Reference |- | `1974AJ.....79..819H` | |- | `1924MNRAS..84..308E` | |- | `1970ApJ...161L..77K` | |- | `2004PhRvL..93o0801M` | |} == See also == * Digital object identifier == References == Category:Index (publishing) Category:Identifiers Category:Electronic documents Category:Computational astronomy ",
