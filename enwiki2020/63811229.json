Their first venue was the Unanderra Hostel before moving to their current home in 1965, Beaton Park Stadium. In 1979, Basketball Illawarra entered into the newly formed National Basketball League for its inaugural season that year.

Playing as the 'Illawarra Hawks', they were champions of the men's state premier division championship in 1998 and 1999 prior to the formation of the Waratah League. The Hawks men's side were champions of the inaugural Waratah League in 2001 and again in 2011. The women's side were runners-up in the 2011 Waratah League season. === Venue === The Hawks and recreational competitions operated by the association, play games at the Beaton Park Stadium, nicknamed 'The Snake Pit'. The stadium opened in 1965 and is located in the Illawarra suburb of Gwynneville, New South Wales.
