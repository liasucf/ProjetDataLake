    "text": "The Sadista Sisters was a British music band that was active between 1974 and 1987. It was founded by Jude Alderson, Teresa D\u2019Abreu and songwriter Jacky Tayler to perform political cabaret challenging society's treatment of women. They released one self-titled LP (in 1976) for Transatlantic Records, and in their ever changing line-up had artists who would later join bands like Girlschool, The Slits, The Tourists and Au Pairs. The Eurythmics' David A. Stewart played guitar for them in 1977. ==Biography== The Sadista Sisters centred around co-founder Jude Alderson and songwriter Jacky Tayler. Co- founder Teresa D\u2019Abreu left in 1977 as the band gained more of a punk image. Among their productions were Duchess (1979) and Red Door Without a Bolt (1981), for which they received Arts Council funding. They played at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London for five weeks in 1975. They were originally an all female 9-piece group from all different backgrounds and cultures. However, after signing to Transatlantic Records, the record company didn\u2019t think the players were professional enough and brought in male replacements for their album. Although this upset the dynamic of the group, they went on to success and notoriety in Berlin in 1977 turning around the fortunes of the Treibhaus Club.
