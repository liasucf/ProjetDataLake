    "text": "The Fountain of the Centaurs Fountain of the Centaurs is a fountain located on the grounds of the Missouri State Capitol in Jefferson City, Missouri, north of the Capitol building. ==Description== The fountain consists of two separate components, the granite pool containing the bronze centaurs and other figures by Adolph Alexander Weinman and the Signing of the Louisiana Purchase Agreement, a large high relief by Karl Bitter. Both were dedicated in 1927.https://www.missouriartscouncil.org/graphics/assets/documents/fbad2996bfb5.pdf Although the mythical beings in the fountain are labeled as \u201ccentaurs\u201d they are in fact \u201cichthyocentaurs\". This is because the lower portion of their bodies are sea serpents rather than horses. Each of the centaurs is portrayed in a struggle with some sort of creature of the waters. They both are surrounded by playful sea urchins who stray water on them.

Since it was all made of staff and thus perusable and \u201cswept into the dust bins of time,\u201d only his relief showing the signing of the Louisiana Purchase by Robert R. Livingston, James Monroe and \u201cthe amiable\u201d Fran\u00e7ois Barb\u00e9-Marbois was saved. Following the close of the fair Bitter was employed to make \u201cimprovements in a score of delicate details\u201d of the work and it was cast in bronze and placed in the Jefferson Memorial in St. Louis.Schevill, Ferdinand, \u2018Karl Bitter: A Biography\u201d, The University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois, 1917 p.43-45 Bitter was comfortable with the proposed changes and made them, \u201cwithout any special thumbscrew to my conscience\u201dDennis, James M., \u201cKarl Bitter: Architectural Sculptor 1867\u20131915\u201d, University of Wisconsin Press, Madison 1967 A decade later the Missouri Capitol Decoration Committee received permission from Bitter's widow to make another bronze casting of the work and place it in Jefferson City.Pickard, John, \u2018Report of the Capitol Decoration Commission; 1917*1928\u201d Capitol Decoration Commission, Jefferson City, Missouri, 1928 p.33 U.S. postage stamp (c. 1953) commemorating the Louisiana Purchase The relief is used on a US Postal stamp commemorating the 150th anniversary of the event. ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Jefferson City, Missouri Category:Monuments and memorials in Missouri Category:Tourist attractions in Jefferson City, Missouri Category:1924 sculptures Category:Outdoor sculptures in Missouri Category:Nude sculptures in the United States Category:Statues of Presidents of the United States Category:Fish in art Category:Works by Adolph Weinman Category:Louisiana Purchase ",
