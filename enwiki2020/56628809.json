This is a 13-piece big band led by the beautifully weird compositional, instructional, and arranging craziness of Mathias R\u00fcegg. They trash and revere all traditions -- both historical and avant-garde at the same time -- while using them both along with carnival and circus music, classical forms and fugues, and French salon music. ... There are colors, harmonies, and polyphonal systems at work here that will be recalled as the glory years of Euro big-band jazz in the future, and the evocative timbral nature of R\u00fcegg's compositions will be studied for decades to come. Truly, Concerto Piccolo is an amazing debut from a band that offers more than it could possibly receive\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Mathias R\u00fcegg except where noted # \"Concerto Piccolo\" \u2013 15:25 # \"Herzogstrasse 4\" \u2013 11:30 # \"Jelly Roll, But Mingus Rolls Better\" (Charles Mingus/Mathias R\u00fcegg) \u2013 12:45 # \"Variations on \"Am Hermineli Z'liab\" \u2013 12:25 # \"Tango from Obango\" \u2013 12:20 ==Personnel== *Mathias R\u00fcegg \u2212 arranger, conductor *Lauren Newton - voice *Karl Fian \u2212 trumpet *Herbert Joos \u2212 flugelhorn, baritone horn, alphorn, double trumpet *Christian Radovan \u2212 trombone *Billy Fuchs \u2212 tuba *Harry Sokal \u2212 soprano saxophone, tenor saxophone, flute *Wolfgang Puschnig \u2212 alto saxophone, flute, piccolo *Roman Schwaller \u2212 tenor saxophone, clarinet *Uli Scherer \u2212 piano, Fender piano *Stefan Bauer - vibraphone *J\u00fcrgen Wuchner \u2212 bass *Wolfgang Reisinger - percussion *Joris Dudli - drums ==References== Category:1981 live albums Category:Hathut Records live albums Category:Vienna Art Orchestra live albums ",
