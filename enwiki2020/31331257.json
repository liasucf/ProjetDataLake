The laboratory is located in the Misterhult archipelago, near the Oskarshamn Nuclear Power Plant (Oskarshamns K\u00e4rnkraftverk). ==General information== The \u00c4sp\u00f6 Hard Rock Laboratory is a research facility for future geological disposal of spent nuclear fuel. The plant is owned and operated by Svensk Nuclear Fuel Management AB (Svensk K\u00e4rnbr\u00e4nslehantering AB). It was built to test different methods and possibilities for final disposal of spent nuclear fuel. At the laboratory a series of experiments are performed at depths of into the bedrock. The laboratory is used by both Swedish and international experts. Much of the research is done for the construction of the future Spent Fuel Repository. There is no spent nuclear fuel on the site which makes it possible to keep the \u00c4sp\u00f6 laboratory open to the public. There is an exhibition at the site with information and also guided tours via a tunnel down through the bedrock which takes the visitors as far as below ground. ==References== ==External links== * Information at the Svensk K\u00e4rnbr\u00e4nslehantering webpage Category:Oskarshamn Category:Nuclear power in Sweden Category:Radioactive waste repositories Category:Tourist attractions in Kalmar County ",
