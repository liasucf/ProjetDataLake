    "text": "This is a list of the bird species recorded in East Timor. The avifauna of East Timor include a total of 278 species. This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (common and scientific names) follow the conventions of The Clements Checklist of the Birds of the World, 6th edition. The family accounts at the beginning of each heading reflect this taxonomy, as do the species counts found in each family account. Introduced and accidental species are included in the total counts for East Timor. The following tags have been used to highlight several categories, but not all species fall into one of these categories. Those that do not are commonly occurring native species. * (A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in East Timor * (E) Endemic - a species endemic to East Timor * (I) Introduced - a species introduced to East Timor as a consequence, direct or indirect, of human actions ==Grebes== Order: PodicipediformesFamily: Podicipedidae Grebes are small to medium-large freshwater diving birds. They have lobed toes and are excellent swimmers and divers. However, they have their feet placed far back on the body, making them quite ungainly on land. There are two species which have been recorded in East Timor. *Little grebe, Tachybaptus ruficollis *Australasian grebe, Tachybaptus novaehollandiae ==Shearwaters and petrels== Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \"true petrels\", characterized by united nostrils with medium septum and a long outer functional primary. *Cape petrel, Bulweria capense (A) *Bulwer's petrel, Bulweria bulwerii *Streaked shearwater, Calonectris leucomelas *Wedge-tailed shearwater, Ardenna pacificus ==Austral storm petrels== Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Oceanitidae The austral storm petrels are the smallest seabirds, relatives of the petrels, feeding on planktonic crustaceans and small fish picked from the surface, typically while hovering.
