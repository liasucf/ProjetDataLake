These supported memberships are open to psychiatric residents, postgraduate students and junior faculty up to the Assistant Professor or equivalent level with less than five years as faculty in their career trajectory. The programs seek to support 70% of trainees from developing countries. *The Samuel Gershon Awards for Junior Investigators, named in honor of Samuel Gershon, past ISBD President and pioneer of early lithium research, offer four awards for original research submissions. Awards are based on the originality of the content, as well as the significance of the findings reported, and are evaluated by an international scientific panel under the auspices of the ISBD. These awards are open to psychiatric trainees, postgraduate students and junior faculty up to the assistant professor rank from around the world. The awards are presented in conjunction with the society's biennial meeting where the winners present their research in a special session showcasing the work of junior people in the field. *The ISBD Research Fellowship for Junior Investigators provides an opportunity for the recipient to travel to another facility to get training in a particular type of research methodology (i.e. brain imaging, genetics, clinical trials, etc.). The fellowship is intended to cover up to 6 months support for salary, travel, or some combination of these costs as they are incurred in pursuit of additional training. This could take the form of summer programs, participation in smaller prospective studies, or through some other opportunity. == Conferences == The society organizes biennial meetings that provides updates on topics such as epidemiology, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapies, genetics, neurobiology, imaging research, and bipolar disorder in special populations. == References == == External links == * Category:Organizations established in 1999 Category:Mental health organizations in Pennsylvania Category:Bipolar disorder Category:International medical and health organizations Category:1999 establishments in Pennsylvania ",
