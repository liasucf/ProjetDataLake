He was the son of Carl Johan Ferdinand M\u00f8ller (1815\u201373) and Reinholdine Christiane Sch\u00f8nheyder (1835\u20131904). He began his art studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, but stayed for only a year, then switched to the Kunstnernes Frie Studieskoler, where he studied under the supervision of P.S. Kr\u00f8yer.Elisabeth Fabritius . Valdemar Sch\u00f8nheyder M\u00f8ller Kunstindeks Danmark & Weilbach Kunstnerleksikon It was there he became friends with Vilhelm Hammersh\u00f8i (1864 \u20131916) and took photographs that became the basis for some of Hammersh\u00f8i's early paintings. He was, in fact, one of the earliest Danish painters to use photography as an artistic medium. In 1891, he moved to Skagen, where he became acquainted with the Skagen Painters, and remained there until 1893. It was in Skagen that he began his intensive study of the effects of light. In 1894, he went to Paris to join his brother, Tyge, who was an art collector; then settled in Fontainebleau in 1896. He continued his studies of light, producing a series of over thirty works with the sun's direct light as their theme; many depicting the sun as rises, shining through the trees. Sometimes, he would briefly stare at the sun, to recreate the lights and colors induced in his retina. He soon became known as the painter of the sun (Le peintre du Soleil). Although largely forgotten today, he was once a familiar figure at exhibitions, including the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition (1885\u201387, 1889\u201392), the Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale (1895\u20131903) and the Expositions Universelles of 1889 and 1900. Throughout his life, he suffered from bipolar episodes. In 1901, he was admitted to \u00c5rhus Sindssygehospital, the psychiatric hospital in Aarhus and remained there until his death in 1905. == References == == External links == Category:1864 births Category:1905 deaths Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:Danish male painters Category:Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts people Category:People from Aarhus Category:Danish landscape painters Category:People with bipolar disorder ",
