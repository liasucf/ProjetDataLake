    "text": "Dayton's was an American department store chain founded in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1902 by George Draper Dayton. In 1969, the Detroit-based J.L. Hudson Company merged with the Dayton Company to form the Dayton-Hudson Corporation, adding 21 Michigan-based stores to the total. In 1990, the department store division of Dayton\u2013Hudson (now Target Corporation) acquired Chicago-based Marshall Field's. Both Dayton's and Hudson's retained their individual store names until 2001, when they were united under the Marshall Field's nameplate. Prior to changing its name to Marshall Field's, Dayton's stores numbered 19, serving communities throughout the upper Midwest. Dayton's was the parent of Target, opening the first Target in 1962 as the discount store version of Dayton's. Target eventually grew to become the company's dominant division. In 2000, Dayton\u2013Hudson renamed itself Target Corporation. In 2004, Target divested its department store division to focus on discount retailing. May Company purchased the stores prior to May's own acquisition by Federated Department Stores, which rebranded all the Marshall Field's stores as Macy's. Many Minnesotans resisted the name changes and continue to refer to \"Dayton's\" when speaking of the stores in Southdale, Rosedale, Ridgedale and the flagship downtown Minneapolis location, now closed. ==History== The original, flagship Dayton's store in downtown Minneapolis; followed by Macy's until March 2017 The Dayton Company logo as of 1918 ===Goodfellow & Company=== Dayton's has roots in R.S.

George Nelson Dayton's five sons each inherited 20% of the business after the death of their father; all are credited with the management and expansion of Dayton's into the modern retail era, along with the creation of Target Corporation, not only changing the dynamics of retail in Minnesota, but nationwide.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/250758079/?terms=five%20dayton%20brothers&match;=1 August 1952 Dayton's announced the acquisition of Knowlton Company in downtown Rochester, Minnesota.

It took almost two years of expansion and renovations, and the Rochester Dayton's opened March 1954.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/187724459/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20rochester&match;=1 Dayton's pending development of its first shopping center, Southdale Center, is announced in June 1952https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/187592470/?terms=southdale. Southdale was planned, conceived, constructed and owned by the Dayton Company.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/202716228/?terms=dayton%27s Southdale would become the first fully-enclosed, climate-controlled shopping mall in the United States, changing the retail landscape. Dayton's purchased 500 acres in Edina, Minnesota to construct the historic $10 million complex, which opened in 1956 with approximately 50 shops.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/187592470/?terms=southdale 40,000 visitors attended the grand opening of the mall https://www.nytimes.com/1956/10/09/archives/40000-visitors-see-new-stores- weatherconditioned-shoping-center.html and immediately its success exceeded all expectations.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/178784254/?terms=southdale%2B%2B%2Bsuccess Southdale became Dayton's third store; it was the company's second location and first in a series of shopping centers in the Twin Cities. In November 1954, Dayton's announced it had acquired Fantle Bros. Department Store in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. This marked the first purchase and location for a Dayton's owned store outside of Minnesota; however, it kept the Fantle name instead of converting to the Dayton's nameplate.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/187771494/?terms=fantle%27s In 1955, Dayton's announced the acquisition of land in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota for a shopping mall.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/183003725/?terms=dayton%27s%2B%2B%2B%22brooklyn%2Bcenter%22. Prior to the opening of Southdale Center, Dayton's was planning to construct a second shopping center to be called \"Northdale\", but the name was changed to Brookdale. Brookdale wasn't scheduled to be constructed immediately. June 1958: Dayton's announced plans with the Radisson Hotels, adjacent to the downtown store, to construct a joint Parking ramp for customers and guests of both companies and downtown visitors in general. The ramp was constructed to accommodate 750 cars, which didn't make it the largest in town, but was designed for quick and convenient accessibility for patrons to both properties.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188381737/?terms=dayton%27s%2Bparking%2Bramp Also in 1958, Dayton's merged with Schuneman's Department Store in Saint Paul, Minnesota.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/187710152/ Dayton's also announced it had acquired choice retail property in downtown St. Paul to construct a new store in the future. The Dayton's-Schuneman's store continued operations in the Schuneman's building. Schuneman's was thought to have annual sales of $12-$15 million at the time, while Dayton's was thought to be around $80 million. By early 1960, Dayton's owned all property on the block fronted by Wabasha, Cedar, 6th and 7th Streets in St. Paul.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/183501534/?terms=schuneman%27s ===1960s=== In February 1962, after acquiring additional property needed to expand in St. Paul, Dayton's announced the plans for a new five story building and Parking ramp for 650 cars, all located in one structure.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188192158/?terms=schuneman%27s Brookdale Center opened in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota in March 1962.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/183506883/?terms=brookdale Planned before the successful opening of Southdale Center, Brookdale was the second shopping center developed by Dayton's and further expanded its retail footprint into the growing suburbs. Dayton's will construct and open a 195,000 sq. ft. Dayton's store at Brookdale in phase 2 of construction, opening in July 1966.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184611776/?terms=%22donaldson%27s%22%2B%2B%2Bbrookdale The new St. Paul store opened in August 1963 with 380,000 sq. ft. of retail space in five stories, taking up an entire city block. The estimated cost of the new project was $14 million. The old Dayton's-Schuneman building across the street was razed for new development.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184858698/?terms=dayton%27s%2Bwabasha By 1964 Dayton's had become the second-largest privately-owned department store chain in the country, with sales estimated to be at least $130 million annually.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/179000614/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20brookdale%20%2B%20southdale&match;=1 Dayton's announced its third shopping center development in 1966, Rosedale Center.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184611062/?terms=%22donaldson%27s%22%2B%2B%2Bbrookdale The name continued the convention of \"Dale\" with the complex located in Roseville, Minnesota, a suburb of Saint Paul, Minnesota. Rosedale Center opened in August 1969 and became the location of the sixth Dayton's store. This large Dayton's location contained three stories, employed more than 600 people, and had 190,000 sq. ft of retail space.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184645741/?terms=rosedale%2B-cemetery Fantle's Department Store in Sioux Falls, South Dakota was sold by Dayton's, thirteen years after purchasing it in 1967. Fantle's had never converted to the Dayton's name and Dayton's said the reason for the sale was that the company wanted to concentrate on stores in major metropolitan areas.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184841547/?terms=fantle However, Dayton's would return to Sioux Falls with a store bearing its own nameplate eleven years later. In the '60s, Dayton's was one of the first retailers to recognize the buying power of the teen market and it aggressively pursued it with youth-oriented merchandise, concerts, and attractions. From 1962 to 1966 it hosted a weekly teen dance with live music in the 8th floor auditorium, attracting up to 5,000 teens per week. In 1966 it spearheaded a \"Super Youthquake\" movement at area Dayton's stores featuring the latest fashions and music, with artists including Simon & Garfunkel and The Yardbirdshttps://twincitiesmusichighlights.net/venues/daytons/. The Yardbirds' appearance at Dayton's was the first U.S. tour date played by Jimmy Page. Dayton's efforts paid off, and in 1965 it won Seventeen Magazine's award for outstanding youth retail. Dayton's captured and enjoyed a trendsetter reputation, which contributed greatly to its success and standing apart from other area retailers.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184669421/?terms=top%2Bretailers%2Bdayton%27s In August 1967, Dayton's changed its name to \"The Dayton Corporation\", added outside members to its board (increasing the board to 12 persons), and prepared for its first public stock offering.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184868314/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20%22public%20offering%22&match;=1 It was estimated the Dayton family still owned 85% of the corporation's stock after the initial public offering in October of that year,https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188356215/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20%22public%20offering%22&match;=1 and still owned 43% of the stock by 1977.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/186829050/?terms=%22kenneth%20dayton%22%20%2B%20stock&match;=1 The 1960s closed with the merger of The Dayton Corporation and J.L. Hudson (Hudson's) of Detroit, Michigan.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184653383/?terms=dayton%2Bhudson At the time of acquisition, J.L. Hudson was the nation's largest independently owned department store company. Upon realization of the merger, Dayton Hudson Corporation became the 14th largest non-food retailer in the U.S., with combined sales of over $800 million. ====Target Stores==== In an announcement made in July 1961, Dayton's entered a new era of shopping with a discount store chain to operate separately from Dayton's department stores. The new chain would construct stores in the Twin Cities area in the near future, and each store would feature approximately 125,000 sq ft of retail space. This move was the first by a department store chain in the upper midwest to enter the discount retailing field.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/183482683/. Named Targethttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/183481337/, the new stores would become the model for continued success by U.S. retailers, in a class by itself, even as it approached its 60th anniversary.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-11-23/in-a-class-by- itself-how-target-became-the-model-in-u-s-retail Its success so great that, in time, Target Corporation would survive Dayton's, the original parent company. The first Target store opened in May 1962 in Roseville, Minnesota, a suburb of Saint Paul, Minnesotahttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/183503654/?terms=target%2Broseville. Rapidly expanding, by the end of the year there were four Target stores, with locations in Roseville, Crystal, Minnesota, Duluth, Minnesota, and St. Louis Park, Minnesota.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188056584/?terms=target%2Broseville ====B. Dalton==== B. Dalton Booksellers was announced in April 1966 as a new book store chain to be launched and wholly owned by Dayton's.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188295912/ After research, Dayton's believed book stores would be a successful merchandising field for the company, due in part to the increase in education and disposable income of Americans. Named after Bruce Dayton, the head of Dayton's at the time (and one of George Nelson Dayton's five sons),https://www.twincities.com/2015/11/13/bruce-dayton-target-co-founder- and-retail-tycoon-dies-at-97/ Dayton's intent from the beginning was for B. Dalton to be a national book store chain, with locations across the U.S. In 1966 the average book store chain's retail footprint per store was approximately 2,500\u20132,900 sq ft; B. Dalton's first store was to be 7,200 sq ft. In August 1966 the first B. Dalton Bookseller, in the Dayton-owned Southdale Center in suburban Edina, opened.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184563193/?terms=b%2Bdalton Expansion developed quickly, with the next store in the chain opening in February 1967 in St. Louis, Missouri; amid another six stores planned at that time.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188110697/?terms=%22b%20dalton%22&match;=1 ==Dayton Hudson Corporation years== ===1970s=== 1970 saw the bombing of the women's restroom at the Saint Paul, Minnesota storehttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184889492/.

Dayton's moved its Rochester, Minnesota store from downtown to Rochester's new Apache Mall in 1972. The mall had been open for a short time when Dayton's decided to leave the downtown area and construct a new 150,000 sq. ft. store at the mall. At that time, Apache Mall was the third-largest shopping center in Minnesota and the largest outside of the Twin Cities area.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/185701849/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20%22apache%20mall%22&match;=1https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/184887785 Dayton's move was considered a tipping point in the movement of retail commerce away from downtown Rochester.

In 1977 Dayton's announced the construction of a new Sioux Falls store, which would become the first with the Dayton's nameplate in South Dakota.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/186859291/?terms=%22dayton%27s%22%20%2B%20%22empire%20mall%22&match;=1 The Sioux Falls market was chosen for a Dayton's location based on the familiarity of the Dayton's name with area residents, and by the fact that 1,500 Dayton's credit card account holders resided in the area even though the closest Dayton's was about 250 miles away.https://www.newspapers.com/image/229624050/?terms=dayton%27s The new Dayton's location contained approximately 100,000 sq ft of retail space and $3 million in inventory when it opened at the Empire Mall in July 1978. It was also a unique store for Dayton's in the fact that it did not have the larger furniture, drapery, and carpet departments like its Minnesota counterparts and was considered Dayton's most forward store in design and decor at the time of its opening.https://www.newspapers.com/image/229647202/?terms=dayton%27s In 1978, Bob Dayton, son of former Dayton's president Donald Dayton, walked away from his executive position to purchase a competing retailer, Harold, located just down the street on Nicollet Mall from Dayton's flagship store in Minneapolis, Minnesota.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/186792809 Harold was a high end women's retailer in Minneapolis and had been experiencing declining sales in recent years due, in part, to previous absentee ownership. Bob Dayton had grown bored at Dayton's and was excited by the opportunity to purchase Harold, and go head to head against the business his great grandfather founded. Besides owning Harold, he also developed The Conservatory, a retail shopping center on Nicollet Mall directly across the street from Dayton's and which was ultimately deemed a failure and demolished.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/250743331 Harold went out of business in 1990.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/192292317/?terms=harold%2Bconservatory%2Bjune%2B29 Dayton's continued to expand and announced its fifth shopping center, and first Wisconsin Dayton's store, in 1978.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/192496970/?terms=dayton%27s%2B%22valley%2Bview%2Bmall%22 This would be its first shopping center to be built outside Minnesota and would be located in La Crosse, Wisconsin.

This was unusual in that the Dayton's Home Store was no longer located within the same mall as the Dayton's store. ===1980s=== Kenneth Dayton, the last of the five Dayton brothers still affiliated with Dayton's, responsible for leading and guiding the company through the modern era, announced his retirement in June 1983.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/188292987/?terms=%22kenneth%20dayton%22&match;=1 His retirement resulted for the first time in the company's history that a Dayton family member would no longer be employed by Dayton's.

In 1985 it introduced Santabear, a toy bear so hugely popular that it generated $300 million in sales within nine years. Its success inspired other retailers such as Macy's, Walmart, and Dayton's sibling Target Corporation to introduce their own holiday plush animals to bring customers into their stores during the holidays. In July 1988, Dayton's announced future expansion by building larger stores for its Southdale and Rosedale locationshttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/191121250/?terms=, the first Dayton's construction since the opening of the Bismarck store in 1985. This expansion was seen as a response to the planned Mall of America to be constructed in nearby Bloomington, Minnesota. The new Dayton's stores were to be constructed next to the existing stores, which would be renovated to accommodate 50 new retailers at Southdale and 30 new retailers at Rosedale. ===1990s=== April 1990: Marshall Field's is acquired from Batus Inc. by the Department Store Division of the Dayton\u2013Hudson Corporation in a $1.04 billion deal.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/192329290/?terms=marshall%20field%27s&match;=1 The new ownership planned to retain the Marshall Field's name, as it was well- known and well-respected. Dayton's again expanded into Wisconsin, and opened a new store in August 1991 in Eau Claire, Wisconsin at Oakwood Mall.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/192358901/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20%22eau%20claire%22&match;=1 After previously announcing its intentions in 1988https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/191111955/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20%22fox%20river%22&match;=1, Dayton-Hudson also opened a new Dayton's in the summer of 1991 in Appleton, Wisconsin at Fox River Mall, after closing a nearby Marshall Field's locationhttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/180294342/?terms=dayton%27s%20%2B%20appleton&match;=1. With the opening of the nearby Mall of America in 1992, it is believed Dayton's struck a deal with Equitable Real Estate Investment Management Inc, the owners of both Southdale Center and Rosedale Center. In exchange for Dayton's agreement to stay put at both malls and not defect to the Mall of America, Equitable gave Dayton's $40 million to construct two larger stores at both Southdale and Rosedale; and Dayton's gave Equitable its two old stores, which were renovated into coveted mall spacehttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/193223110/. Dayton's new location opened at Southdale Center in Edina, Minnesota in August 1990. The new location was 370,000 sq. ft., four stories, and featured many modern amenities,https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/191871435/?terms=southdale&match;=1 replacing the older, smaller original Dayton's location. The new 260,000 sq. ft. Rosedale counterpart opened in the summer of 1991.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/192345918/?terms=dayton%27s%20rosedale&match;=1 For the first time since 1978, when the Edina, Minnesota Home Store openedhttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/193271194/?terms=dayton%27s%20maplewood&match;=1, Dayton's opened a new store in the Twin Cities. The new location opened at Maplewood Mall in the Saint Paul, Minnesota suburb of Maplewood, Minnesota in October 1996https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/194048533/?terms=dayton%27s%20maplewood&match;=1. The store was located in the former Carson's space, one of the eight area Carson's spaces purchased by Dayton's in a $74 million cash deal in 1995 following the closure of the Twin Cities Carson's locations.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/193082586/https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/193294832/?terms=dayton%27s%20maplewood&match;=1 Another remodeled former Carson's property at Ridgedale Center was opened as a Dayton's location. This Carson's property became Dayton's second location at Ridgedale, housing the men's and home storeshttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/192935399/?terms=dayton%27s%20ridgedale%20expansion&match;=1. Dayton's had been cramped at Ridgedale for years, so it was seen as advantageous to expand into two locations at the same mall; also, it was seen as a strategic move to keep Nordstrom out, as that company appeared to be interested in Ridgedale Center.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/193084062/. Nordstrom eventually opened at the mall. ==Target Corporation== Dayton\u2013Hudson Corporation announced in January 2000 a name change to Target Corporation.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/195594719/?terms= Acknowledging that Target stores made up 80% of its revenue and that the Target name was better known nationally, Dayton-Hudson believed Target was the name, and direction, of the corporation's future. It was considered unusual for a corporation to take on the name of one of its brands, however; Target had been Dayton-Hudson's top revenue producer for 23 years, and the corporate name change was met with enthusiasm by investors. ==Name change== In January 2001, much to the dismay of shoppers in Minneapolis-Saint Paul and Detroit, Dayton's and Hudson's were rebranded with the Marshall Field's nameplate, which has a higher national profile.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/195672430/?terms= This change was viewed as a strategic move and deemed necessary in the internet age to create a unified presence. Dayton's popular sales events - Daisy Sale in Summer and Jubilee Sale in Fall, were converted to \"Field Days\" sales after 2001https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dayton%27s&action;=edit&section;=13. The first sign of the name change came via the discontinuation of the Dayton's website in favor of the Marshall Field's site in May 2001https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/196071839. The demise of the Dayton's name in favor of the Marshall Field's nameplate occurred later in 2001 and affected the existing Dayton's stores, including eight in the Twin Cities, one in St. Cloud, Minnesota, one in Rochester, Minnesota, three in North Dakota, one in South Dakota, and three in Wisconsin. https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/195672624/ ==Sale and final name change== After rumors dating back to 1995 that May Department Stores was interested in Dayton'shttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/193269326/, in 2004 Target Corporation announced the sale of the Marshall Field's department store group, including the 62 stores serving communities in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Wisconsin, to May Department Stores. Target sold off its Mervyn's stores in a $1.65 billion deal to a private investment fund in 2004https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/250149797/?terms=mervyn%27s&match;=1. (Mervyn's went bankrupt in 2008). In February 2005, May Department Stores merged with Federated Department Stores, owner of Macy's, in an $11 billion deal.https://money.cnn.com/2005/02/28/news/fortune500/federated_may/index.htm Later that year, in September, it was announced that Marshall Field's stores will take the Macy's name, ending the run of Marshall Field's \u2013 and the then- still freshly renamed Dayton's and Hudson's \u2013 as unique, upscale Midwestern department store brands.https://startribune.newspapers.com/image/250324748/?terms= 2017 signaled the end of an era as Macy's announced that the Dayton's downtown Minneapolis flagship store, re-branded as Marshall Field's in 2001, and Macy's in 2006, would closehttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/257810221/. Its final day of business was Sunday, March 19, 2017; closing the book on more than one century of retail at that location. The building was purchased for $40 million by 601W Cos., an investment firm with a history of remodeling and reselling refurbished skyscrapershttps://startribune.newspapers.com/image/257810494. In an innovative redevelopment of the property, with a nod to the past, it has been converted into \"The Dayton's Project\", a mixed use retail, office space, and entertainment complex with some of the original Dayton's elements restored, while being redesigned for the 21st centuryhttps://www.thedaytonsproject.com/#the-new-scene-a. ==Dayton's Store Locations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ Dayton\u2019s Store Locations |- !
