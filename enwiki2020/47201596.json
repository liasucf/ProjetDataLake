The club's greatest success has been promotion to the tier five Bayernliga in 2015. ==History== Formed in 1963, SV Erlbach played, for the most part of its history as a lower amateur side. The club won promotion of the Bezirksliga Oberbayern-Ost in 2004 and played at this level for two seasons before achieving another promotion, now to the tier six Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern. Der erfolgreichste Spieler war Bernhard Waldher. Erlbach played the next five seasons at this level, with two sixth places as its best results but was relegated again in 2011. Erlbach returned to the Bezirksliga for the next two seasons, finishing runners-up in 2012 and winning the league the season after. The latter earned it promotion to the Landesliga for the first time.Bezirksliga Oberbayern-Ost tables Manfreds Fussball Archiv, accessed: 12 July 2015Bezirksoberliga Oberbayern tables Manfreds Fussball Archiv, accessed: 12 July 2015 Erlbach played in the tier six Landesliga Bayern-S\u00fcdost for the next two seasons, coming third in its first year there.
