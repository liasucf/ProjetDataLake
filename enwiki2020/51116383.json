He competed for Saint Ignatius High School, graduating in 2001, and collegiately for the Tennessee Volunteers. ==High school== In the spring of 2000 as a junior at Saint Ignatius, Sylvester suffered a partially collapsed lung at the regional meet which forced him to miss that season's state championships. Sylvester was able to recover from the injury in time to compete in the high school national championships a mere three weeks later, placing third in the 800 meters with a time of 1:49.69. On July 11 of that year, Sylvester had the unique distinction of being honored by U.S. Representative Dennis Kucinich on Capitol Hill. In his remarks Rep. Kucinich stated, \"I am inspired by his motivation, poise, and good sportsmanship on and off the playing field. Marc is the quintessential model of grace under pressure. I am impressed by such optimism and devotion. He is truly remarkable.\" During his senior season he set the OHSAA Boy's Division I record in the 800 meters, running a 1:48.93 in the state championships at Dayton's Welcome Stadium. ==College career== At the University of Tennessee, Sylvester was twice named an NCAA Division I Outdoor Track & Field All-American in the 800 meters \u2013 chosen for the 2002 and 2004 seasons.http://www.ustfccca.org/assets/awards/div1/allamericans/d1_allamOT_2002.pdfhttp://www.ustfccca.org/assets/awards/div1/allamericans/d1_allamOT_2004.pdf He ran a personal best time of 1:46.21 in the 800 meters at the 2002 NCAA Division I Outdoor Championships, placing sixth.
