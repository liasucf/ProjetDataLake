As of September 11, 2020, he has over 7.1 million monthly listeners on Spotify. == Influences == Y2K was introduced to music at an early age, his mother owned a music store in Arizona, which he has said was where his interest in music began. From there he began listening to Gorillaz, and Tears for Fears, which he has mentioned were his earliest influences in music. As he got older, he began listening to bands such as My Chemical Romance, and Say Anything. According to Y2K, his introduction to music production was from California rapper, Lil B, who introduced him to Clams Casino. Following this, Y2K began to work on music, making remixes exclusively for a few years before making the decision to start producing for others, such as bbno$, Yung Gravy and lil aaron. == Discography == === Singles === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align: center\" ! rowspan=\"2\" scope=\"col\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Certifications ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font- size:90%;\"| US ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| US R&B; ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| US Rap ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| CAN ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| FRA ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| IRL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| NZ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| SWE ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:2.5em;font-size:90%;\"| UK |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Money Conversation\" (with bbno$) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Thankful\" (with bbno$ and Lewis Grant) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | | Recess |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Pouch\" (with bbno$) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | | rowspan=\"5\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Lalala\" (with bbno$) | 55 || 22 || 19 || 16 || 10 || 76 || 37 || 16 || 68 || 32 | *RIAA: Gold *ARIA: Platinum * RMNZ: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\" | \"Go Dumb\" (with The Kid Laroi featuring Blackbear and Bankrol Hayden) | rowspan=\"3\"| 2020 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Oh No\" (with Killy) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Damage Is Done\" (with JoJo) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | |- | colspan=\"14\" |\"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released. |} ===Produced by Y2K=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
