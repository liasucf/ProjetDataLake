The player takes the role of an assassin and uses attacks, dodges and stealth to pursue targets. The game is presented in a minimalist, low-poly, isometric perspective. == Gameplay == The gameplay experience of Tokyo 42 can be likened to that of a shoot 'em up game; The player must be aware of their surroundings as it is likely that enemy bullets will be coming in from multiple directions. The player has a variety of weapons at their arsenal, from sniper rifles to grenades and even melee weapons such as Katanas. The camera angle can be rotated clockwise or counter clockwise by pressing \"E\" and \"Q\"' respectively. == Story == The main premise of the story is that the player plays as an inhabitant of an ultra futuristic version of the Japanese city Tokyo who is framed for murder. The player escapes a police chase in the tutorial and is now officially a wanted criminal on the run. The player's friend tells the player of a good way to exact revenge on the assassin that framed you, which is to become an assassin yourself and rise the ranks to eventually be able to take them down. == Soundtrack == The release of the game was accompanied by an official two part soundtrack by Beat Vince. The feature track \"Go Go Go (feat. Genevieve Artadi)\" was very well received in the indie music community. == Reception == Tokyo 42 received \"mixed and average\" reviews from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic. == References == == Further reading == * https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/03/30/tokyo-42-announcement/ * http://www.polygon.com/2016/3/30/11332606/tokyo-42-announce-trailer * http://www.polygon.com/2016/9/5/12802898/tokyo-42-xbox-one-pc-playstation-4 * https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/06/09/tokyo-42-alpha/ * http://www.pcgamer.com/toyko-42-has-the-prettiest-criminal-underworld/ * https://www.destructoid.com/i-can-t-get-enough-of- tokyo-42-s-cityscape-366816.phtml * == External links == * Category:2017 video games Category:Action video games Category:Indie video games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Open world video games Category:Stealth video games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom Category:Video games with isometric graphics Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games ",
