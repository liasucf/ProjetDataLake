    "text": "This is a list of the Mayors and Lord Mayors of City of Parramatta Council and its predecessors, a local government area of New South Wales, Australia. The official title of Lord Mayors while holding office is: The Right Worshipful Lord Mayor of Parramatta. ==Development of the office== First incorporated in January 1861 as the \"Municipality of Parramatta\", the council became known as the \"Borough of Parramatta\" on 23 December 1867 following the enactment of the Municipalities Act, 1867, and became a Municipality again following the 1906 Local Government Act. On 27 October 1938, the Local Government (City of Parramatta) Act was passed by the Parliament of New South Wales and proclaimed by the Governor, Lord Wakehurst, making the town the \"City of Parramatta\". From 1 January 1949 the \"City of Parramatta\" was re-formed following the passing of the Local Government (Areas) Act 1948, when the councils of Ermington and Rydalmere (incorporated 1891), Dundas (incorporated 1889) and Granville (incorporated 1885) were merged into the council area. The Department of Local Government refused requests from Parramatta in 1948 and 1949 to be granted the title of \"Lord Mayor\". In recognition of the town of Parramatta's bicentennial (coinciding with Australia's Bicentenary), the title of \"Lord Mayor\" was granted on 12 December 1988 by Queen Elizabeth II on the recommendation of Premier Nick Greiner. This made Parramatta the third Australian city that was not a capital to receive such an honour, after Newcastle and Wollongong. A 2015 review of local government boundaries by the NSW Government Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal recommended that the City of Parramatta be reformed, adding areas from several adjoining councils. The NSW Government subsequently proposed a merger of parts of Parramatta (Woodville Ward), Auburn and Holroyd and a second merger of parts of the rest of Parramatta and parts of Auburn, The Hills, Hornsby, and Holroyd to form a new council. On 12 May 2016, Parramatta City Council was abolished by the NSW Government. Parts of Auburn City Council (south of the M4 Western Motorway) and Parramatta City Council (Woodville Ward), and Holroyd City Council merged to form the Cumberland Council as a new local government area and the remainder of the Parramatta City Council, Auburn City Council north of the M4 Western Motorway (including parts of the Sydney Olympic Park), and small parts of Hornsby Shire, Holroyd and The Hills Shire were merged into the reformed \"City of Parramatta Council\". The current Lord Mayor is Bob Dwyer (Liberal Party), who was elected on 23 September 2019, succeeding Andrew Wilson (Independent), in office since 26 September 2017.Parramatta Town Hall, designed by George Allen Mansfield, has been the seat of the council since 1883. Granville Town Hall was the seat of Granville Municipal Council from 1888 to 1948 and the City of Parramatta from 1949 to 1958. It is now a heritage-listed community centre and library located in Cumberland Council area. ==List of incumbents== ===Mayors of the Municipality/Borough/Municipality/City of Parramatta, 1861\u20131948=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Mayor !Term !Notes |- | John Williams | 2 January 1862 \u2013 3 February 1862 | |- | James Byrnes | 3 February 1862 \u2013 17 February 1866 | |- | James Pye | 17 February 1866 \u2013 18 February 1867 | |- | Richard Harper | 18 February 1867 \u2013 14 February 1868 | |- | Thomas Wheaton Bowden | 14 February 1868 \u2013 8 February 1869 | |- | John Good | 8 February 1869 \u2013 11 February 1870 | |- | Charles Byrnes | 11 February 1870 \u2013 14 February 1871 | |- | Hugh Taylor | 14 February 1871 \u2013 13 February 1874 | |- | Samuel Burge | 13 February 1874 \u2013 10 February 1875 | |- | Charles Byrnes | 10 February 1875 \u2013 14 February 1882 | |- | Joseph Booth | 14 February 1882 \u2013 13 February 1884 | |- | Frederick Charles Cox | 13 February 1884 \u2013 10 February 1885 | |- | Joseph Smith | 10 February 1885 \u2013 8 February 1886 | |- | Charles Byrnes | 8 February 1886 \u2013 13 February 1889 | |- | Frank BeamesFirst Mayor of Leichhardt, 1872\u20131875. | 13 February 1889 \u2013 11 February 1890 | |- | William Ferris | 11 February 1890 \u2013 12 February 1891 | |- | Frank Beames | 12 February 1891 \u2013 8 February 1892 | |- | Charles Byrnes | 8 February 1892 \u2013 20 February 1894 | |- | Joseph W.
