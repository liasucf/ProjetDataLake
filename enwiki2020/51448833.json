As with many Malay roads in Singapore, it still retains the older spelling. ==History== The road was built during the era of industrialization in the 60s. A part of the road was originally named \"Jalan Kimia\" (\"Kimia\" meaning \"chemistry\" in Malay), it was renamed to \"Jalan Buroh\" in 1972. The name was chosen to reflect the industrial nature of the area. Other roads in the area also bare Malay names, including \"Jalan Pabrik\" (Jurong Port Road), \"Jalan Gudang\" (Jurong Pier Road), \"Jalan Gerabak\" (Tractor Road)http://hm.onemap.sg/1966/1966%20(108).jpg of which many have been renamed to English by JTC Corporation.
