    "text": "A Sch\u00fctzenverein (German for \"marksmen's club\") is in a local voluntary association found in German-speaking countries revolving around shooting as a sport, often target shooting to Olympic rules or with historic weapons. Although originating as a town militia, a Sch\u00fctzenverein has no military aspects and in many cases often has a more social than sporting purpose. ==Origins== These associations originated in late medieval autonomous towns as a form of citizens' militia principally to defend the town. ==Germany== Germany has over 15,000 Sch\u00fctzenvereine, with most of them affiliated to the \"Deutscher Sch\u00fctzenbund\" (German Marksmen's Federation, DSB) umbrella organization. The DSB was founded in 1861 in Gotha and revived in 1951 in Frankfurt am Main following World War II. The DSB's 1,500,000 members makes it the third largest sports organisation in Germany. Other organisations for sport shooting in Germany include the Bund Deutscher Sportsch\u00fctzen, \"Bund der Milit\u00e4r- und Polizeisch\u00fctzen\" and the \"Deutsche Schie\u00dfsport Union\".BVA: Anerkennung von Schie\u00dfsportverb\u00e4nden, Genehmigung von Schie\u00dfsportordnungen These focus more on the sport and offer a wider variety of shooting styles and competition types than the DSB, particularly in the field of large-bore firearms. Each Sch\u00fctzenverein organizes shooting events, including at the very least an annual Sch\u00fctzenfest. Weapons used may include air rifles, air pistols, small bore weapons and crossbows. ==United States== Schuetzenvereins were founded in the United States by German-Americans and acted as a social club for their communities. Each club had a range for target shooting and often also a bar.Schuetzenpark Larger clubs could have extensive facilities such as an inn, dance hall, music pavilion, zoo, bowling alley, roller coaster, refreshment stands, athletic field, picnic grounds, and other amusements. It was common for tens of thousands of people to attend a major event. The popularity of these facilities began to decline in America around 1917, when the anti-German sentiment from World War I restricted the activities of German-Americans and led to the prohibition of the use of the German language in public. Many businesses and organizations changed their German names or dissolved. The American Sch\u00fctzenvereine were dealt another serious blow in 1919 when the \"Prohibition Act\" outlawed the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, the consumption of which was casually mixed with shooting activities. Schuetzen Park in North Bergen, New Jersey and Schuetzen Park in Davenport, Iowa recall the tradition. The former Deutsch-Amerikanische Sch\u00fctzen Gesellschaft building stands at 12 St. Mark's Place in New York City's East Village, and has been a designated landmark since 2001. ==Australia== German Australians settlers in Australia also formed Schuetzenvereins notably in South Australia where Australian German associations run the Sch\u00fctzenfest in Adelaide. ==Sources== ==External links== * Deutscher Sch\u00fctzenbund (German head organisation) * \u00d6sterreichischer Sch\u00fctzenbund (Austrian head organisation) * Schweizer Schie\u00dfsportverband (Swiss head organisation) * Deutsch-Amerikanischer Sch\u00fctzenverein (United States) * National Rifle Association of the United Kingdom (Great Britain) * Koninklijke Nederlandse Schutters Associatie (The Netherlands) * K\u00f6niglischer Sch\u00fctzenbund Malmedy - Sankt Vith (East Cantons - Belgium) * ESC - European Shooting Confederation * ISSF International Shooting Sport Federation Category:Cultural organisations based in Germany Category:Shooting sports organizations ",
