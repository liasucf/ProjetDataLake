    "text": "No Exit (, ) is a 1944 existentialist French play by Jean-Paul Sartre. The original title is the French equivalent of the legal term in camera, referring to a private discussion behind closed doors. The play was first performed at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Vieux-Colombier in May 1944.Wallace Fowlie, Dionysus in Paris (New York: Meridian Books, inc., 1960), page 173. The play begins with three characters who find themselves waiting in a mysterious room. It is a depiction of the afterlife in which three deceased characters are punished by being locked into a room together for eternity. It is the source of Sartre's especially famous quotation \"L'enfer, c'est les autres\" or \"Hell is other people\", a reference to Sartre's ideas about the look and the perpetual ontological struggle of being caused to see oneself as an object from the view of another consciousness. ==Title translations== English translations have also been performed under the titles In Camera, No Way Out, Vicious Circle, Behind Closed Doors, and Dead End. ==Plot== Three damned souls, Joseph Garcin, In\u00e8z Serrano, and Estelle Rigault, are brought to the same room in Hell and locked inside by a mysterious valet. They had all expected torture devices to punish them for eternity, but instead, find a plain room furnished in the style of the French 'Second Empire'. At first, none of them will admit the reason for their damnation: Garcin says that he was executed for being an outspoken pacifist, while Estelle insists that a mistake has been made; In\u00e8z, however, is the only one to demand that they all stop lying to themselves and confess to their moral crimes. She refuses to believe that they have all ended up in the room by accident and soon realizes that they have been placed together to make each other miserable. She deduces that they are to be one another's torturers. Garcin suggests that they try to leave each other alone and to be silent, but In\u00e8z starts to sing about execution and Estelle vainly wants to find a mirror to check on her appearance. In\u00e8z tries to seduce Estelle by offering to be her \"mirror\" by telling her everything she sees but ends up frightening her instead. It is soon clear that In\u00e8z is attracted to Estelle, Estelle is attracted to Garcin, and Garcin is not attracted to either of the two women. After arguing, they decide to confess to their crimes so they know what to expect from each other. Garcin cheated on and mistreated his wife, and was executed by firing squad for desertion; In\u00e8z is a manipulative sadist who seduced her cousin's wife, Florence, while living with them\u2014which drove the cousin to kill himself, and resulted in Florence asphyxiating herself and In\u00e8z by flooding the room with gas while they slept, out of guilt\u2014and Estelle had an affair and then killed the resulting child, prompting the child's father to commit suicide. Despite their revelations, they continue to get on each other's nerves. Garcin finally begins giving in to the lascivious Estelle's escalating attempts to seduce him, which drives In\u00e8z crazy. Garcin is constantly interrupted by his own guilt, however, and begs Estelle to tell him he is not a coward for attempting to flee his country during wartime. While she complies, In\u00e8z mockingly tells him that Estelle is just feigning attraction to him so that she can be with a man\u2014any man. This causes Garcin to abruptly attempt an escape. After his trying to open the door repeatedly, it inexplicably and suddenly opens, but he is unable to bring himself to leave, and the others remain as well. He says that he will not be saved until he can convince In\u00e8z that he is not cowardly. She refuses, saying that he is obviously a coward, and promising to make him miserable forever. Garcin concludes that rather than torture devices or physical punishment, \"hell is other people.\" Estelle tries to persevere in her seduction of Garcin, but he says that he cannot make love while In\u00e8z is watching. Estelle, infuriated, picks up a paper knife and repeatedly stabs In\u00e8z. In\u00e8z chides Estelle, saying that they are all already dead, and even furiously stabs herself to prove that point. As Estelle begins to laugh hysterically at the idea of them being dead and trapped together forever, the others join in a prolonged fit of laughter before Garcin finally concludes, \"Eh bien, continuons...\" (\"Well then, let's get on with it...\"). ==Characters== Joseph Garcin \u2013 His cowardice and callousness caused his young wife to die \"of grief\" after his execution. He is from France and died after deserting during the invasion of France in World War II. He was unfaithful to his wife \u2013 he even recalls, without any sympathy, bringing home another woman one night, and his wife bringing them their morning coffee after hearing their engagement all night. Initially, he hates In\u00e8z because she understands his weakness, and wants Estelle because he feels that if she treats him as a man he will become manly. However, by the end of the play he understands that because In\u00e8z understands the meaning of cowardice and wickedness, only absolution at her hands can redeem him (if indeed redemption is possible). In a later translation and adaptation of the play by American translator Paul Bowles, Garcin is renamed Vincent Cradeau. In\u00e8z Serrano \u2013 In\u00e8z is the second character to enter the room. A lesbian postal clerk, she turned a wife against her husband, twisting the wife's perception of her spouse and the subsequent murder of the man (who is In\u00e8z' cousin). Indeed, In\u00e8z seems to be the only character who understands the power of opinion, manipulating Estelle's and Garcin's opinions of themselves and of each other throughout the play. She is honest about the evil deeds she, Garcin, and Estelle have done. She frankly acknowledges the fact that she is a cruel person. Estelle Rigault \u2013 Estelle is a high-society woman, who married an older man for his money and had an affair with a younger man. To her, the affair is merely an insignificant fling, but her lover becomes emotionally attached to her and she bears him a child. She drowns the child by throwing it off the balcony of a hotel into the sea, which drives her lover to commit suicide. Throughout the play she tries to get at Garcin, seeking to define herself as a woman in relation to a man. Her sins are deceit and murder (which also motivated a suicide). She lusts over \"manly men\", which Garcin himself strives to be. Valet \u2013 The Valet enters the room with each character, but his only real dialogue is with Garcin. We learn little about him, except that his uncle is the head valet, and that he does not have any eyelids, which links to Garcin because Garcin's eyelids are atrophied. ==Critical reception== The play was widely praised when it was first performed. Upon its 1946 American premiere at the Biltmore Theatre, critic Stark Young described the play as \"a phenomenon of the modern theatre \u2013 played all over the continent already\", in The New Republic, and wrote that \"It should be seen whether you like it or not.\"Young, Stark. (9 December 1946). \"Weaknesses\". The New Republic, pp. 764. ==Adaptations== ===Audio=== * In 1946, the BBC broadcast a production with Alec Guinness as Garcin, Donald Pleasence as the Valet, Betty Ann Davies as Estelle and Beatrix Lehmann as In\u00e8z, all of whom starred in the first London stage production (see below).
