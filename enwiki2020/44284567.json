    "text": "Jamaat-ul-Ahrar (\"Assembly of the Free,\" abbreviated as JuA) is a terrorist organization that split away from Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in August 2014. The group came to prominence after it claimed responsibility for the 2014 Wagah border suicide attack. In October 2017, there were unconfirmed reports that Omar Khalid, the leader of the JuA, had died from injuries sustained in a US drone strike in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. ==History== ===Roots and development=== In September 2014, Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan chief Fazlullah ousted Mohmand Agency chief Omar Khalid Khorasani (former leader of Ahrar-ul- Hind). Omar Khalid Khorasani and his associates in Mohmand Agency had accused the TTP leadership of deviating from the TTP ideology, leading to the formation of splinter group TTP Jamaat-ul-Ahrar. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan was effectively divided into two factions. The original TTP is headed by Fazlullah, who was elected in November 2013 following the killing of ex-chief Hakimullah Mehsud in a U.S. drone strike. In February 2014, Ahrar-ul-Hind, headed by Umar Qasmi (former leader in the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi) was formed after TTP opened peace talks with the Pakistani government. It later merged into Jamaat-ul-Ahrar, a second splinter group that broke away from Tehreek-i- Taliban in Pakistan on 4 September 2014, and named Omar Khalid Khorasani as its commander. ===Relations with TTP=== The group had announced they would no longer recognize or obey Mullah Fazlullah as their Emir. In March 2015, the group's spokesman announced that it swore loyalty to main TTP leadership again. ==Designation as Terrorist organization by United Nations== On 6 July 2017, the Security Council\u2019s 1267 Sanctions Committee approved the addition of Jamaat-ul-Ahrar in the list of entities and individuals subject to the assets freeze, travel ban and arms embargo. Pakistan had proposed this listing. ==Organizational structure== ===Leaders=== * Omar Khalid Khorasani (aka Abdul Wali)- previously led a faction called Ahrar-ul-Hind. He is also one of the founding members of the TTP and is a former journalist from Mohmand agency. It was reported that a JuA spokesman Asad Mansoor had told AFP news agency that Khorasani on 18 October 2017 had succumbed to his injuries received in a United States drone strike in Paktia Province of Afghanistan. Pajhwok Afghan News however stated that a source close to the group had denied his death. Long War Journal reported that a statement on Telegram issued under Khorasani's name denied his death, while confirming the death of Khalifa Umar Mansour. The outlet noted that the spokesman operating the group\u2019s Telegram account did not announce his death. His death also was not confirmed by United States. Reports of Khorasani's death were proven false when the United States added Khorasani to the U.S State Department's Rewards for Justice wanted list on March 7, 2018.https://rewardsforjustice.net/english/abdul_wali.html ===Spokesmen=== * Asad Mansoor Former * Ehsanullah Ehsan, he surrendered himself to Pakistan's Security Forces in April 2017 http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/04/pakistani-taliban-leader-ehsanullah- ehsan-surrenders-170417131146226.html and escaped from his detention in February 2020. ==Operation Khyber-1== On 9 November, at least 13 militants were killed in security forces' offensive in Akakhel which included among the dead two suicide bombers and a key commander.

Khan had previously served as an important commander and spokesman of JuA. The statement said that Khan left JuA because of differences with its chief over \"attacks against minority Christians, killing civilians, extortion, kidnapping for ransom and other acts he deemed un-Islamic\". Since then, Hizbul Ahrar has claimed numerous attacks against police officers and army men, the modus operandi of the group is mainly targeted assassinations and IED blasts. ==See also== * Ehsanullah Ehsan * Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan * Fazlullah * Operation Black Thunderstorm * Operation Zarb-e-Azb * War in North-West Pakistan ==References== Category:Taliban Category:Jihadist groups in Pakistan Category:2014 establishments in Pakistan ",
