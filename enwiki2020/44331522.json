The night raids continued into the following Spring, during which period the city and its docks along the Mersey became the most heavily bombed area of Britain outside London. The campaign became known as the Liverpool Blitz, with particularly heavy attacks at Christmas 1940 (the Christmas Blitz), in April 1941, and again in May (the May Blitz).Routledge, pp. 394\u20135. ====Order of Battle 1940\u201341==== By the end of the Blitz the brigade had the following units under command:Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 12 May 1941, with amendments, The National Archives (TNA), Kew, file WO 212/79. * 1st HAA Rgt \u2013 Regular Army mobile regiment, transferred from 1st AA Bde at Crewe; part of War Office ReserveOrder of Battle of the Field Force in the United Kingdom, Part 3: Royal Artillery (Non- Divisional Units), 25 March 1941, TNA file WO 212/5. ** 1, 2, 17 HAA Btys ** 1 HAA Rgt Signals Section, Royal Corps of Signals (RCS) ** 1 HAA Rgt Section, RASC ** 1 HAA Rgt Workshop, Royal Army Ordnance Corps * 93rd HAA Rgt ** 267, 288, 289, 290 HAA Btys * 103rd HAA Rgt ** 322, 323, 324 HAA Btys ** 420 Bty (joined between 27 June and 11 July 1941) * 107th HAA Rgt \u2013 new unit formed September 1940, partly from 103rd HAA Rgt ** 334, 335, 337, 390 HAA Btys * 33rd LAA Rgt ** 67, 68, 132 LAA Btys * 4th AA 'Z' Rgt \u2013 new unit equipped with Z Battery rocket projectors, formed in 4 AA Division September 1940 ** 104, 108, 122, 132, 139 Z Btys ===Mid-War=== 4 AA Division formation sign.

Newly-formed units joining AA Command were increasingly 'mixed' ones into which women of the Auxiliary Territorial Service were integrated. Some of these were armed with Z Battery rocket projectiles that were partly manned by members of the Home Guard. At the same time, experienced units were posted away for service overseas. This continual turnover of units accelerated in 1942 with the preparations for Operation Torch and the need to relocate guns to counter the Baedeker Blitz and the Luftwaffe 's hit-and-run attacks against South Coast towns.Routledge, pp. 399\u2013404. ====Order of Battle 1941\u201342==== During this period the division was composed as follows (temporary detachments omitted):Farndale, Annex M.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 2 December 1941, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/80.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 14 May 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/81. * 1st HAA Rgt \u2013 as above; to Northern Ireland July 1941 * 93rd HAA Rgt \u2013 as above; to 44 AA Bde June 1942 ** 267, 288, 289, 290 HAA Btys ** 416 HAA Bty \u2013 joined May 1942 * 95th HAA Rgt \u2013 joined September 1942; left for India October 1942Joslen, p. 521. ** 267, 288, 289, 290 HAA Btys * 103rd HAA Rgt \u2013 as above; left for mobile training May 1942 ** 322, 323, 324 HAA Btys ** 420 HAA Bty \u2013 joined July 1941; left April 1942 * 107th HAA Rgt \u2013 as above; left December 1941 * 117th HAA Rgt \u2013 joined autumn, to 70 AA Bde December 1941, returned May, left for Orkney and Shetland Defences (OSDEF) late August 1942 ** 370, 371 HAA Btys ** 358 Bty \u2013 joined May, left July 1942 ** 369, 392 HAA Btys \u2013 left early August 1942 * 137th (Mixed) HAA Rgt \u2013 new unit formed November, joined December 1941, to 1 AA Group October 1942 ** 476, 481 (M) HA Btys ** 477 (M) HAA Bty \u2013 to 142nd (Mixed) HAA Rgt January 1942 ** 487 (M) HAA Bty \u2013 from 142nd (M) HAA Rgt January 1942 Loading a mobile multiple Z Battery launcher. * 149th (Mixed) HAA Rgt \u2013 new unit formed February, joined April 1942 ** 506, 507, 512 (M) HAA Btys * 154th (Mixed) HAA Rgt \u2013 new unit formed March, joined May 1942 ** 522, 526 (M) HAA Btys ** 560 (M) HAA Bty \u2013 joined June 1942 ** 550 (M) HAA Bty \u2013 joined August 1942 *29th LAA Rgt \u2013 joined autumn 1941, to 10 AA Division February 1942 ** 108, 121, 237 LAA Btys * 33rd LAA Rgt \u2013 as above; to 2 AA Division autumn 1941 * 63rd LAA Rgt \u2013 from 70 AA Bde August 1942 ** 188, 189, 190, 457 LAA Btys * 98th LAA Rgt \u2013 new unit formed December 1941, joined February, to 5 AA Division May 1942 ** 304, 305, 306, 481 LAA Btys * 134th LAA Rgt \u2013 new unit formed February, joined June, to 57 AA Bde August 1942 ** 192, 275, 287 LAA Btys ** 230 LAA Bty \u2013 left July 1942 ** 475 LAA Bty \u2013 joined July 1942 * 4th AA 'Z' Rgt \u2013 as above; to 70 AA Bde summer, rejoined autumn 1941, to 57 AA Bde August 1942 ** 194, 132, 139, 172 Z Btys * 33 AA Brigade Signal Office Mixed Sub-Section (part of No 2 Company, 4 AA Division Mixed Signal Unit, RCS) ===Later war=== A reorganisation of AA Command in October 1942 saw the AA divisions disbanded and replaced by a smaller number of AA Groups more closely aligned with the organisation of RAF Fighter Command. 33 AA Brigade came under a new 4 AA Group covering North West England and the West Midlands.Order of Battle of Non-Field Force Units in the United Kingdom, Part 27: AA Command, 1 October 1942, with amendments, TNA file WO 212/82.Routledge, pp. 400\u20131, Map 36. ====Order of Battle 1942\u201344==== AA Command formation sign worn by all units from October 1942 By this time the brigade was composed solely of HAA regiments following the redeployment of LAA guns to the South Coast.
