According to mathematician S. G. Dani, the Babylonian cuneiform tablet Plimpton 322 written ca. 1850 BCEMathematics Department, University of British Columbia, The Babylonian tablet Plimpton 322. \"contains fifteen Pythagorean triples with quite large entries, including (13500, 12709, 18541) which is a primitive triple,Three positive integers (a, b, c) form a primitive Pythagorean triple if c^2=a^2+b^2 and if the highest common factor of a, b, c is 1. In the particular Plimpton322 example, this means that 13500^2+ 12709^2= 18541^2 and that the three numbers do not have any common factors. However some scholars have disputed the Pythagorean interpretation of this tablet; see Plimpton 322 for details. indicating, in particular, that there was sophisticated understanding on the topic\" in Mesopotamia. *1st millennium BCE Baudhayana \u015aulba S\u016btras Earliest statement of Pythagorean Theorem: According to , the \u015aulba S\u016btras contain \"the earliest extant verbal expression of the Pythagorean Theorem in the world, although it had already been known to the Old Babylonians.\" > The diagonal rope (') of an oblong (rectangle) produces both which the flank > (p\u0101r\u015bvam\u0101ni) and the horizontal (') produce separately.\" Since the statement is a s\u016btra, it is necessarily compressed and what the ropes produce is not elaborated on, but the context clearly implies the square areas constructed on their lengths, and would have been explained so by the teacher to the student. ==See also== *Timeline of cultivation and domestication in South and West Asia *Timeline of mathematics ==Notes== ==References== *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. *. * *. *. *. *. *. *. *. * *. *. *. *. *. *. *. * * * * * * Category:History of South Asia Category:History of Western Asia Category:Lists of inventions or discoveries innovation in South and West Asia ",
