    "text": "\"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again\" is the title of a pop song composed by Tony Macaulay, Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway, which became the third U.S. Top 40 hit for The Fortunes in 1971. This sad song is about the singer experiencing a rainy day feeling, with his tears falling like rain as if it were always a Monday, rather than a sunny Sunday spent with his girlfriend. Part of the lead vocal passages are similar to a Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons song. The bridge is noted for its lines: \"Misty morning eyes/ I'm trying to disguise the way I feel/ But, I just can't hide it/ People seem to know/ The loneliness will show/ I'm thinking of my pride/ But, breaking up inside, girl.\" The song reached number 15 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 and number 8 on the Cash Box Top 100. It was also a hit in Canada (number 25) and charted minorly in Australia. Subsequently, Sonny & Cher covered the song on their album All I Ever Need is You. An abbreviated cover of \"Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again\" was included as part of the extended LP version of \"Stars on 45,\" a number one medley hit from 1981. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1971) !align=\"left\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|Australia KMR | style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |- |align=\"left\"|Canada RPM | style=\"text-align:center;\"|25 |- |align=\"left\"|UK | style=\"text-align:center;\"|51 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955-1990 - | style=\"text-align:center;\"|15 |- |U.S. Billboard Adult Contemporary |align=\"center\"|8 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|8 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1971) ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Rank |- |U.S. (Joel Whitburn's Pop Annual) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|127 |- |U.S. Cash Box Top 100 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|92 |} ==References== ==External links== * Lyrics of this song * Category:1971 singles Category:The Fortunes songs Category:Songs written by Tony Macaulay Category:Songs written by Roger Greenaway Category:Songs written by Roger Cook (songwriter) Category:1971 songs Category:Capitol Records singles ",
