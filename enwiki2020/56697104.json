    "text": "Microtis rara, commonly known as the scented onion orchid, is a species of orchid endemic to Australia, with the exception of the Northern Territory. It has a single hollow, onion-like leaf and up to fifty small green or yellowish- green, scented flowers. It is similar to Microtis oblonga and some authorities regard the two as being one species. == Description == Microtis rara is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber and a single erect, tapering, tubular leaf long and wide. Between ten and fifty green or greenish-yellow flowers are well spaced along a flowering stem tall. The flowers sweetly scented, long and wide. The dorsal sepal is egg-shaped, long, wide with a dished lower surface. The lateral sepals are linear to oblong, long, about wide with their tips rolled under. The petals are a curved lance shape, long, about wide and spread widely apart. The labellum is more or less oblong, long, wide with notched edges and a narrowed middle section. There are dark green calli in the centre of the labellum. Flowering occurs from November to January and is stimulated by fire the previous summer. ==Taxonomy and naming== Microtis rara was first formally described in 1810 by Robert Brown and the description was published in Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. The specific epithet (rara) is a Latin word meaning \"scarce\", \"scattered\" or \"dispersed\". Some authorities regard Microtis oblonga as being a race of M. rara. ==Distribution and habitat== The scented onion orchid grows swamps and wet forests and is widespread but not common, occurring in all states but not the Northern Territory. == References == == External links == * Category:Prasophyllinae rara Category:Endemic orchids of Australia Category:Orchids of New South Wales Category:Orchids of Queensland Category:Orchids of South Australia Category:Orchids of Victoria (Australia) Category:Orchids of Western Australia Category:Orchids of Tasmania Category:Plants described in 1810 ",
