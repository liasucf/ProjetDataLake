He\u2019s a master at giving his audience the music they want, but in this case he also pays homage to a classic sound that...is making a comeback. 'Huntin\u2019 and Fishin\u2019 and Lovin\u2019 Every Day' is filled with details that feel specific to Bryan\u2019s life or raising.\" ==Music video== The music video was directed by Michael Monaco and Hunter Jobes and premiered in April 2016. ==Commercial reception== The song first entered the Hot Country Songs chart at number 38 in August 2015 when it was released as a teaser before the release of the album Kill the Lights, selling 10,000 copies in its first week.
