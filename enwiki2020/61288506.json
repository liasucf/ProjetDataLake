It is significant for being the first all- new version of the Defender, breaking the engineering lineage with its predecessor, a descendant of the original Series Land Rovers of 1948. This modern monococque 4x4 is aimed at a more upmarket sector than its predecessor, leaving a gap in the market for those still wanting a more rugged utilitarian vehicle.Land Rover's sensitivity in this matter led them to litigate against Ineos, claiming that the Grenadier's visual similarity to the old Defender was a breach of the company's intellectual property rights.Allan, Lawrence (10 August 2020). \"Jaguar Land Rover's trademark court case: testimonies revealed\".
