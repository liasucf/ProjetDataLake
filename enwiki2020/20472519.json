He is esteemed as a godfather in the South Korean football. He was diligent and only absorbed in the football. He extremely avoided harmful things to human body including alcohol and tobacco, and had ardor for training. He played as a centre-half, but he was a playmaker who took part in the attack. He was noted for his workrate, rapid pace, and elaborate techniques, which could go around the field while he didn't drop the ball to the ground. Japan also couldn't ignore his skills, and selected him for the Japan national team. Kim became the only Korean, selected for the Japan squad for the 1936 Summer Olympics, and contributed to defeating Sweden by assisting the winning goal in the tournament. In 1937, Kim joined Waseda University which had many Japan national team's players but he went back to Korea because of the discrimination about Korean. He could participate in the Olympics with Korean nationality after the end of the Japanese forced occupation. He achieved the first victory of the South Korea football history against Mexico in the 1948 Summer Olympics, in which he participated as a player-coach. After the retirement, he managed South Korea at the 1954 FIFA World Cup and 1960 AFC Asian Cup. ==Career statistics== ===International=== Source: {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=6|Japan |1936||2||0 |- |1937||0||0 |- |1938||0||0 |- |1939||0||0 |- |1940||1||0 |- !Total||3||0 |- |rowspan=4|South Korea |1948||2||0 |- |1949||0||0 |- |1950||1||1 |- !Total||3||1 |- !colspan=2|Career total||6||1 |- |} ===Managerial=== {| class=wikitable !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|From !rowspan=2|To !colspan=5|Record !rowspan=2| |- ! ! !width=\"18\"| !width=\"18\"| ! |- |align=\"center\"|South Korea | May 1954 || June 1954 | |- |align=\"center\"|South Korea | November 1959 || April 1960 | |- |align=\"center\"|South Korea | September 1960 || June 1961 | |- |align=\"center\"|South Korea | August 1962 || October 1962 | |- |align=\"center\"|South Korea | September 1969 || October 1969 | |- !colspan=\"3\"|Total ! |} ==Honours== ===Player=== Soongsil College *All Joseon Football Tournament: 1931 Kyungsung FC *All Joseon Football Tournament: 1936 *Emperor's Cup: 1935 *Ch\u014dsen Shrine Games: 1935 *Meiji Shrine Games: 1935 Joseon Electrical Industry *Korean National Championship: 1949 Individual *Korean Football Hall of Fame: 2005 ===Manager=== South Korea *Asian Games silver medal: 1962 *AFC Asian Cup: 1960 Yangzee *Korean National Championship: 1968 *Asian Club Championship runner-up: 1969 == References == ==External links== * * * Japan National Football Team Database * Category:1910 births Category:1985 deaths Category:Japanese footballers Category:South Korean footballers Category:Japan international footballers Category:South Korea international footballers Category:Kyungsung FC players Category:Pyongyang FC players Category:Olympic footballers of Japan Category:Footballers at the 1936 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic footballers of South Korea Category:Footballers at the 1948 Summer Olympics Category:Dual internationalists (football) Category:South Korean football managers Category:South Korea national football team managers Category:1954 FIFA World Cup managers Category:South Korean football referees Category:Zainichi Korean people Category:Association football midfielders ",
