    "text": "Solaria was an Italian language modernist literary magazine published in Florence, Italy, between 1926 and 1936. The title is a reference to the city of sun. The magazine is known for its significant influence on young Italian writers. ==History and profile== Solaria was established in Florence in 1926. The founders were Alessandro Bonsanti and Alberto Carocci. The publisher was Edizioni di Solaria. The magazine was published on a monthly basis. The major goal of Solaria was to Europeanize Italian culture and to emphasize the contributions of Italian modernist writers such as Svevo and Federigo Tozzi to European modernism. The magazine adopted a modernist approach. Solaria had an anti-fascist stance. The contributors of the magazine were mostly the short story writers. They included Alberto Carocci, Eugenio Montale, Elio Vittorini, Carlo Emilio Gadda. and Renato Poggioli. The novel of Elio Vittorini, Il garofano rosso, was first published in the magazine. The magazine also featured poems by young Italian artists such as Sandro Penna. It was harshly criticised by other Italian literary circles and magazines, including Il Selvaggio, Il Bargello and Il Frontespizio, due to its frequent coverage of Jewish writers. After producing a total of forty-one volumes Solaria ceased publication in 1936. The final issue was dated 1934, although it was published in 1936. In fact, it was banned due to the censorship exerted by the fascist authorities. The reason for this censorship was partly the serialization of Elio Vittorini's novel, Il garofano rosso, in the magazine. ==References== Category:1926 establishments in Italy Category:1936 disestablishments in Italy Category:Censorship in Italy Category:Defunct literary magazines published in Italy Category:Italian-language magazines Category:Magazines established in 1926 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1936 Category:Mass media in Florence Category:Modernism Category:Monthly magazines published in Italy Category:Poetry literary magazines ",
