    "text": "Charvet shirt from the 1930s, Norsk Folkemuseum, Oslo, Norway A shirt is a cloth garment for the upper body (from the neck to the waist). Originally an undergarment worn exclusively by men, it has become, in American English, a catch-all term for a broad variety of upper-body garments and undergarments. In British English, a shirt is more specifically a garment with a collar, sleeves with cuffs, and a full vertical opening with buttons or snaps (North Americans would call that a \"dress shirt\", a specific type of collared shirt). A shirt can also be worn with a necktie under the shirt collar. == History == The world's oldest preserved garment, discovered by Flinders Petrie, is a \"highly sophisticated\" linen shirt from a First Dynasty Egyptian tomb at Tarkan, dated to c. 3000 BC: \"the shoulders and sleeves have been finely pleated to give form-fitting trimness while allowing the wearer room to move. The small fringe formed during weaving along one edge of the cloth has been placed by the designer to decorate the neck opening and side seam.\"Barber, Elizabeth Wayland (1994). Women's Work. The first 20,000 Years, p.135.Norton & Company, New York. The shirt was an item of clothing that only men could wear as underwear, until the twentieth century.William L. Brown III, \"Some Thoughts on Men's Shirts in America, 1750-1900\", Thomas Publications, Gettysburg, PA 1999. , p. 7 Although the women's chemise was a closely related garment to the men's, it is the men's garment that became the modern shirt.Dorothy K. Burnham, \"Cut My Cote\", Royal Ontario Museum, Toronto, Ontario 1973. , p. 14 In the Middle Ages, it was a plain, undyed garment worn next to the skin and under regular garments. In medieval artworks, the shirt is only visible (uncovered) on humble characters, such as shepherds, prisoners, and penitents.C. Willett Cunnington and Phillis Cunnington, The History of Underclothes, Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. pp. 23\u201325 In the seventeenth century, men's shirts were allowed to show, with much the same erotic import as visible underwear today.C. Willett and Phillis Cunnington, The History of Underclothes, Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. pp. 54 In the eighteenth century, instead of underpants, men \"relied on the long tails of shirts ... to serve the function of drawers.Linda Baumgarten, \"What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America\", The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, in association with the Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut 2002, , p. 27 Eighteenth- century costume historian Joseph Strutt believed that men who did not wear shirts to bed were indecent.Linda Baumgarten, \"What Clothes Reveal: The Language of Clothing in Colonial and Federal America\", The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation, Williamsburg, Virginia, in association with the Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut 2002, , pp. 20-22 Even as late as 1879, a visible shirt with nothing over it was considered improper. The shirt sometimes had frills at the neck or cuffs. In the sixteenth century, men's shirts often had embroidery, and sometimes frills or lace at the neck and cuffs and through the eighteenth-century long neck frills, or jabots, were fashionable.C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, \"The History of Underclothes\", Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. pp. 36\u201339C. Willet and Phillis Cunnington, \"The History of Underclothes\", Dover Publications Inc., New York 1992. pp. 73 Coloured shirts began to appear in the early nineteenth century, as can be seen in the paintings of George Caleb Bingham. They were considered casual wear, for lower-class workers only, until the twentieth century. For a gentleman, \"to wear a sky-blue shirt was unthinkable in 1860 but had become standard by 1920 and, in 1980, constituted the most commonplace event.\"Michel Pastoureau and Jody Gladding (translator), \"The Devil's Cloth: A History of Stripes\", Columbia University Press, New York 2001 , p. 65 European and American women began wearing shirts in 1860, when the Garibaldi shirt, a red shirt as worn by the freedom fighters under Giuseppe Garibaldi, was popularized by Empress Eug\u00e9nie of France.Anne Buck, \"Victorian Costume\", Ruth Bean Publishers, Carlton, Bedford, England 1984. Young, Julia Ditto, \"The Rise of the Shirt Waist\", Good Housekeeping, May 1902, pp. 354\u2013357 At the end of the nineteenth century, the Century Dictionary described an ordinary shirt as \"of cotton, with linen bosom, wristbands and cuffs prepared for stiffening with starch, the collar and wristbands being usually separate and adjustable\". The first documented appearance of the expression \"To give the shirt off one's back\", happened in 1771 as an idiom that indicates extreme desperation or generosity and is still in common usage. In 1827 Hannah Montague, a housewife in upstate New York, invents the detachable collar. Tired of constantly washing her husband's entire shirt when only the collar needed it, she cut off his collars and devised a way of attaching them to the neckband after washing. It wasn't until the 1930s that collar stays became popular, although these early accessories resembled tie clips more than the small collar stiffeners available today. They connected the collar points to the necktie, keeping them in place == Types == Three types of shirt * Camp shirt \u2013 a loose, straight- cut, short sleeved shirt or blouse with a simple placket front-opening and a \"camp collar\". * Dress shirt \u2013 shirt with a formal (somewhat stiff) collar, a full-length opening at the front from the collar to the hem (usually buttoned), and sleeves with cuffs * White shirt - usually dress shirt which its colour is white ** Dinner shirt \u2013 a shirt specifically made to be worn with male evening wear, e.g. a black tie or white tie. ** Guayabera \u2013 an embroidered dress shirt with four pockets. * Poet shirt \u2013 a loose-fitting shirt or blouse with full bishop sleeves, usually with large frills on the front and on the cuffs. * T-shirt \u2013 also \"tee shirt\", a casual shirt without a collar or buttons, made of a stretchy, finely knit fabric, usually cotton, and usually short-sleeved.

Initially a men's garment, is normally seen in modern times being worn by women * Shirtwaist \u2013 historically (circa. 1890\u20131920) a woman's tailored shirt (also called a \"tailored waist\") cut like a man's dress shirt;For example, see Laura I. Baldt, A.M., Clothing for Women: Selection, Design and Construction, J.B. Lippincott Company, Philadelphia, PA 1924 (second edition), p. 312 in contemporary usage, a woman's dress cut like a men's dress shirt to the waist, then extended into dress length at the bottom * Nightshirt \u2013 often oversized, ruined or inexpensive light cloth undergarment shirt for sleeping. * Halter top \u2013 a shoulderless, sleeveless garment for women.

The smallest differences may have significance to a cultural or occupational group. Recently, (late twentieth century, into the twenty-first century) it has become common to use tops as a form of advertisement. Many of these distinctions apply to other upper-body garments, such as coats and sweaters. === Shoulders and arms === ==== Sleeves ==== Shirts may: * have no covering of the shoulders or arms \u2013 a tube top (not reaching higher than the armpits, staying in place by elasticity) * have only shoulder straps, such as spaghetti straps * cover the shoulders, but without sleeves * have shoulderless sleeves, short or long, with or without shoulder straps, that expose the shoulders, but cover the rest of the arm from the biceps and triceps down to at least the elbow * have short sleeves, varying from cap sleeves (covering only the shoulder and not extending below the armpit) to half sleeves (elbow length), with some having quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point that covers half of the biceps and triceps area) * have three- quarter-length sleeves (reaching to a point between the elbow and the wrist) * have long sleeves (reaching a point to the wrist to a little beyond wrist) ==== Cuffs ==== Shirts with long sleeves may further be distinguished by the cuffs: * no buttons \u2013 a closed placket cuff * buttons (or analogous fasteners such as snaps) \u2013 single or multiple. A single button or pair aligned parallel with the cuff hem is considered a button cuff. Multiple buttons aligned perpendicular to the cuff hem, or parallel to the placket constitute a barrel cuff. * buttonholes designed for cufflinks ** a French cuff, where the end half of the cuff is folded over the cuff itself and fastened with a cufflink. This type of cuff has four buttons and a short placket. ** more formally, a link cuff \u2013 fastened like a French cuff, except is not folded over, but instead hemmed, at the edge of the sleeve. * asymmetrical designs, such as one-shoulder, one-sleeve or with sleeves of different lengths. === Lower hem === * hanging to the waist * leaving the belly button area bare (much more common for women than for men). See halfshirt. * covering the crotch * covering part of the legs (essentially this is a dress; however, a piece of clothing is perceived either as a shirt (worn with trousers) or as a dress (in Western culture mainly worn by women)). * going to the floor (as a pajama shirt) === Body === * vertical opening on the front side, all the way down, with buttons or zipper. When fastened with buttons, this opening is often called the placket front. * similar opening, but in back. * left and right front side not separable, put on over the head; with regard to upper front side opening: ** V-shaped permanent opening on the top of the front side ** no opening at the upper front side ** vertical opening on the upper front side with buttons or zipper *** men's shirts are often buttoned on the right whereas women's are often buttoned on the left. === Neck === * with polo-neck * with \"scoop\" neck * with v-neck but no collar * with plunging neck * with open or tassel neck * with collar ** windsor collar or spread collar \u2013 a dressier collar designed with a wide distance between points (the spread) to accommodate the windsor knot tie. The standard business collar. ** tab collar \u2013 a collar with two small fabric tabs that fasten together behind a tie to maintain collar spread. ** wing collar \u2013 best suited for the bow tie, often only worn for very formal occasions. ** straight collar \u2013 or point collar, a version of the windsor collar that is distinguished by a narrower spread to better accommodate the four-in-hand knot, pratt knot, and the half-windsor knot. A moderate dress collar. ** button-down collar \u2013 A collar with buttons that fasten the points or tips to a shirt. The most casual of collars worn with a tie. ** band collar \u2013 essentially the lower part of a normal collar, first used as the original collar to which a separate collarpiece was attached. Rarely seen in modern fashion. Also casual. ** turtle neck collar \u2013 A collar that covers most of the throat. * without collar *** V-neck no collar \u2013 The neckline protrudes down the chest and to a point, creating a \"V\"-looking neckline. === Other features === * pockets \u2013 how many (if any), where, and with regard to closure: not closable, just a flap, or with a button or zipper. * with or without hood Some combinations are not applicable, e.g. a tube top cannot have a collar. ==Measures and sizes== The main measures for a jacket are: * Shoulders * Bust * Waist * Hip * Sleeve * Length, from the neck to the waist or hip. ===Sizes=== *Asia Size M = US/EU Size XS. *Asia Size L = US/EU Size S. *Asia Size XL = US/EU Size M. *Asia Size XXL = US/EU Size L. *Asia Size XXXL = US/EU Size XL. *Asia Size XXXXL = US/EU Size XXL. == Types of fabric == There are two main categories of fibres used: natural fibre and man- made fibre (synthetics or petroleum based). Some natural fibres are linen, the first used historically, hemp, cotton, the most used, ramie, wool, silk and more recently bamboo or soya. Some synthetic fibres are polyester, tencel, viscose, etc. Polyester mixed with cotton (poly-cotton) is often used. Fabrics for shirts are called shirtings. The four main weaves for shirtings are plain weave, oxford, twill and satin. Broadcloth, poplin and end-on-end are variations of the plain weave. After weaving, finishing can be applied to the fabric. == Shirts and politics == In the 1920s and 1930s, fascists wore different coloured shirts: * Black shirts were used by the Italian fascists, and in Britain, Finland and Germany and Croatia. The party leaders of Dravidar Kazhagam in India wear only black shirts to symbolise atheism. * Brownshirts were worn by German Nazis of the SA. * The Blueshirts was a fascist movement in Ireland and Canada, and the colour of the Portuguese Nacional Sindicalistas, the Spanish Falange Espa\u00f1ola, the French Solidarit\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise, and the Chinese Blue Shirts Society. * Green shirts were used in Hungary, Ireland, Romania, Brazil and Portugal. * Camisas Doradas (golden shirts) were used in Mexico. * Red shirts were worn by the racist and antisemitic Bulgarian Ratniks. * Silver Shirts were worn in the United States of America. * Grey shirts were worn by members of the Fatherland League in Norway. In addition, red shirts have been used to symbolize a variety of different political groups, including Garibaldi's Italian revolutionaries, nineteenth-century American street gangs, and socialist militias in Spain and Mexico during the 1930s. Different colored shirts signified the major opposing sides that featured prominently in the 2008 Thai political crisis, with red having been worn by the supporters of the populist People's Power Party (PPP), and yellow being worn by the supporters of the royalist and anti-Thaksin Shinawatra movement the People's Alliance for Democracy (PAD). Each side is commonly referred to as the 'red shirts' and 'yellow shirts' respectively, though the later opponents of the later Thaksin supporting groups have largely ceased wearing yellow shirts to protest rallies. In the UK, the Social Credit movement of the thirties wore green shirts. ==Industrial production== File:Dress Shirt production Line allocation in a RMG factory of Bangladesh.JPG|Shirt production line File:Dress Shirt sewing in a RMG factory of Bangladesh.jpg|Factory sewing File:Dress Shirt on Conveyor in a RMG factory of Bangladesh.JPG|Shirts on a conveyor File:Hanging Shirt during Finishing.JPG|Shirts awaiting finishing File:Hanging Shirt for Final Final Finishing.JPG|Kids shirts for quality checking File:Shirt review by buyer.JPG|Manufacturer and buyer reviewing product File:Arrow Dress Shirt producing in a RMG factory of Bangladesh.jpg|Dress shirt == See also == * Cardigan (sweater) * Descamisado * Jermyn Street, home of the oldest English shirtmakers == References == == External links == * * Category:History of clothing Category:History of clothing (Western fashion) ",
