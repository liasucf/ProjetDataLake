    "text": "In Greek mythology, Galatea (; ; \"she who is milk-white\")Galene in the Smith Classics Dictionary . The suffix -teia or -theia means \"goddess\", as in other Nereid names: Amatheia, Psamathe, Leukotheia, Pasitheia, etc. Hesiod has both a Galene (\"Calm-Sea\") and a Galateia named as Nereids. Galateia as \"sea-calm Goddess\" seem a likely inference; the reasoning for Galateia as Milky-White comes from the adjectival form of galaktos, galakteia. was the name of the following figures: * Galatea, a Nereid who loved the shepherd Acis.Hesiod, Theogony; Homer, Iliad. * Galatea, the statue of a woman created by Pygmalion.Metamorphoses x.243ff. * Galatea, daughter of Eurytius, son of Sparton. Her husband Lamprus wished to have a son and told her to expose the child if it turned out to be a girl. So when Galatea gave birth to a girl she asked the gods to change her sex, and Leto turned her into a boy (Leucippus)Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses, 17, with reference to Nicander == References == Category:Women in Greek mythology ",
