    "text": "In some countries, security police are those persons employed by or for a governmental agency or corporation with large campuses to provide police and security services to those agencies' properties. Security police protect their agency's facilities, properties, personnel, users, visitors and operations from harm and may enforce certain laws and administrative regulations. Most security police have at least some arrest authority. The law enforcement powers of security police vary widely: in some cases limited to those of private persons yet in others amounting to full police powers equivalent to state/provincial, or local law enforcement. As distinct from general law enforcement, the primary focus of security police is on the protection of specific properties and persons. This causes some overlap with functions normally performed by security guards. However, security police are distinguished from guards by greater authority: often higher levels of training, and correspondingly higher expectations of performance in the protection of life and property. In other countries, 'security police' is the name given to the secret security and intelligence services charged with protecting the state at the highest level, including responsibilities such as personal protection of the head of state, counter-espionage, and anti- terrorism. ==Types of special police and similar organizations== Special police may include: # Campus police, who are often hired and sworn in as state law enforcement officers, such as the Los Angeles School Police Department or City University of New York Public Safety Department # Housing police, such as the New York City Housing Authority Police Department, who protect publicly owned housing or \"housing projects\" # Airport police such as the Los Angeles Airport Police # Hospital police such as the New York City Department of Health and Hospitals Police and the Texas Medical Center Police. # Park police, with full state police officer powers such as the New York State Park Police, who primarily protect the often vast properties of their employing agency # All uniformed United States federal police agencies such as Military Police units (MP), the U.S. Capitol Police, the Federal Protective Service, and the FBI Police, whose officers are sworn in as federal law enforcement officers with the duty to provide police and security services to federally owned buildings # Capitol police, who protect state properties such as legislative and executive buildings, which can also include executive protection functions # Some County police, such as the former Los Angeles County Office of Public Safety, who provide restricted services to local governments # Special police (also see Auxiliary police), in the protection of public properties, such as the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum which is protected by sworn Special Police Officers as authorized by D.C. Code, \u00a7 4-114 (1981) # Court officers, such as New York State Court Officers, who provide police and security services at court houses # Company police to provide security police services on company or private property by contract, where local law permits private organizations to contract for police powers; this for example includes railway police such as the Amtrak Police. 12\\. U.S. Federal Reserve Police, the U.S. Federal Reserve Police is the law enforcement unit of the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. ==Legal authority of Security Police Officers == All special police officers derive their authority from two sources: # the laws of their nation, territory and/or municipality # the property rights of their employing or contracting agency or activity, which may be public or private or a mixture of both These powers might include the power to detain, arrest, investigate criminal offenses, carry weapons, employ force, and/or take other actions to protect life and property beyond that of the ordinary citizen. One key distinction is between \"sworn\" (or bound by oath or affirmation to uphold the laws even at personal risk), and \"non-sworn\" or \"civilian\" who are ordinary employees with normal obligations to an employer. Some security police are full-fledged peace officers with the same powers as regular Peace Officers. Others have enhanced powers which are limited by law to the properties they protect, or a specified radius or distance. In some cases these powers are expanded by a Memorandum of Understanding or other legal document where other policing agencies delegate additional powers to enforce local law. Some special police have the more limited powers than a security guards in compliance with the laws of their jurisdiction. These distinctions are of particular importance to special police and their employers. === (special police) or Security police around the world=== ==== Australia==== The RAAF Security Police is responsible for base security and policing the RAAF and they work closely with the Airfield Defence Guards. The Military Working Dog Unit also provides a further security function. Most state police force in Australia employs a team of officers known as Protective Security Officers (PSOs). Stationed in and around public or government buildings, these PSOs are armed (to varying degrees) and wear a slightly different uniform. They are also called upon by regular police officers if the need arises. They generally undergo training at the state police college and share many resources. Some police officers have used the PSO path as a stepping stone to their current roles. In New South Wales, an armed internal unit of the New South Wales Police Force is staffed by Special Constables who hold identical powers and immunities of a police officer at the rank of Constable. Special Constables wear a similar uniform to police officers, carry arms and appointments and are issued a warrant card and badge. Special Constables provide security services to select government and police complexes.https://www.policecareer.vic.gov.au/pso ==== Germany==== The Polizei beim Deutschen Bundestag (Polizei DBT, commonly known as Bundestagspolizei) is the smallest and least known police agency in Germany.

Park rangers or Park police are generally stationed at the different National parks across the US. =====Federal===== Most, if not all, of the federal government's uniformed police officers are security police who primarily serve to protect federal property and personnel. An example would be the Federal Protective Service who protect federal buildings. Officers of the Transportation Security Administration look after the country's entry-exit points and may also work alongside local/state police, depending on that location. This department performs various duties, including luggage and passenger screening. Some officers are armed and have powers of arrest. Many officers get to travel on flights and wear civilian clothing to blend in with the surroundings. Their main purpose is to prevent terrorism or hijacking. There are a multitude of other agencies which perform security related roles in the Federal Government, including the US Secret Service (guarding the White House and certain Government buildings).

These may be employees of a public agency or private contractors. ======California====== The complexity of special policing and special police authority is illustrated by these examples, which are not meant to be exhaustive. In California, peace officer powers are granted by the California Penal Code under a number of different code sections. Cities, counties and special districts are authorized to form their own law enforcement agencies. Peace officer training is regulated by a state agency, Peace Officer Standards and Training or POST. This training can consist of as little as a 40-hour PC 832 course (for park rangers, probation officers or fire investigators who might make an arrest in the course of their duties), or as much as a 700-hour POST Basic Academy (for entry level peace officers). Security guards (including off duty peace officers) may only carry firearms in private employment if licensed by the state licensing authority, the Bureau of Security and Investigative Services. Persons regularly employed by public agencies as security guards, however, may be exempt from BSIS regulation, if they have completed POST-certified training in accordance with PC 832 or other Penal Code sections. However, security guards employed by a private employer are still regulated by BSIS even though the client may be a public agency. ======Orange County====== Orange County Sheriff's Department Special Officers are duly sworn and dedicated California Peace Officers under California Penal Code section 830.33/36, who provide law enforcement and policing services for the department in connection with the county bus system, airport, the operations of the local courts and the custody of local prisoners. These Sheriff's Special Officers attend a 16-week training academy at the Orange County Sheriff's Regional Training Academy that instructs new Officers on laws of arrest, firearms training, arrest and control techniques, physical fitness, field and patrol tactics, first responder medical training, and corrections/custody training. Being duly sworn California Peace Officers, Orange County Sheriff's Special Officers maintain peace officer authority both on-and-off duty. ======Los Angeles====== In the Los Angeles metropolitan area, there are numerous examples of security police with different levels of authority and responsibility. * Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department - The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department employs Security Assistants (Security Officer I) and Security Officers (Security Officer II) who assist Deputy Sheriffs in the protection of various county government facilities.
