    "text": "Ezekiel 32 is the thirty-second chapter of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets.Theodore Hiebert, et al. 1996. The New Interpreter's Bible: Volume VI. Nashville: Abingdon. This chapter contains two revelations from God regarding Egypt and its Pharaoh, concluding Ezekiel's prophecies against Egypt (chapters 29-32).Davidson, A. B. (1893), Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges on Ezekiel 29, accessed 24 December 2019 ==Text== The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 32 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). ==Verse 1== : And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, on the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying, : NKJV The date corresponds to 3 March, 586 or 585 BCE, based on an analysis by German theologian Bernhard Lang.Lang, Bernhard (1981) Ezechiel. Darmstadt. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesselschaft, cited in Kee et al 2008, p. 210. The New Living Translation makes explicit reference to 3 March as the date.: NLT ==Verse 2== : \"Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharaoh king of Egypt, and say to him: :: \u2018You are like a young lion among the nations, :: And you are like a monster in the seas, :: Bursting forth in your rivers, :: Troubling the waters with your feet, :: And fouling their rivers.\" NKJV * \"Son of man\" (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd -): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. * \"Pharaoh\" (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05e8\u05e2\u05d4 '; Egyptian: pr-\u00b1o, \"great house\"; Greek: \u03a6\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c9, Pharao): the title of ancient Egyptian kings, of royal court, and (in new kingdom) of the king, until the Persian invasion. ==Verse 17== : It came to pass also in the twelfth year, on the fifteenth day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying:: NKJV The date, depending on the month, corresponds to a day between April 27, 586 BCE to March 17, 585 BCE, based on the analysis by Bernhard Lang. The New Living Translation assumes the month is the same as in verse 1, so this revelation would have been heard on 17 March 585 BCE.: NLT ==Verse 27== : They do not lie with the mighty :: Who are fallen of the uncircumcised, :: Who have gone down to hell with their weapons of war; : They have laid their swords under their heads, :: But their iniquities will be on their bones, :: Because of the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. (NKJV) Egypt will join other nations which were judged by God in \"the depths of the earth\" (\"Pit\" or \"Sheol\").The New Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha, Augmented Third Edition, New Revised Standard Version, Indexed.
