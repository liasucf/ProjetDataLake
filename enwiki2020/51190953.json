Forster: 1879-1920. The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press. p. 86 ==Career== Woolley was born in East Bergholt, Suffolk. His father was Joseph Woolley, the Archdeacon of Suffolk. He studied anatomy and physiology at King's College, Cambridge. He obtained his M.D. from Cambridge University in 1912. In 1902 he was elected a member of The Physiological Society and he published papers in the Journal of Physiology (1907-1915). He worked as a lecturer at St Thomas's Hospital.O'Connor, W. J. (1991).

Longmans, Green & Co. \"V. J. Woolley, who resigned from the S.P.R. in 1932 on account of friction with certain of the officers.\" In February 1927, with the co-operation of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), Woolley who was at the time the Research Officer for the SPR, arranged a telepathy experiment in which radio listeners were asked to take part. The experiment involved 'agents' thinking about five selected objects in an office at Tavistock Square, whilst listeners on the radio were asked to identify the objects from the BBC studio at Savoy Hill. 24, 659 answers were received. The results revealed no evidence for telepathy.Mauskopf, Seymour H; McVaugh, Michael Rogers. (1980). The Elusive Science: Origins of Experimental Psychical Research.
