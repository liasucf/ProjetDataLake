    "text": "Bug is a play by American playwright Tracy Letts. It was adapted into a film in 2006, with Letts writing the screenplay and Michael Shannon reprising his role as Peter. == Synopsis == Most of the play takes place in a seedy motel room. Lonely cocktail waitress Agnes lives there, hiding from her violent ex- con ex-husband Jerry Goss. One night, her lesbian biker friend R.C. introduces her to Peter, a Gulf War veteran who might be AWOL. She gets involved with Peter, who grows increasingly paranoid about the war in Iraq, UFOs, the Oklahoma City bombing, cult suicides, and then secret government experiments on soldiers -- eventually drawing Agnes into his delusions. The play deals with the issues of love, paranoia, conspiracy theories, and Agnes' slow descent into insanity under Peter's influence. ==Production history== ===London premiere=== The play originally premiered at the Gate Theatre in Notting Hill, London, England on September 20, 1996.Financial Times: \"Bug, Gate Theatre, London W11, Opened 20 September, 1996\" (review by Ian Shuttleworth) The rehearsals were at A Red Orchid Theatre in Chicago, Illinois.PerformInk.com: \"Bug, Killer Joe's Dysfunctional Relation, Makes its Midwest Debut at A Red Orchid\", by Lucia Mauro *Shannon Cochran - Agnes White *Michael Shannon - Peter Evans ===American premieres=== Following its London run, the play made its U.S. debut at Ithaca, New York, followed by the Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company in Washington, D.C.
