    "text": "Fighting Blood is a 1951 short Australian documentary about boxing in Australia. It included footage of boxers such as Les Darcy, Dave Sands, Jack Hassen, Alfie Clay, Elley Bennett, Freddie Dawson, Vic Patrick, Ron Richards and Fred Henneberry. The Adelaide Advertiser called the film short, but brilliantly produced... In 18 minutes' screen time is packed the neatest, crispest KO to the wise acres that could be imagined even by the American movie experts.\" ==References== ==External links== *Fighting Blood at Australian Screen Online *Fighting Blood at National Film and Sound Archive * Category:1951 films Category:1950s sports films Category:Australian documentary films Category:Boxing films Category:Australian films ",
