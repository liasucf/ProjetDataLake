He came to Quebec in 1801 and was employed by Henry Usborne in a timber and ship building business. Patterson took over the operation of the Quebec branch when Osborne returned to England. In 1811, he acquired property at the Montmorency Falls where he established a large sawmill operation. Patterson also operated facilities on the B\u00e9cancour River and the Etchemin River and also acquired cutting rights on large tracts of land in the Bois- Francs region, the Eastern Townships and along the Ottawa River.
