The first fort on the site dates to the Roman period. The medieval castle was razed in 1609 and only small traces remain. ==Lords== ===7th century=== The first known lord of Vergy is Gu\u00e9rin (Warin) de Vergy, brother of saint Leodegar. Gu\u00e9rin was stoned around 681 at the foot of the rocky spur at Vergy, shortly after his brother's martyrdom.L'association L'Abbaye de Saint-Vivant ===First House of Vergy (9th\u201310th centuries)=== The first house of Vergy arose in the 9th century with Warin, or Gu\u00e9rin, I of Vergy(760 \u2013 >819), who was count of Chalon and count of M\u00e2con, then count of Auvergne (818).

Pope Alexander III took refuge there in 1159. It was during this era that the church of Saint-Saturnin was built, still to be seen today. ===Castle (13th\u201317th century)=== With the other Burgundian possessions, Vergy was merged into the royal domains in 1477, on the death of Charles the Bold.
