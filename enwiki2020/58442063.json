She delivers a top-notch performance and is perfect as Pammi. Jordan Sandhu impresses in a short but important role. Karamjit Anmol and Harby Sangha are delightful to watch. Nirmal Rishi is first-rate and Shehnaz Gill makes an impact.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indian films Category:Punjabi-language films Category:2019 films Category:2010s Punjabi- language films Category:Indian romantic comedy films ",
