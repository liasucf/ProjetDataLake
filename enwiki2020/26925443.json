A Roman road connecting Emona and the Lo\u017e Valley () ran past the village. In late antiquity it was protected by a 328 m defensive wall with towers. The village was heavily affected by the Second World War.

The Kra\u0161ovec family was murdered by Italian forces on 12 September that year. In 1943, three houses in the village were burned on 31 January, and additional houses on 4 August.Savnik, Roman, ed. 1971. Krajevni leksikon Slovenije, vol. 2.
