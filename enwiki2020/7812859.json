    "text": "Belmont Park (French: Parc Belmont) was an amusement park that operated between 1923 and 1983 in the Montreal neighborhood of Cartierville in Quebec, Canada. Located on the banks of Riviere des Prairies, Belmont Park was best known for its wooden roller coaster, the Cyclone,Closed Canadian Parks but at one time or another had a Philadelphia Toboggan Company carousel, Ferris wheel, picnic grounds, dance hall, swimming pool, roller skating rink plus numerous other rides for adults and a \"Kiddieland.\" Belmont Park, which had opened on June 9, 1923, closed permanently on October 13, 1983. This followed a police raid that may have been motivated by city hall's displeasure at the park, a private venture, taking away business from the then city-owned La Ronde. ==Media== In 1972, it was the object of a short film, \u00c0 mort (To Death), by Pierre Falardeau. It also served as the setting for the 1957 National Film Board of Canada film Pierrot in Montreal, in which mime Guy Hoffman demonstrates the stock character Pierrot. ==Gallery== File:Amusement Park.
