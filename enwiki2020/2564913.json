    "text": "Maxime Brunerie (born 21 May 1977, in Courcouronnes) is a convicted criminal and far-right activist, known for the failed assassination of the then French President Jacques Chirac on 14 July 2002. == Biography == === Early life === Maxime Brunerie was born 21 May 1977 in Courcouronnes, the son of Annie and Jean Brunerie. He was a far-right activist, participated in protests and worked as a janitor. Diagnosed with lymphoma in 1998 and undergoing chemotherapy, Brunerie found a propaganda sticker of the neo-Nazi French and European Nationalist Party (PNFE), and became a member of the group between June and November 1998, when he left the \"agonizing party\" to join the Groupe Union D\u00e9fense, renamed Unit\u00e9 Radicale early that year. In June 1999, Brunerie entered the National Republican Movement led by Bruno M\u00e9gret, and ran for the party during the 2001 municipal elections in the 18th arrondissement of Paris. Brunerie also attended BTS studies in management accounting after 2000. === Assassination attempt === While Jacques Chirac was reviewing troops in a motorcade such as this one on Bastille Day 2002, he was shot at by Brunerie. On 14 July 2002, 25-year-old Brunerie attempted to assassinate French president Jacques Chirac by firearm during the Bastille Day parade on the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The week before the attempt, Brunerie obtained a .22 Rifle. On the day before the attempt, Brunerie left a message on the Combat 18 guestbook saying \"Watch the Tv This Sunday, i will be the star... Death to zog,88!\" CRS in riot control gear Armed with a .22 rifle hidden in a guitar case, Brunerie attempted to fire one shot from the sidewalk at the passing presidential motorcade before spectators noticed Brunerie. Brunerie then attempted suicide but spectators were able to divert his gun before the police were able to arrest him. According to police, the shot was very wide and the shooter's inexperience and lack of preparation made unlikely a successful assassination attempt. Brunerie was found to have been linked to the far-right group Unit\u00e9 Radicale (which was dissolved in the aftermath of the shooting), and had been a candidate for the far-right party Mouvement National R\u00e9publicain at a local election, as well as being associated with the French and European Nationalist Party. After the police searched his house, they found a copy of Mein Kampf and a skinhead-themed music CD. Brunerie's trial began on 6 December 2004. The court eventually found the defendant guilty of attempted murder, judging that his mental responsibility, though diminished, was not abolished. On 10 December 2004, Brunerie was sentenced to ten years of prison. He was freed after seven years in jail, on 3 August 2009. === After his release === He stated that he did not want to kill Chirac, he wanted to commit suicide by cop by being beaten to death by the GIGN. He finished his BTS in management accounting in prison. He was interviewed by Europe 1 not too long after his release, stating that he \"lost it\" in 2002 and wants to move on. In 2011, he released an autobiography titled A normal life : I wanted to kill Jacques Chirac and now says he is far from any political activism. The same year he founded a book reselling company. His political views changed; he requested a membership for the Democratic Movement but he got denied. He voted for S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal in the 2011 elections. In 2011, he posted an update on a literary review called Bordel; the update was removed before the review was published. In 2012, he triggered a controversy by participating in the jury of a literary prize created by Laurence Biava. In 2013, he participated in an protest against same-sex marriage, where he was suspected of violence against his companion. == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century French criminals Category:Failed assassins Category:French assassins Category:Far-right politicians in France Category:French nationalists Category:French prisoners and detainees Category:People convicted of attempted murder Category:People from Essonne Category:Prisoners and detainees of France ",
