    "text": "Difluorosilane is a gaseous chemical compound with formula SiH2F2. It can be considered as a derivative of silane with two hydrogen atoms replaced with fluorine. ==Production== Difluorosilane can be made by fluorinating dichlorosilane with antimony trifluoride. \u90dd\u6da6\u84c9 \u7b49. \u65e0\u673a\u5316\u5b66\u4e1b\u4e66 \u7b2c\u4e09\u5377 \u78b3 \u7845 \u9517\u5206\u65cf. \u79d1\u5b66\u51fa\u7248\u793e, 1998. pp 178. 2.3 \u5364\u4ee3\u7845\u70f7 :3 SiH2Cl2 \\+ 2 SbF3 \u2192 3 SiH2F2 \\+ 2 SbCl3 Some is also made in a reaction of silicon tetrafluoride with hydrogen :SiF4 \\+ 2 H2 \u2192 SiH2F2 \\+ 2 HF Traces of difluorosilane are made when coal is burnt. ==Properties== Difluorosilane is a gas with boiling point \u221277.8 \u00b0C, and a freezing point of \u2212122 \u00b0C. It has no colour. The silicon\u2013fluorine bond length in difluorosilane is 1.358 \u00c5 which is greater than that in fluorosilane but less than the length in trifluorosilane. ==Reactions== In an electric discharge, hydrogen atoms are preferentially removed from the molecule and SiHF2SiHF2 is formed along with hydrogen. :2 SiH2F2 \u2192 SiHF2SiHF2 \\+ H2 At elevated temperatures, difluorosilane can disproportionate by swapping hydrogen and fluorine atoms between molecules to form fluorosilane and trifluorosilane. ==Use== Difluorosilane is used in dental varnish in order to prevent tooth cavities. Difluorosilane is also used in chemical vapour deposition to deposit silicon nitride films. ==References== Category:Fluorine compounds Category:Silicon compounds Category:Gases ",
