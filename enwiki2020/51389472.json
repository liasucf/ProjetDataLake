    "text": "Teitanblood is a Spanish extreme metal band formed in 2003. Based in Madrid, the band currently consists of NSK (vocals, guitar, bass) and J (drums). The band released its debut album, Seven Chalices in 2009. Its follow-up, Death, was released 13 May 2014 via The Ajna Offensive and Norma Evangelium Diaboli record labels. The latter record was included on Decibel magazine\u2019s list of Top 40 Albums Of 2014 as number 26. Teitanblood's music is generally labeled as death metal and black metal. The band's debut was described by BrooklynVegan as \"the most discordant, destructive, and ultimately unfucwitable blackened death in a long time\", and their follow-up album was labeled by Pitchfork as \"a weaponized hybrid of the two genres\". The band's music also features influences from bands such as Repulsion, Necrovore and early Incantation, as well as Chris Reifert's death-doom work and thrash metal genre. ==Members== ;Current members *NSK - bass, guitar, vocals (2003-) *J - drums (2005-) * Javi Bastard (Javier F\u00e9lez) - guitar (2017-) * CG Santos \u2013 effects, programming (2008-) ;Former members *Tyrant Spear Carrier of Barbaric Blood Sacrifice (Defernos) \u2013 drums (2003-2005) *Juan Carlos Deus \u2013 guitar (2003-2006) ==Discography== ;Studio albums * Seven Chalices (2009) * Death (2014) * The Baneful Choir (2019) ;EPs and splits * Proclamation / Teitanblood (2005) * Teitanblood / Necros Christos (2006) * Purging Tongues (2011) * Woven Black Arteries (2012) * Accursed Skin (2016) ;Compilations * Black Putrescence of Evil (2009) ;Demos * Genocide Chants to Apolokian Dawn (2004) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Musical groups established in 2003 Category:Spanish death metal musical groups Category:Spanish black metal musical groups Category:Blackened death metal musical groups Category:Musical groups from Madrid Category:Heavy metal duos ",
