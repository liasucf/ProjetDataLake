    "text": "The National League South, formerly Conference South (billed as The Motorama National League South for sponsorship reasons), is one of the second divisions of the National League in England, immediately below the top division National League. Along with National League North, it is at the second level of the National League System, and at the sixth tier overall of the English football league system. It was introduced in 2004 as part of a major restructuring of the National League System. The champion team each year is automatically promoted to the National League. A second promotion place goes to the winners of play-offs involving the teams finishing in second to seventh place (expanded from four to six teams in the 2017\u201318 season). The three bottom clubs are relegated to Step 3 leagues. For sponsorship reasons, it has been known as Blue Square South (2007\u20132010), Blue Square Bet South (2010\u20132013), Skrill South (2013\u20132014), the Vanarama Conference South (2014\u20132015), the Vanarama National League South (2015\u20132019) and the Motorama National League South following a three-year sponsorship deal announced in January 2019. Since the start of the 2015\u201316 season, the league is known as the National League South. The 2018\u201319 champions are Torquay United. The National League South will be reduced to 21 clubs for 2020-21https://northkentnonleague.co.uk/national-league-south-to- have-21-clubs, but will expand to 24 teams in 2021, when the bottom two clubs will be relegated and four promoted from Step 3.
