It is the second most prestigious title in the discipline after the 400 metres at the Olympics. The competition format typically has two or three qualifying rounds leading to a final between eight athletes. The championship records for the event are 43.18 seconds for men, set by Michael Johnson in 1999, and 47.99 seconds for women, set by Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 in 1983. The men's world record has been broken at the competition on one occasion and Johnson's championship record remains the world record as of 2015.IAAF World Championships: IAAF Statistics Handbook Daegu 2011, pp. 595\u20136 (archived).
