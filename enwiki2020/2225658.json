    "text": "The Committee of 100 is a leadership organization of Chinese Americans in business, government, academia and the arts whose stated aim is \"to encourage constructive relations between the peoples of the United States and Greater China.\" It was founded in 1990 by I. M. Pei. Its current chair is H. Roger Wang, chairman and former chief executive officer (CEO) of the Golden Eagle International Group and its current president is Zhengyu Huang. ==Background== The declared key functions of the committee are to serve as a bridge between the cultures and systems of China and America and also to provide a forum for those issues that Americans of Chinese descent face in bettering their lives in the United States. The Committee aims to serve as cultural ambassadors and to foster the exchange of ideas and various perspectives among its membership with those in the community and government. Committee delegations have been invited to give briefings to top officials at the White House and Zhongnanhai. The committee has been noted to avoid criticism of the Chinese Communist Party and its policies. A 2018 report by the Hoover Institution noted that Committee members have been targets of United Front Work Department pressure and influence operations. == Membership == The membership, as of October 2020, is as follows, where each name is followed by the member's date of election in parentheses: # Chi-Foon Chan, President & co-CEO of Synopsys (2010) # Ed Chan, Vice Chair of Charoen Pokphand Group (2002) # Ronnie Chan, Chair of Hang Lung Properties (1998) # Tony F.
