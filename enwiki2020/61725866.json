At that time, it was also known as Shukravari Bazar because it took place on Friday. Due to communal riots in 1914, the market was closed temporarily. The market soon found a new place near Siddi Saiyyed Mosque. After that, it shifted to the old civil court. Since 1954, the market takes place at the Sabarmati riverfront. Hence, it is also known as Riverfront market. It has been made open to the public, following a formal inauguration by Gujarat Chief Minister- Narendra Modi on February 03, 2014. In 2002, when the communal riots happened, Sabarmati River functioned as the division between two communities.
