    "text": "The Alfama () is the oldest neighborhood of Lisbon, spreading on the slope between the S\u00e3o Jorge Castle and the Tagus river. Its name comes from the Arabic Al-hamma (), meaning \"hot fountains\" or \"baths\". The district includes the freguesias (parishes) of S\u00e3o Miguel, Santo Est\u00eav\u00e3o, S\u00e3o Vicente de Fora and part of the two streets, \"Freguesia da S\u00e9: Rua do Bar\u00e3o\" and \"Rua S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pra\u00e7a\". It contains many important historical attractions, as well as an abundance of Fado bars and restaurants. == History == Chafariz d'El-Rei in Alfama, c. 1570. Lisbon tram at the Portas do Sol. The Rua do Bar\u00e3o is one of the streets of the Freguesia da S\u00e9, which begins at the Rua S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pra\u00e7a (where once stood the Door of the Alfama) and ends at Rua Augusto Rosa (at the Cathedral's walls). The toponym \"Rua do Bar\u00e3o\" is because Jo\u00e3o Fernandes da Silveira, the first Baron of Alvito, minister of Portuguese kings Dom Afonso V and Dom Jo\u00e3o II, lived here.Macedo, Luis Pastor \u00abLisboa de L\u00e9s-a- L\u00e9s\u00bb, vol. II During the times of Moorish domination, Alfama constituted the whole of the city, which later spread to the West (Baixa neighbourhood). Alfama became inhabited by the fishermen and the poor, and its condition as the neighbourhood of the poor continues to this day. The great 1755 Lisbon earthquake did not destroy the Alfama, which has remained a picturesque labyrinth of narrow streets and small squares. Lately the neighbourhood has been invigorated with the renovation of the old houses and new restaurants where Fado\u2014Portuguese typical melancholy music\u2014can be enjoyed.
