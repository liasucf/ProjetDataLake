These were Jos\u00e9 Dolores Estrada Morales, Aurelio, Irineo and himself, who were known as Los Gracos in honor to the Roman Gracchi family. His three brothers were mayors of Managua: Irineo in 1899, Jos\u00e9 Dolores in 1901, and Aurelio in 1903. The last was Generalissimo in the victory of the Battle of Namasig\u00fce in 1907.
