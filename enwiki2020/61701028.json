    "text": "Margaret Winstar planned her lover's escape from Dalkeith Palace Margaret Winstar (fl. 1590-1600), was a Danish or German courtier in Scotland to Anne of Denmark commemorated by the ballad \"The Laird o Logie\" for rescuing her imprisoned lover. Margaret Winstar's family background is unclear, although it has been suggested her family name was \"Wenckstern\" or \"Venstermand\". Robert Bowes noted that she was descended from a wealthy Danish family.Thomas Riis, Should auld acquaintance be forgot, vol. 2 (Odense 1988), pp. 296-7: CSP Scotland, vol. 10, p. 752 see TNA SP52/49 f.5. She was a favoured courtier of Anne of Denmark, whose Scottish household included ladies in waiting and servants from Denmark and the northern states of Germany. Winstar accompanied the queen went she went out riding.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) pp. 148-9 Winstar is remembered because of her relationship and marriage with John Wemyss of Logie, a servant or varlet in the bedchamber of James VI of Scotland, and the daring escape she planned for him, featured in ballads and chronicles. ==Logie's confession== In 1592, John Wemyss of Logie helped Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell who was a rebel against the king.Alan Stewart, The Cradle King (London, 2004), p. 133. He was a son of Andrew Wemyss of Myrecairnie and Logie and a cousin of David Wemyss, laird of West Wemyss whose sister Euphemia was a lady-in-waiting to the queen.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1888), pp. 62-4. Logie was probably the valet who attended the king at the wedding of Lilias Murray, the Laird of Tullibardine's daughter, and John Grant of Freuchie on 21 June 1591.Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 148: Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 135. Another of Bothwell's supporters, Josias Stewart, was the son of Margaret Stewart, Mistress of Ochiltree, a senior lady in waiting whose three daughters were maidens of honour in the queen's household. Possibly Logie and Josias Stewart were friends, and Margaret Winstar came to know Logie through this connection. Winstar was still at court, in high favour and on 13 June 1592 Anna of Denmark ordered matching orange gowns with green sleeves for her, herself, and the Scottish maiden of honour Marie Stewart.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 139: Michael Pearce, 'Anna of Denmark: Fashioning a Danish Court in Scotland', The Court Historian, 24:2 (2019) p. 148 In August the Duke of Lennox arrested Logie and Michael Balfour of Burleigh. Logie confessed to planning four different attempts to capture the king. One of these schemes involved Margaret Winstar, identified as his mistress or fianc\u00e9e. She would steal the keys to the back gate of Dalkeith Palace and let in Bothwell's men. When James interrogated him, Logie was immediately cooperative and withheld nothing. This full and unexpected confession was tantamount to his own death sentence. Logie said that many other royal servants were allies of Bothwell, in part because they had not been paid. He said that Bothwell received money from Spain but Burleigh explained this as a deliberate rumour to encourage Bothwell's supporters. The English diplomat Robert Bowes thought that James VI meant to have Logie executed, but guessed that the queen and Margaret Winstar, who was from a well-connected family and thought to be related to the queen, would intercede to save his life.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 751: Thomas Thomson ed., History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), 207. ==Escape from Dalkeith Palace== Logie was imprisoned in Dalkeith Palace. He escaped with the help of Margaret Winstar who slept in the queen's bedchamber. Winster asked the guards to bring the prisoner to the queen, and then led him through the queen's bedchamber to a window where she had left a rope (or a pair of sheets). An accomplice was waiting below with a horse.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), pp. 752-5: Calendar of Border Papers, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1894), p. 405: Thomas Thomson, History of the Kirk of Scotland by David Calderwood, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1844), pp. 173-4. The escape echoed the scheme of one of Logie's confessions. The story is the basis of the ballad, \"The Laird of Logie\" and its variant \"The Laird of Ochiltree\". The escape was highlighted in a contemporary narrative, The Historie and Life of King James the Sext. The anonymous author calls Margaret \"Twynstoun\". He draws attention to her role in the rescue as an act of charity and a good example for posterity, concluding that by \"hir gude cheritable help he happilie escapit be the subteltie of loove\".Thomas Thomson ed., The Historie and Life of King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 253-4. His narrative of the escape is quoted here with spellings modernised; > \"And because the event of this matter had such a success, it shall also be > praised by my pen, as a worthy turn, proceeding from honest, chaste love and > charity, which should in no way be obscured from posterity for a good > example. And therefore I have thought good to insert the same for a > perpetual memorial. Queen Anne, our noble Princess, was served with diverse > gentlewomen of her own country, and namely, by one called Mistress Margaret > Twynstoun, to whom this gentleman, Weymss of Logie, bore great honest > affection, tending to the godly band of marriage; the which was honestly > requited by the said gentlewoman, yea even in his greatest misfortune. For > how soon she understood the said gentleman to be in distress, and apparently > be his confession, to be punished to the death, and she having privilege to > lie in the Queen's chamber, that same very night of his accusation, where > the King was also reposing that same night, she came forth of the door > privily, both the princes (the king and queen) being then at quiet rest, and > passed to the chamber where the said gentleman was put in custody, to > certain of the guard, and commanded them that immediately he should be > brought to the King and Queen. To which they giving sure credence, obeyed. > But how soon she was come back to the chamber door, she desired the watchmen > to stay till he should come forth again, and so she closed the door, and > conveyed the gentleman to a window, where she passed a long cord to him to > convey himself down upon, and so by her good charitable help he happily > escaped by the subtlety of love.Thomas Thomson ed., The Historie and Life of > King James the Sext (Edinburgh, 1825), pp. 253-4. Logie made his getaway on a horse brought by his friend Archibald Wauchope of Niddrie.James Dennistoun, Moysie's Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland (Edinburgh, 1830), p. 95. James VI asked the queen to send Winstar back to Denmark but she refused. A newsletter sent to England reported that the queen said she would rather go back to Denmark than part with Mistress Margaret or any other domestic servants.TNA SP52/49 f.6. Instead Winstar stayed at Wemyss Castle for a while. On 9 November 1592 Anne of Denmark wrote to the Laird of Wemyss to thank him for looking after her.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 3 (Edinburgh, 1888), p. 31 and plate. Margaret Winstar was back in favour at court. On the evening of 5 August 1593 the queen sent her with letters to the departing Danish ambassadors, Niels Krag and Steen Bille.'Acta Legationis Scotica, 1593', p. 82: A journal of the Danish embassy (Latin). Rigsarkivet ==Marriage== Logie was pardoned by James VI and he was married to Margaret in October or November 1593. A charter of December 1594 names his wife as \"Margaret Weiksterne\". A chronicle states that Sir Peter Young, the king's almoner and ambassador to Denmark, had paid her dowry.William Fraser, Memorials of the family of Wemyss of Wemyss, vol. 1, pp. 178-9; vol. 3, p. 31; Annie I. Cameron, Warrender Papers, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1932), p. 53. The exact date of their wedding is unknown, the marriage contract was dated November 1593 and March 1594, for Logie to inherit the lands of Myrecairnie, Wester Cruivie, Brighouse, and Logie. James VI also planned to make the lands of Logie a barony.Acts of the Parliaments of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1817), pp. 124-5; see the register of the privy seal, National Records of Scotland PS1/67 f.62-63. Anna gave her clothes, including blue velvet night-gear, and a present of an elaborate bed with rich curtain fabrics.Jemma Field, Anna of Denmark: The Material and Visual Culture of the Stuart Courts (Manchester, 2020), p. 135. Mary, Queen of Scots had given her lady-in-waiting Mary Livingston a bed on her marriage in 1565.Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne Descosse (Edinburgh, 1863), pp. lxxxii, 31, 153. Margaret, now called \"Lady Logie\" went to Denmark (or Holstein) in June 1594 to see her family and returned to Scotland after a year in July 1595. Roger Aston heard she had been to see the queen's mother Sophie of Mecklenburg-G\u00fcstrow and brought back a message that the queen ought to obey the king in all things.Annie I. Cameron, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), nos. 346, 360, 373, 594, 636. ==Logie in Holstein and the Netherlands== Logie continued to be suspected, and in August 1594 was again implicated in Bothwell's rebellion. He was arrested on his way to Stirling Castle for the banquet for the baptism of Prince Henry. He was imprisoned at Blackness Castle then in Edinburgh Castle, and threatened with execution.David Laing, Original Letters of John Colville (Edinburgh, 1858), pp. 120, 123, 128: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1936), no. 336. Again the queen intervened for his life and he was released and went abroad. His sister, Eufame Wemyss, was banished from the household and the queen's presence.Register of the Privy Council of Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1882), p. 240. Logie wrote on 3 October 1595 to an associate of Sir Robert Cecil describing his journey from England and a meeting with an Italian at Kiel in Holstein, which may suggest that Margaret's family was in Holstein.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 29-30. He was arrested at Veere and questioned about his movements, his connections to Jesuits, and to the Earl of Essex. Logie answered that he had been travelling to see his wife in Holstein but had missed seeing her.Calendar of the Cecil Papers in Hatfield House, 1596, vol. 6 (London, 1895), 1 & 9 & 10 Dec. 1596; R. B. Wernham, List and Analysis of State Papers: January to December 1596 (London, 2000), 92, 117. He was accused of planning to capture for Spain the Gunpowder tower, the \"Kruittoren\", that overlooked the harbour at Veere. He confessed immediately when he was shown the rack. He blamed a Scottish Jesuit Dr Hamilton and two Spanish men who had approached him while he was in prison in Brussels for devising the plan.Thomas Birch, Memoirs of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth, vol. 2 (London, 1754), pp. 216-7; Emmanuel van Meteren (trans. J. D. L. Haye), Belgica, l'histoire des Pays-Bas d'Emanuel de Meteren (Amsterdam, 1670), 397v. Robert Sidney requested a stay of execution on 5 December. John Wemyss of Logie was beheaded at Middelburg on 8 January 1597 (NS).Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1952), pp. 29-30, 153, 219, 419. Logie's confession was a political embarrassment for James. However, Margaret Winster seems to have remained in Anna of Denmark's household. The exact dates of Margaret Winstar's birth and death are unknown. ==References== ==External links== * Anna of Denmark's letter to the Laird of West Wemyss thanking him for showing hospitality to Margaret Winstar, 9 November 1592. * John Slezer's seventeenth-century view of Dalkeith Palace, image from the National Library of Scotland.
