He fails the knowledge portion of the exam, but inadvertently causes a computer surge. Les' failing marks are thought to be irretrievable, but the Department of Motor Vehicles lets him pass the exam after comparing him to his twin sister's high marks. He eventually passes the road test, but his real test scores are finally retrieved and his license is revoked. Les tries concealing the truth from his parents, but his mother finds out the truth and grounds him for two weeks. Les made plans to drive his grandfather's prized 1972 Cadillac Sedan de Ville prior and decides to sneak away anyway for a joyride with Mercedes. Mercedes and Les get drunk and accidentally cave in the roof of the car after dancing on it. Mercedes passes out; Les panics and goes to his best friend Dean's (Corey Feldman) house to have him fix the dent in the car's hood. Dean persuades Les to continue the joyride along with their friend Charles (Michael Manasseri), but are unaware Les still does not have his license. The three put Mercedes in the trunk of the car and continue their night on the town, causing even more damage to the Cadillac. Meanwhile, Les' pregnant mother wakes up her husband late in the night announcing she is in labor. The next day, Les drops off Charles and Dean at their homes. Mercedes wakes up and believes that the night prior was a dream. Les drops her off at her house, where they share a kiss. Les gets in trouble with his father after returning home with the completely damaged Cadillac. Les' mother is still in labor, but the car is unable to be put in drive, so he drives his family to the hospital in reverse. Les' mother is taken into the hospital, but a crane fails outside and a falling steel girder crushes the Cadillac, much to the shock of Les and his father. The family tries to explain the state of the Cadillac to Les' grandfather, but Les' grandfather laughs it off as he reveals he has severely damaged Les' father's own car, a BMW, in an accident. Les' father gives the BMW to him and jokingly tells him to take good care of it. Although Les thanks his father, he has changed his mind and doesn't want it anymore. Mercedes pulls up in a white Volkswagen Golf Cabriolet and picks up Les, who gets in the driver's seat and drives away with her without his license. ==Cast== * Corey Haim as Les Anderson * Corey Feldman as Dean * Carol Kane as Mrs. Anderson * Richard Masur as Mr. Anderson * Heather Graham as Mercedes Lane * Michael Manasseri as Charles * Parley Baer as Grandpa * Harvey Miller as The Professor * Michael A.
