That majority was increased, however, upon the admission of two more states with Republican senators. As this election was prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 52nd Congress (1891\u20131893) * Majority Party: Republican (46) * Minority Party: Democratic (37) * Other Parties: Populist (2) * Total Seats: 85 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === After the admission of Montana's new senators in January 1890. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=8 | | | D1 | | D2 |- | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 | width=50px | D6 | width=50px | D5 | width=50px | D4 | width=50px | D3 |- | | D13 | | D14 | | D15 | | D16 | | D17 | | D18 | | D19 | | D20 | | D21 | | D22 |- ! | D32 Ran ! | D31 Ran ! | D30 Ran ! | D29 Ran ! | D28 Ran ! | D27 Ran ! | D26 Ran | | D25 | | D24 | | D23 |- ! | D33 Ran ! | D34 Ran ! | D35 Ran ! | D36 Retired ! | D37 Retired ! | R47 Retired ! | R46 Ran ! | R45 Ran ! | R44 Ran ! rowspan=2 | R43 Ran |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- ! | R33 Ran ! | R34 Ran ! | R35 Ran ! | R36 Ran ! | R37 Ran ! | R38 Ran ! | R39 Ran ! | R40 Ran ! | R41 Ran ! | R42 Ran |- ! | R32 Ran | | R31 | | R30 | | R29 | | R28 | | R27 | | R26 | | R25 | | R24 | | R23 |- | | R13 | | R14 | | R15 | | R16 | | R17 | | R18 | | R19 | | R20 | | R21 | | R22 |- | | R12 | | R11 | | R10 | | R9 | | R8 | | R7 | | R6 | | R5 | | R4 | | R3 |- | colspan=8 | | | R1 | | R2 |} === After the class 3 elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=8 | | | D1 | | D2 |- | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 | width=50px | D6 | width=50px | D5 | width=50px | D4 | width=50px | D3 |- | | D13 | | D14 | | D15 | | D16 | | D17 | | D18 | | D19 | | D20 | | D21 | | D22 |- ! | D32 Re-elected ! | D31 Re-elected ! | D30 Re-elected ! | D29 Re-elected ! | D28 Re-elected ! | D27 Re-elected ! | D26 Re-elected | | D25 | | D24 | | D23 |- ! | D33 Hold ! | D34 Hold ! | D35 Hold ! | D36 Hold ! | D37 Gain ! | D38 Gain ! | D39 Gain ! | V1 D Loss ! | I1 Gain ! | P1 Gain |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 ! | R43 New seat |- ! | R33 Re-elected ! | R34 Re-elected ! | R35 Re-elected ! | R36 Re-elected ! | R37 Re-elected ! | R38 Re-elected ! | R39 Re-elected ! | R40 Re-elected ! | R41 Hold ! | R42 Hold |- ! | R32 Re-elected | | R31 | | R30 | | R29 | | R28 | | R27 | | R26 | | R25 | | R24 | | R23 |- | | R13 | | R14 | | R15 | | R16 | | R17 | | R18 | | R19 | | R20 | | R21 | | R22 |- | | R12 | | R11 | | R10 | | R9 | | R8 | | R7 | | R6 | | R5 | | R4 | | R3 |- | colspan=8 | | | R1 | | R2 |} === Beginning of the next Congress === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | colspan=6 | | | D1 | | D2 | | D3 | | D4 |- | width=50px | D14 | width=50px | D13 | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D8 | width=50px | D7 | width=50px | D6 | width=50px | D5 |- | | D15 | | D16 | | D17 | | D18 | | D19 | | D20 | | D21 | | D22 | | D23 | | D24 |- | | D34 | | D33 | | D32 | | D31 | | D30 | | D29 | | D28 | | D27 | | D26 | | D25 |- | | D35 | | D36 ! | V1 D seated late ! | V2 D elected late ! | V3 D died Later D | | I1 Later P | | P1 ! | V3 D died Later R ! | R46 New seat ! rowspan=2 | R45 New seat |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 |- | | R35 | | R36 | | R37 | | R38 | | R39 | | R40 | | R41 | | R42 | | R43 ! | R44 New seat |- | | R34 | | R33 | | R32 | | R31 | | R30 | | R29 | | R28 | | R27 | | R26 | | R25 |- | | R15 | | R16 | | R17 | | R18 | | R19 | | R20 | | R21 | | R22 | | R23 | | R24 |- | | R14 | | R13 | | R12 | | R11 | | R10 | | R9 | | R8 | | R7 | | R6 | | R5 |- | colspan=6 | | | R1 | | R2 | | R3 | | R4 |} {| |- valign=top !

In November, Fred Dubois helped engineer a plan for the Idaho Legislature to effectively elect three people to the U.S. Senate: Governor George Shoup to the class 2 seat up for election in 1894, state constitutional convention member William J. McConnell to serve for the remainder of the Fifty-first United States Congress, ending in March 1891, and Dubois himself to succeed McConnell and serve a full six- year term in the class 3 seat beginning in March 1891. == New York == Senator David B. Hill The New York election was held January 20 and 21, 1891, by the New York State Legislature. Republican William M. Evarts had been elected to this seat in 1885, and his term would expire on March 3, 1891. At the State election in November 1889, 19 Republicans and 13 Democrats were elected for a two-year term (1890-1891) in the State Senate. At the State election in November 1890, 68 Democrats and 60 Republicans were elected for the session of 1891 to the Assembly. The 114th New York State Legislature met from January 6 to April 30, 1891, at Albany, New York. The Democratic caucus met on January 19, 74 State legislators attended, and State Senator John C. Jacobs presided. Governor David B. Hill was nominated by acclamation. The Republican caucus met immediately after the Democratic caucus ended, Assemblyman James W. Husted presided. They re-nominated the incumbent U.S. Senator William M. Evarts unanimously. On January 20, both Houses of the State legislature took ballots separately. The incumbent U.S. Senator Evarts was the choice of the State Senate, Governor Hill the choice of the Assembly. On January 21, both Houses met in joint session, and comparing nominations, found that they disagreed and proceeded to a joint ballot. Governor Hill was elected by a majority of 2, every member of the Legislature being present. {| class=wikitable !

Hill remained in office as Governor of New York until December 31, 1891, and took his seat only on January 7, 1892, missing actually only one month of session. There were no special sessions during the 52nd United States Congress and the regular session began only on December 7, 1891. Hill served a single term, and remained in the U.S. Senate until March 3, 1897. In January 1897, Hill was defeated for re-election by Republican Thomas C. Platt who had been a U.S. Senator briefly in 1881. == Pennsylvania == Senator J. Donald Cameron The Pennsylvania election was held on January 20, 1891. J. Donald Cameron was re- elected by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to the United States Senate. The Pennsylvania General Assembly, consisting of the House of Representatives and the Senate, convened on January 20, 1891. Incumbent Republican J. Donald Cameron, who was elected in an 1877 special election and re-elected in 1879 and 1885, was a successful candidate for re-election to another term.
