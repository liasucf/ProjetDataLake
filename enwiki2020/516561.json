    "text": "Furnifold McLendel Simmons (January 20, 1854April 30, 1940) was a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from March 4, 1887 to March 4, 1889 and U.S. senator from the state of North Carolina between March 4, 1901 and March 4, 1931. He served as chairman of the powerful Committee on Finance from March 4, 1913 to March 4, 1919. He was an unsuccessful contender for the 1920 Democratic Party nomination for president. Simmons was a staunch segregationist, white supremacist and a leading perpetrator of the Wilmington insurrection of 1898. ==Life and career== Simmons was born in Pollocksville, North Carolina, the son of Mary McLendel (Jerman) and Furnifold Greene Simmons.https://www.ncpedia.org/biography/simmons-furnifold After Republicans won control of North Carolina legislature in 1894, Simmons led efforts to disenfranchise black voters and return Democrats to power across the state. He allied with white supremacist newspapers to stoke fears of black men as predators of white women and too incompetent to be trusted as office holders or voters. Simmons also set up hundreds of \"White Government Unions,\" which aimed to \"announce on all occasions that they would succeed if they had to shoot every negro in the city.\" As a result, Democrats swept the 1898 election, and the Wilmington Insurrection of 1898 broke out the following day. In 1901 Simmons won the Democratic nomination for the US Senate. From his Senate seat, he then ran a powerful political machine, using A. D. Watts \"to keep the machine oiled back home,\" in the words of one journalist.News & Observer: \"What the obituary didn't say\" by Rob Christensen Simmons remained in office for the next thirty years. Senator Simmons refused to endorse Al Smith, the Democratic nominee for president in 1928 and the first Catholic nominated by a major party, winning him praise from members of the Ku Klux Klan. Still, rejecting the Democratic nominee in 1928, together with the Great Depression, led to Simmons being defeated in the 1930 Democratic primary by Josiah W. Bailey, who was backed by Governor O. Max Gardner. ==References== ==External links== *North Carolina History Project *North Carolina Election of 1898 *Furnifold McLendel Simmons entry at The Political Graveyard * Category:1854 births Category:1940 deaths Category:American proslavery activists Category:Democratic Party United States senators Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina Category:North Carolina Democratic Party chairs Category:North Carolina Democrats Category:Candidates in the 1920 United States presidential election Category:20th-century American politicians Category:United States senators from North Carolina Category:Wake Forest University alumni Category:Politicians from New Bern, North Carolina Category:Democratic Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:Activists from North Carolina Category:Wilmington insurrection of 1898 Category:People from Jones County, North Carolina Category:American white supremacist politicians ",
