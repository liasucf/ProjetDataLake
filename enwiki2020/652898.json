Later, on August 19, he was finally allowed to return to the United States. Reminded of his experience with the June 4, Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 for freedom of speech and democracy, Yang's recent article in the Washington Post shortly after his return to United States reflects his vivid observation of the 2007 Burmese anti-government protests, spiritually coined as Saffron Revolution, including China's 'parasitic relationship with Burma' and the genuine will of freedom loving intellectuals around the world condemning the current brutal oppressions in Burma.Echoes of Tiananmen Square Yang Jianli's article in the Washington Post, September 30, 2007 In March 2016, together with Fang Zheng and Zhou Fengsuo, Yang published an op-ed in the Washington Post protesting Donald Trump's characterization of the Tiananmen Square Massacre as the act of a \"strong, powerful government\". He has been a guest speaker at the Geneva Summit for Human Rights and Democracy on several occasions, and is founder of the NGO, Initiatives for China, a US-based organisation dedicated to working for a peaceful transition to democracy in China. He also established the Foundation for China in the 21st Century.http://www.initiativesforchina.org/?page_id=51 During 2016, he has organised an Interfaith Conference of China's ethnic and religious minorities in Dharamshala, India, which is home to the Dalai Lama's residence and the headquarters of Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan government in exile).

In June 2016, Yang organised an event in Washington D.C. to commemorate the 27th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square crackdown in China. Its technical systems were hacked, so that some participants in other countries could not fully communicate. In March 2018, Yang was invited to speak by advocacy group UN Watch in the UN Human Rights Council but Chinese diplomat Chen Cheng repeatedly interrupted in a failed attempt to halt the address. There, questioned the Chinese Communist Party's right to represent China at the UN body as well as the country's human rights abuses. ==See also== *Chinese democracy movement *List of Chinese dissidents *Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 == References == ==External links== *Yang Jianli Website *Freedom-Now *Foundation for China in the 21st Century *IFEX *China-theDocumentary.com features a short video of Yang Jianli Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Chinese dissidents Category:Chinese exiles Category:Chinese human rights activists Category:Harvard University alumni Category:People from Linyi Category:University of California, Berkeley alumni Category:Charter 08 signatories ",
