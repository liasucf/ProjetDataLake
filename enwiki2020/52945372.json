    "text": "The 2017 Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens football team represented the University of Delaware in the 2017 NCAA Division I FCS football season. They played their home games at Delaware Stadium in Newark, Delaware. They were members of the Colonial Athletic Association (CAA). They were led by first-year head coach Danny Rocco, who previously coached at CAA-rival Richmond. They finished the season 7\u20134, 5\u20133 in CAA play to finish in a tie for fourth place. ==Previous season== The Hens would start the season with two consecutive wins, against Delaware State and at Lafayette. They followed with a five-game losing streak, the longest by Delaware since 1939, which cost head coach Dave Brock his job. He was replaced by Dennis Dottin-Carter on an interim basis, and the Hens finished with a record of 4\u20137 (2\u20136 CAA). ==Coaching staff== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name !! Position !! Year !!
