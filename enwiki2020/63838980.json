January 31, 1797 ==Manifesto== Twenty volumes of the coats of arms include 3,066 inheritable arms and several personal emblems. ==Parts of the General Armorial== Five parts of the General Armorial were approved by Emperor Paul I: *The first part \u2013 January 1, 1798 (150 emblems); *The second part \u2013 June 30, 1798 (150 emblems); *The third part \u2013 January 19, 1799 (150 emblems); *The fourth part \u2013 December 7, 1799 (150 emblems); *The fifth part \u2013 October 22, 1800 (150 emblems). Emperor Alexander I approved: *The sixth part \u2013 June 23, 1801 (160 emblems); *The seventh part \u2013 October 4, 1803 (180 emblems); *The eighth part \u2013 January 25, 1807 (160 emblems); *The ninth part \u2013 August 5, 1816 (160 emblems). The tenth part was approved almost twenty years later, on January 3, 1836 by Nicholas I (152 emblems). The first four parts of the General Armorial were printed in Saint Petersburg in 1803\u20131809. Parts five through ten were published in 1836\u20131840 in the amount of 600 copies. The arms were engraved in black and white. A few years ago, a facsimile reprint of the first three parts of the General Armorial was undertaken from the publication of 1803\u20131809. The following ten parts have not been published and exist in a single copy. Emperor Alexander II approved the eleventh part \u2013 April 13, 1857 (153 emblems). Emperor Alexander III approved: *The twelfth part \u2013 May 23, 1882 (152 coats of arms); *The thirteenth part \u2013 January 19, 1885 (186 emblems); *The fourteenth part \u2013 April 11, 1890 (170 emblems). Emperor Nicholas II approved: *The fifteenth part \u2013 March 29, 1895 (143 emblems); *The sixteenth part \u2013 February 14, 1901 (140 emblems); *The seventeenth part \u2013 January 14, 1904 (140 emblems); *The eighteenth part \u2013 January 9, 1908 (143 emblems); *The nineteenth part \u2013 June 12, 1914 (142 emblems); *The twentieth part \u2013 February 3, 1917 (135 emblems). A collection of 61 emblems approved by the Governing Senate from June 1 to November 22, 1917 is called the twenty-first part of the General Armorial. ==Armorial decorations== The Armorial was supposed to emphasize the importance of entering the emblems of noble families on its pages. It was a highly solemn act of legalization of the emblem of the clan or face. Significance was enhanced by the personal signature of emperors in the approval of each coat of arms. Therefore, the volumes of the General Armorial should look as impressive as possible in order to emphasize this significance. For all volumes in the design is characterized by the use of the state coat of arms \u2013 a two-headed eagle. The appearance of the originals of the first 10 parts of the General Armorial is as follows: each volume (size 40x25 cm) is bound in dark raspberry velvet (the successor to the Velvet Book), the images of a state eagle are embroidered on the outside of the binding, a silver meander coils along the blue field of the frontispiece enclosed in a frame. On this sheet, an entry is made about the approval of the corresponding part of the Armorial. This is followed by coats of arms, drawn on parchment sheets arranged with green taffeta and the text is placed under the coat of arms. Over time, the appearance of the General Armorial has changed. So, the 11th part looked different than the first 10 parts. The image of the state emblem was embroidered on the top cover, the spine was embroidered with gold and silk. From the 12th part, the sheets are transferred with translucent paper, and in the following parts the parchment is replaced with thick Bristol paper. All volumes are stored in case-boxes, covered in black leather with handles, for convenience and safety during transportation. Volume 21 of the General Armorial part was bound in 1919, and at the same time a case was made for it. This last volume is a red velvet book depicting the coat of arms of the period of the Provisional Government. The sheets of the General Stamp of the 21st part are arranged with taffeta.Compiled by Igor Borisov.
