This new style of printing press could print up to 1,100 sheets per hourLyons, M. (2011). Books : a living history. Los Angeles : J. Paul Getty Museum, c2011., printing on both sides of the paper at the same time. He moved to London in 1804 and in 1810 was granted a patent on his press, which produced its first trial run in April 1812.Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1998. (pp 130\u2013133) The machine was set up in their workshop, and invitations sent out to potential customers, notably John Walter of The Times. Amidst much secrecy, for fear of upsetting the existing pressmen, trials were carried out with great success. The first issue of The Times printed with the new presses was published on 29 November 1814. In August 1817 Koenig returned to Germany because of a disagreement with Thomas Bensley, a London book printer partner, who Koenig believed sought sole rights to the new machine. After consideration he chose an abandoned monastery in W\u00fcrzburg for the premises of the factory. The firm was called Koenig & Bauer. ==References== == Sources == * * == External links == *Koenig's press *History of Koenig & Bauer Category:1774 births Category:1833 deaths Category:German inventors Category:German printers Category:People from Eisleben ",
