    "text": "The Lecithoceridae, or long-horned moths, are a family of small moths described by Simon Le Marchand in 1947. Although lecithocerids are found throughout the world, the great majority are found in the Indomalayan realm and the southern part of the Palaearctic realm. ==Systematics== The Lecithoceridae belong to the superfamily Gelechioidea, and comprises over 100 genera and nearly 900 species. The family is divided into these subfamilies: *Lecithocerinae *Torodorinae Gozm\u00e1ny in Amsel et al., 1978 *Ceuthomadarinae Gozm\u00e1ny, 1978 Park (2015) recently proposed another subfamily Crocanthinae, mainly based on Crocanthes Meyrick. The new subfamily include Crocanthes Meyrick, Aprosesta Turner, st. rev. (which is resurrected as a valid genus), Lamprista Park, Pacificulla Park, Hannara Park, and Gonaepa Walker. ==Unplaced to subfamily== *Crocanthes group **Crocanthes Meyrick, 1886 **Cophomantella T.
