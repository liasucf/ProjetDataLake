The album reached No. 26 on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. Love also appears on the song titled \"United\" from Inner City's third album, Praise. Love was featured on the LA Reid & Babyface remix of Whitney Houston's R&B; hit \"My Name Is Not Susan\" in 1991, and appeared in the music video alongside Houston. Love's 1992 single \"Full-Term Love\", from the Class Act movie soundtrack, reached No. 7 on the Hot Hip-Hop Singles chart. Love collaborated with Marley Marl on her second album, In a Word or 2 (1993), which featured the Prince-produced single \"Born To B.R.E.E.D.\" (which reached No. 1 on the Hot Dance Music chart and No. 7 on the Hot Rap Singles chart), as well as a re-release of \"Full-Term Love\".
