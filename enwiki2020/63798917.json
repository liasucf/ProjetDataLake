    "text": "Eden Walk is an open precinct shopping centre in Kingston upon Thames, Greater London, England. It opened in 1968, predating The Bentall Centre by two decades. ==History== The construction of Eden Walk was the basis for today's major retail centre of Kingston upon Thames, which has since turned into a major shopping destination for south-west London and parts of Surrey. Construction started in 1964 and was completed by 1968, along with a multi- storey car park above; it was then extended from 1977 to 1979. The centre was refurbished in 2010. In 2017, the owners Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) and British Land were green-lit to regenerate the area and its vicinity for \u00a3400 million. The plans include a boutique cinema and 385 apartments. ==Stores== Eden Walk has over 20 retailers. As of 2015 it is anchored by Marks & Spencer which fronts into Clarence Street, and Primark which sits on Eden Street to the east of the shopping centre. Other stores include Boots, H&M;, Claire's and Jigsaw. ==References== Category:Shopping centres in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Category:Shopping malls established in 1968 ",
