He lost the belt in his first defense to David Griman by decision (scoring of judges) in 1994. He later challenged Saen Sor Ploenchit, Alimi Goitia, and Yokthai Sithoar for their respective belts but lost each fight. He is the only word champion in history to retire with an even record. Some sources report his record as 13-14-3 which would make him 1 of only 3 world champions to retire with a losing record along with Jimmy Reagan and Francisco Quiroz. == See also == * List of flyweight boxing champions * List of Venezuelans ==References== == External links == * Category:People from Anzo\u00e1tegui Category:1965 births Category:Living people Category:Flyweight boxers Category:World flyweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:Venezuelan male boxers ",
