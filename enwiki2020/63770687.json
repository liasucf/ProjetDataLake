Hansen, is a Danish former football referee and linesman, who officiated in the Danish top- flight, second-tier and third-tier including lower ranking leagues in the 1950s and 1960s and in both European and UEFA sanctioned club tournaments. From 1962 until 1969, he was a full international for FIFA, and officiated international friendlies and competitive games at senior, secondary 'B' team and under-19 level. == Career == Born in Slagelse, Hansen became affiliated with the Zealand FA (SBU) and the regional referee organisation, Sj\u00e6llands Fodbolddommer-Union (SFU), as a referee, originally officiating lower ranking league matches at a regional level for the football association organising football on Zealand. He eventually moved up to a national level under the auspices of the Danish FA, supervising numerous top-tier Danish league games including cup matches in the 1950s and 1960s in a role as linesman and referee. He started officiating third-tier league matches sometime in the early 1950s, before moving up to second-tier and top-flight league games. Carl W.
