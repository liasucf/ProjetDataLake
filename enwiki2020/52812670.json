Medoff earned a full Trinity Scholarship to attend Duke University, where she studied pre- medicine and dance and volunteered with the student-run Emergency Medical Services group. After taking a course on Broadway productions taught by producer Emanuel Azenberg, Medoff changed her major to English with the hopes of becoming a Broadway producer.
