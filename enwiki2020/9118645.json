They began playing mostly heavy metal venues, but soon began performing with Treepeople.

After signing to Up Records, Caustic Resin subsequently released Fly Me to the Moon in 1995. Produced by Phil Ek, the album was a departure from earlier metal-influenced work and a transition to alternative and space rock. Caustic Resin released The Medicine Is All Gone, their first album on Alias Records. They released Trick Question in 1999, which featured bassist Mike Johnson of Dinosaur Jr. and Joe Plummer. The band released The Afterbirth in 2000, their last album for Alias before returning to Up Records. In the meantime, Netson played and toured with Built to Spill. Finally, in 2003, Caustic Resin returned with Keep on Truckin, which featured original drummer Pat Perkins and split bass duties between Romich and Johnson. Caustic Resin has been on indefinite hiatus since 2003, though they appeared at Treefort Music Fest in 2014.History of Boise Rock Event Listing Since the band's indefinite hiatus, Netson became a member of Earth, and toured with Boris in 2016.
