    "text": "Progress MS-13 (), Russian production No. 443, identified by NASA as Progress 74P, is a Progress spacecraft launched by Roscosmos to resupply the International Space Station. This is the 165th flight of a Progress spacecraft. == History == The Progress-MS is a uncrewed freighter based on the Progress-M featuring improved avionics. This improved variant first launched on 21 December 2015. It has the following improvements: * New external compartment that enables it to deploy satellites. Each compartment can hold up to four launch containers. First time installed on Progress MS-03. * Enhanced redundancy thanks to the addition of a backup system of electrical motors for the docking and sealing mechanism. * Improved Micrometeoroid (MMOD) protection with additional panels in the cargo compartment. * Luch Russian relay satellites link capabilities enable telemetry and control even when not in direct view of ground radio stations. * GNSS autonomous navigation enables real time determination of the status vector and orbital parameters dispensing with the need of ground station orbit determination. * Real time relative navigation thanks to direct radio data exchange capabilities with the space station. * New digital radio that enables enhanced TV camera view for the docking operations. * The Ukrainian Chezara Kvant-V on board radio system and antenna/feeder system has been replaced with a Unified Command Telemetry System (UCTS). * Replacement of the Kurs A with Kurs NA digital system. == Pre-launch == In 2014, the launch was originally scheduled for 16 October 2018, but in September 2019, it was rescheduled to 20 December 2019. This was then moved ahead to 6 December 2019. == Launch == Progress MS-13 was launched on 6 December 2019 at 09:34:11 UTC from Baikonur Cosmodrome, since the Site 31/6. == Docking == To avoid docking with the ISS at the same time as SpaceX CRS-19, Progress MS-13 followed a slow three-day rendezvous trajectory rather than the fast-track three hour trajectory used on Progress MS-12. Progress MS-13 docked with the Pirs module at 10:38 UTC on 9 December 2019. == Cargo == The Progress MS-13 spacecraft delivered 2480 kg of cargo, with 1350 kg being pressurized and 1130 kg being unpressurized. The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Hardware for onboard systems: * Medical supplies: * Personal protective gear: * Sanitary and hygiene items: * Repairs and servicing equipment: * Food: * Means of crew support: * Other payloads: * NASA cargo: == Mission == On 3 July 2020 at 15:53 UTC, Progress MS-13 fired its engines to raise the International Space Station orbit 1 km for debris collision avoidance (COLA). This was the first COLA burn for International Space Station since 2015. The debris object 27923 (1987-079AG) was predicted to pass within 1 km of the station at 18:28 UTC on 3 July 2020 over the South Atlantic. The object was one of 42 cataloged from the 1996 breakup of a motor from Proton launcher in September 1987 that put three Glonass satellites in orbit. == Undocking and decay == According to Roskosmos, the vehicle undocked from the International Space Station on 8 July 2020, at 18:22 UTC. The Russian mission control commanded Progress MS-13 to fire its propulsion system on 8 July 2020, at 21:31 UTC. The maneuver resulted in the reentry of the spacecraft over a region of the Pacific Ocean at 22:05 on 8 July. Eight minutes later, any surviving debris of the spacecraft were projected to hit the surface of the ocean, around 1800 km east of New Zealand. The departure of Progress MS-13 freed the docking port Pirs for the arrival of the fresh Progress MS-15 cargo ship; Progress MS-15 launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome on 23 July 2020. == See also == * Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station == References == Category:Progress (spacecraft) missions Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019 Category:2019 in Russia Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft launched by Soyuz-2 rockets Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2020 ",
