According to the plan, the units of the 95th Air Assault Brigade, 30th Mechanized Brigade, 51st Mechanized Brigade, 25th Airborne were to occupy Savur Mohil, Stepanivka, Marinovka, to establish control over the ferries on the Mius River and to relieve the units of the 24th and 72nd Mechanized, and 79th Air Assault Brigades. The main strike for of the operation was the 400 paratroopers of the 95th Air Assault brigade and tanks of the 30th Mechanized Brigade. All taking part in the operation were volunteers. ==Results== According to official information, the paratroopers carried out a 470-kilometer raid on the rear of the separatists, and at the same time destroyed three hostile checkpoints. However, the most important achievement was the creation of a corridor for units trapped at the border to retreat. Thanks to the skillful actions of paratroopers and infantrymen, 3,000 people and more than 250 pieces of equipment were able to be evacuated safelyhttp://www.mil.gov.ua/content/other/anliz_rf.pdf. ==Significance== The raid is noteworthy because of its length and the fact that it was the first time Ukrainian and Russian forces clashed in the War in Donbass. According to Phillip Karber, it was one of the longest raids in the military history. The raid was also a significant morale booster for the Ukrainian Armed Forces, especially the Air Assault forces.
