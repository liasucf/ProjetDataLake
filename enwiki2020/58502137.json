In 1916, he became a member of the Literary Commission of Shkod\u00ebr, which established the first standard form of the Albanian language. == Early life == Pekmezi was born in Tushemisht, Pogradec (modern day Albania). He began his initial studies in Ohrid and Monastir, moving on to Belgrade from 1890\u20131894. He later graduated from the University of Vienna in philosophy and philology in 1898. After his graduation, Pekmezi returned to Albania. == Career == In 1903, Pekmezi was elected to direct the Albanian language cathedra at the Oriental University of Vienna. He founded the cultural-patriotic society Dija (Knowledge) in 1904 with Hile Mosi, Kol\u00eb Rrota and other Albanian intellectuals. In the late Ottoman period, Austria-Hungary subsidized two of Pekmezi's works: Albanesische Bibliographie and Albanianische Grammatik. During the autumn of 1913, Pekmezi worked for the border commission in southern Albania and in March 1914 was appointed dragoman (interpreter/secretary) at the new Austro\u2013Hungarian mission in Durr\u00ebs. In 1916, he was a leading member of the Albanian Literary Commission in Shkod\u00ebr under the auspices of Austro\u2013Hungary. In April 1917 he accompanied and facilitated the delegation of Albanian chieftains and leaders who visited Vienna and met with the Imperial authorities with an invitation by Ignaz Freiherr Trollmann. From 1920 to 1924 and 1926 to 1928, he served as Albanian consul in Austria. In 1924 he published a new edition of Thimi Mitko's Bleta Shqip\u00ebtare using the modern Albanian alphabet. Pekmezi's work became at that time the best-known edition of Bleta Shqip\u00ebtare. From 1928 until his death, he taught Albanian at the University of Vienna.
