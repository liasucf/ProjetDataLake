Groundbreaking occurred on April 19, 2013, with the dedication ceremony held on September 19, 2014. The 151-foot tower was planned to be the main campus's centerpiece. A water fountain, a garden, and decorative landscaping have been added at the tower's base. ==Summer Carillon Concert Series== Beginning in 2015, Oakland University established the tradition of carillon recitals occurring on six Fridays during the summer. The inaugural series included recitals by Olesya Rostovskaya, among others. ==References== Category:Oakland University campus Category:Auburn Hills, Michigan Category:Carillon towers in the United States Category:Towers in Michigan ",
