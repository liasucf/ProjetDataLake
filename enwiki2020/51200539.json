Provincial Parks== This list includes provincial parks that were cancelled. Provincial parks that were cancelled for the purpose of moving the land into a different provincial park are not included. While some provincial parks were deleted as they were deemed to be not suitable for park purposes, most of the parks were deleted so they could be transferred to a municipality or regional district to be local or regional parks. In 2004 several provincial parks were moved into the federal Gulf Islands National Park; likewise a few provincial parks were moved into the Pacific Rim National Park and Gwaii Haanas National Park when those federal parks were established. {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
