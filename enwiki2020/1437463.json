    "text": "Thiolysis is a reaction with a thiol (R-SH) that cleaves one compound into two. This reaction is similar to hydrolysis, which involves water instead of a thiol. This reaction is seen in \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids. The depolymerisation of condensed tannins with the use of benzyl mercaptan as nucleophile is also called thiolysis.
