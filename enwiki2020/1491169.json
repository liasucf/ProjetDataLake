    "text": "The Attorney General of Ontario's main office (McMurtry-Scott Building) in downtown Toronto The Attorney General of Ontario () is the chief legal adviser to Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario and, by extension, the Government of Ontario. The Attorney General is a senior member of the Executive Council of Ontario (the cabinet) and oversees the Ministry of the Attorney General \u2013 the department responsible for the oversight of the justice system in the province of Ontario. The Attorney General is an elected Member of Provincial Parliament who is appointed by the Lieutenant Governor of Ontario on the constitutional advice of the Premier of Ontario. The goal of the Ministry of the Attorney General is to provide a fair and accessible justice system which reflects the needs of the diverse communities it serves across government and the province. The Ministry represents the largest justice system in Canada and one of the largest in North America. It strives to manage the justice system in an equitable, affordable and accessible way throughout the province. Doug Downey was appointed Attorney General of Ontario on 20 June 2019, replacing Caroline Mulroney. Lindsey Park is Parliamentary Assistant to the Attorney General. == Authority == The Attorney General has the authority to represent the provincial government in court personally, but this task is almost always delegated to crown attorneys, or to crown counsel in civil cases. Ian Scott, who was a prominent courtroom lawyer prior to entering politics, chose to plead the crown's case in court for several cases related to constitutional law. Most holders of the office have been practicing lawyers or had legal training. Marion Boyd was the only Attorney General who was not a lawyer until Caroline Mulroney's appointment. Although Mulroney studied and practiced law in the United States, she is not legally able to practice law in Canada. == Responsibilities == The Ministry of the Attorney General delivers and administers a wide range of justice services, including: #administering approximately 115 statutes; #conducting criminal proceedings throughout Ontario; #providing legal advice to, and conducting litigation on behalf of, all government ministries and many agencies, boards and tribunals; #providing advice on, and drafting, all legislation and regulations; and #coordinating and administering court services throughout Ontario. The Ontario Crown Attorney's Office, the Office of the Public Guardian and Trustee, the Children's Lawyer (formerly called the Official Guardian), and the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) all fall within the Ministry's responsibilities. The Ministry also funds Legal Aid Ontario, which is administered by an independent board. ==Portfolios== In 2008, Office of the Independent Police Review Director (IPRD) was established under the authority of the AG, as a civilian body with powers invested through Public Inquiries Act to investigate complaints about municipal police forces and the Ontario Provincial Police. Following the 2013 release of former Supreme Court judge Frank Iacobucci's report on the relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Ontario justice system, a position of deputy attorney general with responsibility for Aboriginal issues was created. == List of Attorneys-General == ===Attorneys- General of Upper Canada=== 1\\.
