The Silvercorp website described Goudreau as a \u201chighly decorated Special Forces Iraq and Afghanistan veteran.\u201c Goudreau previously served in the Canadian Armed Forces and the U.S. Army Special Forces. ==Early life== Goudreau was raised in a middle-class family on the outskirts of Calgary, Alberta. Childhood friends said he was competitive, enjoyed playing video games and watched kung fu films. Goudreau's father stated that he had \" a family full of military people,\" which included Goudreau's grandfather and great-grandfather. He later attended the University of Calgary from 1994 to 1998 where he studied computer science. == Military career == After finishing college, Goudreau served in the Canadian Armed Forces, but desired to enlist in the United States armed forces as he was seeking a more challenging military career. He moved to Washington, D.C. and enlisted in the United States Army a few months prior to the September 11 attacks in New York City, eventually reaching the rank of Sergeant first class in the 10th Special Forces Group. Documentation shows that Goudreau faced months of combat while deployed and suffered a concussion and back injuries during a parachuting accident in August 2014. Following this incident, he was granted medical retirement in 2016, receiving disability payments after discharging from the military. Following his retirement, Goudreau became a naturalized United States citizen. == Silvercorp USA == After Puerto Rico was affected by Hurricane Maria in September 2017, Goudreau served as a security contractor and saw the financial benefits of being in the industry. He founded a private security-services company called Silvercorp USA in February 2018. === School safety === Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting that month, he presented a concept of placing undercover special forces veterans in schools at a Florida school security conference in July 2018. At the convention, Goudreau proposed that parents personally pay $8.99 per month for the service, comparing it to a Netflix subscription. When asked why he preferred personal payments, he said that it was to avoid the \"chain of command\" at schools and \"We want private money, because it's faster.\" In April 2018, Goudreau began working with schools in Cartagena, Colombia to teach safety classes for students. === Security services for a Trump rally === Silvercorp USA provided security services to a rally for President of the United States Donald Trump at least once. At a Trump rally in Charlotte, North Carolina at Bojangles' Coliseum on 26 October 2018, Goudreau could be seen providing security services at the event. Through connections within the private security community, Goudreau was acquainted with Keith Schiller, President Trump's longtime director of security. === Venezuela === In February 2019, Silvercorp provided security services at Venezuela Aid Live, resulting in Goudreau turning his attention to Venezuela. According to Drew White, a former business associate of Silvercorp, Goudreau saw an opportunity to overthrow Maduro when the Trump administration focused on removing Maduro from power. Goudreau eventually met with officials of Venezuela's interim president Juan Guaid\u00f3 in October and November 2019 where they made an initial agreement on plans for an armed operation in Venezuela to capture Maduro, but the two parties allegedly separated after disagreements. On 3 May 2020, Goudreau released a video alongside former Venezuelan National Guard (GNB) officer Javier Nieto Quintero, claiming responsibility for an armed incursion into Venezuelan territory by \"land and sea\", which he said was called \"Operation Gideon\", which involved 60 troops, including two former United States Army Special Forces members. Goudreau said he sought the backing of the U.S. government for his operation but claims he was unsuccessful. The Venezuelan government said security forces had foiled a \"marine incursion\" by \"terrorist mercenaries\" from neighboring Colombia in Vargas state, killing eight people and capturing two others. State television showed images of captured weapons, Peruvian documents, and uniforms emblazoned with an American flag.Venezuelan government says it stopped \u2018invasion\u2019 launched from Colombia The Washington PostBoat attack on Venezuela port foiled The Canberra Times Goudreau and Javier Nieto Quintero, identified as a retired captain of the Venezuelan military, published a video on the same day claiming responsibility for the attack.

Goudreau claimed that Guaid\u00f3 and two political advisers had signed a contract with him for $213 million in October 2019. On 8 May 2020, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab requested the extradition of Goudreau from the United States, along with two Venezuelan opposition politicians, Juan Jos\u00e9 Rendon and exiled lawmaker Sergio Vergara, for the \"design, financing, and execution\" of the plan to overthrow Maduro. == Awards and decorations == Sergeant first class Goudreau's decorations, medals and badges include: {| |colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;|140px |- |colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;|140px |- |colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center;|125px |- |125px |125px |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Badge | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Combat Infantryman Badge |- !Badge | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Parachutist Badge |- !1st row | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Bronze Star Medal x 3 |- !Tabs | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:center;\"|Special Forces Tab and Ranger tab |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Silvercorp USA Category:1976 births Category:People of the Crisis in Venezuela Category:United States Army personnel Category:Private military contractors Category:Living people Category:Canadian emigrants to the United States Category:University of Calgary alumni Category:Naturalized citizens of the United States Category:American mercenaries Category:Canadian mercenaries Category:Canadian Army personnel Category:People from Calgary Region Category:People from Melbourne, Florida Category:Fugitives wanted by Venezuela ",
