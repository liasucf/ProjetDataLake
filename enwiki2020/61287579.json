The original model, the Cleveland Model, was developed in Cleveland, United States, however the Cleveland Model has also been developed and applied with the creation of the \"Preston Model\", in Preston, Lancashire. It is a form of municipal socialism which utilises anchor institutions, living wage expansion, community banking, public pension investment, worker ownership and municipal enterprise tied to a procurement strategy at the municipal level. ==Preston model== The Preston Model is an approach to community wealth building pioneered by Preston City Council, Lancashire, England. It is a form of municipal socialism which utilises anchor institutions, living wage expansion, community banking, public pension investment, worker ownership and municipal enterprise tied to a procurement strategy at the municipal level. It has in turn built on the experience of the Cleveland Model, developed in Cleveland, Ohio. Councillor Matt Brown, originally Executive Member for Social Justice, Inclusion and Policy, played a key role in developing the model with his colleague Councillor Martyn Rawlinson, working in conjunction with the Centre for Local Economic Strategies. The first issue they tackled in 2012-2013 was to localise their procurement spend in Preston and the surrounding county of Lancashire. ==See also== * Community-supported_agriculture * Using smartphone for calculating food miles * Local food ==References== ==External links== * FarmShare: Blockchain Community-Supported Agriculture Category:Political terminology Category:Politics of Lancashire ",
