Investments totaling greater than 500 million euros from the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development were agreed upon by the participants. The talks of Germany and the EU funding infrastructure and rebuilding less-developed areas in the region has been compared to The Marshall Plan, being dubbed The Balkan Marshall Plan. ===Connectivity=== Infrastructure is slated to be harmonized and built with EU regulations within the region, alongside repairs and updates to existing infrastructure. ===Regional Economic Integration=== The foundations for a common Balkan market were agreed upon.
