    "text": "Ivan Turina (3 October 1980 \u2013 2 May 2013) was a Croatian footballer who played at both professional and international levels as a goalkeeper. ==Club career== Turina started his professional career with his youth club Dinamo Zagreb in 1998. Before settling as a first-team member in 2003, he completed loan spells at Croatia Sesvete, Kamen Ingrad and Osijek. He was Dinamo Zagreb's first- choice goalkeeper during the 2005\u201306 season, when the club won their first league title in two years. He continued to play regularly in the early stages of the following season. However, after Dinamo Zagreb were eliminated from the UEFA Cup with a 5\u20132 aggregate defeat to AJ Auxerre in the first round, Turina was replaced in the starting line-up by Filip Lon\u010dari\u0107. At the time, he was criticized for letting a long-range shot by Ireneusz Jele\u0144 slip through his hands when the French club took a 1\u20130 lead in the first leg in Zagreb. Following the signing of German goalkeeper Georg Koch in the summer of 2007, Turina decided to join Greek club Skoda Xanthi, spending one season with them before leaving for Polish club Lech Pozna\u0144. Turina made his league debut for Lech Pozna\u0144 on 31 October 2008 in a 3\u20131 win at home to Odra Wodzis\u0142aw \u015al\u0105ski. He finished the season with a total of 12 appearances in the league and six in the UEFA Cup, where the club were eliminated by Udinese in the round of 32. He played in the final of the Polish Cup, which the club won that season. On 11 September 2009, Turina terminated his contract with Lech Pozna\u0144 and started training with Dinamo Zagreb later that month. On 27 January 2010, Dinamo Zagreb signed Turina as their new second-choice goalkeeper, behind Tomislav Butina, on a short-term contract until the end of the 2009\u201310 season. His sole appearance during that spell with the club came on 14 April 2010 in a 2\u20131 win at Vara\u017edin, where he came on as a substitute for Butina at half-time. Turina went on to join Swedish club AIK, making his debut on 17 July 2010 in a 2\u20130 win at home to Malm\u00f6 FF. At the time of his death, he was in his fourth season with the club and had made a total of 65 appearances in the league.\"Croatia \u2013 I. Turina \u2013 Profile with news, career statistics and history \u2013 Soccerway\" ==International career== Turina was part of the Croatian national football team at the 2006 Carlsberg Cup in Hong Kong. On 1 February 2006, he came on as a half-time substitute for Joey Didulica in the team's second match at the tournament, a 4\u20130 win against the hosts. It was his only full international appearance. ==Death== On 2 May 2013, Turina died in his sleep in his apartment in Solna. His wife did not realize what had happened until the morning.\u201dTolkade det som att han snarkade\u201d aftonbladet.se 2 May 2013. The autopsy report, released on 10 July 2013, states that Turina's death was caused by cardiac dysrhythmia, a congenital heart defect. He was survived by one-year-old twin daughters and a pregnant wife. On 13 May 2013, a charity game between AIK and Dinamo Zagreb, Turina's youth team where he also played as a professional until 2007 and in the spring of 2010, was played at Friends Arena to honour him. All proceedings from the game went to Turina's family. Each half of the game was 27 minutes long, as 27 was Turina's shirt number at AIK. Former AIK players Krister Nordin and Neboj\u0161a Novakovi\u0107 also played in the charity game, which Dinamo Zagreb won 1\u20130 in front of 8,058 spectators. Turina's family received 1.5 million SEK as a result of the charity event. In every game played by the AIK male football squad since Turinas death the fans are quiet during the 27th minute, the number on Turinas jersey, and spend the next minute chanting his name. This tradition has been upheld every single game since Turinas death. ==References== == External links == * Category:1980 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Croatian footballers Category:Croatia youth international footballers Category:Croatian expatriate footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:AIK Fotboll players Category:GNK Dinamo Zagreb players Category:NK Croatia Sesvete players Category:NK Osijek players Category:NK Kamen Ingrad players Category:Croatia international footballers Category:Xanthi F.C. players Category:Lech Pozna\u0144 players Category:Croatian First Football League players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Ekstraklasa players Category:Allsvenskan players Category:Expatriate footballers in Poland Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Sweden Category:Croatian expatriate sportspeople in Poland ",
