The race was the 16th round of the 2018 Formula One World Championship and marked the 7th running of the Russian Grand Prix and the 5th time the race had been held in Sochi. Mercedes driver Lewis Hamilton entered the round with a 40-point lead over Sebastian Vettel in the Drivers' Championship. In the World Constructors' Championship, Mercedes led Ferrari by 37 points. The race was one of controversy, as Mercedes enacted team orders to swap their two drivers, handing Lewis Hamilton the win and Valtteri Bottas would move to 2nd place for the race finish. The race result sparked discussion regarding the future of team orders in the sport, and some even going as to call for an outright ban on the practice. == Report == ===Background=== The race was moved from its April date to September to fill the vacancy of the Malaysian Grand Prix, which was discontinued at the end of the 2017 season. During the weekend, the first DRS zone was extended by 100 meters so that the beginning of the DRS zone started 95 meters before turn 1. ===Race=== At the start, Sebastian Vettel got a better start than Lewis Hamilton, but there was no room to overtake heading into turn one. On lap 4, both Scuderia Toro Rosso drivers Pierre Gasly and Brendon Hartley suffered brake failures which forced both to retire, they were the only retirements of the race. Later on lap 14, Hamilton made his one and only pitstop of the race, putting him behind Vettel. Two laps later, Hamilton made a move on Sebastian Vettel at turn 3 and passed him into fourth place into turn 4. The most notable moment of the race came on lap 26, when Mercedes asked Valtteri Bottas to let Lewis Hamilton through into second at turn 13. Max Verstappen, who led the race since lap 19, came in for his pitstop on lap 42. Hamilton won the race for the third time in his career, with Valtteri Bottas second and Sebastian Vettel completing the podium in third place. As a consequence, Hamilton extended his lead over Vettel in the championship to 50 points. ==Classification== ===Qualifying=== {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:85%\" !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2| !rowspan=2|Driver !rowspan=2|Constructor !colspan=3| !rowspan=2| |- !Q1 !Q2 !Q3 |- !1 |align=\"center\"|77 | Valtteri Bottas |Mercedes |1:32.964 |1:32.744 |1:31.387 |align=\"center\"|1 |- !2 |align=\"center\"|44 | Lewis Hamilton |Mercedes |1:32.410 |1:32.595 |1:31.532 |align=\"center\"|2 |- !3 |align=\"center\"|5 | Sebastian Vettel |Ferrari |1:33.476 |1:33.045 |1:31.943 |align=\"center\"|3 |- !4 |align=\"center\"|7 | Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen |Ferrari |1:33.341 |1:33.065 |1:32.237 |align=\"center\"|4 |- !5 |align=\"center\"|20 | Kevin Magnussen |Haas-Ferrari |1:34.078 |1:33.747 |1:33.181 |align=\"center\"|5 |- !6 |align=\"center\"|31 | Esteban Ocon |Force India-Mercedes |1:34.290 |1:33.596 |1:33.413 |align=\"center\"|6 |- !7 |align=\"center\"|16 | Charles Leclerc |Sauber-Ferrari |1:33.924 |1:33.488 |1:33.419 |align=\"center\"|7 |- !8 |align=\"center\"|11 | Sergio P\u00e9rez |Force India-Mercedes |1:34.084 |1:33.923 |1:33.563 |align=\"center\"|8 |- !9 |align=\"center\"|8 | Romain Grosjean |Haas-Ferrari |1:34.022 |1:33.517 |1:33.704 |align=\"center\"|9 |- !10 |align=\"center\"|9 | Marcus Ericsson |Sauber-Ferrari |1:34.170 |1:33.995 |1:35.196 |align=\"center\"|10 |- !11 |align=\"center\"|33 | Max Verstappen |Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer |1:33.048 |No time | |align=\"center\"|19 |- !12 |align=\"center\"|3 | Daniel Ricciardo |Red Bull Racing-TAG Heuer |1:33.247 |No time | |align=\"center\"|18 |- !13 |align=\"center\"|10 | Pierre Gasly | |1:34.383 |No time | |align=\"center\"|17 |- !14 |align=\"center\"|55 | Carlos Sainz Jr. |Renault |1:34.626 |No time | |align=\"center\"|11 |- !15 |align=\"center\"|27 | Nico H\u00fclkenberg |Renault |1:34.655 |No time | |align=\"center\"|12 |- !16 |align=\"center\"|28 | Brendon Hartley |Scuderia Toro Rosso-Honda |1:35.037 | | |align=\"center\"|20 |- !17 |align=\"center\"|14 | Fernando Alonso |McLaren-Renault |1:35.504 | | |align=\"center\"|16 |- !18 |align=\"center\"|35 | Sergey Sirotkin |Williams- Mercedes |1:35.612 | | |align=\"center\"|13 |- !19 |align=\"center\"|2 | |McLaren- Renault |1:35.977 | | |align=\"center\"|15 |- !20 |align=\"center\"|18 | Lance Stroll |Williams-Mercedes |1:36.437 | | |align=\"center\"|14 |- !colspan=\"8\"| 107% time: 1:38.878 |- !colspan=\"8\"| Source: |} ;Notes * \u2013 Max Verstappen received a 43-place grid penalty: 35 places for exceeding his quota of power unit elements, 5 places for an unscheduled gearbox change and 3 places for a yellow flag infringement in qualifying. * \u2013 Daniel Ricciardo received a 40-place grid penalty: 35 places for exceeding his quota of power unit elements and 5 places for an unscheduled gearbox change. * \u2013 Pierre Gasly received a 35-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of power unit elements. * \u2013 Brendon Hartley received a 40-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of power unit elements. * \u2013 Fernando Alonso received a 30-place grid penalty for exceeding his quota of power unit elements. * \u2013 Stoffel Vandoorne received a 5-place grid penalty for an unscheduled gearbox change.
