    "text": "Hemidactylus boavistensis, the Boa Vista leaf-toed gecko, is a species of gecko in the family Gekkonidae. The species is endemic to the Cape Verde Islands. The specific name, boavistensis, refers to the island Boa Vista, one of the islands where it has been found. It has also been found on the island Sal and the islets of Curral Velho and Sal Rei. It had long been considered a subspecies of Hemidactylus bouvieri but was re-elevated as a separate species in 2008. The Boa Vista leaf-toed gecko reaches lengths of from snout to vent. The head is relatively broad and the snout narrow with a concave or straight profile on the dorsal surface. It has about 35\u201338 fine ventral scales across the mid-belly. The first hind toe typically has 5 scales underneath while the fourth toe has 7\u20139 scales. In comparison, H. bouvieri is smaller, up to from snout to vent, with a narrower head, 20\u201325 coarse ventral scales, and only 3\u20134 scales under the first hind toe and 4\u20135 under the fourth. Although it is common where it is found, it was listed as a \"near threatened\" species on the IUCN Red List in 2012 due to its limited distribution, pressures from development, and competition with introduced species such as the house gecko (Hemidactylus angulatus). ==References== boavistensis Category:Endemic vertebrates of Cape Verde Category:Fauna of Boa Vista, Cape Verde Category:Reptiles described in 1906 Category:Taxa named by George Albert Boulenger ",
