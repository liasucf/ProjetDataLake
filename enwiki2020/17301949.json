    "text": "Nyatt Point Light in 2007 Nayatt Point Light is a historic lighthouse in Barrington, Rhode Island. The current light was built of brick in 1856 and contains an 1828 keeper's house. The lighthouse was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. == First light == On May 23, 1828, the United States Congress appropriated $3,500 for a lighthouse to mark the narrow passage between Nayatt Point and a shoal extending from Conimicut Point.\" Required by law to accept the lowest bid for the project, the government was forced to enter into the contract with William Halloway and Westgate Watson for the construction regardless of the qualifications of the contractors. This obligation was confirmed by Stephen Pleasonton of the U.S. Treasury Department, confirming the authorization to enter into the contract with Halloway and Watson. The tower was poorly constructed and was difficult to navigate for the lightkeepers. == List of keepers == This list includes known keepers, but may not be exhaustive. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
