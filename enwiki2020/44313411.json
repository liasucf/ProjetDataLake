Raised in Chicago, by way of Ohio and Mexico City, the twins are self-taught musicians who learned piano, guitar and songwriting by studying Beatles songs.

Their songs have appeared in film and television shows including \"Love, Love, Love (Remix)\" in Cruel Intentions 3 (Sony Pictures) and \"Oh Mary\" in Men in Trees (ABC). After being a well-known part of the alternative pop scene in Chicago, they moved to California in 2000, which launched their careers as songwriters and producers, and where the LA Weekly described them as, \"...Silky voiced sirens with universal appeal.\"Lentz, Andrew (January 1\u20139, 2003). \"Scoring The Clubs\".
