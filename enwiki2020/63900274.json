The holiday serves as the official holiday of the Artsakh Defense Army, which was established on this day. Because of this reality, it is sometimes referred to as a \"triple holiday\". == Commemorations == The 2020 flypast.

The parade also coincided with the golden jubilee (50th anniversary) of the Great Patriotic War, which was celebrated with military parades in all former Soviet republics (excluding the Baltic states). The commander of the parade was Deputy Commander of the NKR Army Major-General Seyran Ohanyan while the inspector was Defence minister Samvel Babayan. All orders and speeches during the parade were notably given in Russian instead of the Armenian language. Troops from all the Defense Districts and separate subdivisions of the Defense Army passed through the central square. * 1997 - This parade celebrated the 5th anniversary of the liberation and the 52nd anniversary of the victory. * 2007 - The 2007 parade was attended by Armenian President Kocharian and Artsakh President Arkady Ghukasian.
