The playing field itself is named George Cole Field, in honor of the former Arkansas athletic director. George Cole Field was also the name of the Razorbacks' old home stadium, in use from 1975 to March 1996. Baum Stadium replaced George Cole Field in April 1996. The stadium is located one-half mile from the main Arkansas campus, which lies across Razorback Road from the stadium. On January 31, 2019 the stadium was renamed Baum\u2013Walker Stadium at George Cole Field in recognition of longtime support from the Walker Family and the Willard and Pat Walker Charitable Foundation. ==History== Baum\u2013Walker Stadium, April 2013 Baum Stadium officially opened in 1996. It was designed by Populous (formerly HOK Sport), an architecture firm that has also designed several major league stadiums. Its first game was a 9\u20132 Arkansas win over Auburn on April 13, 1996. The stadium was dedicated prior to a 9\u20133 Arkansas win over Alabama on May 3, 1996. In 1998, Baum Stadium was named the country's number one college baseball facility by Baseball America, and claimed the top spot again in 2018. In 1999, Arkansas won the regular season Southeastern Conference title and had an average home attendance of 3,780 spectators, the sixth-highest total in Division I college baseball. That year, the stadium hosted an NCAA regional. Prior to the 2003 season, 2,600 chairback seats were added (1,300 down each foul line). In addition, the hitting and pitching cages were enclosed to allow year-round access. During the 2003 and 2004 seasons, renovations took place. Coaches offices and eight luxury boxes were added above the seating areas. Also, a new scoreboard was built in right field. The scoreboard stands 51 feet high and is 76 feet wide and features four classic brick pillars. Also in 2004, a natural grass surface was added, replacing the AstroTurf field that had been in place since the stadium opened. Rye grass was initially used for the 2004 season but was in 2005 replaced by a hybrid bermuda grass. In November 2006, the stadium underwent its third expansion since the 2003 season. The expansion includes 20 luxury boxes, 1,500 chairback seats, and a new outfield area to bring the stadium's capacity 10,737 spectators. The expansions have made the stadium the second biggest, by listed capacity, in the Southeastern Conference.
