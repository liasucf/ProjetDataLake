    "text": "Party Heard Around the World is the ninth studio album by American country music group Lonestar, released on April 27, 2010. It is the band's first studio album since 2006's Mountains. It debuted at No. 20 on the Billboard Country Albums chart and No. 100 on the Billboard 200, selling 5,000 copies in its first week. It is the only album to feature Cody Collins on lead vocals since Richie McDonald left in 2007 to pursue a solo career then returned the following year. ==Background== Party Heard Around the World is their first and only release with lead vocalist Cody Collins, who joined Lonestar in 2007, after the departure of lead singer Richie McDonald. It is also the first release for Saguaro Road Records. On March 31, Lonestar gave an exclusive concert for QVC where they performed some of their hit songs, such as \"Amazed\" and \"I'm Already There\", and some selections from Party Heard Around the World. Lonestar was featured as the first \"house band\" on The Price Is Right on June 17, 2010. In their appearance, they performed The Price Is Right theme song throughout the show, and Party Heard Around the World featured in one of the two showcases. ==Singles== The first single from the album, Let Me Love You was released in early 2008, where it debuted at #60 on the Billboard Charts. In an interview with americajr.com, when asked about the story behind the song, Collins responded by saying \"Well, I didn't write the song, but it's basically a love song, [...] It's a guy asking a girl to open up your heart to me. Basically, let me in. A lot of girls don't want to do that these days. They think we're all douche bags. It's nice for a girl to open up to somebody and let somebody in.\" You're The Reason Why was released as the second single in March 2010. ==Critical reception== Blake Boldt of Engine 145 gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of five, calling it \"ultimately forgettable fluff\" and criticizing Collins' \"silky smooth voice [that] barely makes a ripple.\" Michael McCall with the Associated Press criticized the album by saying \"the revamped country band tries to forge a future by shifting away from its past. No longer portraying themselves as content fathers relaxing on the front porch, Lonestar now prefers combing clubs and beachfronts for love and good times.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== From Party Heard Around the World liner notes.
