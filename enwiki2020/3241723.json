The club SC Borussia Neunkirchen was founded out of the 1907 merger of FC 1905 Borussia and SC Neunkirchen. ==History== Historical chart of Borussia Neunkirchen league performance after WWII From 1912 through to 1963 the club had an uninterrupted record of first division play including the Kreisliga Saar, Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar and selection to the Gauliga, formed in 1933 through the reorganization of German football under the Third Reich. Borussia remained at this level, in the Gauliga S\u00fcdwest/Mainhessen, throughout the league's history, with good results but not winning a league championship. Like other organizations in the country, including sports and football associations, Borussia was dissolved by the Allied occupation authorities after World War II, but was quickly reformed under its current name. The club played in the French-occupied Saarland and the French made various efforts to see the state become independent of Germany or join France. In sport this was manifested as separate 1952 Olympic and 1954 World Cup teams for Saarland, the establishment of a short-lived football league for the state, and the German club 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken playing in the French second division. Neunkirchen played in the Saarland Ehrenliga from 1949 to 1951, winning the title in the first year and finishing as runner-up the next. They were able to re-join the DFB (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund or German Football Association) after the 1950\u201351 season in the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest. Despite their record of continuous play at the top flight, Neunkirchen was not one of the sixteen sides selected for play in the Bundesliga \u2013 Germany's new professional football league \u2013 at its formation. Along with FK Pirmasens and Wormatia Worms, they were bypassed in favour of 1. FC Saarbr\u00fccken, even though they all had better records than the chosen side. More than a few protests were lodged as 1. FC appeared to have gained entry based simply on their affiliation with a member of the league selection committee. Their entry was delayed by only a year as they were able to play their way into the upper league through the promotion rounds after winning the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest. Their stay in the Bundesliga was short-lived. After a mid-table result in 1965, they would be relegated the following season after a 17th-place finish. They won the Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest again after being sent down and returned to the Bundesliga to another 17th-place finish and relegation. Neunkirchen spent another seven years playing tier II football before slipping to the Amateurliga Saarland (III). Through the mid-1970s and into the early 1980s the club bounced up and down between these levels of play, before settling in for a decade and a half at tier III. The team slipped again in 1996 to the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (IV). They won their division in 2005 but declined the opportunity to apply for a license and promotion to the third division because of financial problems that have plagued the club since 2003. From 2012\u201313 the Oberliga S\u00fcdwest was renamed Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar, with Borussia continuing in this league. In April 2015 the club had to declare insolvency with a debt of \u20ac280,000.Ex-Bundesligist stellt Insolvenz-Antrag www.t-online.de, published: 2 April 2015, accessed: 4 June 2015 ==Honours== The club's honours: ===League=== * Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (I) ** Champions: 1962 ** Runners-up: 1959, 1960, 1961, 1963 * Bezirksliga Rheinhessen-Saar (I) ** Champions: 1924 * Bezirksliga Rhein-Saar (Saar division) (I) ** Champions: 1929 * Kreisliga Saar (I) ** Champions: 1921, 1922, 1923 * Regionalliga S\u00fcdwest (II) ** Champions: 1964, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1974 * Oberliga S\u00fcdwest (III-IV) ** Champions: 1980, 1991, 2000, 2002, 2005 * Amateurliga Saarland (III) ** Champions: 1976, 1977, 1978 * Ehrenliga Saarland (II) ** Champions: 1949 ** Runners-up: 1950 ===Cup=== * Southern German Cup ** Winners: 1921 * Saarland Cup (Tiers III-VII) ** Winners: 1978, 1985, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1996, 2003 ** Runners-up: 1995, 1997, 2001, 2008, 2010 ==Recent seasons== The recent season-by-season performance of the club:Das deutsche Fu\u00dfball-Archiv Historical German domestic league tablesFussball.de \u2013 Ergebnisse Tables and results of all German football leagues {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#dfdfdf;\" | Season | Division | Tier | Position |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1964-1965 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Bundesliga | rowspan=1| I | 10th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1965-1966 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Bundesliga | rowspan=1| I | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 17th \u2193 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 1967-1968 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Bundesliga | rowspan=1| I | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 17th \u2193 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | 1999\u20132000 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | rowspan=3| IV | 1st |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2000\u201301 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 3rd |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2001\u201302 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | style=\"background:#ddffdd\"| 1st \u2191 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2002\u201303 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Regionalliga S\u00fcd | III | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 19th \u2193 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | 2003\u201304 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | rowspan=5| IV | 10th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2004\u201305 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 1st |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2005\u201306 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 9th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2006\u201307 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 10th |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | 2007\u201308 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 6th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2008\u201309 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | rowspan=9| V | 4th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2009\u201310 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 12th |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | 2010\u201311 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 7th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2011\u201312 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga S\u00fcdwest | 7th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2012\u201313 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar | 5th |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | 2013\u201314 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga Rheinland- Pfalz/Saar | 15th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2014\u201315 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar | 12th |- style=\"text- align:center;\" | 2015\u201316 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Oberliga Rheinland- Pfalz/Saar | 4th |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2016\u201317 | style=\"text- align:left;\"| Oberliga Rheinland-Pfalz/Saar | style=\"background:#ffcccc\"| 17th \u2193 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2017\u201318 | style=\"text-align:left;\"| Saarlandliga | rowspan=1| VI | |} * With the introduction of the Regionalligas in 1994 and the 3.
