In recent years, the original mix of \"The Child (Inside)\" has been used in several US television commercials, the most popular being from Seaworld parks and Carnival Cruise Lines. ==Critical reception== Larry Flick from Billboard wrote, \"The Euro-NRG sound that has propelled dance music back into pop radio prominence has been in need of a little variation and development. This intriguing new act successfully accomplishes the task without tampering too much with the genre's tried-and-true formula. Typically bright and springy beats underline a contagious melody that is executed with whooping tribal chants and quirky female vocals.\" Music & Media noted that South African trio QKumba Zoo \"have already made more impression on the U.S. market with this single than any of their compatriots have since the heady days of Clout's Substitute. Signed to Arista by Clive Davis, their sound straddles the ethnic and CHR camps in persuasive style, landing somewhere between Johnny Clegg and current European synth pop, reflecting female lead singer Levannah's upbringing in the Zulu homeland of Natal.\" ==Music video== The music video for \"The Child (Inside)\" was directed by Ruven Afanador. ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1995-1996) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"|South Africa (South Africa Singles Chart) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Hot 100 | 69 |- ! scope=\"row\"|US Billboard Dance Club Songs | 1 |- |} ==References== Category:1995 songs Category:1996 debut singles Category:Electronic songs Category:House music songs Category:Number-one singles in South Africa Category:Billboard Dance Club Songs number-one singles Category:Arista Records singles Category:Mega Records singles ",
