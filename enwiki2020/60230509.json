In 2016, she was presented as recipient of the 2016 New York NADA Artadia Award, which is presented every year to one artist that is exhibiting at NADA New York. Wheat developed a painting technique whereby she pushes acrylic paint through framed pieces of aluminum mesh; this technique was described by The Art in America journal as \"completely novel\". Her 2018 exhibition at the Andrew Edlin Gallery in NY was chosen by Artforum as a Critics' Pick. == Education == Wheat received a BA from University of Central Oklahoma in 2000, and an MFA from Savannah College of Art and Design in 2005. == External links == * == References == Category:1977 births Category:Living people Category:People from Oklahoma City Category:20th-century American artists Category:21st-century American artists Category:University of Central Oklahoma alumni Category:Savannah College of Art and Design alumni ",
