    "text": "Laurelia sempervirens, commonly called Peruvian nutmeg, from mapuche: tihue, trihue, also called Chilean laurel or Chilean sassafras. It is a species of Evergreen tree in the family Atherospermataceae, formerly Monimiaceae, in the southern hemisphere genus of plant Laurelia, not closely related to Lauraceae despite the similarity. It is endemic to Chile. It occurs 34\u201341\u00b0 South Latitude. They require a warm subtropical to tropical climate that is cool but also frost-free or with only very slight winter frosts not below -4 \u00b0C, and with high summer heat, rainfall, and humidity. This is, the laurel forest habitat. The Tihue Growth best on well-drained, slightly acidic soils rich in organic matter. ==Description== The tihue is a large ( up 30 m. tall to 2 m. diameter) evergreen, Laurel forest tree with smooth, pale yellow bark. The bark cracks when aging coming off in roughly circular plates. The wood and the leaves are strongly aromatic. The bright green leaves of the Chilean laurel are arranged in opposite pairs, and are oblong in shape, narrowed at the base. The leaves are leathery, shiny, and around 5 to 10 centimetres long and 2.5 to 5 centimetres wide. The serrated edges of the leaves help to distinguish this tree from the closely related Laureliopsis philippiana, which has more deeply toothed leaf margins. The tihue bears bundles of small yellow unisexual or hermaphrodite flowers. The fruit is a greenish achene with seeds bearing feathery anemophilous filaments. The seed is dispersed by the wind (anemochory). ==Cultivation and uses== Its wood is pale-yellowish, with growth rings little notorious and homogeneous and fine texture. It is threatened by habitat loss. It has been introduced into Spain and into CornwallTrebah plant and tree inventory 2007, : The Trebah specimens of L. sempervirens are catalogued as TB141 and TB198. The latter had a girth of 1.63 metres and a height of 19.05 metres in 2007. There is also a mature specimen at Enys garden, labelled as a \"Peruvian laurel\". There are probably several other mature specimens in gardens in Cornwall. and planted in Sussex in the UK. The leaves of Laurelia sempervirens were used by Mapuche Amerindians for treating headache and as diuretic. [4] ==References== * Gonz\u00e1lez, M. 1998.
