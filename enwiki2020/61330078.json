    "text": "Irene Robledo Garc\u00eda (statue) Irene Robledo Garc\u00eda (April 5, 1890 - August 8, 1988) was a Mexican educator and humanist from Jalisco. She was a co-founder of the modern era of the University of Guadalajara. Her personal motto was \"For a more human humanity\". She broke with the feminine stereotypes of the early twentieth century by studying to be a teacher, and later as a homeopathic doctor, dentist, and social worker. She was considered a normalist teacher who overcame her class limitations and gender stereotypes by inserting herself into groups with intellectual interests.http://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=88402513 Redalyc.

She participated in the organization of the first labor unions, established night high schools, instituted school breakfasts, developed cooperatives of normal school teachers, and was the chair at the Universidad Obrera. In 1905, she entered the Normal School of Guadalajara. She actively participated with the group of intellectuals that Governor Jos\u00e9 Guadalupe Zuno met with for the re-opening of the University of Guadalajara in 1925. Robledo placed emphasis on integral education, on the participation of women in careers which had been exclusive for men, on the installation of the Institute of technology, and on providing a social culture based on freedom to make education available to everyone. == Early life and education == Irene Robledo Garc\u00eda was born in Guadalajara, April 5, 1890.

In 1930, she collaborated with developing the literacy of unionized workers. During this decade, she studied in the United States to be a homeopathic doctor, dentist, and social worker, as this education was not available in Mexico.
