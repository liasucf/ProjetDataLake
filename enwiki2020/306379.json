These later became English settlements, and were consolidated over time until the entirety of Kings County was the unified City of Brooklyn. The towns were, clockwise from the north: Bushwick, Brooklyn, Flatlands, Gravesend, New Utrecht, with Flatbush in the middle. The modern neighborhoods bearing these names are located roughly in the center of each of these original towns. Certain portions of the original six towns were also independent municipalities for a time, before being reabsorbed. Following an 1894 referendum, the entire consolidated City of Brooklyn became a borough of New York City in 1898. ===Bushwick=== Annexed to Brooklyn in 1854. *Bushwick *Greenpoint *Williamsburg (separated from Bushwick in 1840, annexed to Brooklyn in 1854) ===Brooklyn === *Bedford-Stuyvesant *Boerum Hill *Carroll Gardens *Cobble Hill *Brooklyn Heights *Brownsville *City Line *Clinton Hill *Crown Heights *Cypress Hills *Downtown Brooklyn *DUMBO *East New York *Fort Greene *Gowanus *Greenwood Heights *Highland Park *New Lots (separated from Flatbush in 1852, annexed to Brooklyn in 1886) *Ocean Hill *Park Slope *Prospect Heights *RAMBO *Spring Creek *Starrett City *Stuyvesant Heights *Sunset Park *Vinegar Hill *Weeksville *Windsor Terrace *Wingate ===Flatlands=== Annexed to Brooklyn in 1869. *Bergen Beach *Canarsie *Flatlands *Georgetown *Marine Park *Mill Basin *The southeastern quarter of Midwood ===Gravesend=== Annexed to Brooklyn in 1894. *Brighton Beach *Coney Island *Gerritsen Beach *Gravesend *Homecrest *Madison *Midwood *Manhattan Beach *Plum Beach *Seagate *Sheepshead Bay ===New Utrecht=== Annexed to Brooklyn in 1894. *Bay Ridge *Borough Park *Dyker Heights *Mapleton *New Utrecht *Bath Beach *Bensonhurst ===Flatbush === Annexed to Brooklyn in 1894. *Ditmas Park *East Flatbush *Farragut *Fiske Terrace *Flatbush *Kensington *Prospect Lefferts Gardens *Prospect Park South ==See also== *List of Bronx neighborhoods *List of Manhattan neighborhoods *List of Queens neighborhoods *List of Staten Island neighborhoods ==References== ==External links== *Neighborhood Map from NYC Department of City Planning *List of Brooklyn Neighborhood Associations Brooklyn Brooklyn Category:Lists of neighborhoods in U.S. cities ",
