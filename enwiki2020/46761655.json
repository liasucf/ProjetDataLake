(JSSG, \u6c5f\u82cf\u795e\u8c37\u65e0\u4eba\u98de\u884c\u5668\u6280\u672f\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), and these UAVs are primarily intended for law enforcement applications, and they are the successors of HT PS UAV developed earlier. ==Multirotors== Local demand for law enforcement UAVs soared after the successful development and deployment of HT PS UAV, but the business model of several police officers working at the side at their spare time to produce UAVs obviously was neither suitable nor could meet the market demand in a modern economy. As a result, an enterprise JSSG was formed to handle the development, production and after sale service of UAVs for law enforcement applications, and as of 2015, all UAVs developed are multirotors. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-right: 0;\" |- ! style=\"background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;\"| Model ! style=\"background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;\"| Quadrotor ! style=\"background: #55b339; color: #ffffff;\"|Hexarotor |- | Type: | Quadcopter | Hexacopter |- | Landing gear: | A pair of skids | A pair of skids |- | Max take-off weight (kg): | 3.6 | 5.6 |- | Max payload (kg): | 2 | 8 |- | Remote control radius (km): | 2 \u2013 10 | 2 \u2013 10 |- | Endurance (min): | 55 | 55 |- | Vertical hovering accuracy (m): | \u00b1 0.5 | \u00b1 0.5 |- | Horizontal hovering accuracy (m): | \u00b1 2 | \u00b1 2 |- | Normal operating altitude (km): | 1 | 1 |- | Max wind allowed for operation (m/s): | 8 | 8 |- | Rate of climb (m/s): | 6 | 6 |- | Flight control: | Manual & automatic | Manual & automatic |- | Rotors (blades x pair): | 2 x 2 | 2 x 3 |- | Navigation: | GPS | GPS |- | Engine: | Electric motor | Electric motor |- | Engine life (h): | 300 | 350 |- | Temperature allowed for operation (\u2070C): | - 5 to 60 | - 5 to 60 |- | Take-off preparation time (min): | < 5 | < 5 |- |} ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of China ==References== Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of China ",
