    "text": "Lafayette is a Bay Area Rapid Transit station in Lafayette, California. The station consists of one island platform in the center median of State Route 24 just south of the Lafayette Hillside Memorial. Service at the station began on May 21, 1973. In October 2011, BART was criticized for spending $2 million on a wheelchair ramp at the south entrance to the station without adding curb cuts or accessible parking there. However, the ramp was primarily built to connect to a path to the Lafayette business district to the south, and BART was already preparing to add curb cuts. The fare lobby includes three columns covered in tile mosaics, which were designed by Helen Webber and constructed by Alfonso Pardi\u00f1as. Webber originally planned to use a purple background, but switched to blue due to local objections of purple's association with the controversial People's Park. ==See also== *List of Bay Area Rapid Transit stations ==Notes== == External links == *BART - Lafayette Category:Bay Area Rapid Transit stations in Contra Costa County, California Category:Lafayette, California Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in California Category:Railway stations in highway medians ",
