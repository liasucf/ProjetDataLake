    "text": "No Colours Records is a German mail order and record label from M\u00fcgeln specialised in black metal. == Background == No Colours Records mostly releases black metal records, but has also released records related to other extreme metal genres such as thrash and death metal. Most releases appear both on CDs and as limited vinyl editions. Furthermore, the label sells merchandising articles such as T-shirts and embroidered patches. The label's most well-known bands are Inquisition, Graveland and Nargaroth. No Colours has also released many of Rob Darken's side projects such as Lord Wind and Infernum. Besides neo-nazi bands such as Thor's Hammer from Poland, the label has also signed many apolitical bands like Wigrid and Suicidal Winds, so some are against an association to the far right. == History == Steffen Zopf founded No Colours Records in 1993 as a label and mail order for black metal records and merchandise. Among his first releases are Dimmu Borgir's first album For all tid and most releases by Graveland after their departure from Lethal Records. In 1996, the label released both Absurd's and Falkenbach's debut albums. Absurd's Asgardsrei EP was also financed by Zopf but released under the name \"IG Farben Production\".Christian Dornbusch/Hans-Peter Killguss: Unheilige Allianzen.
