    "text": "The E-Flexer is a class of Chinese-built Ro-Pax ferries ordered by Stena RoRo for European line service. Nine vessels of the class are on order, and upon delivery will be operated by Stena Line, Brittany Ferries, and DFDS Seaways. Stena Line are to take five vessels of the class, Brittany Ferries three (two of which will be powered by LNG), and a single vessel will go to DFDS. All of the vessels will be delivered to Stena RoRo with the Stena Line vessels transferred to that company and the Brittany Ferries and DFDS examples long- term chartered to those operators. ==History== Following about two years of design work, Stena ordered the first four vessels of the class from Chinese shipbuilder AVIC Weihai in April 2016, with options for four more ships. Stena originally planned to utilize the four ferries on Irish Sea services out of Belfast, but later agreed to charter the third ship in the series to Brittany Ferries. In February 2018, the keel was laid for the first ship, with her delivery scheduled for early 2020. Stena RoRo ordered a fifth ship in April 2018, which will enter service with DFDS Seaways on a ten-year charter upon delivery. The following month, Stena RoRo ordered a sixth ship, to be placed with Brittany Ferries on a ten-year charter beginning in late 2021. Construction on the second ship in the class began in June 2018. In July, Stena Line ordered two more ships, accounting for all the options in the original 2016 order, while Stena RoRo announced that it had agreed to take new options for four more vessels. ===Service=== The first ship in the class, named Stena Estrid, was launched in January 2019 and was delivered in China on 15 November. On arrival in Holyhead, faulty seals on over 20 windows were discovered. Repairs were carried out prior to her maiden voyage, which took place on 13 January 2020. She is regularly operated on Stena's route between Holyhead and Dublin. Stena Edda, the second E-flexer earmarked for Stena Line's fleet, was delivered to Stena RoRo on 15 January 2020. Following bunkering in Singapore and Gibraltar, and an outside port limits call at Galle, the crew travelling from Weihai were also checked by local authorities for coronavirus infection, with no evidence of the disease being present. She entered service on Stena's route between Belfast and Liverpool, where Stena Embla, the fourth ship of the series, is planned to operate upon her delivery in early 2021. Galicia was delivered on 3 September 2020, with her entry into service expected sometime in late 2020 or early 2021. She will operate out of Portsmouth, England, to Santander, Spain and Cherbourg, France. Brittany Ferries plans to take delivery of Salamanca in 2022, followed by Santo\u00f1a in 2023. The fourth ship in the series, to be operated by DFDS, will be named Cote d' Opale. She will differ significantly from the other E-Flexer vessels as she will have additional public spaces in areas where passenger cabins are located on the Stena Line and Brittany Ferries ships. She will operate across the Strait of Dover upon delivery. ==Design== E-Flexer-class ships were designed by Stena and Deltamarin. The first six ships of the type measure approximately and are in length, with a beam of and a draft of . Their freight deck has a capacity of 3,100 lane meters, with additional space for about 120 cars, apart from on the Brittany Ferries examples where additional passenger cabins are provided in the area occupied by the dedicated car deck on the other examples. The seventh and eighth ships will be long, with 3,600 lane meters of freight capacity. Passenger capacity is about 1,000 people, though the interior layout is built to the requirements of the operator. The first five ships to be built are each powered by two MaK M43C diesel engines, with a total power output of , driving two propellers that give the ships a service speed of . Those engines are designed to be compatible with liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel after modifications. Brittany Ferries' second (Galicia) and third (Santo\u00f1a) examples will be able to run on LNG from delivery, though both will have reduced freight capacity as a result of the space occupied by their LNG tanks. All of the E-Flexer vessels ordered to date will be ice-classed, either to 1A or 1C requirements. ==References== Category:Ships built in China Category:Ro-ro ships ",
