Author of multiple biographies, his Eminent Europeans: Studies in Continental Reality was widely reviewed when it was released in 1922. In 1941 he published the autobiography For the Heathen are Wrong: An Impersonal Autobiography. == Live == Eugene Bagger was born in Budapest of a free-thinking Jewish father in the year 1892. He early developed an interest in Catholicism, and was received into the Catholic Church in his late 'teens. When World War I started he travelled to England, hoping to be allowed to serve in the British forces. That, however, did not prove possible. He then travelled to the United States, where he later acquired citizenship. He followed for a time a journalist's career in America writing for The Nation, The New Republic, The Century Magazine and The Atlantic Monthly. Bagger eventually returned to Europe, in 1924, with a commission to write the life of the late Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria. He lived in various countries of Europe, but mainly in Provence, France. With the coming of the second world war he moved first with his family to the west of France, and then with France's collapse in 1940 he escaped over the Spanish frontier and eventually got back to the United States from Lisbon, Portugal. Later in his life he returned to Portugal and lived there between 1948 and 1949, having published several works defending the Salazar\u2019s Corporatist New State. == Works == * * * * * also Published in \"The Catholic World\", Volumen 164, Paulist Press, 1947 == Articles == * * * * * * * \"Garden by the Sea\" in Commonweal - A Review of Public Affairs, Literature, and the Arts, December 13, 1946, pp. 223\u2013225 * == External links == * Category:American critics Category:1892 births Category:Year of death missing ",
