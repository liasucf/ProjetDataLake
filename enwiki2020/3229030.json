A Schima wallichii tree has a depression on its trunk. Local people believe that it was caused by spirits that take rest here on their way to their abode of the dead and tether animals killed on their funeral. Surprisingly a few years ago, when one tree fell due to strong winds, another tree close to it started getting the same symptoms. == Visitor information == The best time to come to Balpakram National Park is from November to May when the weather is pleasant without rainfall.
