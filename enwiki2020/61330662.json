It is situated at the south- east corner of Forest Recreation Ground. ==History== Church Cemetery was founded in 1848 and was designed by Edwin Patchitt, clerk to the County Magistrates. Fundraising started in 1851 and 181 shareholders represented a contribution of 959 \u00a35 shares. The tenancies for the land were arranged in 1853 and it was not finished when it opened in 1856. A church was included in the design, which gave the cemetery its name, but this was not built at the time of its opening. The construction works involved the removal and relocation of some 20,000 tons of earth and the laying out of paths and suitable planting including Cedars of Lebanon. It was consecrated by the Bishop of Lincoln, Right Revd John Jackson on 18 June 1856 A mortuary chapel to the designs of the architect Edward William Godwin opened on 14 August 1879. The fittings were of varnished pitch pine, with accommodation for about 120 people. A bell turret surmounted the chapel, and in the archway through which mourning coaches passed, there was a waiting room. The cost of the chapel was \u00a32,600 (), and the contractors were Messrs. Bradley and Barker. It was demolished in 1965 A war memorial designed by Sir Reginald Blomfield was added in 1920 and is Grade II listed.
