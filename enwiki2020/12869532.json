    "text": "Sparbu Station () is a railway station located in the village of Sparbu in the municipality of Steinkjer in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. It is located along the Nordland Line and the station serves the Sparbu and M\u00e6re areas of Steinkjer. The unmanned station is only served by the Tr\u00f8ndelag Commuter Rail service between Steinkjer and Trondheim, and is located near the E6 highway. ==History== The station was built as part of Hell\u2013Sunnan Line and opened on 15 November 1905 along with the rest of the line north of Verdals\u00f8ra. The original station included three tracks, the extra two were and long, respectively. These tracks have since been removed and no passing is available at the station. Construction costs for the station were and plans were drawn by Paul Armin Due. Originally, it was named Sparbuen, but on 15 January 1910, the spelling was changed to Sparbu. The station was manned until 1980, and it has since been sold and the station building has been converted to a private residence. ===Location=== There was an extensive debate about the location of the station locally. Because the municipalities had to finance 15% of the investments in the railway, the municipal councils also got to determine important issues like the location of stations. The policy at the time was to allow one station for each municipality. The first debate was concerning the line through the municipality, where locals suggested two different lines both going further east to go via the settlement Lein where the only dairy and a local store was located. But the chief engineer of the project would not recommend either of the suggestions since they would be up to longer, cost up to more money, and go through more hilly terrain. So it was chosen to keep the original suggestion for a line from 1893. Instead a major debate about the location of a station surfaced, with suggestions to place the station at K\u00e5berg (what is now called Sparbu) or at M\u00e6re. Advocates for the K\u00e5berg alternative felt that K\u00e5berg was closest to the centre of the community. On the other hand, the M\u00e6re advocates felt that proximity to the new M\u00e6re Agricultural School was important. In reality, people chose the alternative closest to their own doorstep. The original plans also included a station at Vist. The city council voted to support the K\u00e5berg/Vist alternative on 17 January 1900. But by the time it had reached the Storting (legislature), an alternative to replace the two stations with one at M\u00e6re was chosen, and on 5 June 1900 the Storting voted to only build one station in Sparbu, located at M\u00e6re. But locals pleaded their members of Storting to reconsider the matter, and on 24 April 1901, the Storting changed their decision to the original suggestion with stations at K\u00e5berg and Vist. In 1904, the county engineer once again suggested moving the station to M\u00e6re for technical reasons, but the problems were overcome and two stations built, Sparbu Station and Vist Station. By 1917, M\u00e6re patriots had chosen to build the privately funded M\u00e6re Station. ==References== Category:Railway stations in Steinkjer Category:Railway stations on the Nordland Line Category:Railway stations opened in 1905 Category:1905 establishments in Norway Category:National Romantic architecture in Norway Category:Art Nouveau railway stations ",
