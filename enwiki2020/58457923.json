    "text": "The Cyprus Medical Association, also translated as the Pancyprian Medical Association, is a professional organisation of doctors in Cyprus, founded in 1967. It negotiates with the Health Insurance Organisation on behalf of doctors. In 2018 they were arguing for the national budget of Gesy to be increased by \u20ac100m to finance an increase from \u20ac60 per adult patient to \u20ac100, and \u20ac120 per head for child patients, and suggesting that patients' financial contributions should go directly to the doctors. The annual income for pediatricians would be \u20ac24,000. ==References== Category:Medical associations Category:Medical and health organisations based in Cyprus ",
