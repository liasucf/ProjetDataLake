    "text": "That's My Mama is an American television sitcom that was originally broadcast on the ABC network from September 4, 1974 until December 24, 1975. There are 39 episodes of this series. That's My Mama was never a ratings success. It was not one of the top 30 most-watched U.S. programs in the Nielsen ratings for either the 1974\u20131975 or 1975\u20131976 television seasons. As a result, the series ended on Christmas Eve of 1975. It was the first series to be produced by Columbia Pictures Television. ==Synopsis== Set in a middle-class African American neighborhood in Washington, D.C., the program revolved around the character Clifton Curtis (played by Clifton Davis), a man in his mid-20s who worked as a barber at Oscar's Barber Shop, the family barber shop he had inherited from his late father. While Clifton enjoyed being a bachelor, his loving, but tart-tongued and opinionated mother Eloise \"Mama\" Curtis, played by Theresa Merritt, wanted him to settle down and find a nice wife. Additional characters \u2013 such as Clifton's two best friends\u2014Earl, played by Teddy Wilson, an easy-going mailman and Junior, played by Ted Lange, a suave and good- humored ladies' man\u2014came and went over the course of a typical day at Oscar's Barber Shop. Other characters included Tracy, Clifton's little sister, played by Lynne Moody and later by Joan Pringle and her husband, Leonard, played by Lisle Wilson, as well as local seniors Josh and Wildcat, played by DeForest Covan and Jester Hairston. Clifton Davis and Hairston would work together again years later in the hit sitcom, Amen. The original name for That's My Mama was The Furst Family of Washington. One year before the series debuted, ABC aired the pilot episode of this version, starring Merritt opposite Godfrey Cambridge as her son Oscar, as a one-off special. ===That's My Mama Now!=== In 1986, inspired by the success of What's Happening Now!!, Columbia Pictures Television produced a pilot for a sequel series called That's My Mama Now! with Ted Lange as the star. It lacked enough stations signing up to ensure revival. ==Cast== * Clifton Davis as Clifton Curtis * Theresa Merritt as Eloise \"Mama\" Curtis * Ted Lange as Junior * Theodore Wilson as Earl Chambers (season 1, episode 3 - season 2, episode 13, main) * Jester Hairston as Wildcat (season 1, main) * Lynne Moody as Tracy Curtis Taylor (season 1, main) * DeForest Covan as Josh (season 1, main) * Lisle Wilson as Leonard Taylor (season 2, main; recurring season 1) * Joan Pringle as Tracy Curtis Taylor (season 2, main) * Helen Martin as Laura (season 2, recurring) Ernestine Wade originally portrayed the role of Laura in two episodes: \"Clifton's Sugar Mama\" (season 1, episode 5) and \"The Birthday Party\" (season 2, episode 1).
