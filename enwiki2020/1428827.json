Bokator fighters wrap the krama around their waists, heads and fists. The skill level of the martial artist is signified by the colour of the krama, white being the lowest and black being the most advanced. It is worn by men, women and children, and can be fairly ornate, though most typical kramas contain a gingham pattern of some sort, and traditionally come in either red or blue. It is the Cambodian national symbol. A closely related Thai garment is known as pha khao ma (\u0e1c\u0e49\u0e32\u0e02\u0e32\u0e27\u0e21\u0e49\u0e32) and is worn in the Isan region by locals and by ethnic Khmers. ==See also== *Agal, Arabian headdress *Gamucha, scarf from Bengal *Gingham, scarf from Malaysia *Keffiyeh, traditional Middle Eastern headdress *Tagelmust, scarf from Sahara *Turban, head scarf *Kh\u0103n r\u1eb1n, Vietnamese head scarf ==References== Category:Scarves Category:Headgear Category:Skirts Category:Cambodian clothing ",
