Females have been captured at honeydew from galls of Disholcapsis eldoradensis on Quercus lobata and at flowers of Asclepias erosa, Baccharis sarothroides, Chrysothamnus sp., Lepidospartum squamatum, and Wislizenia refracta. Males have been taken on the flowers of Calochortus catalinae, Hemizonia fasciculata, Rhamnus californica, and Xanthium spinosum. Both males and females visit the extrafloral nectaries of Helianthus and have been collected at flowers of Atriplex semibaccata, Cicuta sp., Eriogonum fasciculatum, Eriogonum gracile, and Foeniculum vulgare. The flight period in California is from May to October, with a peak in July and August. ==Subspecies== *T. u. cerinus Evans in the eastern part of the species range *T. u. unicolor Banks, distinguished by darker, often violaceous wings and having the mesosoma frequently being partially black, predominantly in the males, western part of the range ==References== Category:Insects described in 1919 Category:Pompilinae Category:Hymenoptera of North America Category:Taxa named by Nathan Banks ",
