    "text": "\"Savory\" (released as \"Savory + 3\") is the first single released by Jawbox from their 1994 major label debut, For Your Own Special Sweetheart. The song is a description of the female body, according to Allmusic, but in a very cryptic form. The three other songs from the single were later included as bonus tracks for the 2009 reissue of For Your Own Special Sweetheart. == Music video == The music video was released in early 1994 and gained some MTV airplay, particularly on programs like 120 Minutes, but the song never charted. The video depicts Jawbox performing at a little girl's birthday party, where the birthday girl receives an assortment of unusual gifts, including weapons and dentures. The video shows the band dressed in formal suits, a change from their old video for \"Cutoff\". It was reviewed on Beavis and Butt-head in a positive form, but the duo talked about how the video reminded them of Stewart's birthday party. == Cover version == The song was covered as a collaborative effort between members of the band Far and Chino Moreno of Deftones. The song was released in 1997 on Far's EP Soon. It was re- released on the Deftones' 2005 release B-Sides & Rarities and their 2011 cover compilation album, Covers. == Track listing == ==References== ==External links== *Official Music Video on YouTube Category:Jawbox songs Category:1994 singles Category:1993 songs Category:Atlantic Records singles ",
