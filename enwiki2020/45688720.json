    "text": "South Lancs/Cheshire 4 was a regional English rugby union league at the ninth tier of national competition for teams from the South Lancashire, Cheshire and Manchester area. Teams were promoted to South Lancs/Cheshire 3 and generally there was no relegation - although there was up until 2002 when South Lancs/Cheshire 5 was still active. Despite retaining healthy numbers of teams South Lancs/Cheshire 4 was abolished by the end of the 2008-09 season with most teams moving automatically up into South Lancs/Cheshire 3. ==Original teams== When this league was introduced in 1996 it contained the following teams: *Halton - relegated from Lancashire South (9th) *Hightown - relegated from Lancashire South (10th) *Holmes Chapel - relegated from Cheshire (9th) *Moore - relegated from Cheshire (8th) *Shell Stanlow - relegated from Cheshire (7th) ==South Lancs/Cheshire 4 honours== ===South Lancs/Cheshire 4 (1996-2000)=== The original South Lancs/Cheshire 4 league was ranked at tier 13 of the league system. Promotion was to South Lancs/Cheshire 3 and, as it was the lowest level in the North-West region, there was no relegation until the creation of South Lancs/Cheshire 5 at the end of the 1999\u201300 season. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- |colspan=\"11\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"| {| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| | style=\"border:0;\"|South Lancs/Cheshire 4 | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| |} |- ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:80px;\"|Season ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:50px;\"|No of Teams ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:175px;\"|Champions ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:175px;\"|Runners\u2013up ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:225px;\"|Relegated Teams |- align=left | 1996\u201397 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 5 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Shell Stanlow || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Halton || No relegation |- | 1997\u201398 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 7 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Moore || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Vulcan || No relegation |- | 1998\u201399 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 6 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Halton || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Runcorn ||No relegation |- | 1999\u201300 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 7 || Orrell Anvils || Capenhurst || Lucas Merseyside, Mossley Hill |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0; font-size:smaller; text-align:center;\"| Green backgrounds are promotion places. |} ===South Lancs/Cheshire 4 (2000-2009)=== Northern league restructuring by the RFU at the end of the 1999-2000 season saw the cancellation of North West 1, North West 2 and North West 3 (tiers 7-9). This meant that South/Lancs Cheshire 4 became a tier 10 league. The creation of South Lancs/Cheshire 5 meant that there was briefly relegation into that division until it ceased at the end of the 2000\u201301 season. South Lancs/Cheshire 4 was itself cancelled at the end of the 2008\u201309 season with the majority of teams transferred into South Lancs/Cheshire 3. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left;\" |- |colspan=\"11\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\"| {| border=\"0\" style=\"width:100%;\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" |- | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| | style=\"border:0;\"|South Lancs/Cheshire 4 | style=\"width:20%; border:0;\"| |} |- ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:80px;\"|Season ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:50px;\"|No of Teams ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:175px;\"|Champions ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:175px;\"|Runners\u2013up ! style=\"background:#efefef; width:150px;\"|Relegated Teams |- align=left | 2000\u201301 || style=\"text-align: center;\"|10 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Orrell Anvils || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Bowdon || No relegation |- | 2001\u201302 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Prenton || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Liverpool Collegiate || No relegation |- | 2002\u201303 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Manchester Wanderers || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Halton || No relegation |- | 2003\u201304 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Sale FC || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Oswestry || No relegation |- | 2004-05 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Mossley Hill || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Oxton Parkonians || No relegation |- | 2005\u201306 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 12 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Prenton || Trentham || No relegation |- | 2006\u201307 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 12 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Eagle || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Trentham || No relegation |- | 2007\u201308 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Marple || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Knutsford || No relegation |- | 2008\u201309 || style=\"text-align: center;\"| 10 || West Park Warriors || style=\"background:#d8ffeb;\"| Linley || No relegation |- | colspan=\"15\" style=\"border:0; font-size:smaller; text-align:center;\"| Green backgrounds are promotion places. |} ==Number of league titles== *Orrell Anvils (2) *Prenton (2) *Eagle (1) *Halton (1) *Manchester Wanderers (1) *Marple (1) *Moore (1) *Mossley Hill (1) *Sale FC (1) *Shell Stanlow (1) *West Park Warriors (1) ==Notes== ==See also== * Cheshire RFU * Lancashire RFU * English rugby union system * Rugby union in England ==References== ==See also== * English Rugby Union Leagues * English rugby union system * Rugby union in England 7 ",
