    "text": "Ghostly Haunts was an American horror-suspense anthology comic book series published by Charlton Comics from 1971 to 1978. The book was \"hosted\" by Winnie the Witch, a \"moddish\" blue-skinned witch. Ghostly Haunts was part of a wave of new horror and suspense comics published by Charlton during this period. Its sister titles, with many of the same creators, were the Charlton anthologies The Many Ghosts of Doctor Graves (with host Dr. M. T. Graves), Ghostly Tales (with host Mr. L. Dedd, later I. M. Dedd), Ghost Manor (with host Mr. Bones), Haunted (with hosts Impy and then Baron Weirwulf), and Scary Tales (with host Countess R. H. Von Bludd). Although Charlton's low page-rates and slapdash production values typically resulted in few notable characters or stories;Frye, Todd. \"Ghost Manor,\" Pop-cult.com (2008). Accessed April 2, 2011. Ghostly Haunts featured some memorable stories in the old EC Comics vein, especially in its later issues (one theory for this being that the Charlton line was so obscure that it often evaded the eye of the Comics Code Authority censors).HyperDave. \"Hey ho!
