    "text": "Norway was represented by Odd B\u00f8rre, with the song \"Stress\", at the 1968 Eurovision Song Contest, which took place on 6 April in London. \"Stress\" originally finished second in the 1968 Melodi Grand Prix on 3 March, but was promoted to the Norwegian entry when the winning song \"Jeg har aldri v\u00e6rt s\u00e5 glad i noen som deg\" was withdrawn from the contest by its composer amid persistent allegations that it plagiarised the 1963 hit \"Summer Holiday\" by Cliff Richard - who was the United Kingdom's singer in the 1968 contest. This is the only occasion on which the MGP winner did not go forward to Eurovision. == Before Eurovision == === Melodi Grand Prix 1968 === The final was held at the studios of broadcaster NRK in Oslo, hosted by Jan Voigt.
