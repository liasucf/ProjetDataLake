    "text": "The Philippine twenty-peso coin (\u20b120) is an upcoming denomination coin of the Philippine peso. This coin will be the highest coin denomination upon the release of this coin. ==History== New Generation Currency Series: In July 2019, the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) announced that the 20 peso note will be changed into a coin due to the overuse of the banknote, since each individual note only lasts a year in circulation whereas a 20 peso coin but would last for 10 to 15 years even if it costs more to manufacture. The decision is based on a research by the University of the Philippines. In September 2019, the \u20b120 coin was finally designed, with BSP Governor Benjamin Diokno mentioning that the design would retain Manuel L. Quezon as the person on the obverse, that the coin would be bi-metallic with a bronze-plated steel outer ring and a nickel-plated steel center and that it will be slightly bigger than the P10 coin. He also mentioned there would be other features making it distinct from the other New Generation coins. Photos of the new coin were released on 17 December 2019, along with the \"enhanced\" 5 peso coin, confirming their designs. The coin was initially planned to be released in late 2019 or early 2020, and in another 17 December report, it was reported that 500,000 coins of the new denomination were released, with more to be minted in 2020. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! !New Generation Currency Series (2019\u2013present) |- !Obverse |200px |- !Reverse |200px |} ==References== Category:Currencies of the Philippines Category:Coins of the Philippines Category:Twenty-base-unit coins ",
