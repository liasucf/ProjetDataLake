Le Vieux de '37 (French for \"The Old Man of '37\") is the name under which is known an illustration by Henri Julien created in approximately 1880 to illustrate Le vieux patriote, a poem from Louis Fr\u00e9chette. It depicts a participant of the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837 and 1838 which sought to make of Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) a democratic republic independent from the British Empire. It is nowadays one of the best known symbols of the Rebellion. It was used by the Front de lib\u00e9ration du Qu\u00e9bec upon pamphlets and communiqu\u00e9s during the 1960s and the year 1970. Some contemporary Patriote flags are flanked with them in their center. == See also == *Declaration of Independence of Lower Canada *Upper Canada Rebellion *History of Quebec *Timeline of Quebec history *Quebec independence movement Category:Lower Canada Rebellion Category:Quebec art ",
