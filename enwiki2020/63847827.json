    "text": "The State of Maine Armory (now Portland Regency Hotel & Spa) is an historic building in Portland, Maine's Old Port District. The State of Maine Armory was designed by prominent local architect Frederick A. Tompson and built in 1895 for use by the Maine National Guard. Upon its opening, the then-Mayor of Portland James Phinney Baxter said \"The possession of quarters in a prominent place, where the men would always be under the public eye, would be the means of improving the morale of the force.\" In 1941, the National Guard abandoned the building but it was used to house troops during World War II as well as a recreation center. After the war, the structure was used as a warehouse until it was converted into the current hotel in 1987. It is a member of Historic Hotels of America. ==References== Category:Hotels in Portland, Maine Category:Armories in Maine Category:Infrastructure completed in 1895 Category:1895 establishments in Maine ",
