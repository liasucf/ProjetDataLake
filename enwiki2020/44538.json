    "text": "The Kids in the Hall is a Canadian sketch comedy troupe formed in 1984, consisting of comedians Dave Foley, Kevin McDonald, Bruce McCulloch, Mark McKinney, and Scott Thompson. Their eponymous television show ran from 1989 to 1995 on CBC in Canada, and CBS, HBO, and Comedy Central in the United States. The Kids made one film, Brain Candy, which was released in 1996. They reformed for various tours and comedy festivals in 2000. They later reunited for an eight-part miniseries, Death Comes to Town, in January 2010. An eight-episode revival season was greenlit for Amazon Prime in 2020. Their name came from Sid Caesar, who, if a joke did not go over, or played worse than expected, would attribute it to \"the kids in the hall\", referring to a group of young writers hanging around the studio.For years this was erroneously attributed to Jack Benny, though the Kids themselves offer a corrected version of the origin of the troupe's name on the DVD release of the show's pilot episode. On June 3, 2008, it was announced that the entire group would receive a star on Canada's Walk of Fame.The Kids Are Back! Amazon Prime Video to Bring Back \u201cThe Kids in the Hall\u201d With New Episodes March 16, 2020, MovieDebuts On March of 2020 it was announced that the TV series would make a comeback with new episodes for Prime Video. The series will feature the return of all of the original \u201cKids\" in an 8-episode run, which will be a continuation of the original show, and is heralded as \"the first Canadian Amazon Original series\". ==Early history== Bruce McCulloch and Mark McKinney were working together doing Theatresports in Calgary, performing in a group named \"The Audience\". Norm Hiscock, Gary Campbell, and Frank Van Keeken were co-members and later became writers on the show. At the same time, Dave Foley and Kevin McDonald were performing around Toronto (along with Luciano Casimiri) as The Kids in the Hall (KITH). In 1984, the two pairs met in Toronto, and began performing regularly as KITH, with a rotating band of members, including Paul Bellini for a short time. When Scott Thompson was invited to join in January 1985, the group had its final form. The same year, McCulloch and Foley appeared in the Anne of Green Gables series, as Diana Barry's husband and a former classmate of Anne's from the fictional Queen's College, respectively. Not long afterwards, the Kids broke up for a short time when scouts for Saturday Night Live invited McKinney and McCulloch to New York to become writers for that show, Foley made a poorly received movie debut with High Stakeshttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091202/ and Thompson and McDonald worked with the Second City touring group. They were reunited in 1986. After SNL's Lorne Michaels saw them perform as a troupe, plans began for a TV show. In 1987 Michaels sent them to New York to what was essentially a \"Comedy Boot Camp\", and in 1988 their pilot special aired on CBC Television and in the United States on HBO before debuting as a series in 1989. ==Television show== The series The Kids in the Hall debuted as a one- hour pilot special which aired on HBO and CBC Television in 1988,\"Kids flaunt comic courage\". Toronto Star, November 29, 1988. and began airing as a regular weekly series on both services in 1989.\"The Kids in the Hall\". Calgary Herald, September 8, 1989. The regular series premiered July 21, 1989 on HBO, and September 14 on CBC. In the United States, the first three seasons were on HBO before it moved to CBS in 1993, where it stayed for two more seasons airing late Friday nights. CBC aired the show for the whole duration of its run. ==Brain Candy== After the show ended its run, the troupe came together to produce a movie, Brain Candy, featuring a few characters from the show and many new ones. Although not a commercial success, the movie developed a cult following with their devoted fans. ==Tours== ===2000 North American Tour=== In 2000, the troupe reformed for a successful North American tour, reprising many sketches from the show. The sketch line-up for the 2000 show was: # AT & Love Reunion # Mr. Heavyfoot Finds His Seat # Buddy Cole \u2013 The Year 2000 # Cops! # Daddy's Dyin' # Head Crusher / Face Pincher # Jesus 2000! # Sir Simon Milligan & Hecubus in: The Pit of Ultimate Darkness # Gavin: Painting a chair # Comfortable # Sandwich People # Chicken Lady's Date # Power of the Suburbs # Bloody Salty Ham # Monologue by Brian on having a party when Fran and Gordon go on Vacation # Love Me # Fran: Brian's Bombshell # Jesus Christ Superstar # Encore: To Reg At some shows: # Running Faggot # The Poker Game The tour was chronicled in a documentary, Kids in the Hall: Same Guys, New Dresses, which followed the next year.

The Just For Laughs show premiered around 90 minutes of new material. While certain characters made reappearances (Buddy Cole, Mr. Tyzik and McKinney and McCulloch's \"smooth-talking\" salesmen) the rest of the show revolved around entirely new material. Typically good-humored, the group poked numerous jokes at their own recent weight gain and the state of their post- Kids acting careers. Among the sketches: * The Kids plan a new show. For the opening they decide to rape McDonald to the theme from Footloose. * Salesmen (McCulloch and McKinney) promote a device which can siphon fat from the American gut and use it to power SUVs. * \"Carfuckers\": a group of mechanics who share a \"love for which there is no name\". The sketch was produced by an internet studio called \"60Frames Entertainment\".Car Fuckers Video By 60Frames Entertainment * Gavin encounters Jehovah's Witnesses (one of two sketches recreated from the television show). * Foley and McDonald get drunk; Foley tells McDonald he has created a time machine with which he can \"defeat last call\". * Foley travels back in time to receive oral sex from his wife (McCulloch), who would only perform the act on his birthday. * Foley travels back in time to kill Hitler (Thompson) but instead accidentally inspires his anti-semitism. * Two exceptionally literate rat-catchers (McCulloch and McKinney) look for a used futon. * Buddy Cole speculates that Jesus was homosexual. * Kathy (McCulloch) and Cathy (Thompson) reunite for lunch in a restaurant, where Kathy extols the virtues of \"tweeking\" with methamphetamine. * Foley is approached by a \"fan\" (Thompson) while waiting for the subway. * A McCulloch monologue about how skinny Nicole Richie is. * Foley and McCulloch fight over an imaginary girlfriend. * The Chicken Lady has phone sex (one of two sketches recreated from the television show). * The relationship woes of a gay couple (Foley and Thompson) are placated with the help of another married gay couple known as Peter and the Professor (McDonald and McKinney). * Superdrunk: a superhero who stops crimes by drinking (McCulloch), assisted by his trusty sidekick, the bartender (Foley). * The show finished with Mr. Tyzik (McKinney) mocking the mannerisms and careers of each member of the troupe, after which he promptly crushed their heads. The group also performed on January 26\u201327, 2008 at the SF Sketchfest. On January 26 there was a retrospective and Q&A; with the group. ===2008 North American Tour=== On April 4, 2008, The Kids in the Hall embarked on their first major national tour in six years. The tour ran through early June 2008 and included more than 30 cities in the US and Canada. The tour features some material from the 2007 \"Just for Laughs\" performance along with new material.Kids in the Hall announce 2008 tour by Sara Miller for Paste Magazine The 2008 tour closely mirrored the \"Just for Laughs\" performance, excluding the rat catchers, subway fan and Nicole Ritchie sketches. In their stead, Mark McKinney performed the monologue titled \"The Modern Hero\" from Season 1 of the show, and the entire cast performed the sketch \"This Is How I Danced in Tenth Grade.\" ==Other appearances== Kevin McDonald guest starred alongside Dave Foley in a 1997 episode of Foley's sitcom NewsRadio.

He played technology guru (and germaphobic) Barry Ditmer, a parody of Steve Jobs. He was planning to develop mind control so that the world's populace would buy the next useless gadget he would bring to market. However, thanks to Elise and Dan's intervention (after his new computer broke and couldn't get it fixed due to Ditmer's plan interfering), and his former partner Hiram (who had his part of the company stolen from him by Barry, and met Dan and Chris while they were stranded, eventually trying to murder them) invading, his plan is foiled and his complex blows up. Ironically, Chris is played by fellow member Dave Foley, but their characters never interacted. In October 2012 and January 2013, Foley guest-starred on The Middle as Dr. Fulton (Brick's school therapist) in episodes \"Bunny Therapy\" (2012) and \"Life Skills\" (2013).During \"Life Skills\", Foley's character refers to Brick's (Atticus Shaffer) classmates as \"the kids in the hall\" (following an awkward pause and glance by both characters) and mentioned their behavior similar to those of comedy sketches from The Kids in the Hall.
