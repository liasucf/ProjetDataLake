    "text": "Blue Dawn-Blue Nights is the final studio album by trumpeter/composer Wallace Roney which was released on the HighNote label in 2019.Jazz Depot: HighNote discography accessed May 1, 2020 ==Reception== Allmusic's Matt Collar said \"Blue Dawn-Blue Nights, finds the trumpeter collaborating with a cadre of young lions and balancing dusky after-hours warmth and propulsive post-bop modalism. ... Somewhat of a departure from Roney's past work, Blue Dawn-Blue Nights features songs written by his bandmates, along with a handful of deftly curated covers. The result is a surprisingly cohesive album that benefits from each player's unique yet clearly like-minded point-of-view\". JazzTimes reviewer, Mike Joyce, stated \"Given what we\u2019ve long known about his remarkable artistry and output, is it any wonder that Wallace Roney\u2019s latest CD is worth acquiring for its deep soulfulness alone? On this outing the trumpeter delivers the goods upfront, ... Even so, you won\u2019t find Roney lingering in the spotlight for long here. He and drummer Lenny White, who appears on four tracks, seem more interested in guiding the ensemble than leading it, allowing plenty of space for a rotating lineup\".Joyce, M.
