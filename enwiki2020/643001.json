    "text": "(German, literally means 'liver cheese'; sometimes spelled Leberk\u00e4s or Leberka(a)s in Austria and the Swabian, Bavarian and Franconian parts of Germany and Fleischk\u00e4se in Saarland, Baden, Switzerland and Tyrol), is a specialty food found in the south of Germany, in Austria and parts of Switzerland, similar to bologna sausage. It consists of corned beef, pork and bacon and is made by grinding the ingredients very finely and then baking it as a loaf in a bread pan until it has a crunchy brown crust. ==History== Fleischk\u00e4se is said to have been invented in 1776, although this story has been heavily contested. The name \"Leberk\u00e4se\" literally translates to \"liver- cheese\" but developed by folk etymology from an archaic form of the word Laib (\"loaf\") and K\u00e4se (\"cheese\") (cf. English \"head cheese\"); not all products bearing the name necessarily contain liver or cheese, let alone both: According to German food laws, only products called \"Bavarian Leberk\u00e4se\" are allowed not to contain liver; otherwise, there must be a minimum liver content of 4%. Some local variants must contain even more liver; for example, the liver content of \"Stuttgarter Leberk\u00e4se\" must be at least 5%. The type without liver is normally called Fleischk\u00e4se (meat cheese) if it is not made in Bavaria. ==Methods of eating== Leberk\u00e4ssemmel Leberk\u00e4se is traditionally enjoyed in a variety of ways, including: *Most of the time it is served hot on a semmel (hard wheat flour bread roll) and traditionally seasoned with mustard or pickles. The result, generally called Leberk\u00e4sesemmel (in Swabia and the Franconian parts of Bavaria, Leberk\u00e4sweckle, Leberk\u00e4sweggla or LKW in short), is a staple of South-German and Austrian fast food stalls, butcher shops and supermarkets. *Cut into approximately finger-thick slices, usually served with traditionally medium hot mustard or Bavarian sweet mustard or sometimes ketchup and accompanied by soft pretzels, Sauerkraut or Kartoffelsalat (potato salad). *Pan-fried (abgebr\u00e4unt or gebraten, \"browned\"), in which case it is commonly accompanied by a fried egg and German potato salad, or Bratkartoffeln (home fries) and sometimes spinach. This is a very common Biergarten dish. *Cold, cut into very thin slices and used on a variety of sandwiches, usually seasoned with pickled cucumbers. *Two slices of Leberk\u00e4se with a slice of ham and cheese in the middle are dipped into eggs and coated with breadcrumbs and then fried in the pan. This variant is called falsches Cordon Bleu (\"mock Cordon Bleu\"). ==Preparation== Due to Leberk\u00e4se being so widespread in Germany and Austria there are varying ingredients depending on the region. However, the most common ingredients are some form of lean pork, pork belly and ice. Several herbs and spices are also included such as coriander, ginger as well as salt and pepper. A Curing salt is also used typically Prague Powder #1, this gives the Leberk\u00e4se a pinkish hue. These ingredients are then blended in a food processor to a smooth consistency, this is then placed into a loaf pan and cooked through until the top has a brown, crusty texture. ==Variants== Pizzaleberk\u00e4se Known variants include: * K\u00e4seleberk\u00e4se, which adds small pieces of evenly distributed cheese to the mix * Paprika Leberk\u00e4se, which adds small pieces of pickles and bell peppers * Pizzaleberk\u00e4se, which adds cheese, cut bell peppers, pickles and small cubes of salami, named for its similarity to pizza. * Pferdeleberk\u00e4se (German Pferd = horse), which is indeed made of horse meat, otherwise not widely consumed in the German language area. Popular in Vienna, Austria. * Zwiebelleberk\u00e4se (German Zwiebel = onion), which is made with onions. Common in the Swabian and Franconian regions of Germany. In addition, many butchers have invented their own unique varieties. ==See also== Category:German sausages Category:Bavarian cuisine Category:Cooked sausages Category:German words and phrases ",
