    "text": "In string theory, a model used in theoretical physics, a compact dimension is curled up in itself and very small (usually Planck length). Anything moving along this dimension's direction would return to its starting point almost instantaneously, and the fact that the dimension is smaller than the smallest particle means that it cannot be observed by conventional means. Extra dimensions in a theory which are made compact are said to have undergone compactification. ==See also== * Extended dimension * T-duality * Kaluza\u2013Klein theory * Dilaton * Higher-dimensional supergravity * Transformation optics * String theory#Tenth dimension * Dimensional reduction * Majoron * Universal extra dimension * Seven-dimensional space * Topological string theory * Vertex operator algebra * Scalar\u2013tensor theory * G2 manifold * Six-dimensional space * Canonical quantization * Superstring theory * Supersymmetry * Supergravity * Topological order * Harmonic superspace * F-theory * String duality * Spacetime * Moduli space * E8 lattice * Brian Greene * Theory of everything Category:String theory ",
