    "text": "RTQ is an Australian television station broadcasting in regional Queensland in Australia. The network was owned by Star Television, before being purchased by the WIN Corporation on 5 October 1988. ==Network history== WIN Television Queensland started out as Darling Downs Television Limited in 1959, which was launched as a television network in 1962 as Queensland's first regional TV station, DDQ-10, broadcasting to the Darling Downs area for the first time. SDQ-4 for the Southern Downs soon launched in 1964, and DDQ-5 was next to air later (it would later change frequencies to 5A) for Toowoomba viewers.50 years in the Darling Downs, Television.AU, 13 July 2012. Retrieved 19 October 2016 Rockhampton station, RTQ-7, was launched by Rockhampton Television Ltd on 7 September 1963 to serve viewers in Rockhampton and its suburbs. Between 1968 and 1971, RTQ's viewing audience across Central Queensland considerably increased with the installation of transmitters at Cracow, Blackwater and Gladstone. RTQ-7 began colour transmissions on 1 March 1975.Rockhampton: History of City& District, Lorna McDonald, Second Edition, 1995 Prior to aggregation, RTQ-7 produced a considerable amount of local content with programs such as The Morning Show, Feminine Touch, Claire's Corner, Wedmaier's Walkabout, Seven Days, Holiday Fun & Games, Racing Roundup and its local news service all being presented from the studio in North Rockhampton. The other programming aired by RTQ-7 was \"cherry-picked\" by station management from all three metropolitan networks. Until the 1980s, Darling Downs TV sometimes supported the Nine Network and QTQ-9, its Brisbane station, by broadcasting its newscasts on relay. However, the station switched sympathies to Network Ten and TVQ-0 in the early part of the decade, supporting its programs and broadcasting TVQ-0's Eyewitness News on relay. It was part of the Great Eastland Television network in 1975\u20131987, together with NRN NRTV 11-8 Television and NEN 9-8 Television (both in New South Wales) as GET 10-4-5a. In 1976, Darling Downs TV became the first regional TV network in Australia to adopt electronic news gathering for its news service within a year after it became a color station. This was the same case for RTQ during those years as after having been a Nine News broadcaster, switched news affiliations with the Seven Network and BTQ's local newscasts via microwave relay. Due to its purchase of Ten Brisbane (TVQ-0) in 1987 and its move to Channel 0 the next year (as Vision TV) to give way to the new Brisbane Ten (TVQ-10), it suddenly became Queensland's strongest regional TV network, even after its TVQ selloff, bringing Ten programs and Eyewitness News (later Brisbane Ten News) to the Darling Downs and Southern Downs. DDQ-10 became DDQ-0 on 10 September 1988 and its network name became Vision TV. Reflecting this was a reformat of its newscasts and news studio to that of Ten's. RTQ-7 also by then began broadcasting Ten programs in Rockhampton, after its previous commitment to BTQ-7's programs, Seven National News and State Affair. By 1989, DDQ/SDQ joined the aggregation race, becoming Star Television. RTQ joined the network in mid-1990 and thus merged it with the Darling Downs stations. Star Television was then purchased by WIN Television, then as a Ten affiliate for the state as it had already been decided that TNQ/FNQ (QTV 7-10) would be the Nine affiliate. However, prior to aggregation, a deal with Nine was reached with Star TV's owners WIN Television which aligned Star TV Queensland with WIN's existing affiliation with Nine in southern NSW. This decision effectively overturned Nine's prior arrangements with QTV, which struggled with complexity of the last minute decision, but eventually joined Network Ten as its affiliate in Nine's place. The shock exchange of affiliation came within a week before aggregation took effect.Queensland TV stirred up by aggregation, Television.AU, 30 December 2010. Retrieved 19 October 2016 On New Year's Eve 1990, it became WIN Television Queensland on the first day of statewide aggregation, with the network's Rockhampton facilities used to produce local editions of WIN News newscasts across some markets every day, including the Toowoomba edition. New transmitting stations were also built in Townsville, Mt. Stuart, Cairns, Mackay and Maryborough in time for statewide broadcasts even before Star TV turned to the Nine Network as its affiliate, even as parts of the news service were done in Coffs Harbour in NSW, part of a failed plan to bring both Star TV and NRTV, the Ten partner for Northern NSW, together as one network for viewers in their respective areas. In 1998, when WIN Television decided to introduce a Sunshine Coast edition of WIN News, the network decided to once again use the DDQ studio at the Toowoomba station to produce news bulletins. From then on, the studio was used by Toowoomba-based newsreaders to read bulletins for both Toowoomba and the Sunshine Coast, while the RTQ studio in Rockhampton continued to produce bulletins for the Rockhampton, Townsville and Cairns regions. Those arrangements continued until WIN Television introduced additional bulletins for both the Wide Bay-Burnett and Mackay regions in 2010. The RTQ studio in Rockhampton was then used to produce bulletins for the Rockhampton, Mackay, Cairns and Sunshine Coast regions, while the DDQ studio in Toowoomba was used for the presentation of the local Toowoomba, Wide Bay-Burnett and Townsville bulletins.WIN adds Mackay, Wide Bay, David Knox, TV Tonight, 1 April 2009. Retrieved 19 October 2016 In December 2011, RTQ's analogue signals in regional Queensland were turned off as part of the switchover to digital television.What a turn-off for Rocky, The Morning Bulletin, 6 December 2011. Retrieved 19 October 2016. In May 2012, WIN Television closed its news production studios in Rockhampton and once again ceased using the Toowoomba station for news production, making Rockhampton-based weather presenter Peter Byrne and Toowoomba sports presenter Pat O'Shea redundant. WIN Television centralised all news production to its new Sunshine Coast studio facilities. After relocating the remaining staff to an office in the Rockhampton CBD, WIN Television abandoned the former RTQ site in North Rockhampton in late 2012, a site which was once WIN Television's administrative and technical headquarters for the network in Queensland. As the old building lays dormant, it has succumbed to vandals with a quarter of the building sustaining damage when a suspicious fire broke out at the site in June 2016.Police investigating suspicious north Rockhamptoon blaze, Matty Holdsworth, The Morning Bulletin, 18 June 2016.

Retrieved 19 October 2016. In 2016, WIN Television switched to Network Ten after strained affiliation relations with Nine which ended WIN and Nine's 27-year partnership and their 25-year partnership for regional Queensland. With RTQ returning to Ten affiliation after 25 years on 1 July 2016, the switch effectively reversed the 1990 decision as TNQ returned to being the Nine Network regional partner for regional viewers in Queensland. Due to the affiliation switch, WIN Television's news service was required to be rescheduled from 7p.m. where it previously aired following Nine News Queensland, to its more traditional timeslot of 6p.m. where it is now sandwiched between Ten Eyewitness News and The Project. ==Programming== WIN Television broadcasts its programming from Network 10, including their regional signals of TEN, 10 Peach and 10 Bold. WIN also broadcasts news, current affairs and sport programs such as Studio 10, Ten Eyewitness News First at Five, The Project and Ten Sport throughout this region. ==WIN News== WIN News produces regional news bulletins for five of the seven regional markets covered by RTQ \u2013 (Sunshine Coast & Maroochydore), (Rockhampton & Central Queensland), (Cairns & Far North Queensland), (Toowoomba) and (Townsville & North Queensland). Reporters and camera crews are based in newsrooms throughout the regions of the Sunshine Coast, Rockhampton, Cairns, Wide Bay, Toowoomba and Townsville. All bulletins were produced from WIN's studios in Maroochydore, however production has moved to WIN's Wollongong headquarters in July 2017. Between April 2009 and May 2015, the network also produced a local news service for Mackay and the Whitsundays.WIN TV Mackay, Mildura in shock closures, tvtonight.com.au, 22 May 2015 In June 2019, The Network also axed the Wide Bay-Burnett Bulletin. ===Main anchors=== Sunshine Coast, Rockhampton, Cairns, Toowoomba, Townsville, Wide Bay *Lincoln Humphries ===Sports presenters=== Sunshine Coast, Rockhampton, Cairns, Toowoomba, Townsville, Wide Bay *Melissa Russell ===Weather presenter=== *Hayley Francis ===Reporters=== Sunshine Coast *Corinne May (Chief of Staff) *Hayley Francis *Hayley Wright *Sam Okely * Prentakosta (Sport) Rockhampton/Central Queensland *Andrea Crothers (Chief of Staff) *Lily Greer * *Tim Klinger (Sport) Cairns/Far North Queensland *Laura Gardiner (Chief of Staff) *Cameron Tragardh (Sport) Bundaberg/Wide Bay *Eve Sharpe (Chief of Staff) *Katie Wong Hoy *Paige Ashby *Tom Adam (Sport) Toowoomba/Darling Downs *Caitlin Crowley (Chief of Staff) *Stacey Silver *Maggie Raworth *Bronte Latham *Keiran Wagstaff (Sport) Townsville/North Queensland * * *Madison Williams *Tim Morgan (Sport) ==Main transmitters== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse\" | Region served | City | Channels (analog/ digital) | First air date | ERP (analog/ digital) | HAAT (analog/ digital)1 | Transmitter coordinates | Transmitter location |- style=\"vertical- align: top; text-align: left;\" | Cairns | Cairns | 39 (UHF)6 12 (VHF) | 31 December 1990 | 400 kW 50 kW | 1176 m 1190 m | | Mount Bellenden Ker |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Darling Downs2 | Toowoomba | 0 (VHF)3 6 46 (UHF) | 13 July 1962 | 300 kW 500 kW | 485 m 520 m | (analog) (digital) | Mount Mowbullan |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Mackay | Mackay | 39 (UHF)6 35 (UHF) | 31 December 1990 | 1300 kW 360 kW | 612 m 630 m | | Mount Blackwood |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Rockhampton | Rockhampton | 7 (VHF)6 12 (VHF) | 7 September 1963 | 200 kW 50 kW | 523 m 523 m | | Mount Hopeful |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Southern Downs4 6 | Warwick | 42 (UHF)5 6 43 (UHF) | 26 February 1966 | 600 kW 500 kW | 301 m 301 m | | Passchendaele Ridge |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Townsville | Townsville | 40 (UHF)6 41 (UHF) | 31 December 1990 | 200 kW 200 kW | 617 m 644 m | | Mount Stuart |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" | Wide Bay | Maryborough | 39 (UHF)6 10 (VHF) | 31 December 1990 | 1000 kW 60 kW | 646 m 646 m | | Mount Goonaneman |- style=\"vertical-align: top; text-align: left;\" |} Notes: *1.
