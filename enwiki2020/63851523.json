    "text": "Cinando is an online database of film projects and professional networking and streaming service for film industry personnel and companies run by the March\u00e9 du Film of the Cannes Film Festival. Attendees of the March\u00e9 and some other film markets are granted one-year access to the service. ==History== Cinando was launched by the March\u00e9 du Film in 2003 as cannesmarket.com, based on the March\u00e9's Guide, a directory of attendees created in 1996. It was renamed Cinando in 2007. Since 2012, Cinando runs a business-to-business video-on- demand service. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the streaming service was utilized to hold screenings in a virtual version of the Cannes March\u00e9 in 2020. Since 2017, Cinando allows its users to upload, search for, and buy subtitles for films with no additional fee. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Online film databases Category:French film websites Category:French social networking websites Category:Professional networks Category:Internet properties established in 2003 Category:Video on demand services Category:Subscription services ",
