    "text": "The Calderonista Invasion of Costa Rica was a small rebellion carried out in North-West Costa Rica by forces loyal to the disgruntled former president Rafael Calder\u00f3n, and was supported by the Government of Nicaragua who were unhappy with the election of Jose \"Pepe\" Figueres Ferrer to the Costa Rican Presidency two years prior. ==Beginning== The rebellion started when forces loyal to former president Rafael Calder\u00f3n, who were backed by the Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza Garc\u00eda, crossed the border from Nicaragua into Costa Rica. Venezuelan dictator Marcos P\u00e9rez Jim\u00e9nez provided financial support to the rebels and, reportedly, air support. The rebel forces seized the border town of Villa Quesada on 12 January. ==Resolution== The Costa Rican government appealed to the Organization of American States to investigate. The Organization of American States found the Nicaraguan government was supporting the rebels and as soon as this was announced, the Nicaraguan government ended its support of the rebels. The United States sold Costa Rica four fighter planes, while the rebels were overwhelmed by the popularly backed government forces. After some fierce fighting in a handful of northern towns, the rebels were pushed out of Costa Rica. == References == Category:History of Costa Rica Category:Conflicts in 1955 Category:1955 in Costa Rica Category:Wars involving Costa Rica Category:Civil wars involving the states and peoples of North America ",
