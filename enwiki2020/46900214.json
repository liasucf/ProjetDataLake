In 2011, the Oklahoma Supreme Court awarded Riley a commission to create an eagle sculpture, 28 feet in height, in the atrium of the supreme court building. ==Biography== As a four-year-old child, Riley's family would visit Fr. Gregory Gerrer's museum on the campus of St. Gregory's University In Shawnee, Oklahoma. He credits these experiences as having a significant impact on his artistic career, specifically his exposure to Tutu the mummy, the taxidermy animal collection and the African mask collection. Riley studied at East Central University for two years from 1959 to 1961. He finished his bachelor's degree at University of Oklahoma in 1962. He later completed his master's degree at University of Oklahoma in 1972. In 2010, the Ford Center commissioned Riley to design and create a mask as a gift for Lady Gaga. Riley purchased a copy of her biography and watched her music videos for inspiration for his design. ==Exhibitions== *\"Magical Mystery Masks: The Art of G.
