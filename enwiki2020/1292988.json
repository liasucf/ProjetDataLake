    "text": "Like a Rock is the thirteenth studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Seger, released in 1986 (see 1986 in music). The title track is best known for being featured in Chevrolet truck commercials throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. \"Fortunate Son\" is a live cover of the 1969 Creedence Clearwater Revival hit, recorded March 31, 1983 at Cobo Hall in Detroit. It was originally available only as the B-side of the \"American Storm\" single, and was added as a bonus track to the CD release of the album. The vinyl version ends with \"Somewhere Tonight\". The song \"Miami\" is featured in an episode of the TV series Miami Vice. This is the first studio album credited to \"Bob Seger & the Silver Bullet Band\" that doesn't feature the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section replacing the Silver Bullet Band on any tracks. Despite having sold upward of three million US copies, it has never been certified above Platinum status. ==History== The album was originally going to be named American Storm after the first track and was going to be released in December 1985, but it was delayed and the name was changed.Billboard, November 2, 1985 __NOTOC__ ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Silver Bullet Band=== *Bob Seger \u2013 acoustic guitar, guitar, piano, vocals *Craig Frost \u2013 organ, synthesizer, piano, keyboard *Chris Campbell \u2013 bass *Alto Reed \u2013 baritone saxophone, tenor saxophone ===Additional musicians=== ;Guitars *Dawayne Bailey \u2013 acoustic guitar, guitar, electric guitar on \"Like a Rock\" *Pete Carr \u2013 guitar on \"American Storm\" *Dann Huff \u2013 guitar on \"Sometimes\" *Fred Tackett \u2013 acoustic guitar, guitar on \"The Ring\" \"Sometimes\" \"Somewhere Tonight\" *Rick Vito \u2013 acoustic guitar, guitar, electric guitar, slide guitar on \"Like a Rock\" \"Miami\" \"The Ring\" \"Tightrope\" \"The Aftermath\" \"Somewhere Tonight\" ;Drums & Percussion *John Robinson \u2013 drums on all tracks except: *Russ Kunkel \u2013 drums on \"American Storm\" \"Like a Rock\" *Gary Mallaber \u2013 drums on \"The Ring\" *Paulinho da Costa \u2013 percussion on \"Miami\" \"The Aftermath\" \"It's You\" ;Keyboards *Bill Payne \u2013 synthesizer, piano, keyboard on all tracks except \"Tightrope\" *David Cole \u2013 synthesizer on \"It's You\" ;Horns *Gary Grant \u2013 trumpet on \"Miami\" *Gary Herbig \u2013 saxophone on \"Miami\" *Jerry Hey \u2013 trumpet on \"Miami\" \"The Aftermath\" \"Sometimes\" *Kim Hutchcroft \u2013 saxophone on \"Miami\" \"Sometimes\" *Bill Reichenbach Jr. \u2013 trombone on \"Miami\" \"The Aftermath\" \"Sometimes\" *Marc Russo \u2013 saxophone on \"Miami\" \"The Aftermath\" \"Sometimes\" *Ernie Watts \u2013 saxophone on \"Miami\" \"The Aftermath\" \"Sometimes\" ;Additional vocals *Laura Creamer \u2013 background vocals on \"Tightrope\" \"The Aftermath\" \"It's You\" \"Somewhere Tonight\" *Mark Creamer \u2013 background vocals on \"Tightrope\" \"The Aftermath\" \"It's You\" *Donny Gerrard \u2013 background vocals on \"Tightrope\" \"The Aftermath\" \"It's You\" \"Somewhere Tonight\" *Don Henley \u2013 background vocals, harmony vocals \"Miami\" *Shaun Murphy \u2013 vocals & background vocals on \"Tightrope,\" background vocals on \"The Aftermath\" \"Somewhere Tonight,\" harmony vocals on \"Sometimes\" \"It's You\" *Timothy B.
