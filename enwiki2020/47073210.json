    "text": "Sun City Music Festival is an annual electronic music festival held over Labor Day weekend in El Paso, Texas at Ascarate Park. In its opening year, the festival was held at Cohen Stadium. The festival represents all genres of electronic music, bringing top international DJs and live acts from multiple countries along with local producers and radio personalities to three stages, one of them being the Beatport Stage. The festival was founded by SMG Events and Disco Donnie Presents. On May 9, 2018, it was announced through the Sun City Music Festival Twitter account that the festival would not be happening. ==History== === 2011-2017 === In its inaugural year in 2011, an estimated 20,000 people attended to see artists Armin van Buuren, Afrojack, Wolfgang Gartner, Martin Solveig, and many others. In 2012, SCMF, as it is commonly known by attendees, moved to Ascarate Park. It has remained at Ascarate Park until its last occurrence in 2017. === 2018 - present: Hiatus === On May 2018, it was announced that Sun City Music Festival would not be held but that there were hopes of coming back in 2019. There was never a reason cited for why the festival was canceled, with SCMF's announcement only saying, \"...the Disco and SMG teams work diligently to ensure every single time you enter the gates of Sun City Music Festival, the best possible experience awaits you. Throughout the calendar year, the SCMF team works extremely hard to meet this momentous task with rigorous standards in place. Unfortunately, we don\u2019t believe that goal can be accomplished in 2018.\" As of August 2020, the last update on the festival was by Disco Donnie stating: \"*SCMF - its [sic] complicated *Starting A New Festival During a Pandemic - its [sic] complicated...
