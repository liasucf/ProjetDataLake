The company is a fully owned subsidiary of Terra Mauricia Ltd (Terra ex Harel Freres) founded in 1838. The company is the leader in the production of spirits derived from sugarcane in Mauritius. Their New Grove rums and extra neutral spirit are manufactured by their sister company, namely Grays Distilling Ltd.while the commercial branch, Grays Inc. Ltd markets and distributes their brands in Mauritius and in export markets. Additionally Grays Inc is a leading importer and distributor of wines and spirits from the world over into Mauritius and has further diversified into the distribution and marketing of Personal Care, Fragrances, Pharmaceuticals, Home Care and Snacks amongst other consumer goods. ==History== The company origins date back to 1931. As part of its diversification strategy, Harel Fr\u00e8res (now Terra) acquired the Mauritius OK Distillery and moved its installations to Solitude, Triolet. In 1971, the Mauritius OK Bottling was founded to add value to spirits distilled by its sister company. The aim was to better serve the Mauritian market, and distribution was handled by Harel Mallac. In 1978 Harel Mallac and Harel Fr\u00e8res created a 50% JV, Hamarel to focus on the marketing of their brands. In 1982. Harel Freres bought Harel Mallac's shares in Hamarel creating Grays & Co Ltd, rebranded their portfolio of products and launched new Brands. In 2004 Grays created a 50% joint-venture, Les Chais de l\u2019Isle de France with Quartier Fran\u00e7ais to produce super premium rums, namely New Grove. In 2006 Grays Ltd opened 26% of its share capital to Distell. This operation gave birth to Grays Inc and a wide portfolio of brands to distribute in Mauritius. Finally in 2011 with the rebranding of Harel Fr\u00e8res to Terra, Grays & Co Ltd was rebranded to Terra Brands, and Grays Refinery was rebranded Grays Distilling. Grays Inc kept its identity as the commercial branch of Terra. ==Distillery== The distillery was created in 1931 when Harel Fr\u00e8res bought the Mauritius OK Distillery. In 1939, with the difficulties of the WW2, the island had problems importing petroleum products and the distillery produced fuel as a substitute.Terra E-Book http://www.terra.co.mu/media/10934/ebook_terra_pdf_lr3.pdf The plant was later renovated to produce rum and other spirits. In 1980 a brand new distillery was built in Beau Plan and The Mauritius OK Distillery was renamed Grays Refinery. This investment significantly increased quality and volumes. Grays Refinery was one of the three last standing distilleries on Mauritius, with the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Distillation de Bois Rouge in Saint Andr\u00e9 and the Medine Distillery in Bambous.Massel, Hugh Barty-King, Anton (1983).
