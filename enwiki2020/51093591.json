    "text": "BandArt is an independent Spanish orchestra made up of musicians from more than a dozen different countries. Its artistic director is Gordan Nikoli\u0107, concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra. == History == BandArt, born in 2005 within Spanish festival of Lucena Cordoba. It is an independent orchestra formed by musicians of whom many are members of some of the most prestigious orchestras in Europe. The Serbian Gordan Nikoli\u0107, soloist and concertmaster of the London Symphony Orchestra and artistic director of the Netherlands Chamber Orchestra, is the art director and soul of BandArt. The name \u201cBandArt\u201d was chosen because it captures perfectly the orchestra\u2019s talent and aspirations. \"Band\" comes from the Spanish word bandas, traditional wind ensembles, still strongly alive in many localities in Spain where local people of all generations meet regularly to socialize and play music of all styles, from Zarzuela to Bizet, driven by a folkloristic, popular enthusiasm. \"Art\", where the musical language and musician\u2019s instincts are exposed to far more complex forms which call in their interpretation for much more elaborated nuances and deeper interdependence of all its elements. BandArt 's aim is to explore the possibilities of strengthening the links of those two worlds, the local and the universal, on the platform of great composer\u2019s music. BandArt has performed in the most prestigious festivals and concert series in Spain, including the Ciclo de Ibermusica, Ciclo Palau 100 (Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana) conducted by Sir Colin Davis, Ciclo Sinf\u00f3nico de la Fundaci\u00f3n Caja Madrid, Peralada Festival performing Orfeo ed Euridice by Gluck with La Fura dels Baus, (DVD recording for Cmajor Label), Artes no Camino festival and El Escorial Festival, with the support of Patrimonio Nacional. They have also performed in the Palau de la M\u00fasica de Val\u00e8ncia and in the Auditorio Nacional de M\u00fasica, Madrid. In July 2016 BandArt performed Mozart\u00b4s Idomeneo at the Ludwigsburger Schlossfestspiele in a production by the Ludwigsburg Festival and the refugees\u2019 German association Zuflucht Kultur e.V. == Special characteristics == BandArt is an orchestra without the conductor usual figure in the stage so it requires a deep interaction and hard team work by its members.They keep a special attention and that\u2019s when \u201cwith side by side work upper bounds are achieved\".This leads to play on numerous occasions standing up, generating a feel and energy close to rock and roll and establishing strong emotional bonds with the public.This can be appreciated by attending any of their concerts and also in the documentary BandArt, filmed by Iv\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s. It has been said that BandArt \"is an example of the rejuvenation of classical music in its symphonic version and develops another way of playing\". ==Recordings== Several BandArt interpretation had been recorded: Orfeo ed Euridice by Christoph Willibald Gluck had been performed by BandArt and La Fura dels Baus at Castell de Peralada\u2019s Festival in 2011. It was recorded by Unitel Classical, available in DVD and also in YouTube. Ludwig van Beethoven Piano Concert No. 4 in G major, BandArt Orchestra with Javier Perianes, piano; Gordan Nikolic, concertmaster; were recorded at the National Auditorium of Music in Madrid for Los cl\u00e1sicos the TV program of classical music on RTVE in 2008. Ludwig van Beethoven Symphony No. 7 in A major (Opus 92), BandArt Orchestra; Gordan Nikolic, concertmaster; were recorded at the National Auditorium of Music in Madrid for Los cl\u00e1sicos the TV program of classical music on RTVE in February 2008. The documentary \u201cBandArt\u201d by Iv\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s shows how the orchestra works. ==Social activities== Social integration through the arts is a vital part of their activities. Due to this social vocation, from its foundation to the present, members of the ensemble have taken part in a number of activities with refugees, in prisons, retirement homes, disability associations, schools(working especially with children with risk of social exclusion) and hospitals. In order to develop these projects, BandArt has been supported by Teatro Real, Fundaci\u00f3n Don Juan de Borb\u00f3n, Fundaci\u00f3n ONCE, Patrimonio Nacional and Zuflucht Kultur, within others. ==References== ==External links== *Official website BandArt Orchestra Category:Spanish orchestras Category:Musical groups established in 2005 ",
