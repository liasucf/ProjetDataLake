Hafez's international appeal led to several invitations to speak at various media outlets, including radio stations such as KPBS, KPFK, KPFA, UC Berkeley Radio and NPR in the United States. Broadcast interviews include a 9-minute on CNN\u2019s Live From with Kyra Phillips (29 March 2006), BBC World Service's program, The Ticket with Mark Coles (4/26/06), a live appearance on the Fox Channel (10 March 2006), and an exclusive on ABC News, following a recent New York City performance. In 2007, the Rumi Symphony Project, which is Hafez's most passionate and ambitious undertaking to date, culminated in a major work to celebrate the 800th anniversary of Rumi's birth. Deepak Chopra translated Rumi's poems for Nazeri's recording and wrote an introduction to the work.https://huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/09/hafez- nazeri_n_4994095.html The project was premiered in Los Angeles where it received nine standing ovations. ==Rumi Symphony Project: Untold== In March 2014, Nazeri released Rumi Symphony Project: Untold, a chart-topping album featuring 42 Grammy Award-winning musicians.http://edition.cnn.com/2014/07/14/world/meast/iran-musician-hafez- nazeri-rumi-poetry-peace-and-love/index.html The result of over 5000 hours of recording studio work, Untold is an attempt to represent the splendor of all creation. Steeped in both the improvisatory tradition of his native Iran and Western classical music\u2019s rich harmonic structures, Nazeri takes a boundary- crossing approach, balancing the two and forging a \u201cnew sonic universe\u201d altogether.http://www.wonderingsound.com/feature/hafez-nazeri In the words of the composer, \"Untold is the first cycle of my Rumi Symphony Project and portrays the story of our universe from the dawn of time until the very end, through my eyes.

By adding two lower-pitched strings, Nazeri enriched the sound of the instrument (traditionally played in a monophonic fashion), allowing it to play both harmonic and melodic roles within its extended range.https://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/hafez-nazeri/ ==Released works== *Rumi Symphony Project: Untold (2014), Cycle 1, with Shahram Nazeri and the Rumi Ensemble.
