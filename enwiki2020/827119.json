    "text": "Mary Elizabeth Coleridge Mary Elizabeth Coleridge (23 September 1861 \u2013 25 August 1907) was a British novelist and poet who also wrote essays and reviews.Mary Elizabeth Coleridge \u2013 Poems, Biography, Quotes She wrote poetry under the pseudonym Anodos, taken from George MacDonald; other influences on her were Richard Watson Dixon and Christina Rossetti. Robert Bridges, the Poet Laureate, described her poems as 'wonderously beautiful\u2026 but mystical rather and enigmatic'.Phillips, Catherine, 'Robert Bridges' Oxford University Press, Oxford 1992 == Biography == Mary Coleridge was the daughter of Arthur Duke Coleridge. With the singer Jenny Lind, her father was responsible for the formation of the London Bach Choir in 1875. Other family friends included Robert Browning, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, John Millais and Fanny Kemble. She was the great-grandniece of Samuel Taylor Coleridge and the great niece of Sara Coleridge, the author of Phantasmion. Coleridge travelled widely throughout her life, although her home was in London, where she lived with her family. She taught at the London Working Women's College for twelve years from 1895 to 1907. She completed five novels. Her first was The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus, which Chatto & Windus published in February 1893 as by M. E. Coleridge. At least one newspaper noted it as \"a new story by Mr M. E. Coleridge\".\"Books of the Week\", The Scotsman, 20 February 1893, p. 2 (no review). The story is not related to the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus legend; it features a modern Brotherhood which takes that name. Edward Arnold published the other four novels. The best known is The King with Two Faces, which earned her \u00a3900 in royalties in 1897. Coleridge died of complications arising from appendicitis while on holiday in Harrogate in 1907, leaving an unfinished manuscript for her next novel and hundreds of unpublished poems. Eight of her poems, including \"The Blue Bird\" (originally published in 1897 under the French title \"L'Oiseau Bleu\"), were set to music for chorus by Charles Villiers Stanford, and three poems including \"Thy Hand in Mine\" were set by Frank Bridge. A family friend, the composer Hubert Parry, also set several of her poems as songs for voice and piano. And Cyril Rootham (an erstwhile pupil of Stanford and Parry) set four of her poems for solo voice and orchestra, though when published in 1913 the songs were rewritten for voice and piano. Coleridge's poetry was first published under her own name in the posthumous Poems (1908). In the preface to this volume, Henry Newbolt wrote: ==Published works== *The Seven Sleepers of Ephesus.
