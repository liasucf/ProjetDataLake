These individuals include Don Cheadle, an Oscar-nominated actor using his celebrity status to draw attention to the issue, as well as Adam Sterling, a 24-year-old waiter and activist urging Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger to sign a bill to keep California funds from investing in companies with interests in Sudan, and Luis Moreno-Ocampo, the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands. Then there's the ones actually situated in Darfur: Hejewa Adam, a woman whose baby was beaten to death by Janjaweed attackers who now fights in the Sudanese Liberation Army; Ahmed Mohammed Abakar, a displaced builder and farmer who now serves as leader and head sheikh of a camp of 47,000 other displaced Darfurians; and Pablo Recalde, leader of the World Food Program in West Darfur. ==See also== *Eyes and Ears Of God \u2013 Video surveillance of Sudan, a 2012 documentary film *Nuba Conversations, a 2000 documentary film *Sri Lanka's Killing Fields, a 2011 documentary film *War in Darfur ==References== ==External links== * Darfur Now at MySpace * * * * * Category:2007 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films alleging war crimes Category:Documentary films about the War in Darfur Category:2007 documentary films Category:Documentary films about refugees Category:Participant Media films Category:Films scored by Graeme Revell ",
