    "text": "Andrew Newell (born 13 November 1865, date of death unknown) was an Australian cricketer. He played twenty-five first-class matches for New South Wales between 1889/90 and 1899/00. Newell, a right-arm off-spin and medium-pace bowler, was the most successful bowler in Sydney grade cricket in 1892-93, when he took 60 wickets for Glebe at an average of 5.43. At the end of that season he took 6 for 25 and 4 for 27 for New South Wales in a low-scoring match against Queensland that Queensland won by 17 runs. His best innings figures for New South Wales were 8 for 56 against Victoria in 1897-98. In November 1907 Newell was living with his wife in the Sydney suburb of Woollahra and working as a clerk in the Postal Department. He had been receiving medical treatment for a nervous condition, and had had to take a break from playing cricket, when he disappeared while walking his dogs. He was assumed to have died, but in early 1911 a friend in Sydney received a letter from him, sent from Valparaiso, Chile, where he had been living for some time under an assumed name. ==See also== * List of New South Wales representative cricketers ==References== ==External links== * Category:1865 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Australian cricketers Category:New South Wales cricketers ",
