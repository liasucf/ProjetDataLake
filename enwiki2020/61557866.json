He was the son of William Gordon and Sarah (n\u00e9e Walker) Gordon. ==Career== In 1846, Gordon began his career in the office of Reid, Irving and Company in Liverpool. In 1849 he sailed to America to work for the firm Maitland, Phelps & Company in New York City. In 1853, he was admitted into the partnership of the firm and remained there until 1884 before returning to England with the intention of retiring. Once in London, the American banker Junius Spencer Morgan, head of J. S. Morgan & Co. in London, sought out Gordon and requested he join the bank. Gordon agreed and began working there on January 1, 1885. During his fifteen year career with the firm, he worked directly with Walter Hayes Burns, J. Pierpont Morgan, J.P. Morgan Jr., and Walter Spencer Morgan Burns. In 1895, profits were divided such that Pierpont and Burns each took 40% of the profits with Gordon the remaining 20%. He returned for the second time in April 1900, at which time Clinton Edward Dawkins, the former financial member of the Viceroy of India's Council, was admitted to the partnership. Gordon became a member of the Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York in 1852, becoming a life member in 1864. He served as manager, second vice- president and as president, three times, from 1864 to 1865, from 1869 to 1798 and, again, from 1873 to 1876. He was also member of the Junior Carlton Club in London, the Century Association in New York, and the Downtown Club, where he served as the first president from 1860 to 1862.. ===Metropolitan Museum of Art=== An Old Clearing, by Alexander Helwig Wyant, 1881.

In 1898, he purchased Eastman Johnson's 1881 painting, The Funding Bill directly from the artist, which he also donated to the Museum. The painting featured Robert W. Rutherford, a relative of the painter, and Samuel W. Rowse, an artist, discussing a bill in Congress about the refunding of the national debt. In 1912, he donated Sanford Robinson Gifford's Tivoli (produced on commission for Gordon in 1870) and Alexander Helwig Wyant's An Old Clearing to the Museum. ==Personal life== The Contest for the Bouquet: The Family of Robert Gordon in Their New York Dining-Room by Seymour Joseph Guy, 1866.
