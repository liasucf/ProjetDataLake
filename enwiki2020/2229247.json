    "text": "\"Summer of '69\" is a song recorded by the Canadian musician Bryan Adams, from his fourth album, Reckless. The song is about a dilemma between settling down or trying to become a rock star. The song was written by Adams and Jim Vallance, a long-time writing partner of Adams. \"Summer of '69\" was produced by Adams and Bob Clearmountain. It was released in June 1985 under A&M; Records as the fourth single from Reckless. \"Summer of '69\" is an up-tempo rock song. According to later claims by Adams, the title is a reference to the sex position not the year, but Vallance disputes this.https://uproxx.com/music/is-bryan-adams-summer-of-69-about-what-you- think-it-is/ The song was released with two B-side tracks: \"Kids Wanna Rock\" and \"The Best Was Yet to Come\", which had previously appeared on the albums Reckless and Cuts Like a Knife respectively. \"Summer of '69\" received favourable reviews from music critics. The single had a strong effect on music charts internationally, with its highest peak being number four in the Netherlands, and its least successful charting country being Germany. The track was promoted with a music video, which was filmed by Steve Barron. The video features Adams and his backing band in a variety of settings, including running from the police. ==Conception and themes== After a tour supporting his album Cuts Like a Knife, Adams immediately started the recording sessions for the new album, Reckless. \"Summer of '69\" was finished on January 25, 1984, co- written with Jim Vallance in his basement studio. The song went through a number of changes because neither Adams nor Vallance was convinced it was a strong enough song to be featured on the album. In their first draft, the lyric \"summer of '69\" appeared only once. At that time the two were planning to title it \"Best Days of My Life\" instead. While the lyric \"Best days of my life\" appeared seven times in the first draft, on the final draft it had been replaced by \"summer of '69\" and appeared only two times throughout the song. When writing the lyrics \"Jimmy quit, Jody got married\", Vallance suggested using \"Woody quit and Gordy got married\", referring to members of his high school band, but Adams liked his version better. Adams mentioned once in an interview that \"Jimmy\" was one of his early drummers. \"Jody\" is a reference to Adams' sound manager, Jody Perpick, who got married during the album's recording session. On the song's very first demo, it started with a 12-string riff, just like the breakdown section in the middle of the song, but they replaced it with a chunky 6-string intro on the second demo. The song was recorded three to four times, in different ways, with both Adams and Vallance still not convinced that it was finished. When Adams appeared on The Early Show in 2008, he was asked about \"Summer of '69\" and its lyrical meaning. Adams said the song was not about the summer of 1969 but about sex and making love in the summertime. \"69\" is a reference to the sexual position 69. Also available in video form at Vallance, however, has gone for the more conventional interpretation of the title being a reference to a year. He notes Jackson Browne's \"Running on Empty\", which contains references to 1965 and 1969, as his own influence, and recalls Adams citing the film Summer of '42 as his.\" However, Vallance stated on the Song Facts message board that \"When we recorded the demo in my basement, towards the end of the song Bryan sang a little naughty bit: 'me and my baby in a \u201969'. We had a laugh about it at the time, and Bryan decided to keep it when he did the final recording a month or two later.\"Is Bryan Adams\u2019 \"Summer Of \u201969\" About What You Think It Is? > That song is 25 years old now so it's had that many years to incubate.
