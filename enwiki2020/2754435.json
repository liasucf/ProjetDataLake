    "text": "Peter Stoyanovich (born April 28, 1967 in Dearborn Heights, Michigan) is an American football placekicker of Macedonian descent. His father Mijalce and his mother Slobodanka are from Ljubojno, North Macedonia. He played with the Miami Dolphins, Kansas City Chiefs and briefly the St. Louis Rams in the NFL. He attended college at Indiana University where he played both football and soccer. A first-team all-pro in 1992, Stoyanovich finished his career in the top 35 in NFL history in all kicking categories. He led the NFL in scoring in 1992. His game-tying 58-yard field goal in a 1991 Wild Card playoff set a record for the longest field goal in NFL playoff history, which has since been tied by Graham Gano in 2018. Stoyanovich served as the kicking double for Sean Young in Ace Ventura, Pet Detective. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" !colspan=2 | !colspan=3 | Field Goals !colspan=2 | P.A.T. ! |- !Year !Team !Made !ATT !PCT !Made !ATT !Points |- |1989 || Miami || 19 || 26 || 73.1 || 38 || 39 || 95 |- |1990 || Miami || 21 || 25 || 84.0 || 37 || 37 || 100 |- |1991 || Miami || 31 || 37 || 83.8 || 28 || 29 || 121 |- |1992 || Miami || 30 || 37 || 81.1 || 34 || 36 || 124 |- |1993 || Miami || 24 || 32 || 75.0 || 37 || 37 || 109 |- |1994 || Miami || 24 || 31 || 77.4 || 35 || 35 || 107 |- |1995 || Miami || 27 || 34 || 79.4 || 37 || 37 || 118 |- |1996 || Kansas City || 17 || 24 || 70.8 || 34 || 34 || 85 |- |1997 || Kansas City || 26 || 27 || 96.3 || 35 || 36 || 113 |- |1998 || Kansas City || 27 || 32 || 84.4 || 34 || 34 || 115 |- |1999 || Kansas City || 21 || 28 || 75.0 || 45 || 45 || 108 |- |2000 || Kansas City || 2 || 4 || 50.0 || 15 || 15 || 21 |- |2000 || St. Louis || 3 || 5 || 60.0 || 11 || 11 || 20 |- !colspan=2|Total || 272 || 342 || 79.5 || 420 || 425 || 1236 |} ==References== * Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:American football placekickers Category:Indiana Hoosiers football players Category:Kansas City Chiefs players Category:Miami Dolphins players Category:Sportspeople from Dearborn, Michigan Category:People from Livonia, Michigan Category:St. Louis Rams players Category:Players of American football from Michigan Category:American people of Macedonian descent ",
