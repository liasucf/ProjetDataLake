There is some confusion as to if this was Sabine Pass that he had previously written about or an intended city to the south.

The US claimed jurisdiction down the Sabine River to the Gulf of Mexico and Texas claimed it ended at the Sabine River delta. By 1838 the U.S. assigned the revenue cutter USRC Woodbury (1837) to patrol the Sabine Lake as part of the Gulf of Mexico patrol. By 1844, the Republic of Texas had the Santa Anna patrolling the area. There was one instance that could have led to war between the United States and the Republic of Texas. The Santa Anna had instructed two schooners loading cotton to stop at the custom house to pay a tonnage fee. The customs house had two cannons and when the schooners attempted to run the customs port the agent fired a warning shot across the bow of each ship and then six more as an attempt to sink them. Both schooners weighed anchor and settled the matter. === Community name === The name of the community evolved over time from City of Sabine, to Sabine City, and then to Sabine Pass. Although requested in 1839, and there was a steam lumber mill in the community in 1846, a post office was not established until 1847, as the Sabine City Post Office. In 1841, William Kennedy, in The Rise, Progress and Prospects of the Republic of Texas (published in London in 1841), mentioned the settlement of the area and wrote, \"Taylor's creek, a small stream that enters Sabine Bay from the west, a few miles above the city of Sabine ...\", By not capitalizing \"city\" it appears that the city was named Sabine. No records indicate that the settlement was ever called just \"Sabine\" so this might have been referring to the name of the place as \"City of Sabine\".city of \"Sabine\" or \"City of Sabine\"?- Retrieved 2013-09-18 There is reference that General J.

After hurricanes in 1886, 1900, 1915, and the devastating Hurricane Audrey in 1957, economic development moved north from Sabine Pass to the cities of Beaumont, Port Arthur, and Orange, which still dominate the area's economy today. On September 24, 2005, Hurricane Rita came ashore over Sabine Lake\u2014the surge from the storm destroyed more than 90% of the structures in Sabine Pass. In February 2006, the team from Extreme Makeover: Home Edition (EM: HE) visited the town and rebuilt the Firehouse (which included a new Firetruck worth $400,000), the High School Auditorium and gave dozens of families $350 gift cards from Sears to replace items such as clothes, space heaters, blankets etc., lost due to Hurricane Rita.
