Wolf, The structure of compact Ricci-flat Riemannian manifolds. J. Differential Geom. Volume 10, Number 2 (1975), 277-288. are Riemannian manifolds whose Ricci curvature tensor vanishes. Ricci-flat manifolds are special cases of Einstein manifolds, where the cosmological constant need not vanish. Since Ricci curvature measures the amount by which the volume of a small geodesic ball deviates from the volume of a ball in Euclidean space, small geodesic balls will have no volume deviation, but their \"shape\" may vary from the shape of the standard ball in Euclidean space. For example, in a Ricci-flat manifold, a circle in Euclidean space may be deformed into an ellipse with equal area. This is due to Weyl curvature. Ricci-flat manifolds often have restricted holonomy groups. Important cases include Calabi\u2013Yau manifolds and hyperk\u00e4hler manifolds. ==Applications== In physics, Ricci-flat manifolds represent vacuum solutions to the analogues of Einstein's equations for Riemannian manifolds of any dimension, with vanishing cosmological constant. ==Further reading== * Matthew Randall, Almost Projectively Ricci- flat Manifolds, Dept. of Mathematics, University of Auckland, 2010. == See also == *Einstein manifold *Flat manifold *Quaternion-K\u00e4hler manifold *Weyl tensor ==References== Category:Riemannian manifolds ",
