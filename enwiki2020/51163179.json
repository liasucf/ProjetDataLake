    "text": "__NOTOC__ Gawler Ranges Conservation Park (formerly the Gawler Ranges Conservation Reserve) is a protected area in the Australian state of South Australia on the Eyre Peninsula located about north-west of the town centre in Poochera. The conservation park is located to the south-west of the Gawler Ranges with the majority of its area being located within the gazetted locality of Bockelberg and with a smaller portion being located in the locality of Minnipa to the south. The conservation park's name was originally approved by the Geographical Names Board as the Bockelberg Conservation Park but \"due to legal processes\", it was not constituted under the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972 and was subsequently declared under the state's Crown Lands Act 1929 as the Gawler Ranges Conservation Reserve on 11 November 1993. Its name is derived from its \u201cproximity\u201d to the Gawler Ranges. As of 2006, it was intended that the conservation reserve would be incorporated in the Gawler Ranges National Park. It was eventually \u2018redesignated\u2019 as the Gawler Ranges Conservation Park on 6 September 2012. Flora found within the conservation park was described in 2001 as consisting of \u201cTree mallee dominated by Eucalyptus oleosa Red Mallee and Eucalyptus brachycalyx Gilja with scattered patches of Eucalyptus gracilis Yorrell.\u201d The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area. ==See also== *Protected areas of South Australia *Gawler (disambiguation) ==References== ==External links== *Entry for Gawler Ranges Conservation Park on Protected Planet Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1993 Category:1993 establishments in Australia Category:Eyre Peninsula ",
