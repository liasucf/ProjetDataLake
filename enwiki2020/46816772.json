    "text": "R-19 regional road () (previously part of M-9 highway) is a Montenegrin roadway. This road will be a parallel road to section of Bar\u2013Boljare motorway from Mate\u0161evo to Andrijevica. As of 2017, no work has been done on this section. ==History== The M-9 highway was officially opened for traffic in 1984. It was built as part of the larger M-9 highway within the Yugoslav highway network, spanning Montenegro, Kosovo and Serbia. It connected Kola\u0161in and Andrijevica with Pe\u0107 and Pri\u0161tina in Kosovo, and Leskovac and Pirot in Serbia. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the segment between Murino and Pe\u0107 was closed during the Kosovo War in 1999. In 2010, work began on asphalting 10 kilometres of the road between Murino and \u010cakor, with the intention of reopening the road for vehicular traffic. An additional 12 kilometres of road was planned to be asphalted between \u010cakor and the Kosovar border. The M-9 highway originally flowed through the city of Kola\u0161in to connect it to the M-2 highway. A bypass was built via the Vlado\u0161 Bridge to merge the M-9 with the M-2. On 27 March 2014, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs officially realigned the M-9 highway to its current alignment, incorporating the Vlado\u0161 Bridge, while downgrading the M-9's former path through Kola\u0161in as a municipal road. In January 2016, the Ministry of Transport and Maritime Affairs published bylaw on categorisation of state roads. With new categorisation, R-19 highway was created, from part of previous M-9 highway. ==Major intersections== ==References== R-19 ",
