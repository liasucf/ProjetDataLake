    "text": "The Fight on \u010celopek () or Battle on \u010celopek (Bitka/\u0411\u0438\u0442\u043a\u0430) was fought at the \u010celopek plateau near Kozjak between the Serbian Chetnik Organization, a Serbian rebel faction, and Ottoman officers accompanied by Ottoman Albanian bashi-bozuks, on April 16, 1905. ==Background== After the fights in Tabanovce, Savatije Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Lazar Kujund\u017ei\u0107 and Aksentije Bacetovi\u0107-Baceta left their offices as organizators of the action, wanting to feel the Chetnik lifestyle \"from within\" as voivodes. Baceta was to replace the then Chief of Upper Staff, Ilija Jovanovi\u0107. Baceta and Savatije Milo\u0161evi\u0107, by mid-April, had moved 107 fighters across the border. ==Fight== At dawn on Holy Saturday (), the two large bands (Cheta) -- Belgrade and Kragujevac -- arrived at the village of Dubo\u010dica. There, they were awaited by the bands of Ilija Jovanovi\u0107, Lazar Kujund\u017ei\u0107, \u010ci\u010da-Pavle Mladenovi\u0107 and Ljubomir Jezdi\u0107. The Kragujevac Band was led by captain (kapetan) Borko Pa\u0161trovi\u0107 and had the sub-lieutenants (potporu\u010dnici): Vojin Popovi\u0107-Vuk, Du\u0161an Jezdi\u0107, Petar Todorovi\u0107 and Du\u0161an Putnikovi\u0107. The Belgrade Band was led by Baceta, and included Savatije Mihailovi\u0107, officers (oficiri) Jani\u0107ije Mi\u0107i\u0107, Bogdan Jugovi\u0107 Hajnc, Vojislav Tankosi\u0107, Branivoj Jovanovi\u0107 and non-commissioned officers (podoficiri) Jovi\u0107, Radul Kosovac, Novica Leovac, Rado\u0161 Vasiljevi\u0107, Trajko and Radivoje Ili\u0107. They were also accompanied with the bands of Stevan Nedi\u0107 and Doksim Mihailovi\u0107, which had been returned to western Povardarje after vacationing in Belgrade. On , at the heights of \u010celopek, around 120 chetniks under the command of voivodes Doksim, \u010ci\u010da-Pavle, Baceta, Kujund\u017ei\u0107, Pa\u0161trovi\u0107, Skopljan\u010de, Tankosi\u0107 and Dovezenski fought a uniformed Ottoman army accompanied by Albanians from the surrounding villages. During the battle \u010ci\u010da-Pavle took the \u010celopek heights and thus prevented the encirclement of the bands from the Albanian bashi-bozuks; overtaking the three peaks gave the chetniks a strategical advantage and after the victorious fight they made heavy losses to the Turks and Albanians (over 200 dead and wounded), while only having two dead (Petar Todorovi\u0107 and Radul Kosovac) according to Serbian sources,; while British Vice-Consul Wilfred Gilbert Thesiger claimed in a letter dated that fighting near Kumanovo 'the earlier day' had taken 4 Serbian officers' lives, and 8 captured. ==Aftermath== The victory enraged the Ottomans, who began manhunting the rebels. The rebels were forced to retreat across the border, and were dispersed. \u010ci\u010da-Pavle and Bacetovi\u0107 were surrounded by the Ottoman army near the village of Beljakovce (today's Kriva Palanka) on 16 June, and everyone in their bands were killed. On 21 January 1906, another fight took place in the same place, in which Vasilije Trbi\u0107 nearly lost his whole band (22 men) to the Ottomans. ==References== ===Sources=== * * * * Category:Battles of the Ottoman\u2013Serbian Wars Category:Military history of North Macedonia Category:1905 in the Ottoman Empire Category:1905 in Serbia Category:Conflicts in 1905 Category:Chetniks of the Macedonian Struggle Category:April 1905 events ",
