    "text": "The Battle of Mag Femen took place on 22 August 917 between the Vikings of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, led by Ragnall, a grandson of \u00cdmar, and the Irish of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, led by Niall Gl\u00fandub, High King of Ireland. It was one of two battles involving the U\u00ed \u00cdmair that year, the other being the Battle of Confey, which occurred as a result of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair trying to retake the Kingdom of Dublin which they had lost in 902. The battle began when Niall Gl\u00fandub's forces attacked a Viking army at a site identified by the annals as Topar Glethrach in Mag Femen. The Irish initially inflicted the majority of the casualties, but late in the day a host of more troops led by Ragnall reinforced the Viking army, securing victory for the U\u00ed \u00cdmair. ==Background== The ruling Vikings of Dublin, the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, had been expelled from the city in 902 by a joint force led by M\u00e1el Finnia mac Flannac\u00e1n, overking of Brega and Cerball mac Muirec\u00e1in, overking of Leinster.Downham, p. 26 However, this expulsion was temporary and Viking raids continued on Irish settlements. In 914 a large Viking fleet sailed to the previously Viking-controlled city of Waterford, and the following year more Vikings settled in Limerick, though Dublin itself remained outside U\u00ed \u00cdmair control.Downham, p. 31 In 917 two prominent members of the U\u00ed \u00cdmair, Ragnall and Sitric C\u00e1ech, grandsons of \u00cdmar, sailed separate fleets to Ireland, Ragnall landing at Waterford and Sitric C\u00e1ech landing at Cenn Fuait in Leinster.Downham, pp. 31, 273\u2013274 Several native Irish kings gathered forces to try to drive off the Vikings once more, including Niall Gl\u00fandub, overking of the Northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill and High King of Ireland, and Augaire mac Ailella, overking of Leinster. The Vikings met Niall Gl\u00fandub and the men of the U\u00ed N\u00e9ill in battle at Mag Femen in County Tipperary. ==The battle== According to the Annals of Ulster the army of Niall Gl\u00fandub marched south to war against the U\u00ed \u00cdmair and halted on 22 August at Topar Glethrach in Mag Femen. A force of Vikings was nearby, and the Irish began the battle by attacking that morning. The battle lasted until the evening, with around 100 casualties between the two sides, most of them on the Viking side. The tide was turned when a large number of reinforcements led by Ragnall arrived, and the Irish fled back to their camp.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 917 The Annals of the Four Masters give a similar but slightly different account of the battle. In that account one thousand one hundred men died in the battle, not one hundred, and it also says that the Irish fled the battle before the arrival of Ragnall. The Four Masters account also ennumerates several casualties not listed in the Ulster account: the chief of Cairrge Brachaidhe; M\u00e1el Finn\u00e9n mac Donnag\u00e1in, chief of \u00dai Cearnaigh; and Fergal mac Muirec\u00e1in, chief of U\u00ed Chreamhthainn.Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 917 Both accounts agree that after the battle a small force led by Niall Gl\u00fandub encamped against Ragnall's army for twenty nights. Niall sent word to Leinster that they should bring an army to lay siege to the Viking force. The Leinstermen did so, but their force was destroyed and their king Augaire mac Ailella was slain by the army of Sitric C\u00e1ech at the Battle of Confey.Annals of Ulster, s.a. 917; Annals of the Four Masters, s.a. 917 Augaire's death marked the end of effective opposition to the Vikings' return to Ireland. Sitric led his men on a triumphant return to Dublin, where he established himself as king, while Ragnall returned to England and soon became King of Northumbria. ==Notes== ==References== ===Citations=== ===Primary sources=== * * * ===Secondary sources=== * * * * * ==External links== * CELT: Corpus of Electronic Texts at University College Cork.
