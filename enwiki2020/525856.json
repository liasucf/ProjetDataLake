    "text": "The French National Museum of Natural History, known in French as the ' ('MNHN; ), is the natural history museum of France and a ' of Sorbonne Universities. The main museum is located in Paris, on the left bank of the Seine. It was established in 1635 by King Louis XIII as the royal garden of medicinal plants, and in 1793, after the Revolution, it was reorganized in its present form and under its present title. As of 2017, the museum has 14 sites throughout France, including the original location at the ', which remains one of the seven departments of MNHN. ==History== The museum was formally founded on 10 June 1793, during the French Revolution. Its origins lie, however, in the ' (royal garden of medicinal plants) created by King Louis XIII in 1635, which was directed and run by the royal physicians. The royal proclamation of the boy-king Louis XV on 31 March 1718, however, removed the purely medical function, enabling the garden\u2014which became known simply as the ' (King's garden)--to focus on natural history. For much of the 18th century (1739\u20131788), the garden was under the direction of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, one of the leading naturalists of the Enlightenment, bringing international fame and prestige to the establishment. The royal institution remarkably survived the French Revolution by being reorganized in 1793 as a republican ' with twelve professorships of equal rank. Some of its early professors included eminent comparative anatomist Georges Cuvier and evolutionary pioneers Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck and \u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint- Hilaire. The museum's aims were to instruct the public, put together collections and conduct scientific research. It continued to flourish during the 19th century, and, particularly under the direction of chemist Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul, became a rival to the University of Paris in scientific research. For example, during the period that Henri Becquerel held the chair for Applied Physics at the ' (1892\u20131908) he discovered the radiation properties of uranium. (Four generations of Becquerels held this chairmanship, from 1838 to 1948.) A decree of 12 December 1891 ended this phase, returning the museum to an emphasis on natural history. After receiving financial autonomy in 1907, it began a new phase of growth, opening facilities throughout France during the interwar years. In recent decades, it has directed its research and education efforts at the effects on the environment of human exploitation. In French public administration, the ' is classed as a ' of higher education.

The artifacts were sent (donated or possibly donated by force) to Juan Manuel de Rosas, the dictator of the Argentine Federation, whose support was required to establish a museum. Rosas, in an attempt to build alliances overseas, sent collected fossils to Jean Henri Dupotet, Rear Admiral of the French Navy. Dupotet then sent them to Paris. In France, the Mu\u00f1iz collection ended up in the National Museum of Natural History where they were studied by Paul Gervais. In 1762 Jean Baptiste Christophore Fus\u00e9e Aublet was sent to Cayenne in French Guiana, where he assembled a vast herbarium which allowed him to prepare his Histoire des plantes de la Guiane fran\u00e7oise, published in 1775 and including almost 400 copperplate engravings. When Fus\u00e9e Aublet died at Paris in 1778, he left his herbarium to Jean-Jacques Rousseau, though the latter possessed it for only two months before he too died. It was eventually acquired by the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle in 1953. During the French Revolution the Museum expanded its collection substantially by claiming objects from the cabinets of the aristocracy and from other institutions, such as the Royal Academy of Sciences and the \u00c9cole Royale V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaire d'Alfort. ==Mission and organization== The museum has as its mission both research (fundamental and applied) and public diffusion of knowledge. It is organized into seven research and three diffusion departments.Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle; official website The research departments are: * Classification and Evolution * Regulation, Development, and Molecular Diversity * Aquatic Environments and Populations * Ecology and Biodiversity Management * History of Earth * Men, Nature, and Societies, and * Prehistory The diffusion departments are: * The Galleries of the '''' * Botanical Parks and Zoos, and * The Museum of Man (') The museum also developed higher education, and now delivers a master's degree.Official website Main fa\u00e7ade of the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy. ==Location and branches== The museum comprises fourteen sites throughout France with four in Paris, including the original location at the ' in the 5th arrondissement (m\u00e9tro Place Monge). The galleries open to the public are the Gallery of Mineralogy and Geology, the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy, the Gallery of Botany, and the famous Gallery of Evolution ('). The Paleontology and comparative Anatomy Gallery is a 540 million year journey and one of the highlights of the museum. It starts with the famous fossils from the Paleozoic Era from 540 to 250 million years ago, such as the gigantic Dunkleosteus. The Mesozoic Era, 250 to 65 million years ago, marks the golden age of the dinosaurs such as the Diplodocus, Iguanodon, Carnotaurus, Triceratops. One contemporary of these animals was Sarcosuchus, a giant crocodile with terrifying teeth. The Mus\u00e9um's Menagerie is also located in the Jardin des plantes. The current Gallery of Botany, erected in 1935, is intended to preserve the vast herbarium of the museum. Referred to by code P, the herbarium includes a large number of important collections amongst its 8 million plant specimens. The historical collections incorporated into the herbarium, each with its P prefix, include those of Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck (P-LA) Ren\u00e9 Louiche Desfontaines (P-Desf.), Joseph Pitton de Tournefort and Charles Plumier (P-TRF). The bryophyte collection contains 900,000 specimens collected by notable bryologists including S\u00e9bastien Vaillant, Jean-Baptiste Mougeot, Camille Montagne, Wilhelm Philippe Schimper, \u00c9mile Bescherelle, Ir\u00e9n\u00e9e Th\u00e9riot, and Pierre Allorge.Bryophytes - Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle The designation at CITES is FR 75A. It publishes the botanical periodical Adansonia and journals on the flora of New Caledonia, Madagascar, and Comoro Islands, Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam, Cameroon, and Gabon. The ' is also in Paris, in the 16th arrondissement (m\u00e9tro Trocad\u00e9ro). It houses displays in ethnography and physical anthropology, including artifacts, fossils, and other objects.

Over the ensuing years the number of Chairs and their subject areas evolved, some being subdivided into two positions and others removed. The list of Chairs of the Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle includes major figures in the history of the Natural sciences. Early chaired positions were held by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Ren\u00e9 Desfontaines and Georges Cuvier, and later occupied by Paul Rivet, L\u00e9on Vaillant and others. ==In popular culture== The Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy and other parts of Jardin des Plantes was a source of inspiration for French graphic novelist Jacques Tardi. The gallery appears on the first page and several subsequent pages of ' (Ad\u00e8le and the Beast; 1976), the first album in the series of '. The story opens with a 136-million-year-old pterodactyl egg hatching, and a live pterodactyl escaping through the gallery glass roof, wreaking havoc and killing people in Paris (the Gallery of Paleontology and Comparative Anatomy returned the favor by placing a life size cardboard cutout of Ad\u00e8le and the hatching pterodactyl in a glass cabinet outside the main entrance on the top floor balcony). ==Directors== Alphonse Milne-Edwards, director of the museum at the end of the 19th century.
