The band name was created when one of its members heard a relative mention Gretna Van Fleet, a resident of Frankenmuth; their use of the variation on her name was done with her (subsequent) blessing.Greta Van Fleet Talk Classic Rock Influences, the Woman Behind the Band Name, More (Q1043 New York interview, published to YouTube on December 18, 2017) Van Fleet also stated in a later interview that while the band's music is not her type, she supports the band and thinks they are very talented. At the time Hauck was the drummer, the band recorded two songs: \"Cloud Train\" and \"Standing On\". Hauck left the band in October 2013 and was replaced as drummer by the brothers' good friend Danny Wagner the same year. The initial guitar riff for \"Highway Tune\" was cited by guitarist Jake Kiszka as being written as early back as 2010, but the song, released as a single in March 2017, was only recorded after Danny Wagner had become the band's new drummer. On February 28, 2014, a live EP was recorded in one take and subsequently released on June 7, 2014. In 2014, their song \"Standing On\" was featured in 2014 Chevy Equinox advertisements in the Detroit area. Danny Wagner playing at Rock im Park 2018 in Nuremberg, Germany \"Standing On\" is one of several songs, along with \"By the Riverside\", \"Cloud Train\", \"Down to the River\", \"Motown Funk No. 4\", \"Sing in the Rain\", \"Thunder Stomp\", and \"Written in Gold\", that were previously released but are currently unavailable. ===Black Smoke Rising and From the Fires (2016\u20132017)=== On January 17, 2016, the song \"Highway Tune\" was featured as a live performance by the band on the Showtime show Shameless. On March 31, 2017 the final recorded version of \"Highway Tune\" was released on iTunes as the band's first official single. On April 2, 2017, iTunes started streaming the song \"Highway Tune\". On April 18, 2017, the music video for the song \"Highway Tune\" was released exclusively on Loudwire. The band's debut EP titled Black Smoke Rising was released April 21, 2017. On April 21, 2017, Apple Music named Greta Van Fleet new artist of the week. The band toured with The Struts during May 2017. In October 2017, the band won Best New Artist at the Loudwire Music Awards. The band released an eight-song double EP titled From the Fires on November 10, 2017. In addition to the four tracks from Black Smoke Rising, From the Fires features the new recordings \"Edge of Darkness\" and \"Talk on the Street\", as well as covers of Sam Cooke's \"A Change Is Gonna Come\" and Fairport Convention's \"Meet on the Ledge\". The four new tracks were recorded in September 2017 at Rustbelt Studios in Royal Oak, Michigan and produced by Al Sutton and Marlon Young, the same duo that produced Black Smoke Rising. The band also released \"Safari Song\" as a single in October 2017. Greta Van Fleet opened for fellow Michigan native Bob Seger at the Dow Event Center in Saginaw, Michigan (just minutes from their hometown) on September 7. In November 2017, the band announced that they would begin recording their first full-length studio album shortly after the release of From the Fires, and that they expected its release by mid-2018. ===Anthem of the Peaceful Army (2018\u2013present)=== The group performed at Elton John's Academy Award Party on March 4, 2018 at the host's personal request. John joined Greta Van Fleet onstage for his \"Saturday Night's Alright for Fighting\" and their \"You're the One\". After the set Elton John recommended the band get more dramatic and flamboyant with their performance and wardrobe. On July 26, the band made their TV debut on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon performing \"When the Curtain Falls\", the first single off of their upcoming debut album. Their debut album, Anthem of the Peaceful Army, was released on October 19, 2018. According to Josh Kiszka, the name of the album \"Anthem of the Peaceful Army\" was taken from the title of a poem. It was the top selling album in its debut week in the US, selling 80,000 copies. Factoring in album equivalent units, it debuted at number three on the Billboard 200. In December 2018, the band was nominated for four Grammy Awards \u2013 Best New Artist, Best Rock Performance for \"Highway Tune\", Best Rock Song for \"Black Smoke Rising\", and Best Rock Album for From the Fires, the latter of which they won. On January 19, 2019, Greta Van Fleet appeared as the musical guest on American television comedy series Saturday Night Live, and performed the song \"Black Smoke Rising\" and second single from Anthem of the Peaceful Army \"You're the One\". A third single, \"Lover, Leaver\" was later released in May 2019. The band contributed \"Always There\", an outtake from the album, to the soundtrack of the film A Million Little Pieces. Jake and Sam Kiszka told New Musical Express magazine in an interview in July 2019 that they are working on a new album to put out in the coming year and that their musical style has evolved. On October 9, 2020, the band released a new single, \"My Way, Soon\", accompanied by a music video that was shot, edited and directed by the band. The song is expected to appear on their upcoming second album, which, according to Wagner, draws on the band's touring over the previous two years, and how it opened their eyes: \"We realized that while growing up, we had been shielded by a lot of things, we were unaware of a lot of things\". ==Musical style== Josh Kiszka performing at the Mercury Lounge on August 24, 2017. Greta Van Fleet's music has been categorized as hard rock and blues rock. Although all four members bonded over blues, each does have his own musical tastes: Jake gravitates towards rock and roll, Sam likes jazz, Danny prefers folk, and Josh likes world music. Jake said in an interview, \"that all three brothers had listened to their parents' vinyl which included blues and folk music.\" Sam stated that, \"It's not like we set out to be a rock and roll band, it's just that sound that comes out [when] we get together and play.\" Songwriting is done by the band as a whole after one of the four members finds the concept for a song. Danny stated that a lot of their songs are first written in a \"folk set up\" before evolving into something else. Greta Van Fleet are often compared to Led Zeppelin. Jake related that he \"... went through a year of really intensely studying what [Jimmy] Page did to the point I knew how he thought,\" but he has studied other classic rock guitarists in a similar manner, specifically mentioning Pete Townshend. Likewise, on his voice being compared to Robert Plant's, Josh said that Plant has certainly been an influence, \"though it's not what I was going for.\" Stating that he did not even know who Led Zeppelin was until high school, he explained that his singing style came out naturally one day while struggling to be heard over the rest of the band. In a March 2018 interview, Plant cited Greta Van Fleet as one of his favorite up-and-coming bands, saying \"they are Led Zeppelin I\" and describing Josh as \"a beautiful little singer.\" Some of Jake's guitar influences include John Lee Hooker, Elmore James, Bert Jansch, Eric Clapton and Keith Richards. Some of the drummers that inspired Danny are Carmine Appice, John Bonham, Mitch Mitchell and Michael Shrieve. Sam's favorite bass player is Motown session bassist James Jamerson. Josh Kiszka has imitated the movements and onstage antics of Joe Cocker. ==Members== Current *Josh Kiszka \u2013 lead vocals *Jake Kiszka \u2013 guitars, backing vocals *Sam Kiszka \u2013 bass guitar, keyboards, backing vocals *Danny Wagner \u2013 drums, backing vocals Former *Kyle Hauck \u2013 drums ==Discography== * Anthem of the Peaceful Army (2018) ==Awards== Fryderyk |- | 2019 || Anthem of the Peaceful Army || Best Foreign Album || Grammy Awards |- | align=\"center\" rowspan=\"4\"| 2019 | Greta Van Fleet | Best New Artist | |- | \"Highway Tune\" | Best Rock Performance | |- | \"Black Smoke Rising\" | Best Rock Song | |- | From the Fires | Best Rock Album | iHeartRadio Music Awards |- | 2019 | Safari Song | Rock Song of the Year | Loudwire Music Awards |- | 2017 || Greta Van Fleet || Best New Artist || ==References== ==External links== * * Lava Records Greta Van Fleet profile Category:2012 establishments in Michigan Category:Musical groups established in 2012 Category:Hard rock musical groups from Michigan Category:Sibling musical groups Category:Republic Records artists Category:Lava Records artists Category:Grammy Award winners Category:American blues rock musical groups Category:People from Frankenmuth, Michigan ",
