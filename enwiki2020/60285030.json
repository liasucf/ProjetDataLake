It is officially the world's tallest timber building, at tall. Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet translates as \u201cthe tower of lake Mj\u00f8sa\u201d. The building is named after Norway\u2019s biggest lake, which it is located next to. Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet has a combined floor area of around . The building offers a hotel, apartments, offices, a restaurant and common areas, as well as a swimming hall in the adjacent first-floor extension. This is about in size and also built in wood. Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet was designed by Norwegian studio Voll Arkitekter for AB Invest. Timber structures were installed by Norwegian firm Moelven Limtre, including load-bearing structures in glued laminated timber. Cross laminated timber were used for stairwells, elevator shafts and balconies. As the main vertical/lateral structural elements and the floor spanning systems of Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet are constructed from timber, the building is considered an all-timber structure. An all-timber structure may include the use of localized non-timber connections between timber elements. It may also include non-timber floors as long as the decks are supported by a primary structure made in timber (resting on timber beams). In Mj\u00f8st\u00e5rnet, concrete slabs were used on the top seven floors in order to handle comfort criteria and acoustics. The next tallest wooden building is the , 24-storey high \u2018HoHo Tower\u2018 in Vienna, Austria. However, this building is a timber-concrete composite building since it has a concrete core stabilizing the building, according to the definition of CTBUH. The Japanese wood products company Sumitomo Forestry Co is proposing to build a , 70-floor tower to commemorate its 350th anniversary in 2041. == References == Category:Buildings and structures in Innlandet Category:Wooden buildings and structures in Norway Category:Buildings and structures completed in 2019 Category:Ringsaker Category:Hotels in Norway ",
