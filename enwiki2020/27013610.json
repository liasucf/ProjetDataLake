    "text": "Ectoedemia occultella, the small birch leafminer, is a moth of the family Nepticulidae. It has a Holarctic distribution. It is found in most of Europe, east through Russia (where it has been recorded from Murmansk, Karelia, Leningrad, Samara and Tatarstan and Sakhalin) to Japan. It is also present in North America. Mines very similar to that of Ectoedemia occultella have been found on Rosaceae species in Nepal and Japan and these may belong to this species. Mined birch leaf Larva The wingspan is 5\u20137 mm. The head is grey, the face whitish. Forewings are light grey irrorated with dark fuscous and with a very indistinct oblique whitish fascia before middle, usually partly or wholly obsolete ; a small tornal spot and larger triangular spot on costa somewhat beyond it ochreous-white. Hindwings grey.Meyrick, E., 1895 A Handbook of British Lepidoptera MacMillan, London pdf Keys and description Adults are on wing from May to July. The larvae feed on Betula ermani, Betula grossa, Betula humilis, Betula nana, Betula obscura, Betula pendula and Betula pubescens. It has also been recorded from Salix pentandra in Finland. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a round, primary, upper-surface blotch without a visible initial corridor. There are often several mines in one leaf. The mine has a dark centre, where the larva often retreats. ==References== ==External links== * Plant Parasites of Europe *Nepticulidae from the Volga and Ural region *Ectoedemia occultella at UKMoths *Swedish moths *Ectoedemia occultella images at Consortium for the Barcode of Life Category:Nepticulidae Category:Moths of Asia Category:Moths of Europe Category:Moths of North America Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
