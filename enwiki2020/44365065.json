The ceremony was held on January 24, 2015, at The Joint in the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino, Paradise, Nevada. 24 XXX: An Axel Braun Parody won Best Parody, Best Screenplay-Parody, and Movie of the Year, with Axel Braun also winning Best Director-Parody, while Aftermath, which had the most nominations of any movie, won Best Drama, Best Screenplay, and Armstrong took home Best Director-Feature. The coveted Best New Starlet and Female Performer of the Year awards went to Carter Cruise and Anikka Albrite respectively. Albrite's husband, Mick Blue, won the Male Performer of the Year title. This marks the first time in the show's history that a married couple has simultaneously won both Performer of the Year awards. The International Business Times found \"a surprise: The Best Non- Feature Film award went to a female director, Mason, for Allie, although she was a no-show at the ceremony she also won Director of the Year. A video featuring Tila Tequila won the award for Best Celebrity Sex Tape over videos featuring Farrah Abraham and Mimi Faust. The awards show was recorded for its annual national broadcast on cable TV in the United States in mid-2015. ==Winners and nominees== On August 27, 2014, the award categories for the 2015 ceremonies were announced. A change to the categories was announced in that VOD-only titles would be accepted according to certain eligibility requirements. On November 20, 2014, the nominees for the 2015 awards were announced at an event in Hollywood which represented the first time that AVN Media Network had announced its nominees at a public event. According to the AVN staff, \"AVN streamlined the categories for the 2015 AVN Awards with the aim of making it easier for studios, directors and performers to find the correct ways in which to nominate their work. Some redundancies were eliminated and categories that were too similar were in some cases merged together to create a tight list of 108 categories.\" ===Major awards=== Anikka Albrite, winner of the 2015 AVN Female Performer of the Year Award Mick Blue, winner of the 2015 AVN Male Performer of the Year Award Carter Cruise, winner of the 2015 AVN Best New Starlet & Best Actress Venus Lux, winner of the 2015 AVN Transsexual Performer of the Year Award Steven St. Croix, winner of the 2015 AVN Best Actor Award Winners of categories (listed in reverse order of presentation) announced during the awards ceremony January 24, 2015, are highlighted in boldface. {| class=wikitable |- ! style=\"background:#89cff0; width:50%\" | Movie of the Year ! style=\"background:#89cff0; width:50%\" | Transsexual Performer of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * 24 XXX: An Axel Braun Parody (Best Parody) (Rather than nominees for this category, contenders are chosen from the winners in the \"Best Release\" categories such as Best Vignette Release, Best Parody Release and several others.

Applegate, Abigail Mac, Nadia Styles, Asa Akira, Mia Malkova, Karmen Karma, Aiden Starr, Christie Stevens, Jessica Drake, Veruca James, Gabriella Paltrova, Allie Haze, Jesse Jane, Jodi West, Kelly des Ch'tis, Farrah Abraham, Skin Diamond, Maddy O'Reilly, Brandy Aniston, Amber Lynn, Sunny Megatron * A bevy of Penthouse Pets: Lexi Belle, Misty Stone, Ryan Ryans, Kenna James, Layla Sin * Actors Ron Jeremy, Ryan Driller, Tommy Gunn, Lexington Steele, Michael Vegas ===Trophy girls=== * Carmen Caliente * Jillian Janson ===Performers=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Name(s) !! Role !! Performed |- | DJ Illest Rich || Performer || Disc jockey |- | Rae Sremmurd || Performer || Hip-hop duo |- | Hustler Club dancers || Performer || Hip-hop dancers |- | Danielle Stewart || Co-Host || Comedian |- | Tommy Pistol || Host || Song-and- dance |- |} ==Ceremony information== In order to be eligible for the 2015 award nomination, a movie or product had to be released in accordance with the following guidelines: * To be considered, a title must have been released between October 8, 2013 and September 30, 2014, either via VOD (video on demand) or DVD * Titles released on DVD must fit AVN's traditional distribution requirements of being stocked with five wholesale distributors and/or 100 retail outlets * Titles released on VOD must have been made available during the eligibility period for VOD download and/or streaming through at least two (2) major, for-pay VOD providers, defined as ones carrying movies from at least 100 active labels/studios * The title must have clearly marked post dates falling within the eligibility period across all qualifying VOD platforms carrying it On May 12, 2014, it was announced that Alexis Texas and Tommy Pistol were to be the co-hosts for the ceremonies. This was the first time in twenty years that a male performer was a host at the awards. Previously, AVN Hall of Fame inductee Steven St. Croix was a host in 1995, preceded by Randy West, Tom Byron and Rick Savage. On November 25, 2014 comedian and actress Danielle Stewart was added to the team as the comedic co- host for the show. ===Changes to awards categories=== For 2015, AVN decided \"to expand its longstanding eligibility requirements ... to include ones distributed solely via video-on-demand.\" AVN also announced, \"Some redundancies were eliminated and categories that were too similar were in some cases merged together to create a tight list of 108 categories.\" Additionally, a new \"surprise category\" was announced, Best Taboo Relations Movie. ===Controversies=== The Internet Adult Film Database staff believes it has found a couple of mistakes in the nomination list issued by AVN: \"In the Best POV Sex Scene category, the editors got their volume numbers jumbled \u2013 the scene between Summer Brielle and Kevin Moore appeared in Tease Me POV, not Tease Me POV 2. And performers got crossed with the Best Sex Scene in a Foreign-Shot Production category. The scene from Russian Institute: Lesson 19: Holidays at My Parents isn\u2019t between Ariel Rebel and Lola Reve, it\u2019s between Ariel Rebel and Cayenne Klein.\" ===Reception and review=== Some media outlets were impressed by the show. The International Business Times said, \"The evening also was filled with surprisingly entertaining repartee between presenters, funny pre-filmed skits and an overall sense of irony about the event.\" It also noted, \"One significant way the AVN awards differs from the Oscars is in the brevity of the acceptance speeches. Most winners thanked agents and other performers in less than 30 seconds before leaving the stage. A couple gave nods to their mothers.\" CraveOnline Canada said, \"The AVN Awards are as good a time to demand this call to arms as any. Pornography is a popular, widespread artistic genre \u2013 whatever you may or may not think of it \u2013 and it warrants more thoughtful consideration than whether or not it works as a product, or whether or not it is empowering us or destroying our values.\" ==In Memoriam== As the show was beginning, AVN used a video segment to pay a tribute to adult-industry personalities who had died since the 2014 awards show: * Golden-age hall of fame actress Gloria Leonard * Evil Angel general manager Christian Mann * Hot Vid\u00e9o founder Franck Vardon * Tony Lovett, a former editor-in-chief of three different AVN Media Network publications * Something Weird Video founder Mike Vraney * Photographer Bunny Yeager * and Toby Dammit, Cameron Fox, Billy Glide, Heather Joy, Christine Kessler, Armando Malatesta, Jake Malone, Phil Marshak, Shoosh, Paul Snell, Southern Somer and Jim Steel ==See also== * AVN Awards * AVN Award for Male Performer of the Year * AVN Female Performer of the Year Award * AVN Award for Male Foreign Performer of the Year * List of members of the AVN Hall of Fame * 87th Academy Awards ==Notes== ==External links== * Adult Video News * Adult Video News Awards at the Internet Movie Database Category:AVN Awards AVN Awards 32 ",
