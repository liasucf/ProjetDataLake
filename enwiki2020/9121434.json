CONMEBOL organized the tournament and invited three North American clubs which were the best three of the CONCACAF Champions' Cup 2007; the fourth North American club was the defending champion Pachuca. The official draw took place on May 22 in Buenos Aires. The Argentine club Arsenal de Sarand\u00ed won their first international title by defeating Am\u00e9rica in the final, winning 3-2 in the first leg and losing 2-1 in the second leg, which was the only game that they lost. Arsenal scored at least three goals in their opponents stadium in four of the five games they played. They defeated San Lorenzo, an Argentine club that recently won the 2007 Clausura, the Brazilian club Goi\u00e1s, Argentine giant River Plate and the strongest rivals of Mexican football, Guadalajara and America. This is the third time a Mexican club has reached the final, and the fourth title for Argentine clubs in the competition. Arsenal became only the third Argentine club to win a major international tournament without winning the Argentine league first, after Lan\u00fas and Talleres de C\u00f3rdoba. They were also the first Argentine club other than Boca Juniors to win an international title since San Lorenzo won the Copa Sudamericana 2002. ==Qualified teams== The Copa Sudamericana 2007 tournament was the seventh edition of the Copa Sudamericana soccer tournament. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Association !Team !Qualify method |- |rowspan=\"6\"| Argentina |Boca Juniors |Invitee |- |River Plate |Invitee |- |Estudiantes |2006\u201307 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n 2nd place overall |- |San Lorenzo |2006\u201307 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n 3rd place overall |- |Arsenal |2006\u201307 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n 5th place overall |- |Lan\u00fas |2006\u201307 Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n 6th place |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Bolivia |Jorge Wilstermann |2006 Segundo Torneo winner |- |Real Potos\u00ed |2006 Segundo Torneo runner-up |- |rowspan=\"8\"| Brazil |S\u00e3o Paulo |2006 S\u00e9rie A winner |- |Vasco da Gama |2006 S\u00e9rie A 6th place |- |Figueirense |2006 S\u00e9rie A 7th place |- |Goi\u00e1s |2006 S\u00e9rie A 8th place |- |Corinthians |2006 S\u00e9rie A 9th place |- |Cruzeiro |2006 S\u00e9rie A 10th place |- |Botafogo |2006 S\u00e9rie A 12th place |- |Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense |2006 S\u00e9rie A 13th place |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Chile |Colo-Colo |2007 Liguilla Pre-Sudamericana winner |- |Audax Italiano |2007 Liguilla Pre- Sudamericana runner-up |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Colombia |Atl\u00e9tico Nacional |2006 Reclasificacion 2nd place |- |Millonarios |2006 Reclasificacion 3rd place |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Ecuador |El Nacional |2006 Second Stage winner |- |Olmedo |2007 First Stage winner |- |rowspan=\"3\"| Mexico |Pachuca |2006 Copa Sudamericana champion |- |Guadalajara |2007 CONCACAF Champions' Cup runner-up |- |Am\u00e9rica |Most total points in 2007 Clausura & 2006 Apertura |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Paraguay |Libertad |2006 Liga Paraguaya winner |- |Tacuary |2006 Liguilla Pre- Sudamericana winner |- |rowspan=\"2\"| Peru |Coronel Bolognesi |2006 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 4th place |- |Universitario |2006 Primera Divisi\u00f3n 5th place |- |rowspan=\"1\"| United States |D.C.
