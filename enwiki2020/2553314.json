    "text": "Let The Sunshine In is the sixteenth studio album by Diana Ross & the Supremes recorded and released by Motown in 1969. It contains the hit single \"I'm Livin' in Shame\" (the sequel to 1968's number-one hit \"Love Child\"), \"The Composer,\" a Smokey Robinson composition that peaked at number 27, and \"No Matter What Sign You Are,\" - a single produced by Motown chief Berry Gordy that failed to crack to Top 30 (peaking at number 31). Motown had titled the album \u201cNo Matter What Sign You Are\u201d originally; going as far as creating the front cover art with the title in it, but when the single didn\u2019t chart as expected the album was retitled \u201cLet The Sunshine In.\u201d Though the album was released when the group consisted of Diana Ross, Mary Wilson and Cindy Birdsong, original founding member Florence Ballard (whom Birdsong replaced) appears on two songs. One track from this album, \"Let the Music Play\" was an outtake from the I Hear a Symphony (1966) album recording sessions and therefore features backing by Ballard, who was fired in 1967, two years prior to the release of this album. The other track, \"What Becomes of the Broken Hearted\", was recorded by the Supremes in 1966.
