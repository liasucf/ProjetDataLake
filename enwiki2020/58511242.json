The school was located in Sk\u00f6vde Garrison in Sk\u00f6vde. ==History== The Swedish Armoured Troops School was established on 1 April 1944 in Sk\u00f6vde Garrison. It initially had an annual company commander course and a non- commissioned officer course, both about two months long. In addition, there were special courses and trial activities for the military branch have been conducted. The school was located in Sk\u00f6vde in connection with Skaraborg Regiment (P 4). Exercises took place on Kr\u00e5k's proving ground. In the 1950s, the courses looked as follows: battalion commander course, Pa-01, 3 weeks; company commander course, Pa-02, 5 weeks; the Swedish Armor Corps Officers' School (Pansarofficersskolan, POS), 31 weeks; non-commissioned officer course, Pa-06, 9 weeks; reserve officer course, 2 weeks; special courses. On 1 April 1963, the Swedish Armor Corps Officers' School (Pansarofficersskolan, POS) was added to the school. In 1966, the school moved from P 4's barracks to Klagstorp outside Sk\u00f6vde. In connection with the disbandment of G\u00f6ta Life Guards (P 1) on 30 June 1980, the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School was relocated to Sk\u00f6vde. There the Swedish Armoured Troops School was amalgamated with the Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School and formed the Swedish Armoured Troops Combat School (Pansartruppernas stridsskola, PS) on 1 June 1981. ===Swedish Armor Corps Officers' School=== Swedish Armor Corps Officers' School (, POS) was established on 15 September 1944, and was originally located at the Swedish Infantry Gunnery School at Rosersberg Castle. From 1948, parts of the school were also transferred to Sk\u00f6vde, and from 12 October 1954, the entire school was placed in Sk\u00f6vde. On 1 April 1963, the school was amalgamated and became organizational a part of the Swedish Armoured Troops School. ==Barracks and training areas== When the Swedish Armoured Troops School was established in 1944, the school was located on the first floor of the barracks II at Skaraborg Regiment (P 4/Fo 35) in Sk\u00f6vde. From the 1950s, the school was moved to barracks III. In 1966, a refurbishment of the barracks began, which led to the relocation of the school on 10 March 1966, from the barracks area to Klagstorp Manor, which lies in the southern part of the proving ground. In 1980, parts of the school were moved back to the Skaraborg Regiment's barracks area, and were placed in barracks II, where the school disposed of the two top floors and the attic. In 1986, the school left the Skaraborg Regiment's barracks area, and instead, school activities were moved into the new school building at Heden. ==Heraldry and traditions== On 26 April 1976, \"Pansarkamrater\" (\"Armored Comrades\") was adopted as a march. The march was taken over in 1992 by the Swedish Army Armoured Center (Arm\u00e9ns pansarcentrum, PaC). After the Swedish Army Armoured Center was disbanded on 30 June 1995, the march was taken over from 1 July 1995 by the Combat School South (Stridsskola Syd, SSS). After the Land Warfare Centre was established on 1 January 1999, the new school came to adopt \"Pansarkamrater\" as a march. ==Commanding officers== Commanding officers of the Swedish Armoured Troops School. *1944\u20131944 \u2013 Major Arne Francke *1944\u20131949 \u2013 Major Hans Malmgren *1949\u20131952 \u2013 Major \u00c5ke Wikland *1952\u20131955 \u2013 Lieutenant Colonel Bernt Juhlin *1955\u20131956 \u2013 Major Karl-Henrik Berg *1956\u20131961 \u2013 Major Lars Lav\u00e9n *1961\u20131963 \u2013 Major Nils Isaksson *1963\u20131966 \u2013 Colonel Hugo Cederschi\u00f6ld *1966\u20131967 \u2013 Colonel Gustaf Peyron *1967\u20131968 \u2013 Colonel Per Bj\u00f6rkman *1968\u20131970 \u2013 Colonel Stig Colliander *1970\u20131974 \u2013 Colonel Per-Gunnar Brissman *1974\u20131980 \u2013 Colonel Hans Nilsson ==Names, designations and locations== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Name ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Translation ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From ! ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To |- | style=\"font-style:italic;\" | Pansartruppskolan | Swedish Armoured Troops School | 1944-04-01 | \u2013 | 1981-05-31 |- ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Designation ! style=\"font- weight:bold;\" | ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From ! ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To |- | PS | | style=\"text- align: center;\" | 1944-04-01 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text- align: center;\" | 1981-05-31 |- ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | Locations ! style=\"font-weight:bold;\" | ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | From ! ! style=\"text-align: center; font-weight:bold;\" | To |- | Sk\u00f6vde Garrison | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1944-04-01 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1966-02-28 |- | Sk\u00f6vde Garrison/Klagstorp Manor | | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1966-03-01 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | \u2013 | style=\"text-align: center;\" | 1981-05-31 |} ==See also== *Swedish Armoured Troops Cadet and Officer Candidate School ==Footnotes== ==References== ===Notes=== ===Print=== * * * * * ===Web=== * ==Further reading== * Category:Defunct schools in Sweden Category:Military education and training in Sweden Category:Military units and formations established in 1944 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1981 Category:Educational institutions established in 1944 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1981 Category:1944 establishments in Sweden Category:1981 disestablishments in Sweden Category:Sk\u00f6vde Garrison ",
