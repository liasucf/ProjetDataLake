    "text": "Tibberton is a village in the borough of Telford and Wrekin and ceremonial county of Shropshire, England. It is a fairly small village with some new barn conversions contrasting with the older houses. Much new housing has been planned by the borough council for the village however. The River Meese flows just to the north of the village. The B5062 road runs less than a mile away, to the south. In the way of amenities, Tibberton has a pub, The Sutherland Arms, and a small primary school. Following two years without a shop, a community shop opened in the village in December 2011. Tibberton is served by the Shrewsbury to Newport bus - the 519 service. Newport, the nearest town, is only away, to the east. There is a holy well within the parish of Tibberton, marked on the 1:50 000 map and signposted on the roads. The well has given its name to the district round about, but is not easy to locate on the ground. A gully takes one from the road, turns to a path, and the well is in a little wood. Water from the spring has carved out a little stream running down the short distance to the River Meese.\"Notes Towards a Survey of Shropshire Holy Wells - 2\" by Laurens Otter Nearby is the small village of Cherrington; the two villages together form the civil parish of Tibberton and Cherrington. ==See also== *Listed buildings in Child's Ercall *Listed buildings in Tibberton and Cherrington ==References== * ==External links== * Tibberton & Cherrington Parish Council website Category:Villages in Shropshire Category:Telford and Wrekin ",
