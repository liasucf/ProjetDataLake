James- Alexandre de Pourtal\u00e8s, Comte de Pourtal\u00e8s-Gorgier (28 November 1776 \u2013 24 March 1855) was a Swiss-French banker, diplomat and art collector. ==Early life== The Count de Pourtal\u00e8s was born in Neuch\u00e2tel, then in the Principality of Neuch\u00e2tel under Prussian rule, into a large family of Protestant financiers on 28 November 1776. He was the son of Countess Rose Augustine Marie de Luze (1751\u20131791) and Jacques-Louis de Pourtal\u00e8s (1722\u20131814), a banker in Naples who amassed a fortune in commerce and was made a count by King Frederick William II. Among his siblings were Louis de Pourtal\u00e8s (husband of Sophie d'Audanger) and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric de Pourtal\u00e8s (husband of Marie Louise de Castellane and grandfather of Friedrich von Pourtal\u00e8s). His paternal grandparents were J\u00e9r\u00e9mie de Pourtal\u00e8s and Marguerite de Luze (who was the younger sister of his maternal great-grandfather). The Pourtal\u00e8s family were French Huguenots who settled in Neuch\u00e2tel following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685. His maternal grandparents were the former Marianne-Fran\u00e7oise Warney (a niece of Daniel Roguin of Yverdon) and Baron Jean-Jacques III de Luze, a prosperous textile manufacturer at Colombier and were both friends of writer and philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau.. They had an elegant country house near the governor's ch\u00e2teau in what was then the principality of Neuch\u00e2tel. ==Career== Ch\u00e2teau de Gorgier. In 1813, he acquired the seigneury of Gorgier, which he added to the family name, from Charles Henry, Vicomte de Gorgier. He served as Chamberlain to the King of Prussia and was awarded the title of Count on 20 November 1814 by King Frederick William III, who ruled Prussia during the Napoleonic Wars and the end of the Holy Roman Empire. Pourtal\u00e8s freed the B\u00e9rochaux from cartage chores in 1822 and, in recognition, received a bench with his coat of arms at the church. From 1816 to 1829, he was a member of the General Audiences. ===Residences and art collection=== The Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals, which was owned by Pourtal\u00e8s.Pourtal\u00e8s' Head of Apollo, that was once in the collection of Vincenzo Giustiniani. In 1815, he settled in Paris before residing in a mansion in the Place Vend\u00f4me in the 1st arrondissement of Paris. Between 1838 and 1839, Pourtal\u00e8s had F\u00e9lix Duban build the Pourtal\u00e8s mansion, a h\u00f4tel particulier (essentially a grand townhouse) on Rue Tronchet in the 6th arrondissement of Lyon. At his mansion, Pourtal\u00e8s assembled one of the most important collections of antiques and paintings of his time, including the Laughing Cavalier by Frans Hals and works by Bronzino, Rembrandt, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and a Sandro Botticelli portrait. In 1825, he donated a mummy and coffin he acquired from the Thedenat-Duvent sale, to the Berlin Museum. In February and March 1865, ten years after his death, his collection was auctioned off in Paris in accordance with his will. The majority of his collection was photographed and published in a large folio by Goupil & Cie. The Laughing Cavalier was purchased by the Marquess of Hertford (who outbid Baron de Rothschild). Lord Amherst bought some of the important Egyptian objects. Sir Charles Newton spent 60,919 francs on bronzes and vases for the British Museum, and 47,000 francs on Giustiniani's Apollo. In 1806, he purchased the Ch\u00e2teau de Bandeville in Saint-Cyr-sous-Dourdan where, in 1833, he had the English-style park redeveloped by landscape designer Louis-Sulpice Var\u00e9, in one of the first known works. Today, Var\u00e9 is known for his French landscape gardens at several famous chateaux, including the Ch\u00e2teau de Ch\u00e2tenay-en-France, and the Bois de Boulogne park. In 1809, he also acquired Ch\u00e2teau de Luins in the Swiss Canton of Vaud for 150,000 Swiss francs. The estate passed to his eldest daughter and her husband, the Marquis de Ganay, and their family. ==Personal life== On 12 June 1809, he was married to Anne Henriette de Pal\u00e9zieux-Falconnet (1792\u20131836) in Neuch\u00e2tel.
