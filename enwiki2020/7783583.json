    "text": "In statistical mechanics, the translational partition function, q_T is that part of the partition function resulting from the movement (translation) of the center of mass. For a single atom or molecule in a low pressure gas, neglecting the interactions of molecules, the canonical ensemble q_T can be approximated by:Donald A. McQuarrie, Statistical Mechanics, Harper \\& Row, 1973 q_T = \\frac{V}{\\Lambda^3}\\, where \\Lambda = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{2\\pi m k_B T }} Here, V is the volume of the container holding the molecule (volume per single molecule so, e.g., for 1 mole of gas the container volume should be divided by the Avogadro number), \u039b is the Thermal de Broglie wavelength, h is the Planck constant, m is the mass of a molecule, kB is the Boltzmann constant and T is the absolute temperature. This approximation is valid as long as \u039b is much less than any dimension of the volume the atom or molecule is in. Since typical values of \u039b are on the order of 10-100 pm, this is almost always an excellent approximation. When considering a set of N non-interacting but identical atoms or molecules, when QT \u226b N , or equivalently when \u03c1 \u039b \u226a 1 where \u03c1 is the density of particles, the total translational partition function can be written Q_T(T,N) = \\frac{ q_T(T)^N }{N!} The factor of N! arises from the restriction of allowed N particle states due to Quantum exchange symmetry. Most substances form liquids or solids at temperatures much higher than when this approximation breaks down significantly. ==See also== * Rotational partition function * Vibrational partition function * Partition function (mathematics) ==References== ==Sources== Category:Partition functions ",
