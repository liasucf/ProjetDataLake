Moody-Stuart from \"The Sea of Galilee Mission of the Free Church of Scotland\" Moody was a missionary in Holy Island, Northumberland, from 1831 to 1835. From 1835, at the request of the Kirk session of St George's Church in Edinburgh, he began the work of gathering a congregation for a new church in Young Street. It was opened on 27 July 1837 and named St Luke's. He was ordained as its first minister. On 9 September 1839 he married Jessie Stuart (died 27 April 1891), eldest daughter of Kenneth Bruce Stuart of Annat. Jessie inherited the family estate at Rait on the braes of the Carse of Gowrie, which was named Annat after an old family estate, with the condition that her husband should take the surname Stuart of Annat. Hence Alexander Moody took the name Alexander Moody Stuart. After the Disruption of 1843 he left the established church and joined the Free Church of Scotland.
