Created in 1998, the FIMMQ were hosted by the local Military Bands, i.e. Les Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec and the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment. It welcomed, throughout the years, military and some civilian bands from Germany, Australia, Belgium, Chile, South Korea, United States, France, Norway, Netherlands, Poland, United Kingdom, Russia, Singapore, Italy, Switzerland and Austria. Outdoor performances were held for the general public at various locations in and around the city and an indoor show, the Quebec City Military Tattoo, was held inside the Colis\u00e9e Pepsi. The festival was created in 1998 by Jacques DuSault, who wanted to offer outdoors music shows to emphasize the Old Quebec City. The Canadian Armed Forces were invited to contribute, with the implication of the retired Lieutenant Colonel Yvan Lachance, old ordering of the Voltigeurs de Qu\u00e9bec, and Najor Denis Bernier, who was then directing the Military Band of the Royal 22e R\u00e9giment. In 2013, after 15 years in existence, the tattoo was dissolved. ==Quebec City Military Tattoo== Quebec City Military Tattoo The Quebec City Military Tattoo was an annual military tattoo that took place in Quebec City, the capital of the province of Quebec. Part of the Quebec City International Festival of Military Bands (FIMMQ), since 2005 the Quebec City Military Tattoo staged colourful and exotic performances, presenting a music show with choreographies and multi-media effects. This event gathered all the countries that participated at the FIMMQ. Military bands presented a stunning gathering of massed pipes and drums which could count 1200 musicians. Before this tattoo, the first show to be held in Quebec City was in 1967 as part of Canadian Armed Forces Tattoo 1967, for the 100th anniversary of Canadian confederation. It had been organised by the Canadian Army. The 2008 tattoo was the largest one ever held, highlighting the FIMMQ as 10th anniversary and the 400th anniversary of Quebec City. During this edition of the tattoo, bands such as the Alexandrov Ensemble and the Singapore Armed Forces Band perform.https://www.lesoleil.com/archives/festival-international-de-musiques- militaires-le-choeur-qui-aimait-quebec-a1409e8d526ef7fe6fac7d0658e3cc11 ==Gallery== File:US Navy 090830-N-5843P-043 The U.S. Navy Band performs in the Basilique-Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Quebec as part of the closing ceremonies of the 10th annual Quebec City International Festival of Military Bands.jpg|U.S. Navy Band performs in the Basilique-Cath\u00e9drale Notre-Dame de Qu\u00e9bec as part of the closing ceremonies of the 10th annual Quebec City International Festival of Military Bands File:US Navy 090827-N-0773H-258 The U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard stands at parade rest during the closing ceremony of the 10th annual Quebec International Festival of Military Bands.jpg|The U.S. Navy Ceremonial Guard stands at parade rest during the closing ceremony of the 10th annual Quebec International Festival of Military Bands File:US Navy 090828-N-5843P-061 The U.S. Navy Band, led by Captain George N.
