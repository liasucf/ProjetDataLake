It is thanks to Dionysus' love for him that Thasian wine is distinguished.Suda, \u0395 1276 s. v. Enekheis: \"Stafulos o eromenos Dionusou\" * Staphylus, in a reconstructed myth, the son of Bacchus and Erigone, where Bacchus assumed the form of a grape which Erigone ate. She immediately realized that she was with child and in time gave birth to a son whom she named Staphylus.Realencyclop\u00e4die der Classischen Altertumswissenschaft, Band IIIA, Halbband 6, Sparta-Stluppi (1929), ss. 2147-2148 (remarking that the actual primary sources never suggested that Dionysus and Erigone had a child together) * Staphylus, husband of Methe and father of Botrys. The family held court in their palace at Assyria. They received Dionysus as guest and held a banquet in his honor. Staphylus died a sudden death the next morning after the feast; to console his wife and son, Dionysus named grape bunches after Staphylus, drunkenness after Methe, and grapes after Botrys.Nonnus, Dionysiaca 18\u201319.59 * Staphylus, son of Oenomaus, who fought on Dionysus' side against Poseidon in the conflict of the two gods concerning Beroe.Nonnus, Dionysiaca 43.60 * Staphylus, son of Silenus, who introduced the practice of mixing wine with water.Pliny the Elder, Naturalis Historia 7.56 (57) * Staphylus, goatherd of King Oeneus, who discovered wild grapes as he was pasturing the king's goats and saw one of them chewing on the plant. He presented it to Oeneus, who in his turn invented the way of making the grapes into a drink. When Dionysus visited Oeneus, the king served him the new drink. Dionysus suggested that the drink be named oinos (wine) after Oeneus, and the grapes staphyloi after the goatherd Staphylus.Probus on Virgil's Georgics 1. 9 ==See also== * Rhoeo * Staphylococcus == References == * Nonnus of Panopolis, Dionysiaca translated by William Henry Denham Rouse (1863-1950), from the Loeb Classical Library, Cambridge, MA, Harvard University Press, 1940.
