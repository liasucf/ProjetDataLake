    "text": "Ptolemy (), king of Epirus c. 237 BC \u2013 234 \u0412\u0421, was the second son of Alexander II, king of Epirus, and Olympias, grandson of the great Pyrrhus and brother of Phthia of Macedon. He was named in honour of his late uncle Ptolemy. He succeeded to the throne on the death of his elder brother, Pyrrhus II of Epirus, but reigned only a very short time, having set out on a military expedition, during the course of which he fell sick and died or, according to Polyaenus, he was treasonably assassinated. The date of his reign cannot be fixed with certainty, but as he was a contemporary of Demetrius II, king of Macedonia, it may be placed between 239 and 229 BC. He was succeeded by his niece Deidamia. ==References== *Smith, William (editor); Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, \"Ptolemaeus\", Boston, (1867) ==Notes== \\---- Category:Rulers of Ancient Epirus Category:3rd-century BC Greek people Category:Year of birth unknown Category:230s BC deaths ",
