Episode 4 was originally due to be aired on 29 November 2019, but was cancelled (see below). ==Cancellation== On 27 November, while filming the ninth episode in Ningbo, model-actor Godfrey Gao suddenly collapsed and was brought to the hospital, but was pronounced dead three hours after several resuscitation attempts. Gao died due to a sudden cardiac arrest, after over 17 hours of filming. Another celebrity on the same episode, Li Wenhan reported injuries due to a twisted ankle and bounded on a wheelchair, and the producers decided to suspend the taping of the episode. Following the death, the show faced criticisms in which contestants were involved in number of high-risk challenges late night and along with the risks involved, and lacking safety standards for reality programs in China. Zhejiang TV pulled the broadcast of episode four (which was initially scheduled to aired 29 November) and until today it has remained unaired. On 5 December, the show was finally announced cancelled after three episodes of air in the aftermath of Gao's death, and Zhejiang TV and the show's director shortly apologized on Sina Weibo and acknowledged the lapse of safety of the cast members involved in the program. ==See also== * The Late, Late Breakfast Show \u2013 a British light entertainment show, which was also cancelled after a fatality as a result of a stunt gone wrong == References == Category:Zhejiang Television original programming Category:Chinese reality television series Category:2019 Chinese television series debuts Category:2019 Chinese television series endings ",
