    "text": "A Dark Song is a 2016 Irish-British independent horror film, written and directed by Liam Gavin and starring Steve Oram and Catherine Walker. It was released to select theatres and digital streaming platforms on 28 April 2017. It is Gavin's directorial debut. ==Plot== A bitter and grieving Sophia rents an isolated house in rural Wales in order to convince short-tempered occultist Joseph Solomon to lead her in a grueling, months-long rite dictated from The Book of Abramelin to summon her guardian angel. They will then be allowed to ask the angel to grant them a wish. Sophia will ask her angel to be able to speak to her dead seven-year-old son. Solomon explains that once they begin, if they leave the house before the ritual is finished, they will be in grave peril. Sophia must spend months of punishing exercises in which they will be dealing with real demons and angels. She agrees. Over months, she complies with dozens of harrowing and painful exercises but refuses to do the forgiveness ceremony. To make up for her refusal, Solomon insists she must drink his blood. He also says they must have sex as part of the ritual. After manipulating her into taking off her clothes, he masturbates before informing her it was just for him to be less distracted by getting some release, not for ritualistic purposes. Sophia gets her revenge by urinating in his breakfast the following day. They grudgingly get to know one another over time. However, after months, a frustrated Sophia complains that it\u2019s taking too long, and Solomon accuses her of impairing the ritual by not being honest about something. She admits that the real favor she will ask the angel is revenge upon whoever kidnapped and killed her son. That night he awakens her and says that because her dishonesty has made her impure, a re-birthing ritual in the tub is required. However, he drowns her, recites a spell, and revives her with CPR. Angry afterward, she pushes him and he accidentally falls on a large kitchen knife, impaling him in the side. As she treats the wound with their meager medical supplies, he explains that this is a sign that the ritual is beginning to work, and that she will have her revenge. He discloses that he will request of the angel that he become invisible for the rest of his life, in order to be away from people \u201cto gain some quiet before the hell.\u201d As Solomon soldiers on with the wound, Sophia begins seeing and hearing menacing presences in the house, including the voice of her son. As Solomon's wound becomes infected, he begins to fail and eventually dies in his sleep. When Sophia goes back to his books for further instruction, everything has been crossed out, unreadable. Sophia steps beyond the perimeter of the house but her car won't start. After walking down an empty road, she is disturbed to realize that she has arrived back at the mansion. She re-enters to discover various kinds of demons appearing. They drag her to the basement, tormenting her, and cut off a finger as she tells them how sorry she is. They retreat as a brilliant white light fills the house. She finds a massive, beatific angel in armor awaiting her; Sophia asks it for the power to forgive, and it smiles. Later, she performs a water burial of Solomon, and then drives away. ==Cast== *Steve Oram \u2013 Joseph Solomon *Catherine Walker \u2013 Sophia Howard *Mark Huberman \u2013 Neil Hughes *Susan Loughnane \u2013 Victoria Howard *Nathan Vos - Jack ==Release== A Dark Song premiered 8 July 2016 at the Galway Film Fleadh in Ireland, and was shown at the 2016 Fantastic Fest, the 2016 BFI London Film Festival and the 2016 Boston Underground Film Festival.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a 91% approval rating based on 36 reviews, with a rating average of 7.4/10. Its consensus reads: \"A Dark Song offers atmospheric, unsettling horror -- and marks writer-director Liam Gavin as one to watch.\" Tara Brady of The Irish Times called it \"a nifty, novel Irish horror.\" Stephen Dalton of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film is a \"classy effort throughout, from cinematographer Cathal Watters' beautiful vistas of the rugged Welsh landscape to Ray Harman's spare, brooding, dread- filled score. Oram's typically sour, surly, slyly comic performance also grounds the plot in a grubby realism that serves its more fantastical elements well.\" Haleigh Foutch of Collider wrote, \"A Dark Song spins many webs of mystery and keeps you puzzling out every mystery up until the audacious ending you definitely won't see coming.\" Scott Weinberg of Nerdist wrote, \"Two complete strangers cutting themselves off from the world inside of a dilapidated mansion? That's already a movie I want to see. But once A Dark Song starts delving into issues like love, loss, faith, and the natural human reaction to sudden tragedy, that's when it blossoms from a novel concept to a truly powerful piece of genre filmmaking.\" == References == == External links == * * Category:Irish films Category:Irish independent films Category:Irish horror films Category:2016 horror films Category:2010s supernatural horror films Category:Films about magic ",
