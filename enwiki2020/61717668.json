After graduating from Durham with a 2:1 he continued his education at Churchill College, Cambridge, and represented Cambridge University R.U.F.C.. Hannaford taught Biology at Sherborne School from 1968 to 1970, and later at Clifton College and Millfield. He retired to France in 1997. ==Rugby union career== He made his test debut against Wales, scoring a try in a 22\u20136 defeat.
