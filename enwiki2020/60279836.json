    "text": "Troy Michie (born 1985) is an American collage artist, painter, interdisciplinary installation artist, and sculptor based in New York City. Michie's work is often in dialogue with the canon of collage; as well as, investigating society's understanding of race, gender, sexuality, and other fields of identity and power. ==Early life and education== Troy Michie was born in El Paso, TX. He received a BFA from the University of Texas at El Paso in 2009 and an MFA from the Yale School of Art in Painting/Printmaking in 2011. ==Career== Michie participated in the Tuesday Night MFA Lecture Series at BU School of Visual Arts. === Fat Cat Came To Play === On December 3rd, 2017, Michie held his first solo exhibition Fat Cat Came To Play through Company Gallery, which lasted until January 21st, 2018. In the solo exhibition, Michie explores the significance of zoot suits, which are \u201cbroad- shouldered suits that were popular with Italian, black, and Latino men in the United States in the 1940s\u201d. The installation was inspired by the Zoot Suit Riots, which took place in 1943 after white servicemen attacked a group of Mexican Americans wearing Zoot suits. Unlike his earlier works, which dealt with sex, Fat Cat Came To Play focused on exploring \u201cblackness, queerness, and sexuality within an assemblage\u201d by expressing socio-economic traits on to the Zoot Suit. In many of his installations, Michie cuts out the faces of photographs from this era to address that these histories of the minorities are still relevant today. A notable piece of the exhibition was \u201cDisruptive Patterns\u201d, which aimed to remind people that police officers were among the attackers in the Zoot Suit Riots. The exhibition stayed true to Michie\u2019s philosophy of representing the cultural expressions, specifically through fashion, of \u201chistorically marginalized American male figures\u201d. ==Exhibitions== *\"Found: Queer Archaeology; Queer Abstraction\u201d \u2013 Leslie-Lohman Museum of Gay and Lesbian Art *Stedelijk Museum-Hertogenbosch *\"Rites of Spring\" (group show) - Contemporary Arts Museum Houston \u2013 (01/11/2014 \u2013 September 3, 2014) *\"A Constellation\" (group show) - The Studio Museum in Harlem \u2013 (11/12/2015 \u2013 June 3, 2016) *\"Trigger: Gender as a Tool and a Weapon\" (group show) \u2013 The New Museum \u2013 (09/27/17 \u2013 01/21/18) *2019 Whitney Biennial \u2013 Whitney Museum of American Art \u2013 curated by Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta ==References== ==External links== *Troy Michie is making collage art a little more queer \u2013 Vice \u2013 Andr\u00e9-Naquian Wheeler Category:1985 births Category:Living people Category:University of Texas at El Paso alumni Category:Yale School of Art alumni Category:LGBT people from Texas Category:LGBT people from New York (state) Category:LGBT African Americans Category:LGBT artists from the United States Category:African-American artists Category:African-American painters Category:African-American contemporary artists Category:American contemporary artists Category:Afro-Latinx visual artists ",
