    "text": "The London XI was a football team that represented the city of London in the 1955\u201358 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup. The competition began in 1955, and the first tournament took three years to complete. The entrants were the major football team of each city which held a Trade Fair. Like many cities taking part, London had several strong teams; however, rules stated that there could only be a single team from each city. It was decided to create a team especially for the tournament, using the best players from each London-based club. Membership of the team varied considerably between matches, to the effect that as many as 54 players took part in the 8 matches of the campaign. The London XI, managed by Chelsea chairman Joe Mears, reached the final of the cup, after coming top of a group that included special XI teams from Basel and Frankfurt, and then beating Lausanne Sports. London lost 8\u20132 on aggregate over two legs to FC Barcelona. The London XI only competed in the 1955\u201358 tournament, all future Inter-Cities Fairs Cups involving a London team were contested by individual clubs from London instead. A unified London side competed in friendly matches even earlier: a \"London\" team represented the FA in the historic 1866 London v Sheffield match, there were several challenges against the Glasgow FA during the 1880s,Representative Matches, Scottish Football Historical Archive (archive version, 2018) and \"London\" lost 4-2 to Corinthians on 21 November 1903 in front of 1500, described as Corinthians \"had an easy task\" in a 1904 Times article. Two other matches have been referenced \u2013 an \"annual match\" versus Birmingham on 3 October 1910 and a match versus Paris on 18 December 1910. ==Teams and match details== ===Group stage=== ;Basel XI 0\u20135 London XI \u2013 4 June 1955 Team: Ron Reynolds (Tot), Peter Sillett (Che), Jim Fotheringham (Ars), Stan Willemse (Che), Ken Armstrong (Che), Derek Saunders (Che), Harry Hooper (Wes), Johnny Haynes (Ful), Cliff Holton (Ars), Eddie Firmani (Cha), Billy Kiernan (Cha).
