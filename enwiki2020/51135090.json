It occupies an area of approximately in an area in the Whicher Range south of Busselton mainly in areas infested with Watsonia meriana var. bulbillifera and Juncus microcephalus. ==Conservation== The subspecies is only found in six fragmented locations, road reserves between areas cleared for agriculture. It species is listed as Critically Endangered in Western Australia in 2002. In 2005 the estimated population following surveys was 176 plants. ===Translocation program=== 1000 seeds were collected from existing populations between 2009 and 2012. A total of 92 seedlings in 2012 and 172 in 2013 were planted at a secure site within a nature reserve close to the existing populations. The translocation worked well with 97 to 99% of the plants surviving after the first two years, 95% of them flowering and 80% bearing fruit. ==References== brachystylis Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Plant subspecies Category:Critically endangered flora of Australia Category:Taxa named by Gregory John Keighery ",
