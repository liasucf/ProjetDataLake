In early 1968 it also hosted a Mission: Impossible crew.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0649368/trivia Often the camera faced the front gates from inside the compound near the commandant's office to show the passage of guest characters; such scenes looked northeast to a tree-covered berm beyond which utility poles along Higuera Street were visible.http://www.retroweb.com/40acres_tour_pt4.html In 1974, Stalag 13 became the outdoor location in Ilsa: She-Wolf of the SS. Set demolition began while that movie was photographed; by summer 1974 all traces of the \"camp\" were gone and a new set was erected for The Fortune. http://www.retroweb.com/40acres_final_years.html ==References== Category:Buildings and structures in Culver City, California Category:Film location shooting ",
