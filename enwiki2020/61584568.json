    "text": "Charlie Leslie Carter (born 25 October 1996) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for League Two club Stevenage. Carter played for Fulham and Kingstonian at a young age, before joining Woking's academy. It was at Woking where he signed his first professional contract ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, which would mark Carter's first season playing regular first-team football. After two full seasons at Woking, the latter in which he was the club's top goalscorer from midfield, Carter signed for Chesterfield of the National League in June 2018. He spent one season at Chesterfield before signing for Stevenage for an undisclosed fee in July 2019. ==Career== ===Woking=== Carter began his career in the Fulham academy at the age of eight, before also spending time playing for Kingstonian in the Ryman Youth League. He joined Woking at the age of 13, and was captain at various youth levels for three seasons. Ahead of the 2016\u201317 season, Carter played in a number of first-team pre-season friendlies for Woking and subsequently earned his first professional contract. He made his competitive first-team debut in a 2\u20132 draw away at Solihull Moors on 9 August 2016, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute for Ismail Yakubu. During his first season in the first-team, Carter made 36 appearances in all competitions as Woking finished the National League campaign in 18th position. Carter signed a contract extension with Woking on 15 June 2017, stating he initially found the step up to first-team football difficult, but believed with a year of experience he would be better placed for the following season. The 2017\u201318 season would serve as Carter's breakthrough season in terms of his attacking output from midfield. He scored his first goal for Woking in the club's second match of the season, a 3\u20131 away loss at Tranmere Rovers on 8 August 2017. Carter was almost ever-present throughout the campaign, making 46 appearances in all competitions and scoring twelve times from midfield. He finished the season as the club's top goalscorer, in a season where Woking were relegated back to the National League South after finishing in 21st place. ===Chesterfield=== Despite new Woking manager Alan Dowson stating he felt Carter should remain at the club for a further year to continue his development, Carter signed for National League club Chesterfield on 20 June 2018. He joined the club for an undisclosed fee, with Chesterfield having to pay compensation for the out-of- contract player as Carter was under the age of 24. Chesterfield manager Martin Allen stated he had met with Carter at Wembley Stadium during the FA Trophy final weeks prior to him signing for the club. Carter made his Chesterfield debut on the opening day of the 2018\u201319 season, playing the whole match in a 1\u20130 away victory against Ebbsfleet United. In the club's next match, he scored twice in the first half in an eventual 3\u20130 victory over Aldershot Town on 7 August 2018. He played regularly during the opening two months of the campaign, but suffered an ankle injury in a 1\u20131 draw away at Maidstone United on 29 September 2018. Carter underwent an operation on the ankle in October 2018. He returned to the first-team five months later on 23 February 2019, coming on as a 55th-minute substitute in a 1\u20130 defeat to Harrogate Town. Three days later, he started and scored in a 2\u20130 away victory at Barnet. Carter went on to play regularly through to the remainder of the season as Chesterfield finished the campaign in 14th position in the National League. He made 20 appearances in all competitions during a season disrupted by his ankle injury, scoring four goals. ===Stevenage=== Carter signed for League Two club Stevenage on 2 July 2019, joining for an undisclosed fee \"after weeks of negotiations\". He made his Stevenage debut in the club's 2\u20131 loss to Southend United at Broadhall Way on 13 August 2019, playing the opening 77 minutes of the match. Carter's first goal for the club came in a 2\u20131 home win over Grimsby Town on 12 October 2019. The goal proved to be decisive in earning Stevenage their first victory of the 2019\u201320 season. Carter played regularly during his first season with the club, making 37 appearances. He finished the season as the club's top goalscorer with six goals. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Woking | 2016\u201317 |National League |32||0||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||36||0 |- | 2017\u201318 |National League |41||12||4||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance in the FA Trophy||0||46||12 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !73!!12!!8!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!82!!12 |- |Chesterfield | 2018\u201319 |National League |20||4||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||20||4 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Stevenage | 2019\u201320 |League Two |29||5||2||0||1||0||5Appearances in the EFL Trophy||1||37||6 |- | 2020\u201321 |League Two |0||0||0||0||1||1||0||0||1||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !29!!5!!2!!0!!2!!1!!5!!1!!38!!7 |- !colspan=3|Career total !122||21||10||0||2||1||6||1||140||23 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Woking F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
