    "text": "Wiesenthau family according to Siebmacher's Armorial The west side (2020) The south side (2020) Schloss Wiesenthau stands on the northeastern edge of the eponymous municipality at the foot of the Ehrenb\u00fcrg in northern Bavaria. The Renaissance building is a three-winged country house with 4 mid-16th century corner towers and the remains of an enceinte. == History == The village is first recorded in 1062 in connexion with the royal palace (K\u00f6nigshof) in Forchheim. The lords of Wiesenthau appear from 1128 onwards as ministeriales of the Bishopric of Bamberg. Whether at that time a castle already existed is not clear. The castle itself is first recorded in 1379. Originally an allodial possession of the lords of Wiesenthau, on 25 June 1379 part of the castle was sold to the Bishopric. In the period that followed the whole castle became a fief of Bamberg. The lords of Wiesenthau remained, however, in charge of the castle as Bamberg vassals. In 1430 the castle was badly damaged by the Hussites. It suffered destruction again in 1525 during the Peasants' War. In 1566 it was fully rebuilt. Apart from a short period of time, the castle, or at least a part of it, was continuously owned by the lords of Wiesenthau until they died out in 1814. After a comprehensive renovation lasting from 1985 to 1992, the castle became an inn and hotel. == Literature == * Kai Kellermann: Herrschaftliche G\u00e4rten in der Fr\u00e4nkischen Schweiz \u2013 Eine Spurensuche.
