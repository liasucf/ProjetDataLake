This marked a renewed partnership between race organisers and UAB TELE-3, a Lithuanian television company that owns both TV6 and TV3 brands in Lithuania. TV3 was a race promoter from 2005 to 2008 and the race was then known as 1003 kilometers race. 42 teams entered the race. Multiple and defending race winner Jonas Gel\u017einis joined Benediktas Vanagas and Sebastiaan Bleekemolen in General Financing by Pitlane team, while his brother and 2015 event winner Ignas Gel\u017einis moved to newly formed Team Hot Wheels. Another last year's race winner Tautvydas Bar\u0161tys did not returned to defend the title. Lithuanian racing legend Stasys Brundza crashed his Marcos Mantis during first practice session and was forced to replace his car to BMW M3. However, it failed technical commission.http://www.15min.lt/gazas/naujiena/autosportas/po- avarijos-i-bmw-persedusiam-s-brundzai-technines-komisijos- ultimatumas-25-659139 ==Qualifying== Qualifying took place on July 22.
