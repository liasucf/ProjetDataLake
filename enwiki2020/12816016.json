The river Leysse close to the commune. ==Climate== Le Bourget-du-Lac, just like Chamb\u00e9ry, features an oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen: Cfb). In spite of this it is highly influenced by its interior position within France and near several mountain ranges like Jura mountains, Bauges and Chartreuse mountains, resulting in quite hot summers and winters with frequent temperatures below freezing, especially at night. Convective rainfall is frequent for much of the year, rendering high precipitation/day quotas. ==See also== *Communes of the Savoie department ==References== *INSEE ==External links== *Official site Category:Communes of Savoie ",
