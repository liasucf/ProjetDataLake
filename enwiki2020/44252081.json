Below is a list of the largest exoplanets so far discovered, in terms of physical size, ordered by radius. == Discrepancy == This list of interstellar objects may and will change over time because of inconsistency between journals, different methods used to examine these objects and the already extremely hard task of discovering exoplanets, or any other large objects for that matter. Then there is the fact that these objects might be brown dwarves, or nothing at all. Because of this, this list only cites the best measurements to date and is prone to change. Remember, these objects are not stars, and are quite small on a universal or even stellar scale. __TOC__ == The List== The sizes are listed in units of Jupiter radii (, )(71,492 km). All planets listed are larger than two times the size of the largest planet in the Solar System, Jupiter. Some planets that are smaller than have been included for the sake of comparison. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Image ! Exoplanet name !

Over time, it will shrink to the size of Jupiter.
