    "text": "The Alpha Rho Chi Fraternity House is a historic fraternity house located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Champaign, Illinois. Its resident fraternity was one of the two founding chapters of Alpha Rho Chi; it formed as the Arcus Society in 1911 and became the Anthemios chapter of Alpha Rho Chi in 1914. The fraternity's members were all students in architecture or a related field; its name came from the first three letters in the Greek word for architecture, and the chapter's namesake was a famous Greek architect. The fraternity's house, designed in 1928 by local architecture firm Royer, Danley, and Smith, is itself a notable architectural work. The building blends elements of the French Eclectic and English Arts and Crafts styles; significant details include the corner tower over its arched entrance, brick chimneys at the narrow ends of its \"L\"-shaped plan, decorative brickwork, and a steep tile hip roof. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 23, 1997. ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Houses completed in 1928 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Champaign County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Category:Fraternity and sorority houses Category:Buildings and structures in Champaign, Illinois ",
