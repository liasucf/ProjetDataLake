A back pocket player, McCarter made his debut for Geelong in 1913 in round 1 against Richmond at Corio Oval.http://afltables.com/afl/stats/games/1913/091419130426.html He did not play from 1916 to 1920 because of war service but was at his best when he returned in 1921, supposedly being named Geelong's club champion. He certainly won such an award in 1923, before retiring the following season. During his career he represented Victoria five times at interstate football. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1888 births Category:1941 deaths Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:Geelong Football Club players Category:Carji Greeves Medal winners Category:East Geelong Football Club players Category:Australian military personnel of World War I ",
