    "text": "Octopus mercatoris, the Caribbean dwarf octopus, is a small octopus species native to the Caribbean Sea region of the Atlantic Ocean. Though they are common, Octopus mercatoris are rarely seen. The Caribbean dwarf octopus is mainly nocturnal, hunting by night and staying in a cave during the day. While most octopuses are cannibalistic, O. mercatoris is less cannibalistic than other species, and is sometimes found in small groups under rocks. They eat crabs, shrimps, and small fish. This species has an average lifespan of 8\u201310 months. Because their eggs are large, they are sometimes kept and bred as pets. ==External links== Category:Octopodidae Category:Molluscs of the Atlantic Ocean Category:Molluscs of North America Category:Fauna of the Caribbean Category:Molluscs described in 1937 ",
