Turk's oeuvre deals with issues of authenticity and identity, engaged with modernist and avant-garde debates surrounding the 'myth' of the artist and the 'authorship' of a work of art. ==Early work== Gavin Turk, 'Cave' installation, Royal College of Art, 1991 Turk studied at Chelsea School of Art from 1986 to 1989, and at the Royal College of Art from 1989 to 1991. In 1991, tutors at the Royal College of Art refused to present Gavin Turk with his postgraduate degree, a decision based on his graduation exhibition. Titled Cave, it consisted of a whitewashed studio space, containing a blue heritage plaque (of the kind normally found on historic buildings) commemorating his own presence as a sculptor, stating \"Gavin Turk worked here, 1989\u20131991\". This bestowed some instant notoriety on Turk, whose work was collected by numerous collectors including Charles Saatchi, who later exhibited Turk's work in the exhibition Sensation, which toured London (Royal Academy of Arts), Berlin (Hamburger Bahnhof) and New York (Brooklyn Museum). Turk attended the private view of the Sensation exhibition at the Royal Academy, dressed as a down-and-out He has subsequently produced an extensive body of work, which purports to question the value and integrity of a hermetic artistic identity. == Practice == Turk's wide ranging practice often incorporates iconic images of figures taken from popular culture and art historical sources. A series of detailed life-sized waxworks, incorporating the artists own appearance, features the artist assuming various poses as different characters, including Sid Vicious, Jean-Paul Marat and the Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara. Turk's most famous work in this series, Pop (1993) is a waxwork of Turk as Sid Vicious. The work appropriates the stance of Andy Warhol's screen print of Elvis Presley. In the work, the right hand is pointing a gun, a motif which recurs in other works in the series, such as Bum (1998). Turk has appropriated recognisable elements from artists such as Jacques-Louis David, Yves Klein, Marcel Duchamp, Andy Warhol, Ren\u00e9 Magritte, Alighiero Boetti, Robert Morris (artist) and Jasper Johns. == Elvis Presley == Gavin Turk, Diamond Pink Elvis, 2005From 2005 Turk began producing a small number of silkscreen works on canvas, depicting himself as Elvis Presley, in a pose taken from the paintings by Andy Warhol of the same subject from the 1960s, such as Warhol's Triple Elvis. Turk applied diamond dust to some of the Elvis works made from diamant\u00e9 applied to silkscreened canvas in vibrant pop colours, which sparkles in direct light. Warhol was one of the first artists to use diamond dust in his artworks. Examples of Turk's Elvis series are Diamond Yellow Elvis, 2005 and Diamond Pink Elvis, 2005. == Che Guevara == A set of what appeared to be classic posters of Che Guevara in a beret, again revealed themselves on further scrutiny to be photos of Turk himself. Turk alleged that the management of London's (now defunct) Millennium Dome refused to display his Che Gavara (sic) sculpture, for fear of offending arms- manufacturing Dome sponsor BAe/Marconi (however a correspondent in Art Monthly magazine pointed out that work by the highly political left-wing cartoonist Ralph Steadman was being exhibited in the Dome at the same time). == Sculpture and public works == A series of three-dimensional Trompe-l'\u0153il works includes objects cast into bronze, painted to give the appearance of the original object. Possibly his most revered works, these include bronze sculptures of plastic rubbish bags, see \"Bag\" (2000). Other sculptures include \"Nomad\" (2002), a bronze cast of a sleeping bag, and Box (2002), which resembles a cardboard box. Turk is perhaps the leading exponent of the painted bronze, and has cast objects from spent matches to worn paving slabs to discarded vehicle exhaust pipes. Gavin Turk 'Nail', 2011, photo by Andy Keate In December 2009, Turk took part in the \"Bricks\" exhibition at Area 10 in Peckham in Southeast London. However, the day before the exhibition was to start, organizers noticed that his piece entitled \"Revolting Brick\" had been stolen and replaced with a fake brick. The fake brick held the words \"Thank You Have a Nice Day, Next\" and was part of a set of 500 that was given away at the exhibition. \"Revolting Brick\" was number eight in a series of ten that Turk had created and signed. The artist stated that he \"was upset but flattered\" at what had happened and that the theft \"raises questions about value and worth\". In May 2011, Turk's first large-scale, 12-metre public sculpture was unveiled between the One New Change City mall, designed by Pritzker Prize-winning architect Jean Nouvel, and St Paul's Cathedral.Gavin Turk, Bag, 2000Gavin Turk, Bum, 1998 == Exhibitions == Gavin Turk has exhibited widely internationally.

In November 2018, Turk was one of 82 people arrested during a coordinated occupation of five bridges in Central London. The demonstration which was co- ordinated by Extinction Rebellion, was to raise the awareness of climate change. Turk said, \u201cIt seems like everyone is in an odd sense of denial about climate change.\u201d ==The House of Fairy Tales== In 2007 Turk established, with his partner Deborah Curtis, The House of Fairy Tales, a children's arts charity based in London, that brings together hundreds of artists, performers, actors, writers and philosophers to deliver theatrical events, guides and exhibitions.
