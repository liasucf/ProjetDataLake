    "text": "The Chiefdom of Cocoll\u00e1n (meaning \"place of undulations\") was a pre-Columbian state founded by Coca tribes in present-day central Jalisco, Mexico. ==Foundation== The ancient Chiefdom of Cocoll\u00e1n was founded by Coca tribes, former residents of the Chiefdom of Tonal\u00e1, sometime during the 12th century by Huehuetztlatzin. Cocoll\u00e1n's tributaries were Santa Ana Acatl\u00e1n, Tizapanito (present-day Villa Corona), Xilotepetque, Tecolotl\u00e1n, Atengo, and Tenamaxtl\u00e1n. The city of Cocoll\u00e1n was destroyed in the 16th century, which caused the inhabitants to move westward toward near what is now Tlajomulco de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga in 1509. The Tlajomulcans drove the Cocoll\u00e1ns off their territory, and they transported back to their old site in Santa Ana Acatl\u00e1n, where they stayed until 1519. In 1519, the Cocoll\u00e1ns went back to the top of a mountain that runs from east to west in order to build the town of Cocoll\u00e1n again, where they remained until the arrival of the Spanish. In 1521, with Citlali as cacique, Cocoll\u00e1n was discovered and conquered by the Spaniard Alonso de Avalos, who incorporated it into the Avalos Province. ==Rulers== *Huehuetzlatzin *Citlali (meaning \"star\") was the last of the Cocoll\u00e1n chiefs. He participated in the Salitre War. ==Subjugated villages== *Acatl\u00e1n (present- day Acatl\u00e1n de Ju\u00e1rez) *Tizapanito (present-day Villa Corona) *Xilotepetque *Tecolotl\u00e1n ==References== Category:Former countries in North America ",
