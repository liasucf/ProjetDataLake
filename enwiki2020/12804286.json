    "text": "Joan Manel Balcells Fornaguera (born 20 June 1975) is a retired professional tennis player from Spain. He won one ATP Tour singles title in his career and reached the final in Scottsdale in 2002 (losing to Andre Agassi) and the semifinals in 2000 Heineken Open losing to Michael Chang. Balcells was born in Barcelona, and played for the Spain Davis Cup team in 2000, winning the doubles rubber (with \u00c0lex Corretja) in the final against Australia. He retired in 2004. Ballcells was considered a strange player for being a Spanish player because Ballcells always go up to the net, his game was based on serve and volley. This was not very common on Spanish tennis by the 1990s and early 2000s. == Career finals == ===Singles (1 title, 1 runner-up)=== {| class='sortable wikitable' |- !style=\"width:70px\"|Outcome !style=\"width:25px\"|No. !style=\"width:110px\"|Date !style=\"width:200px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:60px\"|Surface !style=\"width:180px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- | bgcolor=\"98FB98\"|Winner | 1. | 11 September 2000 | Bucharest, Romania | Clay | Markus Hantschk | 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 7\u20136(7\u20131) |- | bgcolor=\"FFA07A\"|Runner-up | 2. | 10 March 2002 | Scottsdale, USA | Clay | Andre Agassi | 2\u20136, 6\u20137(2\u20137) |} ===Doubles finalist (2)=== *2000: Bogot\u00e1 (partnering Mauricio Hadad; lost to Pablo Albano/Lucas Arnold Ker, 6\u20137(4\u20137), 6\u20131, 2\u20136) *2001: Doha (partnering Andrei Olhovskiy; lost to Mark Knowles/Daniel Nestor, 3\u20136, 1\u20136) == Top 10 wins == {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !# !width=170|Player !Rank !width=250|Event !Surface !Rd !width=200|Score |- ! colspan=7|2001 |- |1. | Marat Safin |bgcolor=thistle|2 |bgcolor=e9e9e9|Miami, United States |style=\"background:#ccf;\"|Hard |bgcolor=afeeee|2R |4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 |- |2. | Marat Safin |bgcolor=thistle|2 |Gstaad, Switzerland |bgcolor=EBC2AF|Clay |bgcolor=afeeee|1R |6\u20134, 6\u20137(4\u20137), 6\u20134 |} ==External links== * * * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Catalan tennis players Category:Spanish male tennis players Category:Tennis players from Barcelona ",
