Tennant stated at the time of the announcement: ==Previous record labels== In addition to their time signed to Parlophone, Pet Shop Boys have previously created several smaller record labels for the release of side projects and collaborations. ===Spaghetti Records=== Spaghetti Records was launched in September 1991. The first single to be released on Spaghetti was by a 21-year-old Scottish singer, synthesizer player and songwriter called David Cicero. The single was called \"Heaven Must Have Sent You Back to Me\". Cicero went on to release four more singles and an album on Spaghetti. Other artists to have released material on Spaghetti include Masterboy, Boy George and Ignorants. The label's logo consists of the word SPAGHETTI laid out vertically in extremely tall extra-thin type, to mimic a strand of spaghetti. ===Olde English Vinyl and Lucky Kunst=== In May 2003, the Pet Shop Boys launched two more record labels called Olde English Vinyl and Lucky Kunst. These new labels saw releases by Atomizer, Pete Burns and Sam Taylor-Wood. ==References== ==See also== * List of record labels Category:British record labels Category:Record labels established in 2013 Category:Pop record labels Category:Pet Shop Boys Category:2013 establishments in the United Kingdom ",
