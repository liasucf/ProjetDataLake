She is the 10-time Women's World Professional Darts Champion of the British Darts Organisation (BDO). Her nickname is Golden Girl and in 2003, she was named as the BBC Midlands Sports Personality of the Year. ==Early life== The daughter of publicans, Gulliver was born in Warneford Hospital in Leamington Spa, and was brought up in the small town of Southam in Warwickshire. She trained as a carpenter and joiner, and later taught carpentry and joinery at Mid-Warwickshire College, Leamington Spa. ==Darts career== From the introduction of the BDO Women's World Championship in 2001, Gulliver remained undefeated in the competition until her defeat in the 2008 Championship by Anastasia Dobromyslova. During this undefeated run Gulliver beat Francis Hoenselaar of the Netherlands to win the title on five occasions. Gulliver has the top 3 highest winning 3 dart averages in the Women's World Championship, all of which are higher than 90. During the 2008 tournament Trina stated on many occasions that she was not happy with the prize money and the game length compared to the men's competition. In 2008 the women's champion only received \u00a36,000, whereas the men's champion wins \u00a395,000 and the male competition is first to 7 sets whereas the women's is first to 2. Despite this she didn't enter the inaugural (and thus so far only) PDC Women's World Championship in 2010, that offered higher prize money than the BDO version. Trina Gulliver was beaten in the 2009 World Championship Final by close friend Hoenselaar. In 2010 Gulliver defeated Hoenselaar, Deta Hedman and Rhian Edwards all 2-0 to become World Champion for the first time since 2007. In 2011 Gulliver defeated Wendy Weinstadtler, Irene Armstrong and Rhian Edwards all 2-0 to successfully defend the Women's World Championship. Gulliver has been sponsored by the leading Global Darts Brand Winmau for over 10 Years, and in 2003 was named as the BBC Midlands Sports Personality of the Year. She was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to darts and to charitable fundraising. ==Personal life== Trina married Paul Gulliver in 1994, after nine years together, and they lived in Southam, but divorced in 2005 after eleven years of marriage. She then lived in Cheddar, Somerset until 2017 with her England ladies' darts colleague Sue Gulliver. They married in a civil partnership in July 2010. As of March 2020, her website stated she is \"In a relationship with Nicole\". Trina's mother Muriel died on 5 January 2012, two days before the start of the BDO World Darts Championship. Trina still took part in the competition, at the request of her mother before she died. Trina has recently joined the Sky Sports Darts team for the 2019 PDC World Championships. ==Autobiography== 2008 saw the publication of her autobiography, Golden Girl: The Autobiography of the Greatest Ever Ladies' Darts Player, which chronicles her ongoing rivalry with ladies' darts superstar and former Olympian Crissy Manley, wife of PDC player Peter Manley. ==World Championship results== ===BDO=== ** 2001: Winner (beat Mandy Solomons 2\u20131) ** 2002: Winner (beat Francis Hoenselaar 2\u20131) ** 2003: Winner (beat Anne Kirk 2\u20130) ** 2004: Winner (beat Francis Hoenselaar 2\u20130) ** 2005: Winner (beat Francis Hoenselaar 2\u20130) ** 2006: Winner (beat Francis Hoenselaar 2\u20130) ** 2007: Winner (beat Francis Hoenselaar 2\u20131) ** 2008: Runner-up (lost to Anastasia Dobromyslova 0-2) ** 2009: Runner-up (lost to Francis Hoenselaar 1\u20132) ** 2010: Winner (beat Rhian Edwards 2\u20130) ** 2011: Winner (beat Rhian Edwards 2\u20130) ** 2012: Semi Final: (lost to Anastasia Dobromyslova 0\u20132) ** 2013: Semi Final: (lost to Anastasia Dobromyslova 1\u20132) ** 2014: First Round: (lost to Tamara Schuur 0\u20132) ** 2015: Quarter Final: (lost to Lisa Ashton 0-2) ** 2016: Winner (beat Deta Hedman 3-2) ** 2017: Quarter Final (lost to Aileen de Graaf 0-2) ** 2018: Semi Final (lost to Anastasia Dobromyslova 0-2) ** 2019: Quarter Final (lost to Lorraine Winstanley 0-2) ** 2020: Withdrew ==References== ===Books=== * == External links == * Official Website * Profile and stats on Darts Database Category:1969 births Category:Living people Category:English carpenters Category:English darts players Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:Sportspeople from Leamington Spa Category:LGBT sportspeople from England Category:Women carpenters Category:BDO women's world darts champions Category:Female darts players Category:Bisexual sportspeople Category:LGBT darts players ",
