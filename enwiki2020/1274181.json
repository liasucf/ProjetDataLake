    "text": "Moritz von Schwind, c. 1860. Moritz von Schwind (21 January 1804 \u2013 8 February 1871) was an Austrian painter, born in Vienna. Schwind's genius was lyrical\u2014he drew inspiration from chivalry, folklore, and the songs of the people. Schwind died in P\u00f6cking in Bavaria, and was buried in the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof in Munich. ==Life and career== Early Morning, 1858 Moritz von Schwind received rudimentary training and spent a happy and carefree youth in Vienna. Among his companions was the composer Schubert, some of whose songs he illustrated. In 1828, the year of Schubert's death, he moved to Munich, where he befriended the painter Schnorr and enjoyed the guidance of Cornelius, then director of the Academy. In 1834 he was commissioned to decorate King Ludwig's new palace with wall paintings illustrating the works of the poet Tieck. He also found in the same place congenial sport for his fancy in a \"Kinderfries\". He was often busy working on almanacs, and on illustrating Goethe and other writers through which he gained considerable recognition and employment. alt= In the revival of art in Germany, Schwind held as his own the sphere of poetic fancy. In 1839 he was entrusted with the new Karlsruhe academy, itself an embodiment in fresco of ideas thrown out by Goethe. He decorated a villa in Leipzig with the story of Cupid and Psyche, and further justified his title of poet-painter with designs from the Niebelungenlied and Tasso's Gerusalemme for the walls of the castle of Hohenschwangau in Bavaria. From the year 1844 dates his residence in Frankfurt during which he created some of his finest easel pictures, most notably the \"Singers' Contest\" in the Wartburg (1846), as well as designs for the Goethe celebration. There were also numerous book illustrations. The conceptions for the most part are better than the execution. In 1847, Schwind returned to Munich on being appointed professor in the academy. Eight years later his fame was at its height on the completion in the castle of the Wartburg of wall pictures illustrative of the \"Singers' Contest\" and of the history of Elizabeth of Hungary. Frankfurt, Schwindhaus The compositions received universal praise, and at a grand musical festival in their honour, Schwind himself was one of the violinists. In Munich he also worked on some churches, particularly the altar and windows of the Church of Our Lady. His exceptionally mature cycle, \"Seven Ravens\" from Grimm's fairy stories was produced in 1857. In the same year he visited England to report officially to King Ludwig on the Manchester art treasures. So diversified were his gifts that he turned his hand to church windows and joined his old friend Schnorr in designs for the painted glass in Glasgow Cathedral. Towards the close of his career, with broken health and his powers on the wane, he revisited Vienna. During this time, he created the cycle from the legend of Melusine and the designs commemorative of chief musicians which decorate the foyer of the Vienna State Opera. Cornelius writes, \"You have translated the joy of music into pictorial art.\" ==Work== File:Moritz von Schwind - A Player with a Hermit - WGA21074.jpg|A Player with a Hermit (1846) File:Moritz von Schwind 002.jpg|Honeymoon (1867) File:Moritz von Schwind Der Traum des Gefangenen.jpg|The Dream of the Prisoner (1836) File:Ruebezahl (Moritz von Schwind).jpg|R\u00fcbezahl (1845) File:1844 Schwind Sabina von Steinbach anagoria.JPG|Sabina of Steinbach (1844) File:Moritz von Schwind - Abschied im Morgengrauen - Google Art Project.jpg|Farewell at Dawn (1859) File:1852 Schwind Aschenbroedels Aufbruch zum Ball anagoria.JPG| Cinderella, to go on the ball (1852) File:Schwind Der Besuch 1860.jpg|The Visit (1860) File:1860 Schwind Abenteuer des Malers Joseph Binder anagoria.JPG|The Painter Joseph Binder's Adventure (1860) File:Moritz von Schwind 001.jpg| The ride of Kunos von Falkenstein (circa 1850 - 1860) == See also == * Romanticism * Peter von Cornelius * Johann Wolfgang von Goethe ==Notes== ==References== * ==External links== * * German masters of the nineteenth century: paintings and drawings from the Federal Republic of Germany, a full text exhibition catalog from The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which contains material on Moritz von Schwind (no. 79-82) * * * * * Moritz von Schwind's birth house in Vienna Category:1804 births Category:1871 deaths Category:Artists from Vienna Category:19th-century Austrian people Category:19th-century Austrian painters Category:19th-century male artists Category:Austrian male painters Category:Austrian romantic painters Category:Austrian untitled nobility Category:Burials at the Alter S\u00fcdfriedhof Category:Members of the Bavarian Maximilian Order for Science and Art ",
