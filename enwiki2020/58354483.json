    "text": "Austen Thomas Williams (born December 19, 1992) is an American professional baseball pitcher for the Washington Nationals of Major League Baseball (MLB). ==Career== After graduating from Southwest Christian School,http://www.eagleathletics.org/athletic-dept/collegiate-eagles.cfm Williams enrolled at Texas State University where he played college baseball. He was drafted by the Washington Nationals in the sixth round of the 2014 MLB draft. Williams struggled in 2016 and 2017, including in the Arizona Fall League, where he pitched for the Mesa Solar Sox. Moved from the rotation into the bullpen as a multi-inning reliever in 2018, Williams prospered for the Class-AA Harrisburg Senators, being named an Eastern League All-Star and earning a promotion by August to the Class-AAA Syracuse Chiefs for the first time. After Williams posted a 1.19 ERA across 68 innings for Class-AA Harrisburg and Class-AAA Syracuse, the Nationals selected Williams' contract on September 1, 2018, adding him to the major league pitching staff following a trade that sent Gio Gonz\u00e1lez to the Milwaukee Brewers. He made his major league debut the next day, striking out two Brewers in two relief innings. ==Pitching style== On the mound, Williams employs a three-pitch mix, with a sinking fastball that tops out around , a breaking ball variously described as a curveball or a slider, and a changeup. Since moving to the bullpen after the 2017 season, Williams has focused more on a fastball-slider combination while building his velocity. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Fort Worth, Texas Category:Baseball players from Texas Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Washington Nationals players Category:Texas State Bobcats baseball players Category:Gulf Coast Nationals players Category:Auburn Doubledays players Category:Hagerstown Suns players Category:Potomac Nationals players Category:Harrisburg Senators players Category:Syracuse Chiefs players Category:Fresno Grizzlies players Category:Mesa Solar Sox players ",
