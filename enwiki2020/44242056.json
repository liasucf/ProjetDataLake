    "text": "Prophecy is a live album by American free jazz saxophonist Albert Ayler recorded in New York City on June 14, 1964 and first released in 1975 on the ESP-Disk label.Albert Ayler discography accessed October 29, 2014Albert Ayler sessionography, accessed October 29, 2014 ==Background== The album features Ayler's trio, with bassist Gary Peacock and drummer Sunny Murray, and contains five tracks representing roughly half of that evening's concert, which was taped by Paul Haines. A recording of the entire concert, including five additional pieces, was released by the German label In Respect as Albert Smiles With Sunny. According to Sunny Murray, Bernard Stollman, founder of ESP-Disk, \"released Prophecy after Albert died, without Albert's signature, but because I also had a copy of the same tape I released mine through a company in Germany... as a correct move for me and Al... [M]y tape was better quality than his and also at the correct speed, so mine sounds better.\" (According to Val Wilmer, Ayler's recordings for ESP-Disk were made \"against the advice of Cecil Taylor and other musicians who thought that artists should hold out for a price commensurate with their talent.\" Ayler justified his decision, stating: \"I felt my art was so important that I had to get it out. At that time I was musically out of this world. I knew I had to play this music for the people.\") The additional tracks from Albert Smiles with Sunny were also released on Holy Ghost: Rare & Unissued Recordings (1962\u201370). The Ayler trio would go on to record Spiritual Unity less than a month later. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 3 stars stating: \"Ayler alternated the simple march-like themes with wild and very free improvisations which owe little if anything to the bop tradition, or even his contemporaries in the avant-garde. Ayler always had his own individual message, and his ESP sessions find him in consistently explorative form\".Yanow, S., Allmusic Review accessed October 29, 2014 All About Jazz commented: \"Though the trio had honed a group sound and method comprising slow and loping or extremely fast themes; Murray's constant percussive chatter and vocal wailing providing an alternate pure-sound springboard; Peacock's constant harmonic filigree creating yet another aural web, these are presented in Prophecy as a much looser framework\".Allen, C., Albert Ayler: Prophecy/Bells Review, July 14, 2005 ==Track listing== All compositions by Albert Ayler # \"Spirits\" - 7:15 # \"Wizard\" - 8:00 # \"Ghosts (First Variation)\" - 10:00 # \"Prophecy\" - 6:35 # \"Ghosts (Second Variation)\" - 7:40 ==Personnel== *Albert Ayler - tenor saxophone *Gary Peacock - bass *Sonny Murray - drums ==References== Category:1975 live albums Category:Albert Ayler live albums Category:ESP-Disk live albums ",
