A satellite image of Tsukuba Circuit in 1990 ==Time Attack== Tsukuba's \"Time Attack\" event (alternatively known as Super Lap or Tuner Battles) originated in Japan when the tuning media organized the event on race circuits such as Tsukuba, as a proving ground for street tuned cars built at a large budget by highly respected tuning companies. As a result of the quick rise in popularity, tuners developed specialized cars to beat the competition,Time Attack FAQ's including the purpose-built HKS CT230R Lancer Evolution with a body made entirely out of carbon fibre. Unlike other timed motorsport disciplines such as sprinting and hillclimbing, the car is required to start off under full rolling start conditions following a warm-up lap, where they will have to accelerate out as fast as possible to determine how fast they enter their timed lap. Commonly, as competing cars consist of modified road-going models, they are required to wear tires authorized for road use. In all, drivers are allocated to three laps in a final event run; warm-up, timed and cool-down. === Rankings === The following is a table of best Time Attack times, last updated 21 December 2019: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Pos !Team !Car !Best lap (sec) !Top speed (km/h) |- |1 || Scorch Racing with Under Suzuki|| Nissan Silvia (S15) || 50.366 || 245.622https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQ9dXIWRiO0 |- |2 || Escort Drag Racing Service || Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII || 50.716 || 236.998https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrGZn5RVwbU |- |3 || Top Fuel Drag & Street Shop || Honda S2000 (AP1) || 51.762 || 233.080https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sn7WhukUNlA |- |4 || Garage G-Force || Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VIII || 52.391 || 223.927 |- |5 || Racing Factory AutoBahn || Toyota Soarer (JZZ30) || 52.454 || 248.447https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xg4OoKnzvZs |- |6 || Vibrant Performance with PZ Tuning || Honda Civic (FG4) || 53.071 || 237.781https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adPNm-ZJmpk |- |7 || Esprit || Honda NSX (NA1) || 53.474 || 239.734https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=y1o7sMQQvb4&feature;=youtu.be |- |8 ||Car Shop Dream KJM with Voltex || Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) || 53.489 || 225.894 |- |9 || HKS || Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX CT230R || 53.589 || 228.xxxhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xci_anRJV1A |- |10 || Revolution || Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) || 53.673 || 225.894https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kd- AnG3LYUg |- |11 || Friends Racing || Nissan Silvia (S15) || 53.821 || 223.602 |- |12 ||Kyushu Danji || Honda NSX (NA2) || 54.101 || 222.635https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HRgxFyRJ-Lw |- |13 || DLanguage || Subaru Impreza (GRB) R205 || 54.115 || 225.282 |- |14 || Admix Racing Service with Seyamax || Nissan Skyline GT-R (BNR32) || 54.118 || 221.584https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=62BDawQjwHA |- |15 || Autech Tsukada (ATTKD) || Nissan Skyline GT-R (BNR32) || 54.145 || 232.909https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-B9nMEkeVI |- |16 || Sakamoto Engineering || Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) | 54.252 || 225.282https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO1BGUKqXQ&list;=PL_TdfZKRDV4udSM86-pHXVWWTiQ4koapE |- |17 || Sun Automobile with Garage HRS|| Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VII CyberEVO || 54.392 || ---.--- |- |18 || M Speed || Nissan Skyline GT-R (BNR34) || 54.481 || 229.348 |- |19 || Endless || Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) | 54.483 || 212.014https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2xoDsB8Cvg |- |20 || Top Fuel Racing || Mazda RX-7 (FD3S) | 54.585 || 224.439 |} == In popular culture == Tsukuba Circuit has appeared in numerous video games, including iRacing, Forza Motorsport, 2, 3, and 4, Gran Turismo 4, PSP, 5, 6, and Sport, Tourist Trophy, Enthusia Professional Racing, rFactor, Assoluto Racing, and D1 Grand Prix.
