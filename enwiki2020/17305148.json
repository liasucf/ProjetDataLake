Hungarian language title: Ap\u00e1k k\u00f6nyve. == The Book Of Fathers == This is a monumental family saga, the adventures of twelve generations. Over three hundred years of Hungarian history, and the story of all fathers. The story begins in 1706, when the Czuczor printer family, having recently returned to Hungary from Germany, is forced to flee again by the violence which ensues after the Habsburg army suppresses the war of Hungarian independence led by Prince Ferenc R\u00e1k\u00f3czi. They hide out in a cave but are found and all killed, except the youngest boy, Korn\u00e9l Csillag. After this miraculous survival (he is fed by a dog while living in the woods), Korn\u00e9l grows up to become a talented and wealthy man, changing his name to Sternovszky. His son remembers the grandfather's buried treasure and builds a tower on top of the blown up cave, whilst the next son, Istv\u00e1n, now called Stern, in order to marry his lover converts to Judaism and becomes a wine merchant. And so the lineage carries on, through the Hungary's Holocaust, its Stalinist terror of the 1950s, and eventually passing to America, where Henryk Csillag is born. He moves to Budapest, and it is his son who picks up the tale of the book of fathers in 1999, the year of the solar eclipse. Thus the lineage of sons is brought into conjunction with the heavenly ordained cycle of the son. In chronicling this remarkable dynasty. The book thrillers and tragicomedies which is shot through with strands of Hungary's history and rich culture, deploying an astonishing battery of literary styles appropriate to the period of each episode.
