    "text": "Lucy Hay, Countess of Carlisle, Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Henrietta Maria. The Lady of the Bedchamber is the title of a lady-in-waiting holding the official position of personal attendant on a British queen or princess. The position is traditionally held by a female member of a noble family. They are ranked between the First Lady of the Bedchamber and the Women of the Bedchamber. They are also styled Gentlewoman of Her Majesty's Bedchamber. The equivalent title and office has historically been used in most European royal courts (Dutch: Dames du Palais; French: Dames or Dame de Palais; German: Hofstaatsdame or Palastdame; Italian: Dame di Corte; Russian: Hofdame or Statsdame; Spanish: Due\u00f1a de honor; Swedish: Statsfru). ==History== In the Middle Ages, Margaret of France, the wife of King Edward I of England, is noted to have had seven ladies of the bedchamber: the three married ones were called Domin\u00e6 and the four unmarried ones were known as maids of honour. Their task was simply to act as the companions (see lady's companion) and personal attendants to the royal woman. In a description from 1728, the task of the Ladies of the Bedchamber was to act as the go-between for the queen and the Women of the Bedchamber, who had the task to wait upon the queen by helping her wash, dress and undress, and so forth. A Woman of the Bedchamber worked independently from a Lady of the Bedchamber and did not take orders from her. However, if a Lady of the Bedchamber was present, a Woman of the Bedchamber would always defer to her. If a Lady of the Bedchamber was present when a Woman of the Bedchamber arrived to dress the queen, for example, she would not dress the queen herself, but instead give the garments to the Lady of the Bedchamber, who in turn helped the queen put it on. The procedure was the same in other issues. The post of a Lady of the Bedchamber was considered prestigious, and the appointments have therefore been subjected to controversies. Queen Anne appointed Sarah Churchill, Duchess of Marlborough, to this position; the Duchess was widely considered an influential royal favourite. In 1839, concerns that Queen Victoria was determined to surround herself with wives of Whig politicians led to the Bedchamber crisis, preventing the installation of a Tory government under Robert Peel. ==List of Ladies of the Bedchamber to the Queens of England== This is an incomplete list of those who have served as Lady of the Bedchamber in the British Royal Household. ===Catherine of Aragon, 1509\u20131536=== * Anne Bourchier, Lady Dacre of the South * Margaret Brent (?), Lady Bergavenny * Mabel Dacre, Lady Scrope * Mary Grey, Lady Ferrers of Chartley * Lady Anne Percy, Lady Maltravers, Countess of Arundel * Inez de Venegas, Lady Mountjoy ( Lord Mountjoy\u2019s 2nd wife) * Elizabeth Willoughby, Lady Maltravers ===Elizabeth I, 1558\u20131603=== *1558\u20131565: Katherine Ashley (n\u00e9e Champernowne), Lady Ashley *1559\u20131569: Catherine Carey, Lady Knollys, also 1st Cousin or half-Sister to Elizabeth I *1568\u20131599: Elizabeth Stafford *1587 Frances Newton, Baroness Cobham ===Anne of Denmark, 1603\u20131619=== Anne of Denmark was Queen Consort to James I of England. * Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford * Penelope Blount, Countess of Devonshire * Anne Livingstone, Countess of Eglinton. * Elizabeth Schaw.
