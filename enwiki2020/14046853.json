    "text": "Central Butte is a town in Saskatchewan, Canada, approximately from Saskatoon, Regina and Swift Current and from Moose Jaw. Thunder Creek, a river that flows into Moose Jaw, begins south of the community. The town is served by the Central Butte Airport (TC LID: CJC4). ==History== The first settlers arrived to farm in the Central Butte area in 1905, the same year Saskatchewan became a province. In 1906 a store and post office were established. A railway from Moose Jaw made it to the Central Butte area at the end of 1914, meaning the trips to Craik for supplies were no longer necessary. After the railway arrived, a permanent township was chosen and businesses in the area were moved in. ==Demographics== ==Recreation and clubs== *4-H *Kin Canada *Lions Club *Royal Canadian Legion *Butte Junction Dance *Curling *Figure skating *Karate *Minor ball *Minor hockey *Seniors activities *Senior hockey *Volleyball ==Notable people== * James Alcock - professor of psychology, author * Ron Atchison - Saskatchewan Roughriders defensive lineman * Blair Jones - professional hockey player * R.
