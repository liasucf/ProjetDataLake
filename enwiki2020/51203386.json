When he gets lucky and defeats a bridge champion, Cedric Van Dorn (Gottschalk), he jokingly claims \"the Stanislavsky method\" is how he was victorious, and soon becomes world-famous as a bridge expert. Trouble ensues when Peter and Marcia form a team to play in bridge tournaments, whereupon know-nothing Peter suddenly begins behaving like a know-it-all, questioning Marcia's play and causing tempers to flare.
