    "text": "Classifications of Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease refers to the types and subtypes of Charcot\u2013Marie\u2013Tooth disease (CMT), a genetically and clinically heterogeneous group of inherited disorders of the peripheral nervous system characterized by progressive loss of muscle tissue and touch sensation across various parts of the body. CMT is a result of genetic mutations in a number of genes. == Clinical categories == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left; font-size: small;\" |- ! Type ! style=\"width:13em\"|Name ! style=\"width:16em\"|Incidence ! Notes |- | CMT1 | Demyelinating type | Affects approximately 30% of CMT patients | Causes severe demyelination, thereby impairing nerve conduction velocity. |- | CMT2 | Axonal type | Affects approximately 20\u201340% of CMT patients | Mainly affects axons. Tends to affect lower extremities more than upper extremities. Clinical symptoms are often less severe than in CMT1. As it is an axonopathy, average nerve conduction velocity is usually not affected (sometimes slightly below normal but mostly above 38 m/s). |- | CMT3 | Dejerine\u2013Sottas disease | Very rare | Severely impaired nerve conduction velocity. |- | CMT4 | Spinal type | | |- | CMT5 | Pyramidal type | | |- | CMT6 | With optic atrophy | | |- | CMTDI | Dominant intermediate type | | |- | CMTRI | Recessive intermediate type | | |- | CMTX | X-linked type | Affects approximately 10\u201320% of CMT patients | This type encompasses all CMT forms that are inherited in an X-linked manner. Average NCV: 25\u201340 m/s. |- |} == Genetic subtypes == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align: left; font-size: small;\" ! Type ! Subtype ! OMIM !
