    "text": "Coast to Coast is the fourth US studio album by the English rock band the Dave Clark Five. It is notable for containing two hit singles \"Any Way You Want It\" and \"Everybody Knows (I Still Love You)\". Other songs from this album were used in the Dave Clark Five film Having a Wild Weekend such as \"I Can't Stand It\" and \"When\". In Canada, it was released as Across Canada with the Dave Clark Five on Capitol Records. ==Reception== In his retrospective review for Allmusic, critic Bruce Eder wrote, \"Coast To Coast opens strong and it gets better, blooming into an amazingly diverse yet consistently powerful record made up entirely of group originals... Had there been an actual rock press in 1964, or if the Dave Clark Five been taken more seriously sooner, Coast To Coast would probably be regarded today as something close to an essential British Invasion record...\" ==Track listing== ===Side one=== #\"Any Way You Want It\" (Ron Ryan) #\"Give Me Love\" (Also titled as \"I Can't Stop Loving You\") (Dave Clark, Denny Payton) #\"I Can't Stand It\" (Dave Clark, Lenny Davidson) #\"I'm Left Without You\" (Also titled as \"What Is There To Say\") (Dave Clark, Denny Payton) #\"Everybody Knows (I Still Love You)\" (Dave Clark, Lenny Davidson) #\"Crying Over You\" (Dave Clark, Lenny Davidson) ===Side two=== #\"Say You Want Me\" (Dave Clark, Lenny Davidson) #\"When\" (Dave Clark, Lenny Davidson) #\"Don't You Know\" (Dave Clark, Denny Payton) #\"To Me\" (Dave Clark, Denny Payton) #\"It's Not True\" (Dave Clark, Mike Smith) ==Personnel== ===Dave Clark Five=== *Dave Clark: drums, backing vocals *Mike Smith: keyboards, lead vocals *Lenny Davidson: guitars, backing vocals *Rick Huxley: bass guitar, backing vocals *Denis Payton: saxophone ==References== Category:The Dave Clark Five albums Category:1965 albums Category:Epic Records albums ",
