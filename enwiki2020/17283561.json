    "text": "Niagara Falls is an experimental band from Philadelphia, PA that has ties to the recent psychedelic folk resurgence as well as the burgeoning noise and neo-ambient or space music movements. They formed in 2004 as a quartet of Norman Fetter, Jeff Carpineta, Erich Breimhurst, and Jennifer Lee, and became known for their live improvised performances, and constantly shifting instrumentation. Comparisons are often made to German groups such as Tangerine Dream and Popol Vuh. Their music references German krautrock, and Minimalism, as well as contemporary artists such as Thuja, Jackie-O-Motherfucker, and Wooden Wand & The Vanishing Voice. Norman Fetter and Jeff Carpineta also co- founded the Honeymoon Music record label in 2004, which releases Niagara Falls albums. They released their first album, Barrel Vault in 2004 which was a live improvised recording of their first meeting. They followed in 2006 with Zwei, which saw the band drastically changing instrumentation, and performance approaches. Released in late 2006, Plays Spiral Isles saw the band exploring a more electronic approach to creating their signature drone. Carpineta and Lee left the band in 2007. In late 2007, Noah Levey and Sam Cusumano joined the group. Breimhurst left the band in spring 2008, and Geoff Bucknam joined on electric guitar. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Barrel Vault (2004) *Zwei (2006) *Plays Spiral Isles split w/ The Clear Spots (2006) *Sequence of Prophets (2009) ===Compilation appearances=== *The Honeymoon Music Compilation, Honeymoon Music (2005) \"Fission\" *Up The Stairs and Through The Hall, Sherman Arts (2005) \"In The Stream\" *Wailing Bones Volume 7 Digitalis Industries (2007) \"Mimics of the Mastodon\" ==External links== *Niagara Falls at Honeymoon Music *Niagara Falls on Myspace *Niagara Falls on Virb *interview by Foxy Digitalis *Review of \"Zwei\" on Ptolemaic Terrascope *Review of \"Zwei\" on Foxy Digitalis *Review of \"Plays Spiral Isles on Foxy Digitalis Category:American experimental musical groups ",
