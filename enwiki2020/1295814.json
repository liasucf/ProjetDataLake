It is operated by the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de transport de Montr\u00e9al (STM) and serves the Green Line. It is in Montreal's Gay Village, part of the Centre-Sud district.Beaudry Station Although part of the original network of the Metro, it opened two months after the rest of the network, on December 21, 1966. == Overview == moving sidewalk inside the station. rainbow-coloured masts over the door Designed by Adalbert Niklewicz, it is a normal side platform station, built in-tunnel; a transept leads to a long inclined moving sidewalk, the only one of its kind in the Metro, traversing the distance between De Maisonneuve Boulevard and Saint Catherine Street, on which the entrance is located. The moving sidewalk has been a burden to the STM because it is unique and so replacement parts must be custom-built. The walls in the entrance building, ticket hall, passage to the platforms, and transept area were updated in a stylish light slate blue and stainless steel scheme. The platform is covered in a cream-and-brown tile pattern, but in 1999, part of the walls near the exits were redone during renovations into a pattern of blue tiles and stainless steel. In October 2018, the station was temporarily closed for renovations for 8 months, as part of a significant renovation that would take 18 months to complete fully. Unlike at Honor\u00e9- Beaugrand and the adjacent Berri-UQAM, which remained partly or wholly open during their recent renovations, \"a complete closure was necessary\" for the renovations to take place, according to STM spokesperson Am\u00e9lie R\u00e9gis, as the station only had a sole entrance. Beaudry's closure was the first time that a metro station closed completely for renovations since Beaubien station closed for four months in the spring of 2015. Shuttle buses were provided during the closure to facilitate transport between the station and its two neighbouring stations, Berri-UQAM and Papineau. The station reopened, as scheduled, on June 3, 2019. Since then, work has been continued to replace the wall on the platform. The renovation has been completed in 2020. == Architecture and art == The station was renovated and partially redecorated in the R\u00e9no-M\u00e9tro program in 1999. Part of this work included a large new glassed-in entrance building by B\u00e9\u00efque, Thuot, and Legault; a unique part of its design are rainbow-coloured masts over the door, an homage to Montreal's large gay and lesbian neighbourhood, the Village (Village gai), which the station serves. These were created by Jacques Thibault. ==Origin of the name== The station is named for Beaudry Street. Pierre Beaudry (1774-1848) was the landowner across whose farm the street was opened; he also donated the land on which the Saint- Pierre-Ap\u00f4tre Church was built. ==Connecting bus routes== {| align=center class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background: #; font-size:100%; color:#FFFFFF;\"| |- !
