    "text": "Henry Drax (c. 1693\u20131755) of Ellerton Abbey, Yorkshire and Charborough, near Wareham, Dorset was a British Whig politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1718 and 1755. Ellerton Abbey House Drax was the eldest son of Thomas Drax (formerly Shatterden) of Pope's Common, Hertfordshire, Ellerton Abbey and Barbados and his wife Elizabeth Ernle, daughter of Edward Ernle of Etchilhampton, Wiltshire. He is also a grandson of James Drax, a wealthy planter in Barbados, who pioneered the cultivation of sugar with the use of African slave labour. == Slave owner == Thomas Shatterden inherited the estates of his mother's brother Colonel Henry Drax at Ellerton and in Barbados. By 1680, this Henry Drax was the owner of the largest plantation in Barbados, then in parish of St. John.Welch, P. L. V. (2003). Slave Society in the City: Bridgetown, Barbados, 1680-1834. Ian Randle Publishers. A planter- merchant, Drax had a hired 'proper persons' to act in, and do all business in Bridgetown.'Galenson, D. W. (2002). Traders, Planters and Slaves: Market Behavior in Early English America. Cambridge University Press. Shatterden changed his name to Drax in about 1692. This was a common practice among the heirs of wealthy planters in the British Caribbean, and was usually a clause that needed to be fulfilled in order to inherit their slave plantations in the West Indies. == Early life == Drax was educated at Eton College from 1706 to 1707 and was admitted at Magdalene College, Cambridge on 15 May 1710, aged 16. He married his first cousin, Elizabeth Ernle, daughter of Sir Edward Ernle, 3rd Baronet before 23 December 1719. She was the heiress of the Erle and Ernle families, by whom he obtained Charborough House and an electoral interest at Wareham. Charborough House == Political career == Drax was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Wareham at a by-election on 28 March 1718, after General Thomas Erle, his wife's grandfather, vacated the seat. He voted against the repeal of the Occasional Conformity and Schism Acts and the Peerage Bill in 1719. In 1720 he was one of the Members who were credited with \u00a31,000 stock by the South Sea Company without paying for it. He did not stand for Wareham at the 1722 British general election when his father-in-law, Sir Edward Ernle, took the family seat. At the 1727 British general election he was returned as MP for Lyme Regis. After voting with the Government on the Hessians in 1730, he then voted with the Opposition. He was returned again for Wareham at the 1734 British general election and was appointed to the stewardship of the Prince of Wales's Dorset manors in 1737. He became \u2018a great favourite\u2019 with the Prince and entertained him at Charborough in 1741. At the 1741 British general election was returned at Wareham after making a compromise with John Pitt, whose family also held an interest there. In 1744 he replaced George Lyttelton as the Prince of Wales\u2019 secretary, although Horace Walpole claimed he could not write his own name. Next year his daughter Elizabeth, who had married Augustus Berkeley, 4th Earl of Berkeley, was appointed lady of the bedchamber to the Princess of Wales. At the 1747 British general election, breaking the compromise, he was returned for Wareham with his eldest son, Thomas Erle Drax, against John Pitt, but they were both unseated on petition on 26 January 1748. When Pitt changed his seat in 1751, Henry Drax was returned in his place at a by-election on 25 January 1751. On the Prince's death in 1751 he lost his place and the prospect of a barony and went over to the Pelhams. At the 1754 British general election there was a double return and he was not seated until 30 December 1754. == Death and legacy == Drax died on 24 May 1755, leaving three sons and five daughters. As well as Thomas, his son Edward was also an MP. ==References== Category:1690s births Category:1755 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Magdalene College, Cambridge Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1715\u20131722 Category:British MPs 1727\u20131734 Category:British MPs 1734\u20131741 Category:British MPs 1741\u20131747 Category:British MPs 1747\u20131754 Henry ",
