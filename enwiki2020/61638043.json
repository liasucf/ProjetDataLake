    "text": "Valentin Gnahoua (born September 29, 1994) is a French professional gridiron football defensive end for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats of the Canadian Football League (CFL). He was the first overall pick by the Tiger-Cats in the 2019 European CFL Draft. ==Early years== Gnahoua began playing American football in 2011, joining a local semi-pro team, the Caimans du Mans, as a sixteen-year old. He was drawn to the sport after watching a National Football League game on television earlier that year. In 2016, he arrived in Canada, playing one season of collegiate football for the McGill Redmen before a sudden increase in international student tuition forced him to return to France. ==Professional career== ===Berlin Rebels=== He rejoined the Caimans in 2017, playing well enough early on in the campaign to get signed by the Berlin Rebels of the German Football League (GFL) midway through the 2017 GFL season. He recorded 47 tackles and nine sacks during his two seasons with the Rebels. ===Hamilton Tiger-Cats=== In 2019, he was announced as one of the 18 European players invited to the 2019 CFL Combine in Toronto. The following month, in April, he was selected by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats as the first overall pick in the inaugural European CFL draft, part of commissioner Randy Ambrosie's initiative to grow the league's presence internationally. He began the season as a member of the practice squad, but made his debut during their week 9 matchup against the BC Lions on August 10, recovering an onside kick that led to a second-quarter field goal in the 35-34 victory. ==Personal life== His father was a professional association football (soccer) player who was a member of the Ivory Coast national football team and played professionally in France, where Valentin was born. ==References== ==External links== * Hamilton Tiger-Cats bio * McGill Redmen bio Category:Living people Category:1994 births Category:French players of American football Category:French players of Canadian football Category:American football defensive linemen Category:Canadian football defensive linemen Category:McGill Redmen football players Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats players Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Canada Category:French expatriate sportspeople in Germany Category:French people of Ivorian descent Category:Sportspeople from Le Mans Category:World Games gold medalists Category:Competitors at the 2017 World Games ",
