    "text": "The 1921\u201322 season was the 21st season of competitive football played by Cardiff City F.C. and the team's first in the First Division of The Football League. Cardiff had won promotion to the highest tier of English football the previous season by finishing as runners-up in the Second Division, becoming the first Welsh team to reach the top tier of English football. The side endured a difficult start to the season, losing the first six matches of the campaign. However, they eventually saw results improve and finished the campaign in fourth place. In the FA Cup, Cardiff reached the fourth round before being defeated by Tottenham Hotspur after a replay. Cardiff went on to win the Welsh Cup for the third time in its history after defeating Ton Pentre in the final. During the campaign, 31 players made at least one appearance for the club. Billy Grimshaw made more appearances than any other player, featuring in 47 matches in all competitions. Len Davies finished the season as the club's highest goalscorer with 30 in all competitions. His tally of seventeen in the First Division was three short of Jimmy Gill but fourteen in cup matches, including eight in four appearances in the Welsh Cup, saw him out score his teammate. The highest attendance recorded at Ninian Park was 51,000 for the FA Cup fourth round tie against Tottenham Hotspur. However, the league fixture against Tottenham recorded an attendance of 50,000 after an extra 6-10,000 were estimated to have broken into the ground after turnstiles were closed. The lowest attendance recorded was 5,500 for Welsh Cup matches against Newport County and Merthyr Town. The average league attendance during the season was 27,000. ==Background and preseason== During the 1920\u201321 season, Cardiff City were elected into the Second Division of The Football League having spent the previous decade playing in the Southern Football League. In the side's first season, they finished as runners-up behind Birmingham on goal average after the two teams accumulated the same number of points. As a result, Cardiff won promotion to the First Division, becoming the first Welsh side to play in the top tier of English football. Manager Fred Stewart remained in charge of the first team for the tenth year. He made several additions to the squad, signing full back Tommy Brown arrived from New Brighton and forward Willie Page, the brother of Cardiff defender Jack Page, from Port Vale. Cardiff were investigated by The Football Association (FA) and the Football Association of Wales (FAW) over an illegal approach for Wolverhampton Wanderers defender Dickie Baugh Jr.. The club was found guilty with Baugh having signed an agreement with an agent acting on behalf of Cardiff despite still being contracted to Wolves. Cardiff were fined \u00a350 and Baugh \u00a320. The agent involved was subsequently banned from all football grounds under the jurisdictions of either the FA or FAW. Cardiff also made significant investments in the club's ground Ninian Park. A new pitch was laid using sea-washed turf which officials at the club labelled as \"now being equal to the best in the country\". The earthen embankments that enclosed the pitch were also built up to improve viewing for spectators. Having won promotion and reached the semifinal of the FA Cup, The Times expected Cardiff to adapt well to the higher tier. ==First Division== In the team's first match in the First Division, they met FA Cup holders Tottenham Hotspur at Ninian Park. The game therefore became the first top tier match in English football to be played in Wales and was described in The Times as \"the most important event in their (Cardiff's) history\". The fixture attracted a large crowd and when 50,000 supporters had paid and been allowed into the ground officials attempted to close the gates. However, with thousands still queuing to gain entry, supporters broke through the gates and forced their way into the ground. Club officials estimated between an extra 6-10,000 people broke into the ground after the gates were initially closed. Cardiff started the season without influential defender Jimmy Blair; Jack Page starting the opening match in his place. Tottenham received a blow early into the game as Jimmy Seed picked up an injury. Despite the setback, Tottenham proved too strong for Cardiff and scored the only goal of the game through Jimmy Banks from outside the penalty area. The excessive crowd numbers produced several unsavoury incidents which included fans taking over the score board to use as a vantage point. This experience prompted the club to approach local police to seek advice on crowd control at future matches. Defeat to Tottenham was the start of a difficult beginning in the First Division for the club. Defender Bert Smith became the first player to score for Cardiff in the division in the side's following match with a consolation goal during a 2\u20131 defeat to Astin Villa. Cardiff met Tottenham in the reverse fixture five days later but, having proven a stubborn opponent for the more experienced side in the first meeting, they were soundly beaten after conceding three goals in the opening 30 minutes of the match. The game finished 4\u20131 to Tottenham with The Times describing victory for the London-based side as \"a very easy matter\". A 4\u20130 defeat in the reverse fixture against Aston Villa followed, prompting manager Fred Stewart to make changes to his side ahead of back-to-back fixtures against Oldham Athletic. Blair returned to action having missed the first four matches and goalkeeper Herbert Kneeshaw was dropped in favour of Ben Davies. Billy Hardy, who had been ever present the previous season, was also left out due to injury along with forward George West. The changes yielded little reward as Cardiff lost both fixtures against Oldham, 1\u20130 at home, 2\u20131 away, starting the campaign with six consecutive defeats which left them bottom of the table. Cardiff's next fixture was against unbeaten league leaders Middlesbrough in a match that was described as \"The most noteworthy example of disparity of strength between contesting clubs\". In a surprising turn of form, Cardiff recorded its first victory in the First Division after causing an upset to win 3\u20131. Jimmy Gill who had been the club's top scorer the previous season scored his first goals of the campaign with a brace and Harry Nash added a third. The victory prompted an upturn in fortune for the team as they lost only one of their five matches in October, a 2\u20131 defeat to Bolton Wanderers. Gill enjoyed a fine run of form during this time, scoring six goals in the five matches including braces during victories over West Bromwich Albion and Bolton in the reverse fixture. With the club struggling for goals, October also saw the arrival of Joe Clennell from Everton for \u00a31,500. In an attempt to recoup some of the transfer fee, two forwards who had played an integral role in promotion in the 1920\u201321 season, Arthur Cashmore and Fred Pagnam, were sold having failed to score in a combined 17 appearances. Back-to-back fixtures against Manchester City at the start of November yielded only a point for Cardiff after losing 2\u20130 at home and drawing 1\u20131 away. However, two victories against Everton later in the month proved a turning point in the season for Cardiff. The departure of Pagnam allowed Len Davies to make his first appearances of the season, scoring all three of Cardiff's goals in 2\u20131 and 1\u20130 victories. The second fixture also saw Hardy and Smith return after injury layoffs. A remarkable run of form ensued with Cardiff losing only one of their following thirteen league matches led by the goals of Davies, Gill and Clennell. Davies also scored the first hat-trick in The Football League by a Cardiff player during a 6\u20133 victory over Bradford City on 21 January 1922. As well as Bradford, the team's run included wins over Birmingham (twice), Arsenal, Preston North End, Blackburn Rovers and Chelsea. The Times described the team during this time as appearing \"almost invincible\" as their improved form lifted them to sixth in the table. The team's victory over Blackburn during this spell saw an unusual debutant when club trainer George Latham was forced into action. Hours before the game was due to start, Gill and Evans both went down with sickness and only one player, Nash, had travelled in reserve. Latham, who had played professionally previously, stepped in and became the oldest player in the club's history at 41 years old. On 25 February, Cardiff suffered its first defeat since early December, losing 1\u20130 to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge as the opposition defence proved impregnable. The team recovered to beat Sheffield United 2\u20130 in their following match with goals from Clennell and Ken MacDonald but suffered a further blow after losing 1\u20130 to struggling Bradford who were 21st in the table. Two matches against reigning First Division champions Burnley produced positive results as the team's drew 1\u20131 before Cardiff won the reverse fixture 4\u20132 at Ninian Park. Len Davies scored a brace with Gill and Jack Evans scoring one each. Cardiff repeated the pattern in its following two matches against Newcastle United, drawing away before Len Davies scored the only goal in a home victory. Despite taking the lead early in the match, Cardiff suffered a 5\u20131 defeat to league leaders Liverpool on 15 April. Two days later, they lost heavily again in a 3\u20131 defeat to Blackburn. They met Liverpool in the reverse fixture on 22 April, with their opponents already having secured the First Division title, winning 2\u20130. Cardiff finished the season with consecutive draws against Sheffield United and Manchester United before beating the then relegated Manchester again in the final game. The side finished its inaugural season in the First Division in fourth place. ===Match results=== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=col|Date ! scope=col|Opponents ! scope=col|Result ! scope=col class=unsortable|Goalscorers ! scope=col|Attendance |- | 27 August 1921 ! scope=row| Tottenham Hotspur (H) | align=center | 0\u20131 | | align=center | 50,000 |- | 29 August 1921 ! scope=row| Aston Villa (A) | align=center | 1\u20132 | Smith | align=center | 30,000 |- | 3 September 1921 ! scope=row| Tottenham Hotspur (A) | align=center | 1\u20134 | West | align=center | 45,000 |- | 5 September 1921 ! scope=row| Aston Villa (A) | align=center | 0\u20134 | | align=center | 40,000 |- | 10 September 1921 ! scope=row| Oldham Athletic (H) | align=center | 0\u20131 | | align=center | 20,000 |- | 17 September 1921 ! scope=row| Oldham Athletic (A) | align=center | 1\u20132 | Grimshaw | align=center | 18,000 |- | 24 September 1921 ! scope=row| Middlesbrough (H) | align=center | 3\u20131 | Gill (2), Nash | align=center | 35,000 |- | 1 October 1921 ! scope=row| Middlesbrough (A) | align=center | 0\u20130 | | align=center | 30,000 |- | 8 October 1921 ! scope=row| Bolton Wanderers (H) | align=center | 1\u20132 | Gill | align=center | 40,000 |- | 15 October 1921 ! scope=row| Bolton Wanderers (A) | align=center | 2\u20131 | Gill (2) | align=center | 25,486 |- | 22 October 1921 ! scope=row| West Bromwich Albion (A) | align=center | 2\u20132 | Keenor, Gill | align=center | 20,000 |- | 29 October 1921 ! scope=row| West Bromwich Albion (H) | align=center | 2\u20130 | Gill (2) | align=center | 35,000 |- | 5 November 1921 ! scope=row| Manchester City (A) | align=center | 0\u20132 | | align=center | 38,000 |- | 12 November 1921 ! scope=row| Manchester City (H) | align=center | 1\u20131 | Gill | align=center | 25,000 |- | 19 November 1921 ! scope=row| Everton (H) | align=center | 2\u20131 | L.

Cardiff won the match 4\u20131, following a brace from Len Davies and one each from Nash and Clennell, and were praised for a \"very brilliant performance\". In the second round, the team was drawn against Third Division side Southampton who they had defeated in the third round the previous year. The lower ranked side held Cardiff to a 1\u20131 draw at The Dell but goals from Gill and Clennell in the replay sent Cardiff through in a 2\u20130 victory. The side met Second Division leaders Nottingham Forest in the third round. Len Davies scored his second brace in the competition to lead the side to a 4\u20131 victory in front of over 50,000 spectators at Ninian Park. Their victory led to a fourth round meeting with cup holders Tottenham Hotspur. The match was hotly anticipated, being described by The Times as \"the greatest of the day\". Over 50,000 fans again attended Ninian Park for the tie and despite Cardiff having the better of the first half, Tottenham took the lead through Jimmy Seed after the forward dribbled through the defence to finish past Ben Davies with a powerful shot. Cardiff pressed for the remainder of the match with Billy Grimshaw, Gill and Clennell all going close. As the match entered the final minute, Len Davies was able to turn the ball into the net to salvage a replay for Cardiff. The replay was held at Tottenham's ground White Hart Lane and such was the demand for tickets, match officials agreed for spectators to be allowed to sit or kneel to the very edge of the pitch. Tottenham enjoyed the brighter start to the match but Cardiff took the lead when Jack Evans beat his man on the wing and crossed for Gill to convert. In the second half, Tottenham continued to attack and were rewarded with an equaliser when Jimmy Dimmock headed in from a corner. Tottenham went on to score a second when Ben Davies failed to clear a cross and the ball fell to Charlie Wilson who scored the winning goal. The goal was controversial as Cardiff players complained that goalkeeper Davies had been taken out as he attempted to deal with the cross but the referee ignored their complaints and the goal stood. Tottenham advanced to the semifinal where they lost 2\u20131 to Preston North End. ===Match results=== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=col|Date ! scope=col|Round ! scope=col|Opponents ! scope=col|Result ! scope=col class=unsortable|Goalscorers ! scope=col|Attendance |- | 7 January 1922 | First ! scope=row| Manchester United (A) | align=center | 4\u20131 | L.

A strong Cardiff side ultimately proved far too strong for Newport as the match ended 7\u20130 with Len Davies scoring four, Grimshaw two and Keenor one. The side continued their free-scoring form in the following round where the defeat Meryhyr Town where Len Davies scored a hat-trick during a 5\u20130 win. In the semifinal, they were drawn against Pontypridd who had eliminated them from the competition the previous year. Keenor, Gill and Jack Evans each scored once to secure a 3\u20130 victory and send Cardiff through to the final. Ton Pentre were their opponents as Cardiff secured their third Welsh Cup title after winning 2\u20130 at Taff Vale Park. Gill and Len Davies each scored once, Davies' goal was his eighth in the competition. ===Match results=== ;Key *In result column, Cardiff City's score shown first *H = Home match *A = Away match *pen. = Penalty kick *o.g. = Own goal ;Results {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- ! scope=col|Date ! scope=col|Round ! scope=col|Opponents ! scope=col|Result ! scope=col class=unsortable|Goalscorers ! scope=col|Attendance |- | 18 January 1922 | Third ! scope=row| Newport County (H) | align=center | 7\u20131 | Keenor, Grimshaw (2), L.

Billy Grimshaw made the most appearances of any Cardiff player during the season, featuring in 47 matches in all competitions. He also made the most league appearances with 38. Jack Evans was the next highest with 44 appearances and a further five players made 40 or more appearances. Goalkeeper Tom Farquharson made a single appearance in the final match of the season. He would go on to set a club record for appearances in The Football League with 445 that stood until 1985 when it was surpassed by Phil Dwyer. Farquharson was one of six players who featured in just one match for the club during the campaign. The others included Albert Barnett, who was recovering from a broken leg suffered the previous season, and George Latham, the club's trainer who played one match during an injury crisis. At the age of 41, Latham remains the oldest player ever to feature in a competitive fixture for Cardiff. Two of the players, Ernie Anderson and James Melville, never played another match for Cardiff before moving on. Len Davies was the club's top goalscorer with 30 goals in all competitions. Although he scored three less than Jimmy Gill in league competition, his prolific scoring in cup competitions saw him outscore his teammate. Davies and Gill were two of the three players to score ten or more goals for Cardiff during the season, the third being Joe Clennell. Eleven players scored at least one goal during the course of the season and one opposition player scored an own goal. ===Player statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !rowspan=2 style=\"width:20em\"scope=col|Player !rowspan=2|Position !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|First Division !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|FA Cup !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|Welsh Cup !colspan=2 style=\"width:10em\"scope=col|Total |- !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals !style=\"width:5em\"|Apps !style=\"width:5em\"|Goals |- ! scope=row|Ernie Anderson |HB |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Albert Barnett |DF |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Jimmy Blair |DF |32||0||6||0||3||0||41||0 |- ! scope=row|Charlie Brittain |DF |27||0||1||0||4||0||32||0 |- ! scope=row|Tommy Brown |DF |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Arthur Cashmore |FW |4||0||0||0||0||0||4||0 |- ! scope=row|Joe Clark |FW |1||0||2||0||0||0||3||0 |- ! scope=row|Joe Clennell |FW |32||10||6||3||2||0||40||13 |- ! scope=row|Ben Davies |GK |34||0||6||0||3||0||43||0 |- ! scope=row|Len Davies |FW |25||17||6||5||4||8||35||30 |- ! scope=row|Herbie Evans |HB |29||0||6||0||4||0||39||0 |- ! scope=row|Jack Evans |FW |36||1||4||0||4||1||44||2 |- ! scope=row|Sidney Evans |FW |4||0||0||0||1||0||5||0 |- ! scope=row|Tom Farquharson |GK |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Jimmy Gill |FW |34||20||5||4||3||2||42||26 |- ! scope=row|Billy Grimshaw |FW |38||6||6||0||3||2||47||8 |- ! scope=row|Billy Hardy |HB |32||1||6||0||2||0||40||1 |- ! scope=row|Eddie Jenkins |HB |9||0||0||0||0||0||9||0 |- ! scope=row|Fred Keenor |DF |27||1||1||0||3||2||31||3 |- ! scope=row|Herbert Kneeshaw |GK |7||0||0||0||1||0||8||0 |- ! scope=row|George Latham |HB |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Ken MacDonald |FW |4||2||0||0||0||0||4||2 |- ! scope=row|James Melville |DF |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Harry Nash |FW |8||1||1||1||2||1||11||3 |- ! scope=row|Jimmy Nelson |DF |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Billy Newton |HB |1||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- ! scope=row|Jack Nock |FW |2||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- ! scope=row|Jack Page |DF |21||0||6||0||1||0||28||0 |- ! scope=row|Fred Pagnam |FW |13||0||0||0||0||0||13||0 |- ! scope=row|Bert Smith |DF |29||1||4||0||4||0||37||1 |- ! scope=row|George West |FW |4||1||0||0||0||0||4||1 |- |} FW = Forward, HB = Halfback, GK = Goalkeeper, DF = Defender Sources: ==Aftermath== Brown and Willie Page, the two signings made at the start of the 1921\u201322 campaign, would both depart after a single season with only Brown having played for the first-team. Such was Stewart's confidence in his side that the club made no major signings prior to the start of the following season and only a poor run of form toward the end of 1922 prompted the arrival of a small number of players. As a result of the team's performance, they were regarded as an established side for the 1922\u201323 season with The Times describing the side as possessing \"undeniable all-round ability\" in its preseason report. ==References== Specific Bibliography * * * Category:Cardiff City F.C. seasons Cardiff ",
