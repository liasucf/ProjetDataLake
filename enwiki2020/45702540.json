Having been given a scholarship by the city of Marseille, he went to study under Antoine Bontoux at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris until his studies were interrupted by the Franco-Prussian War. In 1871 he resumed under Jules Cavelier and went on to win second prize in the 1876 Prix de Rome for his Jason carrying off the golden fleece. Two years later he exhibited his GanymedeMoika Palace at the Salon, winning second prize. A bronze version (destroyed in World War II) was placed in the park at Aix-les-Bains and seen there by Paul Verlaine, who wrote a homoerotic poem about it in 1889.Dominique Fernandez, Amants d'Apollon: L'homosexualit\u00e9 dans la culture, Grasset 2015, \"Un Ganym\u00e8de aquatique\" Official commissions now began to come Turcan's way, including statues of Cardinal de Richelieu (1880) and the historian Jules Michelet (1882) for the Hotel de Ville, Paris. In 1883 his best-known statue, depicting the fable of The Blind Man and the Lame, won him a first class medal at the Salon. Subsequently the French state arranged for him to work up the plaster cast in marble, a project he worked on for three years,M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, lettres et beaux-arts de Marseille, 1917, p.106 and it was exhibited at the 1888 Salon. On this occasion it received a medal of honour, while the Revue des Deux Mondes devoted to it several pages of enthusiastic description, pointing out its dynamic yet compassionate qualities.Georges Lafenestre, Le Salon de 1888: La Sculpture, vol. 88, July- August, pp.153-5 The next year it was given a further prize at the Universal Exhibition and afterwards was placed in the Mus\u00e9e du Luxembourg. Later Turcan urged the city of Marseille to fund a bronze version. This was eventually agreed in 1892 and, after being exhibited at the Paris World Fair of 1900, the statue was installed in the city in 1901. Subsequently it was to be melted down during World War II.Marseille, ville sculpt\u00e9e But despite success and the award of the Legion of Honour in 1888, financial difficulties forced Turcan to work for a period in the studio of Auguste Rodin, where he was responsible for carving a large-scale version of the sculptor's The Kiss. Later official commissions included the figure of Painting on the east fa\u00e7ade of the Cour Carr\u00e9e in the Louvre Palace and the war memorial for the fallen of the Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne militia during the Franco-Prussian war.Illustrated minutely online Eventually the victim of a lingering ataxia malady, he died shortly before the money raised by fellow artists to support him could be delivered.Chronique des arts et de la curiosit\u00e9 for 1895, p.8 ==Works== Turcan's great war monument can be found in Marseille where the All\u00e9e Gambetta and All\u00e9e de La Canebi\u00e8re meet, while the marble version of \"The Blindman and the Lame\" (L'Aveugle et le Paralytique) is now in the episcopal palace of Arles.
