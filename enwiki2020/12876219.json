    "text": "The Roundhouse Tapes is a live double album by Swedish progressive metal band Opeth. The CD was recorded on 9 November 2006 and was released on 23 October 2007 in the US, on 5 November in Europe, and on 20 November in the rest of the world. A two-disc DVD version was released on 10 November 2008, and includes exclusive menu music written by Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt and Per Wiberg. The title is a play on the name of Iron Maiden's first release The Soundhouse Tapes, as well as the venue where the record was recorded. \u00c5kerfeldt said, \"The Roundhouse concert will always be a very memorable gig for us for many reasons, but most importantly it caught the band at the peak of the Ghost Reveries tour\". This is the final Opeth release with Peter Lindgren. ==Track listing== The DVD also features fan and band interviews, sound-check footage and a photo gallery of the concert. ==Personnel== ===Opeth=== * Mikael \u00c5kerfeldt \u2013 guitar, vocals, mixing, direction * Peter Lindgren \u2013 guitar * Mart\u00edn M\u00e9ndez \u2013 bass guitar * Per Wiberg \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals * Martin \"Axe\" Axenrot \u2013 drums ===Additional personnel=== *Jens Bogren \u2013 mixing *Travis Smith \u2013 cover artwork, album design, model, photography *Heather Elizabeth \u2013 photography ==References== Category:Opeth albums Category:2007 live albums ",
