    "text": "Antigua cathedral, marking Pedro de Portocarrero's tomb Pedro de Portocarrero (c. 1504Lenkersdorf 1993, p. 51. \u2013 c. 1539) was a Spanish conquistador who was active in the early 16th century in Guatemala, and Chiapas in southern Mexico.Lenkersdorf 2004, p. 78. He was one of the few Spanish noblemen that took part in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Americas, and was distantly related to prominent conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, who appointed him as an official in early colonial Guatemala. ==Family and background== Pedro de Portocarrero was a nobleman who was distantly related to prominent conquistador Pedro de Alvarado.Polo Sifontes 1986, p. 61. Kramer 1994, p. 54. Pedro de Portocarrero was the son of Juan Portocarrero.Lenkersdorf 1993, p. 44.Some sources claim Pedro de Portocarrero's father was also named Pedro de Portocarrero, and was married to In\u00e9s de Alvarado, who was the paternal aunt of Pedro de Alvarado; see for example Vega 2003, p. 188. Portocarrero's paternal grandfather was the comendador Rodrigo Portocarrero, a knight of the Order of Santiago. His mother was Beatriz Pacheco, daughter of Juan Pacheco, Marquess of Villena, a powerful nobleman in the court of King Henry IV of Castile.Lenkersdorf 1993, pp. 43\u201344. One of Portocarrero's grandfathers was the paternal uncle of Pedro de Alvarado.Kramer 1994, p.54n18. Portocarrero was one of the few members of the Spanish aristocracy that took part in the early stages of the Spanish conquest of the Americas;Lenkersdorf 1993, p. 42. his father was the second count of Medell\u00edn. He was of Portuguese ancestry, from a family that became prominent in the borderlands between Spain and Portugal. As a younger son of the Count of Medell\u00edn, Pedro served in a minor role in the court of the future Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor in Flanders, since the Portocarreros preferred to have their sons educated as pages before progressing into military or ecclesiastical roles.Lenkersdorf 1993, pp. 46\u201347. Various branches of the family became involved in both sides of the political disputes that engulfed their territory, which may have been why Pedro de Portocarrero left Spain.Lenkersdorf 1993, pp. 44\u201345. He arrived in Mexico in late 1521 or early 1522.Lenkersdorf 1993, p. 46. ==Spanish conquest== Pedro de Portocarrero arrived in Mexico a short time after the fall of Tenochtitlan, and thus did not take part in the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire.Lenkersdorf 1993, p. 46n49. He was placed under the command of Pedro de Alvarado and took part in the campaigns of conquest in Oaxaca, P\u00e1nuco (Veracruz), and Central America. In July 1524, Pedro de Alvarado appointed Pedro de Portocarrero as a regidor (councillor) of the newly founded Spanish settlement of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, at that time located at the Kaqchikel Maya city of Iximche.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 100. Soon afterwards, Portocarrero accompanied Alvarado on his expedition to Cuzcatlan (in modern El Salvador).Lovell, Lutz, Kramer and Swezey 2013, pp. 22\u201323. In August 1526, Alvarado named Portocarrero as one of two alcaldes (magistrates) of Guatemala.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 119\u2013120. In the late 1520s Portocarrero was successful in putting down a Kaqchikel rebellion.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 132. Shortly after the initial Spanish invasion of Guatemala, Alvarado granted Portocarrero the extensive encomienda of Sacatep\u00e9quez and Ostuncalco, the largest and most valuable encomienda in Guatemala, which incorporated the entire southern Mam Maya region.Reeves 2006, pp. 23, 201n25. In late 1527, Portocarrero led an expedition into Chiapas and, in January 1528,G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o 2014, p. 57. successfully established the first Spanish town there, within the territory of the Tojolabal Maya. The new town was called San Crist\u00f3bal de los Llanos, and was located in the Comit\u00e1n valley. Portocarrero's expedition penetrated Chiapas as far as the Tzotzil town of Huixtan. At Huixtan, Portocarrero met a rival Spanish expedition headed by Diego de Mazariegos, and after protracted negotiations Portocarrero retreated back to Guatemala.G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o 2014, p. 58. ==Marriage and death== Pedro de Portocarrero married Alvarado's daughter Leanor, probably in early 1536. In 1536, Portocarrero accompanied Alvarado to Honduras and fought against the Chontal Maya of the Naco valley, where an uprising against the Spanish was underway.Sherman 1979, pp. 157\u2013158. Portocarrero died \"of old age\" before 1539.Recinos 1952, 1986, pp. 166\u2013167. At the time of his death, he still held Sacatep\u00e9quez and Ostuncalco in encomienda.Recinos 1952, 1986, p. 224. ==See also== *Spanish conquest of Chiapas ==Footnotes== ==Citations== ==References== :G\u00f3mez Couti\u00f1o, Jos\u00e9 Francisco (2014).
