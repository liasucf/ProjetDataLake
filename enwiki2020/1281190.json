    "text": "The beguine is a dance and music form, similar to a slow rhumba. It was popular in the 1930s, coming from the islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique, where in local Creole Beke or Begue means a White person, and Beguine is the female form. It is a combination of Latin folk dance and French ballroom dance, and is a spirited but slow, close dance with a roll of the hips (a movement inherited from rumba). After Cole Porter wrote the song \"Begin the Beguine\", the dance became more widely known beyond the Caribbean. The song was introduced in Porter's Jubilee (1935). In 1984, Italian pop music duo Al Bano and Romina Power released the song \"Al ritmo de beguine (Ti amo)\" from their album Effetto amore. ==See also== *Biguine == References == Category:Ballroom dance Category:Latin dances ",
