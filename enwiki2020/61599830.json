The hero is a young boy with mechanical skills who learns to question the regime. Rich Horton of SF Site singled the story out as his favorite from the issue, calling it \"a good fun read\" despite some issues with plausibility and characterization. Steven Sawicki of the Science Fiction Chronicle was less positive, calling the story \"a real struggle to get through\" and criticizing it for lack of clarity and excessive use of slang. * \"The Mycojuana Incident\" (novella in Analog, February 2001): A doctor investigates a fungal infestation which turns out to be caused by the spraying of anti-marijuana parasitic mold. Governmental agents show up to cover up the case. Steven Sawicki described it as \"very typical sf of the bad government, libertarian freedom fighter type\" but also called it an entertaining story with \"sharp and clever\" writing. * \"Navajo Moon-Bird\" (novella in Analog, December 2001): A Navajo girl thwarts sabotage of a spaceship bound for a colony on the moon. Rich Horton criticized the characterization of the villains as one-dimensional but called the story \"exciting and rousing\".
