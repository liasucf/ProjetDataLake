The church was closed for restoration from early in 1877 which took place under the supervision of John Brightmore Mitchell-Withers, architect of Sheffield. The chancel arch was rebuilt, adding an organ and chapel. The chancel was completely renovated. The floor was laid with tiles and the seating was renewed. The roofs were repaired and covered by red Staffordshire tiling. The work was carried out by Shillitoe and Morgan of Campstall, Doncaster. New heating apparatus by Stuart and Smith of Sheffield was installed, with gas lighting by Hydes and Wigfull of Sheffield. The bells were recast by Taylor of Loughborough, a clock provided by Smith of Derby, and the organ enlarged by Foster and Andrews of Hull. The total cost of the restoration was around \u00a36,000 (). The church reopened on 16 July 1878 The church was destroyed by fire in January 1897 but fortunately, the Cavendish chapel of 1624 was saved. The church was rebuilt by the architect Louis Ambler starting on 9 September 1897 and was consecrated by the Bishop of Southwell on 21 September 1898. The church was again badly damaged by fire on 13 January 1960 when the east end of the church, the vestry and high altar were destroyed, and half the slate and timber roof were damaged. ==Cavendish chapel== The chapel was built around 1624 with a Jacobean style roof to house the remains of the Cavendish family.
