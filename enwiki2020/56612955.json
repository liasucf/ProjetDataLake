Ahead of the Test series, there was a four-day practice match in Dubai. In February 2018, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) looked at the possibility of hosting this series and New Zealand's tour to the UAE in Malaysia instead of the UAE, due to domestic Twenty20 fixture congestion in Sharjah. In May 2018, the PCB invited Australia to play the fixtures in Pakistan, but Cricket Australia said it would not allow matches to be moved there. In June 2018, the PCB and the Emirates Cricket Board (ECB) agreed to play Pakistan's future matches in the UAE. In September 2018, both Mitchell Marsh and Josh Hazlewood were appointed joint vice-captains of the Australia Test cricket team. The following month, both Mitchell Marsh and Alex Carey were appointed joint vice-captains of the Australia T20I cricket team. During the second Test match, an extra T20I match for Australia against the United Arab Emirates was added to the tour itinerary. Australia were scheduled to play the UAE in a Twenty20 warm-up match before the T20I series against Pakistan, when the match was upgraded to a full T20I fixture. It was the first time that the UAE played a full T20I match against Australia. Australia won the one-off match by seven wickets. Pakistan won the Test series 1\u20130, after the first match ended in a draw. Pakistan won the T20I series against Australia 3\u20130. ==Squads== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin:auto\" |- !colspan=2|Tests !colspan=3|T20Is |- ! ! ! ! ! |- style=\"vertical-align:top\" | * Sarfaraz Ahmed (c, wk) * Mohammad Abbas * Azhar Ali * Hasan Ali * Faheem Ashraf * Bilal Asif * Babar Azam * Mohammad Hafeez * Mir Hamza * Shadab Khan * Wahab Riaz * Mohammad Rizwan * Usman Salahuddin * Asad Shafiq * Yasir Shah * Haris Sohail * Imam-ul-Haq * Fakhar Zaman | * Tim Paine (c, wk) * Mitchell Marsh (vc) * Ashton Agar * Brendan Doggett * Aaron Finch * Travis Head * Jon Holland * Usman Khawaja * Marnus Labuschagne * Nathan Lyon * Shaun Marsh * Michael Neser * Matt Renshaw * Peter Siddle * Mitchell Starc | * Sarfaraz Ahmed (c, wk) * Shaheen Afridi * Asif Ali * Hasan Ali * Faheem Ashraf * Babar Azam * Sahibzada Farhan * Mohammad Hafeez * Shadab Khan * Usman Khan * Shoaib Malik * Waqas Maqsood * Hussain Talat * Imad Wasim * Fakhar Zaman | * Aaron Finch (c) * Mitchell Marsh (vc) * Alex Carey (vc, wk) * Ashton Agar * Nathan Coulter-Nile * Chris Lynn * Nathan Lyon * Glenn Maxwell * Ben McDermott * D'Arcy Short * Peter Siddle * Billy Stanlake * Mitchell Starc * Andrew Tye * Adam Zampa | * Rohan Mustafa (c) * Ashfaq Ahmed * Qadeer Ahmed * Shaiman Anwar * Imran Haider * Amir Hayat * Amjad Khan * Zahoor Khan * Mohammad Naveed * Fahad Nawaz * Ahmed Raza * Ghulam Shabber (wk) * Rameez Shahzad * Tahir Sultan * Chirag Suri |} After Pakistan's Test squad was named, Mohammad Hafeez was later added to the team.
