Wardington Manor, 2015 Chamberlayne was the only son of George Chamberlayne of Wardington and his wife Elizabeth Denton, daughter of Alexander Denton, MP of Hillesden. He matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford on 24 March 1721, aged 17. He married Constance Hardy, daughter of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Hardy, MP on. 27 May 1732. Chamberlayne was returned as a Whig Member of Parliament for Buckingham at a by-election on 20 February 1728 on the interest of his uncle, Alexander Denton. In Parliament he voted with the Administration on the army 1732 and on the excise bill in 1733. He was returned unopposed for Buckingham at the 1734 British general election and went into opposition, probably under Lord Cobham and the Grenvilles. He voted against the Government on the Spanish convention in 1739 and on the chairman of the elections committee in 1741. He was returned again at the 1741 British general election. After Walpole's fall in 1742, there is no record of his voting. He seems to have broken with the Grenvilles, who went over to the Government, and remained in opposition. He was not put forward for Buckingham in 1747 and he never stood again. Chamberlayne succeeded his uncle Alexander Denton at Hillesden 1740 and took name of Denton. He died on 14 May 1757 leaving one daughter, Elizabeth, who married Wenman Coke. ==References== Category:1700s births Category:1747 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1727\u20131734 Category:British MPs 1734\u20131741 Category:British MPs 1741\u20131747 ",
