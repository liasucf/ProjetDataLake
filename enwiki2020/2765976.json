His parents are immigrants from Taiwan.https://articles.latimes.com/1988-09-04/sports/sp-2028_1_michael- chang ==Tennis career== ===Juniors=== Ho first came to the tennis world's attention as an exceptionally successful junior player. He won several junior tennis events in the 1980s, and set a number of 'youngest-ever' records. ===Pro tour=== In August 1988, Ho became the youngest male player in the open era to play in the main draw of the US Open singles at the age of 15 years and 2 months. He lost the first round match to Johan Kriek 6\u20134, 7\u20136, 7\u20136. That same month, Ho became the second youngest male player to win a main draw match at a top-level tour event when he beat Matt Anger in the first round at Rye Brook 6\u20134, 3\u20136, 6\u20134, just after Argentina's Franco Dav\u00edn. Ho's early successes drew many comparisons with Michael Chang, another Asian American tennis player who achieved great success as a junior. However Ho did not manage to make the same kind of impact on the professional circuit as Chang (who went on to win the French Open and reach the World No. 2 singles ranking). Ho enjoyed some success in satellite tournaments, but did not win any top-level singles events on the tour. He did, however, win four tour doubles titles (Beijing in 1994, and Beijing, Hong Kong and Indian Wells in 1995). Ho's professional career was hampered by injuries. In 1995, Ho and Brett Steven became the fastest-ever losers of a match at Wimbledon. In the very first point of their Men's Doubles match, Steven served and Ho tried to intercept the return at the net, only to injure his back. The pair thus had had to forfeit the match after just one rally, which had lasted all of five seconds. The back injury was to recur again in future years, and eventually led to Ho's retirement from the tour in 1997. During his professional career, Ho reached career-high rankings of World No. 85 in singles and World No. 13 in doubles. His career prize-money totalled $793,819. ==Post-retirement== Since retiring from the tour, Ho has completed a degree at Rice University in Houston and worked as a tennis journalist. In 2011, Ho was inducted into the USTA Florida Hall of Fame. He is currently a partner at global recruiting firm Heidrick & Struggles in Houston, TX. ==Doubles titles == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#eeeeee\" |Legend (Doubles) |- bgcolor=\"#f3e6d7\" | Grand Slam tournaments (0) |- bgcolor=\"ffffcc\" | Tennis Masters Cup (0) |- bgcolor=\"#e9e9e9\" | ATP Masters Series (1) |- bgcolor=\"#d4f1c5\" | ATP International Series Gold (0) |- | ATP International Series (3) |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" |No. |Date |Tournament |Surface |Partner in Final |Opponent in Final |Score in Final |- | 1. | Oct 1994 | Beijing, China | Carpet | Kent Kinnear | David Adams Andrei Olhovskiy | 7\u20136, 6\u20133 |- bgcolor=\"#e9e9e9\" | 2. | Mar 1995 | Indian Wells, U.S. | Hard | Brett Steven | Gary Muller Piet Norval | 6\u20134, 7\u20136 |- | 3. | Apr 1995 | Hong Kong | Hard | Mark Philippoussis | John Fitzgerald Anders J\u00e4rryd | 6\u20131, 6\u20137, 7\u20136 |- | 4. | Oct 1995 | Beijing, China | Carpet | S\u00e9bastien Lareau | Dick Norman Fernon Wibier | 7\u20136, 7\u20136 |} ===Runners-up (3)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#efefef\" |No. |Date |Tournament |Surface |Partner in Final |Opponent in Final |Score in Final |- bgcolor=\"#d4f1c5\" | 1. | Feb 1995 | Memphis, U.S. | Hard (i) | Brett Steven | Jared Palmer Richey Reneberg | 6\u20134, 6\u20137, 1\u20136 |- | 2. | Nov 1995 | Moscow, Russia | Carpet | Brett Steven | Byron Black Jared Palmer | 4\u20136, 6\u20133, 3\u20136 |- | 3. | Jan 1996 | Adelaide, Australia | Hard | Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman | Todd Woodbridge Mark Woodforde | 5\u20137, 6\u20137 |} == References == ==External links== * * Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:American male tennis players Category:American people of Chinese descent Category:American people of Taiwanese descent Category:People from Winter Haven, Florida Category:Rice University alumni Category:Tennis people from Florida Category:Sportspeople of Chinese descent Category:Taiwanese-American tennis players ",
