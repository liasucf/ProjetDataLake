    "text": "Los Lobos Goes Disney is a covers album by the Mexican American rock group Los Lobos, on which the band interprets songs from the Disney catalogue, most of which were featured in their animated films. It was released on 27 October 2009 through Disney Sound.Los Lobos Goes Disney press release. loslobos.org. Retrieved on 16 August 2019. The album blends different musical styles across thirteen songs, such as rock and roll, surf-rock, Americana, country folk, Mexican norte\u00f1o and Tejano music, Cajun, zydeco, ska, and blues jazz. Los Lobos saxophone player Steve Berlin said, \"The kids record doesn't sound like a kids record. It just sounds like Los Lobos playing funky old songs.\" ==Reception== AllMusic reviewer William Ruhlmann gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half stars out of five, and wrote, \"Los Lobos Goes Disney could have been called Disney goes Los Lobos instead, since the group applies its familiar mixture of musical styles to Disney songs.\" He added that the band's interpretations \"are hardly definitive, but they are enjoyable\". Doug Collette, writing for Glide Magazine, gave it five out of ten, saying that right from the start of album opener \"Heigh Ho\", \"it\u2019s apparent Los Lobos inhabit the music as much as it inhabits them. An onslaught of percussion gives way to chanting in Spanish, an arrangement that might just as easily adorn one of the band\u2019s originals.\" Collette also felt that the band were \"as tasteful as usual throughout\". John Metzger of The Music Box magazine gave the album three stars out of five, and said that the original songs aren\u2019t necessarily well suited to Los Lobos\u2019 style, \"so the success of Los Lobos Goes Disney largely is dependent upon the band\u2019s ability to find a unique perspective for delivering this material ... the results are merely adequate, even if they are passively enjoyable.\" The Fowler Tribune's Patrick Varine called it \"a really, really entertaining cover album\", and said that it \"plays just as well for kids as it will for adults\". ==Track listing== == Personnel == Credits adapted from the album's liner notes. ;Los Lobos * David Hidalgo \u2013 vocals, guitar, accordion, hidalguera, requinto jarocho, keyboards * Cesar Rosas \u2013 vocals, guitar, bajo sexto * Louie P\u00e9rez \u2013 vocals, guitar, jarana * Conrad Lozano \u2013 vocals, bass, guitarron * Steve Berlin \u2013 saxophone, flute, percussion, keyboards ;Additional musicians * Cougar Estrada \u2013 drums, percussion, keyboards * Vicki Rosas \u2013 vocals on \"Grim Grinning Ghosts\" ;Production * Los Lobos \u2013 producer * Mark Johnson \u2013 engineer, mixing * Greg Morgenstein \u2013 engineer, mixing * Dave McNair \u2013 mastering * Mando Tavares \u2013 production assistance * Louie P\u00e9rez \u2013 art direction * Steve Gerdes \u2013 art direction * Anabel Sinn \u2013 album design * Louie P\u00e9rez III \u2013 drawing ==References== Category:Los Lobos albums Category:2009 albums Category:Disney Sound albums Category:Children's music albums Category:Covers albums ",
