In 2014, Nasri announced his retirement from international football after being omitted for the 2014 World Cup. == Personal life == Nasri was born in Sept\u00e8mes-les- Vallons, a northern suburb of Marseille, to French nationals of Algerian descent.

Nasri's grandparents emigrated to France from Algeria. His mother is a housewife and his father previously worked as a bus driver before becoming his son's personal manager. At the start of his football career, Nasri initially played under his mother's surname, Ben Sa\u00efd, before switching to Nasri, his father's surname, following his selection to the France under-16 team.

Upon noticing his prodigious talent, his parents signed him up to play with the local club in his hometown. Nasri spent one year playing with the club in La Gavotte Peyret before moving to Pennes Mirabeau in nearby Mirabeau at age seven. While playing with Pennes, Nasri was discovered by Marseille scout Freddy Assolen, who had been informed of the player's talent through local word of mouth. After noticing Nasri's skill in person, Assolen recruited the player to travel with a group of other young players to Italy to participate in a youth tournament where they would play against the youth academies of Milan and Juventus. Nasri impressed at the tournament and Assolen was jokingly told by a Milan scout that \"he [Nasri] stays here, you leave him\".

Marseille officials had been eager to sign Nasri to a contract in an attempt to not undergo a situation similar to the departure of Mathieu Flamini, in which the player departed the club without Marseille receiving any compensation. As a result of his professional contract, Nasri was promoted to the senior team by Anigo and assigned the number 22 shirt. He began the season playing on the club's reserve team and appeared in four matches before earning a call up to the senior team in September 2004.

In total with the under-17s, he made 16 appearances and scored six goals. Due to increased playing time at his parent club Marseille, Nasri's stint with the under-18 team was uneventful, appearing in only four matches. The foursome of Nasri, Ben Arfa, Benzema and M\u00e9nez returned to international play together for under-19 duty. The four were joined by Issiar Dia, Blaise Matuidi and Serge Gakp\u00e9 with the objective of winning the 2006 UEFA European Under-19 Championship.

Nasri said he was \"very happy and very proud\" to be called into the national team, stating that the call-up was all the more satisfying as the game was an important European Championship qualifier. He appeared on the bench in the match against Lithuania, but failed to make an appearance. Nasri made his international debut on 28 March against Austria at age 19. He started the match and was involved with the only goal, delivering the free-kick from which Karim Benzema scored. Nasri returned to the team in June for matches and, on 6 June, scored his first international goal in a 1\u20130 Euro qualifying win over Georgia. On 16 November 2007, Nasri scored his second international goal in a friendly match against Morocco. As a result of his performances, he was named in the 23-man squad to participate in Euro 2008. Nasri made his debut in the tournament on 9 June 2008 in the team's opening group stage match against Romania, appearing as a substitute. He did not appear in the team's 4\u20131 loss to the Netherlands, but did appear in the team's final group stage match against Italy. Nasri appeared as a substitute for the injured Franck Rib\u00e9ry in the tenth minute. Following defender's Eric Abidal's red card in the 24th minute, Nasri was taken out of the match in order for defender Jean-Alain Boumsong to take Abidal's spot in the lineup. In November 2008, Nasri was one of a group of young players who were accused of being insolent during the team's campaign at Euro 2008. The accusation came from domestic teammate William Gallas, who made the charge in his autobiography. Though not explicitly named in the book, Nasri was widely identified as the player in question. In 2010, after failing to make the 2010 World Cup squad, Nasri opened up about the situation, stating that during Gallas' final year at Arsenal, Nasri was one of \"four or five\" Arsenal players who did not speak to the defender. The feud culminated on 20 November 2010 when Nasri lived up to a pledge he would not shake the hand of Gallas, who was then playing for Tottenham Hotspur, during the pre-match build-up. Sweden defender at UEFA Euro 2012. In the 2008\u201309 season, Nasri appeared in only three matches with the national team. After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost a year and a half. During the 2009\u201310 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri returned to the national team under the reign of new coach Laurent Blanc for the team's friendly against Norway on 11 August 2010. He missed the September call-ups due to injury before returning to the team in October for Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Romania and Luxembourg. On 25 March 2011, Nasri captained the national team for the first time in its 2\u20130 Euro qualification win over Luxembourg. He provided the assist on the opening goal scored by Philippe Mex\u00e8s. In the team's final Euro qualifier against Bosnia and Herzegovina, Nasri scored the equalizing goal, converting a penalty in a 1\u20131 draw. The point gained from the stalemate secured a Euro 2012 qualifying spot for France. After appearing regularly in qualifying for Euro 2012, on 29 May 2012, Nasri was named to the squad to participate in the competition. In the team's opening group stage match against England, he scored the equalizing goal in a 1\u20131 draw. After France lost to Spain in the quarter-finals, Nasri subjected a reporter to what was described as a \"foul-mouthed tirade\" when asked for his views on the match. For that and other misdemeanours, the French Football Federation (FFF) imposed a three-match international ban. On 13 May 2014, France manager Didier Deschamps revealed his 23-man squad for the 2014 World Cup, omitting Nasri. On 9 August 2014, at age 27, Nasri confirmed his decision to retire from international football. == Style of play == Spartak Moscow. In his early years at Marseille, Nasri was deployed in several positions, most notably as a deep-lying midfielder and a wide midfielder primarily on the right side as he was deemed too small to play in the middle of the park. After two years of developing his physical traits, in the 2006\u201307 season, manager Albert Emon inserted Nasri into the playmaker role, where his vision, passing, technical skill and ability to read and understand the game suited him. Since that season, Nasri has been primarily deployed in the position or as a central attacking midfielder at both club and international level. The player has personally said that playing centrally is his preference. As a result of his versatility, Nasri can also function on the wing and spent the majority of his career at Arsenal occupying the role in the team's 4\u20133\u20133 formation. His close control with the ball, speed, dribbling, crossing, and ability to use both feet suits the position well, which has resulted in former manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger deploying Nasri in the role during the player's four-year stay at the club. Nasri often featured centrally for Arsenal in the absence of former club captain Cesc F\u00e0bregas. In 2009, in order to accommodate the arrival of Russian attacker Andrey Arshavin, it was recommended by both Wenger and then-France national team coach Raymond Domenech that Nasri revert to his role as a deep- lying midfielder so the player could showcase his underrated defensive abilities. Nasri is also an underrated direct free kick and penalty kick taker. The player had previously developed a superstition with regards to taking spot kicks, but conquered the issue after successfully converting two penalties in the team's League Cup victory over Tottenham Hotspur in 2010. Wenger describes Nasri as a \"young, quick and technically outstanding player\". He is described in a similar fashion by club scout Gilles Grimandi, who stated that Nasri is \"a fantastic athlete, he's quick, flexible and good with his feet\". Nasri's playing style, ability and cultural background have drawn comparisons to Zinedine Zidane. After joining Arsenal and excelling on the wing, the English media began comparing him to former club player and compatriot Robert Pires. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|National Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Marseille||2004\u201305||Ligue 1||24||1||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||25||1 |- |2005\u201306||Ligue 1||30||1||5||0||0||0||14||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||49||2 |- |2006\u201307||Ligue 1||37||3||6||0||1||0||6||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||50||3 |- |2007\u201308||Ligue 1||30||6||2||0||2||0||8||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||42||6 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total!!121!!11!!14!!0!!3!!0!!28!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!166!!12 |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Arsenal||2008\u201309||Premier League||29||6||5||0||0||0||10||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||44||7 |- |2009\u201310||Premier League||26||2||1||0||1||0||6||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||5 |- |2010\u201311||Premier League||30||10||4||1||4||2||8||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||46||15 |- |2011\u201312||Premier League||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total!!86!!18!!10!!1!!5!!2!!24!!6!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!125!!27 |- |rowspan=\"7\"|Manchester City|||2011\u201312||Premier League||31||5||1||0||4||1||10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||46||6 |- |2012\u201313||Premier League||27||2||3||1||0||0||6||1||1||1||37||5 |- |2013\u201314||Premier League||34||7||2||2||3||1||7||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||46||11 |- |2014\u201315||Premier League||24||2||1||0||1||0||6||1||1||0||33||3 |- |2015\u201316||Premier League||12||2||0||0||0||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||2 |- |2016\u201317||Premier League||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total!!129!!18!!7!!3!!8!!2!!30!!3!!2!!1!!176!!27 |- |Sevilla (loan)||2016\u201317||La Liga||23||2||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||30||3 |- |Antalyaspor||2017\u201318||S\u00fcper Lig||8||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||2 |- |West Ham United||2018\u201319||Premier League||5||0||1||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6||0 |- |Anderlecht||2019\u201320||Belgian First Division A||7||1||1||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||8||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total!!379!!52!!35!!5!!16!!4!!87!!11!!2!!1!!519!!73 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=7|France |2007||7||2 |- |2008||7||0 |- |2009||1||0 |- |2010||4||0 |- |2011||8||1 |- |2012||8||1 |- |2013||6||1 |- !colspan=2|Total||41||5 |} ===International goals=== :As of match played 15 November 2013.
