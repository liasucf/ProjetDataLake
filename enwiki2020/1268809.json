    "text": "Slow Motion is the eleventh and final studio album by the English rock band Supertramp, released in April 2002. ==Overview== In North America, Slow Motion was only available via mail-order from the band's website, released on their own label. The song \"Goldrush\" was actually written in the early 1970s under the first Supertramp line-up, and was used as the opening number in all their shows prior to Crime of the Century. The band had tried to record it on several previous occasions, but had never before been able to recreate it in the studio to their satisfaction. ==Reception== Allmusic wrote that the songs and blending of styles are brilliant, but that what would otherwise have been an outstanding album was spoiled by shoddy production. ==Track listing== All songs written by Rick Davies, except where noted. #\"Slow Motion\" \u2013 3:50 #\"Little By Little\" \u2013 4:30 #\"Broken Hearted\" \u2013 4:28 #\"Over You\" \u2013 5:06 #\"Tenth Avenue Breakdown\" \u2013 8:57 #\"A Sting in the Tail\" \u2013 5:17 #\"Bee in Your Bonnet\" \u2013 6:27 #\"Goldrush\" (Rick Davies, Richard Palmer-James) \u2013 3:06 #\"Dead Man's Blues\" \u2013 8:26 ==Personnel== *Rick Davies \u2013 harmonica, keyboards, vocals *Mark Hart \u2013 guitars, keyboards, vocals *John Helliwell \u2013 saxophone, woodwinds *Cliff Hugo \u2013 bass *Bob Siebenberg \u2013 drums *Lee Thornburg \u2013 horns, background vocals *Carl Verheyen \u2013 guitars *Jesse Siebenberg \u2013 percussion, background vocals ===Production=== *Producers: Rick Davies, Mark Hart, Jay Messina *Engineer: Jay Messina *Mastering: Greg Calbi *Pro-tools: Seth McClain *Photography: Jean Ber, Richard Frankel ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart (2002) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|Austrian Albums Chart |18 |- |align=\"left\"|Belgian Albums Chart (Wallonia) |31 |- |align=\"left\"|Dutch Albums Chart |83 |- |align=\"left\"|French SNEP Albums Chart |8 |- |align=\"left\"|German Media Control Albums Chart |17 |- |align=\"left\"|Spanish Albums Chart |34 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart |6 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !Chart (2002) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|French Albums Chart |118 |- |align=\"left\"|Swiss Albums Chart |88 |- |} ===Certifications and sales=== ==References== Category:Supertramp albums Category:2002 albums Category:Albums produced by Rick Davies Category:EMI Records albums ",
