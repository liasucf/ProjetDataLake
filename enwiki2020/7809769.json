    "text": "\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\" is a blues ballad, written and recorded by American blues and soul singer Percy Mayfield in 1950, for Art Rupe's Specialty Records. It was on the Billboard's R&B; chart for 27 weeks and reached the number-one position for two weeks; it was Mayfield's most successful song. ==Song background== It has been called a \"multilayered universal lament\". Mayfield sang it in a soft ballad style. Its appeal lay in the sensitivity of its lyrics in juxtaposing an awareness of a world in conflict with a personal expression of the need for love. Sung in Mayfield's gentle, suave vocal style, the lyrics were a combination of a romantic love ballad and a social message against discrimination. ==Track listing== US 7\"Vinyl # \"Please Send Me Someone to Love\" (2:50) # \"Strange Things Happening\" (2:49) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Chart (1950) ! scope=\"col\" | Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" | US Billboard Hot 100 | 26 |- ! scope=\"row\" | US Hot R&B; Sides (Billboard) | 1 |- |} ==Johnny Diesel and the Injectors version== In 1989, the Australian ARIA award-winning rock band Johnny Diesel and the Injectors recorded the song for the soundtrack of the film The Delinquents.
