    "text": "Ronald Wade Frenz (born February 1, 1960) is an American comics artist known for his work for Marvel Comics. He is well known for his 1980s work on The Amazing Spider-Man and later for his work on Spider-Girl whom he co-created with writer Tom DeFalco. Frenz and DeFalco had earlier co-created the New Warriors in the pages of Thor. ==Career== Frenz began working for Marvel Comics in the early 1980s. Frenz's early work includes such titles as Ka-Zar the Savage, Star Wars, The Further Adventures of Indiana Jones, and Marvel Saga. His first credited story for Marvel was published in Ka-Zar the Savage #16 (July 1982). Frenz has a history of working on comic book series in which the characters were not in their original costumes/identities. Spider-Man wore his black costume, Thor took on a new secret identity and look, and Superman changed costumes and powers while Frenz was the regular artist on their titles. Archive requires scrolldown. Frenz became the regular artist on The Amazing Spider-Man in 1984 and the stories he pencilled included \"The Kid Who Collects Spider-Man\" in issue #248 (Jan. 1984) and the first appearance of Spider-Man's black costume in issue #252 (May 1984).Manning \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 139: \"This particular tale was produced by plotter [Roger] Stern, scripter Tom DeFalco, breakdown artist Frenz, and finisher Brett Breeding.\" Among the new characters introduced during his run were the Puma in issue #256 (Sept. 1984)Manning \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 141: \"Another new character to spin out of the imagination of writer DeFalco and artist Frenz would debut in this issue when the Puma went on the prowl after Spider-Man.\" and Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985).Manning \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 148: \"In a story written by Tom DeFalco and penciled by Ron Frenz, readers met Silver Sable for the first time.\" Frenz and Tom DeFalco revealed that the \"black suit\" was an alien creature in issue #258 (Nov. 1984).Manning \"1980s\" in Gilbert (2012), p. 142 Frenz drew The Amazing Spider-Man Annual #18 (1984), a story written by Stan Lee, which featured the wedding of Spider-Man supporting characters J.

Jonah Jameson to Doctor Marla Madison.\" Frenz had originally been brought onto the series as a short-term substitute for John Romita Jr., but was retained when it became apparent that he meshed well with series writer DeFalco. Frenz recounted: Jim Owsley, editor of the Spider-Man titles at the time, has noted that \"Frenz was passionate about Spider-Man, verging on fanatical.\" In 1986, Frenz and DeFalco were removed from The Amazing Spider-Man by Owsley. Frenz and DeFalco became the creative team on Thor in 1987 and introduced the Eric Masterson character in Thor #391 (May 1988).
