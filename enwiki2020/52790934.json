(13 October 1734, SopronGrove article states only the country: Slovakia. \u2013 25 January 1825, Warsaw) was Polish classical composer of Slovak origin. He studied music in Sopronm, where his patron was Count Henckl von Donnersmarck. After his death (1760), Kamie\u0144ski moved to Vienna to continue his education. There in 1762, he heard young Mozart play. He visited Warsaw for the first time in 1773: this year the publishing house of J. Engel issued some harpsichord works by Kamie\u0144ski (today lost). He gave piano and singing lessons, held an inn in Warsaw (on \u015awi\u0119tojerska street) and organized public concerts at Dulfowski manor house. == Compositions == Kamie\u0144ski's output includes 8 operas (2 German, 6 Polish), which the composer himself called operettas. N\u0119dza uszcz\u0119\u015bliwiona (1778) was long considered the first Polish opera to be performed in public theatre. It opened a new era for Polish musical theatre. Kamie\u0144ski's musical language shows a mixture of styles, from baroque and galant to classical. There are also some characteristics of opera buffa. They all are present in N\u0119dza uszcz\u0119\u015bliwiona. After his successes, Kamie\u0144ski turned more and more towards folklore, using structures from authentic Polish folk music. It can be clearly seen in Zo\u015bka, czyli Wiejskie zaloty (1780), which had 76 performances in Warsaw up to 1820. Coloratura and espressivo arias combine with typical village songs and Polish dances, of which polonaise is the most popular. Kamie\u0144ski also composed Kr\u00f3tki rys o egzystencji najpierwszej oryginalnej opery polskiej (A Short Outline of the Original Polish Opera), published in Biblioteka Warszawska, iv (Warsaw, 1878). Besides operas, he composed some chamber works. His Duma na kszta\u0142t ronda (Duma in the form of a rondo) shows early Romantic tendencies. == List of works == ===Operas=== * N\u0119dza uszcz\u0119\u015bliwiona (Poverty made Happy), operetta, 2 acts, text by Wojciech Bogus\u0142awski after Franciszek Bohomolec; prem. 11 July 1778 (ed. in Opery polskie, ii; Krak\u00f3w, 1978) * Zo\u015bka, czyli Wiejskie zaloty (Sophia, or Country Courtship), operetta, 1 act, text by S.
