A 52-minute documentary features interviews with Egyptian soldiers detailing what they say are the inhumane conditions that conscripts are forced to work under, and it accuses the army of failing to train its troops properly and feeding them bad food. The documentary provokes outrage among Egyptian regime. Within two hours of the documentary's release on Sunday November 28, a spokesman for Egypt's Ministry of Foreign Affairs was denouncing it on Egyptian television. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously poorly done work that is trying to shake the confidence of the Egyptian citizen in his army,\u201d said the spokesman, Ahmed Abu Zeid. Mohamed Saleh, the head of the media office at Qatar's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, declined to respond to Mr. Abu Zeid's comments, saying, \u201cWe have nothing to do with this.\u201d. So far, \u201cThe Soldiers\u201d has been broadly received as an accurate portrayal of life for military conscripts in Egypt. Criticism of the military's training programs has been growing as a war against Islamic militants in the Sinai Peninsula drags into its fourth year, and tales of conscript abuse are common. * The Lurker (Almondass) (2014).
