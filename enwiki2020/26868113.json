    "text": "The 'Earlygold' mango (or, 'Early Gold') is an early-season mango cultivar that originated in Pine Island, Florida. == History == The original tree was grown on the grove of Frank Adams in Pine Island, Florida. For decades the parentage of the tree was unknown but a pedigree analysis indicated that Haden was the likely parent. Scions were sent to the Sub-Tropical Research Station near Miami, Florida, and a grafted tree was planted there in 1942. A distinctive characteristic of the tree is its early fruiting season, which begins in May. == Description == The fruit is oblong, averaging less than a pound in weight and having a small lateral beak. The flesh is dark yellow and fiberless, and is sweet and aromatic. Ripens from May to June. The tree is a moderately vigorous grower. == References == Category:Mango cultivars Category:Flora of Florida ",
