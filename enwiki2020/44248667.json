D\u00e9gh published 18 books and wrote over 200 articles and essays. She is well known for her work with legends and for applying the concept of ostention to the study of contemporary legends. In 1983, she and Andrew V\u00e1zsonyi wrote \"Does the Word 'Dog' Bite? Ostensive Action: A Means of Legend Telling\" and argue that legends can be acted out as well as told. Building on the semiotic work of Ivo Osolsob\u011b, Umberto Eco, Ludwig Wittgenstein and Bertrand Russell, they proposed five theoretically possible forms of ostention in folklore: ostention, pseudo-ostention, quasi- ostention, false ostention, and proto-ostention. ==Awards and honors== *1968: American Philosophy Fellowship *1970: Guggenheim Fellowship *1971: Fellow of the American Folklore Society *1984: Fulbright Research Fellowship in Germany *1989: American Folklore Society: Centennial Recognition Award *1990-91: National Humanities Center Fellowship *1991: Hoosier Folklore Society Achievement Award *1993: International Society for the Study of Contemporary Legend Outstanding Contribution Award *1993: Folklore Fellows of the Finnish Academy of Sciences, Helsinki, Finland *1995: Sigillo D'Oro, Pitr\u00e8-Salomone Marino Prize, Palermo, Italy *1995: Ortutay Medal - The Hungarian Ethnographic Society Budapest *2002: Chicago Folklore Prize from the American Folklore Society for Legend and Belief: Dialectics of a Folklore Genre *2003: Choice Outstanding Academic Book for Legend and Belief: Dialectics of a Folklore Genre *2004: Lifetime Scholarly Achievement Award from the American Folklore Society ==Works== * * * * * * * * * ==References== Category:1920 births Category:2014 deaths Category:Hungarian folklorists Category:Indiana University faculty Category:Writers from Budapest Category:P\u00e1zm\u00e1ny P\u00e9ter Catholic University alumni Category:Hungarian emigrants to the United States ",
