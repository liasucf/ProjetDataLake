    "text": "Midge Whiteman is an Australian former racing driver. Whiteman pioneered women's racing at Bathurst with Jane Richardson, being the first ever all- female team in 1967. They raced in a Morris 1100S in the 1967 Gallaher 500. They beat an all-male team in an identical car, and still remain one of two all-female team to ever finish the Bathurst 500 (now the Bathurst 1000). Whiteman was driving her finishing lap when she got a slipstream from the Geoghegan brothers down Conrod straight, sailing past the other Morris 1100S to come in just ahead of them, finishing 4th in their class. The second team to finish was in 1968 at the Hardie-Ferodo 500, with the team of Whiteman and Christine Cole finishing 5th in their class. Whiteman was a works driver for British Motor Corporation (BMC) throughout her racing career. == References == *https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1301&dat;=19670924&id;=Ef1jAAAAIBAJ&sjid;=JOcDAAAAIBAJ&pg;=1757,8698083&hl;=en/ref Category:Australian racing drivers Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
