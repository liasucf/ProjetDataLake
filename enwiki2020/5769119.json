    "text": "Sonnet 44 is one of 154 sonnets written by the English playwright and poet William Shakespeare. It is a member of the Fair Youth sequence, in which the poet expresses his love towards a young man. Sonnet 44 is continued in Sonnet 45. ==Structure== Sonnet 44 is an English or Shakespearean sonnet, which contains three quatrains followed by a final rhyming couplet. It follows the typical rhyme scheme of the form, ABAB CDCD EFEF GG, and is written in iambic pentameter, a type of poetic metre based on five pairs of metrically weak/strong syllabic positions. The fifth line exemplifies a regular iambic pentameter: \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / No matter then although my foot did stand (44.5) :/ = ictus, a metrically strong syllabic position. \u00d7 = nonictus. The sonnet is quite regular metrically (for example, a three-syllable \"injurious\" maintains regularity in line two), but implements a few variations, for example in the first and last lines: \u00d7 \u00d7 / / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / \u00d7 / If the dull substance of my flesh were thought, (44.1) \u00d7 / \u00d7 / / \u00d7 \u00d7 / \u00d7 / But heavy tears, badges of either's woe. (44.14) ...which contain, respectively, a rightward movement of the first ictus (resulting in a four-position figure, `\u00d7 \u00d7 / /`, sometimes referred to as a minor ionic), and a mid-line reversal (\"badges\"). ==Criticism== Critics have mentioned Sonnet 44 is directly coupled to Sonnet 45 and lacks a definite conclusion. ==Recordings== *Poeterra, for the 2014 album, When in Disgrace *Paul Kelly, for the 2016 album, Seven Sonnets & a Song ==References== ==Further reading== ==External links== *Analysis *Shakespeare Online Category:British poems Category:Sonnets by William Shakespeare ",
