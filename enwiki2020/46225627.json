The mixtape contains guest features by Andreya Triana, Baths, Earl Sweatshirt, Mapei, Niki Randa, Shabazz Palaces, Thundercat, The Underachievers and Viktor Vaughn; and a remix of Kanye West's song \"Black Skinhead\". ==Composition== The mixtape was characterized as psychedelic and hip hop, with August Brown of Los Angeles Times describing some songs as \"dinner jazz\", \"synth-velvety\" and \"hard core\". The mixtape mainly consists of unfinished \"scraps\" from his then-upcoming 2014 album You're Dead!. However, it also contains previously released material. The song \"About That Time\" was written for and featured in Cartoon Network series Adventure Time, as the closing theme for the episode \"A Glitch Is a Glitch\", titled as \"About That Time//A Glitch Is a Glitch\". The songs \"Aqua Teen 24\" and \"Chasing Apples\" are used the intro and outro theme respectively for Aqua TV Show Show, an alternative title for the tenth season of the Adult Swim series Aqua Teen Hunger Force. \"Colemans Groove\" is a version of a groove used by Hodgy in his song \"Lately\", and \"Between Villains\" was previously released as a part of Adult Swim Singles Program 2013. ==Release== The mixtape was released via Mediafire as a compliment for having reached 300 thousand followers on Twitter. However, it was taken down by request of Nintendo of America on October 23, 2015. It was also posted on DatPiff as 24 Song Zip File. ==Reception== Brown said that \"sonically, the package is all over the place\", but \"it's an interesting look behind the curtain\". Carl Acheson of SLUG stated that the mixtape is \"full of experiments and collaborations that show how flexible Flying Lotus is as an artist\" and that \"it is a psychedelic delve into the mind of an electronically inspired madman\". ==Track listing== All tracks produced by Flying Lotus; except \"Ideas\", which is co-produced by DJ Mehdi.
