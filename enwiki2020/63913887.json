    "text": "Hedbergia longiflora, formerly Bartsia longiflora, is a species of flowering plants in the family Orobanchaceae. It is an afromontane species, restricted to the mountains of northeastern Africa. A subspecies, Hedbergia longiflora subsp. macrophylla Hedberg, has also been described. == Phylogeny == The phylogeny of the genera of Rhinantheae has been explored using molecular characters. Hedbergia longiflora groups with Hedbergia decurva and Hedbergia abyssinica into a Hedbergia clade nested within the core Rhinantheae. These three taxa share evolutionary affinities with genera Tozzia, Bellardia, Neobartsia, Parentucellia, and Odontites. == References == Category:Hedbergia ",
