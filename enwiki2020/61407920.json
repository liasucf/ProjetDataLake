Its causes laid in the introduction of a new tax imposed only on the Hazaras. It began in November 1945, when Hazara Rebels under Ebr\u0101him Beg, also known as \"Ba\u010d\u010da-G\u0101w-saw\u0101r\" (Son of the cow rider) revolted against the local administration of Shahristan. After a siege lasting for about a week, the district, as well as arms and ammunitions, fell into the hands of the rebels. There are two different accounts as to how the rebellion ended: According to Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica, the Afghan government sent a force to pacify the region and subsequently withdrew the tax. According to Niamatullah Ibrahimi, it ended In spring 1946, when Mohammed Zahir Shah sent a delegation to the rebels, offering to lift the tax if the rebels laid down their arms, which was accepted. == References == Category:1945 in Afghanistan Category:Conflicts in 1945 Category:1946 in Afghanistan Category:Conflicts in 1946 Category:Military history of Afghanistan Category:Rebellions in Afghanistan ",
