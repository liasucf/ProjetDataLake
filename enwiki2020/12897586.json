The six-cylinder Menasco engines had the name Buccaneer, while the four-cylinder engines had the name Pirate. The Menasco engines came in both supercharged and normally aspirated models. The supercharged models, with the S suffix added to their designation, had superior performance at higher altitudes with a relatively small increase in dimensions and weight. ==Variants== ;Menasco A6 Buccaneer : ;Menasco B6 Buccaneer : ;Menasco B6S Buccaneer : ;Menasco C6 Buccaneer : ;Menasco C6S Super Buccaneer : ;Menasco D6 Super Buccaneer : ==Applications== * Alcor C-6-1 Junior * Bellanca 28-92 * Brown B-2 Racer * Brown B-3 * Chester Goon * Crosby CR-4 * Fokker S.IX/2 * Howard DGA-4 * Miles Mohawk * Miles Peregrine * Northrop Beta 3 * Northrop N-9M * PZL.26 * Rider R-6 * VEF I-14 * Waco Custom Cabin MGC-8 ==Specifications (Menasco B6S Buccaneer)== ==See also== ==References== * Engine Data Sheets * Category:Air-cooled aircraft piston engines Category:1930s aircraft piston engines Category:Inverted aircraft piston engines Category:Inline-six engines ",
