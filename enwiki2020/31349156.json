    "text": "GA\u00b2LEN, or Global Allergy and Asthma European Network, is a consortium of leading European research centres specialized in allergic diseases, which include asthma. Funded by the European Union under the 6th Framework Programme, GA\u00b2LEN addresses the growing public health concern of allergic diseases. Research teams were chosen for their scientific excellence, their record on multidisciplinary working and international collaboration, and their educational activities. Since the launch of the Network, it has grown to include an additional 50 collaborating centres making GA\u00b2LEN one of the largest multidisciplinary networks of researchers in allergy and asthma worldwide. == Integrating European research == Europe has produced some of the most important recent findings on allergy and asthma, but research tends to be fragmented in different institutes and even in different departments of the same organization. Findings are not always shared nor rapidly translated into changes in practice. The GA\u00b2LEN Network of Excellence (NoE) exists to help integrate research activities in Europe and to establish the structure for a European Research Area of excellence in allergy and asthma that will endure. == Spreading knowledge and excellence == The network aims to accelerate the application of research results into clinical practice, to meet the needs of patients, and to help guide policy development. It also aims to promote training and greater integration between public and private sectors in this medical field. By addressing allergy and asthma in their totality, GA\u00b2LEN's ultimate objective is to benefit the well-being of patients by decreasing the burden of allergic diseases in Europe. ==Personnel== * Professor Paul van Cauwenberge, University of Ghent, - GA\u00b2LEN Co-ordinator * Professor Torsten Zuberbier - GA\u00b2LEN Secretary General == GA\u00b2LEN Publications and Journals == * * == Media == \"The allergy epidemic: by 2015 half of us may be carrying one of these\" The Guardian, by Sarah Boseley, Health Editor ==External links == * www.ga2len.net Global Allergy and Asthma European Network * European Centre for Allergy Research Foundation - Partner of GA\u00b2LEN Category:Allergy organizations Category:European medical and health organizations ",
