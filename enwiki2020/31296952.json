    "text": "Gilles Roux (born January 20, 1971) is a French speedcuber primarily known for inventing a 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube method, the Roux Method, and achieving fast times with it. == WCA == Gilles was a member of the World Cube Association Board from October 2004 until November 1, 2008. During his time as a board member, Gilles helped organize many competitions as a WCA delegate. He also contributed to WCA by creating much needed regulations which would in turn help out cubers all over the world. Presently, Gilles is a technical advisor for the WCA and assists when needed.http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=9&t;=468 == Roux method == Over a span of years, Gilles developed his own method to solving the 3x3x3 cube. Using a smaller quantity of memorized algorithms than most methods of solving, Roux still found his method to be fast and efficient. The first step of the Roux method is to form a 3\u00d72\u00d71 block. The 3\u00d72\u00d71 block is usually placed in the lower portion of the left layer. The second step is to create another 3\u00d72\u00d71 on the opposite side. The remaining four corners are then solved using a set of algorithms known as CMLL (Corners of the Last Layer, without regards to the M-slice), which leaves six edges and four centers that are solved in the last step. == Official results == For official results, solves must be completed in a competition held by the WCA. In competition, Gilles has recorded a single solve of 10.06 seconds, ranking him just out the top one thousand solvers in the world (as of 01/01/15). His best average of 5 was set on 16 September 2011 at 13.03.http://www.worldcubeassociation.org/results/p.php?i=2004ROUX01 Also his greatest achieved fewest moves competition for the standard 3x3x3 is 31, being part of the \"31 club\", coming to a draw with another known cuber and creator of popular method of solving, Lars Petrus. ==See also== * Rubik's Cube * Speedcubing * Jessica Fridrich * Lars Petrus * World Cube Association == References == Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:French speedcubers ",
