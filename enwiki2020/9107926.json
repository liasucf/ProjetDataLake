Vanaja is a street smart LIC agent who has made it on her own. She lives with her only daughter Aswathy alias Achu who holds a diploma in Civil Engineering. Mother and daughter share a special relationship and are like friends. There is nothing that Achu hides from her mother. But the only thing taboo in their life is the talk about her father. Vanaja never speaks about Achu's father and Achu never asks her as she doesn't want to hurt her beloved mother. Their life moves smoothly until Immanuel John alias Ijo (Narain) enters their life. They meet Ijo accidentally when they go to Trivandrum for attending an interview. After the first meeting, Achu and Ijo run into each other now and then, and a friendship develops between them. Achu gets a job in a construction company. Ijo conveys his wish to marry Achu to Vanaja. Vanaja wants to meet his parents and then he reveals that he is an orphan, after when he takes them to a cemetery for getting permission for marriage. His family had committed mass suicide due to financial problems and he was the only one who survived. Now Vanaja turns against the marriage saying she wants her daughter to marry into a solid family where there are many people who care for each other. This shocks Achu and she raises the taboo and questions Vanaja about her father. Mother and daughter have an argument; Vanaja does not reveal anything and Achu walks out of her home. She goes to Ijo but he asks her to go back home. Achu is adamant and she stays with her colleague. Ijo tries to mend the relationship between them but Achu takes no heed. Meanwhile, Achu, due to uncomfortable circumstances, has to leave her colleagues place and she finds that she has no place to stay. She is totally worked up and meets with an accident and then Vanaja rushes to see her in hospital. Achu still doesn't speak to her and Vanaja opens her mind to Ijo, and tells him about her past. She reveals that Achu is not her daughter and since from a young age she had adopted Achu, giving a name Aswathy and calls Achu, she did not marry. Ijo tells this to Achu, and both of them reconcile. The end shows Vanaja adopting another little girl just like how she had taken Achu. == Cast == * Urvashi as Vanaja, a LIC agent * Meera Jasmine as Aswathy / Achu * Narain as Immanuel John / Ijo (voice dubbed by Sarath Das) * Innocent as Paulose * K.
