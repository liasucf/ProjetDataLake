    "text": "Wilhelm Peterson-Berger Olof Wilhelm Peterson-Berger (; 27 February 1867, Ull\u00e5nger, \u00c5ngermanland - 3 December 1942, \u00d6stersund) was a Swedish composer and music critic. As a composer, his main musical influences were Grieg, August S\u00f6derman and Wagner as well as Swedish folk idiom.Percy G. Wilhelm Peterson-Berger, An Introduction. (Stockholm, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger Society) 1982. ==The composer== Peterson-Berger studied at the Stockholm Conservatory from 1886\u201389 and then in Dresden for a year.Haglund R. \"Peterson-Berger\" in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera ed Sadie S. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He is best known for three albums of national romantic piano pieces entitled Fr\u00f6s\u00f6blomster I, II and III (Flowers of Fr\u00f6s\u00f6), which includes the often performed Vid Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 kyrka (At Fr\u00f6s\u00f6 Church) and Sommars\u00e5ng (Summer Song). The sets, which were composed over a period of 18 years (1896 - 1914) and brought together afterwards as a collection have gained a reputation of representing a quintessential \"Swedishness\" in the romantic, nationalistic vein of their time. The most famous of the pieces, Sommars\u00e5ng (Summer Song) recalls the warm, calm, harmonious and bright pre-summer evenings where the sun in the north almost never goes down; they were the great breakthrough for Wilhelm. Sommars\u00e5ng is still known to most Swedes, even to people generally uninterested in music: the majority of young piano students in the Nordic countries have been taught this piece. His songs for vocal ensemble are also still regularly performed, and are part of the core repertoire of Swedish choirs. His other works include the five symphonies - among them are no.2 Sunnanf\u00e4rd and no.3 Same-\u00c4tnam generally considered the best - as well as the operas Ran, Arnljot, Domedagsprofeterna (\"The Doomsday Prophets\") and Adils och Elisiv (\"Adils and Elisiv\"). His command of the larger forms, in both architecture and instrumentation, is disputed. He was stage manager at the Stockholm Opera from 1908-10. The opera Arnljot has nevertheless become something of a symbol for the province of J\u00e4mtland and is regularly performed there, as a \"musical drama\", at Arnljotl\u00e4gden on Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n, close to Peterson- Berger's former home, Sommarhagen. Domedagsprofeterna is the antithesis of Arnljot \u2013 a light festive musical comedy set in 17th century Uppsala, while the saga Adils och Elisiv where Swedish \u2018tals\u00e5ng\u2019 (speechsong) attained its purest expression is a work extolling Peterson-Berger's belief in humanism and the goodness of man. He also wrote about eighty songs, many of which set poems by Erik Axel Karlfeldt, for example Asp\u00e5kerspolska. ==Work list (partial)== ===Orchestral=== *Symphony No.1 in B flat major, Baneret (\"The Banner\"), 1889-1903, revised 1932-1933 Movements: \"N\u00e4r vi f\u00f6rst drogo ut\", \"Mellan fedjerna\", \"Vid hj\u00e4lteb\u00e5ren\", \"Mot nya v\u00e5rar\" *Symphony No.2 in E flat major, Sunnanf\u00e4rd (\"The Journey of Southerly Winds\"), 1910 Movements: \"Stiltje - Seglats\", \"Rosenstaden: Dionysost\u00e5get - I Eros tempel - Symposion\", \"Heml\u00e4ngtan - F\u00f6r sunnanvind\" *Symphony No.3 in F minor, Same \u00c4tnam (\"Lappland Symphony\"), 1913-1915 Movements: \"Forntidsbilder\", \"Vinterkv\u00e4ll\", \"Sommarnatt\", \"Framtidsdr\u00f6mmar\" *Symphony No.4 in A major, Holmia (\"Stockholm\"), 1929 *Symphony No.5 in B major, Solitudo (\"Solitude\"), 1932-1933 *Orientalisk Dans (\"Oriental Dance\"), 1889-1890 *Violin concerto in F sharp minor, 1915-1928 *Romance in D minor for violin and orchestra, 1915 *T\u00f6rnrosasagan (\"The Story of the Sleeping Beauty\"), 1934 *Symphony No.6, Hellas (\"Greece\"), 1935-1938 - unfinished ===Opera=== *Ran, 1899-1900 * Lyckan ('The Happiness'), 1903 *Arnljot, 1907-1909 *Domedagsprofeterna ('The Doomsday Prophets'), 1912-1917 *Adils and Elisiv, 1921-1924 ===Vocal=== *Sveagaldrar, cantata, 1897 *Part songs/music for choir: Tio s\u00e5nger f\u00f6r blandad k\u00f6r; Album, 8 s\u00e5nger f\u00f6r blandad k\u00f6r (including his settings of J.

Peterson-Berger in The New Grove Dictionary of Opera ed Sadie S. Macmillan, London and New York, 1997. He was conservative and fought the increasing influence of modernism in music, especially from Arnold Schoenberg and his followers. His progress was hindered by many enemies whom he made through his writings; he attacked showy virtuosity and dry academicism with satire but also with strict conscientiousness. For either composers or performers who did not conform to his taste (or who were young and insecure female musicians, to take one typical example), he was not above grave personal insults. Other writings include \u2018Svensk musikkultur\u2019 (Swedish musical culture, 1911) which includes clearsighted and satirical attacks on the prevailing musical establishment, \u2018Richard Wagner som kulturf\u00f6reteelse\u2019 (Richard Wagner as a cultural phenomenon, 1913) as well as translations of Tristan und Isolde (for a 1909 production in Stockholm), and Friedrich Nietzsche\u2019s The Birth of Tragedy (1902) and Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1919).Percy G. Wilhelm Peterson- Berger, An Introduction. Stockholm, Wilhelm Peterson-Berger Society, 1982. ==The man== One acquaintance later recalled his surprise when, on a journey by train from Stockholm to \u00d6stersund and Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n, the big man and notorious critic suddenly burst into tears and felt soft like a child as the bucolic landscape of his beloved J\u00e4mtland began to unfold outside the window. Even this writer, however, noted that even Peterson-Berger's threatening and miserable physical appearance and demeanour conformed to the stereotype of the dour Scandinavian. His home on the island of Fr\u00f6s\u00f6n near \u00d6stersund (where he spent his summers from 1914 and then lived permanently from 1930) is open to the public in the summer months and is much as the composer left it. The downstairs music hall has his grand piano (he was a competent pianist), a work room (with a \u2018picture window\u2019 looking out over Storsj\u00f6n) and library (with his collection of books and scores), while upstairs the bedrooms may be viewed. He lived alone there with a butler and his cats. There is also a small caf\u00e9 where books and CDs are sold. ==References== Nationalencyklopedin, band 15 (1994) (Swedish National Encyclopedia, in Swedish) Percy G.
