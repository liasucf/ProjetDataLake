Together with the Kourou Carnival and the Saint-Laurent Carnival, it is one of the most important carnivals in the region. This carnival is also known for its parade, the Parade of Cayenne (also called Parade of the Capital), where participate groups invited from Metropolitan France, Suriname, Brazil and Caribbean. == History of the carnival of Cayenne == This festival belongs to the Guianan Creole culture. It originates from the carnival as it is practiced in Europe. At the beginning of colonization, the settlers practiced carnival, but slaves were forbidden. Braving the ban, the slaves practiced the carnival, in clandestine celebrations. They saw it as a way to regain some freedom, to commemorate fertility and harvests like Africans, and to mock the settlers. Today the metropolitan, Brazilian and Chinese communities take part.Le carnaval guyanais ou l\u2019entretien symbolique de fronti\u00e8res \u00ab ethniques \u00bb sur Manioc It has a variable duration fixed by the religious festivals, it takes place between the Epiphany at the beginning of January, and the Ash Wednesday marking the beginning of Lent calculated according to the date of Easter in February or March.

Throughout the carnival, families gather to eat the galette des rois. This is the tradition of the slab of kings known in Europe during the Epiphany, extended throughout the carnival period. Usually, the king pays the cake the following week. The cake can be frangipane, guava or coco. After the Abolition of slavery in 1848, the economy of Guyana is stricken, a large number of the population lives from the work of the land in \"houses\".

The Dancings, called \"Universities\" organize masked balls during which the men come to dance with the touloulous. Evenings are held on Friday and Saturday nights depending on the municipality. This tradition is peculiar to French Guiana, it exists nowhere else, but there are now dancings on Paris and some cities of France which organize its balls. The Tololos Ball is a recent innovation that has only appeared since the 1990s. During these evenings, the men disguise themselves and take on the role of Touloulous (they invite undisguised women to dance). These evenings are becoming increasingly popular and take place several times during carnival, the most important being the last Friday before the fat days. The carnival dances are the mazurka, the polka, the biguine and the pik\u00e9 djouk. It is the Touloulou which invites the men to dance, they can not refuse.Les bals masqu\u00e9s et leurs danses Only the Touloulous have the right to dance, if an undisguised woman dances, the orchestra stops.

These videos always take place in the early hours of Sunday after Saturday night's par- masked ball and aim to train all the dancers outside, in the street, so that all these revelers end up going home. them. Initially, there was also always a Vide after the last group of Sunday's street carnival in the early evening. A crowd of young and old followed a truck on which was installed an orchestra that played the rhythms of the carnival. Unfortunately, some of the videos resulted in violence between gangs of young people from different neighborhoods that had serious consequences. Also, these videos have been banned for a long time.
