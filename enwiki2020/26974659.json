    "text": "Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building is one of seven Stalinist skyscrapers laid down in September 1947 and completed in 1952, designed by Dmitry Chechulin (then Chief Architect of Moscow) and Andrei Rostkovsky. The main tower has 32 levels (including mechanical floors) and is tall. At the time of construction it was the tallest building in Europe. The building also incorporates a 9-story apartment block facing Moskva River, designed by the same architects in 1938 and completed in 1940. Initially built in stern early Stalinist style, with wet stucco wall finishes, it was re-finished in terracotta panels in line with the central tower and acquired ornate pseudo-Gothic crowns over its 12-story raised corners and center tower. By the end of World War II, the side wing was converted to multi-family kommunalka housing, in contrast to the planned elite status of the central tower. The central tower, of a conventional steel frame structural type, has a hexagonal cross-section with three side wings (18 stories, including two mechanical floors). While it is not exceptionally tall or massive, the \"upward surge\" of five stepped-up layers, from a flat 9-story side wing to the spire, gives the impression of a more massive structure. The structure hides behind itself a so-called \"Shvivaya Gorka,\" a hill with historical architecture and a maze of steeply inclined streets. Chechulin was initially criticized for complete disregard of this area, but his bureaucratic influence brushed off any criticisms. ==Notable residents == Notable residents of the building include(d): * Vasily Aksyonov * Yuri Lyubimov * Konstantin Paustovsky * Faina Ranevskaya * Willi Tokarev * Galina Ulanova * Andrey Voznesensky * Yevgeny Yevtushenko * Lyudmila Zykina ==Notes== ==External links== * Building data at emporis.com * History of Moscow Skyscrapers * video from top of building Category:Office buildings completed in 1940 Category:Residential buildings completed in 1952 Category:Stalinist architecture Category:Seven Sisters (Moscow) Category:Residential skyscrapers in Moscow Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Moscow ",
