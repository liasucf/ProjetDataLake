    "text": "The Friendship Match () is a term used by media and both football clubs for games between Polish football clubs Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw. While there have been longer \"friendships\" () in Polish football, such as Polonia Warsaw and Cracovia having relations since the 1920s and officially since the 1960s, their decision to end their friendship agreement in 2017 meant that the agreement between Lechia and \u015al\u0105sk became the longest current friendship in Polish football. The Friendship has officially been in place since 1977, with the friendship linking back to 1976. The friendship came into fruition in 1976 after \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw fans traveled to northern Poland to watch \u015al\u0105sk play against Gwardia Koszalin, a team who has strong links with Arka Gdynia, the main rival of Lechia Gda\u0144sk. During meetings between the two clubs there is no segregation between fans, as in normal football matches, with both sets of fans often being involved with displays of banners and tifo. ==Teams== ===Lechia Gda\u0144sk=== Founded in 1945 in Gda\u0144sk after the expulsion of Poles in Lviv. Throughout their history they have mostly played in the top three tiers. The club had to restart in the lowest divisions after the club created a new club independent club a few years after the Lechia-Polonia Gda\u0144sk merger in 2001. The team have been playing in the Ekstraklasa since 2008. The club have currently won the Polish Cup and the Polish SuperCup twice, winning both cups in 1983 and 2019. The team's highest position in the Ekstraklasa is third which it achieved in 1956 and 2019. ===\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw=== Founded in 1947 in Wroc\u0142aw, \u015al\u0105sk have been the more successful of the two teams, playing mostly in the top division since the 1960s. \u015al\u0105sk last won promotion to the Ekstraklasa in 2008 and have been in the league since. \u015al\u0105sk have won the Polish championship twice in 1977 and 2012, and finishing in either second or third a further six times. They have won the Polish Cup twice, the Polish SuperCup twice, and the Ekstraklasa Cup once. ==Three Kings of Great Cities== \u015al\u0105sk fans in 2003. The \"Trzej Kr\u00f3lowie Wielkich Miast\" banner can be seen on the right The Three Kings of Great Cities alliance () was created in 1994 when Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w formed an agreement with \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw. Lechia and Wis\u0142a already had an agreement which dated back to 1973, with the two teams splitting from that agreement at least once. The friendship between the three teams was created to combat the large \"The Great Triad\" (), the alliance between Arka Gdynia, Cracovia and Lech Pozna\u0144. The alliance ended in 2016 with Wis\u0142a Krak\u00f3w intending to form a friendship with Ruch Chorz\u00f3w. This upset both Lechia and \u015al\u0105sk fans as fans of Ruch Chorz\u00f3w and Widzew \u0141\u00f3d\u017a were involved in the murder of a \u015al\u0105sk fan in 2003. The main Lechia Gda\u0144sk fan group posted that the decision for Wis\u0142a to form a friendship with Ruch was unacceptable for the fans of Lechia, and that the friendship was to be terminated. The main \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw fan group posted a similar response the following day officially ending the TKWM alliance. ==Players & Managers== ===Players=== There have been a few players who have played for both Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw, with the majority of those playing for both clubs after the agreement which was made in 1977. *Boles\u0142aw B\u0142aszczyk \u2013 Lechia (1980\u201382) & \u015al\u0105sk (1985) *Tomasz Borowiec \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (1999) *Piotr Bubi\u0142ek \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (2001) *Micha\u0142 Chrapek \u2013 Lechia (2015\u201317) & \u015al\u0105sk (2017\u201320) *Marcin Cili\u0144ski \u2013 Lechia (1995\u201396) & \u015al\u0105sk (1997\u201398) *Jan Erlich \u2013 Lechia (1978\u201381) & \u015al\u0105sk (1974\u201378) *Piotr Jacyna \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (1995) *Marcin Janus \u2013 Lechia (1995, 2005\u201306) & \u015al\u0105sk (1999\u201301) *Jerzy Kasalik \u2013 Lechia (1975\u201376) & \u015al\u0105sk (1969\u201370) *Jakub Kosecki \u2013 Lechia (2011\u201312) & \u015al\u0105sk (2017\u201318) *Aleksandar Kova\u010devi\u0107 \u2013 Lechia (2015\u201317) & \u015al\u0105sk (2017) *Kamil Kowalczyk \u2013 Lechia (1995\u201396, 1996) & \u015al\u0105sk (1994) *Maciej Kowalczyk \u2013 Lechia (2008\u201309) & \u015al\u0105sk (2000\u201301) *Grzegorz Krysiak \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (1999) *Mateusz Lewandowski \u2013 Lechia (2017\u201319) & \u015al\u0105sk (2017, 2018) *Mateusz Machaj \u2013 Lechia (2011\u201313) & \u015al\u0105sk (2014\u201316) *Micha\u0142 Mak \u2013 Lechia (2015\u201319) & \u015al\u0105sk (2017\u201318) *Sebastian Mila \u2013 Lechia (1997\u201398, 1998\u201301, 2015\u201318) & \u015al\u0105sk (2008\u201315) *Tomasz Moskal \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (1994\u201397) *Fl\u00e1vio Paix\u00e3o \u2013 Lechia (2016\u2013present) & \u015al\u0105sk (2014\u201316) *Marco Paix\u00e3o \u2013 Lechia (2016\u201318) & \u015al\u0105sk (2013\u201315) *Jacek Paszulewic \u2013 Lechia (1998) & \u015al\u0105sk (2001) *Bart\u0142omiej Paw\u0142owski \u2013 Lechia (2014\u201317) & \u015al\u0105sk (2020\u2013present) *Wojciech Paw\u0142owski \u2013 Lechia (2010\u201312) & \u015al\u0105sk (2014\u201315) *Miros\u0142aw P\u0119kala \u2013 Lechia (1985\u201388) & \u015al\u0105sk (1977\u201384) *Krzysztof Rusinek \u2013 Lechia (1998, 1998\u201301, 2004\u201306) & \u015al\u0105sk (2007) *Krzysztof Sadzawicki \u2013 Lechia (1995\u201396) & \u015al\u0105sk (1999\u201301) *Grzegorz Szamotulski \u2013 Lechia (1993) & \u015al\u0105sk (2001) *Adam Tokarz \u2013 Lechia (1973\u201374) & \u015al\u0105sk (1967\u201369) *Tomasz Unton \u2013 Lechia (1988\u201394, 1995\u201396) & \u015al\u0105sk (1997) *Dariusz Wojciechowski \u2013 Lechia (2001) & \u015al\u0105sk (1996\u201397) *\u0141ukasz Zwoli\u0144ski \u2013 Lechia (2020\u2013present) & \u015al\u0105sk (2016\u201317) *Dzidos\u0142aw \u017buberek \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (1998\u201399) Notes ===Managers=== Currently there have been three managers who have managed both Lechia Gda\u0144sk and \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw. *Zygmunt Czy\u017cewski \u2013 Lechia (1945\u201346) & \u015al\u0105sk (1960\u201361) *Wojciech \u0141azarek \u2013 Lechia (1974\u201375, 1985\u201386) & \u015al\u0105sk (1998\u201399) *Romuald Szukie\u0142owicz \u2013 Lechia (2000) & \u015al\u0105sk (1989\u201391, 1995\u201396, 2015\u201316) Notes == See also == * Football in Poland * Lechia Gda\u0144sk * \u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw * Football hooliganism in Poland * List of derbies in Poland == References == Category:Sport in Gda\u0144sk Category:Sport in Wroc\u0142aw Category:Lechia Gda\u0144sk Category:\u015al\u0105sk Wroc\u0142aw ",
