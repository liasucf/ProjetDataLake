    "text": "Greta B\u00f6sel (n\u00e9e Mueller) (9 May 1908 \u2013 3 May 1947) was a trained nurse. Born in Wuppertal-Elberfeld, Germany, she became a camp guard at Ravensbr\u00fcck in August 1944. Her rank at the camp was Arbeitseinsatzf\u00fchrerin (Work Input Overseer). In November 1944, B\u00f6sel was supposed to have been one of the staff members to select prisoners for the gas chamber, or for transfer to Uckermark. She is known to have told another SS guard \"If they [prisoners] cannot work, let them rot.\" After the death march of prisoners out of Ravensbr\u00fcck following the impending liberation by the Red Army of Soviet troops, B\u00f6sel fled the camp with her husband. She was later caught and arrested by British troops. B\u00f6sel, along with other female guards including Dorothea Binz, stood accused at the first Ravensbr\u00fcck Trial, which took place between December 1946 and February 1947 in Hamburg, Germany. The court found her guilty of maltreatment, murder and taking part in the \"selections\". She was executed for her crimes at 9:55 am on 3 May 1947, 24 minutes after Elisabeth Marschall, by Albert Pierrepoint in Hameln prison. ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1947 deaths Category:Executed German women Category:German nurses Category:Hamburg Ravensbr\u00fcck trials executions Category:Executed people from North Rhine- Westphalia Category:People from Wuppertal Category:People from the Rhine Province Category:Female guards in Nazi concentration camps ",
