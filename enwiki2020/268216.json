    "text": "Fuchsia () is a genus of flowering plants that consists mostly of shrubs or small trees. The first to be scientifically classified, Fuchsia triphylla, was discovered on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The genus Fuchsia was discovered during the years 1696\u20131697 by the French Minim monk and botanist, Charles Plumier, during his third expedition to the Greater Antilles. He named the new genus after German botanist Leonhart Fuchs (1501\u20131566).Charles Plumier. Nova Plantarum Americanum Genera, Paris, 1703. ==Taxonomy== Scientifically, fuchsias are most closely related to the northern hemisphere genus Circaea. It is hypothesized that the two lineages diverged around 41 million years ago. == Description == Fuchsia sp. in Japan Almost 110 species of Fuchsia are recognized. The vast majority of fuchsia species are native to South America, but a few occur north through Central America to Mexico. Several species can also be found from New Zealand to Tahiti. One species, F. magellanica, extends as far as the southern tip of South America, but the majority are tropical or subtropical. Most fuchsias are shrubs from tall. One New Zealand species, the k\u014dtukutuku (F. excorticata), is classified as a tree that grows up to tall. Fuchsia leaves are found in whorls of three to five and usually have serrated margins. They range from 1\u201325 cm long, and can be either deciduous or evergreen, depending on the species. The flowers are very decorative; they have a pendulous teardrop shape and are displayed in profusion throughout the summer and autumn. The flowers are displayed all year in tropical species. They have four long, slender sepals and four shorter, broader petals. In many species, the sepals are bright red and the petals purple. Fuchsia colors can vary from white to dark red, purple- blue, and orange. Some have yellowish tones. The ovary is inferior and the fruit is a small (5\u201325 mm) dark reddish green, deep red, or deep purple berry. Fuchsias are known to contain numerous small seeds. The fruit of the berry of F. splendens is reportedly among the best-tasting. Its flavor is reminiscent of citrus and black pepper, and it can be made into jam. The fruits of some other fuchsias are flavorless or leave a bad aftertaste. == Species == Fuchsia hybrida The majority of Fuchsia species are native to Central and South America. A small additional number are found on Hispaniola (two species), in New Zealand (three species) and on Tahiti (one species). According to A Revision of the Genus Fuchsia, Philip A. Munz classified the genus into seven sections of 100 species. More recent scientific publications recognize 108 species and 122 taxa, organized into 12 sections. In New Zealand and Tahiti, section Skinnera now consists of only three species as F. \u00d7 colensoi has been determined to be a naturally occurring hybrid between F. excorticata and F. perscandens. Also, F. procumbens has been placed into its own section, Procumbentes. Two other new sections are Pachyrrhiza and Verrucosa, each with one species. The Plant List, a cooperative endeavor by several leading botanical institutions to maintain a working list of all plant species, lists most currently accepted Fuchsia species and synonyms. The vast majority of garden hybrids have descended from a few parent species. === Ellobium === Mexico and Costa Rica. This section contains three species. * Fuchsia decidua * Fuchsia fulgens * Fuchsia splendens ** F. splendens var. splendens ** F. splendens var. cordifolia === Encliandra === Mexico to Panama.

The British Fuchsia Society maintains a list of hardy fuchsias that have been proven to survive a number of winters throughout Britain. Enthusiasts report that hundreds, even thousands of hybrids survive and prosper throughout Britain. In the United States, the Northwest Fuchsia Society maintains an extensive list of fuchsias that have proven hardy in members' gardens. Fuchsias from sections Quelusia (F. magellanica, F. regia), Encliandra, Skinnera (F. excorticata, F. perscandens) and Procumbentes (F. procumbens) have especially proven to be hardy in widespread areas of Britain and Ireland, as well as in many other countries such as New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A number of species will easily survive outdoors in mild temperate areas. During the average British summer, some fuchsias will not flower. However, they often perform well in other favorable climatic zones. Even in somewhat colder regions, a number of the hardier species will often survive as herbaceous perennials, dying back and reshooting from below ground in the spring. Due to the temperate climate created by the North Atlantic current, fuchsias grow abundantly in the West Kerry region of Ireland. They also populate the Isles of Scilly. While F. magellanica is not widespread in Scotland, it has been known to grow wild in sheltered areas. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, F. magellanica easily survives regional winters. === Categories === Horticultural fuchsias may be categorized as upright and bushy, or trailing. Some can be manipulated into hedges, such as F. magellanica. Faster-growing varieties are easiest to manipulate. Care should be taken to choose the hardier cultivars for permanent plantings in the garden. Many popular upright Fuchsias such as 'Ernie', 'Jollies Nantes' and 'Maria Landy' are extremely tender (hardiness zone 10). == Cultivars == 'Alice Hoffman' In the UK, 60 cultivated varieties of fuchsia have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, including:- * 'Alice Hoffman' (pink sepals, white petals \u2013 hardy) * 'Display' (deep pink/rose pink single) * 'Dollar Prinzessin' (cerise sepals, purple petals \u2013 hardy) * 'Garden News' (light pink sepals, double magenta petals \u2013 hardy) * 'Genii' (single, cerise/purple) * 'Hawkshead' (white self) * 'Lady Thumb' (compact, pink sepals, white petals) * 'Mrs Popple' (vigorous, red sepals, purple petals \u2013 hardy) * 'Riccartonii' (crimson sepals, purple petals) *'Snowcap' (scarlet sepals, white double petals) * 'Swingtime' (double, scarlet sepals, white petals) * 'Thalia' (tryphilla group, orange) * 'Tom Thumb' (compact, pink sepals, mauve petals) == Pests and diseases == Fuchsia with blossom opened Fuchsias are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila elpenor) and the black-lyre leafroller moth (\"Cnephasia\" jactatana). Other major insect pests include aphids, mirid bugs such as Lygocoris, Lygus and Plesiocoris spp., vine weevils (Otiorhynchus spp.), and greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum). Problematic mites include the fuchsia gall mite (Aculops fuchsiae) and red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae). == Pronunciation and spelling == While the original pronunciation from the word's German origin is \"fook-sya\" , the standard pronunciation for the common name in English is \"fyu-sha\" . As a consequence, fuchsia is often misspelled as ' in English. When pronounced as scientific Latin name, the pronunciation would be \"fook- see-a\", if one applies the rule that the root word in honorific Latin names should follow as much as possible the original pronunciation of the name of the person the plant is named for, plus the standard pronunciation of the Latin suffix. In practice, however, English-speaking botanists often pronounce it the same as the common name, \"fyu-sha\". == History == Leonhart Fuchs (1501\u20131566) Leonhart Fuchs, the namesake of the genus, was born in 1501. Fuchs was born in Wemding in the Duchy of Bavaria. He occupied the chair of Medicine at the University of T\u00fcbingen as a physician and professor. Fuchs occupied this role from his appointment at the age of 34 until his death in 1566. Aside from his interest in medicine, Fuchs enjoyed studying plants. During the 1500s, most remedies and medicines were herbal. In 1542, Fuchs wrote and published the seminal De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes. His work was praised for its rich illustrations. Along with Otto Brunfels (1489\u20131534) and Hieronymus Bock (1498\u20131554), Leonhart Fuchs is considered one of the three fathers of botany. In honour of Fuchs' work, the fuchsia received its name in the year 1702. Charles Plumier was responsible for naming the fuchsia. Plumier compiled his Nova Plantarum Americanum,nbased on the results of his third plant-finding trip to the Caribbean in search of new genera. Plumier published his research in Paris in 1703. Plumier's novel species was accepted by Carolus Linnaeus in 1753. The first fuchsia species were introduced into English gardens and glasshouses at the end of the 18th century. Fuchsia coccinea Aiton arrived at Kew Gardens in 1788. It was formally described in the year 1789. Fuchsia coccinea was apparently shortly followed by Fuchsia magellanica Lam. There is much early confusion between these two similar-looking species in the Quelusia Section as they seem to have hybridized readily as well. Fuchsia magellanica proved very hardy outdoors and its cultivars soon naturalized in favorable areas of the British Isles. Other species were quickly introduced to greenhouses.Fuchsia fulgens Mo\u00e7. & Sess\u00e9 ex DC was introduced in the 1830s. It resulted in an outpouring of new cultivars when crossed with the existing species. Philip Munz, in his A Revision of the Genus Fuchsia (1943), repeats the story that the fuchsia was first introduced into England by a sailor who grew it in a window. According to the story, it was observed by a nurseryman from Hammersmith, a Mr. Lee, who succeeded in buying it and propagating it for the trade. This was supposedly either one of the short-tubed species such as Fuchsia magellanica or Fuchsia coccinea. The story given by Munz first appears in the 1850s and is embellished in various early publications. Captain Firth, a sailor, brought the plant back to England from one of his trips to his home in Hammersmith where he gave it to his wife. Later James Lee of St. Johns Wood, nurseryman and an astute businessman, heard of the plant and purchased it for \u00a380. He then propagated as many as possible and sold them to the trade for prices ranging from \u00a310 to \u00a320 each. In the Floricultural Cabinet, 1855, there is a report which varies slightly from the above. There it is stated that F. coccinea was given to Kew Garden in 1788 by Captain Firth and that Lee acquired it from Kew. Other than a citation that Fuchsia coccinea was indeed given to Kew Garden by a Captain Firth, there is no firm evidence to support any of these claims. Throughout the nineteenth century, plant-collecting fever spread throughout Europe and the United States. Many species of numerous genera were introduced. Some plants were introduced as living plants, while others were introduced as seed. The following fuchsias were recorded in England at Kew: F. lycioides, 1796; F. arborescens, 1824; F. microphylla, 1827; F. fulgens, 1830; F. corymbiflora, 1840; and F. apetala, F. decussata, F. dependens and F. serratifolia in 1843 and 1844, the last four species attributable to Messrs. Veitch of Exeter. With the increasing numbers of differing species in England, plant breeders began to immediately develop hybrids to develop more desirable garden plants. The first recorded experiments date to 1825 as F. arborescens \u03a7 F. macrostemma and F. arborescens X F. coccinea where the quality of the resultant plants was unrecorded. Between 1835 and 1850 there was a tremendous influx to England of both hybrids and varieties, the majority of which have been lost. In 1848 Felix Porcher published the second edition of his book Le Fuchsia son Histoire et sa Culture. This described 520 species. In 1871, James Lye became famous breeding fuchsias in England. In 1883, the first book of English fuchsias was published. Between 1900 and 1914, many famous varieties of fuchsias were grown extensively for Covent Garden. During the period between the first and second world wars, fuchsia-growing slowed as efforts were made toward crop production. After 1949, when plant and hybrid production resumed on a large scale. Sidney Mitchell, a member of the newly formed American Fuchsia Society, shipped a large collection of fuchsias back to California in 1930. A thorough census and collection of fuchsias already growing in California had been undertaken under the scientific leadership of Alice Eastwood. The census yielded ninety-one existing cultivars. Armed with that list, Mitchell acquired fifty-one new fuchsias. Forty-eight of his plants survived the long trip. The surviving plants were doled out to members of the society and local businesses. Half of the plants were cultivated at the University of California Botanical Garden in Berkeley. The other half of the plants were cultivated at the Berkeley Horticultural Nursery. This spiked a wave of interest in fuchsia breeding. Many famous American hybrids of the Forties and Fifties are the descendants of this 1930 group. == References == == External links == ; Local and National Fuchsia Societies * American Fuchsia Society * The British Fuchsia Society * Euro-Fuchsia \u2013 An Association of European Fuchsia Societies * National Fuchsia Society of New Zealand * Northwest Fuchsia Society (USA) * Western Cape Fuchsia Society (South Africa) ; Information Pages on Fuchsias * Dave's Garden (USA) \u2013 Fuchsia information and reviews. * Fuchsia Magic (UK) \u2013 Fuchsia photos. * Fuchsias in the City (USA) \u2013 Extensive resource on all aspects of fuchsias. * Lancaster, Morecambe & District Fuchsia Society (UK) \u2013 Fuchsia Flower: All you need to know. * Nederlandse Kring van Fuchsiavrienden (NL) \u2013 Searchable database of fuchsia cultivars. * Royal Horticultural Society (UK) \u2013 Fuchsia growing advice. * Washington State University, Spokane County Extension (USA) \u2013 Fuchsia fact sheet.
