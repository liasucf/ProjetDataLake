    "text": "The Kandreho Formation is an Early Jurassic (middle or late Toarcian) geological formation of the Mahajanga Basin of Madagascar. The marly limestones of the formation were deposited in a subtidal lagoonal environment. The formation overlies the Bouleiceras and Spiriferina beds of the early Toarcian and has been correlated to the Marrat Formation of Saudi Arabia. Fossils of the marine crocodylian Andrianavoay (originally classed as a species of Steneosaurus) as well as bivalves and the ammonite Nejdia have been found in the formation.Behazonaty, SW of the basin of the Kelifely at Fossilworks.orgBuffetaut et al., 1981, p.314 The name Kandreho Formation was proposed by Geiger in 2004.Geiger, 2004, p.125 == Gallery == Steneosaurus_NT_small.jpg|Reconstruction of Macrospondylus, a close relative of Andrianavoay Scotese 170 ma.png|Middle Jurassic (170 Ma) == See also == * List of fossiliferous stratigraphic units in Madagascar * Geology of Madagascar * Isalo III Formation * Bemaraha Formation * Toarcian turnover * Toarcian formations **Marne di Monte Serrone, Italy ** Calcare di Sogno, Italy ** Sachrang Formation, Austria ** Posidonia Shale, Lagerst\u00e4tte in Germany ** Ciechocinek Formation, Germany and Poland ** Krempachy Marl Formation, Poland and Slovakia ** Lava Formation, Lithuania ** Azilal Group, North Africa ** Whitby Mudstone, England ** Fernie Formation, Alberta and British Columbia *** Poker Chip Shale ** Whiteaves Formation, British Columbia ** Navajo Sandstone, Utah ** Los Molles Formation, Argentina ** Mawson Formation, Antarctica ** Kota Formation, India ** Cattamarra Coal Measures, Australia == References == === Bibliography === * * Category:Geologic formations of Madagascar Category:Jurassic System of Africa Category:Early Jurassic Africa Category:Jurassic Madagascar Category:Toarcian Stage Category:Limestone formations Category:Lagoonal deposits Category:Paleontology in Madagascar Formations ",
