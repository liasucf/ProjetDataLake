When some football people from Ma\u017eeikiai asked sponsorship for football club Ma\u017eeikiai (also known as FK Jovaras). Lithuanian businessman Romas Marcinkevi\u010dius established new football club and named it ROMAR FC. This club could buy new players and got promoted (Jovaras/Ma\u017eeikiai was in A lyga, so ROMAR took that place in A lyga). In 1993 was in 6th place, in 1994 they became a champions of Lithuania. In 1994/1995 season they was in 3rd place. But after that Romas Marcinkevi\u010dius left Lithuania and went to Canada, and the club lost general sponsor. Club began 1995/1996 season of A lyga, but without sponsorship they were dissolved from any competition. Team defunct in 1995. === ROMAR seasons === :{|class=\"wikitable\" |-bgcolor=\"#efefef\" !
