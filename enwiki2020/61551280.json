Section: Data of the Spanish Representation in Haiti. == Historical relations == On December 17, 1492 Christopher Columbus arrived at La Espa\u00f1ola, part of what would later be called Greater Antilles, and the island became part of the Spanish Empire. Before the arrival of the Spaniards, it was inhabited by ethnic groups Arawaks, Caribs and Ta\u00ednos. At the beginning of the 17th century, due to the boom that had acquired the informal trade of the Creole settlers of the island and that went against the monopoly that the metropolis intended, the Spanish governor Antonio de Osorio ordered between 1605 and 1606 the depopulation of the central and western part of the island in order to stop this practice. Over time, the bucaneros, men who lived on cattle hunting and maroon pigs, the fur trade and tobacco cultivation, settled down in the unpopulated areas of the western part, as well as the filibusters, both of French origin. They first occupied the Turtle Island and later these settlements determined that the western part of the island was claimed by France. In 1697, Spain ceded that part of the island to France by the Treaty of Ryswick, constituting the French Saint Domingue. == Diplomatic relations == Bilateral relations between Spain and Haiti are very good, and have been throughout the 20th century. Haiti recognized the Government of General Franco on April 1, 1939. In December 1946, like almost all the countries that had relations with Spain, he retired his ambassador from Madrid in compliance with the Resolution of United Nations of December 13, 1946. However, on October 6, 1949, said recommendation still in force, the Republic of Haiti restored its diplomatic representation in Spain. In 1951 Spain established its Embassy in Haiti, and since then, there have been close bilateral relations between the two countries.Ficha de Hait\u00ed Office of Diplomatic Information.

Section: Diplomatic relations. == Economic relations == In the last two years, encouraged by contracts tendered by the Haitian Government with international funds, several Spanish engineering, construction and architecture companies have arrived in Haiti. Three Spanish hotel chains have also developed small-scale projects as the first contact with the Haitian tourism sector. Although the country does not have an interesting internal market (10 million inhabitants of which 80% live below the poverty line) Haiti is presented as a platform for export to other countries in the area, including the US, and Especially for textile products. The import of construction products is another sector that could be attractive to Spanish exporters.Ficha de Hait\u00ed Office of Diplomatic Information. Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Economic relations. == Cooperation == The Spanish cooperation was reinforced after the earthquake of 2010, reaching the figure of 346 million \u20ac in the following years.
