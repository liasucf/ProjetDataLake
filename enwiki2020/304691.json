    "text": "Lawrence Harvey Brown (born September 14, 1940) is an American former basketball coach and player who was most recently the head coach for Auxilium Torino of the Italian Lega Basket Serie A (LBA) and EuroCup Basketball. Brown is the only coach in basketball history to win both an NCAA national championship (Kansas Jayhawks, 1988) and an NBA title (Detroit Pistons, 2004). He has a 1,275-965 lifetime professional coaching record in the American Basketball Association (ABA) and the National Basketball Association (NBA) and is the only coach in NBA history to lead eight teams to the playoffs. He also won an ABA championship as a player with the Oakland Oaks in the 1968\u201369 season, and an Olympic Gold Medal in 1964. He is also the only person ever to coach two NBA franchises in the same season (Spurs and Clippers during the 1991\u201392 NBA season). Before coaching, Brown played collegiately at the University of North Carolina and professionally in the ABA. Brown was enshrined in the Basketball Hall of Fame as a coach on September 27, 2002. ==Early life and early basketball accomplishments== Brown is Jewish and was born in Brooklyn, New York. His maternal grandfather Hittelman was from Minsk, Belarus, and his mother's family immigrated to the United States in 1910 and opened a bakery in Brooklyn. His mother met his father Milton Brown, a furniture salesman, when she was 26 years old. He has an older brother, Herbert, who has been an NBA head coach. In 1947 his father died suddenly of an aneurysm. His family moved first to Brooklyn, then to Long Beach, New York, on Long Island. His mother lived until the age of 106. A point guard, Brown attended Long Beach High School. He won a gold medal with Team USA in basketball at the 1961 Maccabiah Games. Brown attended University of North Carolina, where he played basketball under legendary coaches Frank McGuire and Dean Smith. Brown was an All-Atlantic Coast Conference player in 1963. ==Playing career== A stellar player for the Tar Heels in the early 1960s, Brown was considered too small to play in the NBA. He began his post-college career with the NABL's Akron Wingfoots, where he played for two years (1964\u201365). He led the Wingfoots to the 1964 AAU National Championship. Brown was selected for Team USA's 1964 Summer Olympics team, which won the gold medal.. After a brief stint as an assistant coach at North Carolina, Brown joined the upstart American Basketball Association, playing with the New Orleans Buccaneers (1967\u201368), Oakland Oaks (1968\u201369), Washington Caps (1969\u201370), Virginia Squires (1970\u201371), and Denver Rockets (1971\u201372). Brown was named MVP of the ABA's first All-Star Game in 1968, and was named to the All- ABA Second Team the same year. Brown led the ABA in assists per game during the league's first three seasons, and when he ended his playing career, Brown was the ABA's all-time assist leader. His total of 2,509 assists places him seventh on the ABA's career list, and he holds the ABA record for assists in a game with 23. He was a three-time ABA All-Star.Brown, Larry : Jews In Sports @ Virtual Museum ==Coaching and management career== === Early years: 1969\u20131983 === Brown's first head coaching job was at Davidson College in North Carolina in 1969. He resigned after less than two months, having never fielded a team or coached a game. He would not discuss the reasons for his resignation, saying only that \"it was in the best interests of Davidson and myself\". Brown moved on to the ABA and coached with the Carolina Cougars and then the Denver Nuggets, who later joined the NBA in 1976, for five and a half seasons from 1974 to 1979. He then moved on to coach for UCLA (1979\u20131981), leading his freshman-dominated 1979\u201380 team to the NCAA title game before falling to Louisville, 59\u201354. However, that appearance was later vacated by the NCAA after two UCLA players were found to be ineligible\u2014one of the few times a Final Four squad has had its record vacated. Brown was the head coach for the NBA's New Jersey Nets for two years following that, from 1981 to 1983. ===University of Kansas: 1983\u20131988=== Brown began his tenure at the University of Kansas (1983\u20131988), replacing the fired Ted Owens, who had overseen back- to-back losing seasons in 1981\u201382 and 1982\u201383. Brown's impact was felt almost immediately, as the 1983\u201384 Jayhawks put together a 22\u201310 record, finished in second place in that year's Big 8 standings, upset Oklahoma to win the 1984 Big 8 Tournament, and advanced to the 1984 NCAA Tournament's Round of 32 before losing to Wake Forest. In the meantime Brown signed the most coveted high school player in the country, Danny Manning, to play for KU after signing his father, Ed Manning, to a position as an assistant coach. Perhaps Brown's finest team at Kansas was the 1985\u201386 team. This squad put together a 35\u20134 record, the first 30-win season in KU history. They won the Big 8 regular season title for the first time since 1978, defeated Iowa State to win the 1986 Big 8 Tournament, and advanced to the 1986 Final Four before losing to Duke in the semifinals. In the 1987\u201388 season, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8, and the end of the Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse. Ultimately, behind the high- scoring of Danny Manning, KU rallied to win nine of their next twelve games to finish third place in the Big 8 and qualify for the 1988 NCAA Tournament as a 6-seed in the Midwest Regional. Kansas then proceeded to defeat 11th-seed Xavier, 14th-seed Murray State, and 7th-seed Vanderbilt before meeting rival Kansas State, which had beaten KU twice in three meetings that year. KU upset the 4th-seeded Wildcats 71\u201358 in the Elite Eight to reach the Final Four in Kansas City's Kemper Arena. Once there, Kansas upset the East Region's #2 seed Duke, 66\u201359, avenging an overtime loss at home to the Blue Devils earlier in the season. Two nights later, the Jayhawks, who became known as \"Danny and the Miracles\", upset the Southeast Region's #1-seed and fellow Big 8 rival Oklahoma, 83\u201379, to avenge a regular-season sweep by the Sooners and win the 1988 NCAA championship. Manning, who scored 31 points and grabbed 18 rebounds in the final, was named Most Outstanding Player of the Tournament. Kansas concluded the year 27\u201311; the 11 losses remain a record for most losses by an NCAA champion to this day. Two months later, Brown opted to return to professional coaching, departing KU for the San Antonio Spurs. In his five seasons at Kansas, Brown had one Big 8 regular season title, two Big 8 postseason titles, five NCAA Tournament appearances, three Sweet 16 appearances, two trips to the Final Four, and one national title. As a collegiate coach, he had a cumulative coaching record of 177\u201361 (.744) in seven seasons, including a 135\u201344 (.754) record at Kansas. His efforts led to him being named \"Coach of the Year\" for the NCAA in 1988 and \"Coach of the Year\" for the Big Eight Conference in 1986. After Brown left Kansas to return to the NBA, NCAA sanctions were levied against Kansas in the 1988\u201389 season as a result of recruiting violations; potential transfer Vincent Askew was provided with money to leave his campus visit to visit his ill grandmother. No players on any of Brown's teams were named in the report, and Askew did not transfer to Kansas. ===San Antonio Spurs: 1988\u20131991=== Brown was hired to coach the San Antonio Spurs in 1988, signing a five-year, $3.5 million contract. With Brown at the helm, the Spurs won the Midwest Division twice. Brown remained with the Spurs until he was fired on January 21, 1992. ===Los Angeles Clippers: 1991\u20131992=== On February 7, 1992, Brown was hired to coach the Los Angeles Clippers. He took a sub-.500 team in 1992 and guided them to their first winning season since the franchise moved to Los Angeles and their first playoff berth since they were the Buffalo Braves. He followed that up the next season with another playoff appearance in 1993. Brown resigned his position on May 21, 1993. === Indiana Pacers: 1993\u20131997 === Brown was hired by the Indiana Pacers in June 1993. Under Brown, the Pacers went to two straight conference finals, their first ever. He resigned his position in 1997. ===Philadelphia 76ers: 1997\u20132003=== Brown was hired as head coach of the Philadelphia 76ers in 1997. Under his leadership, the team reached the 2001 NBA Finals. Brown was named NBA Coach of the Year following the 2000\u20132001 season. Brown resigned his post in 2003. Brown also served as Director of Basketball Operations in Philadelphia. In 2005, Allen Iverson, who frequently clashed with Brown when he played for him in Philadelphia, said that he was without a doubt \"the best coach in the world.\" ===Detroit Pistons: 2003\u20132005=== Brown won his first (and ultimately only) NBA Championship during his first year with the Detroit Pistons in 2004, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers four games to one in the 2004 NBA Finals. By doing so, Brown became the first, and so far only, man to coach teams to both NCAA and NBA titles. Brown is also the only NBA coach to take two teams (76ers and Pistons) to the NBA Finals against the same opponent (Los Angeles Lakers in 2001 and 2004), lose the first time, and win the second. In May 2005, rumors surfaced that Brown would become the Cleveland Cavaliers' team president as soon as the Detroit Pistons finished their postseason. The rumor, which was not dispelled by Brown, became a major distraction as the Pistons lost to the San Antonio Spurs in seven games in the 2005 NBA Finals. On July 19, 2005, the Pistons\u2014displeased with Brown's public flirtations with other teams\u2014bought out the remaining years of Brown's contract, allowing him to sign with another team. A week later, on July 28, 2005, Brown became the head coach of the New York Knicks, with a 5-year contract reportedly worth between US$50 million and $60 million, making him the highest-paid coach in NBA history. ===New York Knicks: 2005\u20132006=== On January 13, 2006, the Knicks beat the Atlanta Hawks to give Brown his 1,000th win in the NBA, making him only the fourth coach to do so (at the time, the other three were Lenny Wilkens, Don Nelson, and Pat Riley; coincidentally, all three had coached the Knicks at various points).List of New York Knicks coaches Brown's tenure as Knicks head coach lasted one season. The Knicks fired him on June 23, 2006 after he led the team to a 23\u201359 record. Brown's season with the Knicks was marred by public feuds with his own players, most notably point guard Stephon Marbury. After the firing, the Knicks declined to pay the remaining sum (more than $40 million) under Brown's contract on the grounds that he had been terminated for cause. Before the contract dispute was to be heard by NBA Commissioner David Stern, Brown reached an agreement with the Knicks wherein the team agreed to pay him $18.5 million. ===Philadelphia 76ers (front office): 2007\u20132008=== In January 2007, Brown became Executive Vice President of the Philadelphia 76ers. Brown resigned in April 2008. ===Charlotte Bobcats (Charlotte Hornets): 2008\u20132010=== On April 29, 2008, Brown signed to become the head coach of the Charlotte Bobcats \u2013 his ninth NBA coaching job. He managed to keep the relatively young team in playoff contention. The following season, Brown guided the Bobcats to the franchise's first ever playoff appearance. Charlotte was the eighth team he had led to the postseason, an NBA record. On December 22, 2010, Brown parted ways with the Bobcats after the team started the 2010\u20132011 season with a record of 9\u201319. His departure was officially characterized as a resignation, but other sources reported that Brown was fired.Bonnell, Rick. Brown fired as Charlotte Bobcats head coach; Silas takes over The Charlotte Observer, 2010-12-23. Assistant coach Jeff Capel II told The Charlotte Observer that the entire coaching staff had been fired. ===Southern Methodist University: 2012\u20132016=== On April 17, 2012, ESPN reported that Brown was to be named the new head coach of the SMU Mustangs, replacing Matt Doherty, who had been fired from SMU earlier in March. Tim Jankovich, the head coach of Illinois State, was hired as the coach-in-waiting. After a rebuilding season in 2012\u20132013 (15\u201317), Brown brought SMU into the national conversation the following year, leading the team to a 27\u201310 record, as well as its first appearance in The Associated Press Top 25 rankings since 1985, in the 2013\u20132014 season. SMU went on to be the overall number one seed in the National Invitational Tournament, losing in the final game of the tournament to Minnesota. In the following 2014\u20132015 season, SMU won the American Athletic Conference tournament and secured its first NCAA Tournament appearance since 1993. On September 29, 2015, Brown was suspended by the NCAA for 30% of the Mustangs' games in the upcoming 2015\u20132016 season, and the team was banned from 2016 post-season play, placed on probation for three years, and lost nine scholarships over a three- year period. The NCAA found that Brown failed to report violations when a former administrative assistant committed academic fraud on behalf of a student-athlete and he initially lied to enforcement staff about his knowledge of the potential violations. On July 8, 2016, Brown announced his resignation as head basketball coach. ===Auxilium Torino: 2018=== On June 12, 2018, Brown accepted the proposal of Auxilium Torino to become the new head coach of the Italian basketball club of the Lega Basket Serie A (LBA). On June 17, he officially became new head coach of Torino. He was fired midseason on December 27 with the team's record at just 5\u201319. ===Other coaching experience=== Brown was chosen as the head coach for the USA men's basketball team at the 2004 Summer Olympics. That team won the bronze medal at the Olympics; it was the first U.S. men's basketball team to fail to win gold at a Summer Olympics since professional players began playing on the U.S. men's team in 1992. ==Head coaching record== ===ABA and NBA=== |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"|Carolina* | style=\"text-align:left;\"|1972\u201373 |84||57||27||.679|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1st in East||12||7||5||.583 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Lost in Division Finals |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"|Carolina* | style=\"text-align:left;\"|1973\u201374 |84||47||37||.560|| style=\"text- align:center;\"|3rd in East||4||0||4||.000 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Lost in Division Semifinals |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"|Denver* | style=\"text- align:left;\"|1974\u201375 |84||65||19||.774|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1st in West||13||7||6||.538 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Lost in Division Finals |- | style=\"text-align:left;\"|Denver* | style=\"text-align:left;\"|1975\u201376 |84||60||24||.714|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1st in West||13||6||7||.462 | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Lost in ABA Finals |- | style=\"text- align:left;\"|Denver | style=\"text-align:left;\"| |82||50||32||.610|| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1st in Midwest||6||2||4||.333 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|Lost in Conf.
