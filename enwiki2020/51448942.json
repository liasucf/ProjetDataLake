    "text": "Guido De Philippis (born August 16, 1985 at Fiesole) is an Italian mathematician. He works on the calculus of variations, partial differential equations and geometric measure theory. In 2016 he was awarded the EMS Prize, \"for his outstanding contributions to the regularity of solutions of Monge\u2013Amp\u00e8re equation and optimal maps and for his deep work on quantitative stability inequalities for the first eigenvalue of the Laplacian and rigidity in some isoperimetric type inequalities.\". In 2018 he was awarded the Stampacchia Medal. De Philippis was a PhD student of Luigi Ambrosio and Luis Caffarelli. ==Selected publications== *with Alessio Figalli: The Monge-Amp\u00e8re equation and its link to optimal transportation, Bull.
