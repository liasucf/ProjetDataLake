The film is based on Coca-Cola's iconic polar bears and was released on the company's website and YouTube channel on December 31, 2012. ==Plot== Kaskae leads his family of polar bears across the Arctic Circle to give a speech to other polar bears. Jak, the troublemaker in the family, is given the task of looking after his little sister Kaia along with his elder brother Zook. Hearing part of Kaskae's speech about reaching new heights, Jak rushes to the peak of the tundra with Zook trailing him. As soon as both brothers reach the top, Jak shoves Zook before they both slide down and crash their father's speech. The family then discovers an unattended Kaia dancing with a flock of puffins. The other polar bears are not amused by the scene, as their kind are not supposed to socialize with the puffins, but Jak jumps in the water to join in the fun. Kaskae then orders everyone to be silent before he and the rest of the family jump in to play in the water. ==Cast== *Lin-Manuel Miranda as Jak *Armie Hammer as Zook *Jonathan Adams as Kaskae *Megyn Price as Sakari *Lola Augspurger as Kaia *Jenna Lamia as Polar Girl 1 *Anne Gregory as Polar Girl 2 ==References== ==External links== * (Coca-Cola) * (Animal Logic) * Category:2012 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2010s American animated films Category:2012 3D films Category:2012 animated films Category:American animated short films Category:Animated films about bears Category:Animated films about birds Category:Films directed by John Stevenson Category:Films scored by Edward Shearmur Category:Films about polar bears Category:Films set in the Arctic Category:Promotional campaigns by Coca-Cola Category:Scott Free Productions films Category:Animal Logic films Category:American 3D films Category:Computer-animated short films Category:3D animated short films ",
