Their mission is to improve the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of infection-related diseases by promoting and supporting research, education, training, and good medical practice.https://www.escmid.org/membership_organization/about_escmid/mission/ Another of the important tasks completed by the society is the organization of the annual four-days scientific congress ECCMID (European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases). This is the largest scientific congress in the field of medical microbiology with almost 15,000 visitors.https://www.escmid.org/research_projects/eccmid/ To present scientific work at the congress, more than 5,000 abstracts are submitted every year by researchers from many different countries.https://www.escmid.org/research_projects/eccmid/about_the_congress/ The next ECCMID will be held in Vienna, Austria. The ESCMID jointly organizes European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST), the European standing committee for defining guidelines to interpret antimicrobial resistance. ==History== It was founded on 12 February 1983 in Munich as the European Society of Clinical Microbiology. In 1990 it was decided to include infectious diseases. ==Structure== It is headquartered in Basel in the Swiss Basel-Stadt canton.
