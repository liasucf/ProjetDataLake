    "text": "\"Come and Stay with Me\" is a pop song, written by Jackie DeShannon in 1965 for the British singer Marianne Faithfull. It became one of her biggest hits, peaking #4 at United Kingdom. ==Background== Faithfull's former manager Tony Calder told Mojo magazine in September 2008 that the song was written in Los Angeles, where he was with Jimmy Page who had an affair with DeShannon: \"One night I couldn't get into our hotel room because Jimmy and Jackie DeShannon were shagging. So I yelled, 'When you've finished could you write a song for Marianne?'\" DeShannon came up with this song plus with Page an album track, \"In My Time of Sorrow.\" ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"text- align:center;\"|Chart (1965) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|26 |- |align=\"left|UK Singles Chart | style=\"text- align:center;\"|4 |- |align=\"left|Australia Kent Music Report | style=\"text- align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left|Ireland IRMA | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |align=\"left\"|French Singles Chart | style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |} == Other versions == * Cher recorded a cover version of the song for her 1965 debut solo album All I Really Want to Do. * German-American singer Katja Holl\u00e4nder, daughter of composer Friedrich Hollaender, recorded the song with German lyrics as \"Immer wenn ich deinen Namen h\u00f6r'\" for her 1966 album Hallo, Katja!
