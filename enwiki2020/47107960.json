The tournament was the inaugural edition of the Women's World Twenty20 Qualifier, with the top three teams advancing to the 2014 World Twenty20 in Bangladesh. Eight teams played in the tournament. The host, Ireland, was joined by the two lowest-placed teams from the 2012 World Twenty20, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, as well as five teams from regional qualifying tournaments. Pakistan and Sri Lanka both went on to be undefeated at the tournament, sharing the title after the final was interrupted by rain. Ireland defeated the Netherlands in the third-place playoff to also qualify for the World Twenty20.(1 August 2013). \"Ireland hold nerve to seal World T20 berth\" \u2013 ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 29 June 2015. ==Qualification and format== Originally, the ICC had determined that only the winner of the tournament would qualify for the World Twenty20, with that tournament then having only eight teams. This decision was altered at the 2013 International Cricket Council (ICC) annual conference in June 2013, as part of a concerted effort to support women's cricket.(16 July 2013). \"Three qualifiers to head to Women's WT20\" \u2013 ESPNcricinfo. Retrieved 29 June 2015. The eight teams at the qualifier were divided into two groups based on their ranking, with the four teams that failed to make the semi-finals going on to participate in a rep\u00eachage tournament (the Shield).ICC WOMEN'S WT20 QUALIFIER 2013 \u2013 International Cricket Council.
