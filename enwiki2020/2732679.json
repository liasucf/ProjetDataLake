    "text": "Milton Edward Wilcox (born April 20, 1950) is a former Major League Baseball pitcher who had a sixteen-year career from 1970 to 1986. He played for the Cincinnati Reds and Chicago Cubs of the National League and the Cleveland Indians, Detroit Tigers and Seattle Mariners of the American League. He won a World Series title with the Tigers in . On April 15, 1983, Wilcox came within one out of a perfect game, when Chicago White Sox batter Jerry Hairston, Sr. singled off him in the ninth inning. The perfect game would also have been the first no-hitter by a Tiger since Jim Bunning in . With Detroit, he was a reliable starter in the rotation for years, consistently giving his team six and more innings each start. This complemented Jack Morris and Dan Petry, who were power pitchers and considered the aces. His 17 wins in 1984 were important in the Tigers' run to their world championship. (Morris won 19, Petry 18 that year.) He won one game each in that year's ALCS and World Series. That year, he also started his season going 6-0. This was not duplicated by a Tiger pitcher until 2007, by Jeremy Bonderman. ==See also== == References == ==External links== *Milt Wilcox at SABR (Baseball BioProject) Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:\u00c1guilas del Zulia players Category:Baseball players from Hawaii Category:Cardenales de Lara players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Chicago Cubs players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Cleveland Indians players Category:Detroit Tigers players Category:Evansville Triplets players Category:Florida Instructional League Reds players Category:Gulf Coast Reds players Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Seattle Mariners players Category:St. Petersburg Pelicans players Category:Tampa Tarpons (1957\u20131987) players Category:Tigres de Aragua players Category:Wichita Aeros players Category:Sportspeople from Honolulu ",
