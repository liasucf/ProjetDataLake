He became a licentiate of the Royal College of Surgeons in 1841, and a Fellow in 1856.British Medical Journal: Obituaries, Jan 1892 He thereafter acted as an examiner to students. In 1860, together with Dr John Smith and Dr Robert Orphoot he co-founded the Edinburgh Dental Dispensary at 1 Drummond Street. He had his main dental practice at 48 Queen Street, a few doors away from James Young Simpson's offices at 52 Queen Street.Dental History Magazine: Vol2 Issue 1 p.14 At that time he was one of only two dentists to become President of the Royal College of Surgeons in Edinburgh (RCSE).
