Azarian also uses a black bold frame around her illustrations, intended to represent a photo that has been taken. == Synopsis == The book is based on a true story. Martin has written about the first known snowflake photographer, Wilson Bentley, and his interest in capturing snowflakes. Wilson lived on a farm with his family in Jericho, Vermont, between Lake Champlain and Mount Mansfield, where the annual snowfall can reach up to about 120 inches. Wilson was very fond of snowflakes and wanted to capture them one day to share with others. With a microscope, Wilson tried to depict the snowflakes through drawings but was never able to finish, as the snow would melt too quickly. As Wilson grew older, he asked his parents if they could get him a camera, so that he could photograph snowflakes. Wilson\u2019s parents decided to spend their savings to buy Wilson his camera because they wanted to support his dream of capturing snowflake photos. With his new-found camera, Wilson went out to take hundreds of pictures. In the beginning, Wilson\u2019s photos were a bunch of failures, but that did not stop him from pursuing his dream. Wilson furthered himself by experimenting more with lighting, lenses and camera exposures. Not many people were interested in what Wilson was up to, nor did they care for his pictures. When it wasn't winter, Wilson loved taking pictures of nature, but taking snow pictures would always be his favorite. Wilson would even hold evening slideshows on his lawn to show his friends. Later down the road, Wilson wrote a book about snow and published his photos in magazines. When Wilson went to publish his first book to share to the world, he got caught in a blizzard on his trip, a misfortune which caused him to catch pneumonia and become ill. Two weeks later, Wilson died of the illness. In memory of him, Wilson\u2019s friends and neighbors built a museum of his work so all would know of \u201cSnowflake\u201d Bentley. == Critical reception == Snowflake Bentley received many reviews. Kirkus reviews says \u201cThis is a lyrical biographical tribute to a farmer\u2026whose love of snow and careful camera work expanded both natural science and photography\u201d,Kirkus Reviews and Horn book review says \u201cThe book exhibits a beautiful blend of Azarian\u2019s splendid woodcuts, a lyrical text, and factual sidebars.\u201dHorn Book Reviews ==References== Category:American picture books Category:Caldecott Medal-winning works Category:1998 children's books Category:Houghton Mifflin books Category:Children's history books Category:Works about photographers ",
