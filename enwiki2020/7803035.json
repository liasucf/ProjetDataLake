    "text": "A black sex-link hen Sex-linksThe Making of Sex-Links - FeatherSite Barry Koffler are crossbred chickens whose color at hatching is differentiated by sex, thus making chick sexing an easier process. Sex-links come in several varieties. As hybrids of laying or dual-purpose breeds infused with extra vigor via heterosis, sex-links can be extremely good egg-layers which often produce 300 eggs a year or more depending on the quality of care and feed. The color of their eggs vary according to the mix of breeds, and blue-green eggs are possible. Chicks of a single breed that are similarly sex-linked are called autosex chickens, a term developed to differentiate between sex linkage in purebred chickens versus sex linkage in crossbreeds. ==Sex-link types== Many common varieties are known as the black sex-link (also called black stars) and the red sex-link (also called red stars).Sex-Links - FeatherSite Barry Koffler More specific variety names are common as well. * Black sex-link like \"Black rocks\" are a cross between unique specially bred hybrid strains of Rhode Island Red rooster (but any non-white and non barred rooster may be used for other black sex-link crosses) and a Barred Rock hen (which carry both extended black and barring genes). * Red sex-links are a cross between a Rhode Island Red or New Hampshire rooster and a White Rock (This variety pair is known as a Golden Comet), Silver Laced Wyandotte, Rhode Island White, or Delaware hen. One example of a red-linked breed is the Red Shaver, and ISA Brown sex-links are found in Canada.Isa Brown Commercial Stock & Parent Stock White birds should not be used in sex-linked crosses because white color allele is sometimes dominant and sometimes recessive.Sex-linked Information ==Gallery== File:A_Red_Sex_Link_Rooster_\"Freckles\".jpg|A red sex-link rooster File:Black Rock Hen 'Blackie'.jpg|A Black Rock hen File:RedStarhen.jpg|A red sex-link pullet File:Beautiful Roo by sejr.jpg|A black sex-link rooster File:Shipped pullets.jpg|Shipped pullets File:Linda Lee, a pet Red Sex Link hen (2004).jpg|Red sex-link hen File:Black Sex Link Chicken.JPG|Black sex-link rooster ==See also== * ZW sex-determination system * List of chicken breeds ==References== ==External links== Category:Chicken crossbreeds ",
