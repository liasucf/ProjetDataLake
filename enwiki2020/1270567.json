    "text": "Franck is a small lunar impact crater that lies near the north end of Sinus Amoris, a bay on the northern part of Mare Tranquillitatis. Its diameter is 12 km. It was named after German physicist and Nobel laureate James Franck. The crater lies just to the southeast of Brewster, and farther to the south of R\u00f6mer. Franck was previously designated R\u00f6mer K. Oblique view from Apollo 15 Franck Crater is to the south of the photo, to the north is R\u00f6mer and its satellite craters with R\u00f6mer T being the closest of it located north (Photo from the LRO) This is a circular, bowl-shaped crater with a sharp rim that has not been significantly eroded. The interior walls slope down to the tiny floor at the midpoint. Just to the north of Franck is a joined pair of smaller craters, and the three nearly form a merged cluster of impacts. ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * ==External links== * LTO-43D2 Franck -- L&PI; topographic map Category:Impact craters on the Moon ",
