His marriage to his wife Sarah (Kathleen Turner) is disintegrating in the aftermath of the murder of their 12 year-old son, Ethan. Sarah eventually leaves Macon, moving out of their house and into an apartment. After he falls down the basement stairs and breaks his leg, Macon returns to his childhood home to stay with his eccentric siblings. Macon is pursued by Muriel Pritchet (Geena Davis), an animal hospital employee and dog trainer with a sickly son. Macon eventually hires Muriel to put his dog through much-needed obedience training. Although Muriel at first seems brash and unsophisticated, Macon eventually finds himself opening up to her and trusting her, and he moves into her apartment. When Sarah's apartment lease is up, she moves back into their old home and suggests to Macon that they start over. Macon leaves Muriel, and he and Sarah set up house once more. When Macon visits Paris for research, Muriel surprises him by showing up on the same flight and stays in the same Paris hotel, recommended by Macon in one of his travel guides. She suggests that they enjoy themselves as if they are vacationing together. Macon insists he is there strictly for business, and although he shows concern for how Alexander is doing, keeps Muriel at arm's length. During Macon\u2019s last night in Paris, Muriel asks to go with him, and despite an early flight she tells him he doesn\u2019t have to reply just now. Waking up in the middle of the night Macon decides to call Muriel but his telephone malfunctions. Macon gets up and while trying fix the cord, hurts his back and becomes bedridden. Muriel knocks on his door waking him up but before he can decide what to do Muriel assumes he has gone already and leaves. Mustering the strength to go to the front desk, Macon phones his publisher to inform him of his back pain. Sarah comes to Paris, sent by Macon\u2019s sister Rose, to care and make day-trips for him in order to complete his travel guide. Sarah proposes that after finishing the day trips if he is feeling better they can go sightseeing, reschedule the flight for a latter date and make the trip a second honeymoon to which Macon agrees. However, Sarah tells him that she has run into Muriel when she arrived and as such continues to question Macon about his attraction to Muriel, angering Macon. The next morning, Macon dresses while Sarah still sleeps, then wakes her to tell her that he is going back to Muriel. On his way to the airport, Macon spots Muriel hailing a taxi and tells the driver to stop. Thinking the driver stopped for her, Muriel bends to gather her luggage and catches sight of Macon in the taxi. She smiles, and Macon returns the smile. ==Cast== * William Hurt as Macon Leary * Kathleen Turner as Sarah Leary * Geena Davis as Muriel Pritchett * Bill Pullman as Julian Edge * Amy Wright as Rose Leary * David Ogden Stiers as Porter Leary * Ed Begley Jr. as Charles Leary * Robert Hy Gorman as Alexander Pritchett * Bradley Mott as Mr. Loomis * Seth Granger as Ethan Leary * Jake Kasdan as Scott Canfield * Jonathan Kasdan as boy at doctor's office * Peggy Converse as Mrs. Barrett * Walter Sparrow as hot dog vendor * Paul Williamson as London hotel manager * Audrey Rapoport as girl on plane * Meg Kasdan as receptionist == Reception == Roger Ebert praised the film, giving it four out of four stars.
