(; 11 July 1561 \u2013 24 May 1627) was a Spanish Baroque lyric poet. G\u00f3ngora and his lifelong rival, Francisco de Quevedo, are widely considered the most prominent Spanish poets of all time. His style is characterized by what was called culteranismo, also known as Gongorismo. This style existed in stark contrast to Quevedo's conceptismo. ==Biography== G\u00f3ngora was born to a noble family in C\u00f3rdoba, where his father, Francisco de Argote, was corregidor, or judge. In a Spanish era when purity of Christian lineage (limpieza de sangre) was needed to gain access to education or official appointments, he adopted the surname of his mother, Leonor de G\u00f3ngora.Asociaci\u00f3n Cultural Nueva Acr\u00f3polis en Gand\u00eda. G\u00d3NGORA Y GARIBALDI His uncle, Don Franscisco, a prebendary of C\u00f3rdoba Cathedral, renounced his post in favor of his nephew, who took deacon's orders in 1586.Arthur Terry, An Anthology of Spanish Poetry 1500\u20131700. Part II (Pergamon Press, 1968), 19. As a canon associated with this Cathedral, Luis de G\u00f3ngora traveled on diverse commissions to Navarre, Andalusia and Castile. The cities that he visited included Madrid, Salamanca, Granada, Ja\u00e9n, and Toledo. Around 1605, he was ordained priest, and afterwards lived at Valladolid and Madrid. While his circle of admirers grew, patrons were grudging in their admiration. Ultimately, in 1617 through the influence of the Duke of Lerma, he was appointed honorary chaplain to King Philip III of Spain, but did not enjoy the honor long. He maintained a long feud with Francisco de Quevedo, who matched him in talent and wit. Both poets composed many bitter, satirical pieces attacking one other, with Quevedo criticizing G\u00f3ngora's penchant for flattery, his large nose, and his passion for gambling. Quevedo even accused his enemy of sodomy, which was a capital crime in 17th century Spain. In his \"Contra el mismo (G\u00f3ngora)\", Quevedo writes of G\u00f3ngora: No altar, garito s\u00ed; poco cristiano, / mucho tah\u00far, no cl\u00e9rigo, s\u00ed arp\u00eda.\"There's no altar, but there's a gambling den; not much of a Christian, / but he's very much a cardsharp, not a cleric, definitely a harpy.\" G\u00f3ngora's nose, the subject of Quevedo's \"A una nariz\", begins with the lines: \u00c9rase un hombre a una nariz pegado, / \u00e9rase una nariz superlativa, / \u00e9rase una nariz say\u00f3n y escriba, / \u00e9rase un peje espada muy barbado.. Translation: \"Once there was a man stuck to a nose, / it was a nose more marvellous than weird, / it was a nearly living web of tubes, / it was a swordfish with an awful beard.\" This angry feud came to a nasty end for G\u00f3ngora when Quevedo bought the house he lived in for the only purpose of ejecting him from it. In 1626 a severe illness, which seriously impaired the poet's memory, forced him to return to C\u00f3rdoba, where he died the next year. By then he was broke from trying to obtain positions and win lawsuits for all his relatives. An edition of his poems was published almost immediately after his death by Juan L\u00f3pez de Vicu\u00f1a; the frequently reprinted edition by Hozes did not appear until 1633. The collection consists of numerous sonnets, odes, ballads, songs for guitar, and of some larger poems, such as the Soledades and the F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea) (1612), the two landmark works of the highly refined style called \"culteranismo\" or \"Gongorismo\". Miguel de Cervantes, in his Viaje del Parnaso, catalogued the good and bad poets of his time. He considered G\u00f3ngora to be one of the good ones. Vel\u00e1zquez painted his portrait. Numerous documents, lawsuits and satires of his rival Quevedo paint a picture of a man jovial, sociable, and talkative, who loved card-playing and bullfights. His bishop accused him of rarely attending choir, and of praying less than fervently when he did go. G\u00f3ngora's passion for card-playing ultimately contributed to his ruin.Bartolom\u00e9 Bennassar, The Spanish Character: Attitudes and Mentalities from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), 167. Frequent allusions and metaphors associated with card-playing in G\u00f3ngora's poetry reveal that cards formed part of his daily life. He was often reproached for activities beneath the dignity of a churchman. ==Style== Culteranismo existed in stark contrast with conceptismo, another movement of the Baroque period which is characterized by a witty style, games with words, simple vocabulary, and conveying multiple meanings in as few words as possible. The best-known representative of Spanish conceptismo, Francisco de Quevedo, had an ongoing feud with Luis de G\u00f3ngora in which each criticized the other's writing and personal life. The word culteranismo blends culto (\"cultivated\") and luteranismo (\"Lutheranism\") and was coined by its opponents to present it as a heresy of \"true\" poetry. The movement aimed to use as many words as possible to convey little meaning or to conceal meaning. \"G\u00f3ngora's poetry is inclusive rather than exclusive\", one scholar has written, \"willing to create and incorporate the new, literally in the form of neologisms.\"Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda, Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature (Duke University Press,1993), 197. G\u00f3ngora's signature. G\u00f3ngora had a penchant for highly Latinate and Greek neologisms, which his opponents mocked. Quevedo lampooned his rival by writing a sonnet, \"Aguja de navegar cultos,\" which listed words from G\u00f3ngora's lexicon: \"He would like to be a culto poet in just one day, / must the following jargon learn: / Fulgores, arrogar, joven, presiente / candor, construye, m\u00e9trica, armon\u00eda...\"Quoted in D\u00e1maso Alonso, La lengua po\u00e9tica de G\u00f3ngora (Madrid: Revista de Filolog\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola, 1950), 114. Quevedo actually mocked G\u00f3ngora's style in several sonnets, including \"Sulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo.\"CVC. Las s\u00e1tiras de Quevedo. El soneto de Quevedo: \u00abSulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo\u00bb: ensayo de interpretaci\u00f3n This anti-Gongorist sonnet mocks the unintelligibility of culteranismo and its widespread use of flowery neologisms, including sulquivagante (he who plies the seas; to travel without a clear destination); speluncas (\"caves\"); surculos (sprouts, scions). He was also the first to write poems imitating the speech of blacks.Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda, Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature (Duke University Press, 1993), 197. G\u00f3ngora also had a penchant for apparent breaks in syntactical flow, as he overturned the limitations of syntax, making the hyperbaton the most prominent feature of his poetry.Roberto Gonz\u00e1lez Echevarr\u00eda, Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature (Duke University Press,1993), 197. He has been called a man of \"unquestioned genius and almost limitless culture, an initiator who enriched his language with the vast power, beauty, and scope of a mighty pen.\"John Armstrong Crow, The Epic of Latin America (University of California Press, 1992), 300. As far away as Peru, he received the praise of Juan de Espinosa Medrano (ca. 1629\u20131688), who wrote a piece defending G\u00f3ngora's poetry from criticism called Apolog\u00e9tico en favor de Don Luis de G\u00f3ngora, Pr\u00edncipe de los poetas lyricos de Espa\u00f1a: contra Manuel de Faria y Sousa, Cavallero portugu\u00e9s (1662).Biografia de Juan de Espinosa Medrano As D\u00e1maso Alonso has pointed out, Gongora's contribution to the Spanish language should not be underestimated, as he picked up what were in his time obscure or little-used words and used them in his poetry again and again, thereby reviving or popularizing them. Many of these words are quite common today, such as adolescente, asunto, brillante, construir, eclipse, emular, erigir, fragmento, frustrar, joven, meta, and porci\u00f3n.D\u00e1maso Alonso, La lengua po\u00e9tica de G\u00f3ngora (Madrid: Revista de Filolog\u00eda Espa\u00f1ola, 1950), 112. == Works == Title page of the Chacon Manuscript. G\u00f3ngora's poems are usually grouped into two blocks, corresponding more or less to two successive poetic stages. His F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea) and his Soledades (1613) are his best-known compositions and the most studied.Personas que escriben bonito The F\u00e1bula is written in royal octaves (octavas reales) and his Soledades is written in a variety of metres and strophes, but principally in stanzas and silvas interspersed with choruses.Personas que escriben bonito G\u00f3ngora's F\u00e1bula de Polifemo y Galatea (1612) narrates a mythological episode described in Ovid's Metamorphoses: the love of Polyphemus, one of the Cyclopes, for the nymph Galatea, who rejects him. In the poem's end, Acis, enamored with Galatea, is turned into a river.Personas que escriben bonito G\u00f3ngora's F\u00e1bula de P\u00edramo y Tisbe (Fable of Pyramus and Thisbe) (1618) is a complex poem that mocks gossiping and avaricious women. G\u00f3ngora also wrote sonnets concerning various subjects of an amatory, satirical, moral, philosophical, religious, controversial, laudatory, and funereal nature. As well as the usual topics (carpe diem etc.) the sonnets include autobiographical elements, describing, for example, the increasing decrepitude and advancing age of the author. In addition, G\u00f3ngora composed one of his most ambitions works, El Paneg\u00edrico al Duque de Lerma (1617), a poem in 79 royal octaves. Cervantes, after reading \"El Paneg\u00edrico\", said: \"the [work] I most esteem from those I've read of his.\"http://www.upf.edu/todogongora/_pdf/Ponce_Cxrdenas_El_Panegxrico_al_duque_de_Lerma_Trascendencia_de_un_modelo_gongorino.pdf He also wrote plays, which include La destrucci\u00f3n de Troya, Las firmezas de Isabela, and the unfinished Doctor Carlino.Personas que escriben bonito Although G\u00f3ngora did not publish his works (he had attempted to do so in 1623), manuscript copies were circulated and compiled in cancioneros (songbooks), and anthologies published with or without his permission. In 1627, Juan Lopez Vicu\u00f1a published Verse Works of the Spanish Homer, which is also considered very trustworthy and important in establishing the G\u00f3ngora's corpus of work. Vicu\u00f1a's work was appropriated by the Spanish Inquisition and was later surpassed by an edition by Gonzalo de Hozes in 1633. ==G\u00f3ngora and the Generation of '27== The Generation of '27 took its name from the year 1927 in which the tricentennial of G\u00f3ngora's death, ignored by official academic circles, was celebrated with recitals, avant-garde happenings, and an ambitious plan to publish a new critical edition of his work, as well as books and articles on aspects of his work that had not been fully researched.C\u00e9sar Augusto Salgado, From Modernism to Neobaroque: Joyce and Lezama Lima (2001, Bucknell University Press), 37. The Generation of '27 was the first to attempt to self-consciously revive baroque literature. D\u00e1maso Alonso wrote that G\u00f3ngora's complex language conveyed meaning in that it created a world of pure beauty. Alonso explored his work exhaustively and called G\u00f3ngora a \"mystic of words.\"Personas que escriben bonito Alonso dispelled the notion that G\u00f3ngora had two separate styles \u2013\"simple\" and \"difficult\" poems- that were also divided chronologically between his early and later years. He argued that G\u00f3ngora's more complex poems built on stylistic devices that had been created in G\u00f3ngora's early career as a poet. He also argued that the apparent simplicity of some of G\u00f3ngora's early poems is often deceptive.Arthur Terry, An Anthology of Spanish Poetry 1500\u20131700. Part II (Pergamon Press, 1968), 20. Rafael Alberti added his own Soledad tercera (Par\u00e1frasis incompleta).Argos 16/ Ensayo/ Guadalupe Mercado In 1961, Alberti declared, \"I am a visual poet, like all of the poets from Andalusia, from G\u00f3ngora to Garc\u00eda Lorca.\"Quoted in C.B. Morris, This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920\u20131936 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), 87. Lorca presented a lecture called \"La imagen po\u00e9tica en don Lu\u00eds de G\u00f3ngora\" at the Ateneo in Seville in 1927.Garcia Lorca, Federico \u2013 CanalSocial \u2013 Enciclopedia GER In this lecture, Lorca paid Jean Epstein the compliment of comparing the film director with G\u00f3ngora as an authority on images.C.B. Morris, This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920\u20131936 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), 47. ==References in fiction and philosophy== The philosopher Baruch Spinoza proposed in his Ethics (1677) that a man can die before his body stops moving. As an example he mentioned \"a Spanish poet who suffered an illness; though he recovered, he was left so oblivious to his past life that he did not believe the tales and tragedies he had written were his own\".Spinoza (1677/1985), p. 569 (scholium to proposition 39 of part 4) The historian Carl Gebhardt wrote that \"this was probably G\u00f3ngora, whose works Spinoza possessed, and who lost his memory a year before his death\".Spinoza (1677/1985), p. 569, footnote 22 The narrator of the Captain Alatriste series, a friend of Francisco de Quevedo within the stories, illustrates G\u00f3ngora's feuding with Quevedo, both by quoting poetry from each as well as describing Quevedo's attitude toward G\u00f3ngora through the course of the story. Excerpts of poetry from one against the other are included within the story itself and poetry from each is included at the back of some of the books. Lawrence Durrell in his novel Clea (1960), part of The Alexandria Quartet, includes a passage from the journal of his fictional novelist Pursewarden: \"Why should the artist always be trying to saturate the world with his own anguish\u2026emotional Gongorism!\" In Giannina Braschi's bilingual novel Yo-Yo Boing! (1998) contemporary Latin American poets have a heated debate about G\u00f3ngora's and Quevedo's role in defining the Spanish empire through their works. The musical group Dead Can Dance used an English translation of G\u00f3ngora's Da bienes Fortuna as the lyrics for the song \"Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Book\" on their 1990 album Aion. In the second of the five parts of Roberto Bola\u00f1o's novel 2666 (published posthumously in 2004), \"The Part about Amalfitano\", one of the characters (the poet, whose name is never explicitly stated) quotes a verse from G\u00f3ngora: Ande yo caliente y r\u00edase la gente. == References == ==Sources== * * Hennigfeld, Ursula (2008).
