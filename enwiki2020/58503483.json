    "text": "Ariadne is a 1913 painting by Greco-Italian artist Giorgio de Chirico. Done in oil and graphite on canvas, the painting depicts the mythical figure Ariadne as she lays sleeping in an empty public square; this is in reference to the myth that birthed the character, in which Ariadne is abandoned on Naxos by her lover Theseus. According to sources provided by the Metropolitan Museum of Art, this reflects de Chirico's personal feelings of isolation after moving to Paris in 1911. The painting, currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, was donated to the museum as part of the bequest of Florene Schoenborn in 1995. == References == == See also == *The Soothsayer's Recompense, another painting by Chirico that depicted Ariadne Category:1913 paintings Category:Paintings by Giorgio de Chirico Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Paintings depicting Greek myths ",
