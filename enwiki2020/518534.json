    "text": "The Mekong Delta (, literally Nine Dragon river delta or simply , \"Mekong river delta\"), also known as the Western Region () or the South-western region () is the region in southwestern Vietnam where the Mekong River approaches and empties into the sea through a network of distributaries. The Mekong delta region encompasses a large portion of southwestern Vietnam of over .Mekong Delta on ARCBC (ASEAN Regional Centre for Biodiversity Conservation) site The size of the area covered by water depends on the season. Before 1975, Mekong Delta was part of Republic of Vietnam. Today, the region comprises 12 provinces: Long An, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, Ti\u1ec1n Giang, An Giang, B\u1ebfn Tre, V\u0129nh Long, Tr\u00e0 Vinh, H\u1eadu Giang, Ki\u00ean Giang, S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng, B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau, and C\u00e0 Mau, along with the province-level municipality of C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1. The Mekong Delta has been dubbed a 'biological treasure trove'. Over 1,000 animal species were recorded between 1997 and 2007 and new species of plants, fish, lizards, and mammals have been discovered in previously unexplored areas, including the Laotian rock rat, thought to be extinct.Ashley Fantz, \"Mekong a 'treasure trove' of 1,000 newly discovered species\", CNN. December 16, 2008. ==History== ===Funan period=== Visnu found at \u00d3c Eo (6\u20137th century AD). The Mekong Delta was likely inhabited long since prehistory; the empires of Funan and Chenla maintained a presence in the Mekong Delta for centuries. Archaeological discoveries at \u00d3c Eo and other Funanese sites show that the area was an important part of the Funan kingdom, bustling with trading ports and canals as early as in the first century AD and extensive human settlement in the region may have gone back as far as the 4th century BC. Angkor Borei is a site in the Mekong Delta that existed between 400 BC-500 AD. This site had extensive maritime trade networks throughout Southeast Asia and with India, and is believed to have possibly been the ancient capital to the Kingdom of Funan.Stark, M., & Sovath, B. (2001). Recent research on emergent complexity in Cambodia's Mekong. Bulletin of the Indo-Pacific Prehistory Association, 21(5), 85\u201398. ===Khmer period=== Together with Southeast (Vietnam), the region was known as Kampuchea Krom (Lower Cambodia) to the Khmer Empire, which likely maintained settlements there centuries before its rise in the 11th and 12th centuries.\"At the height of the Khmer Empire's economic and political strength, during the eleventh and twelfth centuries, its rulers established and fostered the growth of Prey Nokor[...] It is possible that there already had been a settlement at this location in the Mekong marshes for some centuries, depending, as Prey Nokor did, on the handling of goods traded between the countries bordering the South China Sea and the interior provinces of the empire.\" The kingdom of Champa, though mainly based along the coast of modern Central Vietnam, is known to have expanded west into the Mekong Delta, seizing control of Prey Nokor (the precursor to modern-day Ho Chi Minh City) by the end of the 13th century.\"Such a trading center was bound to be one of the prizes in the struggle for power that developed in the thirteenth century between the declining Khmer Empire and the expanding kingdom of Champa, and by the end of that century the Cham people had seized control of the town.\" Author Nghia M. Vo suggests that a Cham presence may indeed have existed in the area prior to Khmer occupation.\"Saigon began as the Cham village of Baigaur, then became the Khmer Prey Nokor before being taken over by the Vietnamese and renamed Gia Dinh Thanh and then Saigon.\" However, this does not take into account that Kampuchea Krom (including Prey Nokor) existed since early history or at least Funan (Salkin et al., 1996); and the fact that between 10th-12th century, there were several clashes between Khmer Empire and Champa (mainly based along modern Central Vietnam). Beginning in the 1620s, Cambodian king Chey Chettha II (1618\u20131628) allowed the Vietnamese to settle in the area, and to set up a custom house at Prey Nokor, which they colloquially referred to as S\u00e0i G\u00f2n. The increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers which followed overwhelmed the kingdom\u2014weakened as it was due to war with Thailand\u2014and slowly Vietnamized the area. During the late 17th century, M\u1ea1c C\u1eedu, a Chinese anti-Qing general, began to expand Vietnamese and Chinese settlements deeper into Cambodian lands, and in 1691, Prey Nokor was occupied by the Vietnamese. ===Vietnamese period=== In 1698, the Nguy\u1ec5n lords of Hu\u1ebf sent Nguy\u1ec5n H\u1eefu C\u1ea3nh, a Vietnamese noble, to the area to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area.The first settlers, This act formally detached the Mekong Delta from Cambodia, placing the region firmly under Vietnamese administrative control. The Khmers were cut off from access to the South China Sea, and trade through the area was possible only with Vietnamese permission. During the T\u00e2y S\u01a1n wars and the subsequent Nguy\u1ec5n Dynasty, Vietnam's boundaries were pushed as far as the Cape C\u00e0 Mau. In 1802 Nguy\u1ec5n \u00c1nh crowned himself emperor Gia Long and unified all the territories comprising modern Vietnam, including the Mekong Delta. Upon the conclusion of the Cochinchina Campaign in the 1860s, the area became part of Cochinchina, France's first colony in Vietnam, and later, part of French Indochina. Beginning during the French colonial period, the French patrolled and fought on the waterways of the Mekong Delta region with their Divisions navales d'assaut (Dinassaut), a tactic which lasted throughout the First Indochina War, and was later employed by the US Navy Mobile Riverine Force. During the Vietnam War\u2014also referred to as the Second Indochina War\u2014the Delta region saw savage fighting between Viet Cong (NLF) guerrillas and the US 9th Infantry Division and units of the United States Navy's swift boats and hovercrafts (PACVs) plus the Army of the Republic of Vietnam 7th, 9th, and 21st Infantry Divisions. As a military region the Mekong Delta was encompassed by the IV Corps Tactical Zone (IV CTZ). In 1975, North Vietnamese soldiers and Viet Cong soldiers launched a massive invasion in many parts of South Vietnam. While I, II, and III Corps collapsed significantly, IV Corps was still highly intact due to under Major General Nguyen Khoa Nam overseeing strong military operations to prevent VC taking over any important regional districts. Brigadier General Le Van Hung, the head of 21st Division commander, stayed office in Can Tho to continue defending successfully against VC. When the South Vietnamese President Duong Van Minh ordered a surrender, both ARVN generals in Can Tho, General Le Van Hung and Nguyen Khoa Nam, committed suicide after deciding not to continue battle against the VC soldiers similar as siege of An Loc. In Binh Thuy Air Base, where the ARVN soldiers and number of aircraft defend on military operations, some ARVN soldiers and air base personnel who defended long-time at air base evacuated by helicopters to depart to presumably at Thailand shortly after hearing President Minh surrendered. Several jet fighters were flown out to Thailand from still- unoccupied Binh Thuy AB. Within hours after RVN ceased to exist, VC soldiers occupied Binh Thuy Air Base and captured number of ARVN soldiers and AB personnel who didn't escape by air or surrounded all around enemy VC soldiers. In My Tho, Brigadier General Tran Van Hai, who was in charged protecting National Highway 4 (now NH1A) from Saigon to Can Tho, committed suicide when President Minh ordered ARVN forces to surrendered. General Tran Van Hai is one of the three ARVN generals refused to be evacuated by American when the North Vietnamese soldiers invade Saigon. Several ARVN soldiers continued to fight resistance against VC in several places including few intact provincial capitals shortly after Minh's surrender that later either surrendered or disbanded at night or at least next day when remaining ARVN soldiers exhausted from counterattack. In the late 1970s, the Khmer Rouge regime attacked Vietnam in an attempt to reconquer the Delta region. This campaign precipitated the Vietnamese invasion of Cambodia and subsequent downfall of the Khmer Rouge. ==Geography== Mekong River Delta from space, February 1996. The Mekong Delta, as a region, lies immediately to the west of Ho Chi Minh City (also called Saigon by locals), roughly forming a triangle stretching from M\u1ef9 Tho in the east to Ch\u00e2u \u0110\u1ed1c and H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean in the northwest, down to C\u00e0 Mau at the southernmost tip of Vietnam, and including the island of Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c. The Mekong Delta region of Vietnam displays a variety of physical landscapes, but is dominated by flat flood plains in the south, with a few hills in the north and west. This diversity of terrain was largely the product of tectonic uplift and folding brought about by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates about 50 million years ago. The soil of the lower Delta consists mainly of sediment from the Mekong and its tributaries, deposited over thousands of years as the river changed its course due to the flatness of the low-lying terrain. The present Mekong Delta system has two major distributary channels, both discharging directly into the East Sea. The Holocene history of the Mekong Delta shows delta progradation of about 200 km during the last 6 kyr. During the Middle Holocene the Mekong River was discharging waters into both the East Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. The water entering the Gulf of Thailand was flowing via a palaeochannel located within the western part of the delta; north of the Camau Peninsula. Upper Pleistocene prodeltaic and delta front sediments interpreted as the deposits of the palaeo-Mekong River were reported from central basin of the Gulf of Thailand The Mekong Delta is the region with the smallest forest area in Vietnam. or 7.7% of the total area are forested as of 2011. The only provinces with large forests are C\u00e0 Mau Province and Ki\u00ean Giang Province, together accounting for two-thirds of the region's forest area, while forests cover less than 5% of the area of all of the other eight provinces and cities. === Coastal erosion === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! || colspan=\"6\"| Shoreline change (m/yr) |- |Zones || 1973 - 1979 || 1973 - 1979 || 1987- 1995 || 1987- 1995 || 1987- 1995 || 43-yr average |- | Zone-1 || 8.66|| 8.07||12.07 || 9.68 || 4.52 || 8.87 |- | Zone-2 || -10.32 || -8.00 || -12.22 || -13.15 ||-20.9 || -12.79 |- | Zone-3 ||28.15 || 23.33 || 27.55 || 19.48 || 11.83 || 21.53 |- | Zone-4|| 8.43 || 2.48 || 3.57 || -10.03 || -4.53 || -1.66 |- | All areas|| 7.77 || 6.11 || 7.84 || 2.75 || -1.42 || 4.36 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! || colspan=\"6\"| Area change (km2/yr) |- |Zones || 1973 - 1979 || 1973 - 1979 || 1987- 1995 || 1987- 1995 || 1987- 1995 || 43-yr average |- | Zone-1 || 1.94|| 2.01||2.96 || 2.25 || 1.15 || 2.12 |- | Zone-2 || -1.39 || -1.87 || -2.23 || -1.75 ||-1.71 || -1.71 |- | Zone-3 ||2.82 || 2.16 || 1.71 || 1.09 || 1.64 || 1.99 |- | Zone-4|| 0.95 || 0.35 || -0.53 || -0.56 || -1.13 || -0.18 |- | All areas|| 4.32 || 2.64 || 1.91 || 1.03 || -0.05 || 2.23 |} From 1973 to 2005, the Mekong Delta's seaward shoreline growth decreased gradually from a mean of 7.8 m/yr to 2.8 m/yr, and after 2005 it became negative, with a retreat rate of \u22121.4 m/yr. The net deltaic land area gain has also been slowing, with the mean rate decreasing from 4.3 km2/yr (1973\u20131979) to 1.0 km2 yr (1995\u20132005), and then to \u22120.05 km2/yr (2005\u20132015). Thus, in about 2005, the subaerial Mekong Delta transitioned from a constructive mode to an erosional (or destructive) mode. === Climate change concerns === Being a low-lying coastal region, the Mekong Delta is particularly susceptible to floods resulting from rises in sea level due to climate change. The Climate Change Research Institute at C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 University, in studying the possible consequences of climate change, has predicted that, besides suffering from drought brought on by seasonal decrease in rainfall, many provinces in the Mekong Delta will be flooded by the year 2030. The most serious cases are predicted to be the provinces of B\u1ebfn Tre and Long An, of which 51% and 49%, respectively, are expected to be flooded if sea level rise by .\"Mekong Delta: more flood and drought\". VietnamNet Bridge. March 19, 2009. Another problem caused by climate change is the increasing soil salinity near the coasts. B\u1ebfn Tre Province is planning to reforest coastal regions to counter this trend. The duration of inundation at an important road in the city of Can Tho is expected to continue to rise from the current total of 72 inundated days per year to 270 days by 2030 and 365 days by 2050. This is attributed to the combined influence of sea-level rise and land subsidence, which occurs at about annually. Several projects and initiatives on local, regional and state levels work to counter this trend and save the Mekong Delta. One programme for integrated coastal management, for instance, is supported by Germany and Australia. In August 2019, a Nature Communications study using an improved measure of elevation estimation, found that the delta was much lower than previous estimates, only a mean above sea level, with 75% of the delta\u2014an area where 12 million people currently live\u2014falling below . It is expected that a majority of the delta will be below sea level by 2050. ==Demographics== Mekong Delta The inhabitants of the Mekong Delta region are predominantly ethnic Viet. The region, formerly part of the Khmer Empire, is also home to the largest population of Khmers outside of the modern borders of Cambodia. The Khmer minority population live primarily in the Tr\u00e0 Vinh, S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng, and Muslim Ch\u0103m in Tan Chau, An Giang provinces. There are also sizeable Hoa (ethnic Chinese) populations in the Ki\u00ean Giang, and Tr\u00e0 Vinh provinces. The region had a population of 17.33 million people in 2011.General Statistics Office (2012): Statistical Yearbook of Vietnam 2011. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi The population of the Mekong Delta has been growing relatively slowly in recent years, mainly due to out-migration. The region's population only increased by 471,600 people between 2005 and 2011, while 166,400 people migrated out in 2011 alone. Together with the central coast regions, it has one of the slowest growing populations in country. Population growth rates have been between 0.3% and 0.5% between 2008 and 2011, while they have been over 2% in the neighbouring southeastern region. Net migration has been negative in all of these years. The region also has a relatively low fertility rate, at 1.8 children per woman in 2010 and 2011, down from 2.0 in 2005. ===Provinces=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! rowspan=\"2\"|Province- Level Division ! rowspan=\"2\"|Capital ! colspan=\"2\"|Area ! rowspan=\"2\"|Population (2019) ! colspan=\"2\"|Population density |- !(km2) !(mile\u00b2) !(persons/km2) !(persons/mile\u00b2) |- | An Giang | Long Xuy\u00ean | | align=\"right\"|2,412,569 | |- | B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau | B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau | | align=\"right\"| | |- | B\u1ebfn Tre | B\u1ebfn Tre | | align=\"right\"| | |- | C\u00e0 Mau | C\u00e0 Mau | | align=\"right\"| | |- | \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p | Cao L\u00e3nh | | align=\"right\"| | |- | H\u1eadu Giang | V\u1ecb Thanh | | align=\"right\"| | |- | Ki\u00ean Giang | R\u1ea1ch Gi\u00e1 | | align=\"right\"| | |- | Long An | T\u00e2n An | | align=\"right\"| | |- | S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng | S\u00f3c Tr\u0103ng | | align=\"right\"| | |- | Ti\u1ec1n Giang | M\u1ef9 Tho | | align=\"right\"| | |- | Tr\u00e0 Vinh | Tr\u00e0 Vinh | | align=\"right\"| | |- | V\u0129nh Long | V\u0129nh Long | | align=\"right\"| | |- | colspan=2|C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 (municipality) | | align=\"right\"| | |- |} ==Economy== Floating market of C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 The Mekong Delta is by far Vietnam's most productive region in agriculture and aquaculture, while its role in industry and foreign direct investment is much smaller. ===Agriculture=== 2.6 million ha in the Mekong Delta are used for agriculture, which is one fourth of Vietnam's total. Due to its mostly flat terrain and few forested areas (except for C\u00e0 Mau Province), almost two-thirds (64.5%) of the region's land can be used for agriculture. The share of agricultural land exceeds 80% in C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 and neighbouring H\u1eadu Giang Province and is below 50% only in C\u00e0 Mau Province (32%) and B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province (42%). The region's land used for growing cereals makes up 47% of the national total, more than northern and central Vietnam combined. Most of this is used for rice cultivation. Rice output in 2011 was 23,186,000t, 54.8% of Vietnam's total output. The strongest producers are Ki\u00ean Giang Province, An Giang Province, and \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p Province, producing over 3 million tonnes each and almost 11 million tonnes together. Any two of these provinces produce more than the entire Red River Delta. Only three provinces produce less than 1 million tonnes of rice (B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau Province, C\u00e0 Mau Province, B\u1ebfn Tre Province). ===Fishery=== The Mekong Delta is also Vietnam's most important fishing region. It has almost half of Vietnam's capacity of offshore fishing vessels (mostly in Kien Gian with almost 1/4, B\u1ebfn Tre, C\u00e0 Mau, Ti\u1ec1n Giang, B\u1ea1c Li\u00eau). Fishery output was at 3.168 million tons (58.3% of Vietnam) and has experienced rapid growth from 1.84mt in 2005. All of Vietnam's largest fishery producers with over 300kt of output are in the Mekong Delta: Ki\u00ean Giang, C\u00e0 Mau, \u0110\u1ed3ng Th\u00e1p, An Giang, and B\u1ebfn Tre. Despite the region's large offshore fishing fleet, 2/3 (2.13 million tonnes out of Vietnam's total of 2.93) of fishery output actually comes from aquaculture. December 2015, aquaculture production was estimated at 357 thousand tons, up 11% compared to the same period last year, bringing the total aquaculture production 3516 thousand tons in 2015, up 3.0% compared to the same period. Although aquaculture production has increased overall, aquaculture still faces many difficulties coming from export markets. ===Industry and FDI=== The Mekong Delta is not strongly industrialized, but is still the third out of seven regions in terms of industrial gross output. The region's industry accounts for 10% of Vietnam's total as of 2011. Almost half of the region's industrial production is concentrated in C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1, Long An Province and C\u00e0 Mau Province. C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 is the economic center of the region and more industrialized than the other provinces. Long An has been the only province of the region to attract part of the manufacturing booming around Ho Chi Minh City and is seen by other provinces as an example of successful FDI attraction. C\u00e0 Mau Province is home to a large industrial zone including power plants and a fertiliser factory. Accumulated foreign direct investment in the Mekong Delta until 2011 was $10.257bn. It has been highly concentrated in a few provinces, led by Long An and Ki\u00ean Giang with over $3bn each, Ti\u1ec1n Giang and C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 (around 850m), C\u00e0 Mau (780m) and H\u1eadu Giang (673m), while the other provinces have received less than 200m each. In general, the performance of the region in attracting FDI is evaluated as unsatisfactory by local analysts and policymakers. Companies from Ho Chi Minh City have also invested heavily in the region. Their investment from 2000 to June 2011 accounted for 199 trillion VND (almost $10bn). ==Infrastructure== The construction of the C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 Bridge, a cable- stayed bridge over the largest distributary of the Mekong River, was completed on April 12, 2010, three years after a collapse that killed 54 and injured nearly 100 workers. The bridge replaces the ferry system that currently runs along National Route 1A, and links V\u0129nh Long Province and C\u1ea7n Th\u01a1 city. The cost of construction is estimated to be 4.842 trillion Vietnamese \u0111\u1ed3ng (approximately 342.6 million United States dollars), making it the most expensive bridge in Vietnam. ==Culture== Life in the Mekong Delta revolves much around the river, and many of the villages are often accessible by rivers and canals rather than by road. The region is home to c\u1ea3i l\u01b0\u01a1ng, a form of Kinh/Vietnamese folk opera. Cai Luong Singing appeared in Mekong Delta in the early 20th century. Cai Luong Singing is often performed in the soundtrack of guitar and zither. Cai Luong is a kind of play telling a story. A sort of play often includes two main parts: the dialogue part and the singing part to express their thoughts and emotions. ===Cuisine=== ===Literature and movies=== Nguy\u1ec5n Ng\u1ecdc T\u01b0, an author from C\u00e0 Mau Province, has written many popular books about life in the Mekong Delta such as: * Ng\u1ecdn \u0111\u00e8n kh\u00f4ng t\u1eaft (The Inextinguishable Light, 2000) * \u00d4ng ngo\u1ea1i (Grandpa, 2001) * Bi\u1ec3n ng\u01b0\u1eddi m\u00eanh m\u00f4ng (The Ocean of People, 2003) * Giao th\u1eeba (New Year's Eve, 2003) * N\u01b0\u1edbc ch\u1ea3y m\u00e2y tr\u00f4i (Flowing Waters, Flying Clouds, 2004) * C\u00e1nh \u0111\u1ed3ng b\u1ea5t t\u1eadn (The Endless Field, 2005) The 2004 film The Buffalo Boy is set in C\u00e0 Mau Province. In The Simpsons, Principal Skinner was on recon in the steaming Mekong Delta in 1968. He was captured, and lived in a POW camp for 3 years, forced to subsist on a thin stew made of fish, vegetables, prawns, coconut milk, and four kinds of rice. ==See also== * Greater Mekong Sub-region Academic and Research Network * GMS Environment Operations Center * Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance == Notes == == References == ==Further reading== * Renaud, F.
