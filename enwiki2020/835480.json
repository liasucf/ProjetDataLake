    "text": "Olu Dara Jones (born Charles Jones III, January 12, 1941) is an American cornetist, guitarist, and singer. He is the father of rapper Nas. ==Career== Olu Dara was born Charles Jones III January 12, 1941, in Natchez, Mississippi. In 1963, he moved to New York City and changed his name to Olu Dara, which means \"God is good\" in the Yoruba language. In the 1970s and '80s he played alongside David Murray, Henry Threadgill, Hamiet Bluiett, Don Pullen, Charles Brackeen, James Blood Ulmer, and Cassandra Wilson. He formed two bands, the Okra Orchestra and the Natchezsippi Dance Band. His first album, In the World: From Natchez to New York (1998), revealed another aspect of his musical personality: the leader and singer of a band immersed in African-American tradition, playing an eclectic mix of blues, jazz, and storytelling, with tinges of funk, African popular music, and reggae. His second album Neighborhoods, with guest appearances by Dr. John and Cassandra Wilson, followed in a similar vein. Dara played on the album Illmatic (1994) by his son, rapper Nas, and on the song \"Dance\" (2002), also by Nas, and he sang on Nas's song \"Bridging the Gap\" (2004). ==Discography== ===As leader=== * In the World: From Natchez to New York (Atlantic, 1998) * Neighborhoods (Atlantic, 2001) With Material * Memory Serves (1981) * The Third Power (1991) ===As sideman=== With Charles Brackeen * 1987 Attainment (Silkheart) * 1987 Worshippers Come Nigh (Silkheart) With Rhys Chatham * 1984 Factor X * 1987 Die Donnerg\u00f6tter (The Thundergods) With Carlos Garnett * 1975 Let This Melody Ring On (Muse) * 1977 Fire With Corey Harris * 2002 Downhome Sophisticate * 2005 Daily Bread With Craig Harris * 1985 Tributes (OTC) * 1999 Cold Sweat Plays J.
