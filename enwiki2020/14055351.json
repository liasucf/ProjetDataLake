In an allusion to The Sword in the Stone, Geo is able to pull the sword from the ground, awaken, and take control the Thunder Zerker form to defeat Rogue.

Joined by Lyra Note, the two pursue the UMA across the city, but cannot attack because Dark Phantom uses Hope as a shield. After cruelly taunting Geo with his mother's life, Dark Phantom scores a decisive victory against him and Lyra Note, but before he can finish them off a revived Yeti Blizzard intervenes. The two decide to rush the greatly weakened Mega Man, but he is saved by an unlikely savior: Hollow. |- | colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"| |- | align=\"center\" | 18 | | align=\"center\" | March 8, 2008 |- | colspan=\"5\" | Vega arrives and orders Hollow to retrieve the two OOParts. Yeti Blizzard and Dark Phantom are no match for Hollow's speed and electric attacks, and are swiftly defeated and stripped of their OOParts, leaving them in their human forms. With two of the three OOParts in her possession, Vega's demeanor changes, and she reveals to Geo her plan to use the three OOParts to revive the being Le Mu in order to create a new world. Geo resolves to stop her, and activates Thunder Zerker in order to battle Hollow. |- | colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"| |- | align=\"center\" | 19 | | align=\"center\" | March 15, 2008 |- | colspan=\"5\" | Hollow quickly proves to be Geo's toughest opponent yet. His attacks are blinding fast and no matter how many times Geo lands a blow, Hollow shows no signs of damage. Aaron and the Satella Police soon arrive on scene, and Aaron and Tom locate the source of Hollow's unstoppable power, a device located within Vega's car. After Copper destroys it with his signal jammer, Geo finally manages to harm Hollow, but Vega uses the two OOParts in her possession to heal him. With the three artifacts in such close proximity, a portal to Mu appears in the sky. |- | colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"| |- | align=\"center\" | 20 | | align=\"center\" | March 22, 2008 |- | colspan=\"5\" | Mega Man is pulled into the portal to Mu, and is followed by Hollow, Lyra Note, as well as Yeti Blizzard and Dark Phantom, Vega, and Copper. Hollow finally overwhelms Geo and pulls the Sword of Zerker out of Omega-Xis and presents it to Vega, who has by now convinced Dark Phantom and Yeti Blizzard to help her in exchange for immortality. Geo is joined by Sonia and the two discover and awaken a comatose Solo (Rogue's human identity), who weakly explains how he is the last inhabitant of Mu and protects the seal on Le Mu. Though greatly weakened, he transforms into his wave form and goes off to confront Vega. |- | colspan=\"5\" bgcolor=\"#CCCCFF\"| |- | align=\"center\" | 21 | | align=\"center\" | March 29, 2008 |- | colspan=\"5\" | Vega revives Le Mu using the OOParts while Lyra Note confronts Dark Phantom and Yeti Blizzard. Rogue takes on Hollow and holds him off for a while. Geo sees that Omega-Xis is being smothered in a pool of dangerous substance. He then jumps down to save him and rises back up in his EM form. Copper shouts out to Mega Man to grab the OOParts before Le Mu comes to life. He grabs them all and Mega Man transforms into the ultimate amalgamation of all three OOParts: Tribe King. Using this new power, Mega Man destroys Hollow, but Vega escapes arrest. As everyone escapes Mu, Rogue appears and uses what's left of his energy, with the help of Tribe King Mega Man, to seal Le Mu and close the portal to Mu with Vega still inside. With disaster averted, life goes back to normal for Geo and his friends. |- |} ==Notes and references== ==See also== * List of Mega Man Star Force episodes * Mega Man Star Force (anime) * Mega Man Star Force (video game) ==External links== * Capcom's Shooting Star Rockman game series splash page * Shogakukan's Shooting Star Rockman Tribe anime page * TV Tokyo's Shooting Star Rockman Tribe anime page * XEBEC's Shooting Star Rockman Tribe anime page Category:2007 Japanese television seasons Category:2008 Japanese television seasons Tribe Category:Television articles with incorrect naming style ",
