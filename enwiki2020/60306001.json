Following her graduation Allison worked in illustration and graphic design in Wellington and in London. In 1988 Allison returned from Europe and started Moa Revival, a stationery company producing products with a notable emphasis on Kiwiana. In the late 1990s a cartoon about a single woman living alone began to take shape; by 2000 this hobby had gained enough attention to demand an audience of its own. The cartoon character was Cecily. == Career == After graduating from Wellington Polytechnic, she worked \"in illustration and graphic design in Wellington and in London\". Since the late 1990s, Allison has been drawing the cartoon character of Cecily. She was inspired to create Cecily as a \"representation of womanhood in New Zealand cartooning, which we didn\u2019t have\". Cecily first appeared in Next magazine, and has since appeared on a range of merchandise. From 2017, Cecily was syndicated in the American satirical magazine Funny Times. She also creates the stationery range Moa Revival, and was a contributor to Three Words: An Anthology of Aotearoa/NZ Women's Comics. == References == Category:1958 births Category:Living people Category:New Zealand illustrators Category:New Zealand women illustrators Category:New Zealand female comics artists ",
