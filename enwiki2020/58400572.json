Because of the restrictions placed on her, she runs away from home and finds shelter in the nearby home of John Carmen, a wealthy young bachelor. The only way out of the social difficulty that occurs to John is for them to get married. This they do and they live in his town house. Soon they begin to drift apart, she becoming infatuated with Harrison Thomby, a man about town, and a break finally comes when they meet at a cabaret. John goes to his county home and, in a mix up of taxi cabs, takes a chorus girl home with him. Alice arrives on the scene and refuses to listen to his explanations. She accepts an invitation from her friend and, while accompanying him to a dance, their taxi is wrecked and she is badly hurt. While unconscious, she dreams of being trapped on Harrison's yacht, and wakes to find herself in her husband's arms. ==Cast== * Elaine Hammerstein as Alice Schuyler * Niles Welch as John Carmen * Myrtle Stedman as Mrs. Schuyler-Foster * Robert Lee Keeling as Mr. Schuyler-Foster * Huntley Gordon as Harrison Thomby * Louise Prussing as Mrs. Dahlgren * Frank Currier as Cumberland Whipple * Kate Cherry as Martha Whipple * Constance Bennett as Chorus Girl ==References== ==Bibliography== * Munden, Kenneth White.
