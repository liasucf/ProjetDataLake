She makes paintings, collages, and sculptures that examine women's sexuality, queerness, gender and heteronormativity, often using humor. In 2014 Barbara Rapp has been selected by the curatorium of the Fashion Art Institute Barcelona (Designer Manuel Fernandez) to represent Austria for \"Fashion Art EU\" at the European Parliament Brussels 2015theneweuropean.eu FASHION ART EU at the Parliamentarium in Brussels 15. January 2015 and European Museum of Modern Art MEAM Barcelona 2016.Fashion Art EU MEAM Barcelona June/July 2016 For Barbara Rapp fashion does not only bear a social responsibility but also reflects the current socio-cultural developments. After receiving the white dress in folkloristic \u201edirndl-style\u201c from the fashion art institute it was immediately clear for her that she has to withdraw its automated categorization. Her general artistic focus is on the critical questioning of gender role models. Accordingly she tried to create the artistic design of her dress called \u201eTrapp 3.0\u201c not only by contemporary re-engineering the traditional mapping of folklore but also to encourage new perspectives on female and male forms of appearance.Catalogue Fashion Art EU released 2014 ==References== Category:Austrian contemporary artists Category:Mixed-media artists Category:Multimedia artists Category:Women multimedia artists Category:Living people Category:1972 births Category:Austrian women artists Category:21st-century Austrian painters Category:21st-century women artists ",
