A professional competitor since 2014, he was the former Thunderstrike Fight League Light heavyweight champion in Poland. He currently competes in the Light heavyweight division of the Ultimate Fighting Championship. ==Mixed martial arts career== ===Early career=== Oleksiejczuk started his MMA career in 2014. Fighting primarily in Poland, he amassed a record of 12\u20132 prior to being signed by UFC in 2017. ===Ultimate Fighting Championship=== Oleksiejczuk was expected to have made his UFC debut to face Ion Cu\u021belaba on November 4, 2017 at UFC 217, replacing injured Gadzhimurad Antigulov. In turn after the weigh-ins, Cu\u021belaba was pulled from the event by USADA due to a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation stemming from its investigation into voluntary disclosures by Cu\u021belaba during an out-of-competition sample collections on October 18 and October 19. Cu\u021belaba was provisionally suspended and the bout was scrapped. Oleksiejczuk's UFC debut was finally set on December 30, 2017, facing Khalil Rountree Jr. and replacing injured G\u00f6khan Saki, at UFC 219. However, after the fight, it was revealed that Oleksiejczuk had tested positive for clomiphene, an anti-estrogenic substance. As a result, the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC) officially overturned the result of the fight to a no contest and Oleksiejczuk received one year suspension by USADA. Oleksiejczuk returned to octagon one year later to face Gian Villante on February 23, 2019, at UFC Fight Night: B\u0142achowicz vs. Santos. He won the fight via TKO due to a body punch early in the first round. This win earned him the Performance of the Night award. Oleksiejczuk faced Gadzhimurad Antigulov on April 20, 2019, replacing Roman Dolidze, at UFC Fight Night: Overeem vs. Oleinik. Oleksiejczuk won the fight via knockout in the first round. Oleksiejczuk faced Ovince Saint Preux on September 28, 2019 at UFC on ESPN+ 18. He lost the fight via submission due to a Von Flue choke in the second round. Oleksiejczuk faced Jimmy Crute on February 23, 2020 at UFC Fight Night 168.
