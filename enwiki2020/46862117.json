    "text": "The South Surrey Park and Ride is a major bus loop and park and ride facility for the South Surrey area. As part of the TransLink system, it is home to five routes serving White Rock and South Surrey with routes to Vancouver via Richmond (Bridgeport Station) as well as routes to Surrey Central and Newton in the northern part of the city. The first South Surrey Park and Ride opened on May 8, 1991, located at 152 Street and Cranley Drive (now Mall Access for Southpoint Exchange). On December 13, 1999, the park and ride was relocated so that the Southpoint Exchange mall could be constructed. The second site was located at 32 Avenue and 32 Avenue Diversion, a short distance from the original site. The current park and ride facility was opened on June 26, 2006, adjacent to the Highway 99 and King George Boulevard interchange. In November 2013, an expansion of 367 parking spots was opened, and a $2-per-day parking fee was introduced. ==Routes== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Bay !Route !Destination !Notes |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |1 |351 |White Rock Centre | |- |352 |Ocean Park |Weekday PM peak hours only |- |354 |White Rock South |Weekday PM peak hours only |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |2 |321 | | |- |394 |White Rock Centre |Weekday peak hours only |- ! rowspan=\"3\" |3 |351 |Bridgeport Station | |- |352 |Bridgeport Station |Weekday AM peak hours only |- |354 |Bridgeport Station |Weekday AM peak hours only |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |4 |321 |Surrey Central Station | |- |394 |King George Station |Weekday peak hours only |} ==See also== *List of bus routes in Metro Vancouver ==References== ==External links== *South Surrey Park and Ride map (PDF file) Category:TransLink (British Columbia) bus stations Category:White Rock, British Columbia Category:Surrey, British Columbia ",
