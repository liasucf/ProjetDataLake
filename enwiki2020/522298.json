Kennedy claims that the only reason the oil industry is able to remain competitive against renewables and electric cars is through massive direct and indirect subsidies and political interventions on behalf of the oil industry. In a June 2017 interview on EnviroNews, Kennedy said about the oil industry, \"That's what their strategy is: build as many miles of pipeline as possible. And what the industry is trying to do is to increase that level of infrastructure investment so our country won't be able to walk away from it.Zukowski, Dan (June 26, 2017). \"Robert F.

Taking the side of Cape Cod's commercial fishing industry, Kennedy argued that the Cape Wind Project in Nantucket Sound was a costly boondoggle. This position angered some environmentalists, and brought Kennedy criticism by industry groups and Republicans. Kennedy argued in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal that \"Vermont wants to take its nuclear plant off line and replace it with clean, green power from HydroQu\u00e9bec\u2014power available to Massachusetts utilities\u2014at a cost of six cents per kilowatt hour (kwh).

Bush, Kennedy was a persistent critic of Bush's environmental and energy policies. He accused Bush of defunding and corrupting federal science projects.Griscom, Amanda (October/November 2004). \"Environmental Justice\". Mother Earth News. Kennedy was also critical of Bush's 2003 hydrogen car initiative, noting that it was a gift to the fossil fuel industry disguised as a green automobile. In 2003, Kennedy wrote an article in Rolling Stone about Bush's environmental record, which he subsequently expanded into a New York Times bestselling book.Kennedy, Jr., Robert F. (2004). Crimes Against Nature: How George W. Bush and His Corporate Pals Are Plundering the Country and Hijacking Our Democracy. HarperCollins. . His opposition to the environmental policies of the Bush administration earned him recognition as one of Rolling Stone \"100 Agents of Change\" on April 2, 2009. During an October 2012 interview with Politico, Kennedy called on environmentalists to direct their dissatisfaction towards the U.S. Congress rather than President Barack Obama, reasoning that Obama \"didn't deliver\" due to having a partisan U.S. Congress \"like we haven't seen before in American history\".Dixon, Darius (October 12, 2012). \"RFK Jr. to greens: Not Obama's fault\".

(June 6, 2017). Foreword for The Peanut Allergy Epidemic: What's Causing It And How To Stop It. Third Edition. by Heather Fraser, New York: Skyhorse Publishing. . === Views on autism and vaccines === Kennedy is the chairman of Children's Health Defense (formerly the World Mercury Project), an advocacy group alleging that a large proportion of American children are suffering from conditions as diverse as autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, food allergies, cancer, and autoimmune diseases due to exposure to certain chemicals and radiation. The Children's Health Defense has blamed and campaigned against vaccines, fluoridation of drinking water, paracetamol (acetaminophen), aluminum, wireless communications, and others. Kennedy's group has been identified as one of two major buyers of anti-vaccine Facebook advertising in late 2018 and early 2019. In its early years, the group focused on the perceived issue of mercury in industry and medicine, especially the ethylmercury compound thimerosal in vaccines, proposed by the discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield as a mechanism for the disproved link between vaccines and autism. Despite Kennedy's claims that he is in fact not against vaccines, critics have said Kennedy and his organization spread common anti-vaccine arguments as part of their core messages. Kennedy has stated the media and governments are engaged in a conspiracy to deny that vaccines cause autism. In June 2005, Kennedy authored an article in Rolling Stone and Salon called \"Deadly Immunity\", alleging a government conspiracy to conceal a connection between thimerosal and the epidemic of childhood neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism. The article contained five factual errors, leading Salon to issue corrections.Lauerman, Kerry (January 16, 2011). \"Correcting our Record\". Salon. Six years later, on January 16, 2011, Salon retracted the article completely. According to Salon, the retraction was motivated by accumulating evidence of alleged errors and scientific fraud underlying the vaccine-autism claim.Oransky, Ivan (January 16, 2011) \"Salon retracts 2005 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. piece on alleged autism-vaccine link\". Retraction Watch. A corrected version of the original article can still be found on the Rolling Stone website. In May 2013, Kennedy delivered the keynote address at the vaccination information AutismOne / Generation Rescue conference. In 2014, Kennedy published a book, Thimerosal: Let the Science Speak: The Evidence Supporting the Immediate Removal of Mercury\u2014a Known Neurotoxin\u2014from Vaccines. While methylmercury is a potent neurotoxin, ethylmercury, as used in vaccine preservatives, is safer. The preface to the book is written by Mark Hyman, a proponent of the alternative medical treatment called functional medicine. Kennedy has published many articles on the inclusion of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal in vaccines, which have appeared in Huffington Post,Kennedy Jr., Robert F.

On January 10, 2017, incoming White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed that Kennedy and President-elect Donald Trump met to discuss a position in the Trump administration. Kennedy accepted an offer made by Trump to become the chairman of the Vaccine Safety Task Force. A spokeswoman for Trump's transition said that no final decision had been made. In an August 2017 interview with STAT News reporter Helen Branwell, Kennedy said that he had been meeting with the federal public health regulators to discuss defects in vaccine safety science, at the White House's request.\"An interview with Robert Kennedy Jr. on vaccines\". Interviewed by Helen Branswell. August 21, 2017. World Mercury Project. On February 15, 2017, Kennedy and actor Robert De Niro gave a press conference at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., in which they accused the press of acting as propagandists for the $35 billion vaccination industry and refusing to allow debates on vaccination science. They offered a $100,000 reward to any journalist or other citizen who could point to a study showing that it is safe to inject mercury into babies and pregnant women at levels currently contained in flu vaccines. Craig Foster, a psychology professor who studies pseudoscience, deemed the challenge \"not science\", noting that it was a \"carefully constructed 'contest' that allows its creators to generate the misleading outcome they presumably want to see\". He also stated that \"Proving that something is safe is importantly different than proving that something is harmful\". On May 8, 2019, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Joseph P. Kennedy and Maeve Kennedy McKean wrote an open letter stating that while their relative has championed many admirable causes, he \"has helped to spread dangerous misinformation over social media and is complicit in sowing distrust of the science behind vaccines\". On June 4, 2019, during a visit to Samoa coinciding with that nation's 57th independence celebration, Kennedy appeared in an Instagram photo with Australian-Samoan anti-vaccine activist Taylor Winterstein. Kennedy's charity and Winterstein have both perpetuated the lie that the MMR vaccine played a role in the 2018 deaths of two Samoan infants, despite the subsequent revelation that the infants had received a muscle relaxant along with the vaccine by mistake. Kennedy has drawn criticism for fueling vaccine hesitancy amid a social climate which gave rise to the 2019 Samoa measles outbreak, which killed over 70 people, and the 2019 Tonga measles outbreak. Kennedy is listed as executive producer of Vaxxed II: The People's Truth, the 2019 sequel to Andrew Wakefield's and Del Bigtree's anti- vaccination documentary Vaxxed. === Promotion of COVID-19 conspiracy theories === Kennedy wrote the foreword for Plague of Corruption, a book by controversial former research scientist and anti-vaccine conspiracy theorist Judy Mikovits, published in 2020. MIT Technology Review reported that financial YouTuber Patrick Bet-David was monetizing video interviews with anti-vaccine activists including Mikovits and Kennedy, with the latter's segment titled \u201cRobert Kennedy Jr. Destroys Big Pharma, Fauci & Pro-Vaccine Movement\u201d. As the COVID-19 pandemic rages, Kennedy continues to tout a number of conspiracy theories related to COVID-19 including attacking both Anthony Fauci and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation for supposedly trying to profit off a vaccine. In August 2020, Kennedy appeared in an hour-long interview with Alec Baldwin on Instagram, where he touted a number of incorrect and misleading claims about vaccines and public health measures related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Baldwin was criticized by public health officials and scientists for allowing Kennedy's proclamations to go unchallenged. Kennedy also appeared as a speaker at the partially violent demonstration in Berlin on August 29, 2020, where populist groups called for an end to anti- Corona restrictions.RBB: \"Proteste in Berlin Fast 40.000 Menschen bei Corona- Demos - Sperren am Reichstag durchbrochen\" (in German). August 29, 2020, accessed September 1, 2020. ===Views on the murder of Martha Moxley=== In January 2003, Kennedy wrote a controversial article in The Atlantic Monthly about the 1975 murder of Martha Moxley in Greenwich, Connecticut, in which he insists that Michael Skakel's indictment \"was triggered by an inflamed media, and that an innocent man is now in prison\". Skakel and Kennedy are first cousins, as Kennedy's mother and Skakel's father are siblings. The article argues that there is more evidence suggesting that Kenneth Littleton, the Skakel family's live-in tutor, killed Moxley. He also calls Dominick Dunne the \"driving force\" behind Skakel's prosecution. In July 2016, Kennedy released a book titled Framed: Why Michael Skakel Spent over a Decade in Prison for a Murder He Didn't Commit. In September 2017, the rights to Kennedy's book were optioned by FX Productions to develop a multi-part television series.Schneider, Michael (September 20, 2017). \"FX Prods.

Kennedy was \"fairly convinced\" that others besides Oswald were involved in his brother's assassination and privately believed the Warren Commission report was a \"shoddy piece of craftsmanship\". In an extended commentary on JFK's presidency on the 50th anniversary of his death, Kennedy referenced only one book, JFK and the Unspeakable.

In 2005, Kennedy considered running for New York Attorney General, which would have meant a possible run against his then brother-in-law Andrew Cuomo, but in the end he decided against entering the race, even though he had been considered the frontrunner. On December 2, 2008, Kennedy announced that he did not wish to be appointed to the U.S. Senate by New York Governor David Paterson. He felt that it would take too much time away from his family. ==Personal life== === General interests === Kennedy is a licensed master falconer and has trained hawks since he was 11.
