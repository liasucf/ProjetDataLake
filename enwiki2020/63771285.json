    "text": "Megaviricetes is a class of viruses. The class contains the so-called giant viruses, particularly the giant viruses of Nucleocytoviricota, the nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. Members of Megaviricetes are known for typically being much larger than other viruses in two aspects. Firstly, their genomes are much larger than the typical virus, encoding many genes involved in DNA repair, DNA replication, transcription, translation, and other processes that most viruses usually lack. Secondly, members of Megaviricetes are physically much larger in size than the typical virus, sometimes exceeding the size of typical bacteria. ==Orders== The following orders are recognized: * Algavirales * Imitervirales * Pimascovirales ==References== Category:Viruses ",
