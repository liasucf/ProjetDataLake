The business was launched initially by the UK government in 2012 as the first institution of its type in the world. The organisation was acquired by the diversified financial group Macquarie Group Limited in 2017, creating one of Europe's largest teams of dedicated green infrastructure investors, and now operates under the name Green Investment Group. It is structured as a public limited company and is owned by the Macquarie Group. It has offices in London and Edinburgh.\"UK to base Green Investment Bank in Edinburgh, London\" Reuters, 8 March 2012 ==History== ===Origins=== As a result of the Climate Change Act 2008, the United Kingdom became legally committed to significantly reducing its carbon emissions by 2050. More importantly, the Act committed the UK to generating a significantly higher percentage of its energy from renewable sources by 2020.\"Government figures show Britain will fail to meet its Kyoto obligations\" The Independent, 18 February 2006 A non-partisan, House of Commons committee on climate change was established to study and recommend ways of meeting the country's obligations. The committee reported that for a new, low-carbon business and government infrastructure to be established, the necessary investment would range between \u00a3200 billion and \u00a31 trillion over the next two decades.Green Investment Bank, Environmental Audit Committee, House of Commons, UK, 2011 The committee further stated that since traditional sources of capital for investment in green infrastructure could not provide even half that amount by 2025, there would be a funding gap that needed to be covered by the state budget. In 2009, two reports were published advocating the creation of a state-backed infrastructure bank to provide financing to green projects. The first, entitled \"Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank\" was published in March 2009 by Climate Change Capital and E3G.\"Accelerating Green Infrastructure Financing: Outline proposals for UK green bonds and infrastructure bank\", Climate Change Capital, UK, 2009 The second, entitled \"Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain\" was published by Policy Exchange in September 2009 and was written by Dieter Helm, James Wardlaw and Ben Caldecott.\"Delivering a 21st Century Infrastructure for Britain\" , Policy Exchange, UK, 2009 These proposals were then contained in the manifestos of each of the main political parties for the 2010 UK General Election. The Fiscal year 2010 British government budget contained the first mention of a \"green investment bank\" scheme, earmarked with \u00a32 billion. Chancellor Alistair Darling stated that the Labour government was committed \"to support offshore wind energy\" and other forms of alternative energy, which he also billed as \"crucial to guiding the country out of recession\".\"Budget 2010: Chancellor announces green investment bank\" The Guardian, 24 March 2010 After the 2010 general election, the newly formed Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government defined its primary economic objective to be the drastic reduction of Britain's debt and yearly deficits.\"British coalition stresses need for cuts\" EuroNews, 13 May 2010 Accordingly, the government sought to create a financing scheme for the environmental investment needs of the country that would be funded mainly by the private sector, including the banks. In June 2010 the Green Investment Bank Commission, established by George Osborne in opposition, after holding hearings recommended that the government created an eponymous banking entity within the year. Chancellor George Osborne remained sceptical after objections to the creation of such a bank were raised by the Treasury, since a Green Investment Bank would \"swell the state deficit\" as it would appear as a liability on the government's balance sheet.\"Green investment bank 'must operate commercially'\" The Guardian, 11 March 2011 The UK government's Spending Review of October 2010 that announced a raft of austerity measures to deal with the UK government deficit, also included an announcement about the creation of a Green Investment Bank. The government expected to obtain by early 2013 the European Commission's approval for state aid to the Bank, with investment in green projects estimated to begin by April 2012.\"Resource security\", Speech by Vince Cable, BIS Secretary, 12 December 2011 ===Criticism=== The plans for the environmental funding scheme were endorsed by Greenpeace, whose executive director urged the prime minister to \"get personally involved\", as well as by a number of similar organisations,Letter to the editor of The Guardian, 1 March 2009 such as Transform UK, whose director stated that \"the only cost the Treasury should consider is the cost of failure to unleash this institution's massive potential to re-power our economy.\" Environmentalists engaged in public demonstrations demanding a quicker implementation of the plans.\"Greenpeace activists scale Treasury building in green bank protest\"The Guardian, 19 October 2010 However, non-government organisations and environmentalists criticised the scheme because it lacked ambition. The World Development Movement disputed that such a small scheme will attract the kind of investment needed to \"generate green jobs, green industry and a green economy in the UK\".Press release WDM, 20 October 2010 An economic study commissioned by WDM and Platform recommended that, instead of creating a new \"banking scheme\", the government should \"transform the [already] owned Royal Bank of Scotland into a powerful green investment bank\", in the process also \"creating 50,000 green jobs\".\"Bank for the future\" by James Leaton, with additional research by Howard Reed, 2010 In May 2011, a former adviser to the government, Jonathon Porritt, who had been head of the Sustainable Development Commission, publicly criticised the Coalition's scrapping of a planned rise in aviation tax, its watering down of schemes that promote small-scale renewable electricity and its failure to promote a \"green investment bank\" with immediate borrowing powers. Mr Porritt claimed he examined 75 policies on which the government had committed itself, finding little or no progress in 55. The government responded that it remains \"committed to the environment\", but claimed that the economic recession had affected environmental policies.\"PM's pledge of greenest government 'vanishingly remote'\" BBC News, 7 May 2011 The leader of the Green Party of England and Wales (and MP for Brighton Pavilion) Caroline Lucas, criticised the nomenclature of the GIB in January 2011, when she wrote that \"It's a bit rich to call [the GIB] a green investment bank if it can neither borrow nor lend\". Lucas argued that without these powers, \"it would be a fund \u2013 that is, a pot of money that, once used up, is gone forever.\".\"The green investment bank: neither particularly green, nor a bank\" The Guardian, 27 January 2011 Criticism also centred on the location of the institution. Bloomberg claimed that \"Most of the 50- 70 jobs will initially be in London...\"\"Green Bank Will Have Base in Edinburgh, Jobs in London\" Bloomberg, 8 March 2012 and some questioned that the decision to locate many jobs in London, despite the announcement headline of Edinburgh being chosen as winner of the location contest, pointed to a \"bid to defuse Scottish independence... a blatant move to unite the capitals over Alex Salmond's key policy.\"\"Green Investment Bank bid to defuse Scottish independence\" The Telegraph, 8 March 2012 ===Creation=== On 23 May 2011, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg at a speech at Climate Change Capital stated that the Green Investment Bank \"will begin operating in April 2012\", adding that the bank's early targets would be \"offshore wind, waste and non-domestic energy efficiency\".\"Clegg: UK green bank 'to begin investing in April 2012'\" BBC News, 23 May 2011 Clegg added that legislation would \"ensure the independence of the institution.\" On 24 May 2011, Business Secretary Vince Cable, in addressing the parliament, stated that the bank will become \"a key component\" of the transition to a \"low-carbon economy\", which will need \"significant investment over the coming decades.\" Cable also stated that the GIB will have an initial capitalisation of \u00a33 billion, which \"the Government believes will leverage a further \u00a315 billion of private investment\".\"UK Business Secretary sets out future of Green Investment Bank as \u2018enduring institution\u2019\" Energy Efficiency News, 25 May 2011 The same day, BIS, in a press releasePress release BIS, 25 May 2011 containing answers to \"frequently asked questions\" about the bank, outlined the planned finances of the GIB and its activation in \"three phases\": *Incubation (April 2012 until state aid approval): Government makes direct financial investments in the \"green economy\". *Establishment (following state aid approval): UK Green Investment Bank established as a \"stand-alone institution\". *Full borrowing powers (ca. 2015\u201316): Bank given powers to borrow, \"subject to public sector's net-debt falling as a percentage of GDP\". Dr Cable unveiled on the same day his department's statement of vision for the bank.\"Update on the design of the Green Investment Bank\" BIS, May 2011 The document was cautiously\"While different investor groups can be comfortable with different elements of risk profiles, the number of investors willing to take the set of required risks may be limited by lack of information and experience and the application of risk-averse rules of thumb.\" Update, p.14 positive about the prospects of private investment in the environment in the UK. BIS appeared to indicate on 12 December 2011 that the 'Incubation' phase had progressed, with the announcement of a new team within the department: UK Green Investments (UKGI). It stated the team's role was to \"drive investment in the UK\u2019s green infrastructure until the Green Investment Bank is formally established\".GIB moves a step closer Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, December 2011 Initially the UKGI team consisted of six members: five men and one woman.The UKGI Team Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, January 2012 State aid approval for the bank was granted by the EU Commission on 17 October 2012, allowing the bank to become fully established.\"UK Green Investment Bank gets green light from Europe\" Department for Business, Innovation and Skills The bank was subsequently formally launched in Edinburgh by Vince Cable on 28 November 2012.\"Cable launches UK's 'Green Bank'\" BBC News ==Management== On 25 May 2011, Vince Cable informed the House of Commons that BIS would appoint Sir Adrian Montague, CBE, chairman of private equity firm 3i, to lead a team of \"independent financial experts\" in setting up the UK Green Investment Bank before it started work the following year.\"Nuclear boss Sir Adrian Montague to head Green bank\", Telegraph, 25 May 2011 Cable stated that the bank would be initially staffed by up to 100 people tasked with \"financing the Coalition's plans for a low-carbon economy\".
