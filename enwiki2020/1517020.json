The Red Ribbon Foundation and Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) are examples of organizations that utilize the red ribbon symbol. MADD is an organization founded in 1980 whose mission is to stop drunk driving, support the victims of this violent crime and prevent underage drinking. Red Ribbon International is an organization founded in 1993 whose main purpose is the education about prevention of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus or HIV, Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome Related Complex, ARC and AIDS. ===Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) origins=== In 1986, MADD started the \"Tie One On For Safety\" campaign. It is MADD\u2019s longest running and most visible public awareness project. During the holiday season, drivers are encouraged to tie MADD red ribbons to visible locations on their vehicles, or place window decals on their vehicles\u2019 windows. The red ribbons represent the drivers\u2019 commitment to drive safe, sober and buckled up. It also encourages others to designate a sober driver before drinking. ===Alcohol, tobacco and other drug prevention awareness origin=== The Red Ribbon was used as an awareness symbol made by after DEA Agent Enrique Camarena was kidnapped, tortured, and murdered while working undercover in Guadalajara, Mexico.

The artists who formed the Visual AIDS Artists Caucus wished to create a visual symbol to demonstrate compassion for people living with AIDS and their caregivers. Inspired by the yellow ribbons honoring American soldiers serving in the Gulf war, the color red was chosen for its, \"connection to blood and the idea of passion--not only anger, but love, like a valentine.\" First worn publicly by Jeremy Irons at the 1991 Tony Awards,Ribbon: The Art of Adornment p.22.

Bush's administration, proposed that the administration display a AIDS ribbon on the White House's iconic North Portico on World AIDS Day 2007.
