    "text": "The Prix Pierre Guzman (Pierre Guzman Prize) was the name given to two prizes, one astronomical and one medical. Both were established by the will of Anne Emilie Clara Goguet (died June 30, 1891), wife of Marc Guzman, and named after her son Pierre Guzman. ==Astronomical== This prize was a sum of 100,000 francs, to be given to a person who succeeded in communicating with a celestial body, other than Mars, and receiving a response. Until this occurred, the will also allowed for the accumulated interest on the 100,000 francs to be given, every five years, to a person who had made significant progress in astronomy. The prize was to be awarded by the French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences.pp. 2-7 (minutes of meeting), Transactions of the New York Academy of Sciences, series I, 11 (October\u2013November 1891; issue 1-2), . Pierre Guzman had been interested in the work of Camille Flammarion, the author of La plan\u00e8te Mars et ses conditions d'habitabilit\u00e9 (The Planet Mars and Its Conditions of Habitability, 1892). Communication with Mars was specifically exempted as many people believed that Mars was inhabited at the time and communication with that planet would not be a difficult enough challenge.Camille Flammarion, Dreams of an Astronomer, trans. E. E. Fournier D'Albe (New York: D. Appleton & Co., 1923), p. 154. The prize was later announced in 1900 by the French Acad\u00e9mie des sciences.Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, 131 (1900), p. 1147. The five-yearly prize of interest was awarded, starting in 1905, as follows: * In Dec. 1905, to Henri Joseph Anastase Perrotin.Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, 141 (1905), p. 1071.p. 491, Bulletin de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 astronomique de France, 20 (1906). A portion of the prize was also given to Louis Fabry.Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, 141 (1905), p. 1077.p. 339, Bulletin de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de g\u00e9ographie de Marseille, 29 (1905). * In Dec. 1910, to Maurice Loewy.Comptes rendus hebdomadaires des s\u00e9ances de l'Acad\u00e9mie des sciences, 151 (1910), p. 1187. Nikola Tesla claimed in 1937 that he should receive the prize for \"his discovery relating to the interstellar transmission of energy.\"\"Sending of Messages to Planets Predicted by Dr. Tesla on Birthday ,\" New York Times, 11 July 1937, p. 13, c. 2. The prize was awarded to the crew of Apollo 11 in 1969.Michael Collins, Mission To Mars, (, Grove Weidenfeld, 1990), p. 6.p. 60, \"Apollo 11 Crew Awarded Medals for Moon Trip\", The Blade (Toledo, Ohio, USA), Dec. 10, 1969. ==Medical== This prize was a sum of 50,000 francs, to be awarded by the French Acad\u00e9mie de m\u00e9decine, to be given to a person who succeeded in developing an effective treatment for the most common forms of heart disease. Until this occurred, the will also allowed for the accumulated interest to be given yearly to someone who had made progress in heart disease.p. 222, L'Aesculpe: guide pratique \u00e0 l'usage des \u00e9tudiants et des docteurs en m\u00e9decine, Paris: Masson & Cie, 1905.
