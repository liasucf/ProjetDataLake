According to the British Medical Journal, Murphy's Triad consists of \"pain in the abdomen followed by nausea or vomiting, and general abdominal sensitiveness on the right side, followed by an elevated body temperature.\" Although the original notes on Murphy's Triad includes four signs (the fourth being a rise in temperature), it may be noted that \"it is evident that it is not a constant feature throughout an attack and [that] the elevation of temperature may be absent at certain stages and in certain circumstances.\" ==References== Category:Medical signs ",
