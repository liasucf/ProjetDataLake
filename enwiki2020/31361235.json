A Pobjoy Niagara radial piston engine was mounted on the fuselage nose. It had fixed tailwheel landing gear and the rear fuselage included a large dorsal fin to provide directional stability. An unusual feature was the control system which was equipped with spider-actuated cyclic and collective pitch control of the rotor blades; this mechanism, a variant of the swashplate-actuated rotor control, became a standard feature on helicopters. In 1935, the Gyroplane was manufactured at the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company's factory at Denham, Buckinghamshire. In autumn 1935, the Gyroplane, registered G-ADMV, first flew at Heston Aerodrome, piloted by V.H. Baker.Flight, 19 September 1935, p. 318 On 6 February 1937, it flew at Hanworth Air Park, having been modified as the Mark 2 version. It was tested at Farnborough, and leased to the Royal Aircraft Establishment for research, but it was scrapped during the second world war. A two-seat A.R.IV and three- seat A.R.V were planned, but construction was stopped when Hafner was interned under Defence Regulation 18B. ==Variants== ;A.R.III :Prototype single-seat autogyro powered by a Pobjoy Niagara radial piston engine. ;A.R.IV :Experimental rotorcraft to meet Air Ministry Specification S.22/38. Powered by a 210hp de Havilland Gipsy Six II engine, construction was started by Short Brothers as the Fleet Spotter, but was stopped in May 1940 when Hafner was interned. ;A.R.V :Experimental rotorcraft to meet Air Ministry Specification S.22/38.
