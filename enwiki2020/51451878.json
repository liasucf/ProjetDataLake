He was introduced to the world of magic by a stage hypnotist by the name of Rolf Dinardi, and after the latter's death, obtained permission to perform under that name. His first public show was on 6 January 1939, using props obtained from J\u00e1nos Bartl. Dinardi met his future wife, a stage performer named Anni, at a travelling circus in Gladbeck, and they married in 1944. The Second World War prevented them from performing together until 1946. Dinardi was best known for his performances with springed feather flowers, which he would produce in tremendous quantities from a box that seemed too small to contain them all. The lush, realistic-looking bouquets were manufactured by Dinardi himself using dyed chicken feathers. == Awards and honours == Dinardi was recognized as Magician of the Year for 1989/1990 by the Magischer Zirkel von Deutschland, the magicians' association of West Germany. == References == == Further reading== * Magische Welt 39(4), 1990, pp. 287\u2013288. * Wittus Witt. \"100 Jahre Blumenk\u00f6nig: Rolf Dinardi.\" Magische Welt 60(4), 2011, pp. 176\u2013177. == External links == * * , from Wittus Witt's channel Category:1911 births Category:1996 deaths Category:German magicians Category:People from Wa\u0142brzych County Category:People from the Province of Silesia ",
