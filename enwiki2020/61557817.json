    "text": "The Lionel Viera Bridge, also known as the Puente de la Barra and Maldonado Bridge, is a stressed ribbon bridge linking the cities of Punta del Este and La Barra across the in southern Uruguay. The bridge is a landmark of both the local beach communities and of Uruguay. ==History== A man by the last name Mart\u00ednez, the first owner of the La Barra hotel, La Posta del Cangrejo, convinced the then Uruguayan president Eduardo V\u00edctor Haedo to build a bridge linking that town with Punta del Este. Historically, there has been two bridges built at the same crossing of the Maldonado River which each failed due to natural disasters.Perdomo Freitas, A. C. (1990). Aspectos generales de la hidroqu\u00edmica de la porci\u00f3n estuarial del arroyo Maldonado.Christophersen, M. (1999). La Barra de Maldonado: Bisagra de una regi\u00f3n. M. Christophersen Miller. The bridge was designed by builder (1913\u20131975), who had no previous experience in architecture or civil engineering. Viera pioneered the construction sequence now typical for concrete segment bridges of this type. After placement of the principal cables, precast concrete tiles were placed to form the initial structure. The cables were then prestressed by loading sandbags upon the tiles, followed by final concretization of the gaps between tiles. Removal of the sandbags then compressively stressed the concrete structure, enhancing its stiffness and durability under load. The overall structure of the bridge would have a main span of 90m (295ft) with two shorter 30m (98ft) spans linking the main span to the shore. The ingenious design and later construction of the bridge propelled Viera to national fame.An\u00e1lisis de autores - Obra de Leonel Viera Departamento de Construcciones, Escuela de Ingenier\u00eda Civil, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas Ingenier\u00eda y Agrimensura, Universidad Nacional de Rosario.

In 1998, a contract was awarded to engineer Alberto Ponce Delgado to twin the bridge 20 meters (65ft) upstream of the original span. A study commissioned in 1999 found that the original span was in need of repairs, which were later completed in 2005. ==See Also== *List of bridges in Uruguay ==References== Category:1965 establishments in Uruguay Category:Bridges completed in 1965 Category:Bridges in Uruguay Category:Stressed ribbon bridges in Uruguay ",
