    "text": "Diri ak djon djon () is a native dish of Haiti. It is essentially a meal consisting of rice (diri, ) with (ak, ) edible black mushrooms (djon djon). The meal is more common in the northern region of the country and therefore can be considered a regional specialty. When the mushrooms are boiled, they release a grayish-black coloring giving the rice its gray color and the dish's distinctive flavor. The dish is often served with some sort of meat, whether it be fish, chicken or shrimp (usually mixed in the rice). ==See also== * List of mushroom dishes ==References== Category:Haitian cuisine Category:Caribbean cuisine Category:Rice dishes Category:Mushroom dishes Category:National dishes ",
