    "text": "A semantic triple, or RDF triple or simply triple, is the atomic data entity in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) data model.http://www.w3.org/TR/PR-rdf-syntax/ \"Resource Description Framework (RDF) Model and Syntax Specification\" As its name indicates, a triple is a set of three entities that codifies a statement about semantic data in the form of subject\u2013predicate\u2013object expressions (e.g., \"Bob is 35\", or \"Bob knows John\"). ==Subject, predicate and object== This format enables knowledge to be represented in a machine-readable way. Particularly, every part of an RDF triple is individually addressable via unique URIs \u2014 for example, the statement \"Bob knows John\" might be represented in RDF as: `http://example.name#BobSmith12 http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/knows http://example.name#JohnDoe34`. Given this precise representation, semantic data can be unambiguously queried and reasoned about. The basic semantic triple model.The components of a triple, such as the statement \"The sky has the color blue\", consist of a subject (\"the sky\"), a predicate (\"has the color\"), and an object (\"blue\"). This is similar to the classical notation of an entity\u2013attribute\u2013value model within object-oriented design, where this example would be expressed as an entity (sky), an attribute (color) and a value (blue). From this basic structure, triples can be composed into more complex models, by using triples as objects or subjects of other triples \u2014 for example, `Mike \u2192 said \u2192 (triples \u2192 can be \u2192 objects)`. Given their particular, consistent structure, a collection of triples is often stored in purpose-built databases called Triplestores. ==Difference to relational databases== A relational database is the classical form for information storage. It's working with different tables which consist of rows. The well known SQL- language is able to retrieve information from a database. In contrast, the RDF triple storage is working with logical predicates. No tables nor rows are needed but the information is stored in a text file. A RDF-triple storage can be converted into a SQL database and the other way around. If the knowledge is highly unstructured and dedicated tables aren't flexible enough, semantic triples are used over classical SQL storage. In contrast to a traditional SQL database, the RDF triple storage isn't created with table editors but the preferred tool is a knowledge editor, for example Protege. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 looks similar to an object-oriented modeling application used for software engineering, but it's focused on natural language information. The RDF triples are aggregated into a knowledge base which allows external parser to run requests. Possible applications are located within video games for the creation of non player characters. ==Limitations== An easy to solve concern about triple storage is the missing Database scalability towards larger datasets. The problem has become visible if not only a few information but millions of triples are stored and retrieved in a database. The seek time is larger than for classical SQL based databases. A bit harder to fix is the missing ability to predict future situation with a given knowledge model. Even if all the information are available as logical predicates, the model fails in answering what-if questions. For example, suppose in the RDF-format the world of a robot is described very well. The robot knows what the location of the table is, is aware of the distance to the table in centimeter and knows also that a table is a furniture. Before the robot can plan the next action he needs temporal reasoning capabilities. That means, the knowledge model should answer hypothetical questions in advance before an action was taken. == See also == * Named graphs and quads, an extension to semantic triples to also include a context node as a fourth element. == References == == External links == * Category:Semantic Web Category:Data modeling Category:Resource Description Framework Category:Knowledge representation ",
