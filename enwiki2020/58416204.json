The art academy was first established in 1775 by prince-bishop Fran\u00e7ois-Charles de Velbr\u00fcck, and was led initially by Guillaume \u00c9vrard and later by L\u00e9onard Defrance.Bruno Demoulin, \"1505\u20131795: From the Renaissance to the Revolution\", in History of Li\u00e8ge, edited by Bruno Demoulin (Brussels, 2017), p. 146. The prince-bishop's academy was closed in the French period, and under the United Kingdom of the Netherlands the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp was given a monopoly on certifying art teachers.Jean- Patrick Duchesne, \"Modern Times: Visual Arts and Music\", in History of Li\u00e8ge, edited by Bruno Demoulin (Brussels, 2017). In the wake of the Belgian Revolution, the city of Li\u00e8ge refounded an academy of fine arts in 1837, under the patronage of the Belgian crown. By 1890 there were 650 students enrolled, with another 400 studying at the \u00c9cole Saint-Luc, making Li\u00e8ge a significant centre of art education. In 1898 the alumni association started publishing the art journal L'Effort. In 1976, a course on drawing comics was instituted in the evening section. The academy was originally established in a former beguinage, the Hospice Saint-Abraham, but in 1895 moved to a purpose-built Renaissance Revival structure on Rue des Anglais, designed by Joseph Lousberg. ==References== ==External links== *http://www.academieroyaledesbeauxartsliege.be/ Category:Buildings and structures in Li\u00e8ge Category:1775 establishments in Europe Category:1837 establishments in Belgium Category:Art schools in Belgium ",
