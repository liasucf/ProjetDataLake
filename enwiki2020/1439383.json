    "text": "Orbitz is a noncarbonated fruit-flavored beverage product made by The Clearly Food & Beverage Company of Canada, makers of Clearly Canadian. It was introduced in 1997 and quickly disappeared due to poor sales. In July 2013, Clearly Canadian stated that it was considering producing a limited run of new products to satisfy \"nostalgia demand\", with the possibility of annual issues thereafter based on consumer reception of the initial batch. Made with small floating edible balls, the drink was marketed as a \"texturally enhanced alternative beverage\" but some consumers compared it to a potable lava lamp. The small balls floated due to their nearly equal density to the surrounding liquid, and remained suspended with assistance from an ingredient known as gellan gum. The gellan gum provided a support matrix\u2014something like a microscopic spider web\u2014and had a visual clarity approaching that of water, which increased with the addition of sugar. The gellan gum created a very weak yield stress which has been measured to be ~0.04 Pa. The product's website was bought by the Internet-based travel agency named Orbitz. Unopened bottles from the drink's original launch have become a collector's item, appearing on online auction websites. ==Flavors== *Black Currant Berry *Blueberry Melon Strawberry *Pineapple Banana Cherry Coconut *Raspberry Citrus *Vanilla Orange ==See also== * Bubble tea * Basil seed drink * List of defunct consumer brands ==References== ==External links== * Extinct Beverage Tasting: raSpbeRrY CitRus Orbitz * BevNET: Orbitz * Clearly Canadian launches Orbitz in Canada * Brad Tries: Orbitz Category:Soft drinks Category:Defunct consumer brands Category:Products introduced in 1997 Category:Canadian drinks ",
