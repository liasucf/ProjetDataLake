He then went to Paris, where he was a student of the Orientalist, Gustave Boulanger and the history painter, Jules Lefebvre, at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux- Arts. His first exhibit was in 1878. Four years later, he obtained a grant that enabled him to visit Germany, Italy, Spain and Tunisia. Not long After returning, in 1889, he married Am\u00e9lie Perretti, and they immediately set off for a three-month stay in Biskra. He would go there every winter for the next few years, until 1893, when the local people became suspicious of his activities. After that, until 1908, he wintered in Venice. In his later years, he was a free-lance artist in Paris. His Orientalist works depicted scenes from daily life; notably The Butchers of Chetma, which was presented at the Salon in 1890.Annie Yacob, Dossier de l'Art n\u00b0 185, \"L'orientalisme de Delacroix \u00e0 Matisse\", Marseille, 2011 He also created numerous views of Venice during his stays there.
