They became a charity registered with the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator in December 2009 (SC041153). ===School visits=== By June 2009, the first phase of MAV's schools project had trained 55 volunteers. Visits to 13- to 14-year-old pupils in schools were planned to commence at the start of the coming school year. Sessions would involve medics speaking to pupils about the consequences of violence using a set lesson plan and film, illustrating this with experiences from a wide range of medical specialties. MAV concentrated on schools in areas of urban deprivation or those with high levels of youth violence. There was a particular focus on issues around knife crime and gang membership. As of 2011 MAV had spoken to over 5000 young people in schools in the west of Scotland. ===Other professionals=== A joint initiative launched in 2010 with the VRU saw MAV train dentists to spot victims of domestic violence and signpost them towards help.
