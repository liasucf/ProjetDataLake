    "text": "\"Will You Be There\" is a 1989 single by the German synthpop band Celebrate the Nun, from their 1990 debut album Meanwhile. It was the group's biggest hit, peaking at #5 on the Billboard Dance Play Charts on the week of June 23, 1990. ==CD production== The title was recorded and mixed in different versions in the summer of 1989 by Achim V\u00f6lker (executive producer) and Peter Siedlaczek (chief sound engineer) on behalf of the record label Westside Music, in the ArtLab studios in Frankfurt am Main. Even before the release of the album Meanwhile (1990), the maxi-CD was released in the fall of 1989 in several versions and formats (mini-CD). The materials used for the CD cover photos were taken by Michael W. Frank, with the design of J\u00fcrgen H\u00f6ber. ==Music video== Like the video for \"Ordinary Town\", the music video for this song is a simple performance by the band in a multi-coloured room. ==Track listings== 7\" single (UK, 1989) # \"Will You Be There\" \u2013 3:30 # \"Unattainable Love\" \u2013 3:32 12\" single (US, 1989) # \"Will You Be There\" (Celebrate the Nun Mix) \u2013 7:27 # \"Will You Be There\" (Devilish Dub) \u2013 4:59 # \"Will You Be There\" (7\" Mix) \u2013 3:34 # \"Will You Be There\" (A cappella) \u2013 0:35 # \"Will You Be There\" (French Floor Mix) \u2013 6:07 # \"Will You Be There\" (French Floor Dub) \u2013 3:39 # \"Will You Be There\" (12\" Version) \u2013 5:30 12\" single (Germany, 1989) # \"Will You Be There\" \u2013 5:30 # \"Unattainable Love\" \u2013 4:36 # \"Will You Be There\" (A cappella) \u2013 0:35 In 2002, the song was released again, as the version V.02 and track 2 of the CD maxi \"Arthur Have You Eaten All The Ginger-Biscuits\" by Celebrate the None.
