She was appointed to serve concurrently as Albania's Ambassador to Cuba. In October 2017, at a UN Security Council meeting, Kadare said that the meaningful inclusion of women in conflict prevention and peace processes remained negligible, with women being sidelined during peace negotiations even when they were present, as it was always men who led and decided when and how to make peace. She urged that Member States increase their commitment to fully integrate women in their peace and security agenda. In 2018 Muslim-majority Albania co-hosted an event at the United Nations with Catholic-majority Italy and Jewish-majority Israel celebrating the translation of the Talmud into Italian for the first time. Ambassador Kadare opined: \u201cProjects like the Babylonian Talmud Translation open a new lane in intercultural and interfaith dialogue, bringing hope and understanding among people, the right tools to counter prejudice, stereotypical thinking and discrimination. By doing so, we think that we strengthen our social traditions, peace, stability \u2014 and we also counter violent extremist tendencies.\u201d In January 2019 Kadare on behalf of Albania co- hosted together with the World Jewish Congress and the United Nations Department of Global Communications an event on the theme \u201cA story of humanity: the rescue of Jews in Albania\u201d. She delivered remarks at the United Nations at a briefing entitled \u201cHolocaust Remembrance: Demand and Defend your Human Rights\u201d, marking International Holocaust Remembrance Day and reflecting on the genocide of six million European Jews during World War Two, and the little-known record of Albanians during the Holocaust in Albania, which took in thousands of Jews who would otherwise have ended up in the Nazi death camps.
