    "text": "Norman Dewey \"Rocky\" Holcomb III (born 1968) is an American politician who served as a member of the Virginia House of Delegates for the 85th district from 2017 to 2018. He is a member of the Republican Party. ==Career== Holcomb served in the United States Marine Corps and for the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office. He won a special election to the Virginia House of Delegates held on January 10, 2017, to succeed Scott Taylor, who had been elected to the United States House of Representatives. He went on to lose the November general election in 2017 to Cheryl Turpin, whom he had faced earlier that year in the special election. During the 2017 election cycle, Holcomb sparked controversy due to his associations with Scott Presler, an individual the Southern Poverty Law Center identified as a paid employee of known anti-Muslim hate group ACT! for America, who served as a campaign volunteer. When a Virginia Beach resident questioned Holcomb about the relationship on his delegate Facebook page, she was blocked from the page. Holcomb later stated that he does not have a personal relationship with Pressler. During the 2019 election cycle, instead of running for re-election, Cheryl Turpin decided to instead run for Virginia State Senate. The 85th district seat now vulnerable, Holcomb announced he would run for the seat once more. He was challenged by Democrat Alex Askew, who served as a staffer for Barack Obama\u2018s 2012 Presidential Campaign. Holcomb lost to Askew by a margin of 3.46% ==References== Category:1968 births Category:Living people Category:21st-century American politicians Category:Virginia Republicans Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates Category:United States Marines Category:Regent University alumni Category:Politicians from Virginia Beach, Virginia Category:People from Bluefield, West Virginia ",
