    "text": "A local electoral area (LEA) is an electoral area for elections to local authorities in Ireland. All elections use the single transferable vote. The boundaries of LEAs are defined by statutory instrument in terms of lower-level units called electoral divisions (EDs). ==Municipal districts== A municipal district is a division of a local authority which can exercise certain powers of the local authority. They came into being on 1 June 2014, ten days after the local elections, under the provisions of the Local Government Reform Act 2014. Of the 31 local authorities, 25 are subdivided into municipal districts, which comprise one or more LEA. The exceptions are the three city councils (Cork City, Dublin City and Galway City) and the three county councils in Dublin (D\u00fan Laoghaire\u2013Rathdown, Fingal and South Dublin). A district associated with a city or borough is termed a metropolitan district or borough district respectively. In 2019, John Paul Phelan, Minister of State for Local Government and Electoral Reform commented in the D\u00e1il: :Municipal districts have an extensive list of functions currently, but the situation is haphazard ... some local authorities are better at performing some functions than others. I have found that some local authorities have a strong municipal district structure, with the districts being where most of the nitty-gritty work of local authorities is done, be it roads, footpaths or lights. Some do not have that structure, though, with decisions rehashed or debated again at the councils' plenary sessions. ==Boundaries== Boundaries for local electoral areas and municipal district are determined by statutory instrument of the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government. The minister must first establish an independent boundary committee, but need not accept its advice. A boundary committee has been required since 1994 for electoral areas. The 2012\u201313 Local Electoral Area Boundary Committee considered both administrative areas (municipal districts, though not counties/cities) and electoral areas. In 2015, separate committees were set up to consider adjustments to county and municipal boundaries passing through each of four urban areas: Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda, and Waterford. A Boundary Committee established in 2017 and which reported in June 2018 recommended alterations to municipal districts and local electoral areas which were implemented in December 2018. ==Areas== Below are the districts and local electoral areas as defined by the most recent SI in each case and which were used at the 2019 local elections. Unless otherwise specified, districts are titled \"Municipal District of Carlow\", etc. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Council ! Seats ! District ! Local Electoral Area (LEA) !
