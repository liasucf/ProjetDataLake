In animal studies it has been shown to produce antinociception, anti- inflammation, anxiolysis (at low doses), respiratory depression, and diuresis, while having little effect on gastrointestinal motility. It also inhibits the peripheral, though not central secretion of oxytocin and vasopressin in rats. == See also == * U-50,488 *The dichloro analog is called spiradoline. == References == Category:Acetamides Category:Opioids Category:Pyrrolidines Category:Kappa agonists Category:Tetrahydrofurans Category:Spiro compounds ",
