It also serves as a bridge for Massachusetts Route 113. ==History== The power plant was constructed in 1918 by the Pepperell Paper Company as a means to power their nearby paper mill. It was originally constructed with three vertical Francis turbines and a 600 foot long penstock all of which have since been replaced. After the paper company closed in 2002, the Swift River Hydro Operations Company was formed to manage and maintain the dam. ==References== Category:Hydroelectric power plants in Massachusetts Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 1918 Category:Buildings and structures in Middlesex County, Massachusetts ",
