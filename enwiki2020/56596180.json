    "text": "Rotenburg I - Heidekreis is one of the 299 single member constituencies used for the German parliament, the Bundestag. The constituency elects one representative under the mixed member proportional representation (MMP) system. Under the current constituency numbering system, it is designated as constituency 35. ==Overview== Located in Lower Saxony, the constituency comprises the area of the district Heidekreis and the southern part of the district Rotenburg with the cities of Rotenburg an der W\u00fcmme, Schee\u00dfel and Visselh\u00f6vede and the joint communities Bothel, Fintel and Sottrum. ==History== Between 1949 and 1976, the area of Rotenburg I - Heidekreis was distributed in the three constituencies, Verden - Rotenburg - Osterholz (number 34), Harburg - Soltau (number 36) and Fallingbostel - Hoya (number 37). In 1980, the constituency was created as Soltau - Rotenburg with number 30. After the parliamentary elections in 1980 and 1983, it was renamed Soltau-Fallingbostel - Rotenburg II. As part of the reorganization of constituencies before the 2002 general elections the constituency was abolished and the constituency area was merged into the newly created, Rotenburg - Verden (Constituency 35) and Soltau-Fallingbostel - Winsen L. (Constituency 36). For the 2009 election, the old constituency with the new name was again created. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Election !! Constituency No. !!
