    "text": "Ren & Stimpy's Crock O' Christmas is the second album and only Christmas album featuring characters from the Nickelodeon animated series, The Ren and Stimpy Show. The album, originally released September 21, 1993 through Nickelodeon, Sony Wonder and Columbia Records, is a concept album that follows the title characters as they prepare for the holidays; in their case, the holiday is \"Yaksmas Eve,\" a reference to the second episode of the original 1991 season in which they prepare for Yak Shaving Day and a visit from the Gilded Yak via his flying \"enchanted canoe.\" Soiled diapers are hung from mantelpieces in lieu of Christmas stockings while another tradition calls for filling of one's uncle's boots with coleslaw. It is hoped that the Gilded Yak, who lives at the \"West Pole\" and who appears via the drain of the bathtub, will leave shaving cream scum in the bathroom sink. Ren & Stimpy's Crock O' Christmas was re- released on compact disc August 5, 1997 on the Kid Rhino Entertainment record label. As in the case with later episodes of the television program, Billy West provided the speaking and singing voices of both Ren and Stimpy. ==Track listing== *1. \"Fleck the Walls\" - 2:51 \u2013 Stimpy explains to Ren that it is Yaksmas Eve to the tune of \"Deck the Halls\". *2. \"Cat Hairballs\" - 3:27 \u2013 Stimpy sings about the gifts he can make out of his hairballs to the tune of \"Jingle Bells\".
