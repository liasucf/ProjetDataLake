He was employed in painting the frescoes in the Aula at the University of Bonn, and those of the Glyptothek and the arcades at Munich, but his reputation rests chiefly on his discovery of several ancient pictures, and on his works on the history of art. His greatest discovery was the frescoes of Altichiero da Zevio, which date as far back as 1376, in the Chapel of San Giorgio at Padua. It is known that he lived at L\u00f6wen Stra\u00dfe 8 in Munich around 1850.Paul Maucher: Alphabetic register of house owners 1849-1851 , p. 15. His brother was Friedrich Christoph F\u00f6rster.
