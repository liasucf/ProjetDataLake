In an interview with the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten (published 1 May 2017) R\u00f8kke said he planned to give away most of his fortune. As a further step in this plan he joined the Giving Pledge in 2017, and founded the REV Ocean initiative. Led by former WWF Norway CEO Nina Jensen, REV Ocean is working to improve understanding of the ocean and foster concrete solutions through three initiatives: the world's largest research and expedition vessel (REV), the World Ocean Headquarters and an open, global data platform. She is purpose built for scientific charter and environmental research missions. Her TIER III hybrid propulsion allows a full-electric mode at eleven knots when the yacht collects samples. Her total operating range is 21,000 nautical miles. ==References== Category:Motor yachts ",
