    "text": "Potassium ferrate is the chemical compound with the formula K2FeO4. This purple salt is paramagnetic, and is a rare example of an iron(VI) compound. In most of its compounds, iron has the oxidation state +2 or +3 (Fe2+ or Fe3+). Reflecting its high oxidation state, FeO42\u2212 is a powerful oxidizing agent. ==Synthesis and structure== An aqueous solution of potassium ferrate(VI). Georg Ernst Stahl (1660 - 1734) first discovered that the residue formed by igniting a mixture of potassium nitrate (saltpetre) and iron powder dissolved in water to give a purple solution. Edmond Fr\u00e9my (1814 - 1894) later discovered that fusion of potassium hydroxide and iron(III) oxide in air produced a compound that was soluble in water. The composition corresponded to that of potassium manganate. In the laboratory, K2FeO4 is prepared by oxidizing an alkaline solution of an iron(III) salt with concentrated chlorine bleach.Schreyer, J. M.; Thompson, G. W.; Ockerman, L. T. \"Potassium Ferrate(VI)\" Inorganic Syntheses, 1953 volume IV, pages 164-168. The salt is isostructural with K2MnO4, K2SO4, and K2CrO4. The solid consists of K+ and the tetrahedral FeO42\u2212 anion, with Fe-O distances of 1.66 \u00c5.Hoppe, M. L.; Schlemper, E. O.; Murmann, R. K. \"Structure of Dipotassium Ferrate(VI)\" Acta Crystallographica 1982, volume B38, pp. 2237-2239. . The poorly soluble barium salt, BaFeO4, is also known. ==Properties and applications== The main difficulty with the use of K2FeO4 is that it is often too reactive, as indicated by the fact that it decomposes in contact with water, especially in acidic water:Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \"Inorganic Chemistry\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. . : 4 K2FeO4 \\+ 4 H2O \u2192 3 O2 \\+ 2 Fe2O3 \\+ 8 KOH At high pH, aqueous solutions are stable. The deep purple solutions are similar in appearance to potassium permanganate (). It is stronger oxidizing agent than the latter. As a dry solid, K2FeO4 is stable. Because the side products of its redox reactions are rust-like iron oxides, K2FeO4 has been described as a \"green oxidant.\" It has been employed in waste-water treatment as an oxidant for organic contaminants and as a biocide. Conveniently, the resulting reaction product is iron(III) oxyhydroxide, an excellent flocculant. In organic synthesis, K2FeO4 oxidizes primary alcohols.Green, J. R. \u201cPotassium Ferrate\u201d Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis 2001, John Wiley. . In contrast, related oxidants such as chromate are considered environmentally hazardous K2FeO4 has also attracted attention as a potential cathode material in a \"super iron battery.\" Stabilised forms of potassium ferrate have been proposed for the removal of transuranic species, both dissolved and suspended, from aqueous solutions. Tonnage quantities were proposed to help remediate the effects of the Chernobyl disaster in Belarus. This new technique was successfully applied for the removal of a broad range of heavy metals. It has been proposed as a bleeding stopper for fresh wounds. ==References== Category:Ferrates Category:Potassium compounds Category:Oxidizing agents Work on the use of Potassium Ferrate precipitation of Transuranics' and Heavy Metals was carried out in the Laboratories of IC Technologies Inc. in partnership with ADC Laboratories, in 1987 though 1992. The removal of the Transuranics' were done on samples from various Dept. of Energy nuclear sites in the USA to great success and was presented to the Dept. of Energy. The work was performed by Mr. Patric Galvin and his staff. ",
