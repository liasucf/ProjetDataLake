In 2009, Chinese pharmacologist Li Lianda claimed that a key product made by Tasly was unsafe. Tasly sued Li in 2013, alleging that Li's claim was baseless and was motivated by his financial and employment relations with Guangzhou Pharmaceutical, a direct competitor of Tasly. In September 2014, the Tianjin High People's Court ruled in favour of Tasly and ordered Li to issue an apology and pay Tasly 300,000 yuan in compensation. In February 2017, Tasly announced plans to form a joint venture with American multi-level marketing company Herbalife. == See also == * Pharmaceutical industry in China * Tianshili Station == Notes and references == == External links == * Category:Companies based in Tianjin Category:Chinese companies established in 1994 Category:Pharmaceutical companies of China Category:Companies listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Category:Traditional Chinese medicine Category:Chinese brands Category:Pharmaceutical companies established in 1994 ",
