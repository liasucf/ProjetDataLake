    "text": "Charles City County, Virginia from 1895 state map This is a list of common atlas and gazetteer abbreviations. These abbreviations are not always used consistently between publications; some terms have fallen out of use over time. Older gazetteers and atlases often neglect to define abbreviations and underlying terms. Gazetteer and map abbreviations can show up in several forms: upper or lower case, with or without periods, sometimes with hyphens (e.g., Post Village may be P.V., PV, p.v., or p-v). This list doesn't include direction headings (e.g., N. or No. for north, etc.), which are generally clear. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Caption: List of Gazetteer and Map Abbreviations |- ! abbreviation ! term ! usage and notes |- | br. | Branch | |- | c. | Cape | |- | C.H. | Court HouseChapin, William.
