    "text": "Beauharnois is a provincial electoral district in the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region of Quebec, Canada that elects members to the National Assembly of Quebec. It includes the cities of Salaberry-de-Valleyfield and Beauharnois. It was created in 2001 from parts of Beauharnois-Huntingdon, Ch\u00e2teauguay and Salaberry-Soulanges. In the change from the 2001 to the 2011 electoral map, its territory was unchanged. An earlier version of the Beauharnois electoral district had been created for the 1867 election (and an electoral district of that name existed earlier in the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada and the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada). Its last election was in 1985. It disappeared in the 1989 election and its successor electoral district was Beauharnois-Huntingdon. ==Members of the Legislative Assembly / National Assembly== ==Election results== * Result compared to Action d\u00e9mocratique |- |Liberal |Louis-Charles Roy |align=\"right\"|8,811 |align=\"right\"|33.64 |align=\"right\"| } |Independent |Christian Grenon |align=\"right\"|467 |align=\"right\"|1.78 |align=\"right\"| |} |- |Liberal |Jean-Guy Hudon |align=\"right\"|7,679 |align=\"right\"|24.32 |align=\"right\"| |- |} |- |Liberal |Mario Faubert |align=\"right\"|13,265 |align=\"right\"|42.77 |align=\"right\"| |- |} ==References== ==External links== ;Information: * Elections Quebec ;Election results: * Election results (National Assembly) ;Maps * 2011 map (PDF) * 2001 map (Flash) *:2001\u20132011 changes (Flash) *:1992\u20132001 changes (Flash) * Electoral map of Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie region * Quebec electoral map, 2011 Category:Quebec provincial electoral districts Category:Salaberry-de- Valleyfield ",
