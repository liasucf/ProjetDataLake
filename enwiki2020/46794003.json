    "text": "This is a list of the Shire Presidents and Mayors of Ku-ring-gai Council and its predecessors, a local government area of New South Wales, Australia. The official title of Mayors while holding office is: His/Her Worship the Mayor of Ku-ring-gai. ==Development of the office== Ku-ring-gai was first incorporated on 6 March 1906 as the \"Shire of Ku-ring-gai\" and the first Shire Council was elected on 24 November 1906. The first leader of the council was elected at the first meeting on 8 December 1906, when Councillor William Cowan was elected as Shire President. There would not be a Deputy President until the council election on 1 March 1920. On 22 September 1928, the Shire of Ku-ring- gai was proclaimed as the \"Municipality of Ku-ring-gai\" and the titles of 'Shire President' and 'Councillor' were retitled to be 'Mayor' and 'Alderman' respectively. In 1993, with the passing of a new Local Government Act, council was retitled as simply \"Ku-ring-gai Council\" and Aldermen were retitled as Councillors. The current Mayor of Ku-ring-gai is Cr. Jennifer Anderson (Independent), who was elected for her fifth term as mayor on 21 September 2017. ==List of incumbents== ===Presidents/Deputy Presidents of Ku-ring-gai Shire Council, 1906\u20131928=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- bgcolor=\"#FFCC33\" !
