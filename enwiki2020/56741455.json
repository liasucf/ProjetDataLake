It is notable as the house in which Charles II took refuge for two nights in 1651 following the Battle of Worcester. The house was remodelled in the early 19th century. It was originally timber framed and has since been rendered, extensions added in brick, and it has tiled roofs. There are two storeys, an attic, and a cellar, a three-bay range and a lower cross-wing, with an angle turret. Most of the windows are casements. The house and its ground are a Scheduled Monument. |align=\"center\" | |- |Barn, Boscobel House | |align=\"center\"| |The barn is timber framed with red brick infill on a stone plinth and has a tile roof.
