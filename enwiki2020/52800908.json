    "text": "Morgan Anthony Gibbs-White (born 27 January 2000) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder. He is currently on loan at Swansea City from Premier League club Wolverhampton Wanderers. He has represented England at under-16 through under-21 level. ==Club career== Gibbs-White joined Wolverhampton Wanderers aged 8 and has played for the club's academy at all age groups. He made his first team debut, aged 16, as a 62nd-minute substitute for Joe Mason in a 2\u20130 win over Premier League side Stoke City in the FA Cup 3rd round on 7 January 2017. He made his first league appearance on 14 February 2017 in a 1\u20130 home defeat in the EFL Championship against Wigan Athletic. In January 2018, it was announced that Gibbs-White had signed a contract that would keep him at the club until summer 2022. He made his first Premier League appearance in the opening home match of the 2018\u201319 season against Everton as a late substitute. He also came on as a substitute in the home match against Tottenham Hotspur on 4 November 2018; despite the team losing 3\u20132, his performance received particular praise. The midfielder got his first start in the Premier League in the home game against Chelsea on 5 December 2018, in which he provided the assist for Wolves' first goal by Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez in a 2\u20131 win. On 15 August 2019 he scored his first goal for Wolves, on his 57th senior appearance for the club, in a 4\u20130 second leg win against the Armenia team FC Pyunik in a Europa League qualifier. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gibbs-White was disciplined by Wolves for having breached government rules by attending a party in London in May 2020. On 25 August 2020 he signed a new three-year contract with Wolves before moving on loan to Championship side Swansea City for the 2020\u201321 season. He scored his first goal for Swansea in a 1-0 win against Preston North End on 12 September 2020. ==International career== Gibbs-White was part of the England team that won the 2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup in India. He scored twice in the tournament, against the United States in a 4\u20131 win in the quarter-finals, and once in the final, which England won 5\u20132 against Spain. In December 2017, Rhian Brewster revealed in an interview with The Guardian that Gibbs-White was racially abused by a Spanish player during the final with the FA reporting the incident to FIFA. On 27 May 2019, Gibbs-White was included in England's 23-man squad for the 2019 UEFA European Under-21 Championship in Italy. He made his debut for that age group during the 3\u20133 draw with Croatia at the San Marino Stadium on 24 June, playing the final 17 minutes in place of James Maddison. ==Personal life== Gibbs-White was born and grew up in Stafford.
