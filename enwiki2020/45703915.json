In transition at the end of the Soviet Union, he represented the Unified Team at the 1992 Olympics in the 82.5 kg division. Samadov was the gold medalist at the 1991 World Weightlifting Championships, representing the Soviet Union with his superior clean and jerk evening his total weight with teammate Aleksandr Blyshchyk. In 1992, Altymurat Orazdurdiyev was the favorite, but was not selected for the Unified Team by coach and Russian national hero Vasily Alekseyev because Orazdurdiyev was from Turkmenistan, while Samadov was from Russia. Thus, Samadov was the new favorite. The Olympic competition was the closest in history, with all three medalists tied with the same weight lifted. The first tiebreaker was the athlete's body weight and Samadov was .05 kg heavier, pushing him to the bronze medal position. The second tie breaker was based on which athlete had lifted their weight first and Samadov would have bested eventual winner, Greek Pyrros Dimas by lifting his snatch on his second lift to Dimas' third. At the medal ceremony, Samadov refused to lean forward to accept his medal, instead taking it in his hand, before he dropped it to the podium and walked away to very loud boos. The International Olympic Committee disqualified Samadov and banned him for life. Samadov apologized the following day but the medal was not awarded, to him or to fourth place Chon Chol-Ho because the disqualification did not happen during the award ceremony. The IOC also did not accept his apology, and he was also banned for life by IWF commissioner Gottfried Schoedl. He was ineligible for the Weightlifting Hall of Fame, since making a medal ceremony protest was an offence to the entire Olympic Games. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1968 births Category:Olympic weightlifters of the Unified Team Category:Soviet male weightlifters Category:Weightlifters at the 1992 Summer Olympics Category:Competitors stripped of Summer Olympics medals Category:Chechen sportsmen Category:Sportspeople banned for life Category:Sportspeople convicted of crimes Category:European Weightlifting Championships medalists Category:World Weightlifting Championships medalists ",
