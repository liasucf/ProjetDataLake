    "text": "Toledo Terminal Railroad was a railway company in the U.S. state of Ohio. Primarily a switching railroad, it made a complete loop around the city of Toledo, crossing the Maumee River twice. ==Track history== In its heyday, the TTR was double-tracked all the way around the city of Toledo, except for the portion around the Upper Maumee Bridge. The Toledo Terminal Upper Maumee River Swing Bridge. Built in 1902, it was abandoned after it was damaged by a March 1982 derailment. It was demolished between October 2018 and May 2019.On March 17, 1982, a train derailed on the Upper Maumee Bridge, damaging it. The Toledo Terminal elected not to fix the bridge, instead abandoning it, stirring up much controversy. In 1983 it announced plans to lay continuous welded rail in north and west Toledo. In January 2010, CSX Transportation petitioned to abandon the rest of the \"Backside\" of the Toledo Terminal (the portion on the west side of the Maumee River) from Temperance, on Toledo's north side, to a small portion just north of Norfolk Southern's Chicago Main, in Vulcan. All of the removal track has since been completed, and plans are underway to turn the right-of-way into a rail trail. This leaves only a small, inactive segment from the Vulcan to the ex-Wabash mainline near Gould on Toledo's south side. The portion of the Toledo Terminal from Temperance to Bates, mainly the east of the Maumee River, is still in use by CSX. ==Corporate history== The carrier was incorporated December 4, 1907, under the general laws of Ohio, for the purpose of acquiring the property, rights, and franchises formerly owned by The Toledo Railway and Terminal Company, which was done. The date of organization was December 4, 1907. The carrier acquired by deed dated December 4, 1907, the property, rights, and franchises of the predecessor company, which had been sold at foreclosure sale on May 28, 1907. The latter was incorporated February 12, 1901, under the general laws of the State of Ohio. ==Development of fixed physical property== The owned property of the carrier, comprising of main-line railroad, of second main track, of yard tracks and sidings, a freight and passenger station, and certain other terminal facilities at Toledo, Ohio, was acquired partly by purchase after foreclosure proceedings, as previously explained, and partly by construction. The main- line mileage, of yard tracks and sidings, the freight and passenger station, and certain other terminal facilities were constructed for The Toledo Railway and Terminal Company by The Toledo Railway and Terminal Construction Company during the years 1901, 1902, and 1903, and the entire line was opened for operation on October 1, 1903. The of second main track and of yard tracks and sidings were constructed by the carrier during 1914, the work being performed by its own forces. In addition to the foregoing, the carrier owns jointly with the Pere Marquette Railway Company of yard tracks and sidings. It could not be determined from the records reviewed how this mileage was acquired.
