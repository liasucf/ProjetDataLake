Some quinazoline alkaloids show bronchodilatory effects and stimulate respiration. An abortive effect was also found for vasicine in studies on rats and rabbits.Abortive Wirkung von Lungenkraut: (PDF; 62 kB). == Examples == About 70 alkaloids with a quinazoline structure are known, which are mostly further classified as simple quinazolinones, pyrroloquinazolines, pyrido[2,1-b]quinazolines and indoloquinazolines. Vasicin.svg|Vasicine Evodiamine.svg|Evodiamine Rutecarpine.svg|Rutaecarpine Febrifugine.png|Febrifugine == Occurrence == Quinazoline alkaloids can be found mainly in plants, such as acanthaceae (Adhatoda vasica), rutaceae, saxifragaceae (Dichroa febrifuga) and in linaria species (Scrophulariaceae) and peganum harmala (Fam. Zygophyllaceae); also in animals (e. g. tetrodotoxin) and bacteria. == Links == == References == Category:Alkaloids ",
