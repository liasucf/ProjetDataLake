    "text": "The 50th Annual Country Music Association Awards, commonly known as CMA 50 or the 50th CMA Awards, were held on November 2, 2016 at the Bridgestone Arena in Nashville. The ceremony recognizes some of the best country music released during the eligibility period (between July 1, 2015 and July 20, 2016). It is the eleventh ceremony to be held at the Arena, the seventeenth to be held in November and the ninth night to be co-hosted by country stars Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood. The ceremony was directed by Paul Miller. As it was the 50th anniversary of the awards, the Country Music Association ran an extensive promotional campaign and CMA Executive Produced Robert Deaton stated that the aim of the ceremony was to include a lot of \"heritage artists\" and honor the history of country music, stressing that there would be less of a focus on artists promoting their current singles as is usually the case so that greater time could be spent including \"exciting throwbacks\". Nominations for the 50th CMA Awards were revealed on October 5, 2016 during Good Morning America by Dierks Bentley, Keith Urban and Cam live from the Grand Ole Opry. ==Winners and nominees== The winners are in Bold. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" |Entertainer of the Year ! style=\"background:#EEDD85; width=50%\" |Album of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * Garth Brooks **Luke Bryan **Chris Stapleton **Carrie Underwood **Keith Urban | valign=\"top\" | * Mr. Misunderstood \u2014 Eric Church **Black \u2014 Dierks Bentley **Hero \u2014 Maren Morris **Ripcord \u2014 Keith Urban **Storyteller \u2014 Carrie Underwood |- ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Male Vocalist of the Year ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Female Vocalist of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * Chris Stapleton ** Dierks Bentley **Eric Church **Tim McGraw ** Keith Urban | valign=\"top\" | * Carrie Underwood **Kelsea Ballerini **Miranda Lambert ** Maren Morris **Kacey Musgraves |- ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Vocal Group of the Year ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Vocal Duo of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * Little Big Town **Lady Antebellum **Old Dominion **Rascal Flatts **Zac Brown Band | valign=\"top\" | * Brothers Osborne **Dan + Shay **Florida Georgia Line **Joey + Rory **Maddie & Tae |- ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Single of the Year ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Song of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * \"Die a Happy Man\" \u2014 Thomas Rhett ** \"Humble and Kind\" \u2014 Tim McGraw ** \"My Church\" \u2014 Maren Morris ** \"Nobody to Blame\" \u2014 Chris Stapleton ** \"Record Year\" \u2014 Eric Church | valign=\"top\" | * \"Humble and Kind\" \u2014 Lori McKenna ** \"Die a Happy Man\" \u2014 Sean Douglas, Thomas Rhett, and Joe Spargur ** \"My Church\" \u2014 Busbee and Maren Morris ** \"Record Year\" \u2014 Eric Church and Jeff Hyde ** \"Burning House\" \u2014 Cam, Tyler Johnson, and Jeff Bhasker |- ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |New Artist of the Year ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Musician of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * Maren Morris **Kelsea Ballerini **Brothers Osborne **Old Dominion **Cole Swindell | valign=\"top\" | * Dann Huff, Guitar **Jerry Douglas, Dobro **Paul Franklin, Pedal Steel **Brent Mason, Guitar **Derek Wells, Guitar |- ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Music Video of the Year ! style=\"background:#EEDD82; width=50%\" |Musical Event of the Year |- | valign=\"top\" | * \"Fire Away' \u2014 Chris Stapleton ** \"Humble and Kind\" \u2014 Tim McGraw ** \"Record Year\" \u2014 Eric Church ** \"Somewhere on a Beach\" \u2014 Dierks Bentley ** \"Burning House\" \u2014 Cam | valign=\"top\" | * \"Different for Girls\" \u2014 Dierks Bentley and Elle King ** \"Home Alone Tonight\" \u2014Luke Bryan and Karen Fairchild ** \"The Fighter\" \u2014 Keith Urban and Carrie Underwood **\"Think of You\" \u2014 Chris Young and Cassadee Pope **\"You Are My Sunshine\" \u2014 Morgane Stapleton and Chris Stapleton |} ===Special Recognition Awards=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Their performance of \"Daddy Lessons\" from Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade album polarised viewers, artists and critics alike, with some praising the collaboration and others denouncing the performance, stating that Beyonc\u00e9 (a pop/R&B; artist) had no place at a country music awards show. Many saw the criticisms as retaliation to an outspoken woman of color standing alongside three equally strong independent women on the stage of an award show notorious for its conservative attitudes and lack of diversity, with several reviewers noting that many of the negative comments surrounding Beyonc\u00e9's inclusion at the ceremony as hateful and racist, pointing to the fact that there was not backlash on such a scale when Meghan Trainor performed with Miranda Lambert, Ariana Grande performed with Little Big Town or when Justin Timberlake performed with Chris Stapleton at previous CMA ceremonies, with several in fact referring to the latter as one of the best CMA performances of all time. Many also took issue with Beyonc\u00e9 being allegedly \"anti-police\" and branded the Dixie Chicks as \"anti-American\". Following the immediate, potent and unexpected backlash of some viewers, the CMA reportedly removed all mention of the performance from its social media website but later issued a statement explaining that \"CMA has not erased any mentions of Beyonc\u00e9's performance. In advance of the broadcast, CMA removed a five second clip from ABC.com and CMA's Facebook page. The promo was unapproved and CMA removed it prior to broadcast. Beyonc\u00e9's performance with the Dixie Chicks was a highlight of the evening and we are continuing to share the amazing full-length performance clip via our official social channels\". Immediately following the performance, Dixie Chick's lead singer Natalie Maines had enthusiastically shared a photograph of the quartet, declaring it as \"one of the best weeks of [her] life\", thanking Beyonc\u00e9 and humorously mentioning how she had once swore she would never play on the CMA stage again. In response to the controversy, Maines joked that \"the CMA's called and asked us to co-host next year's show with Beyonc\u00e9. Unfortunately, I've got a thing that night so no\" before following with a quotation from Beyonc\u00e9's song Formation. She went on to say that she had \"used\" the CMA's in order to fulfil her dream to perform with Beyonc\u00e9 \"on their dime\". Several country stars declared their support for Beyonc\u00e9, including Dierks Bentley who said that \"Daddy Lessons\" is undoubtedly a country song: \"it's not just choruses and verses that could be intermixed anywhere as some pop songs are, it's a real story that she tells about what's going on in her life growing up\". Karen Fairchild of Little Big Town echoed this, explaining \"she's got some stories to tell - that's what makes country music great\". Rhiannon Giddens (who performed earlier in the night alongside Eric Church) stated via a Facebook post that \"there were two other people of color at the CMA Awards who were singing country music, Charley Pride and myself. Company I'm honoured to be in. Not to mention The McCrary Sisters who rocked as usual\". The post also included a link to her performance with Church and the words \"no it's not Beyonc\u00e9 and the Dixie Chicks, it was a little quieter but it was really saying something important to me\". Responding to a comment who questioned whether she had discounted the \"Daddy Lessons\" performance as something that was not country music, Giddens added that \"she doesn't make the genres\" and that she was \"just suggesting that there are other ways of making a statement\" as the Beyonc\u00e9/Chicks performance has received \"plenty of ink\". == Promotion == Whilst promoting the ceremony, advertisements played upon the frequent tagline for the CMA Awards (\"country's biggest night\"), instead referring to it as \"country music's biggest night ever\". They accompanied this with three mash up videos featuring popular contemporary artists singing a duet of two classic country songs (Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood performing I Will Always Love You/Country Roads Take Me Home, Keith Urban and Miranda Lambert performing Crazy/Always on My Mind and Luke Bryan with Little Big Town performing Mountain Music/On the Road Again) with each concluding with the \"then, now, forever country\" tagline. Newer artists Scotty McCreery and Dustin Lynch also did videos of their own, with Scotty doing a cover of Jamey Johnson's \"In Color\" and Dustin doing Garth Brooks' \"Friends In Low Places\". ===Forever Country=== In order to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the awards, the CMA tasked Shane McAnally to produce and compose a special single featuring country stars from the past and present. Joseph Khan was chosen to direct what was described as \"the biggest music video in country music history\". Whilst initially conceived as a single track, Khan had the idea of a mash-up as three songs would cover more of the breadth of country music than a single track. In order to narrow down the options, only CMA song of the year winners were considered, with On the Road Again, Country Roads Take Me Home and I Will Always Love You being chosen. Similarly, only artists who were previous CMA award winners were approached to participate. 29 artists sing on the track with 30 appearing in the music video however, as it was initially unknown how many artists would be able to take part, several of those who agreed early in the development process sang large amounts of all three tracks. The majority of the recording and filming took place in July to coincide with the CMA Music Festival. Upon its release, Forever Country debuted at number 1 on the Billboard Hot Country chart, becoming only the third song in history to do so. In a rare display, the rival Academy of Country Music Awards bestowed the Video of the Year Award to the CMA and Forever Country. Artists Featured: Brad Paisley, Keith Urban, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill, Little Big Town, Luke Bryan, Miranda Lambert, Randy Travis, Blake Shelton, George Strait, Kacey Musgraves, Charley Pride, Ronnie Milsap, Eric Church, Dierks Bentley, Trisha Yearwood, Lady Antebellum, Darius Rucker, Jason Aldean, Rascal Flatts, Willie Nelson, Brooks & Dunn, Alabama, Brett Eldredge, Reba McEntire, Alan Jackson, Vince Gill, Carrie Underwood, Martina McBride and Dolly Parton.
