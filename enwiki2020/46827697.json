He wrote Britain's Slave Trade for Channel 4 Books to accompany the channel's television documentary Windrush, a novel, Incomparable World, charting the progress of three black exiles living in 18th-century London, and has written works of fiction for children to widen the consciousness and knowledge of the slave trade.

Martin's work is focused on Black British history and literature. In particular he wished to redress the lack of published history on the presence of black people in Britain before the arrival of HMT Windrush in 1948. His subsequent journalism, teaching, writing and scholarly work has addressed that lacuna, including his walking tours of London demonstrating \"500 Years of Black London\". Martin's first novel, Incomparable World (1988), charts the fate of three black exiles living in 18th-century London. His work of non-fiction, Britain's Slave Trade, was written for Channel 4 to tie in with its four-part documentary series, Windrush, produced by Trevor Phillips.

It tells a contradictory tale of privilege and dispossession of a boy who lives at the African Academy in Clapham, London in 1800, the son of a wealthy Sierra Leone family.
