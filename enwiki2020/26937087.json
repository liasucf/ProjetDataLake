Not all the Hispanics who fought in the American Civil War were \"Hispanic-Americans\", in other words citizens of the United States. Many of them were Spanish subjects or nationals from countries in the Caribbean, Central and South America. Some were born in a US Territory and therefore did not have the right to US Citizenship. It is estimated that approximately 3,500 Hispanics, mostly Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans and Cubans (Puerto Rico and Cuba were Spanish colonies) living in the United States joined the war: 2,500 for the Confederacy and 1,000 for the Union. This number increased to 10,000 by the end of the war. Hispanic is an ethnic term employed to categorize any citizen or resident of the United States, of any racial background, of any country, and of any religion, who has at least one ancestor from the people of Spain or is of non-Hispanic origin, but has an ancestor from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, Central or South America, or some other Hispanic origin. The three largest Hispanic groups in the United States are the Mexican-Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans.Hispanic Population of the United States Current Population Survey Definition and Background , United States Census Bureau, Population Division, Ethnic & Hispanic Statistics Branch, Retrieved May 21, 2008 The Union Army was the land force that fought for the Union during the American Civil War. It was also known as the \"Federal Army\", the \"U.S. Army\", the \"Northern Army\" and the \"National Army\".See, for example, usage in Grant, Preface p. 3. It consisted of the small United States Army (the regular army), augmented by massive numbers of units supplied by the Northern states, composed of volunteers as well as conscripts. The \"New Mexico Volunteer Infantry\", with 157 Hispanics officers, was the Union unit with the most officers of that ethnic background. Besides Colonel Miguel E. Pino and Lieutenant Colonel Jose Maria Valdez who belonged to the 2nd New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, the New Mexico Volunteer Infantry also included Colonel Diego Archuleta (eventually promoted to Brig. Gen.), the commanding officer of the First New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Jose G. Gallegos commander of the Third New Mexico Volunteer Infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel Francisco Perea, who commanded Perea's Militia Battalion.MILITARY ORDER OF THE LOYAL LEGION OF THE UNITED STATES Another unit which was composed of Hispanics was D Company \"The Spanish Company\" of the Garibaldi Guard, 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment. The company served until July 1, 1865, when it was mustered out at Alexandria, Virginia. They lost during its term of service 119 by death from wounds, and 159 by death from accident, imprisonment or disease, of whom 94 died in prison.39th New York State Volunteers; \"Garibaldi Guard\"; 4th D Company; \"The Spanish Company\" The Confederate Congress provided for a Confederate States Army patterned after the United States Army. It was to consist of a large provisional force to exist only in time of war and a small permanent regular army. The provisional, volunteer army was established by an act of the Confederate Congress passed February 28, 1861, one week before the act which established the permanent regular army organization, passed March 6, 1861. Although the two forces were to exist concurrently, little was done to organize the Confederate regular army.Eicher, pp. 70, 66. Amongst the Confederate units, who either had a significant number of Hispanics or were composed entirely of Hispanics were the 5th Regiment (Spanish Regiment) of the \"European Brigade\", \"Cazadores Espanoles Regiment\" and the \"Louisiana Tigers\", all from Louisiana; the \"Spanish Guards\" and the \"55th Infantry\" both from Alabama and \"Florida's 2nd Infantry\".

Farragut's greatest victory was the Battle of Mobile Bay on August 5, 1864. Mobile, Alabama at the time was the Confederacy's last major port open on the Gulf of Mexico. The bay was heavily mined with tethered naval mines, also known as torpedoes. When the USS Tecumseh, one of the ships under his command, struck a mine and went down, Farragut shouted through a trumpet from his flagship to the , \"What's the trouble?\" \"Torpedoes!\" was the reply, to which Farragut then shouted his now famous words \"Damn the torpedoes!

President Jefferson Davis declined promotion requests for the rank of Brigadier General six times. It is believed that neither Gonzales's early experience with Cuban filibusters, without success, nor his contentious relationships with Confederate officers in Richmond were aiding him; but most likely Davis' dislike for P. G. T. Beauregard, who was a schoolmate of Gonzalez and the proponent of several of the requests, didn't help either.\"Cuban Confederate Colonel: The Life of Ambrosio Jose Gonzales\"; By Antonio Rafael de la Cova; The University of South Carolina Press; . *Colonel Leonidas M.

Most of the former soldiers went home and returned to the civilian activities that they had prior to the war. Others continued in the military and joined the regular Army and Navy. Among the notable Hispanics who served in the war and who continued in the military was Admiral David Farragut. Farragut was promoted to admiral on July 25, 1866.Shippen, Edward (1883). \"Naval Battles, Ancient and Modern\". J.C. McCurdy & co.. pp. 638.

Both brothers, Colonel Federico and Captain Adolfo Fern\u00e1ndez Cavada were named US consuls in Cuba. Federico was appointed United States consul at Trinidad and his brother Adolfo appointed United States consul at Cienfuegos. Both brothers resigned their positions upon the Cuban insurrection against Spanish rule that became known as Cuba's Ten Years' War (1868\u20131878). Together they joined the insurgents and Federico was named General for the District of Trinidad, Commander in Chief of the Cinco Villas. On April 4, 1870, Federico Fern\u00e1ndez Cavada was named Commander-in-Chief of all the Cuban forces. Federico was captured by the Spanish gunboat \"Neptuno\" in 1871 and taken to Puerto Principe.
