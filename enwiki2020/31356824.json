In 1904 further approval enabled construction of a 39 km line to Cattle Creek, later renamed Bell after Lands Minister Sir Joshua Peter Bell. The branch opened for business on 10 April 1906 and stops were established at Bonyumba, Sanatorium, Mocatta's Corner, Moffatt, Kaimkillenbun, Squaretop, Warmga and Koondai-i. A daily service was initially provided, a thrice-weekly service sufficed by 1923 and a rail motor service prevailed between 1928 and 1956. During its time, goods transport was prolific. Farm produce was the initial mainstay but later cream traffic increased as did the carriage of wheat and timber from the Bunya Mountains. The line was mothballed on 1 January 1994. The Bell station precinct has been restored and houses an historical display. == References == ==External links== * 1925 map of the Queensland railway system Category:Closed railway lines in Queensland Category:Railway lines opened in 1906 Category:Railway lines closed in 1994 Category:Darling Downs Category:1906 establishments in Australia Category:1994 disestablishments in Australia ",
