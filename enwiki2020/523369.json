He was best known for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in a series of films and in the radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes (starring Basil Rathbone as Sherlock Holmes). Bruce is also remembered for his roles in the Alfred Hitchcock films Rebecca and Suspicion. ==Early life== William Nigel Ernle Bruce pictured in the Abingdon School first XI cricket team in 1912 Bruce was the second son of Sir William Waller Bruce, 10th Baronet (1856\u20131912) and his wife Angelica Lady Bruce (died 1917), daughter of General George Selby, Royal Artillery. He was born in Ensenada, Baja California, Mexico, whilst his parents were residing there. His older brother was the author and adventurer Sir Michael Bruce. He received his formal education at The Grange School in Stevenage, and from 1908 to 1912 at Abingdon School in Abingdon-on-Thames. At Abingdon he was a keen sportsman, playing for the first XI cricket team (for which he received Colours), the athletics' first team and the school's football 2nd XI. In 1912, Bruce left school at the age of 17, and took up a position as a stockbroker's clerk in the City of London.Abingdon School register entry for Bruce. In early 1914, whilst working in the City he voluntarily enlisted into the British Army's Territorial Force as an infantry soldier with the Honourable Artillery Company as its Private #852. On the outbreak of World War 1 in early August 1914, he was mobilized with the regiment, and went out to the Western Front with its 1st Battalion on 18 September 1914 at the age of 19.Bruce's WW1 Medal Index Card, The National Archive, Kew, Surrey, England. Archive document code: WO 372/3/140620. On 5 January 1915, whilst in trenches at Kemmel in Belgium, he was machine-gunned in the legs, causing multiple wounds and a fractured right thigh, and was subsequently medically evacuated to the United Kingdom, where he spent the rest of 1915 recovering in hospital. He was discharged from the British Army as medically unfit for further military service due to permanent damage to his legs in December 1915. In October 1916, he re-enlisted with the British Army and received training with an Officer Cadet Battalion in Cambridge, subsequently receiving a commission in January 1917, as a subaltern with the 10th (Service) Battalion, of the Somerset Light Infantry Regiment, a home service battalion, with which he served as a training officer for the rest of 1917, the permanent infirmity of his 1915 wounds preventing further active service at the front.'Famous 1914\u20131918', by Richard Van Emden & Vic Piuk (Pub. Pen & Sword, 2009). ==Career== After being discharged from the British Army, Bruce abandoned a career in the City of London Stock Exchange, and pursued a career as a professional actor. He made his stage debut on 12 May 1920 at London's Comedy Theatre as a footman in the play Why Marry?. In October of that year, he went to Canada as stage manager to Henry V. Esmond and Eva Moore, also playing \"Montague Jordan\" in Eliza Comes to Stay. Upon returning to England, he toured in the same role. He appeared regularly on-stage thereafter, and 8 years later began working in silent films. In 1934, he moved to Hollywood, U.S., as his career there became a success he set up a home at 701 North Alpine Drive, Beverly Hills in the latter half of the 1930s. Bruce typically played buffoonish, fuzzy-minded gentlemen. During his film career, he worked in 78 films, including Treasure Island (1934), The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), Rebecca (1940), and Suspicion (1941). He appeared in two landmark films: Becky Sharp (1935), the first feature film in full Technicolor, and Bwana Devil (1952), the first 3-D feature. He uncharacteristically played a detestable figure in The Rains Came (1939) which became the first film to win an Oscar for special effects. ==Dr. Watson== L. to R.: Nigel Bruce, Evelyn Ankers, and Basil Rathbone from the film Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror (1942) Bruce's career signature role was that of Dr. Watson in the 1939\u20131946 Sherlock Holmes film series, alongside his friend Basil Rathbone playing Holmes. Bruce starred as Watson in all 14 films of the series, and over 200 radio programs of The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Although Watson often appears to be the older of the two main characters, Bruce was three years younger than Rathbone. Though for most viewers Nigel Bruce formed their vision of Dr. Watson, Holmes purists have long objected that the Watson of the books was intelligent and capable (although not an outstanding detective), and that Bruce's portrayal made Watson intellectually dimmer and more bumbling than the literary figure. (A nickname resulting from this portrayal was \"Boobus Britannicus.\") Loren D. Estleman wrote of Bruce: Rathbone, however, spoke highly of Bruce's portrayal, saying that Watson was one of the screen's most lovable characters. The historian David Parkinson wrote that Bruce's \"avuncular presence provided the perfect counterbalance to Rathbone's briskly omniscient sleuth\". Historian Alan Barnes notes that, despite the criticisms against him, Bruce rehabilitated Watson, who had been a marginal figure in the cinematic Holmes canon to that point: \"after Bruce, it would be a near-unthinkable heresy to show Holmes without him\". The Rathbone-Bruce co-star film series lapsed with the death of its producer-director Roy William Neill in 1946. Since then, most major modern adaptations of Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, especially since the 1970s, have consciously defied the popular stereotype, and depicted Watson faithfully as a capable man of action. ==Family== Bruce was married from 1921, until his death, to British actress Violet Campbell (n\u00e9e Violet Pauline Shelton; 1892\u20131970) whom he always lovingly called \"Bunny\"; they had two daughters: * Jennifer, married in 1944 (divorced in 1946) Jay Gould III, son of Jay Gould II; * Pauline, married in 1946 the British flying ace Alan Geoffrey Page. ==Later life== Bruce, known as \"Willie\" to his friends, was a leading member of the British film colony in Los Angeles, and was captain of the (mostly British) Hollywood Cricket Club. Unlike some of his contemporaries, and along with other British actors such as Basil Rathbone and Charlie Chaplin, Bruce maintained his British citizenship, despite long residence in the United States. He also retained his membership of London's Garrick Club and Buck's Club until his death. His final film, World for Ransom, was released posthumously in 1954. ==Death== Bruce died of a heart attack,Turner Classic Movies in Santa Monica, California in 1953 at the age of 58. His body was subsequently cremated, with his ashes being placed in a niche at the Chapel of the Pines Crematory in Los Angeles.'Famous 1914\u20131918', by Richard Van Emden & Vic Piuk (Pub. Pen & Sword, 2009). He wrote an autobiography titled 'Games, Gossip and Greasepaint', which is unpublished; however, excerpts have been printed in the Sherlock Holmes Journal, and these have been posted online with permission. ==Filmography== {| class=wikitable width=62% ! width=2%|Year !! width=30%|Title !! width=30%|Role !! width=20%|Notes |- | 1922 || Flames of Passion || Undetermined minor role || Uncredited |- | rowspan=4|1930 || The Squeaker || Collie || |- | Escape || Constable || |- | Red Aces || Kinsfeather, T.B. || |- | Birds of Prey || Major || |- | 1931 || The Calendar || Lord Willie Panniford || |- | rowspan=2|1932 || Lord Camber's Ladies || Lord Camber || |- | The Midshipmaid || Major Spink || |- | rowspan=2|1933 || I Was a Spy || Scottie || |- | Channel Crossing || Nigel Guthrie || |- | rowspan=7|1934 || Coming Out Party || Troon, the Butler || |- | Stand Up and Cheer! || Eustis Dinwiddle || |- | Murder in Trinidad || Bertram Lynch || |- | The Lady Is Willing || Welton || |- | Treasure Island || Squire Trelawney || |- | Springtime for Henry || Johnny Jewlliwell || |- | The Scarlet Pimpernel || The Prince of Wales || |- | rowspan=4|1935 || Becky Sharp || Joseph Sedley || |- | She || Horace Holly || |- | Jalna || Maurice Vaughn || |- | The Man Who Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo || Ivan || |- | rowspan=6|1936 || The Trail of the Lonesome Pine || Major Thurber || |- | Under Two Flags || Capt.
