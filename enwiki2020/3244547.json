A post-graduate in literature from Punjab University, Chandigarh and a graduate from the National School of Drama (Delhi) in 1987, Vashisht was for several years (1990\u20132010) also visiting faculty to some of the premier design, film and theatre institutes of India \u2013 the NIFT (Delhi), FTII (Pune), NSD (Delhi) and the NID (Ahmedabad). She has also conducted theatre workshops in the UK (London, Birmingham, Leicester) and in Damascus. She teaches students of fashion design, film direction and acting, using theatre techniques.

She was the executive producer of the film The Name of a River, a BFI (London) - NFDC (India) - Bangladesh film co-production. In June 2001, Vashisht established Mandala, space for arts collaborations research and education. Its aim was to spearhead a new movement in the arts, to centre stage and individuate the performing arts in society (she considers that imperative, in the face of an electronic media onslaught) and to aid artistic collaborations. Her first project under Mandala however took an unusual twist. A chance theatre workshop that she conducted with trafficked minors in a remand home in Mumbai led to four years of her full-time involvement with the cause of self- empowerment and rehabilitation of trafficked minors. (trafficked minors i.e. minor girls rescued from prostitution from the city brothels). As artistic director of Mandala she created Mandala TAM (theatre arts module), a methodology and a training process based on the performing arts that proved to be highly successful in helping the trafficked minors to heal and transform mentally, physically, emotionally and intellectually. In wanting to mainstream the marginalized she created a theatre troupe of the trafficked young women who performed the comedy play 'the coffin is too big for the grave' to national and international audiences and at international theatre festivals). ===Theatre=== She has performed in the 75 minute solo theatre performance Lal Ded, based on the life and poetry of the iconic woman mystic and poet of Kashmir Lal Ded.
