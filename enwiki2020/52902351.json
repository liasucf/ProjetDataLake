A total of 32 teams competed in the group stage to decide the 16 places in the final stages of the 2017 Copa Libertadores. ==Draw== The draw for the group stage was held on 21 December 2016, 20:00 PYST (UTC\u22123), at the CONMEBOL Convention Centre in Luque, Paraguay. Teams were seeded by their CONMEBOL ranking of the Copa Libertadores (shown in parentheses), taking into account of the following three factors: #Performance in the last 10 years, taking into account Copa Libertadores results in the period 2007\u20132016 #Historical coefficient, taking into account Copa Libertadores results in the period 1960\u20132006 #Local tournament champion, with bonus points awarded to domestic league champions of the last 10 years For the group stage, the 32 teams were drawn into eight groups (Groups 1\u20138) of four containing a team from each of the four pots. Teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same group, excluding the winners of the third stage, which were allocated to Pot 4 and whose identity was not known at the time of the draw, and could be drawn into the same group with another team from the same association. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Group stage draw |- !Pot 1 !Pot 2 !Pot 3 !Pot 4 |- |valign=top| |valign=top| |valign=top| |valign=top| |} ;Notes The following were the four winners of the third stage of qualifying which joined the 28 direct entrants in the group stage. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Match !Third stage winners |- !G1 | Atl\u00e9tico Paranaense (71) |- !G2 | Botafogo (79) |- !G3 | The Strongest (28) |- !G4 | Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n (no rank) |} ==Format== In the group stage, each group was played on a home-and-away round-robin basis.
