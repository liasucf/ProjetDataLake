    "text": "Zapata Formation () is a sedimentary formation of Lower Cretaceous age in the Magallanes or Austral Basin of Argentina and Chile. Much of the formation is folded and faulted as consequence of the Andean orogeny.Fildani et al., 2008 In outcrops of the Zapata Formation near Torres del Paine, the southernmost fossil of the ichthyosaur genus Platypterygius has been found.Pardo P\u00e9rez et al., 2012P\u00e1ramo, 2018, p.16 == References == === Bibliography === * Fildani, Andrea, Romans, B.W., Fosdick, J.C., Crane, W.H., and Hubbard, S.M.
