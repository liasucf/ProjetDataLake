He appears as the drag-diva persona Chi Chi LaRue (), and has also been credited as director under the names \"Lawrence David\" and \"Taylor Hudson\". == Career == \"Chi Chi LaRue\" began when Paciotti moved to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul area and began performing in drag as one-half of \"The Weather Gals\", a \"hag drag\" revue.http://www.trumansays.com/2007/04/being_closeted_.html He and a friend moved to California, where LaRue was hired by Catalina Video as an administrative assistant and publicist because of his knowledge of porn and the workings of the porn industry. Even as a \"DJ\" (\"DJ Paciotti\"), Paciotti conducts most public business as \"Chi Chi LaRue\", and has a significant presence in the pornographic film industry, moving up the line of responsibility and creativity so that he was soon directing high-demand pornographic product. LaRue has directed hundreds of gay porn films since 1988, mainly for Falcon Studios. He now owns Catalina Video, a label under his umbrella company Channel 1 Releasing. In 2003, LaRue began to divide his directorial attention between two porn studios: Vivid Video, where he gets along with much of the female talent (particularly Jenna Jameson and Tera Patrick), and his own Rascal Video. In March 2004, LaRue was preparing to leave to travel to London to direct Taking Flight (the studio's two-part annual travelogue) when he had a mild heart attack. Instead of abandoning the production, Falcon hired Chris Steele, the script's author, to direct. In 2005, LaRue shot his last film for Falcon, called Heaven to Hell (the tale of an angel sexually tempted by the Devil and then cast into hell). It was the only movie ever to be cast of Falcon exclusives.Jeffrey Escoffier In 2006, LaRue announced that he would no longer produce films for Vivid Video because they were featuring actors and actresses having sex without condoms.\"Chi Chi LaRue leaves Vivid\" In 2007, LaRue was chosen as one of Out magazine's Top 50 most influential people in the LGBT community.
