    "text": "This is a list of destroyed heritage of the United States. The year of demolition is marked in parentheses. This is a list of cultural-heritage sites that have been damaged or destroyed accidentally, deliberately, or by a natural disaster, sorted by state. Only those buildings and structures which fulfill Wikipedia's standards of notability should be included. The simplest test of this is whether the building or structure has its own article page. Cultural heritage can be subdivided into two main types\u2014tangible and intangible heritage. The former includes built heritage such as religious buildings, museums, monuments, and archaeological sites, as well as movable heritage such as works of art and manuscripts. Intangible cultural heritage includes customs, music, fashion and other traditions within a particular culture. This article mainly deals with the destruction of built heritage; the destruction of movable collectable heritage is dealt with in art destruction, whilst the destruction of movable industrial heritage remains almost totally ignored. == California == * International Savings & Exchange Bank Building (1954) * Richfield Tower (1929) == District of Columbia == * Raleigh Hotel (1964) Chicago Federal Building == Illinois == * Chicago Federal Building (1965) * Garrick Theater (1961) * Home Insurance Building * Masonic Temple (1939) == Michigan == * Detroit City Hall (1961) * J.
