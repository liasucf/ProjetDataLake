The 2012 film Tar related aspects of Williams' life using his poetry. ==Life== The American poet C.K. Williams was born in Newark, New Jersey, on November 4, 1936. His parents were Paul B. Williams and Dossie Kasdin. His grandparents came to the USA from Kiev, then a Russian city, and Lvov, Ukraine. He went to Columbia High School in Maplewood, attended Bucknell University for one year, then moved on to and graduated from the University of Pennsylvania. He started writing poetry during his second year at Penn, and half-way through junior year he left for Paris. At that time he wrote \u201cI fell into a period of lacerating loneliness. I\u2019d always been a little shy but now something, maybe my uncertainty about my identity as a poet, my sense of being a pretender, made me all but mute with strangers : I used to stay all day in my hotel room, reading, trying to write, then I\u2019d go out to eat by myself, and take endless, anguished walks.\u201d Williams, C.K. (1997) Contemporary Authors, Autobiography Series, Vol. 26, GALE (Shelly Andrews, editor) When he returned to Penn, he switched major from philosophy to English. He studied poetry with Morse Peckham, who also mentioned that T.S. Eliot had written that if you wanted to be a poet, you had to write poetry every day, a recommendation Williams applied in his writing life. C.K. Williams passport ID photo taken on Greek island of Patmos in 1973 After graduating from Penn, he stayed in Philadelphia. His circle of friends included artists, carpenters, poets, a famous sociologist, photographers, musicians and film makers. He spent time with young architects who worked for Louis Kahn, and later wrote: \u201cI realized that my image of the artist\u2019s calling had come almost entirely from Kahn: he was absolutely devoted to his craft, and expected the same dedication from everyone else.\u201d He published his first book, Lies, in 1969. In 1963 he married Sarah Dean Jones, a printer who worked for Eugene Feldman at the Falcon Press in Philadelphia. The marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter, Jessie Williams Burns, founded Tursulowe Press in Philadelphia. In 1973 he met Catherine Mauger. They married in 1975 and had a son, Jed Williams, a painter and the owner of an art gallery in Philadelphia. His paintings are often featured on the covers of Williams\u2019 books. Catherine and C.K. lived part of the year in the USA, and part of the year in Paris, France, and later in Normandy. Williams began teaching in the mid 70\u2019s at the YM-YMHA in Philadelphia. He also worked as an assistant group therapist. He taught creative writing at different universities, among them, Franklin and Marshall, the University of California at Irvine, Boston University, Brooklyn College, Columbia University, George Mason University and, starting in 1996, Princeton University. He traveled across the country, and out of the country, giving readings and poetry workshops. He also worked on translations, notably of two Greek tragedies. After publishing his second book, I Am the Bitter Name, Williams said that he had felt like giving up writing. Then he was asked to read at a college of art in Philadelphia, and he decided to read some unfinished poems: \u201c and I was astonished to realize that they were exactly what I\u2019d been waiting for, though I hadn\u2019t known I\u2019d been waiting for anything at all. The poems were long, ragged lines, they had a much more conversational tone than the poems I\u2019d been writing. Most importantly, the new poems, while having a much more narrative structure than the older ones, also had much more direct mechanisms for tracing thoughts, perceptions and emotions ; they gave me a way to deal more inclusively and exhaustively with my own mind than the poems I\u2019d been writing until then. I began to write poetry again, with more conviction than ever, and more confidence, more of a sense of what I wanted to do (\u2026) The scope of the poems, the certainty they gave me that I could deal thoroughly with themes that interested me, were enough to keep me going. They are the poems that were collected in With Ignorance and Tar.\u201d C.K. Williams became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 2003. He had a wide circle of friends in the U.S. and in Europe, many of them artists and writers. He gave a last reading and interview at Drew University in June 2015. He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in the summer of 2013. He died at home in Hopewell, New Jersey on September 20, 2015.Princeton University - C.K. Williams, distinguished poet and \u201cgreat mentor\u201d, dies at 78 C.K. Williams obituary Twenty days earlier, he had finished working on the manuscript of his last book of poems, Falling Ill. ==Works== His first book, Lies', was published in 1969, and he published many collections of poetry. His Collected Poems appeared in 2006, of which Peter Campion wrote in The Boston Globe: \u201cThroughout the five decades represented in his new Collected Poems, Williams has maintained the most sincere, and largest, ambitions. Like Yeats and Lowell before him, he writes from the borderland between private and public life\u2026(His poems) join skeptical intelligence and emotional sincerity, to make sense of the world and ourselves. C.K. Williams has set a new standard for American poetry.\" His book Repair won the Pulitzer Prize in 2000, and in 2003 The Singing won the National Book Award. He also wrote essays, plays, children books and worked on translations. His last book of poetry, Falling Ill, was published in 2017, after his death. ==Publications== C. K.
