Irma in her fern glasshouse at the John Innes Horticultural Institute == Education == Irma graduated from the University of Stockholm. In 1919 she wrote to William Bateson and joined the then John Innes Horticultural Institution (now the John Innes Centre) as a volunteer worker, where later she was appointed as a student. From 1934-38 she undertook her PhD at the University of London. == Research == Irma studied inheritance in ferns and was the first to introduce the use of an agar-based growth medium for the experimental study of fern gametophytes. Her study of apospory and polyploid series in Scolopendrium was important in understanding the origin and development of the alternation of generations, a key concept in plant development. She was invited to join the join the British Pteridological Society as an honour member but elected to join as an honour subscribing member. After her time in the UK studying British ferns, she returned to Sweden to work at Wenner-Gren Institut, Stockholm. More recently some of her hypothesis on the dominance of certain alleles in ferns were confirmed experimentally. == References == Category:Stockholm University alumni Category:1895 births Category:Year of death missing Category:Swedish geneticists Category:Swedish women botanists Category:20th-century Swedish scientists Category:Alumni of the University of London Category:Date of death unknown Category:Women geneticists Category:Swedish expatriates in the United Kingdom ",
