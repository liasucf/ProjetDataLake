    "text": "Gheorghe Moro\u0219anu (born April 30, 1950, in Darabani, Boto\u0219ani County) is a Romanian mathematician known for his works in ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations and other branches of mathematics. He earned his Ph.D. in 1981 from Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, in Ia\u0219i. He is currently affiliated with Babe\u0219-Bolyai University, in Cluj-Napoca. Between 2002 and 2017 he was a professor at the Central European University in Budapest (an international English-language university, accredited in the USA), after previously holding positions at the University of Stuttgart and Alexandru Ioan Cuza University. Among several administrative positions, he served as chairman of the Mathematics Department of the Central European University during the period 2004-2012. In 2008 he was appointed as egyetemi tan\u00e1r (the highest academic title in Hungarian higher education) by the President of Hungary.Gheorghe Moro\u0219anu appointed as egyetemi tan\u00e1r by the President of Hungary (L\u00e1szl\u00f3 S\u00f3lyom); see page 2490, retrieved April 1, 2015 Before his university studies, during the 12-year period of education from primary to high school (1957-1969), Moro\u0219anu was at the top of his class each academic year and demonstrated a keen interest in mathematics. In 1969 he started studying mathematics at Alexandru Ioan Cuza University in Ia\u015fi. He was the first to earn a Ph.D. of his class of over 150 graduates. His dissertation Qualitative Problems for Nonlinear Differential Equations of Accretive Type in Banach Spaces included original results published in top-ranked journals, such as Atti della Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Journal of Differential Equations, Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, Nonlinear Analysis, Numerical Functional Analysis and Optimization. Moro\u0219anu is the author and co-author of a great number of research articles and several textbooks and monographs.Moro\u0219anu's Publications in MathSciNet, MathSciNet, American Mathematical Society, retrieved April 1, 2015 His monograph on nonlinear evolution equations is mainly focused on the stability theory for such equations. In the preface of this monograph, Professor Michiel Hazewinkel (Series Editor) states that > the theory of stability of ordinary differential equations contains the > germs for a theory of stability of nonlinear evolution semigroups ... This > book is devoted to a self-contained systematic exposition of these matters > and incorporates many of the author's own substantial results in the field. This book has been followed by a series of related papers, including his articles on second-order evolution equations governed by monotone operators. These publications provide a complete answer to the long-standing existence question in the non-homogeneous case. Both his joint monograph on functional methods and that on singular perturbations contain original material mostly due to the authors, bringing new ideas and methods that are useful in exploring mathematical models described by linear and nonlinear differential equations. In particular the book on singular perturbations combines results from different parts of mathematics to offer a detailed asymptotic analysis of some important classes of singularly perturbed boundary value problems which are mathematical models for various phenomena in biology, chemistry, engineering. This book has been followed by some related joint papers on abstract semilinear and fully nonlinear evolution equations with significant applications. Moro\u0219anu has also works in Calculus of Variations, Fluid Mechanics, etc.Moro\u0219anu's Research Areas MathSciNet, American Mathematical Society, retrieved April 1, 2015 More specifically, his legacy of contributions concerns (but is not limited to) the following topics: \u2022 first and second-order evolution equations in Hilbert spaces; \u2022 initial-boundary value problems for parabolic and hyperbolic partial differential equations and systems (existence, high regularity, stability of solutions, time periodic solutions); \u2022 singular perturbation theory for nonlinear partial differential equations and semilinear evolution equations in Hilbert spaces; \u2022 boundary value problems for elliptic equations, including equations involving p-Laplacians, related eigenvalue problems; \u2022 nonlinear ordinary differential equations, integro-differential equations, delay differential equations, equations involving ordinary p-Laplacians; \u2022 monotone operators, nonlinear differential operators; \u2022 difference equations in Hilbert spaces, including proximal point algorithms; \u2022 the Fourier method for solving abstract evolution equations; \u2022 optimization, input identifiability, optimal control; \u2022 applications in acoustics, capillarity theory, diffusion processes, fluid flows, hydraulics, integrated circuits, mathematical biology and ecology, nonlinear oscillators, phase field equations, self-organized systems, telegraph systems, etc. In 1983 he was awarded the Gheorghe Laz\u0103r Prize of the Romanian Academy in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the theory of hyperbolic partial differential equations. He holds honorary doctorates from the University of Craiova, Craiova, Romania and from Ovidius University, Constan\u021ba, Romania. In 2019, he received the title of Professor Honoris Causa from the Babe\u0219-Bolyai University, Cluj-Napoca, RomaniaDoctors and Professors Honoris Causa, retrieved May 5, 2019 A school (in Darabani) Moro\u0219anu himself attended between 1957 and 1965 has been named after him since 2007, when he also received the title of honorary citizen of Darabani in recognition of his accomplishments.List of Schools 2014-2015, Ministry of National Education, Boto\u0219ani County (Romania); see page 34, line 181, retrieved April 4, 2015Gheorghe Moro\u0219anu honorary citizen of Darabani, retrieved April 5, 2015 == References == == External links == *Personal homepage *Publications Category:Living people Category:1950 births Category:20th-century Romanian mathematicians Category:21st-century Romanian mathematicians Category:People from Darabani Category:Central European University faculty Category:Alexandru Ioan Cuza University faculty Category:Alexandru Ioan Cuza University alumni Category:Babe\u0219-Bolyai University faculty Category:PDE theorists ",
