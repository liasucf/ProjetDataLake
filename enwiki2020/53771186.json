ABC confirmed on May 16, 2017, that the seventh season would be the final season for the show. Shonda Rhimes released a statement about the ending of the show calling the seventh season \"Olivia's Swan Song\" as she said: ====How to Get Away with Murder crossover==== On January 3, 2018, Kerry Washington tweeted out a photo to Viola Davis of herself in a \"familiar\" setting, that being a courthouse used for the set of How to Get Away with Murder. Fans began to speculate a possible crossover episode being in the works, which was only heightened when Davis tweeted out a photo in response, that being her on the set of Mellie Grant's (Bellamy Young) Oval Office. Later that day, the crossover was officially confirmed through a tweet by Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes. How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk later went on to share in an interview with Deadline: ===Casting=== In May 2017, actor George Newbern, who has had recurring appearances since the show's beginning as Charlie, was promoted to the regular cast.
