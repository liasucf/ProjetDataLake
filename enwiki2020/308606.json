    "text": "Chonburi (, , ) is a province of Thailand (changwat) located in eastern Thailand. Its capital is also named Chonburi. Neighbouring provinces are (clockwise from north) Chachoengsao, Chanthaburi, and Rayong, while the Gulf of Thailand is to the west. Pattaya, a major tourism destination in Thailand, is located in Chonburi, along with Laem Chabang, the country's primary seaport. The population of the province has grown rapidly and now totals 1.7 million residents, although a large portion of the population is floating or unregistered. The registered population as of 31 December 2018 was 1.535 million. ==Toponymy== The word chon originates from the Sanskrit word \u091c\u0932; jala meaning 'water', and the word buri from Sanskrit \u092a\u0941\u0930\u093f; puri meaning 'town' or 'city', hence the name of the province means 'city of water'. == History == Chonburi has been recognized since the Dvaravati Period and during the reigns of the Khmer Empire and the Sukhothai Kingdom. Chonburi was initially only a small agricultural town and fishing community, but during the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1350-1767), Chonburi was classified as a commodore class city. On the Triphum map, it appeared along with more major towns such as Bangsai (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e17\u0e23\u0e32\u0e22; now a sub-district of Chonburi), Bangplasoi (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e25\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22; now a downtown area in Chonburi), Bangphrarua (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d; now a sub-district of Si Racha), and Banglamung (\u0e1a\u0e32\u0e07\u0e25\u0e30\u0e21\u0e38\u0e07; now a district of Chonburi). Although it was a small town, it enriched the natural resources both on land and at sea. Moreover, those in Chonburi contacted the Chinese sailors, who came to trade with Siam. === Prehistoric === Chonburi has been settled since the prehistoric period. An important Neolithic town, Khok Phanom Di (\u0e1a\u0e23\u0e34\u0e40\u0e27\u0e13\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e25\u0e38\u0e48\u0e21\u0e23\u0e34\u0e21\u0e1d\u0e31\u0e48\u0e07\u0e41\u0e21\u0e48\u0e19\u0e49\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e19\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07; now Phanthong and Phanat Nikhom) located in the Phanthong river lowlands, was found by archaeologists in 1979. Beads, bracelets, patterned pottery and polished stone axes to harvest and hunting were all found. It is supposed that the Chonburi area was the site of prosperous ancient towns such as Phra Rot, Sri Phalo and Phaya Rae. === Historic === ==== Rattanakosin Period ==== In the reign of King Nangklao, Rama III, Phra Intha-asa , The Governor of Phanat Nikhom I (Princely member of Nakhon Phanom royal family) took many immigrants (Nakhon Phanom Laotians, Named Lao Asa Pak Nam) from Samut Prakan and New Nakhon Phanom Laotians to Phanat Nikhom. The Siamese King at the time allowed them to establish a habitat between Chonburi and Chachoengsao (Named Phanat Nikhom in the present). == Symbols == The provincial seal shows the hill Khao Sam Muk, on which there is a sala with a statue of the goddess Chao Mae Sahm Muk, who, it is believed, protects seafarers and the local population. The provincial tree and flower is the New Guinea rosewood (Pterocarpus indicus, called Mai Pradu in Thai). The provincial motto is \"Beautiful beaches, delicious khao lam, sweet sugar cane, delicate basketry products, and buffalo racing.\" == Geography == The province is on the Bay of Bangkok, the northern end of the Gulf of Thailand. The Khao Khiao mountain range stretches from the northwest to the southeast of the province. The plains of the north were long used for farming. Laem Chabang, between Chonburi and Pattaya, is one of the few deep-water harbours of Thailand. The provincial permanent legal population rose at nearly four per cent annually, from 1,040,865 in 2000 to 1,554,365 in 2010.http://www.citypopulation.de/php/thailand-admin.php There is a large floating population of long-term non-Thai residents without permanent status, on a perpetual tourist visa and/or migrant workers (legal or not), as well as heavy, short-term tourist influxes. ==Demographics== ===Religion=== According to a 2015 survey,http://cbi.onab.go.th/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=327&Itemid;=206 Religion in Chonburi around 97.87% of the population of Chonburi practices Buddhism, followed by Islam with 1.56% and Christianity with 0.60%. {|class=\"wikitable\" !Religion !Census 2015 !% |- |style=\"background:#FFFFC0;\"|Buddhism||1,256,081||97.87% |- |style=\"background:#E0FFC0;\"|Islam||20,000||1.56% |- |style=\"background:#E0F0FF;\"|Christianity||7,707||0.60% |- |style=\"background:#F0E0F0;\"|Other religions||800||0.06% |} == Administrative divisions == === Provincial government === Chonburi Province consists of 11 districts (amphoe).
