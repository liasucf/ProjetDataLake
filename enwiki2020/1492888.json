To the north are several productive oilfields (Kursenge, beside the prominent mud volcano of the same name, and Karabaghli, a few km NW) operated (in 2001) by the Salyan Oil company. It also comprises most of the Shirvan National Park. == History == Salyan was a large populated area and attracted the attention of the invaders in the XIII century. Approximate time of settlement is the 15th century. Trade relations of Shirvanshahs with Mugan, Tabriz and Iran were passing through Salyan. For a long time in the XVII-XVIII century trade routes with Iran, the North Caucasus, Turkestan and Russia passed through Salyan. Fish and caviar from Salyan were transported to these cities for sale. In the 18th century silver, copper money was minted in the district. In 1795 Aga Muhammad Shah Gajar attacked Shamakhi and completely ruined Salyan because of the confrontation he showed. In February 1868, the Javad district was established within the Baku province, including Salyan as an administrative unit. Thus Salyan transformed into a cultural center. At the beginning of the 20th century, 3 small cotton ginning enterprises with a capacity of 3-4 tons, small heating power stations, 4 elementary schools and a library were founded here. At that time in the city there were 20 small knitting enterprises, 200 shops, 3 caravan-sheds, 5 trading banks, a ship bridge, a post station, a quarantine station and 11 madrasahs. In the year 1894 the meteorological station was opened in Salyan for the first time in the whole of Southern Russia and the Caucasus. Salyan was also the center of trade, which was located on the Silk Road. Back in the II century AD. merchants from China and India, passing through the current Turkmenbashi (Krasnovodsk) along the sea route, passed through the Caspian depression into the Kura River, the lands of all Azerbaijan, as well as the territory of Salyan, crossed the Rioni River in Georgia, then reached the Poti port on the Black Sea, crossed Black Sea and fell into the Sea of Azov. Salyan for a long time was the educational, cultural center of Mugan and the southeast of Mugan. In 1881 the area of the whole city was 800 acres. Since 1916, Salyan is officially considered a city. ==Etymology == There are many assumptions and theories about the etymology of the word \"Salyan\".

In addition, one of the currents of the Don River, which flows from the plains of Eastern Europe, is called the Sal River. In the past Salyan settlements lived on this territory and were called tribes \"sal\". Historian Memandr, referring to the events of 558, highlights the fact of the war of the Sal tribes in the meadows of Southern Russia with the Turkic tribal association called Avar. According to the assumptions, part of the saloons along with the Avars moved to Azerbaijan. This is indicated by the historian of the XIV century, Hamdullah Gazvi, confirming his words by the fact of the existence of the city of \"Abar\" on the bank of the river Kura. == Geography == Salyan region is located on the Kura-Araks lowland, in the Mugan steppe.
