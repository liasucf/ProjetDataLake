On August 10, a tropical depression formed near Typhoon Virginia and strengthened to a tropical storm later that day, receiving the name Wendy from the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC). The storm continued to intensify as it traveled toward the Japanese archipelago, becoming a typhoon a day after formation. The typhoon peaked with winds of while located south of Japan. Wendy made landfalls in Shikoku and Honshu on August 12, and became extratropical on August 13. The Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) stopped tracking the cyclone on August 15. Wendy caused a large amount of damage in central Japan. The storm flooded thousands of homes and damaged significant tracts of land. Some rivers overflowed and hundreds of bridges were destroyed. Overall, 28 people were killed, and 19 were missing. ==Meteorological history== On August 10, a trough extended southward from Typhoon Virginia, and was detected by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) as having abnormal wind directions compared to Virginia's circulation. The Japanese Meteorological Agency (JMA) designated the system as a tropical depression also at that time, with the pressure reading at . At 12:00 UTC, the JTWC assessed the system had reached tropical storm strength west of Iwo Jima, with winds of . The storm was not given the name Wendy until six hours later, when it was operationally upgraded to a tropical storm. The JMA also upgraded Wendy to a tropical storm at 12:00 UTC. Wendy strengthened to , with a pressure of by August 11 at 00:00 UTC. Operationally, the JTWC upgraded Wendy to a typhoon at 06:00 UTC south of Shikoku, with a reconnaissance flight reporting winds of , but it was revised to 12:00 UTC after analysis. According to the JTWC, Wendy reached peak strength offshore Shikoku, with winds of on August 12 at 00:00 UTC, but the lowest pressure, , was recorded six hours later by the JMA. The typhoon officially made landfall on Shikoku at 08:00 UTC, 39 hours after Virginia made landfall west of the landfall location. Wendy soon made another landfall over southern Honshu later that day, remaining on land for ten hours, and weakening to . After reemerging over the Sea of Japan at 18:00 UTC, the winds strengthened slightly to , and pressure went up to . The storm sped up and made its final landfall over northern Honshu on August 13 at 03:00 UTC, with winds of and pressure of . At 06:00 UTC, the JTWC issued its last advisory on Wendy, as it was no longer a hazard. The JMA declared the storm extratropical at the same time, and the agency continued to track the cyclone until it reached near the International Date Line at 18:00 UTC on August 15. The development of the storm was considered unusual by the JTWC and the United States Weather Bureau (USWB). During most of its duration, Wendy did not sustain a circulation at levels, and formed over an area of upper level convergence. Wendy also developed within the circulation of Virginia, which lead the JTWC to possibly consider Wendy as Virginia's \"offspring\". ==Impact== Wendy caused damage to the Kinki and Ch\u016bbu regions of Japan from August 12 to 13. The typhoon dropped around of rain and winds of were recorded on Shikoku. The floods caused the Nagara River to overflow its banks at four locations, and it also destroyed more than 260 bridges.
