Its nearest higher peak is Cirrus Mountain, to the north. Mount Coleman is situated along the east side the Icefields Parkway midway between Saskatchewan Crossing and Sunwapta Pass. ==History== Mount Coleman was named in 1898 after Arthur P. Coleman (1852-1939), a Canadian geologist and among the first white men to explore the area that is now Jasper National Park. ==Geology== Like other mountains in Banff Park, Mount Coleman is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== 100px Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Mount Coleman is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below -30 \u00b0C.
