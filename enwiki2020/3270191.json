    "text": "Cold is the debut studio album by American rock band Cold. The album produced two singles: \"Go Away\" and \"Give.\" ==Background== Regarding the album's producer Ross Robinson, vocalist Scooter Ward stated \"Ross is, to me, the best metal producer you can get. He just drags the heaviness out of everything, like with Slipknot. It\u2019s amazing what he does. When you record with Ross one time, you gotta give it your all. You have to go off like you would onstage.\"http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003033/Cold.html When they began recording the album in 1997, Cold were known as Grundig. During the recording process, Ward learned that German stereo manufacturer Grundig was trying to sue him and the band for $300,000 over use of its name. Ward reflected \"I thought, what are you talking about? We don't have any money. Everybody was throwing names around. Wes, the Limp Bizkit guitarist, said he had a great idea: Cold. It was the perfect name. It fits the music.\" The album is copyrighted from 1997, despite being released in mid-1998. It was meant to come out on November 18, 1997, but was pushed back. == Track listing == All tracks written by Scooter Ward. ==Release and reception== Upon its release, it was endorsed by Jonathan Davis and Fred Durst, both friends of the band. Davis praised the band as \"scary and weird\", while Durst called the album \"the most real record I've felt in years.\"1997 Give cassette single Allmusic gave the album four out of five stars stating \"Cold's songwriting isn't always great and they're too concerned with adolescent angst and horror (\"Everyone Dies,\" \"Insane,\" \"Serial Killer,\" etc.), but the band's sound is fully formed, resulting in a strong debut.\" Although the album didn't have excellent sales and lacked heavy promotion, it was ranked the 8th best album of 1998 by Kerrang! magazine. A music video was shot for \"Give\" in 1998, featuring cameos by both Davis and Durst. ==Personnel== Cold *Scooter Ward - vocals, guitar, piano, keyboards *Kelly Hayes - guitar *Jeremy Marshall - bass *Sam McCandless - drums Additional musicians *Fred Durst - additional vocals on \"Blame\" and \"Go Away\" *Ross Robinson - additional vocals *Chuck Johnson - additional vocals *Krystal Atkins - female vocal on \"Strip Her Down\" Production and Management *Production and Recording: Ross Robinson *Executive Producer: Jordan Schur *A&R; for Flip: Fred Durst *A&R; for A&M;: Larry Weintraub *Mixed by Terry Date: All tracks except \"Ugly\" and \"Strip Her Down\" *Mixed by Ross Robinson: \"Ugly\" and \"Strip Her Down\" *Engineered by: Richard Kaplan *Assisted by: Chuck Johnson and Rob Agnello *Mastered by: Howie Weinberg ==References== Category:Cold (band) albums Category:1998 debut albums Category:A&M; Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ross Robinson Category:Flip Records (1994) albums ",
