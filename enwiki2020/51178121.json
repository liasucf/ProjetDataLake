    "text": "Romano Bobone (died 1189, Rome) was an Italian cardinal. ==Life== His year and place of birth are unknown, but this is presumed to be Rome, where his family was already well-represented in the Roman Curia. He and cardinal Soffredo were made papal legates to Philip II of France and Henry II of England, negotiating a two-year truce between them. On 21 March 1188, pope Clement III made him cardinal deacon of San Giorgio in Velabro. According to Aubery, he moved to a church in Porto. ==See also== *Catholic Church in Italy ==References== ==External links== *https://books.google.com/books?id=ZrQAAAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA261&lpg;=PA261&dq;=cardinale+bobone+orsini&source;=web&ots;=yWMuhpzfjH&sig;=wH9_wFH92YcqOix0RhzxXKBPG5E&hl;=it *http://www2.fiu.edu/~mirandas/bios1182-ii.htm#Boboni *http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/bonone_(Dizionario_Biografico)/ category:1189 deaths category:Italian cardinals ",
