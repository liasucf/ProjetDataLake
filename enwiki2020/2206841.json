He was Count of Alen\u00e7on and Count of Perche (1325-1346), as well as Count of Chartres and Count of Joigny (1335-1336). In April 1314 he married Jeanne of Joigny, who succeeded her father John II as Countess of Joigny in 1335, but died on 2 September 1336. They had no children. He showed a marked, if foolhardy courage from the time of his first taking up arms (1324, in Aquitaine), and took part in the Battle of Cassel (1328). In December 1336, he married Maria de La Cerda y Lara (1310 - 19 November 1379, Paris), the daughter of Fernando de la Cerda, Lord of Lara.
