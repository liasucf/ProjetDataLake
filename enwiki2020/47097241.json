The film stars Lew Ayres, Louise Campbell, Roscoe Karns, Porter Hall, Edgar Kennedy and Elizabeth Patterson. The film was released on February 11, 1938, by Paramount Pictures. ==Plot== == Cast == ==Reception== Frank Nugent of The New York Times said, \"The fictional half of the Criterion's bill is filled by a well-wrought B-plus melodrama from Paramount, an entertaining tidbit called Scandal Street, which considers, for the 'steenth time, the cruelty, malice and stupidity of small- town gossips. Here it is Louise Campbell who suffers the tongue-lashing and the guilty-until-proved-innocent attitude of Peach-tree Lane's residents when the married Don Juan in the next-door house is found murdered. Fortunately, she has wee Virginia Weidler on her side, as well as right, and the murder outs conveniently. As small-town profiles go, this is as definitive as the next, with penetrating sidelights on the weekly bridge nights, the children's dancing school, amours and civic pride.\" == References == == External links == * Category:1938 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:American drama films Category:1938 drama films Category:American black-and-white films ",
