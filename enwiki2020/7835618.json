The conservation park covers including areas of thick scrub, some steep walking tracks and the heritage-listed remains of a nineteenth century silver and lead mine. Talisker became a conservation park in 1976 after a period of 104 years of intermittent mining activity in the area. The conservation park owes its name to the two McLeod brothers who discovered an outcrop of silver- lead ore while searching for gold in 1862. The Talisker Mining company was formed the same year to extract the ore from the lode the McLeods named the 'Talisker of Scotland' after a locality in their homeland, the 'Isle of Skye'. Land within the conservation park's boundaries is known to be a site for Pterostylis bryophila (Hindmarsh Valley Greenhood), a species of plant which is listed as \"critically endangered\" by the Commonwealth Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \"endangered\" by the South Australian National Parks and Wildlife Act 1972. The conservation park is classified as an IUCN Category VI protected area. == References == ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ==External links== *Talisker Conservation Park webpage on protected planet *Webpage on the BirdsSA website *Talisker Conservation Park on YouTube Category:Conservation parks of South Australia Category:Fleurieu Peninsula Category:1985 establishments in Australia Category:Protected areas established in 1985 ",
