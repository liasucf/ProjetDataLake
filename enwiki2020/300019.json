Marcel Aym\u00e9 (29 March 1902 \u2013 14 October 1967) was a French novelist, children's writer, humour writer, screenwriter and theatre playwright. == Biography == Marcel Aym\u00e9 was born in Joigny, in the Yonne department of Burgundy. He was educated at the Coll\u00e8ge de Dole, then worked as a journalist in Paris, among other things. His first published novel was Br\u00fblebois (1926), and in 1929 his La Table aux crev\u00e9s won the Prix Renaudot. After the great success of his novel La Jument verte (1933), translated into English as The Green Mare, he concentrated mostly on writing and published children's stories, novels, and collections of stories. In 1935 he also started writing movie scripts. In theater, Marcel Aym\u00e9 found success with his plays Lucienne et le boucher, Cl\u00e9rambard (1949), a farce, and T\u00eate des autres (1952), which criticized the death penalty. He died in 1967 and was buried in the Cimeti\u00e8re Saint-Vincent in the Montmartre Quarter of Paris. == Work == One of Aym\u00e9's most famous short stories is \"Le Passe-Muraille\" or \"The Walker-Through-Walls\". A statue in Paris features the story's main character, Dutilleul. At the age of 42, Dutilleul suddenly discovers that he has \"the remarkable gift of being able to pass through walls with perfect ease\". What begins as a novelty that gives him pleasure ends up pushing Dutilleul toward ever more sinister pursuits. == Legacy == His works have inspired a number of movies, television shows, songs and comic strips. Visitors to Paris can see a monument in his honor at Place Marcel-Aym\u00e9, in the Montmartre Quarter. The statue is based upon his short story \"Le passe- muraille\" (\"The Walker through Walls\"). == Novels and short stories == * 1928 Les Jumeaux du diable * 1929 La Table aux crev\u00e9s (novel translated as The Hollow Field) * 1930 Br\u00fblebois * 1930 La Rue sans nom * 1931 Le Vaurien * 1932 Le Puits aux images * 1933 La Jument verte (novel translated as The Green Mare) * 1935 Maison basse (novel translated as The House of Men) * 1934 Le Nain * 1936 Le Moulin de la Sourdine (novel translated as The Secret Stream) * 1936 Derri\u00e8re chez Martin * 1938 Silhouette du scandale * 1938 Gustalin * 1939 Le B\u0153uf clandestine * 1941 La Belle image (novel translated as The Second Face and Beautiful Image) * 1941 La Vouivre * 1941 Travelingue (novel translated as The Miraculous Barber) * 1943 \"Le passe-muraille\" (short story translated as \"The Man Who Walked through Walls\" (Pushkin Press, 2012).
