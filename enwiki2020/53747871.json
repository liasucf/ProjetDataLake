Lost Railways of South Wales. Countryside Books. 2009. p. 86 It was downgraded to 'platform' status in 1906. It is referred to as Swanbridge Halt on a 1921 OS map.Hutton, J. The Taff Vale Railway Volume III. Silver Link. 2006. p. 44 By the postwar years, traffic on the line beyond Penarth was in sharp decline, and the DMU sets which served the line in its last years rarely picked up or delivered more than a few passengers a day at Swanbridge. The platforms originally had shelters, though these were gone by the 1960s. There was also a wooden awning covering the walkway leading up to the platforms, which stayed in position long after the platform buildings had gone.Hutton, J. The Taff Vale Railway Volume III. Silver Link. 2006. p. 43 The disused railway bridge in 2009 The station closed in 1968. The site has mostly been reclaimed by nature. Only the old railway bridge remains.Hutton, J.
