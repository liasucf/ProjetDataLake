    "text": "Fiskavaig Fiskavaig () is a crofting settlement on the west shore of the Minginish peninsula, on the Isle of Skye in the Highlands of Scotland and the council area of Highland. Fiskavaig Bay lies just to the north, the island of Wiay some offshore and the village of Carbost southwest. The name Fiskavaig (alternative name Fiscavaig) originally comes from the Norse, meaning \"fish bay\". Another example of this naming is Tarskavaig, meaning \"cod bay\", in the south of Skye. ==Fiskavaig Stone== Fiskavaig Stone A Class I Pictish symbol stone was found on the beach at the high water mark in 1921. Carved from a slab of schist, the stone bears double disc and Z-rod and crescent and V-rod symbols. It is now on display at the Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. ==References== Category:Populated places in the Isle of Skye ",
