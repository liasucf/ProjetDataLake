    "text": "The Centennial Depot, also known as the Nici Self Historical Museum, was built in 1907 for the Laramie, Hahn's Peak and Pacific Railway in Centennial, Wyoming, United States. In addition to railroad services, the depot housed a post office and, at times, a grocery store. The depot was operated by the Union Pacific Railroad until the early 1970s. Demolition was proposed, but the depot was purchased by the Centennial Valley Historical Association, which moved it a short distance to its present site. It is operated as the Nici Self Museum. The long frame structure has a hipped roof with broad overhanging eaves. A projecting bay, arranged to look down the train line on the original site, is located near one end. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 8, 1982. ==References== ==External links== * Nici Self Historical Museum website * Centennial Depot at the Wyoming State Historic Preservation Office Category:National Register of Historic Places in Albany County, Wyoming Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1907 Category:History museums in Wyoming Category:Union Pacific Railroad stations Category:Railway stations on the National Register of Historic Places in Wyoming Category:1907 establishments in Wyoming ",
