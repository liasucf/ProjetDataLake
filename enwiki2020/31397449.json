    "text": "Two Tahitian Women is an 1899 painting by Paul Gauguin. It depicts two topless women, one holding mango blossoms, on the Pacific Island of Tahiti. The painting is part of the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City and was donated to the museum by William Church Osborn in 1949.Two Tahitian Women - Metropolitan Museum of Art Retrieved July 15, 2012 Although Tahiti is depicted as an innocent paradise, the two women in the painting confront the viewer in a way similar to that in Manet's Le d\u00e9jeuner sur l'herbe (1863) or Olympia (1863), and follow an artistic tradition of comparing woman's breasts to flowers or fruit. The women in the painting also appear in two other works by Gauguin, Faa Iheihe (Tahitian Pastoral) (1898) and Rupe, Rupe (1899). The painting was attacked April 1, 2011, while on loan to the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C. A woman named Susan Burns banged on the painting's plastic cover. Due to the protection of the plexiglass, the painting was not harmed. The woman was \u201cimmediately restrained and detained\u201d by the museum's security guards who charged her with destruction of property and attempted theft. The woman reportedly had \"a lengthy criminal record\" and \"a history of schizophrenia,\" and she was quoted in court papers as having told an investigator after her arrest, \u201cI feel that Gauguin is evil... He has nudity and is bad for the children. He has two women in the painting and it\u2019s very homosexual. I was trying to remove it. I think it should be burned. I am from the American CIA and I have a radio in my head. I am going to kill you.\u201d ==References== ==External links== * Category:1899 paintings Category:Tahitian art Category:Paintings by Paul Gauguin Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art ",
