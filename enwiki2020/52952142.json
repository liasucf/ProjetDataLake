Supported by Syrian troops Jammaz entered Mecca in Ramadan 651 AH (October/November 1253) and deposed and killed Abu Sa'd. However, he reneged on his promise to put al-Nasir's name in the khutbah, and instead continued the khutbah in the name of the Sultan of Yemen, al-Muzaffar Yusuf. On the last day of Dhu al-Hijjah () his uncle Rajih ibn Qatadah took the Emirate from him without resistance, and Jammaz fled to Yanbu. ==Descendants== The later Emirs of Yanbu were from among his progeny. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * Category:13th-century Arabs Category:Sharifs of Mecca Category:Banu Qatadah ",
