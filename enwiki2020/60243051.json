He's a pedantic control freak who dreams of being the first dog on Mars. Unlike Dolly and other puppies, Dylan shows more responsibility and considers himself the leader of the Dalmatian pups. He is very strict about the pups' safety and has a severe cat allergy. He can also be neurotic and gullible, sometimes letting his wild imagination get the better of him. =====Dolly===== Dolly (voiced by Michaela Dietz) is the eldest female dalmatian puppy. She is 12 years old (in human years). She's a rebellious tomboy who has a lot of crazy ideas that end up causing trouble. Dolly is more carefree and adventurous but also irresponsible; yet still tries to be a good helper to her stepbrother Dylan. She likes to perform tricks on her skateboard. She has a crush on a Husky named Hansel. ====Other Main Siblings==== =====Dizzy and Dee Dee===== Dizzy and Dee Dee (voiced by Florrie Wilkinson and Nefeli Karakosta respectively) are a pair of mischievous sister puppies and Dolly's sidekicks.

Her first appearance is seen a bit at the end of \"Better The De Vil You Know\", but after it her full body appearance is finally seen in \"The De Vil Wears Puppies\". In it, she invades the house and scares all the puppies, presumably looking to capture them as she attempted with their ancestors. However, due to her cruel behavior and betraying Hunter, Hunter betrays Cruella and helps the Dalmatain family, she even gets arrested at the end for pet cruelty. ====Hunter De Vil==== Hunter De Vil (voiced by Joshua LeClair) is a is photographer kid, and Cruella de Vil's grandnephew. While Hunter initially appears as a background character, he gains a prominent role in \"The Nose Job\", in which he is revealed to be responsible for the recent vandalism at the park, and congratulates his cat for finding the Dalmatian family. Like Cruella, he has an obsession with Dalmatians. In \"London, We Have a Problem\", he played a bigger role when he befriended Dylan in having a common love for outer space. Hunter kidnapped Dorothy so Dylan could find her and tricked him into leading him to their house. He used a big vacuum to suck the 97 puppies and put them in the trailer and take them to Switzerland, but he was overpowered by Dylan and Dolly who saved the puppies by saying the trigger word \"dinner\". Hunter got himself locked in the trailer and went to Switzerland. He became like a dog version of him self, so Dylan was able to trick him. He later finds out that Cruella was using him and she never loved him. He was aware that she was planning to kill the puppies for the coat. He turned against her and helped save the puppies. ==References== 101 Dalmatian Street 101 Dalmatian Street 101 Dalmatian Street Category:Lists of Disney television series characters ",
