The hill, which is east of the town of Coesfeld (Coesfeld county, North Rhine-Westphalia) is a wide ridge that rises between the streams of the Berkel and the Honigbach, descends towards the west relatively steeply from around to just under in the borough of Coesfeld. It is the hausberg for the town. From the Ludgerirast, the highest point of the hill, there are good views thanks of large parts of the western M\u00fcnsterland thanks to the treeless summit. It is here that, according to Ludgerus (Ludger or Liudger), the first Bishop of M\u00fcnster paused whilst out walking and blessed the M\u00fcnsterland on the evening before his death in Billerbeck.Michael B\u00f6nte in Kirche+Leben dated 30 March 2005: \"Mutig sein\" -Missionarische Gedanken bei Ludgeri-Rast, online at kirchensite.de The Dreilindenh\u00f6he, with the three lime trees (Tilia europaea that give it the nameGIS portal of the county of Coesfeld, is a natural monument with the designation CO 02) and a viewing point on the hillside above the town of Coesfeld. In a scenic side valley south of the Ludgerirast, at a height of 125 metres, is the Benedictine abbey of Gerleve. According to legend, St. Liudger blessed the Bishopric of M\u00fcnster, that he had founded, from the highest point of the hill on the evening before his death. This is commemorated by a monument erected in 1934 by Brother Dominikus Zwernemann (1901-1983) of Gerleve Abbey. == External links == == References == Category:Mountains and hills of North Rhine-Westphalia Category:Coesfeld Category:Coesfeld (district) ",
