    "text": "Sean-n\u00f3s dance in America has its roots in Irish culture, but may be practiced differently from how it is danced in Ireland. When Irish people emigrated to America in great numbers during the early American Colonial period, or when escaping The Troubles in Ireland, they brought their dance culture with them. One of the many forms of Irish dance is sean-n\u00f3s dance, which is an informal, spontaneous, solo form of dance. Sean-n\u00f3s dance has both modified, and in turn been modified by, similar forms of traditional vernacular solo dance in America. == Irish traditional dance == The most widely known form of traditional Irish dance is competition-oriented modern Irish stepdance. Other popular forms of Irish dancing are for couples and group social dancing, such as set dancing and c\u00e9ili dancing. Less known is the traditional solo dance form called \"sean n\u00f3s\" or \"old style\" dance. == Sean-n\u00f3s dance == Sean-n\u00f3s dance is characterized by its \"low to the ground\" footwork, free movement of the arms, improvisation, and emphasis upon a \"battering step\" (which sounds out the accented beat of the music). By its nature, sean-n\u00f3s dance follows the music closely. Indeed, the rhythmic nature of sean-n\u00f3s dance results in a percussive music of its own. It frequently is danced by only one person, and even when danced in pairs or small groups, there is no physical contact between the dancers. Because it is a freeform, solo type of dance, it is not necessary for a pre-arranged routine to be decided upon by the dancer; spontaneous expression is preferred in the tradition. It is less common to see groups performing synchronized sean-n\u00f3s dance (which requires choreography in advance). Instead, the dancers may dance in turns, playing off of the energy of the other. Another more specialized form sean-n\u00f3s dancing is the brush dance. == Influence on other forms of dance in America == Sean-n\u00f3s dance has made a significant contribution to American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing, which includes flat foot dance (or \"flat-footing\"), hoofing (or \"hoofin'\"), buck dancing, soft shoe (casual tap dancing performed in shoes without metal taps), clogging (in its older non-show form), Irish sean-n\u00f3s dance, and the Irish jig. Various other names may be applied for this category of dance, depending upon the specific regional, language, cultural, or social group involved.A Brief History of Clog Dancing. Jeff Driggs, Double Toe Times Clogging Magazine] Solo Southern dancing and solo mountain-style dancing show strong influences from sean-n\u00f3s dance. > I believe that to get some idea of the process of Southern vernacular dance > development, we must consider it in parallel with its companion music and > the dominant cultures that have mixed to produce it: British, African, and > to some extent, Native American.

Small sean- n\u00f3s dancing communities exist in Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington D.C., Seattle, New York, and Portland, Oregon. These communities are centered around American sean-n\u00f3s dance teachers \u2014 some of Irish-American heritage \u2014 who learned their dancing in the west of Ireland. This new generation of younger American dancers now teaches and performs regularly. Kieran Jordan (Boston), Maldon Meehan (Portland, Oregon) and Shannon Dunne (Washington, DC) have produced instructional DVDs in sean-n\u00f3s dance. Workshops in sean-n\u00f3s dance can also be found at Irish festivals like the Sean-n\u00f3s Northwest Festival, the Milwaukee Irish Fest Summer School, the Catskills Irish Arts Week, and the Minnesota Irish Fair. Sean-n\u00f3s dancing workshops are also often incorporated into smaller workshop weekends focused on set dancing. Occasionally, sean-n\u00f3s dancers from Ireland tour in the U.S. with well-known Irish traditional bands, such as The Chieftains and Dervish. == Minimalist means of preserving Irish music and dance == The Irish people's practice of sean-n\u00f3s dance, sean-n\u00f3s song, lilting (or \"mouth music\"), and \"the bones\" (a simple percussion instrument) represents a minimalist means of preserving their musical and dance heritage \u2014 despite concerted efforts by the English authorities to usurp Irish music, dance,Irish Step Dancing - A Brief History, Don Haurin & Ann Richens modes of dress, languageAre the Irish Speaking Irish?, Bernd Biege (see Irish Gaelic and Hiberno-English), Catholic religion,Dimensions: The Rupture of English and Irish Identities in Early Modern Ireland, 1534-1615, D. W. Cunnane nationality, and history \u2014 or simply due to a dearth of resources when emigrating. Accordingly, the Irish in America have been able to promulgate the dance and musical aspects of the Culture of Ireland \u2014 even after large waves of migration subsequent to highly disruptive events in Ireland, such as the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland or the Great Famine of Ireland. == Sources == * Folk music and dances of Ireland, Breand\u00e1n Breathnach * Folk Music and Dances of Ireland: A Comprehensive Study Examining the Basic Elements of Irish Folk Music and Dance Traditions, Breandan Breathnach == See also == * Sean-n\u00f3s dance * Irish dance * Irish stepdance * Irish set dance * Irish jig * American traditional informal freeform solo folk dancing * African American dance == References == == External links == * Hoilands FAQ - What is ceili, sean-nos and set dancing?
