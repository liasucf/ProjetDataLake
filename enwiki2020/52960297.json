    "text": "Hugh Gaine (c. 1726 - April 27, 1807) was an 18th-century American printer, bookseller, and newspaper publisher. Gaine was born in Belfast, Ireland about 1726 and came to New York in 1745, where he later started publishing the New York Mercury. When the British moved on New York City early in the American Revolutionary War, he crossed the river to Newark, New Jersey and published a lukewarm pro-independence newspaper. After deciding the British were going to win the war, he returned to New York and began publishing in their favor, publishing accounts highly favorable to the British.Chopra, Ruma. Printer Hugh Gaine Crosses and Re-Crosses the Hudson, in New York History, Vol. 90, No. 4 (Fall 2009), pp. 271-85 Though Gaine's newspaper ventures were a failure (he exited the field by 1783), he did do well in book publishing.Fellow, Anthony.
