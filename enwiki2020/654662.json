    "text": "Astronaut photo of Belle Isle showing the interaction of the Labrador Current and that from the Strait of Belle Isle Belle Isle (French for \"Beautiful Island\") is an uninhabited island slightly more than 15 mi (25 km) off the coast of Labrador and slightly less than 20 mi (31 km) north of Newfoundland at the Atlantic entrance to the Strait of Belle Isle, which takes its name. Named by the French explorer Jacques Cartier, the island lies on the shortest shipping lane between the Great Lakes and Europe and is on the main north- south shipping route to Hudson Bay and the Northwest Territories. The northern terminus of the International Appalachian Trail is on Belle Isle. Belle Isle rises to about at its highest point and is in area, long and wide. It is nearly from either coast, but it is slightly closer to the Labrador side of the Strait of Belle Isle, and it has a lighthouse (supported by flying buttresses) at both its northern and its southern ends. Officially uninhabited, the island has some seasonal occupation during fishing season. Belle Isle is the northernmost peak of the Appalachian Mountains, which extend in various shapes over southwest to Alabama, United States. Ice patterns show that the island lies at the meeting point of two sea currents. The Labrador Current flows from the northwest, and a smaller current, driven by dominant westerly winds, flows from the southwest. Flow lines in sea ice give a sense of the movement of the ice. Ice floes embedded in the Labrador Current appear as a relatively open pattern. Sea ice with a denser pattern enters from the strait, banking against the west side of Belle Isle. Tendrils flow around capes at both ends of the island, with an ice-free \"shadow\" on the opposite, downstream side. Eddies off the western coast in the ice patterns, indicated by curved arrows in this photograph, show the place in which the currents interact north and west of the island. ==Climate== Belle Isle has a subarctic climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Dfc) with short, cool summers and long, severely cold winters lasting most of the year. Precipitation peaks during the warmer months of June\u2013September in the form of rain. ==See also== *List of communities in Newfoundland and Labrador *List of ghost towns in Newfoundland and Labrador ==References== * ==External links== *Strait of Belle Isle ecoregion *Chart of The Strait of Belle Isle and Belle Isle by Captain James Cook Category:Uninhabited islands of Newfoundland and Labrador ",
