    "text": "Mars Micro Orbiter (MMO) is a spacecraft mission concept that would place a small and inexpensive satellite in orbit around the planet Mars to study some aspects of the Mars atmosphere in visible and infrared wavelengths. The orbiter study will undergo a preliminary design review in March 2018, potentially launching as a secondary payload on another mission in 2020. ==Overview== In April 2015, NASA's Small Innovative Missions for Planetary Exploration (SIMPLEx) program requested proposals for interplanetary CubeSat investigations, and received 22 submissions. NASA's Space Cubes: Small Satellites Provide Big Payoffs. Brian Dunbar NASA TV. 8 September 2015. The MMO was not selected for launch, but in 2017 it was awarded grants$1.66 M contract with Malin Space Science Systems, Inc. in San Diego, CA 20 March 2017.Sampling of Recent Federal Government Funding Actions/Set Asides - Mars Micro Orbiter Mission. 7 September 2017. for further technology development. In 2015, the concept considered a 6U CubeSat with potential to also serve as an orbital communication relay for Mars surface-based missions,Planetary Science Division Status Report. (PDF) James L. Green. NASA, Planetary Science Division.

The orbiter study will undergo a preliminary design review in March 2018, potentially launching as a secondary payload on another mission in 2020. The Principal Investigator is Michael Malin, from Malin Space Science Systems. ==Objectives== The MMO would study the Mars atmosphere in visible and infrared wavelengths from Mars orbit. The science measurements include: *atmospheric thermal structure, dust and condensate clouds, and seasonal and perennial polar cap behavior. *characterize the dynamics and energy budget of the current Mars atmosphere. *support present and future Mars missions. *help characterize present-day habitability. *potential to provide orbital communication relay for Mars surface-based missions. ==See also== ;Atmospheric orbiters at Mars * ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter * Mars Orbiter Mission * MAVEN orbiter ==References== Category:Attached spacecraft Category:CubeSats Category:Missions to Mars Category:Proposed NASA space probes ",
