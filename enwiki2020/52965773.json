In 1924, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos joined the party and on May 11, 1930, Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos was elected president of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, By A. W. Maldonado, Pg. 86, Publisher: La Editorial, Universidad de Puerto Rico , (December 1, 2006) , , Beauchamp became interested in the cause for Puerto Rican independence and joined the Nationalist Party. He was a member of the Cadets of the Republic (Cadetes de la Republica). The cadets was a quasi-military youth organization of the Nationalist Party also known as the \"Liberation Army of Puerto Rico\". There he met and befriended fellow cadet Hiram Rosado. ==Events leading to a massacre== In 1931, the U.S.-appointed Governor of Puerto Rico, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. named Dr. Carlos E. Chard\u00f3n as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. In 1935, Chard\u00f3n initiated a project based on the ideas of Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, who at the time was a Senator in the Puerto Rican legislature and member of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. It was known as the Reconstruction of Puerto Rico Project. The plan, which was within the New Deal criteria established by U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt during the Great Depression, was well received and became known as Plan Chard\u00f3n.Dr. Delma S. Arrigoitia, Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo: Vida y Obra de Antonio R. Barcelo, 1868-1938; p. 292; Publisher: Ediciones Puerto (January 2008); On October 20, 1935, in a political meeting which the Nationalist Party held in the town of Maunabo and which was transmitted by radio, Albizu Campos denounced Chard\u00f3n, the university deans and the Liberal Party as traitors, saying they wanted to convert the university into an \"American\" propaganda institution.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 305 On October 23, 1935, a group of students at the university who supported Chard\u00f3n began to collect signatures for a petition to declare Albizu Campos \"Student Enemy Number One.\" In turn, a protest against the group by the pro-Nationalist faction of students denounced Chard\u00f3n and the Liberal Party as agents of the United States. ==The R\u00edo Piedras massacre== Don Pedro Albizu Campos in 1936 On October 24, 1935, a student assembly held at the university declared Albizu Campos as persona non grata. Chard\u00f3n requested that the governor provide armed police officers on the university grounds, in case the situation turned violent. Two police officers spotted a \"suspicious-looking vehicle\" and asked the driver, Ram\u00f3n S. Pag\u00e1n, and his friend Pedro Qui\u00f1ones, for identification. A struggle ensued, and the police killed Pag\u00e1n and Qui\u00f1ones. According to the local newspaper \"El Mundo\" of Oct. 25th, an explosion, followed by gunfire, was heard resulting in the additional deaths of Eduardo Rodr\u00edguez Vega and Jos\u00e9 Santiago Barea. At the time Elisha Francis Riggs was the United States appointed police chief of Puerto Rico.Arrigoitia (2008), Puerto Rico Por Encima de Todo, p. 306 An eyewitness, Isolina Rond\u00f3n, testified that she saw the police officers shooting at the victims and heard one police officer screaming \"not to let them escape alive.\" Her testimony was ignored, and no charges were filed against the police officers. The R\u00edo Piedras massacre left four men dead.\"Isolina Rond\u00f3n\", testimony, Peace Host ==The assassination of Elisha F. Riggs== Colonel Elisha Francis Riggs was born in Georgetown, a historic neighborhood located in northwest Washington, D.C.. Riggs was a former officer in the United States Army who was appointed Chief of Police of Puerto Rico in 1933, by Blanton Winship, the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico. He was an unpopular police chief, stemming from his decisions to repress the growing sugar cane labor movement and the Nationalist Pro-Independence Movement.\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America\u2019s Colony\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); . The R\u00edo Piedras Massacre enraged the nationalists. Beauchamps and the nationalists believed that Elisha Francis Riggs was responsible since Riggs was the police chief of Puerto Rico and the entire Insular Police took their orders from Riggs. He decided to retaliate and avenge the deaths of the four men killed in the massacre with the help of Rosado. On Sunday, February 23, 1936, Elisha F. Riggs had attended mass in the Church of Santa Ana in San Juan. When the mass was over, Riggs stepped out of the church and got into his car, a Packard, driven by Angel Alvarez, a police officer. Rosado knew the route which Riggs would normally take and waited. When Riggs' car reached the corner of Allen and Gambaro streets, Rosado came out of his hideout and began shooting towards Riggs. Rosado then made a run for it, but was soon captured by Alvarez. All the while, Riggs got out of his car and began asking for the declarations of those who witnessed the attempt on his life. He was suddenly approached by Beauchamps who said: Believing that he had a witness to the events Riggs told Beauchamps that he was headed to the police station and to accompany him. Beauchamps boarded Riggs chauffeured car and shot Riggs in the head killing him instantly. Beauchamp tried to escape by hiding inside the nearby Rodriguez y Palacios warehouse in Tetuan Street. Beauchamps and Rosado were arrested and Beauchamp was photographed by the local news media giving a cadet military salute before he and Rosado were taken to the San Juan police headquarters. The police station was located in 305 San Francisco Street. Instead of receiving a fair trial, Beauchamps and Rosado were both gunned down by the police in the police station.\"The Puerto Ricans: A Documentary History\"; by: Markus Wiener Publishers; 2008; Page 179 Beauchamps died immediately and Rosado was transferred to a local hospital where he later died of the gun wounds which he received. In the aftermath of the killings, the police claimed that the nationalists were shot because they attempted to escape. None of the police officers involved were demoted or suspendedOfficer Down Memorial Page The news of the assassination of Elisha F. Riggs spread throughout the United States. At that time Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn, was in Washington, D.C. and Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935\u20131937), asked him to condemn Riggs' assassination. Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edntof told Gruening that he would do so only if he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering the Nationalists in the city police station without a trial. Gruening then joined US Senator Millard Tydings a Democrat from Maryland, in a legislative proposal to grant independence to Puerto Rico. However, the bill did not progress in Congress. ==Post assassination== After Riggs' assassination, many Nationalist Party leaders were imprisoned. Members of the Puerto Rican independence movement came under greater scrutiny and persecution. Among the leaders arrested was Pedro Albizu Campos, These leaders were charged with having \"conspired to overthrow\" the U.S. government on the island. They were tried in Boston, Massachusetts, as that federal district court had jurisdiction for Puerto Rico. The first trial jury ended in a hung jury. A second jury was picked, consisting solely of \"Anglo-Americans.\" This jury found every Nationalist charged to be \"guilty\".Historical Timeline, PR Dream The bodies of both nationalists were returned to their respective families. They were both buried in graves located side by side in the Cementerio Municipal (municipal Cemetery) San Jose de Villa Palmeras located in Avenida Eduardo Conde, Villa Palmeras, Santurce, Puerto Rico.Find a Grave ==Further reading== *\"Puerto Rico: Independence Is a Necessity\"; by: Rafael Cancel Miranda (Author); Publisher: Pathfinder Press (NY); Booklet edition (February 1, 2001); *\"Sembrando Patria...Y Verdades\"; by: Rafael Cancel Miranda (Author); Publisher: Cuarto Idearo (January 1, 1998); ASIN: B001CK17D6 *\"War Against All Puerto Ricans: Revolution and Terror in America\u2019s Colony\"; Author: Nelson Antonio Denis; Publisher: Nation Books (April 7, 2015); . ==See also== *List of Puerto Ricans *Boricua Popular Army *Fuerzas Armadas de Liberaci\u00f3n Nacional (Puerto Rico) *French immigration to Puerto Rico ==Notes== ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1936 deaths Category:People from Utuado, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican rebels Category:Puerto Rican Nationalist Party politicians Category:Members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Category:Puerto Rican Roman Catholics Category:Puerto Rican prisoners and detainees ",
