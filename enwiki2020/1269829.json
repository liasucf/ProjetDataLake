Taple was the medieval Limbu king who used to rule the area and \"jung\" in Limbu language means fort. Literally, Taplejung means Fort of King Taple. ==Geography== Taplejung is in northeastern Nepal; the Tamur River flows through the district. The area is home of Kangchenjunga (8586 m), the third highest mountain in the world. Taplejung has an airstrip with commercial flights to Biratnagar and Kathmandu.

Agriculture, animal husbandry and tourism are the major means of livelihood for Limbu people. In the higher altitudes, one can find sherpa people where they arrived from Tibet more than 400 years ago. These sherpas have a distinct culture and tradition from those in Solukhumbu District in the Sagarmatha region. The icons of the cultural heritage are monasteries, chhortens, temples and prayer walls. And to add to the flavour, the festivals of all of these people living in harmony only serve to make the native culture livelier. ==Pathibhara Devi Temple== One of the major attractions is the Pathibhara Devi Temple. This little-known region attracts tourists seeking spiritual fulfillment and blessings from the powerful Pathibhara Devi.

It takes a day to reach the temple on foot from Taplejung Bazaar. On the way to the temple are many species of rhododendron which are unique. ==Notable person== *Chhurim, mountaineer, first woman to climb Everest twice in the same season. * Te-ongsi Sirijunga Xin Thebe: Limbu martyr and legend. * Sukra Raj Sonyok: Politician *Til Kumar Menyangbo Limbu: Politician *Surya Man Gurung:Politician *Ghar Singh Yangden *Sanduk Ruit ==References== *http://cbs.gov.np/?p=2444 *https://web.archive.org/web/20141027133326/http://cbs.gov.np/wp- content/uploads/2014/04/01%20Taplejung_VDCLevelReport.pdf ==External links== *UN map of the municipalities of Taplejung District Category:Populated places in Taplejung District Category:Nepal municipalities established in 2014 Category:Cities, towns and urban municipalities in Province No. 1 Category:Hill stations in Nepal ",
