    "text": "The \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Rennes, also called ENS Rennes is a French scientific grande \u00e9cole, belonging to the network of \u00e9coles normales sup\u00e9rieures established according to the model of the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris. Like its sister universities, its mandate lies in training students with a view to careers in academia, engineering and government. Established by a decree of the 17 October 2013 of the Prime Minister, the ENS Rennes is placed under the direct authority of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research, and is a founder of the European University of Britanny. Before 2013, it was a branch of the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Paris-Saclay, but the great geographical distance between Cachan and Rennes gradually led to its being granted a greater level of autonomy. The school is divided into five departments, which have a yearly intake of eighty to 100 normaliens, i. e. students who are granted the status of paid civil servants. Like the other grandes \u00e9coles in the French higher education system, these students are selected through highly selective entrance examinations called concours, after at least two years of preparatory tuition in schools known as classes pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles. As well as these paid students; the school also admits attendees called magist\u00e9riens, including international students. These two groups of students, despite their different status, receive similar tuition over a four-year period. The ENS Rennes records high levels of success in steering its students towards research-oriented careers; indeed, more than eighty percent of any year-group take and pass the agr\u00e9gation, a French national competitive examination for entrance into careers in academia, and some seventy percent go on to undertake a PhD program. == History == === Establishment of the ENS Rennes : from a branch to an independent school (1994-2013) === === Strengthening of the school after its independence (2013-current) === == Teaching == === Departments === ==== Law-Economics- Management ==== ==== Computer Science ==== ==== Mathematics ==== ==== Mechatronics ==== ==== Sport and Physical Education Sciences ==== === Formations === === Admission to ENS Rennes === == Research == == International relations == == Campus and student life == === School site === Entrance of the school, in 2009 ==== Ker-Lann Campus ==== === Sports, cultural and community activities === == School organization == === Administration === === Current and former teachers === == Notes and references == == See also == === Close articles === * ENS Ulm * ENS Lyon * ENS Paris-Saclay * Classe pr\u00e9paratoire aux grandes \u00e9coles === External links === * official website of the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de Rennes Category:Grandes \u00e9coles Category:\u00c9coles Normales Sup\u00e9rieures Category:Education in Rennes ",
