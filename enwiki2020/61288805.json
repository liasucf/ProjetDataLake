    "text": "Tuija I. Pulkkinen (born 1962) is a Finnish space physicist. Her primary research foci are studying the energy flow from the solar wind to the near- Earth space environment and the energy dissipation processes in the magnetosphere. == Early life and education == Pulkkinen was born in 1962. She received M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in theoretical physics from the University of Helsinki in 1987 and 1992, respectively. == Research and career== Pulkkinen's main research contributions are related to modelling current in the magnetotail during the growth of storms and understanding its importance for magnetotail instabilities. She has broad experience in both modeling and data analysis. Pulkkinen received the American Geophysical Union Macelwane Medal in 1998 for outstanding research by a young scientist. Pulkkinen was affiliated with the Finnish Meteorological Institute from 1998 to 2010. In 2011 she became Dean of the School of Electrical Engineering at Aalto University; she was Vice President for Research at the same institution for 2014-2018. She became chair of the Department of Climate and Space Sciences and Engineering at the University of Michigan in 2018. == Awards and honors== * 1988: Macelwane Medal, American Geophysical Union * 2001: Member of the Finnish Academy of Sciences and Letters * 2014: Foreign Member, U.S. National Academy of Sciences * 2017: Julius Bartels Medal, European Geosciences Union == References == Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:University of Helsinki alumni Category:Aalto University faculty Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:Space scientists Category:Women space scientists Category:Finnish women scientists Category:Foreign associates of the National Academy of Sciences Category:Members of the Finnish Academy of Science and Letters Category:20th-century American women scientists Category:21st-century American women scientists Category:20th-century Finnish scientists Category:21st-century Finnish scientists Category:Finnish physicists Category:20th-century physicists Category:21st-century physicists Category:Women physicists Category:Expatriate academics in the United States ",
