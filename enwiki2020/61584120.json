    "text": "alt=photograph of a youngish white man, dark haired and clean shaven The Lark Ascending is a short, single-movement work by the English composer Ralph Vaughan Williams, inspired by the 1881 poem of the same name by the English writer George Meredith. It was originally for violin and piano, completed in 1914 but not performed until 1920. The composer reworked it for solo violin and orchestra after the First World War. This version, in which the work is chiefly known, was first performed in 1921. It is subtitled \"A Romance\", a term that Vaughan Williams favoured for contemplative slow music. The work has gained considerable popularity in Britain and elsewhere and has been much recorded between 1928 and the present day. ==Background== Among the enthusiasms of the composer Ralph Vaughan Williams were poetry and the violin. He had trained as a violinist as a boy, and greatly preferred the violin to the piano, for which he never had a great fondness.De Savage, pp. xvii\u2013xxKennedy, p. 11 His literary tastes were wide-ranging, and among the English poets of the 19th and early 20th centuries whom he admired were Tennyson, Swinburne, Christina and Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Hardy, Housman, and Meredith.Vaughan Williams (1972\u201373), p. 88 Before the composition of The Lark Ascending Vaughan Williams had inscribed a verse by Meredith above an early score, now lost.Foreman, Lewis (2018). Notes to Onyx CD 4185 The composer's second wife, Ursula, herself a poet, wrote that in The Lark Ascending Vaughan Williams had \"taken a literary idea on which to build his musical thought \u2026 and had made the violin become both the bird's song and its flight, being, rather than illustrating the poem from which the title was taken\".Vaughan Williams (1964), p. 156 At the head of the score Vaughan Williams wrote twelve lines from Meredith's 122-line poem: > He rises and begins to round, He drops the silver chain of sound, Of many > links without a break, In chirrup, whistle, slur and shake. For singing till > his heaven fills, 'Tis love of earth that he instils, And ever winging up > and up, Our valley is his golden cup And he the wine which overflows to lift > us with him as he goes. Till lost on his aerial rings In light, and then the > fancy sings. It is not known when and where Vaughan Williams composed the piece. The original manuscript has been lost. Tom Ford, \"The Lark's First Flight\", Limelight, August 2013, p. 49 The soloist for whom the work was written and to whom it is dedicated was Marie Hall, a leading British violinist of the time, a former pupil of Edward Elgar, and celebrated for her interpretation of that composer's Violin Concerto.Howes, p. 97 She worked with Vaughan Williams on the new piece before the premiere, and may have influenced some details of the score, though if so the extent is unknown.Lee, p. 441 ==First performances== The premiere of the violin and piano version was given by Hall and the pianist Geoffrey Mendham (1899\u20131984) at the Shirehampton Public Hall on 15 December 1920.Conway, Paul (2016). Notes to Naxos CD 8.573530 Hall was again the soloist in the first performance of the orchestral version, in the Queen\u2019s Hall, London, on 14 June 1921, at a concert presented by the British Music Society. The British Symphony Orchestra was conducted by Adrian Boult. The music critic of The Times noted that The Lark Ascending was not the main item on the programme, which featured an early performance of Holst's The Planets, but it made a favourable impression. He commented that it: :stood apart from the rest as the only work in the programme which showed serene disregard of the fashions of to-day or of yesterday. It dreams its way along in \"many links without a break\", and though it never rises to the energy of the lines \"He is the dance of children, thanks Of sowers, shout for primrose banks,\" the music is that of the clean countryside, not of the sophisticated concert- room.\"British Music Society \u2013 An 'Unknown' Programme\", The Times, 15 June 1921, p. 8 The critic A. H. Fox Strangways wrote in Music & Letters: :The violin floats in a long rapture over some homegrown tunes in the accompaniment, taking little bits of them into its song at intervals. Violin cadenzas are apt to have a family likeness, but these jubilations will hardly remind anybody of anything else. There is very little of the harmless necessary arpeggio or of ingeniously wonderful double stops. It is pure carolling.Fox Strangways, A. H. \"Vaughan Williams\", Music & Letters, April 1920, p. 80 ==Musical analysis== The typical playing time of the piece is between 13 and 16 minutes. It begins with a two-bar introduction by woodwind and muted strings in time, after which the soloist enters with an unaccompanied cadenza marked pianissimo and sur la touche (that is, placing the bow over the fingerboard, which reduces the higher harmonics and gives an ethereal tone).\"Sul tasto\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 22 August 2019. Borg-Wheeler, Philip (2014). Notes to Signum CD SIGCD399 The cadenza is written \"senza misura\" \u2013 without bar-lines \u2013 which Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians defines as \"freely\", \"without strict regard for the metre\".\"Misura\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 22 August 2019. upright=2 Towards the end of the cadenza Vaughan Williams introduces a melody in G major with which the solo violin continues when the orchestra re-enters, in :Vaughan Williams (1925), pp. 3\u20134 upright=2 A second, unaccompanied cadenza, shorter than the first, leads to a contrasting episode (Allegretto tranquillo quasi andante) with a new melody for flutes:Vaughan Williams (1925), pp. 9\u201310 upright=2 A section marked Allegro tranquillo begins with solo violin trills, punctuated by off-beat triangle (the only percussion in the piece). The key, which has been a somewhat ambiguous G major up to this point, changes to F major, and the time switches to . The oboe enters after five bars with another new melody marked scherzando:Vaughan Williams (1925), p. 13 upright=1.25 The melody introduced by the flutes returns, (now marked Allegretto molto tranquillo) played by the violin soloist, and is followed by a reprise of the earlier section. The work ends with the unaccompanied violin in a closing cadenza which reaches up to a D in altissimo (i.e. two octaves above the treble staff)\"In alt\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press. Retrieved 23 August 2019 ) and then drops again a minor third on to B. Christopher Mark has analysed The Lark Ascending in terms of the composer's use of modes. He finds that the work begins in the Dorian mode, and switches between that and the Aeolian mode interspersed with extensive use of the Pentatonic scale.Mark, p. 186 ==Alternative versions== The orchestral version is scored for solo violin with an orchestra of two flutes, one oboe, two clarinets, two bassoons, two horns, triangle and strings.Vaughan Williams (1925), p. 1 Vaughan Williams also provided a version for chamber orchestra, with one each of flute, oboe, clarinet, bassoon, horn and triangle, with three or four first violins, the same of second violins, two violas, two cellos and one double bass. ==Critical and public reception== The work has prompted a range of aesthetic responses from analysts and reviewers. In his study of the composer's music, Michael Kennedy comments that The Lark Ascending is a unique work, but often underrated \"possibly because its very simplicity is deceptive\".Kennedy, p. 168 The critic Paul Conway writes that it \"depicts a pastoral scene with the violin imitating the titular songbird and the orchestra \u2026 representing the landscape beneath\". Christopher Mark similarly sees a distinction between the airborne solo part and the orchestral sections, finding the \"folk-like melody\" for the flute \"shifting the focus from the sky to ground-level and human activity\".Mark, p. 187 The musicologist Lewis Foreman comments, \"It is possible to forget what a revolutionary piece this was in the context of the British music of 1914 [with] its rhythmic freedom and flow and its avoidance of tonic-and-dominant cadencing, together with its imagery\".Foreman, Lewis (2018). Notes to Onyx CD 4185 Jeffrey Davis writes, \"At one level it seems to be an idyll of rural England [but] in view of its composition on the eve of the First World War, there is perhaps an underlying layer of sadness to the music. Rather like the Edwardian era, as viewed retrospectively from the other side of World War One, it seems to reflect nostalgia for a partly mythological lost age of innocence.\"Davis, Jeffrey (2018). Notes to Alto CD ALC 1384 For Philip Borg- Wheeler, writing in 2014, the piece is \"imbued with a profound sense of communion with nature\". He adds, \"Rather than scorning English pastoralism \u2013 as Elisabeth Lutyens and others did with observations such as 'the cowpat school' \u2013 we should value this rare quality expressed so perfectly by Vaughan Williams in particular. The same writer draws attention to the parallels between Vaughan Williams and B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k who, he suggests, both assimilated folk-song characteristics so thoroughly that their own melodic invention became indistinguishable \u2013 there is no actual folk-song borrowing in The Lark Ascending. Frank Howes, in his The Music of Ralph Vaughan Williams written towards the end of the composer's life, observes that the work is distinctively Vaughan Williams's own and \"like nothing else in music \u2013 Beethoven's two Romances for violin and orchestra are the nearest parallels\".Howes, pp. 97\u201398 Like other commentators, Howes remarks on the composer's choice of the term \"A Romance\" for the piece. It was a term he applied to some of his most profoundly lyrical utterances such as the slow movements of the Piano Concerto and the Fifth Symphony. Howes adds, \"'Romance' for Vaughan Williams is devoid of erotic connotation \u2026 The lark may be calling to his mate but it sounds more like joie de vivre on a spring morning with a slight haze in the air.\" In a 2011 poll of BBC listeners to choose Britain's Desert Island Discs, the work was the chosen favourite.\"Top Desert Island Disc\", BBC From 2007 to 2010, the piece was voted number one in the Classic FM annual \"Hall of Fame\" poll, over Elgar's Cello Concerto, Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2, Mozart's Clarinet Concerto and another work of Vaughan Williams, the Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis. In 2011\u20132013 it was supplanted by the Rachmaninoff work but was placed first in 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017, and took third place in 2018.\"Tchaikovsky's 1812 Overture tops the Classic FM Hall of Fame for the first time ever!\", April 2018Hall of Fame poll results 2018, Classic FM In 2011, in a radio poll of New Yorkers for preferences of music to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, The Lark Ascending ranked second.\"911 Soundtrack New York Radio\", The Guardian, 26 August 2011 The Lark Ascending has been a consistent favourite in Radio New Zealand Concert's annual New Year's Day countdown programme, Settling the Score.
