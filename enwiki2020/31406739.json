    "text": "Richard Wogan (died after 1453) was an Irish judge and cleric who held the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland and also served as a soldier. He was born in County Kildare, a member of the Wogan family of Rathcoffey, which produced several distinguished Irish officials. Thomas Wogan, the founder of the family, is first recorded in Ireland in 1317. Rathcoffey was granted to Sir John Wogan (who was probably Richard's father) in 1417. Richard was a clergyman, but never held high office in the Church. He was first mentioned as a Crown official in Ireland in 1441, and held the office of Lord Chancellor, probably between the years 1446 and 1449, (although as usual in this period the exact dates are disputed).O'Flanagan, J. Roderick Lives of the Lord Chancellors and Keepers of the Great Seal of Ireland 2 Volumes London 1870 ==Lord Chancellor == His tenure as Lord Chancellor was marked by controversy, as a result of the bitter feud between the Butler and Talbot factions, which dominated Irish politics for more than two decades. Almost all senior Irish officials of the Crown were forced to declare their allegiance to one or other side, and Wogan chose to support the Talbot faction, headed by John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury.Otway-Ruthven, A.J. History of Medieval Ireland Barnes and Noble reissue 1993 As a result he was accused of treason, and of a number of other offences including hiding the Great Seal of Ireland, failing to enroll Acts of the Privy Council of Ireland and ignoring a summons to appear before the Council. These charges were levelled principally by James Butler, 4th Earl of Ormond, head of the Butler faction. Wogan went to England to plead in his own defence. He argued that the charge of treason meant only that he had attempted to carry out the King's commands, but that none of the King's other officers dared to support him against the Butlers.Otway-Ruthven His defence was accepted, and he twice received a royal pardon for all alleged transgressions committed while in Ireland.Ball F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 He evidently wished to continue in office as long as possible, but, not surprisingly, asked that a Deputy might be appointed to act for him as he admitted that \"I cannot bear Ormonde's heavy lordship\".Otway-Ruthven ==Soldier == He was unusual among the holders of the office of Lord Chancellor in being a military man, who took part in the English defence of Bayonne.Ball Judges in Ireland In 1453 he was involved in a private war against another branch of the Wogan family, and used his troops to seize Rathcoffey Castle, the family's principal seat. His date of death is not recorded. ==References== Category:Lord Chancellors of Ireland Category:People from County Kildare ",
