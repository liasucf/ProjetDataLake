The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds- eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting safety mat. In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community. ==Notable People== * Yazaira Lopez, the winner of Va por Ti co-production of Univision and Televisa 2014 * Christian Nieves, an internationally known cuatro player * Barbara Serrano, recognized writer and first runner-up of Miss World Puerto Rico 2000 ==Books about Naranjito== *El Chango.
