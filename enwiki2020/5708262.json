    "text": "The 1952\u201353 season was the 73rd season of competitive football in England. ==Overview== This was the closest championship win in English league history at the time, with Arsenal claiming the title with a goal average superior to Preston's by just 0.099. Both Arsenal and Preston had identical records aside from their goal averages. Had goal difference been the deciding factor as it was from 1977 onwards, Arsenal would still have won with +33 to Preston's +25, unlike in 1989 when they would have finished second on goal average. Preston had last been champions in 1890, the second season of the Football League. The FA Cup was won by Blackpool, beating Bolton Wanderers 4\u20133 in what became known as the 'Matthews Final', due to the masterly contribution of 38-year-old winger Stanley Matthews, who helped his side win after going 3\u20131 down, although three of Blackpool's goals were scored by prolific forward Stan Mortensen. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Arsenal (7*)||Preston North End |- |Second Division||Sheffield United||Huddersfield Town |- |Third Division North||Oldham Athletic||Port Vale |- |Third Division South||Bristol Rovers||Millwall |- |FA Cup||Blackpool (1)||Bolton Wanderers |- |Charity Shield||Manchester United||Newcastle United |- |Home Championship||colspan=2|Shared by and |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division North=== ===Third Division South=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Charlie Wayman (Preston North End) \u2013 23 goals Second Division *Arthur Rowley (Leicester City) \u2013 39 goals Third Division North *Jimmy Whitehouse (Carlisle United) \u2013 29 goals Third Division South *Geoff Bradford (Bristol Rovers) \u2013 33 goals ==National team== The England national football team were joint winners in the 1953 British Home Championship with Scotland.
