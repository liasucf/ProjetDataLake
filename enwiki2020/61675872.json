Her father was a soldier. Later, in 2013, she recalled her childhood: \"I used to live at Sillim-dong for around 20 years. At that time my family was likely rich, compared to most of my friends living at slums. I faced 2 impressive incidents, one was when I was a primary student. I pushed my friend as \"playing\", then her body involuntarily broke the wall and moved to the next door. For me it was quite shocking, because it was totally different from my home. Another incident was happened when I was a secondary student. During that time one of my friends lost her father, so I visited her house. I realised that her family rented a mud house.\" She earned a Bachelor's Degree of Sociology from Seoul National University. Initially, she desired to be a nun, but gave up as her parents didn't allow. During the early of 1990s, Eun was a member of Socialist Labour League of South Korea, along with Cho Kuk and Rhyu Si-min.
