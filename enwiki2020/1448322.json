    "text": "Sodium bromide is an inorganic compound with the formula NaBr. It is a high- melting white, crystalline solid that resembles sodium chloride. It is a widely used source of the bromide ion and has many applications.Michael J. Dagani, Henry J. Barda, Theodore J. Benya, David C. Sanders \"Bromine Compounds\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2000. ==Synthesis, structure, reactions== NaBr crystallizes in the same cubic motif as NaCl, NaF and NaI. The anhydrous salt crystallizes above 50.7 \u00b0C. Dihydrate salts (NaBr\u00b72H2O) crystallize out of water solution below 50.7 \u00b0C. NaBr is produced by treating sodium hydroxide with hydrogen bromide. Sodium bromide can be used as a source of the chemical element bromine. This can be accomplished by treating an aqueous solution of NaBr with chlorine gas: :2 NaBr + Cl2 \u2192 Br2 \\+ 2 NaCl ==Applications== Sodium bromide is the most useful inorganic bromide in industry. It is also used as a catalyst in TEMPO- mediated oxidation reactions. ===Medicine=== Bromo-Seltzer newspaper ad (1908) Also known as Sedoneural, sodium bromide has been used as a hypnotic, anticonvulsant, and sedative in medicine, widely used as an anticonvulsant and a sedative in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Its action is due to the bromide ion, and for this reason potassium bromide is equally effective. In 1975, bromides were removed from drugs in the U.S. such as Bromo-Seltzer due to toxicity. ===Preparation of other bromine compounds=== Sodium bromide is widely used for the preparation of other bromides in organic synthesis and other areas. It is a source of the bromide nucleophile to convert alkyl chlorides to more reactive alkyl bromides by the Finkelstein reaction: :NaBr + RCl \u2192 RBr + NaCl (R = alkyl) Once a large need in photography, but now shrinking, the photosensitive salt silver bromide is prepared using NaBr. ===Disinfectant=== Sodium bromide is used in conjunction with chlorine as a disinfectant for hot tubs and swimming pools. ===Petroleum industry=== Sodium bromide is used to prepare dense fluids used in oil wells. ==Safety== NaBr has a very low toxicity with an oral estimated at 3.5 g/kg for rats. However, this is a single-dose value. Bromide ion is a cumulative toxin with a relatively long half life (in excess of a week in humans): see potassium bromide. ==References== ==External links== * Information about NaBr. * Bromide Poisoning in Angola Category:Sodium compounds Category:Bromides Category:GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators Category:Sedatives Category:Alkali metal bromides ",
