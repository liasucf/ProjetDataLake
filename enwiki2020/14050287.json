    "text": "CEILIDH is a public key cryptosystem based on the discrete logarithm problem in algebraic torus. This idea was first introduced by Alice Silverberg and Karl Rubin in 2003; Silverberg named CEILIDH after her cat. The main advantage of the system is the reduced size of the keys for the same security over basic schemes. ==Algorithms== ===Parameters=== * Let q be a prime power. * An integer n is chosen such that : ** The torus T_n has an explicit rational parametrization. ** \\Phi_n(q) is divisible by a big prime l where \\Phi_n is the n^{th} Cyclotomic polynomial. * Let m=\\phi(n) where \\phi is the Euler function. * Let \\rho : T_n(\\mathbb{F}_q) \\rightarrow {\\mathbb{F}_q}^m a birational map and its inverse \\psi. * Choose \\alpha \\in T_n of order l and let g=\\rho(\\alpha)). ===Key agreement scheme=== This Scheme is based on the Diffie-Hellman key agreement. * Alice chooses a random number a\\ \\pmod{\\Phi_n(q)}. * She computes P_A= \\rho(\\psi(g)^a) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m and sends it to Bob. * Bob chooses a random number b\\ \\pmod{\\Phi_n(q)}. * He computes P_B= \\rho(\\psi(g)^b) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m and sends it to Alice. * Alice computes \\rho(\\psi(P_B))^a) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m * Bob computes \\rho(\\psi(P_A))^b) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m \\psi \\circ \\rho is the identity, thus we have : \\rho(\\psi(P_B))^a) = \\rho(\\psi(P_A))^b) = \\rho(\\psi(g)^{ab}) which is the shared secret of Alice and Bob. ===Encryption scheme=== This scheme is based on the ElGamal encryption. * Key Generation ** Alice chooses a random number a\\ \\pmod{ \\Phi_n(q)} as her private key. ** The resulting public key is P_A= \\rho(\\psi(g)^a) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m. * Encryption ** The message M is an element of \\mathbb{F}_q^m. ** Bob chooses a random integer k in the range 1\\leq k \\leq l-1. ** Bob computes \\gamma = \\rho(\\psi(g)^k) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m and \\delta = \\rho(\\psi(M)\\psi(P_A)^k) \\in \\mathbb{F}_q^m. ** Bob sends the ciphertext (\\gamma,\\delta) to Alice. * Decryption ** Alice computes M = \\rho(\\psi(\\delta)\\psi(\\gamma)^{-a}). ==Security== The CEILIDH scheme is based on the ElGamal scheme and thus has similar security properties. If the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption holds the underlying cyclic group G, then the encryption function is one-way. If the decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption (DDH) holds in G, then CEILIDH achieves semantic security. Semantic security is not implied by the computational Diffie-Hellman assumption alone. See decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption for a discussion of groups where the assumption is believed to hold. CEILIDH encryption is unconditionally malleable, and therefore is not secure under chosen ciphertext attack. For example, given an encryption (c_1, c_2) of some (possibly unknown) message m, one can easily construct a valid encryption (c_1, 2 c_2) of the message 2m. ==References== * ==External links== * Torus-Based Cryptography: the paper introducing the concept (in PDF from Silverberg's university web page).
