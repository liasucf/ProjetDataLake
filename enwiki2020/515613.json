    "text": "In commutative algebra, a Gorenstein local ring is a commutative Noetherian local ring R with finite injective dimension as an R-module. There are many equivalent conditions, some of them listed below, often saying that a Gorenstein ring is self-dual in some sense. Gorenstein rings were introduced by Grothendieck in his 1961 seminar (published in ). The name comes from a duality property of singular plane curves studied by (who was fond of claiming that he did not understand the definition of a Gorenstein ring). The zero- dimensional case had been studied by . and publicized the concept of Gorenstein rings. Frobenius rings are noncommutative analogs of zero- dimensional Gorenstein rings. Gorenstein schemes are the geometric version of Gorenstein rings. For Noetherian local rings, there is the following chain of inclusions. ==Definitions== A Gorenstein ring is a commutative Noetherian ring such that each localization at a prime ideal is a Gorenstein local ring, as defined above. A Gorenstein ring is in particular Cohen\u2013Macaulay. One elementary characterization is: a Noetherian local ring R of dimension zero (equivalently, with R of finite length as an R-module) is Gorenstein if and only if HomR(k, R) has dimension 1 as a k-vector space, where k is the residue field of R. Equivalently, R has simple socle as an R-module.Eisenbud (1995), Proposition 21.5. More generally, a Noetherian local ring R is Gorenstein if and only if there is a regular sequence a1,...,an in the maximal ideal of R such that the quotient ring R/( a1,...,an) is Gorenstein of dimension zero. For example, if R is a commutative graded algebra over a field k such that R has finite dimension as a k-vector space, R = k \u2295 R1 \u2295 ... \u2295 Rm, then R is Gorenstein if and only if it satisfies Poincar\u00e9 duality, meaning that the top graded piece Rm has dimension 1 and the product Ra \u00d7 Rm\u2212a \u2192 Rm is a perfect pairing for every a.Huneke (1999), Theorem 9.1. Another interpretation of the Gorenstein property as a type of duality, for not necessarily graded rings, is: for a field F, a commutative F-algebra R of finite dimension as an F-vector space (hence of dimension zero as a ring) is Gorenstein if and only if there is an F-linear map e: R \u2192 F such that the symmetric bilinear form (x, y) := e(xy) on R (as an F-vector space) is nondegenerate.Lam (1999), Theorems 3.15 and 16.23. For a commutative Noetherian local ring (R, m, k) of Krull dimension n, the following are equivalent:Matsumura (1989), Theorem 18.1. * R has finite injective dimension as an R-module; * R has injective dimension n as an R-module; * The Ext group \\operatorname{Ext}^i_R(k,R) = 0 for i \u2260 n while \\operatorname{Ext}^n_R(k,R) \\cong k; * \\operatorname{Ext}^i_R(k,R) = 0 for some i > n; * \\operatorname{Ext}^i_R(k,R) = 0 for all i < n and \\operatorname{Ext}^n_R(k,R) \\cong k; * R is an n-dimensional Gorenstein ring. A (not necessarily commutative) ring R is called Gorenstein if R has finite injective dimension both as a left R-module and as a right R-module. If R is a local ring, R is said to be a local Gorenstein ring. ==Examples== * Every local complete intersection ring, in particular every regular local ring, is Gorenstein. *The ring R = k[x,y,z]/(x2, y2, xz, yz, z2\u2212xy) is a 0-dimensional Gorenstein ring that is not a complete intersection ring. In more detail: a basis for R as a k-vector space is given by: \\\\{1,x,y,z,z^2\\\\}. R is Gorenstein because the socle has dimension 1 as a k-vector space, spanned by z2. Alternatively, one can observe that R satisfies Poincar\u00e9 duality when it is viewed as a graded ring with x, y, z all of the same degree. Finally. R is not a complete intersection because it has 3 generators and a minimal set of 5 (not 3) relations. *The ring R = k[x,y]/(x2, y2, xy) is a 0-dimensional Cohen\u2013Macaulay ring that is not a Gorenstein ring. In more detail: a basis for R as a k-vector space is given by: \\\\{1,x,y\\\\}. R is not Gorenstein because the socle has dimension 2 (not 1) as a k-vector space, spanned by x and y. == Properties == *A Noetherian local ring is Gorenstein if and only if its completion is Gorenstein.Matsumura (1989), Theorem 18.3. *The canonical module of a Gorenstein local ring R is isomorphic to R. In geometric terms, it follows that the standard dualizing complex of a Gorenstein scheme X over a field is simply a line bundle (viewed as a complex in degree \u2212dim(X)); this line bundle is called the canonical bundle of X. Using the canonical bundle, Serre duality takes the same form for Gorenstein schemes as in the smooth case. :In the context of graded rings R, the canonical module of a Gorenstein ring R is isomorphic to R with some degree shift.Eisenbud (1995), section 21.11. *For a Gorenstein local ring (R, m, k) of dimension n, Grothendieck local duality takes the following form.Bruns & Herzog (1993), Theorem 3.5.8. Let E(k) be the injective hull of the residue field k as an R-module. Then, for any finitely generated R-module M and integer i, the local cohomology group H^i_m(M) is dual to \\operatorname{Ext}_R^{n-i}(M,R) in the sense that: ::H_m^i(M) \\cong \\operatorname{Hom}_R(\\operatorname{Ext}_R^{n-i}(M,R), E(k)). *Stanley showed that for a finitely generated commutative graded algebra R over a field k such that R is an integral domain, the Gorenstein property depends only on the Cohen\u2013Macaulay property together with the Hilbert series ::f(t) = \\sum olimits_j \\dim_k(R_j)t^j. :Namely, a graded domain R is Gorenstein if and only if it is Cohen\u2013Macaulay and the Hilbert series is symmetric in the sense that ::f\\left(\\tfrac{1}{t} \\right)=(-1)^n t^s f(t) :for some integer s, where n is the dimension of R.Stanley (1978), Theorem 4.4. *Let (R, m, k) be a Noetherian local ring of embedding codimension c, meaning that c = dimk(m/m2) \u2212 dim(R). In geometric terms, this holds for a local ring of a subscheme of codimension c in a regular scheme. For c at most 2, Serre showed that R is Gorenstein if and only if it is a complete intersection.Eisenbud (1995), Corollary 21.20. There is also a structure theorem for Gorenstein rings of codimension 3 in terms of the Pfaffians of a skew-symmetric matrix, by Buchsbaum and Eisenbud.Bruns & Herzog (1993), Theorem 3.4.1. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Commutative algebra ",
