    "text": "General elections were held in Pakistan on 16 November 1988 to elect the members of the National Assembly and Senate. The elections saw the resurgence of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) under the leadership of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter, Benazir. Supporters of President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, who had died in August 1988, reorganised themselves into a nine-party alliance, the Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI) with support from the intelligence agencies.Hamid Gul accepts responsibility for creating IJI Dawn, 30 October 2012 This marked the beginning of a decade-long two-party system between the left-wing PPP and right-wing IJI and its successor the Pakistan Muslim League (N). The PPP emerged as the biggest party, winning 94 of the 207 seats in the National Assembly. The IJI came second with 56 seats amidst a voter turnout of just 43.5%.Dieter Nohlen, Florian Grotz & Christof Hartmann (2001) Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I, p678 The PPP was able to form a government with other left-wing parties, including the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), with Bhutto becoming the first female Prime Minister in a Muslim country. ==Background== Parliamentary elections had been held on 7 March 1977, with the PPP gaining a two-thirds majority. However, amid violence and civil disorder, Chief of Army Staff General Zia-ul-Haq ousted the Prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto in a military coup on 5 June, code-named Operation Fair Play. Martial law was lifted in 1985 when non-partisan and technocratic elections were held, resulting in Mohammad Junejo, a Sindhi lord, being appointed Prime Minister. On 29 May 1988, the National Assembly which was elected in 1985 was dissolved prematurely by Zia, who also dismissed Junejo and the rest of his cabinet asserting that the 'administration was corrupt and inefficient'. The new polling date (exceeding the limit of 90 days following dissolution laid down by the Constitution of Pakistan) was set by the President on 20 July 1988. Moreover it was also announced that the elections would be held on a non-party basis. However, on 2 October, following the accidental death of Zia on 17 August, the Supreme Court reversed the ban on parties and allowed the elections to be held on a party basis. ==Campaign== A total of 1,370 candidates contested the National Assembly elections.Pakistan Elections 2008 | Pakistan Elections 2013 . Elections.com.pk. Retrieved on 3 August 2013. The campaign lasted for a month and remained generally peaceful.Pakistan: Elections held in 1988 Inter-Parliamentary Union After Zia's death, the democratic socialists and secular parties re-united and campaigned under the PPP's platform led by Benazir Bhutto; previously Zia had crushed the socialists' Movement for the Restoration of Democracy, which had attempted to overthrow his military regime, and took extremely tough actions to further disintegrate the movement. The PPP campaign pledged to control and tackle the extremism in Pakistan, and as well as curb the power of the trade unions. The conservatives under Sharif on other hand campaigned upon expanding the industrialisation and privatisation program; The liberal Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) did not formally contest the elections, but several of its members ran as independents. ==Results== Despite allegations of vote rigging against the PPP, and the use of the ID card rule to keep its less well- organized and relatively less well-off supporters from voting, Bhutto won the election by a margin of over 8%, thus managing to defeat the nine-party alliance of IJI. MQM members running as independents received 5.4% of the vote, winning 13 seats in Karachi and Hyderabad. {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !Seats |- |align=left|Pakistan People's Party||7,546,561||38.5||94 |- |align=left|Islami Jamhoori Ittehad||5,908,741||30.2||56 |- |align=left|Pakistan Awami Ittehad||848,119||4.2||3 |- |align=left|Awami National Party||409,555||2.1||2 |- |align=left|Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Fazl-ur-Rehman)||360,526||1.8||7 |- |align=left|Punjabi Pakhtun Ittehad||105,061||0.5||0 |- |align=left|Pakistan National Party||104,442||0.5||0 |- |align=left|National Peoples Party (Khar)||97,363||0.5||1 |- |align=left|Pakistan Democratic Party||80,743||0.4||1 |- |align=left|Balochistan National Alliance||59,248||0.3||2 |- |align=left|Pakistan Muslim League||55,052||0.3||0 |- |align=left|Pakistan Milli Awai Ittehad||46,562||0.2||0 |- |align=left|Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (Darkhasti)||44,964||0.2||1 |- |align=left|Tehrik-e-Jafaria (Arif Hussaini)||42,261||0.2||0 |- |align=left|15 other parties||51,656||0.3||0 |- |align=left|Independents||3,829,705||19.5||40 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||313,926||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||19,904,440||100||207 |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align:left;\"|Source: Nohlen et al. |} ===Punjab=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !Party !Votes !% !Seats |- |align=left|Pakistan Peoples Party||5,150,816||40||53 |- |align=left|Islami Jamhoori Ittehad||4,805,094||37||45 |- |align=left|independents||1,910,832||15||12 |- |align=left|Pakistan Awami Ittehad||762,361||6||3 |- |align=left|National peoples party(Khar group)||97,990||1||1 |- |align=left|Pakistan Democratic Party||80,473||1||1 |- |align=left|others||158,203||0||0 |- |align=left|Total||12,965,769||100||115 |} ===Sindh=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats |- |align=left|Pakistan Peoples Party||1,923,810||47||31 |- |align=left|Independent||1,474,865||36||15 |- |align=left|Islami Jamhoori Ittehad||468,052||11||0 |- |align=left|Punjabi Pakhtoon Ittehad Sindh||105,061||3||0 |- |align=left|others||161,867||3||0 |- |align=left|Total||4,133,655||100||46 |} ===KPK=== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats |- |align=left|Islami Jamhoori Ittehad||541,225||27||8 |- |align=left|Pakistan Peoples Party||467,149||23||9 |- |align=left|Awami National Party||348,834||17||2 |- |align=left|independent||327,280||16||11 |- |align=left|Jamiat-Ulema-e-Islam (Fazal-Ur-Rehman)||197,890||10||3 |- |align=left|Pakistan Awami Ittehad||57,754||3||0 |- |align=left|Jamiat-Ulema-e- Pakistan(Darkhasti)||36,405||2||1 |- |align=left|Others||23,693||1|0 |- |align=left|Total||2,000,230||100||34 |} ===Balochistan=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !party !votes !% !seats |- |align=left|Islami Jamhoori Ittehad||124,717||21||2 |- |align=left|Independent||105,668||18||2 |- |align=left|Jamiat-Ulema-e-Islam(Fazal-Ur-Rehman)||102,280||17||4 |- |align=left|Balochistan National Alliance||71,058||12||2 |- |align=left|Pakistan National Party||64,670||11||0 |- |align=left|Pakhtoon Milli Awami Ittehad||44,529||8||0 |- |align=left|Pakistan Peoples Party||42,723||7||1 |- |align=left|others||36,987||7||0 |- |align=left|Total||592,532||100||11 |} ==Aftermath== In light of the election results, acting President Ghulam Ishaq Khan invited the PPP to form a government. The PPP formed the government, making alliances with small parties and independent groups. On 4 December 1988, Bhutto was elected as the first female Prime Minister of a Muslim country. The new Cabinet, headed by Bhutto was subsequently announced. The MQM was pivotal in the formation of central government, as the PPP had failed to win a majority of seats. However, the MQM left the coalition in October 1989 when differences developed after dozens were killed at an MQM congregation by Sindhi nationalists, and the alliance fell apart in the wake of ensuing violence. The MQM lent its support to Nawaz Sharif\u2019s Islami Jamhoori Ittehad instead. ==References== 1988 Category:1988 elections in Pakistan Category:November 1988 events in Asia ",
