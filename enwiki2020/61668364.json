    "text": "The Lumen is a postmodern, glass curtain style 2020-built, 34-story, high-rise skyscraper located at 1600 Euclid Avenue in downtown Cleveland, Ohio on the corner of East 17th Street and Euclid. As such, the new apartment block is on the Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority or GCRTA Euclid Avenue Rapid- Bus Line which connects the central Public Square with University Circle. The Playhouse Square district is also home to 11 performance spaces; a major hotel, Crowne Plaza Cleveland at Playhouse Square, formerly the Cleveland Wyndham Hotel; more than a dozen restaurants and office buildings. It is the second new apartment building erected in the city center of Cleveland since the 1970s, following the construction of The Beacon in 2019. ==The site== Formerly a large surface parking lot located across from Playhouse Square, The Lumen is the fruition of a long-held vision of Playhouse Square and its former president and CEO, Art Falco, to turn the district into a viable residential community. Playhouse Square hired development manager Hines, builder Providence, Rhode Island-based Gilbane and international architectural firm Chicago-based Solomon Cordwell Buenz to complete the project. In late 2018, the Cuyahoga County Council approved a 10 million dollar loan to Playhouse Square for the construction of the tower, which is estimated at 135 million. The floor plan includes 318 apartment units, 550 parking spaces, and of common space for residents, making it one of the largest apartment complexes in the city center. During excavation, crews discovered remnants of old foundations from other underground projects. ==See also== *List of tallest buildings in Cleveland ==References== ==Sources== Category:Skyscrapers in Cleveland Category:Apartment buildings in Cleveland Category:Residential skyscrapers in Cleveland Category:Downtown Cleveland ",
