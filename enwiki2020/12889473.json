It is threatened by habitat loss. This species is native to China in the areas of Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. ==Conservation== Isoetes sinensis is recorded to be a critically endangered species due to industrial development and agricultural expansion. This species occupies freshwater environments and within terrestrial systems. In order to help conserve this species, amplified fragment length polymorphisms (AFLPs) were used to research the genetic variation of it and the population structure of seven extant populations of the species. This investigation helped provide useful data for creating conservation strategies to help preserve the species. ==References== Category:Critically endangered flora of Asia Category:Flora of Anhui Category:Flora of China Category:Flora of Jiangsu Category:Flora of Korea Category:Flora of Zhejiang sinensis Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
