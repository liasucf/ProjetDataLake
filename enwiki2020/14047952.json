He studied painting under Giovanni Bilivert from 1612 to 1620. Baccio's work and letters also show the influence exerted on the painter by Vincenzio Bocaccio of Rome, who came to Florence, delegated as one of the best students of the architect and painter Lodovico Cigoli. He also apprenticed under Giulio Parigi. Fresco from Casa Buonarroti by Luigi Baccio del Bianco === Bratislava - Vienna \u2013 Prague - Milan === In 1620 he visited Germania and travelled to the Slovakia, where he assisted Giovanni de Galliano Pieroni (1586\u20131654) in construction of a fortress in Bratislava. On his return he decorated several houses, and painted for churches and theatres. In 1622 he went to Vienna, and the same year both went on to Prague, where he performed extensive work in frescoes of the Wallenstein Palace: Audience hall, St. Wenceslas chapel, Ovidius' corridor, Astronomical corridor and sala terrena, some with help of assistants\u010cepi\u010dka Ladislav and Fu\u010d\u00edkov\u00e1 Eli\u0161ka (eds), Albrecht von Waldstein. Inter arma silent musae? Academia Prag 2007, German edition . He did not stay there permanently, as there is evidence he lived in Milan shortly thereafter and was back in Florence in 1625. === Milan - Florence === In 1636 he projected the St Ignatius church for Gy\u0151r. Then he stayed in Florence and painted illusive frescoes (open doors and portraits) for The House Buonarotti (Casa Buonnarotti). Then he decorated with frescoes the Palazzo di San Clemente in Florence and Torregalli castle in Tuscany. In danger of war in 1642 he turned back to projects of fortresses (Livorno, Prato, Pistoia etc.). === Madrid - Buon Retiro === In 1651 he was sent to Spain by Grand Duke Ferdinando II de' Medici to fulfill King Philip IV's request for designer for court performances. His work at the Spanish court included scenes and theatrical machinery for La fiera, el rayo y la piedra in 1652 and Andr\u00f3meda y Perseo in 1653 (both plays by Pedro Calder\u00f3n de la Barca). He died at Madrid in 1657. In Spain he was known as Bartolomeo del Blanco, since Baccio is an Italian diminutive for Bartolommeo or Bartolomeo, while Bianco and Blanco are Italian-Spanish equivalents of \"white\". Accordingly, he shows up as such in certain sources. == See also == * Bartolomeo Bianco of Como, (contemporary to him Geneoese baroque architect, conflated with Luigi Baccio del Bianco) ==References== * == Bibliography == * \"Science in Contact with Art: Astronomical Symbolics of the Wallenstein Palace in Prague\", Alena Hadravov\u00e1 (Research Centre for the History of Science and Humanities of the Czech Academy of Sciences and Charles University), Petr Hadrava (Astronomical Institute of the Czech Academy of Sciences), published in: Science in contact at the beginning of scientific revolution, Ed.
