    "text": "Tala Hydroelectric Power Station is a run-of-the-river type hydroelectric power station on the Wangchu River in Chukha District, Bhutan. The station consists of a tall gravity dam which diverts water through a long headrace tunnel to the power station () which contains six 170 MW Pelton turbine- generators. The difference in elevation between the dam and the power station affords the project a hydraulic head of . Preliminary construction on the project began in 1997 and major works were underway by 1999. The power equipments viz. turbines, generators etc. were designed and manufactured by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), at their various factories in India. The first generator was commissioned on 31 July 2006 and the final on 30 March 2007. The project cost was about US$900 million and was financed by India through grants. All of the electricity generated is exported to India through three 400KV transmission lines. The power station is the country's biggest hydropower project and the fourth after the Chuka project (336 MW) in 1988, followed by Kurichhu (60 MW) in 2001, and Basochho (40 MW) in 2005. Electricity revenue was expected to provide no less than 60% of the government's entire revenue in 2009. In 2017, 97.7 % of Bhutanese households had access to electricity.Worldbank == See also== * Raid\u0101k River == References == Category:Dams completed in 2006 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2006 Category:Energy infrastructure completed in 2007 Category:Hydroelectric power stations in Bhutan Category:Bhutan\u2013India relations Category:Dams in Bhutan Category:Run-of-the-river power stations Category:Economy of Bhutan ",
