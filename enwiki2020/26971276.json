This was shortened to Chute-des-Passes in August 1986. On May 23, 2009, the territory was renamed to Passes-Dangereuses in order to avoid confusion with the hamlet of Chute-des-Passes in the neighbouring Unorganized Territory of Mont- Valin.Institut de la statistique du Qu\u00e9bec (July 2009), Modifications aux municipalit\u00e9s du Qu\u00e9bec May 2009, ISSN 0843-8250 The territory's name Passes- Dangereuses (French for \"dangerous pass\") refers to a series of rapids and chutes that stir up the Peribonka River for a distance of about from Lake Peribonka's outlet downstream. This section of the river flows through impressive escarpments of over high and was first identified as \"the nasty portage\" by Jesuit Pierre-Michel Laure on his map of 1731. The following year, this missionary used the First Nations name Katchiskataouakigs, also used by Bellin on his map of 1744. A map of Jonathan Carver from 1776 indicated \"Falls and Rift\" to characterize the place. Not until the end of the 19th century did the current toponym begin to appear on survey maps. In 1941, Alcan built at the head of these rapids a dam called Chute-des-Passes, forming Lake Peribonka behind it. The dam's name also refers to the nearby hamlet that formed the east side of the river, and was the former name of Passes-Dangereuses Territory. ==Demographics== Population trend:Statistics Canada: 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011 census * Population in 2011: 226 (2006 to 2011 population change: 29.9%) * Population in 2006: 174 * Population in 2001: 188 * Population in 1996: 192 * Population in 1991: 207 Private dwellings occupied by usual residents: 97 (total dwellings: 235) ==References== Category:Unorganized territories in Saguenay\u2013Lac-Saint-Jean Category:Maria-Chapdelaine Regional County Municipality ",
