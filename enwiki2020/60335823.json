    "text": "Xeroplexa is a genus of small, air-breathing land snails, terrestrial pulmonate gastropod mollusks in the family Geomitridae, the hairy snails and their allies. The genus is mainly distributed along western Iberian Peninsula, although X. intersecta spreads from northern Iberian Peninsula to central Europe and British Islands. Xeroplexa species were within genus Candidula until a molecular phylogeny revealed the polyphyly of Candidula, and the genus Xeroplexa Monterosato, 1892 was recovered. == Species == Species within the genus Xeroplexa include: * Xeroplexa arrabidensis (Holyoak & Holyoak, 2014) * Xeroplexa belemensis (Servain, 1880) * Xeroplexa carrapateirensis (Holyoak & Holyoak, 2014) * Xeroplexa coudensis (Holyoak & Holyoak, 2010) * Xeroplexa intersecta (Poiret, 1801) * Xeroplexa olisippensis (Servain, 1880) * Xeroplexa ponsulensis (Holyoak & Holyoak, 2014) * Xeroplexa scabiosula (Locard, 1899) * Xeroplexa setubalensis (Pfeiffer, 1850) type species *Xeroplexa strucki (Maltzan, 1886) == References == == External links == * http://luisjavierchueca.com/research-3/candidula-s-l/ Category:Stylommatophora stubs Category:Stylommatophora ",
