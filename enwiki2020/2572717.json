    "text": "It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown! is the 12th prime-time animated TV special based on the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz. In the United States, it debuted on CBS on April 9, 1974 at 8 PM. Thereafter, CBS aired it each Easter season from 1974 to 2000. ABC repeated the special in some years during the period 2001 through 2014. ==Summary== While most of the Peanuts gang is busy getting ready for Easter, Linus futilely tries to convince them that it is all a waste of time, and that the \"Easter Beagle\" will take care of everything. Only Charlie Brown's sister, Sally, believes him, although she remains skeptical after their Great Pumpkin misadventure on Halloween. Peppermint Patty and Marcie attempt to color Easter eggs, but as it is Marcie's first time, she does not know how. Their first attempt fails as Marcie fries the eggs on a griddle (making fried eggs). The second attempt fails when she tries cooking more eggs on a waffle iron (for 4 of the eggs), then in a toaster (for 1 of them, which is unsuccessful because the egg cannot fit in one of the toaster's slots), and baking the rest of them (the same egg she tries toasting and the remaining 7) in the oven. In the third and final attempt, Peppermint Patty spends the last of her allowance on a third carton of eggs. In doing so, Peppermint Patty (after spending the last of her money with the third and final dozen of eggs) explains to Marcie about how the eggs must be cooked. The eggs are to be neither fried, roasted, toasted, nor waffled. They are supposed to be boiled. However, Marcie boils them (as she is told) but does it incorrectly. Marcie puts the eggs into the pot of water (without the shells). This results with egg soup. Peppermint Patty has an outrage then screams to Marcie that she made egg soup. So that attempt one last time fails. At the end, Peppermint Patty has spent her whole allowance, is out of money, and cannot buy any more eggs. Therefore, she and Marcie end up with no colored eggs and are unable to make any more attempts. Woodstock wakes up shivering in his nest after a cold spring rain. He goes for help to Snoopy, who buys him a birdhouse. At first Woodstock hates it, but soon makes it over into a bachelor pad, complete with television, contemporary artwork, a sunken bed, modern furniture, and a quadrophonic stereo system. Curious to see more of the inside, Snoopy gets his nose stuck in the entry hole and accidentally shatters the birdhouse, and so he buys Woodstock another house. Much to Schroeder's chagrin, Lucy believes that Easter is the \"gift-getting season\", so she decides to have her own private Easter egg hunt, painting and then hiding the eggs herself to find them on Easter morning. But unknown to her, Snoopy follows close behind and snatches up each one of the eggs. Easter morning arrives, and so does the Easter Beagle, tossing eggs to everyone including Woodstock in his new birdhouse, to Lucy (whose hand Snoopy furtively shakes), and even Peppermint Patty and Marcie. But by the time he gets to Charlie Brown, Snoopy has run out of eggs, and he gives Charlie Brown an embarrassed smile instead. At the end, when everyone (except Charlie Brown) has received Easter eggs, Sally (when she and Linus reunite with Lucy), tells Linus that he was right. There is an \"Easter beagle\". But Lucy responds angrily (saying, \"SOME EASTER BEAGLE!\"). She reluctantly believes Linus that an Easter beagle exists and angrily says that he gave her an egg that was one of her own eggs (saying, \"HE GAVE ME MY OWN EGG!\"). Charlie Brown did not get any goodies from the Easter beagle. When everyone (minus Charlie Brown) has received an Easter egg from the \"Easter beagle\" (Snoopy), Marcie then asks Peppermint Patty what they should do with their eggs now that they have them. Peppermint Patty instructs Marcie that after you receive the eggs, you put a little salt on the eggs and eat them. Marcie does so (without removing the shell). After the Easter Beagle's visit, Sally becomes a believer. But as for Lucy, she quickly realizes that the Easter Beagle gave her one of her own eggs. Because of that, she is still brooding about it ten weeks later, and Linus suggests that she go and talk about it with Snoopy. She visits Snoopy's doghouse to pick a fight, but Snoopy takes the fight out of her with a disarming kiss on the cheek. Lucy smiles at that because Easter still made her happy. Then she says, \"The Easter Beagle\" as the special ends. ==Voice cast== *Todd Barbee as Charlie Brown *Melanie Kohn as Lucy van Pelt *Stephen Shea as Linus van Pelt *Greg Felton as Schroeder *Linda Ercoli as Peppermint Patty *Lynn Mortensen as Sally Brown *Jimmy Ahrens as Marcie *Bill Melendez as Snoopy/Woodstock ==Production notes== ===Music score=== The music score for ' was composed by Vince Guaraldi (except where noted) and conducted and arranged by John Scott Trotter.

However, in the mid-2000s, recording session master tapes for seven 1970s-era Peanuts television specials scored by Guaraldi were discovered by his son, David Guaraldi. This resulted in the release of \"Snoopy and Woodstock\" (aka Cue 4) and \"Kitchen Music\" (version 2, aka Cue 18, Take 1) being released on the compilation album, Vince Guaraldi and the Lost Cues from the Charlie Brown Television Specials, Volume 2 (2008). In addition, a live version of \"Woodstock's Pad\" (mistitled \"Then Came You\") was also released in 2008 on Live on the Air from a Vince Guaraldi Trio concert originally recorded on February 6, 1974 (exactly two years to the day before Guaraldi's untimely death). ===Voice talent=== It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown was the last special for Todd Barbee.
