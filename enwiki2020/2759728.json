This family became extinct at the beginning of the 13th century, and the heiress brought the lordship to the family of Clermont in the Beauvaisis,.Family tree of Clermont-Beauvaisis-Nesle One of the first lords was Raoul I, Seigneur of Nesle (nl) (d.a. 1125). Simon II of Clermont, Seigneur of Nesle through his mother Gertrude, was regent of the kingdom of France during the second crusade of Saint Louis. Raoul II/III of Clermont, constable of France, and Guy I and Guy II (d. 1352) of Clermont, both marshals of France, were members of the family. The brothers Raoul and Guy I were both notable casualties of the Battle of the Golden Spurs 1302, a French military disaster in the County of Flanders in the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305). The seigneurie (lordship) of Nesle was elevated to a countship for Charles de Sainte-Maure in 1467 and into a marquisate for Louis de Sainte-Maure in 1546. It was acquired in 1666 by Louis Charles de Mailly. His grandson, Louis de Mailly, had five daughters, of whom four (the Countess of Mailly, the Duchess of Lauragais, the Countess of Vintimille, and the Marquise de la Tournelle, afterwards the Duchess of Ch\u00e2teauroux) were successively, or simultaneously, mistresses of Louis XV. ==See also== *Communes of the Somme department ==References== * ==External links== * Nesle official website Category:Communes of Somme (department) ",
