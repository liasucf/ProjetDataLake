    "text": "Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli (October 14, 1824 \u2013 June 29, 1886) was a French painter of the generation preceding the Impressionists. ==Biography== Still life with Sardines and Sea Urchins, 1880\u20131882, Dallas Museum of Art Monticelli was born in Marseille in humble circumstances. He attended the \u00c9cole Municipale de Dessin in Marseille from 1842 to 1846, and continued his artistic training in Paris, where he studied under Paul Delaroche at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. In Paris he made copies after the Old Masters in the Louvre, and admired the oil sketches of Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix.Turner 2000, p. 314. In 1855 he met Narcisse Diaz, a member of the Barbizon school, and the two often painted together in the Fontainebleau Forest. Monticelli frequently adopted Diaz's practice of introducing nudes or elegantly costumed figures into his landscapes. He developed a highly individual Romantic style of painting, in which richly colored, dappled, textured and glazed surfaces produce a scintillating effect. He painted courtly subjects inspired by Antoine Watteau; he also painted still lifes, portraits, and Orientalist subjects that owe much to the example of Delacroix. After 1870, Monticelli returned to Marseille, where he would live in poverty despite a prolific output, selling his paintings for small sums. An unworldly man, he dedicated himself singlemindedly to his art. The young Paul C\u00e9zanne befriended Monticelli in the 1860s, and the influence of the older painter's work can be seen in C\u00e9zanne's work of that decade. Between 1878 and 1884 the two artists often painted landscapes together, once spending a month roaming the Aix countryside. Although Monticelli experimented briefly around 1870 with a treatment of light reflecting the discoveries of the Impressionists, he found the objectivity of this approach uncongenial. Confronted with criticism of his style of painting Monticelli himself remarked, \"I paint for thirty years from now\".in: \"Monticelli\" by Gustave Coquiot, 1925 Albin Michel ed Paris His work reached its greatest spontaneity in the decade before his death in 1886. ==Legacy== A Painter at Work on a House Wall, 1875, St\u00e4del Monument \u00e0 Monticelli in the Palais Longchamp Marseille More than a century after his death, Monticelli's art is still subject to controversy. In its painterly freedom Monticelli's work prefigures that of Vincent van Gogh, who greatly admired his work after seeing it in Paris when he arrived there in 1886. Van Gogh immediately adopted a brighter palette and a bolder attack, and later remarked, \"I sometimes think I am really continuing that man.\"Impressionism 1973, p. 45. In 1890, Van Gogh and his brother Theo were instrumental in publishing the first book about Monticelli. Monticelli's reputation grew after his death. Among his collectors was Oscar Wilde who, after going to prison in 1895, wrote of his bankruptcy in a letter to Lord Alfred Douglas, \"De Profundis\": \"That all my charming things were to be sold: my Burne-Jones drawings: my Whistler drawings: my Monticelli: my Simeon Solomons: my china: my Library...\" Others have expressed disregard of Monticelli's work. In a statement published in 2005 in The Guardian, Sir Timothy Clifford, director general of the National Galleries of Scotland, Edinburgh, even chose Monticelli's A Garden Fete as the worst painting in Britain, and commented, \"We have been bequested eight paintings by Monticelli, each one more hideous than the last. In my 21 years here, none has been hung because I think Monticelli produces screamingly awful art. I call this one a Fete Worse Than Death.\" A monument honoring Monticelli, designed in 1909 by the sculptor Auguste Carli, is installed in the Palais Longchamp Marseille. ==Exhibitions== From September 2008 till January 2009, an exhibition entitled \"Van Gogh and Monticelli\" took place in Marseille's Centre de la Vieille Charit\u00e9, highlighting Monticelli's influence on Van Gogh's work. From April 25 till September 27, 2015, an exhibition entitled \"Van Gogh and Co. Criss- crossing the collection\" at the Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum in Otterlo, The Netherlands, displayed paintings by Van Gogh and his predecessors, contemporaries and followers, among them Fran\u00e7ois Bonvin, Charley Toorop, Henri Fantin-Latour, Jean-Baptiste Corot, Paul C\u00e9zanne, Bart van der Leck and Adolphe Monticelli. ==Gallery== File:Monticelli - Portrait de Madame Pascal.jpg|Portrait de Madame Pascal, 1871 File:Adolphe Joseph Thomas Monticelli - Ladies in a Garden - Google Art Project.jpg|Ladies in a Garden, 1870 File:Adolphe Monticelli - Bouquet - Google Art Project.jpg|Bouquet, ca. 1875 File:Adolphe Monticelli - As You Like It - Google Art Project.jpg|As You Like It File:Adolphe Monticelli - Fete Champetre - Google Art Project.jpg|Fete Champetre File:Adolphe Monticelli - Flower still life - Google Art Project.jpg|Flower Still Life, 1875 Image:Monticelli - Aldeia Fant\u00e1stica.jpg|Seascape Near Marseille, 1880, S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Art File:Monticelli - Sc\u00e8ne de parc, femmes, enfants et chiens.jpg|Sc\u00e8ne de parc, femmes, enfants et chiens ==Notes== ==References== *Loan exhibition of paintings by Adolphe Monticelli.
