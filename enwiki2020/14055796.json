    "text": "Matvey Georgiyevich \"Matt\" Korobov (; born 7 January 1983) is a Russian professional boxer who has challenged once for the WBO middleweight title in 2014, and the WBC interim middleweight title in 2018. As an amateur he won consecutive gold medals at the 2005 and 2007 World Championships, and gold at the 2005 Boxing World Cup; all in the middleweight division. ==Amateur career== Korobov won the European junior title in 2001. He became Russian champion in 2003 and 2004 but did not participate in the 2004 Summer Olympics as his country chose to send Gaydarbek Gaydarbekov, who had lost to him but eventually won Olympic gold. He won the world championships in 2005 against Emilio Correa and the European Championships in 2006, defeating Oleksandr Usyk. He calls his World Cup win over Cuban Yordanis Despaigne the hardest fight of his amateur career, he helped to edge out a 6:5 team win. In 2005 he was part of the Russian team that won the 2005 Boxing World Cup. He once again won the world title by easily beating Sergiy Derevyanchenko and dominating Alfonso Blanco in 2007 by a score of PTS 29:4. At the 2008 Summer Olympics he was off-form and was upset in his second bout by Bakhtiyar Artayev. He decided to turn pro afterwards. His record was 300-12. === World Amateur championship results === 2005 *Defeated Dzhakhon Kurbanov (Tajikistan) RSC *Defeated Jarrod Fletcher (Australia) RSC *Defeated Darren Sutherland (Ireland) RSCO 3 *Defeated Emilio Correa (Cuba) 49-25 *Defeated Ismail Syllakh (Ukraine) RSCO 2 2007 *Defeated Francy Ntetu (Canada) RSC 3 *Defeated Hamyoun Amiri (Ir\u00e1n) RSCO 3 *Defeated Carlos G\u00f3ngora (Ecuador) RSCO 3 *Defeated Wang Jianzheng (China) 22-3 *Defeated Sergiy Derevyanchenko (Ukraine) AB 2 *Defeated Alfonso Blanco (boxer) (Venezuela) 29-4 === Olympic results === 2008 *Defeated Naim Terbunja (Albania) 18-6 *lost to Bakhtiyar Artayev (Kazakhstan) 7-10 == Professional career == In his first world title fight on 13 December 2014, Korobov faced Andy Lee for the vacant WBO middleweight title. Even though he was doing well for the first five rounds, the Russian-born would end up hurt and then knocked out in the sixth round, losing his opportunity to become a world champion for the first time in his career. On 22 December 2018, WBC middleweight champion Jermall Charlo was slated to defend his belt against Willie Monroe Jr. However, Monroe Jr's VADA tests came out positive for a banned substance, which meant a new opponent for Charlo was in the works. Korobov ended up being the substitution and gave Charlo a very tough fight, however, was still unable to come out with the win. Korobov started the fight really strong, but gave up the latter part to the WBC champion. After a controversial majority draw against Immanuwel Aleem, Korobov, WBA's number #3 at middleweight at the time would go on to fight WBA's #1, Chris Eubank Jr. for the vacant WBA interim middleweight title, which was also the final eliminator for the full WBA middleweight title. Korobov lost the fight by a second-round TKO and injured his left shoulder during the process. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |32 |Loss |28\u20133\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Chris Eubank Jr. |TKO |2 (12), |7 Dec 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |31 |Draw |28\u20132\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Immanuwel Aleem | |10 |11 May 2019 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |30 |Loss |28\u20132 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jermall Charlo |UD |12 |22 Dec 2018 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |29 |Win |28\u20131 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Jonathan Batista |UD |6 |2 Mar 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |28 |Win |27\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Scott Sigmon |UD |8 |18 Nov 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |27 |Win |26\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Brian Vera |UD |8 |25 Jun 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |26 |Win |25\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Josue Ovando |UD |8 |16 Jan 2016 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |25 |Loss |24\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Andy Lee |TKO |6 (12), |13 Dec 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |24 |Win |24\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jos\u00e9 Uzc\u00e1tegui |UD |10 |28 Jun 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |23 |Win |23\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Emil Gonzalez | |6 (8), |19 Apr 2014 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |22 |Win |22\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Derek Edwards |TKO |9 (10), |7 Dec 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |21 |Win |21\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Grady Brewer |UD |8 |28 Dec 2013 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |20 |Win |20\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ossie Duran |KO |3 (8), |15 Jun 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |19 |Win |19\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Arturo Rodriguez |TKO |5 (8), |16 Feb 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |18 |Win |18\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Milton N\u00fa\u00f1ez |UD |8 |27 Oct 2012 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |17 |Win |17\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Latif Mundy |KO |4 (8), |11 Nov 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |16 |Win |16\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lester Gonzalez |UD |8 |9 Jul 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |15 |Win |15\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Marcos Primera |UD |6 |23 Apr 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Michael Walker |TKO |1 (8), |12 Mar 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Derrick Findley |UD |8 |20 Nov 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Anthony Greenidge |UD |8 |11 Sep 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joshua Snyder |UD |8 |17 Apr 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lamar Harris |TKO |1 (6), |13 Feb 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ken Dunham |TKO |3 (6), |19 Dec 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| James Winchester |UD |6 |14 Nov 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Benjamin Diaz |KO |1 (4), |27 Jun 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Loren Myers | |4 |13 Jun 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Anthony Bartinelli |TKO |2 (4), |2 May 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Cory Jones |TKO |4 (4), |21 Feb 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Roberto Florentino | |1 (4), |26 Jan 2009 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jason Wahr |TKO |1 (4), |13 Dec 2008 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Mario Evangelista | |3 (4), |1 Nov 2008 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |} ==References== ==External links== * *2001 results *Interview by Fightnews *Matt Korobov at PremierBoxingChampions *Matt Korobov - Profile, News Archive & Current Rankings at Box.Live Category:Boxers at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic boxers of Russia Category:1983 births Category:People from Yagodninsky District Category:Middleweight boxers Category:Living people Category:Russian male boxers Category:AIBA World Boxing Championships medalists ",
