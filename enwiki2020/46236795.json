Sharon Wilks, restless niece of Jessie who yearns to leave this region and move to the city, is attracted to Kelly immediately. Jessie's crew, meanwhile, resents Kelly's hard-driving ways, including making everyone work in a torrential rain to meet a lumber quota. A job is given to Jessie's brother, lumberjack Joe Morgan, whose embezzling has forced Jessie to pay his debts. Joe continues to create trouble for the lumberman as well as for Grace, his estranged wife. A resentful Syd, meantime, causes a crash in a speeding truck that starts a forest fire and fatally injures Joe. A helicopter rescue saves lives and the business, as Kelly persuades Sharon to stay by his side. == Cast == *John Payne as Kelly Hansen *William Demarest as Syd Jessup *Agnes Moorehead as Jessie Crain *Richard Arlen as Joe Morgan *Susan Morrow as Sharon Wilks *Roscoe Ates as Beans *Lynne Roberts as Grace Hanson *Walter Reed as Max *Ewing Mitchell as Walt ==Comic book adaptation== * Eastern Color Movie Love #15 (June 1952) == References == == External links == * Category:1952 films Category:1952 adventure films Category:American adventure films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Edward Ludwig Category:Films set in forests Category:Paramount Pictures films Category:Films adapted into comics ",
