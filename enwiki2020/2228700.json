The river, which is the largest in Iberia, and tidal, those of a later day called Baetis, and there are some who think that Tartessus was the ancient name of Carpia, a city of the Iberians.\" ==See also== *Arganthonios *Tartessian language *Spanish mythology Category:Sunken cities Category:Underwater ruins Category:Former populated places in Spain Category:Tartessos ",
