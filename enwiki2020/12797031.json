    "text": "Ithaka Darin Pappas (born July 8, 1966), often known simply as Ithaka, is an American sculptor, painter, photographer, songwriter, vocalist, hip hop artist, writer, poet, record producer and surfer of partial Greek descent. His visual work has appeared in exhibitions at the International Center of Photography in New York, The Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles, Mus\u00e9e d'Art Contemporain in Marseille (France) and S\u00e3o Paulo Museum of Image and Sound (Brazil). Pappas was born and raised in Southern California, but later established himself in Japan, Greece, Portugal, Brazil and Mexico. The artist currently resides in California. ==Career== In Lisbon, he recorded his first two hip hop albums, Flowers And The Color Of Paint and Stellafly. His song, \"Escape From The City Of Angels\" (featuring Marta Dias) appeared on the soundtrack for Columbia Pictures' feature release, The Replacement Killers. He is also the lyricist/vocalist of the 1992 vocal-poem \"So Get Up\", which has been remixed by several international electronic music artists such as Armin Van Buuren, Cosmic Gate, Danny Tenaglia, DJ Vibe, Fatboy Slim, and Meat Katie. During his active years in Portugal, the artist's musical projects were nominated for a total of nine Pemios Blitz (the Portuguese equivalent of the Grammy Awards) including; Best Album (for Flowers And The Color Of Paint in 1995 and Stellafly in 1997) and Best Male Vocalist (in 1995 and 1997). In addition, the prestigious national newspaper, Publico, awarded his 1997 release Stellafly as \"Album Of The Year\" and considered a song from the record Seabra Is Mad as both the \"Song Of The Year\" and \"Video Of The Year\". Publico also cited his debut release Flowers And The Color Of Paint as one of the country's Ten Most Influential Albums Of The 1990s. In 1994, \"So Get Up\" was nominated for \"Song Of The Year\" at that year's Blitz Awards, and later climbed to 8th place on Billboard UK Independent Dance Charts (and 52nd on Billboard U.S. Independent Dance Charts). More than twenty years after its original release (with at leased 1,029 released remixes of the original vocal), \"So Get Up\" was deemed by Guinness World Records as being the most remixed vocal a cappella in musical history. In 1998, after over six years in Portugal, Pappas returned to California where he recorded his third album called Somewhere South Of Somalia with producer Conley Abrams III. The lyrics from this album were written on a two-month journey into East Africa. Later, in Rio de Janeiro he recorded two more albums, Recorded In Rio and Saltwater Nomad. In 2007, he briefly returned to Portugal to record with former Underground Sound of Lisbon member DJ Vibe, providing vocals and lyrics for the track \"You\". In 2011, indie label Sweatlodge Records released Fishdaddy Flashbacks highlighting some of the artist's songs from the beginning of his career in 1994 until 2011. In early 2013, Pappas produced his first all- instrumental album, Voiceless Blue Raven. He also collaborated with the trip hop vocalist Cyncy. In addition to creating music, his short story series entitled Fishdaddy Chronicles has appeared in international surfing magazines including Surfer, The Surfer's Journal, Water, and Transworld Surf. In 2009, his short story \"Miracle At Malibu\" was published in the book entitled Surf Story, a collective volume of stories and surf culture compiled by Robb Havassy. His abstract photographic art and body of sculpture work known as The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard have been exhibited globally, by The Camp in Costa Mesa, California in June 2010, Gallery Alma Do Mar in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil in October 2010, WOA-Way Of Arts in Lisbon, Portugal in December 2012, Hurley International in Orange County, California in October 2013, and F+ Gallery in Santa Ana, California from February to March 2015. Between 2010 and 2015, the artist created most of his musical, photographic and sculptural works at Recanto Akahti, his small ranch in rural South America located on the edge of the Atlantic Forest (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica) in AkahtiL\u00e2ndia. ==The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard== Bucerius Palus Tinea a reincarnated surfboard sculpture by Ithaka Darin Pappas from the series Aliens Of AkahtiLandia 2015Amanari a reincarnated surfboard sculpture by artist Ithaka Darin Pappas from the series Jurema 2009 In 1989, while living in the Miracle Mile district of Los Angeles, Pappas began one of his major art projects, The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard, a large body of contemporary sculpture work created using recycled surfboards as raw building material and repurposing them into contemporary wall-mounted art pieces. The series to date, which is said to contain an estimated three hundred full-sized sculptures, has been exhibited on four continents and featured in hundreds of magazines and on many TV features. The most recent solo exhibitions of these works were hosted by Hurley Clothing in Costa Mesa, California in October 2013 and WOA: Way Of Arts in Cascais, Portugal in December 2012. He has been active with this medium since its inception; with additional individual pieces made in Mexico. In December 2012, during an interview piece regarding his solo showing of surfboard sculptures at Gallery WOA in Lisbon, Fuel TV Europe declared that Pappas was \"The Godfather of Contemporary Surf Art\". Works from this project appear in the private collections of international surfing celebrities and Hollywood production companies. In Oscar-winning actress Marlee Matlin's non-fictional book entitled, I'll Scream Later, she says of Ithaka's work with The Reincarnation Of A Surfboard project, \"He turns surfboards into art, seriously\". ==Photographer== Pappas began experimenting with his father's 35mm and medium format film cameras as early as age five. He started assisting professional photographers immediately after high school and within a year began publishing much of his own work. His primary early focus was on portraiture, mostly musicians and actors. As a regular free-lancer for hip hop labels Priority Records, Ruthless Records and Quality Records, he helped document the early West Coast urban music scene. He has also worked sporadically in the fashion world, mostly for Fairchild Publications' Women's Wear Daily and Daily News Record. In addition, his photographs have appeared in Essence, Elle, Glamour, Surf Portugal, Fluir (Brazil), Deja-Vu (Japan), Los Angeles Times, Los Angeles North Shore Magazine, Publico (Portugal), Speak Magazine, Revista Super Som (Portugal), Rolling Stone, Shape, Switch (Japan), Teen Vogue, Orange County Register, The Beach Reporter, Thrasher, OnFire (Portugal), Vibe and Water. Musician Brian Wilson in a West Los Angeles recording studio, 1990 (photographed by Ithaka Darin Pappas). His celebrity subjects have included Bebe Moore Campbell, Brian Wilson, Chuck Liddell, Eazy-E, Ice Cube, Gabrielle Anwar, Giancarlo Esposito, Lea Thompson, A Lighter Shade of Brown, Marlee Matlin, N.W.A., Oliver Sacks, Richard Tyler, Robert Anton Wilson, Rudy Rucker, Scott Weiland, Takashi Murakami, Teddy Riley, Terence McKenna, WC, and William Travilla. His advertising clients have included Young Chang Pianos, Independent Truck Company, Priority Records, Quality Records, EMI Records, Polygram Records, Redley Shoes (Brazil) and Ocean Pacific clothing. Perhaps the most well-known commercial photographic works by Pappas are his early images of the influential Los Angeles Gangsta rap group N.W.A.. Pappas worked for their West Coast record label Priority Records between 1988 and 1991 and documented almost the entire lifespan of the group, from their South Central beginnings, stardom, and eventual disassembly. The pictures from these early sessions, particularly The Miracle Mile Shot, which features all five members of the project photographed on a white backdrop at Pappas' own apartment in Los Angeles, has been printed in Rolling Stone, Q magazine (UK), The Hundreds, Blitz Magazine (Portugal) etc., and was used as the primary backdrop for the entire NWA segment of the 2016 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Brooklyn, New York. That same image also appears in the 2017 HBO documentary, The Defiant Ones, about Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine directed by Allen Hughes. In 2018, images from Ithaka's catalogue of Eazy E and NWA (and Fab Five Freddy hosting their first interview on Yo! MTV Raps) appeared in the book Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop and subsequent 2019 exhibit hosted by The Annenberg Space for Photography in Los Angeles and in 2020 another showing in New York at the International Center of Photography. Both the book and exhibits were created by culture journalist Vikki Tobak. The images feature a bullet-proof vested Eazy E skateboarding with locals in Venice Beach. These are the only known images of Eazy E skateboarding. In a May 2019 interview with VladTV, Fab 5 Freddy stated regarding the day, \"When I did that first show with NWA\u2014and we ended up at Venice Beach\u2014Eazy E sees these kids skateboarding. And Easy goes and jumps on a skateboard. And he\u2019s holding his own skating around in Venice Beach\u2026 You just wouldn\u2019t think of the quintessential architect of a lot of the gangster rap energy being able to get on a skateboard and do his thing at that point in time. This was like \u201989.\" ==Aliens Of AkahtiL\u00e2ndia== In February 2015, the F+ Gallery in Santa Ana, California (founded by Micah Kersh) hosted an all-insect art exhibit entitled \"Aliens Of AkahtiL\u00e2ndia\". The exhibit featured over forty original sculptures, photo, and mixed-media works by Pappas; entirely inspired by insects he had observed and photographed on his small art ranch called AkahtiL\u00e2ndia located in the rural, jungle area of the municipality of Mongagu\u00e1, Brazil. Six guest creators were invited to do individual interpretations of some of the insects: David Clyde Kersh, Erica L. Ellingson, Ian Morris, Nathan Paul Gibbs, Will Thompson, and Steven R. Kutcher. The opening event also included a live presentation by actress/insect handler Diana Terranova who encouraged attendees to participate by petting and even holding exotic arachnids such as tarantulas and Thelyphonida. ==\"So Get Up\" controversies== In December of 1992, Pappas wrote and recited a poem called \"So Get Up\" for his weekly segment on a radio program called \"Quatro Bairro\" on R\u00e1dio Comercial in Lisbon, Portugal. In February of 1993 he made an electronic musical version in Manchester, UK. Nine months later, he re-recorded it as a 'guest performer' to be the primary vocal of a B-Side single for the Portuguese dance music group called the \"Underground Sound of Lisbon.\" The USL remix of \"So Get Up\" became an instant national hit and was later released internationally as a ten-mix, double vinyl set on New York's Tribal Records (a subsidiary of I.R.S. Records/EMI). The song climbed to 8th place on the Billboard Independent Dance Music Chart for the UK\u2014and number 52nd in the United States. Since 1995, the song has been remixed by many artists such as Fat Boy Slim, Junior Vasquez, Danny Tenaglia, Miss Kittin, Armin Van Buuren, and Cosmic Gate, and has appeared on over 350 compilations with combined sales/downloads in the tens of millions. Ironically, the song which was considered the first modern \"Portuguese\" musical export was released without even crediting Pappas, even though he was the primary publishing rights owner of the track and never a member of the Underground Sound of Lisbon project. Reportedly no actual record royalties were ever paid to Ithaka. In 1999, Samsung used a version of So Get Up (remixed by the UK Breakbeat duo Stretch N Vern) for a printer advertising campaign featuring Jun Ji-Hyun. According to most media sources the commercial transformed Jun into a teen icon in Korea (today Jun is one of the most highly paid and most awarded actresses in all of Asia). The commercial, produced by Cheil Worldwide in Seoul, reportedly did not credit or pay either Pappas or Stretch N Vern. ==Works== ===Solo releases=== *1992 So Get Up (demo single released by Embryo Entertainment)https://www.discogs.com/ITHAKA-So-Get- Up-1993/release/13886981 *1993 So Get Up & The Lost Acapellas (spoken word album) Sweatlodge Recordshttps://www.discogs.com/Ithaka-So-Get-Up-The-Lost- Acapellas/release/9795323https://genius.com/albums/Ithaka/So-get-up-the-lost- acapellashttps://lyrics.az/ithaka/so-get-up-the-lost-acapellas/ *1995 Fishdaddy \u2013 CD single released with Super Jovem Magazine [Fabrica De Sons/Movieplay Records] *1995 Flowers and the Color of Paint \u2013 13-song CD album [Fabrica De Sons/Movieplay Records] *1997 Seabra Is Mad \u2013 CD single with bonus track Butterfly Of Wisdom [Nortesul/Valentim de Carvalho/EMI] *1997 Stay Strong Little Brother \u2013 CD single [Nortesul/Valentim de Carvalho/EMI] *1997 Stellafly: European Edition \u2013 17-song CD album [Nortesul/Valentim de Carvalho/EMI] *1998 The Rise And Fall Of A Fortune \u2013 8-song e.p.

The poem was originally recorded for Radio Antenna 1 in Lisbon, Portugal. However, most musical versions stemmed from uses/sampling of the a cappella version that he recorded for Underground Sound of Lisbon in Portugal, 1994. ==References== ==External links== * *Ithaka's Instagram page *Ithaka's Official website *Ithaka's Facebook page *Ithaka's Twitter page *Ithaka's Beatport page Category:1966 births Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Alternative hip hop musicians Category:American expatriates in Brazil Category:American hip hop musicians Category:American male short story writers Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American people of Greek descent Category:American short story writers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American spoken word poets Category:Portuguese musicians Category:Portuguese male musicians Category:Rappers from California Category:Record producers from California Category:Songwriters from California Category:Surf musicians Category:21st- century American rappers ",
