The campus includes 13 newly renovated buildings and various laboratories devoted to marine biology, marine chemistry, oceanography, C.A.D., and multi-media. The buildings were previously mess halls and latrines for the \"Tent City\" that was set up at Fort Hancock for a time during World War II. A Technology Workshop, a Media Center containing a Computer Classroom, a Naval Science Building, a state of the art wet lab in the James J. Howard Marine Science laboratory, and other classrooms round out the facilities. There is also hands-on instruction on the school research vessel, the R/V Blue Sea for underclassmen and some seniors. The \"R/V Blue Sea\" is currently berthed at the Coast Guard Station on Sandy Hook. This vessel is extensively used throughout many core classes in the curriculum including marine biology, marine chemistry, marine physics, and oceanography.A Brief look at M.A.S.T, accessed May 12, 2006.

The unit is designated as an Area 4 school and participates in many inter-unit competitions, the most prominent of which is the Drill Team. Motivated cadets can participate in several disciplines including Freshmen, Color Guard, Armed Platoon, Unarmed Platoon, Unarmed Exhibition, and Armed Exhibition. In the past, MAST has been successful at several area competitions, including Neptune, Linden, and Area 4. Exceptional performance in the Area 4 Drill Competition (placing first in 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012) has qualified the school for national competition in Pensacola, Florida for those years. In 2016,the MAST Drill Team attended Navy Nationals once again in Pensacola, Florida, their first time back since 2012. Each year, cadets at MAST are subject to a Physical Fitness Test (PFT). The standards for this exam are based upon Navy guidelines. Grades are based upon a point scale and range from Unsatisfactory to Outstanding. These superlatives translate into number grades and are a portion of the Naval Science grade for credit. Additionally, satisfactory PFT performance is criteria for advancement and promotion. At the end of each year, qualified cadets are promoted to a rank and billet commensurate with academic performance, ability, and PFT results. The MAST unit is organized into a battalion with four companies and a headquarters section. The highest rank a cadet can achieve is Cadet Commander. ==Awards== * For the 1997-1998 and 2013 school years, Marine Academy of Science and Technology received the Blue Ribbon Award from the United States Department of Education, the highest honor that an American school can achieve. * MAST was one of two high schools recognized by the New Jersey \"Star School\" program in its inaugural year of 1993\u201394.Star School Award recipient detail, New Jersey Department of Education, Archived December 18, 2006.
