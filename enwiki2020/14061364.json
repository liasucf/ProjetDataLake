    "text": "Exportin 1 (XPO1), also known as chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), is a eukaryotic protein that mediates the nuclear export of proteins, rRNA, snRNA, and some mRNA. == History == XPO1 (CRM1) originally was identified in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe in a genetic screen, and investigators determined that it was involved in control of the chromosome structure == Function == Exportin 1 mediates leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES)-dependent protein transport. Exportin 1 specifically mediates the nuclear export of Rev and U snRNAs. It is involved in the control of several cellular processes by controlling the localization of cyclin B, MAPK, and MAPKAP kinase 2. This protein also regulates NFAT and AP-1. == Interactions == XPO1 has been shown to interact with: * APC, * CDKN1B, * CIITA, * NMD3, * Nucleoporin 62, * RANBP1, * RANBP3, * Ran, * SMARCB1, and * p53. == See also == * Karyopherin * Selinexor == References == == Further reading == * * * * * == External links == * 3D electron microscopy structures of CRM1 from the EM Data Bank(EMDB) ",
