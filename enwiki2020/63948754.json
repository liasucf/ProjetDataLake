Some of his most significant work include the 900 houses built on the Beeston Rylands estate in the late 1930s. ==Architectural career== He entered into a partnership with Nehemiah Rigley as Architects, Surveyors and Land Agents, based at offices at 13 St Peter's Gate, Nottingham, but this partnership was dissolved in 1926. Later he was based in offices at 45 Burton St, Nottingham. He undertook a significant development in designing 900 houses to be built in Beeston south of Beeston railway station on an 57-acre estate which was then called Cliftonside, but is now known as Beeston Rylands. The houses were built as \u2018dwellings for working men\u2019 which at a total cost of \u00a3400 () only required an initial deposit of \u00a320 and weekly repayments of 9s 9d. The semi-detached houses comprised a sitting room 11 ft 6in by 10 ft 3in, a living room 2 ft longer, a kitchen/scullery and upstairs three bedrooms and bathroom. ==Personal life== He was born on 26 December 1888 to Alexander Wilson (b. 1855), licensed victualler and his second wife Sarah Ann Stafford (b. 1853). Around 1925 he moved to Wollaton Road, Beeston and in 1927 he stood as an Independent Conservative candidate in the Beeston Council Elections. He was a member of the Constitutional Club, the Conservative Club and the Primrose Club.
