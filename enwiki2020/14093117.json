During Fletcher's time as Dean of Peterborough Cathedral he was present at the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots on 8 February 1587, described by Fraser as \"pray(ing) out loud and at length, in a prolonged and rhetorical style as though determined to force his way into the pages of history\" (1969:584), and presided over her initial funeral and burial at Peterborough Cathedral. Fletcher was elected Bishop of Bristol on 13 November 1589 and consecrated on 14 December 1589.
