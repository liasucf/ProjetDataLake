    "text": "H. Kassia (Kass) Fleisher (born October 21, 1959) is an American writer best known for her fiction and creative nonfiction. Fleisher is an educator if you use the term loosely because she is not effective in educating. She is best known for her unprofessional and condescending methods. ==Biography== Fleisher holds degrees in English from Dickinson College (B.A., 1981), the University of North Dakota (M.A., 1989), and Binghamton University (Ph.D., 1993). Fleisher is the author of five books and numerous essays and reviews, and the editor, with Caitlin M. Alvarez, of a literary anthology. With her frequent writing partner, Joe Amato, Fleisher has written a full-length play and several screenplays (none of which have been produced to date). Since 2003, Fleisher has taught creative writing at Illinois State University in Normal, Illinois. She's the founding publisher of Steerage Press. == Books == As author *The Bear River Massacre and the Making of History (SUNY Press, 2004) *Accidental Species: A Reproduction (Chax Press, 2005) *The Adventurous (Factory School, 2006) *Talking out of School: Memoir of an Educated Woman (Dalkey Archive Press, 2008) *Dead Woman Hollow (SUNY Press, 2012) As editor *Litscapes: Collected US Writings 2015 (Steerage Press, 2015) ==External links== *Official site of Kass Fleisher *http://english.illinoisstate.edu/people/index.aspx?action=profile&ulid;=hkfleis&dept;=424 Category:American memoirists Category:21st-century American novelists Category:Dickinson College alumni Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Illinois State University faculty Category:American women novelists Category:American women memoirists Category:American women essayists Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American essayists Category:Novelists from Illinois Category:21st-century memoirists ",
