Then in 1994, it became KPLA and has consistently been a Top 3 radio station in the market, playing \"soft rock.\" KPLA broadcasts from the highest tower in Columbia, Missouri, reaching within Mid-Missouri. ==History== Al Germond was responsible for engineering and applying for the 101.7 frequency for KARO-FM under the company name of Columbia FM.

Later came additional radio stations, including KBXR-FM 102.3, KOQL-FM 106.1, KJMO-FM, KLIK-AM, KBBM-FM and KZJF-FM, as well as ownership of the Columbia Business Times publishing products. By February 2004, the company had become Premier Marketing Group and sold the radio stations to Cumulus Broadcasting for $38.75 million.Columbia Daily Tribune Cumulus Broadcasting assumed operation on March 1, 2004. ==Programming== Playing soft rock music from the 70s, 80s, 90s and 2K, KPLA remains one of the top-three radio stations in Columbia after 25 years on-the- air. Notable weekday programming on the station includes \"Good Mornings\", hosted by Emily Larkin and Ross Murdoch.
