But his ex-wife, Olivia was cheating on him with his best friend, Del Douglas and was almost always drunk. His kids, Caitlin and Sean, fell in love with people that Gregory hated. While doing everything in his best interest, Gregory did his best to scare or kill his daughter's boyfriend, Cole Deschanel and remove his son's runaway girlfriend, Tiffany. Although Gregory couldn't convince his kids to leave their loved ones, Gregory was happy when his wife got pregnant. Things were great, but he didn't know that Olivia didn't know who was the father of the baby. When his daughter miscarried during a car accident, she asked Annie Douglas Richards to help her find a baby, and Annie plotted to take away Olivia's child and present it as Caitlin's. Gregory was hurt when Olivia told him that their baby was born dead and their marriage was over. Then, during the summer of 1998, Annie plotted her way to Gregory and they tied the knot on the day that Annie could have lost her father's money. Of course, Annie and Gregory's marriage was everything but perfect. Annie was always plotting to get what she wanted and Gregory had other concerns. He never stopped trying to remove Cole from his daughter's life. His son had already forgotten about his father because he never did anything for him. Gregory and the rest of the family was shocked when the truth about Trey's real mother and Olivia's affair was discovered. At the beginning of 1999, Francesca Vargas was murdered and half of the citizens were suspected of the crime. But it was actually Gregory who killed Francesca. After having a huge fight with Cole, Gregory fell into the ocean and was never found. However, he came onto shore a day later and decided to play with the minds of his loved ones. He pretended to be Tobias Richards, Gregory's relative and messed with everyone's minds. He was eventually caught by Jude Cavanaugh (Annie Douglas's love interest) and he is sent to prison for Franchesca's murder as Gregory's reign of terror at Sunset Beach is finally over.
