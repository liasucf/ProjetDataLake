    "text": "Young Bombs are a Canadian EDM duo currently signed to Astralwerks. The duo is based in Vancouver, Canada, and it is composed of DJ/producers, Tristan Norton and Martin Kottmeier. Starting in 2014, the pair began working on remixes for acts like The Chainsmokers, Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish, Galantis, and numerous others. In 2019, they began releasing original music for the first time with the single, \"Starry Eyes\", which reached No. 31 on Dance Club Songs chart. ==History== Tristan Norton and Martin Kottmeier are both natives of Vancouver, Canada and met while playing in different bands in high school. The two began making music together and eventually moved to Los Angeles to form part of the backing band for a pop artist. They moved back to Vancouver some time after and began writing jingles, including one for Pizza Hut. The two also initially wanted to form an indie rock band. The name \"Young Bombs\" comes from a short- lived band they formed with another friend. The two decided to focus on EDM after Kottmeier took an interest in the genre. In 2014, the two released various remixes of songs by acts like Galantis (\"You\"), Cazzette (\"Sleepless\"), and Sigma (\"Nobody to Love\"), among others. In 2015, the Young Bombs played their first live show, opening for The Chainsmokers at New City Gas in Montreal. That year, they also continued releasing remixes, including those for Nick Jonas (\"Teacher\"), Secondcity (\"I Wanna Feel\"), and Fletcher (\"War Paint\"). In 2016, the pair played in Las Vegas for the first time, again opening up for The Chainsmokers at Hakkasan. New remixes that year included those for acts like Billie Eilish (\"Ocean Eyes\"), Troye Sivan (\"Wild\"), and Rozes (\"Burn Wild\"), among others. In 2017, Young Bombs played numerous festivals, including Lollapalooza, the Firefly Music Festival and the Shaky Beats Music Festival. They also released remixes of songs by Lady Gaga (\"The Cure\") and Selena Gomez (\"Kill Em with Kindness\") among others. In November 2017, the duo released a 7-minute spoof of the Netflix series, Stranger Things, entitled, Stranger Bombs. The video featured cameos from Shaun Frank and The Chainsmokers' Alex Pall and also included portions of the Young Bombs' remix of Alan Walker's \"Faded\". In 2018, the duo played at the Life Is Beautiful Music & Art Festival. They also released remixes for The Chainsmokers (\"This Feeling\" featuring Kelsea Ballerini), Bazzi (\"Mine\"), and Weezer (\"Say It Ain't So\"). In March 2019, the duo released its first original single, \"Starry Eyes.\" It was also the first recording they released after signing to Astralwerks. Young Bombs released a second song, \"Don't Let Them\", in May 2019. That year, the duo also played the main stage at the Ultra Music Festival in Miami. As of April 2019, the Young Bombs have released around 85 remixes. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of extended plays, with selected chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:11.5em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:18.5em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| Canada Top 40 ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Dance Club Songs ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Mix Show Airplay |- ! scope=\"row\"| The Young Bombs Show | * Released: 23 October 2020 * Label: Astralwerks * Format: Digital download | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"3\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| Canada Top 40 ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Dance Club Songs ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"| US Mix Show Airplay |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Starry Eyes\" | rowspan=\"5\"| 2019 | 20 || 31 || \u2014 | rowspan=\"3\"| The Young Bombs Show |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Don't Let Them\" | \u2014 || \u2014 || 15 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Loyal\" (featuring GiGi) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Where the Shadow Ends\" (with Banners) | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 | Where The Shadow Ends |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Better Day\" (featuring Aloe Blacc) | 16 || 26 || 30 | rowspan=\"2\"| The Young Bombs Show |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"High Road\" (featuring Robinson) | 2020 | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- |} ===Select remixes=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of remixes with selected details ! scope=\"col\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Original artist |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"You\" | rowspan=\"5\"| 2014 | Galantis |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Sleepless\" | Cazzette |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"My Love\" | Route 94 (feat.
