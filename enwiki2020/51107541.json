    "text": "Inderhavnsbroen (lit.: The Inner Harbour Bridge) is a bridge across the Copenhagen inner harbour and is a combined pedestrian and bicyclist bridge directed east-west. The bridge is joined to Nyhavn (west) and Christianshavn (east). The bridge was designed by Flint & Neill with Studio Bednarski and Hardesty & Hanover, and opened to the public on 7 July 2016. The design includes a bulge that requires cyclists to make a sharp turn. This feature has attracted criticism. ==See also== * Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge, a similar bridge that also had a \"bulge\" associated with at least one fatal incident ==References== Category:Bridges in Copenhagen Category:Port of Copenhagen Category:Bridges completed in 2016 ",
