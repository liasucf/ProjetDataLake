    "text": "The Chahar-Jurchen War was a military conflict waged between the Chahar Mongols and the Jurchen Later Jin dynasty and several other Mongol groups from 1619 to 1634. ==Background== Ligdan Khan of the Chahar Mongols sought to restore Chahar hegemony over the southern Mongols. He sought alliances with the Khalka Mongols, the Ming dynasty, and the Yehe Jurchens to counter the power of Nurhaci and his Later Jin dynasty. ==War== In 1619, Ligdan Khan attacked Guangning, a horse trading town under the protection of Nurhaci. He was defeated. Arbitrary treatment of his allies led to their defection to the Jurchens from 1622 to 1624. Another attack by Ligdan in 1625 was turned back by a combined Khorchin Jurchen force. In 1627, Ligdan attacked the Khorchins for blocking his access to the horse trade. However he was turned back and forced further west, where he attacked the Tumed Mongols, taking K\u00f6ke Khota from Boshtu Khan. In 1628, Ligdan was defeated by a Mongol alliance at Juu Khota. In 1629, Ligdan attacked the Ming dynasty at Datong and extracted a large subsidies from them. In 1631, Ligdan launched a last offensive against the Khorchin, however his allies deserted him. In 1632, Ligdan came under attack from Hong Taiji. In 1634, he fled west but died of smallpox at Qinghai Lake, and the Chahars were incorporated into the Eight Banners. ==Aftermath== The defeat of Ligdan Khan in 1634, in addition to winning the allegiance of the Southern Mongol hordes, brought a vast supply of horses to the Qing, while denying the same supply to the Ming. The Qing also captured the Great Seal of the Mongol Khans, giving them the opportunity to portray themselves as heirs of the Yuan dynasty as well. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * Category:Wars involving the states and peoples of Asia ",
