During Nowruz on March 21, 1691, Taher Vahid was appointed by shah Suleiman I as his vizier. During the same year, Shahqoli Khan Zanganeh, who had been recently appointed as the head of the royal bodyguard (qurchi-bashi), became a rival with Taher Vahid. During a royal ceremony, Suleiman requested Taher Vahid to explain what he saw as the most important things for Iran. Taher Vahid's response made the shah award him much more power than he used to have. However, Taher Vahid was not as great as his predecessors, due to his great age, which made him the lack the energy for the office. In 1694, Suleiman died and was succeeded by his son Sultan Husayn. In 1699, Taher Vahid died, and was succeeded by Mohammad Mo'men Khan Shamlu. == References == == Sources == * * * == External links == * Category:Grand Viziers of the Safavid Empire Category:17th-century Iranian people Category:1620s births Category:1699 deaths Category:People from Qazvin Category:Persian poets Category:Turkish poets Category:17th-century people of the Safavid Empire ",
