    "text": "The Kazan Governorate (; ; ), or the Government of Kazan, was a governorate (a guberniya) of the Tsardom of Russia, the Russian Empire, and the Russian SFSR from 1708\u20131920, with its seat in the city of Kazan. ==History== Kazan Governorate, together with seven other governorates, was established on , 1708, by Tsar Peter the Great's edict\u0423\u043a\u0430\u0437 \u043e\u0431 \u0443\u0447\u0440\u0435\u0436\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u0433\u0443\u0431\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0438 \u043e \u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043a \u043d\u0438\u043c \u0433\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0432 on the lands of the Khanates of Kazan, Sibir, and Astrakhan, with addition of some lands from the Nogai Horde. These were the areas historically governed by the Kazan Palace's Prikaz. As with the rest of the governorates, neither the borders nor internal subdivisions of Kazan Governorate were defined; instead, the territory was defined as a set of cities and the lands adjacent to those cities. In 1717, Astrakhan Governorate was separated from Kazan Governorate; in 1719\u2014Nizhny Novgorod; in 1744\u2014Orenburg; in 1781\u2014Vyatka, Simbirsk, and Ufa Governorates were separated. Under Catherine the Great (1781\u20131796) Kazan was the center of a namestnichestvo (viceroyalty), with Kazan, Penza, and Saratov Governorates as its integral parts. At first the governorate was divided into lots (, doli), then into provinces (, provintsii) in 1719, and into uyezds () in 1775. Prior to 1796, there were Kazan, Kozmodemyansk, Laishev, Mamadysh, Sviyazhsk, Spassk, Tetyushi, Tsaryovokokshaysk, Tsivilsk, Cheboksary, Chistopol, and Yadrin uyezds. In 1913, the area of the governorate comprised 55,900 square versts, its population was estimated at 2.85 million (38.9% Russians, 31.2% Tatars, 22.8% Chuvash, 5.1% Mari, 1.2% Mordva). There were 7,272 settlements, including 13 towns: Kazan, Arsk, Sviyazhsk, Kozmodemyansk, Laishev, Mamadysh, Spassk, Tetyushi, Tsaryovokokshaysk, Tsivilsk, Cheboksary, Chistopol, Yadrin; and two posads: Mariinsky Posad and Troitsky Posad. The governorate was finally abolished during the Bolshevik administrative reform (see Idel-Ural State). Thereupon its Eastern part was proclaimed the Tatar ASSR, while the Western part was eventually divided between Chuvashia and Mari El. ==Main events in the governorate== *1774 Pugachev rebellion *1861 Bizn\u00e4 Unrest *1880s W\u00e4isi movement ==References== ==External links== *Results of 1897 all-imperial census for Kazan Governorate ==Further reading== * Category:History of Tatarstan Category:Governorates of the Russian Empire Category:States and territories established in 1708 Category:1920 disestablishments Category:1708 establishments in Russia ",
