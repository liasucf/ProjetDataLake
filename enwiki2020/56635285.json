    "text": "Exit Popularity Contest is a compilation album from Norwegian band Apoptygma Berzerk. It was released on October 7, 2016. The album collects three limited edition 12\" vinyl singles, Stop Feeding the Beast, Videodrome and Xenogenesis, which were released between 2014 and 2016. Exit Popularity Contest eschews both the band's EBM roots and synth rock work in favor of electronic compositions closer in style to synth pioneers Tangerine Dream. The album includes a reworking of their 2002 single \"Until the End of the World\" from their album Harmonizer, here retitled \"U.T.E.O.T.W.\". ==Track listing== Category:Apoptygma Berzerk albums Category:2016 albums ",
