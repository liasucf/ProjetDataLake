    "text": "My\u014fnggan County, formerly known as Hwas\u014fng County, is a kun, or county, in North Hamgyong province, North Korea. Unlike many Korean districts that date from the Joseon Dynasty, Hwasong was created after liberation. Y\u014fngan was established in 1952, separated from My\u014fngch'\u014fn. In 1967 Y\u014fngan was renamed to My\u014fnggan, in 1981 to Hwas\u014fng, and in 2004 to My\u014fnggan. My\u014fnggan abuts the Sea of Japan (East Sea of Korea). Most of the land is rugged, with only one small plain along the Hwasongchon stream. The highest point in the county is Kiunbong. There are no ports, and the coastline is distinctively monotonous. The chief streams of the county are the \u014erangch'\u014fn (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uc5b4\ub791\ucc9c, Hancha: \u6f01\u90ce\u5ddd) and My\u014fngganch'\u014fn (Chos\u014fn'g\u016dl: \uba85\uac04\ucc9c, Hancha: \u660e\u6f97\u5ddd). More than 80% of the county is taken up by forestland. My\u014fnggan is known for its pear orchards. In addition, livestock are widely raised. There are also coal mines in the county.
