    "text": "Jane Margaret Soons (18 June 1931 \u2013 8 September 2020) was a New Zealand geomorphologist and pioneering role model for female students. In 1971, she was the first woman professor at the University of Canterbury, and possibly the first in New Zealand. == Biography == Soons was born on 18 June 1931, and grew up in a council cottage in the small English village of Great Gonerby. Her father, Lewin Soons, worked for the railways. He was a good Trade Unionist and loved reading books. Her mother, Jenny, was a hard worker. After Lewin became bedridden with tuberculosis, Jenny took over tending their large vegetable garden and orchard that provided a little income. At age eleven, Soons won a scholarship to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School and started in the third form the year that Margaret Thatcher was a prefect at the school. In 1949, she won another scholarship, this time to University of Sheffield. She recalled that her choice to study Geography was \"just one of those things\"; however, she soon became enthralled with the subject. She attained a BA Hons in 1952 and DipEd in 1953, and went on to spend five months studying applied geomorphology at the University of Strasbourg. Subsequently, in 1958, she became one of the first ever woman PhD graduates in geography at the University of Glasgow. After tutoring at two British universities, she became fed-up with being overlooked for higher academic positions, due to what she described as \"an inbred feeling that this was not a women\u2019s world\". Through George Jobberns she heard about a lecturer position on the other side of the world, at the University of Canterbury's Department of Geography. In 1960s Britain, the idea that a woman could combine an academic career with having a family was viewed as odd; New Zealanders, she later learnt, were, on the whole, rather less anti-woman and more relaxed. At the geography department in Christchurch, she felt accepted, and discovered that she was expected to do everything that the men did. Hard work led to promotion, promotion led to research opportunities, research led to a professorship, and a professorship made her a role model. For many years the sole woman academic staff member; by 2019 seven out of 17 academic staff in the geography department were women. Soons is nationally and internationally known for her investigations of glacier-sculpted landforms in the Rakaia Valley and her contribution to debates around environmental change in the central South Island. She served as head of department from 1990 until she retired. On her retirement in 1993, Soons was accorded the title of professor emeritus. Other highlights of her distinguished careers include being president of the International Union of Quaternary Research and convenor of the National Committee for Quaternary Research for the Royal Society. In addition to writing and collaborating on books and journal articles, she wrote an entry for the Dictionary of New Zealand Biography on George Jobberns, the geographer and educator, who played a role in her immigrating to New Zealand. Soons was never one to sit idle, and even after retirement, she taught at the Canterbury Workers' Educational Association (CWEA) and was secretary of both the UC Alumni Association and the Diamond Harbour Ladies Bowling Club. Soons died in Christchurch on 8 September 2020. == Awards == * Erskine Fellowship 1975 * David Livingstone Centenary Medal for Southern Hemisphere research (awarded by the American Geographical Society) 1988 * Royal Society Silver Medal 1994 * Honorary Doctor of Science from University of Glasgow 2009 * Distinguished New Zealand Medal (awarded by the New Zealand Geographical Society) 2001 == Selected publications == *Rainfall/runoff relationships at Cass, in the South Island high country, 1970, N.Z.
