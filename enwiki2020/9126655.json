He is known as the learned author of a work about Geomancy,P.O.

Most if not all of what is known about the author derives from information in the book itself. For his authorities Cattan names particularly three Geomantic texts of importance to him. One is the text beginning Estimaverunt Indi, which is identified as a treatise translated by Hugo of Santalla from the Arabic.P. Zambelli, The Speculum Astronomiae and Its Enigma: Astrology, Theology and Science in Alberrtus Magnus and his Contemporaries, Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science, vol. 135 (Springer Science+Business Media, Dordrecht 1992), p. 16 (Google). One is the Tractatus Sphaerae of Bartholomew of Parma, written in 1288.P.

The third is a Hebrew text beginning \"Ha veenestre\". == Provenance == === Gabriel Dupr\u0117au, editor === The first appearance in print of the book of Geomancy bearing Cattan's name is in a form revised and augmented by an editor. The editor was of Marcoussis, Essonne (in the Latin form, Gabriel Prateolus (or Pra\u00efeolus) Marcossius), 1511\u20131588, an anti-Protestant theologian, the notable scholarly translator (from Latin into French) of the works of William of Tyre,Histoire de la Guerre Saincte, dite proprement, la Franciade Orientale (Nicolas Chesnau, Paris 1574).

One Francis Sparry was a bookseller in St Michael Wood Street (in the City of London) who had dealings with the Stationers' Company over the illegal import of bound books from Rouen during the later 1550s.P.W.M. Blayney, The Stationers' Company and the Printers of London, 1501\u20131557 (Cambridge University Press, 2013), pp. 769, 809, 823-24 (Google). The English translation has been attributed to the young Francis Sparry who accompanied Sir Walter Ralegh to Guyana in 1595.The claim is laid by C. Nicholl, The Creature in the Map: A Journey to El Dorado (Jonathan Cape, 1995), pp. 82-86. See J. Lorimer (ed.), Sir Walter Ralegh's \"Discoverie of Guiana\", Hakluyt Society, Series III vol. 15 (Ashgate, London 2006), at pp. 271 ff (Google). As touching the identity of \"Christopher Cattan\", the title page of the original edition calls the author \"Seigneur Christofe de Cattan Gentilhomme Genevoys\". The title Seigneur is equivalent to \"Lord\", and the introduction of \"de\" into the name, and the term \"Gentilhomme\" indicate an aristocratic or gentry status. \"Genevoys\" means \"of Geneva\". The royal authority to publish, dated 1558, signed by the King and by Maistre J[e]an Nicot, and sealed with yellow wax, is granted to Jean Corozet and Gilles Gilles, booksellers of Paris. The opening Epistle (by M. Dupr\u00e9au) dedicates the work to M. Nicot, (Seigneur du Bosnay et du Chesne, Counsellor to the King (then Henry II) and Master of Requests of the \"Hostel\"), and is dated from Paris, 19 September 1558. Having introduced Geomancy, M. Dupr\u00e9au observes that many have attempted to practise this ancient art, but that Christofe de Cattan, a Genevan gentleman, and a man-at-arms of the compagnie de feu of M. de Thais, one with deep interest and knowledge of those matters, has mastered this art and brought it to perfection.\"Christofe de Cattan, gentilhomme Geneuoys, et homme d'armes de la compagnie de feu monsieur de Thais, scavant et experiment\u00e9 es sciences que y appartiennent, la mise et reduicte \u00e0 sa perfection.\" ===Christofe de Cattan and Jean de Thais === Cattan's dedicatee: Jean de Thais (de Ta\u00efx), by Corneille de Lyon (Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9). Seigneur Christofe de Cattan was his servant and man-at-arms. In his own Preface (also included in the printed work), Cattan himself says he has written the book at the request and prayer of \"Monsieur de Tays\" (who is an interested practitioner of this science) as a service to him, for his diversion, or to give to whom he please, as Cattan is his soldier and servant.\"Moy donq' aux pri\u00e8res et requestes de monsieur de Tays, curieux et amateur de ceste science, estant son soldat et serviteur, pour luy faire plaisir ay compos\u00e9 ce livre pour s'en servir, ou le donner \u00e0 qui luy plaira.\" \"Monsieur de Tays\" or \"Thais\" is the senior military commander Jean de Thais (died 1553), Seigneur de Thais (or Tha\u00efx),'Le Sr.de Thais', in F. de Pavie, Baron de Fourquevauls, Les Vies de Plusieurs Grands Capitaines Fran\u00e7ois (Jean du Bray, Paris 1643), pp. 285-98 (Google). who in around 1521 became Master- General of the French Artillery in France. In 1525 his role was extended to include the same office for the French in Italy. In 1543 Fran\u00e7ois I gave him the title of Grand Ma\u00eetre and Capitaine-G\u00e9n\u00e9ral de l'Artillerie. (The title \"Grand ma\u00eetre de l'artillerie de France\" became one of the Great Offices of the Crown in 1599.) He was succeeded by Charles de Coss\u00e9-Brissac in 1547.P.A.J. Allent, Histoire du Corps Imp\u00e9rial du G\u00e9nie 1re Partie (Magimel, Paris 1805), I, p. 652-53 at note 2 (Google). Jean de Thais campaigned extensively in northern Italy and Piedmont for the French King, as well as in northern France against the English, and had many Italian troops in his armies. He died in 1552 or 1553. Biographical context can be derived from the examples given by Cattan in the third book of the G\u00e9omance.Commencing at chapter 6, p. 125 (Internet Archive). (Page references to 1558 edition.) The examples, which Cattan presents as real \"readings\" performed by himself for various named persons, include reference to his master M. de Tays. They include a reading concerning Pope Paul III for the year 1538; M. de Lymoges having gone into Scotland to accompany the Queen,'M. de Lymoges' was the usual term of address to the Bishop, see L. Paris, Negotiations, lettres et pi\u00e8ces diverses relatives au r\u00e8gne de Fran\u00e7ois II (Imprimerie Royale, Paris 1841), passim (Google). If this refers to the marriage of Mary, Queen of Scots, the date is 1548. and to act as Ambassador for the King of France (p. 133); the visit of Cardinal Agostino Trivulzio to France to broker peace between the King and the Emperor (probably 1536) (pp. 140-41); the preparations of Charles V at Nice to make war against Fran\u00e7ois I in Provence (?1538) (pp. 142-43); a reading taken at Fontainebleu for the death of the Comte de Nouelaire (pp. 143-44); the purchase of a horse at Lyon for M. de Tays (pp. 150-51); and a figure for M. de Lymoges in 1538 (pp. 158-59). The author has prepared figures at the direct requests of Seigneur de Thais himself (p. 113-14, p. 144); Seigneur de la Fert\u00e9 (possibly Fran\u00e7ois de la Fert\u00e9, Captain of the Garde du Corps, 2nd French Company), in a romantic question (p. 128); his friend signor Bernard Garimbert, a gentleman of Parma (p. 131); a great lady of the court of the King of France (p. 132); the organist of the Bishop of Limoges (p. 133); the Seigneur de Clermont de Lod\u00e8ve (pp. 134-35); a gentleman of the King's court (pp. 135-36); and the Comte de Tonnerre (p. 142). === Author === Cattan writes that he hopes to bring forward two other works, one on Physiognomy, and one on Chiromancy. M. Dupr\u00e9au goes on to say that a friend gave him the book (presumably in manuscript), and that he has attempted to make it more intelligible, for the original language \"was in many places wonderfully obscure, difficult and defective, and more Italian than French, the author of this work being Italian by speech and nationality, and not very experienced in our French language.\"\"estoit en plusieurs lieux merveilleusement obscur, difficile, et manqu\u00e9, et plus Italien que Fran\u00e7oys, pour estre l'autheur diceluy de nation et langue Italique, et peu exercit\u00e9 en la nostre Fran\u00e7oyse.\" (The \"original\" was therefore written in Italianate French.) Lastly (he says to Maistre Nicot), he has dedicated it to him because that is what the author would have done if he were alive, \"vous cognoissant\" (if he had known him; or, knowing him as he did), since Nicot has sought out many learned and distinguished people on this subject in Italy and Spain. (\"Cattan\" is therefore dead by 1558.J. Balsamo, V. Castiglione Minischetti and G. Dotoli, Les Traductions de l'Italien en Fran\u00e7ais au XVI\u00e8me si\u00e8cle, (Bibliographia 2, Vol. IV), en collaboration avec la Bibliotheque Nationale de France (2009), Schena \u2013 Hermann Editeurs, p. 162.) Dupr\u00e9au's statement that \"Cattan\" was Italian leaves a doubt about the word \"Genevoys\" (i.e., of Geneva, Switzerland), because there was a patrician family of Cattaneo in Genova (i.e. \"Genovese\"), in Liguria (Italy), very prominent at this time. Scholarly opinion at present is said to incline to the identification of a Genovese Cristoforo Cattaneo as the author of the Geomancy, and of this as his only known published work.Cardani Mediolanensis Philosophi ac Medici Celeberrimi Bibliographia Tertia Editio, cura Georgii Vivis (Author, 'Cosmopoli', 2018), p. 18, note 66.
