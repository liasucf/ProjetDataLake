After two seasons in the same category with TSV 1860 Munich, Komljenovi\u0107 retired from football at the age of 35, amassing German top flight totals of 210 games and ten goals. In January 2007, after taking a six-month break, he signed for Union Wei\u00dfkirchen in Austria (third level) and, in June of the following year, he joined another semi-professional side, VfR Jettingen from Bavaria, competing in Bezirksliga Schwaben-Nord, the eight-tier of German football league system.
