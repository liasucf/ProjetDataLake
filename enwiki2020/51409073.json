Anil Kapoor, Arjun Kapoor, Ileana D'Cruz and Athiya Shetty played the lead roles in the film. It is a story about twin brothers. The film was released worldwide on 28 July 2017 in 2350 screens in India and 475 screens overseas. ==Plot== The story starts with a couple traveling with their twin boys in a car. The dad is exhausted and dozes off at the wheel causing an accident. The couple dies but the twins survive. The twins are sent to their uncle, Kartar Singh (Anil Kapoor). As he is a confirmed bachelor, he decides to give one son to his elder sister Arshveer \"Jeeto\" Kaur (Ratna Pathak) based in London and the other to his brother Baldev Singh Bajwa (Pavan Malhotra) who is settled in Punjab whilst he himself enjoys his single, lonely life in London. Years pass and both twins grow up. Karan Singh Bajwa (Arjun Kapoor) lives with his aunt Jeeto in London and Charan Singh Bajwa (Arjun Kapoor) lives with his uncle in Punjab. Karan has a girlfriend, Supreet \"Sweety\" Gill (Ileana D'Cruz) from the past 2 years. Karan's dad wants him to marry a girl named Binkle (Athiya Shetty) who has a rich dad. Her dad helped Karan's dad start his business. Because he wants to marry Sweety, Karan manages to convince Charan's dad to make Charan marry Binkle. Meanwhile, in Punjab, Charan also has a girlfriend, Nafisa Qureshi (Neha Sharma) who is a Muslim and studying law. But his dad is biased against Muslims. So Charan hasn't told his dad about her. Baldev takes Charan to London where Kartar welcomes them. In London, Charan tells his uncle Kartar that he doesn't want to marry Binkle and he is in love with Nafisa. His uncle suggests that he pretend to be a drug addict in front of the Sandhu family so that they will turn down the marriage proposal themselves. The next day, Charan does as planned but when he sees Binkle, he falls in love at first sight. Binkle takes Charan on a tour of the house while Kartar hints at the silly habits of Charan's drug addiction to Manpreet (Karan Kundra), Binkle's brother. Charan tries to alert Kartar to his sudden change of heart, but, in a comic twist, falls out of the window trying to get cellphone service. Due to this incident, Manpreet turns suspicious and assumes Charan to be a drug addict. This upsets Baldev and gets mad at the Sandhu family. Jeeto and Gurcharan (Lalit Parimoo), Jeeto's husband, instead of defending Baldev, persuade him to apologize Mr. Sandhu for his misbehavior but Baldev refuses to do so. They return home and blame Baldev for their disrespect in front of the wealthy Sandhu family and humiliate him. This angers Baldev and he decides to return to Punjab. He challenges Jeeto that he will marry Charan exactly on 25 December with a girl much better than Binkle. They have a huge argument and sever ties with each other. They end their relationship. Meanwhile, Charan asks Karan to bring Nafisa to the airport so that he could talk about his feelings for her with his adoptive father. When they land in Punjab, Karan does what Charan asked and confronts them with Nafisa, but Charan is terrified and doesn't dare to speak up. Baldev misunderstands that Nafisa is Karan's girlfriend. This creates a complicated situation for Karan. Baldev overhears Sweety's father pleading for her daughter's marriage soon in a Gurudwara. So, Baldev takes Charan's purposal for Sweety who misunderstands her bond getting tied with Karan but later realizes it's tied with Charan. She gets upset at Karan. While back at London, Jeeto takes a proposal for Karan to Binkle without Karan knowing. They fix their marriage on 25 December too. Kartar is split on whether to go to Jeeto or Baldev's marriage events since they are at the same date. To solve his problem, he suggests that Baldev have a destination marriage in London. Baldev agrees and everyone flies to London. Everyone goes to a mall for shopping. Charan takes advantage of this and reveals Karan and Sweety's relationship. On hearing this Binkle is heartbroken. Charan feels sorry for her and falls for her more because of her innocence towards him. Charan refuses to fight for his rights. Karan then invites Nafisa to London for Charan's engagement to Sweety increasing Charan's problems. Karan, Charan, Sweety and Nafisa decide to elope. But their plan fails when in the next morning Manpreet falls for Nafisa and Sandhu insists her to live at his residence. Nafisa and Manpreet fall for each other. Nafisa starts ignoring Charan. Charan wants to reveal his feelings for Binkle but at the moment, Nafisa appears and confess her love for Manpreet and leaves. Charan and Karan's marriages are planned at the same Gurudwara on the same date. Before Binkle's engagement, Charan confess all the mishaps and misunderstandings happened and explains that he is not a drug addict too. He also reveals his feelings to her at last. Kartar dreams of his brother, the twins' father realizing him that he left his children to him and he is ruining their life. After Binkle's engagement, Karan, Sweety, Charan, Binkle, Manpreet, Nafisa and Kartar gather at a place where Kartar declines to help them and said they would have to marry the ones chosen by their parents instead of eloping unless they did something. So, 25 December arrives when Karan and Charan exchange their sherwanis, disguising each other. At the gurudwara, Sweety reveals her love for Karan in front of everyone. This shocks everyone including Charan and Karan because of their exchanged identities. Kartar then explains to Jeeto and Baldev they are being silly and should stop arguing. They patch up. Not to cause more trouble and confusion the twins take Kartar in for a confidential meeting revealing their exchanged identities where Kartar orders them to wear their original identities and never ever discuss this mishap with their wives. So, their families no more oppose their choices and Karan weds Sweety while Charan weds Binkle. ==Cast== * Anil Kapoor as Kartar Singh Bajwa, Avtar, Jeeto and Baldev's brother, Karan and Charan's uncle * Arjun Kapoor as Karanveer Singh Bajwa (Karan)/Charanveer Singh Bajwa (Charan) (Double Role) * Ileana D'Cruz as Supreet Gill/Supreet Karanveer Singh Bajwa (Sweety), Karan's wife, Charan's ex-fiance\u00e9 * Athiya Shetty as Binkle Sandhu/Binkle Charanveer Singh Bajwa, Charan's wife, Karan's ex-fiance\u00e9 * Neha Sharma as Advocate Nafisa Qureshi/Nafisa Manpreet Sandhu, Charan's ex- girlfriend (they break up later in the film as Nafisa falls for Manpreet and Charan falls for Binkle) and Manpreet's wife * Rahul Dev as Akalpreet Sandhu, Manpreet and Binkle's father * Karan Kundra as Manpreet Sandhu, Binkle's brother and Nafisa's husband * Gurpal Singh as Sweety's father * Ratna Pathak as Arshveer Kaur Bajwa (Jeeto), Baldev, Kartar and Avtar's sister, Karan and Charan's aunt and Karan's adoptive mother * Pavan Malhotra as Baldev Singh Bajwa, Jeeto, Kartar and Avtar's brother, Karan and Charan's uncle and Charan's adoptive father * Sanjay Kapoor as Avtar Singh Bajwa, Jeeto, Baldev and Kartar's brother and Karan and Charan's biological father * Alexander Dolbenko as Jolly ==Production== The Guru Nanak Darbar Gurdwara in Gravesend, Kent features as the temple the families worship. == Soundtrack == The music of the film has been composed by Amaal Mallik, Gourov Roshin, Rishi Rich and while the lyrics have been penned by Kumaar.

Meena Lyer of Times of India rated the film 3/5 and concluded: \"Anil is the scene-stealer with his half Brit-half Punjabi act lifting the film throughout. Arjun\u2019s double-act allows for some smiles and the girls, Ileana, Athiya and Neha are easy on the eye, though they\u2019re just decorative set-pieces.\" Manju Ramanan of Masala! gave the film 3.5/5 saying, \"Loud characters, bright sets, songs and dances and slapstick humour dominate this Anees Bazmee film. But the instances do make you smile. Ahana Bhattacharya of Koimoi gave the film 3/5 saying, \"The story is funny and the film has some really hilarious dialogues. However, Sardar jokes are a bit clich\u00e9d and Bollywood needs to get over it. I loved the way the film builds up the confusion but it tends to drag towards the climax. There are moments when you will feel it is patriarchal, racist and regressive. Also, the climax is a bit predictable. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2017 films Category:Indian films Category:Hindi-language films Category:2010s Hindi- language films Category:Films shot in Mumbai Category:Films shot in Punjab, India Category:Films shot in London Category:Films shot in England Category:Twins in Indian films Category:Films directed by Anees Bazmee Category:Films scored by Amar Mohile Category:Sony Pictures Networks films ",
