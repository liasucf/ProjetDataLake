    "text": "Crest factor is a parameter of a waveform, such as alternating current or sound, showing the ratio of peak values to the effective value. In other words, crest factor indicates how extreme the peaks are in a waveform. Crest factor 1 indicates no peaks, such as direct current or a square wave. Higher crest factors indicate peaks, for example sound waves tend to have high crest factors. Crest factor is the peak amplitude of the waveform divided by the RMS value of the waveform. This is equivalent to the ratio of the L\u221e norm to the L2 norm of the function of the waveform: : C = \\frac{|x_\\mathrm{peak}|}{x_\\mathrm{rms}} = \\frac{\\|x\\|_\\infty}{\\|x\\|_2} : {C}_\\mathrm{dB} = 20 \\log_{10} \\left({{|x_\\mathrm{peak}| \\over x_\\mathrm{rms}}}\\right). The peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) is the peak amplitude squared (giving the peak power) divided by the RMS value squared (giving the average power). It is the square of the crest factor: : \\mathit{PAPR} = \\frac{{|x_\\mathrm{peak}|}^2}{{x_\\mathrm{rms}}^2} = C^2 : \\mathit{PAPR}_\\mathrm{dB} = 10 \\log_{10}\\frac{{|x_\\mathrm{peak}|}^2}{{x_\\mathrm{rms}}^2} = C_\\mathrm{dB}. When expressed in decibels, crest factor and PAPR are equivalent, due to the way decibels are calculated for power ratios vs amplitude ratios. Crest factor and PAPR are therefore dimensionless quantities. While the crest factor is defined as a positive real number, in commercial products it is also commonly stated as the ratio of two whole numbers, e.g., 2:1. The PAPR is most used in signal processing applications. As it is a power ratio, it is normally expressed in decibels (dB). The crest factor of the test signal is a fairly important issue in loudspeaker testing standards; in this context it is usually expressed in dB.

For example, given a certain digital multimeter with an AC accuracy of 0.03% (always specified for sine waves) with an additional error of 0.2% for crest factors between 1.414 and 5, then the total error for measuring a triangular wave (crest factor = 1.73) is 0.03% + 0.2% = 0.23%. == Acoustics and audio engineering == In acoustics and audio engineering, crest factor is usually expressed in decibels, so it's defined as the level difference between the RMS and the peak value of the waveform. For example, for a sine wave the 1.414 ratio is 20 log(1.414) or 3 dB. Most ambient noise has a crest factor of around 10 dB while impulsive sounds such as gunshots can have crest factors of over 30 dB. ==Peak-to-average ratio (PAR) meter== A peak-to-average ratio meter (Par meter) is a device used to measure the ratio of the peak power level to the time-averaged power level in an electrical circuit. This quantity is known as the peak-to-average ratio (p/a r or PAR). Such meters are used as a quick means to identify degraded telephone channels. Par meters are very sensitive to envelope delay distortion. They may also be used for idle channel noise, nonlinear distortion, and amplitude-distortion measurements. The peak-to-average ratio can be determined for many signal parameters, such as voltage, current, power, frequency, and phase. == Crest factor reduction == Many modulation techniques have been specifically designed to have constant envelope modulation, i.e., the minimum possible crest factor of 1:1. In general, modulation techniques that have smaller crest factors usually transmit more bits per second than modulation techniques that have higher crest factors. This is because: # any given linear amplifier has some \"peak output power\"\u2014some maximum possible instantaneous peak amplitude it can support and still stay in the linear range; # the average power of the signal is the peak output power divided by the crest factor; # the number of bits per second transmitted (on average) is proportional to the average power transmitted (Shannon\u2013Hartley theorem). Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is a very promising modulation technique; perhaps its biggest problem is its high crest factor.\"Crest Factor Reduction of an OFDM/WiMAX Network\". \"Low Crest Factor Modulation Techniques for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)\" . Many crest factor reduction techniques (CFR) have been proposed for OFDM.R. Neil Braithwaite. \"Crest Factor Reduction for OFDM Using Selective Subcarrier Degradation\". K. T. Wong, B. Wang & J.-C.

The reduction in crest factor results in a system that can either transmit more bits per second with the same hardware, or transmit the same bits per second with lower-power hardware (and therefore lower electricity costsNick Wells. \"DVB-T2 in relation to the DVB-x2 Family of Standards\" quote: \"techniques which can reduce the PAPR, ... could result in a significant saving in electricity costs.\" and less expensive hardware), or both. ===Crest factor reduction methods=== Various methods for crest factor reduction exist, such as peak windowing, noise shaping, pulse injection and peak cancellation. == Applications == * Electrical engineering \u2014 for describing the quality of an AC power waveform * Vibration analysis \u2014 for estimating the amount of impact wear in a bearingWhat Is The \u201cCrest Factor\u201d And Why Is It Used? * Radio and audio electronics \u2014 for estimating the headroom required in a signal chainCrest factor analysis for complex signal processing PAPR simulation for 64QAM ** Music has a widely varying crest factor.
