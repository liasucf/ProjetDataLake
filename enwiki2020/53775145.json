The album spawned two singles in January, \"My Old Man\" and \"This Old Dog\", which are the two first tracks on the album. The singles \"On The Level\" and \"One More Love Song\" were released in April 2017. The album leaked on April 13, 2017. ==Recording== DeMarco recorded This Old Dog while moving to Los Angeles. He describes the experiences and time it took to develop and make the album: ==Reception== This Old Dog garnered the Best New Track title from Pitchfork with writer Marc Hogan calling it a \"shaggy ode to romantic constancy, come what may\". In his review for the album, Mark Richardson of Pitchfork writes, \"DeMarco seems to kick back and let everything fall into place, but his music demonstrates a relentless devotion to craft, with all the fundamentals intact.\" ===Accolades=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
