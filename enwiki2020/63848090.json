    "text": "In Person is a live performance album by jazz pianist Vince Guaraldi, released in the U.S. on June 10, 1963 on Fantasy Records. It was released as a follow- up to his album Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus which featured the surprise hit song \"Cast Your Fate to the Wind\". The concert was recorded live at The Trident Jazz Club in Sausalito, California, on December 4, 1962. ==Reception== AllMusic critic Richard S. Ginell called In Person \"a defining album for Guaraldi in his natural habitat\" (a jazz club setting), adding that the album captures the musician \"at his most winning.\" Why It Matters blogger James Stafford cited In Person as capturing \"the pianist in that brief moment when he was enjoying his first great national success with 'Cast Your Fate To the Wind' but hadn\u2019t yet been transformed into a household name by Peanuts. It\u2019s a beautiful record, filled with blues, bebop, and bossa nova, but for sheer plaster-a-smile-on-your-face delight nothing beats his take on the Mediterranean traditional song 'Misirlou'.\" ==Track listing== == Personnel == ;The Vince Guaraldi Quintet * Vince Guaraldi \u2013 piano * Eddie Duran \u2013 guitars * Fred Marshall \u2013 bass * Colin Bailey \u2013 drums * Benny Valarde \u2013 g\u00fciro ;Additional: * Ralph J.
