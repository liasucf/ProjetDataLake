    "text": "S\u00e9bastien de La Ruelle (died 16 April 1637) was a mayor of the city of Li\u00e8ge who was assassinated for his opposition to the policies of the prince-bishop of Li\u00e8ge, Ferdinand of Bavaria.Henri Lonchay, \"La Ruelle (S\u00e9bastien de)\", Biographie Nationale de Belgique, vol. 11 (Brussels, 1891), 359\u2013382. ==Office== La Ruelle was a leader of the \"Grignoux\" party in Li\u00e8ge, which sought a French alliance to counterbalance the prince-bishop's alliance with the Habsburgs, and opposed the growth of absolutism in city government. He was elected as one of the mayors of Li\u00e8ge in 1630, but the prince-bishop declared the election fraudulent and refused to confirm him in the office. La Ruelle was re-elected on 14 July 1635, after the outbreak of open war between France and the Habsburgs. He left office on 24 July 1636, but was still identified as the head of the party that supported the presence of French troops in the prince-bishopric as a counterweight to Habsburg influence. He survived an attempt on his life on 3 November 1636, when a rider fired a shot in his direction that hit and injured his wife, Ida de Cerf. ==Assassination== In April 1637 he accepted an invitation to dine at the house of Ren\u00e9 de Renesse, 1st Count of Warfus\u00e9e, who had been living in exile in Li\u00e8ge since the failure of the Conspiracy of Nobles (1632). Louis XIII's envoy in Li\u00e8ge, Ren\u00e9-Louis de Ficquelmont, abb\u00e9 de Mouzon, was also invited. At the banquet, after drinking the health of the King of France, La Ruelle was murdered by a party of Spanish soldiers that Warfus\u00e9e had smuggled into Li\u00e8ge for the purpose. When the murder became known, popular reaction was extreme. Warfus\u00e9e was hanged out of hand by the mob, and they went on the rampage against prominent members of the \"Spanish party\", few of whom were implicated in the murder. La Ruelle was buried in the church of St. Martin-en-Ile in Li\u00e8ge, with his funeral mass taking place in St. Lambert's Cathedral, Li\u00e8ge, on 2 May 1637. ==References== ==External links== * A contemporary account of La Ruelle's murder, Histoire Tragicque, ou Relation veritable de tout ce qui se passa au Tragique Banquet Warfuzeen, tant de l'assasinat commis en la personne du feu le Seigneur Bourgemaistre de La Ruelle de glorieuse memoire, printed at Li\u00e8ge in 1637 by Christian Ouwerx, is available on Google Books. * A collection of contemporary documents was edited by Ulysse Capitaine and published as Collection de documents contemporains relatifs au meurtre de S\u00e9bastien de La Ruelle (Li\u00e8ge, 1868).
