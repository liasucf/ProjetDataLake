Karyam Nissaram is longest running serial on Kairali TV. ==Plot== The show tells the story of husband and wife, Mohanakrishnan (Aneesh Ravi) and Sathyabhama (Anu Joseph). Mohanakrishnan is an honest, punctual and disciplined Village Officer and Sathyabhama is a smart, bold and independent Lawyer by profession. Each day a different theme is taken up and solved. Both the husband and wife have a strong opinion on any social or familial issue. The difference of opinion between them and how they take it all in the ride forms the major theme of the serial. The serial, in a very humorous tone, takes up socially relevant issues and presents the two extreme view points. The husband, a very strong believer of the values of Gandhi and the wife, a very modern woman, their opinions on issues are never the same. The serial, in fact, shows how differences of opinion need not be a negative element in the married life and how one can find humour in all these situations. ==Cast== * Aneesh Ravi as K.
