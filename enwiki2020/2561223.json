It is home to the Western Australian Institute of Sport (WAIS). The venue is located in the suburb of Mount Claremont, approximately 8 km west of Perth's central business district. The complex was opened in 1986. It received its current name through a naming-rights sponsorship deal with the HBF Health Fund in 2014. Although the previous sponsorship with Challenge Bank expired in 2002, the Challenge Stadium name remained in use until 2014. Facilities include an Olympic- standard aquatic centre with five pools, a diving tower, gymnasium, two arenas, and several basketball courts, as well as a caf\u00e9, childcare centre, sports store, office accommodation and a museum. The main indoor arena has seating for 4,500 spectators, or for over 5,000 people including standing room. Regular exhibitions and expos are hosted at the venue, as well as national and international sporting events. ==History== Interior of the arena during the 2014 Sino-Australia Challenge Between 1987\u201389 and 2002\u201312, the Perth Superdrome was the home venue of the Perth Wildcats, who play in the National Basketball League (NBL). The Wildcats played in four NBL Grand Final series at the stadium, in 1987, 2002/03, 2009/10 and 2011/12, with the only championship coming in 2009/10. During Wildcats' games, the venue was referred to as \"The Jungle\". The Wildcats' final game at the stadium was their 87\u201386 win over the New Zealand Breakers in Game 2 of the 2011/12 NBL Grand Final series in front of 4,400 fans. The aquatic centre hosted the FINA World Aquatics Championships in 1991 and 1998. The Australian Swimming Championships were held there in 1993, as well as the national short-course championships in 2001 and 2012. Beginning in 2008, the stadium served as the main home court for the West Coast Fever, who play in the National Netball League. To the Fever, the stadium is known as \"The Cauldron\". The Fever moved all their home matches to Perth Arena at the end of the 2018 season. In 2013, a WAIS High Performance Service Centre commenced construction. It now comprises a strength and conditioning gym, multi-purpose training and testing area, 80-metre four lane indoor runway for long jump, sprinting and throwing sports, hydrotherapy and recovery pools, physiology and environmental laboratories, consultation rooms, athlete amenities and office space. ==As a music venue== HBF Stadium has been the venue of major music concerts, including: ===2000s decade=== \\---- 2003 * Craig David \u2013 4 November 2003 * Cold Chisel \u2013 11 December 2003 2004 * P!nk \u2013 30 April 2004 2005 * Avril Lavigne \u2013 6 April 2005 * Simple Plan \u2013 11 October 2005 * Kelly Clarkson \u2013 4 November 2005 2006 * Status Quo & Deep Purple \u2013 3 May 2006 * Wolfmother \u2013 16 July 2006 * The Strokes \u2013 9 August 2006 * INXS \u2013 12 September 2006 * Westlife \u2013 17 September 2006 * Rogue Traders \u2013 5 October 2006 * Live \u2013 24 October 2006 * 2007 * Evanescence \u2013 15 February 2007 * Westlife \u2013 21 February 2007 * P!nk \u2013 18\u201320 April & 2\u20134 June 2007 * Human Nature \u2013 22\u201323 June 2007 * Heaven & Hell & Down \u2013 2 August 2007 * The Cure \u2013 4 August 2007 * Fall Out Boy \u2013 29 September 2007 * Marilyn Manson \u2013 13 October 2007 * Mot\u00f6rhead \u2013 16 October 2007 * Good Charlotte \u2013 17 October 2007 2008 * Kelly Clarkson \u2013 1 March 2008 * The Black Crowes \u2013 26 March 2008 * James Blunt \u2013 9 May 2008 * Michael Bubl\u00e9 \u2013 11\u201312 & 14\u201315 June 2008 * Paul Weller \u2013 13 August 2008 * Panic! at the Disco \u2013 27 August 2008 * Disturbed \u2013 29 August 2008 * Judas Priest \u2013 16 September 2008 2009 * Fall Out Boy \u2013 15 February 2009 * The Veronicas \u2013 28 February & 1 March 2009 * The Living End \u2013 22 May 2009 * Alice Cooper \u2013 1 September 2009 * Chris Isaak \u2013 16 & 17 September 2009 * Suzi Quatro \u2013 22 September 2009 * Marilyn Manson \u2013 5 October 2009 * Slayer & Megadeth \u2013 13 October 2009 * Short Stack \u2013 13 December 2009 ===2010s decade=== \\---- 2010 * Them Crooked Vultures \u2013 19 January 2010 * Backstreet Boys \u2013 2 March 2010 * Status Quo \u2013 17 March 2010 * Short Stack \u2013 26 March 2010 * Kelly Clarkson \u2013 22 April 2010 * Deep Purple \u2013 5 May 2010 * Yusuf \u2013 10 June 2010 * Thirty Seconds to Mars \u2013 24 July 2010 * Mika Singh \u2013 7 August 2010 * Florence and the Machine \u2013 10 August 2010 * Bullet for My Valentine \u2013 5 September 2010 * Parkway Drive \u2013 3 October 2010 * Paramore \u2013 10 October 2010 * Village People \u2013 20 October 2010 * Creedence Clearwater Revisited \u2013 13 October 2010 * Jason Der\u00fclo \u2013 2 November 2010 * Pendulum \u2013 6 November 2010 2011 * Kesha \u2013 7 March 2011 * Stone Temple Pilots \u2013 16 March 2011 * The Script \u2013 2 April 2011 * Good Charlotte \u2013 15 April 2011 * Cirque Du Soleil \u2013 21 April to 8 May 2011 * Eason Chan \u2013 20 May 2011 * Bliss N Eso \u2013 21 May 2011 * Parkway Drive \u2013 27 May 2011 * Rise Against \u2013 23 July 2011 * Winterbeatz \u2013 17 August 2011 * Alice Cooper \u2013 2 October 2011 * The Wombats \u2013 11 October 2011 * Steely Dan & Steve Winwood \u2013 18 October 2011 2012 * Tim Minchin \u2013 10 & 12 February 2012 * Roxette \u2013 28 & 29 February 2012 * Flight of the Conchords \u2013 18, 19 & 20 July 2012 * The Smashing Pumpkins \u2013 26 July 2012 * Hilltop Hoods \u2013 17 August 2012 * Kelly Clarkson \u2013 5 October 2012 * Roch Voisine \u2013 24 November 2012 * Parkway Drive \u2013 19 December 2012 2013 * X Factor Live \u2013 16 January 2013 * Ringo Starr & His All-Starr Band \u2013 21 February 2013 * Ed Sheeran \u2013 23 February 2013 * Flume \u2013 13 May 2013 * Alt-J \u2013 27 July 2013 * Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 12 October 2013 * Eros Ramazzotti \u2013 23 November 2013 * Simple Plan \u2013 3 December 2013 2014 * Thirty Seconds to Mars \u2013 25 March 2014 * Ellie Goulding \u2013 28 May 2014 * Bastille \u2013 18 June 2014 * Lorde \u2013 5 July 2014 * Anna Vissi \u2013 3 October 2014 2016 * The 1975 \u2013 23 January 2016 *Troye Sivan \u2013 13 August 2016 *Bring Me the Horizon \u2013 14 September 2016 2017 * Charles Aznavour \u2013 1 October 2017 *J.Cole \u2013 9 December 2017 2018 *Live \u2013 6 January 2018 *Halsey \u2013 24 April 2018 *5 Seconds of Summer \u2013 18 August 2018 ==References== ==External links== * * * * Heritage Council WA Category:Netball venues in Western Australia Category:Sports venues in Perth, Western Australia Category:Sports venues completed in 1986 Category:Perth Wildcats Category:Perth Lynx Category:West Coast Fever Category:Defunct National Basketball League (Australia) venues Category:Swimming venues in Australia Category:Music venues in Perth, Western Australia Category:Indoor arenas in Australia Category:Boxing venues in Australia Category:Darts venues Category:Mount Claremont, Western Australia ",
