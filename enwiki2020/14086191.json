    "text": "Grevillea baueri, commonly known as Bauer's grevillea, is a low-growing shrub which is endemic to the coastal ranges of south-eastern New South Wales in Australia. It usually grows up to 1 metre in height and 2 metres in width. Flowers are produced in late winter and spring. These have a red perianth with a cream tip and a green-tipped red style. The species was first formally described by botanist Robert Brown, his description published in Transactions of the Linnean Society of London in 1810. The specific epithet honours brothers Franz and Ferdinand Bauer who were both noted botanical illustrators from Austria. Two subspecies are currently recognised: * Grevillea baueri subsp. asperula * Grevillea baueri subsp. baueri ==Cultivation== This species has attractive foliage and flowers although the latter blacken after maturity, which can detract from the overall appearance. It is frost hardy in Australia and preferes a position with reasonable drainage and in full sun or partial shade. Plants are propagated by cuttings. ==References== Category:Flora of New South Wales baueri Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Garden plants of Australia ",
