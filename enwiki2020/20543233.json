    "text": "The Duke\u2013Maryland basketball rivalry is a dormant college basketball rivalry between the Duke Blue Devils men's basketball team of Duke University and Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team of the University of Maryland. The basketball series has been called one of the most intense intercollegiate rivalries of modern times by some. A Harris Interactive poll of Marylanders ranked it the third best in the state behind the Redskins\u2013Cowboys and Ravens\u2013Redskins rivalries in 2003 (before the Beltway Series of the Orioles and Nationals was possible).Sports Illustrated 50th Anniversary: Maryland, Sports Illustrated, 2003. In 2014, Maryland left the ACC for the Big Ten and regular season games between Maryland and Duke are no longer scheduled regularly. ==History== Duke University and the University of North Carolina consider each other to be their only rivals. However, during the early 2000s the Duke\u2013Maryland games had national implications, including in 2001 where Duke and Maryland met in the Final Four. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Team !!

While the Duke\u2013UNC rivalry originated from geographic proximity and shared history, Duke fans do not view Maryland as a rival.Anya Sostek, Duke-Maryland `rivalry' means much more to Terps fans, The Chronicle, January 11, 2000. However, several former Duke players have cited Maryland as the team against whom they played their most exciting games. Maryland fans traditionally see the Duke game as the biggest game of the year, as is true with most of Duke's opponents. Maryland fans have often rioted in College Park after home games, regardless of the outcome. Famously, one fan threw a bottle and hit Carlos Boozer's mother in her head after Duke's remarkable comeback from a 10-point deficit in the final minute to beat Maryland, requiring the University of Maryland to issue a public apology. One year, most fans in the student section right behind the basket had to leave or turn their t-shirts inside-out because they had a FCC-banned explicative (\"F**K DUKE\") that could not be shown on television.

In 2014, the Washington Post produced a short documentary on the peak of the rivalry from 2001 and 2002 which included interviews with Coach Williams and several former players from both teams.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKEy-QuaToo ===End of the rivalry=== With the University of Maryland leaving the Atlantic Coast Conference to join the Big Ten Conference at the start of the 2014\u201315 academic year,Crystal Brown, \"University of Maryland To Join the Big 10 Conference\", University Communications Newsdesk, University of Maryland, 19 November 2012 the schools' basketball rivalry may come to an end. While Maryland competed in the ACC for the 2013\u201314 basketball season, the conference's expansion to a fifteen-team league means that schools do not play every league opponent twice during a given season. Duke and Maryland played one time during the 2013\u201314 season on February 15, 2014, at Duke's Cameron Indoor Stadium.Matt Bonesteel, \"New ACC schedule format means end of Maryland\u2019s annual basketball home-and- home with Duke\", The Washington Post, 03 February 2012 To some, including Duke basketball head coach Mike Krzyzewski, the emotion and spectacle that the Duke\u2013Maryland rivalry brings to the ACC are \"not going to be there for our conference and for Duke and Maryland anymore.\"Don Markus, \"End of the Maryland-Duke rivalry is fast approaching\", The Baltimore Sun, 13 February 2013 ==Game results== ==References== Category:College basketball rivalries in the United States Category:Duke Blue Devils men's basketball Category:Maryland Terrapins men's basketball Category:Maryland Terrapins rivalries ",
