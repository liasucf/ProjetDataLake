    "text": "{| |} The Icaro Twin Electric is an Italian electric ultralight trike that was designed by World Hang Glider Champion pilot Manfred Ruhmer and under development by Icaro 2000 of Sangiano.Tacke, Willi; Marino Boric; et al: World Directory of Light Aviation 2015-16, page 233. Flying Pages Europe SARL, 2015. As of 2018 the aircraft was not advertised on the manufacturer's website and it is likely that it did not progress beyond one flying prototype. ==Design and development== The Twin Electric design features a cable-braced hang glider-style high-wing, weight-shift controls, a two-seats-in-tandem open cockpit without a cockpit fairing, tricycle landing gear and twin electric motors mounted on lateral booms, in pusher configuration. The aircraft is made from bolted-together aluminum tubing, with its single surface Rx Bip bi-place wing covered in Dacron sailcloth. Its wing is supported by a single tube-type kingpost and uses an \"A\" frame weight-shift control bar. Power is supplied by two electric motors mounted on booms, one each side of the trike frame, each driving a pusher propeller. The Rx Bip wing was selected to allow STOL capabilities. ==Operational history== The Twin Electric was reported as being flight tested in 2015. ==Specifications (Twin Electric) == ==References== Twin Electric Category:2010s Italian sport aircraft Category:2010s Italian ultralight aircraft Category:Twin-motored electric aircraft Category:Ultralight trikes ",
