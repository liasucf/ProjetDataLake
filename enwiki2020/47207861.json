She precipitately leaves her husband Patrick to follow the wanderings of Paul, a lost man who lives of small thefts. A roadtrip of two days begins through Camargue. Like sand in her hand, Fabienne feels her life slipping away. While that escape confronts them to their mutual anguishes, Patrick and his children go looking for her. This quest obliges them to explore their own story, their resentments and their unsaids. Vulnerable and infinitely touching, Fabienne reveals herself and confesses little by little her distress to Paul. Several intimate flashbacks define her increasing illness, forcing her to go back to a traumatic episode when she was thirteen. == Cast == * Cl\u00e9mentine C\u00e9lari\u00e9 as Fabienne * Daniel Russo as Paul * Patrick Catalifo as Patrick * Genevi\u00e8ve Fontanel as Fabienne's mother * Juliet Lemonnier as Harmonie * Hugo Brunswick as Bruno == External links == * Category:2011 television films Category:French television films Category:French-language films Category:Drama television films Category:French films ",
