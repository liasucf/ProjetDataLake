    "text": "The 1986\u201387 USAC Gold Crown Championship season consisted of one race, the 71st Indianapolis 500 on May 24, 1987. The USAC National Champion and Indianapolis 500 winner was Al Unser. The schedule was based on a split- calendar, beginning in June 1986 and running through May 1987. Since USAC had dropped out of sanctioning Indy car races outside the Indy 500, the Gold Crown Championship consisted of only one event. The preeminent national championship season was instead sanctioned by CART. ==Schedule and results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:85%\" ! Rnd ! Date ! Race Name ! Length ! Track !
