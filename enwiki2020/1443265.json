Its name is from the Guarani word for \"mixture.\"Britton, A. Scott (2004). Guarani- English/English-Guarani Concise Dictionary. New York: Hippocrene Books. The majority of Paraguayans, particularly younger ones, speak some form of Jopara. Since 2016, the language-learning app Duolingo has offered a course in Jopara for Spanish speakers. ==Social context== Speakers of both Guarani and Spanish typically employ a great deal of code-switching between the two languages, hence why the blending of the two languages is called \"Jopara,\" meaning \"mixture.\" The relative amount of Guarani or Spanish used in speech varies depending upon the birth of the speakers, the place where they speak, with whom they are speaking, the topic of discussion, and how they want their meaning to be interpreted. Generally, the rural and older population tends to use more Guarani, while the urban and younger population uses more Spanish\u2014the rural and older population understands more Guarani and the urban and younger more Spanish. General and every-day conversation is more suited to Guarani, while technical and specific or formal conversation is more suited to Spanish. Guarani can be interpreted as more \"Paraguayan\" while Spanish can be interpreted as more \"sophisticated.\" Since 1992, under the Paraguay's Ministry of Education and Culture (MEC) Act, Guarani in its \"pure form\"\u2014different from the day-to-day speech of Jopara\u2014has been taught in schools. This led to contradictory opinions: some say that teaching pure Guarani is the best means to preserve the language's integrity, while others argue that how Guarani is taught differs greatly from how it is commonly spoken. ==Lexicon== Many grammatical markers for features found in Guarani but not in Spanish, like evidentiality markers, are borrowed from Guarani. For example (Guarani words in bold): * La ni\u00f1a ndaje no com\u00eda m\u00e1s casi dos d\u00edas voi y por eso estaba un poco desnutrida, pero el tua \u00e1nga igual le pegaba * It is said that the girl would not eat for more than two days. Well, for that reason she was somewhat malnourished, but the stepfather would still hit her. Some Spanish words, when put in a sentence mixed with Guarani, have a different meaning from that of standard Spanish. They can come from calques of equivalent Guarani expressions. For example: * Tu hijo creci\u00f3 todo ya. * Your son grew all already. ==See also== *Diglossia *WikiProject Guaran\u00ed ==References== Category:Languages of Paraguay Category:Language contact Category:Mixed languages Category:South America Native-based pidgins and creoles Category:Spanish-based pidgins and creoles ",
