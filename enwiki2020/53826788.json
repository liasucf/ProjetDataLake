She officially goes by the one name of Ledania which derives from the union of Leda, the famous female seduced by Zeus in Greek mythology, and her first name. == Life == Ledania's early years were influenced by her father's artistic practice and her mother's artisan background. Since a child, she had a strong interest in humanist and artistic subjects which she was able to explore at school. By the year 2004 she had the chance to participate in various interscholastic exhibitions and by the time she got her high school degree it was clear to her that she would study the Arts. In the year 2010 she graduated with a Master's in plastic and visual arts with an emphasis in graphic expression from the Pontificia Universidad Javeriana in Bogot\u00e1.
