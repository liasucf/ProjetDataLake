In 944, he was sent by Nasir al-Dawla to seize Syria, allocated to the Hamdanids by the amir al-umara Tuzun, from the forces of Muhammad ibn Tughj al-Ikhshid. Husayn was initially successful in occupying the north of the country, but was soon driven out of Syria by Ikhshidid forces, led by al-Ikhshid himself. Husayn married Sarirah, a former slave of Ibn Ra'iq. == References == == Sources == * Category:10th-century Arabs Category:Hamdanid dynasty ",
