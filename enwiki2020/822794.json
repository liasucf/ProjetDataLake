The station is located in the south of Fulham, adjacent to Fulham High Street and New Kings Road (A308) and is a short distance from the north end of Putney Bridge from which it takes its name. ==History== The station was opened on 1 March 1880 as Putney Bridge & Fulham when the District Railway (DR, now the District line) extended its line south from . The station served as the terminus of the line until 1889 when the DR built Fulham Railway Bridge across the River Thames and extended the line south to the London and South Western Railway's (L&SWR;'s) newly built East Putney station where it connected to the L&SWR;'s new line to Wimbledon. Services from the station to Wimbledon began on 3 June 1889. The station has an ornate yellow brick fa\u00e7ade at the entrance. On 1 September 1902,Forgotten Stations of Greater London by J.E.Connor and B.Halford the station was renamed Putney Bridge & Hurlingham referring to its proximity to Hurlingham Park and the Hurlingham Club. It received its current name in 1932. Despite taking its name from Putney Bridge, the tube station is in fact on the Fulham side of the Thames and is not actually located in Putney. ==Nearby places of interest== A World War Two pillbox can clearly be seen at the Southern end of the Southbound platform, overlooking Fulham Railway Bridge. In addition to the Hurlingham club and Hurlingham Park, Fulham Palace, the former home of the Bishops of London is nearby. It now contains a small museum set in Bishop's Park. Fulham Football Club's Craven Cottage stadium is about 1 kilometre to the north-west, and the tube station is often very busy on matchdays. ==Recent developments== Putney Bridge had a bay platform (platform 2) which could only accommodate C stock trains and was located between the current eastbound and westbound tracks. After the C stock was removed from service in June 2014, the bay platform ceased to be used, and the track was lifted as of October 2015. This platform was brought back into use in May 2016. The previous terminating end is now joined to the westbound track and platform 3 is no longer in use and is fenced off. This eliminated the previous 10 mph speed restriction on the westbound side. ==Connections== London Buses routes 14, 22, 39, 74, 85, 93, 220, 265, 270, 414, 424 and 430 and night routes N22 and N74 serve the station. ==Gallery== File:PutneyBridge2.jpg |Putney Bridge underground station platforms (September 2006) File:Putney_Bridge_Underground_Station_-_geograph.org.uk_-_685230.jpg|The outside of Putney Bridge Station File:PBridgePillbox.JPG |Southern end of the platforms at Putney Bridge station, showing the reversing siding, the World War 2 pillbox defending the bridge, and the northern tip of the bridge ==References== ==External links== * London Transport Museum Photographic Archive ** Category:District line stations Category:Proposed Chelsea-Hackney Line stations Category:Tube stations in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham Category:Former Metropolitan District Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1880 Category:1880 establishments in England ",
