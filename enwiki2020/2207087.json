    "text": "Domino is a 1998 album by the British new wave group Squeeze. It was the band's twelfth studio album. After a career struggling with various major record labels, the band decided to record and release Domino independently, on Glenn Tilbrook's own Quixotic Records. Core members Tilbrook and Chris Difford were joined by three brand new Squeeze members for this album: drummer Ashley Soan, bassist Hilaire Penda, and keyboardist Christopher Holland (Jools's younger brother). The album was hastily made, and received negative reactions from critics. Difford and Tilbrook have both since denounced Domino as a weak effort, marred by time constraints and increasing friction between the two songwriters. Difford chose not to join a 1999 tour due to concerns related to his history of alcoholism,, after which Squeeze disbanded. The album did not appear in the UK Albums Chart; their first to fail to do so. ==Track listing== All songs written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook. # \"Play On\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Bonkers\" \u2013 3:43 # \"What's Wrong With This Picture?\" \u2013 3:24 # \"Domino\" \u2013 4:34 # \"To Be A Dad\" \u2013 4:10 # \"Donkey Talk\" \u2013 4:27 # \"Sleeping With A Friend\" \u2013 4:55 # \"Without You Here\" \u2013 3:28 # \"In The Morning\" \u2013 3:34 # \"A Moving Story\" \u2013 3:11 # \"Little King\" \u2013 3:33 # \"Short Break\" \u2013 4:20 ==Personnel== ;Squeeze *Chris Difford \u2013 rhythm guitar, vocals *Glenn Tilbrook \u2013 guitars, vocals, keyboards, programming & loops *Chris Holland \u2013 piano, organ, keyboards, vocals *Hilaire Penda \u2013 bass *Ashley Soan \u2013 drums, vocals with: *Nick Harper \u2013 guitar on \"A Moving Story\" ==References== ==External links== * Album summary Category:1998 albums Category:Squeeze (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Glenn Tilbrook ",
