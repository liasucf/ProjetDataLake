Ghost-moths of the world: a global inventory and bibliography of the Exoporia (Mnesarchaeoidea and Hepialoidea) (Lepidoptera) Journal of Natural History, 34(6): 823-878. They are a natural group or clade which is the sister group of the lepidopteran infraorder Heteroneura. They are characterised by their unique female reproductive system which has an external groove between the ostium bursae and the ovipore by which the sperm is transferred to the egg rather than having the mating and egg-laying parts of the abdomen with a common opening (cloaca) as in other nonditrysian moths, or with separate openings linked internally by a \"ductus seminalis\" as in the Ditrysia. See Kristensen (1999: 57) for other exoporian characteristics. ==See also== *Ditrysia *Heteroneura *Monotrysia ==References== *IV Arthropoda: Insecta Teilband / Part 35: 491 pp. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin, New York. ==External links== *Tree of Life *Mikko's Phylogeny Archive * Abstract Category:Moth taxonomy Category:Insect infraorders ",
