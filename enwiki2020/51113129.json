It was launched on 25 July 2019 aboard a Falcon 9 rocket. The same Dragon capsule has previously flown to the ISS in April 2015 and December 2017. This was the first time a capsule was used for a third flight. ==Primary payload== leftIn February 2016, it was announced that NASA had awarded a contract extension to SpaceX for five CRS additional missions (CRS-16 to CRS-20). NASA has contracted for the CRS-18 mission from SpaceX and therefore determines the primary payload, date/time of launch, and orbital parameters for the Dragon space capsule. It carried the third International Docking Adapter (IDA-3). The following is a breakdown of cargo bound for the ISS: * Science investigations: * Crew supplies: * Vehicle hardware: * Spacewalk equipment: * Computer resources: * External payloads: IDA-3 The Dragon spacecraft also featured a handful of ceramic heat shield tiles, meant to flight-test a critical component of the SpaceX Starship spacecraft. ==See also== *Uncrewed spaceflights to the International Space Station ==References== ==External links== * NASA * SpaceX official page for the Dragon spacecraft Category:SpaceX Dragon Category:Spacecraft launched in 2019 Category:SpaceX payloads contracted by NASA Category:Supply vehicles for the International Space Station Category:Spacecraft which reentered in 2019 ",
