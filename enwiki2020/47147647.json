She went to primary school at the Colegio de Se\u00f1oritas de Masaya, where she ran the school newspaper. To obtain a secondary education, she began at the all-boys' school, Instituto de Varones de Masaya and concluded her studies at Instituto Nacional Central Ram\u00edrez Goyena in Managua. The school was considered the best in the country at that time and she finished in 1938 with high marks. Though attempts were made to dissuade her from studying law, N\u00fa\u00f1ez enrolled at the Central University of Nicaragua. In 1945, she graduated as the first female attorney from Nicaragua, and first notary; the first male lawyer, Miguel de Larreynaga, graduated in 1801. Her thesis was \u201cLa posici\u00f3n de la mujer en la Constituci\u00f3n y el Derecho Penal de Nicaragua\u201d. (The position of women in the constitution and criminal laws of Nicaragua).

In 1945, she attended the Chapultepec Conference (the fore-runner to Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance) and served as a delegate to the Inter-American Commission of Women (known now as CIM). In 1947, she attended the Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres in Guatemala City, Guatemala, as the representative of CIM. In 1950, she was named vice-minister of education, the first woman to ever hold the post. She held that post until 1956, when she was elected to the Chamber of Deputies. In 1955, she had founded the Ala Femenina Liberal (Women's Liberal Wing) of Somozas\u2019 Nationalist Liberal Party and ran on a feminist platform.
