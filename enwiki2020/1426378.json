    "text": "BNP Paribas Fortis is an international bank based in Belgium and is a subsidiary of BNP Paribas. It was formerly, together with Fortis Bank Nederland, the banking arm of the financial institution Fortis. After the ultimately unsuccessful ABN-AMRO takeover, the subprime crisis and management mistakes led to the sale of the Dutch and Luxembourg parts of the banking branch to the Dutch and Luxembourg governments. Fortis Bank itself was first partly bought by the Belgian government (for \u20ac4.7 billion), then fully purchased by the government and sold to BNP Paribas. BNP Paribas Fortis is the largest bank in Belgium. It offers a full range of financial services to private and corporate clients, wealthy individuals, companies, public and financial institutions. The activities are divided into four business lines: Retail & Private Banking, Corporate & Public Banking, Corporate & Investment Banking and Investment Solutions. The bank supports its clients abroad via offices in some 80 countries of the parent bank BNP Paribas.Resolutions of the General Meeting of Shareholders of Fortis SA/NV held on 28 April 2009 in Ghent 28 April 2009.
