    "text": "Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este (subtitled 1978/1987) is the third studio album by Brazilian rock band Legi\u00e3o Urbana, released in 1987. The album booklet features a cartoon by drummer Marcelo Bonf\u00e1 depicting the constant guitarist changes that the band went through until they hired Dado Villa-Lobos. The album sold more than 1 million copies, receiving a Diamond Certification by ABPD.Legi\u00e3o Urbana at ABPD It was also the last Legi\u00e3o Urbana album to feature bassist Renato Rocha \u2014 he would leave the band during the recording sessions of the next release, As Quatro Esta\u00e7\u00f5es. ==History== The studio recording of Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este was originally intended for a double album called Mitologia e Intui\u00e7\u00e3o (\"Mythology and Intuition\"; it was also tentatively named Disciplina e Virtude, which means \"\"Discipline and Virtue\"), which would include recordings from this album and the previous one Dois. The idea was rejected and what was left of the project was released in this album. The project was changed because, following Dois's success, the label pressured them for a third album but they didn't have enough repertoire for that. Only \"Mais do Mesmo\" and \"Angra dos Reis\" were written during the album's sessions. Besides the label's pressure (strengthened by the fact that the band had already missed the agreed deadline of three albums in 36 months), vocalist and acoustic guitarist Renato Russo himself would demand himself to quickly record some songs from his time with Aborto El\u00e9trico (\"Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este\", \"Conex\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica\" and \"T\u00e9dio\") before Capital Inicial - another band spun off Aborto El\u00e9trico - had the opportunity to do that. This helped the band let go of the idea of an all-new album in favor of some kind of anthology. At that time, they denied having faced any pressure from the label. Villa-Lobos said then: This helped to solve the lack of songs problem. Many of them were originally written when Russo performed under the name \"Trovador Solit\u00e1rio\" (Lonely Troubadour) (\"Faroeste Caboclo\", for exemple), alone with his acoustic guitar. \"Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este\" and \"Conex\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica\", for example, were written in 1978. \"Eu Sei\" was written between the end of Aborto El\u00e9trico and the foundation of Legi\u00e3o Urbana; a pirate version of the song was already being aired at some radio stations back then. As such, Russo saw the album as a way of putting an end to the widespread airing of pirate recordings of his songs. The fact that the album involved songs written throughout years is express in its title. Initial versions of \"Eu Sei\" and \"Faroeste Caboclo\", recorded in 1982 by Russo singing and playing the acoustic guitar, were recovered and released in 2008 on his posthumous solo album O Trovador Solit\u00e1rio. The verse \"talvez tenhamos que fugir sem voc\u00ea\" (we may have to flee without you) from \"Eu Sei\" originally read \"talvez tenhamos que correr e perder\" (we may have to run and lose). The album was ready in just a month. The recording took two weeks and the tracks \"Que Pa\u00eds \u00c9 Este\", \"Conex\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica\", \"T\u00e9dio\" and \"Qu\u00edmica\" were recorded in only one take. It was during this album's recording sessions that conflicts erupted between bassist Renato Rocha and the rest of the band and EMI-Odeon personnel. He was constantly late and unable to play his parts the way Russo wanted them to be performed, which made the band start to regret having hired him. == Song information == \"Angra dos Reis\" mentions the construction of a nuclear power plant in the city of same name in the state of Rio de Janeiro and \"Mais do Mesmo\" would later be the title of a compilation by the band; this was the original planned title for this album. \"Faroeste Caboclo\" was composed in 1979 during the \"O Trovador Solit\u00e1rio\" era of Renato Russo. Clocking at over nine minutes and possessing no choruses among its 159 verses, the song tells the story of Jo\u00e3o de Santo Cristo. Russo considered it his \"Hurricane\". It was the longest song by the band until the release of \"Metal contra as Nuvens\" from V. The album also features \"Depois do Come\u00e7o\", the only song by Russo that he admitted to not liking later, since he considered it too pretentious. It was created with Aborto El\u00e9trico's \"An\u00fancio de Refrigerante\" as the basis. \"Qu\u00edmica\" had already been recorded by Os Paralamas do Sucesso in their debut album Cinema Mudo. == Promotion == === Tour === During the tour launched to promote this album, an infamous performance of the band at Man\u00e9 Garrincha Stadium in Bras\u00edlia took place in June 1988 for an audience of some 50,000 people. The band started the show one hour late. During the fourth song (\"Conex\u00e3o Amaz\u00f4nica\"), Russo was attacked by a man, who was removed by security. As the show continued, the audience started to throw objects at the musicians, to which Russo replied with provocations. After one hour, the band left the stage and a frustrated audience caused a stampede that resulted in 380 injured people The band ended up sued by Distrito Federal's government. Russo even said he would never return to Bras\u00edlia after this incident, but he took it back soon after. One month later, when the band performed at Maracan\u00e3zinho in Rio de Janeiro, the audience threw daisies in response to the incident in Brazil's capital. This incident increased Russo's stage fright, and Legi\u00e3o Urbana's following work would become more introspective. ==Track listing== ===Covers=== * Brazilian bands Pato Fu, 14 Bis and Boca Livre have made cover versions of \"Eu Sei\". * Metal band Viper have covered \"Mais do Mesmo\" on their album Tem pra Todo Mundo. * Os Paralamas do Sucesso and Tit\u00e3s have both covered the title track; the first in their 1999 live album Ac\u00fastico MTV, and the latter during a live Legi\u00e3o Urbana tribute by various artists. ==Personnel== Per the booklet: === Legi\u00e3o Urbana === * Dado Villa-Lobos \u2014 guitars, acoustic guitar, percussion, backing vocals * Renato Russo \u2014 vocals, keyboards, acoustic guitar * Renato Rocha \u2014 bass, backing vocals * Marcelo Bonf\u00e1 \u2014 drums, percussion and keyboards === Technical personnel === * Jorge Davidson \u2014 artistic direction * Mayrton Bahia \u2014 production direction, executive producer, mixing * Jorge Brum \u2014 studio assistant * Ricardo Junqueira \u2014 cover and booklet pictures * Marcelo Benzaqu\u00eam \u2014 booklet pictures * Fernanda Villa-Lobos \u2014 art direction and execution * J.
