On December 27, 2012, the group announced that they had stopped operating independently and that now they are part of the \"honorable\" Gulf Cartel. In June 2020, it was reported that Los Pelones was now an independent cartel due to the fragmentation of the Gulf Cartel.https://www.insightcrime.org/news/analysis/jalisco-cartel-dominate- mexico/ == See also == * Mexican drug war * Los Negros * Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel ==References== Category:Organizations established in 2004 Category:2004 establishments in Mexico Category:Gangs in Mexico Category:Paramilitary organizations based in Mexico Category:Beltr\u00e1n-Leyva Cartel Category:Gulf Cartel Category:Sinaloa Cartel Category:Mexican drug war ",
