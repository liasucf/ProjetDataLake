Map of the Philipse Patent showing the holdings of Philip, Susanna, and Mary Philipse Philip Philipse (1724\u20131768) was the second son of Frederick Philipse II, 2nd Lord of Philipsburg Manor of Westchester County, New York. He was, along with his sisters Susanna (1727\u20131822), Mary (1730\u20131825), and Margaret (1733-1752), a one-quarter heir to the roughly \"Highland Patent\" of his father (later to become known as the Philipse Patent, and in time today's Putnam County of southeastern New York). Margaret died intestate, and her share was equally divided among her named living siblings. A redistribution of the land among them was done in 1754.French's Gazetteer of the State of New York (1860): \u201cThe Philipses Patent\u2026 divided among the remaining three [children] Philip\u2026 Susannah married to Beverly Robinson, and Mary married to Col. Roger Morris. On the 7th of Feb 1754, the patent was divided into 9 lots: 3, each 4 mi. square, bordering upon the Hudson and denominated \u2018water lots;\u2019 3, each 4 mi. wide by 12 long, extending N. and S. across the patent, and denominated \u2018long lots;\u2019 3, each 4 mi. square, upon the E. border denominated \u2018back lots.\u2019 Philip, Susannah and Mary Philipse each owned one of each kind of lots.\" Philip's elder brother, Frederick Philipse III (1720\u20131785), inherited the family's vast 52,000 acre hereditary estate in lower Westchester County, New York, Philipsburg Manor, and was its third and last Lord. All the Philipses were Loyalists during the Revolutionary War and had their lands seized in 1779 by the Revolutionary government of the Province of New York.Purple, Edwin R., \"Contributions to the History of the Ancient Families of New York: Varleth- Varlet-Varleet-Verlet-Verleth,\" New York Genealogical and Biographical Record, vol. 9 (1878), pp. 120-121 Though never compensated for their losses by the Colonial government,Description of the Abstract of Sales, Commissioners of Forfeiture \"Many citizens of New York, however, still harbored strong resentment against the loyalists, leading the Provincial Congress to effectively nullify the Treaty of Paris of 1783 by an act of May 12, 1784.\" various family members did receive payments from the British government in following years.Life of Sir John Beverley Robinson, Bart., C.B., D.C.L.: Chief-Justice of Upper Canada, by Major General Charles Walker Robinson, C.B. (1904), as cited at Loyal American Regiment, Beverley. Ultimately the British Compensation Commission granted them \u00a324,000 toward the original \u00a380,000 value of he and Susanna's personal estate (reflecting about \u00a316,000 Sterling, plus the 60,000 Philipse Patent acres and some city property valued together at about \u00a364,000), though only about \u00a317,000 was ever paid. An American Loyalist: The Ordeal of Frederick Philipse III, Stefan Bielinski, New York State Museum (1976). Bielinski claims Frederick Philipse III was \"compensated handsomely by the crown\" for his loss. No amount, however, was specified, only a prior reference to a royal pension granted him for his \"attachment to his majesty's government\" that only reached 200 pounds by 1782, a minute fraction of the over 220,000 pound loss he had suffered via attainder. ==See also== * Philipse family * Philipse Patent * Dutchess County Land Patents * The Oblong ==References== ==External links== * * Putnam's Past * Boundary Changes of Putnam County Category:1724 births Category:1768 deaths Category:American members of the Dutch Reformed Church Category:American people of Dutch descent Category:People of colonial New York Philip 1724 ",
