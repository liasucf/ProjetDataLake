    "text": "View from the Quai d'Orsay is a mid-19th century painting by the Dutch artist Johan Barthold Jongkind. Executed in oils on canvas, the painting is currently in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. == Description == The painting depicts the Quai d'Orsay on the left bank of the River Seine. In line with some of his earlier works, Jongkind rendered the Seine to be a place of industrial activity; as such, cranes, barges, rowboats, and pack animals occupy a prominent role in the painting. Further down the river, large Parisian structures can be seen, while a lightly clouded sky hangs above the river. == References == Category:1854 paintings Category:Paintings of the Metropolitan Museum of Art Category:Dutch paintings Category:Maritime paintings ",
