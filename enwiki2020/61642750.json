She published over 50 poems in 13 magazines from 1920\u20131923, including the Ladies' Home Journal, Woman's World and Contemporary Verse. She published her first collection of poetry, called Poems, in 1924. Her second collection, Green Acres, was published in 1926. She had a strong collaboration with her neighbor Mana-Zucca, starting when the composer set Laramore's poem \"My Florida\" to music. She also worked with Olive Dungan Pullen. In 1930, she began holding weekly meetings at her home, called the Laramore Poetry Group. One of the first speakers was Charles Torrey Simpson. These weekly meetings continued until and after her death. She taught poetry at her home until her death. Laramore was appointed Poet Laureate of Florida by Governor Doyle E. Carlton in 1931. She was a member of the American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers and past-president of the Miami branch of the National League of American Pen Women. After her appointment to Poet Laureate, she began publishing in the Miami Daily News every Sunday. Her column, Miami Muse, featured over 780 local poets for over 15 years. After the death of her husband Robert Laramore in 1936, Vivian was invited by Rollins College Vice-President Dr. Grover to teach a poetry class in Blowing Rock, North Carolina. She was then invited to teach at the Huckleberry Mountain Artist's Colony, where she taught every summer until 1955. At this point in her life, she met Hannah Kahn and they became close personal friends. == Style == She created the \"quatern\" form of poetry, a variation of the Kyrielle. This is a sixteen-line poem composed of four quatrain stanzas, where the first line of stanza 1 is repeated in each quatrain: the second line of stanza 2, the third line of stanza 3, and the fourth line of stanza 4. Laramore preferred contemporary poetry and disliked reading prose. She named Edna St. Vincent Millay, Sara Teasdale, Robert Frost, and Robinson Jeffers as poets she liked to read. Robert Frost said of her, \"To me Florida will always be the poetry of Vivian Laramore Rader.\" ==Published works== === Poems === * Green Acres (1926) * Flamingo (1932) * Florida Poets: being an anthology of poems published in the Miami Daily News\" (1933) * The technique of poetry, as taught by Vivian Yeiser Laramore (1938) * Had Sappho written sonnets (1939) * Poinciana poems (1953) * Ode to Life and selected Poems (1967) Musical scores * \"When you are near\" (1925, with Blanche Crook) * \"Mango Moon\" (1936, with Olive Dungan) * \"My Florida\" (1937, with Mana-Zucca) * \"Tropic Sea Melody\" (1949, with Olive Dungan) ==Honours, decorations, awards and distinctions== *Poet Laureate of Florida (1931\u20131975) *Bishop Prize (1929) ==References/Notes and references== Category:1892 births Category:1975 deaths Category:American women poets Category:Poets Laureate of Florida ",
