    "text": "Reconstruction of Yayoi people from the National Museum of Nature and Science in Tokyo, Japan The were an ancient ethnic group that migrated to the Japanese archipelago mainly from the Korean Peninsula during the Yayoi period (300 BCE-300 CE). Radio-carbon evidence suggests the Yayoi period began between 1,000 and 800 BCE.Silberman et al., 154\u2013155.Schirokauer et al., 133\u2013143. They interacted, killed off and/or mixed with the remaining J\u014dmon people to form the modern Japanese people. Most modern Japanese people have primarily Yayoi ancestry (more than 90% on average, with their remaining ancestry deriving from the J\u014dmon). ==Origin== The terms Yayoi and Wajin can be used interchangeably, though \"Wajin\" (\u502d\u4eba) refers to the people of Wa and \"Wajin\" (\u548c\u4eba) is another name for the modern Yamato people.David Blake Willis and Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu: Transcultural Japan: At the Borderlands of Race, Gender and Identity, , p. 272: \"\u201cWajin,\u201d which is written with Chinese characters that can also be read \u201cYamato no hito\u201d (Yamato person)\". There are several hypotheses about the origin of the Yayoi people: * The most popular theory is that they were the people who brought wet rice cultivation to Japan from the Korean peninsula and Jiangnan near the Yangtze River Delta in ancient China.\u5d0e\u8c37\u6e80\u300eDNA\u30fb\u8003\u53e4\u30fb\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u5b66\u969b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u793a\u3059\u65b0\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u53f2\u300f(\u52c9\u8aa0\u51fa\u7248 2009\u5e74)(in Japanese) This is supported by archeological researches and bones found in modern southeastern China. * Another view is that they are from the northern part of the Korean peninsula. This is because the human bones of the Doigahama ruins resemble the ancient human bones of the northern part of the Korean peninsula, and pottery is similar to the \"Engraved band sentence pottery\", that is widely used during the Yayoi period and was also discovered in the Sini-Gai culture in the southwestern coastal province of Primorskaya Oblast.\u30ed\u30b7\u30a2\u6975\u6771\u65b0\u77f3\u5668\u6642\u4ee3\u7814\u7a76\u306e\u65b0\u5c55\u958b (in Japanese) * The theory that Yayoi people have multiple origins has also been suggested and is influential.\u5fb3\u6c38\u52dd\u58eb (2003)\u300cHLA \u3068\u4eba\u985e\u306e\u79fb\u52d5\u300d\u300eScience of humanity Bensei \u300f(42), 4-9, \u6771\u4eac\uff1a\u52c9\u8aa0\u51fa\u7248 (in Japanese)\u5ca1\u6b63\u96c4\u300e\u7570\u4eba\u305d\u306e\u4ed6 \u65e5\u672c\u6c11\u65cf=\u6587\u5316\u306e\u6e90\u6d41\u3068\u65e5\u672c\u56fd\u5bb6\u306e\u5f62\u6210\u300f \u8a00\u53e2\u793e 1979 (in Japanese) * The historian Ann Kumar presented genetic and linguistic evidence that some of the Yayoi people were of Austronesian origin. *According to several Japanese historians, the Yayoi and their ancestors, the Wajin, originated in the today Yunnan province in southern China.\u9ce5\u8d8a\u61b2\u4e09\u90ce\u300e\u539f\u5f25\u751f\u4eba\u306e\u6e21\u6765 \u300f(\u89d2\u5ddd\u66f8\u5e97,1982)\u3001\u300e\u502d\u65cf\u304b\u3089\u65e5\u672c\u4eba\u3078\u300f(\u5f18\u6587\u5802 ,1985)\u3001\u300e\u53e4\u4ee3\u671d\u9bae\u3068\u502d\u65cf\u300f(\u4e2d\u516c\u65b0\u66f8,1992)\u3001\u300e\u502d\u65cf\u30c8\u30e9\u30b8\u30e3\u300f(\u82e5\u6797\u5f18\u5b50\u3068\u306e\u5171\u8457\u3001\u5927\u4fee\u9928\u66f8\u5e97,1995)\u3001\u300e\u5f25\u751f\u6587\u5316\u306e\u6e90\u6d41\u8003\u300f(\u82e5\u6797\u5f18\u5b50\u3068\u306e\u5171\u8457\u3001\u5927\u4fee\u9928\u66f8\u5e97,1998)\u3001\u300e\u53e4\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56fd\u3068\u502d\u65cf\u300f(\u4e2d\u516c\u65b0\u66f8,2000)\u3001\u300e\u4e2d\u56fd\u6b63\u53f2\u502d\u4eba\u30fb\u502d\u56fd\u4f1d\u5168\u91c8\u300f(\u4e2d\u592e\u516c\u8ad6\u65b0\u793e,2004) Suwa Haruo considered Wa-zoku (Wajin) to be part of the Baiyue (\u767e\u8d8a).\u8acf\u8a2a\u6625\u96c4\u7de8\u300e\u502d\u65cf\u3068\u53e4\u4ee3\u65e5\u672c\u300f(\u96c4\u5c71\u95a3\u51fa\u7248\u30011993)\u307e\u305f\u8acf\u8a2a\u6625\u96c4\u901a\u4fe1100 The Yayoi were present on large parts of the Korean Peninsula before they were displaced and assimilated by arriving proto-Koreans.Vovin, Alexander (2013). \"From Koguryo to Tamna: Slowly riding to the South with speakers of Proto-Korean\". Korean Linguistics. 15 (2): 222\u2013240. Similarly Whitman (2012) suggests that the Yayoi are not related to the proto-Koreans but that they were present on the Korean peninsula during the Mumun pottery period. According to him, Japonic arrived in the Korean peninsula around 1500 BCE and was brought to the Japanese archipelago by the Yayoi at around 950 BCE. The language family associated with both Mumun and Yayoi culture is Japonic. Koreanic arrived later from Manchuria to the Korean peninsula at around 300 BCE and coexist with the descendants of the Japonic Mumun cultivators (or assimilated them). Both had influence on each other and a later founder effect diminished the internal variety of both language families. === Genetics === It is estimated that Yayoi people mainly belonged to Haplogroup O-M176 (O1b2) (today ~36%), Haplogroup O-M122 (O2, formerly O3) (today ~23%) and Haplogroup O-M119 (O1) (today ~4%), which are typical for East- and Southeast-Asians. Mitsuru Sakitani suggests that haplogroup O1b2, which is common in today Koreans, Japanese and some Manchu, and O1 are one of the carriers of Yangtze civilization. As the Yangtze civilization declined several tribes crossed westward and northerly, to the Shandong peninsula, the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese archipelago.\u5d0e\u8c37\u6e80\u300eDNA\u30fb\u8003\u53e4\u30fb\u8a00\u8a9e\u306e\u5b66\u969b\u7814\u7a76\u304c\u793a\u3059\u65b0\u30fb\u65e5\u672c\u5217\u5cf6\u53f2\u300f(\u52c9\u8aa0\u51fa\u7248 2009\u5e74 One study calls haplogroup O1b1 as a major Austroasiatic paternal lineage and the haplogroup O1b2 (of Koreans and Japanese) as a \"para-Austroasiatic\" paternal lineage. The modern Yamato people are predominantly descendants of the Yayoi people and closely related to other modern East Asians, particularly Koreans and Han Chinese. It is estimated that the majority of Japanese people around Tokyo have about 12% J\u014dmon ancestry or less. A genome research (Takashi et al. 2019) confirmed that modern Japanese (Yamato) descend mostly from the Yayoi people. Mitochondrial DNA analysis of J\u014dmon and modern Japanese samples show that there is a discontinuity between the mtDNAs of people from the J\u014dmon period and people from the Kofun and Heian periods. This finding implies that the genetic conversion of the Japanese people may have occurred during or before the Kofun era, at least at the Shomyoji site.David Blake Willis and Stephen Murphy-Shigematsu: Transcultural Japan: At the Borderlands of Race, Gender and Identity, , p. 272: \"\u201cWajin,\u201d which is written with Chinese characters that can also be read \u201cYamato no hito\u201d (Yamato person)\".Another genetic study (2019) estimated that modern Japanese (Yamato) share more than 90% of their genome with the Yayoi people and less than 10% with the Jomon. A more recent study by Gakihari et al. 2019 estimates that modern Japanese people have on average about 92% Yayoi ancestry (with the remainder being from the Jomon) and cluster closely with other East Asians but are clearly distinct from the Ainu people. A geneflow estimation by Gakuhari et al. suggests only 3,3% J\u014dmon ancestry in modern Japanese. == Language == ==See also== *Japanese people *Yayoi culture ==References== ==Notes== Category:Ancient Japan Category:Archaeology of Japan Category:Tribes of ancient Japan Category:Yayoi period ",
