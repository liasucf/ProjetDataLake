    "text": "Earl Stephen Bishop (born November 14, 1951) is an American singer-songwriter, actor, and guitarist. His biggest hits include \"On and On\", \"It Might Be You\" and \"Save It for a Rainy Day\". He has appeared in and contributed musically to many motion pictures, including National Lampoon's Animal House. == Life and career == === Beginnings === Bishop was born and raised in San Diego, California, and attended Will C. Crawford High School.San Diego Reader Stephen Bishop entry Retrieved August 17, 2010. Originally a clarinetist, he persuaded his brother to buy him a guitar after seeing the Beatles on The Ed Sullivan Show. In 1967, he formed his first group, the Weeds, a British Invasion-styled band.Larkin, Colin (1999). The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Concise 3rd Edition, p. 134. Virgin Books, London. After the Weeds folded, Bishop moved to Los Angeles in search of a solo recording contract. During a lean eight-year period, where he was rejected \"by nearly every label and producer,\"Crowe, Cameron. \"Stephen Bishop: King of the Middle of the Road\", Rolling Stone, November 16, 1978, p. 19. he continued to write songs, eventually landing a $50-a-week job with a publishing house. Bishop's break came when a friend, Leah Kunkel, gave Art Garfunkel one of Bishop's demo tapes. Garfunkel chose two of his songs, \"Looking for the Right One\" and \"The Same Old Tears on a New Background\", to record for the platinum album Breakaway. Via Garfunkel's patronage, Bishop finally secured a recording contract with ABC Records in 1976. === Recording career === Bishop's first album, Careless, included two of his biggest hits. The first single released, \"Save It for a Rainy Day\", introduced Bishop to the listening public and went to number 22 on the Billboard singles chart.Whitburn, Joel (2000). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 7th Edition, p. 65. Billboard Books, New York. The next single, Bishop's highest charting to date, \"On and On\", peaked at No. 11. The album itself rose to number 34 on the Billboard albums chart.Whitburn, Joel (1995). The Billboard Book of Top 40 Albums, 3rd Edition, p. 35. Billboard Books, New York. Eric Clapton, Art Garfunkel and Chaka Khan all contributed their talents to the album. Careless went gold, as did Bishop's subsequent album Bish, released in 1978. Bish included one charting single, \"Everybody Needs Love\", which made it to number 32. The album also includes a smooth classic called \"A Fool At Heart\" that features Chaka Khan and Natalie Cole on background vocals. Bishop's third album, Red Cab to Manhattan, released in 1980, failed to chart and was his last released in North America for nine years. Bishop has written and performed music for many motion pictures. In 1978, he contributed the original song \"Dream Girl\" and theme to National Lampoon's Animal House, which he sang in falsetto. In 1980, Bishop contributed backing vocals to \"This Must Be Love\", from Phil Collins' debut solo album Face Value. Bishop's next hit, charting at number 25 in 1982, was \"It Might Be You\", the theme from the movie Tootsie, unusual in that it was not penned by Bishop. Written by Dave Grusin, Alan Bergman, and Marilyn Bergman, it was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song. Bishop's composition \"Separate Lives\", sung by Phil Collins and Marilyn Martin, from the 1985 movie White Nights, was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Song, losing to \"Say You, Say Me\" from the same film. Bishop wrote the song about his breakup with actress Karen Allen, who also appeared in Animal House. Bishop said: \"I write much better when I'm heartbroken and sad or melancholy.\"Separate Lives Songfacts.com; retrieved January 14, 2009. Other movie music includes: \"Somewhere in Between\" (written and performed) from The China Syndrome (1979), \"Your Precious Love\" (performed with Yvonne Elliman) from Roadie (1980), \"If Love Takes You Away\" (written and performed) from Summer Lovers (1982), \"Unfaithfully Yours (One Love)\" (written and performed) from Unfaithfully Yours (1984), \"Something New in My Life\" (performed) from Micki & Maude (1984), \"The Heart Is So Willing\" (performed) from The Money Pit (1986), \"All I Want\" (performed) from All I Want for Christmas (1991), and \"You Can Do Anything\" (written and performed by Bishop and Jeff Jones) from Barney's Great Adventure (1998). In addition, the original version of \"Walkin' on Air\" (written and performed by Bishop) was featured in the 1986 film The Boy Who Could Fly. In 1989, Bishop released the album Bowling in Paris with Phil Collins (co-producer on some songs), Eric Clapton and Sting contributing. The album included a revamped version of \"Walkin' on Air\", this time featuring drumming, production, and additional vocals from Collins. This version became a #13 hit on the Adult Contemporary chart. In 1987, the Norwegian swing/pop duo Bobbysocks! had recorded their own version of \"Walking on Air\" (as \"Walkin' on Air\") as the title track to their album Walkin' on Air. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed Bishop among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. ===Other appearances=== Bishop has appeared in several motion pictures as a \"charming\" character, including four directed by John Landis. He had a cameo role, billed as \"Charming Guy\", in The Kentucky Fried Movie (1977), appearing as a hustler in the infamous \"Catholic High School Girls in Trouble\" segment. In addition to singing the theme song off- screen, Bishop had a cameo, billed as \"Charming Guy with Guitar\", in National Lampoon's Animal House (1978), as the aspiring folk singer whose guitar John Belushi smashes. Bishop still keeps the smashed guitar as a memento. He appeared in The Blues Brothers (1980), billed as \"Charming Trooper\", who breaks his watch during the mall chase. He appeared, very briefly, in Twilight Zone: The Movie (1983), billed as \"Charming G.I.\", in the Vietnam War scene. Bishop also appeared, as \"Blue London\", in Harry Jaglom's Someone to Love (1987). Eric Clapton mentioned Bishop in his autobiography as one of his favorite singer-songwriters.Clapton, Eric (2007).
