After 1957 when Kwame Nkrumah banned sectarian parties based on ethnicity, region etc. with a focus on nationally represented parties, the Northern People's joined forces with other sectarian focused parties to form the United Party (Ghana) until 1964 when Ghana became a one party state after a referendum. C. K. Tedam was thus compelled to become a Convention People's Party (CPP) Member of Parliament or lose his seat. Becoming a member of the CPP also served another purpose as it meant the CPP government will reverse the suspension of his brother as Chief of Paga which was being contested by the Chief's brother.(C.K.
