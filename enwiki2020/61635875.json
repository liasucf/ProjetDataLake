    "text": "The men's 67.5 kg weightlifting competitions at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London took place on 10 August at the Empress Hall of the Earls Court Exhibition Centre.Official Report, p. 476. It was the sixth time the lightweight class competition was held, all at 67.5 kg. Each weightlifter had three attempts at each of the three lifts. The best score for each lift was summed to give a total. The weightlifter could increase the weight between attempts (minimum of 5 kg between first and second attempts, 2.5 kg between second and third attempts) but could not decrease weight. If two or more weightlifters finished with the same total, the competitors' body weights were used as the tie-breaker (lighter athlete wins).Official Report, p. 481. ==Records== Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows. {| class=\"wikitable\" |rowspan=4|World record | Press | | 109 kg | | 1948 |- | Snatch | | 116.5 kg | | 1939 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 153.5 kg | | 1939 |- | Total | | 367.5 kg | Paris, France | 18\u201319 October 1946 |- |rowspan=5|Olympic record | Press | | 105 kg | Berlin, Germany | 2 August 1936 |- | Snatch | | 105 kg | Berlin, Germany | 2 August 1936 |- | Clean & Jerk | | 145 kg | Berlin, Germany | 2 August 1936 |- |rowspan=2| Total | | 342.5 kg | Berlin, Germany | 2 August 1936 |- | | 342.5 kg | Berlin, Germany | 2 August 1936 |} ==Results== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" !rowspan=2 | Rank !rowspan=2 | Athlete !rowspan=2 | Nation !rowspan=2 | Body weight !colspan=4 | Press (kg) !colspan=4 | Snatch (kg) !colspan=4 | Clean & Jerk (kg) !rowspan=2 | Total |- !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result !1 !2 !3 !Result |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 65.74 || 92.5 || ~~97.5~~ || 97.5 || 97.5 || 107.5 || 112.5 || 115 || 115 || 140 || ~~145~~ || 147.5 || 147.5 || |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.10 || 100 || ~~105~~ || 105 || 105 || 102.5 || 107.5 || 110 || 110 || 135 || 140 || 145 || 145 || |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.13 || 90 || ~~95~~ || ~~95~~ || 90 || 105 || ~~110~~ || 110 || 110 || 130 || 135 || 140 || 140 || 340 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.17 || 97.5 || 102.5 || ~~105~~ || 102.5 || 102.5 || ~~107.5~~ || ~~107.5~~ || 102.5 || 130 || 135 || ~~137.5~~ || 135 || 340 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.46 || 102.5 || 107.5 || ~~110~~ || 107.5 || 100 || ~~105~~ || ~~105~~ || 100 || 125 || ~~130~~ || ~~130~~ || 125 || 332.5 |- | ||align=left|Kim Chang-hui ||align=left| || 66.42 || 90 || 95 || ~~97.5~~ || 95 || 95 || 100 || ~~102.5~~ || 100 || 130 || 135 || ~~140~~ || 135 || 330 |- | ||align=left|Na Si-yun ||align=left| || 66.47 || 90 || ~~95~~ || ~~95~~ || 90 || 95 || ~~100~~ || 100 || 100 || 130 || 135 || 140 || 140 || 330 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.62 || 95 || 100 || ~~102.5~~ || 100 || 95 || ~~100~~ || ~~100~~ || 95 || 127.5 || ~~132.5~~ || ~~132.5~~ || 127.5 || 322.5 |- | ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.91 || ~~95~~ || 95 || 100 || 100 || 95 || ~~100~~ || ~~100~~ || 95 || 127.5 || ~~132.5~~ || ~~132.5~~ || 127.5 || 322.5 |- | 10 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.94 || 85 || 90 || ~~92.5~~ || 90 || 92.5 || 97.5 || ~~100~~ || 97.5 || 120 || 125 || 127.5 || 127.5 || 315 |- | 11 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.22 || 90 || 95 || ~~97.5~~ || 95 || 90 || 95 || 97.5 || 97.5 || 122.5 || ~~127.5~~ || ~~127.5~~ || 122.5 || 315 |- | 12 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.88 || 87.5 || 92.5 || ~~95~~ || 92.5 || 90 || 95 || ~~100~~ || 95 || 120 || 125 || ~~127.5~~ || 125 || 312.5 |- | 13 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 65.52 || 90 || ~~95~~ || 95 || 95 || 90 || ~~95~~ || 95 || 95 || 115 || 120 || \u2013 || 120 || 310 |- | 14 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.38 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || 95 || 100 || 102.5 || 102.5 || ~~120~~ || 120 || ~~125~~ || 120 || 307.5 |- | 15 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.45 || ~~82.5~~ || 82.5 || ~~87.5~~ || 82.5 || 100 || 105 || ~~107.5~~ || 105 || ~~120~~ || 120 || ~~130~~ || 120 || 307.5 |- | 16 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.95 || 90 || ~~95~~ || ~~95~~ || 90 || 90 || 95 || ~~97.5~~ || 95 || 115 || 120 || ~~125~~ || 120 || 305 |- | 17 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.90 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || 87.5 || ~~92.5~~ || 92.5 || 92.5 || 115 || 120 || 122.5 || 122.5 || 300 |- | 18 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.16 || 85 || ~~90~~ || 90 || 90 || 85 || 90 || ~~95~~ || 90 || 115 || 120 || ~~125~~ || 120 || 300 |- | 19 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.21 || 85 || ~~90~~ || ~~90~~ || 85 || 92.5 || ~~97.5~~ || ~~97.5~~ || 92.5 || 117.5 || ~~122.5~~ || ~~125~~ || 117.5 || 295 |- | 20 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 67.5 || 80 || 85 || ~~90~~ || 85 || 85 || 90 || ~~92.5~~ || 90 || 110 || 115 || 120 || 120 || 295 |- | 21 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 63.79 || 80 || 85 || ~~87.5~~ || 85 || 70 || 75 || 80 || 80 || 102.5 || 107.5 || ~~112.5~~ || 107.5 || 275 |- | 22 ||align=left| ||align=left| || 66.58 || 92.5 || ~~97.5~~ || ~~97.5~~ || 92.5 || 92.5 || ~~97.5~~ || \u2013 || 92.5 || ~~117.5~~ || ~~117.5~~ || \u2013 || 0 || 185 |} ==New records== {|class = \"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- | Press |107.5 kg |align=left| | |- | Snatch |115 kg |align=left| | |- |Clean & Jerk |147.5 kg |align=left| | |- |Total |360 kg |align=left| | |} ==References== Category:Weightlifting at the 1948 Summer Olympics ",
