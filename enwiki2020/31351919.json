    "text": "Xianren Bridge () is a natural arch created by flowing water that has the world's longest recorded span. Carved of limestone karst, the formation bridges Buliu River in the northern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, China. Because of its remote location, accessible only by a three-hour rafting trip, it was not discovered until recently and remains relatively obscure. An expedition in October 2010 by the Natural Arch and Bridge Society first measured the bridge's span and found it to be in length.Jett, Stephen C.China Diary, The Natural Arch and Bridge Society ==See also== * List of longest natural arches ==References== ==External links== * Drone footage Category:Natural arches of China Category:Landforms of Guangxi Category:Rock formations of China ",
