His father, John, a fork-lift truck driver, was largely absent, leaving Manyonga to be raised by his mother, Joyce, a domestic cleaner. Given his surroundings, Manyonga had a poverty-stricken and dysfunctional upbringing, though his mother maintained the family home for him and his older brother and sister. He took part in local track and field competitions and his talent for long jump was soon identified. A local coach, Mario Smith, was surprised by the young man's ability and immediately set about supporting Manyonga towards a professional career.Alfred, Luke (2014-08-01).

However, the winnings of 80,000 Rand that he had received from his performances the previous year disrupted his life. Family and friends came to rely on him financially and he quickly fell into debt. Coach Mario Smith began to support Manyonga's family at his own expense so the jumper could focus on training. Around this time, Manyonga had become a regular user of tik \u2013 the local variant of crystal methamphetamine commonly used in his township. He first tried the recreational drug in 2011 and had used it when outside of competition (when it would not constitute a doping offence), but he gave a positive doping test in- competition at a national series meet on 20 March. He waived his right to have a \"B\" sample testing and admitted taking the drug for non-performance- enhancing reasons, resulting in his suspension from competition. He admitted he had developed an addiction in the preceding months and was admitted for drug rehabilitation.SA Institute for Drug Free Sport (SAIDS) \u2013 Anti Doping Disciplinary Hearing.

His coach Mario Smith was his advocate at the tribunal for the doping offence. Smith argued for a reduced period of sanction, entered as mitigating factors Manyonga's poor family situation, use of the drug for non- enhancing reasons, and lack of education on doping matters. The prosecutor argued for a full two-year ban, based on Manyonga's admittance of taking the drug and his strict liability in that regard, though they also noted that the athlete had suffered a failure of support from the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, Athletics South Africa and Stellenbosch Athletics Club, despite being one of the country's best Olympic athletes. The tribunal set a slightly reduced 18-month suspension as the punishment and in summation stated that \"There can be no disputing that the Athlete is at fault...but the exceptional social circumstances that many black athletes encounter in South Africa cannot be ignored.\" Manyonga began working with John McGrath, an Irishman and strength training coach, in 2014. Planning a return to action, Smith sent paperwork to the national athletics body for entry to the 2014 Commonwealth Games. This was not processed correctly and ultimately Manyonga did not compete. Smith died that year during a car accident while on his way to visit his athlete in Mbekweni. Manyonga's life spiralled and he missed his coach's memorial, having come across some friends taking tik en route. Following this, the National Olympic Committee president Gideon Sam visited the athlete's family home. Shocked by his situation, Sam arranged for the Committee to pay for training and accommodation at University of Pretoria's High Performance Centre. Manyonga reacted positively, saying \"I decided I can't take it anymore in Cape Town because that is where I hook myself up with the devil.\" He began training again full-time in mid-2015.
