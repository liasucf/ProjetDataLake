    "text": "The 2020 United States Senate election in Maine will be held on November 3, 2020, to elect a member of the United States Senate to represent the State of Maine, concurrently with the 2020 U.S. presidential election, as well as other elections to the United States Senate, elections to the United States House of Representatives and various state and local elections. Candidates include incumbent Republican Senator Susan Collins, Democratic nominee Sara Gideon, as well as independent candidates Lisa Savage and Max Linn. == Background == Republican Senator Susan Collins, widely considered the most liberal Republican U.S. senator, is running for a fifth term. Collins has won each election to this seat by a greater victory margin than the one before it. Observers do not anticipate this election to continue that trend. Collins was criticized for her decision to vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Supreme Court despite his anti-abortion stances (Collins describes herself as pro-choice) and allegations of sexual misconduct and abuse against him. She also faced criticism for her stance on the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Collins voted in favor of allowing witness testimony in the Senate trial, and was the first Republican to do so, but witness testimony was not allowed, and she voted to acquit Trump on both charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. She said she voted to acquit because \"impeachment of a president should be reserved for conduct that poses such a serious threat to our governmental institutions as to warrant the extreme step of immediate removal from office.\" She initially claimed that Trump \"learned a pretty big lesson\" from the impeachment, but later said that he had not learned from it after all. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Collins received backlash for arguing against $870 million in pandemic funding in the stimulus bill that came in response to the Great Recession She has also been criticized for running for third, fourth, and fifth Senate terms despite vowing to serve no more than two terms during her 1996 campaign. Since January 2020, Morning Consult has ranked Collins as the least popular U.S. Senator. The Democratic nominee, Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sara Gideon, supports criminal justice reforms, expansion of the Affordable Care Act, rejoining the Paris Climate Accord, and imposing universal background checks on gun sales to combat gun violence. In 2019, Gideon faced an election ethics complaint for accepting reimbursements for her political donations from her own PAC. Gideon apologized for the violation, reimbursed the federal government a total of $3,250, and closed the PAC. Lisa Savage, a longtime antiwar activist and schoolteacher from Solon, initially sought the Maine Green Independent Party nomination, but in late February, she announced her intention to instead qualify for the ballot as an independent due to Maine's restrictive ballot access measures. In April, Savage turned in more than 5,500 signatures to the Secretary of State's office and thus qualified for the general election ballot. Max Linn, a financial planner and conservative activist from Bar Harbor, is a Trump supporter and former candidate of the Republican and Reform parties. In July 2020, he qualified for the ballot as an independent. Former Republican State Senator Mary Small challenged the signatures on his petition, but the Secretary of State found that he had enough and he was placed on the ballot. Later that month, he announced his intention to drop out of the race to support Collins. But days later, he decided not to drop out unless Collins agreed to a list of policies, which she did not. Party primaries were initially scheduled to take place on June 9, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on the state, Governor Janet Mills rescheduled them for July 14. Mills's executive order also expanded voters' ability to request absentee ballots, which may now be done up to and on election day. The primaries were conducted with ranked choice voting. Parties qualified to participate in the 2020 primary election were the Democratic Party, the Republican Party, and the Maine Green Independent Party. ==Democratic primary== On April 20, 2019, attorney and activist Bre Kidman became the first person to announce their candidacy for the Democratic nomination, making them the first ever U.S. Senate candidate who identifies as non-binary. On June 13, 2019, former Maine gubernatorial candidate Betsy Sweet declared her candidacy. Eleven days later, Maine House Speaker Sara Gideon announced her candidacy, receiving widespread media coverage. A number of other candidates announced their candidacies, including General Jon Treacy and former Google executive and political aide Ross LaJeunesse, who would have been the first openly gay man elected to the Senate. LaJeunesse and Treacy withdrew, with LaJeunesse endorsing Gideon. Two debates were held with all three candidates, while one hosted by WCSH was attended only by Sweet and Kidman. ===Candidates=== ====Nominee==== *Sara Gideon, Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives ====Eliminated in primary==== *Bre Kidman, attorney, activist, and artist *Betsy Sweet, activist, former director of the Maine Women's Lobby, and candidate for Governor of Maine in 2018 ====Withdrawn==== *Michael Bunker, travel agent *Christine Gates *Ross LaJeunesse, former Head of International Relations at Google, former aide to George J.

Lisa Savage left the party because of Maine's ballot access requirements; Savage needed 2,000 registered party members to sign a nomination petition to appear on the ballot as the Green Party candidate but could only gather them from January 1 until the March 15 deadline. The Green Party had roughly 41,000 members statewide, which was significantly fewer than the Democratic and Republican parties but nonetheless required the same number of signatures. No alternative party candidate for statewide office had been able to meet this requirement since Pat LaMarche did so in 2006 for Governor. Instead, Savage sought to appear as an independent candidate, which required 4,000 signatures, but they may be from any registered voter, not just party members and they could have been gathered until the June deadline. ==== Withdrawn==== * David Gibson, solar design specialist (endorsed Savage) * Lisa Savage, school teacher (switched to independent) === Write-in candidates === * Tiffany Bond, lawyer and candidate for Maine's 2nd congressional district in 2018 * Ian Kenton Engelman * Douglas E. Fogg === Independents === Independent Lisa Savage is a peace activist and retired schoolteacher from Solon, Maine. Eight Independents declared their candidacy for Senate in 2020, including one affiliated with the Libertarian Party of Maine, which lost ballot access after the 2018 elections. Two qualified for positions on the November ballot. ==== Declared ==== * Max Linn, perennial candidate, financial planner, and disqualified Republican candidate for the 2018 United States Senate election in Maine * Lisa Savage, peace activist and schoolteacher (switched from Green Independent candidacy) ==== Withdrawn ==== *Joshua Arnone, accounting clerk affiliated with the Libertarian Party of Maine * Steven Golieb, Millinocket town councilor * Leigh Hawes, truck driver * Danielle VanHelsing, LGBTQ rights activist * Linda Wooten, vocational educator and conservative activist ==General election== ===Predictions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Source !Ranking !As of |- | align=left | The Cook Political Report | |August 17, 2020 |- | align=left | Inside Elections | |October 1, 2020 |- | align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball | | September 21, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Daily Kos | | August 31, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Politico | |September 9, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |RCP | |September 17, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Niskanen | |September 15, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |DDHQ | |September 16, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |538 | |October 1, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Economist | |September 23, 2020 |} === Debates === The four candidates participated in two in-person debates on September 11 and September 29, both held without an audience.
