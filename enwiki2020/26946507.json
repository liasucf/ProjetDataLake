    "text": "Paul Souriau (1852\u20131926) was a French philosopher known for his works on invention theory and aesthetics. He studied at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure where he wrote a doctoral thesis entitled Th\u00e9orie de l'invention published in 1881. In his thesis, he argues that inventions are not the result of a rigorous scientific method but rather come as a deterministic consequence of a set of conditions in which the inventor lives. This theory was contested very soon after its publication in the 1882 edition of the Revue Internationale de l'Enseignement.Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de l'enseignement sup\u00e9rieur (1882) Revue internationale de l'enseignement, Volume 3, G. Masson, ed. Also in 1882 his wife gave birth to \u00c9tienne Souriau, who also became a philosopher in aesthetics. The French thesis was created simultaneously with a Latin thesis titled De motus perceptione. The Latin thesis emphasized the importance of vision in movement perception, hence the initial title De visione motus.Guyard MM. S., Havet L., Monod G., Paris G. (1882) Revue critique d'histoire et de litt\u00e9rature, Volume 1, Ernest Leroux, ed. The thesis was a precursor for his later works on movement perception. He became a professor at the Facult\u00e9 des Lettres de Lille (now University of Lille) very soon after its foundation in 1887. In 1889, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of movement.Paul Souriau (1889) L'esth\u00e9tique du mouvement, F\u00e9lix Alcan, ed. The book described two levels of movement aesthetics: the mechanical beauty (the adaptation of the movement to fulfil its goal) and the movement expression (the meaning of the movement for an observer). By doing so Souriau distinguished movement from perception of movement, two concepts which later became the subjects of studies of motor cognition and psychophysics. Throughout his career, but more particularly during the first decade of the 20th century, he published his reflections on the aesthetics of arts while being a professor at the University of Nancy.Paul Souriau (1901) L'imagination de l'artiste, Librairie Hachette et Cie, ed.Paul Souriau (1904) La beaut\u00e9 rationnelle, F\u00e9lix Alcan, ed.Paul Souriau (1906) La r\u00eaverie esth\u00e9tique: essai sur la psychologie du po\u00e8te, F\u00e9lix Alcan, ed.Paul Souriau (1909) La suggestion dans l'art, F\u00e9lix Alcan, ed. Throughout his life, F\u00e9lix Alcan was his main editor. == References == ==External links== * * * Paul Souriau's bibliography, OpenLibrary.
