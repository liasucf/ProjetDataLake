    "text": "Shlomo Halberstam (1908 - August 2, 2000) (), was the third Rebbe of Bobov who re-established the Hasidic dynasty in the United States after World War II. Born in Poland, he was the oldest son of Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam (1874\u20131941) of Bobov, who was murdered by the Nazis and their Ukrainian collaborators in the Holocaust. ==Rebuilding== Both he and a son his successor Naftali survived and rebuilt in America. He also rebuilt in another way: he remarried, having lost his first wife and most of their children during the Holocaust. Halberstam died in the summer of 2000, and was succeeded by his oldest son, Rabbi Naftali Halberstam (1931\u20132005). ==Legacy== A selection of his teachings were recorded in the book Kerem Shlome. Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, a son from the second wife, became Rebbe after Naftali. In 2016, the first edition of Divrei Shlomo, a new and revised selection of teachings was published by his son Ben Zion Aryeh Leibish Halberstam, the current Bobov Rebbe. The same year was also published the first edition of Chuchmes Shlomo, a new and revised selection of teachings, by his student Yechezkel Shlaff of London. ==Rebbes of Bobov== #Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (1847\u20131905) grandson of the Sanzer Rebbe, Rabbi Chaim Halberstam #Rabbi Ben Zion Halberstam (1874\u20131941) #Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam (1907\u20132000) #Rabbi Naftali Halberstam (1931\u20132005) older son of Rabbi Shlomo Halberstam current: :5.
