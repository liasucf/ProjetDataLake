Print. Poulakos' main concern is that the importance in sophistic discourse can be broken down into five different points: rhetoric is an art, style can be used as personal expression, kairos, which is the opportune moment, to prepon, also known as the appropriate moment, and to dynaton, meaning \"the possible.\" Sophistry has influenced three modern rhetorical practices: the logic of circumstances, the ethic of competition, and the aesthetic of exhibition.Poulakos, John.
