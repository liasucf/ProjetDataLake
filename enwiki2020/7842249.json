    "text": "Spirou et les hommes-bulles (Spirou and the bubble-men), written and drawn by Franquin, is the seventeenth album of the Spirou et Fantasio series. The title story appeared sequentially (in black & white) in Le Parisien Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, and only the accompanying story Les petits formats was serialised in Spirou magazine as well, before both were published in a hardcover album in 1964. ==Story== In Spirou et les hommes-bulles, memories of Le repaire de la mur\u00e8ne are invoked as John Helena, \"the Moray\", escapes from captivity, and Spirou, Fantasio and the Count suspect he is going after the gold that is still in the wreckage of Le Discret. A sudden trend of mini-submarine sabotage prompts the heroes to investigate, and the mystery becomes no more clear when Helena is discovered barely conscious, with gold, feebly warning of an attack by the \"Bubble Men\". In Les Petits Formats, Marsupilami playfully exposes Fantasio's unused film, forcing him to go to Mr. Flashback's photo store to buy replacements. When Spirou next meets Fantasio, he is reduced to a palm-sized, paralyzed miniature statue, which causes Spirou to question his own sanity. In a setting of other similar incidents involving Mr. Flashback, and a suspicious collector of miniatures, Spirou is set on a desperate mission to somehow restore his friend back to normal. ==Background== Uniquely, Spirou et les hommes-bulles was never published in the Spirou magazine, but only in Le Parisien Lib\u00e9r\u00e9, uncoloured, and subsequently the later colour treatment of the two stories in this album is distinctly different from that of other Spirou albums. In comparison to its \"prequel\", Le repaire de la mur\u00e8ne, hailed for its rich and atmospheric colour-use, it is criticized for falling short in this respect, as well as other, more typical, sequel disgruntlement. ==References== * Franquin publications in Spirou BDoubli\u00e9es ==External links== * Spirou official site album index * Franquin site album index Category:Comics by Andr\u00e9 Franquin Category:Spirou et Fantasio albums Category:1964 graphic novels Category:1964 in comics Category:Works originally published in Le Parisien Category:Literature first published in serial form ",
