For most of her career she was teamed with Broadcast legend Ron Curtis and the team sat atop the ratings throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Their daily noon news regularly garnered a \"50 share\", a rare achievement.Northeast Radio Watch, Scott Fybush, December 24, 2007 Maureen was known for her smarts and her \"girl next door\" personality. Long time staffers credited Maureen with bringing out the warmth in Ron Curtis, with a powerful chemistry that viewers seemed to enjoy. Maureen has four children and the audience followed each of her pregnancies, flooding the television station with letters and gifts. Once per year Maureen brought her children on camera during the lively New York State Fair remote broadcasts. Throughout her career Green earned awards for her reporting, as well as more light-hearted accomplishments such as \"Best Hair\". She is included on the Syracuse University Newhouse School of Public Communication's Wall of Distinction, holds a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Syracuse Press Club, and several other media distinctions. From 1995 until 2007 WTVH went through a series of ownership changes and the television station began to feel the strain of a series of new managers. In December 2007, with WTVH newly emerged from bankruptcy protection and in the hands of a hedge fund, Green's position was \"eliminated\". The end of her tenure with WTVH coincided with the beginning of the Great Recession and the beginning of the end of WTVH. At the time General Manager Les Vann said he was \"hopeful\" about the future of his newsroom but the optimism was short-lived. With ratings in a free fall, Vann resigned three months later. By March 2009 WTVH dismissed most of its staff, placed the facility on the market for sale and entered into a \"shared services agreement\" with rival WSTM-TV which provides the building and staffing to produce WTVH newscasts.WTVH Ends News Operation, Michelle Breidenbach, Syracuse Post- Standard, March 03, 2009Syracuse's Channel 5 shuts down its newsroom, Michelle Breidenbach, Syracuse Post-Standard, March 02, 2009 Green became a Guest Columnist and Contributing Writer for the Syracuse Post-Standard newspaper before relocating to Massachusetts.
