    "text": "Conroy Sanderson is the collaborative name of the contemporary artists Neil Conroy and Lesley Sanderson, who have worked together since 1998. Their practice examines identity and hybridity, creating critical dialogues looking at ideas surrounding race, gender, culture, nationality and identity. Though the artists use self-portraits in their work, their identity is often hidden or disguised. They used mixed media, photography, drawing and video in their art works, often combined to form installations. ==Selected Exhibitions== * 2018 'Here I Am', Millennium Gallery, Sheffield. * 2017 'Public View', Bluecoat Gallery, Liverpool. * 2016 'Now!
