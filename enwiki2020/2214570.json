Aside from his solo work, he is the drummer for the Japanese jazz fusion band Casiopea and has participated in side projects with Keiko Matsui, Shambara, and Brian Bromberg. ==Background== Akira Jimbo began drumming at the age of 18 when he joined the Keio University Light Music Society Big Band. He became a member of Casiopea in 1980. During his solo career he formed Jimsaku- duo with Casiopea's bassist Tetsuo Sakurai in 1989. He has also worked with Hiroyuki Noritake from T-Square in the drum-duo Synchronized DNA. Jimbo has a drumming style which is best demonstrated in his drum videos and at his drum clinics. By using the DTX drum triggering system, he is able to play a full band sound without a backing track. Jimbo has assisted in the design of K Custom Hybrid Series of cymbals by Zildjian. His drum hero is Steve Gadd. In 1999, he won second place in the British drum magazine RHYTHM for most popular drummer. In June 2000, he became the first Asian drummer to be featured on the cover of Modern Drummer magazine. He appeared in the Modern Drummers Festival in 2000. ==Drum setup== One of Akira Jimbo's many Yamaha drumsets, with his 2nd signature 13\"x7\" beech snare drum One unique aspect of Jimbo's drumming is the setup of his drums. Using acoustic drums together with Yamaha electronic drum triggers, Jimbo is able to create a live performance with an array of different sounds. Apart from endorsing Yamaha drums and Zildjian cymbals, he also endorses Vic Firth drumsticks. ===MIDI Drum Trigger System=== He claims every sound is triggered as a live performance by himself, which is true in the past as the limitation of the trigger system during that time. As his career progress, in fact, now he did use many sequencing programs during some portions such as in intense drum solo part or some difficult arrangements. ===Main Drum Kit Setup=== Acoustic Drums * Yamaha WSD13AJ (13\"\u00d77\") Beech Custom Akira Jimbo Signature Snare Drum * Yamaha YD9000AJ (8\",10\",12\",14\",16\",22\") Birch Custom Akira Jimbo debut 30th Anniversary Kit Cymbals * Zildjian K Custom Hybrid Series ** 13.25\" Hi-Hat ** 17\", 19\" Crash ** 19\" China ** 21\" Ride ** 9\" Splash ** 15\" Trash Smash/Crash Electronic Drum Trigger * Yamaha DTX900 ===Past Equipments=== Drum Sets *1980 \u2013 YD9000R *1990 \u2013 Yamaha Rock Tour Custom *1992 \u2013 Maple Custom *1995 \u2013 Yamaha Rock Tour Custom *1997 \u2013 Beech Custom *2001 \u2013 Beech Custom Absolute *2004 \u2013 Oak Custom Absolute *2005 \u2013 Oak Custom Akira Jimbo 25th anniversary *2010 \u2013 YD9000AJ Akira Jimbo 30th anniversary Signature Snare Drums *1992 \u2013 MSD13AJ Maple 7ply Power Hoop (Limited) *1997 \u2013 WSD13AJ Beech 8ply Wood Hoop *2004 \u2013 NSD13AJ Oak 6ply Wood Hoop (Limited) *2012 \u2013 BSD1450AJ Old Birch 6ply Steel Hoop (Limited) ==Discography== === Studio Albums - Solo === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- \" !
