His pedigree includes the top British horse Ribot, as well as Tom Fool, Count Fleet, Bimelech, Eight Thirty, Noor, and Hyperion. Gander is New York-bred and spent almost his entire racing career of 60 starts in and around New York and New England. Bred by Angela Rugnetta, and owned by Gatsas Thoroughbreds, Gander was originally trained by Charlie Assimakopoulos, and then by John Terranova. In seven seasons, he made 60 starts and won fifteen times, placed ten times, and came in third nine times, earning $1,824,011. As a two-year-old he placed in the Damon Runyon Stakes at Aqueduct Race Track. At three, he won the Albany Stakes at the Saratoga Race Course and the Empire Classic Handicap at Belmont Park. He also placed in the Paterson Stakes and came third in the Sam F. Davis Stakes. At four, he won the Evan Shipman Handicap at Belmont, and came home second in the Grade 1 Jockey Club Gold Cup to Albert the Great. He was third to Lemon Drop Kid in the Grade I Woodward Stakes.
