    "text": "Quercus stellata, the post oak or iron oak, is a North American species of oak in the white oak section. It is a slow-growing oak that lives in dry areas on the edges of fields, tops of ridges also grows in poor soils, and is resistant to rot, fire, and drought. Interbreeding occurs among white oaks, thus many hybrid species combinations occur. == Introduction == Q. stellata is native to the eastern and central United States, and found along the east coast from Massachusetts to Florida, and as far inland as Nebraska. It is identifiable by the rounded cross-like shape formed by the leaf lobes and hairy underside of the leaves. == Description == 1812 illustrationillustration from Histoire des arbres forestiers de l'Am\u00e9rique septentrionale, consid\u00e9r\u00e9s principalement sous les rapports de leur usages dans les arts et de leur introduction dans le commerce ... Par F.s Andr\u00e9-Michaux. Paris, L. Haussmann,1812-13. Fran\u00e7ois Andr\u00e9 Michaux (book author), Pierre-Joseph Redout\u00e9 (illustrator), Renard (engraver) Post oak is a relatively small tree, typically tall and trunk in diameter, though occasional specimens reach tall and in diameter. The leaves have a very distinctive shape, with three perpendicular terminal lobes, shaped much like a Maltese cross. They are leathery, and tomentose (densely short- hairy) beneath. The branching pattern of this tree often gives it a rugged appearance. The acorns are long, and are mature in their first summer. == Taxonomy == The specific epithet stellata is Latin for \"star\"; it is named this because the trichome hairs on the bottom of the leaves are stellate or star-shaped. Several variants of Q. stellata were named by American botanist Charles Sprague Sargent. The variety most recognised by the US Forest Service is Q. stellata var. paludosa Sarg (delta post oak)Stransky, John J. \"Quercus stellata Wangenh.--post oak.\" Silvics of North America 2 (1990): 738-743. === Varieties === Varieties include: * var. margarettiae (Ashe) Sarg. * var. paludosa Sarg. * var. boyntonii (Beadle) Sarg. * var. anomala Sarg. * var. attenuata Sarg. * var. araniosa Sarg. * var. palmeri Sarg. * var. parviloba Sarg. * var. rufescens Sarg. === Hybrids === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Hybrids !Hybrid Name !Q. stellata x |- |Q. \u00d7 stelloides E.

Wolf |Q . montana |} === Similarity to Quercus alba === Both Quercus stellata and Q. alba are in a section of Quercus called the white oaks. In the white oak section, Q. stellata is a sister taxon with Quercus alba. Q. stellata is sold and distributed as white oak. One identifiable difference between the two trees is that Q. stellata is 'hairy' on the underside of the leaf.Stein, John D., Denise Binion, and R. E. Acciavatti. \"Field guide to native oak species of eastern North America.\" (2003): 96-97. == Distribution and habitat == Q. stellata is found in Southeastern United States, in the coast states from Massachusetts, to Texas, and inland to Iowa. Normally found at the edge of a forest, it typically grows in dry, sandy areas, deficient of nutrients. == Uses == Because of its ability to grow in dry sites, attractive crown, and strong horizontal branches, it is used in urban forestry. It is resistant to decay, so it is used for railroad ties, siding, planks, construction timbers, stair risers and treads, flooring, pulp, veneer, particle board, fuel, and its namesake fence posts. It is used for wildlife food for deer, turkeys, squirrels, and other rodents, but because the nuts contain tannin, it is toxic to cattle. It is one of the most common types of wood used for Central Texas barbecue. == Fire ecology == Q. stellata has the ability to survive fires by having thicker bark. It is useful for fire surveys where the tree rings are used to get a fire history of an area. A tree ring survey of 36 trees in Illinois provided a 226-year tree ring record that indicated that many Q. stellata persisted through annual fire return intervals of 1.44 fires/year for over 100 years. == External links == * IPNI * Kew * Flora of North America * Plants.USDA.gov * US Forest Service * Flora of the Southern and Mid-Atlantic States * Q. stellata images from Vanderbilt University * photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in Missouri in 1939 ==References== stellata Category:Endemic flora of the United States Category:Trees of the Eastern United States Category:Trees of the Southern United States Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of the Southeastern United States Category:Flora of the United States Category:Plants described in 1787 ",
