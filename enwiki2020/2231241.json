    "text": "The Lorraine City Council (in French: Conseil municipal de la Ville de Lorraine) is the governing body of the mayor\u2013council government in the city of Lorraine, Quebec, Canada. The city and its council were established on February 4, 1960 by means of Private Bill 125 of the Twenty-Fifth Legislature of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec (now National Assembly of Quebec). Since June 1962, regular sittings are held once a month at the Garth House, 100 Grande Cote, Lorraine, Quebec. The agenda for each meeting is not published in advance resulting in low citizen attendance. ==Formation and Pre-Elective History== The bill stated that the first aldermen were to be: * Luc Larose, professional engineer, of Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se * Germain Laplante, workman, of the parish of Sainte-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se-de-Blainville * J. Andr\u00e9 Laferri\u00e8re, land surveyor, of Montreal * Peter McKenzie, financier, of Pointe-Claire * Gerald M. Barlow, manager, of Montreal * Donald Kirk, professional engineer, of Westmount * John J. Seguier, gentleman, of Montreal. The first sitting of the Council occurred on May 9, 1960; John J. Seguier was named mayor by the aldermen, as the law provided. At the same time Luc Larose resigned and was immediately replaced by Edward Whittingham, manager, of Montreal West. On November 13, 1963, alderman Germain Laplante resigned and was immediately replaced by J. Albert Cl\u00e9ment, engineer. On November 18, 1964, alderman Gerald M. Barlow resigned; on December 12, Peter McKenzie resigned. They were replaced that day by aldermen J. C. Sarault and Arthur E. Ainger, both of Lorraine. ==Elected Body== Although Bill 125 indicated an election would occur on the first Monday of February 1965, provisions were made to extend the deadline for up to two years upon petition by the majority of the land-owners (per area). Such petition was approved and sent to the Provincial Government by the Council on October 21, 1964; the first election thus occurred on January 25, 1967. In the meantime, the Cities and Towns Act was modified so that alderman seats would have to be numbered. Each alderman was thus attributed a numbered seat on December 14, 1966. {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" !Election !! Mayor !! Seat no 1 !!

The next election is scheduled for November 2009. *Sources: City Charter (Bill 125); Proceedings of the Council; List of Council Members established by the City.
