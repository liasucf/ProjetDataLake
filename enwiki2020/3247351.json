In 1995, Marvelwood moved from its cramped campus in Cornwall to the former Kent School girls' campus about away on Skiff Mountain in Kent, CT. The Marvelwood student body consists primarily of boarding students, with about 20% of students commuting from home. Of those boarding students, about 24% are international, coming from countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, Spain, France, Russia, and Vietnam. The school offers a three-level ESL program to accommodate foreign speakers.http://www.marvelwood.org/page.cfm?p=361 Weekly community service and others hands-on programs are cornerstones of the School === Academic Programs === Intentionally small and flexible, Marvelwood offers an intimate mountain-top setting for students who benefit from focused and individual attention and encouragement. Students are engaged in unique and hands-on programming, nurturing them towards academic and personal confidence. Our program is geared to providing a strong preparation for college and laying the foundation for a lifetime of curiosity, inquiry and learning. Marvelwood's optional Learning Support Program customizes one-on-one and small group curriculum to suit each student. Orton-Gillingham trained teachers work with students with dyslexia and other language-based learning differences. Outside the classroom, students participate in a wide variety of activities, including weekly community service, competitive athletics, creative arts programs, and an award-winning film studies program. Marvelwood works locally with the Sharon Audubon Society and Institute for Bird Populations. Cornell University's Feeder Watchhttp://www.birds.cornell.edu/pfw/ survey also uses Marvelwood's weather data. === Campus Organizations === Music on the Mountain Currently in its sixth year, Music on the Mountain was created as a way to showcase talented performers. Held about once per month, Music on the Mountain is an open mic event hosting a range of student and local performers. The types of performers vary immensely, from singers and musicians to comedians and dancers.http://www.marvelwood.org/page.cfm?p=649 ==Notable alumni== * Jake Burton - founder of Burton Snowboards * Robb Demarest - lead investigator of the Sci-Fi channel program \"Ghost Hunters International\" http://www.scifi.com/ghi * John P.
