    "text": "Periodic Steady-State Analysis (PSS analysis) computes the periodic steady- state response of a circuit at a specified fundamental frequency, with a simulation time independent of the time constants of the circuit. The PSS analysis also determines the circuit's periodic operating point which is required starting point for the periodic time-varying small-signal analyses: PAC, PSP, PXF, and Pnoise. The PSS analysis works with both autonomous and driven circuits. PSS is usually used after transient analysis. == Examples == The current through a capacitance of value C in time domain is i(t)= C \\frac{dv(t)}{dt} , which becomes v(t) = v(t_0) + \\frac{1}{C}\\int_{t_0}^{t_0 + t}{i(t)dt} . For this component operating in a periodic steady state circuit, its voltage will be v(t_0 + T) = v(t_0) when T is equal to its fundamental period. Referring back to the original voltage function v(t) = v(t_0) + \\frac{1}{C}\\int_{t_0}^{t_0 + t}{i(t)dt} , it can be determined that the average current flowing through the capacitor is zero in periodic steady state.
