    "text": "... Efter stormen () is the third studio album by Swedish singer-songwriter Marie Fredriksson, released on 12 October 1987 by EMI Sweden. Her first release since Roxette's commercial breakthrough in Sweden, the album was a massive success, peaking at number one on the Swedish Albums Chart and selling over 50,000 copies within a month of release. It has since been certified platinum by the Swedish Recording Industry Association for shipments in excess of 100,000 units. The title track preceded the album as its first and only commercial single, although \"Bara f\u00f6r en dag\" was also a top ten hit on the Swedish Airplay Chart. The record won Best Swedish Album at the 1987 Rockbj\u00f6rnen awards, where Fredriksson won the award for Best Swedish Female. It also received a nomination at the 1988 Grammis Awards, the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards. The album was remastered and reissued in 2003 with three bonus tracks. ==Background and recording== Following the release of Fredriksson's previous album \u2013 Den sjunde v\u00e5gen \u2013 in February 1986, she formed pop duo Roxette with Per Gessle, who released their first album \u2013 Pearls of Passion \u2013 later that same year. Both records were commercially successful in Sweden, with Fredriksson's album selling more than 90,000 copies, and Roxette's selling almost 200,000 copies. ... Efter stormen was recorded over two separate sessions at EMI Studios in May and September 1987. Recording was interrupted by Roxette's co-headlining concert tour with Eva Dahlgren and Ratata: \"Rock runt riket\" (), which ran from July to August. Gessle initially argued against Fredriksson returning to her solo work, saying that any solo album and resulting tour would negatively impact the duo's chances of achieving international success. Despite these objections, she returned to EMI Studios in September to finish recording ... Efter stormen, with Gessle using any excess studio time to record demos for Roxette's second album, Look Sharp!. ... Efter stormen was recorded with many of the same musicians who performed on Den sjunde v\u00e5gen, although the record features sparser instrumentation than that release; songs are mainly rock and folk-based, and contain almost none of the synthesizer prevalent on her earlier work. The album's second track, \"Om du s\u00e5g mej nu\" (), was written by Fredriksson in dedication to her father, who died in 1981, prior to her achieving any form of commercial success as a recording artist. ==Release and reception== The album was preceded by the release of its only commercial single, \"Efter stormen\". The song became her first top ten hit in her home country, peaking at number seven on the Swedish Singles Chart, and at number two on the Swedish Airplay Chart. The album was a commercial success upon release on 12 October 1987, debuting at number three on the Swedish Albums Chart before peaking at number one for two consecutive weeks. It sold over 50,000 copies within a month of release, and was promoted with a sold-out concert tour of Sweden, which ran for 33-dates between October and December. By the end of 1987, the album was certified platinum by the Swedish Recording Industry Association, denoting shipments of over 100,000 units. The record won Best Swedish Album at the 1987 Rockbj\u00f6rnen awards, where Fredriksson was also awarded Best Swedish Female. At the beginning of 1988, \"Bara f\u00f6r en dag\" became a top ten hit on the Swedish Airplay Chart, and Fredriksson was nominated in the Pop/Rock\u2014Female category at the 1988 Grammis Awards, the Swedish equivalent of the Grammy Awards. ==Formats and track listings== All songs written by Marie Fredriksson and Lasse Lindbom, except \"Aldrig som fr\u00e4mlingar\" written by Ulf Schagerstr\u00f6m. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of ...
