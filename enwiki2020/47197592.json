    "text": "Vikramaditya Shukla is an Indian film actor, who has appeared in Tamil and Telugu language films. ==Career== Vikramaditya made his debut in the Tamil slasher film, Whistle (2003), with a critic noting he was \"apt\" for the role. Vikramaditya then portrayed two supporting roles, firstly in Sundar C's Chinna (2005) and then in a negative role in Bambara Kannaley (2005), though both films were met with unfavourable responses from critics and at the box office. He was then selected to portray the leading male role in the Telugu film Manasu Palike Mouna Raagam (2006) which had Sneha portray the leading role. The film won good reviews and performed well at the box office. Vikramaditya then portrayed a husband engaging in an illicit affair in Tholaipesi (2007), which opened to negative reviews and had a reviewer write that the actor needed \"to work on his emotions\". His other film in 2007, the triangular love story Nanbanin Kadhali, co-starring Shivani Singh and Kunal, received similar reviews. It had been shot in 2005 under the name Cleopatra and had a delayed release. His most recent theatrical release was Agathiyan's romantic drama Nenjathai Killadhe (2008), where he portrayed a leading role alongside Vikranth and Bharathi. ==Filmography== *All films are in Tamil, unless otherwise noted. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"background:#f5f5f5;\" |- style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" !
