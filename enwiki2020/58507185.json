    "text": "Roger Sainsbury (born 11th June, 1940) is a British civil engineer. He spent much of his career with the construction contractor Mowlem, including work on Port of Immingham (Immingham Oil Terminal) and the Natwest Tower. He rose to become a director of the firm and was responsible for Mowlem\u2019s participation in the creation of the Manchester Metro and for the company\u2019s role as creator and developer of London City Airport. Sainsbury left Mowlem in December 1995 and subsequently devoted much time to the Institution of Civil Engineers (ICE), being president for the 1998-9 session. Sainsbury resigned his membership in 2001, in protest at the mishandling of a ballot of the membership, becoming the first president to take such a step. Sainsbury served on the executive board of the Construction Industry Council, as a vice president of the Construction Industry Research and Information Association, as a member of the Regulatory Policy Committee of OFWAT and as a member of the Advisory Board, Department of Engineering, Oxford University. He is a Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering. In the past he has served on the panel assessing nominations for Fellowship within the construction sector. == Early life and career == Roger Sainsbury was born in Hitchin in Hertfordshire. From 1959 to 1962 he read engineering at Keble College, Oxford, and then began his career as a designer at consultants Rendel, Palmer and Tritton. He worked on the design of Fawley power station, and then on site. The engineering challenges of that project made it a great learning ground for a young engineer. In 1966 he joined Mowlem and a year later was promoted to lead the team designing Immingham oil terminal, a design-and-construct undertaking. The project ran into difficulty owing to flow-induced oscillation of the tubular piles \u2013 a phenomenon capable of destroying major structures, never before encountered. Sainsbury led a multi-skilled team in solving the problem. The Natwest Tower (2011 photograph) He worked as project engineer, and then as project director, on the construction of the NatWest Tower (now Tower 42) in the City. This was an extraordinary structure, the building of which called for many innovative techniques. In 1979 he and a colleague shared the Man of the Year award from Construction News for work on that project. As a main board director, he was made responsible for Mowlem\u2019s efforts in the field now known as PFI. Experience in the running of prisons was enlightening. A successful venture, in consortium with others, was the project to create the Manchester Metrolink. Sainsbury was responsible for setting up the company to run the system and was its first chairman. Next came London City Airport. The originator of this bold concept was Mowlem chairman, Sir Philip Beck. Sainsbury was responsible for delivering the project and setting up the operating company \u2013 and, soon after, for developing the runway extension which has allowed the airport to accept the wide variety of aircraft now operating. == Institution of Civil Engineers == With co-authors, Sainsbury has written papers for the Institution on the Immingham, NatWest and City Airport projects, for each of which he was awarded an ICE medal. In a later reference to Immingham and to his revealing of the key parameter to prevent future danger from structural oscillation, he said, \u201cI have every reason to believe that I was the first person in the history of the world to know this. I felt at the time, and have been conscious since, how very extraordinary that was\u201d He served as a member of Council in the 1970s and, much later, was elected to serve as vice president and then president (1998-9). Sainsbury was chairman of the ICE\u2019s commercial arm, Thomas Telford (Holdings); in this role he supported the sale of the magazine publishing business. His presidential address (1) focused on learning from the experience of engineering difficulties. As president, he visited The Philippines, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Ireland, France, Spain and Portugal. His official ICE portrait was painted by Christian Furr. In 2000 Sainsbury, as immediate past president, became involved in controversy over the proposal before Council that incorporated engineers be admitted to full membership and be allowed to use the post- nominal letters MICE. At a Council meeting in April he spoke against the move. The proposal was passed by Council, and enabling bye-law changes were approved by a ballot of the membership. In February 2001, Sainsbury became the first past president in the history of the Institution to resign his membership (the ICE was founded in 1818 and elected its first president in 1820). He explained that he had resigned because the bye-law changes put to the membership ballot were not those which had been approved by Council.(1) == Personal life == Since retirement, Sainsbury has committed his time to a number of charities. He was secretary of a residential care home, chairman of the local branch of the National Association of Decorative and Fine Arts Societies (now the Arts Society), and stewardship officer for his church. After three years of research, he published a history of that church. Following some years as a trustee, he was from 2014 to 2018 executive chairman of Hampstead Garden Opera (now HGO Trust Ltd). He has a wife Susan who, for many years, supported him in journeys around Europe searching for wild orchids. In years 2000-9 they completed together an unusual and deeply satisfying retirement project \u2013 to spend a three night week-end in each of England\u2019s towns and cities having an Anglican cathedral. Of these there are 43, and each visit was carefully recorded. The couple have been active in supporting Keble college and, in2014, presented a new college register, which is signed by all matriculating students \u2013 the one previous register having been filled after 145 years. ==Principal Publications == * Oscillation of Piles in Marine Structures * CIRIA Report No 41.
