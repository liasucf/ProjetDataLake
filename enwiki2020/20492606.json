The college serves the populations of Izard, Stone, Fulton, and Sharp counties. 150px ==History== The school opened in 1975 as Ozarka Vocational-Technical School and was renamed to Ozarka Technical College by the Arkansas legislature in 1991. In 1999, it dropped the word Technical from its name to emphasize its wider range of programs. Currently the college enrolls approximately 1,500 students per semester. In 1996, Ozarka College was accredited by The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. In 2002, the college received a donation to serve as the site of a distance learning center in Ash Flat, Arkansas. The donation came from First National Bank of Sharp County and Bob Watson of Brooksville, Florida. It had an assessed value of 105,000 dollars. In 2008 a new structure designed by Rico Harris of Harris Architecture in Hot Springs, Arkansas was completed to accompany the existing building. In 2004, the library was renamed to Paul Weaver Library to honor the senator Paul Weaver due to his contribution to Ozarka College and its community. 2015 marked Ozarka College's 40th anniversary as well as the 10th anniversary of permanent campuses in Ash Flat and Mountain View and the 5th anniversary of the Mammoth Spring campus. On January 29, 2015, Ozarka College held a ribbon cutting ceremony for the new Student Services Center on the main campus in Melbourne. The Student Services Center is the first two-story building in the history of Ozarka College and houses all of Ozarka's Student Services departments including: Admissions, Financial Aid, Career Pathways, TRiO Student Support Services and others. The new Ozarka College Cafe is also located on the ground floor of the building and is open to the public. ==Notable alumni== * Gerald Clarke, artist and educator ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Community colleges in Arkansas Category:Educational institutions established in 1975 Category:Buildings and structures in Izard County, Arkansas Category:Education in Izard County, Arkansas ",
