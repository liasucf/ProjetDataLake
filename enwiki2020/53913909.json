    "text": "Rayshawn Jenkins (born January 25, 1994) is an American football safety for the Los Angeles Chargers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at Miami. He was drafted by the Chargers in the fourth round of the 2017 NFL Draft. ==Professional career== On December 5, 2016, it was announced that Jenkins had accepted his invitation to the 2017 Senior Bowl. During Senior Bowl practices, he got into a physical altercation with Grambling State's wide receiver Chad Williams. After the fight, coach Hue Jackson abruptly ended practice and addressed the South team players, stating that Jenkins and Williams had both possibly hurt their draft stock and made a poor impression. On January 28, 2017, Jenkins made two combined tackles and helped Cleveland Browns' head coach Hue Jackson's South team that defeated the North 16\u201315. Jenkins was one of 60 defensive backs that attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, Indiana. He finished ninth in the broad jump and 22nd among all defensive backs in the 40-yard dash. On March 29, 2017, Jenkins attended Miami's pro day, but opted to stand on his combine numbers and only performed the short shuttle, three-cone drill, and positional drills. During the draft process, Jenkins attended private meetings and workouts with the Minnesota Vikings and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. At the conclusion of the pre- draft process, he was projected to be a third to fifth round pick by NFL draft experts and scouts. Jenkins was ranked the fifth-best free safety by NFLDraftScout.com. The Los Angeles Chargers selected Jenkins in the fourth round (113rd overall) of the 2017 NFL Draft. ===2017=== On May 17, 2017, the Los Angeles Chargers signed Jenkins to a four-year, $3.06 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $662,209. Throughout training camp, he competed against Dwight Lowery, Tre Boston, Darrell Stuckey, Dexter McCoil, and Adrian Phillips for snaps at safety. Head coach Anthony Lynn named Jenkins the third strong safety on the depth chart, behind Jahleel Addae and Adrian Phillips. He made his professional regular season debut in the Los Angeles Chargers' 24\u201321 loss at the Denver Broncos. On September 24, 2017, he recorded his first career tackle on Akeem Hunt after a kick return in the second quarter of a 24\u201310 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. On October 15, 2017, Jenkins recorded a season-high two solo tackles in a 21\u20130 victory over the Denver Broncos. He finished his rookie season with 13 combined tackles (ten solo) and a pass deflection in 15 games and zero starts. ===2019=== Jenkins entered the 2019 season as a starting safety following injuries to Derwin James and rookie Nasir Adderley. In Week 2 against the Detroit Lions, Jenkins recorded his first career interception off Matthew Stafford in the 13-10 loss. He finished the season leading the team in defensive snaps, recording 54 tackles, four passes defensed, and a team-leading three interceptions through 16 starts. In Week 3 of the 2020 season against the Carolina Panthers, Jenkins recorded his first career full sack on Teddy Bridgewater during the 21\u201316 loss. ==References== ==External links== * Miami Hurricanes bio Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:American football safeties Category:Los Angeles Chargers players Category:Miami Hurricanes football players Category:Players of American football from Florida Category:Sportspeople from St. Petersburg, Florida ",
