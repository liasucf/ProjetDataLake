He is most famous for creating the character Werner. == Life == Feldmann completed a lithographer apprenticeship at Nordrepro in Flensburg, after which he was drafted for basic military service where he fell ill with tuberculosis. In 1971 he started work as lithographer at Geisel in Flensburg. Because he drew cartoons and comics all the time \u2013 especially caricatures of his superiors \u2013 he was dismissed in 1972. Being out of work throughout the 1970s, Br\u00f6sel mainly drew comics about the \u201eBakuninis\u201c, an anarchistic family, satirizing the radical left. His first cartoons with the character Werner were published in 1978 in the German satire magazine Pardon, as well as in the newspaper Kieler Stadtzeitung. One of the main inspirations for these were his constant battles with the German T\u00dcV and police because of his Horex alterations, as well as his contact to the Chopper community. The comics were licensed by other city newspapers like the Frankfurt-based magazine Pflasterstrand and so quickly became known nationwide. Book publications started in 1981 with Werner \u2013 Oder was?.
