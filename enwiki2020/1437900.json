    "text": "Elections in Iceland gives information on election and election results in Iceland. Iceland elects on a national level a ceremonial head of state, the president - and a legislature. The president is elected for a four-year term by the people. The parliament (Al\u00feingi) has 63 members, elected for a four- year term by proportional representation, using the D'Hondt method with open list. Iceland has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party typically has a chance of gaining power alone, so parties must work with each other to form coalition governments. The most recent election was held on 28 October 2017. ==Schedule== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Position !2017 !2018 !2019 !2020 !2021 !2022 !2023 |- !President (1 position) | | | | | | | |- !Parliament (63 seats) | | | | | | | |- !Municipalities (72 councils) | | | | | | | |} ==Latest elections== ===2017 parliamentary elections=== ===2016 presidential election=== ==See also== *Electoral calendar *Electoral system ==References== ==External links== *Adam Carr's Election Archive *Parties and elections *NSD: European Election Database - Iceland publishes regional level election data; allows for comparisons of election results, 1991-2009 *Election history ",
