Loubat was born in Sainte-Livrade-sur-Lot. He went to New York City in 1827 where he helped develop that city's first tramway in 1832. He returned to France and in 1852 developed the grooved rail, which greatly facilitated street railways and tramlines. Besides he planted wine in Brooklin and wrote on wine.Loubat, Alphonse: The American Vine Dresser's Guide. New York: D. Appleton & Co, 1827, reprinted in 1872. He died in Ville-d'Avray.
