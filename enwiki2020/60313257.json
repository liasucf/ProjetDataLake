He regards the Sikh community as the current custodian of Shastar Vidya which has been looked after by many different creeds and cultures over thousands of years and is looking for a successor to ensure the survival of the art form. His teachings include the idea that at the core of Shastar Vidya is meditation on the infinite and to see God/the infinite in all things. Nidar has authored the book \u2018In the Master's Presence - The Sikhs of Hazoor Sahib\u2019 and also teaches Shastar Vidya throughout the UK and has set up centres in Italy and India. The art form includes learning the use of weapons such as swords and chakrams. Prior to becoming a full-time martial arts instructor he worked as a factory worker to support his wife and 4 children. He lives in Wolverhampton and is searching for a successor. == Early life == Nidar met his martial arts teacher Baba Mohinder Singh by accident on a family trip to India when he was 17 and gave up higher education for the chance to study the art full-time with his teacher for 11 years. == References == ==External links== *Nidar Singh Nihang Category:English male mixed martial artists Category:People from Wolverhampton Category:1967 births Category:Living people Category:British people of Punjabi descent Category:English Sikhs ",
