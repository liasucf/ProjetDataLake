    "text": "The Amazing Race 2 () is the second installment of the Chinese reality television series The Amazing Race (). Loosely based on the American reality TV series The Amazing Race, it initially features six teams of two in a race around the world. Infiniti was still the main sponsor for this event after sponsoring Season 1. The season premiere was aired on July 10, 2015 and concluded on September 25, 2015. Friends Han Geng and Wu Xin were the winners of the season of the Race. == Production == === Development and filming === Watson Bay, at Sydney, Australia. Filming begin June 2, 2015 at Sydney and ended on August 16, 2015 at Chengdu, Sichuan. Unlike the American version and most other versions that always start and end in the same country, this was the first season where both the Starting Line and Finish Line were held in different nations, and also the first season overall in the entire franchise the Starting Line was not held in the show's home country. This season introduced two new twists. Invasion was a new twist that allowed several teams to join in the game as intruders. The intruders entered the Race at the start of a given leg. In their invasion leg, the intruders had to finish in a given position (top two in Leg 7, or first Leg 9) in order to continue racing. If they failed their invasion, they would be eliminated from the Race as if they had finished last. If they succeeded, the intruders would keep on racing in future legs. This season also introduced the Intersection with Integration Versus, which was a combination of Intersection and Versus for some tasks. At the start of the leg, the four remaining teams had to choose which team they want to be Intersected by voting. Once two teams chose each other at the same time, they would be Intersected. Then, the pairs of teams would complete in either head-to-head or timed task. The team that won the task would earn two points. After five rounds, the teams with the most points would automatically finish in first place. The second pair would compete in a final task, and the winning team would keep racing while the losing team was eliminated. === Cast === Similar to the first season, this season featured celebrities who were chosen to race on the show. Notable casting members including singers Deng Ziqi and Super Idol winner Zhang Yunjing, the Chopstick Brothers notable for the viral video \"Little Apple\", as well as the 2012 Olympics gymnast Feng Zhe. ====Future appearances==== Zhu Zhu competed on Race the World in 2016, with Yuan Heyu appearing as a replacement contestant for two episodes. === Marketing === The show was sponsored by Infiniti, Sohu, Pepsi and RRS.com. Eastroc Super Drink returned to sponsor, and teams could still pick up their drinks as energy supplements during the legs. == Results == The following teams participated in the Race, each listed along with their placements in each leg and relationships as identified by the program.

Each gear has a peg that have to be fitted in the holes, which are arranged in different places across the board. The first team to complete the board and raise the flag would win. For the final Versus of the Race, one team member would be secured to a large wheel of death. Before the task, the person would answer five questions relating to their opinion of the four teams on the race: *Which team should be eliminated? *Which team will win Season Two? *Which team do you want to exchange partner with? *Which team is worst at reading each other's mind? *Which team is best at playing mind games? Their answers determined a five-digit code which would stop the wheel from spinning. The other team member had to guess his or her teammate's answers, by rotating the rotary discs to the corresponding numbers to stop the wheel. The first team to guess correctly and stop the wheel would win. ;Additional notes *The entire leg had teams intersected with another team, with a voting to determine which teams (Red and Black Teams) would be Intersected. In a special twist known as Intersection with Integration Versus, the Intersected teams would compete in five different Versus. There are two different types of Versus: a regular Versus had both teams compete head-to-head, while Timed Versus required teams to work together to complete the task within the shortest time possible. The winning team in each Versus would be given two points (in form of Mauritian Dodo idols). After five Versus, the team with the most points would be safe from elimination and would be given a joint first- place finish. The two losing teams had to compete in one more Versus, and the team that lost the final Versus was eliminated from the Race. *Prior to the start of the leg, all four teams boarded the same flight of three different classes to Mauritius. The first-place team in the previous leg were given first class upgrade as per the reward in the last leg, while the last-place team were given economy class as per the penalties for finishing last in a non-elimination leg. ===Leg 9 (Mauritius \u2192 Thailand)=== Songkran (this is taken from Chiang Mai) Airdate: September 11, 2015 * Plaine Magnien (Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport) to Bangkok, Thailand (Suvarnabhumi Airport) via China *Taling Chan (Wat Kai Tia) *Bangkok (Bangkok Noi \u2013 Pran Nok Market) *Bangkok to Nonthaburi *Pak Kret District (Nonthaburi Wittayalai School) *Bang Yai District (Wat Pracha) * Mueang Nonthaburi District (Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat \u2013 Chaloem Kanchanaphisek Park) For this leg's Roadblock, one team member had to stack up 36 fruit crates and retrieve the clue attached from above, while their partner could assist through stacking the crates from the ground. ;Additional tasks *At Wat Kai Tia, teams had to search 100 chickens in a pen for one which matches the photo held by the teams given in their clue.

Teams would be doused in water and had to collect the water to fill a jar. When the water level of jar reaches the red marker, they would receive the next clue. ===Leg 10 (Thailand \u2192 China)=== Sichuan Liangfen to receive the next clue.

Should any point the film break before reaching the other end, they have to start over. ;Additional tasks *At Jinsha Theater, one team member was harnessed in a bungee cord and launched by his or her teammate in an attempt to retrieve one of two halves of the Jinsha relic dangling in the air. Once both halves of the relic was obtained, they had to hand it to the lead actress to obtain their next clue. *At Happy Valley Chengdu, teams would dress up as inflatable mahjong tiles and would be accompanied by four other members. One team member had to go inside the tide pool and gather eight more members, while the other team member had to arrange the order of tiles to form a hand of valid 13-tile winning combination according to the rules of Sichuan Mahjong.

If teams dropped their pieces of Liangfen three times, they would have to start over. *At International Intangible Cultural Heritage Exposition, teams had to figure out how to pass through seven rows of warriors who were guarding their final clue. In each row of warriors holding a shield displaying country flags, only one warrior holding a shield that displays one of seven flags of a previously visited country would let them through and the others would block them. Teams have to retrieve the flag before moving on to the next row. Once they passed through all seven rows, a Zhuge Liang impersonator would give the teams their final clue. == Ratings == |- |2/01 | |0.667 |2.22 |7 |- |2/02 | |0.752 |2.37 |7 |- |2/03 | |0.732 |2.34 |7 |- |2/04 | |0.689 |2.37 |9 |- |2/05 | |0.729 |2.287 |8 |- |2/06 | |0.777 |2.45 |6 |- |2/07 | |0.672 |2.08 |9 |- |2/08 | |0.632 |1.955 |11 |- |2/09 | |0.726 |2.353 |10 |- |2/10 | |0.476 |1.557 |16 ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Shenzhen TV Official Website *Sina Weibo China 2 Category:2015 Chinese television seasons Category:Reality television articles with incorrect naming style ",
