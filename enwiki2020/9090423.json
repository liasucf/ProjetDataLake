The school, founded in 1893, was the oldest operating boarding academy of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. It was a part of the Seventh-day Adventist education system, the world's second largest Christian school system.http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2010/1115/For-real- education-reform-take-a-cue-from-the-Adventists\"the second largest Christian school system in the world has been steadily outperforming the national average \u2013 across all demographics.\" ==History== The oldest boarding academy of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, Mount Vernon Academy opened its doors in 1893 to 32 students and six staff members with Professor William T. Bland as principal. By the end of the first year the enrollment had grown to about 100. The school opened in buildings previously occupied by the Mount Vernon Sanitarium, which had closed in 1891. Ellen G. White, when consulted, had written in 1893: \"Let the building be converted into a seminary to educate our youth in the place of enlarging the college at Battle Creek. I have been shown that there should...be located, school buildings in Ohio which would give character to the work\" (Ellen G. White letter K35). The day after this letter was written, J. N. Loughborough submitted a report to the General Conference in session advising the same action. Upon General Conference recommendations, the stockholders of the sanitarium voted to adopt this recommendation and to form a new corporation for the management of the Academy. After operating on the secondary level for 12 years, the school was advanced from an academy to a college. During the next 11 years, Mount Vernon College offered four-year courses leading to B.S. and B.A. degrees. Secondary work also continued during this time. Norris W. Lawrence served as the first president of the college. In 1914 the Washington Foreign Mission Seminary at Washington, D.C. (now known as Washington Adventist University), was made the training college for the Columbia Union, and the school at Mount Vernon reverted to an academy. The Administration Building was built in 1924 and housed the chapel, three classrooms, and the administrative offices. On December 24, 1926, the old sanitarium building, which was the main campus building for many years, was destroyed by fire. A partial replacement, Linden Hall, the girls' dormitory, was erected in 1927-1928. In 1940, Hadley Hall, the boys' dormitory, was built, along with additions built onto the Linden Hall. The gymnasium was completed in 1951, and in 1958, the industrial arts building. In 1968, Hiawatha Hall, which included the cafeteria, classrooms, and administrative offices, was built. Campus-wide renovations began in 2001, which included redecoration and repairs to the Cafeteria, renovating Linden Hall and Hadley Hall, renovations to the Music Building, a new Campus Center, and repairs on the gymnasium. Over $3.6 million was invested in capital improvements since 2001. Over 7,000 students attended the school during its operation. ===Closing=== In October, 2014 it was revealed the school had been severely mismanaging its finances and could not continue to operate. The academy was given 2 months to raise $3 million or shut down. Despite appeals on social media by the principal and the students under the #dosomething campaign, the fundraiser was a failure. Preparations were made for the closure and a scholarship was established to help students continue Adventist education if they so wished. Mount Vernon Academy ceased operations in June, 2015. The property which had 13 buildings across 24 acres plus 227 acres of recreational land, was sold at auction to multiple parties on June 22, 2016 for a total of $1.595 million. Ohio conference president Ron Halvorsen Jr. stated the funds raised would be used to pay some of the academy's outstanding debts and establish an education scholarship. ==Academics== Mount Vernon Academy places a high value on the rigors of academics. Block Class Schedules, integrated use of technology, a highly qualified faculty with 72% holding master's degrees, and a Dual Credit Program provide motivated students with great academic opportunities. ==Spiritual aspects== All students take religion classes each year that they are enrolled. These classes cover topics in biblical history and Christian and denominational doctrines. Instructors in other disciplines also begin each class period with prayer or a short devotional thought, many which encourage student input. Weekly, the entire student body gathers together in the auditorium for an hour-long chapel service. Outside the classrooms there is year-round spiritually oriented programming that relies on student involvement. ==Athletics== Mount Vernon Academy fielded 4 sports teams in 3 sports. In past years, the school had fielded other athletic teams. The school was accredited by the Ohio High School Athletic Association. ===AcroNics=== The AcroNics wae the co-ed gymnastics team of Mount Vernon Academy. Although they were not involved in any type of competition, the AcroNics regularly attended the annual Acrofest held at Highland Academy. The AcroNics have also performed at Quicken Loans Arena during Primetime at Cleveland Cavaliers games in 2013 and 2014. ===Bill Jarvis Invitational=== The Bill Jarvis Invitational, which started in 2010, is an annual soccer and volleyball tournament held by Mount Vernon Academy every September. Over 10 different schools from various states have participated in the invitational. ====Past champions==== Soccer *2010: Takoma Academy *2011: Granville Christian Academy *2012: Spring Valley Academy *2013: Spring Valley Academy Volleyball *2010: Spring Valley Academy *2011: Gilead Christian School *2012: Gilead Christian School *2013: Spring Valley Academy ==See also== * List of Seventh- day Adventist secondary schools * Seventh-day Adventist education ==Notes and references== ==External links== * Category:Christian schools in Ohio Category:Defunct Christian schools in the United States Category:High schools in Knox County, Ohio Category:Adventist secondary schools in United States Category:Former Seventh-day Adventist institutions Category:Private high schools in Ohio ",
