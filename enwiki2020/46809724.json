    "text": "Stormcrow is the second studio album by Finnish power metal supergroup Cain's Offering, released on 19 May 2015. It is their first album with keyboardist Jens Johansson (Stratovarius, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen) and bassist Jonas Kuhlberg. The first song to be made available was the title-track, streamed from 22 April on. Eight days later, the band streamed \"The Best of Times\". Guitarist and main songwriter Jani Liimatainen said he was approached a few years before about the possibility of a second Cain's Offering album, but at that time he was unavailable. When the subject came into consideration again in 2014, he decided to give it a try since he had more time. Comparing it to the previous album, Gather the Faithful, he said: Drummer Jani Hurula described it as \"majestic and humongous\" and also said the album songs \"are more concentrated and have more meat around them, ... Just the way we like them. The production was also exactly what each of us wanted it to be this time around.\" The title of the album, according to him, fits the band \"perfectly. ... The underdogs are back with a vengeance!\". Hurula also said the band is going to shoot a video for the album and they are also willing to tour, but he gave no further details. Liimatainen also expressed his wish to tour and shoot a video, but he depends on his band mates schedules. ==Track listing== All songs written by Jani Liimatainen except when noted ==Credits== ;Cain's Offering * Timo Kotipelto \u2013 lead vocals * Jani Liimatainen \u2013 lead and rhythm guitars, acoustic guitar, backing vocals * Jens Johansson \u2013 keyboards, piano * Jonas Kuhlberg \u2013 bass * Jani Hurula \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians * Petri Aho - backing vocals * Antti Railio - backing vocals * Perttu V\u00e4nsk\u00e4 - orchestral arrangements (on track 1, 5, 7 & 9) ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Cain's Offering albums Category:Frontiers Records albums ",
