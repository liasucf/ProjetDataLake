    "text": "Thomas Geers Winford (c.1697\u20131753), of Bridge Sollers, near Hereford, and Glasshampton, Worcestershire. was a British lawyer and Tory politician who sat in the House of Commons between 1727 and 1748. Geers Winford was the eldest son of Timothy Geers of Bridge Sollers and his wife Mercy Winford, daughter of Henry Winford of Glasshampton, Worcestershire. He was admitted at Lincolns Inn on 23 June 1719 and called to the bar in 1722. Geers was returned as a Tory Member of Parliament for Hereford on a compromise at the 1727 British general election. He voted consistently with the Opposition and spoke occasionally. On 4 February1730 he moved unsuccessfully for a vote of thanks to Dr. Samuel Croxall for his sermon preached at St. Margaret's, Westminster on the anniversary of the beheading of Charles I. This was based on the text \u2018take the wicked from before the King and His throne shall be established as righteousness\u2019 and intended as an allusion to Walpole. Geers married Sarah Lutwyche, third daughter of Thomas Lutwyche of Lutwyche Hall, Shropshire in April 1731 and, on his marriage, his uncle, Sir Thomas Cookes Winford, 2nd Baronet MP, gave him the estate of Glasshampton and Geers adopted the name of Winford. His uncle died without issue 19 January 1743, and the baronetcy became extinct. Geers did not stand at the 1734 British general election, but was returned in a contest for Hereford at the 1741 British general election, with his cousin, Edward Hopton. In about 1745 he became Town clerk of Worcester, retaining the post for the rest of his life. At the 1747 British general election he was returned in a contest for Worcester but was unseated on petition on 11 February 1748. . Geers succeeded his father in 1750 and died three years later on 23 May 1753 leaving two daughters, Sarah and Harriet. Harriet, the younger, was unmarried, but Sarah married Sambrooke Freeman of Fawley Court, Buckinghamshire. She died in 1805, her heir being Sir John Geers Cottrell, Bt son of Sir John Cottrell, Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1761, and of Anne Geers, only daughter of John Geers of Garnons, Herefordshire. ==References== Category:1690s births Category:1751 deaths Category:Members of the Parliament of Great Britain for English constituencies Category:British MPs 1727\u20131734 Category:British MPs 1741\u20131747 Category:British MPs 1747\u20131754 ",
