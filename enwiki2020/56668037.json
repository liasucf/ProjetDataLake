    "text": "Pellenes nigrociliatus is a jumping spider species in the genus Pellenes. ==Taxonomy== Originally allocated to the genus Attus, the species was first identified by Eug\u00e8ne Simon in 1875 and published in a paper by Carl Ludwig Koch. It was given its current name in 1876. ==Description== The spider is generally black with broad white stripes across the opisthosoma. The female is larger at between long, compared to the male that is between long. ==Distribution== The species has been found in an area that pans from the Canary Islands, through Turkey and Israel, across the Caucasus and Russia, to Central Asia and as far as China. The species is endemic across Europe, and has been identified in surveys across a wide range of countries including France, the Czech Republic and Poland. ==Synonyms== In 1999, the species Pellenes tauricus (Thorelli, 1875) was moved from being a synonym with Pellenes simoni to be a junior synonym with Pellenes nigrociliatus. According to the World Spider Catalog, the species has also been described by the following species names: * Attus bedeli Simon, 1875 * Attus nigrociliatus Simon, 1875 * Attus tauricus Thorell, 1875 (later moved to Pellenes) * Calliethera unispina Franganillo, 1910 * Pellenes bedeli Simon, 1876 * Pellenes bilunulatus Simon, 1877 * Pellenes brassayi Herman, 1879 * Pellenes nigrociliatus bilunulatus Simon, 1937 ==Habits== The species nests and overwinters in snail shells, such as Xerolenta obvia, that they suspend from trees. The shells, which may weigh five or more times as much as the spider, are used to shelter from attacks by ants. ==References== Category:Arthropods of China Category:Arthropods of Israel Category:Arthropods of Russia Category:Arthropods of Turkey Category:Invertebrates of the Canary Islands Category:Jumping spiders of Europe Category:Salticidae Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Taxa named by Eug\u00e8ne Simon Category:Spiders described in 1875 ",
