    "text": "Academia Ca\u0163avencu (, \"The Ca\u0163avencu Academy\") is a Romanian satirical magazine founded in 1991 and made famous by its investigative journalism. Academia Ca\u0163avencu also owns Radio Guerrilla , an FM radio station with national coverage ; Tabu, a women's magazine, Superbebe, a magazine for new parents, Aventuri la pescuit, a magazine for fishermen, 24-FUN, a free magazine for teenagers, and Cotidianul, a daily newspaper. In a surprise move, on May 29, 2006, Academia Ca\u0163avencu press group announced it was being acquired by Realitatea Media, owners of Realitatea TV, and controlled by controversial and elusive businessman Sorin Ovidiu V\u00e2ntu. V\u00e2ntu himself has often been a target of enquiries by Ca\u0163avencu journalists. ==Name== Nae Ca\u0163avencu is a character in Ion Luca Caragiale's 1883 comedy O scrisoare pierdut\u0103 (\"A Lost Letter\"). An unscrupulous, demagogue politician, Ca\u0163avencu uses his newspaper R\u0103cnetul Carpa\u0163ilor (\"The Yell of the Carpathians\") to blackmail politicians of the opposing party with a compromising love letter that he finds. ==History== In its current form, Academia Ca\u0163avencu was founded in 1991, by a team of humourists, investigators, and literates headed by poet and former dissident Mircea Dinescu. Part of the team had previously edited two short-lived satirical papers, Ca\u0163avencu Incomod and Ca\u0163avencu Interna\u0163ional. Dinescu was editor-in-chief until 1998, when he resigned and went on to create his own publications, Aspirina s\u0103racului (\"The poor man's aspirin\" - a joking reference to sexual intercourse), and Plai cu boi (Land of the Dumb), a monthly satirical magazine parodying the style of Playboy. ==Current activities== Ca\u0163avencu Interna\u0163ional, 1990 Academia Ca\u0163avencu have been long-time press freedom advocates. They maintain a \"press monitoring agency\", a watchdog against manipulation through mass-media. During the 2004 election campaign, Academia Ca\u0163avencu published as supplements two parody issues of Sc\u00e2nteia (the old-time Romanian Communist Party newspaper), containing reprints of articles written by important current day politicians during the Communist era. Almost 40,000 copies were bought in bulk from newsagents, along with other newspapers . The alleged perpetrators were representatives of the then-governing Social Democratic Party (PSD), whose (mostly former Communist) high members (including founder and former President of Romania Ion Iliescu) were protagonists of the Ca\u0163avencu special issues. Apart from political issues, Academia Ca\u0163avencu organises and/or sponsors a number of cultural and environmental initiatives: * Save the Danube Delta * Save Vama Veche * Cu papucii prin de\u015fert (\"Across the Desert in slippers\", a reference to the Dacia car hatchback model) - a humanitarian expedition through the Sahara and down to Senegal They also develop their own stereotypes and nicknames of the politicians, such as: * Ion Iliescu \"Nelu Cotrocelu\" or \"Bunicu\u0163a\" (\"The Granny\") - associated with the Cotroceni Palace owl * Adrian N\u0103stase \"Bombonel\" (\"Candy Boy\") - in reference to his alleged homosexuality * Traian B\u0103sescu \"Popeye Marinarul\" (\"Popeye the Sailor\") - due to B\u0103sescu's former job as a commercial navy captain * Theodor Stolojan \"The robot\", \"Robocop\" or \"Frankie\" - due to his voice and comic resemblance to the classic image of Frankenstein's monster * Petre Roman - suggests that he is rather popular among the female workers of the APACA textile factory in Bucharest (whom they reported shouting once: Nu vrem bani! Nu vrem valut\u0103! Vrem pe Roman s\u0103 ne fut\u0103! (\"We don't want money! We don't want hard currency! We want Roman to fuck us!\"). * Gheorghe Dumitra\u015fcu - suggests that he washes infrequently * Nicolae V\u0103c\u0103roiu \"Votc\u0103roiu\" - allegedly heavy drinker of \"S\u0103niu\u0163a\", a low- grade brand of vodka (votc\u0103) * \u015eerban Mih\u0103ilescu \"Miki \u015epag\u0103\" (\"Mickey Bribe\") - corruption allegations * Marian Vanghelie - he has poor grammatical skills, as coined by Vanghelie's frequent and indiscriminate use of Care este (\"Which is\"), as a predicate for singular and plural subjects alike. ==See also== * Le Canard encha\u00een\u00e9, a French counterpart * The Clinic, a Chilean counterpart * Frank, a Canadian counterpart * El Jueves, a Spanish counterpart * Moskovskaya Komsomolka, a Russian counterpart * NJUZ, a Serbian counterpart * Noseweek, a South African counterpart * The Onion, a US counterpart * Private Eye, a British counterpart * The Phoenix, an Irish counterpart * Titanic, a German counterpart ==See also== * List of magazines in Romania ==References== ==External links== * Academia Ca\u0163avencu Category:1991 establishments in Romania Category:Satirical magazines published in Romania Category:Magazines established in 1991 Category:Mass media in Bucharest Category:Romanian- language magazines Category:Political magazines published in Romania Category:Weekly magazines published in Romania ",
