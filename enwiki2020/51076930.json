On the morning of March 11, the Halifax steam trawler Lemberg discovered two dories approximately 160 kilometers (86 nautical miles) southeast of Halifax. Both dories were damaged and full of water. The body of John R. Ellison, a mate of Jutland, was discovered aboard one of the dories. The bodies of the 20 other crew members were never found. Various theories on what happened to Jutland have been examined, from an explosion to a collision. ==References== Category:Maritime history of Canada Category:Fishing vessels Category:Shipwrecks of the Nova Scotia coast Category:Shipwrecks in the Atlantic Ocean Category:Maritime incidents in 1920 Category:Missing ships Category:Ships lost with all hands Category:1918 ships ",
