The official 1918 football season was cancelled due to S.A.T.C. rules during World War I and the 1918 flu pandemic. However, a scrub team played one game, a 41-6 victory over Traverse City High School on November 16, 1918. Charles Tambling, who coached the team from 1902 to 1905, returned as head coach in 1918. ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Date !Opponent !Location !Result |-bgcolor=#dfd |November 16||Traverse City High School||Mount Pleasant, MI||W 41\u20136 |} ==References== Central Michigan Category:Central Michigan Chippewas football seasons Central Michigan Normalites football ",
