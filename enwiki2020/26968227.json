    "text": "Tapae was a fortified settlement, guarding Sarmizegetusa, the main political centre of Dacia. Its location was on the Iron Gates of Transylvania, a natural passage breaking between \u021aarcului and Poiana Rusc\u0103 Mountains and connecting Banat to \u021aara Ha\u021begului. This made it one of the very few points through which invaders could enter Transylvania from the south. Moreover, 8 kilometres down the passage into \u021aara Ha\u021begului, there is Sarmizegetusa Regia. Dio Cassius notes the existence of a military camp thereCassius Dio, Roman History 68:8 during the Dacian Wars. The place is the site of four battles between Dacians and Romans. Nowadays there is a small village on this site named Zeicani, located within Sarmizegetusa commune. ==References== Category:Dacian fortresses in Romania ",
