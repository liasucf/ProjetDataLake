She currently serves Viking Line's Kapellsk\u00e4r\u2013Mariehamn route. ==Background== ===New vessels for SF Line=== The market for transporting passengers, cars and cargo trucks across the Baltic Sea between Finland and Sweden grew steadily during the 1960s and the early 1970s. During these years, two major carriers on these services emerged: Viking Line and Silja Line. By the time of the mid 1970s, the \u00c5landian based shipping company SF Line operated three ships as a part of Viking Line. Although not more than ten years old, these ships was already beginning to be too small and held too few passenger cabins to meet the growing demand from passengers. In response to this, as well as the newbuilings recently added to the Silja Line fleet, SF Line decided to order two new and bigger ships. These ships would later be known as the MS Turella and the Rosella. ===Ordering=== The lowest bid for building the two new vessels came from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. In order to save job opportunities in Finland, the Finnish state subsidised the construction of the new ships with 17 million Finnish markka. Fakta om Fartyg: MS Turella (1979), retrieved 26. 9. 2007 Fakta om Fartyg: MS Rosella (1980), retrieved 26 September 2007 Thus, the order for the ships eventually went to W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 and both ships were to be built at their shipyard in Turku, Finland. ===Design=== SF Line's latest newbuilding was the Aurella, delivered to the company in 1973. The Aurella was of a new breed of ferries crossing the Baltic, she had two decks of public spaces along with two separate car decks. Inspired by the success of the Aurella, the newbuildings' design resembled her closely although more cabins and larger public spaces were added. ===Naming=== SF Line's earlier ships were all named with the suffix -ella with the prefix taken from names of the regions where the ships sailed. Thus the had her name taken from the port of Kapellsk\u00e4r, the 's from Mariehamn and the 's from the Aura River in Turku. In this manner, the first of the newly built ships was named the Turella, the name deriving from the city of Turku. The second ship got her name, Rosella, from the region of Roslagen (the coastal areas north of Stockholm). ===Building and Delivery=== The Turella was put into Viking Line traffic between Turku and Stockholm on June 15, 1979. The Rosella was laid down on April 27, 1979 and was launched on August 14, 1979. Nine months later, on April 25, 1980, the Rosella was delivered to SF Line. Due to a seaman's strike in Finland, the Rosella wasn't put into service until May 23 when she started sailing on the Naantali-Kapellsk\u00e4r route. ==Service history== During her entire career, the Rosella has been a part of the fleet of Viking Line. She has served on the longest time and on more routes than any other Viking Line ship. === Naantali\u2013Mariehamn\u2013Kapellsk\u00e4r (1980\u20131981) === When delivered, the Rosella was put in service on Viking Line's route between Naantali and Kapellsk\u00e4r together with her sister Turella and SF-Line's Aurella. === Turku\u2013Mariehamn\u2013Stockholm (1981\u20131988) === After one year of service, Rosella was transferred to the Turku\u2013Stockholm route, switching routes with Slite's Diana II. The Rosella continued on this route until the delivery of the Amorella on October 14, 1988. === Naantali\u2013Mariehamn\u2013Kapellsk\u00e4r (1988\u20131993) === In 1987 SF Line made an agreement with Stena Line to sell the Rosella to them once the Amorella was delivered in March 1988. However, the Amorellas delivery was delayed by seven months, meaning the Rosella could not be delivered to Stena in time for the summer season 1988, and SF Line had to pay them compensations. In the end Stena and SF Line reached an agreement where the Turella, which was in better condition and easier to convert for the traffic Stena planned her for, was sold instead of Rosella.

After construction of additional cabins in place of the cardeck on deck 4, Rosella returned to the Turku\u2013Mariehamn\u2013Stockholm route in January 1994. During the summer seasons of 1995 and 1996 replaced Rosella on the Turku route, Fakta om Fartyg: MS Cinderella (1989), retrieved 26. 9. 2007 freeing her to operate car-passenger friendly Naantali route during the high season. === Stockholm\u2013Mariehamn cruises (1997\u20132003) === When Viking acquired in 1997, Fakta om Fartyg: MS Frans Suell (1992), retrieved 26. 9. 2007 the Rosella was replaced on the Turku\u2013Stockholm service by . Fakta om Fartyg: MS Isabella (1989), retrieved 26. 9. 2007 In the new situation the Rosella started making 24 (later 20/22) hour cruises from Stockholm to Mariehamn under the marketing name Dancing Queen during the winter season, but still returned to the Naantali\u2013Mariehamn\u2013Kapellsk\u00e4r route for the summer months. In 1999 the summer route's eastern terminus was changed to Turku, allowing Viking to give up the terminal at Naantali completely. === Helsinki\u2013Tallinn (2003\u20132008) === Fearing losses after the termination of tax- free sales between Finland and Estonia after Estonia joined the EU in 2004, Viking Line decided to swap the routes of Rosella and Cinderella in autumn 2003. Rosella began a ferry-service between Helsinki and Tallinn with two daily departures from both ports, while the Cinderella (now renamed Viking Cinderella) took over Rosellas Stockholm\u2013Mariehamn cruise itinerary. Due to high prices the Rosellas new route was extremely unpopular during the first year and the company strongly considered selling the ship. However, after prices were lowered the ship's popularity increased, to the extent that in 2006 Viking Line decided to order a new fast ferry for the Helsinki-Tallinn route, the .Viking Line press release: Viking XPRS \u2013 a new concept on the Helsinki\u2013Tallinn route , retrieved 26. 9. 2007 The Viking XPRS replaced Rosella on the route on April 28, 2008. === Kapellsk\u00e4r\u2013Mariehamn (2008 onwards) === On 30 May 2008, the Rosella replaced the \u00c5landsf\u00e4rjan on the Kapellsk\u00e4r\u2013Mariehamn route. She was supposed to be a temporary ship and then replaced by the newbuilding Viking ADCC in 2010. However, when the building project was cancelled due to big delays at the shipyard Rosella became the permanent ship to sail on the route. In early 2011 MS Rosella underwent a major refurbishment where the public areas were extensively rebuilt and enlarged. In February 2013, Viking Line announced that Rosella will be re- flagged to Finland. ==References== ==External links== * Viking Line official website for MS Rosella Category:Ferries of Finland Category:Ferries of Sweden Category:Cruiseferries Category:Ships built in Turku Category:1979 ships ",
