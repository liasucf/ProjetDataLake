    "text": "Dream of Light (, lit. \"The Sun of the Quince\"), also known as The Quince Tree Sun, is a 1992 Spanish narrative/documentary film directed by Victor Erice. The film centers on Spanish painter Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda and his attempt to paint the eponymous quince tree. L\u00f3pez struggles to capture a perfect, fleeting moment of beauty on canvas, and the film meticulously chronicles his work. ==Synopsis== The film begins by showing Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda as a very meticulous painter. He drives in pegs to mark his stance, hangs a weight and uses strings to determine the symmetry and center of his painting. His first attempt starts out peacefully but he soon encounters problems due to the weather and the size of his canvas. As L\u00f3pez and a friend discuss Michelangelo's The Last Judgement, painted when Michelangelo was in his 60s, which L\u00f3pez is fast approaching, the film's subject takes shape as the relationship between the artist's work and his own mortality. L\u00f3pez's future attempts are much more rushed and frantic as he struggles to compete with the weather, the fleeting sun and the rotting and weighed down fruit in maintaining his vision. ==Participants== *Antonio L\u00f3pez Garc\u00eda *Marina Moreno *Enrique Gran *Mar\u00eda L\u00f3pez *Carmen L\u00f3pez *Elisa Ruiz *Jos\u00e9 Carretero *Amalia Aria *Lucio Mu\u00f1oz *Esperanza Parada *Julio L\u00f3pez Hern\u00e1ndez *Fan Xiao Ming *Yan Sheng Dong *Janusz Pietrzkiak *Marek Domagala ==Reception== Janet Maslin wrote that \"the purity and breadth of this meticulous study are all the more gratifying in view of its unprepossessing style.\" ==Awards== At the 1992 Cannes Film Festival the film won the Jury Prize and the FIPRESCI Prize. ==References== == External links == * * Category:1992 films Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish-language films Category:Spanish documentary films Category:Films directed by V\u00edctor Erice Category:1990s documentary films Category:Documentary films about visual artists ",
