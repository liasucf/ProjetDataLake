Hakata's economy was significantly transformed in 1996 with the opening of Canal City Hakata, an award-winning destination shopping and entertainment center. ===Cruise ship tourism=== From the early 2010s Hakata became the beneficiary of significant growth in cruise ship tourism; particularly with visitors from China. In 2014, 91 cruise ships travelled from China called at Hakata. In 2015, 245 cruise ship calls were made at Hakata Port. After expansion and redevelopment of the port facilities, the number of cruise ship port calls in 2016 is expected to exceed 400. As of 2015, the largest passenger vessel making regular port calls at Hakata is the Royal Caribbean International owned MS Quantum of the Seas. Partly as a result of growing international tourism, in 2015 Fukuoka reported the fastest rising tax revenues and population in Japan. == History == Hakata is one of the oldest cities in Japan. In the Middle Ages Hakata, which faces onto the Genkai-Nada Channel (\u7384\u754c\u7058) dividing Japan from Korea, was a base for merchants who traded with China and Korea, and the city housed Japan's first Chinatown. Taira no Kiyomori is said to have built the artificial harbor Sode-no-minato (\u8896\u306e\u6e4a) to increase commerce. Hakata was burned down by many wars, including the Mongol invasions. Fukuoka and Hakata, c.1640 In the early Edo period, Kuroda Nagamasa, appointed the lord of Chikuzen Province, and most of his samurai vassals lived in Fukusaki, on the opposite shore of the Naka River from Hakata. Kuroda Nagamasa changed the name of the area to Fukuoka after his home town; Fukuoka in Okayama Prefecture. He ordered Tachibana Castle and Najima Castle dismantled, and had Fukuoka Castle built using the stones from those older castles. At that time Hakata was no larger than one square kilometer, demarcated by defensive lines along the Naka River, the Boshu-bori (or Boshu Canal), and the Ishido or Mikasa River. In 1876, Hakata, then also known as Dai-Ni-Dai-ku, and Fukuoka, or Dai-Ichi-Dai- ku, were merged. In 1878 the settlement was renamed Fukuoka-ku (\u798f\u5ca1\u533a) by the Fukuoka prefectural government, though the population of Hakata was 25,677 and that of Fukuoka was 20,410. At that time, the name Hakata vanished from the administration. In 1889, after a local referendum in which half the voters chose the name Fukuoka and half chose Hakata, the city was officially renamed Fukuoka-shi, but at the same time a new train station then being built was named Hakata Station. An imperial decree issued in July 1899 established Hakata as an open port for trade with the United States and the United Kingdom.US Department of State. (1906). A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759. In 1972, when Fukuoka City was granted designated status by government ordinance, a ward including the old Hakata area was given the name Hakata-ku. In 2016 a large sinkhole appeared in the city center just west of Hakata station.Large sinkhole opens up near Hakata Station The sinkhole was filled and the affected roads were completely repaired within a few days, in what some called a testament to Japanese ingenuity. However, the hasty repair seems to have been problematic as less than a month later the road began showing signs of imminent implosion.Japan's giant sinkhole is sinking again == Culture == Hakata ningy\u014d Hakata Dontaku. Hakata was the traditional center for the manufacture of Hakata ningy\u014d, which are traditional Japanese dolls that are famous throughout Japan. Today, almost all Hakata ningy\u014d makers (Hakata ningy\u014d shi) have their factories out of the Old Hakata Area, a part of modern Hakata-ku. Hakata-ori is a textile used for obis of kimonos. It is also the home of Mentai Rock, named after the popular mentaiko dish served in the region, that spawned numerous J-pop idols during the early 1980s. Neo Mentai Rock is the name given to a recent renewal in activity from local musicians. Hakata-ben is the local Japanese dialect spoken in the Old Hakata Area. Hakata is also the location of the pop group HKT48. Anouther popular groups from Hakata are Kanikapila and NUMBER GIRL. Parts of the famous crime novel 'Points and lines' ('Ten to Sen' in Japanese) by the award-winning Japanese writer Seich\u014d Matsumoto occur in Hakata and its train station. === Famous foods === * Mentaiko * Tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen, also called simply Hakata ramen * Motsunabe * Japanese cheesecake * Mizutaki - Nabemono of chicken * Hakata Torimon (:ja:\u535a\u591a\u901a\u308a\u3082\u3093) - a type of cake * Hakata no Hito - a type of cake Food Yatai in Nakasu area *Tsukemen (dipping noodles) === Festivals === *Hakata Dontaku Minato Matsuri - May 3 and 4 *Hakata Gion Yamakasa - from July 1 to 15 *Hakata O-kunchi - October 23 and 24 (prior to 1953, November 23) == Transportation == === Rail === *JR West **Sany\u014d Shinkansen ***Hakata Station *JR Ky\u016bsh\u016b **Ky\u016bsh\u016b Shinkansen ***Hakata Station **Kagoshima Main Line ***Yoshizuka Station - Hakata Station - Takeshita Station - Minami-Fukuoka Station **Sasaguri Line ***Yoshizuka Station *Nishi-Nippon Railroad **Tenjin \u014cmuta Line ***Zasshonokuma Station *Fukuoka City Subway **K\u016bk\u014d Line ***Nakasu-Kawabata Station - Gion Station - Hakata Station - Higashi-Hie Station - Fukuokak\u016bk\u014d Station(Fukuoka Airport) **Hakozaki Line ***Nakasu-Kawabata Station - Gofukumachi Station - Chiyo- Kench\u014dguchi Station === Bus === *Hakata bus terminus (see Nishitetsu) === Airport === *Fukuoka Airport === Harbor === *Bayside place Hakata Futoh (Hakata Pier) *Ch\u016b\u014d Wharf (Central Wharf) - international ferry Beetle and Kobee and New Camellia == Facilities == === Commerce === *Canal City Hakata **Grand Hyatt Fukuoka *Hakata Riverain **Hakata-za **Hotel \u014ckura Fukuoka === Culture === *Level-5 stadium (Hakata no mori Stadium) *Fukuoka Convention Center - Marine Messe Fukuoka, Fukuoka International Congress Center, Fukuoka Kokusai Center *Hakata Civic Center, Hakata Library *Hakata South Library *Nakasu *Rakusui-en === Religion === *Shinto **Kushida Shrine **Sumiyoshi Shrine **T\u014dka Ebisu Shrine *Buddhism **Sh\u014dfuku Temple **T\u014dch\u014d Temple **J\u014dten Temple **S\u014dfuku Temple *Christianity **Fukuoka Korean Christian Church, Chiyo **Hakata New Life Church, **Hikarigaoka (Hill of light) Catholic Church **Minoshima Catholic Pastoral Center. **Japan Evangelical Lutheran church, Sasaki machi **Japan Baptist Church, Aoki ** North Kyushu Japanese Orthodox Church, Higashi-hirao ==Culture== The South Korean government maintains the Korea Education Institution (; ) in Hakata-ku. ==References== ==External links== Category:Wards of Fukuoka ",
