    "text": "King is the second studio album by American alternative rock band Belly, released on February 13, 1995. Although the members had tightened their focus and polished their hook-laden songs, King and its singles did not meet label expectations in the grunge-friendly atmosphere of 1995, and the band broke up shortly after it was released. The album sold over 350,000 copies . In the two decades since Kings release, many (including some critics) have reconsidered the initial lukewarm attitude towards the album and now hold it as an equal to Belly's highly regarded debut Star. ==Reception== In 2012, King was listed at number seven on PopMatters \"Top 15 Overlooked Albums of the 1990s\" list. In 2016, the album was hailed by Will Sheff of Okkervil River as \"a winning, confident, masterful collection of songs \u2013 poppy and sweet and with a low-key psychedelic undercurrent. Everything good about Star was still there and had been expanded upon, but in many ways this felt like a new, reinvented band.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !
