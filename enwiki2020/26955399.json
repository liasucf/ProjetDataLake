    "text": "is a south-western locality (Ortsteil) of Berlin in the district (Bezirk) of Charlottenburg-Wilmersdorf. Until 2001 it was part of the former district of Wilmersdorf. ==Geography== Schmargendorf borders with the localities of Grunewald (with Grunewald Forest) in the west, Halensee in the north, Wilmersdorf in the north and east, as well as Dahlem (this one in Steglitz- Zehlendorf borough) in the south. The northeastern border with Berlin's inner city is marked by the Ringbahn line of the Berlin S-Bahn and the Stadtring motorway. ==History== Village church The village in the Margraviate of Brandenburg was first mentioned as des or \u2019s Margreven Dorp (literally ) in 1354, contracted to Low German Smargendorp and later adapted to High German standard as Schmargendorf.One can find a comparable name construction with an abbreviated \u2019s with 's-Hertogenbosch in the Netherlands, being one of the areas from where many then settlers in Brandenburg originated. It was probably established about 1220 by German settlers in the course of the Ostsiedlung under the co-ruling Ascanian Margraves John I and Otto III of Brandenburg, after the former Slavic territories had been conquered by their great- grandfather Albert the Bear. During the growth of the City of Berlin after the 1871 unification of Germany, many peasants profited by the real estate speculation, when Schmargendorf on the eastern rim of the Grunewald forest became a popular residential area. In 1899 the former village was separated from neighbouring Wilmersdorf and received municipal rights within the Brandenburgian Landkreis Teltow, whereafter the residents had the lavish Neo- Gothic town hall erected in 1902. On 1 October 1920 Schmargendorf was incorporated into Berlin by the \"Greater Berlin Act\".
