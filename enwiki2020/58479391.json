However, her wiper used rollers rather than blades and did not catch on. She was also the mother of silent screen star Florence Lawrence who followed her mother in inventing automotive accessories. === Patents === * In October 1917, Charlotte received a patent for the first automatic windshield cleaner. ==References== Category:1861 births Category:1929 deaths Category:20th-century American inventors Category:Women inventors Category:People from Hamilton, Ontario ",
