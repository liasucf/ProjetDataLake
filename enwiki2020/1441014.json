    "text": "View of Fajana de Franceses, in the island of La Palma, Spain. A faj\u00e3 () is a Portuguese-language term of obscure origin designating supratidal talus- platform geology constructed from landslides or lava flows, that are relatively common coastal features, occurring on the toe of cliffs.G. Lameiras et al. (2009), p.827 Although they exist throughout the world, they are distinct features of the islands of the Azores and Madeira, as well as of the Canary Islands, where the equivalent term in Spanish is fajana. The term also designates a flat land of small extension, generally located by the sea and cultivable, formed of materials detached from the cliffs. ==Geology== The detritic platform of Caldeira de Santo Cristo, with its emblematic lagoon Calheta Faj\u00e3s are created from collapsing cliffs or lava flows and are identifiable along the coast as \"flat\" surfaces (relative to the other geology). Tides and tidal currents are minor influencers of the coastal morphology, and therefore, sedimentation and deposits became permanent. Composed of fertile soils, these microclimates allow the cultivation of a variety of staple and exotic plants, such as coffee. ===Azores=== These debris fields exist in all the archipelago of the Azores, but are concentrated on the island of S\u00e3o Jorge . The island is volcanic in character with steep cliffs running down to the coast, and where faj\u00e3s extend into the sea caused by the collapse of these cliffs. The long fetch of the Azores is a high-energy wave climate, and the steep submarine slopes and absence of shallow shelves produce localized patterns of wave shoaling, refraction and diffraction: especially during storms. This leads to the fragmentation of the coast into a number of dynamic cells whose sediment alongshore is limited by impermeable boundaries. There are faj\u00e3s on both sides of the island: along the southern coast are the notable faj\u00e3s of Velas, Vimes, Bodes, Al\u00e9m, S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Cardoso and Alaba\u00e7al, while in the north there are a succession of smaller faj\u00e3s (resulting from the collapse of lands cut by small ravines). The exception to this are the Faj\u00e3s of Caldeira do Santo Cristo (with an underwater cave and an open lagoon); the Faj\u00e3 dos Cubres (with closed lagoon ecosystem) crystalline lake; the Faj\u00e3 do Ouvidor, a dendritic faj\u00e3 extending into the sea, used by fishers. Although many of these faj\u00e3s have been abandoned, the settlements which include abandoned homes, mills and fountains continue to be iconic outposts on hiking trails. The faj\u00e3s are fertile and, historically, used in the cultivation of yams, maize and vegetables, although coffee, vineyards and tropical fruits were also grown. Here, several faj\u00e3s are scattered along the northern and southern coast, including the faj\u00e3s of Santo Cristo and Cubres, with their distinctive saltwater lagoons. One of the more original harvests happens at Faj\u00e3 of Caldeira do Santo Cristo, where the lagoon supports cockles: this makes Santo Cristo a popular destination for the unique gastronomic cuisine in the Azores. ==References== ;Notes ;Sources * * Category:Coastal and oceanic landforms Category:Portuguese words and phrases ",
