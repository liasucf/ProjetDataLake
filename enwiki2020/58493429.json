She deconstructed the traditional sources used for dating and sequence of Chrysostom's works, leading to a substantially revised chronology. This was followed up by a number of articles co-authored with Pauline Allen that challenged traditional notions of early Christian preaching. Sever J. Voicu, then scriptor graecus at the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana described the team of Allen and Mayer as a \"ciclone australiano\" (Australian cyclone)Voicu, Sever J.
