Currier Museum of Art, Manchester, New Hampshire Clement Meadmore (9 February 1929 \u2013 19 April 2005) was an Australian-American sculptor known for massive outdoor steel sculptures. ==Biography== Born Clement Lyon Meadmore in Melbourne, Australia, in 1929, Clement Meadmore studied aeronautical engineering and then industrial design at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. After graduating in 1949, Meadmore designed furniture for several years and, in the 1950s, created his first welded sculptures. He had several one-man exhibits of his sculptures in Melbourne and Sydney between 1954 and 1962. In 1963 Meadmore moved to New York City. Later, he became an American citizen. Meadmore used COR-TEN steel, aluminum, and occasionally bronze to create colossal outdoor sculptures which combine the elements of abstract expressionism and minimalism.Eric Gibson, The Sculpture of Clement Meadmore, Hudson Hills Press, 1994 He was an avid amateur drummer and jazz lover who held jam sessions in his home. His fondness for jazz is reflected in the names of several of his works including \"Riff\" (1996), \"Round Midnight\" (1996), \"Stormy Weather\" (1997), \"Night and Day\" (1979) and \"Perdido\" (1978). Meadmore's sculptures are held by museums, corporate headquarters, and schools internationally. His work has been exhibited in a number of galleries, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, the Columbus Gallery of Fine Art in Ohio, and the Davenport Municipal Art Gallery in Iowa. He authored How to Make Furniture Without Tools (Pantheon, 1975) () and The Modern Chair: Classic Designs by Thonet, Breuer, Le Corbusier, Eames and Others (Dover Publications; 1997) (). His work and career were catalogued in 1994 book, The Sculpture of Clement Meadmore by Eric Gibson (Hudson Hills Press; 1994) (). ==Death== Meadmore died at age 76 in Manhattan from complications of Parkinson's disease.\"Clement Meadmore, Sculptor in Metal, Is Dead at 76.\" The New York Times, 21 April 2005. ==Sculptures in public collections and public spaces== ===United States=== *California ** Bent, 1966, Newport Harbor Art Museum, Newport Beach ** Up Ended, 1969, University of California Art Museum, Santa Barbara *District of Columbia ** Riding High, 1977, Gallaudet College, Washington *Florida ** Trans, 1972, Performance Asset Management, West Palm Beach **Northbridge Center, West Palm Beach *Illinois ** Spiral, 1971, Nathan Manilow Sculpture Park, University Park *Iowa **Sophisticated Lady, 1977, Figge Art Museum, Davenport *Kentucky ** Fling, 1971, Speed Art Museum, Louisville *Kansas ** Always, 1992, Johnson County Community College, Overland Park *Louisiana ** Out of There, 1974, Hale Boggs Federal Building Plaza, New Orleans ** Flippant Flurry, 1977, Mrs. P.
