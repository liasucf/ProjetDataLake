    "text": "Steve Rodby (born December 9, 1954 in Joliet, Illinois) is an American jazz bassist and producer known for his time with the Pat Metheny Group. ==Biography== Rodby was born in Joliet, Illinois, into a musical family. His father was a music teacher who bought him an acoustic bass, electric bass, and amp when he was 12. He heard classical music from a young age and was educated in classical until high school when he learned jazz. During high school summers, he went to jazz camps, where he met Pat Metheny, Lyle Mays, and Danny Gottlieb, three of the four members of The Pat Metheny Group. Rodby played acoustic bass until he graduated from Northwestern University in 1977, when he taught himself how to play electric. He performed in the house band at the Jazz Showcase in Chicago, with local and visiting musicians such as Milt Jackson, Joe Henderson, and Art Farmer. He joined the Pat Metheny Group in 1981, starting on electric bass before spending most of his time on acoustic. He spent the next thirty years at Metheny's side, touring, recording, and producing, in Group projects and in Metheny's other projects. With Metheny he earned multiple Grammy awards and nominations, and admiration from critics, magazines, and reader polls. Rodby collaborated with Fred Simon and Paul McCandless on two albums: Since Forever and Remember the River. In 2011 he collaborated with Paul Wertico, a former drummer for the Metheny Group, and with Israeli musicians Danny Markovitch and Dani Rabin on Marbin's album Breaking the Cycle. ==Discography== With Ross Traut * Great Lawn (Columbia, 1987) * The Duo Life (Columbia, 1991) ==As sideman== With Pat Metheny Group * Offramp (ECM, 1982) \u2013 bassist * Travels (ECM, 1983) \u2013 bassist * First Circle (ECM, 1984) \u2013 bassist * The Falcon and the Snowman (EMI, 1985) \u2013 bassist, conductor * Still Life (Talking) (Geffen Records, 1987) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * Letter from Home (Geffen Records, 1989) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * The Road to You (Geffen Records, 1993) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * We Live Here (Geffen Records, 1995) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * Quartet (Geffen Records, 1996) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * Imaginary Day (Warner Bros, 1997) \u2013 bassist, co- producer * Speaking of Now (Warner Bros, 2002) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * The Way Up (Nonesuch, 2005) \u2013 bassist, co-producer With Pat Metheny * Secret Story (Geffen Records, 1992) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * A Map of the World (Warner Bros, 1999) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * Trio 99 \u2192 00 (Warner Bros, 2000) \u2013 co- producer * Trio \u2192 Live (Warner Bros, 2000) \u2013 co-producer * Day Trip (Nonesuch, 2008) \u2013 co-producer * Tokyo Day Trip (Nonesuch, 2008) \u2013 co-producer * Orchestrion (Nonesuch, 2010) \u2013 co-producer * Unity Band (Nonesuch, 2012) \u2013 co- producer * The Orchestrion Project (Nonesuch, 2013) \u2013 co-producer * KIN (\u2190\u2192) (Nonesuch, 2014) \u2013 co-producer * The Unity Sessions (Nonesuch, 2016) \u2013 co- producer * From This Place (Nonesuch, 2020) \u2212 co-producer With Simon & Bard Group * Musaic (Flying Fish, 1980) \u2013 bassist * Tear It Up (Flying Fish, 1982) \u2013 bassist * The Enormous Radio (Flying Fish, 1984) \u2013 bassist With Michael Brecker * Nearness of You: The Ballad Book (Verve Records, 2001) \u2013 co-producer * Pilgrimage (Heads Up, 2007) \u2013 co-producer With Eliane Elias * Dreamer (Bluebird, 2004) \u2013 co-producer * Something for You: Eliane Elias Sings & Plays Bill Evans (Blue Note, 2007) \u2013 co-producer * Bossa Nova Stories (Blue Note, 2009) \u2013 co-producer * Light My Fire (Concord Picante, 2011) \u2013 co-producer * I Thought About You (Concord Jazz, 2013) \u2013 co-producer * Made In Brazil (Concord Jazz, 2015) \u2013 co-producer, recorded * Dance of Time (Concord Jazz, 2017) \u2013 co- producer * Love Stories (Concord Jazz, 2019) \u2013 co-producer With Lyle Mays * Street Dreams (Geffen Records, 1988) \u2013 bassist, co-producer, conductor * Fictionary (Geffen Records, 1993) \u2013 co-producer * Solo (Improvisations For Expanded Piano) (Geffen Records, 2000) \u2013 co-producer With Pat Coil * Schemes And Dreams (Sheffield Lab, 1994) \u2013 bassist, co-producer * Gold (Sheffield Lab, 1996) \u2013 bassist With Fred Simon * Usually/Always (Windham Hill Records, 1988) - bassist, producer, editing * Open Book (Columbia, 1991) \u2013 bassist, co- producer * Remember the River by (Naim, 2004) \u2013 bassist * Since Forever (Naim, 2009) \u2013 bassist, producer, editing With Steve Cole * Spin (Narada Jazz, 2005) \u2013 bassist * True (Narada Jazz, 2005) - bassist With Paul McCandless * Heresay (Windham Hill Records, 1988) \u2013 bassist * Premonition (Windham Hill Records, 1992) \u2013 bassist, producer * Navigator (Landslide Records, 1994) \u2013 bassist With others * Madelaine, Who Is She...
