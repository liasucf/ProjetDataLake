Founded in 2011, the league currently consists of three female teams and one male team which compete against teams from other leagues. Namur Roller Girls is a member of the Women's Flat Track Derby Association (WFTDA). ==History== The Namur Roller Girls were founded in March 2011 by five friends. At first with the help of trainers from the Brussels Derby Pixies, the skaters learned the basics of roller derby before becoming gradually autonomous. The Namur Roller Girls played their first bout against the Dom City Dolls from Utrecht in September 2012. In January 2014, the Namur Roller Girls were accepted as member of the WFTDA Apprentice Program. Later that year, a second team, the Namur Roller Girls B, was founded. The league also launched a male team that year, the Namur Glorious Basterds. In the beginning of 2016, a third female team was established, the Namur Roller Girls C. The Namur Roller Girls graduated to full WFTDA membership in March 2017. ==References== Category:Namur (city) Category:Roller derby leagues established in 2011 Category:Roller derby leagues in Belgium Category:Sport in Namur (city) ",
