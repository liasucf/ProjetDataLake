    "text": "The Blasters is the second album by American rock and roll band The Blasters. Originally released in the United States by the independent label Slash Records, its later strong sales performance required a deal for wider distribution with Warner Bros. Records. The album was well-received, making Time magazine's list of \"top 10 albums\" for 1982 and peaking at number 36 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart. The album was issued in the United Kingdom via F-Beat Records. The British album featured different artwork from the American version, which depicts lead singer Phil Alvin in what was later described as \"the way he contorts his face between almost every verse in his trademark grinning-skull grimace.\" ==Critical reception== The album was critically well received. According to a 2002 PopMatters article, the national distribution of The Blasters was an eye-opener for listeners of \"rockabilly, country, blues, and New Orleans roadhouse R&B;,\" who found a band capable of producing new material that \"stood up well to the influences from whence they sprang\". Trouser Press declared that the album \"smokes\" and that the band's performance was \"tighter than a drum\". Rolling Stone praised the \"bright, raw playing, terrific taste and...full-bodied vocals\", while drawing special attention to the band's drummer, Bill Bateman, whose playing it indicated was \"[t]he real key to the Blaster's exuberant authenticity....\" ==Track listing== All songs composed by Dave Alvin, except where noted. #\"Marie Marie\" \u2013 2:07 #\"No Other Girl\" \u2013 2:29 #\"I'm Shakin'\" (Rudy Toombs) \u2013 2:22 #\"Border Radio\" \u2013 2:47 #\"American Music\" \u2013 2:10 #\"So Long Baby Goodbye\" \u2013 2:24 #\"Hollywood Bed\" \u2013 3:33 #\"Never No Mo' Blues\" (Elsie McWilliams, Jimmie Rodgers) \u2013 2:47 #\"This is It\" \u2013 2:15 #\"Highway 61\" (Albert Laundrew) \u2013 3:00 #\"I Love You So\" (Bo Diddley) \u2013 2:51 #\"Stop the Clock\" (Bob Ehret, Damon Robertson) \u2013 1:56 ==Personnel== ;The Blasters *Phil Alvin \u2013 guitar, harmonica, vocals *Dave Alvin \u2013 lead guitar *John Bazz \u2013 bass *Bill Bateman \u2013 drums *Gene Taylor \u2013 piano ;Additional musicians *Lee Allen \u2013 tenor saxophone *Steve Berlin \u2013 baritone sax ;Technical *The Blasters \u2013 production *Roger Harris \u2013 associate production *Art Fein \u2013 associate production *Roger Harris \u2013 engineering *Pat Burnette \u2013 engineering *David Ahlert \u2013 engineering (second engineer) *Gustav Alsina \u2013 cover design *Steve Bartel \u2013 art direction ==References== Category:The Blasters albums Category:1981 albums Category:Slash Records albums Category:F-Beat Records albums ",
