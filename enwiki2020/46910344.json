The four scenes are vividly characterized and the instruments are used to great effect. The opening movement L'\u00c9toile (The Star) begins with a mysterious duet for flute and bassoonChicago Chamber Musicians, Program notes by Dr. Richard E. Rodda, October 2007.

In Les Mages, the bassoon and the flute echo the Magi's efforts during their journey, with a melody that displays a characteristic augmented interval (E-flat to F-sharp). The goal of their pilgrimage is the subject of the next movement, La Vierge et l'enfant. It is extremely simple, based entirely on the C natural-minor scale. The harmony consists only of three chords: Cm, Fm and Gm and calls to mind a peaceful lullaby. The final movement Entr\u00e9e et danse des bergers (Entrance and Dance of the Shepherds) is more rhythmically complex and changes meter several times. It ends unexpectedly on an E major chord with added sixth. ==Movements== # L'\u00c9toile # Les Mages # La Vierge et L'Enfant # Entr\u00e9e et Danse des Bergers ==Selected Discography== *Castagner, Faisandier, Laskine, 2005, Recorded in 1956, Accord 2CD 4767783. *Trio Nordmann, 1972, Erato STU-70-706. *The Britten-Pears Ensemble, 1995, ASV CD DCA-918. *Wiesler-Davidsson-Goodman, 1996, Bis Records CD 739. *Ensemble Arpeggio, 2004, ASV QS 6252. ==References== Category:Compositions by Andr\u00e9 Jolivet Category:Chamber music compositions Category:Compositions for flute Category:Compositions for bassoon Category:Compositions for harp Category:1943 compositions ",
