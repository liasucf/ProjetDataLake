She exhibited work in venues in the United States, Canada, and Australia. She taught sculpture and crafts in a number of institutions, and designed stained glass windows, furniture, and jewelry, in addition to working as a sculptor. Collections which include examples of her work include the Charlottetown National Craft Collection and the National Collection of the Canadian Craftsmen Guild in Toronto. On 25 June 1951, Aarons was invited to attend a meeting of the City of Sydney's Health and Recreations Committee to discuss her submission to erect a piece of sculpture in the children's playground of Phillip Park. The Council approved the submission on 2 October 1951. The sculpture was removed on 2 April 1952. In 1965 she became a critic for the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada's Journal RAIC, writing a column titled \"Allied Arts\" about the role of craft in architecture. In 1983, she was awarded the Diplome d'Honneur from the Canadian Conference of the Arts. Aarons returned to Australia at the end of her life and settled in Brisbane, where she died on 3 January 2000. ==References== Category:1912 births Category:2000 deaths Category:20th-century Australian sculptors Category:20th-century Canadian sculptors Category:Canadian women sculptors Category:Artists from Sydney Category:20th-century Australian women artists Category:20th-century Canadian women artists Category:Australian emigrants to Canada Category:National Art School alumni Category:Columbia University School of the Arts alumni Category:Australian designers Category:Canadian designers Category:Australian stained glass artists and manufacturers Category:Canadian stained glass artists and manufacturers Category:Australian jewellers Category:Canadian jewellery designers ",
