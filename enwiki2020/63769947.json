    "text": "Railway operations were originally established by the United States Army to provide support to France and Great Britain after the United States entered World War I. The Army organized and deployed different types of railway regiments and battalions. As operations progressed, the railway units were used to support the American Expeditionary Forces as well. U.S. rail regiments moved both troops and supplies for the AEF and for the allies from the seaports to the front. ==Organization== Organization began with a survey group established by Secretary of War Newton D. Baker and railway executive Samuel Morse Felton Jr. This group, led by William Barclay Parsons, examined docks and rail traffic and recommended a solution for the United States. After Parsons' group observed that the France's ports were inadequate, its rail system was carrying all the traffic it could bear, and its canals were blocked, it requested that engineers be sent to France. The Army sent nine railway regiments, all filled with volunteers from U. S. railways, as follows: five construction regiments, three operations regiments, and one shop regiment. Railway regiments typically consisted of two battalions of three companies each. ==Railway units== ===First deployments=== * 11th Engineer Regiment (Railway) (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Fort Totten, New York in June 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Mills, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Upton, New York in April 1919. * 12th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway operation), organized at St. Louis, Missouri in May 1918, moved to Camp Gaillard, Missouri in June 1917 and to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Upton, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Funston, Kansas in May 1919 * 13th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway operation), organized at Chicago, Illinois in July 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops until April 1919, moved to Camp Mills, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Grant, Illinois in May 1919. * 14th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway operation), organized at Camp Rockingham, New Hampshire in June 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as Army troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Devens, Massachusetts in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Devens in May 1919. * 15th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Oakmont, Pennsylvania in May 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in July 1917, overseas as Army troops from July 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Upton, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Sherman, Ohio in May 1919. * 16th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Detroit, Michigan in May 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in August 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from August 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Upton, New York in April 1919, demobilized at Camp Custer, Michigan in May 1919. * 17th Engineer Regiment (standard gauge railway construction), organized at Atlanta, Georgia in July 1917, moved to the port of embarkation, Hoboken, New Jersey in August 1917, overseas as S.O.S. troops from August 1917 to April 1919, moved to Camp Merritt.

Standard gauge in the United States was . The difference between the two in tenths of an inch was negligible and the wheels of U.S. locomotives and rolling stock did not have to be modified to be used. ===Locomotives and Rolling stock=== leftAmerican rail equipment was larger than that of the French. The countries agreed that the size of U.S. locomotives used in France would have a traction force limited only by the clearances and load-bearing capacity of French railways and that cars would match the capacity of the locomotives. After two test runs proved the feasibility of air brakes, the French agreed to allow American cars to be equipped with those brakes, which the French rolling stock was not. Instead of American knuckle couplers, U.S. trains would be equipped with couplers and buffers used in France. American trains were limited to a length of ; the limit was imposed by the length of French passing sidings. The standard American locomotive in use was the 2-8-0 Consolidation type. More than 1600 of the Consolidation locomotives were assembled in France by U.S. mechanics; most were allocated to the AEF. Almost twenty thousand American- made railway cars were received in France during the war and after the armistice. Car types included box cars, flat cars, gondola cars (high and low sided), tank cars, refrigerator cars, ballast cas and dump cars. ===Facilities=== *Railroad Repair Shops, Nevers, France ===Routes=== The American Expeditionary Forces were authorized to run their own trains operated by American crews on French rails from the ports to the advance section. ==References== ==External links== * WW1 US Military Railroads in Europe World War One Trains (YouTube) * Technology's War Record: An Interpretation of the Contribution Made by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, its staff, its former students and its undergraduates to the cause of the United States and the allied powers in the Great War, 1914-1919 * Pennsylvania ; a record of the University's men in the Great War : with the names of those who gave their lives, those who were wounded, those who were honoured, those who were prisoners ... * Railway Age and Railway Review, Volume 63 * Historical Report of the Chief Engineer: Including All Operations of the Engineer Department, American Expeditionary Forces, 1917-1919 * The Us Army In World War I: Orders Of Battle * Grand Divisions, Transportation Corps * The Pop Valve Category:1917 establishments in the United States Category:1919 disestablishments in France Category:Expeditionary units and formations Category:Military units and formations of the United States in World War I Category:Military history of the United States during World War I Category:Military units and formations established in 1917 Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1919 ",
