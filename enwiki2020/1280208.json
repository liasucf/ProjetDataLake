    "text": "Rawa Voivodeship () was a unit of administrative division and local government in the Kingdom of Poland since 15th century until the partitions of Poland in 1795. It was part of the Province of Greater Poland. Together with the Plock and Masovian Voivodeships it formed the former Duchy of Masovia. The voivodeship had its capital in the town of Rawa Mazowiecka, and its origins date back to the second half of the 15th century. In 1462, after the deaths of local Piast dynasty dukes, Mazovian lands of Rawa and Gostynin were incorporated into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. In 1476, the Land of Sochaczew returned to Poland as well. Borders of Rawa Voivodeship remained unchanged for more than 300 years, until the second partition of Poland in 1793, when it was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia. Rawa Voivodeship had four senators in the Senate of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. These were the Voivode of Rawa, the Castellan of Rawa, and the castellans of Sochaczew and Gostynin. Local starostas resided in Rawa, Sochaczew and Gostynin. Zygmunt Gloger in his monumental book Historical Geography of the Lands of Old Poland provides this description of Rawa Voivodeship: \u201cIn the 15th century, the Duchy of Mazovia, ruled by local branch of the Piast dynasty, was divided into three parts, one of which was the Duchy of Rawa (...) On January 1, 1462, Siemowit VI died at the age of eighteen. A few weeks later, his teenage brother Wladyslaw II also died. Siemowit VI was the Duke of Plock and Rawa, and after his death, King Kazimierz Jagiellonczyk decided to incorporate the Duchy of Rawa, making it the first part of Mazovia that returned to Poland (...) Rawa Voivodeship had the area of 92 sq. miles. It was divided into three lands: those of Rawa, Sochaczew and Gostynin. Each land was divided into two counties. The lands were of roughly the same size, and in the mid-16th century, whole voivodeship had 100 Roman Catholic parishes and 15 towns (...) Sejmiks took place at Rawa, Sochaczew and G\u0105bin, during which two deputies to the Sejm, and two deputies to the Greater Poland Tribunal were elected (...) Rawa Voivodeship shared its coat of arms with Plock Voivodeship\u201d. ==Municipal government== Voivodeship Governor (Wojewoda) seat: * Rawa Mazowiecka Counties of Rawa Voivodeship ==Administrative division== * Rawa Land (ziemia rawska, Rawa), ** Rawa County ** Bia\u0142a Rawska County, * Gostynin Land (ziemia gostyni\u0144ska, Gostynin), ** Gostynin County ** G\u0105bin County, * Sochaczew Land (ziema sochaczewska, Sochaczew), ** Sochaczew County ** Mszczon\u00f3w County. ==Voivodes== *Miko\u0142aj z Kutna 1465-1467 *Jan Grot z Nowego Miasta 1468-1489 *Andrzej Szczubio\u0142 1489-1493 *Jakub Buczacki 1493-1496 *Andrzej Kucie\u0144ski 1496-1504 *Piotr Pr\u0119dota z Trzciany 1504-1518 *Jakub Gostomski 1518-1519 *Andrzej Kucie\u0144ski 1519-1529 *Stanis\u0142aw Kucie\u0144ski 1529-1542 *Andrzej Sierpski 1542-? *Anzelm Gostomski 1572-1588 *Stanis\u0142aw Gostomski 1588-? *Wojciech Wilkanowski ? *Piotr Myszkowski 1597-1601 *Zygmunt Grudzi\u0144ski 1601-1618 *Stanis\u0142aw Radziejowski 1618-1627 *Filip Wo\u0142ucki 1627-1642 *Krzysztof Marcin Su\u0142owski 1642-1644 *Andrzej Grudzi\u0144ski 1644-1650 *\u0141ukasz Opali\u0144ski 1653-1654 *Aleksander Koryci\u0144ski 1659-? *Jan Wojciech Lipski 1676 *Hieronim Olszowski 1676 *Aleksander Za\u0142uski 1676-1692 *Aleksander J\u00f3zef Za\u0142uski 1693-1720 *Andrzej G\u0142\u0119bocki 1720-1735 *Stanis\u0142aw Wincenty Jab\u0142onowski 1735-1754 Janina Dobrzyniecka, Stanis\u0142aw Wincenty Jab\u0142onowski, w: Polski S\u0142ownik Biograficzny, 1962-1964, t.
