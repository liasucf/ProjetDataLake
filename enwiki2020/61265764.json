Vultures Josh Gondelman rated the episode 3 out of 5. Gondelman found it largely self- referential, writing that: \"We spend much of this episode watching the characters watch each other on screens\". Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode a B+, reviewing that it was an improvement over \"History 101\". VanDerWerff praised the non-supernatural explanation of events and emotional moments involving Pierce and Jeff. However, she criticized that some character development from previous seasons had been ignored and thought the humor could be improved. Sean Gandert of Paste similarly criticized the characterization and found the episode to lack ingenuity or humor. Rating it 7.2 out of 10, Eric Goldman of IGN reviewed the characters as \"cartoonish\" and found the episode to be mixed overall. Cory Barker of TV.com believed it to be roughly as good as \"Introduction to Statistics\" but inferior to the other Halloween episodes. Barker liked Jeff's storyline and some of the jokes.
