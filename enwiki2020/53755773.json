Boqvist was selected 36th overall by the Devils in the 2017 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== Boqvist made his Swedish Hockey League debut playing with Bryn\u00e4s IF during the 2015\u201316 SHL season. On May 16, 2017, Boqvist agreed to extend his contract with Bryn\u00e4s IF for a further two seasons through to 2019. Boqvist was drafted 36th overall, in the second round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, by the New Jersey Devils. On 10 June 2019, Boqvist signed a three-year, entry-level contract with the New Jersey Devils. Boqvist scored his first NHL career goal in a 3\u20132 loss against the Minnesota Wild on 26 November 2019. Boqvist's goal, which tied the game 1\u20131 in the first period, caused controversy by the play of Wayne Simmonds. The Wild used its coach's challenge for the play, but the goal was allowed to stand. The NHL then issued a statement during the third period that the goal should not been allowed. ==Personal Life== Boqvist's younger brother Adam Boqvist is a defenceman for the Chicago Blackhawks. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text- align:center; width:60em;\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! colspan=\"5\"|Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\"| ! colspan=\"5\"|Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
