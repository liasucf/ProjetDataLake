    "text": "Darren Seals (May 15, 1987 \u2013 September 6, 2016) was an American racial justice, anti-police brutality, and anti-gun violence activist from Ferguson, Missouri who worked on the assembly line at General Motors. In September 2016, he was found shot dead in a burning car. St. Louis County Police are investigating his death as a homicide; they have not publicly identified suspects or motives. ==Early life== Seals grew up in Ferguson, Missouri, a few blocks from the apartment complex where police officer Darren Wilson shot and killed Michael Brown. Seals had known the Brown family since childhood. ==Activism== Seals was active in Ferguson, Missouri, protests in the wake of the police shootings of Brown and Cary Ball Jr., * * * with his commentary appearing in media outlets, per CNN, \"as he continued to be outspoken about racial issues after the Brown protests subsided.\" He co-founded Hands Up United, and The Washington Post described him as \"among St. Louis\u2019s most prominent anti-police brutality activists.\" Seals had survived a shooting in 2013, and attributed his commitment to anti-gun violence activism to that experience. In 2014, he joined the Fannie Lou Hamer Coalition and helped rally a movement to vote against the Democratic candidate for St. Louis county executive, by backing white Republican candidate Rick Stream. The move in the highly Democratic African American community was an attempt, as The Washington Post described it, to \"demonstrate that their votes should not be taken for granted.\"* * He was an integral part of this effort. His leadership connected the community and politicians to move 22,000 Democratic votes to the Republican candidate. After voting for Barack Obama, Seals became a critic of what he saw as the President's insufficient action on many issues including police violence and racial profiling. In 2014, he joined the Fannie Lou Hamer Coalition and helped rally a movement to vote against the Democratic candidate for St. Louis county executive, by backing white Republican candidate Rick Stream. The move in the highly Democratic African American community was an attempt, as The Washington Post described it, to \"demonstrate that their votes should not be taken for granted.\"* Seals was a rapper in St. Louis group D.O.A.; in their song \"Born Targets\", Seals criticized police response to the Ferguson demonstrations. Seals was known as \"King D Seals\" on social media, and referred to himself as a \u201cBusinessman, Revolutionary, Activist, Unapologetically BLACK, Afrikan in AmeriKKKa, Fighter, Leader\". He was an outspoken critic of Black Lives Matter. He used Twitter as a public platform to call out the organization for taking in millions in donations from billionaire sponsor George Soros, and giving nothing back to the Ferguson community where they held protests against the police killing of Michael Brown. Seals' disapproval was founded in Ferguson's local activist sentiment that the organization hijacked their movement, publicizing it on social media as their own, motivated by personal, political, and financial benefit. Seals criticism was blunt: \"The only thing #Deray #Netta or #BlackLivesMatter (the org) did in #Ferguson was tweet about our work and collect $\". ==Death== Seals was killed on September 6, 2016, in Riverview, a northern suburb of St. Louis. A homicide investigation revealed he was shot before he was placed in a car, that was later set on fire. Media outlets noted \"the resemblance of Seals' death to the unsolved killing of Deandre Joshua,\" another Ferguson resident who was also found shot in a burning car two years earlier, on the night of the announcement a grand jury had not indicted Wilson in Brown's death. Police report that while Joshua's case is still open and active, Seals' death has not been linked to it, but nor has a link been ruled out. The Daily Beast found four more cases of similar deaths in St. Louis County in the last two years. == References == Category:1987 births Category:2016 deaths Category:2016 murders in the United States Category:Activists for African-American civil rights Category:American civil rights activists Category:Deaths by firearm in Missouri Category:People murdered in Missouri Category:People from St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Murdered activists ",
