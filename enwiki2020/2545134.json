    "text": "True Confessions is the third studio album by English girl group Bananarama. It was released on 12 July 1986 by London Records. The majority of the album was produced by Tony Swain and Steve Jolley (who produced Bananarama's eponymous second album), with the exception of \"Venus\" and \"More Than Physical\" (later given a garage remix for its single version), which began Bananarama's association with the Stock Aitken Waterman songwriting and production team. The album contains the group's most commercially successful single to date, a cover version of Shocking Blue's 1969 song \"Venus\", which peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States. True Confessions reached number 46 on the UK Albums Chart and number 15 on the US Billboard 200. ==Track listing== ===2013 deluxe edition=== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of True Confessions. ===Bananarama=== * Keren Woodward * Sara Dallin * Siobhan Fahey ===Additional musicians=== * Tony Swain \u2013 keyboards * Steve Jolley \u2013 guitar * Keith Thomas \u2013 sax * Matt Aitken \u2013 guitar ; keyboards * Mike Stock \u2013 keyboards * Gary Hughes \u2013 keyboards * A.
