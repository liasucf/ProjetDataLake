It was his time in Huddersfield that saw the publication of his first three collections. In 1993 he moved to rural Aberdeenshire where he lived for eight years, this being the inspiration for his fourth collection Here In Scotland (with Czech artist and writer Milan Knizak). He was Writer-in-Residence at Huddersfield University (1986\u201387) and subsequently has held numerous positions as a creative writing tutor including: WEA, Huddersfield (1987\u201389); Poet In Schools, Kirklees (1989); Arvon Foundation at Lumb Bank (1989); University of Huddersfield (1989\u201393); Open College of the Arts (1989\u20132001); Gray's School of Art, The Robert Gordon University (1993\u201396).
