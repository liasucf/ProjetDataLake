    "text": "The Wisconsin Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WIAC) is a college athletic conference that competes in the NCAA's Division III. In women's gymnastics, it competes alongside Division I and II members, as the NCAA sponsors a single championship event open to members of all NCAA divisions. As the name implies, member teams are located in the state of Wisconsin, although there are three associate members from Minnesota and one from Illinois. All full members are part of the University of Wisconsin System. ==History== In 1913, representatives from Wisconsin's eight normal schools\u2014Superior Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Superior), River Falls State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin-River Falls), Stevens Point Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Stevens Point), La Crosse State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse), Oshkosh State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Oshkosh), Whitewater Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater), Milwaukee State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee) and Platteville Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Platteville)--met in Madison to organize the Inter- Normal Athletic Conference of Wisconsin. The Stout Institute (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Stout) joined in 1914, followed by Eau Claire State Normal School (now the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire) in 1917.History The conference evolved with the growing educational mission of its member schools. It changed its name to the Wisconsin State Teachers College Conference in 1926, and the Wisconsin State College Conference in 1951. Finally, in 1964, it became the Wisconsin State University Conference. In 1971, the member schools of the WSUC joined with the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison, University of Wisconsin\u2013Parkside and Carthage College to form the Wisconsin Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Conference. By 1975, UW\u2013Milwaukee, Carroll College, the University of Wisconsin\u2013Green Bay and Marquette University had also joined. With the dissolution of the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women in 1982, the member schools joined their male counterparts in either the NCAA or NAIA. By 1993, the non-NCAA Division III members had all dropped out, resulting in the WWIAC having the same membership as the WSUC. Under the circumstances, a merger was inevitable. In 1996, Gary Karner was named commissioner of both the WSUC and the WWIAC. The two conferences formally merged in 1997 to form the current WIAC. Effective with the 2001\u201302 academic year, Lawrence University joined the conference in the sport of wrestling. Three Minnesota schools, Gustavus Adolphus College, Hamline University and Winona State University, became members of the conference in the sport of women's gymnastics during the 2004\u201305 academic year. In 2009\u201310, the conference added men\u2019s soccer as a sponsored sport with the announcement of Michigan school Finlandia University as an affiliate member. Lawrence discontinued its affiliation with the WIAC in wrestling. The conference remained unusually stable over the years; the only changes in full membership being the departures of UW\u2013Milwaukee in 1964 and UW\u2013Superior in 2015. ===Centennial celebration=== The ninth-oldest conference in the nation, the WIAC celebrated its centennial year during the 2012\u201313 academic year.Centennial year Additionally, the WIAC is the most successful NCAA Division III conference in history, boasting NCAA National Championships in 15 different sports.NCAA National Championships in 15 sports At the beginning of the 2011\u201312 academic year, the conference had claimed a nation-leading 92 NCAA National Championships.92 NCAA Championships To celebrate its centennial, the conference named All-Time Teams in each sport that is currently or was previously recognized as a \"championship\" sport within the conference.All-Time Teams Furthermore, the WIAC commissioned a commemorative work of art, created by Tim Cortes,Commemorative work of art and has also created a two-year calendar in celebration of its centennial.2-year calendar The celebration was headlined by its Centennial Banquet held on August 4, 2012, at the Alliant Energy Center in Madison, Wisconsin.
