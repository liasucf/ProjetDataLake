The tournament was held in various cities across Australia, and was contested from 7 March through to 13 April 2003. VIS Vipers won the tournament for the first time after defeating QLD Scorchers 4\u20133 in penalties, after the final finished as a 3\u20133 draw. Canberra Strikers finished in third place after defeating WA Diamonds 4\u20133 in the third and fourth place playoff. ==Participating Teams== * Canberra Strikers * NSWIS Arrows * Territory Pearls * QLD Scorchers * Adelaide Suns * Tassie Van Demons * VIS Vipers * WA Diamonds ==Competition format== The 2003 Women's Australian Hockey League consisted of a single round robin format, followed by classification matches. Teams from all 8 states and territories competed against one another throughout the pool stage. At the conclusion of the pool stage, the top four ranked teams progressed to the semi-finals, while the bottom four teams continued to the classification stage. The first four rounds of the pool stage comprised two- legged fixtures between states. As a result, matches in rounds five to seven of the pool stage were worth double points, due to the single-leg format. ===Point allocation=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !colspan=10|Points |- !style=\"width: 40px;\"| !style=\"width: 40px;\"| !style=\"width: 40px;\"| !style=\"width: 40px;\"| |- || 3 || 2 || 1 || 0 |} Every match in the 2003 AHL needed an outright result. In the event of a draw, golden goal extra time was played out, and if the result was still a draw a penalty shoot-out was contested, with the winner receiving a bonus point. ==Results== ===Preliminary round=== ====Fixtures==== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Classification round=== ====Fifth to eighth place classification==== =====Crossover===== \\---- =====Seventh and eighth place===== =====Fifth and sixth place===== ====First to fourth place classification==== =====Semi-finals===== \\---- =====Third and fourth place===== =====Final===== ==Awards== {| class=wikitable style=\"margin:auto; text-align:center\" !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Player of the League !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Top Goalscorer !style=\"width: 220px;\"|Player of the Final |- | Carmel Bakurski | Katrina Powell | Rachel Imison |} ==Statistics== ===Final standings=== ===Goalscorers=== ==References== ==External links== 2003 Category:2003 in Australian women's field hockey ",
