From scene to scene, it manages to maintain a certain tone and build up the tension. But it\u2019s all in service of a narrative that doesn\u2019t have any thematic follow-through. The film builds so much moral ambiguity, and there\u2019s so much left to dissect as the film raises the volume on the music and jumps to its conclusion. This is a sharp piece of filmmaking, but what it ends up saying through its abandonment of its complexity is questionable at best.\" Nazamel Tabares of Movies Philippines rated the film 4 stars out of 5 and wrote that \"Dukot might not be as thrilling or as meaty as the themes it tackles, but it is a well-made suspense thriller that doesn\u2019t come often in Philippine cinemas. It lacks power in its narrative even though it hints some every now and then, but the shots are tastefully done and the story is decent enough that you get to feel the tense of the situation and what the characters are going through emotionally. Well, some of it.\" Rey de la Cruz Jr. of FHM Philippines rated the film 7.5 out of 10 describing the film as \"a well-directed suspense thriller about a real-life kidnapping. Nice to see an actor like Enrique Gil finally show off his acting skills.\" Oggs Cruz of Rappler in a less positive review wrote that \"the film\u2019s failure really lies in its misdirected ambitions. It only provokes partially, quickly retreating from its hefty provocations just when the opportunity to get darker and more vicious opens up. Again, it\u2019s all interesting in premise. Everything else is just too safe.\" Kevin Tan of Film Police Reviews rated the film 3 stars out of 5 and wrote that \"Dukot can be commended on injecting fresh ideas into the local mainstream industry, and it shows Soriano\u2019s maturity in his craft. However, the script lacks the guts to deliver a story as dark and gritty as its visuals. Dukot holds back on depicting hostility and violence that could have rendered audiences more upset and unsettled about today\u2019s reality the moment they exit theaters.\" ==Full Cast & Crew== *Starring: Enrique Gil, Ricky Davao, Shaina Magdayao, Bing Pimentel, Christopher de Leon, Candy Pangilinan, Bangs Garcia, Ping Medina, Alex Medina, & Dindo Arroyo *Directed by: Paul Soriano *Produced by: Paul Soriano, Charo Santos-Concio, & Malou Santos *Music by: Robbie Factoran & Ricardo Juco *Written by: Mark Victor & Jaqueline Franquelli (as Jaqueline V.
