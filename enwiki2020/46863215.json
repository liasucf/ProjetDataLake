    "text": "Eyes Wide, Tongue Tied is the fourth album by the Scottish rock band The Fratellis. The album was announced on 1 June 2015 with the first track, \"Me and the Devil\" (which was given away for free from the band's website), and released on 21 August 2015.http://thefratellis.com/ The album was written and recorded in Los Angeles during November 2014 with Tony Hoffer, who also produced the band's first album Costello Music and Jon Fratelli's solo album Psycho Jukebox. == Recording == After the release of The Soul Crush EP in September 2014, and the band's first shows in Russia, it was announced that they would go to Los Angeles to record the follow up to We Need Medicine. During the tour for that album, the band debuted the new songs \"All the Livelong Day\", which later became \"Impostors (Little By Little)\" and \"Too Much Wine\". They went to record the new album during January 2014, and after various attempts they gave up and decided to bring back Tony Hoffer. During that session, \"Me and the Devil\" was the third song to make it onto the record. Every other song was discarded for the time being. \"Rosanna\" uses the same melody as a track released for free on Codeine Velvet Club's website called \"Mellotron Boogie No 3\". Jon Fratelli said at the time that it would probably find its place somewhere one day. The title of the album comes from the bonus track \"Medusa In Chains\". == Track listing == == Personnel == Band * Jon Fratelli \u2013 guitar and vocals, piano * Barry Fratelli \u2013 bass guitar and backing vocals (tracks 1-13, 19-21) * Mince Fratelli \u2013 drums and backing vocals (tracks 1-13, 19-21) Additional musicians * Will Foster - piano and keyboards on \"I Know Your Kind\" and \"I'm Gonna Be Your Elvis\" Production (tracks 1-13) * Tony Hoffer - producer * Tony Hoffer - mixer * Cameron Lister - engineer * Dave Cooley - mastering * Recorded at The Hobby Shop Recording Studios, Los Angeles Production (tracks 14-21) * Stuart McCredie - producer and mixing * Dean Honer - mastering (tracks 14-18) * Callum Malcolm - mastering (tracks 19-21) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2015) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:The Fratellis albums Category:Albums produced by Tony Hoffer ",
