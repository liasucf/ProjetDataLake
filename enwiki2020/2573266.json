    "text": "Components is an album by jazz vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, released on the Blue Note label in 1966. The first side of the LP features compositions by Hutcherson, in a hard bop style, whilst the second side features Joe Chambers' compositions, more in the avant-garde style. ==Composition== Hutcherson describes \"Tranquillity\" as \"so tranquil as to almost suggest no time at all.\" \"Little B's Poem\" was written for his son, Barry, three years old at the time. \"The melodic line reminds me of how he used to play.\" \"West 22nd Street Theme\", which closes side one, is a reference to a Manhattan section near the 10th Ave, Chelsea, where Hutcherson lived for a while. It is a depiction of some guys who used to be on Hutcherson's doorstep, stoned. \"It's a blues,\" says Hutcherson, \"but the changes are different than the usual blues chords.\" Side two features Chambers originals. \"Movement\" is \"like a six-part theme constantly in motion, held together by a pulse.\" It was described by Nat Hentoff as a piece where \"different listeners can find widely different visions.\" About \"Air\", Chambers says: \"Once that's set, they all jump into free counterpoint. As in all the pieces, each voice has to remain independent but in relationship to what's going on around him.\" \"Pastoral\" signifies a comeback to a kind of primitive setting, \"as if to say to the listener 'This is what we come back to \u2013 the familiar, the beginning'.\"Original liner notes by Nat Hentoff. ==Track listing== #\"Components\" (Hutcherson) \u2013 6:25 #\"Tranquillity\" (Hutcherson) \u2013 5:03 #\"Little B's Poem\" (Hutcherson) \u2013 5:11 #\"West 22nd Street Theme\" (Hutcherson) \u2013 4:42 #\"Movement\" (Chambers) \u2013 7:31 #\"Juba Dance\" (Chambers) \u2013 5:23 #\"Air\" (Chambers) \u2013 4:48 #\"Pastoral\" (Chambers) \u2013 2:02 ==Personnel== *Bobby Hutcherson \u2013 vibraphone *James Spaulding \u2013 alto saxophone, flute *Freddie Hubbard \u2013 trumpet *Herbie Hancock \u2013 piano *Ron Carter \u2013 double bass *Joe Chambers \u2013 drums == References == Category:1966 albums Category:Blue Note Records albums Category:Modal jazz albums Category:Post-bop albums Category:Bobby Hutcherson albums Category:Albums produced by Alfred Lion Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio ",
