The boulevard is a popular dining and shopping destination for locals and visitors as it is situated close to Fort Lauderdale Beach, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Port Everglades. ==History== The Cheesecake Factory on Las Olas The boulevard was constructed in 1917, when Las Olas was just a dirt road that crossed the swampy wetlands to the barrier island at Fort Lauderdale Beach. The Las Olas Isles were dredged in the 1920s to create land for the areas most picturesque waterfront residential district. The modern commercial segment of Las Olas Boulevard was constructed during the Post World War II era. The westernmost downtown segment was entirely reconstructed since the 1970s. The boulevard begins at the famous Elbo Room bar where the beach meets the boulevard and ends in the west at the Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale. In the early 1980s Las Olas went through a major renovation program to enhance property values. The land was worth much more than that of the standing homes. It was decided that anyone who wished to buy property on one of the isles would have to tear down the existing home and build a home of equal or greater value than the land. There were a few celebrities who already lived on Las Olas, but new homes and waterfronts made it more appealing to move to the area. Professional tour companies provide tours that take people down the waterways to show off the celebrities homes and yachts.Las Olas Tours of Celebrity HomesJohnny WeissmullerWayne Huizenga sells Las Olas homeConnie Francis Celebrates the 50th anniversary of Where the Boys Are on Fort Lauderdale Beach ==Notable residents== A few of the most notable (past and present) are: *Johnny Weissmuller, actor who played Tarzan and invented the signature yell. *Wayne Huizenga, CEO of Waste Management, Inc, Blockbuster Video and AutoNation. *David L Cook, Christian music star and entrepreneur. *Connie Francis, actress and movie star who was featured in the movie, Where the Boys Are which was filmed on Las Olas Blvd at the famed Elbo Room. *Dan Quayle, former Vice President of the United States. *Lee Majors, actor who played The Six Million Dollar Man and former husband to Farrah Fawcett. *Sonny and Cher, singers and actors. *Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz, television and movie stars.
