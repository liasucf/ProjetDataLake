    "text": "The Social Liberal Party (, PSL) is a far-right * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * political party in Brazil. Founded in 1994 as a social liberal party, the PSL was registered on the Superior Electoral Court in 1998. In January 2018, former Social Christian Party politician Jair Bolsonaro joined the party and later converted it into an economically liberal, nationalist, radically anti- communist and social conservative party. The original name remained after the ideological shift, and after Livres (the party's original main wing) left the party and formed their own political movement to continue the party's original goals. Bolsonaro became the party's nominee for the 2018 presidential election and won in both rounds. Bolsonaro left the party in 2019 after disagreements with its president, Luciano Bivar, and then founded Alliance for Brazil. == History == PSL was originally founded on 30 October 1994 by businessman Luciano Bivar as a social liberal party. It was registered on the Superior Electoral Court on 2 June 1998. In the 2002 legislative elections, PSL won 1 out of 513 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Federal Senate. In the 2006 legislative elections, the party won no seats in the Chamber of Deputies or the Federal Senate. In the 2010 legislative elections, PSL won 1 seat in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Federal Senate, maintaining the same results in the 2014 legislative elections. In 2015, PSL underwent a reform led by the internal social liberal wing Livres, with names such as political scientist and journalist Leandro Narloch reinforcing the party's affiliation with social liberal policies. PSL also supported the impeachment of former president Dilma Rousseff. On 5 January 2018, conservative and former Social Christian politician Jair Bolsonaro became a member of the party, which prompted the Livres wing to leave the party in protest of Bolsonaro's social conservative views. After the exit of Livres, the party followed a national conservative path, changed its colors from purple to the more nationalist blue, yellow and green (the colors of Brazil's flag) and since then has discussed a name change either to Republicans (Republicanos) or Mobilize (Mobiliza). On 5 March 2018, Bivar stepped down from party's presidency and Gustavo Bebianno was appointed as acting president. Bolsonaro eventually became PSL's nominee for the 2018 presidential election, exceeding polling forecasts to receive 46% of the popular vote in the first round. Bolsonaro's coattails helped elect 52 deputies and 4 senators from PSL, which made it the second largest political party in the post-2018 Chamber of Deputies. It also became the largest single party in the legislative assemblies of both Rio de Janeiro and S\u00e3o Paulo. On 28 October 2018, Bolsonaro was elected president with 55.13% of the votes, defeating Workers' Party's Fernando Haddad. He took office on 1 January 2019. On 29 October 2018, Bivar was re-appointed as party's president. On 12 November 2019, Bolsonaro announced his departure from the party following disagreements with the national executive. == Organization == === Ideology and policies === Since Bolsonaro's entrance in the party, PSL has changed much of its ideologies, abandoning its former socially liberal policies and keeping its economic liberal policies, supporting privatisation and decentralisation while at the same time adopting socially conservative policies regarding abortion, legalization of marijuana and teaching of gender identity in schools. == Electoral history == === Presidential elections === {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !rowspan=\"2\"|Election !rowspan=\"2\"|Party candidate ! rowspan=\"2\" |Running mate ! rowspan=\"2\" |Colligation !Votes !% !Votes !% !rowspan=\"2\"|Result ! rowspan=\"2\" |Sources |- !colspan=\"2\"|First round !colspan=\"2\"|Second round |- |2006 |Luciano Bivar (PSL) |Am\u00e9rico de Souza (PSL) |None |62.064 |0.06% (#7) | - | - |Lost | |- |2014 |Marina Silva (PSB) |Beto Albuquerque (PSB) |PSB; PHS; PRP; PPS; PPL; PSL | 22,176,619 | 21.32% (#3) | - | - |Lost | |- |2018 |Jair Bolsonaro (PSL) |Hamilton Mour\u00e3o (PRTB) |PSL; PRTB |49,276,990 |46.0% (#1) |57,797,801 |55.13% (#1) |Elected | |} === Chamber of Deputies and Senate elections === {| class=wikitable style=text- align:center |- ! rowspan=\"2\" |Election !colspan=\"4\"|Chamber of Deputies ! colspan=\"4\" |Federal Senate !rowspan=2|Government |- !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |2002 |408,512 | align=\"center\"|0.5% |style=\"text- align:center;\"| | 1 |N/A |align=\"center\"|0% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | | |- |2006 |190,793 |align=\"center\"|0.2% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 1 |46,542 |align=\"center\"|0.0% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | | |- |2010 |499,963 |align=\"center\"|0.5% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 1 |446,517 |align=\"center\"|0.3% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | | |- |2014 |808,710 |align=\"center\"|0.83% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | |N/A |align=\"center\"|0% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | | |- |2018 |11,457,878 |align=\"center\"|11.7% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 51 |19,413,869 |align=\"center\"|11.3% |style=\"text-align:center;\"| | 4 | |- |} == See also == * Jair Bolsonaro * Patriota == References == Category:Political parties established in 1994 Category:1994 establishments in Brazil Category:Conservative parties in Brazil Category:National conservative parties Category:Nationalist parties in Brazil Category:Political parties in Brazil Category:Right-wing populist parties Category:Right-wing populism in South America Category:Social conservative parties Category:Far-right politics in Brazil Category:Far-right political parties in Brazil Category:Anti-communist organizations ",
