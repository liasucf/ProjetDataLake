The word C\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101jak\u0101yika refers to the Four Heavenly Kings (C\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101ja) who rule over this world along with the assemblage or multitude (k\u0101yika) of beings that dwell there. The beings themselves are generally called c\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101jak\u0101yik\u0101s or c\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101jak\u0101yika devas. ==Description== The Ch\u0101turmah\u0101r\u0101jak\u0101yika heaven is the first of the heaven of the K\u0101madh\u0101tu and the lowest of the heavens that maintains a physical connection with the human world. It is located on the slopes of Mount Sumeru, though some of the devas there dwell inside the mountain and in the sky surrounding it. The most notable residents of this world are the Four Heavenly Kings who serve \u015aakra of the higher heaven Tr\u0101yastri\u1e43\u015ba, and govern the four cardinal directions. They are also leaders of various races of beings who reside here. Their functions are as follows: *Dh\u1e5btar\u0101\u1e63\u1e6dra - Guardian of the East. Leader of the gandharvas and pi\u015b\u0101cas. *Vir\u016b\u1e0dhaka - Guardian of the South. Leader of the kumbh\u0101\u1e47\u1e0das and pretas. *Vir\u016bp\u0101k\u1e63a - Guardian of the West.
