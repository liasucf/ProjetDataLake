The German reference to this operation is the \"Budapest front\".p.772, per Colonel Werncke, former deputy G-4 of the 6th SS Panzer Army, in The Employment of the 6th SS Panzer Army in Hungary and Austria from February to May 1945 (manuscript), Glantz D.

The primary opponents on this sector of the front was the 2nd Panzer Army which included the LXVIII and XXII Mountain Corps. After the successful 2nd Ukrainian Front's Kecskem\u00e9t-Budapest Offensive (29 October 1944 \u2013 10 December 1944) and Szolnok\u2013Budapest Offensive (29 October 1944 \u2013 10 December 1944) east of Balaton, the German forces south-west of the lake retreated, which aided the Bulgarian advance. The Bulgarian 1st Army breached the first two defensive Axis lines and crossed the Mura river. They then assumed a defensive posture at the Veliki Kog-Yastrebtzi line and remained there until 7 May. On 7 May they resumed advance which soon became a pursuit of fleeing enemy and the capture of the remnants of the Wehrmacht and Hungarian troops. By 13 May 1945, the Bulgarian 1st Army reached the Austrian Alps in the Klagenfurt area where they met the British Eighth Army. ==References== == Sources == * David Glantz (ed.), 1986 Art of War symposium, From the Vistula to the Oder: Soviet Offensive Operations \u2013 October 1944 \u2013 March 1945, A transcript of Proceedings, Center for Land Warfare, US Army War College, 19\u201323 May 1986 * Bishop, Chris, The Military Atlas of World War II, Igloo Books, London, 2005 Category:Nagykanizsa Mura Category:Military operations of World War II involving Germany Category:Military operations of World War II involving Bulgaria Category:Strategic operations of the Red Army in World War II Category:Bulgaria\u2013Soviet Union relations Category:Battles involving the Yugoslav Partisans Category:March 1945 events Category:April 1945 events ",
