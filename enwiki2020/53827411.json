    "text": "John Daniel 'Snowy' Cutmore (29 August 1895 \u2013 27 October 1927), was a notorious and violent Australian criminal best known as leader of the Fitzroy Gang, a member of the Tilly Devine's Sydney razor gang, and for his part in the death of Norman Bruhn and Squizzy Taylor. His life and times were portrayed in the television series on the Nine television network in Australia, Underbelly: Razor and Underbelly: Squizzy. He also appears in the 1982 biopic Squizzy Taylor, where is played by Steve Bisley. ==Life and death== Cutmore fled from Melbourne to Sydney in 1923 after a fallout with Squizzy Taylor over the Fitzpatrick\u2019s Jewellery store robbery.http://www.friendsofcoburgcemetery.com/Documents/22-Cutmore.pdf Cutmore and Taylor's animosity went all the way back to the 1919 Fitzroy Vendetta - a battle over the sly grog trade between the Fitzroy Gang and Squizzy Taylor's gang. Shortly after returning to Melbourne to avoid a likely conviction in New South Wales, Cutmore and Taylor both died in a shootout at the home of Cutmore's mother on 27 October 1927. He is buried in the Coburg Cemetery in Melbourne. ==References== Category:1895 births Category:1927 deaths Category:20th-century Australian criminals Category:Australian organised crime figures ",
