The aim of the international project OSAMI is the design of a basic, widely applicable SOA-oriented component platform, its development, test and its provision as open source software. The project consists of a number of national sub-projects, each focussing on a certain field of application. OSGi and Web Services forms the technical basis of the OSAMI platform in order to implement distributed, dynamically configurable, vendor-neutral and device-independent solutions.
