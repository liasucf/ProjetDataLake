Interior facing apse ==History== A church at the site dates likely to the 4th or 5th centuries, when a church was erected upon the ruins of a former pagan temple, and dedicated to Saint Thecla, a virgin and martyr from Anatolia. The cathedral has been refurbished over the centuries. It was rebuilt in the 8th century till possessing five naves. The church was reconsecrated by Pope Leo IX in 1052. Until the 16th century, the layout continued to have the apse in the east. During a refurbishment during 1583 to 1592, designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi, the facade was re-oriented. After an earthquake in 1688 damaged the church, and a complete reconstruction was promoted by the town archpriest Marco Marchetti, using designs for an elliptical nave with a tall cupola, by the Venetian architect Antonio Gaspari. Work begun in 1690 with the blessing of the bishop Gregorio Barbarigo, and was completed in 1720 with consecration by Cardinal Rezzonico, the future Pope Clement XIII. The facade was never completed, and remains in rough brick. The lower part of the bell-tower dates to the 8th century, but it was raised to its present height in 1724 by the architect Rossi.La patria; geografia dell' Italia: provincie di Verona, Vicenza, e Padova, 1890, by Gustavo Chiesi and compiled Gustavo Strafforello page 436.
