Woo was not happy working for the production company Golden Harvest, noting that he \"I just wanted to make any movie for them to finish the contract.\" Woo found the script to be fairly simple and made changes to it to make it more emotional. The film was shot in Thailand the film featured cast and crew who did not speak English. This included three Korean actors, two French actors (Phillippe Loffredo and C\u00e9cile Le Bailly) and a Japanese cameraman and director of photography. The film included scenes of sexuality and drug use which were not shot by Woo. ==Release== After the film's completion, it was shelved. Woo commented that the film was all over the place in tone with sometimes being very emotional, something being as violent as a horror film and that it did not contain any popular actors. As of 2004, Woo stated he had not seen the film in its finished form. After the popularity of Woo's film A Better Tomorrow, the film was released for one week in Hong Kong under the new title Heroes Shed No Tears. The film was released in Hong Kong on September 5, 1986. It grossed a total of 2.8 million Hong Kong Dollars. ==Reception== From retrospective reviews, Heroes Shed No Tears received a four out of ten rating from John Charles in his book The Hong Kong Filmography , 1977-1997. The review noted that the film had \"virtually no plot\" and \"few sympathetic characters\" and that it \"displays none of the finesse that would characterise Woo's later work\" In his book Ten Thousand Bullets, Christopher Heard stated that the film was \"nowhere near as slick as [Woo]'s later movies, but it does have a dark visual harshness that indicates Woo knew the direction in which he wanted to travel.\" ==See also== * List of Hong Kong films == References == ===Footnotes=== ===Sources=== * * * ==External links== * * Category:1986 films Category:1986 action thriller films Category:Cantonese- language films Category:Films directed by John Woo Category:Foreign films shot in Thailand Category:Golden Harvest films Category:Hong Kong action thriller films Category:Hong Kong films Category:War adventure films ",
