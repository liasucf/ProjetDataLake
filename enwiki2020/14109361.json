    "text": "55 Cancri f (abbreviated 55 Cnc f), also designated Rho1 Cancri f and formally named Harriot ,Mathematics Pronunciation Guide is an extrasolar planet approximately 41 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Cancer (the Crab). 55 Cancri f is the fourth known planet (in order of distance) from the star 55 Cancri and the first planet to have been given the designation of \"f\". ==Name== In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars.NameExoWorlds: An IAU Worldwide Contest to Name Exoplanets and their Host Stars. IAU.org. 9 July 2014 The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names.NameExoWorlds The Process In December 2015, the IAU announced the winning name was Harriot for this planet.Final Results of NameExoWorlds Public Vote Released, International Astronomical Union, 15 December 2015. The winning name was submitted by the Royal Netherlands Association for Meteorology and Astronomy of the Netherlands. It honors the astronomer Thomas Harriot.NameExoWorlds The Approved Names == Discovery == Radial velocity changes over time of 55 Cancri caused by the orbit of 55 Cancri f. The initial presentation of this planet occurred at a meeting of the American Astronomical Society in April 2005, however it was another two and a half years before the planet was to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. It is the first known planet outside our solar system to spend its entire orbit within what astronomers call the \"habitable zone\". Furthermore, its discovery made 55 Cancri the first star other than the Sun known to have at least five planets. ==Orbit and mass== 55 Cnc f's orbit compared to the orbit of Venus (0.72AU). 55 Cancri f is located about 0.781 AU away from the star and takes 262 days to complete a full orbit. A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect 55 Cancri f is that only a minimum mass can be obtained, in this case around 0.144 times that of Jupiter, or half the mass of Saturn. A Keplerian fit to the radial velocity data of 55 Cancri A indicates that the orbit is consistent with being circular, however changing the value in a range between 0 and 0.4 does not significantly alter the chi-squared statistic of the fit, thus a representative eccentricity of 0.2\u00b10.2 was assumed. In a Newtonian model which takes interactions between the planets into account, the eccentricity comes out as 0.0002, almost perfectly circular. Astrometric observations made with the Hubble Space Telescope suggest that the outer planet 55 Cancri d is inclined at 53\u00b0 with respect to the plane of the sky. The inner planets b and e are inclined at 85\u00b0. The inclination of f is unknown. == Characteristics == Since the planet was detected indirectly through observations of its star, properties such as its radius, composition and temperature are unknown. With a mass half that of Saturn, 55 Cancri f is likely to be a gas giant with no solid surface. It orbits in the so-called \"habitable zone,\" which means that liquid water could exist on the surface of a possible moon. It is not known if the composition and appearance is more like that of Saturn or Neptune. Based on its temperature, it could be a Sudarsky Class II planet, covered in water clouds, or a Sudarsky Class III with no clouds and a dark azure color. ==References== ==External links== * Category:55 Cancri Category:Cancer (constellation) Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2005 Category:Exoplanets detected by radial velocity Category:Giant planets in the habitable zone Category:Exoplanets with proper names ",
