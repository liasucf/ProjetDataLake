    "text": "The London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) Karrier Ro-Railer was a British experimental road-rail (rail)bus built by Karrier in 1931. Its road registration was UR7924. Based on a Karrier Chaser bus with Cravens bodywork, it could run on the road on tyres or on standard gauge track. It had a 6-cylinder petrol engine. Initially used on the Hemel Hemstead \u2013 Harpenden branch line, it was transferred to Stratford-on-Avon in 1932 for services from Stratford Old Town railway station to the Welcombe Hotel. The front axle broke after only a few weeks service, and it is believed to have been sold on for use as road bus. == External links == * https://www.warwickshirerailways.com/lms/lms_ro-railer.htm * http://thesmjr.ning.com/page/the-rorailer Category:Experimental vehicles Category:Railcars of the United Kingdom ",
