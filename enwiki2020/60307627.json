Nexus told Nagatani that they are interested in creating an anime that features a \"chibi- style robots\", and Nagatani accepted the idea as he also love those kind of anime. Nagatani left the creative process to the studio while he would organize it. While hiring the Granbelm 's staff, Nagatani and the studio firstly decided to bring a director, with Nexus suggesting Masaharu Watanabe as the director for the series since they worked with him in his production of Re:Zero \u2212 Starting Life in Another World, thus Watanabe was appointed as the director. The series composition was handled by Jukki Hanada. When deciding on who should be responsible for the series' character design, the staff discussed that they wanted \"mellow visuals for the anime because it\u2019s the story of girls fighting with all their might\", hearing that, director Watanabe suggested Shinichiro Otsuka, who's known for illustrating the artwork for Re:Zeros light novel. For the mecha designs, Nexus recommended Jimmy Stone. Nagatani stated that Anna, a controversial character in the series, is the character he liked the most and stated that he understands her \"personalty\" and sympathized with the character for carrying a \"heavy burden\". He praised Hanada on his ability for making each of the main characters \"charming as well as unique\", and states that \"each character has their own great attributes\" but Anna is the one that fascinates him the most. Nagatani thinks that as the story progresses, the viewers' favorite character will change. During the scenario meetings, the staff had agreed on the idea of \"girls and magic\" themed-series. When asked on why there aren't any male character in the series, Nagatani replied: \"We decided that the Granbelm would be an all-girl battle pretty early on. I can\u2019t even recall us talking about any male characters joining the battle. We called the participants of the battle \u2018witches\u2019 and the story was about the female line of the family. I think that\u2019s why we didn\u2019t even consider a male character. I\u2019d say that it naturally became an all-girls affair.\" The anime was announced by Nexus on March 1, 2019. The series is directed by Masaharu Watanabe, with Jukki Hanada handling series composition, Shinichirou Otsuka as the original character designer, and Kenichiro Suehiro composing the music. Infinite is producing the anime. Eir Aoi performed the series' opening theme song , while Uru performed the series' ending theme song . ==Release== Granbelm aired from July 5 to September 26, 2019 on the Animeism programming block on MBS, TBS, and BS-TBS.
