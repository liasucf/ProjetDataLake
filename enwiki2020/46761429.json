    "text": "Circuit Makati is a riverfront redevelopment project by Ayala Land on the site of the former Santa Ana Race Track in Makati, Metro Manila, Philippines. The site located in the northwest portion of Makati, on the south bank of the Pasig River, is planned to contain a mixed-use entertainment complex which would include an indoor theater, a shopping mall, hotels and residential and office skyscrapers. It would also contain a football turf, skate park and an outdoor entertainment area. The development is envisioned to become the new entertainment district of Makati and the city's lifestyle hub. ==Location== Ayala Malls Circuit Circuit Makati occupies a large portion of the village of Carmona near its border with Santa Ana, Manila. It is bounded by the Pasig River on the north, Hippodromo Street on the south, Fortuna Street to the east, and Aurelio Reyes Avenue to the west which connects to Chino Roces Avenue. The Santa Ana Church and some of Santa Ana's historic houses are within a few blocks of the site. It is located just north of the Makati CBD accessible via Ayala Avenue and South Avenue, and from Century City and Rockwell Center via J.P. Rizal Avenue and Kalayaan Avenue. ==Background== Circuit Makati had been occupied by the Santa Ana Park, a horse racetrack which operated from 1937 to 2008. Built in the Art Deco style, the racetrack was home to the Santa Ana Turf Club, the forerunner of what is now the Philippine Racing Club which introduced thoroughbred horse racing in the country. Prior to its establishment as a sporting and recreation facility, the site was home to the Santa Ana Cabaret, a dance hall and music venue for Manila's high society in the early 1900s. In 2009, a year after the hippodrome was closed, the Philippine Racing Club opened its new home in the Santa Ana Park (Saddle and Clubs Leisure Park) in Naic, Cavite. The club then entered into a joint venture agreement with Ayala Land and its subsidiary, Alveo Land, in 2011 for the development of the property. ==Planned buildings and facilities== Globe Circuit Event Grounds * Circuit Theater, a 1,500-seat indoor performing arts theater. * Circuit Lane, a retail walk that will cross the entire length of the district. * Circuit Events Ground, a 2-hectare outdoor venue that can accommodate 20,000 people for concerts, dance performances, fashion shows and sporting events. * Ayala Malls Circuit, a lifestyle center by Ayala Malls. * The Stiles Enterprise Plaza, an office-for- sale development by Alveo Land * Solstice, a residential condominium tower by Alveo Land. * Callisto, a residential condominium tower by Alveo Land. * S&R; Circuit, Membership Shopping. ==See also== * San Lazaro Tourism and Business Park ==References== ==External links== * Official website of Circuit Makati Category:Makati Category:Mixed-use developments in Metro Manila Category:Planned communities in the Philippines Category:Redeveloped ports and waterfronts in the Philippines Category:Pasig River ",
