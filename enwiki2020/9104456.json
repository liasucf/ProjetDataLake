After law studies in Oviedo, he taught comparative law in Madrid since 1864 and represented Le\u00f3n in the Cortes. In the 1870s, he joined Francisco Giner de los R\u00edos and Juli\u00e1n Sanz del R\u00edo to teach at the Instituci\u00f3n Libre de Ense\u00f1anza (Institute of Free Teaching).

In 1912, he was the co- founder of the Reformist Republican Party. ==References== * ==External links== * Category:1840 births Category:1917 deaths Category:People from Le\u00f3n, Spain Category:Spanish jurists Category:Spanish philosophers Category:Reformist Party (Spain) politicians ",
