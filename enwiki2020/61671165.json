On May 29, 2019, it was announced that an English-speaking version will air on CBC Television, produced by Zone3, starting on December 16, 2019. Game play is the same as the concurrent U.S. version. The Fast Money prize in this version is in tax-free money and if the champions don't win the grand prize, they get $5 a point. As of December 30, 2019, there is a limit of three appearances (unlike the U.S. version, where a family can appear up to five times and also win a car after their fifth and final win). Music score is the same as in U.S. original and studio set is nearly identical to the current one used in U.S. version of Family Feud, but have some differences. Each winning family from the first month would return following the three-day limit change. In February 2020, the show was renewed for a second season by CBC. The second season began airing on October 12, 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Family Feud Category:2010s Canadian game shows Category:2019 Canadian television series debuts Category:Television series by Fremantle (company) Category:Television series produced in Toronto Category:CBC Television original programming ",
