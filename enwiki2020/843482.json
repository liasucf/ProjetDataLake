    "text": "A bascule bridge (also referred to as a drawbridge or a lifting bridge) is a moveable bridge with a counterweight that continuously balances a span, or leaf, throughout its upward swing to provide clearance for boat traffic. It may be single- or double-leafed. The name comes from the French term for balance scale, which employs the same principle. Bascule bridges are the most common type of movable span because they open quickly and require relatively little energy to operate, while providing the possibility for unlimited vertical clearance for marine traffic. ==History== Bascule bridges have been in use since ancient times, but until the adoption of steam power in the 1850s, very long, heavy spans could not be moved quickly enough for practical application. ==Types== Henry Ford Bridge)|left Three types of bascule bridge designs are used, and counterweights required to balance a bascule's span may be located either above or below the bridge deck. The fixed-trunnion (sometimes a \"Chicago\" bascule) rotates around a large axle that raises the span(s). The Chicago bascule name derives from the location where it is widely used, and is a refinement by Joseph Strauss of the fixed-trunnion. Animation of a rolling lift bridge (such as the 200x200px The ' trunnion (sometimes a \"Scherzer\" rolling lift), raises the span by rolling on a track resembling a rocking-chair base. The \"Scherzer\" rolling lift is a refinement patented in 1893 by American engineer William Donald Scherzer. The rarer Rall type combines rolling lift with longitudinal motion on trunnions when opening. It was patented (1901) by Theodor Rall. One of the few surviving examples is the Broadway Bridge (1913), in Portland, Oregon. ==Examples== File:Tower Bridge (8151690991).jpg|Tower Bridge in London, perhaps the most famous and iconic bascule bridge of all time File:Tower Bridge from Shad Thames.jpg|The London Tower Bridge from Shad Thames File:Tower bridge schm020.png|Dimensional drawing of the London Tower Bridge File:The swing bridge - geograph.org.uk - 860105.jpg|White Cart Bridge, Renfrew, Scotland File:Birkenhead Bridge open 2010.jpg|The Birkenhead Bridge in Port Adelaide, Australia, fully opened File:Cherry Bascule.jpg|Cherry Street Strauss Trunnion Bascule Bridge at Toronto Harbour Shipping Channel, Toronto File:Cherry St at Keating.JPG|Cherry Street Bridge at Keating Channel in Toronto, Canada File:Crook Point Bascule Bridge (62332).jpg|Crook Point Bascule Bridge, Providence, Rhode Island, USA File:Lefty O'Doul Bridge.jpg|Another Strauss design, the Lefty O'Doul Bridge adjacent to Oracle Park in San Francisco, California File:Mystic River Bascule Bridge 4.JPG|Mystic River Bascule Bridge, Mystic, Connecticut File:Palace Bridge SPB (img2).jpg|Palace Bridge in Saint Petersburg File:Pamban Rail Bridge.jpg|Pamban Bridge over the Palk Strait in Rameswaram, India File:Pegasus bridge new.jpg|Rolling lift Pegasus Bridge over the Caen Canal, Normandy, France File:Pont-levant Montceau-les-Mines.JPG|Bascule bridge in Montceau-les-Mines, France File:Rio Negro.JPG|The Patagones-Viedma Railway Bridge, Argentina.
