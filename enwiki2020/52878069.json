    "text": "L'assassino \u00e8 ancora tra noi (translation: The Killer is Still Among Us) is a 1986 Italian horror film written and directed by Camillo Teti, and co-written by Ernesto Gastaldi and Giuliano Carnimeo. It is loosely based on the crimes of the Italian serial killer known as \"the Monster of Florence\". == Plot == A couple drives to a secluded lovers' lane on the outskirts of Florence to have sex, and is gunned down by a gloved prowler, who uses a knife and a tree branch to sexually mutilate the body of the female victim. The double homicide is the latest in a series of them, the work of a serial killer dubbed \"Il Mostro\" who Christiana Marelli, a criminology student, is researching for her thesis, to the dismay of her professor, the local police, and her doctor boyfriend, Alex. As Christiana investigates Il Mostro, she begins receiving strange telephone calls, and finds herself being shadowed by a stalker, who at one point attempts to break into her apartment while she is home alone. A bartender who had offered to meet with Christiana to provide her with information is later found hanged, and Christiana begins to suspect that her boyfriend is Il Mostro due to a combination of mounting circumstantial evidence, Alex's conspicuous absences during all of the murders, and the fact that she had told him about her planned rendezvous with the barkeep shortly before the man was found dead. After a couple whom she knew personally is murdered by Il Mostro, Christiana attends a s\u00e9ance in the hope that it can summon the victims' spirits, and shed light on the identity of Il Mostro. During the ceremony, the medium has a vision of Il Mostro butchering a pair of camping lovers, and spontaneously develops a wound similar to one that Il Mostro had inflicted upon one of the new victims. Christiana leaves the s\u00e9ance and races to the theater that she had last seen Alex at; she finds him there, which seemingly puts to rest her suspicions of him being Il Mostro. The film ends with Christiana making her way to the seat next to Alex (at one point muttering \"excuse me\" to the viewer) before settling in to watch L'assassino \u00e8 ancora tra noi. == Cast == * Mariangela D'Abbraccio as Christiana Marelli * Giovanni Visentin as Doctor Alex * Riccardo Parisio Perrotti * Luigi Mezzanotte as Doctor Franco M. Benincasa * Yvonne D'Abbraccio * Francesco Capitano * Oresto Antonio Rotundo * Silvia D'Agostini * Fabio Carfora * Franco Adducci * Marco Bertini * Anna Pera * Giuseppe Pelli * M. Rosario Tizzano * Roberto Sanna as Medium == Reception == L'assassino \u00e8 ancora tra noi was derisively deemed \"incredibly boring\" by Moviefone's Alison Nastasi, who went to say that while the film did have \"a few disturbing scenes\" they were not enough to save it from the \"banal dialogue\" and \"bad characters\" that made it \"a one way trip to dullsville\". == References == == External links == * Category:1986 films Category:1986 horror films Category:1986 independent films Category:1980s mystery films Category:1980s serial killer films Category:1980s supernatural films Category:Exploitation films Category:Giallo films Category:Horror films based on actual events Category:Italian films Category:Italian horror films Category:Italian independent films Category:Italian-language films Category:Italian mystery films Category:Italian slasher films Category:Films about stalking Category:Films about psychic powers Category:Films set in Florence Category:Films set in forests Category:Films shot in Tuscany Category:Self-reflexive films Category:Splatter films Category:Italian supernatural horror films Category:Crime films based on actual events Category:Works about unsolved crimes Category:1986 directorial debut films ",
