Although it is possible to use only a few spices (which many vendors do), the resulting meat is less flavourful. Some alternatives are also available. For example, in Muslim areas in Xi'an, the meat is usually beef (seasoned with cumin and pepper), and in Gansu Province it is often lamb. The meat is then minced or chopped and stuffed in \"baijimo\", a type of flatbread. An authentic baijimo is made from a wheat flour dough with yeast and then baked in a clay oven, but now in many parts of China, baijimo is made in a frying pan, giving a taste that diverges significantly from the authentic clay oven-baked version. Depending on the types of spices used to cook the meat and the way the bread is made, the taste of roujiamo can vary greatly from vendor to vendor. Roujiamo is not a full meal and is often sold in the form of combo with liangpi. It is found with regional modifications across China. Roujiamo is considered the Chinese equivalent to the Western hamburger and meat sandwiches. Roujiamo could be the world's oldest sandwich or hamburger, since the bread or the \"mo\" dates back to the Qin dynasty (221\u2013206 BC) and the meat to the Zhou dynasty (1045\u2013256 BC). Thus, Chinese media has claimed that hamburgers originated in China. ==See also== * Doner kebab * Donkey Burger * Gua bao * List of sandwiches * List of street foods * Sloppy joe ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:Shaanxi cuisine Category:Sandwiches Category:Pork dishes Category:Meat dishes ",
