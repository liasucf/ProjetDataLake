    "text": "The University of Cape Coast is a public collegiate research university located in Cape Coast, Ghana. The university was established in 1962 out of a dire need for highly qualified and skilled manpower in education. It was established to train graduate teachers for second cycle institutions such as teacher training colleges and technical institutions, a mission that the two existing public universities at the time were unequipped to fulfil. The university has since added to its functions the training of doctors and health care professionals, as well as education planners, administrators, legal professionals, and agriculturalists. UCC graduates include Ministers of State, High Commissioners, CEOs, and Members of Parliament. ==The campus== Sam Jonah Library Large Lecture TheatreFaculty of Education Lecture Theatre Faculty of Education Lecture TheatreCrocodile at the Zoo The university, which is five kilometres west of Cape Coast, is on a hill overlooking the Atlantic Ocean.

The School has the mandate to co-ordinate graduate-level academic programmes for all Colleges within the University. It also regulates and offers advice on graduate programmes of university colleges affiliated to the University of Cape Coast. To achieve its vision and mission, the School has four-fold functions: # Draft regulations for all higher degrees with a view to ensuring that acceptable academic standards are maintained. # Receive reports and consider recommendations pertaining to higher degrees and graduate diplomas from Departmental and Faculty Committee of Graduate Studies. # Determine the results of higher degrees and graduate diplomas. # Make recommendations to the Academic Board for the award of higher degrees and graduate diplomas.
