Thorne's directing, vision as well as the cinematography and music were among strong points for the film. One reviewer on AdultDVDTalk said: \"The plot for Her & Him is exceptional, as Small Hands twists in the wind, unsure of what his girlfriend is up to, the viewer twists with him. Bella Thorne does a great job of building the dramatic tension in Her & Him as the short film progresses. As the dramatic tension keeps amping up, Bella Thorne also amps up the sexual tension in the short film. Small Hands and Abella Danger both kill in their roles. They both do an excellent job with the non-sexual portions of the short film and the sexual portions. [...] Her & Him is a fantastic adult short film from writer and director Bella Thorne. Her & Him is well-crafted and works beautifully in the short film format. The short film is plot-heavy and graphic sex light; however, the short film builds the eroticism to the boiling point before the graphical sex is unleashed on the viewer. Pornhub has done an excellent job with their streaming-only edition of Her & Him with excellent image and sound quality.\" Decider.com said in a review: \"What they have in common is a high quotient of drama, the endlessly compelling motivational force behind so much of Thorne\u2019s explosive output. Regardless of the format, regardless of platform, regardless of medium, a work by Bella Thorne can only ever be that \u2014 a work by Bella Thorne, nothing more and nothing less.\" In addition Jezebel said \"Is this a visionary masterpiece from a 22-year-old who has never before made porn, and who, due to her mainstream fame, waltzed right into the industry and got to work with two of its top talents right off the bat? I am not at all convinced! I wish celebrities like Thorne would take their porn dalliances more seriously by giving the genre its due and respecting the art of arousing viewers, instead of treating it like a film school experiment and personal branding exercise.\" === Awards and nominations === {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Ceremony !Award !Nominee !Result |- |2019 |2nd Pornhub Awards |Visionary Award |Bella Thorne | |- | rowspan=\"8\" |2020 | rowspan=\"5\" |37th AVN Awards |Best Dramatic Screenplay |Bella Thorne | |- |AVN Award for Best Actress |Abella Danger | |- |AVN Award for Best Actor |Small Hands | |- |Best Featurette |\u2014 | |- |Best Soundtrack |\u2014 | |- | rowspan=\"3\" |XBIZ Awards |Best Sex Scene - Erotic-Themed |Abella Danger and Small Hands | |- |Best Art Direction |\u2014 | |- |Best Music |\u2014 | |} == References == == External links == * * * Her & Him trailer on YouTube * Her & Him behind the scenes on YouTube Category:2019 films Category:American pornographic films Category:American films Category:2010s pornographic films ",
