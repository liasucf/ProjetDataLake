    "text": "This page shows the all-time medal table for the Commonwealth Games. The table is updated as of 15 April 2018, the day the 2018 Commonwealth Games in Gold Coast ended. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC, IAAF and BBC. The source for this data are the tallies listed at the Commonwealth Games Federation's website. == Medal table == Nations in italics no longer participate at the Commonwealth Games. * Totals for Ghana include all medals won as * Totals for Zimbabwe include all medals won as * Totals for Zambia include all medals won as * Totals for Sri Lanka include all medals won as * Totals for Guyana include all medals won as ==Nations and Territories without medals== ===Current Commonwealth Members=== As of the end of the 2018 Commonwealth Games. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin- top:0; text-align:center; font-size:90%;\" |- !Nations and territories !\u2116 Games |- |align=left| || 6 |- |align=left| || 10 |- |align=left| || 10 |- |align=left| || 8 |- |align=left| || 10 |- |align=left| || 16 |- |align=left| || 8 |- |align=left| || 7 |- |align=left| || 5 |- |align=left| || 3 |- |align=left| || 7 |- |align=left| || 12 |- |align=left| || 7 |- |align=left| || 5 |} * Won at least one medal at a Commonwealth Youth Games Former Commonwealth Members {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"margin-top:0; text- align:center; font-size:90%;\" |- !Nations and territories !\u2116 Games |- |align=left| || 2 |- |align=left| || 2 |- |align=left| || 2 |- |align=left| || 2 |- |align=left| || 1 |- |align=left| || 1 |} * Total for the Federation of South Arabia includes appearance as ==See also== *All-time Olympic Games medal table ==Notes== ==References== * Commonwealth Games official website * The Commonwealth Games: The History of all the Sports, Bob Phillips 2002, Parrs Wood Press Manchester.
