    "text": "The Mount Zion Covered Bridge, near Mooresville, Kentucky, was built in 1871. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. It is a Burr truss covered bridge. The bridge was built long. It spans the Little Beech Fork. With It is located north of Mooresville on Kentucky Route 458. During the 2015-2017 restoration of the Beech Fork Bridge it was determined by the contractor, Arnold M. Graton Associates of Ashland, New Hampshire, that the arches were a very early modification to the bridge. As such, Beech Fork is now correctly classified as a Multiple Kingpost Truss with added arches. Beech Fork, Mooresville, and Mount Zion are all accepted names for the bridge. Mount Zion appears to be the most used historic name. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Alien, Richard S. Covered Bridges of the South.
