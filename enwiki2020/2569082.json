The artist Salvador Dal\u00ed lived at the Castle of P\u00fabol; in 1982, he was named \"Marquis of Dal\u00ed of P\u00fabol\" (spa., \"Marqu\u00e9s de Dal\u00ed de P\u00fabol\"). In fact Salvador Dal\u00ed did not live there, he bought the castle for his wife, Gala, who lived there and granted him to visit her, only when she wanted. After Gala died in 1982 at P\u00fabol where she rests in her crypt, Dal\u00ed refused to leave the premises, but he had to be hospitalized, lived at his museum in Figueres for a while and died in a clinic in Barcelona in 1989. The Castle of P\u00fabol is a museum now. It contains many works of art by Salvador Dal\u00ed. P\u00fabol, along with Cadaqu\u00e9s and Figueres, forms the so-called \"Dalinian Triangle\".
