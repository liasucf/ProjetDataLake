    "text": "The Thomas M. Babington House was built in about 1900. It is a one-story vernacular Colonial Revival building which has some Queen Anne details. Colonial Revival details include its Tuscan gallery columns. It was used for a number of years as a hospital and then as a medical clinic. The house was home of Thomas Babington, one of four Babington brothers important in Franklinton history for their efforts, eventually successful, to secure a railway to be built into the town. with photo and map ==See also== *Robert H.
