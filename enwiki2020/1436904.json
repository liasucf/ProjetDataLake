    "text": "\"One Love\" is a non-album single by The Stone Roses. The single was released in the UK, U.S., Australia, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Spain, and France, peaking at #4 in the Roses' home country of the UK, their highest charting single up until that time. \"One Love\" has appeared on the compilation albums Turns into Stone, The Complete Stone Roses and The Very Best of The Stone Roses. The song was used in an episode of the popular British television series Shameless. In the scene in which the song appears, Frank Gallagher is seen dancing in the pub with his shirt over his head as he is drunk and high on ecstasy. It is believed that John Squire played a Custom Fender Jaguar guitar with a variety of flanging and wahwah effect pedals to create the song's distinctive sound. Ian Brown on \"One Love\": \"The chorus wasn't strong enough. We tried for an anthem. We wanted to cover all bases and ended up covering none.\" ==Track listing== ===UK release=== ;7\" vinyl (Silvertone ORE 17) # \"One Love\" \u2013 (3:35) # \"Something's Burning\" \u2013 (7:50) ;12\" vinyl (Silvertone ORE T 17) Cassette (Silvertone ORE C 17) CD (Silvertone ORE CD 17) # \"One Love\" \u2013 (7:45) # \"Something's Burning\" \u2013 (7:50) ===US release=== ;12\" vinyl (Silvertone 1399-1-JD) Cassette (Silvertone 1399-4-JS) CD digipak (Silvertone 1399-2-JS) # \"One Love\" \u2013 (7:45) # \"Something's Burning\" \u2013 (7:50) # \"One Love\" (7\" version) \u2013 (3:35) ===Japanese release=== ;CD (Silvertone/Alfa ALCB-103) Track 3 incorrectly listed as \"Something' Burning\" # \"One Love\" \u2013 (3:35) # \"One Love\" (12\" version) \u2013 (7:45) # \"Something's Burning\" \u2013 (7:50) ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" !Chart (1990) !Peak position |- |- |} ==External links== *The Definitive Stone Roses Discography entry Category:1990 singles Category:The Stone Roses songs Category:Song recordings produced by John Leckie Category:Songs written by John Squire Category:1990 songs ",
