    "text": "Everybody's in Show-Biz is the eleventh studio album released by English rock group the Kinks, released in 1972. A double album, the first disc features studio recordings, while the second disc documents a two-night Carnegie Hall stand. Everybody's in Show-Biz is often seen by fans as a transition album for the Kinks, marking the change in Ray Davies' songwriting style toward more theatrical, campy and vaudevillian work, as evidenced by the rock-opera concept albums that followed it. This album marks Davies' explorations of the trials of rock-star life and the monotony of touring, themes that would reappear in future releases like The Kinks Present A Soap Opera and the 1987 live album Live: The Road. On 3 June 2016, a Legacy Edition was released, with disc 1 containing the original stereo album (studio and live tracks) and disc 2 containing bonus tracks including previously unreleased live tracks from the Carnegie Hall concerts, alternate mixes and studio outtakes. (Disc 2 tracks 6-10 were recorded on the other night of the two-night Carnegie Hall stand; Disc 2 track 14 is a previously-unreleased outtake; and Disc 2 tracks 1 and 12 are the same as those bonus tracks on the 1998 reissue.) ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Ray Davies - lead vocals, acoustic guitar, resonator guitar *Dave Davies - lead guitar, slide guitar, banjo, backing vocals, 12-string acoustic guitar on \"Celluloid Heroes\", lead vocal on \"You Don't Know My Name\" *John Dalton - bass guitar, backing vocals *Mick Avory - drums *John Gosling - keyboards *Alan Holmes - saxophone, clarinet *Mike Cotton - trumpet *John Beecham - trombone, tuba *Dave Rowberry - organ on \"Celluloid Heroes\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:The Kinks albums Category:1972 albums Category:RCA Records albums Category:Albums produced by Ray Davies Category:Albums recorded at Morgan Sound Studios Category:Rock albums by English artists ",
