    "text": "Leopold Lummerstorfer (born 1968 in Gramastetten, Austria) is an Austrian film director, author and producer. He resides in Vienna and near Kapuv\u00e1r. Leopold Lummerstorfer is one of the younger directors of the new Austrian cinema. As early as 19, he made his first long film \u201cMy Country in Pink\u201d, an adventurous feature with underground, cult character. He studied ethnology and philosophy at the University of Vienna, worked in very diverse occupations such as road construction worker, journalist, estate manager, long-distance heating supervisor and youth social worker. Parallel to this, he made a set of short features as well as documentary films, including \u201cThe Dream That Remains\u201d, a film \u201cthat goes from a social study to a gentle, true satire without much effort. A surprise success for domestic cinema, in artistic value and in public numbers and a politically alert as well as amusing film\u201d (Die Presse). His films usually highlight a social focus, which he brings to the screen, documentarily or fictionally, by means of accurate narrative structure. His last feature, \u201cWhite Cherries\u201d (with Martin Puntigam, Josef Hader, and Maria Hofst\u00e4tter), was acclaimed as the, up to then, most successful new generation film in Austrian cinema. His work has received numerous festival invitations (among others, San Francisco, S\u00e3o Paulo, Saarbruecken, Istanbul, Cin\u00e9ma du r\u00e9el Paris) and awards. Leopold Lummerstorfer lives in Vienna, where he also now regularly directs the ORF feature, \u201cShow without a Name\u201d, an individual youth format with most satisfying viewer numbers, also above the 50. == Films == * 2005: \"Deaf-mute lane\", short, 4min.
