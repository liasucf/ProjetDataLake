    "text": "Paros National Airport is the airport serving the island of Paros, Greece, in the Cyclades islands region. The airport is located in the southwestern part of the island, about from the port of Parikia. It replaced the Old Paros National Airport on 25 July 2016. ==History== The old airport of Paros, which was situated a few kilometers to the south, was operational since 1982. Its 710-meter runway was sufficient for its time, but over years, passenger numbers grew making the use of larger aircraft necessary. Although these aircraft could serve various Greek airports, Paros airport was not one of them. The reason was that it had a short runway. It was finally decided that there should be a new airport for the island. The new airport opened in 2016 taking over all operations of the old airport. It has a wider, 1,400 meter runway and larger aircraft can use it. The types that fly to the airport currently are the following: Bombardier Dash 8 Q400 of Olympic Air, ATR 42/72 of Sky Express (Greece), BAe 146 & ATR 42/72 of Astra Airlines and B737-700 of Travel Service. Since 8 June 2018, Smartwings, a Czech charter airline, is the first operator to regularly fly with a medium-sized jet to Paros. The flight is operated with a fuel stop at Santorini Airport on the return leg, due to no fuel being available at Paros. Olympic Air, a subsidiary of Aegean Airlines, financed both the construction of the first phase of the terminal and the infrastructure works for the new airport. ==Airlines and destinations== ==Ground transportation== Other than car, the airport is linked to the city of Parikia by bus from the nearby bus station. There are also taxis available to any destination on the island. ==See also== *Transport in Greece ==References== ==External links== *Hellenic Civil Aviation Authority \u2013 Paros Airport *Greek Airports Guide \u2013 Paros Airport *Greek Airports \u2013 Paros National Airport Category:Airports in Greece Category:Buildings and structures in Paros Category:2016 establishments in Greece Category:Airports established in 2016 ",
