There, he met a monk by the name of German (Herman), who had lived in the woods in solitude. German agreed to accompany Savvaty on his voyage to the island and stay there with him. When they reached the island, they erected a cross and a hermit's cell some 13 km from today's Solovetsky Monastery. After Savvaty's death, newly arrived monks began the construction of the monastery which would come to be known as Solovetsky. Since 1547, Savvaty is venerated as a saint by the Russian Orthodox Church. == References == Category:1435 deaths Category:Russian saints of the Eastern Orthodox Church Category:White Sea Category:Russian Orthodox monks Category:15th-century Christian saints Category:Year of birth unknown ",
