    "text": "__NOTOC__ Brihthelm or Beorhthelm was a Bishop of Selsey. According to a South Saxon charter, supposedly from 956, Brihthelm received a grant of land from a King Eadwig; however, the charter (S.616) is likely to have been a later forgery, although probably based on a genuine contemporary document.Anglo- Saxons.net Charters S616 accessed on 25 August 2007Kelly Charters of Selsey pp. 80-84 A charter (S.1291) issued by Brihthelm in 957, pertaining to the restoration of lands seized around Selsey by a certain \u00c6lfsige, is also thought to be suspicious, but again it is probable that a genuine contemporary document lies behind it.Anglo-Saxons.net Charters 1291 accessed on 25 August 2007Kelly Charters of Selsey pp. 87-91 Brihthelm died between 956 and 963, or he may have been transferred to Winchester around then.Fryde, et al.
