    "text": "The Rugby Challenge \u2013 known as the SuperSport Rugby Challenge for sponsorship reasons \u2013 is the secondary domestic rugby union competition in South Africa. The competition is organised by the South African Rugby Union and featured all fourteen South African provincial unions plus n side the and the Zimbabwe Academy. The inaugural season of the competition was in 2017, set up as the long-term successor of the Vodacom Cup competition. The competition is played at roughly the same time as Super Rugby each season, and features a combination of Super Rugby players returning from injury, reserve players attempting to maintain their fitness levels and younger players trying to break through to the Super Rugby or Currie Cup sides. It therefore serves as an important developmental competition for South African rugby. ==Format== The sixteen teams are geographically divided into two sections \u2013 a North Section and a Southern Section. Each team would play the other teams in their section once during the regular season, either at home or away. Some fixtures were moved to a neutral venue as part of a \"SuperStack\" initiative, where three matches--including a local amateur club match--were played at one site, with free entry available at these festivals to help promote rugby amongst all social strata. The winner and runner-up of each section would qualify to the Quarter Finals, along with the two third-placed teams with the best records. ==Teams== The teams that compete in the Rugby Challenge are: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; width:50%;\" |- ! colspan=\"100%\" | Northern Section |- ! width=\"40%\" | Team ! width=\"60%\" | Sponsored name |- | || Vodacom Blue Bulls XV |- | || Hino Valke |- | || Xerox Golden Lions XV |- | || Down Touch Griffons |- | || Tafel Lager Griquas |- | || Leopards |- | || Steval Pumas |- | || Windhoek Draught Welwitschias |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; width:50%;\" |- ! colspan=\"100%\" align=center | Southern Section |- ! width=\"40%\" | Team ! width=\"60%\" | Sponsored name |- | || Boland Cavaliers |- | || Border Bulldogs |- | || Eastern Province Elephants |- | || Toyota Free State XV |- | || Cell C Sharks XV |- | || SWD Eagles |- | || DHL Western Province |- | Zimbabwe Academy || Zimbabwe Academy |} ===Finals=== The results of the finals played in the Rugby Challenge competition are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left; width:50%\" |- ! colspan=4 | Rugby Challenge finals |- ! style=\"width:10%;\" | Season ! style=\"width:40%;\" | Winner ! style=\"width:10%;\" | Score ! style=\"width:40%;\" | Runner-Up |- | style=\"text- align:center\" | 2017 || || style=\"text-align:center\" | 28\u201319 || |- | style=\"text-align:center\" | 2018 || || style=\"text-align:center\" | 32\u201330 || |- | style=\"text-align:center\" | 2019 || || style=\"text-align:center\" | 28\u201313 || |} ===Overall Record=== The overall record for the teams in the Rugby Challenge competition is as follows: {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:50%;\" |- ! colspan=6 | Rugby Challenge overall record |- ! style=\"width:40%;\" | Team Name ! style=\"width:15%;\" | Champions ! style=\"width:15%;\" | Runner-Up ! style=\"width:15%;\" | Semi-Final ! style=\"width:15%;\" | Quarter Final |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 1 || 2 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 1 || 1 || 0 || 1 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | || 1 || 0 || 1 || 1 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 1 || 1 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text- align:left\" | || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |- | style=\"text-align:left\" | Zimbabwe Academy || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 |} ==See also== * Currie Cup * Vodacom Cup ==References== Category:Rugby union competitions for provincial teams Category:2017 establishments in South Africa Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2017 Category:Professional sports leagues in South Africa ",
