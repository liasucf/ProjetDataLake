Strabo says that the Peneius passed by the cities of Tricca, Pelinnaeum and Pharcadon, on its left, on its course to Atrax and Larissa. The town is attested as \u1f0e\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2 in the nominative in a catalog of theorodokoi of Epidaurus,IG iv2.1 94.b.3. dating from 363-359 BCE.Perlman, P. (2000).

In the 5th century BCE, the acropolis and the slope of the hill were enclosed in a polygonal enclosure. In the 4th century BCE the acropolis was rebuilt: a quadrangular tower was built and fortified with a new wall with five towers, one of them with a fortified gate. The eastern part of the wall of the hill was reinforced in the 4th century BCE, And bears similarity to the defensive constructions of Halos. The lower part was enclosed in the 4th century BCE by an opus isodomum wall with four quadrangular towers. It was long and surrounded an area of . The main gate was in the northwest, and was accessed by a polygonal stone ramp. During the food crisis of 330-326 BCE Atrax received 10,000 medimnoi of wheat from Cyrene, in Africa.Tod, M. N.
