    "text": "The 2000 MTV Movie Awards were hosted by Sarah Jessica Parker. In conjunction with the success of Sex and the City, the awards show presented a parody of Sex and the City and The Matrix during the program's opening. It featured the SATC cast (Samantha Jones, Miranda Hobbes, and Charlotte York) as they listened intently as Carrie Bradshaw (Parker's character on the series) describes getting caught in the Matrix, which is shown in flashbacks and in the narration style heard usually on the TV series. Laurence Fishburne appeared in the spoof in a creative superimposition from the film, as well as Vince Vaughn (playing the supposed \"White Rabbit\") and Jimmy Fallon, who played Keanu Reeves's character, Neo, from the film. Also, it noted Parker's status as a fashion icon by appearing in no less than 15 different costumes during the duration of the awards ceremonies, even appearing in nothing but a bath towel. ==Performers== *D'Angelo \u2014 \"Devil's Pie\" *NSYNC \u2014 \"It's Gonna Be Me\" *Metallica \u2014 \"I Disappear\" ==Presenters== *Amy Smart and Tom Green \u2014 presented Best On-Screen Duo *Mena Suvari and Jason Biggs \u2014 presented Best Kiss *George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg \u2014 presented Best Villain *Seth Green and Q-Tip \u2014 introduced D'Angelo *Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx \u2014 presented Breakthrough Female *Lucy Liu and Ice Cube \u2014 presented Best Fight *Aaliyah and Freddie Prinze Jr. \u2014 presented Best Action Sequence *Rebecca Romijn and Halle Berry \u2014 presented Best Musical Sequence *Sarah Michelle Gellar and Chris Klein \u2014 presented Breakthrough Male *Denise Richards and Marlon Wayans \u2014 introduced NSYNC *Samuel L.
