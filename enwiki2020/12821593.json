    "text": "El amor brujo (Love, the Magician, or Wedded by Witchcraft) or Carlos Saura Dance Trilogy, Part 3: El Amor Brujo is a 1986 Spanish musical film written and directed by Carlos Saura. It was directed and choreographed in the flamenco style by Maria Pag\u00e8s. It is the third part of the Saura's flamenco trilogy he made in the 1980s, after Bodas de sangre in 1981 and Carmen in 1983. The film was screened out of competition at the 1986 Cannes Film Festival. The film is based on El amor brujo composed by Manuel de Falla. ==Plot summary== Candela, who is loved by Carmelo, marries Jos\u00e9 in a pre- arranged marriage decided by their respective fathers. Jos\u00e9 is in love with the flirtatious Luc\u00eda and dies defending her honor. Carmelo is mistakenly arrested for the killing, and spends several years in prison. After being released, he declares his love for Candela. Although Candela is now \"free\" to marry Carmelo she is haunted (and obsessed) by the ghost of Jos\u00e9, who reappears every night to dance with her. Candela, while speaking with Luc\u00eda, learns that Jos\u00e9 pursued her even after he married Candela. She renounces him, but is unable to shake his hold on her. T\u00eda Rosario provides the solution - Lucia must dance with Jos\u00e9, an act which will exorcise his ghost forever. (It is never made clear if Luc\u00eda actually gives up her life to join him, but she never reappears in the film after their dance scene.) ==Soundtrack== The film fleshed out the story with spoken dialogue and several songs, but used the entire score of the ballet. The Orquesta Nacional de Espa\u00f1a was conducted by Jes\u00fas L\u00f3pez-Cobos. The singer heard on the soundtrack was the late Roc\u00edo Jurado. A soundtrack album, now out of print, was issued by EMI. ==Cast== *Antonio Gades ... Carmelo *Cristina Hoyos ... Candela *Laura del Sol ... Luc\u00eda *Juan Antonio Jim\u00e9nez...
