    "text": "Who Bombed Judi Bari? is an American historical documentary about an assassination attempt on the life of Judi Bari, an American environmental and labor activist, which occurred on May 24, 1990. The film premiered at the 2012 Santa Rosa International Film Festival. ==Overview== While driving through Oakland, California on their way to a benefit concert for the Redwood Summer campaign to save California's coast redwood trees, Judi Bari and Darryl Cherney were injured when a pipe bomb detonated under the driver's seat of their car. Bari, who was driving, was critically injured. Oakland police and the FBI approached the explosion as a terrorist incident, arrested Bari and Cherney, and tried to prove that they were transporting their own explosive device which accidentally detonated. The two were never charged with a crime. In 2002 they won a lawsuit and were awarded $4.4 million for civil rights violations by the FBI and Oakland Police Department. The authorities allegedly did not investigate any other suspects. Discovery during the lawsuit revealed crime scene photos that clearly showed the bomb was located under Bari's seat, not in the back seat as investigators had alleged. In 2012, a federal judge ordered the FBI not to destroy another pipe bomb that had only partially detonated at a lumber mill about a week before the car bombing, which investigators agreed had been built by the same bomber. Attorney for Darryl Cherney, Ben Rosenfeld, had requested that an outside lab perform DNA testing on the Cloverdale bomb, which the FBI claimed it had never performed, a request which the judge upheld. ==Awards== * CINE Golden Eagle Award (Documentary Feature 2012) * Long Island Film Festival (Special Jury Award 2012) * Malibu International Film Festival (Best Documentary 2012) * Best Documentary (Santa Cruz Film Festival 2012) * Best Documentary (Desert Rocks Film Festival 2012) * Best Feature Film (Davis Film Festival 2012) ==References== ==External links== * Official website * * Film trailer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RsQrdsCtZ-Y#t=122 Category:2010s documentary films Category:American documentary films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:2012 films Category:Documentary films about law in the United States Category:Documentary films about United States history Category:Documentary films about California ",
