    "text": "The 2016\u2013present purges in Turkey is a series of purges by the government of Turkey enabled by a state of emergency in reaction to the 15 July failed coup d'\u00e9tat. The purges began with the arrest of Turkish Armed Forces personnel reportedly linked to the coup attempt but arrests were expanded to include other elements of the Turkish military, as well as civil servants and private citizens. These later actions reflected a power struggle between secularist and Islamist political elites in Turkey, affected people who were not active in nor aware of the coup, but who the government claimed were connected with the G\u00fclen movement, an opposition group which the government blamed for the coup. Possession of books authored by G\u00fclen was considered valid evidence of such a connection and cause for arrest. Tens of thousands of public servants and soldiers were purged in the first week following the coup. For example, on 16 July 2016, just one day after the coup was foiled, 2,745 judges were dismissed and detained. This was followed by the dismissal, detention or suspension of over 100,000 officials, a figure that had increased to over 110,000 by early November 2016, over 125,000 after the 22 November decree, reaching at least 135,000 with the January decrees, about 160,000 after the suspensions and arrests decree of April 29th and 180,000 after a massive dismissal decree in July 2018. Collectively about 10% of Turkey's 2 million public employees were removed as a result of the purges. Purged citizens are prevented from working again for the government, therefore pushed into precarity and economic death.https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-07-23/expulsions-pushbacks-and- extraditions-turkey-s-war-dissent-extends-europe In the business sector, the government forcefully seized assets of over 1000 companies worth between $11 and $50\u201360 billion, on the charge of being related to G\u00fclen and the coup. By late 2017 over a thousand companies and their assets owned by individuals reportedly affiliated with the movement had been seized and goods and services produced by such companies were subject to boycott by the public. The purges also extend to the media with television channels, newspapers and other media outlets that were seen as critical of the government being shut down, critical journalists being arrested and the 2017 block of Wikipedia in Turkey, which lasted from April 2017 to January 2020. Since early September 2016, the post- coup emergency state allowed a turn against Kurdish groups and Kurdish culture, including the dismissal of over 11,000 Kurdish teachers and dozens of elected mayors and arrest of the co-chairs of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) for alleged links with the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). In August 2018, the Turkish Parliament approved a new \u201canti-terror\u201d law to replace the state of emergency. == Background == In January 2014, during a major corruption inquiry in Turkey, 96 judges and prosecutors, including the chief prosecutor of \u0130zmir, Huseyin Bas, were transferred to new locations, ending the investigations. Bas was transferred to Samsun. Altogether 120 judges and prosecutors were reassigned. At the time, The Daily Telegraph described the events as \"the biggest purge of the judiciary in [Turkey's] history\". From 2014 to mid-2016, repeated purges of civilian, military and judicial officials took place in Turkey, mainly aimed at followers of Fethullah G\u00fclen, a former colleague of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. == Sectors affected == During the first post-coup speech Erdo\u011fan could address to the nation upon landing at Atat\u00fcrk airport, he said, \"This uprising is a gift from God to us because this will be a reason to cleanse our army\". An extensive purge of the Turkish civil service began with Erdo\u011fan warning his opponents that \"they will pay a heavy price for this.\" The New York Times described the purges as a \"counter-coup\" and expected Erdo\u011fan to \"become more vengeful and obsessed with control than ever, exploiting the crisis not just to punish mutinous soldiers but to further quash whatever dissent is left in Turkey\". On 18 July, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged Turkish authorities to halt the increasing crackdown on its citizens, indicating that the crackdown was meant to \"suppress dissent\". French Foreign Minister and former Prime Minister Jean- Marc Ayrault voiced concern, warning against a \"political system which turns away from democracy\". The United Nations have been reported of being unresponsive against the purges, while at the same time also failing to condemn the coup and resulting violence, due to disagreement between Egypt and other Security Council members on the wording of a resolution in that direction. === Military === General Bekir Ercan Van (far left), the commander of Incirlik Air Base, was stated of complicity in the attempted coup. Prime Minister Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announced on 16 July 2016 that 2,839 soldiers of various ranks had been arrested. Among those arrested were at least 34 generals or admirals. A number of students of the Kuleli Military High School, enough to fill five buses, were also arrested. By 18 July 2016, a total of 103 generals and admirals have been detained by Turkish authorities in connection with the coup. Yasemin \u00d6zata \u00c7etinkaya, the governor of Sinop Province, was removed from her duty and her husband, a colonel in the Turkish army, arrested. Turkish military conducted a raid on the Turkish Air Force Academy in Istanbul as well. Major General Cahit Bakir, who commanded Turkish forces under NATO in Afghanistan, and Brigadier General Sener Topuc, responsible for education and aid in Afghanistan, have been detained by authorities in Dubai in connection with Turkey's failed coup. General Bekir Ercan Van, the commander of Incirlik Air Base, which the U.S. uses to carry out airstrikes against ISIL, was arrested by Turkish authorities for his stated role in plotting the failed military coup. He sought asylum from the United States but was denied. === Police and judiciary === The building of the Turkish Court of Cassation in Ankara. On 16 July 2016, the Supreme Board of Judges and Prosecutors of Turkey (HSYK) removed 2,745 Turkish judges from duty and ordered their detention. Of these judges, 541 were in administrative judiciary and 2,204 were in criminal judiciary. This amounted to approximately 36% of all judges in Turkey at the time. Two judges from the Constitutional Court of Turkey, Alparslan Altan and , were detained by Turkish authorities for stated ties with the G\u00fclen movement, while 5 members of the HSYK had their membership revoked and 10 members of the Turkish Council of State were arrested on charges of being members of the parallel state. Furthermore, arrest warrants were issued for 48 members of the Council of State and 140 members of the Court of Cassation. By 18 July 2016, the Turkish government had suspended 8,777 government officials across the country for stated links to the coup perpetrators. Among those suspended include 7,899 police officers, 614 gendarmerie officers, 47 district governors and 30 regional governors. , 755 judges and prosecutors had been arrested in relation to the coup attempt. In January 2019, former chairman of Turkey's Judges and Prosecutors Association (YARSAV), recipient of human rights awards and judge Murat Arslan have been condemned to 10 years in prison for \"participation to a terrorist organisation\". No violent action or call for violence was reported, the statement being based on an anonymous denunciation and the presence of ByLock on his smartphone, an application he denies having installed on his phone. === Politics === Opposition politicians Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f had been arrested on terrorism charges Following the July 2016 attempt coup and first purges of the military, AKP government used the state of emergency to introduce amendments into Turkey's municipalities law. Articles 45 and 57 were introduced, which allow to remove an elected mayor from his duty. Before only a final conviction was reason enough to remove a mayor. H\u00fcseyin Avni Mutlu, ex-governor of \u0130stanbul, was dismissed on 19 July 2016. Deputy Mayor of Istanbul's \u015ei\u015fli District, Cemil Canda\u015f (tr), was shot in the head in his office by an unidentified assailant on 18 July 2016. Meanwhile, Turkish parliament was evacuated due to unidentified security concerns. === Elections and HDP harassment === In the 2014 Turkish local elections, the sister party of the HDP, the Peace and Democracy Party (BDP) won 97 district municipalities out of 1351 and 2 metropolitan municipalities out of 30. Starting in September 2016, the purges pushed upon the largely Kurdish political formations HDP and BDP. About a 1/3 of the HDP members, more than 11.000 people were detained, more than 3000 of them were formally arrested, while also 94 democratically elected mayors have been expelled from their posts. 2014's elected mayors were removed, detained, and subjected to politically motivated prosecutions. Elected mayors were replaced by government's appointees. Municipal councils were not formally dissolved, but were not gathered anymore to hold their democratic and managerial functions. In October 2018, AKP leader Erdogan vowed to seize all municipalities the HDP could win in the 2019 Turkish local elections. By March 2020, out of the 65 municipalities won by social-democrate HDP during the 2019 Turkish local elections, 46 municipalities (69%) had been seized by AKP government. The dismissal and municipal seizures are believed to be purely politically motivated, using ill-defined accusation of terrorism. Local human right activist comment that \"terrorism in Turkey [is] so vague, broad, and ambiguous that anybody critical of the government can easily be criminalized as a terrorist\" while dismissals, arrests, prosecutions, and condemnations are based on \"trumped up terrorism charges\". Since 2014, over 90 municipalities have been seized. Dismissed mayors, part of the HDP movement who repeatedly stated opposition to PKK-TSK violences, were later arrested on charges of \u201cmembership to a terror organization.\u201d These removals have been described as a violation of people's democratic vote. The at the time HDP co- heads Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Y\u00fcksekda\u011f were jailed and the prosecution was seeking up to 142 years for Demirta\u015f and 83 years for Y\u00fcksekda\u011d imprisonment. The main charge is the allegation of \"managing a terrorist organization [(the HDP)]\". As of May 2020, both politicians remain arrested. === Civil service === Following a series of arrests and purges throughout the government, Prime Minister Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m announced on 18 July 2016 that annual leave for all civil servants was suspended, and all those on leave were to return to work. Over three million civil servants were affected. In addition, public sector employees were banned from leaving the country. By the evening of 19 July 2016, the number of public sector employees suspended had reached 49,321. In the Ministry of Finance, more than 1500 employees were suspended. In the Prime Ministry, 257 employees, including six advisers, were suspended. The Presidency of Religious Affairs suspended 492 employees, among them three provincial muftis. The numbers of suspended personnel in the National Intelligence Organization and Ministry of Family and Social Policy were 100 and 393 respectively. On 20 July 2016, the Youth and Sports Minister Akif \u00c7a\u011fatay K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7 announced that 245 personnel within his ministry had been laid off. The Energy Ministry reports 300 employees were let go, and the Customs Ministry indicated 184 employees were dismissed. === Education === On 20 July 2016, Professor Vedat Demir, along with 95 colleagues at Istanbul University, were suspended from their academic positions. ;Immediate purge By far the greatest purge was in the Ministry of National Education, where 15,200 education ministry officials were suspended. The licenses of 21,000 teachers in the private sector were also cancelled. The Council of Higher Education asked all deans of state and private universities, numbering 1577, to resign. 626 educational institutions, mostly private, were shut down. For example, in Burdur, one school, one cram school and four student hostels were shut down on 20 July. In addition, a travel ban was placed on academics, preventing them from leaving the country. On 23 July 2016, Erdo\u011fan shut down 1,043 private schools, 1,229 charities and foundations, 19 trade unions, 15 universities and 35 medical institutions in his first emergency decree under the newly adopted emergency legislation. ;Forced cultural changes Academics have reported pre-2016 coup's changes in academic leadership, and sharp growing pressure after the 2013 Gezi park protests and 2016 coup. Dean and academic management have pressured professors and students to align with conservative values and teachings. Activities, associations and student clubs have been closed under similar pressure. Conservative students are empowered to denounce non- conservative activities. Academic grants and tenures are reported to be filtered according to political affiliations and connections. Teachers have reported a forced change in political, academic, and critical culture, with firing and exclusion of traditional academic profiles, with worries about the long term effect of such change and academic purge on the expertise and tone of both Turkey's researches and governmental statures, culture and policies. While private university are technically allowed to hire purged academics, many reports private university been scared to hire them, increasing the economic exclusion. Academics have been subjects to travel bans. ;Petitioners About one thousand scholars and human right experts who had earlier petitioned for the end of military operations in South East Turkey, Afrin and Syria have faced systematic punitive consequences via public agencies, including interrogations, judicial prosecutions, firing from jobs, arrests, trials and condemnations for \"terrorist propaganda\". The signatories have been subject to 2000 routine judicial hearings with usual 15 months suspended jail sentence, with no acquital reported and about 30 actual emprisonments.https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/magazine/the-era-of-people- like-you-is-over-how-turkey-purged-its-intellectuals.html === Media === Turkish journalists protesting imprisonment of their colleagues on Human Rights Day, 10 December 2016 The licenses of 24 radio and television channels and the press cards of 34 journalists reported of being linked to G\u00fclen were revoked.

On 27 July 2016, Erdo\u011fan shut down 16 television channels, 23 radio stations, 45 daily newspapers, 15 magazines and 29 publishing houses in another emergency decree under the newly adopted emergency legislation. The closed outlets include G\u00fclen-affiliated Cihan News Agency, Samanyolu TV and the previously leading newspaper Zaman (including its English-language version Today's Zaman), but also the opposition daily newspaper Taraf which was known to be in close relations with the Gulen Movement. In late October 2015, Turkish authorities shut down 15 media outlets, including one of the world's only women's news agencies, and detained the editor-in-chief of the prominent secularist Turkish newspaper Cumhuriyet, \"on accusations that they committed crimes on behalf of Kurdish militants and a network linked to the US-based cleric Fethullah G\u00fclen\".

Turkey demanded that Greece extradite eight Turkish soldiers who had fled there after the coup. On 11 August 2016, Bulgaria extradited Abdullah B\u00fcy\u00fck, a Turkish businessman being linked with the G\u00fclen movement. == Purges by numbers == U.S. Secretary of Defense alt=Mr Hagel, in a civilian suit, shakes hands with General \u00d6zt\u00fcrk, in uniform. === Initial purges === The bulk of the purges happened in the 10 days following the coup.

Accessed 24 August 2016. On 2 September 2016, Turkey announced a purge of about 11,500 teachers with stated links to PKK. The move was denounced by Kurdish and Turkish opposition parties for lacking due process and evidences. An anonymous former Turkish diplomat said the move sharply weakened the pacifist wing of Kurdish voices, pushing the Kurdish movement toward more radical means. On 12 September 2016, Turkey removed two dozen elected mayors, members of the opposition Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), for stated links to Kurdish militants. Turkish journalists Can D\u00fcndar and Erdem G\u00fcl were arrested facing sentences up to life imprisonment.

According to the Human Rights Watch, the new law \"will allow authorities under the presidency, for the next three years, to dismiss judges and all other public officials arbitrarily. It also would allow the authorities to restrict movement within Turkey, ban public assemblies, and allow police to hold some suspects for up to 12 days without charge and repeatedly detain them in the same investigation.\" CHP parliamentary group leader \u00d6zg\u00fcr \u00d6zel said that \"With this bill, with the measures in this text, the state of emergency will not be extended for three months but for three years. They make it look like they are lifting the emergency, but in fact they are continuing it.\" On 14 August 2018, Turkish police arrested another German citizen on terrorism-related charges. German authorities said nine German nationals are currently in detention in Turkey for \"political reasons.\" ==== 2019 ==== On 12 February, Turkey issued 1,112 more detention orders, under the charge of organizing the 2016 Turkey coup. According to Turkish government data from March 2019, about 500,000 people were detained since the coup attempt, of which about 30,000 were in custody at the time of the information. Erdogan reported in April 2019 of 31,000 employees of the police, as well as 15,000 members of the military, who had been removed from office since the coup d'\u00e9tat.

Turkish prosecutor opened an investigation into \"terrorist propaganda\" against MPs Sezai Temelli and Pervin Buldan, co-leaders of the pro-Kurdish HDP party. Turkey arrested at least 151 members of the HDP, including district officials. Turkish authorities have also detained web editor of opposition BirG\u00fcn newspaper and managing editor of the online news portal Diken. ==== 2020 ==== Due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Turkey, the Turkish parliament accepted a bill which could enable the release of up to 100,000 prisoners, including people responsible for deaths. Political prisoners, journalists, are excluded from the pardon despite overcrowding and unsanitary living conditions already posing severe health threat. The Turkish Interior Ministry has been arresting social media users whose posts were \"targeting officials and spreading panic and fear\" by suggesting the COVID-19 \"had spread widely in Turkey and that officials had taken insufficient measures\". Several journalists, who were each reporting for local media, were detained for how they covered the pandemic. ==Human rights== Human rights in Turkey are governed by international law treaties, including the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights that Turkey signed in 2000, that take precedence over Turkish legislation according to Article 90 of the 1982 Constitution. After protesters chanted for reintroduction of the death penalty, abolished by Turkey in 2004, Erdo\u011fan stated that this was a possibility that would be discussed in parliament, and that in a democracy, the will of the people must be respected. On 21 July, the Turkish government announced that it would suspend the European Convention on Human Rights during a temporary state of emergency. On 24 July 2016, Amnesty International called for the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture to make an emergency visit to Turkey to see the conditions in which the detainees were held. === Identification methods === Johannes Hahn, the European Commissioner dealing with Turkey's bid to become a member state of the European Union (EU), said that it appears Turkey's government had prepared arrest lists of political opponents before the coup attempt and had been waiting for the right time to act. The usage of social medias monitoring is suspected. Anonymous-and-paid denunciations are officially declared as the main source for identifying suspects. Most of the over 140 thousands people affected by the purges were affected following denunciations by coworkers and other citizens. The system have been legalized via a 31 August 2015's decree by the Ministry of interior. The rewarded anonymous denunciation's grid is public and online, divided in 5 category according to the threat, and pointing to major suspects, mainly Kurds, then Gulenist, then Islamists (ISIS). About 11 millions citizens are reported to be under investigation online. ==== Fetometer ==== Reports of a scoring system for Turkey citizens and foreigners to assess their relationships to the Gulen networks and crack down on them emerged. The system, already in use on Turkey civil public servants and some military branch, allows Turkey governments to assess the relationship of citizens to Gulenist networks and likelihood for them to be part of it. In the field of education, the Turkish National Education Ministry used a Fetometer software to assess the relation of 993 books used in teaching with a set of Gulenist phrases and concepts. 100 books were assessed \"inconvenient\", 12 were \"certainly Gulenist\" and now banned by the Ministry. The phrases and concepts looked for were dialogue, respect for human beings, the golden generation, horizon man, hope and dedication. === Detainees' conditions === presidential campaign being launched outside Edirne prison where he is incarcerated, 25 May 2018 According to Amnesty International, during the July 2016 purges, detainees were denied food for up to three days and water for up to two days, were denied medical treatment, were reportedly raped with police truncheons or fingers, and were subjected to other forms of torture. Amnesty said that three hundred male soldiers held in the Ankara police headquarters were beaten during their detention, with injuries including bruises, cuts and broken bones. Forty soldiers were unable to walk because of their injuries, and two were unable to stand. Amnesty also said that detainees' shirts were covered in blood during their interrogations by prosecutors and that detainees during the purges were mostly prevented from contacting their families and lawyers.

AKP's political alliances with both wealthy business world via privileged and urban poor via redistribution of public resources, providing non-competitive elections, reduced elected officials political tolerance for oppositions and reduced the costs of cracking down on them. This AKP-hegemonic political landscape, associated calculations and observable room for repressive actions lead to increase authoritarianism from AKP government through \"securitization of dissent, mounting repression, and systematic violation of civil liberties\". Turkey is described as a case of \"competitive authoritarianism\", a regime in which democratic elections occurs under the guidance of an authoritarian government and main party guaranteed to win. ==See also== *List of arrested journalists in Turkey *Censorship in Turkey == References == ==External links== * Reality Check: The numbers behind the crackdown in Turkey, BBC, 18 June 2018 * https://turkeypurge.com/ - multi-lingual (including English) detailed documentation of the purges ** URLs of Turkish government decrees detailing purges Category:2016 in law Category:2016 in Turkey Category:2017 in law Category:2017 in Turkey Category:2018 in law Category:2018 in Turkey Category:2016 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat attempt Turkish purges Category:Human rights abuses in Turkey Category:Judiciary of Turkey Turkish purges Category:Political and cultural purges Category:Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan Category:Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan controversies Category:Turkish law Category:Transitional justice Category:Ongoing events ",
