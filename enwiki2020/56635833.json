In 1686, S\u00e1nchez de Mathos owned six slaves, making it likely he was a landowner or cattle rancher and used slave labor to tend to the land or his cattle.Eli D.

As a result, the island was divided into two political regions\u2014one based in San Juan and a second one based in San German. As years went by the political influence of the partido de San German grew to the point that it challenged that of San Juan. To reign in the growing influence from San German and maintain control over the entire island, in 1678-1683, Governor Juan Robles de Lorenzana attempted to establish additional administrative units, called partidos, carving some of them, including the one for Ponce, out of the San German jurisdiction. The plan was unsuccessful, as the governor's term came to a close and no one was interested in serving as the head of such new Partido de Ponce.Eli D. Oquendo Rodriguez. \"De Criadero a Partido: Ojeada a la Historia de los Origenes de Ponce, 1645-1810.\" Editorial Akelarre. 2015. Page 18.) In 1690, a new governor, Gaspar de Arredondo y Valle, sent a letter the Real Audiencia of the Indies in Santo Domingo where he proposed the creation of five new administrative units, including one in Ponce. As the letter went unanswered, in 1692 the governor proceeded to create, not five administrative units, but five military units, which would be headed by a military officer who would function as mayor and have powers for civilian oversight as well. In 1692, during the governorship of Gaspar de Arredondo y Valle, the Spanish Crown officially gave its blessing to the creation of the Partido de Ponce, but Ponce was already operating with a military commander functioning as a mayor, Pedro S\u00e1nchez de Mathos.Ponce: Notas para su Historia (Second Edition).

Accessed 19 February 2018. ==Mayoral term== Given that S\u00e1nchez de Mathos was already functioning as Teniente a guerra in the jurisdiction of Ponce since December 1685, the creation of the Partido de Ponce was more of an official confirmation of his position than an appointment to a newly created position.Eli D. Oquendo Rodriguez. De Criadero a Partido: Ojeada de la Historia de los Or\u00edgenes de Ponce, 1645-1810. First Edition.
