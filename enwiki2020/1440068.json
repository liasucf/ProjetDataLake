    "text": "According to the Hebrew Bible, the Zuzim or Zuzites (meaning \"restless\" or \"roaming\") were a tribe who lived in Ham, a land east of the Jordan River between Bashan and Moab. The Zuzim were conquered by the Elamite King Chedorlaomer (Genesis 14:5). Many scholars identify the Zuzim with the Zamzummim (Deuteronomy 2:20), a tribe of the Rephaim living in the same region as the Zuzim and later occupied by the Ammonites. In Hebrew \"Zuz\" represents the root \"z'z\" which means, \"to move\" and is likely associated with the Ancient Egyptian \"s's\" meaning, \"to move on foot\" as in the \"ssw\" or Shasu. The Shasu and Zuzim may be one and the same if one considers their close proximity to the Horites \"Kharu\" and Hebrews \"Habiru\" as they are described in Egyptian lists.
