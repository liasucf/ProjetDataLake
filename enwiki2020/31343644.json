It has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to the exposed Early Carboniferous geological formations on the site. It was used for about seven years for dumping of toxic waste including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and was capped in 2011. ==Pollution== Brofiscin Quarry is privately owned, and was leased to waste contractors for use as a landfill, as is common with spent quarries.

We expect to make further progress on this matter in the next few months. If this approach is unsuccessful, we have the power to carry out the work needed ourselves and recover our costs.
