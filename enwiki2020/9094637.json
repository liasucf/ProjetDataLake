    "text": "The crossbow often has a complicated legal status due to its potential use for lethal purposes, and its similarities with both firearms and other archery weapons. The crossbow is, for technical purposes, often categorized as a firearm by various legal jurisdictions, despite the fact that no combustion is required to propel the projectile. This is a list of laws concerning crossbows by country. In some nations crossbows are not subject to any specific regulation, in most there are laws, which differ widely. Each jurisdiction has its own definition of a crossbow, and in some cases pistol-sized crossbows are treated differently. There may be minimum ages for possession, and sales of both crossbows and bolts may be restricted. Specific rules around hunting use are also common. Some jurisdictions require permits and background checks similar to those required for firearms. ==Australia== Pistol crossbows are strictly controlled in all Australian states due to their concealable nature. Crossbows can be bought and owned by adults over 18 years of age, while in most states crossbows can only be owned with a special licence, for instance for members of an official sporting club. Control on transport of crossbows between states has increased to prevent unauthorised use of imported crossbows.Ausbow Industries - Australian crossbow manufacturer and agent for Excalibur crossbow Recent changes to laws in Western Australia to prohibit crossbow ownership require applications to legally possess a crossbow by July 2, 2011 before they became illegal to possess and sporting usage is only legal for people currently participating in the sport at the date of the laws introduction and does not apply to or allow for new participants thereafter. ==Bulgaria== In Bulgaria crossbows are not regulated, but their use for fishing and hunting is explicitly prohibited. ==Canada== In Canada, crossbows are not classified as a firearm and can be acquired or manufactured by or sold to anyone over 18 years of age. According to the Criminal Code, barrelled weapons launching a projectile at a muzzle velocity not exceeding are also not considered firearmshttps://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-20.html. This ensures no licence is required to purchase a crossbow, unless it is barrelled and launches projectiles at a velocity exceeding . Though older PAL cards say that one is allowed to acquire one, the laws designating them as firearms were struck down before they could be implemented. Crossbows designed to be fired with one hand and crossbows measuring less than 500 mm in length are prohibited.http://www.rcmp-grc.gc.ca/cfp-pcaf/faq/index-eng.htm Some municipalities also have bylaws prohibiting the discharging and/or possession of firearms within city limits, and those laws usually define bows, crossbows, and slingshots as firearms. Hunting in Canada is regulated at the provincial level, therefore the legality of crossbow hunting vary from province to province. ==Czech Republic== Crossbows and other mechanical weapons with drawing force under are not regulated. Mechanical weapons above this limit are class D weapons, which means they can only be used or owned by a person at least 18 years of age (no license is required) and can't be worn visibly in public. They can only be used at places not accessible to public (without posing a risk to health or property), at licensed shooting ranges and at visibly marked places oversighted by a designated person. ==Denmark== In Denmark, the creation, import or possession of crossbows without a license is prohibited by Danish law on weapons (V\u00e5benloven - Bekendtg\u00f8relse af lov om v\u00e5ben og eksplosivstoffer), and crossbows are not recognized as legal weapons for hunting. ==Finland== In Finland, crossbows are banned for hunting.

Because of their definition as weapons, but without further restrictions, any crossbows can be used by minors under custody of competent adults. Fishing and hunting with crossbows is prohibited. As a specialty to be noted is that, crossbows do not shoot as per legal definition in Germany, since they don't use expanding gases or similar mechanisms to propel a projectile. ==Netherlands== In the Netherlands crossbows are regulated by the \"wet weapons en munitie\" (law on weapons and ammunition). Crossbows and crossbow bolts are placed in category 4, along with bows, swords, spears, etc. It is legal to possess weapons from this category providing that the individual is over 18. It is not allowed to carry those weapons in public. When transporting, the weapon should be packaged in a way that one has to perform at least 3 actions before the weapon is ready for use (this does not include the steps required to actually load and fire the weapon). Only on special occasions such as re- enactment events this is not strictly enforced. Crossbows should be used only for collecting, re-enactment or sportive purposes. Hunting with crossbows (or bows) is strictly prohibited in the Netherlands under animal cruelty laws. ==Norway== In Norway, crossbows are considered equivalent to firearms, and possession requires a license (Innf\u00f8rsel og utf\u00f8rsel av v\u00e5pen, Tollvesenet).

Hunting with crossbows is not allowed. Swedish law dictates that any weapon that stores its energy, i.e., weapons with a firing mechanism, that produces more than at the muzzle are illegal without licence. Thus very weak crossbows are sold in toy stores as well as low powered air rifles (not sold to minors). Sale or possession of normal bows of any strength are regulated in the same way as the previously mentioned weak crossbows and air rifles. ==United Kingdom== No licence or registration is required to own a crossbow in the United Kingdom. Under the Crossbows Act 1987, crossbows cannot be bought or sold in England, Wales or Scotland by or to those under 18. Possession is also prohibited by those under 18 years old except under adult supervision. The act states that crossbows may be used by persons under 18 years of age only when supervised by a person aged 21 years old or over.Office of Public Sector Information - Crossbows Act 1987 Similar prohibitions for Northern Ireland are made in the Crossbows (Northern Ireland) Order 1988. Section 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 prevents their use for hunting birds. In Scotland, section 50 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 Section 50 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 makes it illegal to be drunk in a public place in possession of a crossbow.
