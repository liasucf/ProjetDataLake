Relatively little urban development took place to the west of the railway, but the marshalling yards and other installations were labour-intensive and housing for railway workers and their families spread from the vicinity of the North station almost to Walton. The Great Northern built an entire community here, which provided much of the labour for the enormous marshalling yard and associated engine sheds close by.Brandon, David and Knight, John Peterborough Past: The City and The Soke (p.43) Phillimore & Co., Chichester, 2001 The area falls within the ecclesiastical parish of Saint Paul and a Victorian church was erected at the Triangle in 1869.
