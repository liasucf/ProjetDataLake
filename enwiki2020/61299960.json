    "text": "Old Mortality The Vault of the Jacques Auguste Regnier, sometimes given as Auguste Jacques (26 August 1787, Paris - 2 June 1860, Paris) was a French artist who painted in the Romantic style. He also helped introduce the Troubadour style and was heavily influenced by English literature. == Biography == He was trained at the school of Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, where he was a student of Jean-Victor Bertin, who influenced him to become a painter of landscapes and historical scenes. He began exhibiting at the Salon in 1812 and travelled widely throughout France; visiting Auvergne, Dauphin\u00e9, Normandy and Picardy. Following these travels, he produced rural scenes that attracted the attention of the Duchess of Berry and Louis-Philippe I. In addition to these scenes, he produced works illustrating the history of France; notably a depiction of Joan of Arc, swearing her devotion to the salvation of France, which is now at the Palais de Fontainebleau, and works inspired by literature; Walter Scott in particular. His \"Old Mortality\" is on display at the Louvre. He was, in fact, generally an enthusiast for the Anglomania that developed in France in the 1830s; becoming a member of the circle that surrounded Richard Parkes Bonington, and was one of the first French artists to become interested in the works of John Constable. His friend, Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, subsequently became a great admirer of Constable after Regnier presented him with some lithographs from his collection.Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Journal, p. 106, Nouvelle \u00e9dition int\u00e9grale \u00e9tablie par Mich\u00e8le Hannoosh, \u00ab Domaine romantique \u00bb, \u00c9ditions Corti, 2009. He was also influenced by the young Victor Hugo, and was inspired to pursue his romantic vision of Old Paris. In 1825, with the help of his student, Jean-Jacques Champin, he began creating an illustrated book on the subject, which would be called Vues pittoresques des principaux ch\u00e2teaux et des maisons de plaisance des environs de Paris et des d\u00e9partements lithographi\u00e9 par Auguste Regnier. This was followed by La Seine et ses abords (1836), Habitations des personnages les plus c\u00e9l\u00e8bres de France depuis 1790 jusqu'\u00e0 nos jours and Promenade dans les rues de Paris, Dessins d\u2019Auguste Regnier, Lithographi\u00e9s Jean Jacques Champin. Notices de Charles Nodier (1838). As a result, he was named a Chevalier in the Legion of Honor in 1837 and received commissions from King Louis-Philippe to do illustrations of the and the Ch\u00e2teau de Versailles. Despite this success with the aristocracy, he fell victim to the increasing fashion for Realism and his career effectively came to an end together with the July Monarchy in 1848. == References == == Further reading == * V\u00e9ronique Miltgen, Peintures du XIXe si\u00e8cle 1800-1914, Mus\u00e9e des beaux-arts de Tours, 2001. * Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, Journal, new edition, restored by Mich\u00e8le Hannoosh, \u00c9ditions Corti, 2009, pgs.106 and 2314 == External links == * More works by Regnier @ ArtNet * \"Jacques Auguste Regnier\", works @ L'Agence Photo * \"Jacques Auguste Regnier\" @ the Base Joconde.
