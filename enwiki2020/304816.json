    "text": "Epistemological realism is a philosophical position, a subcategory of objectivism, holding that what you know about an object exists independently of our mind.John Haldane, Crispin Wright (eds.), Reality, Representation, and Projection, Oxford University Press, 1993, p. 16. It is opposed to epistemological idealism. Epistemological realism is related directly to the correspondence theory of truth, which claims that the world exists independently and innately to our perceptions of it. Our sensory data then reflect or correspond to the innate world. ==See also== *Epistemic theories of truth *Epistemology *Philosophical realism ==References== Category:Philosophical realism Category:Epistemological theories ",
