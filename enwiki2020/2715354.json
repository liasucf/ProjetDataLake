It was described at the time as being \"at the head of that town. It consists of an arrival and departure station, both being stone buildings, and possessing all requisite offices for the accommodation of the traffic. New and convenient approaches are likely to be made to that station by the corporation and the owners of adjoining property, which will prove a great public benefit.\"West Briton and Cornwall Advertiser, Railway Special Edition, 1859. A goods shed was opened early in 1863 and the station was rebuilt in 1880-1881. The Cornwall Railway was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway on 1 July 1889. To counter competition from electric trams, the Great Western Railway opened several small stations in Plymouth and began to operate an intensive service of local trains between Saltash, Plymouth and Plympton in July 1904. The services were vastly reduced after the Tamar road bridge opened in 1961. The Great Western Railway was nationalised into British Railways from 1 January 1948 which was in turn privatised in the 1990s. It had been hoped to restore the buildings as a visitor centre for the Royal Albert Bridge, but they have now been sold to a property developer. ==Facilities== The station is unstaffed and has no ticket provision, so all tickets must be purchased in advance or from the conductor on the train.
