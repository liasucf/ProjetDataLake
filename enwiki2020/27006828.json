    "text": "', provisional designation ', is a Jupiter trojan and member of the Eurybates family from the Greek camp, approximately in diameter. It was discovered on 1 January 1989, by Japanese astronomer Yoshiaki Oshima at the Gekko Observatory, east of Shizuoka, Japan. The assumed C-type asteroid belongs to the 90 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 19.9 hours. It has not yet been named since its numbering in July 1992. == Orbit and classification == ' is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60\u00b0 ahead of the Gas Giant's orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.8\u20135.6 AU once every 11 years and 9 months (4,303 days; semi-major axis of 5.18 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.08 and an inclination of 6\u00b0 with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Gekko Observatory in January 1989. === Eurybates family === ' is the member of the small Eurybates family (), named after its parent body, 3548 Eurybates. This asteroid family comprises 218 known members of carbonaceous and/or primitive composition, and is one of only a few families identified among the Jovian asteroids; with four of them in the Greek camp. This potentially collisional family was first characterized by Jakub Rozehnal and Miroslav Bro\u017e in 2011, and further described in 2014. Other members of this family include the Jupiter trojans 8060 Anius, 9818 Eurymachos, , and 360072 Alcimedon. In the HCM analysis by Milani and Kne\u017eevi\u0107, however, ' belongs to the background population. == Physical characteristics == ' is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid. The overall spectral type of members of the Eurybates family is that of a C- and P-type. It has a high V\u2013I color index of 1.01. === Rotation period === In April 2015, the so-far only lightcurve was obtained by Robert Stephens at the Center for Solar System Studies in Landers, California. The photometric observations gave a rotation period of hours and a brightness variation of 0.14 magnitude (). === Diameter and albedo === According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer, ' measures 53.28 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.052, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 50.77 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 10.2. == Numbering and naming == This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 14 July 1992 (). As of 2018, it has not been named. == Notes == == References == == External links == * Long-term evolution of asteroid families among Jovian Trojans, Jakub Rozehnal and Miroslav Bro\u017e (2014) * Asteroid Lightcurve Database (LCDB), query form (info) * Discovery Circumstances: Numbered Minor Planets (5001)-(10000) \u2013 Minor Planet Center * * 005258 005258 Category:Discoveries by Yoshiaki Oshima 19890101 ",
