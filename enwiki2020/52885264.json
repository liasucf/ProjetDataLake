Clarke's Rendezvous with Rama Best Novel, rather than Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow. Rejoinders in various hues issue from Gordon van Gelder and George Zebrowski\u2014although nobody sees fit to remark on this year's Best Novel, where nostalgia beat out one of the finest, most wrenching SF novels ever written, J. R. Dunn's Days of Cain.\"Kirkus Reviews (review), Mar. 1, 2000. Ray Olson in The Booklist also notes the debate begun by Lethem, observing that it and the nonfiction pieces on publishing and movies, along with William Tenn's speech, \"fairly steal the award-winning stories' thunder,\" as does the reprinted 1946 Hal Clement story. \"Still, the winners ... aren't bad.\"Olson, Ray. \"Nebula Awards Showcase 2000\" (review) in The Booklist, v. 96, no. 14, Mar. 15, 2000, p. 1335. Kurt Lancaster in the Christian Science Monitor calls Benford's introduction \"helpful\" and comments in detail on the pieces by Haldeman, Finch, Yolen and Rogers, noting that \"[i]n all of these stories, the theme of the spirit of humanity transcends the limitations the characters have imposed on themselves, as they discover something new about themselves and their relationship to others.\"Lancaster, Kurt. \"Winners That are Out of This World\" (review) in the Christian Science Monitor, v. 92, iss. 79, Mar. 16, 2000, p. 16 Marta Boswell in The Missouri Review finds the volume's editorial commentary \"reeks of [a] 'those-were-the-good-old-days' attitude,\" nostalgic \"for the era when SF writers were 'the bards of science.'\" That said, \"the fiction itself is, for the most part, fresh and interesting.\" Boswell singles out the Haldeman excerpt and the Williams story, which she calls \"my favorite of the collection\" for particular praise. She also comments positively on the Yolen, McGarry and Landis pieces, while deeming Finch's and Rogers' less successful.Boswell, Marta. \"Nebula Awards Showcase 2000\" (review) in The Missouri Review, v. 23, no. 2, 2000, pp. 176-177. The anthology was also reviewed by Gary K. Wolfe in Locus #471, April 2000, and Greg L. Johnson in The New York Review of Science Fiction, September 2000. ==Notes== Nebula 34 Category:2000 short story collections Category:Science fiction anthologies ",
