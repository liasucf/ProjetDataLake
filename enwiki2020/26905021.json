    "text": "The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop is a studio established in Teshie, Ghana, since the 1950s. It is known for its design coffins that became symbolic of African artistic creativity. The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop == History == Figurative palanquin; drawing by the coffin- and palanquin builder Ataa Oko (1918-2012) from Ghana Seth Kane Kwei (1922\u20131992) was a Ga carpenter joiner established in Teshie, in the suburbs of Accra in Ghana. He was a long time considered to be the inventor in the early 1950s of design coffins or fantasy coffins, called Abebuu adekai (\"boxes with proverbs\") by the Ga people, the dominant ethnic group of the region of Accra. Though, an anthropologist recently published a different story of the origin of the coffins.Regula Tschumi: The Figurative Palanquins of the Ga. History and Significance, in: African Arts, Vol. 46, Nr. 4, 2013, S. 60-73 As the anthropologist Regula Tschumi recently wrote, the figurative coffins developed out of the figurative palanquins which were formerly used like the figurative coffins in Accra only by the traditional chiefs. Around 1960 the use of figurative coffins for Ga burial rites became widespread. Design coffins are acknowledged as symbolic of contemporary creation in Africa. At the death of Kane Kwei, his son Sowah took over the workshop, then Cedi - Kane Kwei's younger child - after the death of Sowah in 1999. Since 2005, Eric Adjetey Anang (born 1985, the son of Cedi) has been attempting to revitalize the creativity of the studio by the introduction of new models, the creation of furniture realized in the same spirit and using the same techniques as for the coffins. About ten carpenters' workshops established in Teshie and in the region of Accra produce similar coffins. Some of their masters are like Paa Joe and Tei in Dorwanya former apprentices of Seth Kane Kwei. Others were trained by Kane Kwei's successors, mainly by Paa Joe. Among them are Daniel Mensah called Hello in Teshie, Tetteh in Amasaman and Tetteh Red in Ningo, Kudjoe Affutu in Awutu, Central Region, and Eric Kpakpo in La. == The coffins == === Manufacturing of the coffins === Kane Kweis former apprentice Paa Joe with a sandal coffin. Paa Joe and Kane Kwei were shown together in several group shows like in Les Magiciens de la Terre 1989 in the Centre Pompidou in Paris The Kane Kwei workshop is deeply anchored in Ga tradition, both by the genesis of its productions, by protocols framing their local use, and by its functioning based on apprentices, who can number about ten. At the end of the apprenticeship, which lasts from two to five years, a traditional ceremony is organized. In this occasion, the apprentice has to pay a sum of money, donate alcoholic drinks, a parasol, a pair of sandals to the boss of the workshop, and then a certificate is handed to him. The manufacturing process of coffin begins by the scrupulous observation of visual documents reproducing the proposed model, or even the actual model - that could be a live animal - followed by its being realised in three dimensions. Neither plans nor sketches are prerequisite to the manufacturing. After the coffin is built, the inside is coated with a lining. The outside is carefully polished, sprayed, and finally decorated by a painter. Light wood as wawa (white wood) or emien is used for the coffins intended for funerals. Those coffins intended for export as artworks are made from harder and more expensive wood, such as limba or African Mahogany. ===Coffins created by Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop - selected list=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:left; width:80%;\" |+ |- ! scope=col | Type ! scope=col | Subject |- |Animals |Antelope \u2022 Aulacode (Thryonomys swinderianus) \u2022 Cameleon \u2022 Catfish \u2022 Coq \u2022 Cow \u2022 Crab \u2022 Crayfish \u2022 Doberman dog \u2022 Dove \u2022 Eagle \u2022 Elephant \u2022 Hen \u2022 Lobster \u2022 Lion \u2022 Parrot \u2022 Peacock \u2022 Pig \u2022 Reindeer \u2022 Red fish \u2022 Sardine \u2022 Saw fish \u2022 Shark \u2022 Snail \u2022 Snake \u2022 Spider \u2022 Striped fish \u2022 Tilapia \u2022 Tuna \u2022 Turkey \u2022 Turtle \u2022 Whale |- |Buildings |Church \u2022 Danish traditional farm \u2022 Grocery shop \u2022 Two storey building |- |Fruits and vegetables |Banana \u2022 Carrot \u2022 Cocoa pod \u2022 Corn \u2022 Green pepper \u2022 Onion \u2022 Palm nut \u2022 Pineapple \u2022 Pumpkin \u2022 Red pepper \u2022 Sugar cane |- |Objects |9mm bullet \u2022 Asante stool \u2022 Ballpoint with notebook \u2022 Bass drum \u2022 Bible \u2022 Bottle of beer (Star) \u2022 Bottle of beer (Tuborg) \u2022 Bottle of Coca-Cola \u2022 Bottle of soju \u2022 Bottle of vodka (Beluga) \u2022 Bottle of vodka (Stolichnaya) \u2022 Can of Aquarius energy drink \u2022 Canned mackerels and tomato \u2022 Chief's scepter \u2022 Cigarette (London) \u2022 Cinema projector \u2022 Condom sachet \u2022 Crate of beer (Carsberg) \u2022 Falling tree \u2022 Fishing net \u2022 Flour bag \u2022 \"Graphic\" newspaper \u2022 Guitar \u2022 Hunting gun \u2022 I-Phone \u2022 Kalashnikov magazine \u2022 Lego brick \u2022 Machine gun \u2022 Matrioshka \u2022 Soccer shoe \u2022 Spaner \u2022 Traditional sword\u2022 Spoon \u2022 Sewing machine \u2022 Pot \u2022 Hammer \u2022 Maersk container \u2022 Microphone \u2022 Outboard engine \u2022 Piano \u2022 Plane \u2022 Ray Ban case \u2022 Referee whistle \u2022 Remote control (Philips) \u2022 Robot \u2022 Rocket toy \u2022 Saw \u2022 Syringe \u2022 Soccer ball \u2022 Smith's bellows \u2022 Talking drum \u2022 Tray of frozen food \u2022 Trowel \u2022 Wad of banknoates (Danish) \u2022 Wad of banknotes (Russian) \u2022 Windmill \u2022 |- |Vehicles |32 seats bus \u2022 Ambulance \u2022 Aircraft (Ghana Airways) \u2022 Aircraft (KLM) \u2022 Bedford truck \u2022 Canoe \u2022 Cruise ship \u2022 Fire truck \u2022 Fishing boat \u2022 Garbage truck \u2022 Luxury bus \u2022 Mercedes-Benz car saloon \u2022 Mercedes-Benz car (convertible) \u2022 Private jet \u2022 Toyota Corolla \u2022 Tractor \u2022 Volkswagen minibus \u2022 War tank |- |Others |Sun \u2022 Soccer field |} == From burials in Ghana to international art market == === Apparition of the studio's works on art market === While some figurative coffins were acquired in the 1970s by American gallery owners (Vivian Burns in 1973 and Ernie Wolfe, both from Los Angeles), it is since 1989 that these objects achieved international recognition as works of art, through their successive display in exhibitions: Magiciens de la terre (1989, Mus\u00e9e National d'Art Moderne (Centre Georges Pompidou) - Grande halle de la Villette, Paris - Curator Jean-Hubert Martin) and \"Africa Explores\" (1992, New Museum of Modern Art, New York - Curator Susan Vogel).Some of the coffins shown in these exhibitions were done in the Kane Kwei shop, others were made by Paa Joe or Daniel Mensah - Regula Tschumi: The Buried Treasures of the Ga.Coffin Art in Ghana\", Benteil 2008, p. 52-56. Pieces of the studio are part of major private collections including the Contemporary African Art Collection of Jean Pigozzi and many public collections. At the initiative of the studio, artistic partnerships with Western institutions are implemented and residencies of foreign artists organized.http://michaeldeforeststudio.blogspot.be/ === Presence of the studio on the international cultural stage from 2005: see Eric Adjetey Anang=== === Selection of group exhibitions until 2005 === * 2005 \"Arts of Africa\", Grimaldi Forum, Monaco, France * 2005 \"African Art Now\", Museum of Fine Art, Houston, USA * 2005 \"Sexualit\u00e4t und Tod - AIDS in der Zeitgen\u00f6ssischen Afrikanischen Kunst\", RJM Museum, Cologne, Germany. * 2003 \"Ghana: hier et aujourd\u2019hui / Ghana: Yesterday and today\", Mus\u00e9e Dapper, Paris, France * 2000 \"Ein Fisch f\u00fcr die letzte Ruhe\", Museum auf dem Ohlsdorfer Friedhof, Hamburg, Germany. * 1998 \"AFRICA Vibrant New Art from a Dynamic Continent\", Tobu Museum of Art, Tokyo, Japan. * 1998 \"Samuel Kane Kwei\", Museum of Contemporary and Modern Art, Geneva, Switzerland. * 1997 \"Wie das Leben, so der Sarg...Samuel Kane Kwei, Nam June Paik\", Ifa Gallery, Bonn, Germany. * 1996 \"Neue Kunst aus Afrika\", Haus der Kulturen der Welt, Berlin, Germany. * 1995 Nam June Paik Recent Works, Benamou-Gravier Gallery, Paris, France.
