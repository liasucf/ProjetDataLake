Food products are presently branded under the name \"Loma Linda\" by the Atlantic Natural Foods Company. The company was previously owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church and Worthington Foods. The company began operations in 1905 under the name The Sanitarium Food Company, and produced crackers, breads and cookies. Additional health foods were later produced by the company, such as the breakfast cereal Ruskets, and the company also expanded to produce infant formula and meat analogue products. At the time the Loma Linda Food Company was founded in 1933, it produced some of the first meat analogue products prepared from soy and wheat that were available in the United States on a commercial basis. In the 1960s, Loma Linda Foods and Worthington Foods were the largest manufacturers of soy-based foods in the United States. Foods sold under the present Loma Linda brand name include canned vegetarian/meat analogue products such as chili, taco filling and faux meats such as sausage, chicken, tuna, scallops and steak. ==History== Loma Linda Foods was preceded by the Loma Linda Sanitarium bakery, officially named The Sanitarium Food Company, which began operations in 1905 in Loma Linda, California. The company under the name Loma Linda Food Company was created in 1933, at which time it opened a new production facility near Riverside, California. The company's name was changed to La Loma Foods in 1989, and in 1989 the company sold its infant formula brand and line to N.V. Nutricia, a Dutch company. The Seventh-day Adventist Church sold the company to Worthington Foods of Ohio in 1990, and Worthington Foods was acquired by The Kellogg Company in 1999.
