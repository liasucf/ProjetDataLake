    "text": "The Slovak passport is issued to citizens of Slovakia to enable legal international travel. Every Slovak citizen is also a citizen of the European Union. The passport, along with the national identity card allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the European Economic Area, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. Every Slovak citizen is entitled to possess two passports of the same kind, if he or she wishes to. The second passport is valid for 5 years (instead of the standard 10 years), while the fee remains the same. Passports in Slovakia are issued by the police force. == History == Slovakia started issuing the current biometric passports on January 15, 2008. The biometric data consisted of the face picture. On June 22, 2009 the passports were changed to include second biometric data of the fingerprints. Because of the nature of biometric data acquirement, passports are now issued only directly to the passport owners.http://www.minv.sk/?cestovne-pasy ==Visa requirements== Visa requirements for Slovak citizens As of October 1, 2019 Slovak citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 181 countries and territories, ranking the Slovak passport 9th in terms of travel freedom (tied with Australian and Lithuanian passports) according to the Henley Passport Index. ==Gallery of historic images== File:Slovak passport 2005.jpg|The non-biometric version issued between 2005 and 2008.
