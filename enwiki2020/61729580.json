    "text": "The Father of the House is a title that is bestowed on the senior member of the House of Commons who has the longest continuous service. If two or more members have the same length of current uninterrupted service, then whoever was sworn in earliest, as listed in Hansard, is named as Father of the House. The only formal duty of the Father of the House is to preside over the election of the Speaker of the House of Commons. However, the relevant Standing Order does not refer to this member by the title of \"Father of the House\", but instead to the longest-serving member of the House present who is not a Minister of the Crown. Until 1971, the Clerk of the House of Commons presided over the election of the Speaker. As the clerk is never a member, and therefore is not permitted to speak, he would silently stand and point at the Member who was to speak. However, this procedure broke down at the election of a new Speaker in 1971 and was changed upon the recommendation of a select committee. Until 6 November 2019, the Father of the House of Commons was Kenneth Clarke, a Conservative MP until 3 September, and then an Independent MP, for Rushcliffe. Clarke began his continuous service at the 1970 general election. He declined to seek re-election and he retired before the 2019 general election. Dennis Skinner, Labour MP for Bolsover, also began continuous service at the 1970 general election, but was sworn in after Clarke. Skinner contested the 2019 General Election, but was defeated, and so Sir Peter Bottomley, who has been an MP continuously since 1975, became Father of the House. ==History== Historically, the Father of the House was not a clearly defined term, and it is not clear by what process it was used for individual Members. The first recorded usage of the term dates to 1788, in an obituary of Thomas Noel (MP); it is also attested in an engraved portrait of Whitshed Keene by Charles Picart, from 1816. It may have been interpreted at various times as the oldest member, the member with the longest total service, the member with the longest unbroken service (the modern definition), or the member who entered the House longest ago. There is also some evidence that in the late 19th century, the position may have been elected. The modern definition was not settled upon until the late 1890s. After the Second World War, a convention arose that the Father would normally be a member of the Select Committee on Privileges, but this lapsed following the establishment of the modern Standards and Privileges Committee in the 1990s. Among the twentieth-century Fathers, there were several very prominent figures; four former Prime Ministers became Father of the House, and a fifth, Henry Campbell-Bannerman was simultaneously Father of the House and Prime Minister from May 1907 until soon before his death during April 1908. Almost all have been Privy Councillors. To date, all holders of the position have been men, and there has been no formal \"Mother of the House\". However, the term was used in 2017, by Prime Minister Theresa May, to describe Harriet Harman in recognition of her status as the longest continuously serving woman MP. == List of Fathers of the House since 1899 == This list covers all Fathers of the House since W.W. Beach, the first to become Father after the modern approach (longest period of continuous service) was agreed in 1898. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Name !Entered Parliament !width=100pt|Father (Standing Order No 1) !Left House !colspan=2|Party !Constituency |- |William Wither Bramston Beach||1857||1899||1901 ||North Hampshire Andover |- |Michael Hicks Beach||1864||1901||1906 ||Gloucestershire East Bristol West |- |George Finch||1867||1906||1907 ||Rutland |- |Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman||1868||1907||1908 ||Stirling Burghs |- |Sir John Kennaway, 3rd Baronet||1870||1908||1910 ||East Devon Honiton |- |Thomas Burt||1874||1910||1918 ||Morpeth |- |T.
