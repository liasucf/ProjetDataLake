    "text": "Saint-Lambert is a city () in southwestern Quebec, Canada, located on the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, opposite Montreal. It is part of the Urban agglomeration of Longueuil of the Mont\u00e9r\u00e9gie administrative region. It was home to 21,861 people according to the Canada 2016 Census. Saint-Lambert is divided into two main sections: the original city of Saint-Lambert and the Pr\u00e9ville neighbourhood. The original city of Saint-Lambert (as it existed prior to 1969) is located from the Country Club of Montreal golf course to the border of the Le Vieux-Longueuil borough. It includes the city's downtown, known as \"The Village\". On the other side of the Country Club of Montreal is the former city of Pr\u00e9ville, which merged with Saint-Lambert in 1969. It extends to the borders of the city of Brossard and the Longueuil borough of Greenfield Park. Saint-Lambert was named for the early French Canadian hunter Lambert Closse. ==History== The Marsil House, built in 1750, is one of the oldest buildings in Saint-Lambert. In 1636, Louis XIII of France was dividing up seigneuries in the new colony of New France. One of these was known as La Prairie, comprising La Prairie de la Magdeleine and La Prairie de Saint- Lambert. The lower part of the latter, was known as Mouillepied, due to the swampy conditions of the area. Saint-Lambert's first two permanent residents were Andr\u00e9 Marsil and Andr\u00e9 Achim in the 18th century. Today Andr\u00e9 Marsil's house can be found on the corner of Riverside Drive and Notre-Dame Avenue, was converted into a textile museum called the Marsil Museum (), although the museum has since moved to the Bonsecours Market. In 1722, Mouillepied was transferred from La Prairie seigneurie to Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil parish. Following the establishment of the railway in 1852 and the completion of the Victoria Bridge in 1859, the village received a permanent link to the island of Montreal. The Victoria Bridge is the oldest bridge linking Montreal to the South Shore, and carried the first rail line linking Quebec's largest city to New York City. Because of this, Saint-Lambert became an important passenger and freight stop for a long period of time. This is evident in the city's architecture, in which many old industrial buildings are found near the railway tracks. Many of these have since been converted into lofts such as the former Waterman pens factory, originally built in 1908. streetcar arriving in Saint-Lambert from the Victoria Bridge in 1909. With the bridge and railway came a quick growth in Saint-Lambert's population and the construction of new housing. Saint-Lambert detached itself from Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil and achieved municipality status in 1857, under its first mayor, Louis B\u00e9tournay. At the time, Saint-Lambert did not include Mouillepied, which instead had remained in Saint-Antoine-de-Longueuil. In 1892, Saint-Lambert reached village status, attained town status in 1898 and city status in 1921. During World War I and World War II, Saint-Lambert had one of the highest military enlistment rates in Canada. The small city lost a total of 132 soldiers in both wars.Montreal Gazette Article This number was a significant portion of the young people at the time. The Saint-Lambert Cenotaph by sculptor Emanuel Hahn was inaugurated on July 9, 1922, by General Arthur Currie. In the 1950s, the development of Saint-Lambert was enhanced with the building of the St. Lambert Locks in the St. Lawrence Seaway, to bypass the smaller Lachine Canal, and this became the most easterly lock in the Seaway. Suburban growth from Montreal in this period also affected Saint-Lambert, as well as many of the older communities on the South Shore. Since its establishment, the city's limits have barely changed. In 1948, the old Mouillepied area of the town of Jacques-Cartier was split off and erected into the town of Pr\u00e9ville. It merged with Saint-Lambert in 1969. Saint-Lambert had an anglophone majority population starting in 1881, and throughout most of the 20th century. Saint- Lambert had 12,460 anglophones and was 61% anglophone as recently as the 1981 census. This started to change, as it increasingly become the home to upper class francophone families, in the 1970s, 80s and 90s. The late 1990s saw the construction of a new residential neighbourhood in Saint-Lambert, known as \"Le Haut Saint-Lambert\". It was built on the remaining vacant land in city limits near LeMoyne. In 2007, the city of Saint-Lambert celebrated its 150th anniversary. ;Amalgamation and de-amalgamation On January 1, 2002, municipal reorganization merged Saint-Lambert with LeMoyne to form a borough in the new Longueuil mega-city. There was a strong \"de-merger\" movement and a referendum was won on June 20, 2004, to re-establish the former city. The city was officially reborn on January 1, 2006, while on January 7, 2006, the Saint- Lambert flag was hoisted in front of city hall and the mayor, councillors and city manager took their oath of office. ==Geography== A Neo-Tudor house, turned restaurant, in Saint-Lambert's village during winter. Saint-Lambert is underlain by Ordovician period black shale. This bedrock is covered by deep clay drift over most of the town. Soils were poorly drained in their natural state; as such, they were classified as gleysols\u2014strongly acidic (Longueuil series) under most of the town and neutral to mildly alkaline (Boucherville series) in part of the western section (Pr\u00e9ville).
