At every show concert there will be onsite resources where concert goers can \"askSARAH\" (the institute's hotline) questions. At the show fans can purchase Paisley's album Love and War for $15, and as part of \"get one, give one\", when they buy a copy, they can send a copy to a cancer patient for an additional $15. ===Opening acts=== *Chase Bryant *Lindsay Ell *Dustin Lynch ===Set list=== This setlist is a representation of the Charlotte, NC show. #\"Last Time for Everything\" #\"Old Alabama\" #\"Perfect Storm\" #\"Online\" #\"One Beer Can\" #\"Crushin' It\" #\"This Is Country Music\" #\"Love and War\" #\"American Saturday Night\" #\"Ticks\" #\"I'm Still a Guy\" #\"Celebrity\" #\"Then\" #\"She's Everything\" #\"River Bank\" #\"Grey Goose Chase\" #\"Waitin' on a Woman\" #\"When I Get Where I'm Going\" #\"Water\" #\"Whiskey Lullaby\" #\"I'm Gonna Miss Her (The Fishin' Song)\" #\"Mud on the Tires\" #\"Today\" ;Encore * \"Alcohol\" ===Tour dates=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !
