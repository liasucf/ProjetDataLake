Retrieved September 3, 2018 == Reception == Allmusic's Richie Unterberger said: \"It's odd that Blue Note decided to sit on it for so long, because it ranks as one of Lonnie's better sets. The band, featuring George Benson on guitar, is relaxed and funky without being in your face about it, and unlike much soul- jazz of the time, most of the material is original, Smith having penned six of the eight numbers. Although the riffs often owe a lot to James Brown, this is definitely at least as much jazz as soul\". ==Track listing== All compositions by Lonnie Smith except where noted # \"I Can't Stand It\" \u2013 8:24 # \"Expressions\" \u2013 11:30 # \"Scream\" \u2013 9:47 # \"Play It Back\" \u2013 9:35 # \"Love Bowl\" \u2013 9:43 # \"Peace of Mind\" \u2013 7:38 # \"I Want to Thank You\" (Sly Stone) \u2013 9:51 # \"Seven Steps to Heaven\" (Victor Feldman, Miles Davis) \u2013 7:06 ==Personnel== *Lonnie Smith \u2013 organ, vocals *Dave Hubbard \u2013 tenor saxophone *Ronnie Cuber \u2013 baritone saxophone *George Benson \u2013 guitar *Joe Dukes \u2013 drums *Clifford Mack \u2013 tambourine ==References== Category:Blue Note Records live albums Category:Lonnie Smith (jazz musician) live albums Category:1995 live albums Category:Albums produced by Francis Wolff ",
