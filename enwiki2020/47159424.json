It has been used as the preface for the Gutenberg Bible. This Bible was published by Johannes Gutenberg and Johann Fust in Mainz, Germany in 1454. The Gutenberg Bible is an edition of a 4th century Latin translation of the Bible known as the Vulgate or common text. ==Jerome== Jerome was a prominent religious figure \u2013 a Christian priest, confessor, theologian, historian and Doctor of the Church. He was recognised as a Saint by the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Churches, and the Church of England and was responsible for a translation of the Bible into Latin: the Vulgate. Many medieval Vulgate manuscripts included Jerome's epistle number 53, to Paulinus bishop of Nola, as a general prologue to the whole Bible. Notably, this letter was printed at the head of the Gutenberg Bible. Jerome's letter promotes the study of each of the books of the Old and New Testaments listed by name (and excluding any mention of the deuterocanonical books); and its dissemination had the effect of propagating the belief that the whole Vulgate text was Jerome's work despite the fact it is not. == Content of the epistle == == In the Gutenberg Vulgate == ===Creation=== The Gutenberg Bible was created using a pioneering invention that allowed sheets of paper to be printed in large quantities resulting in the same quality as manuscripts. Only 135 copies of the Bible were printed on paper and 45 on vellum. The fact that such a small number of copies were produced, the innovative procedure used to create it and the quality of the result are features that make Gutenberg and Fust authority figures in the book-making process. Additionally, because it was written in Latin, only an elite audience of aristocrats, merchants and some educated priests could understand it. ==References== == External links == * Read the letter in English *Read the letter with notes in English * *The second letter to Paulinus (letter 58) *Third letter to Paulinus (letter 85) Category:Early printed Bibles Category:Latin texts ",
