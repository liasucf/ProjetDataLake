    "text": "Clarence's punch is a cocktail inspired by Clarence Odbody's bar order in It's a Wonderful Life. It has a high proof rum intended to be set on fire, to caramelize the sugar. Chowhound notes, \"The key to this recipe is to float the overproof rum shot, light that on fire (floating on top of the other ingredients), and then put it out with the second shot of regular-proof rum (or by stirring with a metal spoon).\" The punch is then sprinkled with cinnamon. ==Recipes== One recipe calls for it to be made of white rum, Jamaican rum, lime juice, ruby port, orgeat, and orange juice, topped with overproof rum. Another calls for it to be made of 151-proof rum, white rum, orange juice, pineapple juice, cherry brandy, and grenadine, and garnished with an orange wedge and sugar. This cocktail is the signature drink at the Hotel Clarence bar in Seneca Falls. Michael William, in Essential It's a Wonderful Life, gives a recipe of apple cider, lemon juice, sugar, cinnamon sticks, whole cloves, rum, and water: \"Throw everything but the rum into a large saucepan and heat to simmer for five or so minutes. Pour the heated concoction into a punch bowl and add rum. . . . Turn the house lights down and ignite\" the rum. ==References== Category:Cocktails with rum Category:Flaming drinks ",
