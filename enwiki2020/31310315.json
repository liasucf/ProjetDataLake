He was created baronet of Fiskerton in the County of Lincoln on 17 November 1666. Between 1673 and 1680 (while the Exclusion Bill agitation was maturing) it was asserted by the country party that Charles II had legally married Lucy Walter\u2014his mistress while exiled on the European Continent in the late 1640s and early 1650s, and the mother of his son the James, Duke of Monmouth. It was believed in course of time that the contract of marriage was preserved in a black box in the possession of Sir Gilbert, who was son-in-law of Bishop John Cosin (died 1672), a confidant of Lucy Walter. In a novel which had a wide circulation it was the designing Prince of Purdino (James) who advised his brother, King Conradus of Otenia, to marry the beautiful \"Lucilious\", but, in order to avoid disgusting the Otenians, to do so with the greatest privacy imaginable, and in the presence of but two witnesses, himself and the priest (Cosin). cites The Perplex'd Prince, London, 1681? 12mo, dedicated to William, lord Russell, by T. S. Sir Gilbert Gerard, summoned before an extraordinary meeting of the Privy Council convened by King Charles II, stated that he knew nothing whatever of such a marriage contract; and the King issued three declarations in denial of the marriage (January, March, and June 1678). One of these declarations, signed by sixteen Privy Councillors, was entered in the council book and registered in chancery. ==Family== Gerard married firstly Mary, daughter of Sir John Brereton with whom he had no children, and secondly Mary, daughter of John Cosin, Bishop of Durham, with whom he had a daughter, Charlotte and a son and heir Sir Gilbert Cosins Gerard, 2nd Baronet. Charlotte married John Barcroft. Gilbert married first, Mary, daughter and heiress of Charles Berkeley, 1st Earl of Falmouth, from whom he was divorced in 1684, and secondly, Lady Morlaud, but had no children from either marriage, so the baronetcy became extinct on his death. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * ;Attribution * Category:1687 deaths Category:High Sheriffs of Durham Category:Baronets in the Baronetage of England Category:English MPs 1661\u20131679 Category:English MPs 1679 Category:English MPs 1680\u20131681 Category:English MPs 1681 Category:Year of birth uncertain Category:Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber Category:British Life Guards officers ",
