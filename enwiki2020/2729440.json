    "text": "WAP 5 is the name of a class of \"High Speed\" electric locomotives produced and used by Indian Railways. The first 10 locomotives were imported from ABB in Switzerland in 1995. They are supposed to be a variant of the Swiss Lok 2000 (Design concept) and German DB Class 120 (mechanical chassis). One of the notable features of WAP-5 is regenerative braking. Other notable features of this loco are the provision of taps from the main loco transformer for hotel load, pantry loads, flexible gear coupling, wheel-mounted disc brakes, and a potential for speed enhancement to . Braking systems include regenerative brakes, loco disc brakes, automatic train air brakes, and a charged spring parking brake. On 3 July 2014, a WAP-5 set an Indian speed record by hauling a train from Delhi to Agra within 90 minutes at a speed of . The Gatimaan Express and Bhopal Shatabdi trains hauled by WAP-5 locomotives travel at and respectively in the New Delhi - Agra Cantt section. ==Locomotive sheds== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

The control software was also modified accordingly. Another locomotive (no. 30164) was rolled out with aerodynamic cab profile. ==Head on Generation== A WAP-5 locomotive (loco no. 30140) with Head-on Generation (HOG) was rolled by CLW in June 2018. In this locomotive, the hotel load converter has been accommodated in the same cubicle of traction converter. More locomotives of this type will be rolled out in future. ==Up- gradation to 6000HP== In March 2018, CLW rolled out a WAP-5 locomotive (no. 30136) with an enhanced power output of about 4500 kW (above 6000 HP). Modifications were carried out in the control software. Based on successful trials, I.Rlys decided to proliferate the modification in all WAP5 locomotives. ==Liveries == * Common livery for WAP-5 locomotives is White, Black & twin Red band similar to the colors of the Agfa-Gevaert company. * Recently, Vadodara Shed and Amul Milk made a contract of advertising 20 locomotives of Shed. Thus the Amul livery came into existence. The livery has the sides of locomotive painted in Amul livery. All the recent locomotives are being painted in this livery as part of contract. * WAP-5 locomotives homed at Ghaziabad loco shed have large P-5 decals on their body sides. * New WAP-5 Livery Of Fortune Edible Oils Is Released by Vadodara(BRC) Electic Loco Shed With Loco Number-30081. ==Gallery== GZB WAP-5 with Goa Express GZB WAP 5 with Sapt Kranti Express Ghaziabad based WAP 5 getting ready to haul the Garib Rath Express Habibganj - New Delhi Shatabdi Express arriving Habibganj with GZB WAP-5 GZB WAP-5 resting at Pitline A WAP-5 hauling the Bhopal Shatabdi Express A GZB based WAP-5 hauling Gatimaan Express WAP-5 with Bhopal Shatabdi Express ==Technical Specifications== Specifications are as follows: {| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" |+Technical Specifications ! colspan=2 | General Information |- |Gauge |Broad gauge |- |Line voltage |25000 V |- |Type of current |Alternating Current (AC) |- |Axle load | |- |UIC classification |Bo- Bo |- |Length over head-stocks | |- |Length over buffers | |- |Bogie wheel base | |- |Wheel base | |- |Body width | |- |Cab length | |- |Pantograph locked down height | |- | Bogie center distance | |- | Height over pantograph | |- | Body width | |- | Coupling | Central Buffer Couplers (CBC) |- | Surface | corrugated or plain |- ! colspan=2|Traction motors |- |Type |6FXA 7059 3-phase asynchronous motors, , 2180 V, 370 A continuous, 396 A for 1 hr, 540 A max, 1585 rpm continuous, 3174 rpm max, Weight 1990 kg.
