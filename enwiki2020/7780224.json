Teia Maru departed from Mormugao on 21 October and returned the repatriated Japanese to Yokohama on 14 November. Teia Maru traveled to Singapore with convoy Hi-41 in February 1944, and returned to Japan with convoy Hi-48 in March. She again traveled to Singapore with convoy Hi-63 in May 1944, and returned to Japan in June carrying about 1,000 Australian, British, Dutch, and other prisoners of war (POWs) who had worked on the Burma Railway.
