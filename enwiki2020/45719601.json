    "text": "Psathyrella spadicea, commonly known as the chestnut brittlestem, is a species of agaric fungus in the family Psathyrellaceae. The fungus was originally described by German mycologist Jacob Christian Sch\u00e4ffer in 1783 as Agaricus spadiceus. Rolf Singer transferred it to the genus Psathyrella in 1951, in which it is classified in the section Spadiceae. The mushroom is edible. Psathyrella spadicea is found in Europe and North America. In North America, it is more common in northern regions, including Alaska and the Yukon Territories, than further south. Fruitbodies produce reddish to red-brown spore prints. ==See also== *List of Psathyrella species ==References== ==External links== * Category:Edible fungi Category:Fungi described in 1783 Category:Fungi of Europe Category:Fungi of North America Category:Psathyrellaceae ",
