    "text": "The Semovente da 75/46 was an Italian tank destroyer used during World War II. ==Development== After the armistice of Cassibile signed in September 1943, Northern and Central Italy fell under German control. In 1944 the progress of the war led them to order a new Italian armoured vehicle for a tank-fighting role, based on the Semovente da 105/25 self-propelled gun. The result was the Semovente da 75/46, which was named Sturmgesch\u00fctz M 43 mit 75/46 (852) (i) by the Germans, following their naming convention.Pignato, Nicola (1974), in Bellona Military Vehicle Prints, series 36. Model & Allied Publications LTD., p. 13, 18-20 The 75/46 shared the same \"M 43\" hull of the Semovente da 105/25., p. 51 However, the 105 mm L25 howitzer was replaced by a long Cannone da 75/46 C.A. modello 34 \u2013 originally conceived as an anti-aircraft gun but also used as an anti-tank gun \u2013 which gave a higher muzzle velocity (750 m/s instead of 510) and a far greater effective range, being able to fire a shell up to away. This gun could be loaded with HE or armour-piercing rounds; when loaded with the latter, it could penetrate up to of armour from 500 m. The other main difference with its precursor was in the overall increased armour: sloped plates were applied to the casemate and others were added on the sides, above the tracks. Due to these features and despite its origins, the 75/46 is considered a tank destroyer in every respect., p. 64 ==Production== Between 1944 and the end of World War II in Italy, Ansaldo managed to assemble only 11 or 13 vehicles, all deployed exclusively by the Wehrmacht. Their standard camouflage, applied just after assembly, was Saharian Khaki background with reddish-brown and gray-green patches. ==References== Category:Armoured fighting vehicles of Italy Category:World War II armoured fighting vehicles of Italy Category:World War II self-propelled artillery Category:World War II tank destroyers Category:75 mm artillery Category:Gio.
