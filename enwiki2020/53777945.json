Baxter and Arthur G. Adams, Fordham University Press, 1999, p. 46, . The terminal opened in 1865 following the completion of the Central Railroad of New Jersey's Communipaw Terminal. By the late 1960s the Jersey Central opted to close its station at Communipaw and the last ferry departed the terminal for Jersey City on April 26, 1967, bringing to an end 306 years of Communipaw ferry operations.Railroad Ferries of the Hudson: And Stories of a Deckhand, by Raymond J. Baxter and Arthur G. Adams, Fordham University Press, 1999, p. 60, . The terminal was subsequently demolished and the waterfront was filled in to create Battery Park City in the early 1970s. The Cortland Street Ferry Depot, operated by the Pennsylvania Railroad and the West Shore Railroad, was located directly next to the terminal and also provided ferry service across the North River from lower Manhattan to their railroad terminals at Exchange Place and Weehawken, respectively. The terminal was located one block west of the Ninth Avenue Elevated's Cortland Street Station which operated from 1874 until 1940. During the 1980s ferry service across the Hudson was restored by NY Waterway and it has subsequently been expanded. Today the Battery Park City Ferry Terminal is located a few blocks north of where Liberty Street Ferry Terminal and Cortland Street Ferry Depot once stood. ==See also== *Whitehall Terminal *Chambers Street Ferry Terminal *Cortland Street Ferry Depot *Battery Park City Ferry Terminal ==Gallery== File:New York by sunlight and gaslight - a work descriptive of the great American metropolis; its high and low life; its splendors and miseries; its virtu (1882) (14779729932).jpg|Cortland and Liberty Street Ferries, ca. 1882 File:128 WEST STREET.
