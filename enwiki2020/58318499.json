The group is formed a friendly match between the rock band Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje and the Zagreb Mosque Choir Arabeske. The group's name refers to a law book of shadirvan. The band's songs harbors folk tradition of the Western Balkans, Bosnian root music, Islamic poetics (ilahia) of the Bosnians and Bosnian Muslims, a concept of rock and roll as primarily progressive music open to various music influences, but also a classic jazz sound. == History == Zabranjeno Pu\u0161enje and the Zagreb Mosque Choir Arabeske has been collaborating on various recordings since 2001. At the first, Arabeske Choir featured on the Zabranjeno pu\u0161enje song \"Lijepa Alma\" (Bog vozi Mercedes, 2001). The collaboration of the popular rock band and the Zagreb Mosque choir came to peak during the writing and formation of the film score for the 2006 Bosnian action comedy film Nafaka, directed by Jasmin Durakovi\u0107. In that occasion the Shaderwan Code was formed. Sejo Sexon, the bandleader and songwriter of Zabranjeno pu\u0161enje, has already been incorporating ilahia, Islamic religious songs, in musical arrangements for his band. The songs \"Test za d\u017eennet\" (Fild\u017ean vi\u0161ka, 2001) and \"Lijepa Alma\" (Bog vozi Mercedes, 2001) before, and \"Domovina\" and \"Laku no\u0107 stari\" (both Hodi da ti \u010diko ne\u0161to da, 2006) after the 2006 film score collaboration with Arabeske Choir, can be regarded as an inauguration for Shaderwan Code.
