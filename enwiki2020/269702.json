    "text": "Alexis Paulin Paris. Alexis Paulin Paris (25 March 180013 February 1881) was a French scholar and author. ==Life== Paris was born at Avenay (Marne). He studied classics in Reims and law in Paris. He published in 1824 an Apologie pour l'\u00e9cole romantique (In Defense of the Romantic school) and took an active part in Parisian journalism. His appointment, in 1828, to the department of manuscripts in the Biblioth\u00e8que royale left him leisure to pursue his studies in medieval French literature. His numerous editions of early French poems continued the work begun by Dominique Meon in arousing general interest in the chanson de geste. Admitted to the Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles Lettres in 1837, Paris was shortly afterwards appointed on the commission entrusted with the continuation of the Histoire litt\u00e9raire de la France. In 1853, a chair of medieval literature was founded at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, and Paris became the first occupant. He retired in 1872 with the title of honorary professor and was promoted to officer of the Legion of Honour in the next year. ==Works== His works include: *Manuscrits fran\u00e7ais de la biblioth\u00e8que du roi (7 vols., 1836-1848) *Les Romans du Garin le Loherain, pr\u00e9c\u00e9d\u00e9 d'un examen des romans carlovingiens (1883-1885) *Les Romans de Berte aux grans pi\u00e9s (1832) *Le Romancero fran\u00e7ais, histoire de quelques anciens trouv\u00e8res et choix de leurs chansons (1833) *an edition of the Grandes chroniques de France (1836-1840) *La Chanson d'Antioche (1848) *Les Aventures de ma\u00eetre Renart et d'Ysengrin (1861) *Les Romans de la table ronde (1868-1877).
