After being kept at a Greek elementary school during the night, the arrested turkish Cypriots were boarded in a bus. According to the only survivor of the massacre, Suat Hussein Kafadar, they were taken to the village of Palodia, where they were executed with automatic guns.Paul Sant Cassia, Bodies of Evidence: Burial, Memory, and the Recovery of Missing Persons in Cyprus, Berghahn Books, 2007, , Massacre&f;=false p. 61.Gisela Welz,European Products: Making and Unmaking Heritage in Cyprus, Berghahn Books, 2015, p. 53 Total number of victims is 84 (78 from Tochni and 6 from Zygi) At the massacre site, according to Kadafar, there was a Greek officer.
