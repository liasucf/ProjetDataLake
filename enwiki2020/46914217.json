Mack was born in the district of Hock Shan, in the province of Guangdong, China in 1911. He was orphaned at an early age and through the assistance of extended family he moved to Hong Kong to work with the Allum\u2019s family. By 1932, he accepted an invitation to work in their family\u2019s business located in Trinidad, West Indies. Once settled in Trinidad, his strong work ethic allowed him to gain the confidence of management and as a result he was invited to become one of the original partners in J.T. Allum & Company. It was during these post-Depression and pre-World War II days, that business was extremely difficult but Mr. Mack persevered and built a thriving business operation. By 1956, Mr. Mack became its main shareholder and began an aggressive and successful expansion of the group\u2019s retail and real estate businesses. Mr. Mack passed away in 1995, and the business continues to be actively managed by the second and third generations of the Mack family, building upon his impressive legacy. ==History== The firm grew out of a small grocery store at 100 High Street, San Fernando run by Carlton K. Mack for the Allum family. By the 1950s, Mack had taken control of the whole business which he ran as Allum's Supermarket from 1967 to 1988. It became JTA Supermarkets in 1988 and is a subsidiary of J.T. Allum & Co. Limited. ==Operations== JTA has shops in Carlton Centre, Cross Crossing, Marabella, Corinth and Couva, each of 20,000\u201330,000 square feet.About Us. JTA Supermarkets. Retrieved 7 June 2015. ==C3 Centre Opening== In 2016 the sod was turned in Corinth for what is the largest mall of its kind in south Trinidad, the C3 Centre Mall under the J.T. Allum & Co. Ltd Group. Then San Fernando Mayor, Kazim Hosein was present along with other prominent dignitaries from the south. Hundreds of new jobs were created for the citizens of San Fernando and environs. Southerners also now enjoy a wide range of activities in one location, from grocery shopping to fine dining to movie going to working out at the gym. C3 Centre has truly become a staple for professionals and families alike for entertainment and business in south Trinidad. https://www.guardian.co.tt/article-6.2.354295.14727482a4 https://archives.newsday.co.tt/2016/05/22/recession-will-pass-says- supermarket-head https://www.guardian.co.tt/article-6.2.354430.dc4dee6a33 ==Notable events== In October 2016, a young JTA employee named Lillyann Williams went viral after photos of her feeding and assisting a disabled man at JTA Cross Crossing were shared all over social media and the national press.

The Mack family, owners of JT Allum Group of Companies and one of San Fernando\u2019s most prominent business families received the honour for their immeasurable contribution to business development in the southern industrial capital of Trinidad.

His Worship the Mayor expressed the following sentiments: \"The symbolism of the Key to the City is rooted in trust, honour and the recognition of commitment and respect. In this regard, there can be no greater exemplars who personify these ideals than the JT Allum Company and the Mack Family. The JT Allum Company has continuously contributed and supported the City of San Fernando and our Citizens, through family events, the recognizing of academic excellence at the primary and secondary school levels, religious events and the preserving of historical landmarks in our City, namely the Library Corner clock. Through employment and the provision of services from the JT Allum Company, our citizens and City have benefitted from their perseverance and growth. In honouring them with the Key to the City, it is to show our gratitude in recognition of their continued efforts and success.\" ==Covid-19 Donations== JTA Supermarkets got a mention in the South- West Regional Health Authority's newsletter, The Southern Pride, in July 2020 for their efforts to provide essential healthcare workers with breakfast during the Covid-19 lockdown.
