    "text": "Rose Sydell (born Rosa Sidles; 1865 \u2013 August 4, 1941) was an American burlesque actress. She starred in her own show, Rose Sydell and the London Belles, which toured the United States and Europe for 26 years. Sydell\u2019s penchant for wearing great quantities of valuable jewels and ostrich plumes secured her reputation as America\u2019s first Burlesque Queen. ==Rose Sydell and the London Belles== Born in Covington, Kentucky, Rose Sydell started her career as a ballet dancer at Robinson's Opera House in Cincinnati, OH. At 19, she entered burlesque after receiving an offer from producer Sam T. Jack. While playing at the London Theatre in New York City, Sydell met Jack\u2019s press agent, Williams S. Campbell, who was a famed burlesque comedian himself. Sydell and Campbell married and in 1893 formed the Rose Sydell Burlesque Company, which produced the London Belles. In addition to starring in the London Belles and creating her own lavish wardrobe, Sydell selected the chorus girls. She explained the audition process: \u201cEvery girl I chose...I first took to my own hotel room, had her slip on a pair of tights, and then considered the appearance of her legs as well as face.\u201dSobel, pp. 100 For her own costume, Sydell avoided short skirts and tights. She wore long, extravagant dresses\u2014accessorized with diamonds from her own collection\u2014and left the strip teases to the chorus girls. In 1910, Variety criticized Sydell for piling on ermine fur and jewels, while dressing her pretty chorus girls in costumes that were \u201cterribly shabby and very much soiled.\u201d With its combination of Sydell\u2019s star power, handsome chorus girls, comical playlets, and popular songs, the London Belles tour was a major burlesque attraction. It played in the US and Europe for over two decades. Sydell was its \u201cbright and particular star.\u201d Sydell was one of the first American burlesque actresses to appear on the cover of the New York Clipper. In a 1910 cover story, the Clipper's burlesque critic wrote, \u201cThere are very few stars to-day who are better known, and very few who are as popular, she being well known from coast to coast.\u201d These were the early days of burlesque and the London Belles were not without controversy. According to Sydell, some women would cross the street to avoid walking by a burlesque theatre. In 1893, several members of the Sydell Company were arrested after the New England Watch and Ward Society cited them for indecency. At the trial, William S. Campbell explained that a chorus girl had broken a strap and accidentally bared her breast on stage. The judge ruled in favor of the Sydell Company and the Watch and Ward Society were forced to apologize. Sydell stopped performing with the London Belles in 1915 to focus her energies on women\u2019s suffrage. She officially retired from show business in 1927. At a book launch party hosted by Farrar & Rinehart for Bernard Sobel\u2019s Burleycue in 1931, Sydell declared that \u201cburlesque shows today are disgusting.\u201d Over her career, Sydell appeared with the principal stars of the burlesque industry, including Daisy Harcourt, and influenced a generation of burlesque queens, such as Mollie Williams. ==Personal life== Sydell married burlesque comedian William S. Campbell. Friends described them as being devoted to each other throughout their lives. The couple adopted Sydell\u2019s niece, who performed along with her aunt in the London Belles using the name Rose Sydell Jr. Sydell and Campbell amassed considerable wealth in burlesque. The two owned stock in the Columbia Amusement Company from its inception, and bought additional stock in other corporations. They invested in real estate, purchasing a block of brownstones on State Street in Brooklyn, NY, as well as a hotel in Atlantic City. Sydell possessed a large collection of diamonds and other jewels. Rose Sydell died at home on August 4, 1941. She was buried in Evergreen Cemetery, Brooklyn, NY. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:19th-century American actresses Category:20th-century American actresses Category:American female singers Category:American women comedians Category:American stage actresses Category:American Burlesque performers ",
