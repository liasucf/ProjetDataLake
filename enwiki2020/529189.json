The poem was published in the weekly journal Ittehad on 16 August 1904.Pritchett, Frances. 2000. \"Tarana-e-Hindi and Taranah-e-Milli: A Study in Contrasts.\" Columbia University Department of South Asian Studies. Publicly recited by Iqbal the following year at Government College, Lahore, British India (now in Pakistan) it quickly became an anthem of opposition to the British Raj. The song, an ode to Hindustan--the land comprising present-day Bangladesh, India and Pakistan, was later published in 1924 in the Urdu book Bang-i-Dara. The song has remained popular, but only in India. An abridged version is sung and played frequently as a patriotic song and as a marching song of the Indian Armed Forces. ==Text of poem== {| |- | Urdu | colspan=\"2\" | Romanisation (ALA-LC) |- | colspan=\"2\" | > | > |} == English translation == Better than the entire world, is our Hind, We are its nightingales, and it (is) our garden abode If we are in an alien place, the heart remains in the homeland, Know us to be only there where our heart is. That tallest mountain, that shade-sharer of the sky, It (is) our sentry, it (is) our watchman In its lap where frolic thousands of rivers, Whose vitality makes our garden the envy of Paradise. O the flowing waters of the Ganges, do you remember that day When our caravan first disembarked on your waterfront? Religion does not teach us to bear animosity among ourselves We are of Hind, our homeland is Hindustan. In a world in which ancient Greece, Egypt, and Rome have all vanished Our own attributes (name and sign) live on today. There is something about our existence for it doesn't get wiped Even though, for centuries, the time-cycle of the world has been our enemy. Iqbal! We have no confidant in this world What does any one know of our hidden pain? ==Composition== Iqbal was a lecturer at the Government College, Lahore at that time, and was invited by a student Lala Har Dayal to preside over a function. Instead of delivering a speech, Iqbal sang \"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\". The song, in addition to embodying yearning and attachment to the land of Hindustan, expressed \"cultural memory\" and had an elegiac quality. In 1905, the 27-year-old Iqbal viewed the future society of the subcontinent as both a pluralistic and composite Hindu-Muslim culture. Later that year he left for Europe for a three-year sojourn that was to transform him into an Islamic philosopher and a visionary of a future Islamic society. ==Iqbal's transformation and Tarana-e-Milli== In 1910, Iqbal wrote another song for children, \"Tarana-e-Milli\" (Anthem of the Religious Community), which was composed in the same metre and rhyme scheme as \"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\", but which renounced much of the sentiment of the earlier song.Iqbal: Tarana-e-Milli, 1910. Columbia University, Department of South Asian Studies. The sixth stanza of \"Saare Jahan Se Achcha\" (1904), which is often quoted as proof of Iqbal's secular outlook: contrasted significantly with the first stanza of Tarana-e-Milli (1910) reads: Iqbal's world view had now changed; it had become both global and Islamic. Instead of singing of Hindustan, \"our homeland,\" the new song proclaimed that \"our homeland is the whole world.\"Pritchett, Frances. 2000. Tarana-e-Hindi and Tarana-e-Milli: A Close Comparison. Columbia University Department of South Asian Studies. Two decades later, in his presidential address to the Muslim League annual conference in Allahabad in 1930, he supported a separate nation-state in the Muslim majority areas of the sub-continent, an idea that inspired the creation of Pakistan.A look at Iqbal; The Sunday Tribune \u2013 May 28, 2006 ==Popularity in India and in popular culture== * Saare Jahan Se Achcha has remained popular in India for nearly a century. Mahatma Gandhi is said to have sung it over a hundred times when he was imprisoned at Yerawada Jail in Pune in the 1930s.Times of India: Saare Jahan Se..., it's 100 now * In the 1930s and 1940s, it was sung to a slower tune. In 1945, while working in Mumbai with IPTA (Indian Peoples Theater Association), the sitarist Pandit Ravi Shankar was asked to compose the music for the K.A. Abbas movie Dharti ka Laal and the Chetan Anand movie Neecha Nagar. During this time, Ravi Shankar was asked to compose music for the song Saare jahan se accha. In an interview in 2009 with Shekhar Gupta, Ravi Shankar recounts that he felt that the existing tune was too slow and sad. To give it a more inspiring impact, he set it to a stronger tune which is today the popular tune of this song, which they then tried out as a group song. It was later recorded by the singer Lata Mangeshkar to a 3rd altogether different tune. Stanzas (1), (3), (4), and (6) of the song became an unofficial national song in India, and the Ravi Shankar version was adopted as the official quick march of the Indian Armed Forces.Indian Military Marches. The song was set as a marching tune by Antsher Lobo. * Rakesh Sharma, the first Indian astronaut, employed the first line of the song in 1984 to describe to then prime minister Indira Gandhi how India appeared from outer space.India Empowered to Me Is: Saare Jahan Se Achcha, the home of world citizens * In his inaugural speech, the former prime minister of India Manmohan Singh quoted this poem at his first press conference after becoming the Prime Minister. * The song is popular in India in schools, and as a marching song for the Indian armed forces, played during public events and parades. It is played by the Armed forces Massed Bands each year for the Indian Independence day, republic day and at the culmination of Beating the Retreat. ===Text in the Hindi script=== In India, the text of the poem is often rendered in the Devanagari script of Hindi: {| |- | | colspan=\"2\" | Hindi |- | colspan=\"2\" | > | > >> \u0938\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0938\u0947 \u0905\u091a\u094d\u091b\u093e \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0938\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e > \u0939\u092e \u092c\u0941\u0932\u092c\u0941\u0932\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u092f\u0939 \u0917\u0941\u0932\u0938\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0917\u093c\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092c\u0924 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0939\u094b\u0902 \u0905\u0917\u0930 \u0939\u092e, \u0930\u0939\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0926\u093f\u0932 > \u0935\u0924\u0928 \u092e\u0947\u0902 > \u0938\u092e\u091d\u094b \u0935\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092d\u0940 \u0926\u093f\u0932 \u0939\u094b \u091c\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092a\u0930\u092c\u0924 \u0935\u0939 \u0938\u092c\u0938\u0947 \u090a\u0901\u091a\u093e, \u0939\u092e\u094d\u0938\u093e\u092f\u093e \u0906\u0938\u092e\u093e\u0901 \u0915\u093e > \u0935\u0939 \u0938\u0902\u0924\u0930\u0940 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e, \u0935\u0939 \u092a\u093e\u0938\u092c\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0917\u094b\u0926\u0940 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0916\u0947\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0907\u0938\u0915\u0940 \u0939\u091c\u093c\u093e\u0930\u094b\u0902 \u0928\u0926\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0901 > \u0917\u0941\u0932\u094d\u0936\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u091c\u093f\u0928\u0915\u0947 \u0926\u092e \u0938\u0947 \u0930\u0936\u094d\u0915-\u090f-\u091c\u0928\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0910 \u0906\u092c-\u090f-\u0930\u0942\u0926-\u090f-\u0917\u0902\u0917\u093e! \u0935\u0939 \u0926\u093f\u0928 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u092f\u093e\u0926 > \u0924\u0941\u091d\u0915\u094b? > \u0909\u0924\u0930\u093e \u0924\u093f\u0930\u0947 \u0915\u093f\u0928\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u091c\u092c \u0915\u093e\u0930\u0935\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092e\u091c\u093c\u094d\u0939\u092c \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0938\u093f\u0916\u093e\u0924\u093e \u0906\u092a\u0938 \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u092c\u0948\u0930 \u0930\u0916\u0928\u093e > \u0939\u093f\u0902\u0926\u0940 \u0939\u0948\u0902 \u0939\u092e, \u0935\u0924\u0928 \u0939\u0948 \u0939\u093f\u0928\u094d\u0926\u094b\u0938\u093f\u0924\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u092f\u0942\u0928\u093e\u0928-\u0913-\u092e\u093f\u0938\u094d\u0930-\u0913-\u0930\u0942\u092e\u093e \u0938\u092c \u092e\u093f\u091f \u0917\u090f \u091c\u0939\u093e\u0901 > \u0938\u0947 > \u0905\u092c \u0924\u0915 \u092e\u0917\u0930 \u0939\u0948 \u092c\u093e\u0915\u093c\u0940 \u0928\u093e\u092e-\u0913-\u0928\u093f\u0936\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0915\u0941\u091b \u092c\u093e\u0924 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u093f \u0939\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u093f\u091f\u0924\u0940 \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u0940 > \u0938\u0926\u093f\u092f\u094b\u0902 \u0930\u0939\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0926\u0941\u0936\u094d\u092e\u0928 \u0926\u094c\u0930-\u090f-\u091c\u093c\u092e\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e \u0907\u0915\u093c\u094d\u092c\u093e\u0932! \u0915\u094b\u0908 \u092e\u0939\u0930\u092e \u0905\u092a\u0928\u093e \u0928\u0939\u0940\u0902 \u091c\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u092e\u0947\u0902 > \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0942\u092e \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0915\u093f\u0938\u0940 \u0915\u094b \u0926\u0930\u094d\u0926-\u090f-\u0928\u093f\u0939\u093e\u0901 \u0939\u092e\u093e\u0930\u093e ! > > |} == Notes and references == ===Notes=== ===Citations=== ==See also== > *Iqbal bibliography *Amar Shonar Bangla *Jana Gana Mana *Vande Mataram > *Qaumi Tarana *National Pledge (India) *\"Dil Dil Pakistan\" ==External > links== * (Children singing the complete lyrics of the song.) > Category:Poetry by Muhammad Iqbal Category:Indian patriotic songs > Category:Indian poems Category:Indian culture Category:Literature of Indian > independence movement Category:Muhammad Iqbal Category:Urdu words and > phrases Category:1904 songs Category:Indian military marches ",
