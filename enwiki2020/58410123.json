    "text": "Christoffer Haagh (born 17 February 1987) is a Danish futsal player and footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for JB Futsal Gentofte, the futsal division of J\u00e6gersborg Boldklub. In September 2018, he made his debut for the Denmark national football team, as the regular squad withdrew following a players' union dispute. ==International football career== In September 2018, the Danish Football Association and players' union were scheduled to sign a new national team agreement for the players of the Denmark national team prior to a friendly against Slovakia and their opening UEFA Nations League match against Wales. However, a contract dispute arose regarding the commercial rights of the players, resulting in a failure to sign a new agreement. Despite an offer from the squad to extend the previous deal to allow for further negotiations, the DBU instead named an entirely uncapped squad under the temporary management of coach John Jensen to avoid punishment from UEFA for cancelling the matches. The squad consisted of a mixture of players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), along with futsal players from the Denmark national futsal team. On 4 September 2018, Haagh was one of 24 players to be named in the replacement squad. The following day, he made his international debut in the friendly match against Slovakia. He played the entire match, which finished as a 0\u20133 away loss. Despite the defeat, Haagh earned praise for his display in the game, making a number of saves to keep the score down.Futsal keeper Christoffer Haagh spares Denmark blushes in Slovakia Eurosport. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Denmark |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2018||1||0 |- !Total!!1!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Profile at DBU.dk * Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:Futsal goalkeepers Category:Danish men's futsal players Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers ",
