Headquartered at the Virginia BioTechnology Research Park in Richmond, Virginia, VABIO was founded in 1992, and incorporated in the Commonwealth of Virginia as a non-profit 501(c)(6) trade association. It is the official state affiliate of the Biotechnology Industry Organization (BIO). VABIO sponsors student internships, workforce development initiatives and serves as the primary contact point for the media, government officials, researchers and students regarding the bioscience industry in Virginia. Its activities are governed by a board of directors composed of twenty-four leaders representing all segments of the bioscience community. The first full-time executive director for VABIO, Mark A. Herzog, was hired in August 2000. The current CEO is John L. Newby II. The Virginia Biotechnology Association is one of the three founding partners of Mid-Atlantic Bio, the first regional bioscience convention that combines academia, the commercial bioscience industry, and the venture capital community in one major event. VABIO also produces the Virginia Bioscience Blog and the Virginia Bioscience Podcast. ==References== ==External links== * *Virginia BioTechnology Research Park *Biotechnology Industry Organization *Mid-Atlantic Bio *Virginia Bioscience Blog *Virginia Bioscience Podcast Category:Biotechnology advocacy * Category:Advocacy groups in the United States Category:Organizations established in 1992 Category:1992 establishments in Virginia Category:Trade associations based in the United States Category:501(c)(6) nonprofit organizations ",
