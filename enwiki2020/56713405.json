It is a part of the Chuuk State Department of Education. Its original facility was built between the late 1960s to the middle of the 1970s, a period when several other public high schools were built in the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.Compact of Free Association in the Micronesian States of Palau, the Federated States of Micronesia and the Marshall Islands: Environmental Impact Statement. United States Department of State, 1984. p. 36. \"From the late 1960s to the mid-1970s the major high school complexes through-out the Trust Territory were constructed:[...]Truk High School,[...]\" By 1970 a Korean construction company was building three buildings.Micronesian Reporter, Volumes 18-20, 1970.

In 1995 it had about 1,200 students. At the time it required prospective students to take an admissions test as there were not enough resources to admit all prospective students. As of that year most of the students matriculated from Weno's junior high school. At the time it was Chuuk State's sole public high school.Patacsil, Peter E. \"Secondary and Postsecondary Math Education in Chuuk State, Federated States of Micronesia.\" ERIC, 1995. p. 4/16. ==See also== * Education in the Federated States of Micronesia ==References== Category:Schools in the Federated States of Micronesia Category:High schools Category:Weno ",
