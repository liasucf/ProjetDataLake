The league is run by Northern Region Football, an amalgamation of the Auckland Football Federation and Northern Football Federation, and includes football clubs located in Northland and Auckland. It comprises half of the fifth tier of New Zealand football alongside the WaiBOP Premiership. The fixtures are played generally from April to September. The league winners are promoted to the NRFL Division 2; the second-place team enters a two-game playoff series with the champions of the WaiBOP Premiership, with the winner being promoted. ==Current Northern League structure== * NRFL Premier * NRFL Division 1 * NRFL Division 2 * AFF/NFF Conference (this page), WaiBOP Premiership ==Current clubs== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Team !Location !Stadium !Notes |- |Glen Eden United |Glen Eden, Auckland |Singer Park | |- |Lynn-Avon United |New Lynn, Auckland |Ken Maunder Park | |- |Norwest United |Huapai |Huapai Domain | |- |Papakura City |Papakura, Auckland |McLennan Park | |- |Puhoi SC |Puhoi |Puhoi Domain |9th in 2019 NFF Division 1; promoted |- |Ranui Swanson |Ranui, Auckland |Starling Park | |- |South Auckland Rangers |Flat Bush, Auckland |Rongomai Park | |- |West Auckland Kiwi True Blues |Kelston, Auckland |Brains Park | |- |Te Atatu |Te Atat\u016b, Auckland |Te Atat\u016b Peninsula Park | |} ==References== ==External links== *Lotto NRFL website *Auckland Football Federation 4 ",
