The Triangle factory fire of March 25, 1911, killed one hundred forty-five persons. On March 20, 1958 New York City Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. asked for legislation to prevent fires like the one at 623 Broadway. Wagner and New York City Fire Commissioner Edward F. Cavanaugh both stated that the structure did not violate fire and building codes. Wagner called on the New York City Council to enact necessary ordinances quickly. Among those he suggested were the installation of automatic fire sprinkling systems, the building of fireproof partitioning walls in lengthy rooms, the construction of full ceilings in loft buildings, and making it mandatory that each worker be given a fire drill.Mayor Asks Laws To Prevent Fires In Loft Buildings, New York Times, March 21, 1958, pg. 1. ==References== Category:1958 disasters in the United States Category:1958 fires Category:1958 in New York City Monarch Underwear Company Fire Monarch Underwear Company Fire Monarch Underwear Company Fire Category:Factory fires Monarch Underwear Company Fire Category:Industrial accident deaths Category:Industrial fires and explosions in the United States Category:March 1958 events ",
