The vocals on all the group's songs were sung by John Matthews. == Overview == The first single they released was a cover version of Gerry Rafferty's 1978 UK/U.S. hit \"Baker Street\". It became their biggest hit, when it reached No. 2 in the UK Singles Chart in September 1992, held off from the top only by another dance track, \"Rhythm Is a Dancer\" by Snap!. It was the eleventh biggest selling single of 1992 in the United Kingdom, and also attained major chart success across Europe, selling over a quarter of a million units alone in Germany. Undercover released five more chart singles. The second single was a cover of Andrew Gold's \"Never Let Her Slip Away\", coincidentally also originally from 1978. It reached No. 5, and stayed in the charts in the United Kingdom for a total of eleven weeks. After the success of these two singles, an album, Check Out the Groove, was released, reaching No. 26 in the UK Albums Chart. \"I Wanna Stay with You\" (a cover of the Gallagher and Lyle song) and \"Lovesick\", both from 1993, managed No. 28 and No. 62, respectively. In 1994, Undercover released a new single, \"Best Friend\", and their second album, Ain't No Stopping Us. The musical style of Undercover's interpretations is best described as cheerful and upbeat, incorporating into the song electronic drums and short piano or organ harmonies, along with repetitive and layered vocal phrases, typical for club songs of the 1990s. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"5\"| Peak chart positions |- ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| UK UK chart peaks: * * * ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\" | AUT ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| EUR European albums chart peaks: * ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| GER German albums chart peaks: * ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| NED |- ! scope=\"row\"| Check Out the Groove | * Released: 18 September 1992 * Label: PWL International * Formats: LP, CS, CD | 26 || 29 || 73 || 56 || 34 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ain't No Stopping Us | * Released: 1994 * Label: PWL International * Formats: LP, CS, CD | \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 || \u2014 |- | align=\"center\" colspan=\"15\" style=\"font-size:90%\"| \"\u2014\" denotes items that did not chart or were not released in that territory. |} ===Singles=== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! colspan=\"10\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Certifications !rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Album |- ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| UK ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\" | AUT ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| BEL ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| DEN Danish singles chart peaks: * * ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| EUR European singles chart peaks: * * * ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| GER German singles chart peaks: * * * ! style=\"width:2em;font-size:90%;\"| IRE Note: User needs to click on the \"Search Charts\" tab.
