    "text": "Linwood Pendleton (born July 20, 1964), an American environmental economist, is the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Global Oceans Lead Scientist. He works across the WWF network and with partners to integrate science and research into ocean conservation strategy and initiatives. Since October 2014, Pendleton has served as International Chair in Marine Ecosystem Services at the Laboratory of Excellence and European Institute for Marine Studies (IUEM - University of Western Brittany). He is also a senior fellow at Duke's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions (NIEPS) and Adjunct Associate Professor at the Duke University Marine Laboratory, part of NIEPS. He previously served as the Director of Ocean and Coastal Policy for the Nicholas Institute (2009-2013) and was the founder of the Marine Ecosystem Services Partnership. Pendleton was the Acting Chief Economist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) from 2011-2013. Pendleton has collaborated with conservationists worldwide including at the WWF, The Nature Conservancy, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC, and he served for nearly ten years on the Board of the Conservation Strategy Fund. He currently serves on the Science Advisory Committee of the Gulf of Maine Research Institute, GEO Blue Planet steering committee, the Blue Carbon Finance Working Group, and the OBIS science advisory committee. Pendleton has served on (and currently serves on) several government and scholarly advisory boards and committees, including the California Marine Life Protection Act Initiative, as part of the statewide Science Advisory Team and Central Coast Subteam. He currently sits on the Editorial Board of the Journal of Ocean and Coastal Economics (JOCE). His interests are now on international initiatives, which include projects focussing on marine ecosystem services, ocean acidification, blue carbon, and deep sea management. ==Early work and education== Before joining Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions in September 2009 as the Director of Ocean and Coastal Policy, Pendleton was senior fellow and director of economic research at The Ocean Foundation in Washington, D.C., and director of the Coastal Ocean Values Center in North Sandwich, New Hampshire. Prior to that, he held the position of associate professor of environmental science and engineering at UCLA, assistant professor of economics and finance at the University of Wyoming, and assistant professor of economics at the University of Southern California. In addition to a master's degrees in Public Administration from Harvard University and Ecology from Princeton University, Pendleton received a doctoral degree in Forestry and Environmental Studies from Yale University in 1997. ==Scholarly contributions== Pendleton's work is focused in the field of marine and coastal economics where he studies the effects of environmental change on the economics of ocean and coastal use. In 2002, Pendleton published a report titled \u201cA Preliminary Study of the Value of Coastal Tourism in Rincon, Puerto Rico\u201d assessing the percentage of Rincon's income that has coastal tourism as its source. Pendleton stated that \"should the quality of the coastal and ocean resources of the area become impaired, it is likely that a large portion of Rincon's economy will be lost\" and estimated the annual income generated by tourism related to coastal and ocean resources to be greater than $51.9 million. The information from this 2002 report has been cited as instrumental to the designation of the Tres Palmas Marine Reserve (in 2008) as a marine protected area, resulting in the protection of \u201cone of the last remaining elkhorn coral reefs in the Caribbean\u201d and the continued status of Rincon as a \u201csurfing epicenter\u201d. Pendleton worked with NOAA in 2005 on the National Ocean Economics Program (NOEP) as a nonmarket research specialist. The goal of this program was to determine the value of ocean and coastal resources to give coastal managers a \u201cbetter understanding of the value of an area\u2019s resources and how important they are to local and national economies.\u201d In the United States, Pendleton has studied water quality off the beaches of Southern California, looking at the \u201ceconomic contributions\u201d of beaches and the impact that water quality has on that \u201ccontribution\u201d including the \u201ccosts associated with pollution of coastal waters and the economic benefits associated with cleaning them.\u201d His studies have included an investigation (in 2006) of the costs of health care and time missed from work by beachgoers due to illness related to low water quality at several South California beaches. Also in Southern California, Pendleton's research on behalf of the Santa Monica Bay Restoration Foundation played a role in instituting the Marine Life Protection Act, creating marine reserves off Westward Beach, Point Dume and Paradise Cove (in 2009). Pendleton's study surveyed California residents about their visits to the coast and determined that \u201cmore than 90 percent of visits to the Southern California coast are for \u2018non-consumptive\u2019 activities such as scuba diving, tide-pooling and surfing, and that such \u2018non-take\u2019 activities bring more money to coastal economies than \u2018consumptive activities\u2019 like fishing.\u201d Data collected related to the impact visits to the coast have on coastal economies showed that consumptive visits brought $2.5 million to these economies while non-consumptive visits were the source of an almost $115 million. During his time at The Ocean Foundation\u2019s Coastal Ocean Values Center in 2008, Pendleton coauthored and edited the published book \u201cThe Economic and Market Value of Coasts and Estuaries: What\u2019s At Stake?\u201d which presented the findings of a study assessing \u201cthe economic value of the nation\u2019s coastal areas in excess of hundreds of billions of dollars\u201d. The study also found that although estuaries and coasts cover a small percentage of the total land area of United States (only 13%) they are home to 43% of the United States\u2019 population and produce 49% of its economic output. In discussion of the findings of the study, Pendleton said \u201cWe are only now coming to grips with the enormity of the economic value and potential from sustainable uses of our coastal resources, and more importantly, the potential economic losses we suffer each year because of underinvestment in coastal protection and restoration.\u201d Also during his time at The Coastal Ocean Values Center, Pendleton collaborated on a reference guide titled \u201cCoral Reefs, Mangroves and Seagrass Economic Values: A Global Compilation\u201d (2008) which compiled statistics on the economic value of marine resources with the goal of providing that information to managers and planners of marine and coastal development to promote sustainable development of coastal and marine areas. Regarding the contents and purpose of the guide, Pendleton said \u201cThis guide will give planners and conservationists scientific evidence of the economic importance of the other values provided by coral reefs, mangroves, and sea grasses.\u201d In 2010, Pendleton's work focused on rethinking the operation, maintenance, and management funding of the Atlantic Intracoastal Waterway. As part of this work he undertook an expedition aboard his personal vessel, Indicator, travelling up the waterway from the Duke Marine Lab in Beaufort, NC to the Chesapeake Bay in July 2010. At the end of the expedition, Pendleton convened a policy lab in Washington, DC to bring together stakeholders interested in the Waterway's future such as governmental agency officials, commercial and recreational waterway users, environmental scientists and economists. The policy lab was convened at the request of Congressman Mike McIntyre and was planned as the first of a series of three meetings to discuss the Waterway. Pendleton's purpose in planning an expedition prior to the policy lab was to gain a \u201csea level perspective\u201d of the challenges the waterway faced. He stated: \u201cI don\u2019t think you can speak credibly about managing the waterway without spending time on it. When you\u2019re at the helm, it\u2019s a completely different story.\u201d As the LabexMer International Chair in Marine Ecosystem Services, Pendleton has gathered a new research team whose goal is to develop the use of ecosystem services' theoretical framework and data to improve the management of coastal and marine areas. This includes the following projects: * Using Impact Analysis and the Vulnerability Framework to understand the impact of Ocean Acidification on human communities ; * Applying an Ecosystem Services Approach to Marine Management (VALMER) ; * Blue Forests and Blue Carbon (Global Environmental Facility program) ; * Extra-Local Ecosystem Services (Mapping Ocean Wealth Program) ; * Combining Earth Observations and Ecosystem Data to Monitor the Impact of Protected Areas on Ecosystem Services (European Commission's H2020 program). ==Online seminars and webinars== :*\"From Caimans to Carbon\" (February 2017) Marine Lab Seminar Series (presenter) :*MESP Webinar Series I (2013-2014) (host) :*The Conservation Economics Initiative Webinar Series (2014-2015) (host) :*The Pre- ESP Conference Webinars (November 2015) (host) :*The Deep-Sea Webinar Series (2015) (host) :*MESP Webinar Series II (2016) (host) ==Media== Pendleton comments frequently in newspapers and online media, referenced below. :*June 2017 \"The dangers of deep-sea mining\" Geographical (quoted). :*June 2017, \"Biodiversity Loss from Deep-Sea Mining will be Unavoidable\" Duke Today (quoted). :*March 2017, Fleming, D. \"Mega Resort Threatens Puerto Rican Surf Spots\" The Inertia (study referenced). :*December 2016, Patel, V. \"Research maps countries that will be most impacted by large-scale coral reef loss\" The Chronicle, Duke University (quoted). :*November 2016, \"Coral Decay: Scientists pinpoint regions where declining coral reefs could impact people the most\" PLOS Research News (interview). :*November 2016 \"Rising carbon dioxide threatens coral and people who use reefs\" ScienceDaily (quoted). :*November 2016, Dennis, B. \"Why the death of coral reefs could be devastating for millions of humans\" The Washington Post (quoted). :*October 2016 \"Keeping Track of Deep-Sea Mining\" Hakai Coastal Science and Societies magazine (quoted). :*August 2016, Pener, D. \"Underwater in 40 Years?
