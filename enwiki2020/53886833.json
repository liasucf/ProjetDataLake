It is recorded that St Patrick's was incorporated into the Hospital of Saint John outside Newgate, Dublin c. 1250 which would suggest its construction at an earlier time. The vicarage was suppressed in 1397 and was united with Saint John\u2019s Hospital. In 1531 Archbishop John Alen restored the vicarage. The church may have served as a safe house for persecuted clergy. The church was replaced by the modern church in 1838. The church is located within a modern graveyard, accessible by a lychgate, built c. 1920. ==Buildings== Arched doorway in the east wall St. Patrick's Church has a fortified tower house of four storeys attached to its west end, with a bell-cote on top. The entrance door is to the south, where there are two Gothic windows. Most of the northern wall has fallen. ==References== Category:Religion in County Kildare Category:Archaeological sites in County Kildare Category:Former churches in the Republic of Ireland Category:Churches in County Kildare ",
