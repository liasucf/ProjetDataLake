Carbon Tracker popularized the notion of a carbon bubble, which describes the incompatibility between the continued development of fossil fuel projects and combating climate change.Jackie Wills, \"Carbon Tracker has changed the financial language of climate change\", The Guardian, 15 May 2014 (page visited on 8 November 2016).Katharine Earley, \"Carbon Tracker measures oil and coal risk for investors\", The Guardian, 30 April 2015 (page visited on 8 November 2016). == History and work == Carbon Tracker was founded by UK fund manager Mark Campanale, with Jeremy Leggett serving as chairman. The organisation's first two reportsUnburnable Carbon (2011) and Unburnable Carbon (2013)argued that up to two-thirds of the world's known reserves and resources of oil, coal and gas could not be burned while avoiding dangerous levels of climate change. As summarized by Financial Times columnist Martin Wolf: \"The conclusion is quite simple: burning known reserves of fossil fuels is incompatible with meeting the climate targets governments have set themselves.\" The Paris Agreement, adopted internationally in December 2015, aims to keep the global average temperature rise below 2 \u00b0C of warming, to avoid and reduce some of the most severe risks and impacts of climate change. But this requires carbon dioxide levels emitted in the atmosphere by 2050 to not exceed a \"carbon budget\" of up to 900 gigatonnes.Malte Meinshausen, Nicolai Meinshausen, William Hare, Sarah Raper, Katja Frieler, Reto Knutti, David Frame and Myles Allen, \"Greenhouse- gas emission targets for limiting global warming to 2\u00b0C\", Nature, volume 458, pages 1158\u20131163, 2009. Drawing on research from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, Carbon Tracker's reports showed that the world's reserves and resources of coal, oil and gas, if burned, would emit more than three times this amount: approximately 2800 gigatonnes. This raises the possibility that, by financing the development and production of fossil fuels that might never be consumed, investors are exposed to the risk of \"stranded assets\", rendered unprofitable by climate regulations and technological alternatives such as renewable energy.At about that time, the carbon budget idea was plucked from academia by Carbon Tracker, a small London think-tank founded by Mark Campanale, one of the city\u2019s first sustainable investment analysts. Applying the research to the world\u2019s coal mines, oil wells and gasfields, the think-tank said that to have even a small chance of meeting the 2C target, only 565 gigatonnes of CO2 could be emitted up to 2050. But the known fossil fuel reserves of energy and mining companies were equal to 2,795 gigatonnes of CO2. So if the world ever took serious action to meet the 2C goal, most of those reserves would become \u201cunburnable\u201d stranded assets.\" Carney on climate: Stranded fossil fuel theory proves potent, Financial Times, 30 September 2015 Reuters described this idea \u2013 that investors were financing a \"carbon bubble\" \u2013 as having become 'part of \"the climate change lexicon\"; it has formed the basis for warnings about \"stranded assets\" by Bank of England Governor Mark Carney and inspired groups like Norway's sovereign wealth fund to divest billions in fossil fuel holdings'. Carbon Tracker's subsequent research investigated the implications of lower demand and low-carbon scenarios for the different fossil fuels of fossil fuels against lower demand, price and carbon emissions scenarios.Carbon Tracker Sees $283 Billion of LNG Projects as Uneconomic,Bloomberg, 2015\"New coal mines uneconomic as China demand growth slows: Report\", Economic Times, 22 September 2014 Mark Carney echoed Carbon Tracker's warning on stranded assets in a 2015 speech to London insurers. followed by the launch of a task force on climate-related financial disclosures under the auspices of the Financial Stability Board.Energy Companies Risk $2.2 Trillion as Climate Goals Cut Demand, Bloomberg, 25 November 2015 === Reports === Carbon Tracker's reports include:Brochure, Carbon Tracker Initiative (page visited on 8 November 2016). * Unburnable carbon \u2013 Are the world's financial markets carrying a bubble?

If they align their investment plans with the 2\u00b0 C target on global temperatures, the upstream assets of the world's seven largest listed oil and gas companies could collectively be worth $100 billion more, it says.\", Oil And Gas: Change And Prosper? A New Growth Scenario In A 2-Degree World, Forbes, 5 May 2016\"Two reports issued this week suggest that investors should strive to keep the spending straitjacket on oil companies even if prices improve further. One, by Carbon Tracker [...] seeks to show that pursuing new reserves at all costs would not only be bad for the environment, it would be bad business. It argues that even if climate-change policies severely constrain demand for oil, companies will still need to produce more of the black stuff. But if oil prices are anywhere below $120 a barrel, they would produce higher returns if they carry out selective drilling of low-cost wells rather than \u201cbusiness as usual\u201d.\", Not-so-Big Oil, The Economist, 7 May 2016 * Expect the Unexpected: The Disruptive Power of Low-carbon Technology (2017, joint research with the Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment at Imperial College)\"Cheaper renewables to halt coal and oil demand growth from 2020: research\", Reuters, February 2, 2017 * Apocoalypse now (2019) Registration required to download. * How to waste over half a trillion dollars (2020) .

Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy, School of Communication and the Center for Social Media American University. p. 17. The article led McKibben to start a campaign calling for fossil fuel divestment which, as of December 2015, has seen organisations managing over $5.46 trillion committing to partial or total divestment.\"I did base that article, and the subsequent divestment campaign, on CTI's numbers,\" he [Bill McKibben, n.b.] tells RTCC in an email.\" www.climatechangenews.com/2015/08/18/terrifying-math-how-carbon-tracker- changed-the-climate-debate/ Carbon Tracker's analysis has been cited by investment banks HSBC,http://www.businessgreen.com/digital_assets/8779/hsbc_Stranded_assets_what_next.pdf Citi and JP Morgan,JP Morgan North American Equity Research, Clean Tech Monitor, 1 October 2013 consultancies such as Accenture,https://www.accenture.com/_acnmedia/PDF-11/Accenture-Strategy- Energy-Perspectives-Rougher-Seas-Ahead.pdf#zoom=50 and the Dutch Central Bank.http://www.dnb.nl/en/binaries/TimeforTransition_tcm47-338545.pdf?2016100316 It has also provoked a range of responses from major oil companies: ExxonMobil has stated it is 'confident that none of our hydrocarbon reserves are now or will become \u201cstranded.\u201d' \" http://cdn.exxonmobil.com/~/media/global/files/energy-and-environment/report ---energy-and-carbon---managing-the-risks.pdf Chevron, while admitting that ' certain high-cost assets around the world could be impacted by a hypothetical GHG-constrained case', has similarly argued that the risk of stranded assets is 'manageable'. Different positions have also been expressed by BPhttp://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/pdf/investors/bp-agm-notice-of- meeting-2015.pdf and Statoil. According to the Carbon Tracker Initiative report in March 2020 wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than running existing coal-fired power stations and coal power would struggle if markets were priced fairly.Wind and solar plants will soon be cheaper than coal in all big markets around world 12 March 2020 == References == == External links == * Economics of coal by Carbon Tracker Category:Think tanks based in the United Kingdom Category:Climate change organisations based in the United Kingdom ",
