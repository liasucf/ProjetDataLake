(The people united will never be defeated!) is a music album released by the Chilean folk group Quilapay\u00fan in 1975. ==Content== The album is representative of the material artists of the Nueva Canci\u00f3n Chilena released in exile after the military coup of September 11, 1973. It opens with a song in homage to the fallen socialist president Salvador Allende and proceeds with a moving musical elegy to Che Guevara. There are instrumental andean music pieces: \u2018Canci\u00f3n de la esperanza\u2019 composed by Eduardo Carrasco and a version of the traditional Bolivian piece \u2018Titicaca\u2019. \u2018El alma llena de banderas\u2019 a song Victor Jara dedicated to the murder of a young worker is included, as well as songs denouncing the violent military repression against an unarmed people. The most well known song of the album is Quilapay\u00fan & Sergio Ortega\u2019s \u00a1El pueblo unido jam\u00e1s ser\u00e1 vencido!, originally composed as a march for the Popular Unity government; after the September 11, 1973 military coup it became the international anthem of the Chilean resistance. The song has been translated into a number of languages and has been heard in mass rallies, marches and demonstrations all over the world: from students in Iran, to migrant workers in California, to pro- unification rallies in Berlin. In 2004 the song inspired Razom nas bahato, nas ne podolaty by GreenJolly, which became the unofficial anthem of the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine. Music and songs are a testament to the spirit of hope and rebellion during the darkest period of the Pinochet dictatorship. ==Track listing== #\u201cCompa\u00f1ero Presidente\"Compa\u00f1ero Presidente an unofficial title of respect given to Salvador Allende by his supporters, literally meaning, \"Our Comrade President\".
