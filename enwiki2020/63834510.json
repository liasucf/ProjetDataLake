Bercs\u00e9nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Special Forces Battalion === The 34th Bercs\u00e9nyi L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Special Forces Battalion serves as the HDF's special operations forces, specializing in unconventional warfare, internal defense, and counter- terrorism since 1959. It was originally designed to be a parachute unit in World War Two but was reorganized in the 50s to be enlarged in personnel and duties. Since its move to Szolnok in 2001, it has been trained by the Mobile Training Team of the United States Army and has been deployed to Afghanistan to assist other special forces units there. === 93rd Pet\u0151fi S\u00e1ndor CBRN defense Battalion === The battalion is a unit that participates in the prevention of CBRN accidents on Hungarian territory. Its assigned personnel and technical equipment are part of the Defense Disaster Management System. It was raised between 15 October and 1 November 1950 as the 9th Independent Chemical Warfare Regiment in Budafok. After several reorganisations, the regiment became a battalion, then in 1990 the regiment was downgraded to a battalion and was given the honorific of S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi. In 2000, the battalion became a regiment once again and was moved to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r. The move to Sz\u00e9kesfeh\u00e9rv\u00e1r was followed by several organizational changes and has undergone major transformations and modernizations.https://honvedelem.hu/szervezet/mh_93_petofi === 32nd National Honor Guard Battalion === S\u00e1ndor Palace in 2013 The 32nd National Honor Guard Battalion (MH 32. Budapest \u0150r- \u00e9s D\u00edszezred) is the official Guard of honour unit of the HDF. It was founded on 1 January 2011 in order for the regiment to take part in the welcoming of foreign dignitaries to Budapest and in the changing of the guard at S\u00e1ndor Palace. The official ceremonial honour guard of the Hungarian People's Republic was the 7015th Ceremonial Regiment of the Hungarian People's Army ().http://bhd.honvedseg.hu/rovat/32_nemzeti_honved_diszegyseghttp://m.harminckettesek.webnode.hu/ezredtortenet/rendszervaltas- utan/ === HDF Central Band === The band at a parade in 2014 The Hungarian Defense Forces Central Military Band (Magyar Honv\u00e9ds\u00e9g K\u00f6zponti Zenekar) is the representative musical ensemble of the HDF. Although it was officially founded in 1962, its history goes back to 1896, when the first Hungarian military band of music was established in Budapest. Today, the Central Band maintains a fanfare unit as well as a drum corps. The primary task of the Central Band is to take part in national, military, and protocol events. Other activities include cultivation of Hungarian soldiers and wind-music traditions, the promotion and amateur brass bands. The Central Band is a regular participant in international and domestic festivals, and nearly a dozen CDs of performances by the Central Band have been published.http://www.fricsay.hu/?page_id=561http://bhd.honvedseg.hu/rovat/kozponti_zenekar ==References== Hungarian Defence Forces ",
