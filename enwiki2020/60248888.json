She settled in Montr\u00e9al, Quebec, where she taught weaving and wood carving to wounded soldiers. In January 1926, she reviewed the work of charitable organizations in the city, and spoke on behalf of the ones she felt did the most to \"alleviate handicaps of the underprivileged\". She died in Montr\u00e9al on November 2, 1966.
