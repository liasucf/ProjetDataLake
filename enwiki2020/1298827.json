    "text": "Patrice L'Heureux (February 1, 1972 \u2013 October 7, 2018) was a Canadian professional boxer. ==Amateur== L'Heureux participated in the 1999 Pan American Games but was knocked out by Alexis Rubalcaba. ==Professional career== On November 13, 2004, L'Heureux challenged Steve McKay (record 5-1) for the vacant Canadian heavyweight championship in Montreal. After knocking down McKay in the eighth round with a body shot, L'Heureux then knocked him out for good 27 seconds into the ninth round. However, in his first fight after winning the prestigious title in 2005, L'Heureux was viciously pummeled by American clubfighter Steve Pannell (33-8) to lose his undefeated ring record by a technical knock out at 2:31 of the first round. He beat undefeated Olympian Art Binkowski on points later that year. The 6-foot 5-inch tall right-hander suffered his second loss when he was knocked out in the 7th round by David Cadieux on May 12, 2006. He lost the rematch on points. On May 26, 2007, he suffered his fourth loss to the undefeated Alexander Povetkin by a knockout in the 2nd round. L'Heureux subsequently won four straight fights including two fights against Stephane Tessier. His first fight with Tessier earned L'Heureux the Quebec Boxing Council (CQB) Heavyweight Title. He died of a heart attack on October 7. 2018, aged 46.D\u00e9c\u00e8s de l\u2019ancien boxeur Patrice L\u2019Heureux, rds.ca; accessed October 12, 2018. ==Professional boxing record== |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" colspan=\"8\"|24 Wins (13 knockouts, 11 decisions), 5 Losses (4 knockouts, 1 decision), 1 Draw |- style=\"text- align:center; background:#e3e3e3;\" | style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|Result | style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|Record | style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|Opponent | style=\"border- style:none none solid solid; \"|Type | style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|Round | style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|Date | style=\"border-style:none none solid solid; \"|Location | style=\"border- style:none none solid solid; \"|Notes |- align=center |Loss | |align=left| Wayne John |TKO |5 |11/06/2010 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Stephane Tessier |SD |8 |14/05/2009 |align=left| Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Joe Stofle |TKO |5 |04/04/2009 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Ken Murphy |UD |6 |05/04/2008 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Stephane Tessier |UD |8 |21/09/2007 |align=left| Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| Alexander Povetkin |KO |2 |26/05/2007 |align=left| Bamberg, Bayern, Germany |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| David Cadieux |UD |12 |18/11/2006 |align=left| Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Travis \"Ironman\" Fulton |TKO |3 |30/09/2006 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| David Cadieux |KO |7 |12/05/2006 |align=left| Shawinigan, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Josh \"The Griz\" Gutcher |KO |1 |12/11/2005 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Troy \"Country Boy\" Weida |TKO |3 |12/10/2005 |align=left| Grand- M\u00e8re, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Art \"Polish Warrior\" Binkowski |UD |10 |18/06/2005 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Marcos Celestino |TKO |2 |14/05/2005 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Adenilson Rodrigues |TKO |2 |09/04/2005 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Loss | |align=left| Steve \"Storm\" Pannell |TKO |1 |26/02/2005 |align=left| Hull, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Steve MacKay |TKO |9 |13/11/2004 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Garing \"Freight Train\" Lane |UD |8 |11/09/2004 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Jose Arimatea Da Silva |UD |8 |24/04/2004 |align=left| Quebec City, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Marcus Harden |KO |3 |20/12/2003 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Charles \"Chuckie\" Brown |UD |8 |22/11/2003 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Tali Kulihaapai |TKO |3 |24/05/2003 |align=left| Reno, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Ritchie Goosehead |TKO |1 |28/02/2003 |align=left| Granby, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Draw | |align=left| \"Wreckless\" Willie Chapman |PTS |4 |15/02/2003 |align=left| Laughlin, Nevada, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Billy \"The Kid\" Zumbrun |TKO |4 |13/10/2002 |align=left| Choctaw, Mississippi, United States |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Charles Spear |TKO |2 |06/09/2002 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Shane \"Kid Thunder\" Sutcliffe |UD |6 |30/11/2001 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Dean Storey |UD |4 |05/06/2001 |align=left| Trois-Rivi\u00e8res, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Marcelo Aravena |UD |4 |02/03/2001 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Conrad Browne |TKO |3 |08/09/2000 |align=left| Montreal, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |- |Win | |align=left| Ritchie Goosehead |DQ |4 |06/05/2000 |align=left| Maniwaki, Quebec, Canada |align=left| |} ==Football career== L'Heureux is a former football player with the Diablos of Trois- Rivi\u00e8res in Quebec. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1972 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Heavyweight boxers Category:Sportspeople from Shawinigan Category:Place of death missing Category:Canadian male boxers Category:Commonwealth Games competitors for Canada Category:Boxers at the 1998 Commonwealth Games Category:Pan American Games competitors for Canada Category:Boxers at the 1999 Pan American Games ",
