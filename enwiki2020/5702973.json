    "text": "\"Putnici\" (\"Travellers\") was the Bosnian and Herzegovinian entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1999, performed in Bosnian and French (the first time that Bosnia had not entered a song entirely in Bosnian) by Dino and B\u00e9atrice. The song was performed twenty-second on the night, following Germany's S\u00fcrpriz with \"Reise nach Jerusalem - Kud\u00fcs'e seyahat\" and preceding Estonia's Evelin Samuel & Camille with \"Diamond of Night\". At the close of voting, it had received 86 points, placing 7th in a field of 23. The song itself is elliptical in meaning, with lyrics dealing with being travellers through life. The folk-inspired performance of the duo has become something of a favourite in fan circles, however, based on the fact that they were not the first-choice contestants. Bosnian band Hari Mata Hari had been selected to perform, but their intended entry \"Starac i more\" had already been released elsewhere (they would, however, represent the country in the 2006 contest). It was succeeded as Bosnian and Herzegovinian representative at the 2001 contest (Bosnia having been ineligible to enter the 2000 contest) by Nino Pr\u0161e\u0161 with \"Hano\".
