He has been involved in multiple musical acts, such as Pussy Galore, Boss Hog, Heavy Trash and The Jon Spencer Blues Explosion. == History == Jon Spencer was born in 1965 in Hanover, New Hampshire, to a university professor and a cardiology technician. He attended Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island where he was part of the noise rock band Shithaus, which included future Cop Shoot Cop vocalist Tod Ashley. The band was short lived and had a musical style reminiscent of the industrial music of Einst\u00fcrzende Neubauten. He moved to Washington, D.C., and formed Pussy Galore, who quickly relocated to New York. He is also known for bringing attention to and popularizing the blues artist R. L. Burnside, who started touring and working with The Blues Explosion in the mid-1990s after having been playing and living in obscurity for three decades. == References == == External links == * * Category:1965 births Category:American rock guitarists Category:American male guitarists Category:American male singers Category:American rock singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American rock songwriters Category:Noise rock musicians Category:Living people Category:Singers from New Hampshire Category:Noise musicians Category:People from Hanover, New Hampshire Category:Pussy Galore (band) members Category:Guitarists from New Hampshire Category:20th-century American guitarists Category:20th-century American male musicians ",
