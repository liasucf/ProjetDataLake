Circumstantial and forensic evidence are prominent in such convictions. Hundreds of such convictions have occurred in the past, some of which have been overturned. In all cases, unless otherwise noted, the remains of the victims were never recovered. ==Australia== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Victim(s) ! scope=\"col\" | Convicted ! scope=\"col\" | Location ! scope=\"col\" | Disappeared ! scope=\"col\" | Conviction date ! scope=\"col\" | Description |- |- style=\"background:#E9B06B;\" | Azaria Chamberlain | Lindy Chamberlain-Creighton | Uluru | August 17, 1980 | October 29, 1982 | An infant who is now believed to have been killed by a dingo while on a camping trip with her parents.

Because of constant contradictions and legal irregularities, the fact that the child was never named, no body was found, no child disappearance or murder was reported in La Guardia around that time, and obvious similarities with other European blood libels and antisemitic legends, modern historians believe that neither crime nor child actually existed.

Under Isasa's watch, Valero and S\u00e1nchez were arrested and extrajudicially tortured to make them confess. No body was found and the accused ended up claiming that they had fed it to pigs, then burned and ground all remains left. Each was sentenced to 18 years in prison. After Grimaldos was found alive in Mira in 1926, the Supreme Court overturned the sentence and started proceedings against those responsible for the 1913 investigation. Isasa could not be judged because of his sudden death, officially attributed to a heart attack but suspected of being a suicide. |- | Marta del Castillo Casanueva | Miguel Carca\u00f1o Delgado | Seville | January 24, 2009 | October 17, 2011 | A 17-year-old girl who disappeared after leaving home to talk with her ex-boyfriend, the convict.

Laso was the last person to see them alive and claimed that they had run away together to never come back. Although no trace of either was ever found, Laso was arrested and convicted for the murders after he was caught faking evidence intended to make people believe that the victims were alive.

The pond was drained but no body was found. The Perrys then alternated between pleading guilt and innocence, until they were all found guilty and hanged. However, Harrison reappeared in 1662, claiming to have been abducted by Barbary pirates.

Onufrejczyk, who had been previously denounced by Sykut for violence and was about to lose the farm as a result of legal action, offered wildly varying stories to explain his partner's sudden disappearance. He was convicted largely because of the finding of over 2000 blood stains in the passage leading from the farm's kitchen to the backyard, which Onufrejczyk claimed to be from rabbits he had skinned. Police believed that Onufrejczyk dismembered Sykut's body in the kitchen and fed the parts to the pigs.

Afterward, he dismembered the body and buried the pieces in a trench leading to the bog. Carbon 14 dating later showed that the body was nearly 1,800 years old. While Malika's own body was not found, the detailed confession was enough to pronounce her husband guilty. |- | Muriel McKay | Nizamodeen and Arthur Hosein | London | December 29, 1969 | October 6, 1970 | The wife of Alick McKay, deputy of Rupert Murdoch, who was abducted from her home in Wimbledon.
