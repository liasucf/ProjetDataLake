    "text": "The Mining Heritage Trust of Ireland Ltd is a voluntary, not for profit organization to celebrate and promote awareness, appreciation and conservation of remains of what is arguably Ireland's oldest industry. This is an industry which commenced more than 7000 years ago during the Stone Age, and which has, right up to the present day, played an intimate and pivotal role in the evolution of human society, culture and economic activity in Ireland - a contribution most eloquently attested in the names given to the earliest phases of human cultural and societal evolution - the Stone, Copper, Bronze and Iron Ages. The Trust undertakes a range of activities throughout the year; including a newsletter, field meetings, workshops and lectures. Other activities include the ongoing recording of extant mining remains. It publishes an annual journal, The Journal of the Mining Heritage Trust of Ireland (ISSN 1649-0908). == External links == * Category:Non-profit organisations based in the Republic of Ireland Category:Cultural heritage of Ireland ",
