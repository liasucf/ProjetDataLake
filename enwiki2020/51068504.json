    "text": "The honorific prefix Maha Raja Rajya Shri (abbreviated to M. R. Ry or formerly M. R. Ry.) is a style that is used before the names of certain classes of south Indian nobility. ==Usage== The abbreviation of the title is said to be derived from Sanskrit lexicons, the title \"Raja-sry\" being a dyotaka (signifier) for the Kshatriya nobility and Dravidian aristocracy of south India.South Indian Lexicon, A. Muni Swami Aiya, Published by Dakshina Sankrita Sabha, Adyar, 1906 at Page 21 When M. R. Ry. is used before a name, it usually always follows with the suffix Avl. It appears to be used before the names of all chiefs in the southern Indian princely order. For example, cases involving south Indian princes and chiefs in the Privy Council of the United Kingdom include this honorific before personal names and preceding their full title: The Zamorin of Calicut is styled as \"M. R. Ry. Manavikrama, Zamorin Raja Avl of Calicut\" in a Privy Council decision (Laws (PVC)-1925-4-92) and other court cases. It is considered similar to the title \"The Most Noble\" or \"The Most Honourable\" used in the United Kingdom for certain higher classes of the peerage. It is by courtesy used for all higher-ranking officials of the state and sthanom holders (ruling chiefs). The title is reserved for men; the spouse or consort receives no additional style.Indian Court Reference Manual, Fort of St George, Madras 1890 See Chapter under Native Titles and Usage ==Usage examples== Younger members of the ruling families in Travancore, Cochin, and Pudukottai use the title. The Privy Council of the United Kingdom uses the abbreviated version of the title while addressing ruling chiefs of India instead of the courtesy title His Highness. and other court cases. The diarist Ananda Ranga Pillai, also known as the \"Pepys of India\", was styled \"M. R. Ry. Ananda Ranga Pillai Avergal\" in early French documents. Many instances can be found in the London Gazette. ==See also== * Maharaja * Raja * The Most Noble * The Right Honourable * The Much Honoured * Sri ==References== Category:Styles (forms of address) Category:Asian nobility ",
