    "text": "Anja Harteros (born 23 July 1972) is a German soprano. She has a vast repertoire encompassing Mozart, 19th-century German and Italian operas, and Lieder. Her career took off after she won the 1999 Cardiff Singer of the World competition. ==Biography== Harteros was born in Bergneustadt, North Rhine- Westphalia, to a Greek father and a German mother and has two siblings, Alexia and Georgios. As a child, she was encouraged by her parents to pursue classical music and singing. Eventually, her music teacher at the W\u00fcllenweber- Gymnasium in Bergneustadt, August Wilhelm Welp, noticed her considerable talent and recommended that she be professionally educated in singing. In 1986, she started voice training under Astrid Huber-Aulmann in Gummersbach, concurrently with her schooling. In 1990, she began studies with Wolfgang Kastorp, conductor and r\u00e9p\u00e9titeur at the Cologne Opera, who accompanied her in a series of concerts and later became her husband. Her first performances were in music institute concerts and in a school production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1990, as the Countess. In 1992 she gave her first concert at the Kantonsschule Schwyz in Switzerland. After completing high school in 1991, Harteros continued her voice studies under Liselotte Hammes at the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik K\u00f6ln. Her original singing teacher, Huber-Aulmann, continued to teach her until early 1996, and Harteros accompanied Huber-Aulmann on concerts tours in 1993 and 1994 to Russia and the United States, which attracted much attention to the singer. Just before her final exams, she was employed as an ensemble member of the Schillertheater NRW. After her 1996 exams, she joined the ensemble of the Theater Bonn. In the summer of 1999, she won the Cardiff Singer of the World competition, which led to many invitations for concerts and guest performances. This was the major breakthrough for her career: since then, she has appeared as a guest at all the major world opera houses, including the Oper Frankfurt, Op\u00e9ra National de Lyon, De Nederlandse Opera in Amsterdam, Semperoper, Op\u00e9ra Bastille, Hamburg State Opera, Vienna State Opera, New York Metropolitan Opera, Bavarian State Opera, Cologne Opera, and Berlin's Deutsche Oper, as well as the Salzburg Festival. She has also given concerts and Lieder recitals all over Germany, as well as in Boston, Florence, London, Edinburgh, Vicenza and Tel Aviv. Her repertoire includes the roles of Mim\u00ec (La boh\u00e8me), Mica\u00ebla (Carmen), Eva (Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg), Elisabeth (Tannh\u00e4user), Fiordiligi (Cos\u00ec fan tutte), Countess Almaviva (The Marriage of Figaro). In 2004, she sang her first Violetta in La traviata with the San Diego Opera, where she returned the next year for her first Amelia in Simon Boccanegra. In the 2004/05 season, she made four role debuts at the Bavarian State Opera, including Desdemona (Otello), Arabella (Arabella), Alice Ford (Falstaff), and the title role in a new production of H\u00e4ndel's Alcina as a part of the Munich Opera Festival. In February 2011, she debuted in Leonora in concert performances of Verdi's Il trovatore at the K\u00f6lner Philharmonie. Withdrawing from the planned debuting performances as the Marschallin in Strauss' Der Rosenkavalier in San Diego, she assumed the role in Munich and then in Vienna later in the year. In 2015, Harteros with Jonas Kaufmann and Antonio Pappano collaborated on a studio recording of Verdi's Aida. ==Awards== * 2005: Festival Award of the Munich Opera Festival * 2007: Appointed Bavarian Kammers\u00e4ngerin. * 2009: Singer of the Year (S\u00e4ngerin des Jahres) of the Opernwelt magazine * 2010: the first edition of Cologne Opera Award (K\u00f6lner Opernpreiz) * 2013: Bavarian Europa-Medaille * 2015: Singer of the Year in the International Opera Awards * 2017: Singer of the Year (S\u00e4ngerin des Jahres) of the Opernwelt magazine * 2018: Bavarian Order of Merit * 2018: European Cultural Award \"Taurus\" ==Discography== * Bella Voce (2006).
