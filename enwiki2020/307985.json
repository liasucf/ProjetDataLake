She soon developed an interest in writing songs and enlisted the help of her dad, who taught her how to play guitar on his Gibson six-string. When she was thirteen, he bought her a guitar of her own. A flood of songs followed. \"As soon as I learned a new chord,\" she says, \"I wrote a new song.\" She has one sibling, designer Kelly Nishimoto. ==Music career== At eighteen, Meiko left her hometown to showcase her talents to a wider audience.

According to Meiko, her grandmother felt a strong urge to assimilate into American culture and only spoke English to her children, never Japanese, and so, Meiko and her mother never learned much of the language or the culture. After her grandmother's death, she and her sister began to refer to one another as Meiko and Keiko, both Japanese names. However, without a Japanese speaker to help them, they mispronounced them as \"mee-ko\" and \"kee-ko,\" whereas they are actually pronounced \"may-ko\" and \"kay-ko.\" Though Meiko later learned they'd been pronouncing the names incorrectly, they \"didn't have the heart to change it.\" ==Instruments== Meiko has played a Gibson 1951 J-50 and has played many live shows with her Gibson 1942 LG2 which \"doesn't have a pickup.\" Meiko currently plays a Gibson B-25. ==Discography== ===Albums=== *Meiko (2007, self-released), No. 28 Billboard Top Heatseekers *Meiko (2008, Lucky Ear/MySpace/DGC),
