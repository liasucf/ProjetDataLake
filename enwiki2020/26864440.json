Starting in 1858, he attended the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure (rue d'Ulm), earning his agr\u00e9g\u00e9-pr\u00e9parateur three years later. He acquired his doctoral degree in science in 1864. After serving at various posts in secondary education, in 1868 he moved to the Coll\u00e8ge de France to become Henri Victor Regnault's assistant. Mascart was appointed to succeed R\u00e9gnault as the tenured R\u00e9gnault chair in 1872, which he held until his death. In 1878 he also became the first director of the Bureau Central M\u00e9t\u00e9orologique. He won the Bordin Prize of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise in 1866 and the Grand prix of the Acad\u00e9mie des sciences in 1874. He was elected Perpetual Member (1884), Secretary, and in 1904 President, of the Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences, and in 1892, Foreign Member of the British Royal Society. Mascart was elected vice president of the British Institution of Electrical Engineers in 1900, the first non-Briton to hold the post. He was also a grand officier of the L\u00e9gion d'Honneur. Mascart founded Sup\u00e9lec in 1894. Mascart's graduate student Henri B\u00e9nard carried out groundbreaking experiments in thermal convection, as part of his dissertation research, in Mascart's laboratory. B\u00e9nard's doctoral thesis was defended in 1901. Mascart died in Paris at the age of 71. Obituaries were published in the Journal de Physique th\u00e9orique et appliqu\u00e9e.J. de Phys., 4th series, vol. 7, pp. 745-746 (1908). and in Nature.Nature, vol. 78, pp. 446-448 (1908). Mascart's son-in-law Marcel Brillouin and his grandson L\u00e9on Brillouin were also noted scientists. Cape Mascart is named for him. ==References== == Bibliography == * E.
