    "text": "Hazuri Bagh () is a garden in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan, bounded by the Lahore Fort to the east, Badshahi Mosque to the west, the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh to the north, and the Roshnai Gate to the south. The Serai Alamgiri caravanserai formerly stood where Hazuri Bagh is now located. In the centre of the park stands the Hazuri Bagh Baradari, built by Ranjit Singh in 1818 to celebrate his capture of the Koh-i-Noor diamond from Shuja Shah Durrani in 1813. Hazuri Bagh is at the centre of an ensemble of monuments including the Badshahi Mosque, Lahore Fort, Roshnai Gate, and the Samadhi of Ranjit Singh. The garden was planned and built under the supervision of Faqir Azizuddin in the traditional Mughal style layout. After its completion, it is said, Ranjit Singh, at the suggestion of Jamadar Khushhal Singh, ordered that marble vandalized from various mausoleums of Lahore to construct a baradari (pavilion) here. This task was given to Khalifa Nooruddin. Elegant carved marble pillars support the baradari\u2019s delicate cusped arches. The central area, where Ranjit Singh held court, has a mirrored ceiling. Both the garden and the baradari, originally a 45-foot, three-storey square with a basement approached by fifteen steps, suffered extensive damage during the fratricidal Sikh wars and was only reclaimed and laid out according to the original plan during the British period. On 19 July 1932, the uppermost story collapsed and was never reconstructed. Every Sunday afternoon, people gather in the gardens to hear reciters recite traditional Punjabi Qisse, such as Heer Ranjha and Sassi Punnun, and other Punjabi Sufi poetry. The tomb of Muhammad Iqbal lies across from the garden outside of the Badshahi Mosque. == Gallery == File:Badshahi Mosque Sunset.jpg|Hazuri Bagh is at the entryway of Badshahi Mosque File:Muhammad Allama Iqbal\u2019s Tomb.JPG|The Tomb of Allama Iqbal is located within the Hazuri Bagh File:ALLAMA_IQBAL_RESTING_PLACE21.jpg File:Illama_Iqbal_shrine_01.jpg|Iqbal's tomb and the Hazuri Bagh Image:The Hazuri Bagh Pavilion(1870).jpg|Hazuri bagh pavilion in 1870, with Lahore Fort in background Image:Hazuri_Bagh.JPG|South section, with Roshnai Gate in background Image:Hazuri Bagh bardari.jpg|Hazuri Bagh Baradari Image:Bara Dari East & North facing sides of The 12 door building July 1 2005.jpg|Baradari with Badshahi Mosque in background Image:Hazuri Bagh 1.jpg|Hazuri Bagh Image:Hazuri Bagh Baradari with Lahore Fort.jpg|Hazuri Bagh Baradari with Lahore Fort in the background, 2005. == See also == *List of parks and gardens in Lahore *List of parks and gardens in Pakistan *List of gardens *Naulakha pavilion *Sheesh Mahal * List of parks and gardens in Karachi ==References== == External links == * Lahore Photos and History * A photo of Hazuri Bagh * An older photo of Hazuri Bagh *The Herbert Offen Research Collection of the Phillips Library at the Peabody Essex Museum Category:Architecture of Lahore Category:Gardens in Lahore Category:Mughal styled gardens in Pakistan Category:Tourist attractions in Lahore Category:Walled City of Lahore Category:Landscape design history ",
