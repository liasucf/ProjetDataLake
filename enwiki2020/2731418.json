    "text": "Reclus Peninsula is a peninsula on the west coast of Graham Land in Antarctica, enclosing Charlotte Bay to its east. It was first charted in 1898 by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Adrien de Gerlache, who named its northern extremity \"Cap Reclus\" for the French geographer and author Elisee Reclus (1830\u20131905). The UK-APC extended the name Reclus to the entire peninsula in 1960. The peninsula's highest point, at above sea level, is in the Jacques Peaks. Another named feature is Igloo Hill, a completely ice- covered hill, high, in the central part of the peninsula. It was first shown on an Argentine government chart of 1954, and given its descriptive name by the UK Antarctic Place-Names Committee in 1960. == References == Category:Peninsulas of Graham Land Category:Danco Coast ",
