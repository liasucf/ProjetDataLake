He was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously, for bravery in action. ==Personal Life== Naik Sis Pal Singh was born on 26 June 1920 in the small village of Bamla in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, India. He belonged to a traditional military family. Both his father and grandfathers retired as Subedars of the Alwar Infantry of the Alwar State Forces. Both his uncles were also serving in the Jat Regiment since World War I. His great-grandfather served as a Havildar in the Jat Regiment between 1851 and 1871. His own son Jaipal Singh born in 1941, joined the Indian Army as a commissioned officer in the 2nd Lancers (Gardner's Horse) in 1962 and retired as a Major General in 1997. His nephew joined the enlisted ranks of the Indian Air Force in 1959 and retired as a Junior Warrant Officer in 1984. His own grandson became a pilot officer in the Indian Air Force in 1989 and is currently serving as an Air Commodore. ==Military Career== Sis Pal Singh was recruited into 2 Jat battalion of the Jat Regiment in 1940. During the Jammu-Kashmir Operation of 1947, Naik Shishpal\u2019s unit was deployed in Jammu and Kashmir. Naik Shishpal Singh was Platoon leader and was tasked to lead an attack on point 3831 on April, 9, 1948. In the initial stage of the attack itself, he was hit on the thigh by enemy fire but refused evacuation. He tied the wound with the first field dressing and continued to lead his men. On noticing an enemy machine gun firing and causing casualties on his platoon, Naik Shishpal, under intense fire, crawled to it through undergrowth, seized the machine gun barrel out and neutralised the bunker by lobbing a Grenade into it, killing its crew. When the platoon was within assaulting distance, he led his platoon and charged the enemy bunkers with bayonets drawn. Naik Sispal Singh bayoneted three enemy soldiers, however he too was bayoneted in the abdomen. Even after being grievously wounded, he kept exhorting his men to continue with the attack, which was successful and point 3831 was captured. Naik Sispal later died due to his injuries on 10 April 1948. Sis Pal Singh was awarded the Maha Vir Chakra posthumously for his bravery. ==References== Category:Recipients of the Maha Vir Chakra Category:Indian Army personnel Category:People from Haryana Category:1920 births Category:1948 deaths ",
