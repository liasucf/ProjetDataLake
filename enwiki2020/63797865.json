Its leaf resembles that of Eriospermum zeyheri, which has a different distribution range, occurring in the southern Karoo between Barrydale and Grahamstown. It has a short peduncle, compact inflorescence and fragrant, star-like white flowers that appear on the short, conical raceme in February to March. Several related species, such as Eriospermum capense, Eriospermum pubescens and Eriospermum zeyheri, have a similar heart-shaped leaf.Perry, P.L.
