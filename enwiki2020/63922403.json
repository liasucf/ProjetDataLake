It was feared that the law could be used to suppress dissenters against the government. The law has been used to sue and arrest journalists. ==History== Digital Security Act was adopted in October 2018. The provision passed the Parliament of Bangladesh in September 2018. The act was controversial as it would allow police officers to detain people without a warrant. The act was opposed by members of the media, the opposition Jatiya Party, and human rights organizations. The act was created using Section 57 of Information and Communication Technology Act, which was passed in 2006, as the model. The act was protested by the Editors' Council. The Daily Star has been critical of the application of the act, describing it as a gag on the free press. ==Cases== *On 14 April 2020, Journalist Golam Sarwar Pintu, of Dainik Bangladesher Alo, was arrested under Digital Security Act. *On 17 April 2020, Toufique Imrose Khalidi, editor of Bdnews24.com, and Mohiuddin Sarker, editor of Jagonews24.com, for publishing a report on the looting of relief materials in Thakurgaon District. The case was filled by Swechasebak League, the volunteer wing of Bangladesh Awami League, leader Mominul Islam Bhasani. *On 29 April 2020, three journalists were sued in Narsingdi District under the act after publishing news report on an auto rickshaw driver who died after a confrontation with members of Bangladesh Police. The journalists worked for the local newspapers, Dainik Grameen Darpan and Narsingdi Pratidin. The case was filled by officer-in-charge of Ghorashal Police Station, Johirul Alam. *On 6 May 2020, 11 people were sued by the government of Bangladesh by Assistant Director, Abu Bakar Siddique, of unit 3 of Rapid Action Battalion.

According to Amnesty International the act places \"dangerous restrictions on freedom of expression\". It believed the act will be used against dissidents, similar to the way Information and Communication Technology Act was used to detains hundreds of people. The act has been criticized by the United States as something that could be used to suppress free speech. Bangladesh Nationalist Party has called for the act to be repealed. == See also == *Freedom of the press in Bangladesh ==References== Category:Bangladeshi law Category:2018 in law Category:Censorship in Bangladesh Category:Freedom of the press ",
