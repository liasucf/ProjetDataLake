He played college football at Texas Christian University (TCU), and in his final college game led TCU to a win in the 2011 Rose Bowl. He is the all-time leader in wins at Texas Christian University. Dalton was selected by the Cincinnati Bengals in the second round of the 2011 NFL Draft. Under a West Coast-style offensive scheme, Dalton and wide receiver A.J. Green became a prolific quarterback/receiver combination, breaking NFL records for completions and yards for a rookie quarterback/receiver combination. Dalton is one of ten quarterbacks in NFL history to have thrown for over 3,000 yards in each of his first three seasons and one of only six to throw at least 20 touchdowns over the same span. Dalton is the only quarterback to lead the Bengals to five consecutive playoff berths, and one of five quarterbacks to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first five seasons. He is also the Bengals franchise record holder for passing yards in a season, passing touchdowns in a season, and career passing touchdowns. ==High school career== Dalton attended Katy High School in Katy, Texas, where he played on the Tigers football team. He split time as a junior in 2004 and then started only one full season at quarterback for Katy High School as a senior in 2005. That year, he led the Tigers to the state finals, where they lost to Southlake Carroll, 34\u201320. As a senior, he threw for 2,877 yards with 42 touchdowns and 15 interceptions. That year, he was named the Greater Houston Area offensive player of the year by the Houston Chronicle. ==College career== Dalton playing for TCU Dalton committed to Texas Christian University on October 19, 2005. ===Freshman year=== Dalton was redshirted his freshman year, but he traveled with the team to every road game and was listed as the Horned Frogs' third-string quarterback behind senior Jeff Ballard and redshirt freshman Marcus Jackson. ===Sophomore year=== Entering the 2007 season, Dalton was in competition with Jackson to be the starting quarterback. Two weeks before the season opener against Baylor, TCU head coach Gary Patterson named Dalton the starter. He was named the 2007 Texas Bowl MVP in TCU's 20\u201313 victory over Houston. After going 8\u20135 as a freshman, he accumulated a record of 34\u20133 as a starter for the rest of his career at TCU. ===Junior year=== In the 2008 season, Dalton led TCU to an 11\u20132 record, finishing second place in the Mountain West Conference and seventh in the national AP Poll. He was named the 2008 Poinsettia Bowl MVP in the Horned Frogs' 17\u201316 win over Boise State. ===Senior year=== In the 2009 season, Dalton led the Horned Frogs to a perfect 12\u20130 regular season, a Mountain West Conference Championship, a #6 ranking in the AP Poll, and a BCS berth. The Horned Frogs lost 17\u201310 in the Fiesta Bowl to Boise State. On September 4, 2010, Dalton recorded his thirtieth victory as the Horned Frogs starting quarterback, passing Sammy Baugh as TCU's all-time wins leader. Against Baylor, Dalton completed 21 of 23 pass attempts (a career-best and single game record 91.3%) for 267 yards and two touchdowns.Dalton Receives More Awards , Star-Telegram, September 20, 2010. His team won a second consecutive Mountain West Conference Championship. On January 1, 2011, Dalton, who completed 194 of 293 passes for 2638 yards for 26 touchdowns during his senior season, led his team to a 21\u201319 victory over #4 Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. His TCU football team finished the season with a perfect 13\u20130 record and #2 ranking in the AP Poll. Auburn, the only other team with a perfect record, won the BCS National Championship that year. Dalton held school career records for wins (42), passing yards (10,314), pass attempts (1,317), completions (812), and completion percentage (61.6) at the time he graduated, but a few years later, Trevone Boykin surpassed most of Dalton's records.

Out of the twelve quarterbacks that were chosen in the 2011 NFL Draft, he was the fifth selected. Dalton at the 2012 Pro Bowl After Dalton was drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals, there was much speculation over whether Dalton or veteran Bruce Gradkowski would start at quarterback. Carson Palmer, the first overall draft pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, demanded to be traded or released, and was traded later in the season to the Oakland Raiders. On June 29, 2011, the Bengals signed Dalton to a four-year, $5.21 million rookie contract with a $2.29 million signing bonus and $4.02 million guaranteed. On August 8, 2011, before their first pre-season game versus the Detroit Lions, Bengals head coach Marvin Lewis released his first depth chart per NFL rules, but noted that it meant little. The depth chart had Dalton listed as the first-string quarterback, followed by Gradkowski.First depth chart released | Bengals Blog Dalton's first NFL regular season start came on September 11, 2011, on the road against the Cleveland Browns. Dalton, in one half of play before leaving the game due to injury, completed 10 of his 15 pass attempts for 81 yards and one touchdown, posting a passer rating of 102.4. The Bengals won the game, 27\u201317, Dalton's first divisional AFC North victory as well as first win against the divisional rival Browns. Dalton's second game on was also on the road, against the Denver Broncos. Despite a 24\u201322 loss, Dalton led a comeback, completing 19 of 29 pass attempts for 280 yards and 2 touchdowns in the second half alone, and achieving a passer rating of 107.0 for the game. In a 27\u201317 victory against the Indianapolis Colts on October 16, 2011, Dalton completed 25 of 32 passes for 264 yards and 1 touchdown. In that game, Dalton had a season-high 78.1 completion percentage and 111.5 passer rating. On November 3, 2011, Dalton was named the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Month for October. Dalton led the Bengals to a 4\u20130 record with 909 yards passing and 6 touchdowns in the month. Dalton then threw for 217 yards and a season-high 3 touchdowns with no interceptions against the Tennessee Titans in a comeback 24\u201317 victory on November 6, earning him Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Week honors. On November 27, Dalton passed for 270 yards and a touchdown for a 105.6 passer rating in a comeback 23\u201320 victory over the Cleveland Browns, again winning Rookie of the Week. This game featured a 51-yard strike from Dalton to A.J. Green with only 1:08 remaining in the fourth quarter, setting up the Bengals' game-winning field goal. By the end of the season, Dalton had led the Bengals to a 9\u20137 record and a berth in the NFL playoffs. On January 7, 2012, the Bengals faced the T. J. Yates-led Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs. This game marked the first time in NFL playoff history that two rookie quarterbacks started in the same game against each other. Dalton completed over 64 percent of his passes but also had three turnovers as the Texans won the game, 31\u201310. During his rookie season, Dalton had four wins featuring fourth-quarter comebacks (vs. Buffalo, at Jacksonville, at Tennessee, and vs. Cleveland). He became the first quarterback in NFL history not drafted in the first round to start all 16 games of his rookie season. Dalton became just one of five rookie quarterbacks with over 3,000 passing yards and at least 20 touchdown passes, joining fellow rookie Cam Newton and also Peyton Manning, Dan Marino, and Charlie Conerly. At the conclusion of the season, Dalton received the Emerging Player Award from the NFL Players Association during the NFLPA PULSE Awards. The other nominees for the award were Carolina Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, New Orleans Saints tight end Jimmy Graham, New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, and Detroit Lions defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh. Dalton was named initially as a Pro Bowl Alternate in his first year, and was added to the AFC Pro Bowl roster after the New England Patriots won the AFC Championship, forcing Tom Brady to withdraw. Dalton and Newton became the first pair of rookie quarterbacks to make the Pro Bowl in the same season. During the 2012 Pro Bowl, Dalton threw for 99 yards and 2 touchdowns for a passer rating of 152.1. ====2012 season==== In the second game of the season on September 16, 2012, Dalton guided the Bengals to a 34\u201327 victory at home over the Cleveland Browns. He completed 24 of 31 passes for 318 yards, 3 touchdowns, and an interception, for a 128.2 passer rating. In the following game at the Washington Redskins, Dalton completed 19-of-27 passes for 328 yards, 3 touchdowns, and an interception, for a season-high 132.9 passer rating, in leading the Bengals to a 38\u201331 win. Furthermore, Dalton lined up as a wide receiver on the first play from scrimmage of the game, acting as a decoy while wildcat quarterback Mohamed Sanu threw a 73-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Green, then again flanked as a receiver while BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushed for a touchdown via a direct snap. The following week at the Jacksonville Jaguars, Dalton threw for 244 yards and had three touchdowns (two passing, one rushing) in leading the Bengals to a 27\u201310 victory. On October 14, 2012, Dalton threw for a career-high 381 yards to go with three touchdowns against the Cleveland Browns, but also threw three interceptions as the Bengals fell to the Browns 34\u201324. This was the second game in what would become a four-game losing streak. Dalton and the Bengals rebounded by defeating the New York Giants in a 31\u201313 game, in which Dalton completed 21 of 30 passes for 199 yards and a season-high four touchdowns, attaining a 127.6 passer rating and a season-high 94.5 QBR. For his efforts against the Giants, Dalton was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the first time in his career. The following week, the Bengals beat the Kansas City Chiefs 28\u20136 as Dalton completed 18 of 29 passes for 230 yards and two touchdowns thrown (a 109.8 passer rating) while adding a rushing touchdown. On November 25, 2012, in a much-hyped game with the Oakland Raiders due to the return of former Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer to Cincinnati, Dalton outperformed Palmer by throwing for 210 yards and three touchdowns, achieving a 109.0 passer rating, and leading the Bengals to a 34\u201310 victory. In the fourth quarter, an unnecessary roughness penalty by Lamarr Houston on Dalton was one part of a sequence of events leading to the ejections of Andrew Whitworth, Tommy Kelly, and Houston from the game. With his performance, Dalton became one of three players in NFL history with at least 20 touchdown passes in each of his first two seasons, joining Peyton Manning and Dan Marino. In two of the next three following weeks, Dalton's mobility proved to be valuable as he scrambled for the go-ahead touchdown runs in victories over the San Diego Chargers and Philadelphia Eagles. On December 23, 2012 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, his 21-yard throw to A.J. Green with fourteen seconds remaining set up the game- winning field goal, propelling the Bengals to a 13\u201310 victory and a second consecutive berth in the NFL playoffs. This game marked the first time Dalton was able to defeat the divisional rival Steelers, and the first time the Bengals made the playoffs in consecutive seasons since 1981\u20131982. The following week, Dalton threw for a touchdown and a 101.5 quarterback rating in one half of play in a 23\u201317 Bengals win over the Baltimore Ravens. This marked Dalton's first victory over the divisional rival Ravens and capped a 10\u20136 regular season record. On January 5, 2013, Dalton and the Bengals faced the Houston Texans in the wild-card round of the NFL playoffs. In a defensive struggle with neither Dalton nor Texans quarterback Matt Schaub able to pass for a touchdown, the Bengals lost 19\u201313, the second consecutive year the Bengals fell to the Texans in the opening round of the playoffs. With 2:57 remaining in the fourth quarter, Dalton overthrew an open A.J. Green for what would have been the go-ahead touchdown. ====2013 season==== On September 8, 2013, Dalton completed 26 of 33 passes for a career-high 78.8 completion percentage, 282 yards, two touchdowns, two interceptions (arguably neither interception his fault), and a 91.8 QBR as the Bengals fell to the Chicago Bears, 24\u201321. The following week, Dalton threw for 280 yards and a touchdown as the Bengals beat the Pittsburgh Steelers 20\u201310. Then, Dalton completed 20 of 28 passes for 235 yards, two touchdowns, and an interception for a 105.5 passer rating in leading the Bengals to a 34\u201330 victory over the Green Bay Packers. On October 13, 2013, after two games without a touchdown pass (in a loss at the Cleveland Browns and a victory over the New England Patriots), Dalton rebounded by completing 26 of 40 passes for 337 yards, three touchdowns, and an interception for a 105.9 passer rating in a 27\u201324 overtime victory at the Buffalo Bills. For his efforts in that game, Dalton was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Week. Then, he completed 24 of 34 passes for 372 yards and three touchdowns for a 92.8 QBR and a 135.9 passer rating in leading the Bengals to victory at the Detroit Lions, 27\u201324. The following week, Dalton completed 19 of 30 passes for 325 yards, a career-high five touchdowns, and an interception in merely three quarters of play for a 125.7 passer rating and a career-high 98.9 QBR in a 49\u20139 win over the New York Jets. At the end of October, Dalton was named AFC Offensive Player of the Month. On October 31, 2013, Dalton began another difficult two-game stretch. He passed for 338 yards at the Miami Dolphins but also had three interceptions, most critically one that bounced off the hands of Mohamed Sanu that if caught by Sanu likely would have sealed a victory for the Bengals, who ended up losing 22\u201320 in overtime; Dalton was sacked by Cameron Wake in the end zone in overtime for a safety to end the game. The following week, Dalton passed for 274 yards at the Baltimore Ravens with two touchdowns, most notably a 51-yard Hail Mary touchdown pass against the wind to A.J. Green as time expired in regulation, but also had three interceptions as the Bengals lost 20\u201317 in overtime. Dalton continued his struggles against the Cleveland Browns, as he threw two interceptions in the first quarter. However, he rebounded to throw three consecutive touchdowns as well, as the Bengals won the game 41\u201320. After an early interception at the San Diego Chargers, Dalton again rebounded by passing for 149 yards and a touchdown in the second half as the Bengals won 17\u201310. On December 8, 2013, Dalton continued his upswing. He completed 24 of 35 passes for 275 yards and four total touchdowns against the Indianapolis Colts, attaining an 89.2 QBR and 120.5 passer rating in a 42\u201328 victory. Although the Bengals lost at the Pittsburgh Steelers the following week, Dalton was able to pass for 230 yards and two touchdowns while overcoming six dropped passes by his receivers. For the second time in the 2013 season, he earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors. Dalton continued his December success the following week by completing 27 of 38 passes for 366 yards and four touchdowns for a 92.0 QBR and a career-high 136.5 passer rating in defeating the Minnesota Vikings 42\u201314. With this game, Dalton and the Bengals became the 2013 AFC North Division Champions and Dalton had earned his third consecutive berth to the NFL playoffs, becoming just one of five NFL quarterbacks to make the playoffs in each of his first three seasons. While the Bengals beat the Baltimore Ravens 34\u201317 the following week, Dalton struggled, scoring three total touchdowns and passing for 281 yards but also four interceptions. Dalton finished the regular season with 4,293 passing yards for 34 passing touchdowns, 20 interceptions, and an 88.8 passer rating. His passing yards and touchdowns were both career highs and Bengals single season franchise records. In the Bengals wildcard playoff game against the San Diego Chargers, Dalton threw his first career postseason touchdown pass. However, he also threw two interceptions and lost a fumble, on three consecutive possessions in the second half, as the Bengals lost the game by a score of 27\u201310. After the game Dalton was heavily criticized for his poor play and consistent failure to advance in the playoffs. In his eight 2013 primetime (SNF, MNF, TNF, playoffs), and/or AFC North intradivisional games, Dalton completed 192 of 349 passes (55.0 completion percentage) for 2,036 passing yards, 5.83 yards per attempt, 11 passing touchdowns, 16 interceptions, and a 63.6 passer rating. In his other nine games of 2013, Dalton completed 200 of 288 passes (69.4 completion percentage) for 2,594 passing yards, 9.01 yards per attempt, 23 passing touchdowns, 7 interceptions, and a 114 passer rating. Such performances have raised doubt about whether Dalton is a \"big-game\" quarterback. ====2014 season==== 2014 On August 4, 2014, Dalton received a six-year extension that could be worth as much as $115 million, with team performance-based incentives. He started the season with three wins. In Week 1, Dalton threw the game-winning 77-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Green to beat the Baltimore Ravens 23\u201316, Dalton's first win on the road against the Ravens. In Week 3, he caught an 18-yard touchdown pass from Mohamed Sanu against the Tennessee Titans in a 33\u20137 victory. It was the first time a quarterback had caught a touchdown pass since former Chiefs quarterback Tyler Thigpen caught a 37-yard pass from wide receiver Mark Bradley in 2008. Dalton was the first quarterback ever to catch a touchdown pass for the Bengals. Following the Bengals' first loss of the 2014 season against the New England Patriots, the Bengals were involved in a tie for the second time in the past seven seasons. With the score tied at 37 in overtime against the Carolina Panthers, Dalton completed 5 of 7 passes for 49 yards, but kicker Mike Nugent pushed the field goal wide right. Dalton threw for a season-high 323 yards, along with two touchdowns and two interceptions. This was followed by a meager 126 yards in a shutout loss to the Colts. In the second match-up against Baltimore in Game 7, Dalton led an 80-yard drive in the games' final four minutes and ran in a quarterback sneak from one yard out to give the Bengals a 27\u201324 win, his second game-winning drive of the season, both against Baltimore. Following a win over Jacksonville, the Bengals reached the season midpoint at 5\u20132\u20131. Dalton had a historically terrible performance against the Cleveland Browns in Game 9, where he completed 10 of 33 passes for 86 total yards with three interceptions to earn a 2.0 passer rating; the lowest by an NFL quarterback with 25 pass attempts since 2004 and the 11th lowest in history., and since 1950. See list at pro-football-reference.com. He responded with 220 yards and three touchdowns for a season-best rating of 143.9 in a 27\u201310 win over the New Orleans Saints, and his first career win in four attempts against the Texans in Game 11. In Game 12 (11/30), Dalton rebounded from three first half interceptions to run for a touchdown and throw for another in a 14\u201313 Bengals' win over the Buccaneers on the road. It marked the fourth consecutive year that Dalton had won three games against the NFC, extending his record to 12\u20133\u20131 against the opposite conference. The Bengals lost Game 13 against Pittsburgh despite Dalton's solid 128.8 rating and 20-yard touchdown run (the longest ever by a Bengals quarterback), then shutout Cleveland despite his 53.6 rating. In Game 15, Dalton threw two touchdowns and an interception in a 37\u201328 win over the Broncos to help the Bengals clinch a playoff berth for a franchise-record fourth straight year. In the season's final game, Dalton threw two first-half interceptions at Pittsburgh, but led an 89-yard fourth quarter drive capped by a five-yard touchdown pass to Jermaine Gresham, to cut the deficit to 20\u201317, but despite a streak of 11 of 12 passes for 101 yards, A.J. Green fumbled inside Steelers' territory to seal the 27\u201317 loss and a #5 wild card seed in the playoffs. Playing without many of his offensive weapons against the Indianapolis Colts in the Wild Card round, Dalton led the Bengals to their fourth straight playoff loss by a score of 26\u201310, with a 155-yard, no touchdown, no interception effort. On January 20, 2015, it was announced that Dalton was selected to the 2015 Pro Bowl, his second Pro Bowl appearance, replacing Aaron Rodgers of the Green Bay Packers (calf injury). Dalton completed 9 of his 20 passes for 69 yards. ====2015 season==== Baltimore in 2015 The Bengals began the 2015 season on a historic winning streak. In the first game, Dalton threw his 100th career touchdown pass, which was to tight end Tyler Eifert, in the second quarter. Cincinnati won the game, 33\u201313, with Dalton throwing for 269 yards and two touchdowns. In the Bengals' Week 2 home opener, Dalton threw three touchdowns and zero interceptions in a 24\u201319 defeat of the San Diego Chargers. It marked the fourth straight home-opening win for the Bengals and the 15th three-touchdown performance for Dalton. He threw for a career-high 383 yards and three touchdowns in Week 3 against the Baltimore Ravens, 321 yards in Week 4 against the Kansas City Chiefs, and 331 yards in a Week 5 game where Dalton also threw two touchdowns and ran for one as he led the Bengals back from a fourth quarter 24\u20137 deficit to a 27\u201324 overtime win over the Seattle Seahawks. This was the second biggest comeback in franchise history. In a 34\u201321 win over the Buffalo Bills; in week 6, Dalton completed 22 of 33 passes for 243 yards with three touchdowns. Dalton was named the AFC Offensive Player of the Month for October. Following a bye week, Dalton led the Bengals to another fourth quarter comeback against the Pittsburgh Steelers on the road. The 16\u201310 win gave the Bengals their first 7\u20130 start in franchise history. They extended this to 8\u20130 with Dalton's 139.8 passer rating in a victory over Cleveland. Dalton failed to reach 200 yards passing for the first time in Game 9, a 10\u20136 loss to the Houston Texans. Despite 315 passing yards and two scoring drives in less than four minutes in the late fourth quarter to tie the game, the Bengals lost Game 10 to the Arizona Cardinals. Dalton bounced back with three touchdowns and a 121.4 rating in a Game 11 win over the St. Louis Rams, and a career-high passer rating of 146.8 in a Game 12 victory over the Cleveland Browns. Early in Game 13 on December 13, Dalton fractured the thumb on his throwing hand while tackling Stephon Tuitt after an intercepted shovel pass, missing the season's final three games (replacement AJ McCarron was 2\u20131 with a 97.1 passer rating). Dalton finished the year with 3,250 yards, 25 touchdowns, and 7 interceptions. He was the first Bengal ever to throw for more than 20 touchdown passes with fewer than 10 interceptions in franchise history.See list of Bengals with 20+ touchdowns and <15 interceptions at pro-football-reference.com. Dalton's 106.2 passer rating ranked No. 2 and his 8.4 yards per attempt ranked No. 3 among NFL quarterbacks in 2015. He was ranked 35th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016. The Bengals' season ended when they lost to the Steelers 18\u201316 on January 9, 2016 in the AFC Wild Card Round. Dalton had the cast for his broken thumb removed five days before the game, but did not play. ====2016 season==== Dalton began the 2016 season with back-to-back 366 yard games, overcoming seven sacks for a 55-yard game-winning drive in the 23\u201322 victory over the New York Jets in Week 1, but losing in Week 2 to the Pittsburgh Steelers. After an off-night of 206 yards, zero touchdowns, and an interception in a loss to the Denver Broncos, Dalton completed 69.5% of his passes for 1,127 yards, six touchdowns, and zero interceptions in four straight 100+ passer rating games.

Dalton had 332 yards and a 130.0 passer rating in a Game 12 win over the Philadelphia Eagles, but averaged just 208 yards over the season's last four games.

After Dalton helped the Bengals defeat the Baltimore Ravens in Week 17 of the 2017 season, which allowed the Buffalo Bills to enter the playoffs, many Bills fans donated to his foundation in gratitude for helping their team snap their 17-year playoff drought. In less than a week, donations exceeded $360,000 from over 16,000 donors. Most donations were in the amount of $17, which symbolized the 17-year playoff drought that ended with the Bengals' victory over the Ravens. Dalton and his wife thanked Buffalo Bills fans by renting five billboards in Buffalo area that read \"Thank you Buffalo and good luck.\" He has been nicknamed the \"Red Rifle\", a reference to his arm strength and hair color. ==See also== * List of Division I FBS passing yardage leaders * List of National Football League career passing yards leaders * List of National Football League career passing touchdowns leaders * List of National Football League quarterback playoff records ==References== ==External links== * Dallas Cowboys bio * TCU Horned Frogs bio * Andy & Jordan Dalton Foundation Category:1987 births Category:Living people Category:People from Katy, Texas Category:American Christians Category:Sportspeople from Harris County, Texas Category:Players of American football from Texas Category:American football quarterbacks Category:TCU Horned Frogs football players Category:Cincinnati Bengals players Category:Dallas Cowboys players Category:American Conference Pro Bowl players Category:Unconferenced Pro Bowl players ",
