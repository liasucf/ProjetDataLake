    "text": "William Jan Pucovski (born 2 February 1998) is an Australian cricketer. He made his List A debut for Cricket Australia XI against the Pakistanis during their tour of Australia on 10 January 2017. He made his first-class debut for Victoria in the 2016\u201317 Sheffield Shield season on 1 February 2017. In March 2018, he suffered a second concussion from bouncers in two years, the second of which was bowled by Sean Abbott. Pucovski was well enough to walk off the field unaided. In October 2018, he became only the second player representing Victoria in the Sheffield Shield, after Dean Jones, to hit a double century against the Western Australia cricket team at the WACA. However, later the same month, he had to take a break from cricket, due to a mental health- related illness. In January 2019, he was named in Australia's Test squad for the series against Sri Lanka. After being named in the squad for the Test series, Pucovski said that it's every kid's dream to play for their country, and that getting that opportunity was \"just amazing\". However, he was not selected to play in either match during the series, and was released from the squad at the start of the Canberra Test, allowing him to continue to work on his mental health. Ahead of the 2019\u201320 Marsh One-Day Cup, Pucovski was named as one of the six cricketers to watch during the tournament. ==Personal life== Pucovski's father Jan, has Czechoslovakian roots, migrated to Australia when he was seven years of age. Jan also played cricket, as a fast bowler, and was regarded as a \"Caulfield legend.\" He was awarded the Bradman Young Cricketer of the Year at the Allan Border Medal ceremony by Cricket Australia in 2019.https://www.cricketaustralia.com.au/about/awards-and-events/australian- cricket-awards ==References== ==External links== * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:Australian cricketers Category:Cricket Australia XI cricketers Category:Cricketers from Melbourne Category:Victoria cricketers Category:Australian people of Czechoslovak descent ",
