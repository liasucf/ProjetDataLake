    "text": "The Count The Count is Charlie Chaplin's fifth film for Mutual Film Corporation in 1916. Released on September 4, it co-starred Eric Campbell and Edna Purviance. ==Synopsis== The tailor's handyman (played by Chaplin) burns a count's trousers while ironing them and is fired. His superior (Campbell) discovers a note explaining the count can't attend a party, and dresses up like one to take his place. Chaplin also goes to the residence hosting the party, but runs into the tailor. They both then struggle to win the fair maiden, Miss Moneybags (Purviance). Soon, Charlie is distracted by a gypsy girl and the tailor must fend off other suitors. The real Count finally arrives, learns of the imposters and calls the police. Chaplin makes a mad dash through the party and scampers away to safety. ==Review== The Count received this positive review from the Chicago Tribune: \"It has story, speed, and spontaneity. The fun is not forced--it just bubbles out. A good deal of the originality prevails and utter respectability. Some squeamish folks may take exception to Mr. Chaplin holding his nose while eating strong cheese, scratching is head with a fork, and washing his ears with watermelon juice at the table. But these vulgarities pass quickly and can be forgotten in the stress of the high comedy of the soup and the dance. Mr. Chaplin has his capacity for serious playing, but he is foremost as a clown and here he clowns superbly.\" ==Cast== * Charles Chaplin - Tailor's apprentice * Edna Purviance - Miss Moneybags * Eric Campbell - Tailor * Leo White - Count Broko * Charlotte Mineau - Mrs. Moneybags * Albert Austin - Tall Guest * John Rand - Guest * Leota Bryan - Young Girl * Frank J.
