Kleczy\u0144ski writes about 1817 or the next year. was Polish pianist and composer. == Life and compositions == J\u00f3zef Wielhorski was born in Rusin\u00f3w, Radom Governorate, in 1817 or 1818. His parents were count J\u00f3zef Wielhorski and Salomea Dembi\u0144ska (daughter of Wolbromska). When young Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin visited Rusin\u00f3w, J\u00f3zef swooned by listening to him playing piano. While studying at Berlin university, he took lessons from Wilhelm Taubert. He married Marya I\u017cycka, but this marriage provided no children. Wielhorski was neither a professional virtuoso, nor a professional composer. He highly esteemed Mozart's music. According to Polish musician Jan Kleczy\u0144ski, his own compositions, though being mostly bagatelles, valses and mazurkas, bear little reminiscences to those of Chopin. Another of his favorite genres was march. His compositions did not gain success even during his life, and he was not interested in this. Kleczy\u0144ski explained such a failure through their relative difficulty: Wielhorski asks for much larger hands than was typical in salon music. His friend, the composer Aleksander Zarzycki performed some pieces by Wielhorski in concerts. He died in a hotel in Sanremo, Italy, in an elevator accident. == References == == Sources == * Nekrologia. \u2013 Warsaw: Echo Muzyczne, 1892, No. 442 (March 19/7), p. 142. * Jan Kleczy\u0144ski.
