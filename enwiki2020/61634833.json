Tetradrachms of the kings of Bactria Diodotus and Eucratides were among these discoveries. In 1972, another 36 Greek coins were found.

In the twentieth century, more than 100 treasures of various sizes were discovered. The time range of coins is from the fifth through seventh centuries, with the exception of a third century Sassanid treasure, found in village Chukhur-Gabala. The high prevalence of Sassanid coins is explained by the strengthened military and administrative influence of the Sassanid Empire on caucasian Albania. Even after the fall of the Sassanid Empire, coins Sassanid were circulated in Albania and coins were found in Arabic Caliphate treasuries. ==== Byzantium ==== The first Byzantine coins dated from the reign of Constantine I. Its main locations were southeastern regions of Azerbaijan. Both Byzantine and Sassanid Empire empires tried to influence border surroundings. One of the last Byzantine treasures was found in the seventh century. Due to the Arab invasion, Byzantine coins ceased to flow to Azerbaijan until the tenth century. The youngest Byzantine coin in Azerbaijan belongs to the eleventh century. ==== Caliphate ==== Caliphate coins came to use immediately after Azerbaijan was occupied by the Arabic Caliphate. Mints were located in al-Yazidiyye, Bailakan, Ganja and al-Mutavakkiliye. Names of cities and names of Caliphs appeared in the eighth century. The youngest Caliphate coin is dated to the eighth century. == Gallery == File:Silver tetradrachm, Macedonia, Alexander III.jpg|Silver tetradrachm, Macedonia, Alexander III File:Treasuey from Nuydi with silver coins of Caucasian Albania (copies of Alexander the Great coins).JPG|Treasuey from Nuydi with silver coins of Caucasian Albania File:Silver dirham of Umayyads minted in Damascus.jpg|Silver dirham of Umayyads minted in Damascus File:Silver denarius, Roma (empire), Augustus.jpg|Silver denarius, Roma (empire), Augustus == References == Category:History museums in Azerbaijan Category:Numismatics ",
