    "text": "The Regroupement des militants syndicaux or RMS (in English: Trade-Union Militants Grouping) was a political organization founded in 1974 by members of the Groupe socialiste des travailleurs du Qu\u00e9bec involved in the three main trade-unions in Quebec (FTQ, CSN and CEQ) to rally trade unionists into political action. On the political scene, the RMS was deeply involved in the creation of a left-of-centre political party in Montreal, the Rassemblement des citoyens de Montr\u00e9al (Montreal Citizens Movement) in 1974. It also initiated with the Nouveau Parti d\u00e9mocratique du Qu\u00e9bec a coalition that contested seats in the 1976 Quebec general election. The RMS ended its activities in 1981. ==See also== * Coalition New Democratic Party of Quebec - Regroupement des militants syndicaux candidates, 1976 Quebec provincial election * Politics of Quebec * List of political parties in Canada#Quebec ==External links== * National Assembly historical information * La Politique qu\u00e9b\u00e9coise sur le Web Category:Provincial political parties in Quebec Category:Socialist parties in Canada Category:Political parties established in 1974 Category:Political parties disestablished in 1981 Category:1974 establishments in Quebec Category:1981 disestablishments in Canada ",
