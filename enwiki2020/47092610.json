    "text": "Nuragic warrior from Padria panoplies based on bronze statuettes The Nuragic bronze statuettes (bronzetti in Italian, brunzittos or brunzittus in Sardinian) are typical Nuragic Sardinian bronze sculptures of the final phase of the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age. During the archaeological excavations in Sardinia, more than 500 of these bronze statuettes have been discovered, mainly in places of worship like the holy wells and the so-called megara temples but also in villages and nuraghes. Several statues were also found in excavations carried out in central Italy and precisely in Etruscan tombs of the 9th-8th century BC. Probably obtained with the lost wax technique, they can measure up to 39 cm. They represent scenes of everyday life of the nuragic people, depicting characters from various social classes, animal figures, warriors, chiefs, divinities, everyday objects and ships. Archaeologists have not been able yet to date the figures accurately: they were allegedly made between the IX\u00b0 century BC and the VI\u00b0 century BC; however, the recent discoveries at Orroli and at Ballao of fragments of bronze statues dating from the XIII\u00b0 century BC have called into question their effective date. Arcaehologist Ralph A. Gonzalez dated the earliest types of bronze statuettes to the 12-11th century BC. ==Gallery== File:Bronzetto nuragico Sulcis.jpg|Nuragic warrior from Sulcis (Pigorini National Museum of Prehistory and Ethnography, Rome) File:Bronzetti nuragici al museo Archeologico di Cagliari.jpg|Some Nuragic statuettes on display at the National Archaeological Museum of Cagliari (Sardinia) File:Bronzetto Nuragico 21.JPG|Nuragic bronze statuette nicknamed \"the mother of the killed\" found in Urzulei File:BRONZETTO-BIS.jpg|Nuragic statuette found in the Etruscan city of Vulci.
