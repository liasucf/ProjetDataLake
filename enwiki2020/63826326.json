After compiling a record of 8\u20130 (2 KOs), he faced Andy Keates for the vacant English welterweight title on 20 October 2018 at the Harvey Hadden Sports Village in Nottingham, England. Essuman knocked Keates down twice in the fourth round en route to a fifth-round technical knockout (TKO). He returned to the Harvey Hadden Sports Village for his next fight, successfully defending his English title against former British super- lightweight champion, Tyrone Nurse, via majority decision (MD) on 16 March 2019. Two judges scored the bout in favour of Essuman with 98\u201393 and 96\u201394 while the third scored it a draw at 95\u201395. After a stoppage win over William Warburton in July and a PTS victory over Zygimantas Butkevicius in October, Essuman finished 2019 with a second defence of his title on 30 November, defeating Curtis Felix Jr via eighth-round TKO at the York Hall in London. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |14 |Win |14\u20130 |align=left| Cedrick Peynaud |UD |10 |12 Sep 2020 |align=left| |align=left| |- |13 |Win |13\u20130 |align=left| Curtis Felix Jr |TKO |8 (10), |30 Nov 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |12 |Win |12\u20130 |align=left| Zygimantas Butkevicius |PTS |6 |19 Oct 2019 |align=left| | |- |11 |Win |11\u20130 |align=left| William Warburton |RTD |6 (8), |6 Jul 2019 |align=left| | |- |10 |Win |10\u20130 |align=left| Tyrone Nurse |MD |10 |16 Mar 2019 |align=left| |align=left| |- |9 |Win |9\u20130 |align=left| Andy Keates |TKO |5 (10), |20 Oct 2018 |align=left| |align=left| |- |8 |Win |8\u20130 |align=left| Edvinas Puplauskas |PTS |6 |15 Sep 2018 |align=left| | |- |7 |Win |7\u20130 |align=left| Nelson Altamirano |TKO |1 (8), |31 Mar 2018 |align=left| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |align=left| Jordan Grannum |PTS |6 |16 Dec 2017 |align=left| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |align=left| Serge Ambomo |PTS |8 |21 Oct 2017 |align=left| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |align=left| Arvydas Trizno |PTS |4 |24 Jun 2017 |align=left| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |align=left| Casey Blair | |3 (4), |22 Apr 2017 |align=left| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |align=left| Kevin McCauley |PTS |4 |4 Feb 2017 |align=left| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |align=left| Andrej Cepur | |4 |1 Dec 2016 |align=left| | |- |} ==References== Category:Living people Category:1989 births Category:Botswana male boxers Category:British male boxers Category:Welterweight boxers Category:Light-middleweight boxers ",
