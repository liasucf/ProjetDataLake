    "text": "The Blackville\u2013Hilda High School shooting was a school shooting that occurred on October 12, 1995, at Blackville\u2013Hilda High School in Blackville, South Carolina, United States. The gunman, 16-year-old Anthony Sincino, was a student at Blackville\u2013Hilda High School who was suspended from school at the time of the shooting. He fatally shot one teacher and wounded another teacher before he committed suicide. == Incident == On October 12, 1995, the perpetrator entered through a back door armed with a .32 caliber revolver and entered the classroom of a math teacher Johnny Thompson and shot him in the face. He exited the room and confronted another math teacher Phyllis Senn who was later found dead in the teachers work room. Ms. Senn was believed to have died of a heart attack but an autopsy revealed that she was killed by a gun shot. A student that was in the room across the hall from the first victim, stated that Sincino did not look angry or mad during the shooting, but that he looked like he did not know exactly what he was doing. Sincino's body was later found outside the school office door after he committed suicide. == Perpetrator == A friend of Sincino blamed racial tensions between black students and white teachers within the school for the shooting. Relatives also claimed that as Sincino was under 5 feet tall at 16-years-old, he had been picked on throughout his time at school by being shoved in lockers and dumped upside down into trashcans. However, Sincino had a history of disciplinary problems within the school, and had been expelled from the school in 1994 and had been readmitted in 1995, and faced automatic expulsion due to an obscene gesture made on a school bus. ==References== Category:Barnwell County, South Carolina Category:School killings in the United States Category:Murder in South Carolina Category:1995 murders in the United States Category:1995 in South Carolina Category:Murder\u2013suicides in South Carolina Category:Crimes in South Carolina Category:October 1995 events in the United States Category:High school shootings in the United States Category:1995 mass shootings in the United States Category:Mass shootings in the United States Category:School shootings committed by minors ",
