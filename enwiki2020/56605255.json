They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the D'Assas-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of six guns supported by four guns and they had a top speed of . All three ships began service in the Mediterranean Squadron in the late 1890s, though D'Assas was later transferred to the Northern Squadron in 1901 and then to French Indochina in 1904. Du Chayla supported an amphibious landing in French Morocco in 1907 and Cassard joined her there the following year. D'Assas was discarded in 1914, but the other two members of the class saw service during World War I, primarily patrolling the Atlantic for German commerce raiders. Both ships were partially disarmed late in the conflict and Cassard became a gunnery training ship while Du Chayla remained in active service. She took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919 before being sold to ship breakers in 1920, while Cassard lingered on in service until 1924, when she, too, was sold for scrap. ==Design== The earlier cruiser , which provided the basis for the D'Assas design In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized the most modern ironclad battleships\u2014the and es\u2014into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a \"two-power standard\" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies. The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further outcry to strengthen the fleet. To compound matters, the visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy confirmed French concerns of a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships. To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty- four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The D'Assas class were ordered to as part of the program, and were very similar to the earlier s. ===General characteristics and machinery=== D'Assas steaming at high speed The D'Assas-class cruisers were long between perpendiculars and long overall, with a beam of and a draft of . displaced , while the other two vessels displaced . D'Assas suffered from stability problems and reportedly sat lower in the water than her sister ships. The ships' hulls featured a pronounced ram bow and a tumblehome shape, which were common characteristics of major French warships of the period. They had a flush deck with a sloped stern. Their superstructure consisted of a main conning tower with a bridge forward and a smaller, secondary conning tower aft. The ships were fitted with a pair of pole masts with spotting tops for observation and signaling purposes. Their crew varied over the course of their careers and ranged from 370 to 392 officers and enlisted men. The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by twenty coal-burning Lagrafel d'Allest water-tube boilers that were ducted into three funnels on the centerline amidships. Their machinery was rated to produce for a top speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which permitted a cruising radius of at and at 20 knots. ===Armament and armor=== A 164 mm gun mounted on a river gunboat during World War I The ships were armed with a main battery of six Mod\u00e8le 1893 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual pivot mounts; one was on the forecastle, two were in sponsons abreast the forward conning tower, another pair was in sponsons further aft, and the last was on the stern. The guns fired a variety of shells, including solid cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor- piercing shells. The muzzle velocity ranged from . These were supported by a secondary battery of four Mod\u00e8le 1891 guns, which were carried in pivot mounts in the conning towers, one on each side per tower. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried ten 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and five 1-pounder guns. The ships were also armed with two torpedo tubes in their hull above the waterline. The torpedoes were the M1892 variant, which carried a warhead and had a range of at a speed of . Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, increasing to on the sides that sloped down to the side of the hull. Above the deck at the sides, a cofferdam filled with cellulose was intended to contain flooding from damage below the waterline. Below the main deck, a thin splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments. The conning tower had 100 mm thick plating on the sides. ==Construction== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120\" | Name ! width=\"90\" | Laid down ! width=\"90\" | Launched ! width=\"90\" | Completed ! width=\"90\" | Shipyard |- | | 1894 | 28 March 1896 | March 1898 | , Saint-Nazaire |- | | 1894 | 27 May 1896 | February 1898 | , Cherbourg |- | | March 1894 | 10 November 1895 | February 1898 | , Cherbourg |} ==Service history== Cassard, date unknown D'Assas and Cassard initially served with the Mediterranean Squadron after entering service in 1898, and they were joined by Du Chayla the following year. In 1901, D'Assas had been transferred to the Northern Squadron, based in the English Channel. During this period, they were occupied with routine peacetime training exercises with the rest of the main French fleets in home waters. D'Assas was deployed to the cruiser squadron based in French Indochina in East Asia, and in 1905, she assisted with the unsuccessful attempt to re-float the armored cruiser after it ran aground. By that time, Cassard had been reduced to reserve. In August 1907, Du Chayla supported an amphibious assault in French Morocco during the Bombardment of Casablanca. Cassard was reactivated in 1908 for a deployment to French Morocco. D'Assas returned home that year and was converted into a fast minelayer, along with Cassard. D'Assas was struck from the naval register in 1914; she was then sold to ship breakers. At the start of World War I in August 1914, Cassard initially operated out of Morocco, patrolling for German U-boats. Du Chayla was also assigned to patrol duty in the Atlantic, but she, too, saw no action. In September, Cassard bombarded local villages in Morocco to suppress challenges to French colonial rule. The ship was later transferred to the western Mediterranean and Red Seas, along with a deployment to the Indian Ocean in 1917. By 1918, Du Chayla had been partially disarmed to supply weapons to the French Army. She took part in the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War in 1919 but was recalled to France in 1920, where she was struck from the naval register in 1921 and sold to ship breakers. In the meantime, Cassard was partially disarmed after World War I and was converted into a gunnery training ship, though she was struck from the register in 1924 and sold for scrap. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Cruiser classes Category:Ships built in France Category:World War I cruisers of France Category:1890s ships ",
