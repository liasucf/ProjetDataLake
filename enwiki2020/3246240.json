    "text": "\"Whatever U Want\" is a song by American singer Christina Milian. It was written by Bradley Spalter, Lambert Waldrip II, Aleese Simmons, Andre Mortion, Khaleef Chiles, James Banks and Henderson Thigpen and produced by Bradley & Stereo for Milian's second album, It's About Time (2004), featuring a rap verse by rapper Joe Budden. The song was released as the album's second and final single, following the success of \"Dip It Low.\" In contrast to its predecessor, however, the single saw moderate success, peaking at number 100 on the Billboard Hot 100. Outside of the United States, \"Whatever U Want\" achieved a similar lack of success in most countries with the exception of Belgium (Wallonia) and the United Kingdom, with the song peaking within the top ten of the charts in both countries. In the latter market, the song also topped the country's R&B; Singles Chart. ==Formats and track listings== UK CD1 # \"Whatever U Want\" (Original Version) # \"Whatever U Want\" (Jack D.
