Among his international awards there are FIPRESCI Director of the Year at San Sebasti\u00e1n International Film Festival and Golden Camera at Cannes Film Festival in 2003. He is also co-founder and director of the film production company AlphaVille Pictures Copenhagen. == Early life and education == Boe was born in Rungsted just north of Copenhagen, Denmark. After school in Denmark, he went to study the history of cinematography in Indiana University in Bloomington, United States. Then, he continued his studies in Copenhagen University. In 1997 he decided to go deep into movie making and was accepted at the National Film School of Denmark director's course. During that time he directed a trilogy of short films: Obsession (1999), Virginity (2000) and Anxiety (2001). They were 20 to 30 minutes long and starred Maria Bonnevie and Nikolaj Lie Kaas. They're all basically about a young male being obsessed by a beautiful woman and then being trapped in his own logic of what love is.Christopher Boe on Love and Personal Identity in \"Reconstruction\" \"Anxiety\" received the Prix Decouverte de la Critique Francais and was screened in Critic\u2019s Week in 2002. At that point Boe developed a style of movie making and playing with narrative structure. He graduated from the National Film School of Denmark in 2001. == Career == After the graduation he is the head of so- called \"Hr. Boe & Co.\" team. In spite of the fact that their debut was even during studying (Anxiety in 2001), their first feature film Reconstruction released in 2003 has become their first actual collaborative work. He was so satisfied with Maria Bonnevie and Nikolaj Lie Kaas playing in his students shorts \u2013 so he wrote Reconstruction specifically with them in mind. This real debut was well received by critics on international film festivals. In 2001 he made 6 episodes (each 10 minutes) of TV series Kissmeyer Basics. In 2004 he shot a short film Europe Does Not Exist as part of Visions of Europe with Cecilie Thomsen and Henning Moritzen representing Demark in this Europe Union media project. His fourth feature film \u2013 thriller Everything will be Fine was selected for Quinzaine des R\u00e9alisateurs (Directors' Fortnight), marking the third Danish film to be selected for 2010 Cannes International Film Festival.Everything Will Be Fine To Canne, DFI, by Vicki Synnott == Hr.
