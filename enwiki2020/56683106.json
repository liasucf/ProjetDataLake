Edmundo Pedro (November 8, 1918 \u2013 January 27, 2018) was a Portuguese politician and antifascist, as well as the founder and former leader of the Socialist Party (PS). An opponent of Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar's Estado Novo regime and political prisoner during the 1930s and 1940s, Pedro later served as a member of the Assembly of the Republic's I, III and V legislatures (1976\u20131980, 1983\u20131985, 1987\u20131991) following the end of Salazar's regime. ==Biography== Pedro was born in the freguesia of Samouco in the municipality of Alcochete, Portugal, on November 8, 1918. In 1934, Pedro, who was 15-years old, was arrested for the first time for participating in a general strike. He joined the Portuguese Communist Party (PCP) later in the 1930s, where he met the party's leader, \u00c1lvaro Cunhal. In 1936, Edmundo Pedro was arrested again and sent to the Tarrafal prison camp in Cape Verde alongside his father, Gabriel Pedro, another opponent of the Salazar government. In 1945, while still in prison, Pedro broke with the PCP and left the party. He was released from Tarrafal in 1946 and returned to mainland Portugal. In 1973, Edmundo Pedro became one of the co-founders of the Socialist Party (PS) alongside M\u00e1rio Soares. Following the Carnation Revolution, Pedro became an elected deputy in the national Assembly of the Republic. He simultaneously served as the president of R\u00e1dio e Televis\u00e3o de Portugal (RTP), the national public service broadcaster, from 1977 until 1978. In January 2018, Pedro was hospitalized for approximately two weeks. He died in Lisbon, Portugal, on January 27, 2018, at the age of 99. ==References== Category:1918 births Category:2018 deaths Category:Members of the Assembly of the Republic (Portugal) Category:Portuguese prisoners and detainees Category:Socialist Party (Portugal) politicians Category:Portuguese socialists Category:Portuguese Communist Party politicians ",
