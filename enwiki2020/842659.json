    "text": "The Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) is an intelligence agency in the United States Department of State whose primary mission is to provide all- source intelligence and analysis for U.S. diplomats. It is the oldest civilian intelligence agency in the U.S. Intelligence Community, as well as one of the smallest, with roughly 300 personnel. The INR originated from the Research and Analysis Branch (R&A; Branch) of the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), which was established during World War II to identify the strengths and weaknesses of the Axis powers. The R&A; Branch proved pivotal to the war effort, and was so well regarded that, upon the dissolution of the OSS in 1945, it was one of the few components retained and transferred to the State Department. In addition to supporting the policies and initiatives of the State Department, the INR contributes to the President's Daily Briefings (PDB), ensures U.S. intelligence operations meet the nation's foreign policy interests, and serves as the federal government's primary source of foreign public opinion research and analysis. It reviews and publishes close to two million reports and produces about 3,500 intelligence assessments annually. The Bureau is strictly analytical and does not engage in counterintelligence or espionage. The INR has no independent intelligence collection capability of its own, instead utilizing Foreign Service reports to produce analyses for State Department officials. The INR is headed by the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research, currently Ellen E. McCarthy, who reports directly to the secretary of state and serves as the secretary's primary intelligence advisor. Ellen E. McCarthy was nominated to this position on 12 June 2018. ==History== The United States Intelligence Board in 1965. Seated second from right is Thomas L. Hughes, then INR Director. In July 2004, the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence issued a scathing report on prewar intelligence on Iraq. INR was spared the poor performance review that most other intelligence agencies received, and the panel specifically endorsed the dissent that INR inserted into the National Intelligence Estimate of 2002. The bureau is being studied as a positive example, as Congress debates how to best reform U.S. intelligence agencies in the wake of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.The Reach of War: Intelligence; Tiny Agency\u2019s Iraq Analysis is better than Big Rivals\u2019. The New York Times. Retrieved on 2015-04-07. In May 2004, the National Security Archive released a highly classified review of INR's written analysis of the Vietnam War during the 1960s commissioned in 1969 by Thomas L. Hughes, then Director of INR. The review showed that INR had repeatedly warned of the weaknesses of the South Vietnamese Government and of the failing US strategy in Vietnam, and that, despite pressure from the military and Pentagon, INR had portrayed and projected the course of the war more accurately than any other source. In June 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) arrested former INR employee Walter Kendall Myers on charges of serving as an illegal agent of the Cuban government for nearly 30 years and conspiring to provide classified U.S. information to the Cuban government. Myers\u2019 arrest was the culmination of a three-year joint FBI/Department of State Diplomatic Security investigation. Myers worked in the INR from 2000 until October 2007.Arrest of Walter Kendall Myers . State.gov. Retrieved on 2013-08-16. On October 23, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Philip S. Goldberg to be the Assistant Secretary of State for Intelligence and Research; his nomination was confirmed by the Senate on February 9, 2010. ==Mission== The primary mission of the INR is to provide all-source intelligence to support U.S. diplomats. This is achieved through all-source analysis, intelligence policy and coordination, polling and media analysis, and conferences and workshops to integrate outside expertise. As the nexus of intelligence and foreign policy, it plays a key role in ensuring that intelligence activities are consistent with U.S. foreign policy, and that other components of the Intelligence Community (IC) understand the information and analysis needs of senior foreign policy decision makers. INR's portfolio is as broad and diverse as the secretary's global agenda. As a result, INR employs experts who understand current policy concerns as well as the historical context to provide input to policymakers and timely guidance to the IC. Officially, INR intelligence is aimed at ensuring that diplomats, policymakers, and other government officials have access to focused intelligence products that will help advance U.S. foreign policy, namely to build democracies, promote economic stability, provide humanitarian assistance, and combat terrorism, disease, and the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) around the world. INR is the department's principal liaison with the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI). Since the creation of the ODNI, there have been many changes in the IC, including more attention to customer needs, new standards for information sharing, and initiatives regarding analytic standards. INR participates in a wide variety of working groups and committees on behalf of the Department of State, and INR analysts participate in the drafting of IC assessments and analyses. ==Priorities== * Expanding electronic dissemination of intelligence so that Department policymakers can access intelligence quickly and securely from the desktop; * Creating and maintaining an expert workforce through recruitment, training, and professional development in support of the national security mission; * Tracking and analyzing issues that may undermine efforts to promote peace and security such as terrorism, the spread of WMD, and trafficking in humans and illicit drugs; * Playing a key role in the IC to optimize intelligence collection and requirements so that current and future diplomatic information needs are met, resulting in enhanced intelligence support for policymakers; * Increasing collaboration and information sharing on humanitarian issues through the interagency Humanitarian Information Unit; * Serving as a leader in the USG for foreign public opinion surveys and polls that will help inform the USG\u2019s public diplomacy initiatives; and * Providing all-source analyses and assessments that examine trends in governance, democracy, and human rights and assess domestic policies and leadership performance in countries of interest. ==Structure== Structure of the Bureau of Intelligence and Research as of 2008. ===Assistant Secretary for Intelligence and Research (INR)=== The assistant secretary for intelligence and research provides intelligence support for the secretary of state, other department principals and policy bureaus and directs the department's program of research and analysis.
