By the standards of the various now-defunct trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom, the Hastings system was a moderately sized one, with a total of 10 routes, and a maximum fleet of 58 trolleybuses. However, by May 1929 Hastings had 21 miles of trolleybus routes, then the longest in the world. It was closed relatively early, on . Maidstone & District Motor Services bought the Tramway Co. in November 1935, but didn't merge it until 1957. The livery changed from brown to green after the takeover, but the 'Hastings Tramways' logo remained until 1957. The power source also changed in 1936, when the tramway power station at Ore was replaced by municipal power. Four of the former Hastings trolleybuses are now preserved. One is at the Trolleybus Museum at Sandtoft, Lincolnshire, and another at East Anglia Transport Museum, Carlton Colville, Suffolk. The remaining two, one of which was fitted with a diesel engine in 1959\u201360, are owned by the Hastings Trolleybus Restoration Group, Bexhill-on-Sea, East Sussex. The earliest is 1929 open top No.3, which was stored in 1938, but restored in 1952 to run summer open top services. ==See also== *Transport in Hastings *List of trolleybus systems in the United Kingdom ===Notes=== ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * ==External links== *Hastings Trolleybus Restoration Group *SCT'61 website - photos and descriptions of Hastings and District trolleybuses *Historical Hastings Wiki - Trolleybuses *National Trolleybus Archive *British Trolleybus Society, based in Reading *National Trolleybus Association, based in London Category:Transport in Hastings Hastings Hastings Category:History of East Sussex Category:1928 establishments in England Category:1959 disestablishments in England ",
