    "text": "\"Love Scenes\" is a song by British female singer Beverley Craven, the title track of her second album. ==Details== After taking a 2-year break from music after giving birth to her first daughter, Craven returned to the music scene in September 1993. Love Scenes was released as the first single of her second album. The song's structure resembles that of a waltz. Lyrically, Craven took inspiration from an actor she was infatuated with, and talk about an obsessive relationship where the narrator is jealous of the \"other woman\" who's \"got her role\". The song peaked at #34 in the UK and spent 4 weeks on the charts, becoming Craven's last UK top 40 hit to date. ==Video== The video features Craven in a theatre watching a play in a box seat. In the scenario there is an actor and an actress, and, referring to the song's lyrics, Craven is seen watching the play with jealousy. At one point, we see Craven fantasizing a reenactment of various iconic movie scenes with the actor in the play. The video ends with Craven leaving the theatre, walking past the actor and the actress outside, who are signing autographs. The video was filmed in September 1993 at Hackney Empire theatre in London. Actress Tara FitzGerald, a friend of Craven's, plays the part of the actress in the play. ==Track listings== ; CD Single # \"Love Scenes\" 3:53 # \"Blind Faith\" 4:09 # \"Joey\" (Live) 4:02 # \"Look No Further\" (Live) 5:58 ; 7\" Single, Cassingle # \"Love Scenes\" 3:53 # \"Blind Faith\" 4:09 == Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !Chart (1993) !Peak position |- |UK Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|34 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1993 singles Category:1990s ballads Category:Beverley Craven songs Category:Song recordings produced by Paul Samwell-Smith Category:1993 songs Category:Epic Records singles ",
