A marked trail leads through the summit. The Polish name \u015awinica (derivative form of a pig or swine) was given to this summit in the mid 19th century. It probably refers to the resemblance of the peak to silhouette of a swine. Another, doubtful explanation, is that the summit was difficult to reach.
