In 1513 he became head of the O'Neills, holding the position until 1519 when he was succeeded by his half-brother.Ellis p.379 Art Oge was the son of Conn Mor O'Neill and his first wife who was from the O'Cahan family.Casway p.273 Conn More was the ruler of T\u00edr Eoghain, an area considerably larger than the modern County Tyrone in Ulster. Art Oge's election in 1513 relied on the support of the powerful Anglo-Irish lord Gerald FitzGerald, 8th Earl of Kildare, whose sister had become his father's second wife. The crucial backing from Kildare was a sign of the growing influence of the Crown in Gaelic Irish society.Ellis p.103 Art Oge's successor, his brother Conn, later made this position a more formal one when he took the title of Earl of Tyrone as part of Surrender and regrant policy. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Ellis, Steven G.
