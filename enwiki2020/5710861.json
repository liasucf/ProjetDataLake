    "text": "Given an exterior differential system defined on a manifold M, the Cartan- Kuranishi prolongation theorem says that after a finite number of prolongations the system is either in involution (admits at least one 'large' integral manifold), or is impossible. ==History== The theorem is named after \u00c9lie Cartan and Masatake Kuranishi. ==Applications== This theorem is used in infinite-dimensional Lie theory. ==See also== *Cartan-K\u00e4hler theorem ==References== * M.
