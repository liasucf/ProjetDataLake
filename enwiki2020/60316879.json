    "text": "Geisenbrunn station is a railway station in the municipality of Geisenbrunn, located in the Starnberg district in Upper Bavaria, Germany. ==History== The station is located to the north of the Gilching district of Geisenbrunn. The unoccupied Haltepunkt initially only had a bulk platform and a milk loading ramp on the track. In 1910, the Bayerische Staatseisenbahnen (Bavarian State Railways) set up a rail siding secured by a covering agency to form a clay works, which was dismantled before 1938. Due to the increasing number of passengers, the municipality of Argelsried erected a single-storey wooden hipped roof building around 1920 with a service room and a waiting room in which a railway agent was stationed to sell tickets. In 1962, Deutsche Bundesbahn stopped selling tickets again and the station was no longer occupied. With the double-track extension of the line, Deutsche Bundesbahn put two new side platforms into operation at Geisenbrunn in 1986. ==References== ==External links== Category:Munich S-Bahn stations Category:Railway stations in Bavaria Category:Buildings and structures in Starnberg (district) ",
