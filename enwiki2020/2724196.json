However, in 1876, the GNR built Eastwood and Langley Mill on its branch from the Derbyshire and Staffordshire Extension at Awsworth Junction. The Midland station then became Langley Mill and Eastwood. In 1895, the Midland built a line from here through Heanor to Ripley with an adjacent station of its own. This was not profitable and closed in May 1926. It was closed to passenger traffic on 2 January 1967 as a result of the Beeching Axe (along with , and all the other remaining local stations on the same route),Stations of the Erewash Westhouses Depot website, Retrieved 1 August 2017 but was subsequently reopened by British Rail in May 1986.\"The railway station that refused to die\" Holmes, Godfrey The Independent article 1 April 2017; Retrieved 1 August 2017 The former station (which was demolished after closure) had platforms opposite each other and was located on the site of the present platform 2.
