The house features a centered portico with a gabled barrel vault and Tuscan columns with pilasters at the front exposure. Bisected attic lunettes decorate lateral gables. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. With ==History== In 1923 Hazel Cleveland married Blaine Burnett, who with his father, Fred Burnett, owned the Burnett Shoe Company. Mrs. Burnett, also known as H.C. Burnett, contracted with Tourtellotte & Hummel to build the 6-room Burnett House in 1924. A garage was erected in 1929. The Burnetts occupied the house from its construction until 1933, when they moved to Seattle. Roy J. McCaslin later owned the Burnett House for several years. In 2019 as part of preparation for expansion of St. Luke's Boise Medical Center, the Burnett House was moved from 124 Bannock Street to a pasture on Warm Springs Avenue, a site occupied by other historic homes. ==See also== * William Dunbar House ==References== ==External links== Category:National Register of Historic Places in Boise, Idaho Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Idaho Category:Houses in Boise, Idaho Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1924 Category:Tourtellotte & Hummel buildings ",
