In 2018, Bridgend Council launched a two-year conservation plan for the dunes, stating that sand dunes were \"one of the habitats most at risk in Europe\". The project was expected to cost more than \u00a3300,000. The largest dune at the site is known as The Big Dipper, which is the biggest of its kind in Wales. The dune is the second-largest in Europe, measuring around , smaller only than the Dune of Pilat in Western France. The ruins of Candleston Castle are located on the edge of the dunes. ==In popular culture== The dunes at Merthyr Mawr were used during the filming of Lawrence of Arabia, a film based on the life of T. E. Lawrence. The site doubled for the deserts on the Arabian Peninsula. ==See also== * List of Sites of Special Scientific Interest in Mid & South Glamorgan ==References== Category:Coast of the Vale of Glamorgan Category:Dunes of Wales Category:Landforms of the Vale of Glamorgan Category:Sandboarding locations Category:Sites of Special Scientific Interest in the Vale of Glamorgan ",
