    "text": "Hardberger Park is a public city park of San Antonio, Texas which opened in May 2010. == History== The property in which the park was located was owned by Minnie and Max Voelcker who operated a dairy farm on the property. The property also included a stone house, which is still preserved within the park. The property was purchased by the city in 2007 and is considered the signature project among the 69 park projects included in the 2007-2012 Bond Program. The person it is named after, Phil Hardberger, championed this bond program as San Antonio mayor from 2005 to 2009. The San Antonio City Council voted December 3, 2009, to name the Voelcker property which was under development as a City park, Phil Hardberger Park, in honor of former Mayor Hardberger's contributions to the project. ==Recreation and Features== Features include numerous trails, two playscapes on either side of the park, dog parks on both sides of the park, picnic facilities, basketball courts, an outdoor classroom, and the Salado Creek overlook. == Etiquette == Park rules prohibit the use of alcohol, loud music, motorized vehicles off the pavement, and glass containers while in the park limits. == See also == * Phil Hardberger - The park's namesake * Brackenridge Park * San Antonio Japanese Tea Garden * Travis Park * Dwight D.
