    "text": "Lawrence McCully Judd (March 20, 1887 - October 4, 1968) was a politician of the Territory of Hawaii, serving as the seventh Territorial Governor. He was devoted to the Hansen's Disease-afflicted residents of Kalaupapa on the island of Molokai. ==Life== Judd was born March 20, 1887, in Honolulu, Hawaii, the grandson of Gerrit P. Judd, who was an early American Missionary, a cabinet minister to King Kamehameha III, and co-founder of Punahou School. His father was Judge Albert Francis Judd (1838\u20131900) and mother was Agnes Hall Boyd (1844\u20131934). He was the last of nine children. He was married March 6, 1909, at Richmond Hill, New York, to Florence Bell Hackett (1885\u20131974) and had five children: Helen Florence (1909-?), Agnes Elizabeth (1912-?), Sophie Janet (1913\u2013?), Lawrence McCully Jr. (1917\u2013?) and Emilie Bell (1920\u2013?). Judd married his second wife, Eva Marie Lillibridge (1913\u20132002) in 1938. Judd attended the Punahou School, The Hotchkiss School, and the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of its fraternity chapter of Phi Kappa Psi. ==Career== Judd made several fact-finding tours during his tenure in the Hawaii Territorial Senate 1920\u20131927. ===Governor of HawaiI=== Herbert Hoover appointed Judd to succeed Wallace Rider Farrington as Governor of Hawaii Territory from 1929 to 1934. As territorial governor, he overhauled the system of governance in the colony. A source of controversy during his tenure, Judd commuted the sentence of Grace Hubbard Fortescue, socialite and niece of Alexander Graham Bell, convicted in the territorial courts of manslaughter in the death of a local man, Joseph Kahahawai. Hiring defense lawyer Clarence Darrow, Fortescue's case was known as the Massie Affair, a focus of nationwide newspaper coverage. Massie's sentence of ten years in prison was whittled down to one hour in the governor's chambers at Iolani Palace. The affair was the subject of a 2005 episode of the PBS series The American Experience, with some archival footage of Judd. ===Resident superintendent=== Judd became Kalaupapa's resident superintendent in 1947. Judd's service running Kalaupapa was a subject in the 2003 historical novel and national bestseller called Moloka'i by Alan Brennert as well as the historical account, The Colony: The Harrowing True Story of the Exiles of Molokai by John Tayman. ===Samoa and retirement=== On 4 March 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed Judd Governor of American Samoa on a temporary basis. He served only five months. Judd died on October 4, 1968, in Honolulu and was interred in the city's Oahu Cemetery in Nuuanu Valley. ==References== ==External links== * Descendants of Thomas Hastings website Category:1887 births Category:1968 deaths Category:Members of the Hawaii Territorial Legislature Category:Governors of American Samoa Category:Governors of the Territory of Hawaii Category:Punahou School alumni Category:Hotchkiss School alumni Category:University of Pennsylvania alumni Category:Hawaii Republicans Category:American Samoa Republicans Category:20th-century American politicians Category:Burials at Oahu Cemetery Category:Judd family ",
