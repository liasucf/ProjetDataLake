It aired on Fox in the United States on May 17, 2015. ==Plot== While shopping at the farmer's market, Bob and Louise spot Kojima, a Japanese actor who was once the star of a father- daughter samurai series called Hawk & Chick starring himself and his real life daughter. Bob invites him back to the restaurant and plays one of his old movies and is surprised to see Kojima tearing up. Kojima reveals that he was in town to see his daughter, Yuki, who lives there now and whom he has not spoken to for 30 years. Louise decides that in order to reunite Kojima and his daughter the Belchers need to throw a Hawk & Chick film festival and invite both Kojima and Yuki. Bob and Louise go to the local theatre and are turned down by management who refuses to loan out the theatre on such short notice. However they are approached by Dominic, a theatre employee who tells them he will allow them to use the theatre after hours. After securing the theatre, Bob and Louise go to see Yuki who now works as an accountant. Yuki is reluctant to go to the festival and Bob empathizes with her difficult working relationship with her father. However Louise is distressed by Yuki's indifference to her father and decides to con her into going to the festival, inviting her as a guest without telling her her father will be there. The festival runs into problems when Dominic can only locate one Hawk & Chick movie in the original Japanese. The family decides to dub the movie over themselves, with Bob playing Hawk and Louise playing Chick. At the actual festival however the dubbing goes awry causing Bob and Louise to have to redub the movie live behind a curtain. Yuki, already reluctant to take part in the festival, decides to leave. Spotting her departure Bob changes the dialogue in the movie to draw Yuki's attention and let her know that her father loves her. Meanwhile, Louise gets upset and acting as Chick insists that she should be apologizing to Hawk. Bob realizes that Louise's desire to reunite Kojima and Yuki came from a fear that she and Bob could have a rift between them when Louise got older. He promises her that they will always talk to one another. Meanwhile, Kojima reveals himself to Yuki and the two happily reunite. ==Reception== Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V.
