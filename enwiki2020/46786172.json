    "text": "Surkh Dheri is a village in Mardan District, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa), Pakistan. ==Demographics and culture== The population of Surkh Dheri is about 6000 to 7000. The dominant language in this village is the Pashto. Islam is the dominant religion and culture. The people of Surkh Dheri wear Shalwar kameez. ==Problems== Gas and electricity are major problems. The people use gas cylinders for their cooking. My personal comments are that: - 1\\. Gas available but demand notices for connections are so late. 2\\. Electricity also available but with low voltage and illegal connection are the main causes of low voltage and damaging the transformer. I request to all concerned officers and statesmen for solving the main and major problems of inhabitants of Village Surkh Dheri. 3\\. There is no sewerage system which is very easy and feasible for concerned departments/statesmen. 4\\. Sanitation is the main and major demand for better health of the inhabitants of village Surkh Dheri. At last i would like to say that the above demands are shameful for the concerned responsible persons because the village situated in front of the Sheikh Maltoon Phase-V, near the Main Mardan Sports Complex, on the main G.T Road even on the edge of Ring Road. thanks.......
