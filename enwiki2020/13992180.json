    "text": "Chapel Plaister is a hamlet in Wiltshire, England. It lies on the B3109 road between Corsham and Bradford on Avon, about southeast of the village of Box and southwest of the town of Corsham. The settlement takes its name from a small Anglican church which was a roadside refuge for pilgrims travelling to the shrine of Joseph of Arimathea at Glastonbury. Founded circa 1235 and rebuilt in 1340 by Richard Plaisted of Castle Combe, the church was used for non-religious purposes until it was restored in 1893. The building was designated as Grade I listed in 1960. The adjacent Bell House, an inn from the 17th century and now a private house, may have incorporated a hostel connected with the chapel. == References == == External links == * * Category:Hamlets in Wiltshire Category:Church of England church buildings in Wiltshire Category:Grade I listed churches in Wiltshire ",
