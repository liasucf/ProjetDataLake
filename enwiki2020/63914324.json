The series will conclude on 11 June 2020. Brassic follows the lives of Vinnie (Gilgun) and his five friends who live in the fictional northern English town of Hawley. The working class group commit various crimes in order to survive, but as they get older, some of them begin to wonder whether they wouldn't be better off away from town. The second series follows up from the previous series, in which Vinnie faked his own death in order to avoid torture from \"businessman\" Terence McCann (Ramon Tikaram). ==Cast== * Joe Gilgun as Vinnie O'Neill * Michelle Keegan as Erin Croft * Damien Molony as Dylan * Tom Hanson as Cardi * Aaron Heffernan as Ash Dennings * Ryan Sampson as Tommo * Parth Thakerar as JJ * Steve Evets as Jim * Claude Scott-Mitchell as Sara * Dominic West as Dr. Chris Cox * Bronagh Gallagher as Carol * Joanna Higson as Sugar ==Episodes== ==Marketing== On 24 April 2020, Sky One released the second series' trailer, briefly showing the events that would occur and announcing its release date of 7 May. ==Release== ===Broadcast=== The series began broadcasting on 7 May 2020.
