    "text": "The sixth-generation Chevrolet Camaro is an American pony car. Produced by automobile manufacturer Chevrolet, it was first introduced to the public on May 16, 2015. Sales started in 2015 for the 2016 model year. The Camaro now utilizes the GM Alpha platform shared with the Cadillac ATS and CTS and features MacPherson struts in front, rather than the former multi-link setup. General Motors claims that 70 percent of architectural components in the new Camaro are unique to the car. The sixth generation of Camaro saw production return to the United States as the fourth and fifth-generation models had been assembled in Canada. Like its predecessor, the sixth generation of the Camaro is available in coup\u00e9 and convertible bodystyles. Compared to the previous generation, it is shorter, less wide and shorter in height. With similar equipment and engine, it is also more than lighter. == Trim levels and special editions == Trim levels introduced at launch were LT (1LT, 2LT) and SS (1SS, 2SS). Standard equipment on all trims includes automatic air conditioning, cruise control, tilt/telescoping steering wheel, satellite radio, parking assist, and seven airbags. Chevrolet added a base LS (1LS) trim level for the 2017 Camaro. Trim level content for the LS is identical to that of the base 1LT trim, with the exception that the 2.0 L turbocharged inline-4 engine and 6-speed manual transmission would be the only available powertrain options for the LS trim. The LS trim was initially introduced in coup\u00e9 form, followed later by an LS convertible. The 1LT trim received the 8-speed automatic transmission with shift paddles as standard equipment for 2017. For China, the car was introduced on August 31, 2016 and sold under the RS trim with the 2 L turbocharged LTG four-cylinder engine and 8-speed automatic gearbox available for 2017 models onwards as standard. Exterior color choices for Chinese models are: Bright Yellow, Titanium Gray, White, Zhan Red, Platinum Silver, Yao Black, Electric Blue, Magic Black, Blush Red, and Ice Blue. For the 2017 model year, the 1LE Performance Packages returned, tailored for the V6 and V8 powered six-speed manual-equipped coup\u00e9 models respectively. Both of 1LE packages offered share a satin black hood wrap, front splitter, and a three- piece rear spoiler. The V6 1LE package adds FE3 suspension from the Camaro SS, 20-inch forged wheels with Goodyear Eagle F1 245/40R20 front tires and 275/35R20 rear tires, Brembo 4-piston front brake calipers, mechanical limited-slip differential with a 3.27:1 ratio, track-cooling package, suede steering wheel, short-throw shifter, dual-mode exhaust, Camaro SS fuel system to accommodate higher-load cornering, and a high flow front grille. The SS 1LE package adds the Magnetic Ride Control FE4 suspension derived from the ZL1, electronic limited-slip differential with 3.73:1 ratio, 20-inch forged wheels with Goodyear Supercar 3 285/30R20 front tires and 305/30R20 rear tires, Brembo six-piston front brake calipers with two-piece 14.6-inch rotors, track- cooling package, Recaro front seats with suede and leather upholstery, suede steering wheel and short-throw shifter, dual-mode exhaust, and a color heads- up display. Starting in 2019, the 1LE Package was also available with the four cylinder turbo. It adds similar equipment to the V6 1LE, including the FE3 suspension, Brembo brakes, 20\" forged wheels with 245/40 and 275/35 Eagle F1 tires, track cooling, and mechanical limited slip differential. The visual changes are also the same as the V6 1LE's. Car and Driver testing showed the I4 1LE was only 1.6 seconds slower around VIR than the V6.

All engines were initially available with a 6-speed manual and 8-speed automatic transmissions, except for the ZL1 models which use a 10-speed automatic in addition to a standard 6-speed manual. The 8-speed was replaced by the 10-speed automatic in the 2019 SS and 2020 V6 models. European Union's new Euro 6d-Temp automotive emission regulations have ended the European sale of Camaro on 31 August 2019. The 6.2-litre V8 engine fitted to the export version of Camaro could not be modified further to meet the new emission regulations. == HSV Camaro (Australia) == General Motors Holden's performance division, Holden Special Vehicles has been engaged in the import and conversion of the Camaro to right-hand-drive and Australian Design Rules, since the second half of 2018. Unlike Holden's previous US import (based on Chevrolet Suburban) in the late 1990s, the Chevrolet badge remains on the converted Camaro. HSV imports and converts the European Camaro 2SS and ZL1. HSV has planned a conversion total of a thousand units per year for three years, until the seventh generation of the Camaro is introduced in 2020. The manual gearbox, along with the ZL1 model, were made available in 2019. With GM discontinuing Holden in 2021, Chevrolet plans to continue exporting the Camaro to the Australasia region under a newly proposed formed entity, General Motor Specialty Vehicles (GMSV), which would handle the distribution and conversion of key Chevrolet vehicles after Holden ceases operations. It is also expected to succeed the Holden Commodore in the V8 Supercar series upon Holden\u2019s winding down of its operations.\u201cHolden Axed In Australia as General Motors Gets Out Of Right Hand Drive Globally\u201d from Car Advice (February 17, 2020)\u201cGM Shutting Down Australia\u2019s Holden Brand, Pulling Chevrolet Out of Thailand\u201d from The Detroit Bureau (February 17, 2020)\u201cSecret Plan: Chevrolet Camaro Could Replace Holden Commodore in V8 Supercars\u201d from Car Advice (18 February 2020)\u201cChevrolet Camaro May Be Back On Cards For Australian Supercars Championship\u201d from GM Authority (February 18, 2020) == Redesign == In fall 2018 (for the 2019 model year), the sixth-generation of the Camaro received a mid-cycle redesign, along with the majority of the Chevrolet car lineup (including the Spark, Cruze and Malibu), in which the design was universally panned.
