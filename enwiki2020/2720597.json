    "text": "Franco Costanzo Geymonat (born 5 September 1980) is an Argentine football goalkeeper who last played for Chilean club Universidad Cat\u00f3lica of the Primera Divisi\u00f3n. He has earned the reputation of being an eccentric goalkeeper by often dribbling the ball past the opposition's strikers and by making somewhat unorthodox saves. Early in his career, Costanzo was once considered an excellent prospect; however, due to a few lengthy injuries, he has only recently managed to fulfill his full potential. ==Club career== Costanzo started playing professionally with Buenos Aires giants Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate in 2000 and made his first-team debut in 2001. He had become the first choice goalkeeper by 2002 and was looked upon by many as one of the most talented goalkeepers in South America. However, injury started to plague him and when he returned from the sidelines, Germ\u00e1n Lux had established himself as River Plate's Number 1. His search for first-team action then took him to Spain's La Liga as he transferred to Deportivo Alav\u00e9s in 2005. He was first choice at Alav\u00e9s straight away, but when they were relegated into the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n, he asked the manager, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Salmer\u00f3n, to be put on the transfer list. Swiss side FC Basel acquired his services in July 2006 for \u00a31.4 million after the departure of veteran goalkeeper Pascal Zuberb\u00fchler. His Basel career did not get off to a great start; he made a blunder in his first match against FC St. Gallen on 30 July 2006 in the 3\u20132 away defeat. However, he played excellent in the second half of the 2006\u201307 season and was voted the FCB Player of the Year. He earned much praise during the 2007\u201308 season for his form as Basel became Champions and especially for his part in helping the team earn a valuable UEFA Cup away point against NK Dinamo Zagreb in the hostile atmosphere of the Maksimir Stadium on 8 November 2007. On 17 July 2008, the day before the 2008\u201309 Swiss Super League season kicked off, he was named Basel captain and he signed a new contract until 2011.Basler Zeitung, 17 July 2008 His first game as captain was on 18 July 2008, in a 2\u20131 win over BSC Young Boys at the Stade de Suisse, Wankdorf, in which he was named Man of the Match. On 9 August 2009, Costanzo and teammate Beg Ferati were involved in a scuffle after a 1\u20131 with FC Z\u00fcrich. The pair began arguing on the pitch, and then Ferati shoved Costanzo who responded by pulling Ferati's hair. Other players then pulled them apart before the situation escalated. Costanzo was fined by the club and given a three match ban by the Swiss Football Association. Costanzo played for FC Basel for five years, in which time they won the Swiss Cup three times and the national Championship also three times. He also played twice in the Champions League group-stages in the 2008\u201309 season and the 2010/\u201311 season where FC Basel did a couple of huge sensations like the draw in the Nou Camp in Barcelona where they tied 1\u20131 or in the Stadio Olimpico in Rome where they beat AS Roma 3\u20131. During this period he played 141 league games, including cup and international games he had over 200 club appearances. He played his last match for the team on 25 May 2011 and was substituted out in the 87th minute to a standing ovation. He was replaced by his designated successor Yann Sommer. On 9 June 2011, it was revealed that Costanzo came to an agreement with Greek champions Olympiacos FC for a three- year contract. Six months later, on 26 January 2012, Costanzo's contract was terminated by mutual consent. On 21 May 2012, Costanzo retired from professional football without saying clearly the reason of his decision. On 29 June 2013, Costanzo returned to football signing for Universidad Cat\u00f3lica a one-and-a-half-year contract. ==International career== Costanzo was an Argentine international at Under-20 level, and was part of the Argentina squad that took part at the 1999 FIFA World Youth Championship. At senior level, he made his only main team appearance in Argentina's 4\u20132 2006 World Cup Qualifying win over Uruguay at the River Plate Stadium on 9 October 2004. ==Personal life== Costanzo is married to Carla. The couple have three children. Their two daughters are named Emma and Zoe and their son named Ciro was born on 24 May 2011. All three children were born in Basel. ==Honours== ;River Plate *Primera Division Argentina: Clausura 2002, Clausura 2003, Clausura 2004 ;FC Basel *Swiss Super League: 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310, 2010\u201311 *Swiss Cup: 2006\u201307, 2007\u201308, 2009\u201310 ;Olympiacos *Superleague Greece: 2011\u201312 *Greek Cup: 2011\u201312 ;Universidad Cat\u00f3lica * Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile: Clausura 2015\u201316, Apertura 2016-17 * Supercopa de Chile: 2016 ==References== ==External links== * * Franco Costanzo on YouTube * Franco Costanzo profile on Yahoo Deportes * * Profile at Swiss Football League Website Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:People from R\u00edo Cuarto, C\u00f3rdoba Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Argentina youth international footballers Category:Argentina under-20 international footballers Category:Argentina international footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Deportivo Alav\u00e9s players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico River Plate footballers Category:La Liga players Category:FC Basel players Category:Olympiacos F.C. players Category:Club Deportivo Universidad Cat\u00f3lica footballers Category:Super League Greece players Category:Swiss Super League players Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Switzerland Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Chile Category:Argentine expatriate sportspeople in Spain ",
