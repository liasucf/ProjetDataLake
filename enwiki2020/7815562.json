    "text": "Kaau Crater Boys were a Hawaiian Contemporary musical duo composed of Ernie Cruz, Jr. (vocals, guitar, bass), Troy Fernandez (ukulele, vocals). They recorded and released four popular Hawaiian Contemporary albums along with a \"best of\" compilation: *Tropical Hawaiian Day (1991) *Valley Style (1993) *On Fire (1995) *Making Waves (1996) *The Best of Kaau Crater Boys (1998) Their work garnered them three N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano awards (N\u0101 H\u014dk\u016b Hanohano means \"The Distinguished/Glorious Stars\", Hawaii's version of the Grammy Awards) from the Hawaii Academy of Recording Arts. ==History== The Kaau Crater Boys were formed in the early 1990s by Ernie Cruz Jr. (the son of Ernie Cruz Sr. and brother of Guy and John Cruz who are also local entertainers) and Troy Fernandez. Their first album, \u201cTropical Hawaiian Day,\u201d released in 1991, marked the official beginning of Troy and Ernie\u2019s 7-year partnership as one of the most successful groups in contemporary island music. Cruz played bass, acoustic guitar and handled main vocals for the majority of songs they recorded. Fernandez also played bass, contributed to vocals (mainly as a backing vocalist), but was mostly renowned for his musicianship with the ukulele. The creation of the Kaau Crater Boys also coincided with the resurgence in local Hawaiian customs and tradition, as well as promoting the renaissance of Hawaiian culture, especially among the local youth.http://www.booklineshawaii.com/music/profiles/ka'aucraterboys.html As part of a collective of artists from the Palolo Housing area of Oahu, Hawaii Cruz and Fernandez earned a steady gig at the Elks Lodge which also opened the door for Troy and Ernie to tour Japan for 6 months. A last minute appearance a few years later at Moose McGillycuddy\u2019s Pub became a regular gig - this time as \u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cErnie/Troy\u201d (a play on names after the popular film, \u201cET \u2013 The Extra-Terrestrial\u201d). Ernie Cruz died in September 2016. ==Etymology== The name Kaau Crater Boys refers to Kaau Crater, an extinct volcano above the Palolo Valley of Oahu, near to the Palolo housing community in which Cruz and Fernandez were raised. ==References== ==External links== * Hawaii Magazine (Defective link prior to 1/10) * Honolulu Star Bulletin * 'Ukulele tabs for Ka'au Crater Boys songs * Troy Fernandez Biography * Hawaii musician Ernie Cruz, Jr. dies, Honolulu Star-Advertiser Category:Musical groups from Hawaii Category:Ukulele players Category:Na Hoku Hanohano Award winners ",
