    "text": "Fjelberg Church () is a parish church of the Church of Norway in Kvinnherad Municipality in Vestland county, Norway. It is located on the small island of Fjelberg\u00f8ya. It is one of the two churches for the Fjelberg og Eid parish which is part of the Sunnhordland prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1722 using designs by an unknown architect. The church seats about 160 people. ==History== There has been a church on Fjelberg\u00f8ya since the middle ages. The earliest existing historical records of the church date back to the year 1561, but it was in use before that time. That first church was a stave church In 1618, the church was renovated and it got a new floor, new windows, and a new pulpit. In 1627-1629, the church got a new tower. In 1721, the church was described as \"an old and decrepit stave church where there is great danger to its life, especially when the wind blows hard\" (). Due to its poor condition, the church was torn down in 1722 and replaced by a new timber-framed church, about further to the west of the old church. In 1862, there was discussion of replacing the church, but instead it was decided to simply refurbish the old church. Another renovation was completed in 1939. ==See also== *List of churches in Bj\u00f8rgvin ==References== Category:Kvinnherad Category:Churches in Vestland Category:Wooden churches in Norway Category:18th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1722 Category:14th- century establishments in Norway ",
