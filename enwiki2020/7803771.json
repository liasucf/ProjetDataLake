    "text": "Kaizoku-Ban is a live EP by German heavy metal band Accept. It was recorded in Nagoya, Japan, on 19 September 1985, and released on vinyl the same year. It was later re-released as Live in Japan in 1992. Though this is an official release, the title (\u6d77\u8cca\u7248) translates as \"Pirate Edition\" or \"Bootleg\". The cassette tape version of this release had the unusual feature of having all six songs recorded on both sides. Because of the duration of the six songs, it was feasible to release it this way. All six songs are available as bonus tracks on the 2002 BMG remasters of Balls to the Wall, Metal Heart, and Russian Roulette. ==Track listing== Music and lyrics by Accept and Deaffy. ==Credits== ;Band members *Udo Dirkschneider \u2013 vocals *Wolf Hoffmann \u2013 guitars *J\u00f6rg Fischer \u2013 guitars *Peter Baltes \u2013 bass guitar *Stefan Kaufmann \u2013 drums ;Production *Mikio Takamatsu \u2013 sound engineer *Bobby Cohen \u2013 mixing ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Chart !scope=\"col\"|Peak position |- |- |} ==References== Category:1985 EPs Category:Accept (band) albums Category:Live EPs Category:RCA Records EPs ",
