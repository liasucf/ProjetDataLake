Representing his nation Spain in the men's pole vault at the 2004 Summer Olympics, Gazol cleared a height at 5.60 metres to set his own personal best from the Spanish Championships in Almer\u00eda. Throughout his sporting career, Gazol trained for the track and field club Transbaso Monz\u00f3n Polidux in his native Zaragoza, under his personal coach Hans Ruf. Gazol qualified for the Spanish squad as a lone athlete in the men's pole vault at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. Nearly a week before the Games commenced, Gazol improved his personal best and an Olympic B-standard of 5.60 m to earn a spot on the Spanish team at the national championships in Almer\u00eda. Gazol successfully vaulted 5.30 m on his first attempt, but failed to raise the bar at a targeted height of 5.50 m after three straight misses, leaving him in a twenty-eighth place draw with Czech Republic's \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n Jan\u00e1\u010dek and Australia's Steven Hooker at the end of the qualifying round. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:Spanish male pole vaulters Category:Olympic athletes of Spain Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Sportspeople from Zaragoza ",
