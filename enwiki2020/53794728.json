The film, however, was not received well by some feminist critics. Anna MM Vetticad of Firstpost refused to rate the film, calling it a 'non-film', and was outraged by the fact that this 'nondescript' film managed to get released not only in Kerala, but outside it as well, when far superior films were struggling to find theaters. Sowmya Rajendran of The News Minute wrote that the film does a disservice to rape survivors by suggesting that the rape and murder of the female protagonist in the film is tragic only because she was an orphan, a cancer patient, and blameless in all respects. She also criticized the film's concluding message that men should see women as their responsibility and assume the role of their protectors. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indian films Category:Indian coming-of-age films Category:Films set in universities and colleges Category:2010s Malayalam-language films Category:Films about rape in India Category:Indian thriller drama films ",
