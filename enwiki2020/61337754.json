    "text": "Offenbach Arias and Overtures is a 65-minute studio album of excerpts from operettas by Jacques Offenbach performed by the American mezzo-soprano Frederica von Stade and the Scottish Chamber Orchestra under the direction of Antonio de Almeida. It was released in 1995.Offenbach, Jacques: Arias and Overtures, cond. Antonio de Almeida, RCA Victor Red Seal CD 09026681162, 1995 ==Recording== The album was digitally recorded on 16-18 December 1994 in the City Halls, Glasgow. ==Critical reception== Jacques Offenbach and his only son, Auguste, in 1865 The operetta critic Andrew Lamb reviewed the album in Gramophone in February 1996. Antonio de Almeida's anthology, he wrote, covered \"a good cross-section of familiar and unfamiliar Offenbach\". As well as music from the often staged La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, La grande duchesse de G\u00e9rolstein and La P\u00e9richole, the album included excerpts from scores on the dustier shelves of opera houses' libraries. From La fille du tambour-major, for example, there was a martial number for the eponymous Drum-Major's daughter. From Pomme d'api, there were two mischievous songs for the maid-cum-mistress. And from Madame l'archiduc, there was the very obscure tour de force in which \"the mystified heroine attempts to disentangle the letters 'S. A. D. E.' whispered to her by conspirators, and ends up reciting the entire alphabet\". The album's soloist, Frederica von Stade, \"[moved] with grace and majesty through these numbers written for a range of Offenbach's leading ladies\", but she was more successful in some items than in others. She was outstandingly good in the \"succulent\" waltz-rondeau from La vie parisienne, and in the very well known \"Amours divins!\" from La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. In \"Ah! Que les hommes sont b\u00eates!\" from La P\u00e9richole, however, she \"[failed] to capture all the bite of the Meilhac and Hal\u00e9vy text ... in the way of predecessors such as Suzanne Lafaye\". The album's purely instrumental items were also performed well without quite attaining to perfection. It was good to have an opportunity to hear the overture to \"La romance de la rose\", which \"begins with 'The last rose of summer' and develops into a lively allegretto\". And the overtures to Barbe-bleue and La grande duchesse de G\u00e9rolstein \"[bubbled] along engagingly in their authentic original Parisian form\". But de Almeida had shown that he could elicit even more \"sparkle and excitement\" from Offenbach's jeux d'esprit in an earlier anthology that he had recorded with Philips in 1988. All in all, though, his new collection was a disc of \"considerable charm\".Lamb, Andrew: Gramophone, February 1996, p. 105https://www.gramophone.co.uk/review/offenbach-arias-and-overtures BBC Music Magazine reviewed the album in 1998. \"Von Stade has a special feeling for French music,\" their critic wrote, \"especially operetta, to which her light and graceful mezzo brings just the right touch of chic.\"BBC Music Magazine, Vol. 6, 1998, p. 10 David Shengold reviewed the album in Opera News in 2016. \"The all-Offenbach collection\", he wrote, \"...featuring de Almeida in strong, stylish support, shows anew von Stade's mastery of Gallic texts, here in an ever-shifting emotional range. All-Offenbach programmes can trap lesser artists: this collection is recommendable as an introduction to the composer.\"https://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2016/12/Recordings/Frederica_von_Stade__The_Complete_Columbia_Recital_Albums.html ==CD track listing== Jacques Offenbach (1819-1880) Arias and Overtures La P\u00e9richole (Paris, 1868; libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy) * 1 (2:39) Ouverture * 2 (3:18) La lettre de la P\u00e9richole: \"Oh! mon cher aimant, je te jure\" * 3 (2:55) \"Que veulent dires ces col\u00e8res...Ah! que les hommes sont b\u00eates!\" * 4 (2:06) Griserie-ariette: \"Ah! quel d\u00eener je viens de faire\" * 5 (3:07) Entracte La fille du tambour-major (Paris, 1879; libretto by Alfred Duru and Henri Chivot) * 6 (2:41) Chanson de la fille du tambour-major: \"Que m'importe un titre \u00e9clatant\" La belle H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Paris, 1864; libretto by Henri Meilhac and Ludovic Hal\u00e9vy) * 7 (4:13) \"Amours divins!
