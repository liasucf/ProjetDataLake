In addition, individuals with pneumonia who had travelled to Wuhan within 14 days before the onset of symptoms were isolated in hospital. *22 January: Quarantine measures were extended to travellers who arrived from China and displayed symptoms. After three more suspected cases were detected, a multi-ministry taskforce was convened to tackle the issues caused by the pandemic. The MOH advised against non-essential trips to Wuhan and expanded the travel advisory the following day to all of Hubei. MINDEF issued two medical advisories to service personnel. *23 January: Schools have asked parents to declare their travel plans and monitor their children's health. *Between 23 and 26 January: Scoot cancelled flights to Wuhan over the pandemic, after a lockdown was imposed. The suspension was later extended to 29 March. *24 January: ** With the first confirmed case, border control measures were enhanced and extended to land and sea checkpoints with the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority and Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore starting temperature checks from noon of that day. ** Holiday chalets were being prepared as quarantine centres. Some of these chalets had served as quarantine centres in previous outbreaks, such as the 2003 SARS outbreak and 2009 flu pandemic. Measures such as temperature screening and quarantine facilities were put in place at foreign worker dormitories. Transportation companies like ComfortDelGro, SMRT and private hire operators have since taken more precautions against the virus with hand sanitisers, disinfectants and masks provided. Advisories were also distributed. ** On the same day, a Scoot flight was delayed in Hangzhou for six hours after one passenger was sent for further testing, causing passengers and crew to be quarantined. The flight returned with Singaporeans three days later. *25 January: MOH imposed a visitor limit of two per patient in hospitals to slow the spread of the virus. Some hospitals have discouraged children from visiting. *27 January: ** Singaporeans were advised to avoid non-essential travel to China. Temperature screening at Changi Airport was also expanded to all incoming flights from 29 January, with extra scrutiny on flights from China and passengers from Hubei. In addition, people returning from China were asked to fill health and travel declarations and monitor their health with regular temperature checks for two weeks. A 14-day leave of absence (LOA) was imposed on students and teachers as well as workers who work with vulnerable populations, such as pre-schoolers, the elderly and the sick, returning from mainland China. Students were asked to do home-based learning instead. In addition to the chalets, university hostels at National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and Singapore Management University were prepared as quarantine facilities. Other measures include expanded communication channels, cleaning protocols and disinfection of premises after incidents. ** Taxi companies like ComfortDelGro, SMRT, Premier Taxi and Trans-Cab announced a waiver of cab rental fees should any driver get quarantined. ** The government clamped down on false statements and rumours, with the first being a HardwareZone forum receiving a Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) notice on a false claim that one man had died due to the virus. The post is deleted a day before the notice is issued. *28 January: ** Enhanced quarantine measures were announced for those returning from Hubei and those of a higher risk, coming after the detection of seven cases at that point. In addition, travellers from Hubei were denied entry from noon of 29 January. All forms of visas for Hubei travellers were suspended immediately. A $100 allowance per day will be provided to those self-employed under quarantine orders, with home quarantine options available. Hospital bills will be paid by MOH for all suspected and confirmed cases of the virus as the illness is caused by an emerging disease. With the restrictions in place, the Ministry of Manpower started rejecting new applications for workers from Hubei, with existing applications unaffected. In a joint media statement by the Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), National Service (NS) pre-enlistees who had travelled to China and been due for enlistment were given a mandatory leave of absence of up to 14 days. **Facebook is issued a correction notice over a post falsely claiming the closure of Woodlands station due to the virus. *29 January: **Singapore Airlines announced a suspension of layovers from 30 January for cabin crew and pilots to Beijing and Shanghai, in a move to protect the safety of all crew.

They are also advised to make continuity plans in view of the outbreak. It will also work with Singapore Business Federation on a continuity plan guide for companies. **Outward Bound Singapore camps in Pulau Ubin have been designated quarantine facilities. *30 January: ** The Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) has asked Deen Express to explain their mask prices, and ask Lazada, Carousell and Qoo10 to reveal profiteers of masks. ** Public transport operators SBS Transit and SMRT stepped up cleaning efforts, including cleaning surfaces of commonly touched areas, as well as disinfecting vehicles. *31 January: ** The Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI) no longer exempts social media platforms, search engines and Internet intermediaries from complying with the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) due to the coronavirus, with these platforms required to comply with general correction directions issued. The exemptions initially applied when the law took effect in October 2019. ** Singapore Airlines and SilkAir will reduce flights to China for the month of February, with Scoot reducing flights to eight cities in China and suspending flights to 11 other cities, later announcing a suspension of all China flights from 8 February due to the worsening situation there. ** Two correction notices are issued to AB-TC City News and States Times Review, for falsely claiming that five Singaporeans had been infected without visiting China and that Singapore was running out of masks, respectively. ** All new visitors with recent travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days were denied entry from 1 February at 11.59pm. Holders of China passports may be allowed entry into Singapore if they prove that they did not visit China recently, with checks on passports too. All forms of visas for China travellers were suspended immediately. Those returning from China will be put on a 14-day leave of absence.

These masks are meant to be used by the ill in their visit to clinics. The distribution came after a scramble for surgical and N95 masks, hand sanitisers, and thermometers, which led to shortages and price gouging. *4 February: Individuals who had recent close contact with people with travel history to mainland China were contacted in tracing as well. In cases where detection of infected patients happened cross border, authorities would begin epidemiological investigations and identify individuals who had close contact of the case patient upon receiving notification, as seen in the case of a Malaysian who tested positive in Malaysia and likely to have acquired the virus after a meeting with colleagues from China, including one from Wuhan, in Singapore. *7 February: Authorities raised the nation's Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) level from Yellow to Orange after more cases with unclear origins surfaced. *8 February: Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister of Singapore, expressed his worry about some cases with no known chain of transmission of the infection directly from Wuhan or indirectly via cases traced in Singapore. He suggested that it might become \"futile to try to trace every contact\". *9 February: All Work Pass holders with travel history to mainland China within the last 14 days were required to obtain Ministry of Manpower's prior approval before attempting to enter Singapore. *14 February: ** The Ministry of Health reactivated Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and advised doctors to give five days of medical leave for patients with respiratory symptoms. **Grab started GrabCare for healthcare workers. This comes after reports of discrimination due to COVID-19, making it difficult for healthcare workers to get rides. *17 February: Stay-Home Notices were announced for all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from China, taking effect from 18 February. They were not allowed to leave home within 14 days of arrival, with penalties for breaches. *23 February: MOH expanded its health advisory to Daegu and Cheongdo in South Korea after the number of cases there spiked quickly. The definition of suspect cases was also expanded to include travellers arriving from these two cities. *25 February: Singapore announced a ban on visitors arriving from Cheongdo and Daegu in South Korea from 26 February, following a large increase in the number of confirmed cases there. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and long-term pass holders returning from Cheongdo and Daegu within the last 14 days were issued a Stay-Home Notice (SHN) lasting 14 days. *26 February: ICA announced that a Chinese national with permanent residence in Singapore who breached his Stay-Home Notice, had his PR status revoked and had also been barred from re-entry into Singapore. *28 February: Singapore biotech company Veredus launched a COVID-19 test kit for in-vitro diagnosis.
