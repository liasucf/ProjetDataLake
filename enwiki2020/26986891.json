He was educated at Annan Academy (along with fellow artist William Ewart Lockhart). He initially made his living as a house painter before becoming an artist. Payne moved to Derby in 1869 and was recorded as living at several places in the county of Derbyshire in the 1880s including Duffield and Barrow upon Trent. Payne was a student of George Turner \"Derbyshire's John Constable\") who also lived in Barrow upon Trent.
