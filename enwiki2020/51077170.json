He currently competes in various dirt racing events. ==Racing career== Heffner's interest in racing started at the age of five, when he and his parents attended races at Lebanon Valley Speedway. In his teen years, he raced three-wheelers and eventually started racing in Lebanon Valley's Sportsman's Division, winning the championship in 1990. He moved up to the Big Block Modified division, winning his first race in the division in 1994. In 1997, he acquired sponsorship from A. Colarusso & Son, Inc., a highway construction firm. Heffner and Colarusso have developed a longterm relationship. Heffner joined the company in 2003, becoming the Vice President of Operations, a role he still holds today. In 2007, Heffner made his debut in the ARCA Re/Max Series at Daytona International Speedway for DGM Racing, where he finished 35th after crashing. From 2007 to 2011, he ran eight ARCA races, with his last start being at Lucas Oil Raceway. His best finish in the series is 14th at Kentucky Speedway in 2009. In 2013, Heffner entered the Camping World Truck Series' Mudsummer Classic at Eldora Speedway, the first dirt track race in a NASCAR national series since 1970. In the event, Heffner qualified eighth and finished second in his heat race to Ken Schrader, but was relegated to the Last Chance Qualifier (LCQ). Despite starting first, he lost fourth gear and retired from the LCQ, finishing last after completing just one lap and failing to make the Feature. The following year, Heffner made the feature after finishing fourth in his heat, finishing 18th in the final. Heffner also ran the Truck race at New Hampshire Motor Speedway, finishing 23rd after crashing on lap 137. Heffner skipped the 2015 race at Eldora due to the race clashing with his schedule at Lebanon Valley, loaning the truck to Bobby Pierce, who finished second. In 2016, Heffner returned to Eldora, driving the No. 44 for Martins Motorsports. After winning his heat race from the pole to start fourth in the feature, he finished 15th. A year later, Heffner crashed during practice and with no backup, he withdrew from the race. Heffner would return to the Dirt Derby in 2018, securing a ride with Premium Motorsports. He qualified for the main event by finishing fourth in his heat race, and finished 24th in the feature after fading from a top 15 position late with handling problems. ==Motorsports career results== ===NASCAR=== (key) (Bold \u2013 Pole position awarded by qualifying time.
