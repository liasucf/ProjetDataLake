Carter is also credited as a songwriter and contributed vocals. The song caused the #BrownSkinGirlChallenge to go viral upon release. == Composition and lyrics == The song contains \"spare, syncopated African rhythms\", while its lyrics deal with colorism faced by darker-complexioned women: \"Brown skin girl / ya skin just like pearls / Your back against the world\". Billboard magazine called the lyrics \"compelling\", noting how the song shout-outs pioneering brown girls such as Naomi Campbell, Lupita Nyong'o, and Beyonc\u00e9's former Destiny's Child bandmate Kelly Rowland. ==Critical reception== In a positive review, Imani Bashir of Teen Vogue described the song as a \"celebration of dark-skinned women\". Amanda Mitchell at O, The Oprah Magazine complimented the song for being \"unapologetically and fearlessly Black\". Time magazine praised Blue Ivy Carter's appearance, calling it a \"gracious cameo\". Ellise Shafer of Billboard noted that she added a \"sentimental tone to the track\". Alexis Petridis writing for The Guardian pinpointed \"Brown Skin Girl\" as one of the album highlights, describing it as \"brilliant\". Lupita Nyong'o also reacted by posting a video of herself on Friday, July 19, 2019 via Instagram, singing and dancing along to \"Brown Skin Girl\", in which her name was specifically applauded by Beyonc\u00e9. At the 2019 Soul Train Music Awards, \"Brown Skin Girl\" won the Ashford & Simpson Songwriter's Award and was also nominated for Best Collaboration. ==Cover versions== In September 2019, Stormzy covered \"Brown Skin Girl\" for BBC Radio 1's Live Lounge. The song was also covered by Kanye West and Sunday Service Choir in December 2019. In April 2018, Leslie Odom Jr. and Nicolette Robinson performed a cover of \"Brown Skin Girl\" for Global Citizen One World: Together At Home. The performance was nominated for a LiveXLive Lockdown Award for Digital Chemistry: Favorite Duet. ==Music video== === Release and synopsis === A music video for the song, directed by Jenn Nkiru, was included in Black Is King, a visual album and film based on the music of The Lion King: The Gift which premiered on Disney+ on July 31, 2020. On August 24, 2020, a standalone version of the music video was premiered on Good Morning America and subsequently released through Beyonc\u00e9's YouTube channel. It became the second music video from the film available to officially watch outside of Disney+, following \"Already\" which premiered on YouTube and was uploaded to Instagram a few hours prior to Black Is King's release. The video acts a celebration and affirmation of the beauty of dark skin. It depicts a black debutante ball (a tradition in African-American communities in the Southern United States) and showcases a variety of black and brown girls and women, including Mexican-Kenyan actress Lupita Nyong'o, British model Naomi Campbell, American singer Kelly Rowland, South Sudanese- Australian model Adut Akech, Sudanese model Aweng Ade-Chuol, Beyonc\u00e9's mother Tina Knowles-Lawson, and Beyonc\u00e9's daughters Blue Ivy and Rumi Carter. === Development === Beyonc\u00e9 explained the development of the music video, telling Good Morning America, \"It was so important to me in 'Brown Skin Girl' that we represented all different shades of brown... We wanted every character to be shot in a regal light \u2014 Jenn Nkiru came up with the black debutantes. It was important that we are all in this together and we're all celebrating each other.\" The music video was primarily filmed in South London, as it was intended for Black Is King to feature locations from throughout the African diaspora. Nkiru told British Vogue that the video aims to showcase images that are not typically seen on screen, such as a black debutante ball which is a rite of passage in African-American culture, and display \"intimacy, sisterhood, [and] celebrations\" between black women. In an interview for Essence, Nkiru explained how as well as featuring the \"incredible star-studded cast\", she also cast \"women who are lesser known but are on the ground really doing work\" and \"who are the activists in their field\". Nkiru picked South Asian model Sheerah Ravindren to be featured in the music video, who said that it was \"such a blessing to be in this beautiful art piece that shows the beauty and power of Blackness\" and adding that Beyonc\u00e9 has \"already done so much MORE for representation and empowerment for South Asians than the South Asian film industries.\" Nkiru also asked Selma Nicholls, founder of casting agency Looks Like Me, to cast children for the video. Nicholls called it \"a dream come true, not just for me, not just for those children that were selected, but for all black children\". Nicholls' own daughter was chosen for the film; Nicholls explained that \"it's made my daughter be part of something where five years from when she wanted to look like Elsa and Anna, is singing along to the song \"Brown Skin Girl\". Beyonc\u00e9's hairstyles in the film were inspired by traditional African styles, according to hairstylist Neal Farinah. This included a braid crown inspired by the Mangbetu people of the Eastern Congo, whose Lipombo skull elongation technique represented royalty and status, and a style known as Orisha Bunmi, which is a Nigerian hairstyle worn for special events. === Critical reception === Zoe Haylock for Vulture declared the \"Brown Skin Girl\" video \"a revolution in six minutes\", praising the \"African influences, intricate, opulent styling, and pure Black-girl joy\". Haylock added that the video should be placed in the Louvre and would rival the Mona Lisa. Jem Aswad of Variety similarly described the video as \"almost more like a series of paintings\" and praised the series of \"beautiful\" costumes. Describing the video as \"stunning\" and \"celebratory\", Glenn Rowley of Billboard wrote that it \"laud[s] and pass[es] down the ideals of Black identity, heritage and beauty to future generations of brown skinned girls.\" Mekishana Pierre for PopSugar described how the video moved her to tears, noting that the \"lush visuals punctuate the song's devotion to melanin-rich beauty\". Sukriti Wahi of Elle Australia praised how the video includes non- black people of color who have experienced colorism, such as Sri Lankan Tamilian model Sheerah Ravindren. Callie Ahlgrim of Insider named \"Brown Skin Girl\" the second best music video of 2020 so far, after Beyonc\u00e9's own \"Already\" which was also featured in Black Is King. Ahlgrim stated that there are \"many details... to fawn over\" in the video and praised the numerous cameos, especially the moments with Kelly Rowland, which she described as \"intimate and intensely heartwarming\". ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 50 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 67 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 6 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 32 |- ! scope=\"row\"| World Digital Song Sales (Billboard) | 1 |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !
