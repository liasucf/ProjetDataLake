    "text": "Prosperous is the second album by Irish folk musician Christy Moore, released in 1972. His first album, Paddy on the Road, was recorded by Dominic Behan in 1969 and has long been out of print. In addition to Moore's guitar and voice, Prosperous featured musicians Andy Irvine (mandolin, mouth organ), Liam \u00d3g O'Flynn (uilleann pipes, tin whistle) and D\u00f3nal Lunny (guitar, bouzouki). These four musicians later gave themselves the name Planxty, making this album something of the first Planxty album in all but name. Other musicians included Kevin Conneff (later of The Chieftains) on bodhr\u00e1n, Clive Collins on fiddle, and Dave Bland on concertina. The album takes its name from the house and town of Prosperous, County Kildare, where it was recorded by producer Bill Leader in the summer of 1971. The house (featured on the front cover of the album) is owned by Dr Andrew Rynne, surgeon and medical practitioner and founder of Clane General Hospital in Co Kildare. The majority of the songs on the album are traditional, with the exception of \"James Connolly\" by established folk singer Patrick Galvin, \"Tribute to Woody\" (about Woody Guthrie) by Bob Dylan (originally titled \"Song to Woody\"), \"The Ludlow Massacre\", by Guthrie, \"A Letter to Syracuse\" by English folksingers Dave Cartwright and Bill Caddick, and \"I Wish I Was in England\", an early composition by Moore, who would go on to establish himself as a significant songwriter of Irish music. The album opens with a medley of the traditional song \"The Raggle Taggle Gipsies\" and the harp tune \"Tabhair dom do L\u00e1mh\", which would be the opening track of Planxty's self-titled album released the following year. == LP track listing == All tracks Traditional; arranged by Christy Moore; except where indicated === Side one === # \"The Raggle Taggle Gipsies\"/\"Tabhair Dom Do L\u00e1mh\" # \"The Dark Eyed Sailor\" # \"I Wish I Was in England\" (Christy Moore) # \"Lock Hospital\" # \"James Connolly\" (Patrick Galvin) # \"The Hackler from Grouse Hall\" === Side two === # \"Tribute to Woody\" (Bob Dylan) # \"The Ludlow Massacre\" (Woody Guthrie) # \"A Letter to Syracuse\" (Dave Cartwright, Bill Caddick) # \"Spancill Hill\" # \"The Cliffs of Dooneen\" # \"Rambling Robin\" == Personnel == * Christy Moore \u2013 vocals, guitar * D\u00f3nal Lunny \u2013 guitar, bouzouki * Andy Irvine \u2013 mandolin, harmonica * Liam O'Flynn \u2013 uilleann pipes, tin whistle * Clive Collins \u2013 fiddle * Dave Bland \u2013 concertina * Kevin Conneff \u2013 bodhr\u00e1n == References == == External links == * Record label catalogue 2010 * Album sleeve notes Category:1972 albums Category:Christy Moore albums Category:Albums produced by Bill Leader ",
