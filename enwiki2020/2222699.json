Released on August 10, 2007, the film received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $258 million worldwide against a $140 million budget. After the commercial success of the first and second films in the franchise, Tucker received a salary of $25 million for his role in the film, as well as 20% of the film's profits. ==Plot== 10 years after the events of Rush Hour 2, Chinese Ambassador Solon Han, with Hong Kong Police Force Chief Inspector Lee as his bodyguard, addresses the importance of fighting the Triads at the World Criminal Court in Los Angeles. There, he starts to announce the whereabouts of Shy Shen, a semi- mythical individual of great importance to the Chinese mob, but an assassin snipes him, causing a panic. Lee corners the shooter, only to learn it is his childhood Japanese foster brother, Kenji. Lee hesitates, inadvertently allowing Kenji to escape just as LAPD Detective James Carter arrives after learning what happened over the police radio. Despite Han surviving the assassination attempt, Lee and Carter promise his daughter Soo Yung to find the person responsible. Upon her insistence, the pair head to the local Kung Fu studio to retrieve an envelope Han left her, but learn from the studio master that the Triads took Soo Yung's belongings. Lee and Carter return to the hospital and intercept a gang of French-speaking assassins before they can kill Han. After defeating them, they interrogate one of them with the help of Sister Agnes, a French-speaking nun. For her protection, they take Soo Yung to the French Embassy and leave her with French ambassador and chairman of the World Criminal Court, Varden Reynard. When Reynard and Soo Yung are nearly killed by a car bomb, Lee and Carter head to Paris to investigate further. After a painful encounter with Parisian Commissaire Revi, Lee and Carter meet anti-American taxi driver, George, and force him to drive them to a Triad hideout. While there, Carter meets stage performer Genevi\u00e8ve while Lee is tricked by mob assassin Jasmine, who claims to have information about Shy Shen, though Carter saves him from being killed. The pair try to escape, but are ultimately captured by Kenji's men. Kenji offers to let them live if they leave Paris, but Lee refuses and following a short struggle, he and Carter successfully escape. The duo recuperate at a hotel, where Lee reveals his relationship with Kenji and decides to continue alone. A disillusioned Carter leaves, but recomposes himself when he spots and follows Genevi\u00e8ve. Meanwhile, Reynard meets Lee and reveals that Shy Shen is not a person, but a list of Triad leaders and that Genevi\u00e8ve is Han's informant with access to the list. After locating Genevi\u00e8ve and saving her from an assassination attempt, the two flee to their hotel. They are attacked by Jasmine, but George rescues them out of a newfound admiration for Americans. Genevi\u00e8ve reveals to Lee and Carter that the Triad leaders' names were tattooed on the back of her head and that she will be beheaded if the Triads capture her. When Lee and Carter bring Genevi\u00e8ve to Reynard, they discover he was working with the Triads the entire time. Kenji calls to inform Lee that he has captured Soo Yung and demands he turn over Genevi\u00e8ve. Lee arrives at the Eiffel Tower to make the exchange, with Carter disguised as Genevi\u00e8ve with a wig. Kenji challenges Lee to a sword fight, during which the two fall into a safety net. After Kenji's sword cuts the net, Lee tries to save him, but Kenji lets go, falling to his death. Meanwhile, Carter saves Soo Yung and defeats Jasmine, who is killed after getting stuck in an elevator wheel. After escaping the remaining Triad members, Carter and Lee are confronted by Reynard, who threatens to kill Genevi\u00e8ve and frame them. However, George shoots Reynard from behind, killing him. As the police arrive, Revi tries to take credit for Lee and Carter's work, but they knock him out and leave with a victory dance. == Cast == * Jackie Chan as Chief Inspector Yan Naing Lee * Chris Tucker as Detective James Carter * Max von Sydow as Varden Reynard * Hiroyuki Sanada as Kenji * Yvan Attal as George * Youki Kudoh as Dragon Lady Jasmine * No\u00e9mie Lenoir as Genevi\u00e8ve / Shy Shen * Zhang Jingchu as Soo-Yung Han * Tzi Ma as Ambassador Solon Han * Roman Polanski as Commissaire Revi * Philip Baker Hall as Captain William Diel * Dana Ivey as Sister Agnes * Henry O as Master Yu * Mia Tyler as Marsha * Sarah Shahi as Zoe * David Niven, Jr. as British Foreign Minister * Sun Mingming as Kung-Fu Giant * Julie Depardieu as Paulette ==Release== The film was not screened in Chinese theaters in 2007, to make way for a larger variety of foreign films for that year, according to a business representative.

It has been reported that the fourth film may be set in Moscow. In May 2011, in an interview with Vulture, Ratner stated that the high cost of making a sequel is, \"why another Rush Hour probably won\u2019t get made, either: It'd be too much to pay me, Chris [Tucker], and Jackie [Chan] to come back.\" In an interview on May 12, 2012, with The Arizona Republic, Jackie Chan revealed that he was still planning on sequels to both Rush Hour and The Karate Kid. ==See also== * Jackie Chan filmography ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2007 films Category:Films shot in Paris Category:Films set in Paris Category:Paris in fiction Category:Films shot in Los Angeles Category:Films set in Los Angeles Category:Films set in 2007 Category:2007 action comedy films Category:2007 martial arts films Category:American action comedy films Category:American buddy cop films Category:American films Category:American martial arts films Category:American sequel films Category:Police detective films Category:Films directed by Brett Ratner Category:French films Category:2000s martial arts comedy films Category:New Line Cinema films Category:Spyglass Entertainment films Category:Triad films Category:Films scored by Lalo Schifrin Category:Films produced by Roger Birnbaum Category:2000s police comedy films Category:2000s buddy cop films Category:Films with screenplays by Jeff Nathanson Category:Rush Hour (franchise) Category:2007 comedy films ",
