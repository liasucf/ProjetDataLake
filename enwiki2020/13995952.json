    "text": "Kamouraska is a 1973 Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois film directed by Claude Jutra, based on the novel by Anne H\u00e9bert, who also worked as screenwriter. It won four Canadian Film Awards, for Best Actress (Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold), Best Supporting Actress (Camille Bernard), Art Direction and a Special Award. ==Synopsis== The film is set in rural Qu\u00e9bec in the 1830s. \u00c9lisabeth is at the deathbed of her second husband J\u00e9r\u00f4me recounting her past, conveyed through a series of flashbacks; her first marriage to Antoine, the brutish Seigneur of Kamouraska, and her ensuing love affair with a loyalist American doctor George Nelson which leads to the brutal murder of Antoine, her trial for complicity and acquittal, her loveless marriage to J\u00e9r\u00f4me to save her honour. ==Cast== *Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold as \u00c9lisabeth d'Aulni\u00e8res *Richard Jordan as Georges Nelson *Philippe L\u00e9otard as Antoine Tassy *Marcel Cuvelier as J\u00e9r\u00f4me Rolland *Huguette Oligny as the mother of \u00c9lisabeth *Camille Bernard as the mother of Antoine *Janine Sutto as Tante *Olivette Thibault as Tante *Marie Fresni\u00e8res as Tante *Suzie Baillargeon as Aur\u00e9lie *Colette Cortois as Florida *Gigi Duckett as Anne-Marie *Marcel Marineau as Greffier, m\u00e9decin *Len Watt as Le gouverneur ==Production and release== A slow-moving but beautiful film shot by cinematographer Michel Brault, it cost nearly $1 million, making it the most expensive Canadian film to date. Poorly reviewed by critics (it was edited to accommodate theatre owners; a two-hour restored version shows more artistic coherence), it was a modest commercial success in Canada and was not a major release in France and the United States. Henry Herx gave it a mixed review in his Family Guide to Movies on Video: \"[T]he movie captures a vanished era, has excellent acting and the beauty of its settings[,] but its story of hot passion in a cold climate is heavily melodramatic.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1973 films Category:Canadian films Category:Canadian drama films Category:Films directed by Claude Jutra Category:Films set in Quebec Category:Films shot in Quebec Category:Films based on Canadian novels Category:Films set in the 1830s ",
