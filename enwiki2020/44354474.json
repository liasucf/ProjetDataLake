The program on ABS-CBN was changed to SPG rating by the Movie and Television Review and Classification Board after the incident, and reverted to the standard PG rating when Ryan Bacalla was evicted from the house. With the entrance of the regular housemates on Day 50, viewers were given limited streaming for two hours from weekdays, during Pinoy Big Brother: 737 Online. Eventually, 24-hour live streaming returned on Sky Cable and online on August 17 which is Day 59 of the show, and added a \"Parental Guidance\" on-screen text (later an MTRCB adopted blue \"PG\" system) for the safety of the viewers. | |} ==Awards== *January 28: MITV Gawad Kamalayan, organized by the Mapua Institute of Technology. *February 8: 2015 Paragala Central Luzon Media Awards, organized by the Holy Angel University. *February 18: 2015 Adamson University Media Awards, organized by the Adamson University.
