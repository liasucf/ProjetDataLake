The pair made the semi-finals of the 1993 Romanian Open and were finalists at the Prague Open in 1994. They were unable to compete in the Prague final, giving opponents Karel Nov\u00e1\u010dek and Mats Wilander the title in a walkover. In 1999 he made another ATP Tour semi-final, at the International Raiffeisen Grand Prix tournament in Sankt P\u00f6lten, with Petr P\u00e1la, in a run which included a win over second seeds David Adams and John-Laffnie de Jager. He won a total of four titles on the Challenger circuit. As a coach he is most famous for his involvement with Tom\u00e1\u0161 Berdych, who he coached from 2009 to 2014, during which time he made the final of Wimbledon. Prior to this he worked with Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek. More recently he has been the coach of Ji\u0159\u00ed Vesel\u00fd and Barbora Str\u00fdcov\u00e1. ==ATP Tour career finals== ===Doubles: 1 (0\u20131)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !Result !Date !Tournament !Tier !Surface !Partner !Opponent !class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |bgcolor=#ffa07a|Runner-up |August, 1994 |Prague, Czech Republic |International Series |Clay | Pavel V\u00edzner | Karel Nov\u00e1\u010dek Mats Wilander |(W/O) |} ==Challenger titles== ===Doubles: (4)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% !style=\"width:20px\" class=\"unsortable\"|No. !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:220px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Partner !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |1. |1995 |Oberstaufen, Germany |Clay | Ji\u0159\u00ed Nov\u00e1k | Lorenzo Manta Patrick Mohr |4\u20136, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 |- |2. |1995 |Guayaquil, Ecuador |Clay | Pavel V\u00edzner | Pablo Campana Nicol\u00e1s Lapentti |6\u20131, 6\u20131 |- |3. |1996 |Hamburg, Germany |Carpet | Pavel V\u00edzner | Patrik K\u00fchnen Karsten Braasch |6\u20133, 7\u20135 |- |4. |1998 |Nettingsdorf, Austria |Clay | Borut Urh | Tom\u00e1\u0161 Cibulec Leo\u0161 Friedl |6\u20131, 6\u20134 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Czech male tennis players Category:Czech tennis coaches ",
