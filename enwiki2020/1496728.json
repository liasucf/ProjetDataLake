It was during this time that the squadron derived its Hornet insignia and motto for the squadron badge, after overhearing a Belgian General refer to the squadron's defence of his trenches, \"Like angry hornets attacking the enemy aircraft\". The Hornet became affectionately known as \"Crabro,\" Latin for hornet. The squadron's official motto became, \"Irritatus Lacessit Crabro\" (The Hornet Attacks When Roused).Squadrons of the Battle of Britain.
