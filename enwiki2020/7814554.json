    "text": "The United Nations General Assembly Sixth Committee (also known as the Legal Committee or C6) is one of six main committees of the General Assembly of the United Nations. It deals primarily with legal matters and is the primary forum for the consideration of international law and other legal matters concerning the United Nations. == Mandate == The United Nations General Assembly has an express mandate to promote the progressive development of public international law as laid out in the Charter of the United Nations. Specifically, Article 13 of the Charter states that the General Assembly has the authority to \"initiate studies and make recommendations for the purpose of: (a) promoting international co-operation in the political field and encouraging the progressive development of international law and its codification.\" Subsequent practice has interpreted this provision as a broad authorization to elaborate new treaties on the widest range of issues, to adopt them, and to recommend them to states for their subsequent signature, ratification or accession.The Charter of the United Nations: a commentary, (M\u00fcnchen: C. H. Beck Verlag, 1995), pp. 265 \u2013 266; Paul C. Szasz, The Security Council Starts Legislating, 96 American Journal of International Law, (2002) p. 901. While international law-making negotiations take place in a variety of specialized bodies of the United Nations, depending on their actual subject-matter, those negotiations related to general international law are usually held at the Sixth Committee.United Nations General Assembly Rules of Procedure, art. 98; Alan Boyle and Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) pp. 116 \u2013 117. == Composition and method of work == The Sixth Committee has universal membership, as such all United Nations Member States are entitled to representation in its proceedings. Non-member states with observer status may also attend and participate in the discussions of the Committee. The Sixth Committee meets every year for six weeks in parallel with the General Assembly\u2019s annual session, with its work beginning after the general debate and finishing by mid-November. Occasionally, the Committee may also be reconvened upon request of the General Assembly to address substantive questions. Before the work of the Committee begins, the General Assembly assigns to it a list of agenda items to be discussed. Common agenda items include: * The promotion of justice and international law * Accountability and internal United Nations justice matters * Drug control * Crime prevention * Combating international terrorism The Committee also hears the annual reports of its reporting bodies, as well as considers requests for observer status in the General Assembly. The Committee does not hold a general debate at the start of its session, instead discussing its agenda items one by one, following a program of work adopted at its first meeting. Following formal discussions and negotiations, any adopted proposals are submitted to the Plenary of the General Assembly for final adoption. If a particular issue proves too complex for the Committee, it may refer it to the International Law Commission, or it may create an ad hoc committee to discuss it.Herbert W. Briggs, The International Law Commission (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1965); Alan Boyle and Christine Chinkin, The Making of International Law (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2007) p. 170. The highlight of the Sixth Committee\u2019s work is the \"International Law Week\" beginning at the end of October, when top Legal Advisers from Member States meet in New York to consider the report of the International Law Commission. Additionally, during the week, the reports of the International Court of Justice and the International Criminal Court are also presented to the Plenary of the General Assembly. == Reporting bodies == The following bodies all report to the General Assembly through the Sixth Committee: * Committee on Relations with the Host Country * International Law Commission * Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization * United Nations Commission on International Trade Law * United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination, and Wider Appreciation of International Law * Various ad hoc Committees established by the General Assembly in the context of the work of C6 == Current state == In its 75th Session, the Committee will focus on: * Promotion of justice and international law ** Criminal accountability of United Nations officials and experts on mission ** Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law on the work of its fifty-third session ** United Nations Programme of Assistance in the Teaching, Study, Dissemination and Wider Appreciation of International Law ** Report of the International Law Commission on the work of its seventy-second session ** Crimes against humanity ** Expulsion of aliens ** Status of the Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 and relating to the protection of victims of armed conflicts ** Consideration of effective measures to enhance the protection, security and safety of diplomatic and consular missions and representatives ** Report of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization ** The rule of law at the national and international levels ** The scope and application of the principle of universal jurisdiction ** Responsibility of international organizations ** Protection of persons in the event of disasters ** Strengthening and promoting the international treaty framework * Drug control, crime prevention and combating international terrorism in all its forms and manifestations ** Measures to eliminate international terrorism * Organizational, administrative and other matters ** Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly ** Programme planning ** Administration of justice at the United Nations ** Report of the Committee on Relations with the Host Country ** Observer status for the Cooperation Council of Turkic-speaking States in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Eurasian Economic Union in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Community of Democracies in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands Secretariat in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Global Environment Facility in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the International Organization of Employers in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the International Trade Union Confederation in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Boao Forum for Asia in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Small Island Developing States Dock (SIDS DOCK) in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Central Asia Regional Economic Cooperation Institute in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Asian Forest Cooperation Organization in the General Assembly ** Observer status for the Global Dryland Alliance in the General Assembly == Bureau == The following make up the bureau of the Sixth Committee for the 75th Session of the General Assembly: {| class=\"wikitable\" !
