According to the census of 2011, the village has a population of 286, an increase from 248, counted by the 2001 census. Most of the inhabitants of Geisi\u0161k\u0117s are of Ukrainian descent. Together with the nearby Air\u0117nai I and Air\u0117nai II villages, it forms an Eastern Orthodox enclave in a Catholic countryside. == History == In 1860, Geisi\u0161k\u0117s was briefly described by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Syrokomla in his ethnographic study of the environs of Vilnius city. He writes: In the early 19th century, the first wave of Slavic migrants came to Geisi\u0161k\u0117s, who established an Orthodox community in 1839. In the middle of the 19th century, there were 30 families of Belarusian settlers from Grodno Governorate in Geisi\u0161k\u0117s. This community established an Eastern Orthodox church in 1865. In 1903, the second wave of Orthodox migrants came, when first 42 families from Brest settled in the village. These settlers came to Brest in the second half of the 19th century from Volhynia, Ukraine, but in 1900 Nicholas II of Russia ordered the construction of a new artillery bombing range for Brest Fortress, thus inhabitants of nearby villages had to be resettled. The Tsar offered for these Ukrainians return to Volhynia, relocate to Siberia or chose a place in Trakai County of the Vilnius Governorate, and they chose the latter. Before World War I, in Geisi\u0161k\u0117s, Air\u0117nai I and Air\u0117nai II there were 173 Ukrainian families of this second wave migration.Geisi\u0161k\u0117s. Place and time In 1946, Geisi\u0161k\u0117s Orthodox parish counted 642 members. During the Soviet period, local kolkhoz was rich and advanced, compared to others and shown as exemplary. After a wave of migration of local inhabitants to Vilnius in the second half of the 20th century, Geisi\u0161k\u0117s benefits from its proximity to both Vilnius and touristic Kernav\u0117. == References == Category:Villages in Vilnius County Category:Vilnius District Municipality ",
