Pearson owns educational media brands including Addison\u2013Wesley, Peachpit, Prentice Hall, eCollege, Longman, Scott Foresman, and others. Pearson is part of Pearson plc, which formerly owned the Financial Times. It claims to have been formed in 1840, with the current incarnation of the company created when Pearson plc purchased the education division of Simon & Schuster (including Prentice Hall and Allyn & Bacon) from Viacom and merged it with its own education division, Addison-Wesley Longman, to form Pearson Education. Pearson Education was rebranded to Pearson in 2011 and split into an International and a North American division. Although Pearson generates approximately 60 percent of its sales in North America, it operates in more than 70 countries. Pearson International is headquartered in London, and maintains offices across Europe, Asia and South America. Its online chat support is based in the Philippines. Pearson North America is headquartered at 330 Hudson in New York City, New York. It previously was located in Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Pearson Italia SpA, also known as Pearson Paravia Bruno Mondadori, was created through the purchase of PBM Editori, which was, in turn, a merge of Paravia (based in Turin) and Bruno Mondadori (based in Milan). ==Imprints== Pearson has a number of publishing imprints: ==Logo== Pearson's logo is the unconventional symbol known as the interrobang (\u203d), a combination of a question mark and an exclamation point, meant to convey \"the excitement and fun of learning.\" ==Partnerships== Pearson has partnered with five other higher-education publishers to create CourseSmart, a company developed to sell college textbooks in eTextbook format on a common platform.

One of the most prominent featured a passage about a talking pineapple on the 8th Grade ELA test (revealed to be based on Daniel Pinkwater's The Story of the Rabbit and the Eggplant, with the eggplant changed into a pineapple). After public outcry, the NYSED announced it would not count the questions in scoring. Other errors included a miscalculated question on the 8th Grade Mathematics test regarding astronomical units, a 4th grade math question with two correct answers, errors in the 6th grade ELA scoring guide, and over twenty errors on foreign-language math tests. In May 2015, British comedian John Oliver analysed problems with Pearson's standardized tests and the company's greater lack of accountability on his HBO series Last Week Tonight. ==Technology products== Pearson's products include MyMathLab and Mastering Platform. === PowerSchool === In 2006, Pearson acquired PowerSchool, a student information system, from Apple.
