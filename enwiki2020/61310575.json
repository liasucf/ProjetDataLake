    "text": "The 1928 Dornier J Santos Dumont crash was an aircraft crash during the celebrations for the return of Alberto Santos Dumont to Brazil on 3 December 1928. On the occasion of the return of Santos Dumont, several honours were organized, including the over-flight of the SS Cap Arcona by two Dornier Do J Wal flying boats of the Condor Syndicate. == Accident== The SS Cap Arcona in 1927. The Dornier Do Js, P-BAIA Guanabara and P-BACA Santos Dumont, took off from Guanabara Bay and flew over the Cap Arcona, where they sent welcome messages to Alberto Santos Dumont. The Santos Dumont was flown by August Wilhem Paschen and was carrying nine passengers and crew, including friends of Santos Dumont and personalities of the time. Due to the error of one of the pilots, the two aircraft entered a collision course, forcing the pilots to perform evasive maneuvers. The Guanabara escaped unscathed from the near collision, but the Santos Dumont crashed into Guanabara Bay, watched by the crew and passengers of the Arcona, including Santos Dumont. Depressed, he suspended the festivities and returned to Paris. Despite rescue efforts led by the Brazilian Navy destroyers Amazonas and Par\u00e1, only the mechanic of the aircraft, Walter Hasseldorf, survived the crash, dying hours later. Among the dead in the disaster was Dr. Amaury de Medeiros, the mathematician, Manuel Amoroso Costa, Tobias Moscoso, Ferdinando Labouriau, Frederico de Oliveira Coutinho and Paulo de Castro Maia. During the removal of the bodies and the remains of the aircraft, a Brazilian Navy diver died. ==Consequences== After witnessing the accident, Santos Dumont became depressed, canceling the festivities and returning to France. His depression worsened and he ultimately committed suicide in 1932. This was the first accident with a commercial aircraft in Brazil, although it was not operating commercially that day, generating great commotion with the press and public opinion. ==Bibliography== * SILVA, Carlos Ari Cesar Germano da; O rastro da bruxa: hist\u00f3ria da avia\u00e7\u00e3o comercial brasileira no s\u00e9culo XX atrav\u00e9s dos seus acidentes; Porto Alegre Editora EDIPUCRS, 2008, pp 18\u201321. ==References== Category:Alberto Santos- Dumont Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Brazil Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1928 Category:1928 in Brazil ",
