Retrieved 31 March 2020. The album reached No. 39 on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart \"Flash - Jeff Beck | Awards\". AllMusic. RhythmOne.

Two singles also charted, the first being a reunion with singer Rod Stewart (from the Jeff Beck Group) for a cover of \"People Get Ready\" by Curtis Mayfield/The Impressions, which reached No. 5 on Billboard's Mainstream Rock and No. 48 on the Hot 100, as well as the top 40 in four other countries. The second single, \"Gets Us All in the End\", reached No. 20 on Mainstream Rock. The instrumental \"Escape\" went on to win the award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance at the 1986 Grammys, \"28th Grammy Awards - 1986\". Rock On The Net. Retrieved 31 March 2020. which was to be Beck's first of many such awards. ==Overview== The album is unique for Beck in that it is composed mainly of songs with vocals, save for two instrumentals in the form of \"Escape\" and \"You Know, We Know\", written by his longtime collaborators Jan Hammer and Tony Hymas respectively. Designed to be a foray into pop music in order to capitalise on that sound at the time, Flash was produced by Nile Rodgers for that reason. Such was the desire by the record company to score a hit album, Beck uncharacteristically found himself singing on \"Get Workin'\" and \"Night After Night\", at the insistence of Rodgers.Rosen, Steven (1989). \"Jeff Beck Interview (1989)\". Modern Guitars Magazine. Archived from the original on 5 January 2011. Retrieved 31 March 2020. \"Ambitious\" and \"People Get Ready\" feature a rare instance of Beck playing a Jackson Soloist rather than his usual Fender Stratocaster.Noble, Douglas J (June 1993). \"Jeff Beck Outtakes\". The Douglas J Noble Guitar Archive. Retrieved 31 March 2020. Despite its success, he has since expressed his disdain for the album, calling it a \"record company goof\" and \"a very sad sort of time\" for him.Guy, Paul (1999). \"Jeff Beck - Who Else?\". Paul Guy Guitars. Retrieved 31 March 2020. The CD edition of Flash included two bonus tracks, \"Nighthawks\" and \"Back on the Streets\", which were originally released as B-sides. Another track from the album's recording sessions, \"Wild Thing\" (a cover of The Troggs), was released only as a promo single and never on the album,\"Jeff Beck \u2013 Wild Thing\". Discogs. Retrieved 31 March 2020. but would later be featured on Beck's 1991 compilation album Beckology. ==Critical reception== Flash has received mixed reviews. Stephen Thomas Erlewine at AllMusic gave it three stars out of five and described \"People Get Ready\" as \"a fine performance\". David Fricke at Rolling Stone called the album \"one of Beck's best ever\" and praised it as having \"awesome guitar prowess and startling commercial daring\", but remarked that the collaborations with Rodgers and Baker \"almost don't work\". Robert Christgau at The Village Voice gave it a 'B' grade, labelling it as \"funk-metal fusion\" and \"the best LP of [Beck's] pathologically spotty career\"; the latter due to Rodgers' production. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Jeff Beck \u2013 lead vocals , lead and rhythm guitar , production *Jimmy Hall \u2013 lead vocals , background vocals *Rod Stewart \u2013 lead vocals *Karen Lawrence \u2013 lead vocals *Jan Hammer \u2013 Fairlight CMI *Tony Hymas \u2013 keyboard , production *Duane Hitchings \u2013 keyboard *Robert Sabino \u2013 keyboard *Carmine Appice \u2013 drums *Jay Burnett \u2013 drums *Jimmy Bralower \u2013 drums *Barry DeSouza \u2013 drums *Tony \"Thunder\" Smith \u2013 drums *Doug Wimbish \u2013 bass *Tina B \u2013 background vocals *Curtis King \u2013 background vocals *David Simms \u2013 background vocals *Frank Simms \u2013 background vocals *George Simms \u2013 background vocals *David Spinner \u2013 background vocals *David Charles \u2013 engineering *Jason Corsaro \u2013 engineering *Eddie DeLena \u2013 engineering *Rob Eaton \u2013 engineering *Chris Lord-Alge \u2013 engineering *Tom Lord-Alge \u2013 engineering *Eric Mohler \u2013 engineering *Tony Tavener \u2013 engineering *Nigel Walker \u2013 engineering *Andy Wallace \u2013 engineering *Nile Rodgers \u2013 production *Arthur Baker \u2013 production ==Charts== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
