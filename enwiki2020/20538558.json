She earned a Bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan in 1977 and a Master's degree in Broadcast Journalism from Northwestern University in 1980. == Professional career == Daniels began her career in 1980 at the CBS affiliate in Green Bay Wisconsin, then moved to Buffalo, New York to report and anchor newscasts at WKBW-TV, the ABC affiliate. From there she moved to Washington, D.C., where she was a reporter and fill-in anchor at WJLA-TV, the ABC station from 1985-1988. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Daniels was an anchor at WSVN-TV in Miami, where she was the first woman to solo anchor a nationally-syndicated, tabloid-style magazine program. Inside Story only ran from 1989-1990, but was hugely popular in Miami, beating the famous \"A Current Affair\" (then-anchored by Maury Povich) in local ratings. Shortly before leaving WSVN, Daniels was caught on the air telling a producer \"You suck!\" \"I'm sorry I said it,\" Daniels later said, according to a report in the Chicago Sun-Times on March 22, 1993. \"I don't usually lose my temper when I'm doing a newscast.\" In April 1993, Daniels joined WBBM-TV in Chicago, Illinois as an anchor and reporter. In mid-1993, Daniels and Joan Lovett began anchoring the station's new noon newscast. In September 1994, Daniels left WBBM to join A Current Affair as a New York-based weekday host. She hosted the show until September 1995, when she shifted to being a correspondent for the program's weekday editions and the anchor of the show's weekend edition. The show went off the air in 1996.https://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1995/09/15/1995-09-15__central_park_west__premiere.html In 1998, Daniels joined KHQ-TV in Spokane, Washington.
