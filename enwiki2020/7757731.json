    "text": "Callistratus, Alexandrian grammarian, flourished at the beginning of the 2nd century BC. He was one of the pupils of Aristophanes of Byzantium, who were distinctively called Aristophanei. Callistratus chiefly devoted himself to the elucidation of the Greek poets; a few fragments of his commentaries have been preserved in the various collections of scholia and in Athenaeus. He was also the author of a miscellaneous work called Summikta (), used by the later lexicographers, and of a treatise on courtesans (Athenaeus iii.125b, xiii.591d). == Bibliography == * H.-L.
