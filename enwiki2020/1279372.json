    "text": "The Lamborghini V8 is a ninety degree (90\u00b0) V8 petrol engine designed by Lamborghini in the 1970s for their less-expensive vehicles.Lamborghini Urraco & the V8s Urraco, Bravo, Silhouette, Athon, Jalpa. Jean-Francois Marchet, Osprey autohistory, 1983 It was only the second internal combustion engine ever developed by the company, and first saw production for the 1971 Lamborghini Urraco. It was designed by Gian Paolo Dallara. The all-aluminium alloy engine was introduced as a 2.5-litre variant, displacing , but was expanded, by increasing the piston stroke to a 3.0-litre variant for 1975 - now displacing . A 2.0-litre reduced-stroke version was also introduced in 1975 for sale in Italy, displacing , because of Italian legislation which imposed punitive taxes on cars whose engines displaced more than 2.0 litres. This V8 engine was also used in two other models, the Lamborghini Silhouette in 1976-1977 in which it kept the 3.0-litre displacement, and the slightly updated replacement in 1982, the Lamborghini Jalpa, which saw the engine increased in size to 3.5 litres, displacing , for ease in meeting ever-tighter emissions requirements. ==Specifications== ;engine configuration: 90\u00b0 V8 engine; wet sump lubrication system ;engine displacement etc. :2.0: ; bore x stroke: (stroke ratio: 1.46:1 - oversquare/short-stroke), per cylinder :2.5: ; bore x stroke: (stroke ratio: 1.62:1 - oversquare/short-stroke), per cylinder :3.0: ; bore x stroke: (stroke ratio: 1.58:1 - oversquare/short-stroke), per cylinder :3.5: ; bore x stroke: (stroke ratio: 1.15:1 - oversquare/short- stroke), per cylinder ;cylinder block and crankcase: cast aluminium alloy ;cylinder heads and valvetrain :2.0/2.5: cast aluminium alloy, two valves per cylinder, 16 valves total, chain driven single overhead camshafts :3.0/3.5: cast aluminium alloy, two valves per cylinder, 16 valves total, chain driven double overhead camshafts ;aspiration: Naturally aspirated ;fuel system: 2.0: 4 twin-barrel down-draught Weber 40 IDF 1 carburettors : 2.5: 4 twin-barrel down-draught Weber 40 IDF 1 or Solex C40P117 carburettors : 3.0: 4 twin-barrel down-draught Weber 40 DCNF carburetors : 3.5: 4 twin-barrel down-draught Weber 42 DCNF carburetors ;ignition system and engine management: ???? ;exhaust system: ???? ;2.0 rated motive power & torque outputs and applications: @ 7,800 rpm; \u2014 Lamborghini Urraco ;2.5 rated motive power & torque outputs and applications : @ 7,500 rpm; \u2014 Lamborghini Urraco : \u2014 ;3.0 rated motive power & torque outputs and applications: @ 5,750 rpm : @ 7,500 rpm; \u2014 Lamborghini Urraco : @ 7,500 rpm; \u2014 Lamborghini Silhouette : @ 7,800 rpm; \u2014 Lamborghini Urraco ;3.5 rated motive power & torque outputs and applications: @ 7,000 rpm; \u2014 Lamborghini Jalpa ==References== ==External links== *Lamborghini.com official website V 8 Category:Gasoline engines by model Category:V8 engines ",
