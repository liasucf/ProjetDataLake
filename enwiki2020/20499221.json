As a young man he was active in the Stureplan party scene, which plays a role in his novels.https://forfatterweb.dk/oversigt/zlapidus00 He made his writing debut in August 2006 with Easy Money, an account of the Stockholm underworld,http://www.salomonssonagency.se/php/book.php?lang=en&bookid;=78 and the first of the Stockholm Noir trilogy. Two years later the second installment Aldrig fucka upp was published by Wahlstr\u00f6m & Widstrand. A graphic novel with illustrator Peter Bergting (The Portent) entitled G\u00e4ngkrig 145 was published in May 2009. While this project does take places in the same universe as the novels, it is not the third part of the Stockholm Noir trilogy but rather a side story.http://www.realtid.se/ArticlePages/200810/30/20081030160521_Realtid449/20081030160521_Realtid449.dbp.asp The third part was published in 2011 with the title Livet deluxe. In 2014 Lapidus published the novel VIP-rummet which is the start of a new series unrelated to his Stockholm Noir trilogy. The second part STHLM Delete was published in 2015.

The third part Top Dog in the new series was published in 2017 (in English in 2018). Together with two others Lapidus has written the TV-series Advokaten.
