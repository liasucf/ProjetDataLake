    "text": "Love from a Stranger is a 1936 play based on \"Philomel Cottage\", a 1924 short story by British mystery writer Agatha Christie. ==Background== The play was adapted by Frank Vosper and opened at the New Theatre on 31 March 1936. Vosper starred in the play, which was later turned into a successful film. Promotional extracts were broadcast on the BBC Regional Programme on 1 May 1936 in a 20-minute programme with members of the then-current stage cast. On 9 May 1936, the final performance was given at the New Theatre, and the play immediately transferred to the Queen's Theatre on11 May, where it ran until 8 August 1936. It reopened two days later at the Streatham Hill Theatre for one week. ==Reception of London production== The play garnered good reviews with the Daily Herald stating that it was \"a brilliant terror play\" and \"our blood was gloriously curdled last night\". The Times was equally enthusiastic stating \"The final act is very sure of its effect. The suspense is maintained; each turn of the story is clear and striking; the terror-stricken self-control of the girl and the man's gross and abominable insanity are depicted by Miss Marie Ney and Mr Vosper with every refinement of a murderous thriller. Within the limits of its purpose, the acting of this scene could scarcely be bettered.\" It is claimed that the climax was so chilling to members of the audience that some fainted with the suspense. Ivor Brown in The Observer of 5 April 1936 wrote \"There is authentic and tremendous suspense about the struggle between Bruce and his captive wife. One feels that, if any bird did nest near this cottage, it would be the croaking raven or fatal owl.\" Frank Vosper's performance was described as \"very clever\" and \"a first-rate study of disintegration, in which the muscle of the first act becomes the fearsome flabbiness of the last. Both the chief players have to change character during the play, which, since this is well done, gives it a special acting-value apart from its interest of plot and problem.\"The Observer 5 April 1936 (Page 17) The Scotsman of 1 April 1936 started its review with: \"To watch the performance of Love from a Stranger at the New Theatre is like witnessing a clever conjuring show. One knows that all that is apparently happening is next to impossible, yet one cannot fail to be thrilled.\" The review went on to state \"Mr Frank Vosper achieves with great art the transformation from a pleasant young Colonial to a habitual murderer. The scene where he gradually reveals his true character by tearing up his wife's scarf in a paroxysm of murderous fury is invested by him with a realism that is almost horrible. It was difficult to assess the performance of Miss Marie Ney because it was difficult to believe that she would ever have placed herself in such a situation.\"The Scotsman 1 April 1936 (Page 16) Credits of the London production * Director: Murray MacDonald * Frank Vosper as Bruce Lovell * Muriel Aked as Louise Garrard * Norah Howard as Mavis Wilson * Marie Ney as Cecily Harrington * Geoffrey King as Nigel Lawrence * Charles Hodges as Hodgson * Esma Cannon as Ethel * S Major Jones as Dr. Gribble ==Broadway production== Vosper took the play to New York where it ran from 21 September to c. 1 November 1936 for 38 performances.
