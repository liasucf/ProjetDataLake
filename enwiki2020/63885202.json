A French law of 3 June 1975 changed the designation for Maison de retraite (Retirement home), partly because the old terminology had become derogatory. Another reform in 1999 created the new \u00c9tablissement d\u2019h\u00e9bergement pour personnes \u00e2g\u00e9es d\u00e9pendantes (EHPAD) terminology. == Operation == EHPADs can be public or privately owned. In 2017, from a total of 7000 in France, 40% were public, 30% belonged to non-commercial organizations and 30% to the private sector. The largest private groups managing EHPAD in France in 2020 were: * Korian with approximately 25,000 beds * Orpea with approximately 20,000 beds * DomusVi with approximately 17,000 beds == Residents == The level of dependency of seniors in EHPADs is high: in 2011, more than 40% % of residents had Alzheimer's disease, and three quarters had a Cardiovascular disease. === Dependency levels === A normalized scale determines the level of dependency of a resident. This scale called GIR (groupe iso-ressources) has the following values: * GIR 1 : Total mental and physical dependency * GIR 2 : High mental and physical dependency * GIR 3 : Physical dependency * GIR 4 : Partial physical dependency * GIR 5 : Moderate dependency * GIR 6 : No dependency == Costs== The cost for the family of a resident can be high. According to a 2010 KPMG study, the mean cost for one day for an EHPAD place is 49 \u20ac for accommodation, and 24 \u20ac for care. ==References== Category:Caregiving Category:Geriatrics Category:Housing ",
