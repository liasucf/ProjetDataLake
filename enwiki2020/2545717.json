Gerhard Hanappi (16 February 1929 \u2013 23 August 1980) was an Austrian football midfielder who is often regarded as one of the greatest Austrian footballers. He is also the father of Hardy Hanappi. ==Club career== A versatile midfielder, Hanappi started his career at SC Wacker Wien, where he made his Bundesliga debut in 1947. Deemed as Austria's biggest football talent, he then controversially moved to play for big city rivals Rapid Vienna from 1950 till 1965. His time at Rapid proved to be very successful, winning the Austrian Championship title 7 times. He also captained the side for seven years and was chosen in Rapid's Team of the Century in 1999. ==International career== He made his debut for Austria at only 19 years of age in November 1948 against Sweden and was a participant at the 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, where they reached 3rd place, and at the 1958 World Cup. He captained the national team from 1955 on. His last international was a September 1962 match against Czechoslovakia. He earned 93 caps, scoring 12 goals.Appearances for Austrian National Team \u2013 RSSSF He has held the national team appearances record until Anton Polster earned his 94th cap in June 1998. ==Playing style== One of the finest midfielders of his generation,Europe's best Player of the Century \u2013 IFFHS Hanappi was nominally a goalscoring wing half, however his versatility allowed him to successfully play in almost all positions. Hanappi's technical abilities and creativity allowed him to play as an effective play-maker. He was also very intelligent with an excellent sense of anticipation which made him very useful in defensive duties, and also enabled him to make well timed runs in the box. This along with his accurate shot enabled him to be a prolific goalscorer, even once being league top scorer. ==Retirement and death== After his football career Hanappi worked as an architect. He planned the Weststadion in Vienna, which was renamed to Gerhard Hanappi Stadium after his death. He died of cancer in 1980, aged 51. ==Honours== ===Club=== *Austrian Football Bundesliga (7): ** 1951, 1952, 1954, 1956, 1957, 1960, 1964 *Austrian Cup (1): ** 1961 *Zentropa Cup (1): ** 1951 ===International=== *FIFA World Cup Third Place: ** 1954 ==External links== * Player profile and stats \u2013 Rapid Wien Archive * ==References== Category:1929 births Category:1980 deaths Category:Footballers from Vienna Category:Austrian footballers Category:Austria international footballers Category:1954 FIFA World Cup players Category:1958 FIFA World Cup players Category:SK Rapid Wien players Category:Deaths from cancer in Austria Category:20th-century Austrian architects Category:Association football midfielders ",
