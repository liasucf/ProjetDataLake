On 20 May 2015, P\u00e9rez was selected in the Colombian U-23 squad for the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. After not playing in the group stage she made her World Cup debut on 22 June 2015, against United States, when the usual starter Sandra Sep\u00falveda was suspended due to yellow card accumulation. However, P\u00e9rez did not play the entire match because in the 47th minute (the beginning of the second half) she brought down US forward Alex Morgan inside the penalty area. This resulted in a penalty for United States and a red card for P\u00e9rez, who was dismissed from the game. Abby Wambach eventually missed the penalty but the United States took advantage of having one more player on the field and scored two goals to eliminate Colombia 2\u20130 in the Round of 16. == References == == External links == * * *Catalina P\u00e9rez on Football.it Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Women's association football goalkeepers Category:Colombian women's footballers Category:Sportspeople from Bogot\u00e1 Category:Colombia women's international footballers Category:2015 FIFA Women's World Cup players Category:Olympic footballers of Colombia Category:Footballers at the 2016 Summer Olympics Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Colombia Category:Pan American Games medalists in football Category:Footballers at the 2019 Pan American Games Category:Fiorentina Women's F.C. players Category:Colombian expatriate women's footballers Category:Colombian expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Expatriate women's footballers in Italy Category:Colombian emigrants to the United States Category:People with acquired American citizenship Category:American women's soccer players Category:Soccer players from Florida Category:Sportspeople from Boca Raton, Florida Category:American sportspeople of Latin American descent Category:American people of Colombian descent Category:Miami Hurricanes women's soccer players Category:Mississippi State Bulldogs women's soccer players Category:American expatriate soccer players Category:American expatriate sportspeople in Italy ",
