Chapel Hill High School is part of the Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Schools district which contains two other high schools, Carrboro High School and East Chapel Hill High School. ==History== The original Chapel Hill High School was located on Franklin Street until, due to desegregation efforts of the mid-1960s, the school was demolished in favor of the construction of a new high school across town.\"A Thousand Words\" column by Jock Lauterer, \"Chapel Hill High School, 1962\", The Carrboro Citizen, December 24, 2008, pg. 8 White Chapel Hill High School merged with the black Lincoln High School to form the new Chapel Hill High School. Lincoln High School, which closed in 1966, had award-winning football and band programs. In particular, its 1961 football team won the state championship without a single point being scored against it all year and averaging over 40 points per game, an incredible feat. Renovation in progress in summer 2020 A major ($70 million) renovation began in June 2018, including constructing new buildings. ==Academics== In 1999, Chapel Hill High School was listed as one of the top-performing U.S. high schools in The Wall Street Journal (October 15, 1999), for \"the best student performance over the past 10 years based on SAT, achievement-test and standardized-test scores.\" In 2005, 62.5% of students took the SAT and scored an average of 1156 compared to a state average of 1008. Similarly, 97.3% of the student body has taken the PSAT, and scored an average of 155 compared to the state average of 133. Also, 69.2% (306 students) have participated in Advanced Placement (AP) examinations with 73.5% of all scores scoring above a 3. As of 2005, Chapel Hill High School also has a high graduation rate of 94.7%. In 2005, 94.7% of students were proficient on State English I tests, and 93.1% of students were proficient on State Algebra I tests. The school posted the third highest average SAT score in the Raleigh Durham area: 1754 with 87.9% of students taking the test. ==Athletics== Chapel Hill High School has around 20 athletic teams. In the fall, the school offers cheerleading, cross country, field hockey, football, men's soccer, women's tennis, ultimate frisbee, volleyball, and women's golf. In the winter, the school offers cheerleading, men's basketball, women's basketball, swimming and diving, and wrestling. In the spring, the school offers men's golf, men's lacrosse, women's soccer, softball, men's tennis, track, baseball, and women's lacrosse. Chapel Hill High School has won many state championships in athletics such as back to back trophies in the 3A Men\u2019s Soccer in 2017 and 2018, and their 3A Women\u2019s Soccer program winning in 2018, tying the state record for number of goals allowed with 2. ==The arts== Chapel Hill High has performing and visual arts programs. The school has a marching band, jazz band, symphonic band, concert band, orchestra, percussion ensemble, drama program, and several choruses. ==Schedule change== Before the 2006-07 school year, the high school used a six-period schedule. However, during the 2006-07 school year, a new controversial seven-period schedule was introduced. A mostly student-led protest organized sit downs with several members of the school board in order to avoid the change into a block schedule. After long talks between the two parties, the school board altered their plan to the now seven-period day. ==Controversy== During the 2007-2008 school year, a cheating ring was discovered inside the school. Several students had been in possession of a master key which they had used to repeatedly enter the school and teacher's rooms in order to access and photocopy tests and answer keys. The resulting answers were then used by these students to score higher on exams. The answer keys were usually stored on cell phones and passed or sent around between members of the group. Some colleges then contacted the school seeking information about who was involved such that the perpetrators could have their admissions revoked. However, only local colleges got in touch with the school, so most of the 11 implicated students managed to avoid harsh punishment. The master key copies had been in existence for about two years before anyone was caught. To avoid the possibility of some of the copies not being confiscated, all of the school's doors were re-keyed and the new keys are being held under closer supervision. The cost of this re-keying has been estimated at several thousand dollars. On April 15, 2010, a student brought a gun on a school bus and accidentally shot it at the ground. No one was hurt, but the school and several nearby schools went on lockdown. The student was later arrested. ==Notable alumni== *Bill Ransom Campbell, member of a group of modernist architects in North Carolina that had a major academic and architectural influence on the Modernism movement in the 1950s through 1970sNCModernist Bill Campbell.
