    "text": "Phase-field models on graphs are a discrete analogue to phase-field models, defined on a graph. They are used in image analysis (for feature identification) and for the segmentation of social networks. == Graph Ginzburg\u2013Landau functional == For a graph with vertices V and edge weights \\omega_{i,j}, the graph Ginzburg\u2013Landau functional of a map u:V\\to \\mathbb{R} is given by :F_\\varepsilon(u) = \\frac\\varepsilon2 \\sum_{i,j\\in V} \\omega_{ij} (u_i-u_j)^2 + \\frac1\\varepsilon \\sum_{i \\in V} W(u_i), where W is a double well potential, for example the quartic potential W(x) = x2(1 \u2212 x2). The graph Ginzburg\u2013Landau functional was introduced by Bertozzi and Flenner. In analogy to continuum phase-field models, where regions with u close to 0 or 1 are models for two phases of the material, vertices can be classified into those with uj close to 0 or close to 1, and for small \\varepsilon, minimisers of F_\\varepsilon will satisfy that uj is close to 0 or 1 for most nodes, splitting the nodes into two classes. == Graph Allen\u2013Cahn equation == To effectively minimise F_\\varepsilon, a natural approach is by gradient flow (steepest descent). This means to introduce an artificial time parameter and to solve the graph version of the Allen\u2013Cahn equation, :\\frac{d}{dt} u_j = -\\varepsilon (\\Delta u)_j-\\frac1\\varepsilon W'(u_j), where \\Delta is the graph Laplacian. The ordinary continuum Allen\u2013Cahn equation and the graph Allen\u2013Cahn equation are natural counterparts, just replacing ordinary calculus by calculus on graphs. A convergence result for a numerical graph Allen\u2013Cahn scheme has been established by Luo and Bertozzi. It is also possible to adapt other computational schemes for mean curvature flow, for example schemes involving thresholding like the Merriman\u2013Bence\u2013Osher scheme, to a graph setting, with analogous results.van Gennip, Yves.
