    "text": "Geniostoma is a genus of around 25 species of flowering plants in the family Loganiaceae. They are shrubs or small trees, with inflorescences borne in the axils of the simple, petiolate, oppositely-arranged leaves. The flowers are arranged in cymes, and each is pentamerous. The name Geniostoma derives from the Greek words ('; \"beard\") and ('; \"mouth\"), referring to the hairs in the corolla tube of some species. The genus is widely distributed across the Pacific Ocean from Japan, Malesia to Australia in the west, and east to the Tuamotu Archipelago; one species is also found on the Mascarene Islands. The Hawaiian endemic genus Labordia has been included in Geniostoma by some authors. These two genera have been grouped together in the family \"Geniostomaceae\", but are considered by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group to be part of a wider Loganiaceae. ==Selected species== * Geniostoma astylum * Geniostoma clavigerum * Geniostoma confertiflorum * Geniostoma gagneae * Geniostoma huttonii (Lord Howe Island) * Geniostoma ligustrifolium \u2013 hangehange * Geniostoma macrophyllum * Geniostoma petiolosum (Lord Howe Island) * Geniostoma quadrangulare * Geniostoma rapense * Geniostoma rupestre * Geniostoma stipulare * Geniostoma sykesii (Cook Islands) * Geniostoma umbellatum * Geniostoma uninervium ==Further reading== * ==References== Category:Gentianales genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
