This is the case for GNU tar. BSD tar uses its own implementation, since it also has to deal with archive formats that do their own compression. # Allows adding a variable amount of redundancy for much better error recovery. See also RAR (file format). # Extracting/adding file and/or directory names into archive in either UTF-7, UTF-8 or UTF-16/UCS-2 encoding to support single file/directory name which contains characters from different languages. More recent versions of the zip file format have support for Unicode filenames. # In WinRAR 3.60, when opening 7-Zip archives which contains Unicode file/directory names, they will not be displayed correctly. There will be no problem extracting them, however. # Does support Unicode names, but not under the default (initial) option settings: the user must tick \"Use OEM conversion for filenames\" under \"General\" on the \"Miscellaneous\" tab in the Configuration dialog to enable Unicode name support. Full support for Unicode files names by default is supported only for 7-Zip and RAR archive formats. # Commandline batch compression is available only for ZIP and ALZ formats. # UTF-8 file/path-names support was completed in release 3.0.1 on Unix systems, and in release 5.8.0 on Windows systems. GUI UTF-8 support for full internationalization of the application was completed in release 2.2.0. Optionally, extended characters can be set to be replaced by jolly \"?\" character for exporting scripts to legacy systems; scripts creation screen informs if commands are ANSI-safe, OEM-codepage-safe (on Windows), or requires UTF-8 compliant environment to run (system, command interpreter, etc). # Commandline batch compression and expansion requires free add-on software downloaded from the WinZip website. # Peazip supports file encryption and file name encryption, although only in certain types of archives, including its own Pea format, 7-zip, zip and Arc. # Many shells have built-in zip file support. Windows Explorer has \"Send To\"->\"ZIP-compressed folder\". # Unicode and volumes since version 3.0 (2008). AES since 3.1 (in beta). === Archive format support === ==== Reading ==== Information about what archive formats the archivers can read.

These external programs may be shipped with your Operating System. # GNU tar lets you implement your own filters , allowing you to use other compression programs (p7zip, ...) and filters (GPG, ...). # Starting from version 11. # Requires external program. More info # Archive Utility itself is unable to open ISO files, but Disk Utility, which also comes with Mac OS X, is able to mount them as virtual disks. # Requires external program. # Only partial support for reading proprietary SITX format. # FreeARC uses `.arc` as its filename extension, but this format is not the same as the traditional ARC file. # Supports these formats as compression stream of other archive formats like tar.bz2 or iso.xz but does not support the format as an archive itself, as they are not archive formats. See the above explanation for tar. # B1 Free Archiver for Android and B1 Online Archiver support ARJ format. ==== Writing ==== Information about what archive formats the archivers can write and create.
