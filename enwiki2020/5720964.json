    "text": "* Not to be confused with Brantano UK Brantano Footwear (Brantano, en de wereld ligt aan je voeten (English: Brantano, and the world is at your feet)) was a European chain of retail stores specialising in footwear for men, women and children, that was founded in Belgium. It went into administration in March 2017. The stores closed in June 2017 with the loss of over 900 jobs. ==Origin== The company originated from a small factory run by Andr\u00e9 Brantegem and his brother in Lede, East Flanders. The Brantegem brothers were sons of a cobbler. They specialised in ladies' shoes which they sold to wholesalers and retailers in Belgium. Eventually the brothers separated and in 1962 Andr\u00e9 initiated a retail outlet at the factory. This evolved into the Brantano chain of shoe shops. Brantano closed its Dutch and Danish stores in 2005, and subsequently liquidated its French stores. In 2007, Dutch holding company Macintosh Retail Group took over ownership of Brantano. In 2015, Macintosh sold the Brantano UK subsidiary to Alteri Investors. ==Subsidiaries== * Brantano Luxembourg SA, operates stores in Luxembourg. * Brimmo NV and Muys NV, operates stores in Belgium. ==References== ==External links== * *Brantano's UK website Category:Multinational companies Category:Shoe companies of Belgium Category:Retail companies established in 1962 Category:Retail companies disestablished in 2017 Category:Retail companies of Belgium Category:Companies based in East Flanders Category:Defunct companies of Belgium ",
