    "text": "National Security Law of the People's Republic of China The National Security Law of the People's Republic of China (), which was issued on July 1, 2015, is a Chinese law made up of 7 sections containing 84 articles. PRC authorities say that the law can protect national security of the PRC effectively and the media controlled by the authority praise the law, while some analysts think that the authorities can restrict Chinese people's freedom with this law. Annette Lu, the former Vice President of Taiwan, said that the law is an offense to Taiwan, and some people from Hong Kong have expressed concern about their safety while in the Mainland China after it was issued. A similar law has been taken effect in Hong Kong on July 2020 as Hong Kong national security law. == References == == External Links == * PRC Government's translation of Articles 1-24 * Inofficial translation of all Articles of the National Security Law of the PRC 2015 Category:Chinese law ",
