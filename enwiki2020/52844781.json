Teams were seeded by their CONMEBOL ranking of the Copa Libertadores (shown in parentheses), taking into account of the following three factors: #Performance in the last 10 years, taking into account Copa Libertadores results in the period 2007\u20132016 #Historical coefficient, taking into account Copa Libertadores results in the period 1960\u20132006 #Local tournament champion, with bonus points awarded to domestic league champions of the last 10 years For the first stage, the six teams were drawn into three ties (E1\u2013E3), with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+First stage draw |- !Seeded !Unseeded |- |valign=top| |valign=top| |} For the second stage, the 16 teams were drawn into eight ties (C1\u2013C8), with the seeded teams hosting the second leg. Teams from the same association could not be drawn into the same tie, excluding the winners of the first stage, which were unseeded and whose identity was not known at the time of the draw, and could be drawn into the same tie with another team from the same association. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Second stage draw |- !Seeded !Unseeded |- |valign=top| |valign=top| |} For the third stage, no draw was made, and the eight teams were allocated into the following four ties (G1\u2013G4), with the second stage winners C5\u2013C8 hosting the second leg. As the identity of the winners of the second stage was not known at the time of the draw, they could be drawn into the same tie with another team from the same association. *Second stage winner C1 vs. Second stage winner C8 *Second stage winner C2 vs. Second stage winner C7 *Second stage winner C3 vs. Second stage winner C6 *Second stage winner C4 vs. Second stage winner C5 ==Format== In the qualifying stages, each tie was played on a home-and-away two-legged basis.
