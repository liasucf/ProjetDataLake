    "text": "Table tennis at the 2019 Parapan American Games was held in Lima, Peru. The winners of all single competitions qualified for the 2020 Summer Paralympics. Matias Pino lost his medals due to a doping violation where he was found to have taken the stimulant octopamine on 24 August 2019, a banned substance in the World Anti-Doping Agency's 2019 Prohibited List. His gold medal was awarded to original silver medalist Ian Seidenfeld who also gained Pino's slot allocation for the 2020 Summer Paralympics and the results for the Chilean men's team class 6-8 led to a disqualification and their bronze medal stripped off. ==Participating nations== There will be 128 table tennis players from 19 nations competing. * * * * * * * * * * * * * * (Host country) * * * * * ==Medal table== ==Medalists== Medalists {| |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C1 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C2 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C3 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C4 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C5 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C6 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|None | |- | |- | Men's singles C7 | | | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C8 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C9 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's singles C10 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Men's team C1-2 |rowspan=2| Guilherme Costa Iranildo Espindola Aloisio Junior |rowspan=2| Luis Flores Vicente Leiva | Gregory Moreno Luis Rojas |- | Guillermo Bustamante Fernando Eberhardt |- |rowspan=2| Men's team C3-5 |rowspan=2| Cristian Gonzalez Maximiliano Rodriguez |rowspan=2| Eziquiel Babes David Freitas Welder Knaf | Roberto Quijada Noel Sandoval |- | Gabriel Copola Mauro Depergola Elias Romero |- | Men's team C6-8 | Luiz Manara Francisco Melo Paulo Salmin | Marco Makkar Ian Seidenfeld | Diego Henao Jose Vargas |- |rowspan=2| Men's team C9-10 |rowspan=2| Carlos Carbinatti Diego Moreira Claudio Moura |rowspan=2| Gustavo Castro Manuel Echaveguren | Tahl Leibovitz Randall Medcalf Jerry Vasquez |- | Julian Chinchilla Diego Jimenez Alvaro Puerto |} {| |- |rowspan=2| Women's singles C2-3 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Women's singles C4 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- | Women's singles C5 | | | colspan=2 |- | Women's singles C7 | | | |- |rowspan=2| Women's singles C8-10 |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2| | |- | |- |rowspan=2| Women's team C2-5 |rowspan=2| Joyce De Oliveira Marliane Santos Thais Severo |rowspan=2| Maria Sigala Martha Verdin | Ver\u00f3nica Blanco Maria Garrone Nayla Kuell |- | Manuela Guapi Nelly Sanchez |} ==See also== *Table tennis at the 2019 Pan American Games *Table tennis at the 2020 Summer Paralympics ==References== Category:2019 Parapan American Games Category:2019 in table tennis ",
