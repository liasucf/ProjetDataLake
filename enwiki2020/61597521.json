    "text": "Bettie Runnels (fl. 1897) was Louisiana's first female lawyer. Runnels' first exposure to the legal field was working as a stenographer for the law firm Dinkelspiel & Hart. When the state law was revised to allow women to study law, medicine and pharmacy, Runnels enrolled as the first female student in the law department of Tulane University in 1897 and graduated a year later. In the same year, Runnels became the first female registered to practice law in Louisiana. == See also == * List of first women lawyers and judges in Louisiana == References == Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing Category:Louisiana lawyers Category:American women lawyers Category:Tulane University Law School alumni Category:19th-century American lawyers Category:19th-century women lawyers ",
