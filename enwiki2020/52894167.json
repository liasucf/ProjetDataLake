During her tenure as Mayor, she cut taxes and stabilized the village's finances (which, under her predecessor's management, were criticized by the New York State Comptroller's Office). Phillips also implemented an environmental policy to expand the number of trees in the village, an effort which led the Village to be named Tree City USA by the national Arbor Day Committee. ===New York State Senator (2017-2018)=== In 2016, State Senator Jack Martins decided to run for Congress, foregoing re- election to the Senate to do so. Phillips announced that she would seek the open Senate seat and was supported by Martins. Phillips ran on a platform which included cutting taxes, combating the heroin epidemic and strengthening state ethics laws in response to corruption scandals in Albany. Phillips was unopposed for the Republican nomination. With the Seventh district being one of the most competitive districts in the state, the race was projected to be close. In the end, Phillips defeated Democrat Adam M. Haber by a 51% to 49% margin. https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2016/General/2016Senate.pdf She was sworn in on January 1, 2017.
