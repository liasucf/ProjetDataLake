She was a Newbery Honor winner. ==Biography== Born September 19, 1888, Malkus was the eleventh child out of thirteen living in Bay City, Michigan, and spent most of her time swimming and riding horses for entertainment. During high school at the age of thirteen she wrote articles for the school newspaper, she also wrote plays and enjoyed putting on productions for her neighborhood friends. Two years later, her mother was not well and had to move to San Francisco. During her trip she fell deeply in love with the desert and decided to live in New Mexico, where she spent a great deal of time with the Native Americans living in the region. This is where she developed her interest in Southwest Native Americans, Mayan ruins and other pre-Columbian civilizations which inspired most of her books. The Dark Star of Itza: The Story of a Pagan Princess was one runner-up for the 1931 Newbery Medal. == Works == * The Dark Star of Itza: The Story of a Pagan Princess, illustrated by Lowell Houser (1930) * The Spindle Imp and Other Tales of Maya Myth and Folk Lore, illus.
