    "text": "Mukilan was a Mughal warlord who attacked Venad during the reign of Umayamma Rani (1677 - 1684). The invasion is presumed to have occurred during Malayalam Era 855 (AD 1680). == Invasion of Venad == Mukilan invaded Venad through the southern borders and held Thiruvananthapuram. The Rani of Venad, was then residing at Nedumangad Koikkal. == Destruction of Budhapuram Bhaktadasa Perumal Temple == Neythasseri Potti, one of the custodians of Padmanabhaswamy Temple, had a Temple at Budhapuram in Kanyakumari District. Koopakkara Potti, another custodian of the Temple in Trivandrum, was the Tantri of Budhapuram Temple. The Presiding Deity of Budhapuram was Lord Bhaktadasa (Balarama). There was another sanctum in the Temple housing Lord Rukmininatha (Krishna flanked by Rukmini). Neythasseri Potti came to know about Mukilan's plan to attack the Temple. With the assistance of Koopakkara Potti, Neythasseri Potti shifted the idols of Lord Balarama and Lord Rukmininatha to a nearby Swamiyar Madhom. When Mukilan and his forces launched an attack on Budhapuram Temple, Nairs and Channars of the region resisted ferociously. But Mukilan emerged victorious and he plundered the Temple. Rubbing salt into the wound, he brought cows into the Temple and killed them. Later he razed this ancient Temple to the ground. ==Locking up of Padmanabhaswamy Temple== Historian P. Sankunni Menon has recorded that the Yogathil Potties, the custodians of Padmanabhaswamy Temple, and the eight Nair families of Travancore called Ettuveettil Pillamar had locked up the Temple and fled fearing caste pollution during the invasion. == Defeat of Mukilan == Umayamma Rani sought the assistance of Kerala Varma from northern Kottayam. Kerala Varma engaged Mukilan in battle at Thiruvattar as the major portion of the invading cavalry was dispersed from Varkala to Thovala to collect taxes. During the battle, according to legend, Mukilan was attacked by a swarm of bees and he lost his mount. The fallen commander was slain with arrows and slingshots. Three hundred horses and many swords and spears were captured from the defeated army by Kerala Varma. The Rani adapted him to the Venad household as Iraniyal prince in official recognition of the help rendered. Following this, Kerala Varma became the primary advisor of the Rani. == Remnants == Mukilan and his army is believed to have came through Ambasamudram and camped at Ottasekharamangalam Grama Panchayat and Manacaud. This place is believed to have been named Mukilanthara which later became Pukilanthara. There is a belief that the region in Kalkulam Taluk where the cavalry of Mukilan was stationed is Kuthirakkuzhi (Horse-hole). The place Kanjikkuzhi (Rice-gruel- hole) is believed to have been the place where his soldiers used to make rice gruel. The place from where the army was obtaining water was poisoned by the local population and hence came to be called Nanjukala. == Reference == Category:History of Kerala Category:Mughal soldiers ",
