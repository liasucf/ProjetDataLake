    "text": "Joy Ryder is the eighteenth album by saxophonist Wayne Shorter released on Columbia in 1988. ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Scott Yanow awarded the album 2 stars stating \"Wayne Shorter's occasional Columbia records of the 1980's are all disappointments. His compositions (there are seven on this out- of-print set) lacked the originality and quirkiness of his 1960's work and, although his sound was still very much intact, Shorter's improvisations tend to wander a bit aimlessly. On this album, Shorter (doubling on soprano and tenor) is joined by a basic trio (keyboardist Patrice Rushen, bassist Nathan East and drummer Terri Lyne Carrington) and such guest musicians as keyboardists Herbie Hancock and Geri Allen, bassist Darryl Jones and (on \"Someplace Called Where\") vocalist Dianne Reeves.\".Yanow, S.
