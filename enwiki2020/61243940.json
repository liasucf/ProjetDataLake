It brings together over a dozen foreign militaries to engage in the sharing of practices for multinational peacekeeping operations. In the exercise, personnel gain United Nations peacekeeper training as well as certification for support of peacekeeping operations. According to Mongolian Armed Forces Chief of Staff Tserendejidiin Byambajav, \"Khaan Quest has become one of the signature training events for the participating nations.\" Since its establishment in 2003, it has been held in the Five Hills Training Area. It only became an international exercise in 2006, originally being a joint exercise between the Mongolian Armed Forces and the U.S. Pacific Command. It is usually opened by an opening ceremony attended by the President of Mongolia. ==Gallery== File:USMC-120810-M-XK110-001.jpg|Personnel of the United States Marine Corps stand in formation next to the Military Band of the General Staff during the opening ceremony for Khaan Quest 2012.
