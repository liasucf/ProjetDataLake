His two most famous works are the boleros \"Injusta duda\" and \"Lupina\", which have been recorded by artists such as Arsenio Rodr\u00edguez and Compay Segundo, respectively. The latter was written for danzonete singer Pablo Quevedo in 1934. His repertoire included boleros, canciones, guarachas and guajiras written by himself. The height of his career took place in the 1930s and '40s in Havana, where he was the guitarist for Benny Mor\u00e9 before he joined Conjunto Matamoros to tour Mexico. In addition, he was part of several other vocal groups, collaborating with famous guarachero \u00d1ico Saquito. In March 2014, Cuban trova musicians paid homage to Gonz\u00e1lez in his hometown of Santiago. ==Works== *\"El que usted conoce no soy yo\" (guaracha) - Recorded by Sonora Matancera feat.
