    "text": "Little Baby's Ice Cream was an ice cream company based in Philadelphia. ==History== The company began in 2011, selling ice cream from tricycles. A brick and mortar location opened in August 2012. The company received national attention for a 2012 commercial, \"This is a Special Time\", in which a man apparently made of ice cream uses a spoon to consume ice cream from his own skull. (The actual substance used was marshmallow cream.) The company introduced pre-packaged ice cream pints in 2015 in containers similar to oyster pails. The company had locations in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Along with pizza restaurant Pizza Brain, the company faced harassment from Pizzagate conspiracists. In November 2019, Little Baby's permanently closed. ==Products== The company was known for its specialty flavors, including Earl Grey, Sriracha, Vanilla Cardamom Cream, and Pizza. In 2018, the company released a CBD-infused ice cream. Little Baby's had collaborated on foods with many other Philadelphia-based companies: pizza-flavored ice cream with Pizza Brain, PYNK flavored ice cream with Yards Brewing Company, and multiple collaborations with Federal Donuts. ==References== Category:2011 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Privately held companies based in Pennsylvania Category:Ice cream brands Category:Restaurants in Philadelphia ",
