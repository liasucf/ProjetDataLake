    "text": "In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, Mercer's theorem is a representation of a symmetric positive-definite function on a square as a sum of a convergent sequence of product functions. This theorem, presented in , is one of the most notable results of the work of James Mercer (1883\u20131932). It is an important theoretical tool in the theory of integral equations; it is used in the Hilbert space theory of stochastic processes, for example the Karhunen\u2013Lo\u00e8ve theorem; and it is also used to characterize a symmetric positive semi-definite kernel.http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bartlett/courses/281b-sp08/7.pdf == Introduction == To explain Mercer's theorem, we first consider an important special case; see below for a more general formulation. A kernel, in this context, is a symmetric continuous function : K: [a,b] \\times [a,b] \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R} where symmetric means that K(x, s) = K(s, x). K is said to be non-negative definite (or positive semidefinite) if and only if : \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n K(x_i, x_j) c_i c_j \\geq 0 for all finite sequences of points x1, ..., xn of [a, b] and all choices of real numbers c1, ..., cn (cf. positive-definite kernel). Associated to K is a linear operator (more specifically a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt integral operator) on functions defined by the integral : [T_K \\varphi](x) =\\int_a^b K(x,s) \\varphi(s)\\, ds. For technical considerations we assume \\varphi can range through the space L2[a, b] (see Lp space) of square-integrable real-valued functions. Since TK is a linear operator, we can talk about eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of TK. Theorem. Suppose K is a continuous symmetric non-negative definite kernel. Then there is an orthonormal basis {ei}i of L2[a, b] consisting of eigenfunctions of TK such that the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {\u03bbi}i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on [a, b] and K has the representation : K(s,t) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\lambda_j \\, e_j(s) \\, e_j(t) where the convergence is absolute and uniform. == Details == We now explain in greater detail the structure of the proof of Mercer's theorem, particularly how it relates to spectral theory of compact operators. * The map K -> TK is injective. * TK is a non-negative symmetric compact operator on L2[a,b]; moreover K(x, x) \u2265 0\\. To show compactness, show that the image of the unit ball of L2[a,b] under TK equicontinuous and apply Ascoli's theorem, to show that the image of the unit ball is relatively compact in C([a,b]) with the uniform norm and a fortiori in L2[a,b]. Now apply the spectral theorem for compact operators on Hilbert spaces to TK to show the existence of the orthonormal basis {ei}i of L2[a,b] : \\lambda_i e_i(t)= [T_K e_i](t) = \\int_a^b K(t,s) e_i(s)\\, ds. If \u03bbi \u2260 0, the eigenvector (eigenfunction) ei is seen to be continuous on [a,b]. Now : \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\lambda_i |e_i(t) e_i(s)| \\leq \\sup_{x \\in [a,b]} |K(x,x)|, which shows that the sequence : \\sum_{i=1}^\\infty \\lambda_i e_i(t) e_i(s) converges absolutely and uniformly to a kernel K0 which is easily seen to define the same operator as the kernel K. Hence K=K0 from which Mercer's theorem follows. Finally, to show non- negativity of the eigenvalues one can write \\lambda \\langle f,f \\rangle= \\langle f, T_{K}f \\rangle and expressing the right hand side as an integral well approximated by its Riemann sums, which are non-negative by positive- definiteness of K, implying \\lambda \\langle f,f \\rangle \\geq 0, implying \\lambda \\geq 0 . == Trace == The following is immediate: Theorem. Suppose K is a continuous symmetric non-negative definite kernel; TK has a sequence of nonnegative eigenvalues {\u03bbi}i. Then : \\int_a^b K(t,t)\\, dt = \\sum_i \\lambda_i. This shows that the operator TK is a trace class operator and : \\operatorname{trace}(T_K) = \\int_a^b K(t,t)\\, dt. == Generalizations == Mercer's theorem itself is a generalization of the result that any symmetric positive-semidefinite matrix is the Gramian matrix of a set of vectors. The first generalization replaces the interval [a, b] with any compact Hausdorff space and Lebesgue measure on [a, b] is replaced by a finite countably additive measure \u03bc on the Borel algebra of X whose support is X. This means that \u03bc(U) > 0 for any nonempty open subset U of X. A recent generalization replaces these conditions by the following: the set X is a first-countable topological space endowed with a Borel (complete) measure \u03bc. X is the support of \u03bc and, for all x in X, there is an open set U containing x and having finite measure. Then essentially the same result holds: Theorem. Suppose K is a continuous symmetric positive-definite kernel on X. If the function \u03ba is L1\u03bc(X), where \u03ba(x)=K(x,x), for all x in X, then there is an orthonormal set {ei}i of L2\u03bc(X) consisting of eigenfunctions of TK such that corresponding sequence of eigenvalues {\u03bbi}i is nonnegative. The eigenfunctions corresponding to non-zero eigenvalues are continuous on X and K has the representation : K(s,t) = \\sum_{j=1}^\\infty \\lambda_j \\, e_j(s) \\, e_j(t) where the convergence is absolute and uniform on compact subsets of X. The next generalization deals with representations of measurable kernels. Let (X, M, \u03bc) be a \u03c3-finite measure space. An L2 (or square-integrable) kernel on X is a function : K \\in L^2_{\\mu \\otimes \\mu}(X \\times X). L2 kernels define a bounded operator TK by the formula : \\langle T_K \\varphi, \\psi \\rangle = \\int_{X \\times X} K(y,x) \\varphi(y) \\psi(x) \\,d[\\mu \\otimes \\mu](y,x). TK is a compact operator (actually it is even a Hilbert\u2013Schmidt operator). If the kernel K is symmetric, by the spectral theorem, TK has an orthonormal basis of eigenvectors. Those eigenvectors that correspond to non-zero eigenvalues can be arranged in a sequence {ei}i (regardless of separability). Theorem. If K is a symmetric positive-definite kernel on(X, M, \u03bc), then : K(y,x) = \\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\lambda_i e_i(y) e_i(x) where the convergence in the L2 norm. Note that when continuity of the kernel is not assumed, the expansion no longer converges uniformly. ==Mercer's condition== In mathematics, a real- valued function K(x,y) is said to fulfill Mercer's condition if for all square-integrable functions g(x) one has : \\iint g(x)K(x,y)g(y)\\,dx\\,dy \\geq 0. ===Discrete analog=== This is analogous to the definition of a positive- semidefinite matrix. This is a matrix K of dimension N, which satisfies, for all vectors g, the property :(g,Kg)=g^{T}{\\cdot}Kg=\\sum_{i=1}^N\\sum_{j=1}^N\\,g_i\\,K_{ij}\\,g_j\\geq0. ===Examples=== A positive constant function :K(x, y)=c\\, satisfies Mercer's condition, as then the integral becomes by Fubini's theorem : \\iint g(x)\\,c\\,g(y)\\,dx dy = c\\int\\\\! g(x) \\,dx \\int\\\\! g(y) \\,dy = c\\left(\\int\\\\! g(x) \\,dx\\right)^2 which is indeed non-negative. == See also == * Kernel trick * Representer theorem * Spectral theory * Mercer's condition ==Notes== == References == * Adriaan Zaanen, Linear Analysis, North Holland Publishing Co., 1960, * Ferreira, J.
