    "text": "Three referendums were held simultaneously in Ireland on 7 June 2001, each on a proposed amendment of the Constitution of Ireland. Two of the measures were approved, while the third was rejected. The two successful amendments concerned the death penalty and the International Criminal Court. The failed amendment concerned the Treaty of Nice. It has also been intended to submit a fourth proposal to a referendum, concerning the investigation of judges, but this amendment was not ultimately passed by the Oireachtas (parliament) and so was never put to a vote. ==Twenty-first Amendment== The Twenty-first Amendment introduced a constitutional ban on the death penalty and removed all references to capital punishment from the text. The proposal was approved. ==Twenty-second Amendment== The Twenty-second Amendment Bill proposed to establish a body for the investigation of judges and to amend the procedure for the removal of judges. It was not passed by the houses of the Oireachtas and therefore was not submitted to a referendum. It is a \"missing amendment\" of the Constitution of Ireland. ==Twenty-third Amendment== The Twenty-third Amendment permitted the state to ratify the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The proposal was approved. ==Twenty-fourth Amendment== The Twenty-fourth Amendment Bill proposed that the state ratify the Nice Treaty of the European Union. The proposal was rejected. ==See also== *Constitutional amendment *Politics of the Republic of Ireland *History of the Republic of Ireland ==References== Category:2001 in international relations Category:2001 in Irish law Category:2001 in the European Union Category:2001 referendums Ireland 2001 Category:Death penalty law Category:June 2001 events in Europe Constitutional 2001 ",
