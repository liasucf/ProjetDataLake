    "text": "Ave Maria, Florida, United States, is a planned college town currently under development in Collier County, near Immokalee and Naples. ==History== Ave Maria, Florida is an unincorporated community that was founded in 2005 by Ave Maria Development Company, a partnership consisting of the Barron Collier Companies and the Ave Maria Foundation led by Roman Catholic philanthropist Tom Monaghan, founder of Domino's Pizza and the leader of Ave Maria University at the time. Monaghan served as chancellor of Ave Maria University until February 2011. The development of the town was made possible when the Florida legislature created the Ave Maria Stewardship Community District, a limited local government whose purpose is to provide community infrastructure, including community development systems, facilities, services, projects, and improvements. In 2015-16, it was ranked the 40th top-selling master planned community in the United States, out of 230 such communities tracked.Fletcher, June (January 12, 2016). \"Ave Maria earns top 50 spot on national ranking of master-planned communities\". Naples Daily News. ==Commerce== Ave Maria is home to various institutions and businesses. Local news is covered by a monthly print magazine, Ave Maria Neighbors, which shares stories of local families, a calendar of events, and topics of human interest in the community. == Ave Maria Oratory == Scythian performs at a festival in front of the Ave Maria Oratory with Annunciation sculpture visible in the background. The town was planned with the large Ave Maria church in the center, the facade of which displays sculptor M\u00e1rton V\u00e1r\u00f3's sculpture of the Annunciation, depicting the Archangel Gabriel greeting the Virgin Mary with the words \"Ave Maria\" (Hail Mary). V\u00e1r\u00f3's \"Good Shepherd\" sculpture is also featured inside the Oratory, also carved in marble from Cave Michelangelo in Carrara, Italy. The building serves as the home of the Ave Maria Catholic Church, part of the Diocese of Venice, which serves as the parish for local residents and students. One of the oratory's most distinctive characteristics is its steel structure, much of which is exposed internally and externally. The landmark church received an architectural award from the American Institute of Steel Construction in 2008. Monaghan has had a significant interest in architecture for more than 50 years and has been one of the world's largest collectors of the works and memorabilia of Frank Lloyd Wright. ==Ecology== Ave Maria has a severe mosquito problem and was sprayed more than 30 times via airplane with pesticides by the Collier Mosquito Control District in 2015 with organophosphates and pyrethroids, making it the most sprayed area in Southwest Florida. The Collier Mosquito Control District spokesman stated in 2012 to the Ave Maria Herald, \"The chemical used in the spraying is Naled, an organophosphate that the EPA has determined to be extremely safe\". EPA's 2006 re-registration document for Naled requires a 48-hour re-entry interval for farm workers as \"Naled can cause cholinesterase inhibition in humans\". ==References== ==External links== Category:Ave Maria University Category:Planned communities in Florida Category:Populated places established in 2007 Category:Populated places in Collier County, Florida Category:Catholic Church in Florida Category:University towns in the United States Category:2007 establishments in Florida Category:Christian communities ",
