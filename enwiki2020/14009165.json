Another big inspiration was Luis Bu\u00f1uel's film Belle de Jour. Biller used the photos as a proof-of-concept, and was able to secure the full funding to make a feature film from a private investor. The film was made slowly as they had to repeatedly pause production to raise more money. They originally budgeted for $100,000, but the final cost of the film was $750,000. Principal photography lasted from 2005 to 2007. Biller chose to star in the film herself because she \"wouldn't ask another actress to take off her clothes in the movie and do all these things with the power trip being 'I'm the director, you're the actress.'\" ==Release== Viva premiered at the 36th International Film Festival Rotterdam in 2007. It was also entered into the main competition at the 29th Moscow International Film Festival. The film had a limited theatrical release by Vagrant Films Releasing; it played at Cinema Village in New York as well as in New Orleans, Cleveland, and Los Angeles. Viva was released on DVD by Cult Epics and Anchor Bay Entertainment on Feb. 24, 2009. ==Reaction== The film has received mixed to positive reactions, and \"illustrates cinema\u2019s unique ability to blend high and low culture.\" On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 60% based on 48 reviews. Daniel Steinhart of Film Journal International wrote, \"Full of campy performances and giggle-inducing period costumes, the film may be destined for cult status.\" Lauren Horwitch of Backstage wrote, \"Biller once again proves herself to be a master multi-tasker with her new musical, Viva, which she wrote, directed, edited, designed the costumes, and stars in.\" It has been compared to the works of Russ Meyer and other sexploitation films of that era. Writing for the San Francisco Bay Guardian, Dennis Harvey listed Biller's performance in Viva as one of the year's \"best performances most likely to be overlooked\". ==References== ==External links== *Official Site * * * Category:2007 films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:American feminist films Category:2000s feminist films Category:2000s erotic drama films Category:2000s comedy-drama films Category:2000s musical comedy films Category:American comedy-drama films Category:American erotic drama films Category:2000s sex comedy films Category:American sexploitation films Category:Films set in the 1970s Category:Films about suburbia Category:Films directed by Anna Biller Category:American sex comedy films Category:2000s exploitation films Category:2007 comedy films Category:2007 drama films ",
