    "text": "Neither Blood nor Sand () is a 1941 Mexican comedy film directed by Alejandro Galindo and starring Cantinflas, Susana Gu\u00edzar and Elvia Salcedo. It was intended as a parody of the big-budget Hollywood film Blood and Sand, which portrays the world of bullfighting. It was Cantinflas' second full feature film, and its popularity cemented his rising success. He did not get on well with the film's director, but bonded with his assistant Miguel M. Delgado who became his favourite director and directed many of his films.Mora p. 53 Cantinflas rapidly followed the film with another success, The Unknown Policeman. The film's sets were designed by the art director Jorge Fernandez. ==Cast== * Cantinflas as Cantinflas / Manolete * Susana Gu\u00edzar as Anita * Elvia Salcedo as Lupita * Pedro Armend\u00e1riz as Frank * Alfredo del Diestro as Don Ram\u00f3n * Fernando Soto as Charifas * Miguel Incl\u00e1n as Jefe de Polic\u00eda * Paz Villegas as Do\u00f1a Remedios * Salvador Quiroz as Don Pancho * Arturo Soto Rangel as Juez == References == == Bibliography == * Mora, Carl J.
