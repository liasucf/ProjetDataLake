    "text": "Uprising Academy is an American esports team for the video game Overwatch competing in Overwatch Contenders (OWC) and an academy team for the Boston Uprising of the Overwatch League (OWL). The franchise played its first four seasons as Toronto Esports; shortly after being purchased by the Kraft Group, the team rebranded as Uprising Academy due to a naming rights issue with Toronto Defiant. The team is based in Boston, Massachusetts and plays in the North America East region of OWC. == Franchise history == === 2016\u20132018: Toronto Esports === Toronto Esports Club, a multi-game esports organization, announced their intention to enter the competitive Overwatch scene under the name Toronto Esports on August 6 with the hiring of Chris \"HuK\" Loranger as the team's Overwatch consultant manager; a month later, the club announced their first professional Overwatch roster. Toronto Esports competed in North America Contenders 2017 Season 0, but failed to qualify for 2017 Season 1. On February 19, 2018, Uprising announced that Toronto Esports would be competing as Boston's academy team in Contenders for 2018 Season 1. In their first season as an affiliate team, Toronto made it to the North America Grand Finals, where the team fell 1\u20134 to Fusion University. The team again qualified for the playoffs in 2018 Season 2, where they faced Fusion University in the quarterfinals; although the match was closer than their Grand Finals match the previous season, Toronto lost 2\u20133. In November 2018, Blizzard Entertainment informed Toronto Esports Club that the team must drop the word \"Toronto\" from its Overwatch team brand, as the new Overwatch League expansion team Toronto Defiant had \"exclusive naming rights\" in the city. The club responded by attempting to disband their Overwatch team altogether, posting on Twitter, However, Loranger clarified that the Kraft organization still owned all the rights to the players, coaches, and the Contenders slot held by the team and would continue to compete in Contenders, albeit under a new brand. === 2018\u2013present: Uprising Academy === On November 28, 2018, the team officially announced that they would be competing under the name Uprising Academy. In 2018 Season 3, Uprising qualified for the playoffs, but fell to XL2 Academy in the quarterfinals. The team did not qualify for the playoffs the following season, posting a 1\u20136 record, and marking the first time they failed to qualify for the playoffs since becoming an OWL affiliate team. In 2019 Season 2, Uprising Academy finished the regular season with a 5\u20132 record to qualify for the NA East regional playoffs. However, the team fell to the Gladiators Legion in the NA East quarterfinals match. == Seasons overview == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | Year ! rowspan=\"2\" | Season ! rowspan=\"2\" | Region ! colspan=\"4\" | OWC regular season ! rowspan=\"2\" | Regional playoffs ! rowspan=\"2\" | Interregional events |- !
