    "text": "\"Gold Dust Woman\" is a song from the best-selling Fleetwood Mac album Rumours. It was written and sung by Stevie Nicks and released as a B-side to the \"Don't Stop\" single (in the UK) and the \"You Make Loving Fun\" single (in the US). The 2004 two-disc special edition release of Rumours includes two demos of \"Gold Dust Woman\". One demo features vocal melody and lyrics in the coda which would later be developed into the stand-alone single \"If You Ever Did Believe\" in 1997, which Nicks recorded with Sheryl Crow as part of the early sessions for her Trouble in Shangri-La album. The track was instead chosen as the theme song for the 1998 Warner Bros. film Practical Magic and is only available on the film's soundtrack album. ==Background== The take chosen for release on the 1977 Rumours album was reportedly recorded at 4 a.m., after a long night of attempts in the studio. Just before and during that final take, Stevie Nicks had wrapped her head (though not mouth) with a black scarf, veiling her senses and tapping genuine memories and emotions. Many unusual instruments were used in the recording, including an electric harpsichord with a jet phaser, which was marked with tape so Mick Fleetwood could play the right notes. To accentuate Stevie's vocals, Mick broke sheets of glass. According to producer Ken Caillat \"He was wearing goggles and coveralls \u2014 it was pretty funny. He just went mad, bashing glass with this big hammer. He tried to do it on cue, but it was difficult. Eventually, we said, \u2018Just break the glass,\u2019 and we fit it all in.\" Slant critic Barry Walsh described the song as finding Nicks \"at her folky (not flaky) best with one of her most poignant character studies\". ==Interpretations== When asked about the song in an interview with Courtney Love for Spin in October 1997, Nicks confirmed that \"gold dust\" was a metaphor for cocaine. In an interview for VH1's Classic Album series, Nicks offered further insight into the song's meaning: ==Personnel== *Stevie Nicks \u2013 lead vocals *Lindsey Buckingham \u2013 guitars, dobro, backing vocals *Mick Fleetwood \u2013 drums, cowbell, electric harpsichord (processed), sound effects *Christine McVie \u2013 Fender Rhodes, backing vocals *John McVie \u2013 bass guitar ==Cover version by Hole== A cover version by American alternative rock band Hole was released on Geffen Records in 1996 as their ninth CD single. It was also featured on the soundtrack to The Crow: City of Angels and was produced by Ric Ocasek of The Cars. {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !Chart (1996) (Hole version) !Peak Position |- | Australia (ARIA) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|87 |- | US Billboard Modern Rock Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|31 |} ==References== ==External links== *The Penguin: GDW Lyric Interpretations * Category:Fleetwood Mac songs Category:Hole (band) songs Category:1977 songs Category:1996 singles Category:Songs written by Stevie Nicks Category:Song recordings produced by Ken Caillat Category:Song recordings produced by Richard Dashut Category:Songs about drugs Category:Geffen Records singles Category:Warner Records singles ",
