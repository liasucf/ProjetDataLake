    "text": "Medusa is the second studio album by English hard rock band Trapeze. Recorded in 1970 at Morgan Studios, it was produced by The Moody Blues bassist John Lodge and released in November 1970 by Threshold Records. The album was preceded by the release of the single \"Black Cloud\" in 1970. ==Background== Following the release of Trapeze's self-titled debut album Trapeze in early 1970, lead vocalist John Jones and keyboardist Terry Rowley left the band, leaving guitarist Mel Galley, bassist Glenn Hughes and drummer Dave Holland to continue as a trio. Four of the seven songs on Medusa were written by Galley and his brother Tom, two were written by Hughes, and one was written by the trio. ==Re-recording== The album's title track was re-recorded by Glenn Hughes in 2010 with Black Country Communion on their self-titled debut album. ==Reception== Critical reception for Medusa was generally positive. A review published on AllMusic awarded the album four and a half out of five stars, with writer Jason Anderson describing the album as \"the finest offering from '70s outfit Trapeze\" and \"one of the decade's most underappreciated hard rock recordings\". Anderson praised Hughes's \"soulful vocal delivery\" and Galley's \"catchy and affective\" guitar performance, concluding that \"it's a wonder that the record isn't mentioned more when influential albums of this era are discussed\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ;Primary personnel *Mel Galley \u2013 guitar, vocals *Glenn Hughes \u2013 bass, piano, vocals *Dave Holland \u2013 drums *John Lodge \u2013 production ;Additional personnel *Roger Quested \u2013 engineering *Pat Travers \u2013 illustration *David Rohl \u2013 photography ==References== Category:1970 albums Category:Trapeze (band) albums Category:Threshold Records albums Category:Universal Records albums ",
