    "text": "Bis-GMA (bisphenol A-glycidyl methacrylate) is a resin commonly used in dental composite, dental sealants. and dental cement. It is the diester derived from methacrylic acid and the bisphenol A diglycidyl ether. Bearing two polymerizable groups, it is prone to form a crosslinked polymer that is used in dental restorations. For dental work, bis-GMA is mixed with aluminosilicate particles, crushed quartz and other related acrylates. Bis-GMA was incorporated into composite dental resins in 1962 by Rafael Bowen. ==Safety== Concerns have been raised about the potential for bis-GMA to break down into or be contaminated with the related compound bisphenol A. However, no negative health effects of bis-GMA use in dental resins have been found. ==Composition== Salivary esterases can slowly degrade bis-GMA-based sealants, forming Bis-HPPP. ==References== Category:Dental materials Category:2,2-Bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanes Category:Enones ",
