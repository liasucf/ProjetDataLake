It lies between Crieff and Loch Turret, north of the A85. ==History== The estate was the subject of a violent blood feud between the Murray clan and Drummond clan in the neighbourhood in the late 1400s. The Murrays of Ochtertyre had been engaged by their relative, the abbot of nearby Inchaffray Abbey, with collecting teinds from the Drummonds of Monzievaird. They did this with such brutality that the Drummonds were provoked into retaliation. They went to Ochtertyre and tried to evict the Murrays from their land. The conflict led to the Battle of Knock Mary, which the Murrays lost, and the subsequent Massacre of Monzievaird. The episode was captured by the historical novelist Walter Scott in his book A Legend of Montrose. Members of the Murray family living here included William Murray of Ochtertyre and his son Patrick Murray of Ochtertyre. The estate was sold by the Murrays to the Dundas family in the early 19th century. Robert Burns visited Sir William Murray at Ochtertyre on his third northern tour with Nicol. The house is a category A listed Georgian building dating from 1784\u20131790. Its architect is unknown. The house bought by the wealthy Dundas family in 1812 and its inhabitants included: * George Dundas, Lord Manor * Captain James Dundas, who won the Victoria Cross for his actions in Afghanistan in 1879 * David Dundas, Lord Dundas * William John Dundas, FRSE. From 1939 to 1965 the house served as a school. It is now partly used as a restaurant. ==Architecture== A family mausoleum was added in 1809, remote from the main house, designed by Charles Heathcote Tatham.Oxford Dictionary of Architects: Charles Tatham ==References== Category:Villages in Perth and Kinross ",
