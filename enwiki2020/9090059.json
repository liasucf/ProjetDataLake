    "text": "Basilica of Sant'Andrea at Vercelli. Thomas Gallus of Vercelli (ca.1200 \u2013 1246), sometimes in early twentieth century texts called Thomas of St Victor, Thomas of Vercelli or Thomas Vercellensis, was a French theologian, a member of the School of St Victor. He is known for his commentaries on Pseudo- Dionysius and his ideas on affective theology. His elaborate mystical schemata influenced Bonaventure and The Cloud of Unknowing. ==Life== Born in France sometime in the late twelfth century, Thomas Gallus departed in 1219 from Paris, where he lectured in the university, and went to Vercelli in the north of Italy, along with two companions, to establish a new monastery there. This monastery was set up under the initiative of Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, once a papal legate to England and France. Moreover, Bicchieri was a native of Vercelli and wished to establish a monastery and hospital in his home town. By the end of 1225 or the start of 1226, Thomas was appointed abbot of the new monastery. As abbot, he devoted himself not just to the daily administrative tasks of the monastery, but also to composing various commentaries and expositions of the Bible and the writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius. He enjoyed a close relationship with the nascent Franciscan order; indeed, the Franciscans transferred their studium generale from Padua to Vercelli around 1228. He was personally acquainted with St Anthony of Padua. Gallus also knew Robert Grosseteste whom he may have met in 1238 when visiting England to secure a benefice associated with the church of St. Andrew's in Chesterton. Gallus and Grosseteste seem to have exchanged some writings through the agency of Grosseteste's associate, the Franciscan Adam Marsh. When war broke out between the Guelphs of Vercelli and the Ghibellines of the neighbouring town of Ivrea, Gallus was compelled to flee Vercelli in 1243 and take refuge in Ivrea after many grave accusations were made against him by the papal supporters. Some records however suggest that he did manage to return to Vercelli before his death in 1246. A funerary monument to Gallus can be seen today in the Church of Sant\u2019Andrea in Vercelli. ==Thought__NOTOC__== Gallus wrote extensively between about 1218 and his death. Thomas Gallus's interpretation of pseudo-Dionysius has in recent years been presented as one of two traditions of interpretation of Dionysius that emerged in the thirteenth century, with a 'speculative Dionysianism' developed by the Dominican Albert the Great, and an 'affective Dionysianism' first given systematic formulation in Gallus's interpretation of pseudo-Dionysius, but with great influence on later vernacular mystical writing.By Paul Rorem, Pseudo-Dionysius, (1993). See also Bernard McGinn, 'Thomas Gallus and Dionysian Mysticism', Studies in Spirituality, 8, (1998), pp.81\u201396. Specifically, this refers to the fact that in the contemporary debate on the relation between love and knowledge in mystical consciousness, Gallus held that affectivity tends to exclude (rather than simply subsume) human knowledge in the highest stages of the mystical itinerary.Bernard McGinn, 'Thomas Gallus and Dionysian Mysticism', Studies in Spirituality, 8, (1998), pp.81\u201396. ==Works on Pseudo-Dionysius== *1224: Glose super angelica ierarchia (Glosses on the Angelic Hierarchy).The Latin text is in D. Lawell (ed.): Thomas Gallus, Glose super angelica ierarchia. Accedunt indices ad Thomae Galli Opera, Corpus Christianorum Continuatio Mediaevalis, vol. 223A (Turnhout: Brepols, 2011). *Before 1233: glosses on all four of Dionysius' works and two of the ten letters, made using the Latin translation of Dionysius by John Sarrazin.
