As a young woman she dropped out of college and joined a group of eco-terrorists, of whom Patrick was the leader. Angie fell in love with Patrick, and he used this to his advantage in order to get her to build a bomb.

Gaby shows up at Angie's wanting a recipe for lasagna and meets Patrick who introduces himself as Angie's brother. Later, Patrick tricks Danny into returning home by sending him a message from Angie's phone. Patrick ties him up and tells him he wants to have a father/son relationship. He also uses the threat of killing Danny to get Angie to build the bomb. While she's building the bomb, Gaby shows up with a pan of lasagna that she wants Angie to try. Angie takes it to get a piece and hides a note inside the pan. Gaby takes it back and throws it in the trash without finding the note. Gaby gets up in the middle of the night and finds Juanita and Celia eating the lasagna out of the trash and Celia spits out the note, which is actually still legible: \"Danny and I held hostage. No cops. Get Nick\". Susan continues on her mission to sort out Mike's finances. She discovers that almost half of his clients haven\u2019t settled their bills, so she decides she's going to get them to pay up.

However, when this doesn't work, Susan begins to threaten the clients into paying up, taking not only money, but possessions as payment for Mike's work. She gets the money but there's more bad news \u2013 the IRS is knocking on the door. Susan tries to bully the IRS agent, but gets more penalties instead of an extension. They decide to leave Wisteria Lane and rent out their house. Orson, Bree and Andrew are brainstorming ways to get rid of Sam. Orson suggests that Andrew should seduce him. Since Orson feels he\u2019d be useless in a fight, he suggests they pay Sam off. Bree gives him the check, but Sam tears it up when she tells him he's not really part of the family. He also vaguely threatens her. In retaliation, Bree brings in a couple of retired police officers \u2013 big retired police officers to intimidate him, while having tea and scones.
