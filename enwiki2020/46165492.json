    "text": "HuniePop is a tile-matching and dating sim adult video game created by American game designer Ryan Koons, under the alias of HuniePot. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux-based personal computers in January 2015, after being funded via a successful Kickstarter campaign. HuniePop is available in two different versions, an uncensored version available via Humble Bundle and MangaGamer, and a censored version via Steam. The game follows the dating adventures of the main character as he or she tries to woo several different women in their home town. In February 2015, Koons released an update that gave HuniePop a new ending that unlocks options that make it easier for players to fill out a female character's profile and select date locations, among other options. Due to its strong sexual content and themes, Twitch blocked users from streaming gameplay footage of the title, regardless of which version of the game was being played. ==Gameplay== tennis court. Gameplay focuses on the player character (who can be male or female) interacting with several different women, each of whom has her own distinct personalities and preferences. The player can interact with women by talking to them and giving them gifts. Doing this rewards the player with \"Hunie\", an in-game currency that can be used to upgrade the player's stats. These stats allow the player to earn more points during dates, increasing their chance of success. In order to progress through the game, players must take the women on dates, where they will play a tile matching game where they must make matches of 3 or more of the same tokens. The player must earn enough points to complete the date before they run out of moves. Each woman has a specific type of token that they like and dislike, and players will gain more points if they match the type of token that the woman prefers. The player can also use special items called \"date gifts\" during their dates which grant positive effects to help the player earn more points. After a successful date, the player is rewarded with a picture of the woman the date was with. Each successful date will also raise the game's difficulty, making subsequent dates require more points to complete. After 3 successful dates with a woman, the player will be able to take them on a date at night, and if that date is successful, the player can bring the woman to their bedroom for one final round of tile matching (and, if this is successful, have sexual intercourse with her). Unlike regular dates, the player has unlimited moves to complete the bedroom game, but the score meter constantly drains over time, so to win, matches must be made quickly until the meter is full. Throughout the game the player is guided by Kyu, a love fairy set on turning the player into a successful Lothario. She gives the player tips on how to interact with each woman and explains how the game's various mechanics work. She also becomes dateable after one bedroom game. ==Development== A Kickstarter campaign was launched with a minimum funding goal of $20,000. The Kickstarter ended successfully, raising $53,536 from 1,483 backers. ==Reception== HuniePop has received positive reception. Hardcore Gamer gave the game a rating of four out of five, writing \"HuniePop is pornography\u2014darn fine pornography at that\u2014but it\u2019s also a shockingly good puzzle game. Occasionally those two identities feel at odds with each other, but for the most part they work in concert to show you a good time.\" Kotaku also gave a mostly positive review, praising it for being \"strategically deep and challenging enough to kick a Candy Crush casual's ass\" while also commenting that the game lacked a \"strong finish\". GameZone's Mike Splechta called the game \"fun and engaging\". Destructoid criticized the game's conversations as lacking in variety while stating that \"In the end, I realize this is a game that, while riddled with issues, I liked a lot. A whole lot. In fact, with better writing and some more care given to the characters to flesh them out, it could be so much more.\" ==Legacy== Since HuniePop's release, there have been other games inspired by it, such as Front Wing's Purino Party. On April 4, 2016, Koons released a spin-off game called HunieCam Studio. HunieCam Studio is an adult themed business simulation game, and features many of the characters who previously appeared in HuniePop. The game's art style also shifted to a more cartoon style, away from the anime- based art. Kotaku gave HunieCam Studio a mixed review, commenting that although the game's text was occasionally entertaining, they found the overall game experience to be \"extremely boring\". A sequel, HuniePop 2: Double Date, is in production. It is a sequel to HuniePop with the player controlling the same protagonist, and will feature returning characters from HuniePop and HunieCam Studio. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2015 video games Category:Crowdfunded video games Category:Dating sims Category:Erotic video games Category:Kickstarter-funded video games Category:Linux games Category:Match 3 games Category:MacOS games Category:Puzzle video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games featuring protagonists of selectable gender Category:Windows games Category:Yuri (genre) video games Category:Unity (game engine) games Category:Single-player video games ",
