    "text": "Florence is an unincorporated community in Snohomish County, in the U.S. state of Washington. ==History== A post office called Florence was established in 1884, and remained in operation until 1949. The community was platted in 1866 and named after the love interest of an early postmaster. During its heyday, Florence had several hotels, bars and restaurants, as well as a stagecoach line and dock for sternwheelers. Florence eventually lost out to nearby Stanwood as the area's main center of commerce. ==References== Category:Unincorporated communities in Snohomish County, Washington Category:Unincorporated communities in Washington (state) ",
