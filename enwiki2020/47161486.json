    "text": "The Batesville Commercial Historic District encompasses about four city blocks of the historic downtown of Batesville, Arkansas. This area's current appearance is largely the result of development between about 1880 and the 1940s, although it includes a portion of Arkansas' oldest platted Main Street, dating to 1821. When originally listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982, the district included 25 historic properties on two blocks of Main Street, on either side of Central Avenue, as well as a few properties on Central. In 1990 the size of the district was more than doubled, adding two more city blocks on Main Street and 36 buildings. Most of the buildings are brick and masonry commercial structures, two stories in height, with party walls joining them at the sides. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Independence County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Italianate architecture in Arkansas Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Arkansas Category:Art Deco architecture in Arkansas Category:Geography of Independence County, Arkansas Category:Historic districts on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Independence County, Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures in Batesville, Arkansas ",
