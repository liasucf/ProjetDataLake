It is an example of Seljuk architecture. The minaret was built around 1112 AD (in the 6th century AH) by the order of \"Taj-o-dowleh Ab-ol-ghasem-ebn-e-saeed\" during the time of Saljoughian, and is almost in height. On top of the tower are tablets in the kufic script, and diamond decorations. At the time of its construction it was one of the tallest spires in Iran. It was registered as national treasure of Iran in 1932. According to archeological researches, the tower is a free-standing spire which was built as a path-finding guide for caravans along the path to Abrisham, and served as guide for caravans. ==See also== *List of historical Iranian architects ==Further reading== *http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iranian_Architecture ==References== *Arthur Upham Pope, Persian Architecture, 1965, New York, p. 16 ==External links== *Khosrogerd Minaret at Iran Touring and Tourism Online Category:Minarets in Iran Category:Seljuk architecture Category:Sabzevar County Category:Buildings and structures in Razavi Khorasan Province Category:Tourist attractions in Razavi Khorasan Province ",
