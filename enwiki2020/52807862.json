The nave was probably rebuilt in 1682 as this date is carved on a stone in the east wall outside. In 1870 the gallery in the nave was removed, and oak benches installed in place of the wooden pews. The floor was paved throughout and the aisles and chancel laid with Minton encaustic tiles. Choir stalls were built and a new altar table and altar rails provided. This restoration was funded by the rector, Rt. Revd. Bishop Edmund Hobhouse and executed by the contractor Mr. Thorley of Ellastone. The church reopened on 28 October 1870. On 25 July 1900, the cornerstone was laid for a major restoration by the architect E. Arden Minty, FRIBA, of 39 Victoria Street, Westminster the brother of the rector at the time, and the builder William Gould of Tutbury. In 1906, when the Rev. F. Arden Minty was walking to the altar, the floor suddenly gave way beneath him, but he managed to avoid falling into the hole. It was subsequently found that the arch of a large vault below the chancel had collapsed. ==Parish status== The church is in a joint parish with *All Saints' Church, Brailsford *St Martin's Church, Osmaston *St Michael's Church, Shirley *Holy Trinity Church, Yeaveley ==References== Edlaston Edlaston ",
