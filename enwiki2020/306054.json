    "text": "The Army National Guard (ARNG), in conjunction with the Air National Guard, is an organized militia force and a federal military reserve force of the United States Army. They are simultaneously part of two different organizations: the Army National Guard of each state, most territories, and the District of Columbia (also referred to as the Militia of the United States), and the Army National Guard of the United States (as part of the United States National Guard). The Army National Guard is divided into subordinate units stationed in each U.S. state and territory, as well the District of Columbia, operating under their respective governors and governor-equivalents.Military Reserves Federal Call Up Authority The foundation for what became the Army National Guard occurred in the city of Salem, Massachusetts, in 1692, the first time that a regiment of militia drilled for the common defense of a multi-community area. ==Activation== The Army National Guard as currently authorized and organized operates under Title 10 of the United States Code when under federal control, and Title 32 of the United States Code and applicable state laws when under state control. The Army National Guard may be called up for active duty by the state or territorial governors to help respond to domestic emergencies and disasters, such as those caused by hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes, as well as civil disorder. The District of Columbia Army National Guard is a federal militia, controlled by the President of the United States with authority delegated to the Secretary of Defense, and through him to the Secretary of the Army.National Archives and Records Administration, Executive Order 11485\u2014Supervision and control of the National Guard of the District of Columbia, 1 October 1969 Members or units of the Army National Guard may be ordered, temporarily or indefinitely, into the service of the United States.10 USC 12211. Officers: Army National Guard of the United States10 USC 12107. Army National Guard of United States; Air National Guard of the United States: enlistment in If mobilized for federal service, the member or unit becomes part of the Army National Guard of the United States, which is a reserve component of the United States Army.32 USC 101. Definitions (NATIONAL GUARD)10 USC 12401. Army and Air National Guard of the United States: status10 USC 10105. Army National Guard of the United States: composition Individuals volunteering for active federal service may do so subject to the consent of their governors.North Atlantic Treaty organization, Fact Sheet, National Reserve Forces Status: United States of America, 2006, p. 1 Governors generally cannot veto involuntary activations of individuals or units for federal service, either for training or national emergency.National Guard Bureau, Today in Guard History (June), 11 June 1990, 2013 (See Perpich v. Department of Defense.) The President may also call up members and units of the Army National Guard, in its status as the militia of the several states, to repel invasion, suppress rebellion, or enforce federal laws.10 USC 12406. National Guard in Federal service: call The Army National Guard of the United States is one of two organizations administered by the National Guard Bureau, the other being the Air National Guard of the United States. The Director of the Army National Guard is the head of the organization, and reports to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau. Because the Army National Guard is both the militia of the several states and a federal reserve component of the Army, neither the Chief of the National Guard Bureau nor the Director of the Army National Guard \"commands\" it. This operational command authority is performed in each state or territory by the State Adjutant General, and in the District of Columbia by the Commanding General of the District of Columbia National Guard when a unit is in its militia status. While under federal activation, the operational command authority is transferred to the commanders of the unified combatant commands, who command all U.S. forces within their area of responsibility. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau and the Director of the Army National Guard serve as the channel of communications between the Department of the Army and the Army National Guard in each state and territory, and administer federal programs, policies, and resources for the National Guard.Cornell University, legal Information Institute, 10 USC \u00a7 10503 \u2013 Functions of National Guard Bureau: Charter, accessed 20 June 2013 The Army National Guard's portion of the president's proposed federal budget for Fiscal Year 2018 is approximately $16.2 billion to support an end strength of 343,000, including appropriations for personnel pay and allowance, facilities maintenance, construction, equipment maintenance and other activities. ==History== ARNG recruits arriving at Fort Jackson for BCT ==Prominent members== === U.S. Presidents === Of the 44 individuals to serve as President of the United States as of 2017, 33 had military experience.

Each were headed by a major general who reported to the chief of the National Guard Bureau. The head of the Army National Guard was originally established as the chief of the Army Division at the National Guard Bureau. The position was downgraded to brigadier general in 1962 due to force reduction. It was renamed to Director of the Army National Guard and elevated back to major general in 1970. The position was later elevated to the rank of lieutenant general in 2001. The Army National Guard is also authorized a deputy director which was originally established as a brigadier general office in 1970. It was elevated to the rank of major general in 2006.
