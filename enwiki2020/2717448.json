In 1860, the Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860 called for the facilitation of communication between the east and west coasts of the United States of America. Hiram Sibley of the Western Union Telegraph Company won the contract. In 1861, Benjamin Franklin Ficklin joined Hiram Sibley in helping to form the Pacific Telegraph Company of Nebraska. At the same time, Jeptha Wade was asked by Hiram Sibley to consolidate smaller telegraph companies in California. While the Pacific Telegraph Company built west from Omaha, Nebraska, the Overland Telegraph Company of California was thus formed and built east from Carson City, Nevada. With their connection in Salt Lake City, Utah on October 24, 1861, the final link between the east and west coasts of the United States of America was made by telegraph. The First Transcontinental Telegraph led to the immediate demise of the Pony Express. The Pacific Telegraph Company and Overland Telegraph Company of California were eventually absorbed into the Western Union Telegraph Company. Edward Creighton managed construction for Pacific Telegraph, which started in Omaha on 4 July 1861, and simultaneously from Salt Lake a week later. Creighton reached Salt Lake first allowing Brigham Young to send an east bound telegram on 18 Oct. ==References== ==External links== * Central Pacific Railroad Photographic History Museum: Pacific Telegraph Act of 1860 * Contemporary account of the construction of the transcontinental telegraph * History of the first transcontinental telegraph Category:Western Union Category:History of telecommunications in the United States Category:Pioneer history of Omaha, Nebraska Category:Telegraph companies of the United States Category:American companies established in 1861 Category:Telecommunications companies established in 1861 Category:1861 establishments in the United States Category:Defunct telecommunications companies of the United States ",
