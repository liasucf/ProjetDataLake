Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, McLachlan appeared in around 20 film and television projects, including the American movie Superfire, as Stuart Diver in the television film Heroes' Mountain, and Blackjack with Colin Friels. In 2004 he played Michael Chamberlain in Through My Eyes, an account of the Lindy Chamberlain story, and began work in the recurring role of Kane Morgan in McLeod's Daughters. He played Jeff Kennard in the Australian film Hating Alison Ashley, worked alongside Benjamin Bratt and James Franco in The Great Raid, and starred with John Jarratt in Savages Crossing, for which he composed the score.

In 2011 McLachlan had a guest-starring role in an episode of NCIS Los Angeles. In 2011, British group Rizzle Kicks sampled McLachlan's version of \"Mona\" for their single \"Mama Do the Hump\", which peaked at number two on the UK Singles Chart. McLachlan returned to Australia in 2012 to work on a new TV series, The Doctor Blake Mysteries, a period crime drama set in Ballarat in 1959\u201360. He plays the titular role of Dr Lucien Blake, a medical practitioner with a knack for solving murders and annoying the police. The first two seasons originally screened on ABC Television in 2013 and 2014. In 2013, McLachlan was again cast as Frank N Furter in a revival of The Rocky Horror Show touring Australia in 2014. In December 2014, McLachlan revealed that he was unable to return to Neighbours for the show's 30th anniversary celebrations owing to scheduling conflicts and his involvement in The Doctor Blake Mysteries. However, McLachlan agreed to take part in the documentary special Neighbours 30th: The Stars Reunite, which aired in Australia and the UK in March 2015. In 2016, McLachlan appeared in the sci-fi thriller Restoration, playing Andrew Majury.

He has a child from his relationship with British actress and voice artist Charlotte Avery. McLachlan was briefly married to Karen Williams ()\u2014they had attended the same secondary school\u2014and subsequently to Neighbours actress Rachel Friend (1998\u201399). ===Sexual harassment allegations === On 8 January 2018, a joint investigation by Fairfax Media and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) reported that McLachlan had been accused of sexual harassment by several actresses during his performing career. Three actresses from the 2014 Australian production of The Rocky Horror Show\u2014Christie Whelan Browne, Erika Heynatz and Angela Scundi\u2014have alleged that they were abused, harassed or assaulted by McLachlan; he responded, \"Frankly, they seem to be simple inventions, perhaps made for financial reasons, perhaps to gain notoriety. In either event, they are to the best of my knowledge utterly and entirely false.\" McLachlan subsequently left the 2018 production of The Rocky Horror Show. Victoria Police also announced that they are investigating complaints from two of the women. McLachlan filed defamation suits against the ABC and Fairfax Media in February 2018; he also named Whelan Browne in a defamation suit. Producers of The Doctor Blake Mysteries announced that production would be temporarily suspended pending the outcome of investigations. The production company, December Media, \"cleared the actor of any misconduct\" during the show's run. In April it was announced that he would not be returning to the series, which was to be rebranded as The Blake Mysteries and continue without the titular character. After a single telemovie in this format (titled The Blake Mysteries: A New Beginning) aired on 30 November 2018, producers ruled out making any further Blake telemovies in 2019. McLachlan's defamation case was due to be heard in the Supreme Court of New South Wales from 4 February 2019; however, the suit was postponed hearing pending the outcome of the related criminal proceedings. On 11 January 2019 Victoria Police charged him with one count of common assault, eight counts of indecent assault and one count of attempted indecent assault. He had been summoned to appear at Melbourne Magistrates' Court on 8 February 2019. At a hearing in April, McLachlan was told by the magistrate that one of the indecent assault charges had been dropped by the prosecutor and that he would not face a jury trial but that matters would be determined by the lone magistrate. In November 2019 a contested hearing of the charges began. ==Discography== ===Studio albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"4\" | Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Certification |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | NDL ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | NZ ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | UK |- ! scope=\"row\" | Craig McLachlan & Check 1-2 | * Released: 1990 * Label: Epic Records |align=\"center\"| 4 |align=\"center\"| 88 |align=\"center\"| 49 |align=\"center\"| 10 | * ARIA: Gold |- ! scope=\"row\" | Hands Free | * Released: 1992 * Label: Epic Records |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\" | Craig McLachlan & The Culprits | * Released: 1996 * Label: Roadrunner Records |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 | |- |} ===Musical albums=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" | Album details ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"2\" | Peak chart positions |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | AUS ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\" | UK |- ! scope=\"row\" | Grease (Original London Stage Cast Soundtrack) | * Released: 1993 * Label: Epic Records |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| 20 |- ! scope=\"row\" | The Rocky Horror Show (Australian Cast Recording) | * Released: 1995 * Label: TriStar Music |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |align=\"center\"| \u2014 |- |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:26em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"7\"| Peak chart positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album ! rowspan=\"2\"| Certification |- style=\"font-size:small;\" ! style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| AUS Australian (ARIA Chart) peaks: * Top 50 peaks: * Top 100 peaks: * \"I Almost Felt Like Crying\": !style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| BEL !style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| GER !style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| IRE !style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| NED !style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| NZ !style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%\"| UK |- | rowspan=\"1\"| 1989 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Rock the Rock\" (as Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132) | 36 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |rowspan=4 style=\"text- align:left;\"|Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132 | |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 1990 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mona\" (as Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132) | 3 | 8 | 44 | 5 | 26 | 16 | 2 | * ARIA: Platinum |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Amanda\" (as Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132) | 24 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 16 | \u2014 | 22 | 19 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Almost Felt Like Crying\" (as Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132) | 103 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 50 | |- | rowspan=\"1\"| 1991 ! scope=\"row\"| \"On My Own\" | 23 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 59 |rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:left;\"|Hands Free | |- | rowspan=\"3\"| 1992 ! scope=\"row\"| \"One Reason Why\" | 57 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 29 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Hear You Knocking\" | 90 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Time Warp\" (with Australian cast) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |rowspan=1 style=\"text-align:left;\"|The Rocky Horror Show Cast Recording | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1993 ! scope=\"row\"| \"You're the One That I Want\" (duet with Deborah Gibson) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 24 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 13 |rowspan=2 style=\"text- align:left;\"|Grease Cast Recording | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Grease\" | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 44 | |- | rowspan=\"2\"| 1995 ! scope=\"row\"| \"If We Were Angels\" (as Craig McLachlan & The Culprits) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 |rowspan=3 style=\"text-align:left;\"|Craig McLachlan & The Culprits | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Everyday\" (as Craig McLachlan & The Culprits) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | 65 | |- | 1996 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Hear the World Cry\" (as Craig McLachlan & The Culprits) | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | \u2014 | |- |} ===Videos=== *Craig McLachlan & Check 1\u20132: The Video (featured an interview and the video clips for \"Mona\", \"Amanda\", \"Rock the Rock\" and \"I Almost Felt Like Crying\") (1990) ==Filmography== ===Film=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
