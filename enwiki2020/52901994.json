Heitman was born in Boulder, Western Australia, to Lillian Caroline (n\u00e9e Pascoe) and Herman Albert Heitman. He worked as a farm labourer in Morawa after leaving school, and eventually bought his own property there, where he established a sheep stud. He also owned a farm in Meekatharra. Heitman served on the Morawa Road Board from 1939 to 1940 and again from 1945 to 1961, including as chairman from 1950 to 1952. He entered parliament at a 1963 Legislative Council by-election for Midland Province, caused by the death of Charles Simpson. Heitman transferred to Upper West Province at the 1965 state election, and was re-elected in 1971. He did not contest the 1977 election, but died in office a month before his term ended. Heitman had married Adela Elizabeth Yewers in 1934, with whom he had four children.Jack Heitman, Biographical Register of Members of the Parliament of Western Australia.
