    "text": "ERx is a putative membrane estrogen receptor (mER) of which little is currently known. It was discovered as a gene transcription signature induced by estradiol that is independent of the ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 and GPER and was identified using the membrane-impermeable estradiol conjugate E2-BSA in the absence or presence of the ER\u03b1/ER\u03b2 antagonist fulvestrant (ICI-182,780) and the GPER antagonist G-15. ==See also== * ER-X * GPER (GPR30) * Gq-mER * Estrogen receptor ==References== Category:Human proteins Category:Transmembrane receptors ",
