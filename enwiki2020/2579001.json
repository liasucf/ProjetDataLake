    "text": "Lady Tatiana Helen Georgia Mountbatten (born 16 April 1990) is an English equestrian. ==Biography== Lady Tatiana was born on 16 April 1990 to George Mountbatten, 4th Marquess of Milford Haven and his wife, Sarah Georgina (n\u00e9e Walker). She is an older sister of Henry Mountbatten, Earl of Medina. Her paternal great-grandparents, Prince George of Battenberg and Countess Nadejda Mikhailovna de Torby, were morganatic descendants of German and Russian royal houses. Her great-grandparents gave up their German titles in exchange for titles within the British peerage, and Anglicised their family name from Battenberg to Mountbatten. Through her father, Lady Tatiana is a descendant of multiple monarchs including Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse, Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse, Nicholas I of Russia, and Queen Victoria. As a distant relation to the British Royal Family, she is in the line of succession to the British throne, behind her younger brother Henry, Earl of Medina. She went to school at Millfield in Street, Somerset. Lady Tatiana is an equestrian and competes at a high level in dressage. She formerly trained under Hasse Hoffamann, Klaus Balkenhol, and Kyra Kyrklund but now trains under Charlotte Dujardin. In 2007, she was presented to society at Le Bal des D\u00e9butantes in Paris. In October 2018 Crofton & Hall appointed Lady Tatiana as their brand ambassador. In December 2019 Lady Tatiana was banned for driving for six months by a Magistrates Court because of speeding-related offences. == References == Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Daughters of British marquesses Tatiana Category:Debutantes of le Bal des d\u00e9butantes Category:English socialites Category:British dressage riders Category:Fashion influencers Category:People educated at Millfield ",
