Grasmere although crossed by major roads has retained its quiet suburban character. The area and adjoining Concord was dotted with lakes and ponds similar to the English Lake District village of Grasmere. The name is often attributed to Sir Roderick Cameron, an American resident of Canadian descent who was knighted by Queen Victoria. ==Transportation== The Staten Island Railway stops in the neighborhood's eponymous station. The distance between Grasmere station and next station north in Clifton is the longest between any two stations on the system.

Express bus service is provided by the SIM1, SIM7 and SIM10 on Hylan Boulevard, the SIM15 on Targee Street (northbound) and Richmond Road (southbound), the SIM3C and SIM35 Narrows Road, and the SIM30 on Tompkins Ave. ==Points of interest== 950 Fingerboard Road in Grasmere is the location of the executive offices of the Staten Island Advance, the island's daily newspaper.
