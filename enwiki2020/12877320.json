    "text": "Polyscias maraisiana is a species of plant in the family Araliaceae, formerly named Gastonia mauritiana. It is endemic to Mauritius, where it was formerly common on forest verges and also in coastal areas. It was formerly grown as an ornamental in Europe, partly on account of its strikingly heteroblastic leaves, however it is rarely found in international cultivation now. It is however beginning to be cultivated in its native country, as an ornamental landscaping plant - for gardens and public areas. It is one of several Polyscias species which are endemic to Mauritius, including Polyscias dichroostachya (distinctive flower-spike and large, square leaf-segments), Polyscias neraudiana (red flowers on spike, and smaller, longer leaf- segments), Polyscias gracilis, and Polyscias paniculata.Indigenous Plants of Mauritius List Gastonia mauritiana - Bois Boeuf - Endangered tree of Mauritius 3.jpg|Young sapling File:Gastonia mauritiana canopy - Ile aux Aigrettes 1.jpg|Canopy of a large specimen on Ile aux Aigrettes, Mauritius ==References== maraisiana Category:Endemic flora of Mauritius Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
