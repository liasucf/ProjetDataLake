His parents were the doctor and politician William Simonton (elected twice to Congress) and Mrs. Martha Davis Snodgrass (1791\u20131862), daughter of James Snodgrass, a Presbyterian minister, who was the pastor of the local church. Ashbel was named after Ashbel Green, president of New Jersey College. He was one among nine brothers and sisters. The boys (William, John, James, Thomas and Ashbel) used to call themselves the \"quinque fratres\" (five brothers). One of his brothers, James Snodgrass Simonton, four years older than Ashbel, was also a missionary to Brazil, spending three years as a teacher in the city of Vassouras, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. One of his four sisters, Elizabeth Wiggins Simonton (1822\u20131879), also called Lille, married the Presbyterian minister and missionary Alexander Latimer Blackford, a colleague of Simonton in Brazil and the co-founder of the Igreja Presbiteriana do Brasil. == Conversion == In 1846, the family moved to Harrisburg, where Simonton finished high school. After graduating in New Jersey College (the future Princeton University), in 1852, he spent about a year and a half in Mississippi, working as a teacher for young boys. Disappointed with the lack of attention by the local authorities for teaching, Simonton went back to Pennsylvania and tried to become a lawyer, although by that time many people would advise him to become a minister, something to which his mother had consecrated him at his birth. In 1855 he had a deep religious experience during a revival and went to the Princeton Seminary. In his first term, he heard in the seminary's chapel a sermon by Dr. Charles Hodge, one of his teachers, which moved him to the missionary work in foreign lands. He was ordained in 1859 and arrived in Brazil on August 12, the same year. == Ministry == Soon after organizing the Presbyterian church in Brazil (January 12, 1862), Simonton spent his vacation in the United States, where he married Helen Murdoch, in Baltimore. They came back to Brazil in July 1863. In the next year they became parents to Helen Murdoch Simonton, Simonton\u2019s only daughter. Besides the Presbyterian Church, Simonton created a newspaper, Imprensa Evang\u00e9lica (1864), along with a presbytery (1865) and a seminary (1867). ==Death== Tombstone of Rev. Ashbel Green Simonton, Protestant Cemetery, S\u00e3o Paulo In 1867, feeling ill, Simonton went to S\u00e3o Paulo, where his sister and brother-in-law were raising his daughter. Simonton died on December 9, 1867, victim of a tropical disease named \"febre biliosa\". ==External links== * Sons of the Prophets: Leaders in Protestantism from Princeton Seminary Category:1833 births Category:1867 deaths Category:Presbyterian missionaries in Brazil Category:American Presbyterian missionaries Category:People from Dauphin County, Pennsylvania Category:Princeton University alumni Category:American expatriates in Brazil ",
