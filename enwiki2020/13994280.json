    "text": "Henry Stump (?\u20131865) served as Judge of the Criminal Court, 5th Judicial Circuit in Baltimore, Maryland, United States, from 1851 to 1860, one of the most lawless and politically violent decades in Baltimore history. He presided over the infamous trial of Plug-Ugly Henry Gambrill for the murder of a Baltimore police officer. In 1860, the Maryland General Assembly removed Stump from office for \"misbehavior,\" the only jurist in Maryland history to be removed from the bench. Stump was also an eyewitness to the April 19, 1861 riots in Baltimore that marked the first bloodshed in the American Civil War. Stump was the brother of John Stump of Cecil County, Maryland, brother-in-law of Mary Alicia Stump and uncle of Henry Arthur Stump (1857\u20131934). The latter served as Judge to the Baltimore City Supreme Bench from 1910 to 1934. Henry Stump's Baltimore office was located at 57 West Fayette Street and his residence at Barnum's Hotel. According to the American Almanac, he earned a salary of $2,000 per year.The American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge, For the Year 1857. Boston: Crosby, Nichols, and Company, 1856, p. 279. Stump died on October 29, 1865, at his brother's Cecil County home. == Baltimore in the 1850s == Between 1790 and 1860, Baltimore's population increased from 13,000 to 200,000,Brown, George William. Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. vii. making it the third largest city in the United States. The Bank crisis in the 1830s, large numbers of European immigrants (a quarter of the population by 1860), a large free black population (25,000 in 1860), as well as slavery, created economic and political tensions. In addition, the \"state's 1851 constitution altered traditional political alignments in Maryland, and on the national front, the struggle over the Compromise of 1850 gravely injured Maryland's political equilibrium. The subsequent dissolution of the Whig Party in the 1852 national elections left many Marylanders in the lurch. These voters turned to prohibition and nativism as answers to the problems facing their communities. By 1854, the Know-Nothing, or American, Party seized the reins of mayoral power in Baltimore, marking the rise of one of America's most unusual third parties.\"Brown, George William. Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. ix. In 1855, the American Party won power in the Baltimore City Council, the General Assembly and the Maryland delegation to Congress. The American Party, representing nativist, anti-immigrant views, was associated with gangs such as the Plug Uglies which \"practiced intimidation, assault, arson, and assassination.\"Melton, Tracy Matthew. Hanging Henry Gambrill: The Violent Career of Baltimore's Plug Uglies, 1854\u20131860. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2005, p. 50. Much of the gang activity in Baltimore was political in nature: intimidation at the polls, for example. Immigrant and Catholic social clubs were organized by the Democratic Party (which was pro-slavery and sympathetic to the South) which competed for power with the American Party. This conflict resulted in violence \"in which scores of participants were killed and hundreds wounded. The large number of casualties made the American Party years some of the most violent in the city's history. The rates of criminal homicide would not be exceeded for another 100 years.\" In the midst of the political turmoil and violence, Plug-Ugly member Henry Gambrill was arrested and convicted for the murder of Baltimore police officer Benjamin Benton. As Tracy Melton writes, > [w]ithin a single month the city had seen raw intimidation prevent the > holding of a free and fair election and the assassination of a member of the > police force because of his testimony at the criminal court. Violence was no > longer merely an aspect of the rough culture on the city's streets, a > friction in the transaction of daily affairs, entertainment for some, a > nuisance for others, but only occasionally disruptive.

Secession Exploded: \"This strongly anti-Confederate satire is a fantastical vision of the Union defeat of the secessionist movement. A hideous monster representing secession emerges from the water at left. He is hit by a charge from a mammoth cannon 'Death to Traitors!' operated by Uncle Sam (right). A two-faced figure representing Baltimore, whose allegiance to the Union was at least questionable during the war, pulls at Uncle Sam's coattails. The explosion sends several small demons, representing the secessionist states, hurling through the air. Prominent among them is South Carolina, in a coffin at upper right. Tennessee and Kentucky, two Southern states internally divided over the secession question, are represented by two-headed creatures. Virginia, though part of the Confederacy, is also shown divided \u2013 probably an acknowledgment of the Appalachian and eastern regions' alignment with the Union. Among the demons is a small figure of Tennessee senator and 1860 presidential candidate John Bell, with a bell-shaped body. In the foreground is a large American flag on which Winfield Scott, commander of the Union forces, and a bald eagle rest. William Wiswell, Library of Congress Reproduction Number Reproduction Number: LC-USZ62-89738 Baltimore, just prior to the Civil War, was \"at a crucial moment of transformation.

Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. xii. == Removal from the Bench == Stump was elected in 1851 to serve a ten-year term to the 5th Judicial Circuit but was removed from office in 1860 for \"misbehavior.\" Stump's removal is the only case in Maryland history in which the complicated procedure (initiated in the Constitution of 1851) for electing judges to office and removal of them \"by address to the General Assembly\" has been carried out.The Archivists' Bulldog: Newsletter of the Maryland State Archives, Vol. 17, No. 19, p. 2\u20133. Watkins v. The State of Maryland: \"Incurable Judicial Blunder\" The misconduct case against Stump included charges that he repeatedly appeared in court drunk and as a result of his drunkenness was late to court, took frequent lengthy breaks and adjourned early, to the detriment of the business of the court. \"Even if the police could be persuaded to arrest someone, the American judge of the criminal court, the notoriously corrupt and alcoholic Henry Stump, was likely to let them go.\"Evitts, William J. A Matter of Allegiances: Maryland from 1850 to 1861. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974, p. 113 Stump was also accused of passing erroneous judgments such as in the case of Thomas M. Watkins, a free Negro convicted of simple larceny in Stump's court. Watkins was tried and found guilty of stealing a silver watch valued at $6. Stump then sentenced Watkins as follows: > Judgment \u2013 to be sold for the period of five years out of the limits of the > State, from March 31, 1859.Thomas M. Watkins, (Free Negro) vs. The State. > Court of Appeals of Maryland. 14 Md. 412; 1859 Md. Lexis 87. July 29, 1859, > Decided. Maryland State Archives. Special Collection 5339-41-8. The guidelines for sentencing free Negroes in cases of simply larceny of $5 and more, found in the Act of 1858, chapter 324, stipulated that \"they should be sentenced and sold at public sale, as slaves, for the period of not less than two, nor more than five years.\" Charles E. Phelps, counsel for Watkins, claimed that the \"Court has no power to sentence the party to be sold 'out of the limits of the State.'\"Thomas M. Watkins, (Free Negro) vs. The State. Court of Appeals of Maryland. 14 Md. 412; 1859 Md. Lexis 87. July 29, 1859, Decided. Maryland State Archives. Special Collection 5339-41-8, p. 1. Basically, Stump sentenced Watkins to be sold out of state and did not have the authority to do so. In the judgment above, Stump also neglected to specify a public sale (as opposed to private) according to law. Furthermore, Stump's critics accused him of amending the judgment before sending it to the Court of Appeals upon a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Baltimore. The judgment in the record transmitted to the Court of Appeals read as follows: > Therefore, it is considered by the Court here, that the said free Negro, > Thomas Watkins, be sold out of the State of Maryland, at public sale, as a > slave for the period of five years, under the provisions of the Act of > Assembly in such case made and provided.Thomas M. Watkins, (Free Negro) vs. > The State. Court of Appeals of Maryland. 14 Md. 412; 1859 Md. Lexis 87. July > 29, 1859, Decided. Maryland State Archives. Special Collection 5339-41-8, p. > 5. The Opinion of the Court of Appeals (which reversed the judgment on July 29, 1859) reads: > Without intending to impute unworthy motives to any one, we have no > hesitation in saying that the judgment that was actually rendered by the > court in this case, pronounced in the presence of the prisoner, entered upon > the docket and transmitted to the sheriff under the solemnity of the court's > seal, to be executed by him, is not the same judgment set out in the record > and originally transmitted to this court for review. The discrepancy between > the two is obvious and material. Stump's defense claimed that \"the judgment extended in the Record, is nothing more than a technical amplification of the docket entry according to its legal meaning and effect.\" In response, Phelps contended that > the question is submitted to the court whether it is not, on the contrary, > an ex gratia and unwarranted interpolation of matter of substance \u2013 an ex > post facto clerical amendment of an incurable judicial blunder.\" And > furthermore, \"the judgment in this case is not only a piece of arbitrary > judicial usurpation, but inasmuch as it gratuitously deprives this negro of > the protection of the laws just cited, the benefit of which is expressly > secured to him by the 3rd Art. of the Declaration of Rights, it assumes the > graver aspect of a cruel or careless violation of a sacred and chartered > right.Thomas M.

The Court of Appeals reversed another judgment and sentence from Stump's court \u2013 the trial of William G. Ford for the alleged murder of Thomas H. Burnham \u2013 and ordered Stump to try him again. Stump forcefully challenged the Court of Appeals, claiming it did not have the authority to make such an order. Stump wrote: \"If you, learned Judges, will refer me to the Acts of Assembly, I will obey your order to try Ford over again. You say there are such acts, of course you ought to show them, otherwise I am not bound to obey them.\" More than a hint of Stump's sarcasm or perhaps disdain is evident when he writes: \"Allow me to assure you (in order to tranquilize your nerves and satisfy your religious influences that Ford had as fair a trial as any man ever tried in this State or in the world.\" Stump goes on to chide the Appeals Court: > Let me beg you judges to consult the Governor, perhaps he will pardon or > hang him without another trial, which I certainly never will give him, until > I see your authority by Act of Assembly.

Removal Proceedings A joint committee of the House of Delegates and the Senate heard a parade of witnesses testify both for and against Judge Stump on the question of whether or not he should be removed from office. Witnesses against complained that the judge was frequently drunk and would occasionally fall asleep on the Bench; that he was late for Court and adjourned early; displayed vulgar behavior; erroneously passed judgments; and irresponsibly delegated tasks to clerks. \"He had refused to fine anyone more than once a year for violations of the Sunday liquor laws and had accepted straw bail from John Hinsley and other disreputable figures,\" writes Melton.Melton, Tracy Matthew. Hanging Henry Gambrill: The Violent Career of Baltimore's Plug Uglies, 1854-1860. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2005, p. 372. Stump did not help his case when, in Annapolis for his hearing, he \"exchanged insults with the senator from Allegany County and had then struck him with his cane.\"Melton, Tracy Matthew. Hanging Henry Gambrill: The Violent Career of Baltimore's Plug Uglies, 1854-1860. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2005, p. 372\u20133.

The witnesses in his favor were as varied as to class and profession but most focused on saying they had not seen him drunk on the Bench during a specific period of time. Here are examples of the testimony: Speaking to the accusation that Stump had used the term \"whore\" in court: Witnesses testifying against Stump: * Thomas Creamer, Sheriff of Baltimore City (1857\u201359) * Thomas Gardner, clerk of the Criminal Court * Lawrence Sangston, foreman of the Grand Jury during the January 1859 term * Benjamin Robins, juryman in the Criminal Court * John P.

Joseph Rogers, attorney practicing in the Criminal Court * Richard Lilly, saddler * William H. Jenkins, juror * George W.P. Smith, former prosecuting attorney for Worcester County * Robert McAllister, attorney practicing in the Criminal Court * William Chestnut, grocer, member of Grand Jury After hearing testimony, the Select Committee made the recommendation that Henry Stump be removed from office. While conceding that their hearing did not constitute a criminal trial, their conclusion was that the state of facts \"amount to such misbehavious in office, as requires immediate action.\"Report of the Select Subcommittee Appointed on the Part of the Senate in Relation to the Petition for the Removal of Judge Stump. Document Z. By the Senate, March 1st, 1860. The Removal of Baltimore City Criminal Court Judge Henry Stump, 1860, Maryland State Archives Govpub. Image No: 812302-0001 \u2013 3. MSA SC 5339-41-8. Notably, they found: * Stump \"has acted, while in the discharge of his official duties, in a gross, vulgar and undignified manner, especially to the members of the bar and other parties in his Court.\" * \"That he has been in the habitual use of intoxicating drinks, to an extent which disqualifies him for the prompt and impartial administration of justice.\" * \"That he has pursued a course, violative of his official oath, in refusing to obey the orders of the Court of Appeals, and indicated, by sneering remarks on the bench, his disposition to treat the action of said Court with derision and contempt.\" * \"That he has, from time to time, delegated to the officers of his Court discretionary powers in discharging indictments, compromising fines, as has in fact rendered his Court utterly inefficient for the protection of public morals and public peace.\" Minority Report The Minority Report of the joint committee, written by Coleman Yellott, objected not on grounds of Stump's merit, but that the committee had overstepped its authority by removing Stump without a conviction in a court of law. Although the state constitution authorized removal either: 1) by conviction in court of law, or 2) \"by the Governor, upon the address of the General Assembly, provided that two-thirds of all the members of each House concur in said Address,\" Yellott said that the committee had acted as if it were a court of law and Stump did not get a fair hearing. \"It would be strange indeed, if a case like the present, involving as it does such important rights, should be the only exception to this universal rule [of a fair trial], and that the same constitution which guaranties to a party a trial, where he has involved property to the amount of 'five dollars,' should authorize a judgment against him without trial where the effect of the judgment would be to deprive him of a future salary amounting in the aggregate to nearly four thousand dollars!\"Minority Report of the Select Committee Appointed on the Part of the Senate in Relation to the Petition for the Removal of Judge Stump. Document AA. By the Senate, March 5th, 1860. The Removal of Baltimore City Criminal Court Judge Henry Stump, 1860, Maryland State Archives Govpub. Image No: 812303-0001 \u2013 3. MSA SC 5339-41-8. The General Assembly acted upon the majority opinion and, upon approval by two- thirds of both houses, petitioned Governor Thomas Hicks for Stump's removal. The governor responded to the General Assembly ordering Stump's removal from office as follows: Proceedings of the House, 1860, Volume 660, p 897 Stump's Case Prompts Proposed Constitutional Amendment \u2013 Reforms After 100 Years Four years after Stump's removal, at the state Constitutional Convention, an amendment to the state constitution was proposed to ensure a fair trial in such cases as Stump's. The amendment was rejected (see below):Proceedings and Debates of the 1864 Constitutional Convention. Volume 102, Volume 1, Debates 363 The question being then taken, the amendment was not agreed to. However, the question of fair treatment for judges charged with misconduct or incompetence was taken up again, nearly 100 years later. In 1966, the state of Maryland adopted a judicial conduct commission to provide for disciplining of judges via a permanent agency with authority to review complaints, conduct investigations and hearings, and make disciplinary recommendations to the Court of Appeals. Prior to establishment of the commission, Maryland judges were subject to the constitutional methods for removal (removal by the Governor; impeachment; or by two-thirds vote of the General Assembly) or to informal tactics such as peer pressure. The commission is intended to provide judges procedural protection as well as protection from impeachment methods that could be by their very nature political or partisan and \"it permits judges to enforce unpopular laws or protect unpopular views without fear of reprisal from the legislative or executive branches.\"Harrell Jr., Judge Glenn T. \"The Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities: Whither Thou Goest?,\" The Law Forum. University of Baltimore School of Law. Spring 1996. Issue 26.2, p. 10. == Eyewitness to the Baltimore Riot of 1861 == On April 19, 1861, when the Massachusetts Sixth Regiment marched through Baltimore en route to Washington, \"more than 5,000 Baltimoreans took part in the attacks on Federal troops, which resulted in the deaths of 21 soldiers and civilians and more than 100 injuries.\"Brown, George William. Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. xiii By the time of the riot, political power had shifted away from the pro-Union Know-Nothing Party and was back in the hands of Democrats. At least part of the uproar over Union troops passing through was aimed at their association with the hated Know-Nothings than with Southern sentiment. Frank Towers writes, \"[t]he ascendancy of Southern sympathizers in late April owed more to their control of the means of violence \u2013 as manifested in the actions of police, militia volunteers, and federal employees \u2013 than in did to a non-existent majority sentiment for secession.\" Elfenbein, Jessica, John R. Breihan, Thomas L. Hollowak. From Mobtown to Charm City: New Perspectives on Baltimore's Past. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2004, p. 115. Secession sentiment did exist in Baltimore (see image) although it was largely among wealthy merchants and slave owners worried about their economic well- being if Southern trade were cut off. They attempted to draw in working-class immigrants who had been victims of the Know-Nothing nativist sentiment.Elfenbein, Jessica, John R. Breihan, Thomas L. Hollowak. From Mobtown to Charm City: New Perspectives on Baltimore's Past. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2004, p. 117. To many in the border city of Baltimore, the issue was not simply North versus South. Rather the choice was secession (which few favored) or the \"lesser evil [of] living under a federal administration they thoroughly disliked and one that might soon return their enemies to power.\" (118) \"Long the targets of nativist politicians, some Irish workers allied with these wealthy Southern sympathizers rather than cast their lot with former enemies that now dominated the Union movement.\"Elfenbein, Jessica, John R. Breihan, Thomas L. Hollowak. From Mobtown to Charm City: New Perspectives on Baltimore's Past. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2004, p. 116. And as William Evitts writes, \"Marylanders valued the union; more, they loved and needed it, and could not conceive of existence without it. Yet they clearly perceived the threat of federal dissolution. They therefore faced a double crisis: to preserve the union while preparing themselves to make a choice if they failed.\"Evitts, William J. A Matter of Allegiances: Maryland from 1850 to 1861.
