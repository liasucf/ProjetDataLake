    "text": "Hymenobacter elongatus is a species of bacteria first isolated from Victoria Upper Glacier, Antarctica on basal ice. It is a psychrotolerant, heterotrophic aerobe. It is notable for the prevalence of horizontal gene transfers in its evolution, possibly due to dormancy because of its habitat. ==References== ==Further reading== *Reddy, Gundlapally SN, and Ferran Garcia-Pichel. \"Description of Hymenobacter arizonensis sp. nov. from the southwestern arid lands of the United States of America.\" Antonie van Leeuwenhoek 103.2 (2013): 321-330. *Lee, Jae-Jin, et al. \"Hymenobacter swuensis sp. nov., a gamma- radiation-resistant bacteria isolated from mountain soil.\" Current Microbiology 68.3 (2014): 305-310. *Srinivasan, Sathiyaraj, et al. \"Pontibacter humi sp. nov., Isolated from Mountain Soil.\" Current Microbiology 69.3 (2014): 263-269. *Han, Lu, et al. \"Hymenobacter qilianensis sp. nov., isolated from a subsurface sandstone sediment in the permafrost region of Qilian Mountains, China and emended description of the genus Hymenobacter.\" Antonie van Leeuwenhoek105.5 (2014): 971-978. ==External links== * * *LPSN Category:Flavobacteria Category:Bacteria described in 2011 ",
