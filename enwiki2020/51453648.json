Chapman alongside Cracker Barrel released the album on March 11, 2013. ==Background and recording== The album was recorded at Beech Street Studios by Brent King and mixed by him along with Sean Moffitt, while the album was mastered by Brad Blackwood from Euphonic Masters. The album has performances by his father, Herb Chapman Sr. and his brother Herb Chapman Jr. alongside ones from his eldest son, Caleb Chapman from Colony House, and his daughter-in-law, Jillian Edwards Chapman, who is married to his son, Will Chapman. The gospel music and bluegrass music legend Ricky Skaggs performs on this album. ==Critical reception== Reviewing the album from Country Weekly, David Guy replies, \"For the gospel and contemporary Christian fan, this album will be uplifting and a welcome addition to the catalog of a prolific artist.\" Mark Rice writes, \"the album is a joy to listen to\". John DiBiase describes, \"Deep Roots is a wonderful, under-the-radar release that gets back to the basics in a refreshing way; it's a palette-cleanser for today's often overly busy music and a great tool for intimate worship. Don't miss it.\" Dawn Theresa states, \"Deep Roots is more than just another hymns record \u2013 it's an artist reconnecting with his past and reminding us that hope and light are found in a deep-rooted faith.\" Jonathan Andre says, \"A great purchase if you thoroughly enjoy the acoustic and bluegrass genre, this album is a great divergence from Steven, as he branches out into some new music. Well done Steven for a different, yet equally profound and welcoming album!\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Steven Curtis Chapman \u2013 lead vocals, acoustic guitar, banjo, producer, arranger *Jillian Edwards Chapman \u2013 vocals *Ricky Skaggs \u2013 vocals, appears courtesy of Skaggs Family Records *Herb Chapman, Sr. \u2013 vocals, acoustic guitar on \"He Touched Me\" *Herb Chapman, Jr. \u2013 vocals *Caleb Chapman \u2013 vocals *Scott Sheriff \u2013 background vocals for \"My Redeemer is Faithful and True\" *Gordon Mote \u2013 piano *Bryan Sutton \u2013 acoustic guitar, banjo *Brent Milligan \u2013 bass, cello, baritone, producer *Dan Dugmore \u2013 dobro, steel guitar *Rob Ickes \u2013 dobro *Brent King \u2013 recording, mixing *Sean Moffitt \u2013 mixing *Brad Blackwood \u2013 mastering *Jim Houser \u2013 managing *Dan Raines \u2013 managing *Chris Hollo \u2013 photographing *Camille Blinn \u2013 photographing *Dena Divito \u2013 thanking ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2013) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2013 albums Category:Steven Curtis Chapman albums ",
