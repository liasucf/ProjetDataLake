According to Geist, in 2007, proposed Canadian legislation included the worst aspects of the 1998 U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). In December 2007, Geist said the legislation will likely \"mirror the DMCA with strong anti- circumvention legislation\u2014far beyond what is needed to comply with the WIPO Internet treaties\", and will likely contain no protection for \"flexible fair dealing. No parody exception. No time shifting exception. No device shifting exception. No expanded backup provision. Nothing.\" Widespread online and offline support, from activist and author Cory Doctorow to over 90,000 Facebook users, led to the tabling of the copyright legislation by Industry Minister Jim Prentice until 2008. Geist has continued to play a prominent role on copyright in Canada, with numerous articles, speeches, books, and appearances before House of Commons and Senate committees on the subject. In December 2010, he wrote a paper titled \"Clearing Up the Copyright Confusion: Fair Dealing and Bill C-32\"\"Clearing Up the Copyright Confusion: Fair Dealing and Bill C-32\" by Michael Geist, December 2010 where he summarizes and critically examines some of the main issues of this bill. Then in October 2011, when the Canadian government began attempts to pass a new bill on copyright reform, which included digital lock rules, called Bill C-11, he wrote \"The Daily Digital Lock Dissenter\" on his blog.The Daily Digital Lock Dissenter This was a daily blog entry where he introduced former submissions to the government about how Canadians felt about the restrictive digital lock regulations in regard to Bill C-32 and based on the 2009 national copyright consultation. He argued that while Bill C-11 had some valid points, it was too restrictive because it did not take a balanced approach and it was \"primarily about satisfying U.S. pressure, not public opinion\". ==Trade: ACTA, the TPP and USMCA== Geist is considered an expertJuha Saarinen: Q & ACTA, with Michael Geist.

He did note, with the CRTC's usage based oral hearing on July 19, 2011, that they were making efforts to address this lack of competition and criticized Bell Canada and other major companies for their involvement in limiting smaller ISPs.\u201cThe Usage Based Billing Hearing Concludes: Has the CRTC Come to Competition Too Late?\u201d by Michael Geist, July 20, 2011 Also in 2011, he wrote a study on the true transport costs of a gigabyte for a Canadian consumer from an ISP and concluded it was roughly a total of eight cents per gigabyte but this report was later denounced by the major ISPs, most notably Bell Canada.\u201cWhat Does a Gigabyte Cost, Revisited\u201d by Michael Geist , July 29, 2011 Geist has been a vocal supporter of net neutrality in Canada, writing widely on the subject and frequently discussing the issue in the mainstream media.
