The plaintiff, Colin O'Kroley, alleged that Google's automated snippet algorithm created a defamatory search result by falsely implying that the plaintiff had been accused of indecency with a child. The District Court granted Google's motion to dismiss the case, and found that Google had immunity from the defamation charges under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects interactive computer services from being held liable as a speaker or publisher for information provided by a third-party information content provider. On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. __TOC__ ==Facts== The plaintiff, Colin O'Kroley, performed a Google search of his own name in August 2012. Among the search results was an entry that included the snippet: This snippet was generated by a Google algorithm, summarizing an ebook page produced from an ebook produced by Fastcase. The plaintiff alleged that, despite the underlying source document not containing any defamatory statements, the action of summarizing the document created defamatory statements. Google's algorithm removed the context of the O'Kroley v. Pringle lawsuit and created an implicit association between a case involving indecency with a child and the O'Kroley lawsuit when, in reality, there was no relation other than being published on the same page of court case summaries. The plaintiff claimed several causes of action stemming from this summarized search result. ==Google's motion to dismiss== Google filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Under this motion, while the court must accept all well-pleaded factual allegations as true, the complaint must be more than \"a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action\" as determined in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly. Google argued that under Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, as an \"interactive service provider\", it has immunity from the plaintiff's complaint. Under the statute, if Google satisfies the requirements for being an interactive computer service, then it has immunity for acting as a publisher of information provided by a third- party. O'Kroley argued that the act of summarizing a non-defamatory article into a defamatory summary created new content and turned Google into an information content provider and thus losing its protected status. However, courts have found the immunities provided under the statute as \"quite robust.\" The magistrate judge reviewing the case found that Google's automated editing and summarization process falls under the role of a publisher and thus Google has immunity from liability.Report and recommendation, O'Kroley v. Fastcase, Inc., No. 3:13-cv-780 (M.D. Tenn. June 25, 2014) Based on this conclusion, the district judge upheld the magistrate's recommendation and granted Google's motion to dismiss the complaint.O'Kroley v. Fastcase, Inc., No. 3:13-cv-780 (M.D. Tenn. June 25, 2014). == Appeal == On July 22, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed the District Court's decision. Writing for the court, Judge Jeffrey S. Sutton held that \"[t]he district court got it right\" in dismissing each aspect of O'Kroley's claims.O'Kroley v.

With respect to O'Kroley's claim against Google, the court held that Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act barred the claim.Id., slip op. at 2\u20134. Google's \"automated editorial acts on the content, such as removing spaces and altering font\", did not abrogate Google's statutory immunity, nor did the fact that Google \"kept the search result up even after O'Kroley complained about it.\"Id., slip op. at 3. O'Kroley's claims against other defendants were dismissed for procedural reasons,Id., slip op. at 4. and the court observed that several other points that O'Kroley raised on appeal \"rang[ed] from the meritless to the frivolous,\" stating that \"[t]o restate some claims is to reject them.\"Id., slip op. at 4. Despite affirming the dismissal of O'Kroley's complaint in its entirety, the court noted that the lawsuit was not a complete loss for O'Kroley: ==Further reading== * * ==References== Category:Defamation case law Category:United States Internet case law Category:2014 in United States case law ",
