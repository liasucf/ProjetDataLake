In 1995, she appeared in the TV pilot of Fox's Medicine Ball. That year, she interned for Congresswoman Linda Smith. In 1996, when she was a junior, Jackson transferred from a Los Angeles community college to Stanford University, where she wrote for a conservative student publication founded by Peter Thiel, The Stanford Review, as a critic of affirmative action and feminism. In 1998 she managed her father's unsuccessful run for Congress. She worked for statehouse Senator Joseph Zarelli in 1998 and 1999. Jackson graduated from Pepperdine University School of Law in 2002. She then worked for Judicial Watch. In April 2004, she wrote in Reason Magazine that she thought there were too many federal crimes. She served as an editorial assistant on the collected essays of libertarian economist Murray Rothbard during a fellowship at the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and wrote two academic papers appraising his work. She authored the 2005 book Their Lives: The Women Targeted by the Clinton Machine, concerning the biographies of Paula Jones, Gennifer Flowers, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick, all of whom reported sexual harassment or abuse by former president Bill Clinton. Eric M. Jackson, the book's publisher, was a former colleague of hers on The Stanford Review. In 2015, Roger Stone hired her to produce a video profiling Kathy Shelton, a survivor of a child sexual assault whose assailant was represented in court by Hillary Clinton in the 1970s.

In July 2017, Jackson said in an interview that alcohol or the end of relationships are the cause of \"90%\" of campus sexual- assault claims leading to Title IX investigations. The comment prompted the Washington Post editorial board to call for Jackson's resignation, saying that she had promoted sexual-assault myths and that \"someone who doesn't think sexual assault on campus is a real problem in the first place is not qualified to do that sorting.\" Following an outcry, Jackson apologized, called her comment \"flippant\" and stating that \"All sexual harassment and sexual assault must be taken seriously.\"Fernanda Zamudio-Suar\u00e9z, Civil-Rights Official Apologizes for Saying 90% of Campus Rape Cases Stem From Regret, Chronicle of Higher Education (July 12, 2017). ==Personal life== Jackson is a lesbian and as of 2017 had been married to her wife for over a decade; she is a mother of twins.
