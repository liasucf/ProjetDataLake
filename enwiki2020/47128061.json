    "text": "The Akron Cemetery is a historic cemetery in rural southeastern Independence County, Arkansas. The cemetery is located on the west side of Arkansas Highway 122, about south of Newark, on top of a Native American mound. With its oldest recorded burial dating to 1829, it is possibly the oldest cemetery in the county, and is known to be the burial site of some of the Newark area's earliest settlers. It is all that survives of the community of Big Bottom, and early settlement that was renamed Akron in 1880, and was abandoned around 1940. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Independence County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1829 Category:Buildings and structures in Independence County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Independence County, Arkansas ",
