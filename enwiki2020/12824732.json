    "text": "Yves Andr\u00e9as Manga (born 15 October 1980) is a French football defender of Senegalese origin. He is currently without a club after being released by Perpignan Canet FC. The reason for this release was the reckless behaviour on the pitch during the 2007-08 season. After 24 matchdays, Manga had received red cards against Tubize, VW Hamme and OH Leuven. On matchday 25, against Antwerp, Manga made a dangerous two-footed challenge on Luciano Olgu\u00edn. He only received a yellow card, but was substituted during the break after some other risky interventions. ==References== Category:1980 births Category:Living people Category:French footballers Category:K.S.K.
