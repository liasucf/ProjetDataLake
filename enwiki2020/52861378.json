    "text": "The 2017 DFB-Pokal Final decided the winner of the 2016\u201317 DFB-Pokal, the 74th season of the annual German football cup competition. The match was played on 27 May 2017 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. Eintracht Frankfurt, in their first final since 2006, faced Borussia Dortmund, the runners-up in the previous three finals. Borussia Dortmund won the match 2\u20131 to claim their fourth cup title. The winners, Borussia Dortmund, will host the 2017 edition of the DFL-Supercup at the start of the next season, and will face the champions of the 2016\u201317 edition of the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich. The winner of the DFB-Pokal also earns automatic qualification for the group stage of the 2017\u201318 edition of the UEFA Europa League, but since Borussia Dortmund already qualified for the 2017\u201318 edition of the UEFA Champions League through position in the Bundesliga, the group stage spot went to the team in sixth, Hertha BSC, and the league's third qualifying round spot to the team in seventh, SC Freiburg. ==Route to the final== The DFB-Pokal began with 64 teams in a single-elimination knockout cup competition. There were a total of five rounds leading up to the final. Teams were drawn against each other, and the winner after 90 minutes would advance. If still tied, 30 minutes of extra time was played. If the score was still level, a penalty shoot-out was used to determine the winner. Note: In all results below, the score of the finalist is given first (H: home; A: away). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; white-space:nowrap;\" |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Eintracht Frankfurt !
