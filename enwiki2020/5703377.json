Sky Princess sailed her last cruise for Princess Cruises in October 2000, arriving in Sydney on 23 October, where she was to be transferred to P&O; Cruises Australia under the name, Pacific Sky, after a $10 million refurbishment at Cairncross Dockyard in Brisbane. Replacing the 1957-built Fair Princess, Pacific Skys was quickly accepted by Australian cruise passengers. Between 2000 and 2006, Pacific Sky carried 275,000 passengers on 200 cruises. Her popularity prompted the expansion of the P&O; Australia fleet to include Pacific Sun (2004), Pacific Dawn (November 2007), Pacific Jewel (2009) and Pacific Pearl (2010). Sky Wonder in Dubrovnik, Croatia. In May 2006, the transfer from P&O; Cruises Australia to Pullmantur Cruises in Spain was made, after a series of 33 seven-day cruises based out of Singapore. Sky Wonder was registered in Valletta, Malta. The Italian-built Regal Princess took Sky Wonders place in the P&O; Cruises fleet in mid-2007 as the Pacific Dawn. From March 2009 on, Sky Wonder was laid up in Piraeus. In April 2009, she was renamed Atlantic Star and sailed for the Portuguese market. Atlantic Star at sea. In January 2010, Kyma Ship Management expressed interest in purchasing the ship,http://www.shipsmonthly.com/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=168:pullmantur- future-of-atlantic-star&catid;=51:cruise&Itemid;=66 but they backed out due to the high cost of replacing the steam turbines with diesel engines.

Her draft was approximately , but this figure varies with respect to the amount of stores, fuel and water on board. The size of a cruise ship is expressed in gross tonnage, which is actually a measurement of the vessel's volume and not the actual weight. Atlantic Star measured . Atlantic Star was powered by steam turbines and was one of the last steam turbine cruise ships in the world. While at sea, she operated on two or three boilers depending on the speed required. When two were in use, she could achieve a maximum speed of ; when all three boilers were in use, she could steam at a maximum of . At full speed, she would consume up to 220 tonnes of fuel oil a day. The vessel had two fixed pitch propellers and a single rudder. She was fitted with one bow thruster and one stern thruster for maneuvering at ports Atlantic Star was fitted with two retractable stabilizer fins, which could be extended either individually or together depending on the sea conditions. Each fin was long and wide. They were controlled by hydraulic rams and were fed information from gyroscopes which sense the vessel's rolling motion. When in use, they could reduce the amount of the vessels roll by up to 85% but they had no effect on the ship's pitching motion. Atlantic Star had two anchors. Each anchor weighed nine tonnes and was attached to approximately 80 tonnes of anchor chain. == Incidents == Atlantic Star was involved in many incidents during her career.
