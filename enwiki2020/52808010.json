    "text": "This is a list of 10-meter diving platforms in the United States. The 10 meter dive has been an Olympic sport since the 1904 Summer Olympics, in which American George Sheldon won gold. Women's diving in the Olympics started with Women's diving at the 1912 Summer Olympics. University of Washington, 1915 Training for Olympic diving competition requires 10 meter diving facilities, which are sparse. For example, the Walter Schroeder Aquatic Center, built in 1979 as a YMCA facility, is one of only two Olympic sized pools in Wisconsin that can host large events, and it is the only facility in the southeast Wisconsin region with 10-meter diving platforms. For another example, the 2016 Olympic tryouts included Jessica Parratto, who could only dive from spring- boards in New Hampshire, but who moved to Indiana for access to diving platform facilities and trained there for seven years before the 2016 Olympic tryouts. It is not known if any of the platforms are individually named, formally or informally. 10 meter diving platforms in the U.S. include (by state then city): {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
