    "text": "Petar Crni (Latin: Petrus Zerni) was a Croatian nobleman, dignitary and Latin poet in the second half of the 11th-century. ==Biography== He was most likely born in the city of Split during the middle of the 11th century, to Gumaj, who was the son of Miha\u010da. Other sources claim he was the son of \u010crne, the prior of Split.http://enciklopedija.lzmk.hr/clanak.aspx?id=54793 His brother Dabrus was a monk of the royal monastery of St. Stephen Beneath the Pines near Split.
