    "text": "The initial seat distribution of the 20th Canadian Parliament William Lyon Mackenzie King was Prime Minister during the first three years of the 20th Canadian Parliament. Louis St. Laurent was Prime Minister during the final year of the 20th Canadian Parliament. The 20th Canadian Parliament was in session from September 6, 1945, until April 30, 1949. The membership was set by the 1945 federal election on June 11, 1945, and it changed only somewhat due to resignations and by-elections until it was dissolved prior to the 1949 election. It was controlled by a Liberal Party minority first under Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and the 16th Canadian Ministry, and later a majority under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent and the 17th Canadian Ministry. The Official Opposition was the newly named Progressive Conservative Party, led first by John Bracken and later by George Drew. The Speaker was Gaspard Fauteux. See also List of Canadian electoral districts 1933-1947 for a list of the ridings in this parliament. In this parliament, the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, led by M.J. Coldwell, overtook the Social Credit as third largest party. There were five sessions of the 20th Parliament: {|class=\"wikitable\" !Session !Start !End |- | 1st | September 6, 1945 | December 18, 1945 |- | 2nd | March 14, 1946 | August 31, 1946 |- | 3rd | January 30, 1947 | July 17, 1947 |- | 4th | December 5, 1947 | June 30, 1948 |- | 5th | January 29, 1949 | April 30, 1949 |} ==List of members== Following is a full list of members of the twentieth Parliament listed first by province, then by electoral district.
