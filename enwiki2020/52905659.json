He studied piano and composition at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and also at the California Institute of the Arts, where he received his bachelor's degree in Music Composition. Upon graduation, Tahouri continued his studies with notable film composer Ira Newborn, who was an important mentor for Tahouri in honing his musical craft in film. In 2008, another composer encouraged Tahouri in the next step of his career. After hearing his music, Academy Award Winning composer Hans Zimmer invited Tahouri to be a part of Remote Control Productions, and also recommended Tahouri to composer Ramin Djawadi. Tahouri went on to provide additional music and arrangements for many of Djawadi\u2019s projects, including Paramount Pictures\u2019 Iron Man, Warner Bros.
