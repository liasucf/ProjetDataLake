    "text": "Mikael Christian Wiehe (born 10 April 1946 in Stockholm) is a Swedish singer, multi-instrumentalist and composer. As the main songwriter and driving force of Hoola Bandoola Band he was also one of the most important people in the progg movement. ==Career== Wiehe's father was Danish and he spent the first six years of his life in Copenhagen. His father left the family when he was five years old, and when he was six his mother moved with the family to Malm\u00f6, in the Scania region of southern Sweden, giving Wiehe his noticeable Scanian accent. He is a leftist folk musician, dealing with what he considers right and wrong in the society from the eyes of the proletariat, but he also writes personal, non-political songs. Wiehe was one of the lead singers and the leading songwriter of Hoola Bandoola Band in the 1970s. After the split of the group in 1975, he was the leader of various other bands before becoming a solo artist in the beginning of the 1980s. He was a close friend of Bj\u00f6rn Afzelius, the other lead singer of Hoola Bandoola Band. They sometimes toured around Scandinavia and recorded together in the 1980s and 1990s. Today, Wiehe performs all around Sweden, using material from his 20-some albums (excluding various compilations). A recently published song book contains the lyrics and melodies to 220 of his songs. In 2000, he released the single Det h\u00e4r \u00e4r ditt land, a Swedish-language adaptation of the Woody Guthrie song This Land Is Your Land which received substantial play on Swedish radio. Wiehe has also translated many of Bob Dylan's songs into Swedish some were performed by Totta N\u00e4slund. ==60th birthday tribute== On Wiehe's 60th birthday, a tribute show was held in his hometown Malm\u00f6. A number of high-profile Swedish artists, including Joakim Th\u00e5str\u00f6m, Lars Winnerb\u00e4ck, Dregen, Lisa Ekdahl, Timbuktu, Stefan Sundstr\u00f6m, Idde Shultz and Anna Stadling (of Hovet), Ebba Forsberg, Thomas Wiehe and Peter Clemmendson, performed Wiehe's songs in front of approximately 20,000 people. At the end of the show, Wiehe took the stage and performed a set of his favorite songs. The concert was later broadcast on Sveriges Television with interviews and older footage of Wiehe. ==Political views== Wiehe performing live at Ung V\u00e4nsters congress in 2003. On 24 February 2007, Wiehe performed at a festival in Malm\u00f6, labeled as a \"solidarity party for the Cuban Revolution\", which was organized by the Swedish-Cuban Association, the Revolutionary Communist Youth, the Swedish Communist Party and others. The ambassador of Cuba to Sweden, Ernesto Mel\u00e9ndez Bachs, also held a speech at the festival. In an interview in Kv\u00e4llsposten, Wiehe said that \"Cuba has the best record on human rights in the region\" and in an interview with Sveriges Radio he said that he would \"hesitate\" to label the country as a dictatorship.Studio Ett \u2013 P1 \u2013 sr.se In 2015 Wiehe received the Lenin Award, controversial due to its namesake Vladimir Lenin. ==Selected discography== ===Studio albums=== Hoola Bandoola Band * Hoola Bandoola Export (1971) * Garanterat Individuell (1971) * Vem Kan Man Lita P\u00e5?
