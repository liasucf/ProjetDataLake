    "text": "The results of elections in the state of Wyoming have tended to be more conservative than liberal than most of the United States due to Wyoming being a rural state which usually vote for the Republican Party. Democratic voters, in the minority, are concentrated in more urban areas such as Teton County. Despite the imbalance in registration, Wyoming voters have elected relatively conservative Democrats to local, state and federal offices such as the thirty- first governor Dave Freudenthal. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;
