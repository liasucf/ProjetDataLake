The book describes how Grubbs met her husband, Robert Phillips, who had end-stage kidney disease. Whilst searching for a kidney, Grubbs learned about the disparities in kidney allocation, where African American patients received only 1 in 5 of donated kidneys despite being 1 in 3 of transplant candidates. The book documents other biases she has experienced as a woman of colour. She donated her own kidney before getting an engagement ring. It is also a collection of medical histories that covers the 400 years in the build-up of medical dialysis. The book was well received by The New York Times and Kirkus Reviews. == References == Category:African-American physicians Category:American nephrologists Category:Physicians from North Carolina Category:Duke University School of Medicine alumni Category:Duke University alumni Category:People from Spring Lake, North Carolina Category:21st-century American physicians Category:American medical writers Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Women medical writers Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:Writers from North Carolina Category:Living people Category:21st-century American women physicians Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
