    "text": "Phyllobius argentatus is a species of short-nosed weevil commonly known as the silver-green leaf weevil. ==Description== P. argentatus is a slender and elongate weevil, measuring 3.8-6.0 mm in length with bright metallic green scales on its elytra. ==Habitat and Distribution== P. argentatus is associated with a broad range of host plant, including examples in the plant families Salicaceae, Rosaceae, Ulmaceae, Fagaceae, and Betulaceae. It is widely distributed in Europe, where it may be regarded as a pest of fruit trees and hazlenuts where adult beetles may bite holes in leaves and flowers. The damage is, however, rarely important unless it occurs on young trees and nursery stocks. ==References== == External links == * Biodiversity Heritage Library * Fauna europaea Category:Entiminae Category:Beetles of Europe Category:Beetles described in 1758 Category:Taxa named by Carl Linnaeus ",
