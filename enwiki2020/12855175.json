Of those, six players would eventually play in the Major Leagues. The Dodgers did not have picks in rounds 2-4 this season as those picks were awarded to other teams as compensation for their signing of free agents. The first round pick in the June draft was shortstop Ross Jones of the University of Miami. The Dodgers traded him to the New York Mets in 1983 and he would appear in 67 games in parts of three seasons with the Mets and two other teams, hitting only .221. This was a fairly weak draft class for the Dodgers, with the most notable player being outfielder R. J. Reynolds, who was drafted in the 2nd round of the January draft and played 8 unremarkable seasons as a backup outfielder before finishing up his career in Japan with Nippon Professional Baseball. {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:inherit\" |- ! 1980 Draft Picks |- | ===January draft=== 1980 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB January Draft-Regular Phase {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |David Lesch |RHP | Central Arizona College |Yes | 1980 | Rookie |- |2 |R.
