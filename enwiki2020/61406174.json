He was first elected as Governor of the province in 2016 and he was re-elected in 2019. ==Suspension as Governor== Four months before the 2019 Philippine general election, the Department of the Interior and Local Government has suspended re-electionist Catanduanes Governor Joseph Cua for abuse of authority. Cua's suspension for six months stemmed from an administrative complaint filed by a certain Rey Mendez for allegedly allowing a construction firm owned by Mayor Eulogio Rodriguez of Bato town to use a lot owned by the provincial government free of charge even without authorization from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan. ==References== * * * * ==External links== *Province of Catanduanes Official Website Category:Living people Category:Governors of Catanduanes Category:1962 births Category:United Nationalist Alliance politicians ",
