    "text": "The Electoral district of Lyell was a single-member electoral district of the Tasmanian House of Assembly. It included the towns of Queenstown and Strahan in the West Coast region of Tasmania. The seat was created in a redistribution in 1899, and was abolished when the Tasmanian parliament adopted the Hare- Clark electoral model in 1909. It was first filled at a by-election on 10 April 1899, notable for being the first occasion on which the Labor Party contested a Tasmanian seat. Its candidate, R. Matthews, gained 40% of the votes . In 1903, Labor's James Long won the seat. At the 1909 election he successfully transferred to the multi-member seat of Darwin (now known as Braddon), but resigned the following year to successfully contest an Australian Senate seat. ==Members for Lyell== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Member!!Party!!Term |- | | | James Gaffney | Liberal | 1899\u20131903 |- | | | James Long | Labour | 1903\u20131909 |} ==Notes== ==References== * * * Parliament of Tasmania (2006).
