This was a rematch of the previous year's final, also won by Pepperdine. The Waves (22\u20137) were coached by Rod Wilde. Pepperdines's Steve Friedman was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Friedman, along with six other players, also comprised the All-tournament team. ==Qualification== Until the creation of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all NCAA men's volleyball programs, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
