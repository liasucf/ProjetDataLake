    "text": "Javier Mar\u00eda Santiago Pascual Iba\u00f1ez (1933\u20131998) was a Spanish publisher and a Carlist activist. His professional career climaxed in the 1980s, upon assuming management of Departamento del Espa\u00f1ol Urgente in Agencia EFE, a unit with linguistic normative designs upon the entire Hispanic world. He is best known, however, for his role in El Pensamiento Navarro; under his guidance in the late 1960s the daily was instrumental in Socialist takeover of Carlist structures. ==Family and youth== Sang\u00fcesa The Pascual family have been related to the Navarrese village of Etayo, a few kilometers from the iconic mountain of Montejurra. Though its first representative can be traced back to the 16th century,Juan Pascual, born 1573, see Carmen Aguirre, I\u00f1aki Pascual, Antepasados de Joaqu\u00edn Pascual Hermoso de Mendoza, [in:] aguirrepascual service 2013, available here none of his descendants made their name in the history of the region. Javier Mar\u00eda's paternal grandfather, Genaro Pascual Subir\u00e1n, was a local peasant;\"mi padre [...] iba para labrador como su padre y el padre de su padre\", quoted after Rosa Marina Errea Iribas, Javier Maria Pascual y El Pensamiento Navarro: \"con \u00e9l llego el esc\u00e1ndalo\" (1966-1970), Pamplona 2007, , p. 47; name of his grandfather after Aguirre, Pascual 2013 he married a girl from nearby Lorca,now part of the city of Estella Severina Hermoso de Mendoza.Aguirre, Pascual 2013 Their son and the father of Javier Mar\u00eda, Hern\u00e1n Pascual Hermoso de Mendoza, was the first one to leave Etayo; having studied medicine and recording what was described by his son as a triumphal achievement,\"por pura casualidad \u00a1hay que ver los nombres que se inventan para non llamar a Dios por el suyo!\", quoted after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 47 he became a doctor. In the 1920s Hern\u00e1n Pascual settled in Sang\u00fcesa, in the Navarrese Prepirineos. He was member of Cuerpo de Inspectores Municipales de SanidadBolet\u00edn Oficial de la Provincia de Oviedo 20 (1929), available here and practiced as a physician in the area;Anuario de Comercia, Industria, Profesiones y Tributaci\u00f3n del Pais Vasco 1930, p. 338, available here he is recorded in the living memory as \"muy bueno\".Moises Sola Mach\u00edn, La comadrona, el m\u00e9dico y el practicante, [in:] Sanguesa, La Que Nunca Olvid\u00f3 service, available here None of the sources consulted provides any information on his wife and Javier Mar\u00eda's mother, Mar\u00eda Iba\u00f1ez; her son remembers her as extremely hard-working and devout.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 47 Escuela Oficial de Periodismo matriculation certificate, 1958 Javier Mar\u00eda and his 3 sisters were brought up in a fervently Catholic ambience; one of them became a nun. He was first educated in the Jesuit colleges in Durango, Javier, and Tudela,Errea Iribas 2007, p. 45 narrowly evading expulsion as his independent character caused conflict and controversy.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 50 Upon bachillerato, obtained in 1951, the Jesuits suggested that he enters a novitiate; himself he was rather tempted to pursue his knack for letters. However, Javier Mar\u00eda's parents were skeptical and persuaded him to study law. Pascual was not at all enthusiastic, but he appreciated the advantages offered by juridical culture; he moved to the capital and enrolled at Facultad de Derecho of the Madrid University. He completed the curriculum and graduated at unspecified time, most likely in the mid-1950s.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 56, 256 He did not give up his juvenile penchant; in 1954 he joined the Madrid-based Escuela Oficial de Periodismo,Errea Iribas 2007, p. 45, Manuel Martorell P\u00e9rez, La continuidad ideol\u00f3gica del carlismo tras la Guerra Civil [PhD thesis in Historia Contemporanea, Universidad Nacional de Educaci\u00f3n a Distancia], Valencia 2009, p. 383 becoming an officially licensed press journalist later on.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 56; for detailed discussion of the establishment, see Alicia Tapia L\u00f3pez, Las primeras ense\u00f1anzas de documentaci\u00f3n en periodismo, [in:] Documentaci\u00f3n de las Ciencias de la Informaci\u00f3n 24 (2001), pp. 231-253 It is not clear whether before moving to Madrid Pascual started contributing to the Navarrese press, especially that two of his relatives wrote to Pamplona periodicals and held admin positions in the local newspaper realm.Joaqu\u00edn Arbeloa Galdeano and Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual Visner During the academic period he was already noted as a Madrid envoy of two key Pamplona dailies, Diario de Navarra and El Pensamiento Navarro; some time afterwards he commenced contributing also to journals elsewhere, sending correspondence from the capital to La Gaceta del Norte (Bilbao) and El Correo Catal\u00e1n (Barcelona).Mediterr\u00e1neo 24.07.70, available here At unclear position he was also involved in a technical corporate periodical Informaci\u00f3n de la Publicidad.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 56, also Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, periodista, [in:] El Pais 14.12.98, available here At unspecified time but prior to the mid-1960s Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual married Mar\u00eda Rosa Figueroa Oterm\u00edn. The couple lived mostly in Madrid, though in the second half of the 1960s they resided in Pamplona. They had 8 children, 4 sons and 4 daughters;ABC 14.12.98, available here none of them became a public figure recognized nationwide. ==Early public career== AET logotype There were both Falangist and Carlist antecedents among Pascual's close family. He admitted great influence of a maternal relative, Joaqu\u00edn Arbeloa,Joaqu\u00edn Arbeloa Galdeano (1910-1979), Errea Iribas 2007, p. 47; see also Mediterr\u00e1neo 28.06.79, available here, Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Joaqu\u00edn Arbeloa Galdeano entry, [in:] Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia online, available here during early Francoism an emerging star in Navarrese historiographyhis opus magnum, Los or\u00edgenes del Reino de Navarra, was published in 3 volumes in 1969 and journalism, co-founder of combative Falangistdubbed \"la revista negra de la Falange\", also \"Gu\u00eda nacionalsindicalista del Imperio, de la Sabidur\u00eda, de los Oficios\", Juan Mar\u00eda Lecea Y\u00e1bar, Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual (1911-1947), [in:] Pr\u00edncipe de Viana 215 (1998), p. 861 review Jerarqu\u00eda and in the 1940s contributor to Diario de Navarra.Ainhoa Arozamena Ayala, Joaqu\u00edn Arbeloa Galdeano entry, [in:] Au\u00f1amendi Eusko Entziklopedia online Javier Mar\u00eda remained indebtedErrea Iribas 2007, p. 23 also to a paternal relativein 1954 he called him \"uncle\" (\"Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual es mi t\u00edo\"), quoted after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 48. As Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual died in 1947 it is not clear whether the present tense used was licencia poetica or the alleged 1954 date of the document is incorrect. Also exact family relationship between the two remains to be established Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual,Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual Visner (1911-1947) a Falangist old-shirt, president of Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa de Pamplona, a poet and a correspondent of Navarrese and national newspapers.Lecea Y\u00e1bar 1998, p. 870; as author he is known mostly for his Falangist heroic and lyrical opus magnum, Amadis (Madrid, Espasa Calpe, 1943), \"novela de tendencia anti- realista en la que acomoda el mito literario caballeresco a la historia coet\u00e1nea\", see Carlos Mata Indura\u00edn, Semblanza de Angel Mar\u00eda Pascual (1911-1947), [in:] Insula Bara\u00f1aria blog 2012, available here On the other hand, Javier Mar\u00eda's father was a vehement CarlistErrea Iribas 2007, p. 49 and his paternal uncle, Jos\u00e9 Manuel Pascual Hermoso de Mendoza,born 1902 and ordained in 1929, Jaime del Burgo, Catalogo bio-bibliografico, Pamplona 1954, p. 428 was an iconic movement's figure; former Requet\u00e9 chaplain, he served as a parish priest first in Etayo and then in Pamplona,in the prestigious parish of San Francisco Javier active also as leader of a Traditionalist ex-combatant religious organization.he was the moving spirit behind the first Javierada, a male pilgrimage to Javier organized by Hermandad Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, Jos\u00e9 Fermin Garralda Arizcun, La primera Javierada: 10 de marzo de 1940, [in:] Navarra y Pamplona service 27.02.15, available here, Javier Baleztena Abarrategui, Fundaci\u00f3n de la Hermandad de Caballeros Voluntarios de la Cruz, [in:] Prem\u00edn de Iru\u00f1a blog 10.02.15, available here Having arrived in Madrid in the mid-1950s Pascual approached students of Traditionalist heritage, grouped in semi-legal AET.Manuel Martorell P\u00e9rez, Carlos Hugo frente a Juan Carlos. La soluci\u00f3n federal para Espa\u00f1a que Franco rechaz\u00f3, Madrid 2014, , p. 46. Pascual did not hold roles in the AET executive, but some scholars count him among \"grupo de la direcci\u00f3n de la AET\", Josep Miralles Climent, Estudiantes y obreros carlistas durante la dictadura franquista. La AET, el MOT y la FOS, Madrid 2007, , p. 44 He perfectly fit their typical profile, \"de procedencia rural o de peque\u00f1as ciudades no demasiado urbanizadas, cat\u00f3licos, mon\u00e1rquicos y legitimistas\".as described later by the group leader, Ram\u00f3n Mass\u00f3, quoted after Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 384; a different profiling is offered by Jos\u00e9 Antonio Parilla, who claims that Pascual was an exception since he was the only one holding Carlist ancestors, Javier Lavard\u00edn [Jos\u00e9 Antonio Parilla], Historia del ultimo pretendiente a la corona de Espa\u00f1a, Paris 1976, p. 48 In their provincial towns brought up in Traditionalist ambience but enjoying autonomy of students living in a huge city, they were not particularly concerned with the doctrine and looked for a new format of Carlism.Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, pp. 383-4 With a new mid-1950s pro- collaborationist turn of the party the youth benefitted the most: the regime permitted launch of AET-controlled periodicals La EncinaLa Encina was an ephemerical periodical with 6 issues only, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2014, p. 119; others claim there were 5 issues before La Encina was closed by the authorities, Miralles Climent 2007, p. 39. Pascual is characteristically noted as lambasting those who \"escriben contra el comunismo y no escriben por la Justicia\", Evaristo Olcina, Prologo, [in:] Josep Miralles Climent, Estudiantes y obreros carlistas durante la dictadura franquista. La AET, el MOT y la FOS, Madrid 2007, , p. 8 and Azada y asta.the periodical was launched in 1959, but in 1960 it was released in only 3 issues; in 1961 there were 7, Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 100 Pascual was involved in both,Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 470 in 1957-58 as editor-in-chief of the formerMiralles Climent 2007, p. 39 and since 1959 of the latter.Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 443; it is not clear when he ceased as editor-in-chief, though certainly prior to late 1962, when the post was held by Rafael Navarro Dominguez, Miralles Climent 2007, p. 54 Under his guidance it grew into a platform where Traditionalism mixed with search for a new intellectual formula,using a strategy which would be frequently employed later, he equalled uncompromising stand by the Traditionalist principles as false Traditionalism and merely a stagnation, see his notes on \"posici\u00f3n est\u00e1tica de algunos que se dicen defensores de la misma [tradici\u00f3n]\", Miralles Climent 2007, p. 41 increasingly endorsing heterodoxy.Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, pp. 444-5, Lavard\u00edn 1976, pp. 101-102, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2014, p. 119 Pascual contributed himself, focusing on social and religious topics; in line with ongoing Vaticanum II preparations, he called for a new Church.he advocated that the Church gets closer to the people, assumes pro-social stand, engages in dialogue with dissidents, embraces scientific progress and modernizes the liturgy, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 451 Falling short of openly embracing liberal trends, he endorsed \"catolicismo liberal\" in \"su sentido etimol\u00f3gico y no pol\u00edtico\".Martorell P\u00e9rez 2009, p. 451, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2014, p. 126 Some of his combative pro-Carlist pieces have been noted even by the exile Republican press in France.this was the case of his 1957 contribution to El Pensamiento Navarro, titled \"From cavemen to heroes and from heroes to imbeciles\". In the article he protested and ridiculed patronising Falangist treatment of the Carlists as merely \"unos buenos chicos\", CNT 19.01.58, available here Carlist standard In the late 1950s and early 1960s Pascual kept contributing to a number of regional and national titles, including 24, a periodical issued by the Francoist student organization SEU,e.g. in 1961 he focused on poverty and underemployment among the Andalusian peasants, quoting statistical information gathered by unofficial research of parochial networks; the piece was even re-printed in Republican papers issued in Cuba, Espa\u00f1a Republicana 16.04.61, available here Imperio, a syndicalist daily,e.g. in 1959 he praised a young priest who formatted his life as service to the country and the people, Imperio 14.03.59, available here or Punta Europa, an ambitious Traditionalism-flavored Catholic monthly.animated by Lucas Mar\u00eda de Oriol y Urquijo and directed by Vicente Marrero Su\u00e1rez. Some of Pascual contributions were merely hagiographic, like an article on Carlist requet\u00e9 Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Erdoz\u00e1in, see Imperio 23.09.61, available here; some were attempts to analyse papal teachings, see Imperio 17.10.61, available here. Very much like Pascual himself, Punta Europa remained on the boundaries of tolerated heterodoxy, though unlike Pascual later on, the group steered towards integrist reactionary Catholicism, see Jos\u00e9 Carlos Mainer, Una revisi\u00f3n de la Guerra Civil: Punta Europa (1956), [in:] Francisco Javier Lorenzo Pinar (ed.), Tolerancias y fundamentalismos en la historia, Salamanca 2007, , pp. 265-280 His first major assignment was the 1961 appointment to editorial board of El Alc\u00e1zar,Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, periodista, [in:] El Pais 14.12.98, available here, ABC 13.12.98, available here a hard-line Falangist Madrid daily.from the onset El Alc\u00e1zar pursued a hardline Francoist line; loyalty to the Church, Caudillo, Falange and the military were embodied in statutory regulations: \"La orientaci\u00f3n tradicionalmente seguida por el peri\u00f3dico El Alc\u00e1zar hasta la fecha, no podr\u00e1 ser alterada sin el consentimiento de la Hermandad si se trata de los asuntos siguientes: los que se relacionan con el dogma y la disciplina de la Iglesia Cat\u00f3lica; los que afectan a la fidelidad al Caudillo de Espa\u00f1a, el General\u00edsimo Franco y a la unidad de la Patria y del Ej\u00e9rcito\", Jordi Rodr\u00edguez Virgili, La cooperativa del diario El Alc\u00e1zar (1945-1948), [in:] Historia y Comunicaci\u00f3n Social 5 (2000), p. 177. It was owned by a commercial company, Prensa y Ediciones, controlled by association of Alc\u00e1zar ex- combatants from 1936, Hermandad de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora Santa Mar\u00eda del Alc\u00e1zar, Rodr\u00edguez Virgili 2000, p. 187. With circulation slightly below 10,000 it remained one of the smaller Madrid dailies; ABC and Ya were printed in almost 100,000 copies; the circulation of Arriba, Pueblo, Madrid and Informaciones was around 30,000, Rodr\u00edguez Virgili 2000, p. 186 Pascual remained in the board during the following 5 years and in the early 1960s started to emerge as a young star of the Madrid media. His articles were getting nominated to various awards, be it Catholichis 1961 piece, titled Duro, chicos, que ten\u00e9is raz\u00f3n, was nominated to Premio de Prensa Domund, awarded by the Catholic missionary organization Domingo Mundial de las Misiones, ABC 20.12.61, available here or corporative ones;in late 1965 he was honored with the annual Premio de Prensa, Radio y Fotograf\u00eda, awarded by Feria Oficial e Internacional de Muestras de Barcelona, in the category of \"corresponsales prensa nacional\", Hoja Oficial de Provincia de Barcelona 22.11.65, available here as representative of \"prensa madrile\u00f1a\" he travelled across Spaine.g. in 1964 visiting Barcelona, Hoja Oficial de Provincia de Barcelona 08.06.64, available here and abroad;e.g. in 1961 visiting Italy, ABC 26.97.61, available here he was honored with Cruz de Orden de Cisneros, awarded by Movimiento Nacional for meritorious civil service;Hoja Oficial del lunes 26.07.65, available here; the rank awarded was not particularly high and did not bring with it any tangible benefits, compare blasoneshispanicos service, available here last but not least, he started to appear on TV as a guest pundit,ABC 23.03.65, available here, ABC 08.06.65, available here invited among chief editors of major dailies.ABC 22.12.65, available here ==El Pensamiento Navarro== Carlist meeting, 1966 In the mid-1960s Carlism was increasingly but not openly divided between the reactionary Traditionalists, standing by ultra-conservative principles, and those seeking a progressist formula, soon known as Hugocarlistas. Though intellectual leader of the latter and Pascual's mentor Ram\u00f3n Mass\u00f3Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 274 abandoned politics, his AET-entourage continued the campaign to gain control of key positions in the party. Supported by the Carlist heir-to-the-throne Don Carlos Hugo, in 1966 they ensured Pascual's nomination to manager of the semi-official Carlist mouthpiece, El Pensamiento Navarro.Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 274. It is not clear whether the former manager of El Pensamiento Navarro, Francisco L\u00f3pez Sanz, was dismissed or talked into resignation (perhaps on the basis of his advanced age, as he completed 70 in 1966) It is not clear whether the Traditionalists realized the plot; officially they wholeheartedly endorsed Pascual.an iconic person of Pamplona Traditionalism, Joaqu\u00edn Baleztena, delivered a warm welcome address, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 56. Also, when at one point it appeared that the resigning pro-Juanista members of the board would be able to suggest their successors, Ignacio Baleztena ensured that instead it would be Pascual coming out with the proposals, Mercedes V\u00e1zquez de Prada, El final de una ilusi\u00f3n. Auge y declive del tradicionalismo carlista (1957-1967), Madrid 2016, , p. 304. According to some accounts, it seems that Pascual, a determined supporter of Don Javier, might have been seconded to El Pensamiento by Valiente with the specific task of eradicating pro-Juanista feelings, visible in the daily, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 80 Due to lack of funds Pascual failed to launch technological overhaul of antiquated newspaper;Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 72-76 he made it look more agile by re-arranging the layout,Errea Iribas 2007, p. 248. The newspaper was issued in the format known in Spain as asabanado (broadsheet), broken into 7 columns, with abundant graphics and entirely in black and white, except extraordinary days when red was introduced, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 250. Its circulation in the late 1960s was 12,500, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 437 introducing new columnse.g. Plaza Mayor, Gente que Cuenta, Consideraciones para navarros, Cada semana un tema (in 1969 replaced by Le\u00eddo para Ustedes) and Cr\u00f3nica de Madrid, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 245, 247, 249 and bringing in new staff.the key one was Jos\u00e9 Carlos Clemente, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 251; known also under Catalan version of his name as Josep Carles Clemente, in the 1970s and 1980s he grew to key Hugocarlista historiographer and propagandist, until today author of countless books on Carlism The key change, however, was de-emphasizing Traditionalism and saturating the pages with novel democratic ideas of the Hugocarlistas.according to one scholar, at that time Pascual was \"helped\" to re-orient El Pensamiento by Masso, who at that time lived in Pamplona, V\u00e1zquez de Prada 2016, p. 282 The editorial line championed by Pascual avoided open confrontation.e.g. following the 1968 ousting of Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Valiente, the last Traditionalist leader of Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista, Pascual hailed him in an apologetic farewell article, see El Pensamiento Navarro 24.01.68, referred after Francisco Javier Caspistegui Gorasurreta, El naufragio de las ortodoxias. El carlismo, 1962\u20131977, Pamplona 1997; , p. 127. The same year he kept publishing flattering photographs of Joaqu\u00edn Baleztena, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 220 To the contrary, the change was styled as renovating Carlist thought; he presented Carlism not as a fixed doctrine but rather as a dynamic approach.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 197-8 Key elements of this strategy were highlighting two pillars of the movement's ideological toolset: unswerving loyalty to the Carlist dynastywhen assuming his duties Pascual highlighted his total loyalty to the Borbon-Parmas (Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 59-60); he kept highlighting dynastic issues when commenting on ongoing events like Ley Organica referendum (El Pensamiento Navarro 15.12.66, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 88-9) or Montejurra gatherings (El Pensamiento Navarro 25.04.66, 03.05.67, 25.04.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 213-7), Following expulsion of the Borb\u00f3n-Parmas Pascual did his utmost to underline all calls for reverting the decision (El Pensamiento Navarro 22.12.68, 25.12.68, 28.12.69, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 172-4, 226-7), and welcomed the official nomination of Juan Carlos as the future king of Spain with deafening silence (El Pensamiento Navarro 23.07.69, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 177-9) and to the Church.Pascual consistently kept highlighting democratic and pro-social threads of Vaticanum II and focused on work of hierarchs launching own social initiavies, like Josef-Leon Cardijn. When democratic and progressive stand of the Spanish espiscopate generated a phenomenon of Right-wing anti-clericalism, Pascual stood by the hierarchs (Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 301-303, 316-7). His genuine and profound Catholicism was demonstrated during religious feasts, when El Pensamiento Navarro used to splash slogans like Viva Cristo Rey across all the columns, see e.g. El Pensamiento Navarro 27.10.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 313 As the former was getting dominated by Don Carlos Hugo and the latter were undergoing transformation adopted at Vaticanum II, the strategy worked as a trap for conservatively-minded readers; it also served as a springboard to advance increasingly Left-wing ideas. El Pensamiento Navarro (issue from the post- Pascual period) Apart from mobilizing support for the Borb\u00f3n-Parmasbacking the Borb\u00f3n-Parmas resulted in constand clashes with ABC, the pro-Juanist Madrid daily, which systematically downplayed all information related to Carlism, Don Javier or Don Carlos Hugo, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 164-8, 201, 211, 233-237, 347-391 and for labor-related changes embraced by the Church,at one point El Pensamiento Navarro has even declared itself a \"syndicalist newspaper\", El Pensamiento Navarro 21.01.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 103; the daily voiced in favor of a new Ley Sindical which would empower Catholic trade unions, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 120-144 other key thread of the newspaper was support for de-centralised organisation of state;the article \u00a1Viva Guip\u00fazcoa Foral! produced administrative measures against the newspaper, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 287-9. In line with the Orthodox Carlist understanding, Pascual confessed love for \"las Espa\u00f1as\" (not \"Espa\u00f1a\"), El Pensamiento Navarro 15.07.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 245 this, however, has never amounted to endorsing separatism of peripheral nationalisms, which Pascual vehemently opposed.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 249, 336; he declared that \"el separatismo es rid\u00edculo\" and that \"el racismo es anticristiano\", Errea Iribas 2007, p. 273. In 1968 Pascial supported Estado de Excepci\u00f3n in Gipuzkoa, El Pensamiento Navarro 09.06.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 309-10, even to the point of viewing Generalitat a result of extremism, El Pensamiento Navarro 19.04.66. He acknowledged Basque nationalist vandalism affecting Traditionalist monuments as cowardice and barbarity, El Pensamiento Navarro 24.03.67, 11.04.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 307 Though supportive of creeping democratization,e.g. advocating \"monarqu\u00eda popular\" ( Errea Iribas 2007, p. 84) or supporting Carlist deputies from Tercio Familiar and the entire Cortes Trashumantes sittings (Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 92-120) Pensamiento avoided open challenge of either Franco or Francoismsome authors claim that \"durante su labor al frente de la publicaci\u00f3n [Pascual] se hab\u00eda mostrado muy cr\u00edtico con el sistema franquista\", Ferm\u00edn P\u00e9rez-Nievas Borderas, Contra viento y marea. Historia de la evoluci\u00f3n ideol\u00f3gica del carlismo a trav\u00e9s de dos siglos de lucha, Pamplona 1999, , p. 186 and \u2013 perhaps to some extent genuinelyPascual was perfectly aware of the linguistic subtleties involved. In 1961 he published an article, which was a laboratory and ice-cold analysis of Francoist language employed with regard to the 1936-1939 events; specifically, it focused on linguistic manipulations aimed at promoting the term \"cruzada\" and denying existence of a \"civil war\", see Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, Criba y comentarios: negaci\u00f3n y defensa del 18 de julio como cruzada, [in:] Punta Europa 62 (1961), pp. 112-123 \u2013 boasted fidelity to \"the spirit of July 18th\".El Pensamiento Navarro was many times hailing \"Jefe del Estado, General Franco, que supo conducir a la victoria al Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional, a los heroicos Tercios de Requet\u00e9s, a las tambi\u00e9n heroicas Banderas de Falange\", adding also that \"queremos reafirmar nuestra fe en los principios de aqu\u00e9l 18 de julio de 1936\", see e.g. El Pensamiento Navarro 01.10.67, quoted after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 170 Calls for liberalization were styled as defense of the very regime,see e.g. shielding the new press law from critique of foreign commentators, El Pensamiento Navarro 09.04.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 114 official auto-denomination of the state as \"Monarqu\u00eda Trad\u00edcional, Cat\u00f3lica, Social y Representativa\" was repeated ad nauseam,see e.g. El Pensamiento Navarro 31,05,66 or 20.08.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 161 and Franco's own words were often quoted when presenting Carlism as representation of \"la Espa\u00f1a ideal, frente a la bastarda y afrancesada de los liberales\".El Pensamiento Navarro 22.02.66 or 01.10.67, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 159 The regime identified Pensamiento as subversive,according to Pascual El Pensamiento Navarro was the most read newspaper among the Madrid central offices employees, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 63 though it applied few inconclusive measures.after introduction of the so- called Ley Fraga in 1966 the censorship office was left rather toothless. It intervened a number of times with regard to El Pensamiento Navarro, but apart from correspondence exchange no repressive measures can be identified (see e.g. \"Director General de la Prensa ha ordenado la iniciaci\u00f3n de expediente administrativo al Director del Diario El Pensamiento Navarro\", Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 337-347). Most interventions seem related to Basque and Catalan issues. Another author identifies 7 cases, raised by the censorship office, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 332 The boldest one was a 46-day exile in Riaza,Pascual spent his time in Riaza in a hotel and under friendly tutelage of Adolfo Suarez, at that time Civil Governor of the Segovia Province (which Riaza formed part of), Errea Iribas 2007, p. 260, Nevertheless, some commentators refer to Pascual\u2019s fate in Riaza as \"gulag\", see Hoja Oficial de Lunes 06.10.80, available here administered versus Pascual in early 1969.following student and Basque unrest the State of Exception was introduced in all Spain on January 24, 1969, Stanley G. Payne, The Franco regime, London 1987, , p. 521. Pascual was detained on February 7 on orders of the Navarrese Civil Governor, and administered residence in Riaza, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2014, p. 257, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 253 and passim. No specific charges were raised, though the key motive supposed were Pascual\u2019s contacts with HOAC, the increasingly restless Catholic trade unions, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 263. The exile term expired automatically with the end of Estado de Excepci\u00f3n on March 25, 1969, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 286. Another picturesque measure was adopted against Pascual and other Carlists, travelling on a chartered plane from Seville to Biarritz to celebrate the 80th birthday of the Carlist king Don Javier in May 1969; the aircraft was made to land at Fuenterabia and all those on board were prevented from crossing the frontier, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2014, pp. 258-9 More fateful were differences with the Traditionalists controlling Editorial Navarra, a front company which owned the newspaper. Though there were no public clashes between Pascual and the board in 1966-1968,Errea Iribas 2007, p. 209. During his Riaza exile Pascual was visited by the leader of Navarrese Traditionalists Joaqu\u00edn Baleztena, who pledged to intervene in his favor, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 262 key Traditionalist pundits used to challenge Pascual's line from the very onset.already in 1966 it was Rafael Gambra, who noted \"marxismo que se va introduciendo y ante el que deb\u00eda batallar, especialmenta, su peri\u00f3dico\"; further on he admitted \"prepcupaci\u00f3n por una postura seria y consciente del peri\u00f3dico, a favor del progresismo injustificiado\", El Pensamiento Navarro 18.06.66. Pascual responded by claiming he strictly followed Vatican, Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 303-4. In 1968 another Traditionalist intellectual, Francisco El\u00edas de Tejada, embarked on a somewhat veiled polemics by confronting traditional Navarrese foral sense of liberty with a revolutionary liberty, El Penamiento Navarro 15.11.68, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 224-5. Note that Pascual allowed the articles of his critics to appear in print In the late 1960s he was already considered one of threewith Zabala and Clemente \"prohombres del neocarlismo socialista\", who presided over transformation towards Marxism.Robert Vallverd\u00fa i Mart\u00ed, La metamorfosi del carlisme catal\u00e0: del \"D\u00e9u, P\u00e0tria i Rei\" a l'Assamblea de Catalunya (1936-1975), Barcelona 2014, , p. 210 Following printing of declaration issued by Catholic syndicates,jointly named Movimientos Obreros Cristianos (and divided into HOAC, VOS and JOC) which in name of \"the working class\" lambasted \"unjust and inhuman capitalist system\",El Pensamiento Navarro 26.04.70, referred after Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 391-395 in the spring of 1970 Pascual was officially admonished by the managing board;\"for some time we have noted that the periodical deviated from Traditionalist ideas towards biased and leftist path\" (\"desde hace alg\u00fan tiempo hemos notado en el peri\u00f3dico una desviaci\u00f3n de las ideas tradicionalistas en sentido tendencioso e izquierdista\"), Errea Iribas 2007, p. 396, Josep Carles Clemente, Historia del Carlismo contemporaneo 1935\u20131972, Barcelona 1977, , p. 66. The official Carlist executive immediately protested the Editorial Navarra statement and demanded that the board members step down in July that year Editorial Navarra terminated Pascual's employment contract.on 23.07.70, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 407, P\u00e9rez-Nievas Borderas 1999, p. 186. Members of the Editorial Navarra board refused to backtrack under pressure from the Hugocarlistas; their leader, Joaqu\u00edn Baleztena, declared that they were entrusted with ensuring that El Pensamiento Navarro does not deviate from Traditionalist course (indeed in the late 1930s Editorial Navarra was set up as a front company to spare amalgamtion of the newspaper into the Francoist propaganda machine) and that this is exactly what they do, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 411. The party executive responded that it was not up to the board to decide what constituted violation of fidelity to Traditionalist principles and expulsed almost all (mostly members of the Baleztena family) board members from the Carlist structes, Errea Iribas 2007, p. 410, Clemente 1977, pp. 68-69 ==Back in Madrid: politics and around== Carlos Hugo and his wife, 1978 Pascual's dismissal came as a heavy blow for the Hugocarlistas; under his guidance El Pensamiento Navarro was \"instrumental for a new Carlist evolution\"Jordi Canal, El carlismo, Madrid 2000, , p. 374 (the author wrongly claiming that Pascual headed Pensamiento since 1967). Pascual\u2019s work was greatly appreciated by the Carlist king Don Javier. At the 1970 christening of his grandson he thanked Pascual personally and admitted that \"todas las ma\u00f1anas me dais los buenos d\u00edas. Cuando llega el correo digo siempre: dejad a un lado las cartas, que quiero El Pensamiento Navarro\", El Pensamiento Navarro 15.02.70, quoted after Errea Iribas 2007, p. 371 and together with few minor periodicalsthe other two were Montejurra and Esfuerzo Com\u00fan constituted a propaganda ram of the Progressists.Olcina 2007, p. 11 The faction immediately launched a counter- strike; they attempted to remove the Traditionalists from Editorial Navarra board, orchestrated a wave of protest letters and engineered boycott of the newspaper; the campaign climaxed in a bombing attempt.the attempt was claimed by and is usually attributed to Grupos de Acci\u00f3n Carlista, compare Clemente 1977, p. 70, though at some stage also ETA claimed responsibility, see ABC 02.01.06, available here All that proved fruitless and El Pensamiento Navarro was re-claimed by the Traditionalists, their last and ephemeral victory in the struggle to control the party; at that time the Carlist structures were already firmly dominated by the Hugocarlistas. Apart from minor role in an advisory Carlist propaganda body,in late 1968 Pascual was appointed one of 14 members of a newly set up body, Consejo Nacional de Prensa del Carlismo, advisory to Junta Suprema. Although due to his position in Pensamiento he was standing head and shoulders above all Carlists involved in the printed media, Pascual was not offered presidency, which went to Juan Jos\u00e9 Pe\u00f1a Iba\u00f1ez; Manuel Cerezales was vice-president, Clemente secretario and Alfonso Carlos Fal vice-secretary, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 133 Pascual held no political positions either in Comuni\u00f3n Tradicionalista or in a 1970-created Hugocarlista organisation, Partido Carlista.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 265 He was also no ideologue and no rally-type speaker;he did not take part in public rallies and has never spoken at Montejurra, see the list of speakers in Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, pp. 302-3 his role was chiefly about managing the faction's propaganda campaign and as such is classified as representative of \"sector m\u00e1s abierto del Carlismo\".Errea Iribas 2007, p. 344 Having left Pamplona and taken up employment in state-ran media company Pascual no longer was an asset for the party. Moreover, he developed doubts about a militantly left-bound and decreasingly religious course adopted by Partido Carlista.e.g. Jos\u00e9 Zabala claimed that Carlism did not need social teaching of the Church because it had its own, Ram\u00f3n Mar\u00eda Rod\u00f3n Guinjoan, Invierno, primavera y oto\u00f1o del carlismo (1939-1976) [PhD thesis Universitat Abat Oliba CEU], Barcelona 2015, p. 405 Though earlier he praised the party ideologue, Pedro Jos\u00e9 Zabala, as \"carlista sin lastres inncecesarios\",Rod\u00f3n Guinjoan 2015, p. 406 he later nurtured some second thoughtsCaspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 75 and corresponding with the old-time party leader Manuel Fal tended to accept at least some criticism.late 1970, commenting to Fal on memorandum of Jes\u00fas Evaristo Casariego, which defined Carlism as anti-capitalist but also anti- marxist, he noted \"me preocupa honradamente el hecho de que en algunos panfletos o memorandums \u2013 como el de Casariego, pintoresco personaje \u2013 pueda haber algo de cr\u00edtica aprovechable, que nosotros debieramos traducir en autoconfesi\u00f3n\", Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 138, compare also his letter to Fal critical about Partido Carlista, Caspistegui Gorasurreta 1997, p. 197 As a result, Pascual's relationship with Partido Carlista deteriorated, especially that co-managing a state-ran news agency in the early 1970s he could not afford demonstrating radical political sympathies. None of the sources consulted provides any information on Pascual's involvement in Partido Carlista electoral efforts of the transici\u00f3n. In 1976 he might have been involved in Progressist seizure of Carlist historical memorabilia.until the mid-1960s the Baleztena family ran a private museum of Carlism; most items on display were deposited by various individuals. From the late 1960s the collection was held by the Baleztenas and presented at various one-off displays. In 1976, following one of such events, the collection was stored in a house of Pascual's relatives in Sanguesa. During a night a team of people arrived and snatched the collection, which later emerged in possession of Partido Carlista. The Baleztenas sued but lost the case in court, Diario de Navarra 28.08.85 The last time he was identified as supporting Don Carlos Hugo was in 1978, when Pascual took part in Jornadas Carlistas de la Prensa in Madrid.Hoja Oficial del lunes 20.11.78, available here Juan Carlos, 1984 The late 1970s and the early 1980s marked full Pascual's integration within the public realm of post-Francoist Spain. In 1979 he entered the executive of Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa de MadridHoja Oficial del lunes 15.01.79, available here and \u2013 perhaps as a great fan of bullfightingABC 22.08.78, available here \u2013 was appointed head of its Comisi\u00f3n de Festejos.Hoja Oficial del lunes 02.07.79, available here Taking part in a number of corporative debatesespecially the one of the early 1980s related to status of Hoja Oficial del lunes, the only daily permitted to appear on Mondays and owned by Asociaci\u00f3n de Prensa, Hoja Oficial del lunes 06.10.79, available here; monopoly of the paper was challenged by a new daily named Diario16, and conflict with this periodical soon spilled over to cover also the question of covering the attempted coup of 1981; corporative press organisations charged Diario16 with publishing speculations about journalists who might have participated in the plot, see Hoja Oficial del lunes 25.10.82, available here; in 1983 he grew to vice-secretary of AdP.Hoja Oficial del lunes 25.04.83, available here His career in the Asociaci\u00f3n came to an abrupt end in 1984, marking also completion of his dynastical U-turn. Protesting against what he perceived as a TVE insult to king Juan Carlos, he resigned from all functions in the corporative associationthe official Spanish broadcaster, TVE, ignored the bullfight organized in Madrid by Asociaci\u00f3n de Prensa and Pascual personally as head of its Comisi\u00f3n de Festejos, even though the event was attended by king Juan Carlos, and decided to broadcast another bullfight taking place at the same time in Albacete, ABC 10.07.84, available here, also ABC 09.07,84, available here. Pascual\u2019s dynastical U-turn from Carlism to Juanism was even more visible as ABC, the Juanista newspaper he continuously confronted in the late 1960s, started to hail him as \"one of most prestigious men of Spanish journalism\", ABC 10.07.84, available here \\- which did not prevent him from nurturing \"gran sentimiento\" towards the memory of his former Carlist monarch, Don Javier.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 443. Until his death Pascual kept collecting and editing wartime letters of Requetes from Sanguesa; he intended to publish them, the task he did not live to complete, Pablo Larraz And\u00eda, V\u00edctor Sierra-Ses\u00famaga Ariznabarreta, Requet\u00e9s: de las trincheras al olvido, Madrid 2011, , p. 24 What did not change was Pascual's opposition to Basque separatism.presented among \"personalidades navarras\", in 1979 Pascual protested Herri Batasuna designs on Navarre and claimed that \"Navarra es el mismisimo quicio de Espa\u00f1a\", ABC 19.08.79, available here Though he fully supported new democratic media legislation,Hoja Oficial del lunes 12.05.80, available here in the late 1980s Pascual publicly demonstrated some unease about what he considered blasphemous threads in the free Spanish media.ABC 03.03.88, available here ==Agencia EFE== EFE logotype Upon return to Madrid Pascual was employed in the central office of Agencia EFE, the official Spanish news agency.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 443 It is not clear what his role in the company structures was in the early 1970s; according to one source he worked as redactor-jefe, a senior editor responsible for news released during his shift. Already at that time he was a respected figure in the world of Madrid media; in 1973 he was among the first ones to move into the co-called Ciudad de los Periodistas, a complex of five high-rise residential buildings commissioned by Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa, in the 21st century still dubbed \"the best place to live in Madrid\".Alvaro Santamar\u00eda, Ernest Hothorn, Ciudad de los Periodistas: El mejor sitio para vivir en Madrid, [in:] asesorator service 25.05.07 As Pascual was redactor-jefe during the night Franco died, it was he who determined how the news was disseminated.V\u00edctor Olmos, Historia de la Agencia EFE: El Mundo en Espa\u00f1ol, Madrid 1997, , see especially Part IV, Chapter 36, Franco ha muerto, pp. 389\u2013400 At unspecified time though prior to mid-1979 he rose to executive of Secci\u00f3n de Informaci\u00f3n Nacional and subdirector of the entire agency;ABC 19 August 1979, Martorell P\u00e9rez 2014, p. 303 in 1981 he was nominated manager of national section of EFE. In the early 1980s EFE created Departamento del Espa\u00f1ol Urgente (DEU), a sub-unit dedicated mostly to quality assurance; its focus was on language and style used by the agency, with three key tasks specified.\"1) Procurar que el periodismo, en sus formas oral y escrita, emplee un idioma correcto, aceptable y normalizado en todas sus manifestaciones. 2) Contribuir, por este medio, a la defensa y unidad del espa\u00f1ol en todos los pa\u00edses de lengua espa\u00f1ola. 3) Resolver con la m\u00e1xima rapidez los problemas que plantea a los profesionales la adopci\u00f3n de neologismos y evitar la invasi\u00f3n indiscriminada, con vistas a que la soluci\u00f3n propuesta, una vez aceptada por la Comisi\u00f3n Asesora, sea sancionada por la RAE y la Asociaci\u00f3n de la Lengua\", Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, Alberto G\u00f3mez Font, Pedro Garc\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez, El Departamento de Espa\u00f1ol Urgente, tareas y programas, [in:] El idioma espa\u00f1ol en las agencias de prensa, Madrid 1990, p. 105 Pascual was nominated head of DEU; at this job he shaped its modus operandi and prioritized work, presiding over Comisi\u00f3n PermanenteFund\u00e9u-BBVA: el largo brazo de la RAE en los medios, [in:] Addenda & Corrigenda 09.05.12, available here and co-operating with Comisi\u00f3n Asesora. It is not clear whether, apart from typical managerial tasks, his role was also about providing actual linguistic and editorial expertise;the experts tasked with day-to-day assessment were Pedro Garc\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez, Alberto G\u00f3mez Font and Carlos Ramirez Dampierre (since 1988 Pilar Vicho Toledo), Franz Lebsanft, Spanische Sprachkultur: Studien zur Bewertung und Pflege des \u00f6ffentlichen Sprachgebrauchs im heutigen Spanien, Tubingen 1997, , pp. 188 however, he clearly emerged as leader of a unit set up as high authority on Spanish language, with normative role across EFE branches worldwidesince 1981 the usual Manual de estilo, issued periodically by EFE, were replaced by Manual de espa\u00f1ol urgente, Lebsanft 1997, p. 195 and exercising influence on the entire Hispanic realm.Lebsanft 1997, pp. 188, 223 At this position Pascual tackled heterogeneity of Spanish as used worldwide and led the drive to introduce a global standard, to be shaped mostly by Madrid and adopted across all Hispanic community.compare one of the objectives of DEU: \"contribuir, por este medio, a la defensa y unidad del espa\u00f1ol en todos los pa\u00edses de lengua espa\u00f1ola\", Pascual, Garc\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez, G\u00f3mez Font 1990, p. 105 hq (2nd from right), Madrid Pascual continued as one of EFE subdirectors and head of DEU across the 1980s. Due to his role he interfaced with a number of institutions, including Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola, e.g. when championing his homogeneity drive and attempting to set up Fundaci\u00f3n para la Defensa de la Lengua Espa\u00f1ola;Silvia Senz Bueno, El largo brazo de la RAE en los medios, [in:] Rebeli\u00f3n 9 May 2012, available here he also took part in a number of linguistic and educational initiatives. Apart from having been responsible for periodical updates of EFE's Manual of Style, he edited and co-edited a number of EFE publications,Pascual, Garc\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez, G\u00f3mez Font 1990, pp. 99-121 the best-known of them El neologismo necesario (1992).Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, Alberto G\u00f3mez Font, Pedro Garc\u00eda Dom\u00ednguez, Pilar Vicho Toledo (eds.), El neologismo necesario, Madrid 1992, For reasons which are not clear in 1992 he ceased as head of the unit, at that time renamed Departamento de Control de Publicaci\u00f3n y An\u00e1lisis de Estilo of EFE. The motive might have been his poor health; in 1994 he was already noted for frequent absence on sittings of the EFE boards.Carlos G. Reigosa (ed.), El idioma espa\u00f1ol en el deporte, Madrid 1994, p. 251. It is not clear whether Pascual's ailing health was anyhow related to a serious car accident he suffered in Pamplona in 1967. A car he drove collided with a truck and Pascual sustained very heavy injuries. ==Academic== Facultad de Ciencias de la Informaci\u00f3n, Complutense Already in Pamplona in the late 1960s Pascual tried his hand as an academic; his old-time mentor Mass\u00f3, at that time teaching at the Opus Dei managed Universidad de Navarra, arranged for Pascual to be invited to give lectures at Escuela de Periodismo, a freshly established section of the university.Errea Iribas 2007, pp. 62, 358 The co-operation was terminated once Pascual left Navarre, though rumors about the Opus Dei link continued.Lavard\u00edn 1976, p. 102 Once in Madrid he decided to upgrade his scientific credentials and commenced doctoral research, with focus on media in works of the Second Vatican Council. The thesis, written under the guidance of Pedro Lombard\u00edaErrea Iribas 2007, p. 362 and titled Trayectoria doctrinal del Concilio Vaticano II sobre la comunicaci\u00f3n y sus medios, was accepted cum laude at Universidad Complutense in 1973.Errea Iribas 2007, p. 443. Some sources wrongly claim that he wrote the thesis in the late 1950s, compare El Pa\u00eds 14.12.98, available here. Inspection of the book, published on the basis of the thesis, reveals that it deals mostly with Vaticanum II, which took place in the mid-1960s, compare here A few years later it was published as Los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n social en la doctrina de la Iglesia;Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, Los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n social en la doctrina de la Iglesia, Madrid 1976, in the prologue it was boasted as \"la monografia m\u00e1s completa que existe \u2013 y no s\u00f3lo en castellano\".Angel Benito, Prologo, [in:] Javier Mar\u00eda Pascual, Los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n social en la doctrina de la Iglesia, Madrid 1976, , p. 9 The reception abroad was rather lukewarm; the critics challenged both methodological basis and conclusions.\"Il titolo di questo studio [...] promette molto pi\u00fa del suo contenuto efettivo, che, infatti, si limita ai dodici anni intercorsi tra il decreto conciliare Inter mirifica (1959-\u201963) e l\u2019istruzione pastorale Communio et progressio (1971). Ignorando quanto da altri, e molto meglio, e stato publicato, nel Pr\u00f3logo A. Benito lo presenta come \u2018la monografia pi\u00fa complete che esista\u2019 in argomento, documentalissima ed altamente scientifica; quando, in realt\u00e0, discutibilissimi ne sono i criteri di ricerca e di analisi. In particolare sono da segnalare tre opinioni- interpretazioni erronee dell\u2019A[uthor]: quella di un\u2019istruzione pastorale venuta a correggere ed a migliorare un decreto conciliare; quella di un diritto all\u2019informazione che non avrebbe quali soggetti diretti e primari i recettori; e, infine, quella di una fuorviante accezione di \u2018stampa onesta\u2019 e \u2018stampa cattolica\u2019\", Enrico Baragli, Javier Maria Pascual, Los medios de comunicaci\u00f3n social en la doctrina de la Iglesia [review], [in:] La Civilta cattolica 3085 (1979), pp. 102-103 Already as a PhD in 1973 Pascual was invited to join the newly created Facultad de Ciencias de Informaci\u00f3n at Universidad Complutense; he kept teaching there until the mid-1980s. In the late 1970s, when employed as professor adjunto contrado, he was among key figures at the faculty; he vehemently opposed plans to re-format the unit, which would de-emphasize its scientific role and turn it into sort of a job centre, offering specialized courses to students.\"la reduccion de las Facultades de Ciencias de la Informaci\u00f3n a simples centros superiores en los que se impartieran solamente dos cursos de especializaci\u00f3n, me parece un error de consecuencias perniciosas para la formaci\u00f3n de futuros informadores, un paso atr\u00e1s il\u00f3gico y una medida inmotivada\", ABC 10.03.77, available here In the 1980s he rose to a regular professor titular numerario; at that time he was already heading Departamento de Redacci\u00f3n Periodistica.Recursos Humanos an Investigaci\u00f3n y Desarrollo, vol. 1 (Universidades y CSIC), Madrid 1986, , p. 103 Taking advantage of his role in the realm of Madrid media, he acted in- between Facultad de Ciencias de la Informaci\u00f3n and Asociaci\u00f3n de la Prensa, arranging internship schemes for students.Hoja Oficial del lunes 19.09.83, available here In 1986 Pascual signed a Professor Titular contract with San Pablo CEU, a Catholic educational establishment at that time in transition between Colegio Universitario, affiliated at Complutense, and a stand-alone high education institution. Joining Facultad de Periodismo, he remained head of its Departamento de Redacci\u00f3n Period\u00edstica until death. CEU San Pablo, main entrance Apart from official academic realm, Pascual remained moderately involved also in semi-scientific educational initiatives sponsored by different institutions, though primarily by the Church.
