    "text": "Bradley Gaskin (born in Gadsden, Alabama, United States) is an American country music singer-songwriter. He signed with Columbia Nashville in 2011 and has released his debut single, \"Mr. Bartender\" after being discovered through a talent contest sponsored by John Rich. At the time, Gaskin had been working for his father hanging sheetrock. The song entered the Hot Country Songs charts at number 51 on the chart dated for the week ending April 2, 2011. He made his Grand Ole Opry debut on August 20, 2011. After a corporate restructuring, Gaskin moved to Columbia Records to release his second single, \"Diamonds Make Babies\". On June 4, 2012, it was announced that Sony Nashville was retiring the BNA label and moving its roster to Columbia Nashville. Gaskin was dropped from the label following this move. Gaskin spent much of 2012 touring with Big & Rich, typically performing \"Mr. Bartender\" as well as a cover of Keith Whitley's \"Don't Close Your Eyes\". Gaskin had plans for releasing a version of the Keith Whitley song prior to the problems that arose with his label. Gaskin wrote a Tate Stevens \"Power of a Love Song\" in 2013. Bradley performed \"Don't Close Your Eyes\" during a Grand Ole Opry performance on October 30, 2015. ==Discography== ===Extended plays=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! style=\"width:18em;\"| Details |- ! scope=\"row\"| Bradley Gaskin | * Release date: April 10, 2012 * Label: Columbia Nashville |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Year ! rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:14em;\"| Single ! colspan=\"1\"| Peak positions ! rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- style=\"font-size:smaller;\" ! width=\"65\"| US Country |- | 2011 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Mr. Bartender\" | 32 | rowspan=\"2\"| Bradley Gaskin |- | 2012 ! scope=\"row\"| \"Diamonds Make Babies\" | \u2014 |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"font- size:8pt\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart |- |} ===Music videos=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" !
