    "text": "Football Dreams is a novel by the American writer David Guy. Set in the 1960s, it tells the coming-of-age story of Dan Keith as he negotiates the demands of American football culture at Arnold Academy, a fictional all-boys prep school in suburban Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Largely autobiographical, the novel's depiction of life at Arnold Academy thinly veils the author's real-life experiences at his own alma mater, Shady Side Academy, in suburban Fox Chapel. ==References== Category:1980 American novels Category:Novels set in Pittsburgh Category:American football books Category:American sports novels Category:Fiction set in the 1960s ",
