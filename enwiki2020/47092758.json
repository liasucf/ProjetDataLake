    "text": "Brain on Fire is a 2016 biographical drama film directed and written by Irish filmmaker Gerard Barrett. The film is based on Susannah Cahalan's memoir Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness and stars Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Jenny Slate, Thomas Mann, Tyler Perry, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Richard Armitage. The film follows a New York Post writer who begins to suffer a mysterious illness. After being evaluated extensively by many doctors, she was diagnosed to be psychotic. She would have been committed to psychiatric ward in a hospital and probably died of encephalitis, if it weren't for the efforts and skills of a Syrian-American neurologist (Souhel Najjar). He empathized with her case, was able to diagnose and treat her rare illness. Principal photography began on July 13, 2015, in Vancouver, British Columbia. It had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival on September 14, 2016. The film was released on Netflix on June 22, 2018. == Plot == 21-year-old Susannah Cahalan (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) is a writer for The New York Post who lives with her new boyfriend Stephen (Thomas Mann). Susannah becomes suddenly ill, initially showing symptoms of a common flu like a cough and fatigue, but later begins presenting strange behaviour while in a trance state, such as hearing people say things they haven't said and hypersensitivity to loud noises. Over time, her behaviour becomes more and more erratic. Finally, Susannah suffers a seizure and seeks medical treatment. The doctor consulted is adamant it is down to Susannah partying too much, working too hard and not getting enough sleep. She moves in with her mother Rhona (Carrie-Anne Moss) and, after an emotional outburst, suffers another seizure, and is taken to a clinic where she undergoes an MRI. Susannah also believes she may have bipolar disorder due to her severe mood changes. Rhona struggles to care for Susannah, and she later moves in with her father Tom (Richard Armitage) and his new fianc\u00e9. During dinner one night, she becomes violent towards them while suffering another outburst, and her parents demand she is hospitalized despite the MRI, EEG, and all other tests showing normal results. In the hospital, one the doctors informs Susannah's parents she could have schizophrenia, and says that if her behaviour does not improve, she will be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. Susannah gradually becomes catatonic, and Dr. Souhel Najjar (Navid Negahban) is asked to help in investigating her case. He has Susannah draw a clock; she draws it with all of the numbers (1\u201312) on the right side of the face, leading Najjar to believe that the right hemisphere of her brain is swollen and inflamed. Najjar has her undergo a brain biopsy in order to take cells from her brain for diagnosis. Following the biopsy, it is found that Susannah has a rare disease called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, a brain inflammation, which Najjar describes as \"brain on fire\". Najjar begins treatment, which leads to a slow but full recovery of her cognitive abilities. Seven months later, Susannah is back at work. She presents her first written piece since her recovery to her boss Richard (Tyler Perry). It is well received, and he asks her to start writing a book about her experience, which she later titles 'Brain on Fire'. Before the credits, text on screen confirms Susannah Catalan was the 217th person to be diagnosed with anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, but her memoir has helped people all over the world, leading to thousands being diagnosed and treated since. She and Najjar remain close friends. == Cast == * Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz as Susannah Cahalan, a 21-year-old woman who one day wakes up in restraints in a hospital a month after suffering from a mysterious illness that doctors are unable to diagnose * Jenny Slate as Margo, a friend and co-worker * Thomas Mann as Stephen, Cahalan's boyfriend * Tyler Perry as Richard, Cahalan's boss at the New York Post * Carrie-Anne Moss as Rhona Nack, Cahalan's mother * Richard Armitage as Tom Cahalan, Cahalan's father * Navid Negahban as Dr. Souhel Najjar * Alex Zahara as Allen * Jenn MacLean-Angus as Giselle == Production == On May 1, 2014, Deadline reported that Charlize Theron had acquired the film rights to Susannah Cahalan's 2012 memoir Brain on Fire: My Month of Madness.
