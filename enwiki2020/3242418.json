    "text": "The 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat, sometimes called 28 May Revolution or, during the period of the authoritarian Estado Novo (), the National Revolution (), was a military coup of a nationalist origin, that put an end to the unstable Portuguese First Republic and initiated 48 years of authoritarian rule in Portugal. The regime that immediately resulted from the coup, the Ditadura Nacional (National Dictatorship), would be later refashioned into the Estado Novo (New State), which in turn would last until the Carnation Revolution in 1974. == Background == The chronic political instability and government's neglect of the army created opportunities for military plots. Most historians consider that the coup had vast support, including all political groups except for the Democratic Party, Portuguese Communist Party, Socialist Party, the Seara Nova group, General Confederation of Labour, and the Democratic Leftwing Republican Party. Already in 1925 there were three failed coup attempts: on 5 March (led by Filomeno da C\u00e2mara), 18 April (inspired by Sinel de Cordes and led by Raul Esteves and Filomeno da C\u00e2mara) and 19 July (led by Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas). The plotters were mostly acquitted by military court. \u00d3scar Carmona, acting as military prosecutor of the 18 April plot, asked that the plotters be absolved. During the trial, \u00d3scar Carmona famously asked: > \"Why do these men sit in the defendant bench? Because their homeland is sick > and orders its best sons to be judged and tried.\" - \u00d3scar Carmona The leaders of the 18 April plot were sent to the Nossa Senhora da Gra\u00e7a Fort, in which they took the opportunity to further the plot, adding the Fort's commander, Passos e Sousa, to the rebel forces. The officers decided on General Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa to lead the movement, who agreed to join the plotters on 25 May.Tom Gallagher, Portugal: A Twentieth-century Interpretation, 1983, p. 62. On 27 May, General Manuel de Oliveira Gomes da Costa arrived at Braga with the purpose of initiating a coup d'\u00e9tat. The First Portuguese Republic and Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Maria da Silva, knowing of the forthcoming coup, tried to organize resistance -- believing an eventual coup d'\u00e9tat could be defeated. == Coup == The revolution started in Braga, commanded by General Manuel Gomes da Costa, followed immediately in Porto, Lisbon, \u00c9vora, Coimbra and Santar\u00e9m. Generals Sinel de Cordes, Filomeno da C\u00e2mara, Passos e Sousa, and Raul Esteves also took part in the coup, leading the provincial military forces. Initially believing he failed, Gomes da Costa announced his surrender. ==Aftermath== On 30 May, President Bernardino Machado appoints Jos\u00e9 Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas as head of government and minister of every ministry and on the following day transfers his powers, as president, to Cabe\u00e7adas. On 6 June, General Gomes da Costa marched on Lisbon's Avenida da Liberdade along with 15,000 men, being acclaimed by the people of the city. Five days later, on 11 June, Cabe\u00e7adas' units in Santar\u00e9m demobilize. On 17 June, Gomes da Costa mobilizes his units and demands Cabe\u00e7adas' resignation. Cabe\u00e7ada does resign and transfers his powers to Gomes da Costa. Gomes da Costa then tries to get the ministers associated with Sinel de Cordes to resign. Yet, on 8 June a group of generals and colonels try to get Gomes da Costa to accept a formal position of President, but he declines and is imprisoned on the following day. Two days later he is deported to the Azores. General \u00d3scar Carmona is appointed head of government and the Ditadura Nacional begins. == Timeline == *29 May: **The Portuguese Communist Party interrupted its Second Congress due to the political and military situation in the country. **The Confedera\u00e7\u00e3o Geral do Trabalho (General Confederation of Labour) declared its neutrality in all military confrontations. **The 28.5.26 coup d'\u00e9tat spread to the rest of the country -- influenced Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas, Sinel de Cordes and \u00d3scar Carmona -- and established the Ditadura Militar (National Military Dictatorship) against the democratic but unstable First Portuguese Republic. **The Government of Prime Minister Ant\u00f3nio Maria da Silva resigned. *30 May: **The General Gomes da Costa was acclaimed in Porto. **The president of the republic, Bernardino Machado, resigned. **Jos\u00e9 Mendes Cabe\u00e7adas J\u00fanior became Prime Minister and President of the Republic. *3 June: Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar became Minister of Finance; however, he resigned 16 days after. *3 June: A dictatorial decree dissolved the Congress of the Republic of Portugal (National Assembly). *In addition, by dictatorial decree, the leaders of all the Municipalities were sacked. *The Ditadura Militar banned the Carbon\u00e1ria. *The Ditadura Militar banned all Political parties. *17 June: General Gomes da Costa provoked a second coup d'\u00e9tat. *19 June: General Gomes da Costa became Prime Minister. *22 June: The Ditadura Militar instituted Censorship. *29 June: General Gomes da Costa became President of the Republic. *9 July: **The Ditadura Militar forced General Gomes da Costa to resign -- allowing him to go into exile. **General Ant\u00f3nio \u00d3scar de Fragoso Carmona, of the conservative military wing of the Ditadura Militar, became Prime Minister. *15 September: A military coup d'\u00e9tat failed. *18 September: Another military coup d'\u00e9tat failed. *29 November: General Ant\u00f3nio \u00d3scar Carmona became President of the Republic. *16 December: The Ditadura Militar created a political police called Police of Information of Lisbon. ==References== 1926 Coup D Etat Category:1926 in Portugal Category:Conflicts in 1926 Coup d'\u00e9tat 1926 Coup d'\u00e9tat 1926 1926 Coup d'\u00e9tat 1926 Coup d'\u00e9tat Coup d'\u00e9tat 1926 Category:May 1926 events Category:1920s coups d'\u00e9tat and coup attempts ",
