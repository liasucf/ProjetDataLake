He played college football at Montana. ==Early life and high school== Olson first began playing football in second grade, primarily playing right tackle on the offensive line and sometimes played fullback. He was bullied in middle school for being overweight, and developed an eating disorder, was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and contemplated suicide. As a freshman at Cascade Christian High School, Olson was cut from the football team. He tried out for the basketball, baseball and tennis teams. By his senior year, he was three-time captain on the football team and helped lead Cascade Christian to a state championship. He posted 135 tackles, including 11 for loss, three interceptions, seven passes defensed, one sack, one forced fumble and a defensive touchdown. Olson committed to Montana over an offer from Cal Poly. ==College career== Olson redshirted his freshman season and mainly played on the scout team and special teams. He earned Montana\u2019s special teams player of the year as a sophomore. He became a starter on defense in 2018 and he made 151 tackles, earning seven All-American honors and finished third in voting for the FCS defensive player of the award.

Olson participated in the East-West Shrine game and Montana head coach Bobby Hauck called Olson \u201cone of my favorite guys all-time.\u201d At the NFL Combine, he posted a 42-inch vertical jump, one of the best for a linebacker, but his 4.88-second 40-yard dash was considered to hurt his draft stock. ==Professional career== After going undrafted in the 2020 NFL Draft, Olson signed an undrafted free agent deal with the Philadelphia Eagles.

He was re-signed to their practice squad on October 8, 2020. ==Personal life== Olson is the son of Linda Olson and former Southern Oregon football coach Jeff Olson.
