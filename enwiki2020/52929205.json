The name was adopted after Kanto's personal experience on July 7, 2007 (07-07-07). A few months later, guitarist Israel Monroy, bassist Lalo Olvera, and drummer Zared joined the band. During the early years, S7N performed as a cover band while writing their first original songs. Zared departed the band in 2012, leading to the inclusion of Fabi\u00e1n Carre\u00f1o on drums and the beginning of the recordings for their debut album, Fearless. The album was released on November 25, 2013, with official videos released for \"Blackout\" and \"Double Dealing\". ===Deadline and national success (2014\u2013present)=== The release of Fearless brought the attention of Mexican media, leading to S7N's participation as opening act for several artists during 2014, such as Havok,http://todochiapas.mx/chiapas/havok-en-tuxtla-la-invasion-del-trash- metal/36635 Ghost,https://conciertosguadalajara.com.mx/2014/08/espectaculo- macabro-ghost-en-guadalajara/ and Napalm Death.http://www.tono.tv/fotos-s7n-en-el-jose-cuervo-salon/ The album received a nomination for Best Metal Album at the Mexico Independent Music Awards.http://losimas.com/ediciones/ganadores?e=2014#Disco_Metal In 2015, \"Blackout\" was used as part of Netflix's Club de Cuervos soundtrack, on Season 1's Episode 7, as well as on EMP UNDERGROUND Volume One, a compilation for EMP Label Group.
