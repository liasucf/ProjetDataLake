    "text": "The Khasi\u2013Khmuic languages are a primary branch of the Austroasiatic language family of Southeast Asia in the classification of Diffloth (2005). ==Languages== The only proper classification of Austroasiatic in recent years is that of Diffloth (2005), which breaks up his 1974 conception of Mon\u2013Khmer, resulting in Khasi\u2013Khmuic and Nuclear Mon\u2013Khmer (see). The Khasi\u2013Khmuic languages are as follows: However, Sidwell (2009, 2011) notes that Khmuic and Pakanic (or at least Mangic) appear to be independent branches, and that the only valid connection is Khasi\u2013Palaungic. The extent of the recently described Pakanic branch is contested, with some including the Mangic languages and others placing those in Palaungic. ==Footnotes== ==References== *Diffloth, G\u00e9rard 2005. \"The contribution of linguistic palaeontology and Austroasiatic\". in Laurent Sagart, Roger Blench and Alicia Sanchez-Mazas, eds.
