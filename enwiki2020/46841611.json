    "text": "Daniel Howe (born 4 December 1995) is an Australian rules footballer who plays for the Hawthorn Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). == Early career == Growing up in Yarrawonga, Howe joined his elder brother and played most of his junior years playing for Rennie. Howe spent his schooling as a boarder at Xavier College, he would often go home and play with Rennie in the Hume Football League. Because he was a December baby, Howe was one of a few players that was allowed to be an overage player in the TAC under 18 competition. == Hawthorn (2015\u2013present) == After Hawthorn won the 2014 premiership the Hawthorn recruitment officer concentrated on the younger players in the 2014 AFL Draft. Howe was a 2nd round selection (Hawthorn) No. 31 overall. A mobile defender, Howe made his AFL debut in the ninth round of the 2015 season. On a wet day in Launceston he started as the sub before replacing Cyril Rioli at three quarter time. In November 2015, Howe extended his contract to play for Hawthorn for an additional two years. In July 2018, Howe received a five-game ban for his conduct in a Round 18 game against Carlton. He was given a two-game ban for striking Patrick Cripps and a three- game ban for a tripping incident that left Zac Fisher with a broken leg. On 30 October 2018, Howe signed a two-year deal with Hawthorn. ==Statistics== : Statistics are correct to the end of 2020. |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" | scope=\"row\" | 2015 || || 41 | 4 || 0 || 1 || 28 || 23 || 51 || 20 || 11 || 0.0 || 0.3 || 7.0 || 5.8 || 12.8 || 5.0 || 2.8 |- | scope=\"row\" | 2016 || || 41 | 11 || 1 || 2 || 96 || 60 || 156 || 40 || 50 || 0.1 || 0.2 || 8.7 || 5.5 || 14.2 || 3.6 || 4.6 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" | scope=\"row\" | 2017 || || 17 | 18 || 5 || 2 || 151 || 149 || 300 || 72 || 96 || 0.3 || 0.1 || 8.4 || 8.3 || 16.7 || 4.0 || 5.3 |- | scope=\"row\" | 2018 || || 17 | 17 || 4 || 2 || 165 || 138 || 303 || 80 || 82 || 0.2 || 0.1 || 9.7 || 8.1 || 17.8 || 4.7 || 4.8 |- style=\"background-color: #EAEAEA\" | scope=\"row\" | 2019 || || 17 | 12 || 1 || 2 || 111 || 83 || 194 || 53 || 44 || 0.1 || 0.2 || 9.3 || 6.9 || 16.2 || 4.4 || 3.7 |- | scope=\"row\" | 2020 || || 17 | 5 || 2 || 0 || 36 || 17 || 53 || 16 || 5 || 0.4 || 0.0 || 7.2 || 3.4 || 10.6 || 3.2 || 1.0 |- class=\"sortbottom\" ! colspan=3| Career ! 67 !! 13 !! 9 !! 587 !! 470 !! 1057 !! 281 !! 288 !! 0.2 !! 0.1 !! 8.8 !! 7.0 !! 15.8 !! 4.2 !! 4.3 |} ==Honours and achievements== Individual * best first year player (debut season): 2015 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:1995 births Category:Hawthorn Football Club players Category:Box Hill Football Club players Category:Murray Bushrangers players Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) ",
