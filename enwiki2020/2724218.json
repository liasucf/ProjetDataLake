The three parties together won 175 seats, compared to the 174 won by the Social Democrats and Communists. It was the only time that non-socialist parties retained power in an election between 1928 and 2010. The Moderates dramatically increased their representation in the Riksdag, becoming the largest party of the non-socialist bloc, a position they have maintained ever since. Despite the unexpected victory, the coalition split in 1981 when the Moderates withdrew support in protest at F\u00e4lldin's tax policies, which they viewed as \"too leftist\". Despite not being the leader of the coalition party with the most seats, F\u00e4lldin had been the designate Prime Minister since his earlier resignation in 1978, upon disagreement over the question of nuclear power. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text- align:right |- |colspan=7|300px |- !Party !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 |- |align=left|Swedish Social Democratic Party||2,356,234||43.2||154||+2 |- |align=left|Moderate Party||1,108,406||20.3||73||+18 |- |align=left|Centre Party||984,589||18.1||64||\u201322 |- |align=left|People's Party||577,063||10.6||38||\u20131 |- |align=left|Left Party Communists||305,420||5.6||20||+3 |- |align=left|Christian Democratic Unity||75,993||1.4||0||0 |- |align=left|Communist Party of Sweden||10,862||0.2||0||0 |- |align=left|Workers Party Communists||10,725||0.2||0||New |- |align=left|Other parties||19,346||0.4||0||0 |- |align=left|Invalid/blank votes||31,488||\u2013||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left|Total||5,480,126||100||349||0 |- |align=left|Registered voters/turnout||6,040,461||90.7||\u2013||\u2013 |- |align=left colspan=5|Source: Nohlen & St\u00f6ver |} ===By municipalities=== Image:Sweden.1979.coalition.largest.map.svg|Votes by municipality.
