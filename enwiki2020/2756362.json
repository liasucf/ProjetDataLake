KPB/PCB was formed through the unification of two groups, the Communist Party led by War Van Overstraeten and the Belgian Communist Party led by Joseph Jacquemotte, following a split from the Belgian Workers Party. At the time of its foundation, KPB/PCB had around 500 members.1921-1996: PC KPB/PCB became the Belgian section of the Communist International. The party gained parliamentary presence in 1925, as both Van Overstraeten and Jacquemotte were elected MPs. By 1935 KPB/PCB had 9 deputies in the lower house of parliament and 4 senators. In 1938 it had a membership of about 8,500. During the Second World War, the party had to go underground during German occupation. The party was also closely affiliated with the Partisans Arm\u00e9s, a resistance group during the occupation, however in 1943 much of the party leadership was arrested by German forces. After the end of the war, the party was strengthened and obtained 25% in the parliamentary elections. The party participated in a coalition government with the socialists and the liberals from 1946 to 1947. On August 18, 1950 the party chairman, Julien Lahaut, was assassinated. In the mid 1960s the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 9,890.Benjamin, Roger W.; Kautsky, John H..
