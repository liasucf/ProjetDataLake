    "text": "Kim Cho-hi, nicknamed Chocho (born September 7, 1996) is a South Korean curler from Uiseong. She is currently the alternate for Team Kim Eun-jung. The Kim team represented South Korea at the 2018 Winter Olympics where they won a silver medal. ==Career== Team Kim won the 2017 South Korean championship, qualifying the team to represent South Korea on home ice at the 2018 Winter Olympics. The team began the 2017-18 curling season by winning the 2017 Pacific-Asia Curling Championships. As the host nation, the team received celebrity status in Korea as the \"garlic girls\", as their hometown of Uiseong is known for its garlic production. The team had an impressive run, making it all the way to the gold medal final, where they lost to Sweden's Anna Hasselborg rink. The next month, the team then played in the 2018 Ford World Women's Curling Championship where they lost in the quarterfinals. The garlic girls did not play much in the 2018\u201319 season, amidst a coaching scandal, which involved the country's sport federation vice president verbally abusing the team.https://www.cbc.ca/sports/olympics/curling/south-korea-olympic- garlic-girls-abuse-1.4932821 She did play lead for the team in the final event of the season, the 2019 WCT Arctic Cup, because her skip Kim Eun-jung was preparing to give birth so the whole line-up shifted up a position. The team finished with an 1\u20133 record, missing the playoffs. Eun-jung also did not play in the teams first few events of the 2019\u201320 season. This meant that Kim Kyeong-ae would play skip, Cho-hi would play third and Kim Seon-yeong and Kim Yeong-mi played their normal second and lead positions respectively. They qualified for the playoffs at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic, the 2019 Stu Sells Oakville Tankard and finished runner-up at the inaugural WCT Uiseong International Curling Cup. Kim Eun-jung rejoined the team at the 2019 Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Curling Classic where she would throw second stones. They had a quarterfinal finish. Team Kim also had a quarterfinal finish the following week at the 2019 Canad Inns Women's Classic where Kim Eun-jung returned to throwing skip stones. They made it to the final of the 2019 Changan Ford International Curling Elite and finished fourth at the 2019 China Open in December 2019. In the new year, they had a quarterfinal finish at the International Bernese Ladies Cup and they won the Glynhill Ladies International. It would be the team's last event of the season as both the Players' Championship and the Champions Cup Grand Slam events were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Curlers at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:South Korean female curlers Category:Olympic curlers of South Korea Category:Olympic silver medalists for South Korea Category:Medalists at the 2018 Winter Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in curling Category:People from Uiseong County ",
