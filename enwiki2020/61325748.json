    "text": "KTLH (107.9 FM; La Invasora 107.9) is a terrestrial American radio station, broadcasting a Regional Mexican format in full simulcast with it sister station KOYE in Frankston, Texas. Licensed to Hallsville, Texas, United States, the station serves the Longview-Marshall area. The facility is currently owned by Alpha Media LLC, through licensee Alpha Media Licensee. Its studios are located on Broadway Avenue in downtown Tyler, and its transmitter is located in unincorporated Harrison County, northeast of Ashland, Texas. KTLH signed on as the eastern counterpart of Regional Mexican formatted 96.7 KOYE Frankston \"La Invasora\", replacing the previously sold 92.3 KCUL-FM Marshall. ==History== KTLH was first proposed by Alpha Media in early 2018, and received a permit to construct the facility on June 25, 2018. The construction permit was to expire in June 2021, and also forced Chalk Hill Media to move its displaced Henderson Class D translator, K300CX, which relays AM 1240 KDOK Kilgore, to a new operating channel. Chalk Hill media applied and was granted the move of K300CX to channel 291 (106.1 MHz), making way for the new Hallsville station to sign on. After a week of testing the new signal with a looped instrumental piece and a basic \"107.9 KTLH Hallsville\" identification, KTLH joined Alpha Media sister station KOYE as a simulcast partner of Regional Mexican \"La Invasora\", returning the format to the Longview/Marshall portion of the market. ==External links== ==References== TLH ",
