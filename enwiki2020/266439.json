    "text": "Louis Auguste Sabatier Louis Auguste Sabatier (; 22 October 1839 - 12 April 1901), French Protestant theologian, was born at Vallon-Pont-d'Arc, Ard\u00e8che and died in Strasbourg. He was educated at the Protestant theological faculty of Montauban as well as at the universities of T\u00fcbingen and Heidelberg. After holding the pastorate at Aubenas in Ard\u00e8che from 1864 to 1868, he was appointed professor of reformed dogmatics at the Protestant theological faculty of Strasbourg. His markedly French sympathies during the War of 1870 led to his expulsion from Strassburg in 1872. After five years' effort he succeeded in establishing a Protestant Faculty of Theology in Paris (today: Facult\u00e9 de th\u00e9ologie protestante de Paris) along with Eug\u00e8ne M\u00e9n\u00e9goz, and became professor and then dean. In 1886, he became a teacher in the newly founded religious science department of the \u00c9cole des Hautes Etudes at the Sorbonne. His brother, Paul, was a noted theological historian. He is the father of two daughters, Marguerite Chevalley, translator,Marguerite Chevalley and Lucie Chevalley. Claude Chevalley, mathematician, is his grandson. == Published works == Among Louis Auguste Sabatier's chief works were: * M\u00e9moire sur la notion h\u00e9braique de l'Esprit (1879). * Les origines litt\u00e9raires et la composition de l'apocalypse de Saint Jean (1888). * The Vitality of Christian Dogmas and their Power of Evolution (1898). * Outlines of a philosophy of religion based on psychology and history (1902). * The Apostle Paul (1903). * The doctrine of the atonement and its historical evolution; and, Religion and modern culture (1904). * Religions of Authority and the Religion of the Spirit; translation of Les religions d'autorit\u00e9 de la religion dell'esprit (1904, posthumous), to which his colleague Jean R\u00e9ville prefixed a short memoir. These works show Sabatier as \"at once an accomplished dialectician and a mystic in the best sense of the word\". ==References== ;On his theology *Eug\u00e8ne M\u00e9n\u00e9goz in Expository Times, xv.30 *G.
