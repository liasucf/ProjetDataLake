    "text": "The Cantabrian mixed forests is a temperate broadleaf and mixed forests ecoregion in southwestern Europe. It extends along the coastal Cantabrian Mountains and Galician Massif of Northern Spain, extending south into northern Portugal, and northwards through the westernmost Pyrenees to southwestern France. The ecoregion extends from the seacoast to the highest peaks of the Cantabrian Mountains. The highest peak is Torre Cerredo at 2,648 meters elevation. The ecoregion is transitional between the Mediterranean climate regions of Spain and Portugal and the more humid and temperate forests of Western Europe. The lowlands have mild temperate climate, while the high mountains experience cold winters. ==Flora== The ecoregion's altitudinal range supports several plant communities. The lowlands are characterized by broadleaf deciduous forests, with English oak (Quercus robur), sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa), European ash (Fraxinus excelsior), lindens (Tilia platyphyllos and Tilia cordata), wych elm (Ulmus glabra), and maples (Acer pseudoplatanus and Acer platanoides). Characteristically Mediterranean evergreen trees and shrubs, including holm oak (Quercus ilex), cork oak (Quercus suber), sweet bay (Laurus nobilis), strawberry tree (Arbutus unedo), and Rhamnus alaternus, can be found in warm and well-drained areas like limestone outcrops. Maritime pine (Pinus pinaster) is common on Atlantic coastal dunes in northern Portugal and western Galicia, and further inland on rocky dry slopes. Middle- and upper-elevation forests are characterized by deciduous oaks (Quercus petraea and Quercus pyrenaica), with European beech (Fagus sylvatica) from the Cantabrian Mountains eastward into France. Stands of white birch (Betula pubescens) appear below the timber line. Above the timber line (1800 meters), subalpine plant communities including low shrubs (including dwarf juniper and heathers), grasses, peat bogs, and rock outcrops cover the highest peaks. ==Fauna== Large mammals include Cantabrian brown bear (Ursus arctos), Iberian wolf (Canis lupus signatus), Cantabrian chamois (Rupicapra pyrenaica parva), wild boar (Sus scrofa), red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus), and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Feral horses (Equus caballus) roam in Galicia's mountains. The broom hare (Lepus castroviejoi) is an endemic species to the Cantabrian Mountains. The reclusive Pyrenean desman (Galemys pyrenaicus) is a vulnerable small mammal that lives here and in the Pyrenees. The Cantabrian brown bears number over 200 individuals, who live in the Cantabrian Mountains of southern Asturias and Cantabria and the adjacent portion of Castile and Le\u00f3n. The brown bear population has increased in recent decades from fewer than 100 in the 1990s. The Cantabrian population is the larger of the two remaining brown bear populations in southwestern Europe; the other is in the Pyrenees.Trinidad P\u00e9rez, Javier Naves, Jos\u00e9 Fernando V\u00e1zquez, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez-Gil, Juan Seijas, Jes\u00fas Albornoz, Eloy Revilla, Miguel Delibes, and Ana Dom\u00ednguez \"Estimating the population size of the endangered Cantabrian brown bear through genetic sampling,\" Wildlife Biology 20(5), 300-309, (1 October 2014). https://doi.org/10.2981/wlb.00069 The Cantabrian capercaillie (Tetrao urogallus cantabricus) is an endangered subspecies of grouse. Its population and range are declining from habitat destruction, human disturbance, and over-hunting. ==Protected areas== 9,294 km\u00b2 (10%) of the ecoregion is in protected areas.
