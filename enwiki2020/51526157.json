    "text": "Torney is an English, Northern-Irish and German surname which is most prevalent in Australia and has its highest density in the North of Ireland. As a habitational surname it may be connected to French locations with the name Tournay or Tournai (from Proto-Celtic turno- \"height\" with the Gaulish toponymic suffix -acu(m), meaning \"location of the hills\" or \"shore heights\") \u2013 and carried by people arriving after the Norman conquest in 1066 \u2013 or to a variety of British places named Thorney (with the Old English meaning of \"thorn tree island\"). As an Irish name it is the reduced Anglicized form of \u00d3 Torna (meaning \"descendant of Torna\", a personal name). In Slavic influenced eastern Germany it is a toponymic surname \u2013 derived similarly as in England from the word thorn \u2013 and probably referred to a location characterized by thorn bushes and/or trees.
