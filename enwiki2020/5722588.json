    "text": "Frequencies from Planet Ten is the debut album by rock band Orange Goblin. It was released in 1997 by Rise Above Records. In 2002 it was reissued as a double CD coupled with their second album, Time Travelling Blues (1998). The reissue version contains two bonus tracks, both taken from their Man's Ruin EP, Nuclear Guru. The latter bonus track is a cover of Black Sabbath's \"Hand of Doom\". The original Japanese press also contains these two bonus tracks. Both \"Saruman's Wish\" and \"Lothlorian\" have their basis in J. R. R. Tolkien's epic fantasy The Lord of the Rings. Saruman is an evil wizard and Lothl\u00f3rien is a mythical forest which is home to a race of elves. == Track listing == == Personnel == * Ben Ward - vocals * Pete O'Malley - guitar * Joe Hoare - guitar * Martyn Millard - bass * Duncan Gibbs - keyboards * Chris Turner - drums ==References== Category:1997 debut albums Category:Orange Goblin albums Category:Rise Above Records albums ",
