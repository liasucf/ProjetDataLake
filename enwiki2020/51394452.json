The game has nine levels. You can choose any of the levels from the start menu and the level selected determines how long you have been on the trail, how many steers you have, how many shots you have, and how many wranglers and rustlers must be eliminated. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center ! Level !! Day !! Number of Steers !! Shots per Steer !! Number of Rustlers |- ! 1 | 1 || 4 || 50 ||12 |- ! 2 | 8 || 6 || 50 || 16 |- ! 3 | 15 || 8 || 100 || 16 |- ! 4 | 22 || 10 || 100 || 16 |- ! 5 | 29 || 12 || 100 || 16 |- ! 6 | 36 || 14 || 100 || 16 |- ! 7 | 43 || 16 || 100 || 16 |- ! 8 | 50 || 18 || 100 || 16 |- ! 9 | 57 || 20 || 100 || 16 |} Wranglers are in the form of brands and will try to brand the steers for themselves. Mileage counts as the score and Rustlers are worth 250 miles and Wranglers are 150 miles. Every time 10,000 miles is reached another steer is added to the group. ==References== ==External Links== * Eli's Software Encyclopedia: Chisholm Trail * Giant Bomb: Chisholm Trail * Moby Games: Chisolm Trail * TI-99/4A Video Game House: Chisholm Trail * TI-99/4A-Pedia: Chisholm Trail Category:1982 video games Category:Texas Instruments TI-99/4A games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
