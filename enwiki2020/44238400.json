    "text": "The map of the Inuit Circumpolar Council Eskimo peoples: Eskimology or Inuitology is a complex of humanities sciences studying languages, history, literature, folklore, culture, and ethnology of people speaking Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages and Eskimo (Inuit\u2013Yupik)\u2013Aleut peoples in chronological and comparative context. This includes ethnic groups from the Chukchi Peninsula on the eastern tip of Siberia of Russian Federation to Alaska of the United States, Northern Canada (incl. Nunavik and Nunatsiavut), and Greenland of Denmark.S\u00f8ren Thuesen (2005), Eskimology. In Mark Nuttall (editor). Encyclopedia of the Arctic. Vol 1,2 and 3. pp. 585-586 Originally, a Eskimologist or Inuitologist was primarily a linguist or philologist who researches Eskimology scholar. ==History== Eskimology traces its beginning to the pioneering work of Hans Egede (1745) and David Crantz (1767) in Greenland.Fienup-Riordan, Ann. (1990). Eskimo Essays: Yup'ik Lives and Howe We See Them. New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press. Eskimology has traditionally had a particular focus on Greenland studies owing to the long- standing relationship between Denmark and Greenland established in the early 18th century, and the academic discipline of Eskimology is today centered at the University of Copenhagen. The term \"Eskimology\" was not common until 1967, when a genuine department was established and officially named the Department of Eskimology. From the late 1960s, Eskimology changed its focus toward increasingly contemporary and global political issues. In 2019, the department changed its name to Greenlandic and Arctic Studies Section (a section within the Department of Cross-cultural and Regional Studies). Greenlandic and Arctic Studies Section offers full BA and MA programmes. In these programmes, the study of Greenlandic language and the socio-cultural issues of Greenland/ the Arctic are central. == List of Eskimologists == * Knut Bergsland * Ann Fienup- Riordan * Michael Fortescue * Sven Haakanson * Erik Holtved * Steven A.
