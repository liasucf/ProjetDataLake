    "text": "The International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES) is an annual conference in the field of operations research. Two tracks are held simultaneously, covering domain independent methodologies and technologies and also practical work developed in specific application areas. These tracks are present in the conference not only in technical sessions but also in poster sessions, keynote lectures and tutorials. The works presented in the conference are published in the conference proceedings and are made available at the SCITEPRESS digital library. Usually, it's established a cooperation with Springer for a post-publication with some of the conference best papers. The first edition of ICORES was held in 2012 in conjunction with the International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence (ICAART) and the International Conference on Pattern Recognition Applications and Methods (ICPRAM). ==Areas== ===Methodologies and Technologies=== * Analytics for Enterprise (Engineering) Systems * Inventory Theory * Linear Programming * Management Sciences * Network Optimization * Optimization * Predictive Analytics * Queuing Theory * Simulation * Stochastic Optimization * Data Mining and Business Analytics * Decision Analysis * Design in ES (E.G., Real Options for Flexible Design, Etc) * Dynamic Programming * Forecasting * Game Theory * Industrial Engineering * Information Systems ===Applications=== * Automation of Operations * OR in Education * OR in Emergency Management * OR in Health * OR in National Defense/International Security * OR in Telecommunications * OR in Transportation * Project Management * Resource Allocation * Risk Management * Routing * Decision Support Systems * Scheduling * Supply Chain Management * Systems of Systems/Teams and Socio-Technical Systems * Energy and Environment * Engines for Innovation * Globalization and Productivity * Logistics * Maintenance * New Applications of OR * Optimization in Finance ==Current Chairs== ===Conference Chair=== Marc Demange, RMIT University, School of Science - Mathematical Sciences, Australia ===Program Co-Chairs=== * Greg H.
