    "text": "The former Singapore National Stadium (Malay: Stadium Nasional Singapura) was a multi-purpose stadium in Kallang, which opened in July 1973 and closed on 30 June 2007. The stadium was demolished from 2010 to 2011 for the development of the Singapore Sports Hub, which houses its successor. During its closure from 2007 to 2014, NDP and sports events were held at the Marina Bay Floating Platform and Jalan Besar Stadium. The stadium was the home of Singapore FA, that played in Malaysian domestic football, and the Singapore national team. It also hosted the Singapore Cup finals annually, the first in 1996, and the second leg of the 2004 AFF Championship finals. In addition to association football matches, the stadium hosted the 1973, 1983 and 1993 Southeast Asian Games, the Singapore Armed Forces Day parade and the opening ceremony of the biennial Singapore Youth Festival, as well as numerous music and cultural events. It was the primary venue for the National Day Parade. == Facilities == The National Stadium had an eight-lane running track and football field in addition to other miscellaneous facilities such as table tennis tables, a weights room and an auditorium, housed underneath the spectator stands. While the facilities were often used for high-profile sporting events, they could also be used by members of the public and other local organizations for a nominal fee. For example, when not otherwise used, the running track could be used by joggers for S$0.50 per entry.Singapore Sports Council - National Stadium Facilities . The headquarters of the Singapore Sports Council used to be located at 15 Stadium Road. The preview show of the National Day Parade held at the National Stadium in 2003 == History == === Conceptualisation === One of the final football games played at Kallang, June 2007 Soon after the end of the Second World War, as Singapore moved towards self-government and independence, the clamour began for a national stadium. === Funding === A state-owned lottery company, Singapore Pools, was set up in 1968 to raise funds for the stadium. Proceeds from the Singapore Sweep and TOTO were used to pay a substantial part of the construction bill. Between 1968 and 1976, the company contributed S$14.5 million towards the project. Singapore Pools also helped the stadium repay a government loan of $7.8 million meant as start-up money for a stadium management corporation.Singapore Pools, The Beginning of the National Stadium. Following the completion of the National Stadium, Singapore Pools remained a major sponsor of stadium, as well as the National Day Parade. === Construction === On 7 December 1966, in the year that Singapore celebrated its first National Day, Othman drove the first pile into the ground. For the next three and a half years, piling was done to lay the foundations. Work had to be delayed due to bad weather for about a month. By the end of 1970, the stadium was three-quarters completed and was starting to take its definitive shape. Thirty-six steps, each wide, formed an impressive entrance; and a cauldron was built within the stadium to carry a flame that would burn on special events and on the opening of the stadium. By the end of June 1973 when the stadium was completed, 300,000 bags of cement, 3,000,000 bricks and 4,500 tons of steel and timber had been used. The new stadium was opened to the public for the first time on 19 July 1973. === Redevelopment === Plans were made to demolish the stadium and build a multipurpose, Singapore Sports Hub in its place.Singapore Sports Council, News on the redevelopment of the National Stadium Demolition works began in the second half of 2007, and the new Sports Hub was eventually completed in 2014.
