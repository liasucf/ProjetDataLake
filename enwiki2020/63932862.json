    "text": "Lithium orthosilicate is a compound with the chemical formula Li4SiO4. It is a white ceramic compound, which melts congruently at a temperature of . Lithium orthosilicate is of primary interest towards carbon dioxide capture, as this compound reacts with CO2 at elevated temperatures to form lithium carbonate, and has been implemented in limited scale in such applications.Optimization of Li4SiO4 synthesis conditions by a solid state method for maximum CO2 capture at high temperature Further applications of Li4SiO4 include solid electrolytes for lithium-ion batteries, specifically solid state batteries,Thin Film Lithium Battery using Stable Solid Electrolyte Li4SiO4 Fabricated by PLD and tritium breeding materials, as a component of the breeding blanket for planned fusion energy systems such as ITER. ==See also== *Carbon dioxide scrubber ==References== Category:Silicates Category:Lithium compounds ",
