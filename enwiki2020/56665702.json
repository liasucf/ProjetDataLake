They were ordered as part of a naval construction program directed at France's rivals, Italy and Germany, particularly after Italy made progress in modernizing its own fleet. The plan was also intended to remedy a deficiency in cruisers that had been revealed during training exercises in the 1880s. As such, the Catinat-class cruisers were intended to operate as fleet scouts and in the French colonial empire. The ships were armed with a main battery of four guns supported by ten guns and they had a top speed of . Catinat served briefly with the Northern Squadron in 1898 and 1899 before being placed in reserve; thereafter, she and Protet served the entirety of their active careers abroad. Protet was sent to the Pacific in 1899 after being completed, and she remained there through 1905 to protect French interests. Catinat was sent on a brief stint to French Madagascar in 1901 through at least 1902, before returning to France at some point before 1905. Early that year, she was sent to the Pacific to replace her sister ship, remaining there through at least 1908. No records of her activities thereafter survive. That year, Protet was converted into a training ship for the Gunnery School, though she was sold for scrap in 1910. Catinat was discarded the following year. ==Design== The earlier cruiser of the , which provided the basis for the Catinat design In the late 1880s, the Italian (Royal Navy) accelerated construction of ships for its fleet and reorganized its most modern ironclad battleships\u2014the and es\u2014into a fast squadron suitable for offensive operations. These developments provoked a strong response in the French press. The Budget Committee in the French Chamber of Deputies began to press for a \"two-power standard\" in 1888, which would see the French fleet enlarged to equal the combined Italian and German fleets, then France's two main rivals on the continent. This initially came to nothing, as the supporters of the doctrine called for a fleet largely based on squadrons of torpedo boats to defend the French coasts rather than an expensive fleet of ironclads. This view had significant support in the Chamber of Deputies. The next year, a war scare with Italy led to further outcry to strengthen the fleet. To compound matters, the visit of a German squadron of four ironclads to Italy confirmed French concerns of a combined Italo-German fleet that would dramatically outnumber their own. Training exercises held in France that year demonstrated that the slower French fleet would be unable to prevent the faster Italian squadron from bombarding the French coast at will, in part because it lacked enough cruisers (and doctrine to use them) to scout for the enemy ships. To correct the weaknesses of the French fleet, on 22 November 1890, the Superior Council authorized a new construction program directed not at simple parity with the Italian and German fleets, but numerical superiority. In addition to twenty-four new battleships, a total of seventy cruisers were to be built for use in home waters and overseas in the French colonial empire. The Catinat class were ordered to as part of the program, and they were based on the earlier . The Catinat-class ships were intended to operate in France's overseas colonies. ===General characteristics and machinery=== Postcard depicting Catinat The ships of the Catinat class were long between perpendiculars and long overall. They had a beam of and a draft of . displaced , while displaced . Protet suffered from stability problems and had to have ballast added, accounting for her greater displacement. Like most French warships of the period, the Catinat-class cruisers' hulls had a pronounced ram bow, tumblehome shape, and a short forecastle deck. Below the waterline, the hulls were covered in a layer of wood and copper sheathing to protect them from biofouling on long voyages overseas. The ships had a minimal superstructure, consisting primarily of a small conning tower and a bridge. They were originally to have been fitted with heavy military masts, but during construction, these were replaced with lighter pole masts with spotting tops for observation and signaling purposes. Their crew numbered 400 officers and enlisted men. The ships' propulsion system consisted of a pair of vertical triple-expansion steam engines driving two screw propellers. Steam was provided by sixteen coal-burning Belleville-type water-tube boilers that were ducted into two funnels. Their machinery was rated to produce normally, and up to using forced draft, for a top speed of . In service, both cruisers were capable of for a speed of . Coal storage amounted to , which allowed them to steam for at a speed of . ===Armament and armor=== A Model 1891 gun in a pivot mount The Catinat-class vessels were armed with a main battery of four Mod\u00e8le 1893 45-caliber guns. They were placed in individual sponsons clustered amidships, two guns per broadside. They were supplied with a variety of shells, including solid, cast iron projectiles, and explosive armor-piercing (AP) and semi-armor-piercing (SAP) shells that weighed and , respectively. The guns fired with a muzzle velocity of . The main battery was supported by a secondary battery of ten Mod\u00e8le 1891 guns, which were carried in a variety of mounts. Two guns fitted with gun shields were placed side-by-side in pivot mounts on the upper deck, four more were in the upper deck forward in casemates. Another pair of guns were in sponsons further aft, and the remaining pair were in pivot mounts on the upper deck aft. The guns fired cast iron and AP shells with a muzzle velocity of . For close-range defense against torpedo boats, they carried ten 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns and four 1-pounder guns, all in individual pivot mounts. They were also armed with two torpedo tubes in their hulls above the waterline. They had a capacity to carry fifty naval mines, which were stored in the compartment for the steering engine. A rail extended aft, through the captain's cabin, to a port in the stern, where the mines could be dropped into the ships' wake. Armor protection consisted of a curved armor deck that was thick on the flat portion, curving down at the sides, where it increased in thickness to . Toward the bow and stern, the deck was reduced slightly to . Above the deck, a cellular layer of watertight compartments was intended to contain flooding below the waterline. A light splinter deck covered the propulsion machinery spaces to protect them from shell fragments that penetrated the main armor deck. The gun shields for the deck-mounted 100 mm guns were thick. The ships had plating on the conning tower. ==Construction== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=\"120\" | Name ! width=\"90\" | Laid down ! width=\"90\" | Launched ! width=\"90\" | Completed ! width=\"90\" | Shipyard |- | | February 1894 | 8 October 1896 | 1898 | , La Seyne-sur-Mer |- | | March 1896 | 6 July 1898 | February 1899 | , Lormont |} ==Service history== Catinat, date unknown Catinat was assigned to the Northern Squadron in 1898, where she conducted training exercises with the rest of the unit. During maneuvers that year, she accidentally ran aground, but was not seriously damaged in the incident. She served in the unit for less than a year before being transferred to the reserve fleet. Protet was sent to the Pacific Ocean for a lengthy deployment after her completion in 1899. She helped suppress a fire in the United States in 1900 and protected French interests in Colombia during a conflict in the country in 1901. Catinat had been recommissioned and sent abroad by 1901, being stationed in French Madagascar. She operated there at least through 1902. At some point thereafter, Catinat was recalled home and decommissioned once more. In early 1905, she was recommissioned to relieve Protet, which had also been recalled home that year. Protet was converted into a training ship for gun crews at the Gunnery School in 1908, but served in that capacity for just two years. She was struck from the naval register in 1910 and thereafter broken up. Catinats career in the Pacific was uneventful, and she remained on station in the region through 1908. She followed her sister ship to the breakers' yard in 1911. ==Notes== ==References== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:Cruiser classes Category:Ships built in France Category:1890s ships ",
