    "text": "\"Lady Godiva's Operation\" is a song by American avant-garde rock band the Velvet Underground, appearing on their second album, White Light/White Heat (1968). The lyrics of the first half of the song (sung by John Cale) describe Lady Godiva. The lyrics of the second half (sung by Cale alternating with Lou Reed) are full of oblique, deadpan black humor and describe a botched surgical procedure. Cale plays electric viola while lead guitarist Sterling Morrison plays bass, an instrument that he disliked, despite his competent abilities. According to the website, the quote is from John Cale\u2019s autobiography, What\u2019s Welsh for Zen (NY: St. Martin\u2019s Press (2000)). The person's name is taken from the British legend of Lady Godiva, a noble English lady who rode naked through the streets of Coventry. The song was covered by the Fatima Mansions as a single. ==Personnel== * John Cale \u2013 lead vocals, electric viola, medical instrument vocal noises * Lou Reed \u2013 co-lead vocals, electric guitar * Sterling Morrison \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals, medical instrument vocal noises * Maureen Tucker \u2013 percussion ==References== Category:The Velvet Underground songs Category:1968 songs Category:Songs written by Lou Reed Category:Lady Godiva Category:Song recordings produced by Tom Wilson (record producer) ",
