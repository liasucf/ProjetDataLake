    "text": "The 1956 Wyoming Cowboys football team represented the University of Wyoming in the Skyline Conference during the 1956 NCAA University Division football season. In their fourth season under head coach Phil Dickens, the Cowboys compiled a perfect 10\u20130 record (7\u20130 against Skyline opponents), won the Skyline Conference championship, and outscored all opponents by a total of 252 to 112. The Cowboys were ranked No. 19 in the AP Poll issued on November 19, 1956, but dropped out in the final poll. The team's statistical leaders included Larry Zowada with 878 passing yards, Jim Crawford with 1,104 rushing yards and 72 points scored, and John Watts with 287 receiving yards. Crawford led the nation in rushing yards and went on to play five seasons for the Boston Patriots. Believing that they would get a better bowl appearance, the team declined a Sun Bowl invitation. No other invitations came. ==Schedule== ==References== Wyoming Category:Wyoming Cowboys football seasons Category:Mountain States Conference football champion seasons Category:College football undefeated seasons Wyoming Cowboys football ",
