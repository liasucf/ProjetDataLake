    "text": "The Longarm books were a series of western novels featuring the character of Custis Long, who is nicknamed Longarm, a U.S. Deputy Marshal based in Denver, Colorado in the 1880s. The series was written by \"Tabor Evans\", a house pseudonym used by a number of authors at Jove Books. Lou Cameron helped create the character and wrote a number of the early books in the series. The first book was published in 1978 and new ones were added at a rate of approximately one a month through 2015. In addition to the regular series, there was a series of \"giant editions\" which were longer novels. The Longarm series was a mainstay of the \"adult western\" genre which arose in the 1970s. These books are distinguished from classical westerns by the inclusion of more explicit sex and violence. In addition to Cameron, other authors known to have written books in the series include Melvin Marshall, Will C. Knott, Frank Roderus, Chet Cunningham, J. Lee Butts, Gary McCarthy, James Reasoner, Jeffrey M. Wallmann, Peter Brandvold and Harry Whittington. ==List of Longarm novels== # Longarm (1978) - Lou Cameron # Longarm On the Border (1978) - Melvin Marshall # Longarm and the Avenging Angels (1978) - William C.
