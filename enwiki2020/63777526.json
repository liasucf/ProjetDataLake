She studied medicine from 1997 to 2003 at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and at the Hannover Medical School (MHH), where she received her doctorate in 2004 with a thesis on the influence of certain dendritic cells on hepatitis C infection. She was able to prove that these cells can destroy infected cells - which is no longer the case in hepatitis C patients, so that this could be a cause for the development of a chronic hepatitis C infection. The dissertation was awarded several prizes Following her doctorate, she worked there until 2009, initially as an assistant doctor From 2009 to 2012, she worked as a research assistant in a DFG-funded project at Twincore, a joint research facility of the MHH and the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research, where she researched new therapeutic approaches for hepatitis C.
