    "text": "A handheld television is a portable device for watching television that usually uses a TFT LCD or OLED color display. Many of these devices resemble handheld transistor radios. ==History== Sony Watchman In the 1970s and early 1980s, Panasonic and Sinclair Research released the first TVs which were small enough to fit in a large pocket; called the Panasonic IC TV MODEL TR-001 and MTV-1. Since LCD technology was not yet mature at the time, the TV used a minuscule CRT which set the record for being the smallest CRT on a commercially marketed product. Later in 1982, Sony released the first model of the Watchman, a pun on Walkman. It had grayscale video at first. Several years later, a color model with an active-matrix LCD was released. Some smartphones integrate a television receiver, although Internet broadband video is far more common. Since the switch-over to digital broadcasting, handheld TVs have reduced in size and improved in quality. Portable TV was eventually brought to digital TV with DVB-H, although it didn't see much success. The major current manufacturers of DVB-T standard (common throughout Europe) handheld TVs are August International, ODYS and Xoro. ==Hardware== Elements of a pocket television CRT: (1) Recessed Screen, (2) Electron Beam, (3) Electron Gun These devices often have stereo 1\u20448 inch (3.5 mm) phono plugs for composite video- analog mono audio relay to serve them as composite monitors; also, some models have mono 3.5 mm jacks for the broadcast signal that is usually relayed via F connector or Belling-Lee connector on standard television models. Some include HDMI, USB and SD ports. Screen sizes vary from . Some handheld televisions also double as portable DVD players and USB personal video recorders. ==Size== Portable televisions cannot fit in a pocket, but often run on batteries and include a cigarette lighter receptacle plug.

Wearable televisions sometimes are made in the form of a wristwatch. ==Notable brands and models== * August International - DA100C * ODYS - LIVE * Xoro - HSD7790 * RCA - DPTM70R ==See also== *Handheld electronics == References == ==External links== *History of the pocket TV Category:Portable electronics Category:Mobile technology Category:Television technology ",
