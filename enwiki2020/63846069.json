She received training from three notable painters of the period: Frederik Vermehren, J\u00f8rgen Roed and Vilhelm Kyhn. Kyhn submitted samples of her artwork, together with drawings by Augusta Paulli and , in an unsuccessful attempt to have them admitted to the Academy. While still young, following in Roed's footsteps, Bang made a drawing of a chapter in Ribe Cathedral (1865), attracting the interest of the art historian Niels Laurits H\u00f8yen. Inspired by H\u00f8yen, she went on to paint secluded landscapes, including scenes of Bornholm (1870). She first exhibited at the Charlottenborg Spring Exhibition in 1873, becoming a frequent exhibitor thereafter. In 1876, she was a student of Paul Gauguin, living in his Paris home. She attended the Acad\u00e9mie Julian where she studied under L\u00e9on Bonnat and Tony Robert-Fleury. Thanks to a ministerial grant, she travelled to Italy in the late 1870s and again around 1886, painting subjects she exhibited at Charlottenborg in 1887. In 1888, together with 22 other women including Anne Marie Carl-Nielsen and Nathalie Krebs, she signed a petition to the parliament, calling for the Art Academy to be expanded to admit women. It led to the establishment of the Women's Art School (Kunstakademiets Kunstskole for Kvinder) where from October 1888 to May 1889 she was one of the first students. Together with Augusta Paulli, she later opened an art school to prepare women for the Academy. A keen supporter of women's causes, Bang was a member of the Danish Women's Society. She participated in the 1895 Copenhagen Women's Exhibition and, as a member of the Women Artists Society Kvindelige Kunstneres Samfund, in the 1920 Women Artists Retrospective (). Bang spent her later years in the St\u00f8vringg\u00e5rd Convent near Randers where she died on 1 January 1932. She is buried in the convent's cemetery. ==References== ==External links== *Examples of Bang's paintings from Artnet Category:1848 births Category:1932 deaths Category:People from Rebild Municipality Category:19th-century Danish painters Category:20th-century Danish painters Category:Danish women painters Category:Danish feminists Category:Alumni of the Acad\u00e9mie Julian ",
