    "text": "Botteri's sparrow (Peucaea botterii) is a medium-sized sparrow. This passerine bird is primarily found in Mexico, with a breeding range that extends into the southeastern tip of the U.S. state of Arizona, and a small non-migratory population in the Rio Grande Valley of southern Texas, which is threatened by loss of habitat. It was not found in Arizona between the 1890s and the mid-20th century due to excessive grazing of livestock; now it is locally common in its Arizona range due to recovery of vegetation. Juvenile birds apparently need dense vegetation to hide in during fledging; the uncommon native sacaton grass Sporobolus wrightii is preferred, but stands of introduced non-native Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana) and Boer lovegrass (E. curvula var. conferta) are also successfully utilized, though at lower population densities.Jones, Zach F. & Bock, Carl E. (2005): The Botteri's sparrow and exotic Arizona grasslands: an ecological trap or habitat regained? Condor 107(4): 731\u2013741. [Article in English with Spanish abstract] (HTML abstract) The name of this species commemorates the ornithologist Matteo Botteri (1808\u20131877). ==References== * ==Further reading== ===Book=== *Webb, E.
