The album was recorded at Blue Jay Recording Studio, Carlisle, Massachusetts, House of Blues Studios, Memphis, Tennessee, Lewis Ranch, Nesbit, Mississippi, Sunset Sound Factory, Los Angeles, California, and Your Place Or Mine Studio, Glendale, California. The album featured an all-star cast of musicians including, James Burton, Buddy Harman, Joey Spampinato, Andy Paley, and Kenny Lovelace. The release was a comeback album which attempted to recapture the 1950s Sun Records style which Jerry Lee Lewis was most known for. There is heavy echo and a back-to-basics instrumentation with little or no reliance on synthesizers or studio effects. The single that was released was \"Goosebumps\" backed by \"Crown Victoria Custom '51\". A music video was released that featured the song \"Goosebumps\". \"Crown Victoria Custom '51\" is played in the style of Jerry Lee Lewis' first and most iconic recording, \"Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On\" from 1957. ==Track listing== #\"I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive\" \u2013 Fred Rose, Hank Williams 2:11 #\"Goosebumps\" \u2013 Al Anderson, Andy Paley 2:33 #\"Things\" \u2013 Bobby Darin 2:43 #\"Miss The Mississippi And You\" \u2013 William Halley, Eric Schoenberg 3:37 #\"Young Blood\" \u2013 Jerry Leiber, Mike Stoller 2:19 #\"Crown Victoria Custom '51\" \u2013 Andy Paley, Jerry Lee Lewis, James Burton, Kenny Lovelace 3:02 #\"High Blood Pressure\" \u2013 Huey Piano Smith 2:53 #\"Restless Heart\" \u2013 A.
