It enrolls over 600 students in grades K through 12, covering ages 4 through 19.Southland Academy page at greatschools.net. It was founded in 1967 as a segregation academy. == History == Southland Academy was founded in 1966 as a private school in response to the desegregation of Georgia public schools.\"South Leads the Country In School Desegregation; Some Dramatic Progress Schools Still Segregated\", The New York Times, May 9, 1979. In 1979 the public school board (6 of 7 members of which sent their children to Southland) declared many of the district's buses, books and materials to be \"surplus\", then sold them to Southland at low prices. The effect of this caused financial hardships for the public schools, thereby promoting the academy. The first classes began in the old Anthony School building on Anthony Drive. In 1970, Southland moved to its current location at 123 Southland Road. It was reported in 1979 that most white parents in the area sent their children to Southland rather than the local public school system, which at the time was 80% black and the subject of boycotts and criticism over alleged neglect and underfunding.\"Sumter boycott continues\", Rome News-Tribune, October 24, 1979. One businessman said he would \"dig ditches\" to earn money to pay tuition at Southland Academy and avoid sending his children to racially integrated public school. As of the mid 1980s, the Sumter County School District board was all white. School superintendent Ronnie Satterfield and several other board members sent their children to Southland Academy instead of the predominantly black public schools. . US president Jimmy Carter referred to the situation as a \"disgrace to our state.\" Melvin T. Kinslow, the school's headmaster from 1971 to 1996, in May 2008 attacked suggestions in the local press that Southland was in any way a \"segregated\" school, noting that it \"has a very diverse population with students attending or having attended from Korea, India, China, Germany and France... Southland has black students who have graduated, and others who will graduate in the near future.\" ==Demographics== In 1985, Sumter County was 43% black, but not a single black student was enrolled in Southland Academy. Southland's racial demographics do not reflect the ethnic makeup of the town of Americus, which is 39.1% White and 58.3% African American, according to the 2000 Census.Americus city, Georgia - Fact Sheet - American FactFinder , U.S. Census Bureau.
