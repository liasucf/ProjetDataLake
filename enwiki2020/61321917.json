    "text": "I'm Good is the debut and first major-label extended play by American singer Abby Anderson, it was released on September 7, 2018 through Black River Entertainment. It spawned 2 singles, \"Make Him Wait\" and \"This Feeling\". The album peaked at number 42 on Billboard Country Album Sales on 22 September 2019 . == Music and lyrics == The eponymous track was selected as the open track, it highlights Anderson\u2019s strong will and independent attitude as much as demonstrating her versatility. \u201cMake Him Wait\u201d was Anderson\u2019s debut single, which sets to be the second track in her five-song project. It outlines the lessons her parents taught her about dating and true love, and implores listeners to see whether a lover is serious before committing. The song\u2019s most prominent instrumentation is a piano, though guitars and drums make appearances as well. The third track, \u201cDance Away My Broken Heart\u201d, is co- written with her labelmate, Kelsea Ballerini, the country legend, Rhett Akins and his son, Thomas Rhett, to create the dance-worthy, empowering track that allows fans to dance to. The song encourages people to move on and get out again after a nasty breakup, and dancing helps shake off the scars as the first step in healing heart. \"This Feeling\", which is released as the second single by Anderson, it delivers the feeling of falling for someone and describes the sensation that falling in love can change you as a person. The EP ends with the swaggering kiss-off \u201cNaked Truth\u201d , a transformation occurs from the start of the song with an admission that she has been crying to the end describing a mountain top epiphany. == Track listing == Adapted from Genius and Tidal. == Chart performance == === Weekly charts === {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Country Album Sales (Billboard) | 42 |- |} == References == Category:2018 debut EPs Category:Abby Anderson EPs Category:Black River Entertainment albums ",
