    "text": "Monica M. VanDieren is an American mathematician specializing in mathematical logic and model theory. She is University Professor of Mathematics and Director of the University Honors Program at Robert Morris University. ==Education and career== VanDieren graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign in 1996, with a bachelor's degree in mathematics. She did her graduate studies in mathematical sciences at Carnegie Mellon University through their Pure & Applied Logic Program, earning a master's degree in 1998 and completing her Ph.D. in 2002. Her dissertation was Categoricity and Stability in Abstract Elementary Classes, with Rami Grossberg as her doctoral advisor. After completing her doctorate, she was a Szeg\u00f6 Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Stanford University for 2002\u20132003, and then T. H. Hildebrandt Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of Michigan from 2003 to 2006, before joining the Robert Morris University mathematics department in 2006. She was promoted to full professor in 2012 and University Professor in 2016; she has been co-director of the University Honors Program since 2008 and director since 2018. ==Contributions== Some of VanDieren's research has been directed towards Shelah's categoricity conjecture in classification theory. Beyond VanDieren's university work, she has also led mathematics enrichment workshops for middle school and high school students, for instance using origami to demonstrate the beauty of mathematics. ==References== ==External links== *Home page * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:American women mathematicians Category:Model theorists Category:University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign alumni Category:Carnegie Mellon University alumni Category:Stanford University faculty Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:Robert Morris University faculty Category:21st-century women mathematicians ",
