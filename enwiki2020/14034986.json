He taught himself how to play golf while working as a caddie at the Out of Bounds Golf Club in Mahwah. His father, Stanley, also worked as a caddie at the same club, and caddied regularly for Babe Ruth. Zembriski had a brief stint as a member of the PGA Tour in his early thirties after earning his player's card in 1967. During his middle and late thirties, he worked as an ironworker on highrise buildings along the Jersey Shore. During his forties, Zembriski played on the Florida mini-tour. He qualified twice for the U.S. Open during this period, in 1978 and 1982. Zembriski's greatest success in professional golf came on the Senior PGA Tour, where he won three times. Zembriski now lives in Orlando, Florida and still plays golf regularly. ==Amateur wins (2)== this list is probably incomplete *1964 Ike Tournament *1965 New Jersey Amateur ==Professional wins (3)== ===Senior PGA Tour wins (3)=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No. !Date !Tournament !Winning score !Margin of victory !Runner(s)-up |- |align=center|1 |align=right|Jul 23, 1988 |Newport Cup |\u20139 (67-65=132) |2 strokes | Charles Coody |- |align=center|2 |align=right|Oct 9, 1988 |Vantage Championship |\u201310 (73-68-67=70=278) |3 strokes | Al Geiberger, Dave Hill, Dick Rhyan |- |align=center|2 |align=right|Dec 2, 1989 |GTE West Classic |\u201313 (64-68-65=197) |2 strokes | George Archer, Jim Dent |} Senior PGA Tour playoff record (0\u20132) {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !No.!!Year!!Tournament!!Opponent(s)!!Result |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|1 |1985 |Citizens Union Senior Golf Classic | Lee Elder, Orville Moody, Dan Sikes |Elder won with birdie on third extra hole Moody eliminated with birdie on second hole |-style=\"background:#F08080;\" |align=center|2 |1992 |Digital Seniors Classic | Mike Hill |Lost to par on second extra hole |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:American male golfers Category:PGA Tour golfers Category:PGA Tour Champions golfers Category:Golfers from New Jersey Category:People from Mahwah, New Jersey Category:Sportspeople from Orlando, Florida Category:1935 births Category:Living people ",
