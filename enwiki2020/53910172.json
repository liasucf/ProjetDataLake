    "text": "The Tommykaira ZZII was a planned mid-engined sports car manufactured by two tuning companies,Tommykaira & Autobacs. The car was officially unveiled at the Tokyo Auto Salon in September 2001. The powerplant in the prototype was a Nissan RB26DETT engine, but that was obviously a provisional unit. It seems that Tommykaira was actually considering offering a choice of engines in the 2L to 3.5L range, depending on intended application and/or racing category. For the transmission as well, the company was looking at offering a racing- spec sequential type in addition to the standard 6-speed manual. The car was intended to be the successor to the Tommykaira ZZ until the design was bought. == Proposed deliveries and fate == After its unveiling in the Tokyo Auto salon, Tommykaira promised to sell the car in high-volumes. The company already had an organized delivery schedule from after the show. Shortly after it was shown, however, the design was bought out by company Autobacs Seven, and later renamed the car to ASL Garaiya RS01. It too, remained in prototype condition, however, which meant the car was never able to get into production. == Specifications and design == The car is powered by a 2.6-liter twin- turbocharged RB26DETT I6 engine sourced from Nissan delivering . The car weighs , mostly thanks to its ZZ-derived aluminum chassis and full carbon fiber bodywork. The power is delivered to all four wheels by a 6-speed manual transmission, also making the car all-wheel drive. The ZZII is capable of doing in 3.3 seconds and do a claimed top speed of . The design is aerodynamic, and also meant for lower drag coefficients and better airflow. According to DisenoArt, they consider the car one of the best designs ever created by Tommykaira. == In popular media == The ZZII is first featured in Gran Turismo 2 in the Gran Turismo series and has been featured ever since. The only exclusion it has had in the series is Gran Turismo Sport. In Gran Turismo 2, however, the car's design is completely distinct. The car has a more serious look and has an appearance that is similar to that of a GT1 race car. == References == Category:Cars of Japan Category:Sports cars Category:Concept cars Category:Rear mid-engine, all-wheel-drive vehicles ",
