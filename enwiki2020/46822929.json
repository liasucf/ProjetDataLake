    "text": "The Consolidated Slave Law was a law that was enacted by the Barbados legislature in 1826. Following Bussa's Rebellion London officials were concerned about further risk of revolts and instituted a policy of amelioration. This was resisted by white Barbadian planters. In consequence the Consolidated Slave Act was a compromise: it simultaneously granted concessions to the slaves whilst also providing reassurances to the slave owners. Three concessions to the enslaved were: * Right to own property * Right to give evidence in courts in all cases * Reduction in manumission fees Three concessions granted to the slave owners * That a white person could kill an enslaved person during revolt with impunity * Capital punishment of any enslaved person who threatened the life of a white person * All free black people needed a correct evidence of the such rights or they will be presumed to be enslaved ==See also== * Amelioration Act 1798 * William Huskisson ==References== Category:Barbadian law Category:1826 in law Category:1826 in the British Empire Category:1826 in North America ",
