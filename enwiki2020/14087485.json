    "text": "Raymond Osborn Ferris (22 September 1920 \u2013 1 February 1994) was a Northern Irish professional footballer who played as a left half. He played nearly 200 games in the Football League for Crewe Alexandra and Birmingham City, and won three international caps for Northern Ireland. His father, James, had also been an international footballer. Born in Newry, County Down, Ferris spent short trial spells at Irish League clubs Distillery and Glentoran before crossing to England where he signed amateur forms for Brentford. By the time the Second World War broke out he was playing non-league football for Cambridge Town and then moved to Linfield. During the war he made guest appearances for Tottenham Hotspur, West Ham United and former club Brentford. After the war he signed professionally for Crewe Alexandra, for whom he played over 100 times. He then moved to First Division club Birmingham City, for whom he also made over 100 appearances. He was a hard-working, hard-tackling type of half-back with great determination. In the closed season of 1953 he went on a representative tour with the IFA to the United States and Canada, where he sustained a leg injury that eventually ended his career. Though he played for Worcester City in the Southern League for one more season, he was forced to retire in 1954. Ferris died in a Manchester nursing home in February 1994, aged 73. His legs had been amputated due to circulation problems. ==References== * * Category:1920 births Category:1994 deaths Category:Association footballers from Northern Ireland Category:Northern Ireland international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Brentford F.C. players Category:Crewe Alexandra F.C. players Category:Birmingham City F.C. players Category:Worcester City F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Sportspeople from Newry Category:Disease-related deaths in England Category:Pre-1950 IFA international footballers Category:Brentford F.C. wartime guest players ",
