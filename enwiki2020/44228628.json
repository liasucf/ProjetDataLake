In 1945 he began to teach analysis, theory of functions, calculus and rational mechanics at the Scuola Normale. In 1948 he obtained a degree in Analysis; his Ph.D. thesis was written under the direction of Tonelli and Marston Morse. In 1949 he moved first to University of Cincinnati, where he worked with scientists like Otto Sz\u00e1sz and Charles Napoleon Moore, and then to Princeton University, where he worked with Morse. In 1952 he obtained the chair of analysis of the University of Palermo, where he taught until 1961 before transferring to the University of Modena, where he re-launched the Institute of Mathematics and developed its Library and Mathematical Seminar. ==Contributions== He published more than 60 papers on differential equations, Fourier series and the series expansion of orthonormal functions, topology of varieties, real analysis, calculus of variations and the theory of functions. ==Recognition== Baiada won the Michel prize for the best thesis in Pisa and the Whiting Award in 1940 for \"contributions on subjects of calculus of variations\". ==Notes== Category:1984 deaths Category:1914 births Category:20th-century Italian mathematicians Category:People from Tunis Category:Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa alumni Category:University of Palermo faculty Category:University of Modena and Reggio Emilia faculty ",
