    "text": "The Homeland Harmony Quartet was an American gospel group founded in 1935. The original lineup of the quartet was Otis Leon McCoy, Doyle Blackwood, Fred Calvin Maples, and B.C. Robinson. The group had lasting ties to the Church of God and went through more than fifty line-up changes in a career that spanned thirty years. In 1943, tenor Connor Brandon Hall joined the quartet. He would remain with the group until his death in 1992. Other notables to sing with the group include basses Big Jim Waits and Johnny Atkinson, Lee Roy Abernathy and baritone James McCoy. The line-up of Hall, Abernathy, J. McCoy, Shorty Bradford, and A.D.Soward that formed in 1947 is widely considered to have been a seminal influence on both pop and further gospel musical stylings. ==Personnel== TENOR Connor Hall 1942-1989 LEAD Otis McCoy 1942-1944 Shorty Bradford 1946-1948, 1953-1954 Paul Stringfellow 1948-1950 Bobby Shaw 1950-1952, 1987-1989 Wayne Groce 1952-1953 Harold Lane 1954-1955 Jim Cole 1955-1956 Tommy Rainer 1956-1957 Fred Elrod 1957-1958, 1963-1987 BARITONE James McCoy 1942-1958 Jimi Hall 1963-1969 JL Steele 1969-1986 BASS BC Robinson 1942-1943 Big Jim Waits 1943-1944, 1949-1952 John Hamrick 1946-1947 Aycel Soward 1947-1949, 1953-54, 1955 Johnny Atkinson 1952-1953 London Parris 1954 George Younce 1955 Rex Nelon 1955-1958 Bill Curtis 1963-1989 PIANO Hovie Lister 1942-1944 Lee Roy Abernathy 1946-1948, 1953-1954 Reece Crockett 1948-1949 Wally Varner 1949-1950, 1951-1953 Doy Ott 1950-1951 Randy Jones 1954-1955 Jack Clark 1955-1956, 1969-1989 ==References== ==External links== *Overview of Homeland Harmony Quartet Category:American gospel musical groups Category:Gospel quartets Category:Musical groups established in 1935 Category:Southern gospel performers ",
