Located on the Queiq Plain, between Azaz and \u00c7obanbey (al-Rai), the village is some north of the city of Aleppo, and just south of the border to the Turkish province of Kilis, and it has many families of Turkish ethnicity and background. Administratively the village belongs to Nahiya Sawran in Azaz District. Nearby localities include Kafr Ghan to the south and Hawar Kilis to the east. In the 2004 census, Zayzafun had a population of 820. ==Syrian Civil War== In the Syrian Civil War, the Ikadah IDP Camp, located north of the village at the border to Turkey, offered shelter to internally displaced persons (IDPs), mostly from the subdistricts of Azaz, Nubl, Tell Rifaat and Mare'. In April 2016, the Ikadah camp was filled with 7,763 IDPs, when an imminent ISIL counter-offensive prompted a complete evacuation of the Ikadah camp and neighboring camps near Shamarin and Harjala. On April 14, rebels retreated from Zayzafun and the neighboring villages down to Kafr Ghan and Baraghida, leaving the remaining rebel forces around Dudyan surrounded by ISIL. ==References== Category:Turkmen communities in Syria Category:Syrian people of Turkish descent ",
