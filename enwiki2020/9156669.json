    "text": "The 1998\u201399 League of Wales was the seventh season of the League of Wales, the top division of Welsh football. It began on 22 August 1998 and ended on 1 May 1999. The league was won for a record fourth consecutive season by Barry Town. Just 17 clubs competed in the league this season, as the 18th club Ebbw Vale (who had finished third the previous season) were expelled from the league before the season began due to financial difficulties, and promptly went out of business. ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
