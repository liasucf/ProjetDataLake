    "text": "The Saint-Gingolph\u2013Saint-Maurice railway is a single-track railway in Switzerland. It was opened on 14 July 1859 by the Ligne d\u2019Italie. It connects Le Bouveret on Lake Geneva with Saint-Maurice. The line to the French\u2013Swiss border near Saint-Gingolph was opened together with its continuation towards \u00c9vian-les-Bains on 1 June 1886. The line together with the French line to \u00c9vian is sometimes called the Tonkin Line, because construction workers saw similarities in the geological conditions to Indochina. It was the first railway line in the canton of Valais. A 691 metre-long tunnel had to be built on the approach to Saint-Maurice which is the only major structure of the line (the tunnel was shortened to 490 metres during an upgrade of the Simplon Railway to double track in 1906). == History== As early as 1852, a concession was sought for a line from Villeneuve to Aosta. Among other things, this did not proceed because the canton of Valais required two connecting lines, one between Martigny and Sion and one between Illersaz and Le Bouveret. An application submitted a year later for a line from Le Bouveret to Sion, however, was successful and received a federal concession. The line was planned as an international through route, but never operated in this manner. This was partly because its continuation, the Saint-Gingolph\u2013\u00c9vian railway, was opened in 1886 and thus after the opening of the Lausanne\u2013Brig line. The section of the line in France was built by the Compagnie des chemins de fer de Paris \u00e0 Lyon et \u00e0 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e (PLM). Passenger operations between \u00c9vian- les-Bains and Saint-Gingolph were closed in 1937. Freight on the line gained momentum during the Second World War, when it was the only line crossing into Switzerland that was not directly under the control of the Axis powers. Then it returned to insignificance, so that in 1988 all traffic ended on the French side. Since then, traffic has only run towards Saint-Maurice. The line between Saint-Maurice and Collombey was electrified in 1946 and the rest of the line to Saint-Gingolph in 1954. == Operations== Passenger traffic is limited to hourly regional trains operated by RegionAlps. These have increased in frequency, after it was one of the few lines in Switzerland where services had been reduced to a two-hour frequency in the 1990s. The regional services now end in Bouveret, but continue beyond Saint-Maurice to Brig. The line between Bouveret and Saint-Gingolph is used only by trains in the morning, at noon and in the evening. At other times, this route is served by a bus with a tight rail connection. Various sidings in Monthey and Collombey serve daily freight traffic towards Saint-Maurice. In addition to the sidings (Losinger, Givo., CABV, AGIP), only Monthey station is open on the basic network for single wagonload traffic. Although Bouveret is still open as an operating point for freight traffic, it is currently used very rarely. Therefore, there is no daily freight traffic between Saint-Gingolph and Monthey. ==References== ===Footnotes=== === Sources === * Category:Railway lines in Switzerland Category:Standard gauge railways in Switzerland Category:Buildings and structures in Valais Category:Railway lines opened in 1859 ",
