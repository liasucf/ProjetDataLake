Although various animal steaks can technically be char- grilled, the process is generally used to cook chuck steaks. Char-grilled steaks are grilled with charcoal, and are not to be confused with gas-grilled steaks, which are usually grilled with propane. The charcoal used to prepare char-grilled steaks is usually attributed to the richness of flavor of steaks cooked in this manner. == References == Category:Steak ",
