    "text": "Hurricane Hermine was the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Hurricane Wilma in 2005, and the first to develop in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Ingrid in 2013. The ninth tropical depression, eighth named storm, and fourth hurricane of the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, Hermine developed in the Florida Straits on August 28 from a long-tracked tropical wave. The precursor system dropped heavy rainfall in portions of the Caribbean, especially the Dominican Republic and Cuba. In the former, the storm damaged more than 200 homes and displaced over 1,000 people. Although some areas of Cuba recorded more than of rain, the precipitation was generally beneficial due to a severe drought. After being designated on August 29, Hermine shifted northeastwards due to a trough over Georgia and steadily intensified into an 80 mph (130 km/h) Category 1 hurricane just before making landfall in the Florida Panhandle during September 2\\. After moving inland, Hermine quickly weakened and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September 3 near the Outer Banks of North Carolina. The remnant system meandered offshore the Northeastern United States before dissipating over southeastern Massachusetts on September 8\\. In preparation of Hermine, multiple tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued in the Southeastern United States, while state of emergencies were declared in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey. Storm surge and heavy rainfall along the Florida gulf coast caused significant damage. In Citrus County, one of the worst areas impacted, 2,694 structures sustained damage, of which 531 suffered major damage, while damage reached about $102 million. Similar coastal and freshwater flooding occurred in Pasco County, where 7 homes were destroyed, 305 sustained major damage, and 1,564 received minor damage. Winds primarily left power outages and downed trees, some of which fell onto buildings and vehicles. About 325,000 people were left without electricity, including 80% of Tallahassee. One death occurred in the state after a tree fell on a homeless man's tent near Ocala. Flooding and fairly strong winds in other states such as Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina caused further damage, but to a lesser degree. One fatality each occurred in South Carolina and North Carolina. In New York, two fishermen drowned near the Wading River on Long Island due to rough surf. Overall, Hermine caused about $550 million (2016 USD) in damage in the United States. ==Meteorological history== A tropical wave emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the west coast of Africa between late August 16 and early August 17. On August 18, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) first noted the tropical wave as a potential area for development, associated with an area of disorganized convection about 300 mi (480 km) southwest of Cabo Verde. Environmental conditions were expected to be favorable for continued organization. Dry and stable air was an initial inhibiting factor in development, with deep convection waning on August 20 and August 21. However, the convection and circulation had become better defined by August 21. By August 23, the system had developed an elongated and poorly- defined circulation, as indicated by the Hurricane Hunters, though convention continued to expand. On the next day, the low pressure area crossed Guadeloupe into the Caribbean Sea while producing gale-force winds. By this point, the NHC noted that the system could develop into a tropical depression at any time, as the system was only lacking a well-defined circulation. Marginal wind shear disrupted the system's organization, and it passed north of Puerto Rico without further development, with winds dropping below gale-force on August 25. Initially, the system moved quickly westward with a forward speed averaging about , but slowed down considerably after the northern portion of the wave split off on August 26. The low pressure area crossed the southern Bahamas with scattered convection, becoming more defined on August 27 while moving near the northern Cuban coast. Wind shear prevented quicker development, although conditions became more favorable closer to the Gulf of Mexico. On August 28, the convection increased and became more organized. Later that day, the Hurricane Hunters observed a well-defined circulation. Based on the observations and the convective organization, it is estimated that Tropical Depression Nine developed at 18:00 UTC on August 28 while situated about 60 mi (100 km) south-southeast of Key West, Florida. A rainstorm on the edge of Hermine, shortly after the hurricane achieved Category 1 status. Deep convection increased further as the depression moved more into the Gulf of Mexico, steered by a ridge over southern Florida, although it remained ragged and displaced from the circulation. Dry air to the system's west negated the otherwise favorable warm waters. The depression failed to organize more on August 30 as the low- and mid-level circulations remained misaligned. A large plume of convection developed over the system on August 31 as outflow improved and wind shear decreased. Later that day, reports from the Hurricane Hunters indicated that the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Hermine about 395 mi (640 km) southwest of Apalachicola, Florida. Late on August 31, Hermine began accelerating to the northeast, influenced by a developing mid-level trough over the southeastern United States. Lessening shear and water temperatures around allowed the storm to intensify. Although outflow was restricted to the northwest, curved rainbands increased over the eastern half of the system, increasing the extent of tropical storm-force winds. Additionally, a ragged eye became visible on satellite imagery on September 1, and at 18:00 UTC, Hermine intensified into a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir\u2013Simpson scale. GPM Core Satellite on September 6 The hurricane strengthened slightly further to a peak intensity of 80 mph (130 km/h) by 00:00 UTC on September 2. At around 05:30 UTC (1:30 a.m. EDT) that day, Hermine made landfall just east of St. Marks, Florida, at peak intensity, with a minimum pressure of 981 mbar (hPa; 29.00 inHg). Hermine became the first hurricane to make landfall in Florida since Wilma on October 24, 2005. Within four hours of landfall, the winds dropped below hurricane force as the appearance on radar imagery degraded. The convection diminished while Hermine crossed into Georgia, with the strongest winds near the Atlantic coast. The center elongated as it continued quickly northeastward ahead of the trough. With the convection far ahead of the circulation, Hermine transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 12:00 UTC on September 3 as it emerged into the Atlantic Ocean from the Outer Banks of North Carolina. Dry air wrapped into the eastward-moving center, while convection pulsed north of the former hurricane, possibly due to the warmer waters of the Gulf Stream. By September 5, the system devolved into several rotating circulations as the overall system slowed and turned to the northwest, steered by a ridge to the north. The convection began waning on the next day, as the storm turned due westward. At 18:00 UTC on September 6, the NHC ceased issuing advisories on the post- tropical cyclone as Hermine continued to weaken amid cooler waters and convective stability. The remnants continued to meander offshore New Jersey and Long Island, eventually dissipating near Chatham, Massachusetts late on September 8. ==Preparations== Workers preparing sandbags ahead of Hermine in North Charleston, South Carolina On August 30, the NHC began issuing tropical cyclone warnings and watches for the Florida gulf coast. By the time Hermine reached hurricane status, a hurricane warning was in place from the mouth of the Suwannee River to Mexico Beach. A tropical storm warning extended southward to Englewood, which included the Tampa Bay Area, and westward to the Walton\u2013Bay county line. A hurricane watch was also in effect from the mouths of the Suwannee and Anclote rivers. On August 31, a tropical storm watch was added for the Atlantic coast between Marineland, Florida, to the Altamaha Sound in Georgia. As Hermine approached and moved up the coast, tropical storm warnings were in place as far south as Marineland, and as far northeast as Sagamore Beach, Massachusetts, including portions of the Tidal Potomac River, the Chesapeake and Delaware bays, Long Island Sound, New York City, Block Island, Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, and Cape Cod. All tropical storm warnings were dropped when the NHC discontinued advisories at 18:00 UTC on September 6. Florida Governor Rick Scott declared a state of emergency for 51 counties. In response to the then-developing storm, early voting for the primary election on August 30 was extended by one day in Bradford, Broward, Charlotte, Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade, Orange, Osceola, Palm Beach. and Pinellas counties. In six counties, school was canceled on September 1 and 2, while twenty-nine other counties had no school on September 2. Mandatory evacuations were ordered for portions of Dixie, Franklin, Taylor, and Wakulla counties. States of emergencies were declared in Georgia, North Carolina, Virginia, Maryland, and New Jersey due to the storm. Hermine affected the east coast of the United States during the busy Labor Day weekend, causing many beaches to be closed in Delaware, New Jersey, and New York. Amtrak canceled or altered train lines due to the threat from the storm. In Savannah, Georgia, Bacon Fest was cancelled, and a beer fest was moved indoors. In Charleston, South Carolina, the city government provided 3,000 sandbags to residents, preparing less than a year after damaging floods hit the state. Outer Banks ferry service was cancelled and bridges in Dare County, North Carolina, were closed due to the high winds. Officials deployed or readied swift water teams, helicopters, and the North Carolina National Guard in the eastern portion of the state. The Virginia National Guard utilized 270 members to help prepare for the storm's potential flooding and power outages. A Bruce Springsteen concert in Virginia Beach, Virginia, was postponed two days, and several performances for the town's American Music Festival were cancelled or moved indoors. ==Impact== ===Caribbean=== On Antigua, a lightning strike produced by thunderstorms associated with the precursor tropical wave severely damaged two 69 kV transmission lines, causing an island-wide blackout on August 24. Some locations in Puerto Rico observed of rainfall, causing flooding, especially in the Ponce area. Primarily, streets were inundated with water, though at least one house was flooded. In the Dominican Republic, some areas received nearly of rain on August 25 alone from Hermine's precursor. In 19 provinces, residents and authorities were on alert due to rapidly rising rivers and expectations of flooding. Throughout the country, the storm damaged more than 200 homes and displaced over 1,000 people. While in its developmental stages, the precursor low dropped of rainfall across northern Cuba. Candelaria in western Cuba recorded . At Cienfuegos, of precipitation fell in only three hours. The rains alleviated drought conditions and helped replenish reservoirs, while also causing landslides. The Zaza Reservoir \u2013 the largest in Cuba \u2013 increased its total water volume by , bringing the levels to 30% capacity. In Bataban\u00f3 on Cuba's southern coast, of rainfall caused moderate flooding. Near Havana, the electric company shut off power to prevent accidents, while damage occurred to gas lines. ===United States=== Total economic losses across the United States reached US$550 million. Insured losses to property in Florida reached US$80 million with 14,890 claims. ====Florida==== Infrared satellite loop of Hermine making landfall in Florida on September 2 Ahead of the hurricane's landfall, a station south of Apalachicola reported wind gusts of at an elevation of . At sea level, sustained winds reached at Keaton Beach, with gusts . While moving ashore, Hermine produced a storm surge at Cedar Key. Heavy rainfall occurred across western Florida, reaching over 72 hours at the Lake Tarpon Canal in Pinellas County. The outer rainbands of Hermine spawned an EF0 tornado just southwest of Windermere with a width of and winds. On the ground for , the twister damaged about 100 trees, along with several fences and windows. The storm spawned three other EF0 tornadoes, all in Taylor County, none of which caused damage. High winds from the hurricane knocked down many trees in northwestern Florida, some of which fell onto power lines and roofs. The resulting power outages affected about 325,000 people, roughly 1% of all homes and businesses in the state. In Leon County, where the state capital Tallahassee is, 57% of homes lost power, including approximately 80% of the city proper, as well as Florida State University. Of the 145,000 homes and businesses that lost electricity, 3,685 were still without power six days after the storm. Strong winds in the Tallahassee area caused trees to fall onto several houses, injuring a number of people. Hermine was the first hurricane to directly affect the city since Hurricane Kate in 1985. Throughout Leon County, 45 homes or businesses were destroyed, 187 suffered severe damage, and 259 experienced minor damage. Losses across Leon County reached $10.3 million.

The winds downed approximately 1,000 pecans trees, leaving about $3 million in damage to the pecan crop. Property damage totaled around $1 million. Sewer systems were overwhelmed by heavy rainfall, causing up a sewage spillage of up to 117,000 gallons. Post-Tropical Cyclone Hermine southeast of New England on September 5 The storm flooded roads and downed trees in South Carolina, mostly in Beaufort, Bluffton, and Hilton Head Island. At Hilton Head Island, falling trees severely damaged 13 homes, one of which just over two weeks after a tree had fallen in the same manner upon the same house. Damage to the dwellings reached about $250,000. Falling trees damaged at least two homes in Edisto Beach, while strong winds deroofed and ripped sidings off several other residences. In Cottageville, a man was killed after being hit by a car while he was removing a fallen tree from the highway. In the Charleston area, the airport observed a daily rainfall record of on September 2\\. A number of roads were flooded in downtown Charleston and North Charleston. In Dorchester County, high winds downed a number of trees, some of which caused roads to be closed. A tree also struck a liquid oxygen tank at the medical center in Summerville, causing a leak that forced the closure of all entrances to the complex. Nearly 7,000 people in the county were left without electricity at the height of the storm. Strong winds in eastern North Carolina resulted in sporadic power outages. Hermine spawned two EF1 tornadoes and one EF0 tornado over Outer Banks. One knocking over two trailers and injuring four people. The tornadoes collectively left about $30,000 in damage. High winds knocked over an 18-wheeler tractor-trailer crossing the Alligator River bridge on U.S. Route 64, killing the driver. Flooding covered portions of Highway 12, the main roadway through the Outer Banks. Bands of heavy rain associated with Hermine produced rainfall totals of over most of the region, with the highest amounts near the coast. Widespread poor drainage flooding occurred, with a few reports of flash flooding. Damage across Dare County reached $5.5 million; most of the damage was concentrated on Hatteras Island with flooding in Frisco and Hatteras. In Virginia, abnormally high tides resulted in coastal flooding, particularly in the Norfolk area. A number of low-lying and flood prone neighborhoods were inundated, while Willoughby Spit became impassable. Cars parked at Hague Tower apartments were submerged up to their windows. In Virginia Beach, winds downed signs and branches and ripped siding from a hotel. At another hotel, some rooms suffered roof leaks. On eastern Long Island, two fishermen drowned after being swept into the ocean near the Wading River due to rough surf. Their bodies were later recovered in Shoreham. Nantucket offshore Massachusetts recorded sustained winds of on September 5, with gusts to . Royal Caribbean's Anthem of the Seas encountered seas and winds on its trek from New Jersey to Bermuda, leaving several passengers seasick. In Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, minor wind damage occurred because trees were still fully leaved in those states. Coastal flooding was limited due to storm surge peaking at low tide. ==Aftermath== After Hermine exited the state, Florida governor Rick Scott took an aerial tour of the damage in Cedar Key and Steinhatchee, pledging that affected businesses would receive assistance from the state government. On September 20, Governor Scott submitted a request to the federal government for individual disaster assistance in 12 counties and public assistance in 15 counties. United States president Barack Obama issued a disaster declaration on September 28\\. Residents and households in Citrus, Dixie, Hernando, Hillsborough, Leon, Levy, Pasco, and Pinellas counties became eligible for aid. In Citrus, Dixie, Franklin, Jefferson, Lafayette, Leon, Levy, Liberty, Madison, Pasco, Pinellas, Suwannee, Taylor, and Wakulla counties, money was allotted to state and local governments as well as some private, nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis; this fund allowed for emergency work on or replacement of buildings damaged by the storm. Additionally, the state of Florida received money from the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program for hazard mitigation. However, the disaster declaration was eventually expanded to several other counties. By November 2, Alachua, Baker, Columbia, Gadsden, Gilchrist, Manatee, Marion, Sarasota, Sumter, and Union counties were eligible for public assistance or both public and individual assistance. In addition to federal aid, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) opened five disaster recovery centers, with one in Citrus County, one in Dixie County, one in Leon County, and two in Levy County. These disaster centers were staffed by representatives of FEMA, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the Small Business Administration, and other state agencies. FEMA agents also went door-to-door in Tallahassee to ask residents about damage to their property. In Lee County, crews were deployed to collect plant debris. Due to storm damage, officials in Hernando County provided curbside debris removal, and two parks were closed. The post office in Cedar Key was damaged severely enough to remain closed for repairs until February, while the city hall has yet to reopen. In the meantime, city business has been conducted in a double-wide trailer near the city hall. In Franklin County, the St. George Island Bridge was reopened just 15 hours after its closure to allow access to cleanup crews. ==See also== * List of Florida hurricanes (2000\u2013present) * Hurricane Agnes \u2013 made landfall in the Florida panhandle and took a similar path * Tropical Storm Colin (2016) \u2013 took a similar path just less than 3 months earlier * Hurricane Earl (1998) \u2013 struck the Florida panhandle as a Category 2 hurricane * Hurricane Gordon (2000) \u2013 moved ashore near Cedar Key, Florida, and proceeded up the east coast * Hurricane Kate (1985) \u2013 Category 3 hurricane with similar track and landfall location * Hurricane Michael \u2013 made landfall in a similar location as a Category 5 hurricane * Hurricane Sandy \u2013 made landfall on New Jersey as an extratropical storm, causing widespread flood and tree damage ==References== ==External links== * Hurricane Hermine Advisory Archive Category:2016 Atlantic hurricane season Category:August 2016 events in the United States Category:Hurricanes in Florida Category:September 2016 events in the United States Category:Category 1 Atlantic hurricanes Category:2016 natural disasters in the United States Hermine ",
