    "text": "Forest Park Parkway is a parkway in St. Louis, Missouri that runs from I-170 in Clayton, Missouri, becomes Forest Park Avenue at Kingshighway Boulevard, and ends at Market and I-64. It is considered an arterial snow route. The corridor began life in the 19th century as a heavy rail line used by the Wabash and Rock Island rail systems. The heavy rail line was replaced with streetcars, and later, the Parkway. Before 1959, Forest Park Avenue ran west from the city and terminated at the eastern edge of Forest Park, at Kingshighway Boulevard. Construction on the route west of Kingshighway to the suburban community of Clayton began in 1959. == Major Intersections == {| class=\"wikitable\" !County !Location !mi !km !Destination / Intersection !Notes |- | colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"6\" |City of St. Louis |0.00 |0.00 |Market Street / I-64 East |Beginning of Forest Park Ave |- |0.6 |0.96 |Vandeventer Ave | |- |2.0 |3.21 |Kingshighway Blvd |Western Terminus of Avenue Beginning of Parkway |- |2.6 |4.18 |Lindell / Union Blvd |Eastbound / Westbound Exit Eastbound only entrance |- |3.2 |5.14 |DeBaliviere Ave | |- |4.1 |6.59 |Skinker Blvd | |- | rowspan=\"6\" |St. Louis County | rowspan=\"3\" |University City |4.8 |7.72 |Big Bend Blvd | |- |5.2 |8.36 |Pershing Ave |No access for eastbound Parkway Traffic |- |6.2 |9.97 |Bemiston Ave |Eastbound Entrance / Westbound Exit Signed as \"Clayton Business District\" |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Clayton |6.3 |10.13 |Central Ave (Government Center) |Westbound Exit Only |- |6.4 |10.29 |Brentwood Blvd |Eastbound Exit / Westbound Entrance |- |6.8 |10.94 |I-170 - St. Louis Lambert International Airport, I-64 |Western Terminus |} ==References== Category:Parkways in the United States Category:Transportation in St. Louis County, Missouri Category:Streets in St. Louis ",
