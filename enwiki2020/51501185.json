    "text": "G\u2013E\u2013G figure The millennial whoop is a vocal melodic pattern alternating between the fifth and third notes in a major scale, typically starting on the fifth, in the rhythm of straight 8th-notes, and often using the \"wa\" and \"oh\" syllables. It was used extensively in 2010s pop music. == Overview == The term was coined by the musician Patrick Metzger, who described it in a blog entry on The Patterning in August 2016. He suggested that, while the millennial whoop gained popularity from the late 2000s to 2010s, it has probably always been around. An earlier use can be heard in the 1983 song \"Jungle Love\" by The Time. The 2017 song \"Millennial Whoop\" by American rock band the Pilgrims was written as a response to the idea of older generations looking down upon the younger for using such tropes: the song makes use of the interval pattern. == Lawsuit == In 2013 songwriter Ally Burnett sued Carly Rae Jepsen and Owl City over their 2012 song \"Good Time\", arguing similarities to her 2010 song \"Ah, It's a Love Song\" and its use of the millennial whoop. Jepsen settled out of court, but Owl City won. == Uses == Songs where the millennial whoop appear include: * \"Jungle Love\" (1983, Morris Day and the Time) * \"Tarzan Boy\" (1985, Baltimora) (the B-part of the ABAB-structured chorus) * \"Aaya Mausam Dosti Ka\" (1989, Maine Pyar Kiya) (parts similar to \"Tarzan Boy\") * \"In the Shadows\" (2003, The Rasmus) * \u201dPoker Face (song)\u201d (2008, Lady Gaga) * \"Tik Tok (song)\" (2009, Kesha) * \"Bad Romance\" (2009, Lady Gaga) * \"California Gurls\" (2010, Katy Perry) * \"Good Time\" (2012, Carly Rae Jepsen and Owl City) * \"The Mother We Share\" (2012, Chvrches) * \"Habits (Stay High)\" (2013, Tove Lo) * \"Really Don't Care\" (2013, Demi Lovato featuring Cher Lloyd) * \"Ivy\" (2016, Frank Ocean) * \"This Is Me\" (2017, from The Greatest Showman) http://www.curzonblog.com/all-posts/2018/1/28/best-original-song-2018 * The theme for the American animated television series DuckTales. == See also == * Nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah nyah * Harmonic series == References == NerdSync. \"Why the DUCKTALES Theme Song is Stuck in Your Head Right Now...\", YouTube. 4 November 2017.
