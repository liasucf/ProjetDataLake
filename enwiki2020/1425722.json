    "text": "The Look of Love is the sixth studio album by Canadian singer Diana Krall, released on September 18, 2001 by Verve Records. It became Krall's first album to top the Canadian Albums Chart. In 2002, the album earned Al Schmitt the Grammy Award for Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical, and received the Juno Award for Album of the Year in Canada. Arranger Claus Ogerman uses a similar orchestration for \"S'Wonderful\" as the one he wrote for the 1976 Jo\u00e3o Gilberto album Amoroso. ==Reception== Jim Santella of All About Jazz commented \"Lush strings and gliding flutes surround Diana Krall's tender vocals. Even her substantial piano interludes take on the appearance of drifting mists, through the mix of orchestral timbres. With an emphasis on her sultry vocal interpretations, the latest album reaches out to a broad, popular music audience. Nothing wrong with that. It's just that jazz fans usually want the improvised licks along with their melodies... By interpreting classic love songs, Krall's latest album turns toward romantic interests. The clutter of a large string orchestra, however, obscures the total picture\". John Kreicbergs of PopMatters added \"Simply said, her piano chops are more than adequate to back up her incredible voice. Yet this is exactly what makes The Look of Love so maddening. Krall's piano work is practically nonexistent on most of the tracks, save for a few perfunctory solos that often sink into in a sea of overly lush string and orchestral arrangements\". Doug Ramsey of JazzTimes said \"The songs, including Burt Bacharach\u2019s title tune, are superb. The arrangements and performances enhance them. Krall\u2019s singing has improved with her every album. It is at a high level. If her record company can make her a major star with albums this good, and if it doesn\u2019t push her piano further into the background, serious listeners should have no complaint\". A reviewer of Cosmopolis noted \"With her new album The Look of Love, Diana Krall confirms her exceptional status as a jazz singer. Her new CD is a touch too polished, too clean, but never kitsch, as one might have feared, since the album was recorded together with the London Symphony Orchestra. But the special, sometimes rough-edged character of her previous recordings is missing\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of The Look of Love. ===Musicians=== * Diana Krall \u2013 piano, vocals * Dori Caymmi \u2013 guitar * Christian McBride \u2013 bass * Jeff Hamilton \u2013 drums * Paulinho da Costa \u2013 percussion * Los Angeles Session Orchestra \u2013 orchestra * Russell Malone \u2013 guitar * Peter Erskine \u2013 drums * London Symphony Orchestra \u2013 orchestra * John Pisano \u2013 guitar * Romero Lubambo \u2013 guitar * Luis Conte \u2013 percussion * Claus Ogerman \u2013 orchestra arrangement, conducting ===Technical=== * Tommy LiPuma \u2013 production * Al Schmitt \u2013 recording, mixing * Aya Takemura \u2013 engineering assistance * Chris Clark \u2013 engineering assistance * Richard Lancaster \u2013 engineering assistance * John Hendrickson \u2013 engineering assistance ; additional engineering * Doug Sax \u2013 mastering * Robert Hadley \u2013 mastering * Bill Smith \u2013 engineering assistance * Nat Peck \u2013 contractor for the London Symphony Orchestra * Jules Chaikin \u2013 contractor for the Los Angeles Session Orchestra ===Artwork=== * Hollis King \u2013 art direction * Isabelle Wong \u2013 design * Donna Ranieri \u2013 photography production * Bruce Weber \u2013 photography * Jane Shirek \u2013 photos of Diana Krall in car ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001\u20132002) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (Music & Media) | 14 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Japanese Albums (Oricon) | 34 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portuguese Albums (AFP) | 1 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Spanish Albums (AFYVE) | 17 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Swedish Jazz Albums (Sverigetopplistan) | 1 |- |- |- |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2001) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 95 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| European Albums (Music & Media) | 97 |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 41 |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Albums (RMNZ) | 46 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 195 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 1 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2002) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Albums (ARIA) | 37 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 1 |- ! scope=\"row\"| French Albums (SNEP) | 81 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Billboard 200 | 91 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 1 |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 6 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 3 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2004) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 20 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2006) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 15 |} {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2007) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australian Jazz & Blues Albums (ARIA) | 13 |} ===Decade-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2000\u20132009) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Top Jazz Albums (Billboard) | 5 |} ==Certifications== ==Notes== ==References== Category:2001 albums Category:Albums arranged by Claus Ogerman Category:Albums produced by Tommy LiPuma Category:Albums recorded at Abbey Road Studios Category:Albums recorded at Avatar Studios Category:Albums recorded at Capitol Studios Category:Covers albums Category:Diana Krall albums Category:Juno Award for Album of the Year albums Category:Juno Award for Vocal Jazz Album of the Year albums Category:Verve Records albums ",
