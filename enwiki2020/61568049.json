In January 2014 he agreed to a deal with Italian Serie A side Udinese from Ponte Preta's under-17 squad. He was later assigned to Granada CF, a club in the same ownership group as Udinese in Giampaolo Pozzo, joining their reserve team in November 2014 but could only be registered the following January after he turned 18. Matheus made his senior debut on 15 March 2015, playing the last 12 minutes in a 0\u20131 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B away loss against Arroyo CP. His first goal came on 4 October 2015, as he scored the opener in a 1\u20131 home draw against M\u00e9rida AD. On 27 April 2017, Matheus joined fellow third division side Lorca FC on loan for two months, as an injury replacement to Chumbi, helping the team win promotion to the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n via the playoffs for the first time in the team's history. In July 2017, now owned by Watford, another club of the Pozzo ownership family, Matheus returned to the Spanish third division on loan with CF Fuenlabrada. On 30 January 2018, Matheus was loaned to Valencia CF Mestalla. ===Mirand\u00e9s=== On 22 August 2015, Matheus agreed to a one-year loan deal with fellow third division CD Mirand\u00e9s, achieving promotion at the end of the 2018\u201319 season. His loan was renewed for a further season as the team entered LaLiga 2. He made his professional debut on 17 August, starting in a 2\u20132 away draw against Rayo Vallecano. During the team's run to the 2019\u201320 Copa del Rey semifinals, Matheus finished as the competition's second-highest scorer behind Alexander Isak and became the first player in a decade to score against four different La Liga opponents for a team in a lower division after netting against Celta Vigo, Sevilla, Villarreal and Real Sociedad. Only Lionel Messi and Luis Su\u00e1rez had done so in that time. ===Orlando City=== On 21 August 2020, Matheus signed a two-and-a-half year deal with MLS side Orlando City. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+Appearances and goals by club, season and competition ! rowspan=\"2\" |Club ! rowspan=\"2\" |Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League ! colspan=\"2\" |Cup ! colspan=\"2\" |Other ! colspan=\"2\" |Total |- !Division !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Granada B |2014\u201315 | rowspan=\"3\" |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |3||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||3||0 |- |2015\u201316 |17||2|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||17||2 |- |2016\u201317 |33||16|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||33||16 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !53!!18!!0!!0!!0!!0!!53!!18 |- |Lorca (loan) |2016\u201317 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |2||1||0||0||22017 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B play-offs||0||4||1 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Watford |2017\u201318 | rowspan=\"3\" |Premier League |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0!!0 |- |Fuenlabrada (loan) | rowspan=\"2\" |2017\u201318 | rowspan=\"3\" |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |13||3||2||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||15||3 |- |Valencia B (loan) |3||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||3||0 |- | rowspan=\"3\" |Mirand\u00e9s (loan) |2018\u201319 |34||8||1||0||52019 Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B play-offs||3||40||11 |- |2019\u201320 |LaLiga 2 |27||6||7||6|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||34||12 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !61!!14!!8!!6!!5!!3!!74!!23 |- |Orlando City |2020 |MLS |0||0|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- ! colspan=\"3\" |Career total !132!!36!!10!!6!!7!!3!!149!!45 |} ==References== ==External links== * * *Matheus Orlando City profile Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:People from S\u00e3o Paulo (state) Category:Brazilian footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Club Recreativo Granada players Category:Lorca FC players Category:CF Fuenlabrada footballers Category:Valencia CF Mestalla footballers Category:CD Mirand\u00e9s footballers Category:Orlando City SC players Category:Brazilian expatriate footballers Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in Spain Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Brazilian expatriate sportspeople in the United States Category:Expatriate soccer players in the United States ",
