    "text": "Pierre-Louis Roederer, 1789 Comte Pierre Louis Roederer (15 February 1754 - 17 December 1835) was a French politician, economist, and historian, politically active in the era of the French Revolution and First French Republic. Roederer's son, Baron Antoine Marie Roederer (1782\u20131865), also became a noted political figure. ==Biography== ===Early activities=== Born in Metz, the son of a magistrate, he studied Law at the University of Strasbourg, and, at the age of twenty-five, became councillor at the parlement of Metz (in exchange for 32,000 livres), and was commissioned in 1787 to draw up a list of remonstrances. During the period, he became an admirer of the economist Adam Smith, and helped make his works known in France. His 1787 work Suppression des douanes int\u00e9rieures advocated the suppression of internal customs houses; the 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica describes it as \"an elaborate treatise on the laws of commerce and on the theory of customs imposts\". On the proposition of Roederer, in 1787, the Royal Society of Science and Arts of Metz offered a prize for the best essay in answer to the question: \"What are the best means to make the Jews happier and more useful in France?\". Abb\u00e9 Gregoire was one of three laureates with his Essay on the physical, moral and political regeneration of the Jews. It was the first step towards their emancipation, which was always defended by Roederer. In 1788 he published the boldly liberal pamphlet D\u00e9putation aux \u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux (\"Deputation to the Estates-General\"). Partly on the strength of this he was elected deputy to the Estates-General by the Third Estate of the bailliage of Metz. Although not present at the event of June 1789, Roederer was sketched by Jacques-Louis David into his drawing of the Tennis Court Oath. In the National Constituent Assembly, Roederer was a member of the committee of taxes (comit\u00e9 des contributions), prepared a scheme for a new system of taxation, drew up a law on patents, occupied himself with the laws relating to revenue stamps and assignats, and was successful in opposing the introduction of an income tax. ===Paris Directory and hiding=== After the close of the Constituent Assembly, he was elected, on 11 November 1791, procureur g\u00e9n\u00e9ral syndic of the d\u00e9partment of Paris. The directory of the d\u00e9partment, of which the Duc de la Rochefoucauld d'Enville was president, was at this time in pronounced opposition to the radical views that dominated the Legislative Assembly and the Jacobin Club, and Roederer was not altogether in touch with his colleagues. For example, he took no share in signing their protest against the law against the non-juring clergy as a violation of religious liberty. But the directory did not long survive: with the growing revolutionary opposition in the capital, many of its members resigned and fled, and their places could not be filled. Roederer himself left in his Chronique des cinquante jours (\"Chronicle of fifty days\", 1832) an account of the pitiable part played by the directory of the d\u00e9partment in the critical period between the failed insurrection of 20 June 1792 and the successful insurrection of 10 August. Seeing the perilous drift of things, he had tried to get into touch with King Louis XVI, and it was on his advice that the latter took refuge in the Assembly on the same 10 August. Roederer himself fell under suspicion and went into hiding during the Reign of Terror, emerging again only after the fall of Maximilien Robespierre and the start of the Thermidorian Reaction. ===Consulate, Empire, and later life=== Arms of Roederer In 1796, he was made a member of the Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise, was appointed to a professorship of political economy, and founded the Journal d'\u00e9conomie publique, de morale et de legislation. Having escaped deportation at the time of the coup d'\u00e9tat of 18 Fructidor, he took part in organizing Napoleon Bonaparte's 18 Brumaire Coup\u2014alongside Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s, Charles Maurice de Talleyrand, Saint-Jean d'Ang\u00e9ly, and Count Volnay\u2014and wrote the Adresse aux Parisiens (Napoleon's speech to the people of Paris, given immediately after the coup). He was appointed by Napoleon member of the council of state and senator. Roederer and Talleyrand contributed to Charles- Fran\u00e7ois Lebrun's rise past Siey\u00e8s, and the former's appointment as Consul. In 1800, Roederer was Minister Plenipotentiary to the Batavian and Helvetic Republics. He received the Legion of Honor in 1803, and was made a Grand Officier in December 1807. Under the Empire, Roederer, whose public influence was very considerable, was Joseph Bonaparte's minister of finance in the Kingdom of Naples (1806), assistant of Joseph in Spain (1809), administrator of the Grand Duchy of Berg (1810), and imperial commissary in the south of France. During the Hundred Days he was created a Peer of France. The Bourbon Restoration government stripped him of his offices and dignities, and he became mayor of La Fert\u00e9-sous-Jouarre in April 1816. He recovered the title of Peer in 1832, following the July Revolution of 1830. He died in Bursard, Orne. == Works == * Dialogue concernant le colportage des marchandises (1783) * En quoi consiste la prosp\u00e9rit\u00e9 d'un pays (1787) * De la d\u00e9putation aux \u00c9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux (1788) * M\u00e9moires sur l'administration du d\u00e9partement de Paris; Des institutions fun\u00e9raires convenables \u00e0 une r\u00e9publique; De l'int\u00e9r\u00eat des comit\u00e9s de la Convention (1795) * M\u00e9moires d'\u00e9conomie publique, de morale et de politique, 2 vol.; De la philosophie moderne (1799) * Petits \u00e9crits concernant de grands \u00e9crivains (1803) * De la propri\u00e9t\u00e9 consid\u00e9r\u00e9e dans ses rapports avec les droits politiques (1819) * Louis XII (1820) * Fran\u00e7ois I (1825) * Com\u00e9dies historiques, de Louis XII \u00e0 la mort de Henri IV (1827\u201330) * L'Esprit de la r\u00e9volution de 1789 (1831) * La Premi\u00e8re et la deuxi\u00e8me ann\u00e9e du consulat de Bonaparte (\"The first and second year of Bonaparte's consulate\", 1802) * Nouvelles bases d'\u00e9lection; Cons\u00e9quences du syst\u00e8me de Cour \u00e9tabli sous Fran\u00e7ois Ier (1830) * Esprit de la R\u00e9volution de 1789 (1831) * Chronique de cinquante jours, du 20 juin au 10 ao\u00fbt 1792, r\u00e9dig\u00e9e sur pi\u00e8ces authentiques, an account of the events of the 10th of August 1792 (1832) * Adresse d\u2019un constitutionnel aux constitutionnels; M\u00e9moires pour servir \u00e0 l'histoire de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 polie en France (1835) == References == * The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, in turn, cites: ** Pierre Louis Roederer, \u0152uvres, edited by his son (Paris, 1853 seq.) ** Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve, Causeries du lundi, vol. viii.
