Seated: Carl Rinehart, Skeeter Swann, \"Rat\" Rinehart The 1901-02 Oregon Agricultural College men's basketball team was the first in the history of the school, known today as Oregon State University. The team sport was organized by W.O. \"Dad\" Trine, who was also the school's track coach. The nickname of OAC teams in this era was the \"Aggies,\" with today's team name, the \"Beavers\" first adopted during the decade of the 1910s. The team was independent, scheduling games on an ad hoc basis rather than as part of a formal sports conference. ==Team history== ===Background=== Basketball was invented in December 1891 by physical education teacher James Naismith and rapidly achieved popularity as an indoor sport for the winter season.\"Naismith Invents Basketball on December 21, 1891,\" McGill University Channels, www.mcgill.ca/ The sport came to Oregon rapidly, being declared \"all the rage\" as a training sport for football participants in January 1893, with the Salem YMCA forced to add additional classes to meet surging demand.\"Gymnastic Classes,\" Daily Oregon Statesman [Salem], vol. 42, no. 245 (Jan. 15, 1893), p. 4.

Scheduling was handled by the team manager, Mr. J.H. Gallagher. A news item in the Corvallis Gazette of January 8, 1901 mentions the name of former OAC student Fred W. Smith as \"the father of basketball at that institution.\"\"Local News,\" Corvallis Semi-Weekly Gazette, vol. 1, no. 37 (Jan. 8, 1901), p. 3.

Corvallis, OR: Oregon State College Alumni Association, 1938; p. 97. It was not until 1901-02, when track coach W.O. \"Dad\" Trine formally established the school's first men's basketball squad. Trine would serve as the team's coach until he was replaced in 1908 by E.D. Angell.
