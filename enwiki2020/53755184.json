Anderson-Dolan was selected in the second round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft, 41st overall, by the Kings. ==Playing career== ===Junior=== As a 14-year old with the Edge School Mountaineers Bantam AAA team, Anderson-Dolan scored 103 points in 50 games. Anderson-Dolan was drafted 14th in the 2014 WHL Bantam Draft to the Spokane Chiefs. He was expected to be one of the top 5 selections but slipped because some teams did not want to draft him because of his family situation. He put up 76 points in 72 regular season games in his sophomore 2016\u201317 season. He ended the season as the 21st ranked North American skater by NHL Central Scouting. ===Professional=== Anderson-Dolan was drafted 41st overall in the 2nd round of the 2017 NHL Entry Draft by the Los Angeles Kings. He signed a three-year entry level contract with the Kings on September 25, 2017. After completing the 2017\u201318 season with the Chiefs, Anderson-Dolan was loaned to the Kings American Hockey League affiliate, the Ontario Reign, on April 6, 2018. After attending the Kings training camp, Anderson-Dolan was named to the Kings opening night roster. Sitting as a healthy scratch for the Kings first game on October 5, he made his NHL debut on October 7 against the Detroit Red Wings. By making his debut, Anderson-Dolan became the youngest Kings player since Craig Redmond in 1984 and 10th youngest in franchise history. Two games later on October 11, he recorded his first career NHL point, an assist on Michael Amadio's goal, in a 3\u20130 win over the Montreal Canadiens. He was reassigned to the Spokane Chiefs on October 22, after playing in five NHL games and earning one point, and in the same day was added to Team WHL to compete at the 2018 CHL Canada/Russia Series. The following day, Anderson-Dolan was named co-captain of the Chiefs alongside Ty Smith. On March 16, 2019 Anderson-Dolan was awarded the Chiefs' Players' Player award for the 2018\u201319 season. ==International play== On April 12, 2017, Anderson-Dolan was selected as team captain to represent Canada at the 2017 IIHF World U18 Championships. Team Canada was eliminated in the quarter-finals against Sweden. On December 25, 2018, Anderson-Dolan was named an alternate captain for Team Canada, along with Evan Bouchard and Ian Mitchell, for the 2019 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. ==Personal life== Prior to his draft year, Anderson-Dolan's personal life drew significant interest from hockey personnel. Anderson-Dolan and his older brother, Dorian were raised by two mothers, Fran and Nancy. As a result of his upbringing, Anderson-Dolan has been active in promoting support for the LGBTQ community and in efforts to end homophobia. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"101\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"101\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
