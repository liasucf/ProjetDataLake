    "text": "Nicolae T. Or\u0103\u0219anu (1833?-August 7, 1890) was a Wallachian-born Romanian poet, prose writer and newspaper editor. Born in Craiova, he attended high school at Saint Sava College in the national capital Bucharest. As a young man, Or\u0103\u0219anu entered politics and the newspaper business; his was a rebellious spirit that rejected autocracy and embraced being in opposition. Together with C. A. Rosetti, he edited \u021a\u00e2n\u021barul in 1859. Then, on his own, he edited a series of satirical gazettes. These mainly had ingenious demonic titles: Spiridu\u0219, Nichipercea, Cicala, Sarsail\u0103, Urzic\u0103torul, Asmodeu, but also Opiniunea na\u021bional\u0103, Daracul, Ghimpele, Farfara and Cucu. At the same time, he published brochures in the same style: Coarnele lui Nichipercea, Coada lui Nichipercea, Ochiul dracului, Codi\u021ba dracului, Ghearele dracului. Or\u0103\u0219anu signed either using his initials or pen names such as G. Palicaropol, Cet\u0103\u021benescu, Iago, Ioana lui Vi\u0219an, V\u0103duva, Netto, Nicor, Odoba\u0219a and Or\u0103\u0219enescu. Or\u0103\u0219anu made his published debut early, with the 1854 volume Floricele de prim\u0103var\u0103. This featured sentimental poems that formed a marked contrast to his biting temperament, yielding to the prevailing Romantic mood. His main literary preoccupation became the \"rhymed chronicle\", cultivated with a certain trivial verve and appearing in a series of brochures with parodic titles such as Misterele mahalalelor sau Cronica scandaloas\u0103 a ora\u0219ului (vol. I-IX, 1857-1858), T\u00e2rgul cu idei sau Buletinul Ci\u0219megiului (vol. I-IX, 1857) and Trei fe\u021bi logofe\u021bi sau Povestea lui F\u00e2l-f\u00e2l-son (1857). Through such \"verse novels\", at least insofar as typology, attitude and vernacular style are concerned, Or\u0103\u0219anu was a precursor to the literature of the slum. He was more successful as a memoirist, in the 1861 \u00centemni\u021b\u0103rile mele politice. He drew upon the example of Silvio Pellico to evoke his prison experiences, leavening his narrative with humor. In the brochure O pagin\u0103 a vie\u021bii mele sau 22, 23 \u0219i 24 ianaurie 1859, another memoir, he claimed to have played a much-exaggerated role in the election as domnitor of Alexandru Ion Cuza. The writer later became an adversary of the ruler, directing the verse pamphlet Trefleac voivod against him. He translated works by Charles Paul de Kock (Sora Ana, 1856), Jean-Pierre Claris de Florian (Gonzalv de Cordova, 1858) and Jean-Louis Carra (Istoria Moldaviii \u0219i a Rom\u00e2niii). Or\u0103\u0219anu worked as an inspector at the tobacco monopoly and then at the liquor taxation office, and was twice a manager at Monitorul Oficial and at the official press, Imprimeria Statului. Nevertheless, his financial situation was insecure. More than his writings, his biography makes Or\u0103\u0219anu a very colorful figure during a period of transition. He died in Negreni, Olt County.Aurel Sasu (ed.), Dic\u021bionarul biografic al literaturii rom\u00e2ne, vol. II, pp. 263-4.
