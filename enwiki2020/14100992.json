He was a pioneer member of the Committee for the Defence of Human Rights (CDHR), one of the earliest human rights organizations in Nigeria which was formed in 1989 to defend the rights of the people detained by the then federal military government. He was also a member of the National Consultative Forum (NCF), the first group in Nigeria to fight for the convocation of Sovereign National Conference (SNC) and whose progressive elements later formed the Campaign for Democracy (CD) in 1991. In 1992, he teamed up with Frederick Fasehun, Baba Omojola, and several other labour leaders and student activists to form the Movement for Social and Economic Justice (MOSEJ) and later became its Executive Director. Thereafter, he and few other Pan-Yoruba pro-democracy activists led by Fasehun conceived and formed the Oodua People's Congress (OPC), a Yoruba Nationalist Movement. He was also involved in the formation and activities of the National Democratic Coalition (NADECO), including US based United Democratic Front of Nigeria (UDFN), the Nigerian Pro-democracy Network (NPDN) and Radio save Nigeria, a short-wave pro-democracy radio station operated by the Nigerian Advocacy Group for Democracy, and Human Rights (NAGDHR) in Boston, Massachusetts, USA. As a consequence of his involvement in pro-democracy activities in Nigeria, the administration of Ibrahim Babangida put Oladele under security watch and sometimes prevented him from traveling out of Nigeria. The same actions were repeated by the military dictatorship of Sani Abacha as he was arrested by the State Security Service (SSS) and routinely had his international passport seized. == Nigerian House of Representatives == Oladele served as Chairman of the House Committee on Financial Crimes during the Eighth National Assembly. He was a member of other Standing Committees including the Committees on Justice, Healthcare Service, Human Rights, Rules and Business and Agricultural Institutions. He also served on several panels and Ad-Hoc committees including the House Committee on Emergency and Disaster Preparedness which investigated the violation of public trust in the National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) in 2018 and the Presidential Ad-Hoc Committee on the Autonomy of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) to ensure the restoration of the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit's membership of the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units and Nigeria's membership of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to boost the country's capacity to deploy global Financial Intelligence in the fight against corruption in 2017. He introduced and sponsored the Public Holiday Amendment Act which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari on June 11, 2019. The Act allows a public holiday to be declared on June 12 every year in Commemoration of Nigerian's Democracy Day. He introduced and sponsored the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit Act which was signed into law by President Muhammadu Buhari, setting up a central body for processing intelligence related to financial transaction in Nigeria. He also introduced the Proceeds of Crimes Bill, 2017, which made comprehensive provisions for the confiscation, forfeiture and management of properties derived from unlawful activities. The Bill was passed by the National Assembly in May 2019 but President Mohammadu Buhari declined assent to the Bill. On October 13, 2020, President Muhammadu Buhari forwarded an Executive Bill on the Proceeds of Crime which seeks, among others, to address the problem of lack of transparency and accountability associated with the management of recovered funds by anty-curruption agencies in the country to the Ninth National Assembly for necessary legislative work and passage. ==Selected publications == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the House of Representatives (Nigeria) Category:All Progressives Congress politicians Category:Yoruba politicians Category:People from Lagos State ",
