Maclean's father was a Presbyterian minister in Puslinch Township. Maclean moved to Chatsworth, Ontario and graduated as a teacher from Toronto Normal School. After a brief teaching career, Maclean worked at The Toronto World as reporter and then worked his way to becoming a financial editor of the Toronto Mail before entering publishing with his brother Hugh Cameron Maclean by founding Canadian Grocer & Storekeeper's Newspaper in 1887. He then added a number of trade magazines: Hardware and Metal (1888 ), Dry Goods Review, and Printer and Publisher.
