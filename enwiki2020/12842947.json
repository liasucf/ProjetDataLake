The Bama State Collegians have been directed by a number of notable musicians, including Tommy Stewart and Erskine Hawkins. The group also holds an important place in jazz history. In 1934, the entire group travelled to New York and became the Erskine Hawkins Orchestra, recording hit records such as Tuxedo Junction, which rose to No. 7 nationally by Erskine Hawkins and No. 1 by Glenn Miller. Members of this band worked with the NBC Orchestra, the Lucky Millinder Orchestra, the Duke Ellington Orchestra, Louis Armstrong and others. Among those who have played with the orchestra are Dud Bascomb, Paul Bascomb, Avery Parrish, and Haywood Henry. In 2011, the story of Erskine Hawkins and his start in the Bama State Collegians was the subject of a Florida State University Film School MFA Thesis Film \"The Collegians\", written and directed by Alabama State University alumn Bryan Lewis.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfKbCDaPiz4https://www.facebook.com/thomas.wilson.35728466/videos/vb.1684803749/10202862099228578/?type=2&theater; ==References== == Sources == * Biography of Erskine Hawkins form the archives of the Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame * \"The Birmingham Jazz Community: The Role and Contributions of Afro-Americans (up to 1940)\" by Jothan McKinley Callins == External links == * Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame website * Erskine Hawkins at Alabama Jazz Hall of Fame * Fess Whatley at Encyclopedia of Alabama * Bama State Collegians at the Alabama Music Hall of Fame website Category:Alabama State University Category:American jazz ensembles Category:Big bands Category:Musical groups established in the 1930s ",
