(2007) Architecture - Form, Space and Order, Hoboken, John Wiley & Sons Inc Spatiality in architecture is achieved in different ways, by using one of the design principles. In a general sense, the principles are classified into: a) those that use space organisation to determine or redefine boundaries, and b) those that use visual treatment to create a perceptive experience of its extension. In the physical sense, the principles can refer to: :* space volume (open plan, flexibility, enfilade, and circular connectionAlfirevi\u0107 \u0110., Simonovi\u0107 Alfirevi\u0107 S., (2018) \u2019Circular Connection\u2019 Concept in Housing Architecture / Koncept kru\u017ene veze u stambenoj arhitekturi, Arhitektura i urbanizam, No. 46, pp. 26-38.
