The British in colonial India heard Muslims chanting \"Y\u0101 Hussain! Y\u0101 Hassan!\" (a reference to Hussain ibn Ali, brother of Hasan ibn Ali) during the Mourning of Muharram, and approximated it as \"Hobson-Jobson\", which became a term referring to the similar derivation of an English equivalent for a foreign-language words by adapting English words or names that have a superficial resemblance in sound.Yule & Burnell, 419 ==See also== * Descendants of Ali ibn Abi Talib * Day of Ashura * Day of Tasu'a * Sermon of Ali ibn Husayn in Damascus * Ya Aba Abdillah al-Hussain * Ya la-Tharat al- Hussein * Ziyarat Ashura ==References== Category:Arabic words and phrases Category:Islamic terminology Category:Shia Islam ",
