    "text": "Triple Parallel Takeoff/Landing Capabilities are a necessity for many large airports as it allows many aircraft to arrive and depart in a short amount of time. To conduct parallel approaches in the United States, the Federal Aviation Administration dictates that airports must have at least between runways. The FAA can grant special permission to conduct parallel approaches with less separation if deemed necessary. Outside of the United States, each country sets its own standards for aircraft separation. ==Airports with triple parallel landing capabilities== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font- size: 100%\" width=\"align=\" !
