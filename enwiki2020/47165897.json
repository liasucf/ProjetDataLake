    "text": "The male Belgian national (association) football team has been under the supervision of 23 different permanent managers and two caretakers since 1910. Before 1910 and in 1919, a committee of the RBFA presided by \u00c9douard de Laveleye selected the players. Initially supervised by foreigners, it would take until 1930 for team Belgium to be officially led by a Belgian (Hector Goetinck). As of 19 November 2019, coach Roberto Mart\u00ednez is the most successful (permanent) manager that Belgium has ever had in statistical terms, with an average of 2.51 points per match. The coach that brought Belgium most successes at international tournament end stages was Guy Thys, who led his team to the 1980 European Championship final and six years later to the semi- finals of the World Cup in Mexico. In 1986, magazine World Soccer proclaimed Thys Manager of the Year. ==Managers== ==Footnotes== ==References== * ",
