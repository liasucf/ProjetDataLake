    "text": "Horace Cameron Wright (c. 1901 1979), known as \"Cam\", was a Welsh scientist who worked for the Royal Naval Physiological Laboratory at Alverstoke, near Gosport in Hampshire and for the British Ministry of Aircraft Production during World War II. He conducted experiments on new bombs designed to blow up dams, underwater explosions, and underwater escapes from submerged aircraft and submarines, among other things. Most of the more dangerous experiments he performed on himself. He once spent weeks in hospital after being blown out of the water by a massive self-inflicted explosion, and surfaced from an artificial depth of 90 metres on a single breath of air. All of his research reports remain classified, however. ==References== *Trevor Norton, Stars beneath the Sea, Carroll & Graf 1999 Category:Welsh physicists Category:Weapons scientists and engineers Category:1900s births Category:1979 deaths ",
