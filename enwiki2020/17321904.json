    "text": "C-8813 (thiobromadol) is a potent \u03bc-opioid receptor agonist with a distinctive chemical structure which is not closely related to other established families of opioid drugs. The trans-isomer was found to be around 591 times more potent than morphine in animal studies. The same study assigned a potency of 504 times that of morphine to the related compound BDPC. C-8813 is claimed to be similarly potent at the \u03b4-opioid receptor, which antagonizes the mu depression of breathing, presumably making the drug safer. C-8813 has never been used in humans. == See also == * BDPC * Ciramadol * Faxeladol * Profadol * Tapentadol * Tramadol == References == Category:Synthetic opioids Category:Thiophenes Category:Tertiary alcohols Category:Organobromides Category:Mu-opioid agonists Category:Delta-opioid agonists ",
