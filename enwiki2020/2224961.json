    "text": "The Aegean Army or Fourth Army is one of the four main formations of the Turkish Army. It covers the entire west coast of the Anatolia peninsula and has its headquarters in \u0130zmir. It was organised in the 1970s in response to political tensions with Greece - the ongoing Aegean dispute. Its stated mission is to protect Turkey's territory on its western coast. This is directed against the perceived threat posed by Greece's armament of the Aegean Sea islands. Greece, on the other hand, perceives the presence of the Aegean Army as a threat to its islands, citing strong offensive capabilities ascribed to the Aegean Army as well as the exposed and isolated geographical position of the islands, the 5 most populous of which are several hundred kilometres distant from the Greek mainland, yet sit only 2-3km from Turkey's, as reasons of concern. Greek sources particularly point to the strong amphibian forces maintained by the Aegean Army as an indicator of its offensive nature.Macedonian Press Agency Turkey has countered such concerns by stating that besides being of a fundamentally defensive nature it is \"basically a training army\".Turkish embassy declaration The Army has been reported to consist of the following units and organizations: *Cyprus Turkish Peace Force **Headquarters ***28th Mechanized Infantry Division (Pa\u015fak\u00f6y Kyrenia) *** 39th Mechanized Infantry Division (\u00c7aml\u0131bel, Morphou) *** 14th Armoured Brigade (Degirmenlik, Nicosia) *** 49th Special Force Regiment *** 41st Commando Regiment *** 109th Field Artillery Regiment *** 190th Marines Battalion *** Communications Battalion *** Central Command Military Police Battalion *** Logistics Support Group (Kyrenia) *57th Artillery Training Brigade (Izmir) *19th Infantry Brigade (Edremit) *11th Motorised Infantry Brigade (Denizli) *3rd Infantry Training Brigade (Antalya) *1st Infantry Training Brigade (Manisa).Forum discussion of current structure, drawn from S&H; Magazine ==See also== *List of Commanders of the Aegean Army ==References== ==External links== * Turkey and Greece: Time to Settle the Aegean Dispute * https://wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/1975IZMIR00162_b.html - 1975 United States State Department report of creation of army Category:Field armies of Turkey Category:Military in \u0130zmir Province Category:Military units and formations established in 1975 ",
