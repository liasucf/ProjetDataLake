Often a film or other media display is used. If the site has permit requirements or guided tours, the visitor center is often the place where these are coordinated. * A tourist information center, providing visitors to a location with information on the area's attractions, lodgings, maps, and other items relevant to tourism. Often, these centers are operated at the airport or other port of entry, by the local government or chamber of commerce. Often a visitor center is called simply an information center. * A corporate visitor center, provides visitors with an easily accessible window into the corporation. Visitor centers used to provide fairly basic information about the place, corporation or event they are celebrating, acting more as the entry way to a place. The role of the visitor center has been rapidly evolving over the past 10 years to become more of an experience and to tell the story of the place or brand it represents. Many have become destinations and experiences in their own right. ==Europe== Cultural and Tourist Information Center in Ducal Castle, Szczecin, Poland Texas Travel Information Center located near thumb thumb Visitor centre of the thumb ===United Kingdom=== In the United Kingdom, there is a nationwide network of Tourist Information Centres run by the British Tourist Authority (BTA), represented online by the VisitBritain website and public relations organisation.
