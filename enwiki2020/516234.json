    "text": "WWIII is KMFDM's thirteenth studio album. It follows the common KMFDM practice of naming albums with five-letter words. This is KMFDM's only release on Sanctuary Records. Lyrically, the album is very political. The songs primarily attack George W. Bush's presidency, various US wars in the Middle East, and America's foreign policy. The last track, \"Intro\", introduces the members of the band. It was recorded in Seattle, Washington. The album's first and eponymous single was featured in the game Saints Row: The Third. ==Reception== WWIII received mixed reviews. The News-Times called it a \"butt-rock masterpiece\". David Jeffries of Allmusic said, \"The most frustrating thing about WWIII is that it's so darn inconsistent.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Sascha Konietzko \u2013 programming, loops, synths, vocals (1\u20135, 7\u20139, 11), bass (1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10) *Jules Hodgson \u2013 guitar, programming (1, 3, 5, 8\u201311), bass (3, 5, 8), synths (1, 5), banjo (1), strings (3), piano (6, 8), drums (11) *Andy Selway \u2013 drums, vocals (11) *Lucia Cifarelli \u2013 vocals (1\u20135, 7\u201311) *Raymond Watts \u2013 vocals (2, 3, 6\u20138, 10, 11) *Bill Rieflin \u2013 drums (11), vocals (11), loops (4, 10) *Cheryl Wilson \u2013 vocals (6, 10) *Curt Golden \u2013 harmonica (8) *Mona Mur \u2013 \"dominance\" (5)Album liner notes. ==References== ==External links== * KMFDM D\u00d8TK\u00d8M WWIII lyrics at the official KMFDM website Category:2003 albums Category:KMFDM albums Category:Metropolis Records albums Category:Albums produced by Sascha Konietzko ",
