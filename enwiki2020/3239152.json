She served as Minister for International Development Cooperation from 2006 to 2013, member of the Swedish Riksdag from 2002 to 2013 and deputy chairman of her party from 2003 to 2015. == Early life == Carlsson was born and raised in Lund in Sk\u00e5ne. She was at one time chairperson of the Moderate Youth League district in that county. At the Battle of Lycksele, when current party leader Fredrik Reinfeldt was elected chairman of the Youth League, Carlsson was elected vice chairman. == Political career == ===Member of the European Parliament, 1995-2002=== After working as an auditor, Carlsson joined the Moderate Party office in 1994. In 1995, she was elected to the European Parliament and served until 2002. In parliament, she served on the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy (1995-1999) and on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy (1999-2002). In addition to her committee assignments, she was vice-chair of the parliament\u2019s delegation to the European Economic Area Joint Parliamentary Committee (EEA) from 1995 until 1997. ===Career in national politics=== In the 2002 national elections, Carlsson was elected to the Riksdag for Stockholm. In 1999, she was elected vice chairman of the Moderate Party. With the growing co-operation between the Swedish opposition parties, Carlsson was appointed to head the group co-ordinating foreign policy. This led to speculation about her being a possible candidate to the office of Minister for Foreign Affairs after Alliance for Sweden's victory in the 2006 election. With a number of the Moderate Party Riksdag members from \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland resigning, she decided to stand in her home county in 2006. While she won the internal primaries, she was only placed second on the list after Gunnar Ax\u00e9n, but comfortably reached re-election as the party went from three to four seats from the county.Allm\u00e4nna val 17 september 2006 - \u00d6sterg\u00f6tland, Swedish election authority She continues to make her home in Tyres\u00f6 outside Stockholm.

In her capacity as minister, Carlsson also chaired the Stockholm-based Commission on Climate Change and Development (CCCD), a body made up of 13 international experts and established by the Swedish government in 2007 with the aim of looking at how countries can adapt to climate change. In its final report, the commission recommended in 2009 that poor countries already suffering from the impact of climate change urgently need up to $2 billion to help adjust and cope.Megan Davies (May 14, 2009), Poorest need funds to combat climate change: report Reuters. In September 2009 Carlsson led, together with Karel De Gucht, European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Civil Protection, a delegation to Zimbabwe for discussions with President Robert Mugabe. This was to discuss the lifting of targeted EU sanctions against him and more than 200 of his political allies and related businesses. He and his Zanu-PF party have for years loudly argued that these measures are directly responsible for Zimbabwe's economic collapse. The EU team did not buy that argument, and would not even put the sanctions issue on the negotiating table at that time, according to a BBC report.\"Tentative thaw in EU-Zimbabwe ties\" Andrew Harding, BBC News, Harare\"Mugabe hails landmark EU meeting\", BBC News (Africa).
