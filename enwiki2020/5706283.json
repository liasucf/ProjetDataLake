    "text": "Legacy of Rage () is a 1986 Hong Kong action film directed by Ronny Yu, starring Brandon Lee, Michael Wong, Regina Kent and also features a cameo appearance by Bolo Yeung, who appeared in Brandon's father Bruce Lee's last film Enter the Dragon. This was Brandon Lee's first leading role in a film (he made his acting debut with a supporting role in the television film Kung Fu: The Movie earlier that year) and the only Hong Kong production he starred in. ==Plot== Brandon Ma (Brandon Lee) is a regular guy with a job and a girlfriend May (Regina Kent). He has two jobs, so he can support his girlfriend and his dream of owning a motorcycle. Brandon's best friend is Michael Wan (Michael Wong), an ambitious and murderous drug dealer. Michael also loves May and so he comes up with a plan using a corrupt police officer named Sharky (Lam Chung) that will win her for himself and get Brandon out of his way. It seems that the corrupt cop has been using his police connections to dominate the local cocaine trade, so Michael has him killed and uses Brandon as the fall guy. Brandon goes to jail and meets Hoi (Mang Hoi), although he thinks that he will be released soon thanks to the efforts of his good buddy Michael. However, after 8 long years, Brandon finally gets out of jail and vows revenge on Michael for betraying their friendship and stealing the love of his life. Whilst out of prison he learns that May has had his son. With the help of Hoi, Brandon tracks down Michael. Whilst engaging his guards he learns that May is dead. After killing Michael's guards, Brandon confronts and kills his former friend Michael. The movie ends with Brandon bidding farewell to his friend Hoi (who aided him in fighting Michael's guards) and leaving with his son. ==Cast== *Brandon Lee as Brandon Ma *Michael Wong as Michael Wan *Regina Kent as May *Mang Hoi as Hoi *Michael Chan as Yee *Onno Boelee as Prisoner *Tanya Lemani George as Rachel the Belly Dancer in Persian Restaurant *Ku Feng as Prison Guard *Bolo Yeung as Thug *Teddy Yip Wing-cho as Mr. Yip *Ken Lo as Michael's thug *Blackie Ko as Michael's thug *Ha Kwok-wing as U thug *Ng Man- tat as Captain of the Guards *Shing Fui-On -as Foo *Stuart Smith as Big Papa *Kirk Wong as Inspector Lau ==Release== The film was released in theatrically in Hong Kong on 20 December 1986.
