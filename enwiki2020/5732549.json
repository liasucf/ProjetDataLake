To view the gingerbread man, you must rotate the image 135 degrees clockwise. In dynamical systems theory, the Gingerbreadman map is a chaotic two-dimensional map. It is given by the piecewise linear transformation:. See in particular Fig. 3.3. : \\begin{cases} x_{n+1} = 1 - y_n + |x_n|\\\\\\ y_{n+1} = x_n \\end{cases} ==See also== * List of chaotic maps ==References== ==External links== * Category:Chaotic maps Category:Exactly solvable models ",
