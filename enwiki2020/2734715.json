    "text": "Syed Muhammad Zauqi Shah (1878\u20131951) was a Sufist scholar considered a Waliullah or Sufist saint. He graduated from Aligarh University in India. A member of the Chishti Order of Sufi, his work combined merits of Islamic scholarship and modern knowledge. He was a close associate of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and the freedom fighters of India, Muhammad Ali Johar and Shaukat Ali, Abdul Qadir, Muhammad Iqbal, Justice Shah Din, Akbar Allahabadi, Abdul Kalam Azad. He was the author of several books and articles in English, his masterpiece being Sirr-e-Dilbaran, an alphabetical encyclopedia of Sufi terminology Sufism, now available in English. He died in 1951 on the 9th day of Zilhajj Hajj (the pilgrimage) in Makkah, and was buried in Arafat, the prayer ground of Hajj. He was a great spiritual leader who backed the movement for Pakistan, and strongly supported the Quaid-e-Azam, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. He predicted the creation of Pakistan as early as 1938 through divine visions, and some of his predictions about the future are given in his books and discourses. He was a great lover of The Prophet and stated that the main purpose of Hajj is to visit the Blessed Messenger of God. In fact, before his final departure for Hajj from Karachi, he had told some of his disciples that if the Prophet gave him permission to stay, he will not come back. He was succeeded by four khulafa (caliphs/successors): Maulana Umar Bhai (Bombay); Shah Shahidullah Faridi (Karachi, Pakistan, originally from the UK); Captain Wahid Baksh Rabbani (Bahawalpur, Pakistan), and Maulana Abdus Salam (India). His discourses were compiled by his khalifas Shah Shahidullah Faridi and Wahid Baksh Sial Rabbani under the title \"Tarbiyyat-ul-Ushaq\" (Training of the Lovers) and published in English and Urdu. ==Spiritual lineage== # Hazrat Muhammad # Imam Ali al Murtaza # \u1e24asan al Ba\u1e63r\u012b # Abdul W\u0101\u1e25id bin Zaid # Fu\u1e0dayl ibn 'Iy\u0101\u1e0d # Ibr\u0101h\u012bm bin Adham # \u1e24udhayfah al Mar'ash\u012b # Ab\u016b \u1e24ubayrah al Ba\u1e63r\u012b # Mumsh\u0101d D\u012bnwar\u012b # Abu Ishaq Sham\u012b # Abu Ahmad Abdal # Abu Muhammad Muhtaram # Abu Yusuf bin Sa`man # Qutbuddin Mawdud Chisht\u012b # Haji Sharif Zindani # Usman Harooni # Mu'\u012bnudd\u012bn Chisht\u012b # Qutbuddin Bakhtyar Kaki # Far\u012bdudd\u012bn Mas'\u016bd # Alauddin Sabir Kaliyari # Shamsuddin Turk Panipati # Jalaluddin Kabir ul Awliya # Abdul Haqq Raudolvi # Ahmad Arif Raudolvi # Muhammad Arif Raudovi # Abdul Quddus Gangohi # Jalaluddin Thanesari # Nizamuddin Balkhi # Abu Said Gangohi # Muhibullah Ilahabadi # Mohammadi Fayyaz # Muhammadi Makki # Shah Izzuddin # Abdul Hadi Amrohi # Abdul Bari Amrohi # Haji Abdur Rahim Wilayati # Noor Muhammad Jhinjhawani # Imdadullah Muhajir Makki # Rasheed Ahmad Gangohi # Syed Waris Hasan # Syed Shah Muhammad Zauqi ==References== *\"The Author's Spiritual Guide\" in Islamic Sufism by Captain Wahid Baksh Rabbani, 1995, Justice Akbar Academy, Pakistan. *\"Shajra Tayyiba\" by Alhajj Shah Shahidullah Faridi, including the Wird of the Chishti Sabri order.
