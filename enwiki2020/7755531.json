    "text": "South of Heaven, West of Hell is country singer Dwight Yoakam's 12th studio album, and the first soundtrack album to the motion picture of the same name in which he starred, co-wrote and directed. Yoakam portrays a lawman in the early 1900s in the \"wild west\" of the Arizona Territory. Half of the tracks in the album are country music tracks. The other tracks are short snippets of straight dialog scenes from the film itself. There are many well-known co- stars in the movie, including Peter Fonda, Bridget Fonda, Paul Reubens, Billy Bob Thornton, Warren Zevon and Vince Vaughn. This was also Yoakam's only album for Warner Bros. after leaving Reprise. ==Background== Yoakam, a former drama student who received good reviews for playing an assortment of weirdos and psychopaths in the Nineties, decided to write, produce, score, and star in his own film. On just about every front, the project was an unmitigated disaster. Shortly before production began, the financier backed out and Yoakam made the decision to finance the film on his own, partially through the sale of his home in Malibu. His production company (A Cast of Strays) ultimately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and several crew members registered complaints with unions and filed lawsuits in small claims court against the company. Yoakam said it was \"the hardest experience I've ever gone through in my professional life in terms of executing art\". The film holds a 4.1 out of 10 rating at the Internet Movie Database. To help pay off the debt accrued while making the movie, Yoakam hired a cheaper backing band in 2002, which resulted in a falling out with his longtime producer, bandleader, and guitarist Pete Anderson. Anderson later recalled, \u201cHe\u2019d started a film company with Billy Bob Thorton, and I thought it was a great opportunity for them. But I said, \u2018Just don\u2019t be in it.\u2019 That\u2019ll come later. Have a little film company and develop something and get your name away from the splatter if it blows up. If you write, direct, produce, act, tap dance, costume \u2013 man, every finger\u2019s going to point at you if it\u2019s not successful.\u201d ==Recording & Composition== Unsurprisingly, the soundtrack was far superior to the film. Likely inspired by Quentin Tarantino\u2019s habit of inserting snippets from his films between cuts, Yoakam chose to do the same here, but only serves to lose the listener with its ill-placed breaks and uninteresting dialogue. The actual songs, however, are some of Yoakam\u2019s \u201cmost inspired efforts.\u201d The soundtrack is anchored by four gospel songs, including a contemporary take on the hymn \u201cWho at the Door Is Standing\u201d (a duet with Bekka Bramlett), the traditional \u201cThe Darkest Hour,\u201d the Yoakam-original \u201cThe Last Surrender,\u201d and \u201cIt Is Well with my Soul,\u201d which Yoakam sings with only piano accompaniment. In his book A Thousand Miles from Nowhere, biographer Don McCleese writes, \"Rarely had Dwight illuminated the religious underpinnings of his music as brightly as he did on 'Who at My Door Is Standing' and 'The Darkest Hour.'\" He also enlisted two famous rock legends as songwriting collaborators: ZZ Top\u2019s Billy Gibbons on the bluesy \u201cThe First thing Smokin\u2019\u201d and Rolling Stone Mick Jagger for the stone-country lament \u201cWhat\u2019s Left of Me.\u201d Anderson supplies atypical arrangements on \"Tears for Two\u201d and the longing \u201cSomewhere,\u201d the latter of which sounding like the material found on Yoakam\u2019s 1995 album Gone, with David McGee in The New Rolling Stone Guide deeming it \"an instant Yoakam classic.\" ==Reception== AllMusic: \u201cWhile the album certainly has its strong points, it is no substitute for a complete Dwight Yoakam record.\u201d ==Track listing== #\"Words\" (Dwight Yoakam) - 5:21 #\"[Old Friend]\" performed by Joe Unger - :51 #\"Who at the Door Is Standing\" [with Bekka Bramlett] (M.B.C.
