The school has had six different headteachers. During the First World War pupils at Morley Grammar school raised \u00a35,000 to pay for school uniforms for struggling families within the school. On 1 January 2011, Morley High School became The Morley Academy under the government's new academy programme. Sir John Townsley was appointed head teacher after the retirement of Roland Walker. Towards the end of 2012, Sir John Townsley ceased his leadership of the academy and Anne-Marie Garnett was appointed principal. In November 2014, Leanne Griffiths was appointed as Principal. In April 2018, it was rumoured that Griffiths had been promoted and was therefore leaving the academy, and that Bruntcliffe Academy principal Adam Ryder was to replace Griffiths in September. At the end of June, Griffiths announced formally in an assembly to all students that had been promoted to look over all Secondary schools (11-16) in The Gorse Academies Trust, and that Adam Ryder was to replace her in September 2018.
