It premiered on 25 July 2016, and is telecast daily. The show is produced by Boyhood Productions of Surinder Singh, Gurjit Singh and Sushanta Das. The show has been well-received. Ke Apon Ke Por is a family drama series starring Pallavi Sharma and Biswajit Ghosh in lead roles. Bulbuli Panja plays the main antagonist (Tandra), while Ananya Biswas, Arindya Banerjee, Reshmi Sen, Kalyani Mondal, Indranil Chattejee and Simran Upadhyay appear in prominent supporting roles. The show is one of the longest-running and popular serials on Bengali television. ==Premise== The show upholds the plight of Joba who, under circumstances, gets married into the Sengupta family where she used to serve as the maid; and her struggle to become the suitable bride to Param and the worthy daughter-in-law of the Sengupta family. Param stands by Joba, empowering her to complete her studies as well as earn a law degree from a noted university, fulfilling her dream of becoming self- dependent by pursuing her career as a private-practicing lawyer. Joba, however, has to constantly face and overcome various path blocks and hindrances, mainly from Tandra, the Sengupta family's eldest daughter-in-law, who looks down upon Joba as a mere servant, believing her to have no right to rise in social status, and seeks to destroy her as well as the Sengupta family's happiness. Tandra's sister-in-laws, Palak and Mayuri, initially support Tandra against Joba and humiliate her, accusing her of being a gold- digger. Palak's brother Sanjay lusts for Joba, but Param raises his voice preventing him from molesting Joba. Meanwhile, Tandra uses Param's childhood friend Deblina as a pawn to separate Param from Joba, but this backfires as the growing distance between the two gives rise to Param's longing for Joba and they mutually realize their feelings for each other. Finally, Param conveys his love to Joba, and both accept each other as their respective spouse, thus, going against all odds, to completely eliminate the thin line of social difference separating the two till then. Joba also gets Param's younger sister, Tia married to her love interest, Topu and gets Sanjay permanently banished from their family. Joba further gets Param's uncle married to Gouri, a poor and uncultured woman, who is soon revealed to be greedy and as wicked as Tandra, and the two join hands, and together with Palak and Tandra's mother, plot against Joba. Later on, Joba reveals the true intentions of Tandra in front of the family members, leading them to go against her and throw Tandra out of the house. At this, Tandra becomes desperate and vows to neither let Joba nor the Senguptas live in peace and harmony; putting on various acts of repentance, only to get accepted into the family again, her sole intention being to back-stab them. She keeps on plotting various evil tactics against Joba and the Senguptas with her mother and Sanjay. They also involve Joba's cousin, Sanatan (who is a terrorist), in their plan to portray Param as an anti-national in front of the society and in one such bombing, Param supposedly dies, turning Joba mentally unstable. He returns in the disguise of Mr. Srivastav (who comes across the family as Joba's doctor/therapist, taking the help of his brother-in-law, Swapnomoy) to prove his innocence, Sanatan's guilt in the bombings done and to get Joba treated of her ailment. After succeeding in treating Joba's mental state back to normal, Param and Joba, overcome with desire and passion for each other, finally consummate their marriage! The Senguptas go on a trip to Darjeeling, where Tandra, along with Sanjay, plans an accident of Joba, but accidentally their plan results in Tanna losing his speech, and now Tandra, instead, frames Joba for the same. Meanwhile, Mayuri is having an affair with Ani, but Joba helps her understand her mistake and reconnect with Swapnomoy. Palak gets Joba arrested for Tanna's accident and Joba, out of emotional strain, accepts the same and gets jailed. Tanna can't expose Tandra due to his inability to speak while Tandra, now, in Joba's absence, in order to prove herself to be more worthy than Joba as the Sengupta family's daughter-in-law, even goes on to plan her fake pregnancy, just to compete with Joba, who is also going to give birth to Param's child. Tandra adopts the new-born daughter of a slum-dweller (Minoti) and introduces her as her biological daughter in front of the Senguptas, gets Joba's new-born son separated from her and bribes the doctors to officially declare him dead, subduing Joba and disheartening the Senguptas. Moreover, she supplies Param with memory-losing drugs, putting his identity at a stake, while Joba is taken back to jail. Now, Tandra, along with Gouri (Param's wicked aunt), utilizes Joba's absence to re-establish their dominance in the Sengupta household. ===5 Years later=== Joba gets released from jail and returns to the Sengupta household, which is now fully under Tandra and Gouri's control. Also, a self-proclaimed god-woman Sreelekha has been appointed by Tandra to get Param's memory back. But actually, it is her vicious plan to get rid of Param, by having Sreelekha manipulating him to believe himself and Sreelekha to be die-hard lovers from their previous births, separated by a lady \"Apala\", who, as per their story, has reincarnated into Joba, to separate them again. But Joba exposes Sreelekha as a fraud and gradually manages to get Param's memory back. Also, Tanna gets back his speech, and he makes it clear that Sanjay, not Joba, was responsible for his accident. Palak apologises to Joba for all her taunts and mistrust for Joba. They then together search for their long-lost son. Supari, Joba and Param's estranged son has grown up in the slums pick-pocketing. Joba brings him to the Sengupta house, teaches him morals and the difference between right and wrong, and with Param's monitoring, gets him admitted in a school. They then adopt Supari as their son. Later Joba gets to meet Minoti, Tandra's 5-year-old daughter Anu's biological mother, who reveals to Joba that her son is alive. Tandra introduces an impostor child (Baban) as Joba-Param's son. Minoti is killed by Sanjay as per Tandra's plan, however, Joba soon uncovers the mystery behind Baban (actually named Pintu) being an impostor and he is sent back to the slums. They, however, don't get to know who their real child is. Meanwhile, Tandra gets Supari trapped in a crime syndicate disguised as a devotional group of saints, fooling the people to make money out of their sentiments. Joba and Param rescue Supari from the gang and their head, \"Swami Arpananda\", and get them arrested. Joba uncovers Tandra's secret regarding Anu being actually Minoti's child and as all of Tandra's crimes are exposed, she is finally arrested, while Sanjay escapes. Tandra is rescued by her boyfriend Dipanjan, who blackmails Joba-Param to open a \"cheat-fund\" and hand over to him the money deposited by the people in the same, as well get Tandra bailed, in return for getting to know the real identity of their son. However, soon enough, Joba exposes them to the public as Dipanjan leaves Tandra (flying away from the country) and Tandra, in turn, puts on an act of being paralysed to escape jail punishment, and is accepted back into the Sengupta family, where she while continuing on her act, remains confined in her room, secretly maintaining contacts with Sanjay and her mother. Also, Joba and Param get to know that Supari is indeed their child. Joba also gives birth to a daughter, Koyel. Supari gets paralysed due to interior damage and needs to be treated abroad. 4 years later, after having collected the entire money for the treatment, Joba and Param along with Supari (now renamed Sarthak) fly off to America, with a hesitant Joba leaving Koyel in care of the other Sengupta family member, only for Tandra to use the opportunity to imbibe deep hatred in little Koyel's mind against her parents, especially Joba for prioritizing their son Sarthak than their daughter Koyel. ===12 Years later=== After 12 years, Koyel, now an 18-year-old, in Joba's absence, has grown up to be a spoilt brat, being addicted to alcohol and cigarettes. She parties with her friends (including Ronnie) who are associated with unholy activities, and are actually fitted by Sanjay, as per Tandra's plan, to further deteriorate Koyel. However, after Joba, Param and Sarthak return from the U.S., getting Sarthak fully treated, Joba takes upon herself her new quest to enlighten Koyel about the harmful lifestyle she is leading and make her passion for rock music and dance as the path for ensuring her progress and mark her return to the mainstream of life and education. Thus she wins her heart back, much to Tandra's chagrin. The Senguptas are now assisted by a girl Itu in the housework, who is very close to Koyel and Joba (who treats Itu as her own daughter). After Tinni's marriage to a high class society entrepreneur Soheli Chowdhury's son Adi, they all go on a trip to Itu's original village, \"Phultuli\" where Tandra, with Sanjay's help plans to get Joba's family murdered, but fails again. Anup Samanta, a local goon, wants to marry Itu and joins hands with Sanjay to make the same happen. However, Joba, with Itu and Sarthak, escapes only to land among tribals who force Itu and Sarthak to get married in Joba's presence. Sarthak doesn't accept Itu as his wife, due to their marriage being accidental and he himself having feelings for Soheli's daughter Rinki, who actually doesn't truly love Sarthak and is just infatuated with her, and like her mother, wants to get Sarthak only to satisfy her ego and put Joba down. Param and Joba put on an act to have considered separation due to Joba supporting Sarthak's marriage with Itu. Joba leaves the house with Itu. Anup kidnaps Itu and tries to kill Joba who, however, survives; and with Param and Sarthak and police's aid, saves Itu and gets Anup arrested, while Sanjay escapes. They all then return home and Tandra tries to create rift between Joba and Param with fake divorce papers, however Joba and Pram's plan succeeds in unraveling Tandra's crimes and she is arrested, however, she vows vengeance and seeks to destroy Joba. Tia returns home after years, following a dispute with Topu. Joba tries to resolve the same and also tells Itu to study hard to become eligible of Sarthak. Later Rinki and Soheli try to create problems among Sarthak and Itu, but he firmly stands by Itu and reprimands the former two. Rinki, however, threatens suicide if Sarthak doesn't acknowledge her and not Itu to be his soulmate. ==Cast== ===Main cast=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Year !Cast !Character !Description |- style=\"height: 10em;\" |2016 \u2013 present | Pallavi Sharma | Joba Sengupta (Maiden Name : Joba Rani Bosu) | style=\"width: 20em;\" | Initially Sengupta family's maid turned its youngest daughter-in-law, Param's wife, a private-practicing lawyer by profession.
