The English version was released on 5 May 2003, by Interscope Records as the second single from the album. Musically, the song is a Eurodance-inspired song, and lyrically it talks about the group running away from people as they don't understand their love towards one another. \"Not Gonna Get Us\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics, praising the production and highlighted the song as an album standout, however some critics were not impressed by the lyrical content. It was, however, a commercial success worldwide, peaking inside the top-ten in countries including Finland, Italy, Austria, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The single also peaked at number one on the US Billboard Dance Club Songs chart, becoming the duo's only number-one single on the US component charts. An accompanying music video was filmed for the single, where it starts with the girls getting a mugshot, until escaping to a truck, where they drive off through snow in Siberia. The video was directed by Ivan Shapovalov, who also features in a cameo appearance in the video as a construction worker. The song also received a minor controversial image, where it featured a more rebel image. The song has also been performed on all of the duo's concert tours, and was also performed at the 2003 MTV Movie Awards. In 2009, t.A.T.u. played a special concert featuring the song at the Eurovision Song Contest with a Russian Army Choir, the Alexandrov Ensemble.

Additionally, the song was sung later in the ceremony when Russia's competitors entered the stadium. ==Background and composition== Prior to becoming t.A.T.u. Yulia and Lena had auditioned as members of Neposedi, a group produced by Ivan Shapolavov and his business partner Alexander Voitinskyi. Shapolavov has said the two girls stood out from the rest of those who auditioned; however, 14-year-old Katina was initially the only one chosen for the band. While the album was in development, their producer Alexander Voitinskyi left the production, leaving the album unreleased. However, Shapolavov later signed Elena Kiper as the new co- producer and co-writer for the album, who had eventually written \"Not Gonna Get Us\". There is also the Russian counterpart entitled \"Nas Ne Dogonyat\". The song was written by Elena Kiper, Ivan Shapovalov, Valeriy Polienko and Sergio Galoyan, while production was handled by Trevor Horn. The song was included in the groups compilation album The Best (2006). The song was added to their YouTube channel five years later on 6 February 2008. \"Not Gonna Get Us\" is a eurodance-inspired song.200 km/h in the Wrong Lane [Argentina Bonus Track [Enhanced] www.allmusic.com. The song incorporates influences from pop, dance- pop, eurodance and rock music.

It can also be legally downloaded individually off their greatest hits album, The Best. There was a promotional CD single which was released in Poland by Universal Music Polska, the Polish label for Universal Music. However, it was used as an A-Side for \"Ya Soshla S Uma\" at the time. ==Critical reception== \"Not Gonna Get Us\" received mixed to positive reviews from music critics. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic highlighted the track on the album saying it was an \"exhausting offering hit\" but continued saying; \"Well, it's easy not to be into it when Julia and Lena appear to have been run through a marketing processor so they could become two Sapphic tarts who sing songs with suggestive titles like \"Not Gonna Get Us\", \"Show Me Love\" and \"All the Things She Said\" (it's likely a coincidence that the latter two share titles with songs by Robyn and Simple Minds, respectively, but perhaps not) [...].\" Popdirt commented that the \"high-pitched helium voices\" on the song work at \"complementing the sensitivity they feel for each other and the reckless abandonment of the outside world perfectly\". Furthermore, Pitchfork listed this as the 33rd best single of 2003. The song was nominated \"Best Russian Act\" on the 2003 MTV Europe Music Awards. ==Chart performance== \"Not Gonna Get Us\" was released in Europe in 2003.

They then are outside in a snowy environment, where they steal a large truck and ride off through an airfield, breaking through a fence while singing. The two girls later find themselves in snow-covered Siberia. They run over a construction worker in the middle of the road, who is played by Ivan Shapovalov. After breaking through another fence, some family photos of both the girls as young children are shown during the video. Towards the end, Yulia and Lena climb to the roof of the truck and stand on top, hugging and smiling as they continue to sing the song, until they crack the lens of the camera as they leave. The song was directed by their former producer Ivan Shapovalov. The music video is also the same music video taken from the Russian version \"Nas Ne Dogonyat\". The English music video for this song is a re-edited version of the Russian video, altered to remove the lip synching (usually by adding a broken glass shot over the shots of them singing). A video game was created by a fan based on the music video. In the game, the band is inside a truck trying to get away from the bad guys. The game course also features land mines that the player must dodge. It was uploaded by a user on game-sharing web site Newgrounds. ==Media appearances== In the 2009 film, Thick as Thieves the song is played twice. First in a club in Russian, on the first encounter of the characters played by Antonio Banderas and Radha Mitchell and at the end of the film in English when they meet again in the same club. It also appears in Lilya 4-ever and Chechenia Warrior 3.
