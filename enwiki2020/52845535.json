    "text": "Jai Tirath Dahiya (born 20 May 1952) is an Indian politician and a member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly from the Indian National Congress, representing the Rai Vidhan Sabha constituency in Haryana. Dahiya is a two- term member of the Haryana Legislative Assembly. ==Political career== Dahiya represents the Rai Vidhan Sabha constituency in Haryana and contested his first successful election in 2009. In the 2009 Haryana Legislative Assembly election, Dahiya was given an Indian National Congress ticket and was pitted against Inderjeet, a candidate from the Indian National Lok Dal. Dahiya won that election by a margin of 4,666 votes, securing a total 35,514 votes and defeating his nearest rival Inderjeet from the Indian National Lok Dal who secured 30,848 votes. The 2014 Haryana Legislative Assembly election was a referendum of sorts as the Indian National Congress-led government was in power in the state for 10 years and anti-incumbency was a factor. There was a three-sided contest this time around with Dahiya on an Indian National Congress ticket, Inderjeet on an Indian National Lok Dal ticket, and Krishna Gahlawat on a Bharatiya Janata Party ticket. Dahiya won that election by a margin of only 3 votes, securing a total of 36,703 votes. Dahiya's nearest rivals Inderjeet from the Indian National Lok Dal and Krishna Gahlawat on a Bharatiya Janata Party secured 36,700 and 34,523 votes, respectively. The victory by 3 votes was the smallest margin of victory by any candidate in the 2014 Haryana Legislative Assembly election. == Personal life== Born on 20 May 1952 in Sonipat, Haryana, to Rizag Ram, Dahiya completed his education (Bachelor of Arts and Law) in Chandigarh. Dahiya is an advocate by profession. He is married to Aruna Dahiya and the couple have two children. == References == Category:1952 births Category:Living people Category:Members of the Haryana Legislative Assembly Category:People from Sonipat Category:20th-century Indian lawyers Category:21st-century Indian lawyers Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Haryana ",
