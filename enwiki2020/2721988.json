He was the son of the pioneering film producer Jules Greenbaum who had founded Deutsche Bioscope. He began as a cameraman in 1915 working on German silent movies, especially in association with directors Urban Gad, Max Mack, and Franz Hofer. Most of the time he worked for his father's company Greenbaum- Film GmbH in Berlin, even directing some detective films around 1920. His career continued into the sound era and he moved to England working on such films as The Stars Look Down (1940), Hatter's Castle (1942), Thunder Rock (1942), So Evil My Love (1948), Night and the City (1950) and I'm All Right Jack (1959), usually credited as Max Greene. He directed a few British films in the 1940s, but is remembered today for the over 150 films as a director of photography between 1915 and 1967. ==Selected filmography== * Hampels Abenteuer (1915) * The Confessions of the Green Mask (1916) * The Dancer Barberina (1920) * The Voice (1920) * Professor Larousse (1920) * The Man in the Fog (1920) * Blackmailed (1920) * The Double Face (1920) * Dolls of Death (1920) * Masks (1920) * Die Beichte einer Gefallenen (1921) * The Poisoned Stream (1921) * The Raft of the Dead (1921) * The Last Witness (1921) * Hashish, the Paradise of Hell (1921) * Wildnis (1922) * Alone in the Jungle (1922) * The White Desert (1922) * Count Cohn (1923) * Wettlauf ums Gl\u00fcck (1923) * The Vice of Gambling (1923) * Christopher Columbus (1923) * The Girl from Capri (1924) * Prater (1924) * Spring Awakening (1924) * The Blonde Hannele (1924) * The Creature (1924) * D\u00fcstere Schatten, strahlendes Gl\u00fcck (1924) * The Mistress of Monbijou (1924) * Den of Iniquity (1925) * The Marriage Swindler (1925) * The Golden Calf (1925) * Rags and Silk (1925) * The Bohemian Dancer (1926) * The Girl on a Swing (1926) * Our Daily Bread (1926) * The Circus of Life (1926) * The Spinning Ball (1927) * Tragedy of a Marriage (1927) * Potsdam (1927) * Orient (1928) * Vienna, City of My Dreams (1928) * The Republic of Flappers (1928) * Pawns of Passion (1928) * Who Invented Divorce?
