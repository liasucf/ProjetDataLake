    "text": "The EMD G18 was an export locomotive introduced by GM-EMD in the late 1960s. The standard EMD suffixes applied after the G18 designation to indicate if the customer purchased locomotives with specific traction motors to fit narrow gauge (U) or broad gauge (W) rails. An (L) indicates a locomotive built with a lightweight frame, and (6) indicates A1A-A1A trucks. The similar EMD GA18 was a G18 designed as an extremely light locomotive with low axle loading and used freight car trucks driven by a cardan shaft and underframe mounted traction motors like its predecessor, the EMD GA8. A further variation was the G18B. They are powered by an EMD 8-645E prime mover rated at 1100 bhp and 1000 hp for traction and were produced with A1A-A1A or B-B trucks. Several countries have purchased these locomotives. ==A1A-A1A Version Original Owners== ===Chile=== * 1 FCAB 954 ===Indonesia=== *8 Indonesian State Railways BB202 01-BB202 08 (Note: BB202 01 - BB202 03 are GL18U6) ==B-B Version Original Owners== ===Chile=== *2 Andes Copper Mining 71-72 ===Iran=== *2 Rah E Ahan 40451-40452 ===Israel=== *1 Rotem Amfert Negev Ltd company in Mishore Rotem (former company name: Negev Phosphates Ltd) ===Peru=== *1 Cerro de Pasco 24 ===Saudi Arabia=== *16 Saudi Govt.
