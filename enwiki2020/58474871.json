The park has a number of facilities, including tennis courts, bowling greens, crazy golf and a caf\u00e9. It also hosts an Italian garden with a pond and various flower displays. The meadow is a large open space used for picnics and to host events, and also has a pitch and putt course. ==History== The local Council, then known as Torquay County Council purchased the land in 1924 for \u00a340,000, and developed into the park it is today. The first facilities to be completed were the tennis courts, which hosted a Davis Cup match in 1924. ==References== Category:Parks and open spaces in Devon ",
