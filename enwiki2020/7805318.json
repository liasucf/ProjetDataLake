    "text": "Verde Island is situated along the bodies of Verde Island Passage between the islands of Luzon and Mindoro, Philippines. It was in 1988 when a small village was connected to mains electricity through the effort of a European project using technologies such as solar panels for the island's self-sufficiency. Since then, it has been declared by the Philippine Tourism Authority as one of the country's marine reserves. == Geography == Verde Island lies south of Brgy. Ilijan, Batangas City and is separated from Luzon by the North Pass. It takes 1 hour and 30 minutes by a boat or 25 minutes by a ferry boat from Batangas City Port to reach the island. One of the famous destination within the island is Mahabang Buhangin, a kilometer-long stretch of white sand beach. Another one is Cueva Sitio, a cave that leads to the other side of the island. Verde Island has been a destination for tourist and divers in Batangas City since 1999, after the Pastor clan opened an P80 Million resort at Brgy. San Antonio. == See also == * Verde Island Passage * Batangas Bay == Footnotes == ==References== * == External links == * * * Official Website of the Local Government of Batangas City Category:Islands of Batangas Category:Beaches of the Philippines Category:Batangas City ",
