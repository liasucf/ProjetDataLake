    "text": "A White Hart signboard Pub names are used to identify and differentiate pubs. Many pubs are centuries old, from a time when their customers were often illiterate, but could recognise pictorial signs. Pub names have a variety of origins, from objects used as simple identification marks to the coats of arms of kings or local aristocrats and landowners. Other names come from historic events, livery companies, and occupations or craftsmen's guilds. Unlike Ireland, where the names of pubs tend to be based on the name of the owner, or a former owner, in mainland Britain this has been unusual, probably because pubs wanted names that could be related to an image on their pub sign, a key means of identifying them in an age of restricted literacy. In Australia a high proportion of older pubs have names ending in \"hotel\", and generally their names reflect hotel naming conventions. ==Methodology== Although the word \"the\" appears on much pub signage, it is ignored in the following examples; the word \"ye' is likewise ignored as it is only an archaic spelling of \"the\". \"Y\" represents an obsolete character (\u00fe, the letter Thorn, which is nowadays used only in Icelandic) for the th sound. Its later forms resembled a blackletter y, and it was never pronounced with a y sound. Similarly, other archaic spellings such as \"olde worlde\" are not distinguished below. ==Animals== Names like Fox and Hounds, Dog and Duck, Dog and Gun, Hare and Hounds, etc., refer to shooting and hunting. Animal names coupled with colours, such as White Hart and Red Lion, are often heraldic. A white hart featured as a badge of King Richard II, while a red lion was a badge of John of Gaunt and a blue boar of the Earls of Oxford. Dolphin, Wisbech, Isle of Ely (now closed), dolphins were caught and presented to the lord of the manor in earlier times, however it may just be a nautical reference to the port. The Black Bear, Walsoken actually had a black bear (stuffed) at the entrance to the premises years ago. ==Branding== Some pub chains in the UK adopt the same or similar names for many pubs as a means of brand expression. The principal examples of this are \"The Moon Under Water\", commonly used by the JD Wetherspoon chain (and inspired by George Orwell's 1946 essay in the Evening Standard, \"The Moon Under Water\"), and the \"Tap and Spile\" brand name used by the now defunct Century Inns chain. The \"Slug and Lettuce\" is another example of a chain of food-based pubs with a prominent brand; founder Hugh Corbett had owned a small number of pubs, to which he gave humorous or nonsensical names, with the effect of differentiating them from competitors. ==Found objects== The 'Crooked Billet', Worsthorne, Lancashire Before painted inn signs became commonplace, medieval publicans often identified their establishments by hanging or standing a distinctive object outside the pub. This tradition dates back to Roman times, when vine leaves were hung outside tabernae to show where wine was sold. * Boot * Copper Kettle * Crooked Billet (a bent branch from a tree) Sometimes the object was coloured, such as Blue Post or Blue Door. ==Heraldry== The ubiquity of the naming element arms shows how important heraldry has been in the naming of pubs. The simpler symbols of the heraldic badges of royalty or local nobility give rise to many of the most common pub names. Five common colours are gules (red); sable (black); azure (blue); vert(green); and purpure (purple). The metals are or (gold) and argent (silver), although in practice they are usually depicted as yellow and white. ===Items appearing in coats of arms=== * Antlers: although this is often seen as a derivation of Richard II's white hart emblem, it may also be an echo of a pagan figure, Herne the Hunter. * Bear and Ragged Staff: a badge of the earls of Warwick. Refers to bear baiting (see Dog and Bear in the Sports section). * Black Griffin: a pub in Lisvane, Cardiff, named after the coat of arms carried by the lords of the manor. * Old Black Lion is the name of an ancient pub opposite the railway station in Northampton. * Blue Boar, the name of many pubs in Westminster, Norwich, Billericay, Maldon, Witney and elsewhere, from the badge of the Earls of Oxford. * Castle: sometimes originally referred to the Coat of Arms of Castile in Spain, and meant that Spanish wines were available within. * Checkers or Chequers: often derived from the coat of arms of a local landowner (see Chequy), this name and sign originated in ancient Rome when a chequer board indicated that a bar also provided banking services. The checked board was used as an aid to counting and is the origin of the word exchequer. The last pub to use the older, now American spelling of checker was in Baldock, Hertfordshire, but this closed circa 1990; all pubs now use the modern \"q\" spelling (but see also Chequers, in Plants and horticulture below). * Cross Keys, Wisbech, derived from the town's coat of arms and the town's church of SS. Peter & Paul. * Eagle and Child, Oxford, derived from the arms of the Earls of Derby, was a meeting place of the Inklings. * Elephant and Castle: apocryphally a corruption of the words \"Infanta of Castile\", more probably taken from the crest of the Cutlers' Company. * Lamb and Flag: a common religious symbol, with the Agnus Dei holding the red cross flag that represented the Resurrection of Christ earlier than it was the flag of England. This was the device of the Middle Temple, a legal society in London, which was given a charter in 1608 to occupy lands formerly owned by the Knights Templar. It is one of the four Inns of Court, still training barristers today. The Lamb & Flag (Oxford) is one of many pubs with this name. * Olde Man and Scythe, Bolton, taken from the crest of the Pilkington family. * Ostrich feathers have been used as a royal badge since the time of Edward III, particularly the Three Feathers badge of the Prince of Wales. * Red Dragon of Cadwaladr: the symbol of Wales, and a heraldic badge of Henry VII and many other royal figures. * Red Lion is the name of over 600 pubs. It thus can stand for an archetypal British pub. The lion is one of the most common charges in coats of arms, second only to the cross, and thus the Red Lion as a pub sign probably has multiple origins: in the arms or crest of a local landowner, now perhaps forgotten; as a personal badge of John of Gaunt, founder of the House of Lancaster; or in the royal arms of Scotland, conjoined to the arms of England after the Stuart succession in 1603. * Rising Sun: symbol of the east and of optimism. The Sun in Splendour was also a livery badge of Edward IV * Silver Lion, Lilley, Hertfordshire: from the arms of the Sowerby family. * Spread Eagle: from the heraldic depiction of an eagle 'displayed'; probably derived from the arms of Germany, indicating that German wines were available within. * Swan, a badge of many Lancastrian figures\u2014see Dunstable Swan Jewel * Talbot or Talbot Arms refers to an actual breed of hunting dog, now extinct, which is also a heraldic hound, and is the badge of the Talbot family, Earls of Shrewsbury. Old Talbot, Wisbech (now closed) * Unicorn * White Bear * White Hart: the livery badge of King Richard II of England. It became so popular as an inn sign in his reign that it was adopted by many later inns and taverns. * White Horse: the sign of the House of Hanover, adopted by many eighteenth-century inns to demonstrate loyalty to the new Royal dynasty. A white horse is also the emblem of the County of Kent. The name can also refer to the chalk horses carved into hillsides. * White lion: the livery badge of the Duke of Norfolk ===Livery companies=== Three Compasses, Hornsey, London N8 Names starting with the word \"Three\" are often based on the arms of a London Livery company or trade guild : * Three Arrows: The Worshipful Company of Bowyers * Three Bucks: The Worshipful Company of Leathersellers * Three Castles: The Worshipful Company of Masons * Three Compasses: The Worshipful Company of Carpenters * Three Crowns: The Worshipful Company of Drapers, although it can also refer to the Magi, the Diocese of Ely or the three crowns of East Anglia.Oldham * Three Cups: The Worshipful Company of Salters * Three Goats' Heads: The Worshipful Company of Cordwainers * Three Hammers: The Worshipful Company of Blacksmiths * Three Horseshoes: The Worshipful Company of Farriers * Three Tuns: The Brewers and the Worshipful Company of Vintners * Three Wheatsheafs: The Worshipful Company of Bakers ===Landowners=== Many coats of arms appear as pub signs, usually honouring a local landowner. * Duke of Bedford, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for the person draining the fens. * Hardwicke Arms, Wisbech (now closed Down) - the Earl of Hardwicke KG MP being Lord Lieutenant and Custos Rotulorum. * Osborne, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for the residence of a local family. * Percy Arms, Otterburn, Northumberland, commemorates the Battle of Otterburn in 1388, where Sir Henry Percy, son of the Earl of Northumberland, led the English army. There is also a Percy Arms in Tynemouth, North Tyneside, and various other locations in the North East of England. * Prince Albert, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for the prince consort. * Queen Victoria, Wisbech, Isle of Ely : named for the monarch. * Royal Standard, Wisbech, Isle of Ely : named for royal family. * Stanley Arms, Huyton, near Liverpool: after Frederick Stanley, 16th Earl of Derby. * Marshland Arms, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now closed) named for a nearby council. * Melbourne Arms, Duston, Northampton: after former local landowner Lord Melbourne * Wisbech Arms, Wisbech: (now closed) named for the local borough. ===Occupations=== The Mechanics Arms, Hindley Green :See also Trades, tools and products below Some \"Arms\" signs refer to working occupations. These may show people undertaking such work or the arms of the appropriate London livery company. This class of name may be only just a name but there are stories behind some of them. * Artillery Arms Bunhill Row, London EC1: situated next door to the headquarters of the Honourable Artillery Company, the British Army's oldest regiment. * Blacksmith's Arms, with the pun of the actual blacksmiths arms and their strength * Bricklayer's Arms, e.g., Hitchin, Hertfordshire: The first landlord, William Huckle, who opened this pub in 1846, was a bricklayer by trade. * Brewers Arms, Wisbech. The town had and has several breweries. * Builders Arms: Kensington Court Place, London * Carpenters Arms - A series of pubs, related to the occupation or more likely to the guild of carpenters. * Fisherman's Arms, Birgham near Coldstream * Foundryman's Arms Northampton * Lathrenders' Arms, [Wisbech , Isle of Ely.

These include \"The Dolphin\" in Wellington, Somerset which was named in honour of Wellington's victory at the Battle of Waterloo. * Festival Inn: name of a pub in Poplar, London, built at the time of the Festival of Britain in 1951. * Hand and Shears: this famous City of London pub got its name owing to Bartholomew Fair. Tailors would gather in the pub the night before the fair and wave their shears announcing that the fair should begin. * Magna Charta in Lowdham, Nottinghamshire, has its name spelled differently from the historic document after which it is named. * Man on the Moon, Northfield, Birmingham: originally called The Man in the Moon and renamed on the day of the first moon landing in 1969. * Rose and Crown: Edward III used a golden rose as a personal badge, and two of his sons adapted it by changing the colour: John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, used a red rose, and Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, used a white rose. The dynastic conflicts between their descendants are collectively called the Wars of the Roses. In 1485 Henry Tudor, a descendant of Lancaster, defeated Richard III of the York dynasty and married Richard's niece Elizabeth of York. Since then the combined red-and-white Tudor rose, often crowned, has been a symbol of the monarchy of England. A 'Royal Oak' in Fishguard, Wales * Royal Oak: After the Battle of Worcester (1651) in the English Civil War, the defeated Prince Charles escaped the scene with the Roundheads on his tail. He managed to reach Bishops Wood in Staffordshire, where he found an oak tree (now known as the Boscobel Oak near Boscobel House). He climbed the tree and hid in it for a day while his obviously short-sighted pursuers strolled around under the tree looking for him. The hunters gave up, Prince Charles came down and escaped to France (the Escape of Charles II). He became Charles II on the Restoration of the Monarchy. To celebrate this good fortune, 29 May (Charles' birthday) was declared Royal Oak Day and the pub name remembers this. The Royal Naval ship HMS Royal Oak gets its name from the same source. Early ships were built of the heartwood of oak. Bath, England Ye Olde Trip to Jerusalem * Saracen's Head and Turk's Head: Saracens and Turks were among the enemies faced by Crusaders. This is also a reference to the Barbary pirates that raided the coasts from the Crusades until the early 19th century. * Trafalgar: commemorating the Battle of Trafalgar. There are many pubs called the Nelson, and an Emma Hamilton pub in Wimbledon Chase where Nelson lived with her. A famous pub is the Trafalgar Tavern, part of the Greenwich Maritime World Heritage site at Greenwich. * Olde Trip to Jerusalem, Nottingham, one of the claimants to the title of oldest pub in Britain, said to have been a stopping- off place for the Crusaders on the way to the Holy Land. \"Trip\" here has the old meaning of a stop, not the modern journey. The pub was once called the Pilgrim, which is probably the real story behind the name. The pub has the date 1189 painted on its masonry, which is the year King Richard I ascended to the throne. Like many elderly pubs, the Trip carries \"Ye\" before its name, with an E on the end of \"old\" another \"olde worlde\" affectation. ==Literature== The Moon Under Water, Watford, named after George Orwell's description ===Names from books=== * Cat and Custard Pot in Shipton Moyne is said to originate from the book Handley Cross or Mr Jorrocks's Hunt by R. S. Surtees. * Jabez Clegg in Manchester, now closed, was named after the title character in Isabella Banks' novel The Manchester Man. * Hobbit in Southampton, named after J. R. R. Tolkien's creation and threatened with legal action by US movie lawyers, because of this. * Lass O' Gowrie in Manchester, named after the poem by Carolina Nairne. * Moon and Sixpence pubs in Portland, Oregon; Whitby, North Yorkshire; Harrow, Middlesex; and Soho, London are named after Somerset Maugham's novel of the same name. * Moon Under Water, inspired by George Orwell's essay describing his perfect pub * Muppet Inn, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: (now the Globe) named for the tv series, books and comics. * Peveril of the Peak, in Manchester, commemorates a stagecoach that once connected Manchester and London, but the pub itself claims it is named for the novel by Sir Walter Scott. * Sherlock Holmes in Charing Cross, London contains a reproduction of the great detective's study. * Herbert Wells in Woking, a town that was fictionally destroyed by Martian invaders in H. G. Wells's The War of the Worlds. A 25' (7.6-metre) tall statue of a Martian stands in Chobham Road in the town, and a Martian is depicted in a drawing in the pub. * Edgar Wallace, The Strand, London, named for the 1930s mystery writer. * John Masefield in New Ferry, named for the former Poet Laureate who served for some years on a naval training ship, HMS Conway, off New Ferry pier. ===Pubs in books from real-world pubs=== The Ivy Bush pub at the junction of Hagley Rd/Monument Rd in Edgbaston * The Ivy Bush is a \"small inn on the Bywater road\" near Hobbiton in The Shire in J. R. R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Here Gaffer Gamgee recounted to the other regulars his stories about Bilbo and Frodo Baggins, who were about to throw a magnificent joint birthday party.The Fellowship of the Ring, \"A Long-expected Party\". The most likely real-world source is an Edgbaston pub called the Ivy Bush, near where Tolkien lived when he was growing up in Birmingham.Blackham, Bob, 'Tolkien's Birmingham', in Mallorn, the journal of The Tolkien Society (U.K.) issue 45, Spring 2008, p.27 ==Myths and legends== Images from myths and legends are evocative and memorable. * Black Horse (Black Bess): usually named after the legendary overnight ride from London to York in 1737 by Dick Turpin. This fictional account was popularised in a novel, Rookwood (1834), resulting in a surge of Dick Turpin nostalgia and associated pub names. *The Bucket of Blood, is a public house in Phillack, Hayle, Cornwall, owned by St Austell Brewery. It is thought to be named after an incident where the landlord brought up a bucket of blood from the building's well, as a murdered smuggler had been dropped there. * Fiddler's Green, a legendary place in the afterlife where existence consists of all leisure and no work. * George and Dragon: St George is the patron saint of England and his conflict with a dragon is essential to his story. This sign is a symbol of English nationalism. * Green Man: a spirit of the wild woods. The original images are in churches as a face peering through or made of leaves and petals; this character is the Will of the Wisp, the Jack of the Green. Some pub signs will show the green man as he appears in English traditional sword dances (in green hats). The Green Man is not the same character as Robin Hood, although the two may be linked. Some pubs which were the Green Man have become the Robin Hood; there are no pubs in Robin's own county of Nottinghamshire named the Green Man but there are Robin Hoods. The 1973 film The Wicker Man features a Green Man pub. * Moonrakers: In the 17th century, some Wiltshire yokels hid their smuggled liquor in the Crammer (a pond in Devizes) and used rakes to recover their stash. They were caught in the act by customs officials and they claimed they were trying to rake in a cheese, which was in fact the reflection of the full moon. The customs officials left thinking that the locals were a bit simple, whilst the locals recovered the smuggled goods without any more interference. The name Moonrakers has been used as a nickname for Wiltshire folk ever since and is the name of pubs in Devizes and Swindon. * Robin Hood, sometimes partnered by his second in charge to form the name Robin Hood and Little John. Other Robin Hood names can be found throughout Arnold, Nottinghamshire. These were given to pubs built in the new estates of the 1960s by the Home Brewery of Daybrook, Nottinghamshire: Arrow, Friar Tuck, Longbow, Maid Marian and Major Oak. * Silent Woman, Quiet Lady or Headless Woman: The origin is uncertain, with various local stories, such as a landlady whose tongue was cut out by smugglers so she couldn't talk to the authorities, or a saint beheaded for her Christianity. The pub signs sometimes have an image of a decapitated woman or the couplet: \"Here is a woman who has lost her head / She's quiet now\u2014you see she's dead\". * Captain's Wife, near the medieval trading port of Swanbridge on the south Wales coast near Penarth. The pub was converted during the 1970s from a row of fishermen's cottages. There is a local legend of a ghostly wife keeping endless vigil after her husband's boat was lost in a storm. ==Paired names== Common enough today, the pairing of words in the name of an inn or tavern was rare before the mid-17th century, but by 1708 had become frequent enough for a pamphlet to complain of 'the variety and contradictory language of the signs', citing absurdities such as 'Bull and Mouth', 'Whale and Cow', and 'Shovel and Boot'. Two years later an essay in the Spectator echoed this complaint, deriding among others such contemporary paired names as 'Bell and Neat's Tongue', though accepting 'Cat and Fiddle'. A possible explanation for doubling of names is the combining of businesses, for example when a landlord of one pub moved to another premises. Fashion, as in the rise of intentionally amusing paired names like 'Slug and Lettuce' and 'Frog and Firkin' (see Puns, Jokes and Corruptions below) in the late 20th century, is responsible for many more recent pub names. ==Personal names or titles== The Marquis of Granby, after whom a number of pubs are named. Some pubs are known by the names of former landlords and landladies, for instance Nellie's (originally the White Horse) in Beverley, and Ma Pardoe's (officially the Olde Swan) in Netherton, West Midlands. The Baron of Beef, Welwyn, Hertfordshire is named after a nineteenth-century landlord, George Baron, listed in Kelly's Directory for 1890 as \"Butcher and Beer Retailer\". Others are named after various people. * Duke of Bedford, Wisbech. * Rupert Brooke, Grantchester named after the soldier poet. * General Burgoyne * Duke of Cambridge * Clarkson, Wisbech, Isle of Ely: named for the local antislavery campaigner Thomas Clarkson. * General Elliot * Marquis of Granby: a general in the 18th century. He showed a great concern for the welfare of his men upon their retirement and provided funds for many ex-soldiers to establish taverns, which were subsequently named after him. (See right). * Nell Gwyn: mistress of Charles II. * Hardwicke Arms, Wisbech : named after local nobility. * Lord Nelson: Quite a common name (in various forms) throughout England but especially in Norfolk, where the admiral was born. The Hero of Norfolk at Swaffham, Norfolk, portrays Nelson as did Norfolk Hero at Wisbech. * Guy Earl of Warwick, in Welling, Dartford, dates from at least 1896. and is thought to be the \"Halfway House\" which appears in Charles Dickens' 1861 Great Expectations. * Duke of Wellington * The Shakespeare, Redland, Shakespeare\u2019s Tree, Bidford-on-Avon, Warwickshire: Used to celebrate the Bard's genius. ==Places== * Tavistock Inn, as for example at Poundsgate, Dartmoor. * The Bailey Head a new name for the former Castle Tavern or Eagles sited on the Bailey Head, the name of the market square in Oswestry * Beachy Head * Horse Shoe Hole Inn, Leverington was located near the River Nene horse shoe feature. * London Inn * Mutley Tavern in Mutley Plain, Plymouth * Plymouth Inn * Twelve Pins or Na Beanna Beola (Finsbury Park, London): the Twelve Pins mountain range in the west of Ireland.History of the Twelve Pins (brief). Retrieved on 2009-04-05. * Cheviot Inn, Bellingham, Northumberland: a range of hills, the Cheviot Hills, of which the highest is locally called The Cheviot. * Kentish Horse An \"arms\" name, too, can derive from a pub's town. * Bedford Arms, Bedford Road, Hitchin, Hertfordshire, shows the arms of the town of Bedford. The more usual derivation is for the Duke of Bedford whose seat is at the nearby Woburn Abbey. ==Plants and horticulture== Hoop and Grapes, Aldgate High Street, London The most common tree-based pub name is the Royal Oak, which refers to a Historical event. * Bush, Holly Bush, Mulberry Bush etc. refer to plants, but note that Bull and Bush refers to a battle (see Historical event above). * Chequers from the Wild Service Tree or \"Chequer(s) Tree\", the fruit of which was used to flavour beer before the introduction of hops. * Crabtree would refer to a crab apple tree growing nearby or in the grounds, as pubs are often free standing. * Flower Pot, Mirfield, Maidstone, Kent, Aston, Oxfordshire, Henley-on-Thames and Wisbech, Isle of Ely. Flowerpots, Cheriton, Hampshire. * Hand and Flower, Hammersmith, London, also Ham, Surrey. Hand and Flowers, Marlow. * Major Oak, Nottingham. Named after an ancient tree, and locally associated with Robin Hood * Pineapple, e.g. in The Pineapple, Kentish Town, also Berkshire and Oldham. * Pink Geranium, a pub in Pontardawe. * Rose Tavern, a pub in Wisbech, Isle of Ely. * Tulip, Chelmsford. * Vine or Grapes possibly harks back to the Roman custom of displaying a vine outside a tavern or wine-shop, as in The Hoop and Grapes in Aldgate High Street, London (reputed to be the city's oldest pub) and the Vine, Wisbech (now closed). * Wheatsheaf, a Wetherspoon pub in Wisbech. ==Politically incorrect== * All labour in vain or Labour in vain. At various locations. Probably of Biblical origins, in past times the name was often illustrated by a person trying to scrub the blackness off a black child. Such signs, now deemed offensive, have been mostly replaced with more innocuous depictions of wasted effort.\"The present sign is the innocuous replacement for one that became the centre of a storm a dozen or so years ago. As readers may remember, the original illustration was of a white couple trying to scrub the blackness off a black child in a tub. It was deemed by many to be in poor taste and potentially offensive, but there was an outcry when it was removed following a protest by two schoolgirls.\" * There are numerous old pubs and inns in England with the name of the Black Boy, many now claimed to refer either to child chimneysweeps or coal miners, or to a (genuine) historic description of King Charles II. The Black Boy Inn, Caernarfon, North Wales, has received at least a dozen complaints from visitors over the name, which dates back at least 250 years. However, the police say they have not received any formal complaints. * The Black Bitch, a pub in Linlithgow, West Lothian, is named after the local legend of a black greyhound who is said to have repeatedly swum to an island in the town's loch to bring food to its imprisoned master, only to suffer the same fate when its efforts were discovered. The pub's name has caused more than a few surprised tourists to question the name or decry it as racist. ==The pub itself (including nicknames)== ===The pub building=== The Crooked House, Himley, known for its extreme lean, caused by mining subsidence * Candlestick, West End, Essendon, Hertfordshire: Once the Chequers, lit by a single candle and plunged into darkness when the landlord took the candle to the cellar to fetch beer. * Crooked Chimney, Lemsford, Hertfordshire: The pub's chimney is distinctively crooked. * Crooked House, nickname of the Glynne Arms, Himley, Staffordshire.

It gave its name to an underground station and an area of London. * Swiss Gardens, Shoreham-by-Sea, originally the pub of a Swiss-themed Victorian picnic garden and amusement park. * Vaults, a number of pubs, not all having vaults as an architectural feature; the word also had the general meaning of 'storeroom'.'A place of this kind used as a cellar or storeroom for provisions or liquors.' Oxford English Dictionary, Second edition, 1989; online version June 2011. ; accessed 1 September 2011. By extension 'the vaults' was formerly used to designate a particular type of bar. At a time (mid 19th-mid 20th century) when the several areas in a pub served different clientele, 'the vaults' would cater largely for working-class drinkers and would most usually be men-only. * White Elephant, Northampton, Northamptonshire. Originally built as a hotel to accommodate visitors to the adjacent Northampton Racecourse, the building became a \"white elephant\" (useless object) when horse racing was stopped at Northampton Racecourse in 1904. ===Services provided by the pub=== The Farriers Arms, Shilbottle * Coach & Horses, for a coaching inn * Farriers Arms, for a pub with a farrier who could re-shoe the traveller's horses * Free Press, named for when part of the building in Cambridge was used to print a newspaper. * Horse & Groom, where the traveller's horse would be cared for while the traveller drank * Wheelwrights, for a pub where a coach's wheels could be repaired or replaced ===Beer and wine=== The Barley Mow, Clifton Hampden Many traditional pub names refer to the drinks available inside, most often beer. * Barley Mow: a stack (or sheaf) of barley, the principal grain from which beer is made. * Barrels: A cask or keg containing 36 Imperial gallons of liquid, especially beer. Other sizes include: pin, 36 pints; firkin, 9 gallons; kilderkin, 18 gallons; half-hogshead, 27 gallons; hogshead, 54 gallons; butt, probably 104 gallons. * Brewery Tap: A pub originally found on site or adjacent to a brewery and often showcasing its products to visitors; although, now that so many breweries have closed, the house may be nowhere near an open brewery. * Burton Stingo, Wisbech thought to be named after the Burton ales and Stingo on sale within. * Bushel (and New Bushel), Wisbech, Isle of Ely: named after a unit of volume used in a corn exchange to trade including barley used in brewing. * Cock and Bottle, or simply Cock: The stopcock used to serve beer from a barrel, and a beer bottle. * Hop Inn: Hop flowers are the ingredient in beer which gives it its bitter taste, though this name is often intended as a pun. * Hop Pole: The poles which support wires or ropes up which hops grow in the field. * (Sir) John Barleycorn: A character of English traditional folk music and folklore, similar to a Green Man. He is annually cut down at the ankles, thrashed, but always reappears\u2014an allegory of growth and harvest based on barley. * Leather(n) Bottle: A container in which a small amount of beer or wine was transported, now replaced by a glass bottle or can. * Malt Shovel: A shovel used in a malting to turn over the barley grain. * Mash Tun: a brewery vessel used to mix grains with water. * Pint Shop : unit of volume. * Three Tuns: Based on the arms of two City of London guilds, the Worshipful Company of Vintners and the Worshipful Company of Brewers. ===Food=== Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese, Fleet Street, London Other pub names refer to items of food to tempt the hungry traveller. For example, The Baron of Beef in Cambridge refers to a double sirloin joined at the backbone. * Shoulder of Mutton, Wisbech is another pub named for a joint of meat. ==Puns, jokes and corruptions== Pub heritage: Nowhere Inn Particular, now closed Although puns became increasingly popular through the twentieth century, they should be considered with care. Supposed corruptions of foreign phrases usually have much simpler explanations. Many old names for pubs that appear nonsensical are often alleged to have come from corruptions of slogans or phrases, such as \"The Bag o'Nails\" (Bacchanals), \"The Cat and the Fiddle\" (Caton Fidele) and \"The Bull and Bush\", which purportedly celebrates the victory of Henry VIII at \"Boulogne Bouche\" or Boulogne-sur-Mer Harbour. Often, these corruptions evoke a visual image which comes to signify the pub; these images had particular importance for identifying a pub on signs and other media before literacy became widespread. Sometimes the basis of a nickname is not the name, but its pictorial representation on the sign that becomes corrupt, through weathering, or unskillful paintwork by an amateur artist. Apparently, many pubs called the Cat or Cat and Custard Pot were originally Tigers or Red Lions with signs that \"looked more like a cat\" in the opinion of locals. * Axe and Gate: Possibly from \"ax (or ask) and get\". * Bag o'Nails: Thought by the romantic to be a corrupted version of \"Bacchanals\" but really is just a sign once used by ironmongers. The pub of this name in Bristol, England was named in the 1990s for the former reason, though the latter is more prevalent. * Barge Inn. A play on words 'barge in'. The Barge Inn in Bradford-on-Avon, Wiltshire is however actually on a canal, where barges tie up. * Beartown Tap, Congleton, Cheshire. 'Beartown' is the nickname for Congleton, as local legend claims its townsfolk once 'sold the bible to buy the bear', that is, spent money set aside to buy a parish Bible on providing bear-baiting at their fair. Congleton history website * Bent Brief, once close to the Honest Lawyer on Lodge Road, Southampton. * Bird and Baby, the familiar name used by the Inklings for the Eagle and Child pub in Oxford (see above under Heraldry). * Buck and Ear in the Steveston area of Richmond, British Columbia. The name alludes not only to the maritime heritage of the area but also to a previous establishment at the same location that was called \"The Buccaneer\". * Bull and Mouth: Believed to celebrate the victory of Henry VIII at \"Boulogne Mouth\" or Harbour. Also applies to Bull and Bush (Boulogne Bouche). * Case is Altered: The title of an early comedy by Ben Jonson, first published in 1609, based on a remark by lawyer Edmund Plowden which entered into common currency. Also said to be a corruption of the Latin phrase Casa Alta ('high house') or Casa Altera ('second house'). There are several examples in England, such as at Hatton, Warwickshire The Case is Altered (now closed) and a later new build pub 'The Case' also now closed both in Wisbech, Isle of Ely. * Cat and Fiddle: a corruption of Caton le Fid\u00e8le (a governor of Calais loyal to King Edward III). Alternatively from Katherine la Fid\u00e8le, Henry VIII's first wife. * Cock and Bull: a play on \"cock and bull story\". This term is said to derive from the Cock and the Bull, two pubs in Stony Stratford, Buckinghamshire, which are close neighbours and rival coaching inns. * Dew Drop Inn: A pun on \"do drop in\". * Dirty Duck: The Black Swan, as in Stratford-on-Avon; also The Mucky Duck in Portsmouth and the Students Union pub at the University of Warwick * Dirty Habit: Sited on the route of the Pilgrims' Way, the name is a play on the contemptuous phrase and a reference to the clothing of monks who passed by on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Elephant and Castle pub sign near Bury St Edmunds, interpreting the name as a howdah * Elephant and Castle: By folk etymology, a corruption of \"la Infanta de Castile\". It is popularly believed amongst residents of Elephant and Castle that a 17th-century publican near Newington named his tavern after the Spanish princess who was affianced to King Charles I of England. The prohibition of this marriage by Church authorities in 1623 was a cause of war with Spain so it seems unlikely to have been a popular name. A more probable and prosaic explanation is that the name derives from the arms of the Worshipful Company of Cutlers, a London trade guild; an elephant carrying a castle-shaped howdah can also be seen on the arms of the City of Coventry. * Fawcett Inn (\"force it in\"), Portsmouth. * Gate Hangs Well, common in the Midlands: \"This Gate Hangs Well, and hinders none. Refresh and pay and travel on.\" Also frequently found as 'Hanging Gate'. * Goat and Compass[es]: Possibly based on the arms of the Worshipful Company of Cordwainers, whose coat of arms contains three goats, together with the Worshipful Company of Carpenters, whose coat of arms contains three compasses.

A double pun in that hops are a major ingredient in beer making. * Jolly Taxpayer in Portsmouth. * Letters Inn (\"let us in\") * Library: So students and others can say they're in 'the library', * Nag's Head. Pub signs can play on the double meaning of Nag \u2013 a horse or a scolding woman. * Nowhere, Plymouth; Nowhere Inn Particular, Croydon: Wife calls husband on his mobile and asks where he is. He answers truthfully \"Nowhere\". * Office: as above. * Ostrich, Ipswich: originally Oyster Reach (the old name has since been restored on the advice of historians). * Paraffin Oil Shop (now closed, at the crossing of A5080 and B5179 in eastern Liverpool, Google Earth view here: So people could say that they are going to buy paraffin. * Pig and Whistle: a corruption of the Anglo-Saxon saying piggin wassail meaning \"good health\". * Swan With Two Necks: In England and Wales, wild mute swans swimming in open water have traditionally been the property of the reigning monarch, who had the right to grant swan marks. In the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I granted the right to ownership of some swans to the Worshipful Company of Vintners. To tell which swan belonged to whom, the Vintners' swans' beaks would be marked with two notches, or nicks. The word 'nick' was mistaken for 'neck', and so the Vintners spotted that a Swan With Two Necks could afford them a rather clever pun, and a striking pub sign. When Swan Upping is carried out nowadays rings are used in lieu of nicking beaks. * Three Chimneys, Biddenden: During the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) it is said that up to 3,000 French prisoners were kept at nearby Sissinghurst Castle. The French seamen were placed on parole in the surrounding area and were allowed out as far as the pub building. At the time locals referred to this as the 'Three Wents' (or three ways) but the prisoners called it Les Trois Chemins. The unique name of the Three Chimneys therefore derives from the French term for the junction of three roads. ==Religious== Lion and Lamb, Farnham The amount of religious symbolism in pub names decreased after Henry VIII's break from the church of Rome. For instance, many pubs now called the King's Head were originally called the Pope's Head. * Anchor, Hope & Anchor, Anchor & Hope: From the Letter to the Hebrews (6:19): \"We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope.\" * Cross Keys: The sign of St Peter, the gatekeeper of Heaven. Often found near a church dedicated to St Peter. When people walked to the Sunday service they often stayed afterwards, at a house near the church, to drink beer and to watch or participate in sporting events. These venues became known as pubs and would use the sign of the saint to which the church was dedicated - the Cross Keys for St Peter, an Eagle for St John, a Lion for St Mark. The sporting events might include the racing or fighting of dogs, bulls, cocks or pheasants, or the hunting of foxes, with or without hounds - thus giving rise to further pub signs. * Lamb & Flag: From the Gospel of John (1:29): \"Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world.\" The Lamb is seen carrying a flag (usually of St. George) and is the symbol of the Knights Templar, the Worshipful Company of Merchant Taylors, and St John's College, Oxford. A pub of this name appeared in the popular BBC sitcom Bottom. * Five Ways: Possibly referring to the \"Five Ways\" of Thomas Aquinas, five reasons for the existence of God. * Lion & Lamb: The lion is a symbol of the Resurrection, the lamb a symbol of the Redeemer. * Mitre: A bishop's headgear, a simple sign easily recognisable by the illiterate.

His son, also Arthur, is usually referred to as the Duke of Connaught, another pub name. * Prince Leopold, Southsea, Portsmouth, Hampshire: Queen Victoria's fourth son. * Queen Victoria reigned at the time of greatest expansion of housing stock and associated pubs, and at the height of the British Empire. She inspired great loyalty and affection, and publicans aimed to reflect this. * Prince of Wales: the title of the heir to the monarchy was also popular in Victorian times, when Albert Edward was the longest-serving holder of the title. * Princess of Wales: following the death of Diana, Princess of Wales, a number of pubs were renamed Princess of Wales, including the Prince of Wales on Morden Road in South Wimbledon.

The two surveys most often cited, both taken in 2007, are by the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) and CAMRA. According to BBPA, the most common names are: #Red Lion (759) #Royal Oak (626) #White Hart (427) #Rose and Crown (326) #King's Head (310) #King's Arms (284) #Queen's Head (278) #The Crown (261) and according to CAMRA they are: #Crown (704) #Red Lion (668) #Royal Oak (541) #Swan (451) #White Hart (431) #Railway (420) #Plough (413) #White Horse (379) #Bell (378)In 2008 it was claimed that the total number of names incorporating the word 'Bell' totalled 412. #New Inn (372) A more current listing can be found on the Pubs Galore site, updated daily as pubs open/close and change names. As of 18 December 2019, the top 10 were: #Red Lion (558) #Crown (509) #Royal Oak (432) #White Hart (317) #Swan (296) #Plough (294) #Railway (294) #White Horse (286) #Kings Arms (245) #Ship (244) The number of each is given in brackets. ==Curiosities== The pubs with the shortest and longest names in Britain are both in Stalybridge: Q and The Old Thirteenth Cheshire Astley Volunteer Rifleman Corps Inn. The longest name of a London pub, I am the Only Running Footman, was used as the title of a mystery novel by Martha Grimes. There is a \"pub with no name\" in Southover Street, Brighton, and another near to Petersfield, Hampshire, so known (despite having an actual name), because its sign on the nearest main road has been missing for many years.https://www.whitehorsepetersfield.co.uk/ The Salley Pussey's Inn at Royal Wootton Bassett is said to have been named after Sarah Purse, whose family owned The Wheatsheaf pub in the 19th century.
