    "text": "The black-faced lion tamarin or Superag\u00fci lion tamarin (Leontopithecus caissara) is a small New World monkey of the family Callitrichidae. It is critically endangered and endemic to coastal forests in southeastern Brazil. There are several conservation projects and the total populations is unlikely to exceed 400 individuals. It is overall golden-orange with contrasting black head, legs and tail. == Discovery and distribution == The black-faced lion tamarin was not recognized until 1990 when two Brazilian researchers, Maria Lucia Lorini and Vanessa Persson, described it based on individuals from the island of Superagui in the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1.Russell A. Mittermeier et al. Primates in Peril: The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates, 2004\u20132006 \"Primate Conservation\" 2006 Shortly after additional populations were discovered on the adjacent mainland in Paran\u00e1 and in the far southern S\u00e3o Paulo.Kleiman, Devra G. and Jeremy J.C. Mallinson. (Feb. 1998). Recovery and Management Committees for Lion Tamarins: Partnerships in Conservation Planning and Implementation. Society for Conservation Biology. The specific name caissara is a reference to the caicaras, the local people of Superagui Island. Mainland populations prefer swampy and inundated secondary forest for habitat. The island population use mainly tall lowland forest and arboreal restinga (coastal forest on sandy soils) as primary habitat. Both populations strictly remain at altitudes below . == Behavior == The black-faced lion tamarin is an arboreal species and primarily eats small fruits and invertebrates such as insect, spiders and snails. They are also known to drink nectar, eat the young leaves of bromeliads and consume mushrooms. They are thought to supplement parts of their diet with mushrooms during the dry season. The black-faced lion tamarin lives in extended family groups with 2-8 members. Within these families there is normally only one breeding female per season. Births typically occur from September to March and females normally give birth to twins. Social interaction is a key component in maintaining a reproductive system such as this. Grooming is the most common form of affiliative behavior seen by the species specifically between the breeding pair.Gabriela Ludwig.

Agriculture, development, fragmentation and extraction of heart-of-palm are the leading causes for their habitat loss.Vivekananda, G. 2001. Parque Nacional do Superagui: A presen\u00e7a humana e os objetivos de conserva\u00e7\u00e3o. Masters Thesis, Universidade Federal do Paran\u00e1. It is also threatened from the illegal pet trade, hunting, increased tourism and inbreeding depression. === Protection and conservation projects === The Superag\u00fci lion tamarin is listed as critically endangered by the IUCN, included on the Endangered Species Act and is listed on CITES Appendix I. Within Brazil, it is included on the national Official List of Species Threatened with ExtinctionLista Oficial de Esp\u00e9cies Brasileiras Amea\u00e7adas de Extin\u00e7\u00e3o, Edict No. 1.522/19 December 1989, see Bernardes et al. 1990; Fonseca et al. 1994 and it is also on regional lists by both the Paran\u00e1 and S\u00e3o Paulo states.Brazil, Paran\u00e1 SEMA, 1995Brazil, S\u00e3o Paulo SMA, 1998 The Superag\u00fci National Park covers most of the black-faced lion tamarin home ranges including Superagui Island and adjacent mainland parts of the state of Paran\u00e1. The national park is 33,988 hectares large and the black-faced lion tamarin is one of the endemic species that is used as a conservation unit for management of the park. The population in S\u00e3o Paulo is protected in the Jacupiranga State Park. The Instituto de Pesquisas Ecol\u00f3gicas (IP\u00ca) began the black-faced lion tamarin conservation program in 1996 and through 2004 focused on learning the ecology and natural history of the species. In 2005, enough data was collected to create the first conservation action plan for the black-faced lion tamarin and its habitat. As well as collecting additional data, from 2005 to 2007 IP\u00ca completed a diagnostic of threats to the survival of the species. They then hosted the first Eco- Negotiation Workshop in Ariri (S\u00e3o Paulo) in 2009, with a focus on education and awareness of sustainable production. Currently some of their objectives include evaluating dispersal of young, refine the projected population, observe the effects of sea rise due to climate change, and promote sustainable harvest of heart-of-palm. == References == == External links == black-faced lion tamari Category:Mammals of Brazil Category:Endemic fauna of Brazil Category:Critically endangered animals Category:Critically endangered biota of South America black-faced lion tamari ",
