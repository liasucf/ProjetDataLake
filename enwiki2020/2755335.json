    "text": "Bust of French sculptor Pierre Puget by Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Delaistre, The Louvre, 1827 Fran\u00e7ois-Nicolas Delaistre (Paris 9 March 1746 - 23 April 1832 Paris) was a French sculptor. Delaistre was educated by F\u00e9lix Lecomte and Louis-Claude Vass\u00e9. Delaistre won the Prix de Rome in 1772; he studied a year at the \u00c9cole royale des \u00e9l\u00e8ves prot\u00e9g\u00e9s at the French Academy and later at the Acad\u00e9mie de France in Rome between 1773 and 1777. It was there that he probably first met the architect Pierre-Adrien P\u00e2ris, with whom he later collaborated. His best-known work, the group Cupid and Psyche, was originally executed in Rome (the later marble version is in the Louvre at Paris). The Nuttall Encyclopedia mentions \"Delaistre, a French statuary, born in Paris (1836-1891)\": this may be a relative of Fran\u00e7ois Delaistre. ==References== * ==Further reading== *Marie-Nicolas Bouillet & Alexis Chassang (dir.), \u00ab Fran\u00e7ois Delaistre \u00bb in Dictionnaire universel d\u2019histoire et de g\u00e9ographie, 1878 *Catalogue d'exposition, Skulptur aus dem Louvre.
