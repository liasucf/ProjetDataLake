As a record producer, he has worked for a variety of artists, including Natasha Bedingfield, Matt Nathanson, Kate Voegele, Matt Duke, Amy Grant, Eric Paslay, Frankie Ballard, Audrey Assad and Marc Broussard. The week of February 3, 2014 Marshall had his first #1 charting production with Eric Paslay's Friday Night. The same week, Frankie Ballard's, Helluva Life, also produced by Marshall charted in the Top 10 at #8. Helluva Life quickly climbed the charts, and became Marshall's second #1 charting production the week of March 17, 2014.

He moved to the Los Angeles, California area for high school and stayed in the area until the summer of 2010, when he moved his studio and family to Nashville. ==Early career, A&R; work== After graduating high school in Huntington Beach, California Altman attended college at UC Santa Barbara, for a major in business and a minor in music. He left UC Santa Barbara before finishing his degree to attend the Grove School of Music in Los Angeles. After finishing at Grove, he went on to perform a series of odd and side jobs such pizza delivery, waiter, and swim teacher while also working for free as a music programmer. Eventually he started a recording career with a studio as a second engineer. When that studio went out of business, he borrowed money to set up his own small recording studio in Hollywood. While running his own studio he did work writing software, which then lead to software work with Capitol/EMI. He quit his studio and left for a job at Capitol, working in sales and eventually moving to the A&R; department as a scout. During this time he formed a band called Farmer in 1995 that was signed by Aware Records and later released an eponymous album in 1997. While on the road touring with Farmer he served as an A&R; scout for Capitol, while also listening to demo submissions. One of those submissions was for the artist Citizen Cope (Clarence Greenwood), which he helped develop and was able to get signed a record deal to Capitol. Following the signing, Altman was awarded with an executive A&R; job. He quit his band and focused on A&R;, keeping the career for ten years. During this time he moved from Capitol Records, to Hollywood Records and to finally Columbia Records where he principally A&R;'d Katy Perry & OneRepublic. ==Record Producer== During his last years as an A&R; executive at Columbia, he also began actively working as a record producer. Some of his early work includes producing Marc Broussard's first two albums, Momentary Setback and Carencro, as well as an album for the band Jupiter Sunrise. He eventually left Columbia to pursue being a full-time record producer in 2005, starting the Galt Line Music label and a studio in Burbank, California. During the production of Todd Carey's album Watching Waiting he was introduced to engineer Eric Robinson by Carey, and Altman and Robinson would continue a working partnership at the Galt Line for years afterward. At the Galt Line he would go on to produce for a variety of artists, achieving commercial success with albums such as Kate Voegele's Don't Look Away and Matt Nathanson's Some Mad Hope. His other producer credits include albums for: Bethany Dillon, Natasha Bedingfield, Gabe Dixon, Walker Hayes, Rosi Golan, Adema, Matt Wertz, Trevor Hall, Caitlin Crosby, Kimberly Caldwell, and Tom Morello and others.
