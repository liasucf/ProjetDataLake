Originally Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix was going to be a Windows title, sequeling Dance Dance Revolution which had been released a couple of years before.ESRB website with the search term \"Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix\". Screenshots of the game under development were released to video game news sites showing an interface that closely resembled the previous Windows game. Later in development the game was completely changed visually and released on the Microsoft Xbox. ===Dancing Stage SuperNova 2=== :This game was never released. Reason: PlayStation 2 and arcade board blacklist issues. The European arcade release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2, titled Dancing Stage SuperNova 2, was never released due to importation issues surrounding the PlayStation 2-based engine. The arcade release of DDR SuperNova 2 uses an imported Japanese PlayStation 2 to power the game. The import ban came after the release of Dancing Stage SuperNova, the second Dance Dance Revolution arcade released in Europe to use a PlayStation 2 engine. Dancing Stage SuperNova 2 was released for the European PlayStation 2 directly on October 3, 2008. The songlist is mostly based on the North American PlayStation 2 release of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2 instead of the arcade release, but with 12 of the licenses removed and a new one, Cara Mia by M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w, added. ===Dance Dance Revolution Solo (International)=== :Only a test build existed in North America; this game never saw a full release outside of Asia. Dance Dance Revolution Solo Bass Mix had a public test build in early 2000 in the United States at Konami's former test location Diversions in Chicago, IL. It was later replaced with Dance Dance Revolution USA. Major differences from the Japanese build is the absence of 3 songs: \"That's The Way '98,\" \"Together and Forever\", and \"Get Off.\" The Nonstop Megamix course including these songs were also not present. All other functions and hidden modes were available for play including Maniac mode, Ultimate Maniac mode, Nonstop Megamix, and machine link play. Dancing Stage Solo is a cancelled video game for Europe. Konami filed to trademark the name on July 9, 1999. It was registered on July 25, 2000, but expired ten years after filing. This game's Caution screen, high score background and title screen were present as unused game data in the Asian versions of Dance Dance Revolution Solo 2000. ===DDRMAX3 Dance Dance Revolution 8thMix=== :Released as Dance Dance Revolution Extreme. However, many images on the Internet represent a long-standing hoax. ===Dance Dance Revolution (2014) (North America)=== Dance Dance Revolution (2014) had a location test in USA. :Only a test build exists, this game never saw a full release in North America. The test build was available to the public on mid 2015 in select Round 1 and Dave & Buster's shops in the United States. e-Amusement functionality was available. The game was later replaced with Dance Dance Revolution A in the United States and Canada, making it the first Dance Dance Revolution release in USA since Dance Dance Revolution X2 and the first in Canada since Dance Dance Revolution X. The USA location test of Dance Dance Revolution (2014) removed 22 songs found in the Japanese release: * DDR (2014): 2 Konami originals * DDR (2013): 6 licenses * DDR X3: all licenses * DDR 2ndMix: all Dancemania licenses: ** \"Bad Girls\" by Juliet Roberts ** \"Boom Boom Dollar (Red Monster Mix)\" by King Kong & D. Jungle Girls ** \"Stomp to My Beat\" by JS16 * DDR (1998): \"Kung Fu Fighting\" by Bus Stop featuring Carl Douglas ==Unofficial releases== Dance Dance Revolution Megamix and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Plus are commercial bootlegs of Dance Dance Revolution Extreme. Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Pro and Dance Dance Revolution Extreme Clarity are fan-made unofficial patches for Dance Dance Revolution Extreme. Pro enables the Marvelous timing window in all play modes, a feature that debuted in Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2, while also unlocking all songs automatically and using Oni scoring in all modes. It also adds support for BrightWhite, a fan-made alternative to the memory card reader. DDR Extreme Clarity improves upon Pro by adding Slow and Fast timing indicators, a feature only available in some circumstances beginning with Dance Dance Revolution X2. Fan-made releases, designed to run on the StepMania software, include: * DDRMAX3 Dance Dance Revolution 8thMix * DDRMAX4 Dance Dance Revolution New Collection * EXTRAMAX Dance Dance Revolution New Collection 2 * DDRMAX5 Dance Dance Revolution 10thMix * Dance Dance Revolution Xtreme 2 (not to be confused with Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2) * Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 3 * Dance Dance Revolution Hottest Party 6 * Dance Dance Revolution XX -STARLiGHT- ==Notes== *Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix was updated after its initial release with a few new songs and the ability to connect to and play alongside Konami's DJ simulator games, Beatmania IIDX. While the official name of that version of DDR when alone was Dance Dance Revolution 2ndMix Link Version, when connected to the two Beatmania IIDX cabinets it was compatible with it was referred to by two other unique names. *Along with the \"International Versions\" of Japan's DDR series, Korea specific versions of Dance Dance Revolution 3rdMix were released with a partly exclusive song list. Some of the Korean songs were later featured in the Japanese and international Dance Dance Revolution 4thMix, as well as the Plus and Solo versions. They have not been used in the DDR series since. *Due to a licensing mishap during the launch of Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix, the game was temporarily unavailable to Canadian players, forcing them to wait for Konami to secure the rights to certain songs and rerelease the game for all of North America. *The \"second release\" versions of Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova and Dancing Stage SuperNova in North America and Europe were a game disc replacement to fix audio syncing issues with the initial release of the game. Along with bug fixes, the discs added new songs to both versions. *As of 2017, two Canadian arcades imported Dance Dance Revolution X2 and one imported Dance Dance Revolution A from the United States. ==References== ==External links== *DanceDanceRevolution/Dancing Stage Game Database *All Versions, Songlists, FAQs, and Gamesaves *Konami Arcade Hardware Dance Dance Revolution games ",
