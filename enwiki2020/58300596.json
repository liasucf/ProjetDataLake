    "text": "The Charles and Theresa Roper House, also known as Hilan Castle, is a historic residence located in Newport, Oregon, United States. Built in 1912\u20131913 to evoke a castle in the Scottish Highlands, it features such Medieval-inspired elements as a crenellated parapet, mullioned windows, a rounded corner tower, and a cantilevered turret. It is one of very few examples of the Castellated Gothic Revival style in Oregon, other than local armories. Its first owners, both English immigrants, were locally notable figures: Charles Roper was a professional photographer whose work comprises an important documentary record of central Lincoln County in the 1910s and 1920s. He was elected mayor of Newport in 1922, and maintained a photography studio on the top floor of his house. Theresa Roper was the writer and illustrator of several books of romanticized history, and was a collector of local Native American objects that she used as a basis for her illustrations.. The house was converted from single-family use to apartments in 1975. It was entered on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981.\"Department of the Interior, National Park Service: National Register of Historic Places; Annual Listing of Historic Properties\", 48 FR 8626 (March 1, 1983), at p. 8659. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Lincoln County, Oregon ==References== ==External links== * Category:Houses completed in 1913 Category:1913 establishments in Oregon Category:Gothic Revival architecture in Oregon Category:National Register of Historic Places in Lincoln County, Oregon Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Oregon Category:Newport, Oregon ",
