Eruptions of Bead Geyser last about 2\u00bd minutes and are high. Bead is an extremely regular geyser. The interval between eruptions is 28\u201336 minutes. This changes with time but the average for any given time hardly varies. The duration is also highly regular at about 150 seconds. Bead Geyser was named after the geyser eggs, loose spherical pieces of geyserite, that used to be found near the geyser. Over the decades since it was discovered, souvenir hunters have removed all of the geyser eggs. ==References== Category:Geysers of Wyoming Category:Geothermal features of Teton County, Wyoming Category:Geothermal features of Yellowstone National Park Category:Geysers of Teton County, Wyoming ",
