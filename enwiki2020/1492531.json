    "text": "Ramesh Krishnan (born 5 June 1961) is a tennis coach and former professional tennis player from India. As a junior player in the late 1970s, he won the singles titles at both, Wimbledon and the French Open. He went on to reach three Grand Slam quarterfinals in the 1980s and was a part of the Indian team which reached the final of the Davis Cup in 1987. Krishnan also beat then- world No. 1, Mats Wilander, at the 1989 Australian Open. He became India's Davis Cup captain in 2007. ==Early life== Ramesh was born in Madras, India, and is the son of Ramanathan Krishnan who was one of the world's leading tennis players in the 1960s. Ramesh emulated an achievement of his father's by winning the Wimbledon junior title in 1979. He also won the French Open junior title that year, and was ranked the No. 1 junior player in the world. ==Career== At the senior level, Ramesh reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon once (1986) and the US Open twice (1981 and 1987). He was admired for his touch, anticipation and all-round game, but his lack of a killer stroke or a strong service kept him from reaching the very top of the men's game. Ramesh was a key member of the Indian team which reached the Davis Cup final in 1987. In the semifinals against Australia, he beat John Fitzgerald in four sets the opening singles match, and then defeated Wally Masur in straight sets the decisive fifth rubber to give India a 3\u20132 victory. However, in the final against Sweden, India was defeated 5\u20130 with Krishnan losing two singles matches to Mats Wilander and Anders J\u00e4rryd and with the Indian team managing to win only one set in the entire tournament. Ramesh was a stalwart on India's Davis Cup team from 1977 to 1993, compiling a 29\u201321 winning record (23\u201319 in singles and 6\u20132 in doubles). At the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Ramesh reached the men's doubles quarterfinals partnering Leander Paes. Ramesh retired from the professional tour in 1993. Over the course of his career, he won eight top-level singles titles and one doubles title; he also won four challenger singles titles (defeating the young Andre Agassi in the Schenectady final in 1986). His career-high singles ranking was world No. 23, in January 1985. In 1998, Ramesh was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in recognition of his achievements and contributions to Indian tennis. Ramesh runs a tennis academy in Chennai, set up along the lines of similar institutions in the United States. He became India Davis Cup team captain in January 2007. ==ATP Tour career finals== ===Singles: 12 (8 titles, 4 runner- ups)=== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L !style=\"width:65px\"|Date !style=\"width:160px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:55px\"|Surface !style=\"width:160px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:120px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 1. | 1981 | Manila, Philippines | Carpet (i) | Ivan Dupasquier | 6\u20134, 6\u20134 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 2. | 1982 | Stuttgart, West Germany | Clay | Sandy Mayer | 5\u20137, 6\u20133, 6\u20133, 7\u20136 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 3. | 1984 | Metz, France | Carpet (i) | Jan Gunnarsson | 6\u20133, 6\u20133 |- | style=\"background:#FFA07A;\"|Loss | 1. | 1985 | Cologne, West Germany | Carpet (i) | Peter Lundgren | 3\u20136, 2\u20136 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 4. | 1986 | Tokyo Outdoor, Japan | Hard | Johan Carlsson | 6\u20133, 6\u20131 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 5. | 1986 | Hong Kong, UK | Hard | Andres Gomez | 7\u20136, 6\u20130, 7\u20135 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 6. | 1988 | Wellington, New Zealand | Hard | Andrei Chesnokov | 6\u20137, 6\u20130, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 |- | style=\"background:#FFA07A;\"|Loss | 2. | 1988 | Auckland, New Zealand | Hard | Amos Mansdorf | 3\u20136, 4\u20136 |- | style=\"background:#FFA07A;\"|Loss | 3. | 1988 | Bristol, UK | Grass | Christian Saceanu | 4\u20136, 6\u20132, 2\u20136 |- | style=\"background:#FFA07A;\"|Loss | 4. | 1988 | Rye Brook, US | Hard | Milan Srejber | 2\u20136, 6\u20137 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 7. | 1989 | Auckland, New Zealand | Hard | Amos Mansdorf | 6\u20134, 6\u20130 |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 8. | 1990 | Schenectady, US | Hard | Kelly Evernden | 6\u20131, 6\u20131 |} ===Doubles: 1 (1 title)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:30px\" class=\"unsortable\"|W/L !style=\"width:65px\"|Date !style=\"width:160px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:55px\"|Surface !style=\"width:160px\"|Partner !style=\"width:160px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:120px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 1. | 1987 | Nancy, France | Carpet (i) | Claudio Mezzadri | Grant Connell Larry Scott | 6\u20134, 6\u20134 |} ==ATP Challenger finals== ===Singles: 4 (4 titles)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% !width=75|Outcome !width=20|No. !width=50|Year !width=150|Tournament !width=65|Surface !width=160|Opponent !width=100|Score |- |style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner | 1. | 1986 | Schenectady, US | Hard | Andre Agassi | 6\u20132, 6\u20133 |- |style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner | 2. | 1987 | Nagoya, Japan | Hard | Jay Lapidus | 6\u20133, 6\u20130 |- |style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner | 3. | 1989 | Nagoya, Japan (2) | Hard | Jonathan Canter | 6\u20131, 6\u20133 |- |style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Winner | 4. | 1990 | Nagoya, Japan (3) | Hard | Brian Garrow | 6\u20132, 6\u20134 |} ===Doubles: 1 (1 runner-up)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% !width=75|Outcome !width=20|No. !width=50|Year !width=150|Tournament !width=65|Surface !width=160|Partner !width=160|Opponents !width=100|Score |- |style=\"background:#FFA07A;\"|Runner- up | 1. | 1989 | Nagoya, Japan | Hard | Jonathan Canter | John Letts Bruce Man-Son-Hing | 5\u20137, 6\u20134, 0\u20136 |} ==Career highlights== *1979 \u2013 Wimbledon and French Open junior singles champion. *1981 \u2013 Reached the quarterfinals of the US Open. *1981 \u2013 Won his first ATP singles title in Manila. *1986 \u2013 Reached the quarterfinals of Wimbledon. *1986 \u2013 Won the Japan Open. *1987 \u2013 Reached the quarterfinals of 1987 South Australian Open and 1987 Heineken Open in back to back weeks in January. *1987 \u2013 Reached the quarterfinals of the US Open. *1987 \u2013 Member of the Indian team which reached the final of the Davis Cup.
