He was the allsherjargo\u00f0i of the Althing (assembly of free men) from 1197 to 1234. He inherited the office from his father Gu\u00f0mundr gr\u00edss \u00c1mundason, who was the descendant of Ing\u00f3lfur Arnarson, one of the first Viking settlers on the island. Magn\u00fas was the next-to-last allsherjargo\u00f0i before the dissolution of the Icelandic Commonwealth in 1262. He had no offspring, and contemporary sources only offer conjectures about his successor, possibly \u00c1rni \u00f3rei\u00f0a Magn\u00fasson, nephew of Gu\u00f0mundr gr\u00edss \u00c1mundason and son-in-law of the skald Snorri Sturluson. In fact, the sagas narrate that Sturluson caused Magn\u00fas's fall: during his first term as lawspeaker, Sturluson convinced the Althing to outlaw (sk\u00f3garma\u00f0r) Magn\u00fas. Despite his title, Magn\u00fas was not one of Iceland's more powerful citizens. According to konungsann\u00e1ll, Magn\u00fas obtained the support of the clans Haukd\u00e6lir, Oddaverjar and Sv\u00ednfellingar to become bishop of Sk\u00e1lholt in 1236, but he did not obtain the Apostolic Blessing since he did not fulfil the requirements for the position; his candidacy was approved neither by the Norwegian archdiocese nor the Pope. == References == == Literature == * Bj\u00f6rn \u00deorsteinsson: \u00cdslensk mi\u00f0aldasaga , 2. \u00fatg., S\u00f6guf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, Rvk. 1980 * Byock, Jesse L .: Medieval Iceland: Society, Sagas, and Power, University of California Press, US, 1990 * Gunnar Karlsson: \"Fr\u00e1 \u00fej\u00f3\u00f0veldi til konungsr\u00edkis\", \"Saga \u00cdslands II\", ed.
