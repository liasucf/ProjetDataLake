But Tropical Storm Allison's rains return, quickly turning a normal day into a nightmare. As floodwaters inundate the lower levels of the hospital, a brilliant young surgeon, Dr. Foster (Rick Schroder), makes the decision to move the patients to safer ground, including Amelia and Gary, a young couple whose premature baby, Jeremy, is struggling for his life when all the life-support equipment shuts off in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; also a girl and her mother, severely hurt in a car accident. With the resourceful thinking of Chuck Whortle (Kris Kristofferson), chief of Harris County Emergency Management, the hospital staff and volunteers race against the clock to get all patients to safety. It took 14 hours to safely evacuate 600 patients from the hospital, hence the title of the movie. ==Cast== * JoBeth Williams ... Jeanette Makins * Kris Kristofferson ...
