    "text": "Bubacarr Bah is a Gambian mathematician and chair of Data Science at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS).Bubacarr Bah's He is an assistant professor at Stellenbosch University and a member of the Google advanced technology external advisory council. == Early life and education == Bah was born in The Gambia. He studied mathematics at the University of the Gambia and graduated summa cum laude in 2004. He was awarded a Master of Science (MSc) degree from the University of Oxford, where he studied mathematical modelling as a postgraduate student of Wolfson College, Oxford. He joined the University of Edinburgh, where his PhD investigated compressed sensing and was supervised by . He was a member of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM) student chapter. His work on Gaussian matrices was awarded the SIAM best student paper. == Research and career == Between 2012 and 2014 Bah was a postdoctoral researcher at the \u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne, where he continued his investigations into compressed sensing. He was a member of the Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems. In 2014 Bah joined the University of Texas at Austin, where he worked on signal processing, machine learning and sampling strategies in high- dimensional data. He developed a matrix for dimensionality reduction that uses bi-Lipschitz embeddings, which can exploit data redundancy. In 2016 Bah was appointed the German Chair in Mathematics at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), which is supported by the Humboldt Foundation. The position was welcomed by the AIMS community, who believe Africa needs better data science infrastructure. Bah organised the software engineering for Applied Mathematical Sciences workshop, which teaches basic programming and research programming. He is responsible for connecting the AIMS in South Africa with central Africa and German universities. As of 2019, the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation support five chairs at AIMS centres. He holds a joint position at Stellenbosch University, where he works on information theory and deep learning. In March 2019 Bah was appointed to the Google advanced technology external advisory council, a collection of experts who will consider the artificial intelligence (AI) principles of Google. == References == Category:Gambian mathematicians Category:Alumni of the University of Edinburgh Category:Alumni of the University of Oxford Category:Gambian academics Category:Living people Category:Stellenbosch University faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
