Introduced in 1915 to meet British military requirements during World War I, it was used to power the Handley Page Type O bombers and a number of other military aircraft. The Eagle was the first engine to make a non-stop trans-Atlantic crossing by aeroplane when two Eagles powered the converted Vickers Vimy bomber on the Transatlantic flight of Alcock and Brown in June 1919. ==Background== At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914, the Royal Aircraft Factory asked Rolls-Royce to develop a new air-cooled engine. Despite initial reluctance they agreed on condition that it be cooled by water rather than air, as this was the company's area of expertise.Pugh 2001, p.71. ==Design and development== Development of the new 20 litre engine was led by Henry Royce from his home in Kent. Based initially on the 7.4 litre 40/50 Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost engine, and drawing also on the design of a 7.2 litre Daimler DF80 aero engine used in a 1913 Grand Prix Mercedes that had been acquired,Taulbut 2011, p.41. the power was increased by doubling the number of cylinders to twelve and increasing their stroke to , although their bore remained at of the 40/50. The engine was also run faster, and an epicyclic reduction gear was designed to keep the propeller speed below 1,100 rpm. To reduce inertia and improve performance the valvetrain design was changed from sidevalves to a SOHC design,Pugh 2001, p.72. closely following the original \"side-slot\" rocker arm design philosophy used on the contemporary German Mercedes D.I, Mercedes D.II and Mercedes D.III straight-six aviation powerplants. Rolls-Royce Eagle engines at Derby in 1919 On 3 January 1915 the Admiralty ordered twenty-five of the new engines. The Eagle first ran on a test bed at Rolls-Royce's Derby works in February 1915, producing at 1,600 rpm. This was quickly increased to 1,800, then in August 1915 to 2,000 rpm where it produced . After further testing, it was decided to approve the engine for production at 1,800 rpm and ; 1,900 rpm was allowed for short periods. The engine first flew on a Handley Page O/100 bomber in December 1915, the first flight of a Rolls-Royce aero engine. The Eagle was developed further during 1916 and 1917, with power being progressively increased from to , followed by , and then , and finally by February 1918 by which time eight Eagle variants had been produced.Note; all horsepower ratings are for continuous power at 1,800 rpm. Higher powers at 2,000 rpm were available for periods of five minutes. \"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines \u2013 5th edition\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, P.186 Throughout World War I Rolls- Royce struggled to build Eagles in the quantities required by the War Office, but the company resisted pressure to license other manufacturers to produce it, fearing that the engine's much admired quality would risk being compromised.Pugh 2001, p.79-86. After the War, a Mark IX version of the Eagle was developed for civilian use. Production continued until 1928, and in total 4,681 Eagle engines were built.Lumsden 2003, p.183. Time between overhaul (TBO) for later Eagles was around 100-180 hours.\"World Encyclopedia of Aero Engines - 5th edition\" by Bill Gunston, Sutton Publishing, 2006, p.186 ==Variants== Note:List from Lumsden, alternate official designations in italics. ;Eagle I (Rolls-Royce 250 hp Mk I) :(1915), 225 hp, 104 engines produced in both left and right hand tractor versions. ;Eagle II (Rolls-Royce 250 hp Mk II) :(1916), 250 hp, 36 built at Derby. ;Eagle III (Rolls-Royce 250 hp Mk III) :(1917-1927), 250 hp, increased compression ratio (4.9:1), strengthened pistons. 110 built at Derby. ;Eagle IV (Rolls-Royce 250 hp Mk IV) :(1916-17), 270/286 hp, 36 built at Derby.
