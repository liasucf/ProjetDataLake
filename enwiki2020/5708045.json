    "text": "The 1935\u201336 season was the 61st season of competitive football in England. Sunderland AFC won the league, and in doing so they remain the last team to win the English League while wearing striped jerseys. They also equalled the record of six titles won by Aston Villa. It remains the last season that Sunderland would win the title. Aston Villa and Blackburn Rovers were relegated from the 1st Division and therefore became the last two of the founder members of the Football League to lose top flight status for the first time. ==Diary of the season== * 16 November 1935: Table-toppers Sunderland beat Brentford 5\u20131, while George Camsell is among the goalscorers for Middlesbrough as they thrash Blackburn Rovers 6\u20131. * 27 February 1936: The weekend fixture list is not announced until Thursday evening (for games involving teams a long distance apart) and Friday evening for all others in an attempt to thwart the football pools companies' ability to print their coupons as part of the Pools War. * 9 March 1936: The Pools War ends and the League starts publishing the fixtures earlier in advance again. ==Honours== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"width:15em\"|Competition!!style=\"width:15em\"|Winner!!style=\"width:15em\"|Runner- up |- |First Division||Sunderland (6*)||Derby County |- |Second Division||Manchester United||Charlton Athletic |- |Third Division North||Chesterfield||Chester City |- |Third Division South||Coventry City||Luton Town |- |FA Cup||Arsenal (2)||Sheffield United |- |Charity Shield||Sunderland||Arsenal |- |Home Championship|||| |} Notes = Number in parentheses is the times that club has won that honour. * indicates new record for competition ==Football League== ===First Division=== ===Second Division=== ===Third Division North=== ===Third Division South=== ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *W.
