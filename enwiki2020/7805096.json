    "text": "Manager without portfolio is a manager in title only, that is, one who manages a function, but does not manage a staff. The term often applies to those holding managerial titles in small companies. E.g., the marketing manager or human resources manager in a small enterprise may be wholly responsible for the marketing or human resources functions respectively, but may not in fact manage any staff. It may also be applied to one granted a title for purposes of prestige, or for a lame duck or \"short-timer\" (one whose tenure is scheduled to end soon, and whose authority is consequently in transition to someone else). Derived by analogy from the British term Minister without Portfolio. Category:Management occupations ",
