The larvae feed on Limoniastrum species, including Limoniastrum guyonianum. ==Etymology== The species is named for the curious resemblance of the larva to a young larva of one of the Sphingidae, the protruding tubercle above the head having exactly the appearance of an anal horn, while the attenuation of the body posteriorly represents the form of a Sphingid larva in the reverse position. ==References== Category:Agdistinae Category:Moths described in 1907 ",
