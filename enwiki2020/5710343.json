    "text": "\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" is a song by Irish girl group B*Witched. It was released as the fourth single from their self-titled debut studio album. Like the other three singles from the album, \"Blame It on the Weatherman\" reached number one on the UK Singles Chart. With this, B*Witched became the first act ever to have their first four singles all debut at number one in the UK (a record since equalled and bettered by fellow Irish band Westlife) and today remain the only girl group to do so, though it plummeted to number nine the following week and remains one of the biggest drops from number one in the UK. Despite its success in the UK, it slightly underperformed in Ireland, reaching number eight. It became the group's first single to miss the top ten in New Zealand. The single was certified Silver in the UK with sales of 200,000. The song was eventually included on the 2003 Charmed soundtrack as a bonus track, having been featured in the season 5 episode \"A Witch's Tail (Part 2)\". ==Music video== The music video was directed by Michael Geoghegan. It features the band floating on a large upside-down articulated lorry through the flooded city of London, picking up numerous floating items from the water and also rescuing a puppy. For the video, they wore a mixture of their trademark denim and leather, designed by Scott Henshall, who then dressed them for their Royal Variety Performance in 1999. ==Track listings== UK CD1 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" - 3:33 #\"Together We'll Be Fine\" - 3:18 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Orchestral Version] - 3:31 International CD Single & UK CD2 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Original] - 3:33 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Amen Club Mix] - 7:10 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Chicane Vocal Edit] - 5:01 UK Cassette #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" - 3:33 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Orchestral Version] - 3:31 UK 12\" Vinyl Promo #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Amen Club Mix] - 7:10 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Chicane Vocal Remix] - 7:06 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Chicane Vocal Edit] - 5:01 US 12\" Vinyl Promo #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" (Original version) - 3:33 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Amen UK Club Mix] - 7:10 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Chicane Vocal Edit] - 5:01 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Chicane Vocal Remix] - 7:06 #\"Blame It on the Weatherman\" [Orchestral Version] - 3:31 Limited Edition CD Single #Blame It On The Weatherman #Together We'll Be Fine #Blame It On The Weatherman [Orchestral Version] #Blame It On The Weatherman [Amen Club Mix] #Blame It On The Weatherman [Chicane Vocal Edit] ==Charts== {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Chart (1999) !Peak position |- |- |- |- !scope=\"row\"|Europe (Eurochart Hot 100) |9 |- |- |- |- |- |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1999 singles Category:B*Witched songs Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Pop ballads Category:Songs written by Tracy Ackerman Category:Songs written by Ray Hedges Category:Epic Records singles Category:1998 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Ray Hedges Category:Songs written by Martin Brannigan Category:1990s ballads Category:Music videos directed by Michael Geoghegan ",
