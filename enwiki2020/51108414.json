The group was led by Abu Wardah (also known as Santoso) until he was killed by Indonesian police on 18 July 2016. The group has pledged allegiance to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. MIT was proscribed by the United Nations Security Council under the Al-Qaeda Sanctions Committee on 29 September 2015. The US Department of State has designated MIT as a terrorist organisation. MIT has largely carried out its operations within Sulawesi but has threatened to attack targets across Indonesia. The group's operations have typically avoided operations that would cause civilian casualties, but was reportedly involved in clashes between Muslims and Christians in Maluku province between 1999 and 2002. ==Uyghur links== Turkish passports were used by Uyghurs who were seeking to contact Mujahidin Indonesia Timor. ISIS/ISIL aligned Uyghurs have been traveling to Indonesia to participate in terrorist attacks against Shia, Christians, and the Indonesian government, during a terrorist attack in Central Sulawesi, one Uighur, Farouk, was killed by Indonesian security personnel in November, and another Uighur terrorist, Alli, was arrested for plotting a terrorist attack.

Indonesia arrested a possible suicide bomber named Ali, a Uyghur, on 24 December 2015. In Sulawesi on Tuesday 15 March 2016 two pro-ISIS Uyghurs in Indonesia were liquidated by Indonesian government forces. The Indonesians used bullets to kill them.

The \"Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan B\u00fclteni Haber Ajans\u0131\" slammed the Indonesian government for hunting down four Uyghurs who illegally entered the country to join \"Do\u011fu Endonezya M\u00fccahitleri\" and accused the Indonesian government of attacking Muslims. A Uighur accused of terror ties was killed in Sulawesi by the Indonesian security forces on 24 April, for which the \"Do\u011fu T\u00fcrkistan B\u00fclteni Haber Ajans\u0131\" condemned the Indonesian government.
