Christopher Ross McNab (born March 10, 1980) is an author, computer hacker, and founder of AlphaSOC (a software company that identifies malware, insider threats, and cyberweapons within computer networks through DNS analytics). McNab is best known for his Network Security Assessment books, which detail practical penetration testing tactics that can be adopted to evaluate the security of networks in-line with CESG CHECK, PCI DSS, and NIST SP 800-115 standards. During 2012 and 2013, McNab undertook incident response work on behalf of organizations in California and Nevada targeted by Alexsey Belan (currently on the FBI Cyber\u2019s Most Wanted list). In 2011, McNab worked closely with the Attorney General of Guatemala under a United States Agency for International Development (USAID) project to secure the computer networks that underpin the legal system within the country. == Bibliography == * * * ==References== Category:Living people Category:1980 births Category:British writers ",
