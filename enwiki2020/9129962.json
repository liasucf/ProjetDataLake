The organization is dedicated to using the arts, particularly music, to build community, foster cultural understanding, and encourage self- expression among urban youth in the neighborhood. ZUMIX works primarily with low-income or at-risk youth, ranging from ages eight to eighteen. ==History== ZUMIX was founded in 1991 as a small-scale operation run out of the homes of co-founders Madeleine Steczynski and Bob Grove. It was founded as their response to a growing number of homicides among youth in Boston. Addressing the problems of escalating violence, substance abuse, and mortality, the organization sought to provide alternative ways for youth to deal with their issues. Currently, they serve approximately 500 youth per year in after-school and summer programs, plus an additional 500 youth through in-school partnerships with East Boston High School and the Mario Umana Academy. ==Programs== block party 2016 ZUMIX offers programs in Instrumental Music, Songwriting & Performance, Music Technology, and Radio.
