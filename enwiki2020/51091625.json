    "text": "Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In is a book by U.S. Senator from Vermont Bernie Sanders, published by Thomas Dunne Books in November 2016. It was released on November 15, 2016, a week after the election of Donald Trump. The book was written in the context of Sanders's 2016 presidential campaign and aimed to explain some of its rationale. ==Contents== In the book, Sanders sets out his position on climate change, free college tuition, income inequality, closing the gender wage gap and defeating Donald Trump while campaigning for Hillary Clinton during the last three months leading to the 2016 presidential election. Sanders discusses how his presidential campaign was considered by the political establishment and the media to be a \"fringe\" campaign and something not to be taken seriously. He discusses his initial struggle as being an \"Independent senator from a small state with little name recognition\". The memoir also covers how his campaign had no money, no political organization, and it was taking on the entire Democratic Party establishment. In Our Revolution, Sanders shares his personal experiences from the campaign trail, recounting the details of his primary fight and the people who made it possible. He outlines a progressive economic, environmental, racial, and social justice agenda that will create jobs, raise wages, protect the environment, and provide health care for all\u2014and ultimately transform our country and our world for the better. ==Reception== Upon its release, it was on The New York Times Best Seller List at number 3. John R. Coyne Jr. gave the memoir a positive review for The Washington Times saying that \"For starters, it tells us who this man who energized so many young people really is \u2014 an enthusiastic young socialist trapped in an old curmudgeon's body, his ideas basically just as fresh to him today as when he left his native Brooklyn\". David Weigel of The Denver Post said that the memoir was \"like a sitcom character who gets beaned on the head and hallucinates an angel \u2014 or a talking dog, or a 75-year-old senator from Vermont \u2014 spinning lessons about what really matters in life\". Sanders and Mark Ruffalo were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. == See also == * Stronger Together, Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign book * Crippled America, Donald Trump's 2016 campaign book published in 2015 * Our Revolution, a PAC set up to support Sanders's policies and campaign for progressive candidates ==References== Category:2016 non-fiction books Category:American political books Category:Books about the 2016 United States presidential election Category:Books by Bernie Sanders Category:English-language books Category:St. Martin's Press ",
