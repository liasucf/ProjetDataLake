It is the second-highesthttp://www.countryhighpoints.com/serbia- midzor/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTdeVLDxMMY&t;=3s (after Velika Rudoka) mountain in Kosovo, or the second-highest mountain of Serbia, according to the Serbian government position over its status. It has an elevation of above sea level. \u0110eravica is in the western part of Kosovo, in the municipality of Junik. Before the 20th century, \u0110eravica used to be called Kalu\u0111erovica (Kalu\u0111er means monk in Serbian). ==Features== \u0110eravica is somewhat different from the rest of the Prokletije mountains in its lack of the stony, limestone texture the other mountains in Prokletije have. Many large and small glacial lakes can be found near the summit. The largest of the lakes is \u0110eravica Lake, which is just under the summit and is the origin of the Erenik river. \u0110eravica and the Prokletije are mostly known for the growth of chestnuts. There are also wild strawberries growing in \u0110eravica during the summer. ==Geography== ===Nearby settlements=== *De\u00e7an *Junik *Pe\u0107 *Belaje *Kr\u0161i i \u0106enit *Kr\u0161i i Zi *Veliko Jezero *Crveno Jezero ===Nearby peaks=== * Kumulore * Tropojske Plo\u010dice * Guri i Gjate * Maja e Ram Aru\u0107it * Ljogi i Prel\u0161 ===Cliffs=== * Biga Tamas * Kr\u0161i i \u0106enit * Kumulore * Kr\u0161i i Zi * Guri i Mal * Gurt e Ljove * Brehov * Minarja ===Nearby springs=== * Kroni Tedel * Kroni Gusija * Kroni i Lizit * Kroni i Nuses * Gura e Hasanags * Kroni i Metes * Gura e Mir * Kroni i Rasave * Kroni i Smajlit * Gura i \u0106ur\u0161is * Gura Ho\u0111s * Kroni i Mir ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== *Summitpost, \u0110eravica * *Peakbagger, \u0110eravica Category:Mountains of Kosovo Category:Prokletije Category:Two- thousanders of Kosovo Category:Highest points of countries ",
