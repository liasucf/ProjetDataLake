He joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and rejoined the front lines in 1943. Altunin received the title Hero of the Soviet Union in 1944, having organized the established of a foothold across the Vistula during the Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive and led his men in tenaciously fighting off the German counterattack while distracting them from the Soviet troops' main landing point.
