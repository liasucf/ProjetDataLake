    "text": "Robert Cleveland Johnson (May 4, 1920 \u2013 December 31, 1993), known professionally as Bob Johnson, was an American actor and voice actor who played supporting roles on series television and in films from the late 1950s until a few years before his death. Johnson is probably best known as the \"voice behind the scenes\", who gave Special Agents Dan Briggs and Jim Phelps their recorded mission briefings on both incarnations of the Mission: Impossible television series. The \"Voice\" was never identified by name, title or position, and was only heard in recordings, but nevertheless became one of the most iconic features of the show. Prior to his work on Mission: Impossible, Johnson frequently provided the voices of numerous alien creatures on The Outer Limits. He was uncredited for all, except for his work as the alien \"Senator\" in the episode \"Fun And Games\". Johnson voiced Clegg Hoyt's role as Pitcairn, the transporter chief of the fictitious USS Enterprise, in the first pilot episode, \"The Cage\", of the original NBC science fiction series Star Trek, with Jeffrey Hunter in the starring role. \"The Cage\" was subsequently broadcast as the two-part episode, \"The Menagerie.\" Johnson also voiced several other small, uncredited roles during the series' three year run. He may have been involved in English-language dubbing on lesser-known spaghetti westerns. Johnson was born in Portland, Oregon, and died at the age of seventy-three in Molokai, Hawaii. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1920 births Category:1993 deaths Category:American male film actors Category:American male television actors Category:American male voice actors Category:Male actors from Portland, Oregon Category:20th-century American male actors ",
