    "text": "The Miss Virginia competition is a scholarship pageant for women, with the titleholder representing Virginia in the Miss America pageant. The competition was founded in 1953 as a scholarship contest for young women, although women had represented Virginia in the Miss America pageant since the 1930s. Four Miss Virginia winners have gone on to be crowned Miss America, including former national titleholder Caressa Cameron. To compete in the Miss Virginia pageant, a contestant must first win one of many local competitions. Contestants may compete at the local and state level more than once, but having won a state title may only compete in the national Miss America competition one time. The state pageant was formerly held in Roanoke, Virginia at the Roanoke Civic Center in June or July, and moved to Liberty University in Lynchburg in June 2018. During her reign, Miss Virginia travels over 40,000 miles across the state making appearances to further her social impact initiative, visit schools, and for the Miss America Organization's national Children's Miracle Network campaign. Dorcas Campbell from Farfield was Miss Virginia of 1963, won many singing contests, and was a very talented opera singer. Kristi Lauren Glakas, Miss Virginia 2005, is one of only seven women who have competed in the Miss America, Miss Teen USA, and Miss USA competitions. She was Miss Virginia Teen USA 1999 and Miss Virginia USA 2004, placing in the top ten at Miss Teen USA 1999 and was a non-finalist at Miss USA 2004. Two other Miss Virginia titleholders later competed in the Miss USA pageant: Jennifer Pitts was Miss Virginia USA 2005 and Shannon DePuy was Miss Florida USA 1995. Camille Schrier, a native of Newtown, PA, was crowned Miss Virginia 2019 on June 22, 2019 at Liberty University's Center for Music & Worship in Lynchburg, Virginia. She became Miss America 2020 on December 19, 2019. The current Miss Virginia is Dot Kelly of Hampton, Virginia, who was Schrier's first runner up and holds the title of Miss Virginia 2019 and 2020 due to the pandemic. ==Gallery of past titleholders== File:Hannah Kiefer.jpg|Hannah Kiefer, Miss Virginia 2007 File:Tara Miss Virginia 2008 111.JPG|Tara Wheeler, Miss Virginia 2008 File:Caressa Cameron.jpg|Caressa Cameron, Miss Virginia 2009 and Miss America 2010 File:Chinah Helmandollar headshot.png|Chinah Helmandollar, Miss Virginia 2009 File:Desiree Williams.jpg|Desiree Williams, Miss Virginia 2013 (when she was Miss Virginia USA 2016) ==Results summary== The following is a visual summary of the past results of Miss Virginia titleholders at the national Miss America pageants/competitions.
