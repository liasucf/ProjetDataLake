Despite a couple of battling ties, the Pirates didn't pick up their first victory until the first weekend of June, with a 3\u20132 win at home over Nashville Metros. The Palm Beach Pumas were defeated 6\u20130, 7\u20130 and 5\u20130 in their three games in June. C.D. Harris and Bruno Concei\u00e7\u00e3o scored 12 of the Pirates' 18 goals against the Pumas between them, and helped the team enjoy a seven-game unbeaten streak which included a 1\u20130 win over Bradenton Academics, and an unexpected 3\u20130 victory over the Central Florida Kraze.
