    "text": "Asparagopsis taxiformis, (limu kohu) formerly A. sanfordiana, is a species of red alga, with cosmopolitan distribution in tropical to warm temperate waters. == Lifecycle == Like many red algae, A. taxiformis has a haplodiplophasic lifecycle, with each phase morphologically distinct. The species' haploid stage was initially described as Falkenbergia hillebrandii (Bornet) Falkenberg 1901 because it was thought to be a separate species. == Culinary uses == poke.|alt=|left Asparagopsis is one of the most popular types of limu. in the cuisine of Hawaii, it is principally a condiment. It is known as Limu kohu in the Hawaiian language meaning \"pleasing seaweed\". Limu kohu is a traditional ingredient in poke. The essential oil of limu kohu is 80% bromoform (tri- bromo-methane) by weight, and includes many other bromine- and iodine- containing organic compounds. ==Methane emissions reduction in cattle== In 2014, researchers at CSIRO and James Cook University demonstrated that feeding ruminants a diet consisting of 1-2% percent red seaweed reduced their methane emissions by over 90 percent. Of 20 types of seaweed tested, A. taxiformis showed the most promise, with nearly 99 percent effectiveness. The findings spurred interest from leading academic and trade organizations to further investigate its effects on ruminant animal production. Some findings of research on these effects have been that the dichloromethane extract (found in A. taxiformis) was the most potent bioactive, reducing methane production by 79%. Other bioactives found were bromoform, dibromochloromethane, bromochloroacetic acid and dibromoacetic acid.Identification of bioactives from the red seaweed Asparagopsis taxiformis that promote antimethanogenic activity in vitro Supply from wild harvest is not expected to be adequate to support broad adoption. A. taxiformis has yet to be commercially farmed at scale. A research/development initiative called Greener Grazing is seeking to close the life cycle of A. taxiformis and demonstrate ocean based grow-out. A startup out of KTH Royal Institute of Technology; Volta Greentech and Symbrosia from Yale University, are both working to grow A. taxiformis. Symbrosia is looking to integrate the cultivation with Whiteleg shrimp on land, using a patent-pending technology. Sea-based cultivation has been proposed as a path to scale production and \"drive the cost down so it can be used by beef and dairy farmers around the world\". ==See also== *Limu (algae) ==References== ==External links== * Edible Limu of Hawaii *Greener Grazing Category:Bonnemaisoniales Category:Algae of Hawaii Category:Edible algae Category:Hawaiian cuisine Category:Sea vegetables Category:Emissions reduction ",
