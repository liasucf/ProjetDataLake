The original power was only 250 watts and the studios were located at 416 West Douglas Avenue. The station was a network affiliate of the Mutual Broadcasting System and later the Don Lee Network. In 1954, KAKE 1240 added a TV station, Channel 10 KAKE- TV. It started as both an NBC and ABC affiliate, eventually carrying ABC programming full time. The AM station got an increase to 1,000 watts by day, remaining at 250 watts at night.Broadcasting Yearbook 1969 page B-67 In the 1970s, KAKE switched to a middle of the road (MOR) format of popular music, news and talk. KAKE was affiliated with the ABC Entertainment Network.Broadcasting Yearbook 1980 page C-88 ===KAKZ and KRZZ=== In 1979, the TV station was sold to the Chronicle Publishing Company, parent company of the San Francisco Chronicle. Channel 10 kept the KAKE-TV call sign, so AM 1240 had to slightly change its call letters to KAKZ. By the 1980s, as music listening to AM radio shifted to FM, AM 1240 added more talk shows. In 1985, the call sign changed to KRZZ. ===KNSS=== By the 1990s, the station became all-talk. It added shows from the ABC Talk Radio Network and NBC Talknet.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 1995 page B-160 To reinforce its commitment to news and talk, the call sign switched to KNSS. The call letters referred to KaNSaS and NewS Station. In 2000, Entercom acquired both 1240 KNSS and another AM station in Wichita, 1330 KFH.Broadcasting & Cable Yearbook 2005 page D-222 With two AM talk stations in the same city, Entercom decided to make some adjustments. ===Switching KFH and KNSS=== On August 30, 2004, the KFH call sign was relocated from AM 1330 to AM 1240. The KNSS call sign was relocated from AM 1240 to AM 1330. As KNSS, AM 1330 continued as a news-talk station. 1330 has a better signal, at 5,000 watts. 1240 by this time was broadcasting at 1,000 watts full time. KFH 1240 then became a hot talk station, carrying shows such as Don & Mike and Loveline. It shifted back to a more mainstream talk format in 2006. On May 9, 2011, KFH changed its format to all-sports, affiliating with ESPN Radio. Programming was also simulcast on 98.7 FM, also owned by Entercom. It switched its call sign to KFH-FM, giving sports listeners the option to hear sports talk and play by play on either AM or FM. ===New Studios and New FM Station=== In early 2015, Entercom moved its Wichita radio stations to the Ruffin Building at 9111 East Douglas. It was formerly the Pizza Hut corporate headquarters. KFH gave up its 50,000 watt FM simulcast on October 12, 2016. KFH-FM 98.7 then became KNSS-FM, simulcast the talk programming on 1330 KNSS.
