    "text": "Sharon Olds (born November 19, 1942) is an American poet. Olds has won the 2013 Pulitzer Prize in Poetry, the 1984 National Book Critics Circle Award, and the first San Francisco Poetry Center Award in 1980.San Francisco Poetry Center AwardSharon Olds : The Poetry Foundation She teaches creative writing at New York University.Sharon Olds, Faculty of CWP | NYU ==Early life== Sharon Olds was born on November 19, 1942, in San Francisco, California,Academy of American Poets but was brought up in Berkeley, California, along with her siblings. She was raised as a \"hellfire Calvinist\", as she describes it.Olds' Biog at Poetry Foundation Her father, like his before him, was an alcoholic who was often abusive to his children. In Olds' writing she often refers to the time (or possibly even times) when her father tied her to a chair.The Barclay Agency Olds' mother was often either unable or too afraid to come to the aid of her children. The strict religious environment in which Olds was raised had certain rules of censorship and restriction. Olds was not permitted to go to the movies and the family did not own a television. Olds once said she won a singing contest in church choir. \"[The prize] was a book of child martyrs who had been killed for their belief and died very politely.\" She liked fairy tales, and also read Nancy Drew and Life magazine. As for her own religious views and her exposure to religious literary art she says she was by nature \"a pagan and a pantheist\" and notes: \"I was in a church where there was both great literary art and bad literary art, the great art being psalms and the bad art being hymns. The four-beat was something that was just part of my consciousness from before I was born.\" She adds: \"I think I was about 15 when I conceived of myself as an atheist, but I think it was only very recently that I can really tell that there's nobody there with a copybook making marks against your name.\" Olds was sent east to Dana Hall School, an all-girls school for grades 6 to 12 in Wellesley, Massachusetts that boasts an impressive list of alumnae.Dana Hall School: Sharon Olds 1960 There she studied mostly English, History, and Creative Writing. Her favorite poets included William Shakespeare, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, and Edna St. Vincent Millay, but it was Allen Ginsberg's Howl and Other Poems that she carried in her purse through tenth grade. For her bachelor's degree Olds returned to California where she earned her BA at Stanford University in 1964. Following this Olds once again moved cross country to New York, where she earned her Ph.D. in English in 1972 from Columbia University. She wrote her doctoral dissertation on \"Emerson's Prosody\", because she appreciated the way he defied convention. ==Personal life== On March 23, 1968, she married Dr. David Douglas Olds in New York City and, in 1969, gave birth to the first of their two children. In 1997, after 29 years of marriage, they divorced, and Olds moved to New Hampshire, though she commutes to New York three days a week. There, she lives in the same Upper West Side apartment she has lived in for the past 40 years while working as a Professor at New York University. In New Hampshire she lives in Graylag Cabins in Pittsfield, with her partner of seven years, Carl Wallman, a former cattle breeder. In 2005, First Lady Laura Bush invited Olds to the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. Olds responded, declining the invitation in an open letter published in the October 10, 2005 issue of The Nation. The letter closes: > \"So many Americans who had felt pride in our country now feel anguish and > shame for the current regime of blood, wounds and fire. I thought of the > clean linens at your table, the shining knives and the flames of the > candles, and I could not stomach it\". ==Poetry== Following her PhD, Olds let go of an attachment to what she thought she 'knew about' poetic convention and began to write about her family, abuse, sex, focusing on the work not the audience. Olds has commented that she is more informed by the work of poets such as Galway Kinnell, Muriel Rukeyser and Gwendolyn Brooks than by confessional poets like Anne Sexton or Sylvia Plath. Plath, she comments \"was a great genius, with an IQ of at least double mine\" and while these women charted well the way of women in the world she says \"their steps were not steps I wanted to put my feet in.\" When Olds first sent her poetry to a literary magazine she received a reply saying,\"This is a literary magazine. If you wish to write about this sort of subject, may we suggest the Ladies' Home Journal. The true subjects of poetry are... male subjects, not your children.\" Olds eventually published her first collection, Satan Says, in 1980, at the age of 37. Satan Says sets up the sexual and bodily candour that would run through much of her work. In \"The Sisters of Sexual Treasure\" she writes, As soon as my sister and I got out of our mother's house, all we wanted to do was fuck, obliterate her tiny sparrow body and narrow grasshopper legs. The collection is divided into four sections: \"Daughter\", \"Woman\", \"Mother\", \"Journeys\". These titles echo the familial influence that is prevalent in much of Olds' work. The Dead and the Living was published in February 1984. This collection is divided into two sections, \"Poems for the Dead\" and \"Poems for the Living\". The first section begins with poems about global injustices. These injustices include the Turkish Massacre of the Armenians during WWI, the 1921 Tulsa Race Riot, the reign of Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi, and even the death of Marilyn Monroe. Olds' book The Wellspring (1996), shares with her previous work the use of raw language and startling images to convey truths about domestic and political violence and family relationships. A reviewer for The New York Times hailed her poetry for its vision: \"Like Whitman, Ms. Olds sings the body in celebration of a power stronger than political oppression.\" Alicia Ostriker noted Olds traces the \"erotics of family love and pain.\" Ostriker continues: \"In later collections, [Olds] writes of an abusive childhood, in which miserably married parents bully and punish and silence her. She writes, too, of her mother's apology \"after 37 years\", a moment when \"The sky seemed to be splintering, like a window/ someone is bursting into or out of\" Olds' work is anthologized in over 100 collections, ranging from literary/poetry textbooks to special collections. Her poetry has been translated into seven languages for international publications. She has been published in Beloit Poetry Journal. She was the New York State Poet Laureate for 1998\u20132000.Sharon Olds Stag's Leap was published in 2013. The poems were written in 1997, following the divorce from her husband of 29 years. The poems focus on her husband, and even sometimes his mistress. The collection won the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry. She is the first American woman to win this award. It also won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry. ==Women's Movement== Olds did not participate in the Women's Movement at first, but she says, \"My first child was born in 1969. In 1968 the Women's Movement in New York City\u2014especially among a lot of women I knew\u2014was very alive. I had these strong ambitions to enter the bourgeoisie if I could. I wasn't a radical at all. But I do remember understanding that I had never questioned that men had all the important jobs. And that was shocking\u2014well, I was twenty years old! I'd never thought, \"Oh, where's the woman bus driver?\" So there's another subject\u2014which was what it felt like to be a woman in the world.\"Advice to Young Poets: Sharon Olds in Conversation ==Honors and awards== * 1978 Creative Artists Public Service GrantOLDS, Sharon * 1978 Madeline Sadin Award, New York QuarterlyIssue 22 * 1979 Younger Poets Award, Poetry Miscellany * 1980 Satan Says inaugural San Francisco Poetry Center Award. * 1981\u20131982 Guggenheim Fellowship, John Simon Guggenheim Memorial FoundationSharon Olds Guggenheim Fellowship Member Page * 1982\u20131983 National Endowment for the Arts FellowshipCreative Writing Fellowship Winners and National Awards * 1983 The Dead and the Living Lamont Poetry Prize, and the National Book Critics Circle Award. * 1992 The Father, shortlisted for the T.
