He was born in Edo Castle during the year of the dragon (tatsu), and as a child his name was Tatsuchiyo (\u8fb0\u5343\u4ee3). His mother was , a concubine of Ieyasu. Ieyasu sent the boy to live with a vassal, Minagawa Hiroteru, daimy\u014d of the Minagawa Domain in Shimotsuke Province. ==Biography== Matsudaira Tadateru's grave, at Teishoin in Suwa, NaganoIn 1599, Ieyasu granted him a fief in Musashi Province, and increased his holdings in 1602 and 1603 with transfers first to Shim\u014dsa and then to Shinano Provinces. Tadateru married Irohahime, the first daughter of Date Masamune, in 1606. In 1610, Tadateru became daimyo of Takada in Echigo Province. He had interests in martial arts, tea, and foreign intercourse. It is said that he was baptized a Christian. Ieyasu regarded Masamune as a dangerous being. Therefore, Tadateru was treated coldly by the shogunate. He was assigned to remain in Edo during the Winter Campaign of the Siege of Osaka (1614). He participated in the Summer Campaign (1615), but his older brother, the then sh\u014dgun Tokugawa Hidetada, relieved him of command and exiled him to Ise, then Hida, and finally Shinano Province, where he remained until his death. Tadateru was posthumously pardoned in 1984 by Tokugawa Tsunenari, the head of the former shogunal house. ==In popular culture== A 1987 television show Dokuganry\u016b Masamune starring Hiroyuki Sanada dramatized the life of Matsudaira Tadateru. ==Family== * Father: Tokugawa Ieyasu * Mother: Lady Chaa * Adopted Father: Matsudaira Yasutada (1546\u20131618) * Wife: Irohahime * Concubine: Otake no Kata * Children: ** Tokumatsu (1614-1632) by Otake ** Gotakehime by Otake == External links== *Matsudaira Tadateru Suwa City Web site (in Japanese) |- |- |- Category:1592 births Category:1683 deaths Category:Daimyo Category:Nagasawa- Matsudaira clan Category:Tokugawa clan ",
