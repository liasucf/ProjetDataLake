Grandhalaya Sarvaswam ==Publication History== Prior to the publication of Grandhalaya Sarvaswam, the library community, those who work for the library- related issues had to rely on other journals to publish their articles, news, opinions. So the Andhra Desa Library Association launched its own magazine as quarterly in 1915, which was published as a bimonthly journal two years later. The Association began publishing the periodical as a monthly magazine after Volume 6. The same periodical was stopped for a while in mid-1921 and started again in July 1928 as a monthly. This library periodical publication though was stopped between the years 1930\u201333, could restore it in 1934, and complete 11 volumes. Although the publication encountered some fluctuations, the Grandhalaya Sarvaswam was reintroduced due to the pioneering efforts of the father of the library movement, Ayyanki Venkata Ramanaiah, from January 1948 and is still being published uninterruptedly. Between September 1939 and October 1941, the magazine was published quarterly under the name Andhra Granthalayam in both Telugu (the languages of Andhra Pradesh) and English languages. Its publication in English has spread to other states and continents. Publication stalled in the wake of the dearth of paper in World War II. So, the Association has published the editions of the 23,24 Andhra Pradesh Grandhalaya Conferences held in Pedapalem of Tenali Taluka and Hindupur in Anantapur District, respectively, in the place of Grandhalaya Sarvaswam. Since the situation was improved, this library periodical publication was restored under the same name, has been publishing still now on a regular basis. ==Editors== Ayyanki Venkata Ramanaiah, Paturi Nagabhushanam, Gadde Ramamurthy served so far as the editors of this library periodical. Raavi Sarada, who is the daughter of Paturi Nagabhushanam, has continued to be the editor, printer, and publisher of the Sarwasavam periodical since the year 1989.
