    "text": "The University of Manitoba Libraries (UML) is the academic library system for the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It is located on Treaty 1 territory, the land of the Anishinaabeg, Cree, Oji-Cree, Dakota, and Dene Peoples, and on the homeland of the M\u00e9tis Nation. UML is made up of over a dozen libraries across two campuses \u2013 the Fort Garry, and Bannatyne campuses \u2013 as well as one virtual library, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority Virtual Library. It is also a member of the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities. == History == In 1885, the University of Manitoba acquired nearly 5,000 books from Alexander Kennedy Isbister, after the latter, who had died in 1883, bequeathed his books to the University in his last will and testament. This body of records, along with approximately $600 of scientific books, made up the bulk of the University's Library. At the time, the University of Manitoba rented space to house the books in the McIntyre Block in Winnipeg's Exchange District, as the University did not have a library to house the books, or a librarian to look after them. Unfortunately, in 1898, the entirety of the Library was lost in a fire that destroyed the McIntyre block. In 1904, the first official library was established at the University of Manitoba in the Department of Science. During this time, Professor Frank Allen, of the Faculty of Science, was appointed the honorary librarian and a new collection of books was accumulated through various sources, including the Royal Society of London, the British and Canadian Governments, the Smithsonian Institution, as well as through internal sources, such including professors and University associations, like the University of Manitoba Menorah Society. Professor Allen shortly after hired an assistance, Mrs. W.H. Thompson, who, in 1907, became the first University Librarian, Mrs. W.H. Thompson, was appointed, and an annual sum of money was set aside by the University Council for books and journals. In 1915, following the death of Mrs. Thompson, Alexandra Law took over the position for a six-month period. Following her term, Mr. Lowe, of the Botany Department, took over the position in the interim, until Mr. Franke E. Nuttal was hired in the fall of 1916. At this time, the Library held approximately sixteen thousand volumes, spread across multiple offices and departments. He held the position until 1937. Towards the end of his role as University Librarian, in 1935, a Carnegie Corporation grant allowed for the creation of a junior library in the University's administration building in 1935. At that time, the University had two campuses \u2013 Fort Garry and Broadway \u2013 and its library holdings were spread out across multiple buildings at either campus. In the early 1950s, these libraries were collectively staffed by twenty-two people and held approximately 150,000 volumes and acquired on average 6,000 volumes per year. Study spaces were increasingly difficult to find, particularly during exam time when \"standing room only was the rule in the libraries.\" To support the growing needs of the University, and in celebration of the University's seventy-fifth anniversary in 1952, a new central library on the Fort Garry campus was constructed. In honour of its Head Librarian, Julie Annette Elizabeth Dafoe (daughter of John W. Dafoe), the new library bared her name: the Elizabeth Dafoe Library. The Library acquired its one-millionth volume in 1976, and in 1997, it would acquire its two-millionth book: Voyages and Travels of an Indian Interpreter and Trader, authored by John Long. Today, the University of Manitoba Libraries include over a dozen libraries serving its various faculties and departments: * Albert D. Cohen Management Library * Architecture/Fine Arts Library * Donald W. Craik Engineering Library * E.K. Williams Law Library * Eckhardt-Gramatt\u00e9 Music Library * Elizabeth Dafoe Library (including the Archives & Special Collections department) serves the faculties of Arts (namely the Humanities and Social Sciences), Social Work, Environment, Earth and Resources, Kinesiology and Recreation management, Nursing, and Education. * Dr. H. Drake Library (St. Paul's College) * Sciences and Technology Library * St. John's College Library * William R. Newman Library (an Agriculture Library dedicated in 1998) * Neil John Maclean Health Sciences Library * WRHA Virtual Library. == Services == UML supports research across the University by providing various services, including access to reference services, service desks, self- serve kiosks, media spaces, individual or group study spaces, and workshops. The Libraries further provide access to books, journals, articles, newspapers, government publications, online databases, e-journals, theses and dissertations, etc. University students, staff, and alumni have access to the Libraries services. Members of the general public can obtain borrowing privileges by purchasing a citizen borrower's card. === Data Management === UML assists researchers in organizing their data and ensuring it remains accessible over time by providing data management consultations. === Digitization === Scanners throughout the Libraries can be used free of charge by students and staff for self-serve digitization. The Libraries' Research Services and Digital Strategies unit also offers fee-based digitization services for students, staff, and the general public. === MSpace === MSpace is an institutional repository which stores faculty and student publications, including theses, dissertations, working papers, reports, etc. === Subject Help === UML subject guides provide useful resources related to specific subjects, fields and disciplines, including related sources, databases, and research tips. Subject guides further provide students with the opportunity to contact and/or meet with specific Librarians specializing in those subjects. === Workshops === UML offers GradSteps workshops to assist graduate students in various ways. Workshops cover topics such as data collection and analysis, communication skills, grant writing, financial planning, networking, research ethics, citing, reference management, using library resources, GIS and data visualization. == Collections == === Dysart Memorial Collection of Rare Books === In 1953, to mark the official opening of the Elizabeth Dafoe Library, a collection of 69 rare books were gifted to UML in honour of the late Mr. Justice Andrew Knox Dysart, who was the University's fourth Chancellor. The books were accumulated by University President A.H.S. Gillson and paid for through the Manitoba Brewers' and Hotelmen's Welfare Fund. The books were printed over numerous centuries, with some dating back to the 1400s and are available at the Libraries' Archives & Special Collections department. === Icelandic Collection === UML's Elizabeth Dafoe Library holds over 27,000 volumes related to Icelandic literature, history, language. It is the largest body of Icelandic volumes in Canada, as well as the second largest collection in North America. === Indigenous Health Collection === The University of Manitoba's Indigenous Health Collection is held at the Neil John Maclean Health Sciences Library. It is the only Indigenous health collection held by a Canadian academic health sciences library. === UM Digital Collections === In 2013, the University of Manitoba Libraries launched their UM Digital Collections website. The digital asset management system provides access to over 75,000 rare books, newspapers, photographs, audio-visual content, and other textual records. The platform allows users to browse and search content, and download content in multiple access and preservation formats. Digital collections include a full run of the Winnipeg Tribune Newspaper, the University of Manitoba Brown and Gold Year Books, s\u00e9ance photos by Thomas Glendenning Hamilton, and the records of the Manitoba Gay & Lesbian Archives. == References == Category:University of Manitoba ",
