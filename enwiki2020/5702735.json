    "text": "TAB (Romanian: Transportor Amfibiu Blindat, translated Amphibious Armoured Personnel Carrier) is the Romanian military designation of armoured personnel carriers. The TAB APCs were based on the Russian BTR series until the early 1990s, with several improvements, including better diesel engines. After 1990, new TAB designs have been developed, such as the RN-94 and the Saur series, but none of these designs entered mass production. ==Models== King Ferdinand\" National Military Museum in Bucharest. * TAB-63 - prototype, predecessor of TAB-71 * TAB-71 - based on BTR-60 O'Malley, T.
