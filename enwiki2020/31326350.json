    "text": "Disasters can have high costs associated with responding to and recovering from them. This page lists the estimated economic costs of relatively recent disasters. The costs of disasters vary considerably depending on a range of factors, such as the geographical location where they occur. When a large disaster occurs in a wealthy country, the financial damage may be large, but when a comparable disaster occurs in a poorer country, the actual financial damage may appear to be relatively small. This is in part due to the difficulty of measuring the financial damage in areas that lack insurance. For example, the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, with a death toll of over 230,000 people, cost a 'mere' $15 billion, whereas in the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, in which 11 people died, the damages were six-fold. ==List== Note: All damage figures are listed in billions of United States dollars. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\" |+ List of disasters by cost |- !colspan=2|Cost ($billions) !rowspan=2 data-sort- type=\"number\" | Fatalities !rowspan=2|Event !rowspan=2|Type !rowspan=2|Year !rowspan=2|Nation |- ! !(2017-2018) |- |$360 |$411.3 |15899 |2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami |Earthquake, Tsunami |2011 | Japan |- |$197 |$329.8 |5502 \u2013 6434 |Great Hanshin earthquake |Earthquake |1995 | Japan |- |$148 |$176.4 |87587 |2008 Sichuan earthquake |Earthquake |2008 | China |- |$125 |$164.9 |1245 \u2013 1836 |Hurricane Katrina |Tropical cyclone |2005 | United States |- |$125 |$129.5 |107 |Hurricane Harvey |Tropical cyclone |2017 | United States |- |$91.6+ |$94.9+ |3057 \u2013 8498 |Hurricane Maria |Tropical cyclone |2017 |North America (, , , others) |- |$70 |$70 |451 |2019\u201320 Australian bushfire season |Wildfire |2019 | Australia |- |$68.7 |$76.3 |233 |Hurricane Sandy |Tropical cyclone |2012 |North America (, , , others) |- |$64.8 |$66.5 |134 |Hurricane Irma |Tropical cyclone |2017 |North America (, , , others) |- |$60 \u2013 $100 |$69.7 \u2013 $116.1 |11 |Deepwater Horizon oil spill |Contamination (Oil) |2010 | United States |- |$53.25 |$115.8 |4800 \u2013 17000 |1988\u201389 North American drought |Drought |1988 | United States, Canada |- |$50 \u2013 $433 |$113 \u2013 ~$700 |31 \u2013 46 |Chernobyl disaster |Contamination (Radiation) |1986 | Soviet Union (, ) |- |$49.6 \u2013 $56.1 |$53.3 \u2013 $60.3 |104 |2012\u201313 North American drought |Drought |2012 | United States, Canada |- |$49 |$81 |57 |1994 Northridge earthquake |Earthquake |1994 | United States |- |$45.7 |$49.8 |815 |2011 Thailand floods |Flood |2011 | Thailand |- |$40 |$44.6 |185 |2011 Christchurch earthquake |Earthquake |2011 | New Zealand |- |$38 |$43.3 |214 |Hurricane Ike |Tropical cyclone |2008 |North America (, , , others) |- |$28 |$36.2 |68 |2004 Ch\u016betsu earthquake |Earthquake |2004 | Japan |- |$27.4 |$34.4 |87 |Hurricane Wilma |Tropical cyclone |2005 |North America (, , , others) |- |$27.3 |$47.6 |65 |Hurricane Andrew |Tropical cyclone |1992 | United States |- |$26.1 |$33.9 |124 |Hurricane Ivan |Tropical cyclone |2004 |North America (, , , others) |- |$25.1 |$25.1 |74 |Hurricane Michael |Tropical cyclone |2018 |North America (, , , others) |- |$24.0 |$24.5 |103 |2018 California wildfires |Wildfire |2018 | United States |- |$21.8 \u2013 $135 |$30.2 \u2013 $186.9 |2996 |September 11 terrorist attacks |Terror attack |2001 | United States |- |$20.8 |20.8 |158 |2020 China floods |Flood |2020 | China |- |$19.2 |$24.6 |110 |2002 European floods |Flood |2002 |Central Europe (, , , others) |- |$18.5 |$23.2 |97 \u2013 125 |Hurricane Rita |Tropical cyclone |2005 | United States |- |$17.6 |$23.9 |140 |Cyclones Lothar and Martin |European windstorm |1999 |Western Europe (, , , others) |- |$16.9 |$21.9 |35 |Hurricane Charley |Tropical cyclone |2004 |North America (, , ) |- |$15.8 |$17 |27 |2012 Northern Italy earthquakes |Earthquake |2012 | Italy |- |$15.1 |$15.4 |603 |Hurricane Matthew |Tropical cyclone |2016 |North America (, , , others) |- |$15 \u2013 $20 |$25.6 \u2013 $34.1 |47 |Great Flood of 1993 |Flood |1993 | United States |- |$15.0 |$28.8 |197 |Cyclones Daria, Vivian, and Wiebke |European windstorm |1990 |Western Europe (, , , others) |- |$15 |$19.4 |230000 \u2013 280000 |2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami |Earthquake, Tsunami |2004 |Southeast Asia (, , , others) |- |$14.2 |$15.5 |58 |Hurricane Irene |Tropical cyclone |2011 |North America (, , , others) |- |$13.4 | 13.4 |84-120 |Cyclone Amphan |Tropical cyclone |2020 | India |- |$12.9 |$14.7 |138366 |Cyclone Nargis |Tropical cyclone |2008 | Myanmar |- |$12.7 |$13.2 |130 |November 2015 Paris attacks |Terror attack |2015 | France |- |$11.6 \u2013 $18.9Bibbee, A., et al.
