    "text": "AMC-4 or AMERICOM-4, formerly GE-4, is a Dutch, previously American, commercial communications satellite. AMC-4 was launched in 1999 as GE-4, GE Americom's fourth A2100 hybrid C-band and Ku-band satellite. The C-band payload was home to national television networks broadcasting to thousands of cable television headends. AMC-4's Ku-band transponders served the direct-to- home, VSAT, business television and broadband Internet market segments. These Ku-band transponders are designed to be switchable between North and South American coverages. It was renamed AMC-4 after GE Americom was bought by SES and re-branded SES Americom. In 2009, SES Americom merged with SES New Skies to form SES World Skies. AMC-4 has been replaced by SES-1 in 2010. AMC-4 has been moved to 134.9\u00b0 W, and currently has no FTA signals. ==Transponder data== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Transponders ! C band ! Ku band |- !
