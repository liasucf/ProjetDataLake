Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan MVO (13 May 1842 \u2013 22 November 1900) was an English composer. He is best known for 14 operatic collaborations with the dramatist W. S. Gilbert, including H.M.S. Pinafore, The Pirates of Penzance and The Mikado. His works include 24 operas, 11 major orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, incidental music to several plays, and numerous church pieces, songs, and piano and chamber pieces. His hymns and songs include \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\" and \"The Lost Chord\". The son of a military bandmaster, Sullivan composed his first anthem at the age of eight and was later a soloist in the boys' choir of the Chapel Royal. In 1856, at 14, he was awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship by the Royal Academy of Music, which allowed him to study at the academy and then at the Leipzig Conservatoire in Germany. His graduation piece, incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest (1861), was received with acclaim on its first performance in London. Among his early major works were a ballet, L'\u00cele Enchant\u00e9e (1864), a symphony, a cello concerto (both 1866), and his Overture di Ballo (1870). To supplement the income from his concert works he wrote hymns, parlour ballads and other light pieces, and worked as a church organist and music teacher. In 1866 Sullivan composed a one-act comic opera, Cox and Box, which is still widely performed. He wrote his first opera with W. S. Gilbert, Thespis, in 1871. Four years later, the impresario Richard D'Oyly Carte engaged Gilbert and Sullivan to create a one-act piece, Trial by Jury (1875). Its box-office success led to a series of twelve full-length comic operas by the collaborators. After the extraordinary success of H.M.S. Pinafore (1878) and The Pirates of Penzance (1879), Carte used his profits from the partnership to build the Savoy Theatre in 1881, and their joint works became known as the Savoy operas. Among the best known of the later operas are The Mikado (1885) and The Gondoliers (1889). Gilbert broke from Sullivan and Carte in 1890, after a quarrel over expenses at the Savoy. They reunited in the 1890s for two more operas, but these did not achieve the popularity of their earlier works. Sullivan's infrequent serious pieces during the 1880s included two cantatas, The Martyr of Antioch (1880) and The Golden Legend (1886), his most popular choral work. He also wrote incidental music for West End productions of several Shakespeare plays, and held conducting and academic appointments. Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe, though initially successful in 1891, has rarely been revived. In his last decade Sullivan continued to compose comic operas with various librettists and wrote other major and minor works. He died at the age of 58, regarded as Britain's foremost composer. His comic opera style served as a model for generations of musical theatre composers that followed, and his music is still frequently performed, recorded and pastiched. ==Life and career== ===Beginnings=== alt=Painting of Sullivan, about age 12, in his Chapel Royal uniform, standing next to an organ keyboard Sullivan was born in Lambeth, London, the younger of the two children, both boys, of Thomas Sullivan (1805\u20131866) and his wife, Mary Clementina n\u00e9e Coghlan (1811\u20131882). His father was a military bandmaster, clarinettist and music teacher, born in Ireland and raised in Chelsea, London; his mother was English born, of Irish and Italian descent.Young, pp. 1\u20132 Thomas Sullivan was based from 1845 to 1857 at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was the bandmaster and taught music privately to supplement his income.Ainger, pp. 6 and 22\u201323Jacobs, pp. 6\u20137 Young Arthur became proficient with many of the instruments in the band and composed an anthem, \"By the Waters of Babylon\", when he was eight.Jacobs, p. 7 He later recalled: While recognising the boy's obvious talent, his father knew the insecurity of a musical career and discouraged him from pursuing it.Young, p. 5 Sullivan studied at a private school in Bayswater. In 1854 he persuaded his parents and the headmaster to allow him to apply for membership in the choir of the Chapel Royal.Jacobs, p. 7; and Ainger, p. 24 Despite concerns that, at nearly 12 years of age, Sullivan was too old to give much service as a treble before his voice broke, he was accepted and soon became a soloist. By 1856, he was promoted to \"first boy\".Jacobs, pp. 8 and 12 Even at this age, his health was delicate, and he was easily fatigued.Jacobs, pp. 12\u201313 Sullivan flourished under the training of the Reverend Thomas Helmore, Master of the Children of the Chapel Royal, and began to write anthems and songs.Jacobs, pp. 10\u201311 Helmore encouraged his compositional talent and arranged for one of his pieces, \"O Israel\", to be published in 1855, his first published work.Young, p. 8 Helmore enlisted Sullivan's assistance in creating harmonisations for a volume of The Hymnal Noted\"Arthur Sullivan\", The Musical Times, 1 December 1900, pp. 785\u201387 and arranged for the boy's compositions to be performed; one anthem was performed at the Chapel Royal in St James's Palace under the direction of Sir George Smart. ===Mendelssohn scholar=== alt=Sullivan seated with one leg crossed over another, age 16, in his Royal Academy of Music uniform, showing his thick, curly hair. Black and white. In 1856 the Royal Academy of Music awarded the first Mendelssohn Scholarship to the 14-year-old Sullivan, granting him a year's training at the academy. His principal teacher there was John Goss, whose own teacher, Thomas Attwood, had been a pupil of Mozart.MacKenzie, Alexander. \"The Life-Work of Arthur Sullivan\", Sammelb\u00e4nde der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft, 3. Jahrg., H. 3, May 1902, pp. 539\u201364 He studied piano with William Sterndale Bennett (the future head of the academy) and Arthur O'Leary.Fitzsimons, pp. 98 and 142 During this first year at the academy Sullivan continued to sing solos with the Chapel Royal, which provided a small amount of spending money.Jacobs, pp. 13\u201316 Sullivan's scholarship was extended to a second year, and in 1858, in what his biographer Arthur Jacobs calls an \"extraordinary gesture of confidence\",Jacobs, p. 17 the scholarship committee extended his grant for a third year so that he could study in Germany, at the Leipzig Conservatoire. There, Sullivan studied composition with Julius Rietz and Carl Reinecke, counterpoint with Moritz Hauptmann and Ernst Richter, and the piano with Louis Plaidy and Ignaz Moscheles.Ainger, p. 37 He was trained in Mendelssohn's ideas and techniques but was also exposed to a variety of styles, including those of Schubert, Verdi, Bach and Wagner.Jacobs, p. 24 Visiting a synagogue, he was so struck by some of the cadences and progressions of the music that thirty years later he could recall them for use in his grand opera, Ivanhoe. He became friendly with the future impresario Carl Rosa and the violinist Joseph Joachim, among others.Jacobs, pp. 22\u201324 The academy renewed Sullivan's scholarship to allow him a second year of study at Leipzig.Young, p. 21 For his third and last year there, his father scraped together the money for living expenses, and the conservatoire assisted by waiving its fees.Jacobs, p. 23 Sullivan's graduation piece, completed in 1861, was a suite of incidental music to Shakespeare's The Tempest. Revised and expanded, it was performed at the Crystal Palace in 1862, a year after his return to London; The Musical Times described it as a sensation.Jacobs, pp. 27\u201328 He began building a reputation as England's most promising young composer. ===Rising composer=== Colleagues and collaborators: clockwise from top left, alt=Head and shoulders photos of each of the four men.

Grove is bald and benign-looking; Burnand fully-thatched and moderately bearded, looking pleased with himself; Carte, serious, dark-haired and neatly bearded; and Gilbert light-coloured hair and moustache looking slightly to right. Sullivan embarked on his composing career with a series of ambitious works, interspersed with hymns, parlour songs and other light pieces in a more commercial vein. His compositions were not enough to support him financially, and from 1861 to 1872 he worked as a church organist, which he enjoyed, and as a music teacher, which he hated and gave up as soon as he could.Ainger, p. 56 He took an early opportunity to compose several pieces for royalty in connection with the wedding of the Prince of Wales in 1863.Jacobs, p. 35 With The Masque at Kenilworth (Birmingham Festival, 1864), Sullivan began his association with works for voice and orchestra.Jacobs, p. 38 While an organist at the Royal Italian Opera, Covent Garden, he composed his first ballet, L'\u00cele Enchant\u00e9e (1864).Jacobs, p. 37 His 'Irish Symphony and Cello Concerto (both 1866) were his only works in their respective genres.Jacobs, pp. 36 and 42 In the same year, his Overture in C (In Memoriam), commemorating the recent death of his father, was a commission from the Norwich Festival. It achieved considerable popularity.Jacobs, p. 43 In June 1867 the Philharmonic Society gave the first performance of his overture Marmion.Jacobs, Arthur. \"Sullivan, Sir Arthur\", Grove Music Online, Oxford University Press, accessed 19 August 2011 The reviewer for The Times called it \"another step in advance on the part of the only composer of any remarkable promise that just at present we can boast.\"\"Concerts\", The Times, 17 June 1867, p. 12 In October, Sullivan travelled with George Grove to Vienna in search of neglected scores by Schubert.Jacobs, p. 45; and Young, p. 56 They unearthed manuscript copies of symphonies and vocal music, and were particularly elated by their final discovery, the incidental music to Rosamunde. Sullivan's first attempt at opera, The Sapphire Necklace (1863\u201364) to a libretto by Henry F. Chorley, was not produced and is now lost, except for the overture and two songs that were separately published.Jacobs, pp. 42\u201343 His first surviving opera, Cox and Box (1866), was written for a private performance.Ainger, p. 65 It then received charity performances in London and Manchester, and was later produced at the Gallery of Illustration, where it ran for an extraordinary 264 performances. W. S. Gilbert, writing in Fun magazine, pronounced the score superior to F. C. Burnand's libretto.Young, p. 63 Sullivan and Burnand were soon commissioned by Thomas German Reed for a two-act opera, The Contrabandista (1867; revised and expanded as The Chieftain in 1894), but it did not do as well.Young, p. 63; and Rollins and Witts, p. 15 Among Sullivan's early part songs is \"The Long Day Closes\" (1868).Sullivan, Marc. \"Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan: Recordings of Hymns and Songs\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 11 July 2010, accessed 9 September 2011 Sullivan's last major work of the 1860s was a short oratorio, The Prodigal Son, first given in Worcester Cathedral as part of the 1869 Three Choirs Festival to much praise.\"Worcester Music Festival\", The Times, 9 September 1869, p. 10 ===1870s: first collaborations with Gilbert=== Poster: scenes from alt=Poster showing scenes from all three operas featuring principal characters; the productions, by an American opera company around 1879, seem lavish. Black and white. Sullivan's most enduring orchestral work, the Overture di Ballo, was composed for the Birmingham Festival in 1870. The same year, Sullivan first met the poet and dramatist W. S. Gilbert. In 1871 Sullivan published his only song cycle, The Window, to words by Tennyson,Jacobs, pp. 57\u201358 and he wrote the first of a series of incidental music scores for productions of Shakespeare plays. He also composed a dramatic cantata, On Shore and Sea, for the opening of the London International Exhibition,Jacobs, pp. 65\u201366 and the hymn \"Onward, Christian Soldiers\", with words by Sabine Baring-Gould. The Salvation Army adopted the latter as its favoured processional,Branston, John. \"Christian Soldiers: The Salvation Army brings humility and $48 million to the fairgrounds discussion\", Memphis Flyer, 18 November 2005 and it became Sullivan's best-known hymn.Young, p. 99 At the end of 1871 John Hollingshead, proprietor of London's Gaiety Theatre, commissioned Sullivan to work with Gilbert to create the burlesque-style comic opera Thespis.Ainger, p. 93 Played as a Christmas entertainment, it ran through to Easter 1872, a good run for such a piece.Rees, p. 78 Gilbert and Sullivan then went their separate waysStedman, p. 94 until they collaborated on three parlour ballads in late 1874 and early 1875.Stedman, pp. 126\u201327 Sullivan's large-scale works of the early 1870s were the Festival Te Deum (Crystal Palace, 1872)Jacobs, pp. 75\u201376 and the oratorio The Light of the World (Birmingham Festival, 1873). He provided incidental music for productions of The Merry Wives of Windsor at the Gaiety in 1874Jacobs, p. 76 and Henry VIII at the Theatre Royal, Manchester, in 1877.Jacobs, p. 108 He continued to compose hymns throughout the decade. In 1873 Sullivan contributed songs to Burnand's Christmas \"drawing room extravaganza\", The Miller and His Man.Howarth, Paul. The Miller and His Man, the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 In 1875 the manager of the Royalty Theatre, Richard D'Oyly Carte, needed a short piece to fill out a bill with Offenbach's La P\u00e9richole. Carte had conducted Sullivan's Cox and Box.Ainger, pp. 107\u201308 Remembering that Gilbert had suggested a libretto to him, Carte engaged Sullivan to set it, and the result was the one-act comic opera Trial by Jury.Ainger, p. 108 Trial, starring Sullivan's brother Fred as the Learned Judge, became a surprise hit, earning glowing praise from the critics and playing for 300 performances over its first few seasons.Allen, p. 30 The Daily Telegraph commented that the piece illustrated the composer's \"great capacity for dramatic writing of the lighter class\", and other reviews emphasised the felicitous combination of Gilbert's words and Sullivan's music.The Daily News, 27 March 1875, p. 3 One wrote, \"it seems, as in the great Wagnerian operas, as though poem and music had proceeded simultaneously from one and the same brain.\"\"Trial by Jury\", The Musical World, 3 April 1875, p. 226, accessed 17 June 2008 A few months later, another Sullivan one-act comic opera opened: The Zoo, with a libretto by B. C. Stephenson.Jacobs, pp. 91\u201392 It was less successful than Trial, and for the next 15 years Sullivan's sole operatic collaborator was Gilbert; the partners created a further twelve operas together.Rollins and Witts, pp. 5\u201312 {|align=right | |} Sullivan also turned out more than 80 popular songs and parlour ballads, most of them written before the end of the 1870s.Young, pp. 273\u201378, gives a complete list. For links and descriptions, see Howarth, Paul (ed.) \"Sir Arthur Sullivan's Songs and Parlour Ballads\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 18 July 2004, accessed 18 December 2017 His first popular song was \"Orpheus with his Lute\" (1866), and a well-received part song was \"Oh! Hush thee, my Babie\" (1867). The best known of his songs is \"The Lost Chord\" (1877, lyrics by Adelaide Anne Procter), written at the bedside of his brother during Fred's last illness.Ainger, p. 128 The sheet music for his best-received songs sold in large numbers and was an important part of his income.Goodman, p. 19 alt=Newspaper cartoon of a monocled Sullivan lounging in a chair, his feet propped up on the podium, lazily conducting In this decade, Sullivan's conducting appointments included the Glasgow Choral Union concerts (1875\u201377) and the Royal Aquarium Theatre, London (1876).Ainger, p. 121 In addition to his appointment as Professor of Composition at the Royal Academy of Music, of which he was a Fellow, he was appointed as the first Principal of the National Training School for Music in 1876. He accepted the latter post reluctantly, fearing that discharging the duties thoroughly would leave too little time for composing; in this he was correct. He was not effective in the post, and resigned in 1881. Sullivan's next collaboration with Gilbert, The Sorcerer (1877), ran for 178 performances,Rollins and Witts, p. 5 a success by the standards of the day,Crowther (2000), p. 96 but H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), which followed it, turned Gilbert and Sullivan into an international phenomenon.Crowther (2000), p. 96; and Stedman, p. 169 Sullivan composed the bright and cheerful music of Pinafore while suffering from excruciating pain from a kidney stone.Ainger, p. 155 Pinafore ran for 571 performances in London, then the second-longest theatrical run in history,Gaye, p. 1532; and Gillan, Don. \"Longest Running Plays in London and New York\", StageBeauty.net (2007), accessed 10 March 2009 and more than 150 unauthorised productions were quickly mounted in America alone.Prestige, Colin. \"D'Oyly Carte and the Pirates: The Original New York Productions of Gilbert and Sullivan\", pp. 113\u201348 at p. 118, Gilbert and Sullivan Papers Presented at the International Conference held at the University of Kansas in May 1970, Edited by James Helyar.

Pinafore This criticism would follow Sullivan throughout his career. In 1879 Sullivan suggested to a reporter from The New York Times the secret of his success with Gilbert: \"His ideas are as suggestive for music as they are quaint and laughable. His numbers ... always give me musical ideas.\"\"A Talk With Mr. Sullivan\", The New York Times, 1 August 1879, p. 3, accessed 22 May 2012 Pinafore was followed by The Pirates of Penzance in 1879, which opened in New York and then ran in London for 363 performances.Rollins and Witts, p. 7 ===Early 1880s=== alt=Drawing of scenes from the festival premiere of The Golden Legend showing the chorus, the faces of the principal singers and Sullivan's back, as he stands conducting. Black and white. In 1880 Sullivan was appointed director of the triennial Leeds Music Festival.Jacobs, p. 139 He had earlier been commissioned to write a sacred choral work for the festival and chose, as its subject, Henry Hart Milman's 1822 dramatic poem based on the life and death of St. Margaret of Antioch. The Martyr of Antioch was first performed at the Leeds Festival in October 1880.Ainger, p. 163 Gilbert adapted the libretto for Sullivan,McClure, Derrick. \"The Martyr of Antioch: Gilbert's Contribution to the Libretto\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 who, in gratitude, presented his collaborator with an engraved silver cup inscribed \"W.S. Gilbert from his friend Arthur Sullivan.\" Sullivan was not a showy conductor, and some thought him dull and old-fashioned on the podium, but Martyr had an enthusiastic reception and was frequently revived.Ainger, pp. 190, 195, 203, 215, 255\u201356 and 390 Other critics and performers had favorable reactions to Sullivan's conducting, and he had a busy conducting career in parallel with his composing career, including seven Leeds Festivals among many other appointments.Palmer, chapter 3 Sullivan invariably conducted the opening nights of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.Rollins and Witts, pp. 3\u201318 Carte opened the next Gilbert and Sullivan piece, Patience, in April 1881 at London's Opera Comique, where their past three operas had played. In October, Patience transferred to the new, larger, state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre, built with the profits of the previous Gilbert and Sullivan works. The rest of the partnership's collaborations were produced at the Savoy, and are widely known as the \"Savoy operas\". Iolanthe (1882), the first new opera to open at the Savoy, was Gilbert and Sullivan's fourth hit in a row.Jacobs, p. 178 Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed the composition of comic operas as unimportant, beneath his skills, and also repetitious. After Iolanthe, Sullivan had not intended to write a new work with Gilbert, but he suffered a serious financial loss when his broker went bankrupt in November 1882. Therefore, he concluded that his financial needs obliged him to continue writing Savoy operas.Ainger, pp. 217\u201319 In February 1883, he and Gilbert signed a five-year agreement with Carte, requiring them to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.Ainger, p. 219 On 22 May 1883 Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria for his \"services ... rendered to the promotion of the art of music\" in Britain.Ainger, p. 220 The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should end his career as a composer of comic opera \u2013 that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera.Dailey, p. 28; and Lawrence, pp. 163\u201364 Having just signed the five-year agreement, Sullivan suddenly felt trapped.Jacobs, p. 188 The next opera, Princess Ida (1884, the duo's only three-act, blank verse work), had a shorter run than its four predecessors; Sullivan's score was praised. With box office receipts lagging in March 1884, Carte gave the six months' notice, under the partnership contract, requiring a new opera.Jacobs, p. 187 Sullivan's close friend, the composer Frederic Clay, had recently suffered a career-ending stroke at the age of 45. Sullivan, reflecting on this, on his own long-standing kidney problems, and on his desire to devote himself to more serious music, replied to Carte, \"[I]t is impossible for me to do another piece of the character of those already written by Gilbert and myself.\"Crowther, Andrew. \"The Carpet Quarrel Explained\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 alt=Colourful programme cover for The Mikado showing several of the principal characters under the words \"Savoy Theatre\" Gilbert had already started work on a new opera in which the characters fell in love against their wills after taking a magic lozenge. Sullivan wrote on 1 April 1884 that he had \"come to the end of my tether\" with the operas: \"I have been continually keeping down the music in order that not one [syllable] should be lost. ... I should like to set a story of human interest & probability where the humorous words would come in a humorous (not serious) situation, & where, if the situation were a tender or dramatic one the words would be of similar character.\"Ainger, p. 230 In a lengthy exchange of correspondence, Sullivan pronounced Gilbert's plot sketch (particularly the \"lozenge\" element) unacceptably mechanical, and too similar in both its grotesque \"elements of topsyturveydom\" and in actual plot to their earlier work, especially The Sorcerer. He repeatedly requested that Gilbert find a new subject.Jacobs, pp. 190\u201393 The impasse was finally resolved on 8 May when Gilbert proposed a plot that did not depend on any supernatural device. The result was Gilbert and Sullivan's most successful work, The Mikado (1885).Rollins and Witts, p. 10 The piece ran for 672 performances, which was the second-longest run for any work of musical theatre, and one of the longest runs of any theatre piece, up to that time. ===Later 1880s=== Millais (1888) in the National Portrait Gallery, London. It hangs next to Frank Holl's 1886 portrait of Gilbert.|alt=Painting of Sullivan, seated with one leg crossed over the other, looking intently at the artist In 1886 Sullivan composed his second and last large-scale choral work of the decade. It was a cantata for the Leeds Festival, The Golden Legend, based on Longfellow's poem of the same name. Apart from the comic operas, this proved to be Sullivan's best received full-length work.Jacobs, pp. 242\u201343 It was given hundreds of performances during his lifetime, and at one point he declared a moratorium on its presentation, fearing that it would become over-exposed.Turnbull, Stephen. \"Sullivan Biography\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 Only Handel's Messiah was performed more often in Britain in the 1880s and 1890s.Russell Hulme, David. Notes to Hyperion CD set CDA67280, The Golden Legend (2001) It remained in the repertory until about the 1920s, but since then it has seldom been performed;Jacobs, p. 243 it received its first professional recording in 2001. The musical scholar and conductor David Russell Hulme writes that the work influenced Elgar and Walton. Ruddigore followed The Mikado at the Savoy in 1887. It was profitable, but its nine- month run was disappointing compared with most of the earlier Savoy operas.Ainger, pp. 259\u201361 For their next piece, Gilbert submitted another version of the magic lozenge plot, which Sullivan again rejected. Gilbert finally proposed a comparatively serious opera, to which Sullivan agreed.Ainger, pp. 265, 270 Although it was not a grand opera, The Yeomen of the Guard (1888) provided him with the opportunity to compose his most ambitious stage work to date.Ainger, pp. 281\u201382; and Jacobs, pp. 274\u201375 As early as 1883 Sullivan had been under pressure from the musical establishment to write a grand opera. In 1885 he told an interviewer, \"The opera of the future is a compromise [among the French, German and Italian schools] \u2013 a sort of eclectic school, a selection of the merits of each one. I myself will make an attempt to produce a grand opera of this new school. ... Yes, it will be an historical work, and it is the dream of my life.\"\"Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Talk With the Composer of Pinafore\", San Francisco Chronicle, 22 July 1885, p. 9 After The Yeomen of the Guard opened, Sullivan turned again to Shakespeare, composing incidental music for Henry Irving's Lyceum Theatre production of Macbeth (1888).Hughes, p.19 Sullivan wished to produce further serious works with Gilbert. He had collaborated with no other librettist since 1875. But Gilbert felt that the reaction to The Yeomen of the Guard had \"not been so convincing as to warrant us in assuming that the public want something more earnest still\". He proposed instead that Sullivan should go ahead with his plan to write a grand opera, but should continue also to compose comic works for the Savoy. Sullivan was not immediately persuaded. He replied, \"I have lost the liking for writing comic opera, and entertain very grave doubts as to my power of doing it.\" Nevertheless, Sullivan soon commissioned a grand opera libretto from Julian Sturgis (who was recommended by Gilbert), and suggested to Gilbert that he revive an old idea for an opera set in colourful Venice.Jacobs, pp. 282\u201383 and 288; and Ainger, p. 294 The comic opera was completed first: The Gondoliers (1889) was a piece described by Gervase Hughes as a pinnacle of Sullivan's achievement.Hughes, p. 24 It was the last great Gilbert and Sullivan success.Ainger, p. 303 ===1890s=== alt=Colourful programme cover for Ivanhoe, showing one of the characters in a white wedding dress, under the words \"The Royal English Opera\" The relationship between Gilbert and Sullivan suffered its most serious breach in April 1890, during the run of The Gondoliers, when Gilbert objected to Carte's financial accounts for the production, including a charge to the partnership for the cost of new carpeting for the Savoy Theatre lobby. Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone.Stedman, p. 270 Carte was building a new theatre to present Sullivan's forthcoming grand opera, and Sullivan sided with Carte, going so far as to sign an affidavit that contained erroneous information about old debts of the partnership.Ainger, pp. 315\u201316 Gilbert took legal action against Carte and Sullivan, vowing to write no more for the Savoy, and so the partnership came to an acrimonious end.Ainger, p. 312 Sullivan wrote to Gilbert in September 1890 that he was \"physically and mentally ill over this wretched business. I have not yet got over the shock of seeing our names coupled ... in hostile antagonism over a few miserable pounds\".Lamb, Andrew. \"Ivanhoe and the Royal English Opera\", The Musical Times, Vol. 114, No. 1563, May 1973, pp. 475\u201378 Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe, based on Walter Scott's novel, opened at Carte's new Royal English Opera House on 31 January 1891. Sullivan completed the score too late to meet Carte's planned production date, and costs mounted; Sullivan was required to pay Carte a contractual penalty of \u00a33,000 () for his delay.Jacobs, pp. 328\u201329Ainger, p. 322 The production lasted for 155 consecutive performances, an unprecedented run for a grand opera, and earned good notices for its music.Gordon-Powell, Robin. Ivanhoe, full score, Introduction, vol. I, pp. XII\u2013XIV, 2008, The Amber Ring Afterwards, Carte was unable to fill the new opera house with other opera productions and sold the theatre. Despite the initial success of Ivanhoe, some writers blamed it for the failure of the opera house, and it soon passed into obscurity. Herman Klein called the episode \"the strangest comingling of success and failure ever chronicled in the history of British lyric enterprise!\"Klein, Herman. \"An Account of the Composition and Production of Ivanhoe\", Thirty Years of Musical Life in London, 1870\u20131900 (1903), reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 3 October 2003, accessed 5 October 2014 Later in 1891 Sullivan composed music for Tennyson's The Foresters, which ran well at Daly's Theatre in New York in 1892, but failed in London the following year. alt=Colourful poster for The Chieftain, showing the figure of a man dressed as a flamboyant bandit with a large, peaked black hat Sullivan returned to comic opera, but because of the fracture with Gilbert, he and Carte sought other collaborators. Sullivan's next piece was Haddon Hall (1892), with a libretto by Sydney Grundy based loosely on the legend of the elopement of Dorothy Vernon with John Manners.Jacobs, pp. 336\u201342 Although still comic, the tone and style of the work was considerably more serious and romantic than most of the operas with Gilbert. It ran for 204 performances, and was praised by critics.Jacobs, pp. 341\u201342 In 1895 Sullivan once more provided incidental music for the Lyceum, this time for J. Comyns Carr's King Arthur.Jacobs, pp. 436\u201337 With the aid of an intermediary, Sullivan's music publisher Tom Chappell, the three partners were reunited in 1892.Ainger, p. 328 Their next opera, Utopia, Limited (1893), ran for 245 performances, barely covering the expenses of the lavish production,Ainger, p. 346 although it was the longest run at the Savoy in the 1890s.Coles, Clifton. \"Mirette: Introduction\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 May 1998, accessed 28 July 2018 Sullivan came to disapprove of the leading lady, Nancy McIntosh, and refused to write another piece featuring her; Gilbert insisted that she must appear in his next opera.Ainger, p. 352 Instead, Sullivan teamed up again with his old partner, F. C. Burnand. The Chieftain (1894), a heavily revised version of their earlier two-act opera, The Contrabandista, flopped.Ainger, p. 357 Gilbert and Sullivan reunited one more time, after McIntosh announced her retirement from the stage, for The Grand Duke (1896). It failed, and Sullivan never worked with Gilbert again, although their operas continued to be revived with success at the Savoy.Young, p. 201 In May 1897 Sullivan's full-length ballet, Victoria and Merrie England, opened at the Alhambra Theatre to celebrate the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. The work celebrates English history and culture, with the Victorian period as the grand finale. Its six-month run was considered a great achievement.Jacobs, pp. 372\u201376 The Beauty Stone (1898), with a libretto by Arthur Wing Pinero and J. Comyns Carr, was based on mediaeval morality plays. The collaboration did not go well: Sullivan wrote that Pinero and Comyns Carr were \"gifted and brilliant men, with no experience in writing for music\",Entry from Sullivan's diary, quoted in Jacobs p. 379 and, when he asked for alterations to improve the structure, they refused.Jacobs, p. 379 The opera, moreover, was too serious for the Savoy audiences' tastes.Coles, Clifton. \"The Beauty Stone: Notes on the Text\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2004, accessed 18 July 2018 It was a critical failure and ran for only seven weeks.Jacobs, pp. 379\u201380 In 1899, to benefit \"the wives and children of soldiers and sailors\" on active service in the Boer War, Sullivan composed the music of a song, \"The Absent- Minded Beggar\", to a text by Rudyard Kipling, which became an instant sensation and raised an unprecedented \u00a3300,000 () for the fund from performances and the sale of sheet music and related merchandise.Lycett, p. 432 In The Rose of Persia (1899), Sullivan returned to his comic roots, writing to a libretto by Basil Hood that combined an exotic Arabian Nights setting with plot elements of The Mikado. Sullivan's tuneful score was well received, and the opera proved to be his most successful full-length collaboration apart from those with Gilbert.Jacobs, pp. 387, 391\u201392 Another opera with Hood, The Emerald Isle, quickly went into preparation, but Sullivan died before it was completed. The score was finished by Edward German, and produced in 1901.Jacobs, p. 400 ===Death, honours and legacy=== alt=Colour photo of bronze statue of a partly-clothed muse, leaning on a stone pillar, looking up, longingly, at a bronze bust of Sullivan Sullivan's health was never robust \u2013 from his thirties his kidney disease often obliged him to conduct sitting down.

Sullivan wished to be buried in Brompton Cemetery with his parents and brother, but by order of the Queen he was buried in St. Paul's Cathedral.\"Funeral of Sir Arthur Sullivan\", The Times, 28 November 1900, p. 12 In addition to his knighthood, honours awarded to Sullivan in his lifetime included Doctor in Music, honoris causa, by the Universities of Cambridge (1876) and Oxford (1879); Chevalier, L\u00e9gion d'honneur, France (1878); The Order of the Medjidieh conferred by the Sultan of Turkey (1888); and appointment as a Member of the Fourth Class of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1897.The London Gazette, 9 July 1897, p. 54 Sullivan's operas have often been adapted, first in the 19th century as dance pieces and in foreign adaptations of the operas themselves. Since then, his music has been made into ballets (Pineapple Poll (1951) and Pirates of Penzance \u2013 The Ballet! (1991)) and musicals (The Swing Mikado (1938), The Hot Mikado (1939) and Hot Mikado (1986), Hollywood Pinafore and Memphis Bound (both 1945), The Black Mikado (1975), etc.).

(2003) 1584653116 ==Personal life== ===Romantic life=== alt=Photo of Ronalds from the waist up, facing the camera. She is handsome and well-dressed, with a fur collar and an \"up\" hairdo. Sullivan never married, but he had serious love affairs with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845\u20131882), the daughter of the engineer John Scott Russell. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer of uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868 Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841\u20131878). Both relationships ended by early 1869.Ainger, p. 87; and Jacobs, pp. 53\u201355. Sullivan's longest love affair was with the American socialite Fanny Ronalds, a woman three years his senior, who had two children.Ainger, pp. 128\u201329 He met her in Paris around 1867, and the affair began in earnest soon after she moved to London in 1871. According to a contemporary description of Ronalds, \"Her face was perfectly divine in its loveliness, her features small and exquisitely regular. Her hair was a dark shade of brown \u2013 ch\u00e2tain fonc\u00e9 [deep chestnut] \u2013 and very abundant ... a lovely woman, with the most generous smile one could possibly imagine, and the most beautiful teeth.\"Quoted in Jacobs, p. 88 Sullivan called her \"the best amateur singer in London\".Ainger, p. 167 She often performed Sullivan's songs at her famous Sunday soir\u00e9es. She became particularly associated with \"The Lost Chord\", singing it both in private and in public, often with Sullivan accompanying her.Ainger, p. 135 When Sullivan died, he left her the autograph manuscript of that song, along with other bequests.Ainger, p. 390 Ronalds was separated from her American husband, but they never divorced. Social conventions of the time compelled Sullivan and Ronalds to keep their relationship private. She apparently became pregnant at least twice and procured abortions in 1882 and 1884.Jacobs, pp. 178, 203\u201304; and Ainger, pp. 210 and 237\u201338 Sullivan had a roving eye, and his diary records the occasional quarrels when Ronalds discovered his other liaisons, but he always returned to her. Around 1889 or 1890 the sexual relationship evidently ended \u2013 he started to refer to her in his diary as \"Auntie\"Jacobs, p. 295 \u2013 but she remained a constant companion for the rest of his life.Ainger, pp. 306 and 342 In 1896 the 54-year-old Sullivan proposed marriage to the 22-year-old Violet Beddington (1874\u20131962), but she refused him.Ainger, pp. 364\u201365 ===Leisure and family life=== Herbert (\"Bertie\")|alt=Sullivan, seated, with Herbert standing behind his left shoulder; both are very well-dressed and mustachioed Sullivan loved to spend time in France (both in Paris and on the Riviera), where his acquaintances included European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling.Young, pp. 246\u201347 and 250 He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors.Grossmith, George. \"Sir Arthur Sullivan: A Personal Reminiscence\", The Pall Mall Magazine, February 1901, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee.Beresiner, Yasha. \"Gilbert and Sullivan: Musical Masons\", Pietre-Stones Review of Freemasonry, 18 December 2007 Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh.Jacobs, p. 73 and passim Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis; according to George Grossmith, \"I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players in my time, but I never saw anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan\". Sullivan was devoted to his parents, particularly his mother. He corresponded regularly with her when away from London, until her death in 1882. Henry Lytton wrote, \"I believe there was never a more affectionate tie than that which existed between [Sullivan] and his mother, a very witty old lady, and one who took an exceptional pride in her son's accomplishments.\"Lytton, Henry (1922). \"Leaders of the Savoy\", Secrets of a Savoyard, the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 Sullivan was also very fond of his brother Fred, whose acting career he assisted whenever possible, and of Fred's children.Hayes, passim After Fred died at the age of 39, leaving his pregnant wife, Charlotte, with seven children under the age of 14, Sullivan visited the family often and became guardian to the children.Hayes, pp. 6\u20137 In 1883 Charlotte and six of her children emigrated to Los Angeles, California, leaving the oldest boy, \"Bertie\", in Sullivan's sole care.Ainger, pp. 224\u201325 Despite his reservations about the move to the United States, Sullivan paid all the costs and gave substantial financial support to the family.Hayes, p. 9 A year later, Charlotte died, leaving the children to be raised mostly by her brother. From June to August 1885, after The Mikado opened, Sullivan visited the family in Los Angeles and took them on a sightseeing trip of the American west.Hayes, pp. 14\u201322 Throughout the rest of his life, and in his will, he contributed financially to Fred's children, continuing to correspond with them and to be concerned with their education, marriages and financial affairs. Bertie remained with his Uncle Arthur for the rest of the composer's life.Hayes, pp. 23\u201332 Three of Sullivan's cousins, the daughters of his uncle John Thomas Sullivan, performed with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company: Rose, Jane (\"Jennie\") and Kate Sullivan, the first two of whom used the stage surname Hervey. Kate was a chorister who defected to the Comedy Opera Company's rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore, where she had the opportunity to play the leading soprano role, Josephine, in 1879.Stone, David.

Rose Hervey, Who Was Who in the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, 7 August 2002, accessed 28 July 2018See Sullivan family tree in appendix to Jacobs ==Music== Sullivan's works comprise 24 operas, 11 full orchestral works, ten choral works and oratorios, two ballets, one song cycle, incidental music to several plays, more than 70 hymns and anthems, over 80 songs and parlour ballads, and a body of part songs, carols, and piano and chamber pieces.Young, passim The operatic output spanned his whole career, as did that of his songs and religious music. The solo piano and chamber pieces are mostly from his early years, and are generally in a Mendelssohnian style.Jacobs, p. 42 With the exception of his Imperial March, composed for a royal occasion in 1893, the large-scale orchestral concert works also date from early in the composer's career.Young, pp, 271\u201372 ===Influences=== Reviewers and scholars often cite Mendelssohn as the most important influence on Sullivan. The music for The Tempest and the Irish Symphony, among other works, was seen by contemporary writers as strikingly Mendelssohnian.Taylor, Chapter 1, 3rd and 4th page Percy Young writes that Sullivan's early affection for Mendelssohn remained evident throughout his composing career.Young, p. 22 Hughes remarks that although Sullivan emulated Mendelssohn in certain ways he seldom \"lapsed into those harmonic clich\u00e9s which mar some of Mendelssohn's more sentimental effusions\".Hughes, p. 69 When The Tempest music was first presented the Neue Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Musik identified Schumann as a stronger influence, and Benedict Taylor, writing in 2017, concurs.Taylor, p. 10 In a 2009 study Taylor adds Schubert as another major influence on Sullivan in his orchestral works, although \"from the beginning ... there is the peculiar, intangible stamp of Sullivan emerging confidently\".Eden and Saremba, p. 38 Meinhard Saremba notes that from Sullivan's first meeting with Rossini in Paris, in 1862, Rossini's output became a model for Sullivan's comic opera music, \"as evidenced in several rhythmic patterns and constructions of long finales\".Eden and Saremba, p. 57 \"Ape\", 1874|alt=Colour cartoon of Sullivan standing, in concert dress, wearing a monocle, ready to conduct As a young man, Sullivan's conservative musical education led him to follow in the conventions of his predecessors. Later he became more adventurous; Richard Silverman, writing in 2009, points to the influence of Liszt in later works \u2013 a harmonic ambiguity and chromaticism \u2013 so that by the time of The Golden Legend Sullivan had abandoned a home key altogether for the prelude.Eden and Saremba, pp. 76\u201377 Sullivan disliked much of Wagner's Musikdrama, but he modelled the overture to The Yeomen of the Guard on the prelude of Die Meistersinger, which he described as \"the greatest comic opera ever written\".Eden and Saremba, p. 57; and Klein, p. 196 Saremba writes that in works from his middle and later years, Sullivan was inspired by Verdi's example both in details of orchestration, and in la tinta musical \u2013 the individual musical character of a piece \u2013 ranging from the \"nautical air of H.M.S Pinafore\" to \"the swift Mediterranean lightness of The Gondoliers\" and \"the bleakness of Torquilstone in Ivanhoe\".Eden and Saremba, p. 60 ===Method of composition and text setting=== Sullivan told an interviewer, Arthur Lawrence, \"I don't use the piano in composition \u2013 that would limit me terribly\". Sullivan explained that his process was not to wait for inspiration, but \"to dig for it. ... I decide on [the rhythm] before I come to the question of melody. ... I mark out the metre in dots and dashes, and not until I have quite settled on the rhythm do I proceed to actual notation.\"Lawrence, Arthur H. \"An Illustrated interview with Sir Arthur Sullivan, Part I\", The Strand Magazine, vol. xiv, No. 84, December 1897 Sullivan's text setting, compared with that of his 19th century English predecessors or his European contemporaries, was \"vastly more sensitive. ... Sullivan's operatic style attempts to create for itself a uniquely English text-music synthesis\", and, in addition, by adopting a conservative musical style, he was able to achieve \"the clarity to match Gilbert's finely honed wit with musical wit of his own\".Fink, Robert. \"Rhythm and Text Setting in The Mikado\", 19th Century Music, vol. XIV No. 1, Summer 1990 In composing the Savoy operas, Sullivan wrote the vocal lines of the musical numbers first, and these were given to the actors. He, or an assistant, improvised a piano accompaniment at the early rehearsals; he wrote the orchestrations later, after he had seen what Gilbert's stage business would be.Ainger, p. 138 He left the overtures until last and sometimes delegated their composition, based on his outlines, to his assistants,\"Sir Arthur Sullivan\", interviewed by The Pall Mall Gazette, 5 December 1889, reprinted at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 6 October 2011 often adding his suggestions or corrections.Hughes, p. 130 Those Sullivan wrote himself include Thespis,Rees, p. 79 Iolanthe, Princess Ida, The Yeomen of the Guard, The Gondoliers, The Grand Duke and probably Utopia, Limited.Hughes, pp. 130\u201341 Most of the overtures are structured as a pot-pourri of tunes from the operas in three sections: fast, slow and fast. Those for Iolanthe and The Yeomen of the Guard are written in a modified sonata form.Williams, p. 298 ===Melody and rhythm=== The Musical Times noted that Sullivan's tunes, at least in the comic operas, appeal to the professional as much as to the layman: his continental contemporaries such as Saint-Sa\u00ebns and the Viennese critic Eduard Hanslick held the Savoy operas in high regard.Jacobs, p. 244; and Harding, p. 119 Hughes writes, \"When Sullivan wrote what we call 'a good tune' it was nearly always 'good music' as well. Outside the ranks of the giants there are few other composers of whom the same could be said.\" Although his melodies sprang from rhythm, some of his themes may have been prompted by his chosen instrumentation or his harmonic techniques.Hughes, p. 129 alt=Excerpt of music \u2013 part of Tolloller's line In the comic operas, where many numbers are in verse-plus-refrain form, Sullivan shaped his melodies to provide a climax for the verse, capped by an overall climax in the refrain. Hughes cites \"If you go in\" (Iolanthe) as an example. He adds that Sullivan rarely reached the same class of excellence in instrumental works, where he had no librettist to feed his imagination.Hughes, p. 128 Even with Gilbert, on those occasions when the librettist wrote in unvaried metre, Sullivan often followed suit and produced phrases of simple repetition, such as in \"Love Is a Plaintive Song\" (Patience) and \"A Man Who Would Woo a Fair Maid\" (The Yeomen of the Guard).Hughes, p. 125 Sullivan preferred to write in major keys, overwhelmingly in the Savoy operas, and even in his serious works.Hughes, p. 52 Examples of his rare excursions into minor keys include the long E minor melody in the first movement of the Irish Symphony, \"Go Away, Madam\" in the Act I finale of Iolanthe (echoing Verdi and Beethoven) and the execution march in the Act I finale of The Yeomen of the Guard. ===Harmony and counterpoint=== Sullivan was trained in the classical style, and contemporary music did not greatly attract him.Hughes, p. 44 Harmonically his early works used the conventional formulae of early- nineteenth-century composers including Mendelssohn, Auber, Donizetti, Balfe and Schubert.Hughes, pp. 44 and 49 Hughes comments that harmonic contrast in the Savoy works is enhanced by Sullivan's characteristic modulation between keys, as in \"Expressive Glances\" (Princess Ida), where he negotiates smoothly E major, C sharp minor and C major, or \"Then One of Us will Be a Queen\" (The Gondoliers), where he writes in F major, D flat major and D minor.Hughes, p. 59 When reproached for using consecutive fifths in Cox and Box, Sullivan replied \"if 5ths turn up it doesn't matter, so long as there is no offence to the ear.\" Both HughesHughes, p. 48 and Jacobs in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians comment adversely on Sullivan's overuse of tonic pedals, usually in the bass, which Hughes attributes to \"lack of enterprise or even downright laziness\". Another Sullivan trademark criticised by Hughes is the repeated use of the chord of the augmented fourth at moments of pathos.Hughes, pp. 47\u201348 In his serious works, Sullivan attempted to avoid harmonic devices associated with the Savoy operas, with the result, according to Hughes, that The Golden Legend is a \"hotch-potch of harmonic styles\".Hughes, p. 66 alt=Excerpt of music \u2013 part of \"I Am So Proud\" One of Sullivan's best-known devices is what Jacobs terms his \"'counterpoint of characters': the presentation by different personages of two seemingly independent tunes which later come together\" simultaneously. He was not the first composer to combine themes in this way, but in Jacobs's phrase it became almost \"the trademark of Sullivan's operetta style\".Hughes, p. 78 Sometimes the melodies were for solo voices, as in \"I Am So Proud\" (The Mikado), which combines three melodic lines.Hughes, pp. 79 and 81\u201382 Other examples are in choruses, where typically a graceful tune for the women is combined with a robust one for the men. Examples include \"When the Foeman Bares his Steel\" (The Pirates of Penzance), \"In a Doleful Train\" (Patience) and \"Welcome, Gentry\" (Ruddigore).Hughes, pp. 79\u201380 In \"How Beautifully Blue the Sky\" (The Pirates of Penzance), one theme is given to the chorus (in 2/4 time) and the other to solo voices (in 3/4).Rees, p. 80 Sullivan rarely composed fugues. Examples are from the \"Epilogue\" to The Golden Legend and Victoria and Merrie England.Hughes, pp. 73\u201374 In the Savoy operas, fugal style is reserved for making fun of legal solemnity in Trial by Jury and Iolanthe (e.g., the Lord Chancellor's leitmotif in the latter). Less formal counterpoint is employed in numbers such as \"Brightly Dawns Our Wedding Day\" (The Mikado) and \"When the Buds Are Blossoming\" (Ruddigore).Hughes, p. 75 ===Orchestration=== Hughes concludes his chapter on Sullivan's orchestration: \"[I]n this vitally important sector of the composer's art he deserves to rank as a master.\"Hughes, p. 118 Sullivan was a competent player of at least four orchestral instruments (flute, clarinet, trumpet and trombone) and technically a most skilful orchestrator. Though sometimes inclined to indulge in grandiosity when writing for a full symphony orchestra, he was adept in using smaller forces to the maximum effect.Hughes, pp. 96\u201397 Young writes that orchestral players generally like playing Sullivan's music: \"Sullivan never asked his players to do what was either uncongenial or impracticable.\"Young, p. 178Hughes, p. 96 Sullivan's orchestra for the Savoy operas was typical of the theatre orchestra of his era: 2 flutes (+ piccolo), oboe, 2 clarinets, bassoon, 2 horns, 2 cornets, 2 trombones, timpani, percussion and strings. According to Geoffrey Toye, the number of players in Sullivan's Savoy Theatre orchestras was a \"minimum\" of 31.Seeley, Paul. \"Authentic Sullivan\", Opera, November 2016, p. 1372; and \"The Savoy Opera Revival\", The Observer, 28 September 1919 Sullivan argued hard for an increase in the pit orchestra's size, and, starting with The Yeomen of the Guard, the orchestra was augmented with a second bassoon and a second tenor trombone.Hughes, p. 108 He generally orchestrated each score at almost the last moment, noting that the accompaniment for an opera had to wait until he saw the staging, so that he could judge how heavily or lightly to orchestrate each part of the music.Findon, p. 107 For his large-scale orchestral pieces, which often employed very large forces, Sullivan added a second oboe part, sometimes double bassoon and bass clarinet, more horns, trumpets, tuba, and occasionally an organ and/or a harp.Eden and Saremba, Appendix: The orchestration of Sullivan's major works One of the most recognisable features in Sullivan's orchestration is his woodwind scoring. Hughes especially notes Sullivan's clarinet writing, exploiting all registers and colours of the instrument, and his particular fondness for oboe solos. For instance, the Irish Symphony contains two long solo oboe passages in succession, and in the Savoy operas there are many shorter examples.Hughes, p. 104 In the operas, and also in concert works, another characteristic Sullivan touch is his fondness for pizzicato passages for the string sections. Hughes instances \"Kind Sir, You Cannot Have the Heart\" (The Gondoliers), \"Free From his Fetters Grim\" (The Yeomen of the Guard) and \"In Vain to Us You Plead\" (Iolanthe).Hughes, p. 117 ===Musical quotations and parodies=== alt=Head and shoulders of Sullivan as a young man, wearing a moustache, long sideburns and a serious expression Throughout the Savoy operas, and occasionally in other works, Sullivan quotes or imitates well-known themes or parodies the styles of famous composers.Cooper, Martin. \"Sullivan\", Opera News, April 1960, pp. 8\u201312 On occasion he may have echoed his predecessors unconsciously: Hughes cites a Handelian influence in \"Hereupon We're Both Agreed\" (The Yeomen of the Guard), and Rodney Milnes called \"Sighing Softly\" in The Pirates of Penzance \"a song plainly inspired by \u2013 and indeed worthy of \u2013 Sullivan's hero, Schubert\".Hughes, p. 152Milnes, Rodney. \"Putting the Jolly in Roger\", The Times, 26 April 2001, Section 2, p. 20 Edward Greenfield found a theme in the slow movement of the Irish Symphony \"an outrageous crib\" from Schubert's Unfinished Symphony.Greenfield, Edward. \"Sullivan \u2013 Symphony in E major\", The Gramophone, February 1969, p. 61 In early pieces, Sullivan drew on Mendelssohn's style in his music for The Tempest, Auber's in his Henry VIII music and Gounod's in The Light of the World.De Ternant, Andrew. \"Debussy and Others on Sullivan\", The Musical Times, 1 December 1924, pp. 1089\u201390 The influence of Mendelssohn pervades the fairy music in Iolanthe.Hughes, pp. 46\u201347 and 152 The Golden Legend shows the influence of Liszt and Wagner.Young, p. 221; and Burton, Nigel. \"100 Years of a Legend\", The Musical Times, 1 October 1986 pp. 554\u201357 Sullivan adopted traditional musical forms, such as madrigals in The Mikado, Ruddigore and The Yeomen of the Guard and glees in H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado, and the Venetian barcarolle in The Gondoliers. He made use of dance styles to enhance the sense of time or place in various scenes: gavottes in Ruddigore and The Gondoliers;Hughes, pp. 144\u201345 a country dance in The Sorcerer; a nautical hornpipe in Ruddigore; and the Spanish cachucha and Italian saltarello and tarantella in The Gondoliers. Occasionally he drew on influences from further afield. In The Mikado, he used an old Japanese war song, and his 1882 trip to Egypt inspired musical styles in his later opera The Rose of Persia.\"The Rose of Persia; Or, the Story-teller and the Slave\", The Era, 2 December 1899, p. 14 Elsewhere, Sullivan wrote undisguised parody. Of the sextet \"I Hear the Soft Note\" in Patience, he said to the singers, \"I think you will like this. It is Dr. Arne and Purcell at their best.\" In his comic operas, he followed Offenbach's lead in lampooning the idioms of French and Italian opera, such as those of Donizetti, Bellini and Verdi.Hughes, pp. 150\u201351; and Jacobs, p. 52 Examples of his operatic parody include Mabel's aria \"Poor Wand'ring One\" in The Pirates of Penzance, the duet \"Who Are You, Sir?\" from Cox and Box,Hughes, pp. 151 and 80 and the whispered plans for elopement in \"This Very Night\" in H.M.S. Pinafore, parodying the conspirators' choruses in Verdi's Il trovatore and Rigoletto.Scherer, Barrymore Laurence. \"Gilbert & Sullivan, Parody's Patresfamilias\", The Wall Street Journal, 23 June 2011, accessed 19 December 2017 The mock-jingoistic \"He Is an Englishman\" in H.M.S. Pinafore and choral passages in The Zoo satirise patriotic British tunes such as Arne's \"Rule, Britannia!\". The chorus \"With Catlike Tread\" from The Pirates parodies Verdi's \"Anvil Chorus\" from Il trovatore.Hughes, pp. 150\u201351 Hughes calls Bouncer's song in Cox and Box \"a jolly Handelian parody\" and notes a strong Handelian flavour to Arac's song in Act III of Princess Ida. In \"A More Humane Mikado\", at the words \"Bach interwoven with Spohr and Beethoven\", the clarinet and bassoon quote the fugue subject of Bach's Fantasia and Fugue in G minor.Hughes, p. 109 Sullivan sometimes used Wagnerian leitmotifs for both comic and dramatic effect. In Iolanthe, a distinctive four-note theme is associated with the title character, the Lord Chancellor has a fugal motif, and the Fairy Queen's music parodies that of Wagner heroines such as Br\u00fcnnhilde.Williams, p. 217 In The Yeomen of the Guard the Tower of London is evoked by its own motif.Hughes, p. 143 This use of the leitmotif technique is repeated and developed further in Ivanhoe.Young, p. 223 ==Reputation and criticism== ===Early reception=== Sullivan's critical reputation has undergone extreme changes since the 1860s when critics, struck by his potential, hailed him as the long-awaited great English composer.Jacobs, pp. 28 and 42 His incidental music to The Tempest was received with acclaim at the Crystal Palace, just before his 20th birthday, in April 1862. The Athenaeum commented: Punch (1880)|alt=Mocking newspaper cartoon showing Sullivan wearing a \"pinafore\" apron, standing en pointe in a violin case while conducting, surrounded by corrupted paraphernalia relating to his early comic operas, over the sardonic song title \"When Arthur First at Court Began\" His Irish Symphony of 1866 won similarly enthusiastic praise, but as Arthur Jacobs notes, \"The first rapturous outburst of enthusiasm for Sullivan as an orchestral composer did not last.\"Jacobs, p. 48 A comment typical of those that followed him throughout his career was that \"Sullivan's unquestionable talent should make him doubly careful not to mistake popular applause for artistic appreciation.\"Jacobs, p. 49 When Sullivan turned to comic opera with Gilbert, the serious critics began to express disapproval. The music critic Peter Gammond writes of \"misapprehensions and prejudices, delivered to our door by the Victorian firm Musical Snobs Ltd. ... frivolity and high spirits were sincerely seen as elements that could not be exhibited by anyone who was to be admitted to the sanctified society of Art.\"Gammond, p. 137 As early as 1877 The London Figaro commented that Sullivan \"wilfully throws his opportunity away. ... He possesses all the natural ability to have given us an English opera, and, instead, he affords us a little more-or-less excellent fooling.\"The London Figaro, quoted in Allen, pp. 49\u201350 Few critics denied the excellence of Sullivan's theatre scores. The Theatre commented, \"Iolanthe sustains Dr. Sullivan's reputation as the most spontaneous, fertile, and scholarly composer of comic opera this country has ever produced.\"Beatty- Kingston, William. The Theatre, 1 January 1883, p. 28 Comic opera, no matter how skilfully crafted, was viewed as an intrinsically lower form of art than oratorio. The Athenaeum's review of The Martyr of Antioch declared: \"[I]t is an advantage to have the composer of H.M.S. Pinafore occupying himself with a worthier form of art.\"25 October 1880, quoted in Jacobs, p. 149 ===Knighthood and later years=== Sullivan's knighthood in 1883 gave the serious music critics further ammunition. The Musical Review of that year observed: Even Sullivan's friend George Grove wrote: \"Surely the time has come when so able and experienced a master of voice, orchestra, and stage effect \u2013 master, too, of so much genuine sentiment \u2013 may apply his gifts to a serious opera on some subject of abiding human or natural interest.\"Grove, George. \"Sullivan, Arthur Seymour\" Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, London 1879\u201389, p. 762, quoted in Sarema, Meinhard. \"In the Purgatory of Tradition: Arthur Sullivan and the English Musical Renaissance\", Deutsche Sullivan Gesellschaft, 2000, accessed 10 December 2017 Sullivan finally redeemed himself in critical eyes with The Golden Legend in 1886.Stanford, pp. 161\u201363 The Observer hailed it as a \"triumph of English art\".\"Leeds Music Festival\", The Observer, 17 October 1886, p. 6 The World called it \"one of the greatest creations we have had for many years. Original, bold, inspired, grand in conception, in execution, in treatment, it is a composition which will make an 'epoch' and which will carry the name of its composer higher on the wings of fame and glory. ... The effect of the public performance was unprecedented.\"Quoted in Harris, p. IV Hopes for a new departure were expressed in The Daily Telegraph's review of The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), Sullivan's most serious opera to that point: \"[T]he music follows the book to a higher plane, and we have a genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage.\"Quoted in Allen, p. 312 Sullivan's only grand opera, Ivanhoe (1891), received generally favourable reviews,Dailey, pp. 129\u201333 although J. A. Fuller Maitland, in The Times, expressed reservations, writing that the opera's \"best portions rise so far above anything else that Sir Arthur Sullivan has given to the world, and have such force and dignity, that it is not difficult to forget the drawbacks which may be found in the want of interest in much of the choral writing, and the brevity of the concerted solo parts.\"Quoted in Jacobs, p. 331 Sullivan's 1897 ballet Victoria and Merrie England was one of several late pieces that won praise from most critics:\"Sir Arthur Sullivan's New Ballet\", The Daily News, 26 May 1897, p. 8; \"Alhambra Theatre\", The Morning Post, 26 May 1897, p. 7; \"Sir Arthur Sullivan's New Ballet 'Victoria'\", The Manchester Guardian, 26 May 1897, p. 7; \"Music\", The Illustrated London News, 29 May 1897, p. 730; and \"Victoria And Merrie England\", The Era, 29 May 1897, p. 8 Although the more solemn members of the musical establishment could not forgive Sullivan for writing music that was both comic and accessible, he was, nevertheless, \"the nation's de facto composer laureate\".Maine, Basil. \"Elgar, Sir Edward William\", 1949, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography archive, accessed 20 April 2010 His obituary in The Times called him England's \"most conspicuous composer ... the musician who had such power to charm all classes. ... The critic and the student found new beauties at every fresh hearing. What ... set Sullivan in popular esteem far above all the other English composers of his day was the tunefulness of his music, that quality in it by which ... [it] was immediately recognized as a joyous contribution to the gaiety of life. ... Sullivan\u2019s name stood as a synonym for music in England. ===Posthumous reputation=== {|align=right | |} In the decade after his death, Sullivan's reputation sank considerably among music critics. In 1901 Fuller Maitland took issue with the generally laudatory tone of the obituaries: \"Is there anywhere a case quite parallel to that of Sir Arthur Sullivan, who began his career with a work which at once stamped him as a genius, and to the height of which he only rarely attained throughout life? ... It is because such great natural gifts \u2013 gifts greater, perhaps, than fell to any English musician since ... Purcell \u2013 were so very seldom employed in work worthy of them.\"Fuller Maitland, J. A. \"Obituary\", Cornhill Magazine, March 1901, pp. 300\u201309 Edward Elgar, to whom Sullivan had been particularly kind,Young, p. 264 rose to Sullivan's defence, branding Fuller Maitland's obituary \"the shady side of musical criticism ... that foul unforgettable episode\".Quoted in Young, p. 264 alt=Drawing of a grandfather, father and boy, all dressed for the theatre, sitting in happy anticipation, over the caption \"The Joy of Three Generations (To be seen any night at the Gilbert and Sullivan Operas)\" Fuller Maitland's followers, including Ernest Walker, also dismissed Sullivan as \"merely the idle singer of an empty evening\".Hughes, p. 6 As late as 1966 Frank Howes, a music critic for The Times, condemned Sullivan for a \"lack of sustained effort ... a fundamental lack of seriousness towards his art [and] inability to perceive the smugness, the sentimentality and banality of the Mendelssohnian detritus ... to remain content with the flattest and most obvious rhythms, this yielding to a fatal facility, that excludes Sullivan from the ranks of the good composers.\"Howes, p. 54 Thomas Dunhill wrote in 1928 that Sullivan's \"music has suffered in an extraordinary degree from the vigorous attacks which have been made upon it in professional circles. These attacks have succeeded in surrounding the composer with a kind of barricade of prejudice which must be swept away before justice can be done to his genius.\"Dunhill 1928, p. 13 Sir Henry Wood continued to perform Sullivan's serious music.\"Sir Henry Wood Jubilee Concert at Albert Hall\", The Times, 6 October 1938, p. 10 In 1942 Wood presented a Sullivan centenary concert at the Royal Albert Hall, but it was not until the 1960s that Sullivan's music other than the Savoy operas began to be widely revived. In 1960 Hughes published the first full-length book about Sullivan's music \"which, while taking note of his weaknesses (which are many) and not hesitating to castigate his lapses from good taste (which were comparatively rare) [attempted] to view them in perspective against the wider background of his sound musicianship.\" The work of the Sir Arthur Sullivan Society, founded in 1977, and books about Sullivan by musicians such as Young (1971) and Jacobs (1986) contributed to the re-evaluation of Sullivan's serious music. The Irish Symphony had its first professional recording in 1968, and many of Sullivan's non-Gilbert works have since been recorded.Shepherd, Marc. \"Discography of Sir Arthur Sullivan\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 10 July 2010, accessed 5 October 2014 Scholarly critical editions of an increasing number of Sullivan's works have been published. In 1957 a review in The Times explained Sullivan's contributions to \"the continued vitality of the Savoy operas\": \"Gilbert's lyrics ... take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music. ... [Sullivan, too, is] a delicate wit, whose airs have a precision, a neatness, a grace, and a flowing melody\".\"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan: Operas of an Artificial World\", The Times, 14 February 1957, p. 5 A 2000 article in The Musical Times by Nigel Burton noted the resurgence of Sullivan's reputation beyond the comic operas: ==Recordings== alt=Poster advertising, in plain type, a recording of The Mikado On 14 August 1888 George Gouraud introduced Thomas Edison's phonograph to London in a press conference, including the playing of a piano and cornet recording of Sullivan's \"The Lost Chord\", one of the first recordings of music ever made.\"Historic Sullivan Recordings\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 28 July 2018 At a party on 5 October 1888 given to demonstrate the technology, Sullivan recorded a speech to be sent to Edison, saying, in part: \"I am astonished and somewhat terrified at the result of this evening's experiments: astonished at the wonderful power you have developed, and terrified at the thought that so much hideous and bad music may be put on record forever. But all the same I think it is the most wonderful thing that I have ever experienced, and I congratulate you with all my heart on this wonderful discovery.\" These recordings were found in the Edison Library in New Jersey in the 1950s: The first commercial recordings of Sullivan's music, beginning in 1898, were of individual numbers from the Savoy operas. In 1917 the Gramophone Company (HMV) produced the first album of a complete Gilbert and Sullivan opera, The Mikado, followed by eight more.Rollins and Witts, Appendix pp. x\u2013xi; and Shepherd, Marc. \"The First D'Oyly Carte Recordings\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 5 October 2014 Electrical recordings of most of the operas issued by HMV and Victor followed from the 1920s, supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte.Rollins and Witts, Appendix, pp. xi\u2013xiii; and Shepherd, Marc. \"G&S; Discography: The Electrical Era\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 5 October 2014 The D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce recordings until 1979.Shepherd, Marc. \"The D'Oyly Carte Stereo Recordings\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 24 December 2003, accessed 5 October 2014 After the copyrights expired, recordings were made by opera companies such as Gilbert and Sullivan for AllShepherd, Marc. \"The Gilbert and Sullivan for All recordings\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 8 September 2011, accessed 5 October 2014 and Australian Opera, and Sir Malcolm SargentShepherd, Marc. \"G&S; Discography: The Stereo Era\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 18 November 2001, accessed 5 October 2014 and Sir Charles Mackerras each conducted audio sets of several Savoy operas.Shepherd, Marc. \"G&S; Discography: The Digital Era\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 27 August 2002, accessed 5 October 2014Shepherd, Marc. \"G&S; on Film, TV and Video\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 November 2001, accessed 5 October 2014 Since 1994, the International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival has released professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions and other Sullivan recordings,\"DVDs\", International Gilbert and Sullivan Festival, accessed 10 December 2017 and Ohio Light Opera has recorded several of the operas in the 21st century.Shepherd, Marc. \"The Ohio Light Opera Recordings\", the Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, 18 April 2010, accessed 2 December 2017 Sullivan's non-Savoy works were infrequently recorded until the 1960s.
