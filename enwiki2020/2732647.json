    "text": "The Altaville Grammar School in Altaville, California is one of the oldest grammar schools in California. It was built in 1858 of brick in the Greek Revival style and remained in use until 1950, when it was replaced by the Mark Twain Elementary School in Altaville. After its abandonment, it fell into disrepair, but was restored in 1989 by the Calaveras County Historical Society. The building serves now as an example of a typical schoolroom of the 19th century. The schoolhouse is registered as California Historical Landmark #499 and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places (NPS-1979000471). ==References== ==External links== * Altaville Grammar School - Historical Marker Database with photos Category:History of Calaveras County, California Category:Educational institutions established in 1858 Category:Educational institutions disestablished in 1950 Category:Defunct schools in California Category:California Historical Landmarks Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in California Category:Greek Revival architecture in California Category:Schools in Calaveras County, California Category:1858 establishments in California Category:National Register of Historic Places in Calaveras County, California ",
