    "text": "Tesco has expanded its operations outside the UK to 11 other countries in the world. Tesco pulled out of the USA in 2013, but continues to see growth elsewhere. Sam Pointer's international expansion strategy (Operating in Birkenhead) has responded to the need to be sensitive to local expectations in other countries by entering into joint ventures with local partners, such as Samsung Group in South Korea (Samsung-Tesco Home plus), and Charoen Pokphand in Thailand (Tesco Lotus), appointing a very high proportion of local personnel to management positions. It also makes small acquisitions as part of its strategy: for example, in its 2005/2006 financial year it made acquisitions in South Korea, one in Poland and one in Japan. In late 2004 the amount of floorspace Tesco operated outside the United Kingdom surpassed the amount it had in its home market for the first time, although the United Kingdom still accounted for more than 75% of group revenue due to lower sales per unit area outside the UK. In September 2005 Tesco announced that it was selling its operations in Taiwan to Carrefour and purchasing Carrefour's stores in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both companies stated that they were concentrating their efforts in countries where they had strong market positions. ==Overview of operations== The following table shows the number of stores, total store size in area and sales for Tesco's international operations.

In December 2006 it raised its stake to 90% in a \u00a3180 million deal. Most of Tesco China's stores are based around Shanghai, but according to Tesco it plans to equip the business to expand more quickly and in different areas. Tesco has a large store in Weifang, Shandong province, and a further two floor store in Taizhou, Jiangsu province. The Tesco in Taizhou offers imported beers and spirits, some imported wines, and Australian, French, Italian and Dutch cheese products.

Tesco has been increasing its own brand products into the Chinese market as well as introducing the Tesco Express format. In May 2014 Tesco made a deal with the state-run China Resources Enterprise (CRE) to create a joint venture, combining Tesco's 131 stores in the country with CRE's nearly 3000 outlets.

Tesco's South Korean discount store chain, Home Plus, currently has 66 outlets. In September 2015 the company was sold to MBK Partners, a South Korean buyout firm, which partnered with a Canadian pension fund and Singapore's Temasek Holdings in a transaction worth 4.2 billion pounds. === Taiwan === In September 2005 Tesco announced that it was selling its operations in Taiwan to Carrefour and purchasing Carrefour's stores in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. Both companies stated that they were concentrating their efforts in countries where they had strong market positions. === Thailand === Tesco-Lotus superstore in Sakon Nakon, Thailand. Shoppers have to pass through a checkpoint before entering the premises. Tesco entered Thailand in 1998 and operates through 380 stores as part of a joint venture with Charoen Pokphand and named the operation \"Tesco Lotus\". This partnership was dissolved in 2003 when Charoen Pokphand sold its shares to Tesco. Tesco Lotus sells a diverse range of products from value food products to electronics to personal finance services. The company is keen to promote its green values and has partnered with the UNEP. Tesco Lotus claims to serve 20 million customers every month and that 97% of its goods are sourced from Thailand. By March 2013, Thailand operations were generating \u00a33 billion in revenues and were one of the company's largest businesses outside of the UK. Tesco agreed to sell its Thai business to Charoen Pokphand Group for $10.6bn, including debt. A transaction that would be expected to be completed in the second half of 2020. == Turkey == Tesco entered Turkey in 2003 and uses the trading name \"Tesco Kipa\".

The company established its U.S. headquarters in El Segundo, California, and the first store opened in Hemet, California in November 2007, with 100 more planned in the first year; a store opening every two-and-a-half days. Although the planned rate of expansion was not maintained, largely because of the recession, as of August 2011 Fresh & Easy operated 182 stores across Arizona, California and Nevada. In April 2013, Tesco put the Fresh & Easy chain on sale, booking losses of \u00a31.2bn. It announced the sale of 150 of the stores in the 200 strong chain to private equity firm Yucaipa Companies in September 2013. The BBC reported that the remaining stores were expected to close.
