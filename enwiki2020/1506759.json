    "text": "The United Nations Secretariat Building is a tall skyscraper and the centerpiece of the headquarters of the United Nations, in the Turtle Bay/East Midtown neighborhood of Manhattan in New York City. The lot where the building stands is considered to be under United Nations jurisdiction, although it remains geopolitically located within the United States. It is the first skyscraper in New York City to use a curtain wall. ==History== The groundbreaking ceremony for the Secretariat Building occurred on September 14, 1948. A consortium of four contracting companies from Manhattan and Queens were selected to construct the Secretariat Building as part of a $30 million contract. The 39-story Secretariat Building was completed in 1950, making it the first new structure at the UN Headquarters. Staff started moving in as early as August of that year and it was fully occupied by June, 1951. The building was designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer and the Swiss- French architect Le Corbusier. One notable feature outside the building is a circular pool with a decorative fountain in its centre, which was a gift from the children of the United States, paid for by small donations in schools from all across the country. This building is connected to the Conference Building to the north that houses the General Assembly, the Security Council, among others, and a library building to the south. The building houses the administrative functions of the UN, including day-to-day duties such as finance and translation. As part of the UN complex, the building is subject to an agreement between the United Nations and its host country, the United States.Agreement between the United Nations and the United States regarding the headquarters of the UN , retrieved 2014-11-01. The UN Secretariat Building was renovated starting in May 2010, and reopened in phases with the first occupants moving in July 2012. On October 29, 2012, the basement of the UN complex was flooded due to Hurricane Sandy, leading to a three-day closure and the relocation of several offices. ==Influence== The building style has inspired some notable copies, including the Headquarters of South Lanarkshire Council in Hamilton, Scotland, known locally as the \"County Buildings\". It also inspired the construction of other curtain wall buildings in Manhattan, such as the Lever House, Corning Glass Building, and Springs Mills Building. == Gallery == File:Dag Hammarskjold outside the UN building.jpg|The 2nd Secretary-General of the United Nations, Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld in front of the building File:UN Emblem and Headquarters.jpg|Illustration of the Secretariat Building on a 1975 Brazilian stamp File:Calm (235467517).jpeg|View of the building at dusk File:UN Headquarter Facade 2005-04-29.jpg|Building facade ==See also== * List of tallest buildings in New York City * Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld Library == References == == Further reading == * == External links == * UN Visitors Centre * @ Category:1952 establishments in New York (state) Category:Buildings associated with the Rockefeller family Category:Headquarters of the United Nations Category:Le Corbusier buildings Category:Modernist architecture in New York City Category:Office buildings completed in 1952 Category:Oscar Niemeyer buildings Category:Skyscraper office buildings in Manhattan ",
