    "text": "Self Destruction Blues is the third album by the Finnish rock band Hanoi Rocks, released in 1982. Although often listed as a studio album, Self Destruction Blues is a compilation of singles and B-sides that the band recorded in 1981 and 1982. None of the tracks on Self Destruction Blues, however, appear on their previous albums. Guns N' Roses were rumoured to have recorded a cover version of \"Beer and a Cigarette\" for their 1993 release \"The Spaghetti Incident?\". Of note is the fact that although Gyp Casino plays on the LP, his replacement Razzle actually appears on the cover. \"Dead By X-Mas\" has been covered by the Japanese hardcore band The Piass in 1994, the US punk band The Hillstreet Stranglers in 2005, US punk band The Murder City Devils, the British electro group Sohodolls in 2007 and the Finnish rockabilly band Big Daddy & Rockin\u2019 Combo in 2008. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== * Michael Monroe \u2013 vocals, sax, drums on #15 * Andy McCoy \u2013 guitars * Nasty Suicide \u2013 guitars * Sam Yaffa \u2013 bass * Gyp Casino \u2013 drums on #1, #3-4 and #6-14 ==Additional musicians== * Razzle \u2013 vocals on #15 * Keimo Hirvonen \u2013 drums on #2 and #5 ==Chart positions== ===Album=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !!
