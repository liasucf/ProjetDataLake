It was a ship of 180 tons of weight built in wood, with an engine of steam of 80 horses propelled by lateral wheels. Originally the ship made the trips between Montevideo - Buenos Aires and Corumb\u00e1 with stops in several ports of the Littoral. It was owned by the shipping companies Bernal & C\u00e1rrega and Matty & Company, owned by Guillermo Matti. His capture by the Paraguayan Navy unleashed the War of the Triple Alliance. The Marqu\u00eas de Olinda was equipped with eight cannons, and took part in the capture of several enemy ships. It also served as an escort of Francisco Solano L\u00f3pez, towards the Fortress of Humait\u00e1. The Vapor Marqu\u00eas de Olinda was sunk in Argentine waters during the Battle of the Riachuelo on June 11, 1865. == Gallery == File:Plano da batalha naval do Riachuelo, dada a 11 de Junho de 1865.JPG|Map of the Riachuelo Naval Battle.
