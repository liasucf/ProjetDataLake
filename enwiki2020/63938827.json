    "text": "The Very Reverend William Gowan Todd, D.D. (1820-1877) was a nineteenth- century author and cleric. In the later years of his life he founded and managed St. Mary's Orphanage, Blackheath, England, where he died on 24 July 1877. == Early life == The son of physician and president of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland (RCSI) Charles Hawkes Todd (1784\u20131826) and Elizabeth Bentley (1786\u20131862), William was born on 1820 in Dublin, Ireland. He is the eleventh of fifteen children and the brother of James Henthorn Todd, Robert Bentley Todd, and Armstrong Todd. In 1831, Ireland experienced an epidemic of Asiatic cholera, which killed 5,632 people in Dublin and over 50,000 in Ireland. It also nearly killed William Todd and his mother, Elizabeth. There is unconfirmed evidence that William married. It is said that after he completed his doctor in theology in Rome, his wife joined a religious order. == Professional life == William Todd took holy orders in the Church of Ireland. With the help of his brother, Rev. James Henthorn Todd, William published two books: * The Church of St. Patrick: A Historical Inquiry into the Independence of the Ancient Church of Ireland (1844) * A History of the Ancient Church of Ireland (1845) William earned an A.B. from Trinity College in Dublin and was working on his doctorate. About 1845, Todd left the Anglican Church and joined the Roman Catholic Church. The motivation to change from Anglican to Roman Catholic was influenced by his oldest brother's colleague John Henry Newman and the Oxford Movement. Newman published a document called, \"Remarks on Certain Passages in the Thirty-Nine Articles,\" or Tract 90. Newman's argument centered on the idea that the identity of the Church of England was more Catholic than Protestant. While William's departure from the church created discord among Anglo-Irish Protestant family members, his older brother James had leanings in the same direction. Under the guidance of John Henry Newman, William transferred to Rome to complete his Doctor of Divinity. He subsequently became a Roman Catholic priest. His calling took him to the poorest parishes in London and London's Blackheath district1861 England Census, Greenwich West. District 17. Page 12 of 361871 England Census. Greenwich West.
