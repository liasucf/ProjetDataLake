Hybrids of Harding grass and reed canary grass have been produced. Varieties include 'AQ1', 'Uneta', and 'Australis'. ==Geography== Phalaris aquatica originated from Southern Europe and the Caucasus. It is now naturalized in South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and the USA.Heuz\u00e9 V., Tran G., Boudon A., Lebas F., 2017. Bulbous canary grass (Phalaris aquatica).

The grass can also be cut, providing good quality fodder for grazing livestock for 8 to 12 months a year. ==Toxicity== Some Phalaris species contain gramine, which can cause brain damage, other organ damage, central nervous system damage and death in sheep although Phalaris aquatica is said to be non- toxic.http://www.regional.org.au/au/asa/1996/contributed/450oram.htm A raw, dried plant Phalaris aquatica contains approximately 0.1% DMT, 0.022% 5-MeO- DMT, and 0.005% bufotenin.Phalaris / DMT FAQ A particular strain of P. aquatica from Italy, labeled 'AQ-1', was reported to contain in excess of 1.0% alkaloid concentration.Phalaris: Some of the many strains of interest. Seeds In Victoria, Australia, it is reported that kangaroos grazing on Phalaris aquatica may develop a condition known familiarly as 'Phalaris staggers', where coordination and mobility are affected.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-21/grass-to-blame-for-staggering- kangaroos/9886884 ==Invasive species== Harding grass is an invasive species in grassland, oak woodland, chaparral, and riparian habitats.
