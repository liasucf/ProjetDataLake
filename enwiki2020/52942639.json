The story revolves around five different people from five totally different backgrounds and their faith and conviction. It highlights the concept of how the Creator rewards the people who believe in hard work and patience. It depicts the story of a young landlord, Shahzeb (Mikaal Zulfiqar), who once saw Nazneen Malik (Kubra Khan) at her sister's wedding and fell in love with her. Nazneen happens to be the spoiled child of Hashmat Malik (Usman Peerzada). At the same wedding, Nazneen insults Shamu (Imran Ashraf) and his ensemble, who were invited by her parents to perform a dance. Nazi insults them for being transgenders, after which Shammu curses her so that one day she will lose all her fate. Meanwhile, the story depicts the life of Rani, (Ushna Shah) a street beggar, who is forced to bring the money she earns to her father (Saife Hassan). She believes in human equality and once saved Shamu from mocking goons, which left him in love with her. One day, Rani comes across a beautiful place where a florist tells her about the beauty and fate of the town's well-known woman,'Nigar Begum' (Sana Nawaz). This fascinates Rani, who constantly prays to be like her one day. It is revealed that Nigar Begum is a head courtesan who shelters homeless girls in her brothel. It's revealed, in flashbacks, that Shahzeb was once forced by his friends to see Nigar Begum's Mujra dance. Despite going there because of his friends insistence, Shahzeb wasn't the least bit interested, which made Nigar fall in love with him. He rejects her love and insults her, after which a heartbroken Nigar curses him so that one day he will be rejected in the same way. Rani's father decides to get her married to Rasheed who would in-turn pay him extra Mahr Payment. In order to stop begging and to avoid her father's command to marry, Rani decides to fulfil her only dream of becoming like Nigar Begum. She visits Nigar and asks her to keep her as her maid, thinking that she will live a life better than that of a beggar. Rani rejects Shamu's love, insults him for being a transgender and approaches Nigar Begum, keeping in mind that once she has arrived - she can never go back. Facing her rejection, Shamu is left heartbroken and decides to earn a decent living, thus joining a local barbershop. Nigar Begum keeps Rani as her maid and renames her, Reena Begum. Shahzeb takes his marriage proposal for Nazneen to her father and gets engaged, while she isn't interested in marrying him. Later, she opens up about her wish to study so she's sent to Lahore with Shahzeb's consent and her parents consider Basit her guardian. With time, Shahzeb begins questioning himself and God about why Nazneen doesn't love him back. As his questions cause him to face religious confusion, he regularly visits an Islamic Molvi (Qavi Khan) whose knowledge and words help him. Shamu becomes a popular hairstylist where as Rani starts to realise that her life hasn't changed the way she imagined. Nazneen falls in love with Basit, who holds his parents' respect as his highest priority. ==Cast== 395px ===Main cast=== * Meekal Zulfiqar as Shahzeb Shah * Kubra Khan as Nazneen Malik * Ushna Shah as Reena Begum * Shehzad Sheikh as Basit Ali * Imran Ashraf as Shammo * Sana Nawaz as Nigar Begum * Qavi Khan as Ahmad Shah Bukhari (Baba Sain) ===Supporting cast=== * Usman Peerzada as Hashmat Malik * Ainy Zaidi as Malkani * Naeema Khan as Chaman Begum * Azra Mansoor as Zaitoon * Nargis Rasheed as Rani's mother * Omar Shehzad as Shaheer * Saife Hassan as Rani's father * Anas Ali Imran as Talha * Noor-ul-Hassan as Qadir Ali * Farhan Ali Agha as Nawazish Ali * Hassan Noman as Salma * Kinza Malik as Razia * Zahra Shah as Samina * Nimra Khan as Zimmal * Ali Ansari as Arsalan * Fazila Kaiser as Zimmil's mother * Kaiser Khan Nizamani as Zimmil's father * Seemi Pasha as Shaheer's mother * Zia Gurchani * Mahi Baloch as Fiza Bai * Muhammad Ali Josh as Taimoor * Nazish Jahangir as Roshni ==Production== ===Development=== Alif Allah Aur Insaan is developed by Hum TV's senior producer Momina Duraid of MD Productions, the channel hired director Ahson Talish to direct the series.

Rani reminded me of why I became an actor\" Speaking about her role Shah said \"Rani evolves a lot as she is an amalgamation of things: The walk was inspired by a lady who used to work in our house when I was a child; ironically her name was also Rani. The dialect was watching the working class growing up in Lahore. A lot of the mannerisms were things I observed in young girls begging on the street. So yes there was some character research involved at my end but everything else was thanks to the genius, Ahson Talish. He crafted the crassness of Rani beautifully, he created her.\" Alongside Shah, Lollywood film actress Sana Nawaz was approached by Mahesh Waswani for the role of Nigar Begum. The series was her second Hum TV project where she portrayed a challenging role, speaking about her character Nawaz says \"I play a character called Nigar, I really liked this role because it was very challenging and quite different from what I have done up till now ...
