    "text": "John Sidney Killen (February 5, 1826 - December 28, 1903) was a pioneer farmer and cattleman from Claiborne and Webster parishes in northwestern Louisiana, who served in the Louisiana House of Representatives for Claiborne Parish in 1871 during the term of the Reconstruction Governor Henry Clay Warmoth. ==Biographical sketch== Killen was in office only for a year, when he was succeeded by Frederick North. By 1874, W. W. Carloss, who had fought in the Siege of Port Hudson in 1863 had become the representative for Webster Parish, and two men named \"Morland\" and \"Price\" were representing Claiborne Parish. When Webster Parish was carved from Claiborne in 1871, Killen's farm fell within Webster Parish some ten miles to the north of the parish seat of Minden. A native of Darlington County in northeastern South Carolina, Killen came to Louisiana in 1849. In his late thirties, he fought with the Minden Rangers in the American Civil War. He and his wife, the former Sarah Ann Monzingo (1828\u20131913), a native of Houston County, Georgia, had four sons, all of whom died before the age of twelve and most earlier and four daughters who lived into adulthood. ==References== Category:1826 births Category:1903 deaths Category:People from Darlington County, South Carolina Category:People of Louisiana in the American Civil War Category:Politicians from Minden, Louisiana Category:Members of the Louisiana House of Representatives Category:Louisiana Democrats Category:Farmers from Louisiana Category:Ranchers from Louisiana Category:Baptists from Louisiana Category:Burials at Minden Cemetery ",
