    "text": "\"2 Minutes to Midnight\" is a song by the British heavy metal band Iron Maiden, featured on their fifth studio album, Powerslave (1984). It was released as the band's tenth single, and first from the album on 6 August 1984. It rose to number 11 on the UK Singles Chart and number 25 on Billboard Top Album Tracks. The band's first single to exceed five minutes in length, it remained their longest until the release of \"Infinite Dreams\" in November 1989. ==Synopsis== A protest song about nuclear war, \"2 Minutes to Midnight\" was written by Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson. The song attacks the commercialisation of war and how it is used to fuel the global economy (\u201cThe golden goose is on the loose and never out of season\u201d), how rich politicians profit directly from it (\u201cas the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy\u201d) and how after a war concludes, the world is left in a far worse condition than before the war began, resulting in future wars (\u201cto the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun\u201d). The song title references the Doomsday Clock, the symbolic clock used by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which represents a countdown to potential global catastrophe. In September 1953 the clock reached two minutes to midnight, the closest it ever got to midnight in the 20th Century,https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/# when the United States and Soviet Union tested H-bombs within nine months of one another. The atomic clock, set at 12 minutes to midnight in 1972, regressed thereafter among USSoviet tensions, reaching three minutes to midnight in 1984 \u2013 the year this track was released \u2013 and at that time the most dangerous clock reading since 1953. According to Dickinson, the song critically addresses \"the romance of war\" in general rather than the Cold War in particular. ===\"Rainbow's Gold\"=== The first B-side is a cover of British progressive rock band Beckett's \"Rainbow's Gold\", which was featured on their self-titled album released in 1974. The song was written by Terry Slesser and Kenny Mountain, respectively the band's vocalist and guitarist. On the original release, it is titled \"A Rainbow's Gold\". According to Nicko McBrain, commenting on the single in \"Listen With Nicko Part VI\" (as part of The First Ten Years series), the members of Iron Maiden were friends with members of Beckett. The band's manager, Rod Smallwood, commented this version: \"This was originally done by a band called Beckett who the band liked a lot. Adrian used to do a cover of another of their songs 'Rainclouds' in his band 'Evil Ways'. Beckett were from Newcastle and had a great singer called Terry Wilson Slesser (incidentally I was Beckett's agent prior to meeting Maiden).\" ===\"Mission From 'Arry\"=== Another B-side, entitled \"Mission from 'Arry\", is a recording of an argument between bassist Steve Harris and drummer Nicko McBrain, which took place after a show in Allentown, Pennsylvania, during the band's World Piece Tour. During the concert, Harris' bass gear broke down, so he asked the nearest roadie to tell McBrain to extend his drum solo. The crew member was unable to communicate the message effectively, which unfortunately distracted McBrain and had a negative impact on his solo, causing him to yell at the roadie afterwards. Vocalist Bruce Dickinson states that he found the ensuing argument so amusing that he decided to record it with a concealed tape recorder. ==Track listing== ;7\" single ;12\" single == Personnel == Production credits are adapted from the 7-inch vinyl, and 12-inch vinyl covers. ;Iron Maiden *Bruce Dickinson \u2013 lead vocals *Dave Murray \u2013 guitar *Adrian Smith \u2013 guitar *Steve Harris \u2013 bass guitar *Nicko McBrain \u2013 drums ;Production *Martin Birch \u2013 producer, engineer *Derek Riggs \u2013 cover illustration *Ross Halfin \u2013 photography ==Cover versions== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
