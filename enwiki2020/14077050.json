Spaendonck initially worked under artist Guillaume-Jacques Herreyns (1743\u20131827) in Antwerp, and in 1773 moved to Paris to study and work with his brother, floral painter G\u00e9rard van Spaendonck (1746\u20131822). From 1785 to 1800, Cornelis van Spaendonck was head of the porcelain works at S\u00e8vres. Due to difficulties encountered as an administrator, he was relieved of his directorship in 1800, but remained at S\u00e8vres as a designer and artist until 1808. M\u00e9lanie de Comol\u00e9ra was his pupil.Cornelis van Spaendonck in RKDimages In 1789 Spaendonck became a member of the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux Arts. He painted throughout his lifetime, displaying his works in the salons of Paris until 1833. Most of Spaendonck's works were created with oils and gouache, and he is remembered for his lush still-lifes of flowers. Among his paintings were subjects such as De Fleurs Et Fruits, Vase De Fleurs, Bouquet De Different Fleurs, Fleurs Du Jardin, Corbeille Fleurs, et al. At the time of his death in 1840 there were 29 paintings in his studio, works that were auctioned soon afterwards. == References == * Arader Galleries Still Life of Flowers in an Urn Category:1756 births Category:1839 deaths Category:People from Tilburg Category:19th-century Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Flower artists Category:18th-century Dutch painters ",
