John's mother, Lily, was half Swiss/German, and lived for most of her married life in the family house in Chlomos in Corfu. She and her husband Philip cared for John and his younger brother, Max, saw the occupation of Corfu during WWII, and lived through the bombings by Italians, Germans, British and Americans, only to be plunged immediately into the Greek Civil War of 1946 to 1949. At the end of the War having served in the Greek Navy, John studied economics and law at the University of Athens, earning a B.Sc. (Econ.) degree in 1948. He arrived in South Africa in September 1952 with his first wife, Helen, and started work as an insurance broker. In 1967 he studied for a B.Sc. in Natural Science through the University of South Africa, and the following year enrolled at the University of Witwatersrand for an M.Sc. degree in botany and geography. Over a period of more than 50 years John Lavranos undertook numerous visits to remote regions in southern Arabia, Somalia and Socotra, Kenya and Tanzania, Mozambique, Madagascar, Reunion Island, Mauritius, Canary Islands, Greece, and in his final years, the southwestern United States, Mexico, and Chile. His trips through South Africa included Namaqualand, Mpumalanga, and the Richtersveld. He discovered and described many new species of succulent plants, collaborating with organisations such as the National Museum of Natural History (France), the Institute of Tropical Botany of Florence, Kew Gardens, Jardin Exotique de Monaco, and the Missouri Botanical Garden. His contributions were published mainly in the 'Cactus & Succulent Journal', and he confined himself to Asclepiadaceae, Pelargoniums, Aloes and other succulents. His collection of pressed specimens numbered some 32 000, and he described or co-described approximately 180 taxa. He settled in Loul\u00e9, a small town near Faro in southern Portugal in 1995 and donated most of his plants to the Gibraltar Botanic Gardens. Maintaining his passion for plants, he continued an active correspondence with other botanists, often setting aside time for succulent enthusiasts. He is commemorated in the genus Lavrania in the family Apocynaceae, Aloe lavranosii Reynolds, Eriospermum lavranosii P.L.Perry, Caralluma lavranii Rauh & Wertel, Sarcocaulon lavranii Halda, Phagnalon lavranosii Qaiser & Lack Aloe lavranosii is from Yemen and is unusual in being hairy with yellow-green flowers. Crassula susannae was named for Suzanne Lavranos, the second wife of John Lavranos. Caralluma mireillae Lavranos, was named after John's third wife, Mireille, who died in 2014, and whom he had met in Djibouti. She was very supportive of his botanical explorations and often accompanied him. All three of John's marriages were childless. John was known to be pragmatic, forthright, precise, energetic, and with a lively sense of humour. His knowledge of botany and geology was formidable, and this extended to climatology, geography, astronomy, history and music - he was an accomplished pianist earlier in his life. Despite being an agnostic his biblical knowledge was extensive. He was a polyglot and comfortable in Ancient Greek and Latin, and fluent in Greek, English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Arabic and Afrikaans. He succumbed in Loul\u00e9 following a stroke.pers. comm. from Angelo Lavranos ==References== ==External links== *'The plant gatherings and other vouchers of John J Lavranos Part 1' - Roy Mottram *'The plant gatherings and other vouchers of John J Lavranos Part 2' - Roy Mottram *'John Lavranos, Pelargonium plantsman' - Matija Strlic *'Vegetation Ecology of Socotra' - Gary Brown, Bruno Mies Category:South African botanists Category:South African people of Greek descent Category:1926 births Category:2018 deaths Category:National and Kapodistrian University of Athens alumni Category:University of the Witwatersrand alumni Category:People from Corfu ",
