According to Statcast, he uses four-seam fastballs and sliders against left-handers, while using 2-seamers and changeups against right-handers, as strikeout pitches. ==References== ==External links== Category:1992 births Category:Living people Category:Augusta GreenJackets players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Dominican Summer League Giants players Category:Greensboro Grasshoppers players Category:Jacksonville Suns players Category:Jupiter Hammerheads players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:National League All-Stars Category:Pensacola Blue Wahoos players ",
