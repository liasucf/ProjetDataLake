    "text": "The 1982 Arizona Wildcats football team represented the University of Arizona in the Pacific-10 Conference (Pac-10) during the 1982 NCAA Division I-A football season. In their third season under head coach Larry Smith, the Wildcats compiled a 6\u20134\u20131 record (4\u20133\u20131 against Pac-10 opponents), finished in fifth place in the Pac-10, and outscored their opponents, 311 to 219. The team played its home games in Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. Despite a winning record, the Wildcats did not appear in a bowl game, perhaps due to very few bowl games available at the time and that the six wins were not good enough. Also, late-season losses to USC and Oregon may have been a factor in the Wildcats not earning a bowl berth. Memorable highlights of the season included a big road win at Notre Dame and a huge upset of rival Arizona State which prevented ASU from reaching the Rose Bowl. The team's statistical leaders included Tom Tunnicliffe with 2,520 passing yards, Vance Johnson with 443 rushing yards, and Brad Anderson with 870 receiving yards. Linebacker Ricky Hunley led the team with 173 total tackles.2016 Media Guide, p. 86. ==Personnel== ==Schedule== ==Season summaries== ===Iowa=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 5\u20132 | 1980 | W 5\u20133 |} ===at Notre Dame=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" | 0\u20132 | 1980 | L 3\u201320 |} Max Zendejas kicked the game-winning field goal as time expired. To date, this remains the last time that both Arizona and Notre Dame would meet on the football field. ===USC=== *USC Defense: 3 INTs for TD (NCAA record) ===Arizona State=== Arizona\u2019s defense recorded a pair of safeties and the offense connected on two long touchdown passes to help the Wildcats upset Arizona State and denied the Sun Devils a berth in the Rose Bowl. It was the Wildcats\u2019 first home win over ASU since 1974 and the victory also began a reign of dominance against the Devils under Smith and his successor. ==Season notes== *The Wildcats started a string of dominance over Arizona State this season, and went on to a 8\u20130\u20131 record against them, which was known as \u201cThe Streak\u201d to fans, which lasted until 1991. *After defeating Notre Dame, the Wildcats and Fighting Irish have not met on the football field since. Arizona claimed that scheduling non-conference games against tradition-rich powerhouse schools like Notre Dame would be too expensive for Arizona\u2019s small market. *Arizona wore white jerseys for home games against USC and ASU. Smith said that they wore white due to them winning big road games during the season. The NCAA forced a rule that home teams were required to wear colored jerseys beginning in 1983. *After the victory over ASU, many Wildcat players and fans claimed to have found roses that were either destroyed or tossed in trash cans around Arizona Stadium left behind by ASU fans. This was due to ASU needing a win over the Wildcats to clinch a Rose Bowl berth, and Arizona winning that prevented their rival from accomplishing that goal. *Days after Arizona\u2019s upset of ASU, the Arizona Daily Wildcat (the university\u2019s newspaper), published an article of the game and featured a fan-made picture of the Wildcats\u2019 mascot defeating its ASU counterpart with blood and pieces of roses scattered in the Arizona desert, referencing the Wildcat victory. ==References== Arizona Category:Arizona Wildcats football seasons Arizona Wildcats football team ",
