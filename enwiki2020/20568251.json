Sibley was born in Detroit in late October, 1883.Clarence Monroe Burton, William Stocking, and Gordon K. Miller, The City of Detroit, Michigan, 1701-1922, The S. J. Clarke publishing company, 1922, p.675 As an adult, he joined his father's lumber company and acted as treasurer until his father's death in 1912, after which he assumed the presidency of the firm. In 1922, the Sibley Lumber Company employed 400 people and was the second largest lumber firm in Detroit. Sibley married Mabel Bessenger in August 1910. They had five children: Josephine, Frederic Jr., Dorothy, Suzanne, and Joy. Sibley is also known for his cooperation with August Fruehauf in developing the first semi- trailers to haul lumber. Sibley, approached August Fruehauf, his blacksmith about modifying a wagon to transport an 18' boat. Sibley wanted to use his Model-T roadster rather than a slow moving horse and wagon. August Fruehauf and his partner, Otto Neumann took several days to devise a solution. They removed the back seat of the Model-T to support the front end of the wagon and fashioned a 5th wheel coupling to attach the wagon to the back of the automobile. August called it a semi-trailer. Sibley was impressed with the solution and ordered additional semi-trailers for his lumber company. Henry Ford canceled the warrantee on the modified Model T's. August Fruehauf turned this invention into a goldmine.http://www.singingwheels.com The Fruehauf Corporation manufactured these trailers for many years afterward.Frederick M.
