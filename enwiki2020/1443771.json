    "text": "Day of Silence is GLSEN's annual day of action to spread awareness about the effects of the bullying and harassment of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and questioning (LGBTQ) students. In the United States, students take a day-long vow of silence to symbolically represent the silencing of LGBTQ students. The Day of Silence has been held each year in April since 1996. Since 2011, the event was held on the second Friday in April, except in 2018, when it was observed on Friday, April 27, and 2020, when it was observed on Friday, April 24. ==Organization== The Day of Silence is organized by the GLSEN. Students are encouraged to obtain permission from their school before organizing the event. GLSEN states that hundreds of thousands of students at more than 8,000 schools participated in the 2008 Day of Silence. ==History== Created by then-student Maria Pulzetti, the first event was organized by students at University of Virginia in 1996. Pulzetti explained: \"I wanted to do something for BGLAD week that would impact many people at the school and that would be very visible...I knew that if we held panel discussions and events like that, the only people who would come would be the people who already were fairly aware.\" In 1997, Day of Silence went national, with almost 100 colleges and universities participating. In 2000, Pulzetti's classmates Jessie Gilliam and Chloe Palenchar, and GLSEN National Student Organizer Chris Tuttle, developed the proposal for the day to become an official project of GLSEN. GLSEN developed its first-ever \"student leadership team\" as part of the Day of Silence. In 2008, the Day of Silence was held in memory of Lawrence \"Larry\" King, an eighth grader from E.O. Green Middle School who was shot by classmate Brandon McInerney. In the last several years, over 10,000 participants have registered their participation with GLSEN each year. These participants attend middle schools, high schools, colleges, and universities. They include students from all 50 states in the U.S.A. as well as students from around the world, including New Zealand, Singapore, and Russia. ==Opposition== In 2005, the Alliance Defense Fund, which has been labelled as an anti-LGBT hate group, began sponsoring a yearly counter-protest called the Day of Truth. \"Events like these actually end up promoting homosexuality in public schools, and that actually creates a hostile climate for students of faith,\" said Candi Cushman, an education analyst for Focus on the Family. A card carried by participants in the Day of Truth reads: \"true tolerance means that people with differing--even opposing--viewpoints can freely exchange ideas and respectfully listen to each other. It's time for an honest conversation about homosexuality. There's freedom to change if you want to. Let's talk.\" Other socially conservative organizations, including the American Family Association, Concerned Women for America, Mission America, Traditional Values Coalition, Americans for Truth, and Liberty Counsel, opposed the Day of Silence in 2008 by forming a coalition urging parents to keep their kids home on the DOS if students at their school were observing it. The Rev. Ken Hutcherson, the principal supporter of those who skipped school, said, \"We want education, not indoctrination.\" In April 2010, in opposition to the Day of Silence, several students in Laingsburg High School in Laingsburg, Michigan wore T-shirts stating \"Straight Pride\" on the front side and bore a reference to on the back. That Bible verse refers to homosexual behaviour as an abomination and prescribes death as the penalty for it. The same protest, which was organized on a Facebook group, also took place in the St. Johns and Bath school districts. On October 6, 2010, CNN reported that Exodus International, which promotes \"freedom from homosexuality through Jesus Christ\", would not support the 2011 annual Day of Truth as the organization had done in 2010. President Alan Chambers stated, \"All the recent attention to bullying helped us realize that we need to equip kids to live out biblical tolerance and grace while treating their neighbors as they'd like to be treated, whether they agree with them or not.\" In 2011, Focus on the Family acquired the \u201cDay of Truth\u201d event and renamed it into the \u201cDay of Dialogue\u201d. As of 2012, the Day of Dialogue website stated: \"Now it boasts a new name, while maintaining the same goal it\u2019s always had since its founding \u2014 encouraging honest and respectful conversation among students about God\u2019s design for sexuality.\"Focus on the Family, \"Day of Dialogue History,\" (accessed April 2, 2012) ==See also== *Ally Week *Athlete Ally *National Coming Out Day *Student voice *Transgender Day of Remembrance *List of LGBT awareness days ==References== ==External links== * *Facebook page Category:Anti-homophobia Category:April observances Category:Civil awareness days Category:Education in the United States Category:LGBT and education Category:LGBT events in the United States Category:LGBT youth Category:Silence Category:Unofficial observances ",
