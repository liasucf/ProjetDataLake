During heavy snow and poor visibility, at 00:43 ADT (03:43 UTC) on March 29, 2015, the Airbus A320-211 landed short of the runway and was severely damaged. Twenty-six people were injured. In April 2015, Air Canada sent payments of CDN$5000 to all passengers involved.Air Canada Flight 624 passengers receiving $5K cheques from airline; Lawyer Ray Wagner calls it 'a gratuity' and says $5K payments don't change airline's liability, CBC News, April 2, 2015. A class action lawsuit has been filed in relation to this incident.AC 624 crash: MacGillivray Law to file class action lawsuit; A second lawyer, Ray Wagner, says his firm is considering a class action lawsuit as well, CBC News, March 30, 2015. ==Accident== Air Canada Flight 624 departed from Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) bound for Halifax Stanfield International Airport (YHZ). It was carrying 133 passengers and five crew. The Airbus A320 operating the flight, registration C-FTJP, impacted the ground short of the threshold of runway 05 (which is not equipped for precision landing), smashing through an ILS-LOC antenna array. This impact caused the landing gear to separate from the aircraft. The plane also impacted a power line, which cut power to the airport. The aircraft then climbed an embankment up to the runway level, skidded on its belly and stopped past the threshold. The Halifax airport was without electricity for about 90 minutes. The aircraft was extensively damaged, having lost all landing gear and its port engine. The wings and tailplane were also damaged. Both pilots, twenty- three passengers and a flight attendant were taken to hospital. None of the injuries were life-threatening,Final report, p.7 and all but one of those taken to hospital were released the same day. The weather at the time of the accident was described as \"stormy\" (winter conditions). The loss of power to the airport was due to the aircraft clipping transmission lines before hitting the ground. Electricity was restored to the airport by 02:12 ADT.Final report, p.7, section 1.4 While the aircraft collided with objects outside the airport perimeter and was damaged beyond repair, Air Canada initially described the accident as a \"hard landing\". ==Aircraft== The aircraft was an Airbus A320-211 equipped with two CFM56-5A1 engines. Its serial number was 233 with a fleet number of 214, and it first flew in 1991. It was owned by GECAS and leased to Air Canada. As a result of the accident, the aircraft was written off. ==Investigation== The accident was investigated by the Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Three Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile (BEA) investigators from France and two technical advisers from Airbus travelled to Canada to participate in the investigation.\"Flight AC 624, Airbus A320, registered C-FTJP \u2013 Halifax Stanfield International Airport (Canada), 29 March 2015\" (Archive). Bureau d'Enqu\u00eates et d'Analyses pour la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 de l'Aviation Civile. Retrieved on April 2, 2015. As a result of the accident, Air Canada revised its incorrect Airbus A320-200 Standard Operating Procedure. The final report was released in May 2017, and showed no mechanical faults contributing to the accident. Instead pilot error was mainly to blame, as the crew followed relevant Air Canada flying procedures that contradicted Airbus and pilot training guidelines. Investigators determined that the airline's standard operating procedure in regard to the selected landing mode (Flight Path Angle Guidance) was over-reliant on the Airbus' automation and lead to excessive loss of altitude. Per the SOP, the crew need not have monitored the aircraft's altitude or relation to the runway to make any subsequent adjustments to the flight path angle after the final approach fix. Subsequently, the captain and first officer failed to notice or respond to the fact that the aircraft autopilot selected a steep vertical angle flight path, causing a drop below the minimum safe altitude. Furthermore, limited visibility hampered the crew's ability to accurately perceive their surroundings. == Litigation == A class action lawsuit was introduced against Air Canada, the Halifax Airport, NAV Canada, Transport Canada, Airbus and the aircraft's pilots which alleges that negligence on the part of the defendants caused the crash, inflicting physical and psychological harm onto the passengers. Other separate lawsuits are being assessed by medical professionals, with settlements based on the relative severity of each client's injuries. On 30 March 2017, Air Canada filed a lawsuit against Airbus, alleging that the manufacturer \"failed to identify shortcomings of the Airbus A320\", which included uncommanded descent below the pre-programmed glide path. ==See also== * Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320 family ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== * Transportation Safety Board of Canada: \"Collision with terrain involving an Air Canada Airbus A320 at Stanfield International Airport, Halifax, Nova Scotia\" * Air Canada: \"Air Canada provides Update on AC624\" * Post-accident photos \u2013 TSBCanada on Flickr * Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 2015 Category:Airliner accidents and incidents in Canada Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Airbus A320 Category:Air Canada accidents and incidents Category:2015 disasters in Canada Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:March 2015 events in Canada Category:History of Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:Halifax Stanfield International Airport ",
