    "text": "KJCK (1420 AM) is a radio station broadcasting a News Talk Information format and is licensed to Junction City, Kansas, United States. KJCK signed on May 15, 1949, to serve the Salina-Manhattan area. The station is currently owned by Eagle Communications, and features programming from ABC Radio, Sporting News Radio and Westwood One. For many years, this station carried a country music format, and would later flip to a news/talk format. Prior to the mid-1970s, the station simulcasted with its Sister FM station. On October 6, 2011, Platinum Broadcasting announced it was ceasing operations, and that the station, along with its sister stations, would be sold to Hays-based Eagle Communications, pending FCC approval. The sale was approved on December 15, 2011. After stunting with Christmas music, on December 27, 2018, KJCK flipped to classic hits, and began emphasizing their translator K300DN (107.9 FM). ==References== ==External links== JCK Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States ",
