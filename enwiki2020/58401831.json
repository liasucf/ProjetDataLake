    "text": "Stanley Charles Hurst (21 June 1911 \u2013 28 May 1993) was an English professional footballer who played as an outside forward and centre forward in the Football League for Exeter City, Watford, and Brighton & Hove Albion. ==Life and career== Hurst was born in 1911 in Newton St Cyres, Devon, where his father was the stationmaster, and attended Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School in Crediton. He played works and village football and was working as a porter at Tipton St Johns railway station when he joined Exeter City in 1932, initially as an amateur. He made his Third Division South debut in October 1932 and turned professional later that season. He became a regular in the side, was their top scorer in 1933\u201334, and scored the winning goal as Exeter beat Torquay United 2\u20131 to win the inaugural edition of the Football League Third Division South Cup. He scored 25 goals from 107 league appearances before moving on to another Southern Section club, Watford, in 1936 for an undisclosed fee. Hurst spent only one season with Watford; he scored 14 goals from 32 appearances in all competitions and was sold for \u00a3125 to Brighton & Hove Albion, also of the Third Division South. He played little in his first season and appeared in more than half the matches in his second, scoring 11 goals from 34 appearances in all competitions. He joined Aldershot ahead of the 1939\u201340 Football League season but played only once, scoring a late equaliser away to Swindon Town, before competitive football was suspended for the duration of the Second World War. He appeared as a guest for Reading in the wartime competitions and played for Aldershot in the 1945\u201346 season before returning to Devon where he played for Crediton United. He became chairman of the club but took the blame when a cup match in the 1950s turned into a riot, and Crediton United was banned from football sine die. Hurst collapsed and died in 1993 while playing golf in Crediton; he was 81. ==References== Category:1911 births Category:1993 deaths Category:People from Crediton Category:Footballers from Devon Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Exeter City F.C. players Category:Watford F.C. players Category:Brighton & Hove Albion F.C. players Category:Crediton United A.F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Southern Football League players Category:People educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Crediton ",
