The kingdom\u2019s warriors are overpowered and the invaders take away the sacred emblem, thereby bringing a curse on the land. Decades later, the current Oba\u2019s only son is ill and at the point of death. As revealed by the witch doctor, the sickness is as a result of the missing antique. Therefore, to bring the circles of deaths and famine in the land to end, an innocent girl named Uki (Oge Indiana) is chosen to risk her life by journeying to the land where mortals are forbidden, on a quest to find and return the antique. Three special warriors, who will stop at nothing until they achieve their purpose, accompany Uki. The journey proves to be a mission almost impossible as they encounter sinister immortal forces, which try to stop them from reaching their goal.
