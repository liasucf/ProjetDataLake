He interviews celebrities including Bill O'Reilly, Donald Trump, Ruhollah Khomeini, and Oprah Winfrey, shown through archive footage of the show. == Cast == * Mike Wallace as himself (archived footage) Other appearances: == Production == Director Avi Belkin told From the Grapevine: \"I had this idea. I wanted to do a Mike Wallace interview with Mike Wallace. But Mike was obviously dead, so I had an idea of doing this through the archives\". He approached CBS News, producer of 60 Minutes, which provided Belkin with more than 1,400 hours of archival footage, including \"never-before-seen footage of Wallace prepping for interviews, chatting with colleagues and pontificating about his life's work\". This was the first time CBS News had allowed someone to use their 60 Minutes archival footage. Belkin spent several months watching Wallace's interviews, writing down the ideas he had, and then spent about a year editing the film alongside Billy McMillin and his team. Belkin said he did not plan to explore Wallace's personal life. He explained: The film title refers to the legendary fear that Wallace's name evoked in his interview subjects. According to Belkin, these were \"the four most-dreaded words in the English language back then\". The title also hints to the ongoing legacy that Wallace leaves with the viewing of this archival footage. == Release == Mike Wallace Is Here premiered at the 2019 Sundance Film Festival on 27 January 2019.

Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun-Times wrote: \"This is a time capsule\u2014an expertly crafted time capsule\u2014of an astonishing career\". Leah Pickett of Chicago Reader wrote: \"Director Avi Belkin employs many creative strategies to reveal the inner workings of Mike Wallace, the formidable reporter best known for grilling celebrities and political dignitaries on 60 Minutes\". Josh Modell of The A.V. Club wrote: 'To be blunt\u2014which Wallace, who died in 2012, always was\u2014Mike Wallace Is Here is fascinating but scattered, and never quite decides what its target should be\". Amy Nicholson of Variety wrote: \"As Belkin's brisk and compelling documentary fades to black, the director seems to hope that the Wallace quotation audiences cling to isn't one of his fanged questions, but his optimism for the profession to which he dedicated his life\". Lisa Jensen of Good Times criticised the film, writing that \"Belkin never really discovers the man behind the public persona. Nor does he find (in what must have been hundreds of hours of footage) any particular 'aha!' moment with an interview subject that would cap Wallace's legacy\". Norman Wilner of Now wrote: \"Maybe that's Belkin's point: that contemporary journalism has settled for easily digestible, context-light sound bites rather than discourse or dialogue that's intended to find the inarguable truth of a thing\". Nora Lee Mandel of Film- Forward wrote: \"Director Avi Belkin's debut English-language feature documentary opens with its most intriguing setup and then takes a while to reach that insight again\". == Accolades == In 2019, the film won Video Source Award awarded by International Documentary Association.
