    "text": "Gene 11 of Rotavirus encodes a nonstructural protein, NSP5 and also encodes NSP6, from an out of phase open reading frame. In contrast to the other rotavirus non-structural proteins, NSP6 was found to have a high rate of turnover, being completely degraded within 2h of synthesis. NSP6 was found to be a sequence independent nucleic acid binding protein, with similar affinities for ssRNA and dsRNA. ==References== Category:Rotaviruses Category:Viral nonstructural proteins ",
