    "text": "The Pee Pocket is a single-use urinary device that allows a person to stand while urinating, in situations where they could not normally do so. It was developed by a team of doctors and it is marketed primarily to women, athletes, travelers, the elderly, disabled, pregnancy, parents of young girls, and post-surgery patients. It can also be used to prevent the exchange of bodily fluids between people through contact with unsanitary surfaces. In 2014, when media reported an increase of Ebola cases around the world, the Pee Pocket was said to help prevent the disease. The Pee Pocket has also become very popular in the LGBTQ community and is used in bathrooms worldwide. ==References== *http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph- Parser?Sect1=PTO1&Sect2;=HITOFF&d;=PALL&p;=1&u;=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&r;=1&f;=G&l;=50&s1;=D760383.PN.&OS;=PN/D760383&RS;=PN/D760383 *https://www.thepeepocket.com/ *http://www.letsjusttalkradio.com/tag/jacob- delarosa/ Category:Personal hygiene products ",
