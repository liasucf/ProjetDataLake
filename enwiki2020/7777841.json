    "text": "The Shire of Westonia is a local government area in the eastern Wheatbelt region of Western Australia, about east of Perth, the state capital. Its seat of government is the small town of Westonia. Although the Shire of Westonia is located in the Wheatbelt region, it is at the eastern limit of land suitable for wheat growing. The most important industries of Westonia today are wheat and sheep, but historically it was a gold mining area. ==History== The Westonia Road District was established on 30 June 1916. On 1 July 1961, it became the Shire of Westonia under the Local Government Act 1960, which reformed all remaining road districts into shires. ==Wards== The Shire initially had a ward system with two elected members representing the north, south, west and town wards (for a total of eight members). However, following the 2009 local government elections the Shire of Westonia's ward system was abolished and the number of elected members was dropped to six. ==Towns== * Westonia * Boodarockin * Carrabin * Walgoolan * Warrachuppin * Warralakin ==Population== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
