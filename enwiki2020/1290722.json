    "text": "Molina is a Spanish occupational surname. Molina is latin for 'mill' and is derived from another latin word, mola ('millstone'). The surname originated from the early Middle Ages, referring to a person who operates a mill or a millstone.p. 164 in Gutierre Tib\u00f3n, Diccionario etimol\u00f3gico comparado de los apellidos espa\u00f1oles, hispanoamericanos y filipinos ('Comparative Etymological Dictionary of Spanish, Hispanic American and Filipino Surnames'), Fondo de Cultura Econ\u00f3mica, Mexico City, February 1995 as a reprint of 2nd Edition from 1992 (1st Edition: 1988, Editorial Diana); 434 pp., Other Spanish surnames, like Molinero (literally: 'miller'), have also been originated in the work and management of a mill. Spanish municipalities like Molina de Segura (Murcia) or Molina de Arag\u00f3n (Castilla-La Mancha) still nowadays include millstones or mill blades in their respective coats of arms (cf. coat of arms of Molina de Segura and Coats of arms of Molina de Arag\u00f3n).
