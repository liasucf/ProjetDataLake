This fjord is part of the Scoresby Sound system.Prostar Sailing Directions 2005 Greenland and Iceland Enroute, p. 115 Administratively it lies in the area of Sermersooq municipality. ==History== This long fjord was surveyed and named in 1891 by Carl Ryder during his 1891\u201392 East Greenland Expedition. It was named \"F\u00f8hnfjord\" owing to the powerful Foehn wind gusts blowing during the first exploration of the fjord in August 1891.Place names, NE Greenland Ryder wrote: Another name given by former surveyors was Blastfjord, by Hans Christian Gull\u00f8v. ==Geography== In the southern Scoresby Sound, between Cape Leslie in Milne Land to the north and Cape Stevenson to the south, there are the mouths of two fjords that go in a roughly southwestern direction. The northern branch is the Fonfjord and the southern is the much wider mouth of the Gaasefjord (G\u00e5sefjord). Gaaseland (G\u00e5seland) is the peninsula that lies between these two fjords. To the north the fjord is bound by Milne Land and to the south by Gaaseland. Danmark Island lies at the eastern end, by its mouth. Ten kilometers before the mouth, the fjord has a branch in the northeastern shore named Rensund that separates Danmark Island from Milne Land. Fonfjord makes a sharp bend to the north near the western end with the Rode Fjord (R\u00f8defjord) running in a NNE direction and the Vestfjord branching roughly to the southwest. The Rolige Br\u00e6 glacier flows into the Rode Fjord just north of the Vestfjord junction.. {| |- valign=\"top\" |Geological map of Scoresby Sound. |Map of NE Greenland and Iceland. |} ==See also== *List of fjords of Greenland ==References== ==External links== * *Holocene glacimarine sedimentation, inner Scoresby Sund Category:Fjords of Greenland Category:Scoresby Sound ",
