    "text": "The Tibet Medal was authorised in February 1905 for all members of the Tibet Mission and accompanying troops who served at or beyond Siliguri from 13 December 1903 to 23 September 1904. The obverse of the medal, designed by G. W. de Saulles, shows the left-facing bust of Edward VII in Field Marshal's uniform and the legend 'EDWARDVS VII KAISAR-I-HIND'. The reverse, designed by E. G. Gillick, depicts the Potala (winter palace of the Dalai Lamas) in Lhasa on top of the red hill with the words 'TIBET 1903-04' below. The suspender is of the swivelling ornate scroll type. The clasp 'GYANTSE' was given to those present in operations between 3 May and 6 July 1904 in or near Gyantse Fortress. Both silver and bronze medals were issued named to the recipient on the rim in a cursive script. The wide ribbon is maroon flanked by narrow white, and wider green, stripes. The medal was awarded in silver to combatant troops and in bronze to camp followers, with both eligible for the 'Gyantse' clasp. Approximately 3,350 silver medals were awarded, including about 600 to the first battalion the Royal Fusiliers, the only British Army unit present, and about 2,600 to members of the Indian Army, in addition to staff and support personnel. In excess of 2,500 bronze medals were awarded, mainly to those employed in transporting supplies over the difficult terrain, including to the Peshawar Camel Corps and locally recruited coolies.

Pages 235\u20137 confirm that in May 1904 2,000 coolies with 4,000 yaks and mules were collected in the Chumbi Valley near Sikkim to support the expedition. ==See also== *British expedition to Tibet ==References== ==External links== *Tibet Medal 1903-04 on medals.org.uk *Tibet Medal on the British Army Medals website *National Army Museum collections: Tibet Medal to Sepoy Iman Din, Queen's Own Corps of Guides Category:British campaign medals ",
