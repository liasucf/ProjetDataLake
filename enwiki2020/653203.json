Her father was a steelworker, and her mother was an active participant in the gospel music of the family's African Methodist Episcopal church. Battle attended Portsmouth High School where her music teacher and mentor was Charles P. (Phil) Varney. In a 1985 Time Magazine interview, Varney recalled the first time he heard the eight-year-old Battle sing, describing her as \"this tiny little thing singing so beautifully.\" \"I went to her later\", Varney recalled, \"and told her God had blessed her, and she must always sing.\"Michael Walsh, \"\"At the Head of the Class\", Time Magazine, November 11, 1985.

In 2004 he recalled: > We would meet monthly, listen to up-and-coming concert artists and give > money to deserving artists for further study. A very young Kathleen Battle > sang for us. The other judges thought her voice was too small, but I thought > she had an incredible ability to communicate through music.
