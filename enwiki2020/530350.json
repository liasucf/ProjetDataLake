    "text": "William Edward \"Bill\" Tidy, MBE (born 9 October 1933), is a British cartoonist, writer and television personality, known chiefly for his comic strips. Tidy was appointed MBE in 2000 for \"Services to Journalism\". He is noted for his charitable work, particularly for the Lord's Taverners, which he has supported for over 30 years. Deeply proud of his working-class roots in the North of England, his most abiding cartoon strips, such as the Cloggies and the Fosdyke Saga, have been set in an exaggerated version of that environment. He now lives in Boylestone, Derbyshire. ==Early life== He was born in Tranmere, a suburb of Birkenhead, Cheshire, on 9 October 1933 and brought up in Liverpool, where he was educated to the age of 15 at St Margaret's Church of England Academy (then St Margaret's Technical Commercial School), Anfield. His first published cartoon appeared in the school magazine.Bill Tidy - Britain's Best Cartoonist After working in a shipping office Tidy joined the Royal Engineers in 1952.http://www.ashbournenewstelegraph.co.uk/King-Tidy-big-archaeology-fan- far-fossil/story-21033596-detail/story.html He sold his first cartoon to a Japanese newspaper in 1955 and in the same year left the army. He found work in a Liverpool advertising agency the following year, where he drew illustrations for advertisements in magazines. Despite having no formal artistic training, he began to sell cartoons on a freelance basis and soon left the agency to work full-time as a professional cartoonist. ==Career== As his work became better known and began to be published in the Daily Sketch and Daily Mirror, he moved to London where, together with a number of his contemporaries in Fleet Street, he formed the British Cartoonists' Association. Tidy is known for his cartoon strips \u2014 The Cloggies ran from 1967 to 1981 in the fortnightly satirical magazine Private Eye, and The Fosdyke Saga was published daily in the Daily Mirror from 1971 to 1984; the latter was a parody of The Forsyte Saga, set in the industrial north instead of a genteel upper class environment. This was broadcast as a radio series in 42 parts by the BBC from 1983, with additional scripting by John Junkin. It also became a stage play with Tidy working in co-operation with playwright Alan Plater. Tidy recently restarted producing the Fosdyke Saga cartoon strip on his own website where he also offers a variety of his works for sale. Other cartoon strip series and individual cartoons have been published in many other newspapers and magazines, including New Scientist (Grimbledon Down for 24 years), What's Brewing (CAMRA's monthly magazine), and Punch. When Punch ceased publication, Tidy attempted to buy the title. He has also written 20 books and illustrated 70. Tidy's many TV appearances have included Countdown, Watercolour Challenge, Through the Keyhole, Blankety Blank and Countryfile. His radio appearances include an accomplished performance on a 1988 edition of I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, when he stood in for Barry Cryer. He wrote and presented Draw Me, a children's television series in 13 parts. He was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1975 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews. During the 1980's and early 1990's, Tidy was a frequent celebrity guest in 'Dictionary Corner' on the long running Channel 4 gameshow Countdown. The role of the celebrity on the show was twofold: Firstly to brazenly pretend each and every round that they had managed to find word with at least the same amount of letters as the contestants. This usually manifested itself with a dismissive statement along the lines of \"yes we got that\", followed by a rolling of the eyes and a smug facial expression. The second function of the guest was to amuse the audience by recounting a humourous story or anecdote prior to the commercial break. Tidy was more than competent when it came to the fist task, but his efforts to entertain the audience were less successful. Typically, when it came to this segment of the show, the usual format consisted of drawing a cartoon in black marker pen on white background, whilst telling what he clearly considered to be an hilarious tale, punctuated by the images he was creating with his sharpie. Sadly, audience reaction was rarely positive; and the denouement of his monologue was more often than not met by bewilderment rather than laughter, and an awkward silence only broken by host Richard Whiteley signalling that it was 'time for a short break'. On one occasion, Whiteley seemed to take pity in Tidy and said \"don't worry Bill, they're laughing at home\" in an attempt to comfort the incompetent cartoonist. as the camera panned back prior to the commercial break, Tidy was seen sobbing into a butterscotch handkerchief and wiping tears from his eyes. Tidy's artistic style is similar to that of his late friend and fellow cartoonist, Larry. However, where Larry's cartoons are usually the graphic equivalent of one- liner jokes, Tidy tends to work in longer forms with verbal as well as visual humour. ==References== ==Further reading== * Tidy, Bill (autobiography).
