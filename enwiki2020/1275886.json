NJDOT was established in 1966 as the first State transportation agency in the United States. The Transportation Act of 1966 (Chapter 301, Public Laws, 1966) established the NJDOT on December 12, 1966. NJDOT headquarters In 1979, with the establishment of New Jersey Transit, NJDOT's rail division (which funded and supported State-sponsored passenger rail service) was folded into the new agency. Until 2003, the NJDOT included the Division of Motor Vehicles (DMV), which was reorganized as the self-operating New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission (MVC). Since the late 1970s, NJDOT has been phasing out or modifying many traffic circles in New Jersey. ===NJDOT Commissioners=== *David J. Goldberg (1966\u20131970) *John C.
