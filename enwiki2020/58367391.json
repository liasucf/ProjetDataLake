    "text": "Elliott Himmelberg (born 4 June 1998) is a professional Australian rules footballer playing for in the Australian Football League (AFL). Himmelberg grew up in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales and played football for Redland. He moved to Queensland in 2016 and played for the state and the Allies in the 2016 AFL Under 18 Championships. Himmelberg broke his leg, which stopped him from attending the AFL Draft Combine, and missed the rest of the 2016 season. He was involved with the Lions Academy but was not eligible for exclusive selection in the 2016 AFL draft because he had not spent enough time in Queensland. Himmelberg was selected by Adelaide with pick 51 in the 2016 national draft, their third selection. In 2017, Himmelberg played 13 South Australian National Football League (SANFL) games, kicking 19 goals, including four in round 12 against the Port Adelaide Magpies. He suffered a foot injury in July which kept him out for the remainder of the season. In 2018, Himmelberg signed a two-year contract extension, tying him to Adelaide until 2020. He was named in the Adelaide squad for the inaugural AFLX tournament, and as an emergency for the JLT Community Series. He played more often as a ruckman in the SANFL, as fellow key-position players Paul Hunter and Reilly O'Brien suffered injuries. Himmelberg made his AFL debut in round 23 against Carlton at Docklands Stadium. He recorded 13 disposals and five marks, and kicked his first goal with a banana shot. Coach Don Pyke said, \"He's performed really well and didn't look out of place at all.\" Himmelberg is the brother of Harry Himmelberg, who plays football for the Greater Western Sydney Giants. == References == == External links == * * Category:Living people Category:1998 births Category:Sportspeople from Wagga Wagga Category:Redland Football Club players Category:Adelaide Football Club players Category:Australian rules footballers from New South Wales Category:Australian people of American descent ",
