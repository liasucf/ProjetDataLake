    "text": "\"Alcohaulin' Ass\" is the second single from the heavy metal band Hellyeah on the album of the same name. The name is a combination of the word alcohol and the phrase \"haulin' ass\". As the song opens, Gray sings in a country-type croon, and acoustic guitars are heard in the background with typical Western- sounding effects. The song picks up into a grooving hard rock format, where it continues for the rest of the track. The bonus edition of Hellyeah includes a solely acoustic version of \"Alcohaulin' Ass\". The song's title is sometimes misheard to be \"Alcohol and Ass.\" ==Chart performance== The song reached number 7 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. ==References== Category:2007 singles Category:Hellyeah songs Category:2007 songs Category:Epic Records singles Category:Songs written by Vinnie Paul Category:Songs written by Chad Gray Category:Songs written by Greg Tribbett Category:Songs written by Tom Maxwell ",
