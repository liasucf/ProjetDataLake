It is popular in Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. ==Preparation== Doogh is served chilled and often as an accompaniment to grilled meat or rice, especially during summer. It is made by mixing yogurt with chilled or iced water and is sometimes carbonated and seasoned with mint. Doogh has been variously described as \"diluted yogurt\" and \"a most refreshing drink made by mixing yogurt with iced water\".Lake Van and Turkish Kurdistan: A Botanical Journey P. H. Davis The Geographical Journal, Vol. 122, No. 2 (Jun., 1956), pp. 156\u2013165 Published by: The Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers) Article The traditional way of preparing the drink among various Iranic peoples is straight from milk, without yogurt, using a waterskin, known as Mashk (\u0645\u0634\u06a9) in Luri and Persian in Iran, and Maskah (\u0645\u0633\u06a9\u0647) in Afghanistan. This is done by pouring the milk in the waterskin, usually made of deer or sheep skin, and shaking it for hours, sometimes using a wooden structure to keep the waterskin above the ground with woolen strings to make the task easier. https://www.aparat.com/v/PbT8Q/%D8%A2%DB%8C%DB%8C%D9%86_%D9%85%D8%B4%DA%A9_%D8%B2%D8%AF%D9%86_%28_%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86_%DA%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%B1_%D9%85%D8%AD%D8%A7%D9%84_%D8%A8%D8%AE%D8%AA%DB%8C%D8%A7%D8%B1%DB%8C_%29https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzhUXJF_5OU ==History== Doogh is an Iranian fermented drink that has long been a popular drink and was consumed in ancient Persia (modern-day Iran). Described by an 1886 source as a cold drink of curdled milk and water seasoned with mint, its name derives from the Persian word for milking, dooshidan. Other similar drinks include ayran in Turkey, t\u2019an in Armenia and lassi in Southern Asia and are popular in Asian countries; however, they can differ from doogh. According to Nevin Hal\u0131c\u0131, ayran was consumed by Turkic people of Central Asia. A c. 1000 CE Turkish dictionary, D\u012bw\u0101n ul-Lughat al-Turk, defines ayran as a \"drink made out of milk. The Turkish word ayran comes from the Proto-Turkic *ajran or *ayran. \"[...] the Proto-Turkic language has developed extensive nomadic pastoralist vocabulary, including terms for [...] dairy products (*ajran \u2018a kind of salty yoghurt\u2019 and *torak \u2018a kind of cheese or quark\u2019).\" ==Turkish national drink status== Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, a Turkish politician who has held the posts of President and Prime Minister, has promoted ayran as a national drink. Speaking at a 2013 WHO Global Alcohol Policy Conference held in Istanbul, Erdo\u011fan contrasted ayran with alcohol, which he claimed was a recent introduction to Turkey. Nevertheless, sales of ayran in Turkey may lag behind other non-alcoholic beverages. According to a 2015 joint statement from the Soft Drink Producers Association, the Sparkling Water Producers Association, and the Milk Producers and Exporters Union of Turkey, ayran consumption during Ramadan had declined every year for the years 2010 to 2015. In 2015, Turkey's Customs and Trade Ministry, controlled by Erdo\u011fan's party, imposed a 220,000 TL fine (approximately $70,000) on state-owned \u00c7aykur manufacturers, stating that ayran had been \"insulted without reason\" in one of their advertisements for iced tea, in which the rapper Ceza rapped that ayran makes him sleepy; the ministry halted advertisements of \u00c7aykur's competing ice-tea product. ==Variations== Salt can be added, as can black pepper. Dried mint or pennyroyal can also be mixed in, as well as lime juice. One variation includes diced cucumbers to provide a crunchy texture to the beverage. Some varieties of doogh are carbonated. ==See also== *Borhani, yogurt-based drink from Bangladesh *Calpis, Japanese yogurt-based soft drink *Chal, fermented camel's-milk *Chaas, yogurt-based drink made with yogurt, salt and water, and occasional mint and coriander leaves *Chalap, beverage consisting of fermented milk, salt, and carbonated water *Filmj\u00f6lk, a yogurt drink from Sweden *Kefir, fermented milk drink made with yeast grains *Kumis, fermented mare's milk drink *Lassi, yogurt-based drink from the Indian Subcontinent *Qatiq, fermented-milk beverage *Yay\u0131k ayran\u0131, Turkish soured and churned yogurt-based drink ==References== Category:Afghan cuisine Category:Armenian drinks Category:Azerbaijani drinks Category:Iranian drinks Category:Iraqi cuisine Category:Israeli cuisine Category:Palestinian cuisine Category:Lebanese cuisine Category:Assyrian cuisine Category:Jordanian cuisine Category:Kurdish cuisine Category:Pashtun cuisine Category:Syrian cuisine Category:Turkish drinks Category:Cypriot cuisine Category:Yogurt-based drinks Category:Fermented dairy products Category:Fermented drinks Category:Sour foods ",
