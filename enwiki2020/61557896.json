The Jose Dolores Sepulveda Adobe was built by Jos\u00e9 Dolores Sep\u00falveda, his son was Mayor of Los Angeles from 1837 to 1848. Jos\u00e9 Dolores Sep\u00falveda\u2019s father was Jos\u00e9 Loreto Sep\u00falveda (1764\u20131808). The location is now a private residence in Torrance. The original Adobe is gone, but current homeowner renovated the house to reflect the Rancho history. Rancho de los Palos Verdes means \"range of green trees\". The Rancho is now the present-day cities of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, as well as portions of San Pedro and Torrance.No. 383 Home of Jos\u00e9 Dolores Sep\u00falveda Jos\u00e9 Dolores Sep\u00falveda (March 23, 1793\u20131824) was one of the sons of Juan Jos\u00e9 Sep\u00falveda (1764\u20131808). In 1784, the Spanish Crown deeded Rancho San Pedro, a tract of over , to soldier Juan Jos\u00e9 Dom\u00ednguez. Dom\u00ednguez died in 1809, and in 1810 the executor of his will, Manuel Guti\u00e9rrez, granted permission to then 17-year-old Sep\u00falveda to herd livestock in the southwestern reaches of Rancho San Pedro. This eventually became the basis for the Sep\u00falveda family's contested claim to the Rancho de los Palos Verdes, carved out of Rancho San Pedro lands. Dolores went to Monterey to settle his land title, but on his return trip in 1824 he was killed in the Chumash revolt at Mission La Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n. In 1834,Governor Jos\u00e9 Figueroa made a judicial decree intended to settle the dispute between the Dom\u00ednguez and Sep\u00falveda families, awarding the Rancho de los Palos Verdes to Juan Capistrano Sep\u00falveda and Jos\u00e9 Loreto Sep\u00falveda. Jos\u00e9 Dolores Sep\u00falveda married Mar\u00eda Ignacia Marcia \u00c1vila (1793 - ?) in November 8, 1813 at Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel. ==Marker== State maker reads: *NO. 383 SITE OF ADOBE HOME OF JOS\u00c9 DOLORES SEPULVEDA - This adobe was built in 1818.
