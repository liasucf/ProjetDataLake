    "text": "Coracae or Korakai () was a town and polis (city-state) on the Pagasetic Gulf in Magnesia in ancient Thessaly. It is mentioned in the Periplus of Pseudo- Scylax as between Methone and Spalauthra.Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, 65. Earlier writers tried equate the town with Korope, but that has not been generally accepted. Coracae is noted in two inscriptions from Delphi of the fourth century BCE. It has been suggested that the town's location could have been on a hill called Nevestiki, near the current village of Lekonas, where remains of a fortification have been found, but that location has been suggested by others as the site of Methone. ==References== Category:Populated places in ancient Thessaly Category:Lost ancient cities and towns Category:Ancient Magnesia Category:Cities in ancient Greece Category:Thessalian city-states ",
