    "text": "Mirchi and Mime is a local restaurant located in Powai, Mumbai, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. Its staff chiefly consists of people with hearing and speech disability. Most of the activities are undertaken by the staff who communicate with the patrons through sign language, images of whose variations accompany every item in the food menu. ==History== Mirchi and Mime was setup in March 2015, and the idea conceived by two serial entrepreneur-investors. ==Functioning== Mirchi and Mime only employs people who are hearing- and speech-impaired. Diners are requested to place their orders by mimicking hand- gestures associated with a particular food item. Items in the food menu are accompanied with photos of these hand gestures. The food menu matrix, which lists all food items in a single page along with the images, was designed by Chaitanya Modak from Inhouse Design, who is an alumnus of India's National Institute of Design. The staff were trained by Dr. Reddy's Foundation. ==See also== * Dark dining ==References== ==External links== Category:Restaurants in Mumbai ",
