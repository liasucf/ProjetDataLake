In 1990, the City of Baltimore enlisted Future Tents Limited (now known as FTL Associates) to create a permanent structure. The $4.9 million renovation was completed in July 1991, now known as the \"Pier Six Concert Pavilion\", with an increased capacity of 4,341. In 2004, the venue was briefly known as the \"Cavalier Telephone Pavilion\", until the City restored its original name in 2006. On November 30, 2016, a contract was approved to allow Live Nation and SMG co-operate Pier Six for up to 10 years. As part of the agreement, the pavilion underwent a $4 million renovation that includes the installation of a new tent and seats. Following renovations, the venue capacity was increased to 4,600.
