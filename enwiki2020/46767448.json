    "text": "Tabernacle Chapel in 2015 Tabernacle, Ynysybwl is an Independent chapel in Other Street, Ynysybwl, Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales. ==Early history== Like several other chapels in the village, Tabernacle dates from 1885, when a group of young local people were asked why they did nor attend Bethel Chapel. They responded by saying that they were not Methodists but Welsh Independents and would attend an Independent chapel if one was established. Consequently, services began to be held in the upper room of the Windsor Hotel. The opening services were held on 11 and 12 September 1887. ==Twentieth century== By the early 21st century membership stood at around 20. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Chapels in Rhondda Cynon Taf ",
