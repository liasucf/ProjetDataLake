By 2004 all 50 states had passed 0.08 percent laws for drivers, making it the new national standard. ==Awards== Dr. Sleet has received numerous public health awards including the following: * 2015 Elizabeth Fries Health Education Award * American Public Health Association (APHA) Derryberry Award for contributions to theory * United States Department of Health and Human Services Secretary\u2019s Award for Distinguished Service * Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) President\u2019s Award * APHA Distinguished Career in Injury Prevention * Society for Public Health Education (SOPHE) Distinguished Fellow Award * Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outstanding career award in behavioral science * The Royal Order of Sahametrei Medal for service to the King and people of Cambodia * Fellow of the American Academy of Health Behavior (inducted 1999). ==Public service== He has served on the following editorial boards: * American Journal of Lifestyle Medicine * Family and Community Health * Health Behavior & Policy Review * Health Promotion Journal of Australia * Health Promotion Practice * Injury Prevention * International Journal of Education Research * International Journal of Injury Control and Safety Promotion * Journal of Comparative Effectiveness Research * Journal of Pediatric Psychology * Journal of Safety Research * Journal of Social Behavior and Personality * Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness * Transportation Research Foundation: Traffic Psychology & Behavior ==References== Category:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention people Category:Emory University faculty Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:San Diego State University faculty Category:University of Toledo alumni ",
