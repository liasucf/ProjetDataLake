    "text": "In the social sciences, triangulation refers to the application and combination of several research methods in the study of the same phenomenon.Bogdan, R. C. & Biklen, S. K. (2006). Qualitative research in education: An introduction to theory and methods. Allyn & Bacon. . By combining multiple observers, theories, methods, and empirical materials, researchers hope to overcome the weakness or intrinsic biases and the problems that come from single method, single-observer, and single-theory studies. It is popularly used in sociology. \"The concept of triangulation is borrowed from navigational and land surveying techniques that determine a single point in space with the convergence of measurements taken from two other distinct points.\"Rothbauer, Paulette (2008) \"Triangulation.\" In Given, Lisa (Ed.), \"The SAGE Encyclopedia of Qualitative Research Methods.\" Sage Publications. pp. 892-894. In particular: *It can be used in both quantitative and qualitative studies. *It is a method-appropriate strategy of founding the credibility of qualitative analyses. *It becomes an alternative to traditional criteria like reliability and validity. *It is the preferred line in the social sciences. ==Purpose== The purpose of triangulation in qualitative research is to increase the credibility and validity of the results. Several scholars have aimed to define triangulation throughout the years. *Cohen and Manion (2000) define triangulation as an \"attempt to map out, or explain more fully, the richness and complexity of human behavior by studying it from more than one standpoint.\"Cohen, L., & Manion, L. (2000). Research methods in education. Routledge. p. 254. (5th edition). *Altrichter et al. (2008) contend that triangulation \"gives a more detailed and balanced picture of the situation.\"Altrichter, H., Feldman, A., Posch, P. & Somekh, B. (2008). Teachers investigate their work; An introduction to action research across the professions. Routledge. p. 147. (2nd edition). *According to O'Donoghue and Punch (2003), triangulation is a \"method of cross-checking data from multiple sources to search for regularities in the research data.\"O'Donoghue, T., Punch K. (2003). Qualitative Educational Research in Action: Doing and Reflecting. Routledge. p.78. ==Types== Denzin (2006) identified four basic types of triangulation:Denzin, N. (2006). Sociological Methods: A Sourcebook. Aldine Transaction. . (5th edition). *Data triangulation: involves time, space, and persons. *Investigator triangulation: involves multiple researchers in an investigation. *Theory triangulation: involves using more than one theoretical scheme in the interpretation of the phenomenon. *Methodological triangulation: involves using more than one method to gather data, such as interviews, observations, questionnaires, and documents. ==References== Category:Social science methodology Cohen, L., Mansion, L. and Morrison, K.
