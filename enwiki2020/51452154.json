    "text": "Roger as John of Leiden in the original production of Le proph\u00e8te Gustave- Hippolyte Roger (17 December 1815 \u2013 12 September 1879) was a French tenor. He is best known for creating the leading tenor roles in La damnation de Faust by Berlioz in 1846 and Meyerbeer's Le proph\u00e8te in 1849. ==Early years and education== Born in Paris and orphaned at an early age, Roger was brought up in Paris by his uncle. He entered the Paris Conservatoire and studied with Bl\u00e8s Martin. At the completion of his training, he won first prize in singing and declamation. ==Career== In 1838, Roger made his professional debut at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique, Paris, in L\u2019\u00e9clair by Fromental Hal\u00e9vy. He went on to create numerous leading roles in new operas with that company, including works by Daniel Auber (Rapha\u00ebl in La Part du Diable, 1843 and Lor\u00e9dan in Hayd\u00e9e, 1847, and others), Hal\u00e9vy (Edgard in Le sh\u00e9rif, 1839, Olivier in Les Mousquetaires de la Reine, 1846, and others). Roger was the first Marquis in Perruquier de la R\u00e9gence by Ambroise Thomas in 1838 and at the same theatre in 1846, the first Faust in La damnation de Faust by Hector Berlioz. He won praise for his clear, pure tone, his skill as a stage performer, and his musical intelligence. In 1848, after a tour of England with soprano Jenny Lind he moved from the Op\u00e9ra-Comique to the Op\u00e9ra where he created the title role in Meyerbeer's extremely successful opera Le proph\u00e8te in 1849. He also created roles there in L\u2019Enfant prodigue by Auber, 1850, in Le Juif errant of Hal\u00e9vy, 1852, and in Herculanum by F\u00e9licien David, 1859, as well as singing in revivals of popular works such as La favorite and Lucia di Lammermoor of Donizetti and Les Huguenots of Meyerbeer. Between 1850 and 1860, Roger made seven highly successful concert tours of Germany. ==Later years== In 1859, Roger had to have an arm amputated after a hunting accident. Nevertheless, with an artificial arm, he continued to sing in concerts and in opera productions. From 1868 until his death, Roger taught singing at the Paris Conservatoire. ==Critical assessment== In the opinion of some contemporary critics, Gustave-Hippolyte Roger was perfectly suited, both as singer and actor, for the kind of roles with which he began his career at the Op\u00e9ra- Comique, but some of the music he had to sing in roles at the larger Paris Opera,such as his most famous part, Jean in Le proph\u00e8te, was too heavy for his voice and caused vocal decline. == References == Category:1815 births Category:1879 deaths Category:Singers from Paris Category:French operatic tenors Category:19th-century French opera singers Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:Academics of the Conservatoire de Paris Category:19th- century male singers ",
