    "text": "Jean-Pierre Petit (born 5 April 1937, Choisy-le-Roi) is a French engineer retired from the National Center for Scientific Research (CNRS). In the early 1980s, Petit authored the science comic book series The Adventures of Archibald Higgins. He explored ufology, 9/11 conspiracy theories, and hypersonic military weapons like Aurora, Ayaks, Avangard. ==Early life== Jean- Pierre Petit obtained his Engineer's degree in 1961 at French aeronautical engineering school Institut sup%C3%A9rieur de l%27a%C3%A9ronautique et de l%27espace (Supa\u00e9ro). In the 1960s, he worked in a French rocket engine test facility as a test engineer in the development of the first Submarine-launched Ballistic Missiles. In 1965 he was hired by the Marseille Institute of Fluid Mechanics (IMFM). He worked as a research engineer conducting research in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). Petit defended his doctoral thesis University of Provence in 1972. == Career == === Research === He studied electromagnetic plasma propulsion and supersonic flight without shock wave through flow control by MHD force field in a new laboratory running with private funds, called LAMBDA \u03bb (Laboratory for Applications of MHD in Bitemperature Discharges to Aerodynamics). In 1974, he officially stopped experimental research in MHD and started working at the Marseille Observatory. He was co- director of the Calculation Center at the University of Provence from 1977 to 1983, where he developed CAD software in 1978. === Art === In topology, Petit worked with Bernard Morin on the torus and sphere eversion. In the 1980s, he taught sculpture at the art school of Aix-en-Provence, where he designed a 5-foot diameter model of Boy's surface that was exhibited in the \u03c0 room of the Palais de la D\u00e9couverte for 25 years. He published its first parametric representation, where meridians are described with ellipses. Fran\u00e7ois Ap\u00e9ry used this representation to build the implicit equation of Boy's surface. === Popular science === In 1979 Petit began writing \"science comic books\" published in French as Les Aventures d'Anselme Lanturlu and in English as The Adventures of Archibald Higgins, depicting a young character who explains hard scientific concepts with easy popular meaning and simple analogies. In 2005, Petit created a non-profit organization named Savoir Sans Fronti\u00e8res (tr. Knowledge Without Borders) that pays for their translation. The translated books are free to download from the organization's website and from the Universit\u00e9 de Lyon website. === Retirement === He retired from CNRS in April 2003. In 2007, he founded a non-profit organization called UFO-Science. == Claims and public matter of controversies == === Ummo case and ufology === In the 1990s, he published several books about ufology and the Ummo case. He stated on various French TV shows that some of his main scientific ideas were directly inspired based upon his analysis of the Ummo documents, questioning their terrestrial origin. He testified in 2018 that he experienced personal contacts with unidentified entities that may or not be related to the Ummo case but that he believes are aliens. The Ummo affair is generally believed to have been an elaborate hoax.PARANOIA - People Are Strange: Unusual UFO Cults == External links == * Official website short autobiography in English, long autobiography in French. * (en) UFO-Science * (en) Savoir-sans-Fronti\u00e8res * (fr) Science et Culture pour Tous * (en) Janus cosmological model == References == Category:French aerospace engineers Category:Space program of France Category:Supa\u00e9ro alumni Category:20th-century French scientists Category:20th-century French engineers Category:20th-century physicists Category:Ufologists Category:University of Provence faculty Category:1937 births Category:Living people Category:French astronomers Category:French astrophysicists Category:CNRS scientists Category:French anti\u2013nuclear power activists Category:French conspiracy theorists ",
