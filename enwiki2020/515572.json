The mountain range is a branch of the Albertine Rift Mountains, which border the western branch of the East African Rift. They are located between Lake Edward and Lake Kivu. The name \"Virunga\" is an English version of the Kinyarwanda word ibirunga, which means \"volcanoes\". The mountain range consists of eight major volcanoes. Most of them are dormant, except Mount Nyiragongo and Mount Nyamuragira , both in the DRC. Recent eruptions occurred in 2006 and in January 2010. Mount Karisimbi is the highest volcano at . The oldest mountain is Mount Sabyinyo, which rises above sea level. The Virunga Mountains are home of the critically endangered mountain gorilla, listed on the IUCN Red List of Endangered Species due to habitat loss, poaching, disease, and war (Butynski et al. 2003). The Karisoke Research Center, founded by Dian Fossey to observe gorillas in their native habitat, is located between Mount Karisimbi and Mount Bisoke. ==List of mountains in the Virunga Mountain Range== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background-color:#ABCDEF;\"| Name of mountain ! style=\"background- color:#ABCDEF;\"| Location ! style=\"background-color:#ABCDEF;\"| Elevation in Metres ! style=\"background-color:#ABCDEF;\"| Elevation in Feet |- !
