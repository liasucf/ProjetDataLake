    "text": "Ridiculous is an album by the British new wave group Squeeze. It was the band's eleventh studio album, and it introduced their latest drummer Kevin Wilkinson (no relation to bassist Keith Wilkinson). As on the previous album, Some Fantastic Place, the band recorded one song penned by Keith Wilkinson. This time, however, Wilkinson did not perform the lead vocals. That song, \"Got to Me\", is the last Wilkinson would write with Squeeze. Chris Difford sang lead on two songs, \"Long Face\" and \"Fingertips\". He had not performed lead on an album cut since \"Slaughtered, Gutted and Heartbroken\" and \"Love Circles\" on the 1989 album Frank. This record was produced by Glenn Tilbrook and Peter Smith. The album spent one week at number 50 in the UK Albums Chart. ==Track listing== All songs written by Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook except as indicated. # \"Electric Trains\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Heaven Knows\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Grouch of the Day\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Walk Away\" \u2013 4:43 # \"This Summer\" \u2013 3:39 # \"Got to Me\" (Keith Wilkinson) \u2013 3:45 # \"Long Face\" \u2013 4:31 # \"I Want You\" \u2013 4:03 # \"Daphne\" \u2013 3:44 # \"Lost for Words\" \u2013 1:59 # \"Great Escape\" \u2013 3:27 # \"Temptation for Love\" \u2013 3:37 # \"Sound Asleep\" \u2013 4:38 # \"Fingertips\" \u2013 5:40 ==Personnel== ;Squeeze *Chris Difford \u2013 guitar, backing vocals *Glenn Tilbrook \u2013 guitars, keyboards, lead & backing vocals *Keith Wilkinson \u2013 bass, backing vocals *Kevin Wilkinson \u2013 drums with: *Chris Braide \u2013 background vocals *Cathy Dennis \u2013 co-lead vocals on \"Temptation for Love\" ==References== ==External links== * Album summary Category:Squeeze (band) albums Category:1995 albums Category:Albums produced by Glenn Tilbrook ",
