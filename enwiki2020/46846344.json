This zoanthid exhibits bioluminescence. == Distribution == Savalia lucifica was first described by Cutress & Pequegnat in 1960. The type specimen was recovered from the seabed at a depth of in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. In 2011 the same species was recovered from a depth of in the Mediterranean Sea by a robot submersible operated from the Italian oceanographic ship \"Astrea\". This vessel was undertaking exploration and research into the deepwater red coral populations of the Aegean Sea at the time. == Ecology == Savalia lucifica emits light when stimulated, for example when stroked gently by a finger. In the Mediterranean Sea,this zoanthid uses the deepwater gorgonian Callogorgia verticillata as a substrate. == References == Category:Invertebrates of Europe Category:Animals described in 1960 Category:Parazoanthidae Category:Bioluminescent cnidarians ",
