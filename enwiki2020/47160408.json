    "text": "The Delta Kappa Epsilon Fraternity House is a historic fraternity house located at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in Champaign, Illinois. The house was built in 1906 for the university's Delta Pi chapter of the Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity. Architect E. G. Oldefest, a member of the chapter, designed the Tudor Revival building. The fraternity occupied the house until 1921, when the Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity purchased the building. Tau Delta Phi purchased the building from Alpha Sigma Phi in 1929; they occupied the house until 1940, when it became a private dormitory unaffiliated with Greek life. The building became a fraternity house again in the 1980s when it was purchased by Chi Phi. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 22, 1990. ==References== Category:Residential buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Tudor Revival architecture in the United States Category:Houses completed in 1906 Category:National Register of Historic Places in Champaign County, Illinois Category:Buildings and structures of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Category:Fraternity and sorority houses Category:Buildings and structures in Champaign, Illinois Category:Delta Kappa Epsilon Category:1906 establishments in Illinois ",
