    "text": "Vance Winkworth Amory (born 22 May 1949) is the former Premier of Nevis. He had previously held the position from 2 June 1992 to 11 July 2006. He founded and led the Concerned Citizens' Movement (CCM), now chaired by Stedmond Tross. He was a West Indies cricketer who played for the Combined Islands and the Leeward Islands. Prime Minister Amory also served as the Minister of Sports in the Nevis Island Administration. The main airport in Nevis, The Vance W. Amory International Airport, bears his name. Prime Minister Amory was born in Rawlins Village. He received his elementary, primary and secondary school education in Nevis. He has been an active member of a local church in Nevis since childhood. Amory was known for his fondness for the game of cricket. He suffered injuries, including a broken nose; that caused him to be lifted off the cricket field. Amory was known to excel academically, obtaining passes in 5 out of available 7 GCE 'O' level subjects at Charlestown Secondary School. He subsequently achieved his \u2018A' grade levels in St. Kitts, went on to University of the West Indies at Cave Hill Campus, Barbados, where he obtained his Bachelor of Arts degree. Then he returned home to continue teaching students at Charlestown Secondary School in 1973. Transferred to Gingerland Secondary School, Vance Amory, 1974\u20131977 and for 6 months during that period, took on the additional responsibility as acting headmaster while fulfilling his role as teacher, without additional compensation. At age 28 he became the youngest headmaster of Charlestown Secondary School. He took an institution that was lagging seriously behind and almost single-handedly restored acceptable grades and credibility. The transition from GCE \u2018O' levels to CXC and the newly introduced sports programs were among some of the challenges that he overcame, despite serious opposition from others. He assisted greatly with the education improvement of thousands during his days as teacher and principal. Mr. Amory then, between 1981 and 1983, had a short stint in banking as manager of the St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla National Bank, during which time he aided many individuals in obtaining well needed financing. That Bank was relatively new on Nevis and had its early difficulties. Nevis residents were very cautious in doing business with the institution and Amory set his mind to change this. The bank thereafter experienced healthy financial growth. He was also instrumental in overseeing the purchase of the land on which National Bank sits today. Deciding to move forward in 1983, Amory applied for and successfully received a position in the finance department of the Nevis Island Government. He was then promoted to Permanent Secretary in Finance, under the premiership of Dr. Simeon Daniel. It was from that position that Mr. Amory learned the ins and outs of governance. He decided to sacrifice himself for the betterment of Nevis and took study leave in September 1986 to further his education at University of the Virgin Islands, St. Croix campus. He resigned his position in December of that year and reported that he wanted to dedicate himself for the betterment of Nevis. During this time he organised a political party, the Concerned Citizens Movement. Within 5 years, Nevis in 1992 he took off for new destinations and altitudes with determination to serve as Premier. His transformation of the face of Nevis can be seen in many facets. He played a substantial role in securing the funding for the construction of the airport. There were numerous regulatory obstacles strewn in path of the airport development and numerous delays by the Basseterre Government (in Saint Kitts) in extending a loan guarantee. His commitment to the successful completion of the project is one reason that the airport bears his name. ==References== |- https://www.nevispages.com/premier-brantley- thanks-republic-of-china-taiwan-for-generous-support Category:1949 births Category:Living people Category:Premiers of Nevis Category:Saint Kitts and Nevis sportsperson-politicians Category:University of the West Indies alumni Category:Nevisian cricketers Category:Combined Islands cricketers Category:Leeward Islands cricketers Category:People from Saint George Gingerland Parish Category:Concerned Citizens' Movement politicians ",
