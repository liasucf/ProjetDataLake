By 1830 he had purchased much of the eastern end of the estate, at Highcliffe, Dorset. Previously had been owned by his forebears, the estate had been sold by his father. He engaged William Donthorne, a founder member of the Royal Institute of British Architects, to design a new Highcliffe Castle. The castle is built on an L shaped plan, oriented on a south-east axis, so the oriel window is central on the south east elevation, providing a vista across the landscaped gardens to a panorama of the needles and Isle of Wight. Used in the building of the house was carved medieval stonework from the Norman Benedictine Abbey of St Peter at Jumieges and from the Grande Maison des Les Andelys. Both of these buildings had fallen into disrepair after the French Revolution. Also included in the castle, were a 16th-century oriel window and a stained glass window.

However ill-health caused his return to England and he died at Highcliffe in November 1845, aged 66, when the barony became extinct. He was buried at St Mark's Church, Highcliffe and his memorial can still be seen there. Lady Stuart de Rothesay remained a widow until her death in June 1867. ==References== ==References== * (Originally published in * * Category:1779 births Category:1845 deaths Category:People educated at Eton College Category:Alumni of Christ Church, Oxford Category:Barons in the Peerage of the United Kingdom Category:Knights Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Tower and Sword Category:Diplomatic peers Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France Charles Category:Members of the Privy Council of the United Kingdom Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Portugal Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Russia Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Brazil Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to the Netherlands Category:Ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Spain ",
