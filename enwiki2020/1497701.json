    "text": "Laura Esquivel (born September 30, 1950) is a Mexican novelist, screenwriter and a politician who serves in the Chamber of Deputies (2012-2018) for the Morena Party. Her first novel Como agua para chocolate (Like Water for Chocolate) became a bestseller in Mexico and the United States, and was later developed into an award-winning film. ==Literary career== In her novel Like Water for Chocolate released in 1989, Esquivel uses magical realism to combine the ordinary and the supernatural, with narrative devices similar to those used by Cuban author Alejo Carpentier as \"el real maravilloso\" and by Colombian author Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez and Chilean author Isabel Allende. Como agua para chocolate is set during the Mexican Revolution of the early twentieth Century and features the importance of the kitchen and food in the life of its female protagonist, Tita. The novel is structured as a year of monthly issues of an old-style women's magazine containing recipes, home remedies, and love stories, and each chapter (\"January,\" \"February,\" \"March,\" etc.) opens with the redaction of a traditional Mexican recipe followed by instructions for preparation. Each recipe recalls to the narrator a significant event in the protagonist's life.Elizabeth M. Willingham. \"Introduction.\" Laura Esquivel\u2019s Mexican Fictions. Sussex Academic P, 2010. 13\u201314. Esquivel has stated that she believes that the kitchen is the most important part of the house and characterizes it as a source of knowledge and understanding that brings pleasure.Cooking up passion the woman behind Like Water For Chocolate views the kitchen as the center of seduction for her stirring tale of love on the sly. Candice Russell. Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, FL). Features Arts & Leisure, Pg. 1D. April 25, 1993. The title Como agua para chocolate is a phrase used in Mexico to refer to someone whose emotions are about to \"boil,\" because water for chocolate must be just at the boil when the chocolate is added and beaten.Willingham. 2010. \"Glossary.\" \"chocolate,\" \"como agua para chocolate.\" 226\u2013227. The idea for the novel came to Esquivel \"while she was cooking the recipes of her mother and grandmother.\" Reportedly, \"Esquivel used an episode from her own family to write her book. She had a great-aunt named Tita who was forbidden to wed and spent her life caring for her mother. Soon after her mother died, so did Tita.\" According to Esquivel critic Elizabeth M. Willingham, despite the fact that the novel was poorly received critically in Mexico, Como agua para chocolate \"created a single-author economic boom, unprecedented in Mexican literature or film of any period by any author\" and \"went into second and third printings in the first year of its release and reached the second place in sales in 1989\" and \"became Mexico\u2019s 'bestseller' in 1990\".Willingham. \"Introduction: Early Critical Reception.\"'2010. 5\u20138. The novel has been translated into more than 20 languages.\"Kitchen is home's heart for 'Chocolate' author Esquivel. Deirdre Donahue. USA Today Life; Pg. 8D. November 18, 1993. Like Water for Chocolate was developed into a film, which was released in 1994 concurrently with the book's English translation by Carol Christensen and Thomas Christensen. In the United States, Like Water for Chocolate became one of the largest grossing foreign films ever released. The film \"dominated\" Mexico's film awards and received ten Arieles and, according to Susan Karlin in Variety (1993), the fine-tuned final version of the film garnered \"'nearly two dozen' international awards\".Willingham.

Esquivel's second novel, La ley del amor (Grijalbo 1995 Mexico), translated as The Law of Love (trans. Margaret Sayers Peden, Crown\u2013Random, 1996), is described by literary critic Lydia H. Rodr\u00edguez as a \"narrative [that] deconstructs the present to create a twenty-third century where remarkable invention and familiar elements populate a gymnastically-paced text\" whose \"conflicts . . . set the Law of Love (as a cosmic philosophy) in motion\" Rodr\u00edguez. \"Laura Esquivel's Quantum Leap in The Law of Love.\" Ed. Willingham. 153\u2013162. Literary critic Elizabeth Coonrod Mart\u00ednez cautions, \"Although Esquivel merges science fiction trappings with a love story in the novel, . . . [the author] attempts a blueprint for a harmonious future that remains beyond the experience of present societies, a future anchored by a central philosophy that individual wholeness can be achieved only by participation in and on behalf of the community\" Coonrod Mart\u00ednez. \"Cultural Identity and the Cosmos: Laura Esquivel\u2019s Predictions for a New Millennium in The Law of Love. 136\u2013152. Esquivel's non-fiction compilation Between Two Fires (NY: Crown, 2000) featured essays on life, love, and food. Esquivel's third novel, Tan veloz como el deseo (Barcelona: Plaza y Jan\u00e9s, 2001), translated into English as Swift as Desire (Trans. Stephen A. Lytle.

For the first time in this novel, according to critic Willingham, \"Esquivel asks the reader to consider Mexico\u2019s historical dialogue and [its] enduring truths\" in a contemporary setting in which the characters seek a meaningful and lasting reconciliation that rises above historical errors and misunderstandings Willingham. \"The Two Mexicos of Swift as Desire. Ed. Willingham 2010. 163\u2013172. Esquivel's fourth novel Malinche: novela (NY: Atria, 2006), translated as Malinche: A Novel (Trans. Ernesto Mestre-Reed.

Willingham. 2010. 173\u2013196. According to critic Ryan Long, Esquivel's naming of her title character and her novel \"reflects upon the diverse and unpredictable revisions that [Malinalli/La Malinche's] mythical identity has undergone continuously since the period of the Conquest. . . . seek[ing] a middle ground between Malinalli\u2019s autonomy and Malinche\u2019s predetermination\" Long.\"Esquivel's Malinalli: Refusing the Last Word on La Malinche.\" Ed Willingham. 2010. 197\u2013207.
