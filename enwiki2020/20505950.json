In only their third season in top- flight football, they finished in 3rd place behind Liverpool and Sunderland. This was another good season following on from their FA Cup triumph the previous season. ==Squad at the start of the season== ==Review== Following the success at Stamford Bridge in the previous season's FA Cup Final, many were hoping that this new found form would transfer itself into a successful league campaign and even a possible chance of the 1st Division title. However, Town had a bad start, only winning 2 of their first 10 games. So Herbert Chapman brought in Charlie Wilson from Tottenham Hotspur. His 13 goals helped Town mount a charge up the table along with the goals of Ernie Islip, Billy Smith and Frank Mann. They would eventually finish only 7 points behind defending champions Liverpool. ==Squad at the end of the season== ==Results== === Division One=== {| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse:collapse; text-align:center; font-size:smaller;\" |- style=\"background:#f0f6ff;\" !Date !Opponents !Home/ Away !Result F - A !Scorers !Attendance !Position |- bgcolor=\"#ffffdd\" |26 August 1922 |Middlesbrough |A |2 - 2 |Islip, B.
