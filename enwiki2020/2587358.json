    "text": "Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown is the 28th prime-time animated television special based on the comic strip Peanuts by Charles M. Schulz. It was originally aired on the CBS network on March 20, 1985. ==Plot== Snoopy is performing guard duty for Peppermint Patty, but gets sidetracked when he meets a beautiful dog named Fifi (called Genevieve in this special). Soon after, Snoopy decides to get married, and wants his brother Spike to be the Best Beagle at his wedding, resulting in Spike traveling a long way from Needles, California and trying to earn money by competing in a dog race, only to be disqualified for being a beagle and not a greyhound. Snoopy is at first excited, but soon grows nervous at the prospect of marriage, acting miserable at his own bachelor party, and even breaking down into tears hours before the wedding. At the ceremony, everything is in order, until it seems Genevieve is late. Lucy soon arrives with news that Genevieve fell in love with a golden retriever and ran off with him, meaning that the wedding is off. Snoopy is heartbroken at first, but soon lightens up at the prospect of remaining a bachelor, and enjoys salad with Woodstock. Spike returns home to his residence, a gigantic hollowed-out cactus with electricity and modern amenities, and the show ends by Spike enjoying part of the wedding cake by himself. ==Production== Snoopy's Getting Married, Charlie Brown was based on a comic strip story in 1977 (later published as The Beagle Has Landed). In the original strip, Snoopy's bride-to-be is never seen, and it is Spike that the bride falls for. ==Voice actors== * Brett Johnson: Charlie Brown * Jeremy Schoenberg: Linus van Pelt * Stacy Ferguson: Sally Brown and Violet * Heather Stoneman: Lucy van Pelt * Gini Holtzman: Peppermint Patty * Keri Houlihan: Marcie * Danny Colby: Schroeder * Dawnn D.
