    "text": "Specific detectivity, or D*, for a photodetector is a figure of merit used to characterize performance, equal to the reciprocal of noise-equivalent power (NEP), normalized per square root of the sensor's area and frequency bandwidth (reciprocal of twice the integration time). Specific detectivity is given by D^*=\\frac{\\sqrt{A \\Delta f}}{NEP}, where A is the area of the photosensitive region of the detector, \\Delta f is the bandwidth, and NEP the noise equivalent power in units [W]. It is commonly expressed in Jones units (cm \\cdot \\sqrt{Hz}/ W) in honor of Robert Clark Jones who originally defined it.R. C. Jones, \"Quantum efficiency of photoconductors,\" Proc. IRIS 2, 9 (1957)R. C. Jones, \"Proposal of the detectivity D** for detectors limited by radiation noise,\" J. Opt. Soc. Am. 50, 1058 (1960), ) Given that noise- equivalent power can be expressed as a function of the responsivity \\mathfrak{R} (in units of A/W or V/W) and the noise spectral density S_n (in units of A/Hz^{1/2} or V/Hz^{1/2}) as NEP=\\frac{S_n}{\\mathfrak{R}}, it is common to see the specific detectivity expressed as D^*=\\frac{\\mathfrak{R}\\cdot\\sqrt{A}}{S_n}. It is often useful to express the specific detectivity in terms of relative noise levels present in the device. A common expression is given below. D^* = \\frac{q\\lambda \\eta}{hc} \\left[\\frac{4kT}{R_0 A}+2q^2 \\eta \\Phi_b\\right]^{-1/2} With q as the electronic charge, \\lambda is the wavelength of interest, h is Planck's constant, c is the speed of light, k is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature of the detector, R_0A is the zero-bias dynamic resistance area product (often measured experimentally, but also expressible in noise level assumptions), \\eta is the quantum efficiency of the device, and \\Phi_b is the total flux of the source (often a blackbody) in photons/sec/cm\u00b2. ==Detectivity measurement== Detectivity can be measured from a suitable optical setup using known parameters. You will need a known light source with known irradiance at a given standoff distance. The incoming light source will be chopped at a certain frequency, and then each wavelength will be integrated over a given time constant over a given number of frames. In detail, we compute the bandwidth \\Delta f directly from the integration time constant t_c. \\Delta f = \\frac{1}{2 t_c} Next, an average signal and rms noise needs to be measured from a set of N frames. This is done either directly by the instrument, or done as post-processing. \\text{Signal}_{\\text{avg}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\big( \\sum_i^{N} \\text{Signal}_i^2 \\big) \\text{Noise}_{\\text{rms}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_i^N (\\text{Signal}_i - \\text{Signal}_{\\text{avg}})^2} Now, the computation of the radiance H in W/sr/cm\u00b2 must be computed where cm\u00b2 is the emitting area. Next, emitting area must be converted into a projected area and the solid angle; this product is often called the etendue. This step can be obviated by the use of a calibrated source, where the exact number of photons/s/cm\u00b2 is known at the detector. If this is unknown, it can be estimated using the black-body radiation equation, detector active area A_d and the etendue. This ultimately converts the outgoing radiance of the black body in W/sr/cm\u00b2 of emitting area into one of W observed on the detector. The broad-band responsivity, is then just the signal weighted by this wattage. R = \\frac{\\text{Signal}_{\\text{avg}}}{H G} = \\frac{\\text{Signal}_{\\text{avg}}}{\\int dH dA_d d\\Omega_{BB}} Where, * R is the responsivity in units of Signal / W, (or sometimes V/W or A/W) * H is the outgoing radiance from the black body (or light source) in W/sr/cm\u00b2 of emitting area * G is the total integrated etendue between the emitting source and detector surface * A_d is the detector area * \\Omega_{BB} is the solid angle of the source projected along the line connecting it to the detector surface. From this metric noise-equivalent power can be computed by taking the noise level over the responsivity. \\text{NEP} = \\frac{\\text{Noise}_{\\text{rms}}}{R} = \\frac{\\text{Noise}_{\\text{rms}}}{\\text{Signal}_{\\text{avg}}}H G Similarly, noise-equivalent irradiance can be computed using the responsivity in units of photons/s/W instead of in units of the signal. Now, the detectivity is simply the noise-equivalent power normalized to the bandwidth and detector area. D^* = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta f A_d}}{\\text{NEP}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{\\Delta f A_d}}{H G} \\frac{\\text{Signal}_{\\text{avg}}}{\\text{Noise}_{\\text{rms}}} == References == Category:Physical quantities Category:Infrared imaging ",
