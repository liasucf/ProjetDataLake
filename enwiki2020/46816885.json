    "text": "The Mississippi and Tennessee Railroad was an American railroad constructed in the 1850s, connecting Memphis, Tennessee with Grenada, Mississippi. In Grenada, the line connected with the Mississippi Central Railroad. ==History== The railroad was incorporated on October 16, 1852, and enabled cotton plantations in the Mississippi Delta to ship their product to Memphis, where it was loaded onto steamboats and transported to New Orleans. The city of Batesville, Mississippi was founded following the construction of the railway, and drew its residents from surrounding communities. During the Civil War, the railroad's trestle over the Coldwater River was destroyed by Federal troops. Following the war, the railroad was \"a complete wreck, and literally without rolling stock\". The railroad was purchased in 1886 by the Illinois Central Railroad. ==Current use== The line is currently used by the Grenada Railway. ==References== Category:Defunct Mississippi railroads Category:Defunct Tennessee railroads Category:Predecessors of the Illinois Central Railroad Category:Railway companies established in 1852 Category:Railway companies disestablished in 1886 Category:1852 establishments in Mississippi Category:American companies established in 1852 Category:American companies disestablished in 1886 ",
