    "text": "The Lima 750 and 800 hp switchers were diesel-electric switching locomotives built between November 1949 and June 1951, by Lima Locomotive Works of Lima, Ohio, U.S.A.. The LS-750 is a switcher. It was later upgraded to by changing fuel rack settings. Both models used the same turbocharged Hamilton T-69-SA four-stroke, six cylinder inline diesel engine, a Westinghouse generator and 4 Westinghouse traction motors. All six LS-750s were sold to a single railroad, with two being sold after the LS-800 had been introduced. The 23 LS-800s were sold to just two railroads. Lima-Hamilton did not assign model numbers to their models but referred to them by specification numbers. Model designations such as LS-750 or LS-800 were a railfan invention. Lima-Hamilton assigned A-3149 as the specification number for the 750 hp model, and A-3171 as the specification number for the 800 hp model. ==Original owners== ===LS-750=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Railroad!!Qty!!Road Numbers!!Notes |- |Cincinnati Union Terminal (Whitewater Valley Railroad) ||6||20\u201325|| |- |} ===LS-800=== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Railroad!!Qty!!Road Numbers!!Notes |- |Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad||2||800\u2013801|| |- |Chicago River and Indiana Railroad (subsidiary of New York Central Railroad)||21||9800\u20139820|| |- |} ==Preservation== The last extant LS-750, former Cincinnati Union Terminal 25, is operated by the Whitewater Valley Railroad == References == * * Category:B-B locomotives LS-0750 Category:Railway locomotives introduced in 1949 Category:Standard gauge locomotives of the United States ",
