    "text": "Charles Paget Wade (1883\u20131956) was an English architect, artist-craftsman and poet; today he is perhaps best remembered for the eclectic collection he amassed during his life, a collection which can be seen at Snowshill Manor, his former home in the village of Snowshill, Gloucestershire, which he gave to the National Trust in 1951. ==Life== Wade was the son of Paget Augustus (1849\u20131911) and Amy (1858-1943) Wade,http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-53029;jsessionid=1264B58E31399F23F33AE6AD126663B1 who owned several sugar estates in the West Indies.https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/snowshill-manor-and- garden/features/who-was-charles-wade From an early age, Wade wanted to become an architect. After he qualified as an Associate of the Royal Institute of British Architects in 1907, he went to work for Raymond Unwin, one of the founders of the architectural partnership of Parker and Unwin, major proponents of the Arts and Crafts Movement. There he worked with M.H. Baillie Scott, to whom he would later turn for help in designing the gardens at Snowshill Manor. In 1911 Wade's father died and he inherited a share in the family business based on sugar estates on the island of St Kitts in the West Indies. After service in France during World War I, Wade purchased the estate at Snowshill in 1919, first restoring the Manor House and laying out the gardens from 1920 to 1923. Having started collecting at the age of 7, Wade eventually built up a collection of more than 22000 items of furniture, clothing, paintings, and many other pieces which reflected his interest in colour, design and good craftsmanship. He housed the collection in the Manor House at Snowshill, choosing to live in a small cottage in the garden. He continued to add to his collection over the years. Wade married in 1946. His spouse, Mary McEwan Gore Graham (1902\u20131999), was working in the nearby village of Broadway during World War II when she first visited Snowshill Manor in 1945. After the marriage they spent increasingly greater amounts of time at their house in the West Indies. Wade gave the estate to the National Trust in 1951. He died in 1956 during a visit to England and is buried in the village churchyard with other members of his family. In addition to the many drawings and paintings he produced for his own interest, Wade also illustrated the travel guide Bruges by Mary Stratton (1914) and The Spirit of the House by Kate Murray (1915). ==References== ==Further reading== * ==External links== *Charles Wade and Snowshill Manor in the Cotswold Review * Charles Wade's biography *A Cotswolds Ghost Story Article about Charles Wade and Snowshill manor on Brian Haughton's website. * Category:Architects from Kent Category:20th-century English painters Category:English male painters Category:English illustrators Category:1883 births Category:1956 deaths ",
