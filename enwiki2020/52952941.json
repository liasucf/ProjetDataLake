    "text": "Future Community Park 459 is a $51 million (CAD) approved park including \"series of domes, artificial turfs, trails, and a community centre, set to begin construction in Mid-Late 2017, and be completed in 2019. The park is located in Churchill Meadows, Mississauga, Ontario. The centre is located at 5320 Ninth Line. The site is by relatively flat lands, and contains a protected wooded wetland. It is located between Highway 407 and a sixteen-mile creek to the west, and to the East, is the main part of the Churchill Meadows community. The future facility is meant to be done in different phases over the years. ==Ideas for Lot== In mid 2014, the City of Mississauga Ward 10 announced to local residents that they would be building a community park, including a recreational facility, and outdoor recreation as well. They would be building this at the Ninth Line corridor opposite Tacc Drive at its northern point and opposite Burdette Terrace toward the southern part. In late 2014, studies showed that a city-built and operated community centre is the preferred approach for the proposed indoor recreation facility in the city's northwest end. In September 2015, the city approved funding for a pool to be added to the community centre. ==Design and Construction == Ward 10 of Mississauga, Ontario held many public gatherings to discuss the community centre and its design. On December 15, 2016, a concept design photo of the development was released to the public. To date, $360,000 has been spent on the $51 million landmark project. Most of this expenditure is for design of the building, including the 25-metre pool, therapeutic tank and aquatic- related rooms. The centre and area for phase one would include: * Community centre - with pool, gymnasium and meeting space * Two lit artificial turf soccer fields, one with a seasonal dome * Natural area enhancements * Multipurpose trails, measured loop trail * Pond and overlook * Temporary dog leash free zone * Parks Operations space * Site servicing, infrastructure and parking The park is intended to be used by area residents and organized sports groups.
