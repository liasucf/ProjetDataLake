On the other hand, Narendra and Veena have chosen for her a wealthy suitor from Delhi; and the boy is very religious minded. Not wanting to hurt her parents, Anjali finally gives in and marries Rambhan \"Ram\" Verma (Akshay Kumar), the boy who her parents believe will be a perfect match for her.

He is very controlled and handles this difficult role with sincerity.\" Dhadkan : Movie Review by Taran Adarsh Padmaraj Nair of Screen felt the film had a \"nostalgic feel to it, what with the effect of watching social drama from the good ol' 60s.\" He added that the film was \"fairly interesting in the first half, with its slick screenplay, But the director does seem to lose his grip towards the end, as the film climaxes rather tamely. It seems as if he developed cold feet as far as justifying the grey role of Sunil Shetty is concerned, and ends up portraying him on a positive note.\" He felt, performance-wise, Shetty \"scores over the rest\", while adding, \"Shilpa gets the best role of her career and doesn't disappoint. Akshay Kumar, in the role of the cool-headed husband, is impressive.\" On other departments of the film, he concluded writing, \"Nadeem-Shravan's music is the very lifeline of the film, and all the tracks are melodious and situational. Cinematography by WB Rao is outstanding.\" ==Awards== ;Filmfare Awards * Best Female Playback - Alka Yagnik - \"Dil Ne Yeh Kaha Hain Dil Se\" * Best Villain - Sunil Shetty Nominated * Best Choreography * Best Director - Dharmesh Darshan * Best Movie - Dharmesh Darshan * Best Lyricist - Sameer - \"Tum Dil Ki Dhadkan Mein\". * Best Music Director - Nadeem\u2013Shravan * Best Male Playback - Udit Narayan - \"Dil Ne Yeh Kaha Hai\". * Best Supporting Actress - Mahima Chaudhry ;International Indian Film Academy Awards Nominated * Best Actor - Akshay Kumar * Best Actress - Shilpa Shetty * Best Supporting Actress - Mahima Chaudhry * Best Movie - Dharmesh Darshan * Best Story - Dharmesh Darshan * Best Director - Dharmesh Darshan * Best Female - Alka Yagnik - \"Dil Ne Yeh Kaha Hai\". * Best Lyricist - Sameer - \"Dil Ne Yeh Kaha Hai\". * Best Lyricist - Sameer - \"Tum Dil Ki Dhadkan Mein\". * Best Male Playback - Abhijeet- \"Tum Dil Ki Dhadkan Mein\". * Best Music Director - Nadeem\u2013Shravan * Best Villain - Sunil Shetty ;Screen Awards Won * Best Publicity Design \u2014 Himanshu Nanda, Rahul Nanda * Best Negative Role Film Fare Award - Sunil Shetty .
