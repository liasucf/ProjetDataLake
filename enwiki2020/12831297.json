    "text": "Do\u00f1a Rosita the Spinster () is a period play by the 20th-century Spanish dramatist Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca. It is subtitled \"or The Language of the Flowers\" and described as \"a poem of 1900 Granada, divided into various gardens, with scenes of song and dance\".Garc\u00eda Lorca (1970, 133). It was written in 1935 and first performed in the same year. \"The theme of the play\", suggests Federico Garc\u00eda Lorca, \"is the passage of time\" (which Lorca had developed in a different form in his experimental surrealist play When Five Years Pass in 1931).Garc\u00eda Lorca (1963, 18). Do\u00f1a Rosita is a young woman who falls in love with a man who is called to South America to join his parents. He swears to return and Rosita waits, but learns that he has married someone else. Lorca portrays what he called \"the grotesque treatment of women\" in Spain.Leslie Stainton (1999). The action is set in Granada, Spain in three different years, portraying the bourgeois life of the 1880s and the social modernization and beginning of World War I of the early 1900s. Lorca draws parallels between Do\u00f1a Rosita's life and these historic periods, beginning with the vitality of her youth, the attainment of maturity, and finally the loss of all hope. The key moment in the play occurs when a young relative addresses Rosita as Do\u00f1a Rosita. This form of address signals her change of status. ==Works cited== * Garc\u00eda Lorca, Federico. 1970.
