    "text": "Ornis Svecica is a peer-reviewed scientific journal covering all aspects of ornithology. It was established in 1991 and is published by BirdLife Sverige. Since it was established, S\u00f6ren Svensson (Lund University) has been editor-in- chief. Until 2018 it appeared in print, after that it is published online only. The journal originally focused on Swedish birds and Swedish ornithology, but soon changed to primarily deal with the European bird fauna, and the current geographic scope is global. Articles are published in English or Swedish, with an extensive summary in the other language. The journal was published quarterly until 2018, but as an online journal publication is now continuous. ==Abstracting and indexing== The journal is abstracted and indexed in: *Aquatic Sciences and Fisheries Abstracts *Biological Abstracts *BIOSIS Previews *GEOBASE *ProQuest databases *Scopus *The Zoological Record ==References== ==External links== * Category:Creative Commons Attribution- licensed journals Category:Publications established in 1991 Category:Journals and magazines relating to birding and ornithology Category:Multilingual journals Category:Continuous journals Category:English-language journals Category:Swedish-language journals ",
