    "text": "Prettyblack is the second solo studio album by Prince Po, one half of American hip hop duo Organized Konfusion. It was released on Nasty Habits Entertainment and Traffic Entertainment Group in 2006. ==Critical reception== Lyndon of Cyclic Defrost gave the album a mixed review, stating that \"[Prince Po's] gruff voice is immediately arresting on [the album's] opening tunes, but further on, the vocal stylings seem to meander into uninspiring territory, not taking the listener to anywhere new or dynamic.\" ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the CD edition's liner notes. * Prince Po \u2013 vocals, production (2, 6, 9, 13) * Finale \u2013 production (1) * Madlib \u2013 production (3) * 2Mex \u2013 vocals (4) * C.J. \u2013 production (4, 11), vocals (6) * Chas West \u2013 vocals (5) * DJ Rhettmatic \u2013 turntables (5) * Large Professor \u2013 production (5) * Presto \u2013 vocals (6) * Soulsearchin \u2013 production (7) * Touchem Black \u2013 additional vocals (8) * Rockwilder \u2013 production (8) * China Black \u2013 vocals (10) * Ammoncontact \u2013 production (10) * Concise Kilgore \u2013 vocals (13) * Brisk \u2013 production (14) ==References== ==External links== * Category:2006 albums Category:Prince Po albums Category:Albums produced by Madlib Category:Albums produced by Large Professor Category:Albums produced by Rockwilder ",
