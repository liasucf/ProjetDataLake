Unable to secure the PRD ticket, he was ultimately selected as the candidate of the New Alliance Party; however, ten days before the election, he called on New Alliance supporters to vote for the PRI-PVEM coalition candidate Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aguilar Bodegas instead, in a last-ditch attempt to prevent the PRD from winning.
