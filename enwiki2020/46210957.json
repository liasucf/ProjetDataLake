    "text": "A Royal Night Out is a 2015 British romantic comedy-drama film directed by Julian Jarrold and written by Trevor de Silva and Kevin Hood. The film stars Sarah Gadon as the teenaged Princess Elizabeth, who, with younger sister Princess Margaret (Bel Powley), ventures out of Buckingham Palace to enjoy the VE Day celebrations. ==Plot== On VE Day in 1945, as peace is declared across Europe and London is celebrating, Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret are allowed to join the celebrations, against the Queen's wishes. The King, impressed by Elizabeth's pleading, asks her to report back on the people's feelings towards him and his midnight speech on the radio. Each girl, incognito, is chaperoned by an army officer with an itinerary to be back at Buckingham Palace by 1 a.m. Soon realising the Queen's planned itinerary does not fulfil their expectations of fun and meeting the ordinary people, Margaret is the first to slip away from her escort, followed by Elizabeth. The princesses are separated on two different buses. Margaret is befriended by a naval officer seeking to take advantage of what he believes is just an ordinary girl, and Elizabeth by an airman who is absent without leave. Margaret is led by her naval officer into a world of nightclubs, gambling, spiked drinks and brothels. Elizabeth and her airman have their own adventures trying to catch up with Margaret, which take them far beyond the 1 a.m. deadline into the early hours of the following morning. ==Cast== The character of Pryce is credited as a Lieutenant, but is shown as, and referred to as, Captain Pryce throughout the film. ==Relation to actual events== The two officer escorts and the airman in the screenplay were fictional creations. In reality, the princesses in an organised group of 16 went out at 10 p.m. to mingle with revellers, and returned to Buckingham Palace at 1 a.m. ==Release== A Royal Night Out was released in the United Kingdom on 8 May 2015 and on DVD on 7 September 2015. The film was released in the United States on 4 December 2015, and released on DVD on 3 May 2016. ==Critical reception== On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 73% approval rate of critics based on 71 reviews, with an average quality rating of 5.8/10. The site's consensus states: \"Undeniably slight yet thoroughly charming, A Royal Night Out uses a fascinating historical footnote as a springboard into a fun dramedy diversion.\" Metacritic reports a 59 out of 100 rating, based on 16 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". ==References== ==External links== * * * * * Category:2015 films Category:2010s historical comedy-drama films Category:2015 romantic comedy-drama films Category:2010s historical romance films Category:British films Category:British historical comedy-drama films Category:British romantic comedy-drama films Category:Cultural depictions of George VI Category:English-language films Category:Films about Elizabeth II Category:Films directed by Julian Jarrold Category:Films set in 1945 Category:Films set in England Category:Films shot in Brussels Category:Films shot in Derbyshire Category:Films shot in Yorkshire Category:British historical romance films Category:Biographical films about British royalty Category:Lionsgate films ",
