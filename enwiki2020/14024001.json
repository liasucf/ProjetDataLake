    "text": "In Your Mind is the fourth solo studio album by Bryan Ferry, the lead vocalist for Roxy Music. It was his first solo album of all original songs. As Ferry's first solo all-original LP effort, released after Roxy Music went on a four- year hiatus, it was supported by an extensive tour. ==Critical reception== Reviewing for AllMusic, critic Ned Raggett wrote of the album \"On balance, though, In Your Mind remains the secret highlight of Ferry's musical career, an energetic album that would have received far more attention as a full Roxy release.\"http://www.allmusic.com/album/in-your-mind-mw0000193791 And the critic Robert Christgau wrote of the album \"Ferry has custom-designed a new line of songs for his solo concept, rather than borrowing from early Roxy or his humble forebears, and especially on side one the stuff is appealingly down-to- earth.\"http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?id=191&name;=Bryan+Ferry The album was given a three and half star review in the Rolling Stone Album Guide with the following comments \"In Your Mind strives for the windswept, bracing impact of Roxy Music's classic Siren. The surfeit of Ferry's compostions is gratifying, though even the hookiest (\"Tokyo Joe,\" \"Party Doll\") merely restate Roxy's familiar romantic and musical themes.\"DeCurtis, Anthony (Ed.). \"Bryan Ferry\".
