    "text": "{| |} AIDAnova is a cruise ship built by Meyer Werft GmbH in Papenburg, Germany under contract from Carnival Corporation for AIDA Cruises. The first of the new ships, she was launched on 21 August 2018 and delivered on 12 December 2018. She has two sister ships scheduled for delivery in 2021 and 2023. == General information == The ship is the first cruise ship in the world that can operate completely using liquefied natural gas (LNG), like the cruiseferry . Her delivery was marred by delays, with rising complications arising from her engineering being the first-of-its-kind for a ship of her scale. In October 2018, the first postponement was announced, cancelling all preview cruises that were scheduled. A small fire had also broken out during its construction in the shipyard, delaying her sea trials. Her maiden voyage was then scheduled for 2 December 2018 from Hamburg. Later, in November 2018, a second postponement was announced. Her sea trials were scheduled to begin on 16 November 2018 and all work was scheduled to be completed by 30 November 2018. AIDAnova was delivered on 12 December 2018 and her maiden voyage was on 19 December 2018 for a seven-day cruise from Santa Cruz de Tenerife around the Canary Islands and Madeira. As of September 2019, AIDAnova was sailing on cruises around the Mediterranean and Canary Islands. ==References== ==External links== * AIDA Cruises official site page about the ship Category:2018 ships Category:Cruise ships Category:Ships built in Papenburg nova ",
