    "text": "The Human Resources Development Fund (Hadaf) is a Saudi governmental authority that was established by a royal decree in July 2000. It falls under the Saudi Ministry of Labor and Social Development. HRDF is mainly concerned with providing financial support to organizations that train and qualify Saudis in the private sector. Thus, in order to motivate the private sector in Saudi Arabia to hire Saudi citizens, HRDF pays 30% of the salaries paid to Saudis working in the private sector in the first year of employment. Moreover, Hadaf supports Saudi entrepreneurs. == Online Portal == HRDF has launched an online portal to facilitate entrepreneurs. The portal provides an interactive support to entrepreneurs and small businesses throughout the phases of project establishment. This includes giving them ideas, financial solutions and information to help them making decisions. == Saudi Women Empowerment Program == The program aims at encouraging Saudi women to enter the workforce in Saudi Arabia. HRDF has launched two programs namely, \u2018Qurrat\u2019 and \u2018Wusool\u2019. \"Qurrat\" is responsible for providing the working mothers a hospitality service for their children, \"Wusool\" provides Saudi female workers with the necessary transportation fees. However, \"Wusool\" program has received criticism by many working ladies as it does not pay such fees for female employees until they complete working for three years in the same private company. == E-summer Camp == In 2019, HADAF launched an online training course program in collaboration with a number of parties. The main aim of the program is to qualify university students, fresh graduates and entrepreneurs and prepare them for the job market. == See also == * Ministry of Labor and Social Development *Saudization == External links == Human Resources Development Fund / ==References == Category:Government agencies of Saudi Arabia Category:2000 establishments in Saudi Arabia ",
