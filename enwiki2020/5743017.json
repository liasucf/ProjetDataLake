    "text": "This is a chronological list of Australian rules football clubs since their formation. Note that some of these football clubs that formed before 1866 (see Laws of Australian football) may not have originally played the game known today as Australian rules football. It is more than likely that most of these clubs were influenced the Melbourne Rules of 1859 which were the dominant rules of the day. However many played by their own rules and often compromised rules when playing against other clubs. ==Australian rules football clubs by date of establishment== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 85%;\" !style=\"width:12%;\"|Founding Date !style=\"width:12%;\"|Football Club !style=\"width:10%;\"|City !style=\"width:10%;\"|State !style=\"width:2%;\"| !style=\"width:9%;\"|Senior Team !style=\"width:35%;\"|Note |- |1858 ||Melbourne ||Melbourne ||style=\"background:#000D5F;\" |Victoria |||Australian Football League || Origins can be traced to an 1858 letter in which Tom Wills calls for the formation of a \"foot-ball club\" with the need of a \"code of laws\".Bell's Life in Victoria, 10 July 1858The Footballer An annual Record of Football in Victoria, 1875100 Years of Football, The Story of the Melbourne Football Club, 1958 |- |1858 ||South Yarra\u2020 ||Melbourne ||style=\"background:#000D5F;\" |Victoria ||| style=\"background:black; color:white;\" | Defunct ||Played it first game against Melbourne on 25 September 1858.
