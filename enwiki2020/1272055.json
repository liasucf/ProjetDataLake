His father worked at a local supermarket and his mother was a housewife. When Su\u00e1rez was a child, he went with his mother to see a play. This was his first experience with the theater and Su\u00e1rez was so impressed that after the curtains rose and the actors did their show, he knew that he wanted to become an actor. Su\u00e1rez went to school and received his primary and secondary education in his hometown. When Su\u00e1rez and his sister returned from school, their mother would read stories or prepare little plays which helped to develop their imagination.Suarez The supermarket where the elder Su\u00e1rez worked was located next to the radio station \"Radio El Mundo\". Manuel M\u00e9ndez Ballester, a well known playwright, who worked as a writer for the radio station, would frequently visit the supermarket and Su\u00e1rez's father soon became friends with Ballester. In 1947, Ballester told the elder Su\u00e1rez that he was in need of an 8-year-old for the protagonist role in a play that he wrote, because the person he had in mind didn't pass the audition. When the elder Su\u00e1rez realized that the \"part\" paid more than what he was making working in the supermarket, he took his son to the audition and that was the beginning of Su\u00e1rez's acting career. In 1956, when Su\u00e1rez was 17 years old, he enlisted in the U.S. Navy and was assigned to the submarine division.
