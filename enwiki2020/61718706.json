    "text": "Global Research Network on Peaceful Change (GRENPEC) is a loosely organized group of scholars and institutions. It was founded for the study of peaceful change in world politics (at the international and regional levels). The platform was set up in order to form new initiatives, connect scholars and publish existing projects in this area of political science in an accessible manner. There are two forms of partnerships at present: for institutions and individual scholars. == History== The research network was formally inaugurated during a special panel held on this subject at the International Studies Association conference in Toronto in March 2019. Multiple scholars in the field attended the meeting. The first project by the GRENPEC, International Studies Review Journal Issue: Understanding Change in World Politics, was completed in June 2018. There was a special issue published in the International Studies Review. At the International Studies Association (ISA) 2017 Conference in Baltimore, 19 papers presented are in the special issue and 7 of them discuss Peaceful Change specifically. In June 2019, GRENPEC signed the contract for the Handbook on Peaceful Change in International Relations with Oxford University Press. It is planned for publication in the fall of 2021. ==References== Category:Pacifists Category:Political organizations ",
