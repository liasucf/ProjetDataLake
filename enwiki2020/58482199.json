Having signed a contract with Rayskaya, the company eventually dismissed her on the basis of creative disagreements, transferring the shooting to Tigran Keosayan. Having filed a lawsuit for copyright infringement, Elena Rayskaya achieved a resolution banning filming before the end of the trial, and then the court's decision to ban the film company from using the author's name and original script name, as well as to promulgate the film created on its basis. Nevertheless, the film was released in the rental.\u041f\u0440\u0435\u0437\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0438 \u0435\u0433\u043e \u0432\u043d\u0443\u0447\u043a\u0430\u041d\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0439\u0448\u0430\u044f \u0438\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u043e\u0442\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043a\u0438\u043d\u043e ==References== == External links== * * The President and His Granddaughter on KinoPoisk Category:Russian comedy films Category:Russian films Category:2000 comedy films Category:New Year films Category:Films about twin sisters Category:Cultural depictions of Boris Yeltsin ",
