K-249's southern terminus is at K-99 in the City of Madison, and the northern terminus is at K-58 in the City of Madison. K-249 was originally a section of K-99 before it was realigned. ==Route description== K-249 begins at an intersection with K-99 and starts traveling north through the city of Madison. It continues for roughly where it intersects McCurry Street. From here it continues north for another roughly and intersects Elm Street. It continues on for another approximately and reaches its northern terminus at K-58, known as 4th Street and West Lincoln Street. The Kansas Department of Transportation (KDOT) tracks the traffic levels on its highways, and in 2017, they determined that on average the traffic was 790 vehicles per day on K-249. K-249 is not included in the National Highway System. The National Highway System is a system of highways important to the nation's defense, economy, and mobility. ==History== K-249 was first designated a state highway in a June 12, 1963 resolution, which was updated in a February 11, 1964 resolution. Before becoming K-249 it was a section of K-99, until K-99 was moved onto a new alignment slightly to the west of Madison. K-249's northern terminus was originally K-57, but in a September 20, 2004 resolution K-57's eastern terminus was truncated to end at K-4 in Dwight. Then the section of K-57 from K-99 east to US-169 was renumbered to K-58. ==Major intersections== ==References== ==External links== *Kansas Department of Transportation State Map *KDOT: Historic State Maps 249 Category:Transportation in Greenwood County, Kansas Category:State highways in the United States shorter than one mile ",
