    "text": "Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005 is a live album by the British rock band Cream, recorded at the Royal Albert Hall in 2005 during the band's reunion tour. As the title implies, the recording includes songs from their four reunion shows on 2, 3, 5, and 6 May 2005. Within five months of these performances, this collection of recordings was released as separate double Compact Disc and double DVD sets. Two months later in December, a triple LP set was also released,https://www.amazon.com/Cream-Live-Royal-Albert- Hall/dp/B00C1CHOK4/ref=tmm_vnl_title_0/183-3611860-5174322 containing tracks identical to the CD set. A Blu-ray version also exists.https://www.amazon.com/Cream-Royal-Albert-London-2-3-5-6/dp/B0009WFFS6 The album reached No. 59 on the Billboard 200 album chart on 22 October 2005. == Reception == === Critical === In his review for Allmusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the shows at the Royal Albert Hall did not live up to Cream's concerts in the past, including their 1993 induction performance for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, not necessarily all because of their age, but primarily having not played together for quite some time. J. D. Considine spoke much more highly of the shows because Cream were not as fixated with psychedelic jam sessions and sounded better than before. == Compact Disc track listing == ;Disc one #\"I'm So Glad\" (Skip James) \u2013 6:18 #\"Spoonful\" (Willie Dixon) \u2013 7:29 #\"Outside Woman Blues\" (Blind Joe Reynolds, arr.
