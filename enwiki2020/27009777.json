    "text": "Keezhadi () is a village near the village of Silaiman, on the border between Madurai and Sivagangai districts, in Tamil Nadu, India. The Keezhadi excavation site is located in this area: excavations carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and the Tamil Nadu Archaeology Department (TNAD) have revealed a Sangam era settlement dated to the 6th century BCE by radiocarbon dating. Claims that the results show that there was writing at that time have been challenged. It is not clear whether the potsherds containing inscriptions were found in the same archaeological layer as the 6th century samples, and University of Calcutta archaeologist Bishnupriya Basak said that This unfortunately is not clear from the report and is very crucial,\u201d adding that the issues of \u201clayer, period and absolute dates\u201d needed clarity. Dravidian University archaeologist E. Harsha Vardhan said that a single report was not enough to \"state scientifically that the Tamil-Brahmi script belongs to the sixth century BC\u201d. == Excavations == An archaeological survey team under Archaeologist Amarnath Ramakrishna was first conducted in 2013 in the vicinity of the Vaigai river from Theni district to Ramanathapuram district where the river meets the sea. During the study, 293 sites, including Keezhadi, were identified to have archaeological residues.
