It is located in the southeast of the country, bordered to the north by the department of Treinta y Tres to the east with Rocha, to the south with Canelones and Maldonado, and to the west to Florida. The department is named in honor of Brigadier Juan Antonio Lavalleja, who had distinguished military and political action in the country's independence. ==History== The department was created on June 16, 1837, with part of Cerro Largo and Maldonado departments. It was first named as Minas. In March 1888, it was asked that the Chamber of Deputies raised the settlement hierarchy of the village of Minas to be a town and to change the department's name to Lavalleja. The first was approved. From then, and until December 26, 1927, when the name was changed to Lavalleja, widespread debates about the matter were held. There was political will to designate a department under the name of the head of the Liberation Crusade, but not at the expense of Minas, even considering creating a new department named Lavalleja, being rejected afterwards. ==Geography== Most of the north border of the department is formed by the Olimar Chico River and Olimar Grande River. Most of the middle and north part of the department is crossed by many streams, flowing from northwest and south directions towards the northeast of the department, all being tributaries of R\u00edo Cebollati, which flows to the northeast and discharges into Lake Mer\u00edn, a natural border with Brazil. These streams, from north to south, are: Arroyo Guti\u00e9rrez, Arroyo de los Molles, Arroyo de los Chanchos, Arroyo Polanco, Arroyo Barriga Negra, Arroyo Tapes Grande, Arroyo Marmaraj\u00e1 and finally Arroyo Aigu\u00e1, which forms most of the east border of the department. In the south of the department, flowing from east to west is Santa Luc\u00eda River with its tributaries, Arroyo del Soldato, Arroyo Campanero Grande and Arroyo Verd\u00fan. Another stream in the south is Arroyo Sol\u00eds Grande, which forms part of the natural border with Canelones Department and flows south discharging into the R\u00edo de la Plata near Gregorio Azn\u00e1rez. The south part of the Cuchilla Grande hillrange crosses the department from the south to northwest. In the south and near Minas, there are two important tourist attractions, the hills of Cerro Arequita and Cerro Verd\u00fan (which is also a pilgrimage sanctuary). A bit further to the north is the hill Cerro Espuelitas. ==Population and demographics== Topographic map of Lavalleja Department showing main populated places and roads At the 2011 census, Lavalleja Department had a population of 58,815 (28,793 male and 30,022 female) and 27,644 households.
