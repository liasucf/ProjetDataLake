    "text": "First UK edition (publ. T. Fisher Unwin) The Arrow of Gold is a novel by Joseph Conrad, published in 1919. It was originally titled \"The Laugh\" and published serially in Lloyd's Magazine from December 1918 to February 1920.http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/conrad/pva47.html The story is set in Marseille in the 1870s during the Third Carlist War. The characters of the novel are supporters of the Spanish Pretender Carlos, Duke of Madrid. Curiously, the novel features a person referred to as \"Lord X\", whose activities as arms smuggler resemble those of the Carlist politician Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal y Lardiz\u00e1bal, Count of Arbelaiz.Conrad himself claimed to have smuggled arms for the Carlists along the Mediterranean coast, but there are conflicting views on authenticity of these accounts; some doubt it, see Zdzis\u0142aw Najder, \u017bycie Conrada-Korzeniowskiego, Warszawa 1980, , pp. 45-50, and some accept it, see Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, Affinity and Revulsion: Poland reacts to the Spanish Right (1936-1939), [in:] Marek Jan Chodakiewicz, John Radzilowski (eds.), Spanish Carlism and Polish Nationalism: The Borderlands of Europe in the 19th and 20th Centuries, Charlottesville 2003, , p. 48 The narrator of The Arrow of Gold has considerable involvement in the story and is unnamed. The principal theme is a love triangle which comprises the young narrator, Do\u00f1a Rita and the Confederate veteran Captain Blunt (named for Simon F. Blunt). Do\u00f1a Rita finances the operations of the narrator's vessel, Tremolino which smuggles ammunition to the Carlist army. Nautical operations are detailed in the Tremolino chaptersConrad, Joseph \"The Mirror of the Sea\", chap XL-XLV of The Mirror of the Sea rather than in this novel. Conrad dedicated the novel to his friend and literary assistant Richard Curle. ==See also== * Politics in fiction * Third Carlist War * Carlism * Carlos, Duke of Madrid * Tirso de Olaz\u00e1bal y Lardiz\u00e1bal ==References== ==External links== The Laugh (later called The Arrow of Gold) in Lloyd's Magazine (December, 1918-February, 1920).
