    "text": "Frame 394 is a Canadian documentary film, directed by Rich Williamson and released in 2016. The film centres on Daniel Voshart, a Canadian cinematographer and image stabilization specialist who reviewed the video of the shooting of Walter Scott, and claimed to have discovered evidence in frame 394 of the video \"that challenged the accepted narrative of what transpired between Slager and Scott\". The frame appears to show Scott's hands on Slager's taser at the time the officer reached for his gun. If true, this could create justification for use of force. The film discusses the moral conflict caused by the discovery, as the original intent was to find evidence that could be used to convict, not acquit the officer. The film premiered at the 2016 Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival. The film was named to the Toronto International Film Festival's annual year-end Canada's Top Ten list for 2016,\"TIFF announces lineup for Canada's Top 10 Film Festival\".
