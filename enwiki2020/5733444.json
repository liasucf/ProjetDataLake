    "text": "Altered Beast is the fourth album by alternative rock musician Matthew Sweet. It was released on Zoo Entertainment in 1993. ==Recording== Some of the album's guest musicians include: drummers Mick Fleetwood, Jody Stephens, and Pete Thomas; guitarists Richard Lloyd, Robert Quine, and Ivan Julian; keyboardist Nicky Hopkins,; and violinist Byron Berline. ==Cover== The cover of the album, produced in five different colored versions (yellow, blue, green, orange and purple), features a dinosaur logo. Originally, Sweet wanted to use the logo of the Japanese delivery company Yamato Transport on the cover, but was denied permission; Sweet has described the dinosaur design as a \"consolation prize\". ==Release== Initial responses to the record were mixed, with Rolling Stone writing that it had \"inspiring moments; the problem is finding them.\"O'Connor, Rob: Review: Matthew Sweet - Altered Beast, Rolling Stone, July 17, 1997. AllMusic agreed that the album is \"all over the place\", yet noted that \"it takes a bit of time for all of it to make sense, but after a few listens, it falls together.\" http://www.allmusic.com/album/altered- beast-mw0000619497 == Reissue == In 2018, independent vinyl reissue label Intervention Records announced that it would be releasing Artist-Approved 2 LP Expanded Editions of 100% Fun, Altered Beast, and Girlfriend. The three albums will also be released on CD/SACD. Intervention also announced a first time on vinyl reissue of Son of Altered Beast. ==Details== The title of the album is borrowed from the arcade game Altered Beast. Sweet told Spin magazine that the title meant \"whatever is inside you that someday might explode, and maybe you don't know it's there\", which he found similar to the game, where \"you have to find these little power-up things, and when you eat them you become the Altered Beast, this other creature that's really powerful and violent\".Kelly, Christian: King of Pop, Spin, September 1995.
