She finished second in Melodifestivalen 2020 with her song \"Bulletproof\", one point behind the winning song. ==Life and career== Dotter was born on 10 June 1987 in Arvika. She later moved to Stockholm and studied at the Kulturama music school. She chose the stage name \"Dotter\" (English: daughter) because she considers herself a \"daughter of Mother Earth\" due to her vegan lifestyle. She cites her major musical influences as Jefferson Airplane, Joni Mitchell, First Aid Kit, and Florence and the Machine. Her debut single \"My Flower\" was released in 2014, and she later performed at Musikhj\u00e4lpen which was broadcast on SVT. Dotter co-wrote the song \"A Million Years\" by Mariette Hansson for Melodifestivalen 2017. It went on to place fourth in the final. The following year, Dotter competed as a soloist in Melodifestivalen 2018 with the song \"Cry\". Despite being a favourite to win the competition, she placed sixth in her semi-final and was eliminated. She co-wrote the song \"Victorious\" performed by Lina Hedlund in Melodifestivalen 2019. It went on to place eleventh in the final. In the same festival Dotter performed the duet \"Walk with Me\" along with M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w as an interval act during the Second Chance round. She returned as a performer one year later, competing in Melodifestivalen 2020 with the song \"Bulletproof\"; Dotter competed in the second semi-final on 8 February, where she qualified directly for the final. She finished in second place, scoring a total of 136 points. ==Discography== ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:1em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\"| Album |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:85%;\"| SWE |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"My Flower\" | 2014 | \u2014 | rowspan=\"12\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dive\" | 2015 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Creatures of the Sun\" | 2016 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Evolution\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2017 | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Rebellion\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Cry\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2018 | 59 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Heatwave\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Walk with Me\" (with M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w) | rowspan=\"2\"| 2019 | 51 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I Do\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Bulletproof\" | rowspan=\"3\"| 2020 | 2 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Backfire\" | \u2014 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"I'm Sorry\" | \u2014 |} ==References== ==External links== Category:1987 births Category:21st-century Swedish women singers Category:21st-century Swedish singers Category:Living people Category:Melodifestivalen contestants Category:People from Arvika Municipality Category:Swedish female singers Category:Swedish female singer-songwriters Category:Swedish pop singers Category:Warner Music Group artists ",
