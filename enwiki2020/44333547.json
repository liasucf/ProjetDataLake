The history of Alarc\u00f3n is governed by its role as a stronghold; however, the castle is not the town\u2019s only precious heritage: it also claims a rich architectural variety, both religious (the Churches of Santo Domingo de Silos, San Juan Bautista, the Santa Trinidad, and Santa Mar\u00eda del Campo, as well as the Hermitage of Santa Mar\u00eda de la Orden), and civil (the town hall, the House of Villena, and the Casta\u00f1eda Palace). The town of Alarc\u00f3n was declared the site of a Historic-Artistic Grouping (Conjunto Hist\u00f3rico-Artistico) on July 3, 1981.

The castle sits atop a promontory inside a bend of the J\u00facar River, creating a formidable stronghold whose battlements provide an impressive view to the border with Valencia. The keep, built around 1460 by Castilian nobleman Juan Pacheco, serves as the fortress\u2019s trademark feature. The historical figure Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena, who wrote the Tales of Count Lucanor, once lived within the castle walls. The fortress was restored on various occasions throughout its history. In 1963, after years of neglect, the castle was expropriated from the Torrijos family by politician Manuel Fraga Iribarne and subsequently restored by the national tourism organization , who opened its doors as a parador hotel in 1966. Tours of the castle are currently offered by local guides. ===Church of Santo Domingo de Silos=== This 13th century church was built in the late Romanesque style. Of the original structure, both the semicircular apse in the nave and the southern portal have been preserved. The portal\u2019s splayed arch consists of three colonnettes per doorjamb, capped by pointed proto-Gothic archivolts. In the 16th century, the square tower and the walls of the nave were built following Renaissance designs, while the Baroque period saw the modification of the ceiling with a ribbed barrel vault. Today the church has been adapted for use as an exhibition hall and auditorium. It was declared a national monument on February 19, 1992. ===Art Center \u2013 The Murals of Alarc\u00f3n; Old Church of San Juan Bautista=== Church of San Juan Bautista The current structure dates from the 16th century as a replacement of the previous Romanesque building. It has a single nave covered with a barrel vault, a portal in the Herrerian style, and a tower that remains from the original church. Buttresses stabilize the lateral walls; however, contrary to custom, they are located in the interior and thus divide the space into smaller areas that serve as tiny chapels. In 1994, the young Spanish painter Jes\u00fas Mateo began the project of covering the totality of the old structure in a set of mural paintings. UNESCO has officially sponsored this work since 1997 for its global artistic interest, as it is considered one of the greatest examples of contemporary art worldwide. It has drawn more than 40,000 visitors annually since its opening to the public, and received support from many scholars and artists. ===Church of the Santa Trinidad=== This structure comprises two naves, dating from the 13th and 16th centuries respectively, although the vault in the older nave was built in the 15th century. Of note are its pointed ribbed side arches, its chancel arch, and its Renaissance altar. The original Romanesque apse, circular in form, has been replaced by the current rectangular one. The portal is typically Plateresque; it bears the coats of arms of the Marquis of Villena, Diego L\u00f3pez Pacheco, and of his contemporary, Bishop Diego Ram\u00edrez Villaescusa. The church tower stands on a portal known as the arco de la villa (town gate). ===Church of Santa Mar\u00eda del Campo=== Church of Santa Mar\u00eda del Campo. Portal.
