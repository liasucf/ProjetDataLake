He was born in C\u00f3rdoba, Spain, where he lived most of his life. His father was the famous painter Rafael Romero Barros and his mother was Rosario de Torres Delgado. Julio learned about art from his father who was the director, curator and founder of C\u00f3rdoba's Museo Provincial de Bellas Artes and an impressionist painter. He took an interest in art at a young age and started studying at the School of Fine Arts when he was 10. He went to Madrid to work and study in 1906. He also travelled all over Europe to study and he picked up a symbolist style, for which he is best known. A museum dedicated to the work of de Torres is situated at Plaza del Potro 1 Cordoba 14002. ==Style== Naranjas y limones (1927), by Julio Romero de Torres He spent most of his life living in C\u00f3rdoba and Madrid and both places had influences on his paintings. He combined many different styles when he painted because he had many different influences including realism, which was a popular style at that time and impressionism, which he picked up from living in C\u00f3rdoba and from his father. While in C\u00f3rdoba he became part of the late 19th century intellectual movement that was based on the Royal Academy of Science, Arts and Literature. Julio Romero also won many awards in his lifetime. In 1895 he won an honorable mention at the National Exhibition and later won third place in 1899 and 1904. In 1914 he relocated to Madrid, where he made contact with the intellectual and artistic environment of the time together with his brother Enrique.

When the war broke out in 1914 Julio Romero fought for the allies as a pilot. After the war in 1916 he became a professor of Clothing Design in the School of Fine Arts in Madrid.
