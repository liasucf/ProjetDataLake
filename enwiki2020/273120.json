    "text": "The Citro\u00ebn Berlingo and Peugeot Partner are almost identical panel vans and leisure activity vehicles produced by PSA Peugeot Citro\u00ebn since 1996. The third generation is also sold as the Opel/Vauxhall Combo, and as the Toyota ProAce City from 2019. The panel vans are available in passenger versions named the Berlingo Multispace and Partner Combi, Partner Tepee, and Peugeot Rifter for the third generation. In Italy, the first generation of the Partner was known as the Peugeot Ranch. They were initially based on the Citro\u00ebn ZX/Peugeot 306 estate floorpan and mechanicals. With their rectangular, box like cargo space and aerodynamic front, conceptually they can be considered the descendants of the Citro\u00ebn 2CV panel van (AK400). The new 2018 Citro\u00ebn Berlingo and Peugeot Partner/Rifter also share their design with the new Vauxhall/Opel Combo, following GM's stake acquisition in PSA. Both the Berlingo and Partner have been produced in CNG and electric versions and with four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. __TOC__ == Berlingo / Partner I (1996\u20132013) M49 (1996-2003) == The Berlingo/Partner was officially launched in July 1996. When the Berlingo was first shown at the Mondial de l'Automobile (Paris Motor Show) in 1996, a set of three concept cars was also presented: *Berlingo Coup\u00e9 de Plage *Berlingo Berline Bulle *Berlingo Grand Large The Berline Bulle concept was a roomy small car, that could be considered as a precursor for the C3. Only one of these concepts was actually developed, the Grand Large version, which was developed into the Multispace and Combi people carriers/leisure vans.

The smaller, known as the Citro\u00ebn Nemo, was developed in cooperation with Fiat and Tofa\u015f. Based on the Fiat Grande Punto platform, it is built in Turkey and is also marketed as the Peugeot Bipper and Fiat Fiorino. The Peugeot and Citro\u00ebn are almost identical; the Fiorino also has a different, Fiat made, diesel engine. The Nemo is intended to be cheaper and smaller than the original Berlingo. The Berlingo II, styled by Gilles Vidal, is based on PSA's Platform 2 (like the Citro\u00ebn C4) and therefore is slightly larger, and considerably more expensive than its predecessor. The engine range is similar to other current models of the PSA Group. The Berlingo and Partner were officially unveiled in January 2008, with the Berlingo launched first, in the European market, in April 2008, followed by the Partner in May 2008. Mexico still sells this generation alongside the original Partner, as do a few other countries, as the Grand Raid and Partner Origin. An electric version has been available since 2013. In March 2017, a five seater Citroen E-Berlingo Multispace was announced. === Engines === {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=7|Petrol engine |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque !Note !CO2 emission (g/km) |- style=\"background:#fff;\" |1.6i 16V||I4||1587 cc|| @5800 rpm|| @2500 rpm||||195 |- !colspan=7|Diesel engine |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque !Note !CO2 emission (g/km) |- style=\"background:#fff;\" |1.6HDi 16V||I4|| 1560 cc|| @4000 rpm|| @1750 rpm||||149 |- style=\"background:#fff;\" |1.6HDi 16V||I4|| 1560 cc|| @4000 rpm|| @1750 rpm||||149 |- style=\"background:#fff;\" |1.6HDi 16V||I4|| 1560 cc|| @4000 rpm|| @1750 rpm||||140 |- |1.6 BlueHDi 8V |l4 |1560 cc |75 PS (55 kW; 74 hp) | |BVM5 |113 |- |1.6 BlueHDi 8V |l4 |1560 cc | | |BVM5 |113 |- |1.6 BlueHDi 8V |l4 |1560 cc | | |BVM6 |113 |- !colspan=7|Electric engine |- style=\"background:#dcdcdc; text-align:center; vertical-align:middle;\" !Model !Engine !Displacement !Power !Torque !Note !CO2 emission (g/km) |- style=\"background:#fff;\" | Berlingo Electric || || || || ||||0 |} == Berlingo III / Rifter / Combo E/ ProAce City (2018\u2013present) == The third generation Berlingo and a new Peugeot Rifter was officially unveiled at the 2018 Geneva Auto Show.
