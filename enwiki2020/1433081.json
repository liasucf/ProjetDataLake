    "text": "The Faculty of Agriculture at Dalhousie University is a Canadian agricultural college and faculty of Dalhousie University located in Bible Hill, Nova Scotia. The Faculty of Agriculture offers the only university level programs in agriculture in Atlantic Canada. Founded 14 February 1905 as the Nova Scotia Agricultural College within the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture, it merged with Dalhousie University on 1 September 2012. The campus is referred to as Dalhousie University's \"Agricultural Campus\" or by its popular nickname of \"Dal AC\" or simply the \"AC.\" ==History== The Faculty of Agriculture was officially founded on 1 September 2012 with the merger of the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC) into Dalhousie University.N.S. Agricultural College to merge with DalhousieDal name hailed in Bible Hill The Faculty of Agriculture traces its history to The School of Agriculture, founded in 1885 and located in Truro, as well as The School of Horticulture, founded in 1893 and located in Wolfville. These two institutions merged on 14 February 1905 to form the Nova Scotia Agricultural College (NSAC) and the new institution, managed by the Government of Nova Scotia's Department of Agriculture, relocated to the provincial demonstration farm in Bible Hill. The Bible Hill campus, located on a bluff along the north bank of the Salmon River, expanded throughout the 20th century to a total area of . In the early years, the NSAC and its predecessor institutions focused on educating farmers in aspects of field and animal husbandry. These early graduates often went on to pursue a university degree, usually from Macdonald College at McGill University or the Ontario Agricultural College in Guelph, Ontario. A disastrous fire in 1946 destroyed the science building and a temporary campus was set up at a former Canadian Army hospital at nearby Camp Debert. This temporary campus served students until the fall of 1953 when the new science building, now known as the Harlow Institute, was opened on the Bible Hill campus. In 1980 the Government of Nova Scotia passed legislation authorizing the institution to grant undergraduate B.Sc. (Agr.) degrees.Chapter 6 of the Revised Statutes, 1989, \"Agriculture and Marketing Act\", Part XVI Agricultural Education. The decision was made by the institution to do this in association with Dalhousie University and the first students graduated with the new degree in 1985. An agreement was subsequently made with Dalhousie to provide M.Sc. degrees beginning in 1996. NSAC granted its own diplomas for 2-year technology programs and the institution remained an independent post-secondary research and education institution administered by the Nova Scotia Department of Agriculture. To commemorate the 100th anniversary of the NSAC, Canada Post issued 'Nova Scotia Agricultural College, 1905-2005' on 14 February 2005 as part of the Canadian Universities series. The stamp was based on a design by Denis L'Allier and a photograph by Guy Lavigueur. The 50\u00a2 stamps are kiss cut and were printed by Lowe-Martin Company Inc.
