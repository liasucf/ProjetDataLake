    "text": "Robert Edris Davies (January 15, 1920 \u2013 April 22, 1990) was an American professional basketball player. Alongside Bobby Wanzer he formed one of the best backcourt duos in the National Basketball Association's early years. Davies and Wanzer led the Rochester Royals to the 1951 NBA championship. Davies was also a former basketball coach at the Seton Hall University and was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame on April 11, 1970. Although Bob Cousy is often considered the originator of the behind-the-back dribble, Davies actually deserves the credit. His Seton Hall coach, John \"Honey\" Russell, once said, \"He had such uncanny control of the ball behind his back that it never concerned me. He made it look as easy as the conventional dribble.\" ==College career and military service== Davies entered Seton Hall in 1938 on a baseball scholarship, but Russell persuaded him to concentrate on basketball after seeing him practice once. Never a high scorer\u2014his best college average was 11.8 points a game\u2014Davies was a consummate passer and play-maker..\" Known as the \"Harrisburg Houdini\", Davies led Seton Hall to 43 consecutive victories from 1939 into 1941. His spectacular skills helped attract the largest crowd in basketball history at the time, 18,403 people, to Madison Square Garden in March 1941, when Seton Hall beat Rhode Island in a quarter-final game of the National Invitation Tournament. An All- American guard in 1941 and 1942, Davies joined the U. S. Navy during World War II and led the Great Lakes Naval Training Station team to a 34-3 record before going overseas. ===College statistics=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:right;\" |- !
