Incumbent Premier David Makhura led the ruling African National Congress (ANC), with the party attempting to retain its majority status and secure Makhura a second full term in office as premier. The media and political analysts widely expected that the ANC would lose its majority in the Gauteng Provincial Legislature, therefore it was considered to be the most hotly-contested province in this election cycle. The Official Opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) nominated Mayor of Tshwane Solly Msimanga to be its premier candidate. Msimanga was elected Tshwane Mayor in the aftermath of the 2016 South African municipal elections as the ANC had lost its majority in the Tshwane City Council. The DA did also manage to gain control of the City of Johannesburg and Mogale City.Maimane announces Msimanga as Gauteng Premier candidate, SABC News, 19 August 2018.
