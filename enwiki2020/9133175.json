The first baron served in the Scottish wars. On 22 July 1298, he served in the battle of Falkirk and was knighted and borne his coat of arms afterwards. Ap- Adam married Elizabeth de Gurnay, the daughter of John de Gurnay Baron of Beverstone, and Olivia Lovel. They had at least one son, Sir Thomas Ap-Adam, who left children. This Thomas was never summoned to parliament; thus the barony became dormant. ==References== * Burke, Sir Bernard. \"Ap-Adam, Barons de Ap-Adam.\" A Genealogical History of the Dormant, Abeyant, Forfeited, and Extinct Peerages, of the British Empire.
