    "text": "A network operating system (NOS) is a specialized operating system for a network device such as a router, switch or firewall. Historically operating systems with networking capabilities were described as network operating system, because they allowed personal computers (PCs) to participate in computer networks and shared file and printer access within a local area network (LAN). This description of operating systems is now largely historical, as common operating systems include a network stack to support a client\u2013server model. ==History== Early microcomputer operating systems such as CP/M, DOS and classic Mac OS were designed for one user on one computer. Packet switching networks were developed to share hardware resources, such as a mainframe computer, a printer or a large and expensive hard disk. As local area network technology became available, two general approaches to handle sharing of resources on networks arose. Historically a network operating system was an operating system for a computer which implemented network capabilities. Operating systems with a network stack allowed personal computers to participate in a client-server architecture in which a server enables multiple clients to share resources, such as printers.Dean, Tamara (2009). \"Network Operating Systems\", Network+ Guide to Networks, 421(483)Davis, Ziff (2011). \"network operating system\", PCmag.comRetrieved 5/7/2011. Early examples of client-server operating systems that were shipped with fully integrated network capabilities are Novell NetWare using the Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX) network protocol, Windows Server 2003, and Banyan VINES which used a variant of the Xerox Network Systems (XNS) protocols. Peer-to-peer network operating systems were also developed, which used networking capabilities to share resources and files located on personal computers. This system is not based with having a file server or centralized management source. A peer-to-peer network sets all connected computers equal; they all share the same abilities to use resources available on the network.Winkelman, Dr. Roy (2009). \"Chapter 6: Software\", An Educator's Guide to School Networks, 6. Examples of early peer-to-peer operating systems with networking capabilities include AppleShare used for networking connecting Apple products, LANtastic supporting DOS, Microsoft Windows and OS/2 computers, as well as Windows for Workgroups used for networking peer-to-peer Windows computers. Today, distributed computing and groupware applications have become the norm. Computer operating systems include a networking stack as a matter of course. During the 1980s the need to integrate dissimilar computers with network capabilities grew and the number of networked devices grew rapidly. Partly because it allowed for multi-vendor interoperability the TCP/IP protocol suite became almost universally adopted in network architectures. Therefore, computer operating systems and the firmware of network devices needed to reliably support the TCP/IP protocols. ==Network device operating systems== Network operating systems can be embedded in a router or hardware firewall that operates the functions in the network layer (layer 3).Al-Shawakfa, Emad; Evens, Martha (2001). \"The Dialoguer: An Interactive Bilingual Interface to a Network Operating System.\", Expert Systems Vol. 18 Issue 3, p131, 19p, Retrieved 5/7/2011. Notable network operating systems include: ===Proprietary network operating systems=== * Cisco IOS, a family of network operating systems used on most Cisco Systems routers and current Cisco network switches. Earlier switches ran the Catalyst Operating System CatOS * RouterOS by MikroTik. *ZyNOS, used in network devices made by ZyXEL. === NetBSD, FreeBSD, or Linux based operating systems=== *DD- WRT, Linux kernel based DD-WRT is Linux-based firmware for wireless routers and access points as well as low-cost networking device platforms such as the Linksys WRT54G *Dell Networking Operating System, DNOS9 is NetBSD based, while OS10 uses the Linux kernel. *Extensible Operating System runs on switches from Arista and uses an unmodified Linux kernel *ExtremeXOS (EXOS), used in network devices made by Extreme Networks *FTOS or Force10 Operating System, is the firmware family used on Force10 Ethernet switches *OpenWrt used to route IP packets on embedded devices *pfSense, a fork of M0n0wall, uses PF *Cumulus Linux distribution, which uses the full TCP/IP stack of Linux. *VyOS, an open source fork of the Vyatta routing package *ONOS: An open source SDN operating system (hosted by The Linux Foundation) for communications service providers that is designed for scalability, high performance and high availability. *Exaware, a commercial Network Operating System, especially suited for large Carrier networks, feature-rich and scalable. ==See also== *Distributed operating system *FRRouting *Network Computer Operating System *Network functions virtualization *Operating System Projects * Interruptible operating system ==References== ==External links== *PCmag's definition of network operating system *Chapter 6 of Dr. Roy Winkelman's guide to networks Category:Operating systems Category:Internet Protocol based network software ",
