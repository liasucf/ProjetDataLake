    "text": "Wei Commandery () was a historical commandery of China, located in modern southern Hebei and northern Henan. The commandery was created during Emperor Gaozu of Han's reign, with its seat at Ye. In late Western Han, it administered 18 counties, namely Ye (\u9134), Guantao (\u9928\u9676), Chiqiu (\u65a5\u4e18), Sha (\u6c99), Neihuang (\u5167\u9ec3), Qingyuan (\u6e05\u6df5), Wei (\u9b4f), Fanyang (\u7e41\u967d), Yuancheng (\u5143\u57ce), Liangqi (\u6881\u671f), Liyang (\u9ece\u967d), Jipei (\u5373\u88f4), Wushi (\u6b66\u59cb), Hanhui (\u90af\u6703), Yin'an (\u9670\u5b89), Ping'en (\u5e73\u6069), Hangou (\u90af\u6e9d) and Wu'an (\u6b66\u5b89). The population was 909,655, or 212,849 households in 2 AD.Book of Han, Chapter 28. By 140 AD, four counties (Jipei, Wushi, Hanhui, Hangou) had been resolved, whereas a new county, Quliang (\u66f2\u6881), was added. The population was 695,606, or 129,310 households.Book of Later Han, Chapter 110. In late Eastern Han dynasty, Wei Commandery became the center of the Wei Kingdom, fief of Cao Cao, who expanded the commandery, increasing the total number of counties to 29. New official posts, Colonel of the East (\u6771\u90e8\u90fd\u5c09) and Colonel of the West (\u897f\u90e8\u90fd\u5c09) were created to assist in administering the territory.Records of the Three Kingdoms, Chapter 1. After the establishment of the Cao Wei dynasty, these areas became new commanderies Yangping (\u967d\u5e73) and Guangping (\u5ee3\u5e73), respectively. At the unification of Jin dynasty in 280 AD, the commandery had 8 counties, and a population of 40,700 households.Book of Jin, Chapter 14. Under the Eastern Wei which moved the capital to Ye, Wei Commandery was briefly renamed Wei Yin (\u9b4f\u5c39), similar to how Jingzhao was named during the Han dynasty. 13 counties were recorded in the Book of Wei, namely Ye (\u9134), Linzhang (\u81e8\u6f33), Fanyang (\u7e41\u967d), Lieren (\u5217\u4eba), Changle (\u660c\u6a02), Wu'an (\u6b66\u5b89), Linshui (\u81e8\u6c34), Wei (\u9b4f), Pingyi (\u5e73\u9091), Yiyang (\u6613\u967d), Yuancheng (\u5143\u57ce), Chizhang (\u65a5\u7ae0) and Guixiang (\u8cb4\u9109), with a total population of 438,024, or 122,613 households.Book of Wei, Chapter 106. The commandery was abolished in early Sui dynasty. In Sui and Tang dynasties, Wei Commandery became an alternative name of Xiang Prefecture (\u76f8\u5dde, centered around modern-day Anyang) until 742. Afterwards, the name was applied to Wei Prefecture (\u9b4f\u5dde) to the north of Xiang.New Book of Tang, Chapter 39. ==References== Category:Commanderies of the Han dynasty Category:Commanderies of the Jin dynasty (265\u2013420) Category:Commanderies of the Northern dynasties ",
