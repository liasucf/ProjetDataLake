    "text": "The Huggins Equation is an empirical equation used to relate the reduced viscosity of a dilute polymer solution to the concentration of the polymer in solution. It is named after Maurice L. Huggins. The Huggins equation states: \\left [\\frac{n_s}{c}\\right]\\quad= [n] + k_H [n]^2 c Where {n_s} is the specific viscosity of a solution at a given concentration of a polymer in solution, [n] is the intrinsic viscosity of the solution, k_H is the Huggins coefficient, and c is the concentration of the polymer in solution. In isolation, n_s is the specific viscosity of a solution at a given concentration. The Huggins equation is valid when [n]c is much smaller than 1, indicating that it is a dilute solution. The Huggins coefficient used in this equation is an indicator of the strength of a solvent. The coefficient typically ranges from about 0.3 (for strong solvents) to 0.5 (for poor solvents). The Huggins equation is a useful tool because it can be used to determine the intrinsic viscosity, [n], from experimental data by plotting [\\frac{n_s}{c}]versus the concentration of the solution, c. ==See also== * Viscosity * Rheology ==References== == References == Category:Polymers Category:Viscosity ",
