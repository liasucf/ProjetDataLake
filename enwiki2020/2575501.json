    "text": "Taxidermy is the debut album of English alternative rock band Queenadreena, released in 2000. The enhanced-CD release includes a short film by Martina Hoogland-Ivanow involving time-lapse photography and dream-like visuals. ==Release== Taxidermy was released in the United Kingdom on compact disc which features a short film by Martina Hoogland-Ivanow, and as a 12\" vinyl LP. ==Critical reception== NME wrote of the album: \"while carrying on Daisy Chainsaw's predilection for rock as infantile nightmare, here the scope is much wider than a one-track take on banshee pop. There are some obvious precedents, notably Bj\u00f6rk and PJ Harvey, but much more than either of those two reference points, this debut album is frequently akin to eavesdropping on psychotherapy.\" ==Track listing== ==Singles== *\"X-ing Off the Days\" (1999) *\"Cold Fish\" (1999) *\"Jolene\" (2000) *\"I Adore You\" (2000) ==Personnel== Queenadreena *KatieJane Garsidevocals, arrangement *Crispin Grayguitar, glockenspiel, harmonica, backing vocals, arrangement *Orson Wajihbass *Steve Drewdrums Technical personnel *Ken Thomasproduction *Queenadreenaproduction ==References== ==External links== * *Cover art and liner notes at the Internet Archive Category:2000 albums Category:Queenadreena albums Category:Warner Records albums ",
