The group consisted of Harry Mondryk, Max Mondryk, and Matthew Fitzgerald. ==History== ===2010\u20132014: Britain's Got Talent and split=== In 2010, Connected finished in eighth place for the fourth series of Britain's Got Talent. The group performed on the Britain's Got Talent Live Tour, across arenas all over the UK, covering songs such as \"Never Forget\" by Take That, \"Everybody in Love\" by JLS, and \"Don't Stop Me Now\" by Queen. Their last gig was on 18 July, at the Midlands Music Festival in Tamworth, which had an attendance figure of over 20,000. On 30 July, Connected announced on Facebook that it had split with the Ryan twins, and was forming a new band. The Ryans were very disappointed and upset about the surprise notification. Connor Ryan commented in an interview with Manchester Evening News that \"We were there the day before and they were our best friends. Nothing was wrong, we didn't fall out and it was just very confusing.... We found out on the internet, like most of the other fans. It was horrible.\" The Ryans went on to form Myles and Connor; the remaining three members signed with Cent Management and Freedom Management, the latter of which was from Connected's promoter, Kevin Newton. The new group was named ReConnected. Songwriter-producer Tim Woodcock has agreed to work on developing songs and music for the group. ReConnected recorded six tracks which were first sung live in May 2011. These are called: \"ReConnected\", \"Superhuman\", \"Seeing Stars\", \"December\", \"Wish You Were Here\" and \"Stranded\". The group also released short acoustic versions of these songs, and held a launch show on 26 May at Sound Control in Manchester, United Kingdom (UK). The next launch show took place on 2 June due to the first launch selling out and very high demand, and was filmed for a documentary and music video. Further launch shows include venues in Nottingham, Newcastle upon Tyne, Birmingham, Bristol and Bournemouth. The group broadcast The ReConnected Radio Show weekly on UK Undiscovered, an Internet radio station. The premiere featured the band going ghost hunting. On 19 September, the band announced it had signed to RKA Records, a label which was founded by Ryan Ashmore and his friend Liam Webb. The label is part owned by Duncan Bannatyne after RKA Records appeared on the BBC's Dragon's Den. ReConnected worked on a single, \"One in a Million\", and completed a demo. The single debuted on 13 February 2012 at Manchester Academy. While some of its members were attending high school, ReConnected continued to keep in touch with fans using social media. On 17 November 2012, they performed at the Preston Christmas Lights Switch-On, along with many more in the north. On 6 January 2013, ReConnected announced that it is a supporting act for Little Mix on a 22-city tour starting 22 January. The group released \"One in A Million\" music video which features Duncan Bannatyne in a bit part. The single was released on 17 March, and has the Radio Edit and Harry's Dub Remix. An EP of the single featured two additional remix tracks: Hardino Remix and Steve C Remix. It debuted at number 32 on the UK Singles Chart. Duncan Bannatyne said that he was \"over the moon by the midweek result\". The group is recording its debut album with writer and producer Tim Woodcock. In July, ReConnected travelled to Ibiza to film the music video for their second single, \"Time of Our Lives\", The video was released on 12 September, and the single on 20 October. It reached number 33 on the UK Charts, and number 3 on the UK Indie Single Chart. On 31 January 2014, ReConnected posted a video message confirming the rumours that they have split up and are pursuing solo careers. ==Personnel== Harry Mondryk and Max Mondryk are from Whitefield.
