Late 2016 plans to relocate the building were abandoned because it was deemed structurally unsound. Club 21, which opened in the late 1960s, closed on January 15, 2017. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1960s establishments in Oregon Category:2017 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Defunct drinking establishments in Oregon Category:Kerns, Portland, Oregon Category:Northeast Portland, Oregon ",
