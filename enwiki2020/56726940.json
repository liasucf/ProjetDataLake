    "text": "Teresa Victoria Fort\u00edn Franco (November 17, 1885 \u2013 January 19, 1982) was a Honduran painter. Born in Yuscar\u00e1n, into a middle class family, Fort\u00edn was descended from a family of Creole miners of French origin. She evinced artistic talent from a young age, but was unable to pursue a career in the arts due to her gender. Instead she traveled to Tegucigalpa, where she studied at the School for Young Ladies run by Concha Maldonado. During the 1920s she worked as a teacher at the primary school in Valle de \u00c1ngeles. A serious illness in 1930 forced her retirement, and she took up drawing and oil painting as a hobby. She exhibited work at the National Library of Honduras in 1933, under the auspices of the Secretariat of Education, receiving as a result private lessons with Maximiliano Ram\u00edrez Euceda. When Alejandro del Vecchio was hired by Archbishop Agust\u00edn Hombach to restore the decorative scheme of Tegucigalpa Cathedral she was hired as his assistant, developing as a result an interest in religious painting. She also took an interest in the work of Pablo Zelaya Sierra. Fort\u00edn was hired by Carlos Z\u00fa\u00f1iga Figueroa to teach at his art academy at its foundation in 1932. During her career she worked with the Carnegie Foundation, assisting in its excavation and restoration of the archaeological site at Cop\u00e1n in 1938. She continued to show work both in solo exhibitions and in group shows. In 1976 she presented a cycle of autobiographical paintings depicting various moments in her life. She received the Pablo Zelaya Sierra Prize for her work in 1980. Fort\u00edn died in Tegucigalpa. ==References== Category:1885 births Category:1982 deaths Category:Honduran painters Category:Honduran women painters Category:20th- century women artists Category:20th-century painters Category:People from El Para\u00edso Department Category:Honduran people of French descent ",
