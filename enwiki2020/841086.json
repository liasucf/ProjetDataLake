Gargallo developed a style of sculpture based on the creation of three-dimensional objects from pieces of flat metal plate, and he also used paper or cardboard. Some of these sculptures have a form of cubism. For example, only one half of a face may be shown, and it may have only one eye. He also made more traditional sculptures in bronze, marble and other materials. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the town of ralls Aragonese avant-garde.

In 1903, he invested a studio at the Cit\u00e9 d'Artistes, rue Vercing\u00e9torix in the 14th arrondissement of Paris. There he met Max Jacob and Carlos Casagemas, both friends of Pablo Picasso.Jean Anguera, Pablo Gargallo, sculptures et dessins, exhibition catalogue, la Monnaie de Paris, April\u2013June 2001, p. 55 In 1907, he stayed at the artists commune Le Bateau-Lavoir in MontmartreRafa\u00ebl Ordo\u00f1ez Fern\u00e1ndez, Pablo Gargallo, La tradici\u00f3n de la vanguardia, Museo Pablo Gargallo, 2004, Ed. Ayuntamiento de Zaragoza, p. 48 with Max Jacob, Juan Gris and other artists. He spent his first night in the studio of his friend Picasso, whose head he modeled as a sculpture. There he was able to contemplate Picasso's seminal proto-Cubist painting Les Demoiselles d'Avignon. Shortly thereafter, Juan Gris introduced him to Magali Tartanson, whom he married in 1915. During this period, Gargallo was influenced by the work of Picasso. Among Gargallo's works are three pieces based on Greta Garbo: \"Masque de Greta Garbo \u00e0 la m\u00e8che,\" \"T\u00eate de Greta Garbo avec chapeau,\" and \"Masque de Greta Garbo aux cils.\" Together with D\u00eddac Masana, Gargallo sculpted the great arch over the front of the stage of the Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana in Barcelona. The work depicts the Ride of the Valkyries in Richard Wagner's opera Die Walk\u00fcre (The Valkyries). Gargallo suffered from fulminating bronchial pneumonia and died in Reus, Tarragona. He is considered to be one of the most significant artists of the Spanish avant-garde, and in 1985 the Pablo Gargallo Museum in Zaragoza opened in the former Argillo Palace. Gargallo's birthplace and early home, on the street now dedicated to his name in Maella, Zaragosa, has been transformed into a museum dedicated to his life and works. == Gallery == File:Pablo Gargallo, 1913, Masque de Picasso (Portrait of Picasso), sculpture, from Maurice Raynal, 1921.jpg|Pablo Gargallo, 1913, Masque de Picasso (Portrait of Picasso), sculpture, from Maurice Raynal, 1921 File:Pablo Gargallo, \"Masque d'Arlequin souriant\" \u00a9 Marc Vaux, Archives P.
