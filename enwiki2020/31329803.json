    "text": "Abel Makkonen Tesfaye (born February 16, 1990), known professionally as the Weeknd, is a Canadian singer, songwriter, actor, and record producer. He began his recording career in 2010, anonymously uploading several songs to YouTube. A year later, the Weeknd released the mixtapes House of Balloons, Thursday, and Echoes of Silence, and quickly earned a following and critical recognition from several mainstream publications due to his dark style of R&B; and the mystique surrounding his identity. In 2012, the Weeknd signed with Republic Records, and re-released the mixtapes as part of the compilation album Trilogy (2012). His debut studio album, Kiss Land, was released in 2013. He followed the album with Beauty Behind the Madness (2015), which was among the best- selling albums of 2015. Containing the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles \"Can't Feel My Face\" and \"The Hills\", Beauty Behind the Madness won Best Urban Contemporary Album and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2016 Grammy Awards. The Weeknd's third album Starboy (2016) was a similar commercial success and included the number-one single of the same name, while it also won Best Urban Contemporary Album at the 2018 Grammy Awards. His fourth album, After Hours (2020), featured the number-one singles \"Heartless\" and \"Blinding Lights\". The Weeknd has won three Grammy Awards, two American Music Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, nine Juno Awards, and has been nominated for an Academy Award. He holds several chart records, being the first artist to simultaneously hold the top three positions on the Billboard Hot R&B; Songs chart with \"Can't Feel My Face\", \"Earned It\", and \"The Hills\". The Weeknd was awarded the Allan Slaight Award by Canada's Walk of Fame for \"making a positive impact in the fields of music, film, literature, visual or performing arts, sports, innovation or philanthropy\". He is one of the most successful Canadian recording artists of all time, with more than 75 million records sold globally. ==Early life== Abel Makkonen Tesfaye was born on February 16, 1990 in Toronto, Ontario, and was raised in Scarborough. He is the only child of Makkonen and Samra Tesfaye, who were Ethiopian immigrants to Canada in the late 1980s. Tesfaye was raised by his grandmother and mother after his parents split up. While living with his grandmother Tesfaye learned Amharic, which he also spoke with his mother, and attended Ethiopian Orthodox church services. When asked about his father in an interview, Tesfaye stated: \"I saw him vaguely when I was six, and then again when I was 11 or 12, and he had a new family and kids. I don't even know where he lived \u2014 I'd see him for, like, a night. I'm sure he's a great guy. I never judged him. He wasn't abusive, he wasn't an alcoholic, he wasn't an asshole. He just wasn't there.\" Tesfaye describes his teenage years as the film \"Kids without the AIDS\". Tesfaye states he began smoking marijuana at age 11, and later moved on to harder drugs. Tesfaye claims he often shoplifted to supplement his use of ecstasy, oxycodone, Xanax, cocaine, psilocybin, and ketamine. Tesfaye attended West Hill Collegiate Institute and Birchmount Park Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, from which he did not graduate, leaving altogether in 2007, after which he also left home. Tesfaye moved to the Parkdale neighbourhood of Toronto. Tesfaye has credited his stage name as being inspired by his high school dropout status, claiming \"after [he] left one weekend and never came home\", though producer Jeremy Rose claims the name was his idea. The spelling was modified in order to avoid trademark problems with the Canadian band the Weekend. ==Career== ===2010\u20132011: Career beginnings=== Tesfaye met Jeremy Rose in 2010, a producer who had an idea for a dark R&B; musical project. After initially trying to pitch the idea to musician Curtis Santiago, Rose played one of his instrumentals for Tesfaye, who freestyle rapped over it. This led to the two collaborating on an album. Rose produced three songs \u2013 \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\", and \"The Morning\" \u2013 and others that Tesfaye had rapped on, which were ultimately scrapped. Rose let Tesfaye keep the tracks he had produced under the condition that he would ultimately be credited for them. In December 2010, Tesfaye uploaded \"What You Need\", \"Loft Music\" and \"The Morning\" to YouTube under his stage name, although his identity was initially unknown. The songs drew some attention online, and were later included in a blog post from Drake. The songs subsequently received coverage from various media outlets, including Pitchfork and The New York Times. Before adopting the stage name the Weeknd, he worked under the aliases of the Noise and Kin Kane. Tesfaye took to his Twitter to mention that his extended play, Noise, were \"a bunch of songs leaked by salty producers and found AFTER HOB dropped.\" He says that they were demos that he had written as a teenager to try and get recognition. The EP consists of 10 tracks, some of which influenced his debut mixtape, House of Balloons. On March 21, 2011, Tesfaye self-released his debut mixtape House of Balloons.\"25 best Canadian debut albums ever\". CBC Music, June 16, 2017. The mixtape included production from Canadian producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, and included the tracks produced by Rose, although, he did not receive production credits. House of Balloons was met with critical acclaim. It was named as one of ten shortlisted nominees for the 2011 Polaris Music Prize. Tesfaye began a tour of Toronto, with his first live performance at the city's Mod Club venue.

Over the summer of 2011, Tesfaye contributed to four songs on Drake's Take Care, both as a writer and a featured artist.

The tour culminated in New York with back-to-back sold-out shows, which were positively reviewed by Rolling Stone. Tesfaye expanded his tour to accompany Europe, performing at various European festivals, including the Primavera Sound Festivals in Spain and Portugal, and the Wireless Festival in London. Covering \"Dirty Diana\" at his performance in London, he received positive responses from both Katy Perry and Florence Welch, who noted the singer's ability to successfully undertake a complex song. In June, the Balloons Trilogy was revealed to have been downloaded over 8 million times, which allowed Tesfaye to initiate formal commercial release of the projects later that year. In September 2012, Tesfaye signed with Republic Records in a joint venture with his own imprint XO. The compilation album for the mixtapes entitled Trilogy, was released two months later, and consisted of several remastered versions of songs, as well as three additional ones.

The tour was held across the United States in September and October, and saw Schoolboy Q and Jhen\u00e9 Aiko as supporting acts. This oversaw his release of the songs \"Often\" and \"King of the Fall\", leading to speculation that the former was the first single from his second studio album. He later collaborated with Ariana Grande on a duet titled \"Love Me Harder\", which peaked at number seven on the Billboard Hot 100. Days later, he released \"Earned It\", a single from Fifty Shades of Grey (2015).

In the album's first charting week, Tesfaye became the first artist to lead the Billboard 200, Billboard Hot 100, Billboard Artist 100, Hot 100 Songwriters and Hot 100 Producers charts simultaneously. After Hours had a second consecutive week at number one on the Hot 100 Songwriters chart (April 2020), due to five entries on the latest Billboard Hot 100 (singles), all of which he co-wrote and co-produced. In April 2020, Tesfaye announced he would be co-writing and starring in an upcoming episode of American Dad!, which later premiered on May 4, 2020. ==Musical style== Tesfaye cites Michael Jackson, Prince, and R. Kelly as his main musical inspirations. He has attributed Jackson's music as key in spurring him to be a singer, referencing the lyrics to \"Dirty Diana\" as an example. He also said his high-flying vocal style was influenced by habesha singers like Aster Aweke. He grew up listening to a variety of music genres, including soul, hip hop, funk, indie rock, and post-punk. Tesfaye has said: \"I've always had an admiration for the era before I was born. You can hear it as far back as my first mixtape that the '80s -- Siouxsie and the Banshees, Cocteau Twins -- play such a huge role in my sound.\" Tesfaye's songs are \"built around a fogged, crepuscular production\", and feature slow tempos, rumbling bass, and forlorn echoes. Tesfaye often sings in a falsetto register, exhibiting an enticing tone. J. D. Considine finds his singing's \"tremulous quality\" similar to Michael Jackson, but writes that he eschews Jackson's \"strong basis in the blues\" for a more Arabic-influenced melisma. Tesfaye possesses a wide light-lyric tenor vocal range, which spans over three octaves. His vocal range reaches its extreme low at the bass F (F2), and its peak high at the tenor G\u266f (G\u266f5), with a natural tessitura within the upper fourth octave. Tesfaye often makes use of his head voice in order to build resonance to belt out strong high notes within the fifth octave. His music incorporates samples that are unconventional in R&B; production, including punk and alternative rock. Marc Hogan of Spin says that Tesfaye's samples tend \"to draw from rock critic-approved sources, though generally ones that already share elements of his sexual menace\", with samples of artists such as Beach House, Siouxsie and the Banshees and Aaliyah. Tesfaye worked mostly with producers Illangelo and Doc McKinney, whom Pitchforks Ian Cohen credits with developing \"a state-of-the-art R&B; template\" with the artist. In concert, Tesfaye reappropriates his digitized productions with a suite-like arena rock aesthetic. His emotional, plaintive lyrics often express feelings of hurt and deal with subject matter such as sex, drugs, and partying. Hermione Hoby of The Guardian characterizes Tesfaye's songs as \"narcotised-slow jams\" and delineates their message as \"partying is an existential experience, sex is fraught with alienation, and everything registers as unreal and unsettling\". The Guardians Paul MacInnes has stated that he views Tesfaye's three mixtapes as \"a rough trajectory of party, after-party and hangover\". Anupa Mistry of the Toronto Standard observes throughout his mixtapes a \"cast of supine, stoned zombie-women ... whose legs willingly part after being plied with substances and who morph into threats only when [he is] coming down and feeling vulnerable\". Tesfaye has viewed that, by singing vulgar, ignorant lyrics in an elegant, sexy way, he is paying homage to R. Kelly and Prince. Tesfaye has helped broaden R&B;'s musical palette to incorporate indie and electronic styles; his work has been categorized with the alternative R&B; tag.Billboard Staff. \"Grammys 2016 Preview: The Weeknd, D'Angelo and More Soulful Singers Nominated for Best R&B; Song and Best Urban Contemporary Album\". Billboard. February 13, 2016. Mistry writes that he \"will be obsequiously praised as the future of R&B; music\u2014because [he] is a black singer, not because he's making quantifiable, canonical R&B;\". AllMusic's Andy Kellman categorizes him as an \"alternative R&B; act\". While promoting his third album Starboy, Tesfaye also revealed Lana Del Rey, David Bowie, The Smiths, Bad Brains, Talking Heads, DeBarge, 50 Cent, the Wu-Tang Clan,Sources: * * and Eminem as influences.Sources: * * * ==Business ventures== During the American leg of his Fall tour promoting Kiss Land, Tesfaye collaborated with condom-producing company ONE to give away limited-edition condoms at his shows.

In November 2015, to further promote Beauty Behind the Madness, Tesfaye collaborated with Pax Labs to release a limited edition version of the PAX 2 vaporizer, an electronic cigarette that could be used in shows during The Madness Fall Tour. The e-cigarette featured the \"xo\" branding on the front, as well as having the ability to play \"The Hills\" when turned on. With the original PAX 2 priced at $279.99, the limited edition e-cigarette cost $324.99. PAX also acted as an official sponsor for the tour, presenting special backstage VIP activations for fans who bought packages that included the e-cigarette. PAX Labs chief marketing officer Richard Mumby stated \"Music and fashion have always been a natural fit for Pax...This was the perfect opportunity to bring together the Weeknd's style with our technology.\" In 2016, Tesfaye announced a partnership with Puma, as a Global Brand ambassador, for the company's \"Run the Streets\" campaign. It was launched in early November, with the final collection made available to coincide with the release of his album Starboy. He also hosted several pop-up retail stores for the \"Starboy: Limited Capsule\" collection, which were available across North America, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Toronto. With this partnership, Tesfaye also released three capsule collections named PUMA X XO including T-shirts, caps, sweatpants, bomber jackets and a pair of shoes called the Parallels. Tesfaye has also begun his own XO branded merchandise, which was furthered by a collaboration with H&M; to present its Spring 2017 campaign. The campaign would feature new collaborative pieces developed with the singer's brand, and was released on March 2, 2017. Tesfaye collaborated with H&M; again for a fall collection, however, after an incident which he described as \"deeply offensive\" in 2018, he cut ties with the company. In May 2017, Tesfaye had a limited edition pop up sale for the \"Starboy 2017 Limited Capsule Collection\". The collections were available in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami Beach, Houston, Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.

The couple were first seen together in May at Coachella and Hadid later starred in his music video \"In the Night\" in December of the same year. They made a red carpet appearance as a couple at the 2016 Grammy Awards.

Tesfaye reportedly started dating Selena Gomez in January 2017. They moved in together temporarily in September 2017, but broke up a month later in October 2017. By May 2018, Tesfaye and Hadid began dating again, before splitting in 2019. It has been reported that the two were in touch once more, nine months after the split. Tesfaye often used drugs to help get over writer's block on earlier albums and also abused illegal substances such as \"... Ketamine, cocaine, MDMA, mushrooms and cough syrup\". Speaking in December 2013, Tesfaye said that drugs were a \"crutch\" for him when it came to writing music. On social media he typically suffixed his first name with \"xo\". According to writer Hermione Hoby, it is meant as an emoticon for \"a kiss and a hug\", while VH1's Zara Golden's stated that it is a reference to his recreational use of ecstasy and oxycodone. He later altered the handles on his social media to reflect his stage name in preparation for the release of Starboy. Tesfaye's hairstyle has been claimed to be partly inspired by Jean- Michel Basquiat and has been described as his most recognizable trait. In an interview, he detailed that he began growing it out in 2011, and remarked at the easiness in maintaining it, with \"a hard shampoo every once in a while\". He eventually cut his hair in 2016 prior to the release of Starboy. In his leisure time, he enjoys watching television and is an avid video game fan. In May 2016, Tesfaye and Belly cancelled an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! due to Donald Trump being present. ===Legal issues=== In January 2015, Tesfaye was arrested for punching a Las Vegas police officer. Tesfaye pleaded no contest, and was sentenced to 50 hours of community service. In December 2015, Tesfaye was sued by Cutting Edge Music, who alleged that the bass line for \"The Hills\" had been taken from a composition featured in the score for The Machine. One of the producers of the song has alleged to have sent a DM to Tom Raybould, the composer of the film's score to tell him about the sample. In September 2018, Tesfaye and Daft Punk were sued for allegedly stealing the rhythm from a self-described poet, singer and songwriter named Yasminah. Tesfaye has denied these allegations. In April 2019, Tesfaye was sued by British trio William Smith, Brian Clover and Scott McCulloh who accused Tesfaye of plagiarizing their song \"I Need to Love\" in order to create his song \"A Lonely Night\". Smith, Clover, and McCulloh sought $150,000 from Tesfaye and Ahmed Balshe in lieu of copyright infringement. In November 2019, Tesfaye attempted to get the song-theft lawsuit dismissed which was denied by Judge Percy Anderson. ===Philanthropy=== After being presented with a Bikila Award for Professional Excellence in 2014, Tesfaye donated $50,000 to the University of Toronto to help them start a course on Ge'ez, the classic language of Ethiopia.

In April 2020, Tesfaye relaunched his record label XO's popular line of non-medical cloth face masks in an effort to raise money for MusiCares Coronavirus Relief Fund, which is a campaign launched by the Grammys to help musicians affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.
