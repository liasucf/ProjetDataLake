    "text": "Robert Muir (6 April 1907 \u2013 11 June 1973) was an Australian rules footballer who played with Collingwood, Footscray and Fitzroy in the Victorian Football League (VFL). Under Jock McHale, Collingwood won premierships in each of Muir's first three seasons at the club but he didn't participate in any of the finals campaigns. He missed the entire 1930 VFL season when Collingwood made it four in a row. He finally got regular game time in 1932 and made 17 appearances for the year, including two finals. It was however his last season with Collingwood and he finished his VFL career with stints at Footscray and Fitzroy. Muir continued playing football in the VFA, with Preston, which he coached in 1938 when Wyn Murray resigned during the season.The Argus, \"J.Meehan not granted his clearance\", 25 May 1938, p. 24 ==References== Category:1907 births Category:Collingwood Football Club players Category:Western Bulldogs players Category:Fitzroy Football Club players Category:Preston Football Club (VFA) players Category:Northern Blues coaches Category:Australian rules footballers from Victoria (Australia) Category:1973 deaths ",
