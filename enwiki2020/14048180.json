He was a pupil, and subsequently son-in-law, of Giulio Cesare Procaccini. By the early age of seventeen he painted three works in fresco for the cloister of the monastery of the Padri Zoccolanti at Milan. Several other works by this master were for the churches of that city. He was patronized by the duke of Savoy, and honored him with the title of Cavali\u00e8re, and a gold chain and medal. Bianchi was noted for his history paintings, portraits, landscapes, and paintings of animals. Among his works, are paintings for Sant'Alessandro in Milan, frescoes for Villa Litta Modignani in Biumo Inferiore in the town of Varese, and for the Palazzo Arese Borromeo of Cesano Maderno.Pacciarotti, page 241.
