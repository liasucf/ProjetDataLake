Owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, it is sister to NBC affiliate KRIS-TV (channel 6) and low-power independent station K22JA-D; Scripps also operates CBS affiliate KZTV (channel 10) through a shared services agreement (SSA) with owner SagamoreHill Broadcasting. The four stations share studios on Artesian Street in Downtown Corpus Christi; K47DF-D's transmitter is located in Robstown. The station is simulcast in high definition on KZTV's second digital subchannel to increase its broadcasting radius. On cable, K47DF-D is available on Charter Spectrum channel 16. From December 13, 2011 to May 2012, then-owner Cordillera Communications and the cable company (as Time Warner Cable at the time) were under a dispute regarding carriage fees, leaving TWC's Corpus Christi area customers without Telemundo.Attention Time Warner Cable and former CoBridge customers - KRIS-TV (accessed January 8, 2012) ==History== The station was founded on October 31, 1989 with programming from the Telemundo network. On September 26, 2010, it switched to Azteca Am\u00e9rica, and 4 days later, on September 30, it flipped back to Telemundo after a 5 day hiatus. K68DJ had applied to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for permission to move to UHF channel 43. As a low-power station, K68DJ was not required to broadcast digitally. On February 20, 2013, the FCC cancelled the station's license, citing operating on an out- of-core channel (52 to 69).http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi- bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=39098 As a result of this notice KAJA had ceased transmissions on K68DJ on January 2013 and went digital on a new channel as K22JA-D. In 2014, K22JA-D became the digital companion channel for K47DF as K47DF-D. KAJA can now be seen on K47DF-D 47.1 in 720p. ==Transmitters== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |+ KAJA ! RF Channel !!
