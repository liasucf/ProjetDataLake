    "text": "Acol is the bridge bidding system that, according to The Official Encyclopedia of Bridge, is \"standard in British tournament play and widely used in other parts of the world\". It is a natural system using four-card majors and, most commonly, a weak no trump. ==Origins== Acol is named after the Acol Bridge Club in London NW6, where it originated in the early 1930s.Acol Bridge Club Website. The club was founded on Acol Road, named after Acol, Kent.; According to Terence Reese, the system's main devisers were Maurice Harrison- Gray, Jack Marx and S. J. \"Skid\" Simon.Reese, Terence and Bird, David, Acol in the 90s, Robert Hale Limited (London), 1990, , page 7. Marx himself, writing in the Contract Bridge Journal in December, 1952, said: \"...the Acol system was pieced together by Skid Simon and myself the best part of 20 years ago.\" Page 54. In another account, Marx and Simon... The first book on the system was written by Ben Cohen and Terence Reese.Cohen, Ben and Reese, Terence, The Acol Two Club: with an introduction by S.J.Simon, Leng, Sheffield, 1938. This was the first Acol textbook, its authors wisely disclaiming originality: \"We do a job of reporting.\" It had a famous Preface, \"Attitude of Mind\" by Skid Simon. -- Second and subsequent editions titled The Acol System of contract bridge. Joiner & Steele, London. -- 2nd ed 1939; 3rd ed 1946, with 13 hands from the Waddington Par Contest; 4th ed 1949, with a selection of hands from the 1949 International Series; 5th ed [1956?], with a selection of hands from the 1955\u201356 international events and an Introduction by Guy Ramsey. The fourth edition introduced three new chapters on competitive bidding, mistakes to avoid, and two clubs over one no-trump (the Marx or Stayman convention). Skid Simon explained the principles that lay behind the system,Simon S.J., Design for bidding, Nicholson & Watson (London), 1949. and the system was further popularised in Britain by Iain Macleod.Macleod, Iain, Bridge is an easy game, Falcon (London), 1952. The Acol system is continually evolving but the underlying principle is to keep the bidding as natural as possible. It is common in the British Commonwealth but rarely played in North America. Ely Culbertson and his partner Teddy Lightner had visited the Acol Bridge Club in 1934, after which members S.J. Simon and Jack Marx became interested in bridge bidding theory. Simon and Marx soon afterwards began a discussion that eventually led to the first version of the Acol system. \"Bridge\", Sweden, publisher: \"Svensk Bridgelitteratur\", printed in Malm\u00f6 1960, p 179 (of 909; close to A4-size) including a black and white picture of Acol Road at p. 178, chapter on Acol written by Alvar Stenberg, editors Hasse Hermansson, Alvar Stenberg, Hans-Olof Halld\u00e9n and Einar Werner. No ISBN == Bidding system structure == As a bidding system, Acol has the following characteristics: * It is a natural system: most opening bids, responses and rebids are made with at least 4 cards in the suit bid, and most no trump bids are made with balanced hands. * It is a four-card major system: only four-card suits are required to open 1 or 1, unlike Standard American and many other systems where five-card suits are typically required. * It is an approach forcing system: as in most modern bidding systems, a new suit in response to a suit opening is forcing, unlike some older systems such as Vienna, which require responder to jump in order to force opener to bid again. * It makes extensive use of limit bids: limit bids describe the hand so closely, in terms of high card points (HCP) and shape, that the one who makes the limit bid is expected to pass on the next round, unless partner makes a forcing bid. * Understanding and correct use of limit bids and forcing bids is fundamental to applying the system: all no trump bids below the level of 4NT are limit bids, as are all suit bids that merely repeat a suit already bid by the partnership; changes of suit may be forcing or not depending on the approach bids. * The level of the 1NT opening bid influences other bids: the normal choice is between a \"weak no trump\" (12\u201314 HCP) and a \"strong no trump\" (15\u201317 HCP). In earlier forms of Acol, a \"variable no trump\" was common; 12\u201314 non-vulnerable and 16\u201318 vulnerable. * If using a weak no\u2013trump, this is the only \"fully natural\" bidding system which does not require a \"short club\" or \"prepared\" club/diamond bid with less than 4 cards. All 1 of a suit opening bids then promise at least 4 cards in the bid suit. == Variants == Acol is an unregulated system. There is no Acol governing body and no single publication containing the \"official\" Acol (unlike, for example, Standard American Yellow Card). It can be compared to a living language since it is liable to change at the whim of users. The main versions of Acol in use today are: * Acol: unregulated Acol, from the simple to the complex, remains in common use throughout the UK. At any one time the version in most common use will be known as \"Standard Acol\" although this term will mean different things to different players and is sometimes confused with Standard English Acol. * Standard English Acol (originally called simply \"Standard English\") or Bridge for All (BfA) Acol. Developed by the English Bridge Union in 1996, and designed to facilitate the learning of bridge and to provide standardised guidance to novices, intermediate players and their teachers. This variant uses the weak 1NT opening (12\u201314 points) and strong two opening bids. Simple conventions such as Stayman, Blackwood and Transfers are included at various stages in the learning process. It has been widely promulgated by the EBU and by EBUTA in particular, but the exact form is used mainly by those who have learned their bridge recently and those who taught them. * Modern Acol: a broad term for modern systems based on standard Acol but adding some additional conventions, particularly transfers and alternative ways of playing opening two-bids, as described below. Varies between partnerships, but typically includes two-suited overcalls, cue bids, checkback Stayman, Jacoby 2NT and Roman Key Card Blackwood. * Benjaminised (Benji) Acol: recognising that strong two opening bids occur rarely, the 2 and 2 openings are used as weak two bids to show weak hands containing long suits (under 10 HCP and a 6-card suit). Very strong hands (8 or more playing tricks, equivalent to an Acol Strong Two) are shown by an opening bid of 2 which forces a 2 response allowing suits to be shown. The strongest hands (e.g., 23 or more points or a game force hand, equivalent to the Acol 2 opening) are shown by an opening bid of 2. * Reverse Benji: identical to Benji except that the 2 and 2 bids are switched in meaning. A 2 opening bid is now the strongest bid, as in basic Acol. * Modern Acol with Three Weak Twos: uses the Standard American pattern where 2 is the only strong bid and 2, as well as 2 and 2, is a weak two bid. Proponents consider that a Benji 2 bid on 23+ or a game forcing hand is too infrequent (about 0.2% of hands) to use up a whole opening bid. A weak two in diamonds is much more common (1.2%). However, some definition is lost on strong hands aiming for slam. * Acol with Multi 2: this variant of Acol makes use of the Multi 2 diamonds convention, where 2 shows a variety of hands including weak two bids in hearts and spades. The 2 bid is used as in standard Acol (23+ points). Various uses are made of the 2 and 2 bids, with traditional strong twos or Lucas twos being some popular methods. == Standard Acol == The following is a brief summary of the Standard Acol of the early to mid-2000s. Standard Acol has not changed significantly since that time. === Opening bids === Opening bids promise at least 12 high card points (HCP), or the equivalent in HCP and shape, unless preempting. Apart from NT, opening bids guarantee the ability to make a rebid over any forcing response from partner. There are six special opening bids which are quite closely defined, and one wide-ranging opening bid: * Special opening bids: ** 1NT \u2014 Shows a balanced hand (4-3-3-3, 4-4-3-2 or 5-3-3-2). Subject to partnership agreement, it may be either weak (12\u201314 HCP), strong (15\u201317 or 16\u201318 HCP) or variable (i.e., varying between weak and strong according to vulnerability). Limit bid. The weak NT is by far the most common practice among UK club and social players. ** 2 \u2014 Conventional game-forcing bid, promising game-going values (normally 23+ HCP) and at least 5 quick tricks. Game forcing unless responder replies 2 and opener rebids 2NT. ** 2 of any other suit \u2014 Strong two bid which shows a strong hand with at least eight playing tricks and a 6-card suit (or two 5-card suits). Forcing for one round. ** 2NT \u2014 Shows a balanced hand with 20\u201322 HCP. Limit bid. ** 3 of a suit \u2014 Preemptive, normally seven or more cards in the suit bid (may be six at favourable vulnerability), weak hand (not more than 10 HCP). Not forcing. ** 3NT \u2014 Preemptive, shows a long solid minor suit and is called the Gambling 3NT * Wide-ranging opening bid (made if too strong to pass and unable to make one of the special opening bids): ** 1 of a suit \u2014 Promises a minimum of 12 HCP and a 4-card suit, 11 HCP and a 5-card suit, or 10 HCP and a 6-card suit. Not forcing. The wide-ranging 1 of a suit bid is the most common opening bid, accounting for about 75\u201380% of opening bids. The 1NT opening occurs on about 20% of biddable hands if \"weak\", or 10% if \"strong\". === Responses to 1 of a suit === * Pass \u2014 less than 6 HCP * 2 of opener's suit \u2014 at least four-card support and 6\u20139 HCP. Limit bid. * 3 of opener's suit \u2014 at least four-card support and 10\u201312 HCP. Invites game if opener has requisite strength (14 HCP or more). Limit bid. * 4 of opener's suit \u2014 at least five-card support for opener's major and 6\u201310 HCP, this is preemptive and to play. * 1NT \u2014 6\u20139 HCP, denies ability to bid at 2 level. Not necessarily balanced. Limit bid. * 2NT \u2014 balanced, 10\u201312 HCP. Limit bid. * 3NT \u2014 balanced, 13-15 HCP. Limit bid. * 1 of a new suit \u2014 promises at least four cards in the suit bid, 6 HCP upwards. Forcing for one round. * 2 of a new suit (below 2 of opener's suit) \u2014 normally 5-card suit, at least a good 8 or 9 HCP. Forcing for one round * Jump in a new suit \u2014 5-card suit (or support for partner), at least 16 HCP, Game force. Note 1: these last three bids may conceal 4-card support for opener's suit, whereas the three NT responses deny 4-card support for opener, and also normally deny holding a 4 card major biddable at the 1 level Note 2: when supporting opener's suit with an 8-card fit or better, HCP ranges can be adjusted downwards slightly to allow for shortages (singletons or voids) Note 3: with at least four-card support for opener's major and 13+ HCP, bid a new suit and then jump to 4 of opener's suit on the next round, a delayed game raise. Alternatively, by partnership agreement, the Jacoby 2NT or an alternative method may be used. === Responses to 1NT === The responses below assume a weak (12\u201314) NT opening: players should adjust the point ranges for responses if playing a different opening range. * 2 \u2014 Stayman. Opener responds 2 with no four-card major, 2 with a four-card heart suit and 2 with four spades (denies four hearts). Forcing for one round. * 2 of any other suit \u2014 weak takeout, opener must pass. Some players make use of transfers. * 3 of a suit \u2014 shows a strong hand with a five-card suit, forcing to game. * 2NT \u2014 11\u201312 HCP. invites game if opener is maximum (i.e., for a weak opening NT, if opener has 14 or a good 13 HCP). * 3NT \u2014 to play. * 4 \u2014 asks for aces. (Gerber) * 4, 4 \u2014 to play. * 4NT \u2014 slam invitation, opener bids 6NT with a maximum. * 5NT \u2014 slam invitation, opener bids 6NT unless a minimum. Note: some play as invitation to 7NT; opener bids 6NT if minimum, 7NT with a maximum). === Responses to 2NT === * 3 \u2014 Baron. Opener bids his lowest four-card suit. Forcing. (Stayman may also be used as in responses to 1NT; i.e., 3 shows no 4-card major). * 3 of other suit - shows a five card suit, forcing to game. Some players use transfers. * Other responses as over 1NT. === Responses to 2 === * 2 \u2014 negative. Responder lacks the strength for a positive response. Unless opener rebids 2NT (balanced, 23\u201324 HCP, which may be passed), the sequence is forcing to game. * 2NT \u2014 fairly balanced, 8 or more HCP. Some players take this as showing a minor. Forcing to game. * 2 of a suit \u2014 at least five in the suit, the equivalent of an ace and a king in high cards. Forcing to game. * 3 of a suit \u2014 Solid suit of at least six cards. Forcing to game. === Responses to 2 of a suit (strong two) === * 2NT \u2014 negative. Responder lacks the strength for a positive response. * Simple bid of a new suit \u2014 8 or more HCP (or an Ace and a King), at least five in the suit. Forcing to game. * 3 of opener's suit \u2014 5\u20138 HCP, at least 3-card support. Forcing to game. * 3NT \u2014 flat hand, 8\u201311 HCP. Not forcing. === Opener's suit rebid after one-level opening === Rebid own suit * Rebid of own suit at lowest level \u2013 minimum hand, at least a five-card suit, 12\u201315 HCP, non-forcing. * Jump rebid of own suit \u2013 strong hand, normally at least six-card suit, 15\u201319 HCP, non-forcing but highly invitational. ==== Bid new suit ==== * Bid of new suit at lower level than first suit \u2014 minimum hand, 12\u201315 HCP, first suit has at least as many cards as second suit, non-forcing. * Bid of new suit at higher level than two of the first suit, but without jumping (a Reverse bid) \u2014 strong hand, 16\u201319 HCP, first suit has more cards (at least five) than second suit, forcing for one round. * Jump in new suit \u2014 strong hand, about 19+ HCP over 1 level response or 16+ over 2 level response, first suit has at least as many cards as second suit, forcing to game. ==== Support for responder ==== * Simple raise of responder's suit \u2014 minimum hand, 4-card support, 12\u201315 HCP, non-forcing * Jump raise of responder's suit \u2014 stronger hand, 4-card support, 16\u201318 HCP, non-forcing * Jump to game in responder's suit \u2014 game values, 4-card support, 19+ HCP, non-forcing Note: when supporting responder's suit with an 8-card fit or better, HCP ranges can be adjusted downwards slightly to allow for shortages (singletons or voids) === Opener's NT rebid after one-level opening === The following bids assume a weak (12\u201314) NT opening. ==== After a suit response at one level ==== The traditional rebids are: * 1NT \u2014 balanced, 15\u201316 HCP, limit bid * 2NT \u2014 balanced, 17\u201318 HCP, limit bid * 3NT \u2014 balanced, 19 HCP, limit bid However, the modern approach modifies the ranges for the rebids thus: * 1NT \u2014 balanced, 15\u201317 HCP, limit bid * 2NT \u2014 balanced, 18\u201319 HCP, limit bid * 3NT \u2014 Often an Acol two type of hand prepared to play in NT. ==== After a suit response at two level ==== The traditional rebids are: * 2NT \u2014 balanced, 15\u201316 HCP, limit bid * 3NT \u2014 balanced, 17\u201319 HCP, limit bid The modern approach is to use the 2NT rebid as forcing to game with 15-19 points, allowing major suit fits to be found at the 3 level. 3NT may be used as 15\u201317 with support for the minor that responder has bid (one option). After the opener's 2NT rebid, 3 can be used as a (forcing) enquiry to seek definition of the 2NT rebid. The only non-forcing bid by responder after opener's 2NT rebid is a rebid of responder's suit. This means that bidding opener's first suit is unconditionally forcing. === Responder's second bid === By the time responder has to rebid, it is often clear what the best final contract should be, especially if either player has made a limit bid. If opener has bid two suits, responder can show preference between them. With a strong hand but uncertain whether a game contract is on or which game it should be, he can use fourth suit forcing to obtain further information. === Fourth suit forcing === A bid of the fourth suit at the 2 level by responder is a one-round force, usually asking opener to bid no trumps with a stopper in the fourth suit. A fourth suit bid at the 3 level is similar, but forcing to game. === Overcalls and doubles === Suit overcalls promise at least 5 cards. Jump overcalls promise at least 6 cards, but may be played as weak, intermediate or strong. BfA Acol uses intermediate (opening hand, 11\u201316 points). 1NT overcall typically promises 15\u201318 points and at least one stopper in opponents' suit. Double is for takeout, showing an opening hand (12+ points) short in opponents' suit (occasionally a very strong hand, at least 16+ points, of other shapes) === Responses to 1 of a suit if opponents overcall === Generally similar to unopposed bidding, but with these differences: * Double \u2014 negative or Sputnik double (up to 2, or often higher in modern methods), for takeout, usually showing at least 4 cards in any unbid major. But note that in earlier versions of Acol, this double was for penalties. * 1NT, 2NT and 3NT limit bids normally promise a stopper in opponents' suit. * 2 of a new suit (without a jump but above 2 of opener's suit) \u2014 at least 5-card suit, at least a good 9 HCP. Forcing for one round. ==Alternatives== In common usage, the term Acol is understood to refer to a four-card majors system. For hybrid systems using the weak NT opening with one or both five-card majors, a different terminology is preferable. * Five card spades or 5-4-4-3 system; the 1 opening shows at least 5 spades, and a hand with 4 spades and 4-3-3-3 shape is opened 1. This can also be played so that the 1 opening either guarantees 5 hearts or 4 cards in both majors. A 1 opening may be on only 3 cards. * Five card majors with a weak NT; both 1 and 1 openings guarantee 5 cards. Sometimes known as the \"Third Way\" system; the first system of this type was the Kaplan\u2013Sheinwold system. To handle 4-4-3-2 hands with both 4 card majors, this needs either a \"short club\" (1 can be as few as 2 cards) or both a prepared 1 and 1 which could be just 3 card suits. Five card majors are more commonly used with a strong no trump, as in Standard American. ==References== ==External links== * The English Bridge Union, Standard English Modern Acol System File (PDF) * Standard English Acol (Described as a \"dialect of Acol\") * Landy and EBU Committee.
