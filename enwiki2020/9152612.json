The Rooster Crows was a Caldecott Medal winner for illustration in 1946.\"Caldecott Medal Winners, 1938 \u2013 Present\" This book is a collection of traditional American nursery rhymes, finger games, skipping rhymes, jingles, and counting-out rhymes. They come from collections all over America. ==Description== The book the rooster crows is 64 pages, with rhymes and jingles as well illustrations on each page. The illustrations in the book are Native American, done in pencil with color. The colors in the book stay within grey, white, green, orange, and red. ==Plot summary== \u201cLittle Miss Muffet\u201d and \u201cStar Light, Star Bright,\u201d come back to the memory as easily as \u201cRoses are red, Violets are blue.\u201d There are finger games that gives illustrations of how to play as one goes as followed: These are mothers knives and forks And this is mother's table. This is mother's looking glass And this is baby cradle. the rhyme has illustration so the reader can understand to put your hand together like a knife, and end with a cradle which helps kids and makes the book even more interesting. The setting and clothing are very different from our time today(2014) which may seem like the book is old fashioned, but it has much to show in the enjoyable pictures. Little details such as the children wearing overalls, children wearing bonnets, and just the overall color structure highlights the time frame of these rhymes. The illustrations are done in pencil and they have so much detail. The children's faces in the illustration show much feelings and expression. ==Critical reception== A 1967 review in The Horn Book Magazine states the Petershams have made delightful pictures, in soft harmonious colors, with plenty of humor for these and many other rhymes that American children chant freely. According to Jill May Petershams writing is simple and smooth; it is not descriptive and is not detailed in plot.MAY, JILL P. \"Petersham, Maud Fuller.\" American Women Writers: A Critical Reference Guide from Colonial Times to the Present: A Critical Reference Guide from Colonial Times to the Present.
