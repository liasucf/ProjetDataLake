    "text": "Maidu traditional narratives include myths, legends, tales, and oral histories preserved by the Maidu, Konkow, and Nisenan people of eastern Sacramento Valley and foothills in northeastern California. Maidu oral literature aligned the Maidu closely with their central California neighbors, such as the Wintu and Valley and Sierra Miwok, but also showed influences from the Great Basin Northern Paiute and Washoe to the east.
