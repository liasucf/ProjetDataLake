It is named after the politician and captain of the Spanish electricity industry Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Oriol y Urquijo. The dam regulates much of the flow of the Tagus River, the longest of the Iberian Peninsula. It was built in 1969 and is the second largest reservoir in Europe. The Roman Alc\u00e1ntara Bridge is located 600 m downstream from the dam. ==References== ==External links== * \"Empresas ICA S.A.B. de C.V.
