Press Releases on the Refugee Action Collective Website. He was a longtime member of the International Socialist Organisation, but was one of a large portion of the membership who left in 2003 around the issue of that group's involvement in the Socialist Alliance. He went on to be a founding member of the organisation Solidarity in Sydney, which merged with two other groups in 2008 to form a new organisation also named Solidarity. == References == Category:Living people Category:Australian Trotskyists Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
