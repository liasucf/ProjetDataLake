In 1981, he won an international chess tournament in Sochi, becoming grandmaster of second rank. After a successful win at the tournament he was offered a position by Vera Tikhomirova to lead the Russian Chess School. Following the acceptance of a position, Panchenko trained such future grandmasters as Sergei Rublevsky, Ekaterina Kovalevskaya, Alisa Galliamova, and Sergey Volkov. Panchenko served as head coach of the 4th juniors' games in Kramatorsk, Soviet Union, which include such chess champions as Alexey Dreev, Igor Khenkin, Ruslan Shcherbakov, Maxim Sorokin, and Mikhail Ulibin.
