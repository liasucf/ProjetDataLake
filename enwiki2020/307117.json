    "text": "East Finchley is an area in North London, immediately north of Hampstead Heath. Like neighbouring Muswell Hill it straddles the London Boroughs of Barnet and Haringey, with most of East Finchley falling into the London Borough of Barnet. It has the greenest high road in London East Finchley is situated northwest of Charing Cross. Geographically, it is separated from the rest of Finchley by the North Circular, with North Finchley and West Finchley to the north, and Finchley Central (Church End) to the west. East Finchley (East End) was first mentioned in 1365 when it formed a scattered hamlet, but by 1860 it was the most populous part of Finchley. Badly bombed during World War 2, and with the subsequent re-building, the street pattern of the Old Village was destroyed. However, the area retains a strong community feeling compared to other parts of Finchley. The area collectively named Finchley, which included East Finchley (East End), Finchley Central (Church End) and North Finchley, was a parish until its incorporation into the ancient county of Middlesex in 1878; the county of Middlesex was abolished and Finchley was incorporated into Greater London in 1965. Although most of East Finchley falls into the parliamentary constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, East Finchley is a village in its own right and not considered to be part of the town of Finchley. == History == East Finchley High Road in 1962 The land on which most of East Finchley now stands was once part of the Bishop of London's hunting ground, to the south of Finchley Common, first recorded around 1400. The Bishop of London built a road through his land, named The Bishop's Avenue, which still exists today. Another road extended further north, weaving through what is now Market Place, The Walks, King Street, and Oak Lane. As a result, pubs such as The Old White Lion, The Bald Faced Stag, and The Five Bells (on East End Road), all of which survive today, sprang up to provide rest for the people using the road. The area of \"East Finchley Old Village\" around Church Lane was west of the common and Bulls Lane (now Church Lane) dates back to at least the 17th century. With the coming of the Great Northern Railway in 1868, the area began to emerge, and the property was built gradually between the 1870s and the 1930s. However, it was not until 1914 that a more recognisable East Finchley High Road and surrounding area was visible. == Governance == From around 1547 Finchley had a parish vestry, which became a local board in 1878, an urban district council in 1895, and finally a municipal borough council between 1933\u20131965. The area is now part of the London Borough of Barnet. From 1959\u20131992 the Finchley constituency was represented in Parliament by Margaret Thatcher, UK Prime Minister from 1979\u20131990. Finchley is now included in the new constituency of Finchley and Golders Green, currently represented by a Conservative Member of Parliament. East Finchley is represented on Barnet Council by three elected Labour Councillors.https://barnet.moderngov.co.uk/mgMemberIndex.aspx?FN=WARD&VW;=TABLE&PIC;=1 == Transport == East Finchley Southbound Platform East Finchley Underground station is marked by a well-known statue of an archer by Eric Aumonier in the Art Deco style. The archer is pointing his arrow towards the entrance to the tunnel which starts south of the station and runs for to the end of the Northern line at Morden. For many years this was the longest tunnel in the world. There was originally an arrow at Morden Station to match the archer at East Finchley, but this was stolen a few months after the station was opened. The station is on the High Barnet branch of the Northern line which serves the city (via Bank) and the west end (via Charing Cross) with trains every 2\u20133 minutes. Buses also serve the high street with the 263 route going from Barnet Hospital to Highbury Barn; the 143 bus linking East Finchley to Archway, London and Brent Cross; the 102 from Edmonton Green, and the 234 serving Barnet, The Spires from Highgate Wood. == Housing == Housing in East Finchley is diverse in its nature, encompassing many housing styles, from 19th-century terraced housing, large 30s houses, and multimillion-pound mansions on The Bishop's Avenue. The three eleven-storey tower blocks of Prospect Ring & Norfolk Close, near to the centre of East Finchley, are visible for miles around. == Schools == East Finchley has several state primary schools, including Our Lady of Lourdes RC primary school, Martin Primary SchoolMartin Primary School (Ofsted Outstanding), and Holy Trinity Primary School. There are two secondary schools in East Finchley itself\u2014Bishop Douglass RC High School (Roman Catholic and mixed) and Christ's College (mixed, as of 2018). The Archer Academy, a new non-denominational, non-selective community secondary schoolThe Archer Academy opened in East Finchley in September 2013 and is already oversubscribed. Many local children attend schools elsewhere in the London Borough of Barnet. For those living in the direction of Muswell Hill to the east of the High Road, Fortismere School (mixed comprehensive, which falls under the London Borough of Haringey Local Education Authority) is an option and many East Finchleans also fall into the catchment area for Brookland Junior School, which neighbours Christ's College.

It is the oldest purpose-built cinema in the UK (the only older ones having started life as theatres). Time Out, the arts magazine, describes the Phoenix as the best single-screen cinema in London. Film critic Mark Kermode has written that the Phoenix Cinema \"remains the single most significant cinema in my development as a bona fide cinema obsessive.\"Kermode, Mark. It's Only a Movie: Reel Life Adventures of a Film Obsessive. London: Random House, 2010; page 26. There is a listed Neo-Georgian public library located on the High Road opposite Leslie Road. Behind the library are some award-winning allotments, owned by Barnet Council. Adjacent to these are the Fuelland allotments which are held in trust. The massive St. Pancras and Islington Cemetery is located on the High Road. Established in 1854, it is the oldest municipal cemetery in London and the largest. The Victorian painter Ford Madox Brown is buried there. Opposite East Finchley tube station is Cherry Tree Wood, approx. 4.5 ha in size, and contains both woodland and grassland. Nearby parks include Coldfall Wood to the north, and Highgate Wood, Queens Wood, and Hampstead Heath to the south. Also close to the tube station is the head office of McDonald's UK; this is seen by the flags and logos on the building. == Media == The Archer, founded in 1993, is East Finchley's free monthly community newspaper, run by volunteers.
