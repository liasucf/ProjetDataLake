    "text": "The First National Bank of Davenport, also known as Brenton Bank and The Brenton, is an historic building located in central Davenport, Iowa, United States. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==History== The three-story Modern Movement building was built in 1967 for the First National Bank of Davenport, a part of the Brenton Bank network in Iowa. It was originally designed to be a part of a larger commercial development with several Mid-century modern-style buildings. When those plans changed the bank building was self-financed independently of the larger development. The building is significant for its embrace of New Formalism architecture. The Davenport Public Library building downtown and this building are considered the two most significant examples of the style in the city. It also marks the shift from the historical revival styles and the more restricted expressions of Modernism. There was an emphasis placed on the building's structure and construction grid on a raised base. The three-story concrete and steel frame structure was designed by the local architectural firm of Stewart-Robison- Laffan. After the bank discontinued its operations, the building was acquired by the Davenport Community School District for its offices and other programs. In July 2018 the school district moved its operations into a former school building across the street. Newbury Living of West Des Moines, Iowa began converting the building into a mixed-use project. The $6.7 million renovation created 38 new apartments and it was completed in 2020. The apartments are located on the second and third floors, while the first floor is an open public gathering space. A gaming room was placed in the bank's former vault in the basement. ==References== Category:Office buildings completed in 1967 Category:Modernist architecture in Iowa Category:Buildings and structures in Davenport, Iowa Category:Bank buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Iowa Category:National Register of Historic Places in Davenport, Iowa ",
