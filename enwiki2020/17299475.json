    "text": "Stay as You Are (), also known as Stay the Way You Are, is a 1978 Italian\u2013Spanish erotic drama film, directed by Alberto Lattuada, starring Nastassja Kinski, Marcello Mastroianni, Barbara De Rossi, and Ania Pieroni. It follows the May\u2013December romance between a vivacious young coed and a middle- aged professional who is unhappy in his marriage. New Line Cinema gave the film a limited theatrical release in the United States on 21 December 1979. The film was scheduled for release by Cult Epics in May 2015 on DVD and Blu- ray. ==Plot== While in Florence on business, Roman landscape architect Giulio Marengo meets an alluring college student, Francesca, and spends the night with her. She is the foster daughter of an agriculturist named Bartolo who has looked after her since the death of her mother, Flora. Later, a friend of Giulio's sees Francesca in a restaurant and implies that she might be Giulio's daughter. It is a possibility since Giulio had been going out with Flora the year before Francesca was born. Shocked by the idea, Giulio tries to cool his relationship with Francesca. Meanwhile, he is distracted by the revelation that his unmarried daughter Alexandra, who is about the same age as Francesca, is pregnant. Giulio tries unsuccessfully to get to the truth of his alleged paternity, and finally decides to tell Francesca the reason for his conflicting behavior. She flatly dismisses the insinuation, however, saying she regards Bartolo as her only true father. She then accompanies Giulio on an uninhibited holiday in Madrid, where Alexandra has gone to try to sort things out with her lover. Upon returning to Florence, Giulio must get back to Rome to attend to his business affairs, but that night, Francesca insists they see the movie Vampyr together, and he falls asleep. Upon waking up, she is nowhere to be seen, indicating that their love affair has run its course. ==Cast== * Marcello Mastroianni as Giulio Marengo * Nastassja Kinski as Francesca * Francisco Rabal as Lorenzo * M\u00f3nica Randall as Luisa Marengo * Ania Pieroni as Cecilia * Barbara De Rossi as Alexandra Marengo * Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Caffarel as Bartolo * Giuliana Calandra as Teresa * Maria Pia Attanasio as Countess Archi * Raimondo Penne as Notary * Claudio Aliotti * Massimo Bonetti as the Horse Trainer * Mario Cecchi as the Gardener * Adriana Falco as Giulio's secretary * Rodolfo Bigotti ==Production== Director Alberto Lattuada shot scenes for the film at various locations in and around Florence, including the Piazza San Giovanni, the Piazza San Marco, and the Boboli Gardens. The opening title sequence was shot on the grounds of Villa La Pietra. The musical score was composed by Ennio Morricone, who previously collaborated with the director on Matchless. A soundtrack album was released in 1978 by Cinevox, and again on 14 July 1995 by Prometheus Records. The soundtrack is notable for its inclusion of the love theme \"Amore per Amore\", as well as the two disco tracks \"Dance On\" and \"Spazio 1999\". ==Reception== This film received positive reviews, especially for Nastassja Kinski's performance. According to the American poster for this film, Bruce Williamson of Playboy called it \"A truly sexy film\". Time magazine also praised Kinski's performance saying, \"Kinski is simply ravishing, genuinely sexy and high-spirited without being painfully aggressive about it.\" Conversely, Janet Maslin of The New York Times called the film \"dangerously smarmy at times\u2014dangerous because its cheapness undermines Mr. Mastroianni's essentially serious performance, which is the backbone of the movie. The film works best when the story seems to generate its sexual encounters spontaneously. But there are too many times when the plot looks like a pretext for stringing together amorous interludes.\" Because Kinski was just 17 years old at the time, her many nude scenes created controversy. She has since disapproved of the nudity in the film on a number of occasions. Recalling the film in a 1981 interview with People, Kinski said, \"There was no one prepared to say, 'She shouldn't do that. There is no point.' No one to protect me. I was just a young girl, in Italy. It was stupid.\" In 2001, Kinski reiterated her dissatisfaction with her performance: \"Let's put it this way, if that was my daughter, I wouldn't allow that. I wouldn't allow certain people to say certain things or to try certain things.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1970s romantic drama films Category:1978 films Category:1970s erotic drama films Category:Erotic romance films Category:Films scored by Ennio Morricone Category:Films directed by Alberto Lattuada Category:Films set in Florence Category:Incest in film Category:Italian romantic drama films Category:Italian erotic drama films Category:Italian films Category:Italian-language films Category:Spanish romantic drama films Category:Spanish erotic drama films Category:Spanish films Category:1978 drama films ",
