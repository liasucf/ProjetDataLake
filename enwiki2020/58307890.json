He repeated his examinations and finally with his father's influence gained a seat in Raffles. He alleged that he was 'ragged' by Lee Kuan Yew. Eusoffe read law at the University College, University of London, graduating with LL.B First Class Honours. ==Legacy== As an advocate at the Bar, the late Eusoffe was unsurpassed in his knowledge of the law and unmatchable in his advocacy, earning him a reputation as a formidable opponent. Lawyers and laymen alike were awed by his brilliance and his intellectual prowess, which he defused only by his dry sense of humour. ==Personal life== His father, Sir Hussein Hasanally Abdoolcader was a prominent lawyer, a community leader and politician. Hussein was a member of the Straits Settlements Legislative Council and a member of the Advisory Council to the Governor of the Malayan Union. Hussein also made a name for himself in the Straits Settlement as the first Malaya Indian to be knighted by King George VI in 1948. Eusoffe was married to Haseenah. ==Death== On 11 January 1996, following the death of his wife, Eusoffe committed suicide in his Taman Jesselton home. ==References== Category:1924 births Category:1996 deaths Category:Male suicides Category:Malaysian people of Indian descent Category:Malaysian Muslims Category:Malaysian lawyers Category:Malaysian judges Category:20th-century lawyers ",
