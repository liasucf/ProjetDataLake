Pan-Iranism is an ideology that advocates solidarity and reunification of Iranian peoples living in the Iranian plateau and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the Persians, Azeris, Lurs, Gilaks, Mazanderanis, Kurds, Zazas, Talysh, Tajiks of Tajikistan and Afghanistan, Pashtuns, Ossetians, Baloch of Pakistan, etc. The first theoretician was Dr Mahmoud Afshar Yazdi.Professor Richard Frye states:The Turkish speakers of Azerbaijan are mainly descended from the earlier Iranian speakers, several pockets of whom still exist in the region (Frye, Richard Nelson, \u201cPeoples of Iran\u201d, in Encyclopedia Iranica).Swietochowski, Tadeusz. \u201cAzerbaijan, Republic of\u201d,., Vol. 3, Colliers Encyclopedia CD-ROM, 02-28-1996: \u201cThe original Persian population became fused with the Turks, and gradually the Persian language was supplanted by a Turkic dialect that evolved into the distinct Azerbaijani language.\u201dGolden, P.B. \u201cAn Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples\u201d, Otto Harrosowitz, 1992. \u201cThe Azeris of today are an overwhelmingly sedentary, detribalized people.

Excerpt: The toponyms, with more than half of the place names of Iranian origin in some areas, such as the Sahand, a huge volcanic massif south of Tabriz, or the Qara Dagh, near the border (Planhol, 1966, p. 305; Bazin, 1982, p. 28) bears witness to this continuity. The language itself provides eloquent proof. Azeri, not unlike Uzbek (see above), lost the vocal harmony typical of Turkish languages. It is a Turkish language learned and spoken by Iranian peasants.\u201d(Encyclopedia Iranica, \u201cLands of Iran\u201d)\u201cThus Turkish nomads, in spite of their deep penetration throughout Iranian lands, only slightly influenced the local culture.

Translation:\"However, the availability of powerful layer of Iranians took part in the formation of the Azerbaijani ethnic group, left their mark primarily in the Azerbaijani language, in which a great number of Iranian and Arabic words. The latter included in the Azeri, and Turkish language primarily through Iranian mediation.\" == Origins and ideology == Flag of the Pan-Iranist Party Flag of the SUMKA Iranian political scientist Dr. Mahmoud Afshar developed the Pan-Iranist ideology in the early 1920s in opposition to Pan-Turkism and Pan-Arabism, which were seen as potential threats to the territorial integrity of Iran.AHMAD ASHRAF, \"IRANIAN IDENTITY IN THE 19TH AND 20TH CENTURIES\", Encyclopedia Iranica. Also accessible here:. Excerpt: \"Af\u0161\u0101r, a political scientist, pioneered systematic scholarly treatment of various aspects of Iranian national identity, territorial integrity, and national unity. An influential nationalist, he also displayed a strong belief in the nationalist character of Iranian people throughout the country\u2019s long history. He was the first to propose the idea of Pan-Iranism to safeguard the unity and territorial integrity of the nation against the onslaught of Pan-Turkism and Pan-Arabism (Af\u0161\u0101r, p. 187)\" He also displayed a strong belief in the nationalist character of Iranian people throughout the country\u2019s long history. Unlike similar movements of the time in other countries, Pan-Iranism was ethnically and linguistically inclusive and solely concerned with territorial nationalism, rather than ethnic or racial nationalism.Perspectives on Iranian identity, pg.26 On the eve of World War I, pan-Turkists focused on the Turkic-speaking lands of Iran, Caucasus and Central Asia.Touraj Atabaki, \u201cRecasting Oneself, Rejecting the Other: Pan- Turkism and Iranian Nationalism\u201d in Van Schendel, Willem(Editor). Identity Politics in Central Asia and the Muslim World: Nationalism, Ethnicity and Labour in the Twentieth Century. London, GBR: I. B. Tauris & Company, Limited, 2001. Actual Quote: The ultimate purpose was to persuade these populations to secede from the larger political entities to which they belonged and join the new pan-Turkic homeland. It was the latter appeal to Iranian Azerbaijanis, which, contrary to Pan-Turkist intentions, caused a small group of Azerbaijani intellectuals to become the strongest advocates of the territorial integrity of Iran. After the constitutional revolution in Iran, a romantic nationalism was adopted by Azerbaijani Democrats as a reaction to the pan-Turkist irredentist policies threatening Iran\u2019s territorial integrity. It was during this period that Iranism and linguistic homogenization policies were proposed as a defensive nature against all others. Contrary to what one might expect, foremost among innovating this defensive nationalism were Iranian Azerbaijanis. They viewed that assuring the territorial integrity of the country was the first step in building a society based on law and a modern state. Through this framework, their political loyalty outweighed their ethnic and regional affiliations. The adoption of these integrationist policies paved the way for the emergence of the titular ethnic group\u2019s cultural nationalism. ==History== Pan-Iranist flags seen during Pro-Mosaddegh rallies in Tehran on 16 August 1953 With the collapse of the Qajar dynasty, which had descended into corruption, and the rise of Reza Shah Pahlavi in 1925, who began introducing secular reforms limiting the power of the Shia clergy, Iranian nationalist and socialist thinkers had hoped that this new era would also witness the introduction of democratic reforms. However, such reforms did not take place. This culminated in the gradual rise of a loosely organized grass roots Pan-Iranist movement made up of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists allied with other pro-democracy movements. In the 1940s, following the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the Pan-Iranist movement gained momentum and popularity as a result of the widespread feeling of insecurity among Iranians who saw the king, Reza Shah, powerless against such foreign presence in the country. There were soldiers from Russia, England, India, New Zealand, Australia and later on, America, present in the country, especially in the capital, Tehran. The Allied occupation influenced a series of student movements in 1941. One of these new groups was an underground nationalist guerrilla group called the Revenge group, also known as the Anjoman. The Pan- Iranist Party was founded later on by two of the members of the Revenge group and two other students in the mid-to-late 1940s in Tehran University. Though the pan-Iranist movement had been active throughout the 1930s, it had been a loosely organized grass roots alliance of nationalist writers, teachers, students, and activists. The party was the first organization to officially adopt the pan-Iranist position, which believed in the solidarity and reunification of the Iranian peoples inhabiting the Iranian plateau. In 1951, the party leaders Mohsen Pezeshkpour and Dariush Forouhar came to a disagreement as to how the party should operate, and a division occurred. The two factions greatly differed in their organizational structure and practice. The Pezeskpour faction, which retained the party name, believed in working within the system of Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Forouhar faction, which adopted a new name, Mellat Iran (Nation of Iran Party), believed in working against the system. ==Iran-e-Bozorg== Iran-e Bozorg was a periodical published in the city of Rasht by the Armenian political activist Gregory Yeghikian (). It advocated the unification of Iranian peoples (e.g., Afghans, Kurds, etc.) included the Armenians. Yaqiki\u0101n believed that, with education and the rising of the levels of people\u2019s awareness, such a goal was feasible through peaceful means. The journal benefited from the contributions of a number of leading intellectuals of the time, including Mo\u1e25ammad Mo\u02bfin and \u02bfAli Esfandi\u0101ri (Nim\u0101 Yu\u0161ij), and carried articles, poetry, a serialized story, and some news. It also published articles in support of the Kurds who had risen in rebellion in Turkey, which caused the protest of the Turkish counsel in Rasht and led to the banning of the paper by the order of the minister of court. Yaqiki\u0101n tried, without success, to have the ban removed and eventually moved to Tehran, where he published the paper Ir\u0101n-e Konuni. ==See also== *Greater Iran *Iranian peoples *Iranian languages *Persian Empire *History of Azerbaijan *History of Iran *History of Afghanistan *History of Tajikistan *History of Pakistan *History of Turkey *History of Uzbekistan *History of the Kurds ==Further reading== *Hezbe Pan Iranist by Ali Kabar Razmjoo () *Engheta, Naser (2001). 50 years history with the Pan-Iranists.
