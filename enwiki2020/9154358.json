    "text": "Manors is an underground station on the Tyne and Wear Metro, serving the city centre, Manors and Shieldfield in Newcastle upon Tyne. The station joined the network in November 1982, following the opening of the line between Tynemouth and St. James. The station is located a short walk away from the National Rail station at Manors, which is situated on the East Coast Main Line. An abstract mural, Magic City by British artist Basil Beattie, was commissioned in 1987, and can be seen on the station concourse. The station is located towards the edge of the city centre, and is relatively lightly used. Manors was used by 170,337 passengers in 2017\u201318, making it the eighth-least-used station on the network. Heading east from Manors, the route surfaces alongside the East Coast Main Line, before crossing the dramatic Byker Viaduct over the Ouseburn Valley, towards Byker. The S-shaped viaduct was constructed for the Tyne and Wear Metro by Ove Arup, with work commencing in 1976, and completed in 1979. The former North Eastern Railway route between Manors and Jesmond is connected by a link tunnel, located to the west of the station. It is used only by trains running out of public service, allowing them to terminate at Manors, and then return to the depot at South Gosforth (and vice versa), without having to travel around the North Tyneside Loop. == Facilities == Step-free access is available at all stations across the Tyne and Wear Metro network, with two lifts providing step-free access to platforms at Manors. As part of the Metro: All Change programme, new lifts were installed at Manors in 2014, with new escalators installed in 2015. The station is equipped with ticket machines, seating, next train information displays, timetable posters, and an emergency help point on both platforms. Ticket machines are able to accept payment with credit and debit card (including contactless payment), notes and coins. The station is fitted with automatic ticket barriers, which were installed at 13 stations across the network during the early 2010s, as well as smartcard validators, which feature at all stations. There is no dedicated parking at the station, however there are nearby pay and display car parks, operated by Newcastle City Council. There is the provision for cycle parking, with 5 cycle pods available for use. == Service and frequency == Manors is served by the , which operates between South Shields and St. James with an end-to-end journey time of 83 minutes.
