Edith was born in 1859 near Campbelltown, South Australia; by 1875 she was a pupil teacher at the Grote Street Model School; in 1877 she was the school's second assistant; and promoted to first assistant the following year. Around this time she was studying at Adelaide University: Latin under Professor Lamb, botany under Professor Tate, and Physiology under Professor Stirling. In 1879 she was seconded to the about-to-be-opened Advanced School for Girls in Franklin Street as deputy to Jane Stanes. Stanes retired at the end of 1880, and Edith was appointed her successor, though a Government regulation, stipulating that a head of a school must be aged 25, had to be waived by the Minister of Education J. Langdon Parsons. While head of the school she frequently invited Catherine Helen Spence to address the students.Susan Magarey Unbridling the Tongues of Women: A Biography of Catherine Helen Spence She married \"Sam\" H\u00fcbbe ( \u20131900) in January 1885 and late that year she resigned from ASG, to be replaced by Madeline Rees George (c. 1851\u20131931).
