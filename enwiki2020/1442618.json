If is a real Lie algebra and is a representation of it over the vector space , then the conjugate representation is defined over the conjugate vector space as follows: : is the conjugate of for all in .This is the mathematicians' convention. Physicists use a different convention where the Lie bracket of two real vectors is an imaginary vector. In the physicist's convention, insert a minus in the definition. is also a representation, as one may check explicitly. If two real Lie algebras have the same complexification, and we have a complex representation of the complexified Lie algebra, their conjugate representations are still going to be different. See spinor for some examples associated with spinor representations of the spin groups and . If \\mathfrak{g} is a *-Lie algebra (a complex Lie algebra with a * operation which is compatible with the Lie bracket), : is the conjugate of for all in For a finite-dimensional unitary representation, the dual representation and the conjugate representation coincide. This also holds for pseudounitary representations. ==See also== *Dual representation ==Notes== Category:Representation theory of groups ",
