Cula-Reid was a member of the Australia women's international rules football team that played against Ireland in the 2006 Ladies' International Rules Series. She was involved in a sex discrimination case when she and two other girls challenged the Moorabbin Saints Junior Football League and Football Victoria Ltd's rules that forbid girls from playing in mixed sex teams after the age of twelve. The case changed the rule from restricting girls from playing in the under 12s to the under 15s, which still prevented Cula-Reid from playing in mixed sex teams.Court and Tribunal Decisions, Play by the rulesTaylor v Moorabbin Saints Junior Football League and Football Victoria Ltd [2004] VCAT 158 (17 February 2004) She has been credited with \"effectively forcing\" AFL Victoria to create a youth girls competition.
