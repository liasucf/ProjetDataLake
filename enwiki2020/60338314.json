    "text": "The Candel\u00e1ria Formation, in other literature also referred to as Candel\u00e1ria Sequence,M\u00fcller et al., 2017, p.543Martinelli et al., 2017, p.528 is a sedimentary formation of the Santa Maria Group (also called Santa Maria Supersequence) in the Paran\u00e1 Basin in Rio Grande do Sul, southeastern Brazil.Candel\u00e1ria Formation at Fossilworks.org The formation dates to the Carnian of the Late Triassic, locally referred to as Tuvalian, from 231.4 to approximately 222 Ma. The Candel\u00e1ria Formation is composed of mudstones and sandstones deposited in a lacustrine to deltaic (distal floodplain) environment. It overlies the Santa Maria Formation and is partly overlain by and partly laterally equivalent to the Caturrita Formation. The formation comprises two Assemblage zones; the older Hyperodapedon and the younger Riograndia Assemblage Zones. Several cynodonts and other therapsids as well as early dinosaurs were found in the formation in the vicinity of Agudo. == Description == Candel\u00e1ria Sequence in the Paran\u00e1 Basin The Candel\u00e1ria Formation or Sequence corresponds to a third-order sequence placed in the Santa Maria Supersequence. The basal portion of the formation consists of a coarsening-upward succession that begins with red mudstones, interbedded with small-scale trough cross-bedded sandstone lenses. Rhythmites and sigmoidal massive to climbing cross-laminated sandstone bodies are also present. This facies association is interpreted as a lacustrine to deltaic (distal floodplain)Pretto et al., 2015, p.2 depositional environment in a humid climate. The formation contains the Hyperodapedon and Riograndia Assemblage Zones.Soares et al., 2014, p.1675Pacheco et al., 2017, p.2 The red beds are divided into a non-fossiliferous portion at the base, and an upper fossiliferous unit. Coprolites and putative rhizoliths are present. A light- colored cross-bedded sandstone also occurs at the top of the formation and represents a river channel. It is delimited by an erosive contact with the underlying red beds. The Candel\u00e1ria Formation is considered a local equivalent of the Caturrita Formation,Da Rosa & Faccini, 2005, p.21 which it partly underlies. It overlies the Santa Maria Formation.Da Rosa & Faccini, 2005, p.18 The formation is correlated with the Ischigualasto Formation of the Ischigualasto-Villa Uni\u00f3n Basin in northwestern Argentina.Botha-Brink, 2018, p.7 == Basin history == Late Triassic (220 Ma) Stratigraphic chart of the Paran\u00e1 Basin, with the Candel\u00e1ria Formation belonging to the Gondwana II Supersequence The megaregional Paran\u00e1 Basin, covering an approximate area of in southeastern South America, was in the late Paleozoic and early Mesozoic part of Gondwana, the southern latitude area of Pangea. Before the opening of the South Atlantic, a rifting phase that started in the Jurassic, the basin was connected to the basins of present-day southern Africa. The Candel\u00e1ria Formation forms part of the Gondwana II Supersequence representing the onset of continental deposition in the Paran\u00e1 Basin. The Triassic paleofauna of the Paran\u00e1 Basin is correlated with the African faunas of the Omingonde Formation of the Waterberg Basin in Namibia, the Molteno Formation of the Karoo Basin in South Africa and the Fremouw Formation of present-day Antarctica.Milani et al., 2007 == Fossil content == Brasilitherium riograndensis Limb bone osteohistology of Brasilitherium riograndensis Ulna osteohistology of Brasilodon quadrangularis The formation has provided fossils of therapsids characteristic of the Late Triassic, as well as early dinosaurs. {| class=\"wikitable\" !
