Today he is most known for his biblical stories for schoolchildren. Vogt was born in the village of Reerslev near Roskilde, Denmark. He was the son of Johan Nilsen Vogt (1783\u20131859) and Henriette Elisabeth Lorenzina Juhl (1790\u20131846). He grew up at Tune in Oslo, Norway where his father was a Church of Norway vicar and later provost. He earned his cand.theol. in 1838. He was a teacher at the Christiania Cathedral School for fifty years (1839 to 1889). Vogt taught in religion, geography and the French language. In 1863 he conducted an extended research trip to Syria and Palestine, where he gathered impressions and historical data. He published a number of popular works of the Gospels, a textbook in Church history and various textbooks on Bible history. His textbook Bibelhistorie med Lidt af Kirkens Historie from 1858 became widely used in schools, and had been printed in more than a million copies at the time of his death. ==Selected works== *Udtog af Kirkehistorien n\u00e6rmest til Brug ved de l\u00e6rde Skoler \u2013 1843 *Forklaring af Matth\u00e6i Evangelium til Skolebrug \u2013 1849 *Forklaring af Johannes's Evangelium til Skolebrug \u2013 1856 *Bibelhistorie med Beskrivelse af det Hellige Land for Borger- og h\u00f8iere Almueskoler \u2013 1862 *Forklaring af Luthers lille Katekismus, efter Pontoppidan- 1865 *Kirkehistorie til Skolebrug \u2013 1865 *Reise i det Hellige Land og Syrien, tilleggshefte til Folkevennen \u2013 1865 *Det Hellige Land \u2013 1868 *Matt\u00e6us' Evangelium i \u00e6ndret Overs\u00e6ttelse med Anm\u00e6rkninger \u2013 1884 *Stykker af 12 Kapitler af f\u00f8rste Mosebog, i \u00e6ndret Overs\u00e6ttelse med Anm\u00e6rkninger \u2013 1886 ==References== Category:1817 births Category:1889 deaths Category:Danish emigrants to Norway Category:Norwegian theologians Category:Norwegian schoolteachers Category:19th-century Norwegian writers Category:People from H\u00f8je-Taastrup Municipality ",
