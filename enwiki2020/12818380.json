After high school, Davis originally committed to attend the University of Florida, but later turned down the offer to play professional baseball. ==Professional career== ===Tampa Bay Rays=== ====Draft and minors==== Davis pitching for the Southwest Michigan Devil Rays in 2006 The Tampa Bay Devil Rays selected Davis in the third round, with the 75th overall selection, of the 2004 MLB draft. In the minors, he sported a 93\u201394 mph fastball, and a spike curveball. Davis has expanded his repertoire to include a two-seam fastball, a slider, and a changeup. ====2009==== Davis made his major league debut on September 6, 2009, against the Detroit Tigers. He earned a no- decision after pitching seven innings, allowing one run, with nine strikeouts. ====2010==== Davis was the July 2010 AL Rookie Pitcher of the Month, after posting a 4\u20130 record with a 3.03 ERA in five starts. He was named a starting pitcher on Baseball America's 2010 All-Rookie Team. The Tampa Bay chapter of the Baseball Writers' Association of America also named Davis the Most Outstanding Rookie of the Tampa Bay Rays for the 2010 season. He came in 4th in the voting for 2010 AL Rookie of the Year. ====2011\u20132012==== Tampa Bay Rays in 2012 After two years in the Rays' starting rotation, Davis spent 2012 coming out of the Rays' bullpen and had a strong season. ===Kansas City Royals=== On December 9, 2012, Davis was traded to the Kansas City Royals (along with James Shields) in exchange for Wil Myers, Jake Odorizzi, Mike Montgomery and Patrick Leonard. ====2013==== Davis spent most of 2013 in the Royals' rotation and compiled a 6\u201310 record through the end of August. He moved to the bullpen for September 2013 and remained in the bullpen through 2014. ====2014==== In 2014, Davis posted one of the most dominant seasons ever by a reliever. From June 25 to September 16, Davis did not give up an earned run. On September 15, his ERA was an astonishing 0.69. On September 22, 2014, Davis struck out Yan Gomes for his 104th strikeout of the season, breaking the Royals record for most strikeouts by a relief pitcher, which was 103 and had been shared by Jim York (1971) and Greg Holland (2013). Davis finished the regular season with a 9-2 record, posting a 1.00 ERA. He struck out 109 batters and walked 23. He did not give up a home run in 2014.

On August 1, Davis' homerless streak ended at 125.2 innings, giving up a home run to the Blue Jays' Jos\u00e9 Bautista. His streak was the second longest in Royals history, and the longest such streak by a reliever. On September 22, Davis was selected by manager Ned Yost as the Royals' new closer, as the Royals announced that Greg Holland was done for the year and possibly all of 2016 due to pending Tommy John surgery. On October 23, Davis forced Blue Jays slugger and 2015 American League MVP candidate Josh Donaldson to ground out to Mike Moustakas at third base, which was the final out to secure the Royals' second consecutive American League Championship Series title. Davis later recorded the final three outs of the 2015 World Series, as the Royals defeated the New York Mets in five games.

In Game 5 of the 2017 National League Division Series, he tied a Division Series record with 3 saves which tied Aroldis Chapman.
