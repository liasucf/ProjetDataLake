    "text": "Christine Bernardi (18 May 1955 \u2013 10 March 2018) was a French mathematician known for her research on numerical analysis of partial differential equations. ==Life== Bernardi was born in Paris, and entered the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure de jeunes filles in 1974. She earned a master's degree in 1975, a dipl\u00f4me d'\u00e9tudes approfondies in numerical analysis in 1978, a doctorat de troisi\u00e8me cycle in 1979, and a doctorat d'\u00e9tat in 1986. Her 1986 dissertation, Contribution \u00e0 l'analyse num\u00e9rique de probl\u00e8mes non lin\u00e9aires, was supervised by Pierre-Arnaud Raviart. She became a researcher for the CNRS in 1979, becoming a director of research in 1992. She worked for CNRS at the Laboratoire Jacques-Louis Lions of Pierre and Marie Curie University, and retired for health reasons roughly a year before her death. ==Books== Bernardi is the author of: *Approximations spectrales de probl\u00e8mes aux limites elliptiques [Spectral approximations of elliptic boundary value problems] (with Yvon Maday, Springer, 1992) *Spectral methods for axisymmetric domains (with Monique Dauge and Yvon Maday, North-Holland, 1999) *Discr\u00e9tisations variationnelles de probl\u00e8mes aux limites elliptiques [Variational discretizations of elliptic boundary value problems] (with Yvon Maday and Francesca Rapetti, Springer, 2004). ==Recognition== In 1995, Bernardi was the winner of the Blaise Pascal Prize, awarded annually for outstanding research in numerical analysis by a young researcher by the French Academy of Sciences in consultation with the Groupe th\u00e9matique pour l'Avancement des M\u00e9thodes Num\u00e9riques de l'Ing\u00e9nieur of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de Math\u00e9matiques Appliqu\u00e9es et Industrielles. She was the first woman to win the prize since its origin in 1985, and until Val\u00e9rie Perrier won in 2003 she was the only woman to win it. In 2018, the International Conference on Spectral and High Order Methods initiated the Christine Bernardi Award, for outstanding research by a young woman in \"high-order approximations for the solution of PDE\u2019s\". ==References== Category:1955 births Category:2018 deaths Category:French mathematicians Category:Women mathematicians ",
