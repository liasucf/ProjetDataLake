    "text": "A low quality toy spinthariscope taken from a 1950s Chemcraft brand \"Atomic energy\" chemistry experimentation set A spinthariscope is a device for observing individual nuclear disintegrations caused by the interaction of ionizing radiation with a phosphor (see radioluminescence) or scintillator. ==Invention== The spinthariscope was invented by William Crookes in 1903.Crookes, W. Certain Properties of the Emanations of Radium. Chemical News; Vol. 87:241; 1903. While observing the apparently uniform fluorescence on a zinc sulfide screen created by the radioactive emissions (mostly alpha radiation) of a sample of radium bromide, he spilled some of the sample, and, owing to its extreme rarity and cost, he was eager to find and recover it. Upon inspecting the zinc sulfide screen under a microscope, he noticed separate flashes of light created by individual alpha particle collisions with the screen. Crookes took his discovery a step further and invented a device specifically intended to view these scintillations. It consisted of a small screen coated with zinc sulfide affixed to the end of a tube, with a tiny amount of radium salt suspended a short distance from the screen and a lens on the other end of the tube for viewing the screen. Crookes named his device from Greek \u03c3\u03c0\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03ae\u03c1 (spinth\u00b4\u0113r) \"spark\". ==Toy spinthariscopes== Spinthariscopes were quickly replaced with more accurate and quantitative devices for measuring radiation in scientific experiments, but enjoyed a modest revival in the mid 20th century as children's educational toys. In 1947, Kix cereal offered a Lone Ranger atomic bomb ring in exchange for a box top and 0.15 USD that contained a small one.Reif, Rita. ARTS/ARTIFACTS; Trivia Long Ago, Serious Treasures Now. The New York Times. 11 June 1995. Spinthariscopes can still be bought today as instructional novelties, but they now use americium or thorium. ==In popular culture== * A spinthariscope plays a pivotal role in the Rick Brant book The Blue Ghost Mystery. * The spinthariscope is mentioned on page 1703 in Burnham's Celestial Handbook by Robert Burnham Jr.. ==References== ==External links== *Modern spinthariscope *Elements of electricity: a practical discussion of the fundamental laws and ... by Robert Andrews Millikan, Edwin Sherwood Bishop, American Technical Society Category:Particle detectors Category:Radioactivity Category:1903 introductions Category:Ionising radiation detectors ",
