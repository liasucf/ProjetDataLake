    "text": "Pterocarpus macrocarpus, or the Burma padauk, is a tree native to the seasonal tropical forests of southeastern Asia: in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, and Vietnam. It has been naturalized in India and the Caribbean. == Description == Pterocarpus macrocarpus is a medium-sized tree growing to 10\u201330 m (rarely to 39 m) tall, with a trunk up to 1.7 m diameter; it is deciduous in the dry season. The bark is flaky, grey-brown; if cut, it secretes a red gum. The leaves are 200\u2013350 mm long, pinnate, with 9\u201311 leaflets. The flowers are yellow, produced in racemes 50\u201390 mm long. The fruit is a pod surrounded by a round wing 45\u201370 mm diameter, containing two or three seeds. The wood is durable and resistant to termites; it is important, used for furniture, construction timber, cart wheels, tool handles, and posts; though not a true rosewood it is sometimes traded as such. The seasonal padauk flowers bloom annually around Thingyan (April) and is considered one of the national symbols of Myanmar (formerly Burma).
