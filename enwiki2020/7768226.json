    "text": "The 66th Academy Awards, which were held on March 21, 1994, saw 35 countries submit films for competition in the Best Foreign Language Film category. The Academy had initially invited 57 countries to send their best films, and the submission deadline was set on November 22, 1993. While the rules were basically unchanged, the applications for the 66th Academy Awards included a new form requesting information about the nationalities of the film's creative team, due to the controversy that had led to the disqualification of A Place in the World at the 65th Academy Awards. The bolded titles were the five nominated films, which came from Hong Kong, Spain, Taiwan, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. It was the first time that the majority of the nominees in this category came from outside Europe (it happened again in 1997, 2006, 2011 and 2018) and is the only time when there have been three Asian nominees. Vietnam made history by becoming the only Southeast Asian country ever to be nominated in this category (accurate ). The prize was ultimately awarded to Spain for the romantic comedy, Belle \u00c9poque. ==Submissions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" width=\"98%\" style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |- !
