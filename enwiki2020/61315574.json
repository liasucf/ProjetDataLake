Cofrex was created with the aim of ensuring long-term development and continuity for these events. It is a sustainable project that uses experience of previous exhibitions in order to organize France\u2019s future participation in World Expos and Specialised Expos in the best possible way, for the general public as well as for the sponsors. == World Expos == The first World Expos were held in London in 1851, and then in France in 1853. Since 1931, the World Expos have been governed and overseen by BIE (Bureau of International Expositions). BIE is an intergovernmental organization in charge of regulating these global events and ensuring that they are successful. === World Expo 2020 in Dubai === The Expo 2020 will be held in Dubai (United Arab Emirates) from 20 October 2020 until 10 April 2021. The theme of the expo is \u201cConnecting Minds, Creating the future\u201d, which is then divided into three sub-themes: Mobility, Durability, Opportunity. This is the first edition that Cofrex is overseeing as France\u2019s official organizer. With 25 million visits expected by the Expo 2020 organizers, tickets should go on sale in October 2019. ==== France's participation ==== At the unveiling of the Louvre Abu Dhabi which took place on 8 and 9 November 2017, Emmanuel Macron, the President of France, officially announced France\u2019s participation in the Expo 2020 in Dubai. He also revealed that the theme selected for France would be \u201cMobility\u201d, a key topic for French technology and innovation. On 9 November, together with His Highness Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, he attended the signing of the contract for France\u2019s participation to the Expo 2020 by Reem Al Hashimi, the Minister for International Cooperation, and Erik Linquier, the President of Cofrex and France\u2019s Commissioner General for Expo 2020 Dubai. Located in the heart of the Expo 2020 in Dubai South, the French Pavilion Dubai 2020 was designed with a special theme: \u201cLight, Enlightenment\u201d. It is a dual reference to the humanist century (Enlightenment) and also evokes movement (the speed of light): * Light as a philosophy: the light as a tool, which illuminates and reveals and facilitates vision and progress. * Light as a source of warmth and creativity: palpable light that generates warmth and is a source of innovation. * Light as a medium of connectivity: light that connects, transports and transmits data. ==== The French Pavilion official film ==== The French Pavilion official film was produced by Sonia Rolland, artistic director and former Miss France 2000. ==== Pavilion design ==== The architecture, design and architects for the French Pavilion were selected following a public call for tenders in 2018. The Pavilion was officially unveiled on 19 March 2019 during a lecture at the Ministry for Ecological and Inclusive Transition, which was attended by Brune Poirson, Secretary of State to the Minister for Ecological and Inclusive Transition. \u201cThe Expo 2020 Dubai will be an important opportunity to demonstrate that the choices we have made in support of ecological and inclusive transition represent solutions for the future,\u201d said the Secretary of State. The French Pavilion was designed by two architecture firms: Atelier du Prado and Celnikier & Grabli Architectes, and, more specifically, by Jean-Luc Perez from l'Atelier du Prado and Jacob Celnikier and Pascal Grabli from CGA. A scenographer was also appointed to work on the design of the French Pavilion in accordance with the \u201cLight, Enlightenment\u201d theme. The person chosen was Jean-Marie Priol, Artistic Director of the Immersive(s) group. The French Pavilion boasts an impeccable environmental record. Cofrex has presented a sustainable and responsible building, which is 80% self-sufficient in terms of energy. Photovoltaic panels will be installed on the Pavilion to produce solar energy. The French Pavilion can be completely dismantled, and it can therefore be re-used after the Expo 2020. It will also be equipped with a purification microstation. Protecting local biodiversity is also one of the objectives, which takes the form of a garden made up of 15 varieties of endemic plants and trees. \u201cThe French Pavilion aims to showcase the fastest possible mobility there can be, but also to embody the Enlightenment, which has been a symbol of the sharing and spreading of knowledge since the eighteenth century\u201d, stated Erik Linquier, President of Cofrex and France\u2019s Commissioner General for the Expo 2020 Dubai. \u201cIn keeping with the ecological ambition of the One Planet Summit, this pavilion will be the most sustainable ever built,\u201d he said. ==== The construction of the French Pavilion ==== On 2 May, the Minister for Transport, \u00c9lisabeth Borne, unveiled the site where the French Pavilion for the Expo 2020 Dubai was to be established. The following people were also in attendance: Najeeb Al-Ali, Executive Director of the 2020 Exhibition Office, Ludovic Pouille French ambassador to the United Arab Emirates and Jo\u00eblle Garriaud- Maylam, senator representing French citizens living abroad.
