    "text": "The Center for Development and Strategy (CDS) is an environmental and economic American think tank and online publisher based in Buffalo, New York, in the United States. The center develops policy studies, risk briefs, and OpEds on political, economic and environmental issues throughout the world, with a specific focus on issues concerning sustainability, development, and national security. CDS is officially a non-partisan think tank with scholars that represent varying points of view across the political spectrum. ==History== In 2014, CDS was founded as a 'student-run' think tank focused on economic development. At the time, it was the second major international student-run think tank in the world. In 2015, CDS won a first prize in the Best Applied Experience category at the University at Buffalo School of Management's DEAL Expo along with a $750 reward. Since then, CDS has expanded to involve academics and young professionals in government, business, and non-profits. ==Programs== CDS operates three programs that develop sustainability research, thought, and organizations. The think tank's main program, Think Publication, publishes reports written by graduate-level students, academics, and professionals. CDS's Think Together program is a news-style blog that publishes opinion articles. The think tank also runs a virtual business incubator called Think Incubation and has helped start up numerous not-for- profit institutions, including the University of Pennsylvania's Global Impact Collaborative group. ==30 Under 30 Leaders== CDS also publishes a list of 30 young professionals under the age of 30. The awardees were recognized for their achievements in sustainability, development, and human rights. Among the list in 2016 was popular science communicator, Kellie Gerardi. ==Publications== Along with its own set of publications, CDS members publish material in a variety of journals and news outlets. These have included The National Interest, Scientific American, Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, Slate, The Diplomat, The Jerusalem Post, The Times of Israel, War on the Rocks, the Wilson Center's New Security Beat, Journal of Science Policy & Governance, Center for International Relations, GreenBiz, Cornell International Affairs Review, Harvard Kennedy School Review, Inquiries Journal, and West Point's Modern War Institute. *COVID-19, California\u2019s Wildfires, and Reimagining \u201cThe Reserves\u201d (2020) *President Bolsonaro Fiddles While the Brazilian Amazon Goes Up in Smoke (2020) *Understanding the Climate Change-National Security Nexus: The Three Faces of Climate Security (2020) *Is Los Angeles\u2019 Blockage of Critical Resources Justifiable?
