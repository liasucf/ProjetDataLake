Mark Geil of CCM Magazine rated the album four stars out of five, describing the sound as \"bright and modern,\" bemoaning the track length saying \"some of them simply run too long,\" and concluded that the album is a \"strong offering from Jesus Culture, with quality songs of declaration and dependence.\" In a three star review of the collection at Hallels, Timothy Yap states that \"there is not a lack of future church worship songs\" on the album, but criticised it for failing to \"charter new ground,\" concluding that the release, though good, can be \"a tad run-of- the-mill bland too.\" Giving the album a poor two star rating in a Jesus Freak Hideout review, David Craft, who described the album as \"yet another mediocre project,\" and reasoned that it satisfies the listening habits of Jesus Culture fans but advised those in need of new worship songs that \"there are far better alternatives to consider.\" NewReleaseToday music critic Mark Ryan, excitedly indicated in his review that \"Live worship alums should be the only worship albums that are allowed to be released, and Jesus Culture does not disappoint on Living With a Fire. The gang from Sacramento, CA continues to deliver powerful worship that crosses generations and is meant for the whole church.\" Gerod Bass, in his review of the album at Worship Musician Magazine, says that Living With a Fire \"is pretty much what we've come to expect from Jesus Culture as far as songs and arrangements go.\" Bass resolved that fans will \"love this big collection of new songs. There is nothing ground-breaking here, and it seems as if Jesus Culture has kind of adopted the saying \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it.\"\" ===Accolades=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
