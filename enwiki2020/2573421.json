It is about from Budapest. == History == The oldest archeological finds from the J\u00e1szs\u00e1g, the area around J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny, originate from nomadic people of the stone-age and date back 16500 years B.C. Excavations (2002) in J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny and J\u00e1sztelek aiming for traces of the hunter and gatherers of the mesolithic in the northern part of the Great Hungarian Plain by R\u00f3bert Kert\u00e9sz detected distinct indications of settlements. During this period, the climate in the region began to warm up. Thus, the ice-age coniferous forests were gradually replaced by deciduous forests, the eco-system changed and a new fauna was established in the Carpathian basin. Under the pressure of climate change, the formerly nomadic people settled down. Traces from that time indicate that people actively planted common hazel thus establishing an early form of agriculture. Further south from the region, tillage and animal husbandry were already established during the same period. Since the development of agriculture in the Carpathian basin was determining for the development in Europe, this findings represent a mile-stone in archeology. At about 6000 B.C. permanently inhabited settlements were established along the paleo-Zagyva river. Around 2800 B.C., people from further south, commanding bronze-castings began to settle the areas. From that time, settlements in the form of tells are proven. These represent the most northern find of that specific form. Around 400 to 300 B.C. traces of Celtic people coming from the west are found in the J\u00e1szs\u00e1g. Celtic graveyards were found near J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny at Hajta and J\u00e1szj\u00e1kohalma. During the first century A.D. Iatzygic tribes migrated from Sarmatia to the later J\u00e1szs\u00e1g. After being defeated by the Romans during the Marcomannic Wars, the Iazyges paid tribute to Rome and they became a part of the Roman border-defence at the Limes Sarmatiae. Their settlements can be still found during the invasion of the Huns in the 5th century A.D. In the middle of the 6th. century, Eurasian Avars began to settle the J\u00e1sz-region who in turn were pushed away around 895 by the immigrating Hungarians. During the regency of B\u00e9la IV of Hungary in the 13th century, Jasz people (sometimes mistaken for the formerly settling Iazyges), requested permission to settle in the Carpathian basin and were assigned the J\u00e1sz-region. Based on language studies, these people can be traced to Indo- Iranians origins. Their former designation of \u00c1sz changed unter Turkish and Slavic influences to J\u00e1sz. Their settlements ranged from the southern borders of the M\u00e1tra westward to the G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 Hills (Hungarian G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151i-dombs\u00e1g), eastwards almost to the river Tisza and south to the modern-day Szolnok. South of them, the Kipchaks (Hungarian Kun) were settled. In the 15th century, these two regions formed a castle-district with the center at Ber\u00e8ny, which also became county-capital of the J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County until 1876. 1536, the J\u00e1szs\u00e1g was attacked and conquered by Turkish forces. They established a military post at J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny in the remains of the former Franciscan abbey and the 1472 erected church. After the end of the Turkish rule, Leopold I sold the J\u00e1szs\u00e1g to the Teutonic Knights (22. March 1702) and disestablished the privileges of the county. The Teutonic Knights also took J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny as main seat and made it the official capital of the county J\u00e1szkun, consisting out of J\u00e1szs\u00e1g, Kiskuns\u00e1g and Nagkuns\u00e1g. In the general population, the sale was opposed. The region therefore supported Francis II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi in R\u00e1k\u00f3czi's War of Independence but, after defeat, they took to legal means, collected the required sum and bought their own county back. 1745, the re-buy (redemption) was approved by Maria Theresa of Austria who also reestablished the county's privileges. As a consequence of the Hungarian Revolution of 1848, the autonomous administration of the J\u00e1szkun region were abolished again. The three-part region was divided up and parts were assigned to two new counties with the capitals of J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny and J\u00e1sz\u00e1pati. 1860, the region regained its self-administration for the last time only to ultimately lose it 1877. Kiskuns\u00e1g was divided between the Pest and the B\u00e1cs comitat. J\u00e1szs\u00e1g and Nagykuns\u00e1g formed the new comitat of J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok. The new capital of the comitat became Szolnok and J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny lost its former importance. In the 1950s, various industrial firms chose to settle in J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny which had been very much an agricultural community up to this point. This development resulted in an increase in the number and type of jobs available and brought increased prosperity to the inhabitants of J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny. Despite the economic difficulties of recent years, J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny has continued to grow and has been able to invest in the necessary infrastructure. At the same time, more and more firms have chosen J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny as a centre for their operations. However, J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny not only values economic growth but has also developed into a cultural center of national renown. == Industry == J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny was always famous for its refrigerator factory. It is currently owned by Electrolux. Notable companies in the city include J\u00e1sz Plasztik Kft. (plastic products) and Szatm\u00e1ri Kft.. == Transport == J\u00e1szkun Vol\u00e1n operates multiple routes of local buses, mostly between the city centre and the industrial district. The station for long distance buses is located in the city centre, with direct services to Budapest and various other cities. J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny also has a train station further away from the city centre. M\u00c1V operates hourly services on weekdays to Hatvan and Szolnok. ==Politics== The current mayor of J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny is Budai L\u00f3r\u00e1nt. The local Municipal Assembly has 15 members divided into 3 political parties and alliances: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Party ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Seats ! colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:#ccc\" | 2019 Council |- | style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |Fidesz | style=\"text-align: right\" | 7 |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | |style=\"background-color: #FFA500 | | |- | style=\"background- color: #008080 | | Jointly for J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny Association | style=\"text-align: right\" | 7 |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |style=\"background-color: #008080 | |- | style=\"background- color: #52BBE8 | | Mi Haz\u00e1nk | style=\"text-align: right\" | 1 |style=\"background-color: #52BBE8 | | | | | | | |- |} ==International relations== ===Twin towns / Sister cities=== J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny is twinned with: == References == ==External links== * in Hungarian, English, German, Esperanto and Polish * JaszINFO site * J\u00e1szber\u00e9ny on yazd.com *Jaume's head Category:Populated places in J\u00e1sz-Nagykun-Szolnok County Category:J\u00e1szs\u00e1g ",
