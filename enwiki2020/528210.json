    "text": "The Cadbury Report, titled Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, is a report issued by \"The Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance\" chaired by Adrian Cadbury that sets out recommendations on the arrangement of company boards and accounting systems to mitigate corporate governance risks and failures. The report was published in draft version in May 1992. Its revised and final version was issued in December of the same year. The report's recommendations have been used to varying degrees to establish other codes such as those of the OECD, the European Union, the United States, the World Bank etc. ==Background== Sridhar Arcot and Valentina Bruno in their article called \"In Letter but not in Spirit: An Analysis of Corporate Governance in the UK\"Available at the SSRN website explain the background to the Cadbury Committee.
