    "text": "The convertible mark (Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian: , Bosnian/Serbian: ); sign: KM; code: BAM) is the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is divided into 100 ' or ' (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: /; Cyrillic: /), and locally abbreviated KM. == History == The convertible mark was established by the 1995 Dayton Agreement. It replaced the Bosnia and Herzegovina dinar, Croatian kuna and Republika Srpska dinar as the single currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1998. Mark refers to the German mark, the currency to which it was pegged at par. === Etymology === The names derive from the German language. The three official languages of Bosnia and Herzegovina (Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian) have adopted German nouns die Mark and der Pfennig as loanwords marka and pfenig. The Official Gazette of BiH (Bosnian: ), Official newspaper of FBiH (Bosnian: ) and other official documents recognised pfenig or \u043f\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0433 (depending on the script; Bosnian and Serbian use both Latin and Cyrillic on an equal footing, while Croatian uses only Latin) as the name of the subdivision. Banknotes of 50 fenings/pfenigs were in circulation from 1998 to 2000. They were denoted as \"50 KONVERTIBILNIH PFENIGA\" / \"50 \u041a\u041e\u041d\u0412\u0415\u0420\u0422\u0418\u0411\u0418\u041b\u041d\u0418\u0425 \u041f\u0424\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0413\u0410\"; however, the word convertible should never be next to the pfenig because only the mark can be convertible. (See Mistakes for all of the mistakes on banknotes and coins.) Coins of 10, 20 and 50 pfenigs have been in circulation since 1998 (the 5-pfenigs coin was released in 2006). All of them are inscribed \"~ feninga\" / \"~ \u0444\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433\u0430\" on the obverse. Misspelling fening/\u0444\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0433 has never been corrected, and it took that much hold that is now officially adopted and not recognised as an incorrect name. ==== Plurals and cases ==== Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian have a complicated case system. In addition, it is important to note that they use three plural forms. *In combination with numbers 1, 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81, 101, 1001, \u2026 (i.e. ending in 1 but not 11) nouns use the nominative case singular (the base form): ::m\u00e0rka ( _m\u00e0r_ : a \u2013 short vowel, rising tone) and pf\u00e9nig/f\u00e9ning ( _(p)f\u00e9_ : e \u2013 short vowel, rising tone) *In combination with numbers that for rightmost digit have 2, 3 or 4 (except 12, 13 and 14) nouns use the genitive case singular (so called \"the paucal form\"): ::m\u00e0rke ( _m\u00e0r_ : a \u2013 short vowel, rising tone) and pf\u00e9niga/f\u00e9ninga ( _(p)f\u00e9_ : e \u2013 short vowel, rising tone) *In combination with numbers 0, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 100, 1000, 10000 etc. (i.e. ending in 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0, 11, 12, 13 or 14) nouns use the genitive case plural: ::m\u0201r\u0101k\u0101 ( _m\u0201r_ : a \u2013 short vowel, falling tone; vowels \u0101 are not accented but have genitive length) and pf\u00e9n\u012bg\u0101/f\u00e9n\u012bng\u0101 ( _(p)f\u00e9_ : e \u2013 short vowel, rising tone; vowels \u012b and \u0101 are not accented but have genitive length) :(For further information on accents in BSC, see Serbo-Croatian phonology and Shtokavian dialect#Accentuation.) For the pfenig, the plural is pfeniga/feninga with a short unaccented a, whereas the genitive plural is pfeniga/feninga (same) but with a long unaccented i and a. A syllable after an accented syllable whose vowel is pronounced as a long and with a continuous tone (neither rising or falling) is said to have a genitive length (although, word need not to be necessarily in the genitive case in order to have genitive length on its syllable; it can be in locative, too). These matters should be noted when one uses the local names in English. For example, English plural \"ten pfenigas\" / \"ten feningas\" is incorrect as the final a in BSC plural pfeniga/feninga already indicates the plural. So, \"ten pfenigs\" / \"ten fenings\" should be used instead. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) uses \"fenings\" as the English plural. Likewise, \"twenty-one markas\" / \"two markes\" / \"twelve marakas\" is incorrect; \"twenty-one marks\" / \"two marks\" / \"twelve marks\" should be used instead. == Coins == In December 1998, coins were introduced in denominations of 10, 20 and 50 fenings/pfenigs. Coins of 1, 2 and 5 marks were introduced later. The coins were designed by Bosnian designer Kenan ZekicWebsite of Kenan Zekic. Available at: http://kenanzekic.com.ba/ and minted at the Royal Mint in Llantrisant (Wales, UK). {|class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"font-size: 90%\" ! colspan=\"13\"|Coins of the convertible mark (1998\u2013present) |- ! rowspan=\"2\"| Image !!rowspan=\"2\"| Value !!colspan=\"3\"| Technical parameters !!colspan=\"3\"| Description !!colspan=\"4\"| Date of |- !

All current notes are valid throughout the country. The banknotes are issued by the Central Bank of Bosnia Herzegovina, with distinct designs for the entities of Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Republika Srpska,1 except for the largest denomination \u2013 200-mark note. On the notes of the Republika Srpska, inscriptions are printed in Cyrillic, then Latin script, and vice versa. Banknotes, with the exception of the 200-mark note, are printed by the French company Oberthur.Mulic, Josef (2000).

Officially, only one banknote has not been released in circulation because of a mistake, even though other banknotes with mistakes had been issued. === Examples === These are the most important mistakes that have been noticed till now: # 50 fenings/pfenigs banknote in both designs had the adjective \"convertible\" next to the noun \"pfenig\" although only mark can be convertible (\"50 KONVERTIBILNIH PFENIGA\" / \"50 \u041a\u041e\u041d\u0412\u0415\u0420\u0422\u0418\u0411\u0418\u041b\u041d\u0418\u0425 \u041f\u0424\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0413\u0410\"). # 1 KM banknote for Republika Srpska was printed as \"\u0418\u0412\u041e \u0410\u041d\u0414\u0420\u0418\u0402 / IVO ANDRI\u0110\" instead of \"\u0418\u0412\u041e \u0410\u041d\u0414\u0420\u0418\u040b / IVO ANDRI\u0106\". This banknote was immediately removed from circulation. # 5 KM banknote in both designs had the Cyrillic word \"five\" incorrectly printed in Latin script on its reverse side (\"PET \u041a\u041e\u041d\u0412\u0415\u0420\u0422\u0418\u0411\u0418\u041b\u041d\u0418\u0425 \u041c\u0410\u0420\u0410\u041a\u0410\", instead of \"\u041f\u0415\u0422 ...\"). # 10 KM banknote for Republika Srpska (first series, 1998) had Aleksa \u0160anti\u0107's name printed in Latin script although it should have been printed in Cyrillic script as it is on all other examples in 1998 series. # 100 KM banknote in both designs was incorrectly printed with the Cyrillic abbreviation (acronym) of Central bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina with \"\u040f / D\u017e\" instead of \"\u0426 / C\" (i.e. \"\u040f\u0411\u0411\u0425 / D\u017eBBH\" instead of \"\u0426\u0411\u0411\u0425 / CBBH\") in safety bar. # The name of the subdivision of convertible mark found on coins has been incorrectly written, the word \"pfenig\" being written as \"fening\". This mistake took so much hold (especially because there were no (and are no) 50 pfenigs/fenings banknotes in circulation) that \"fening\" is now officially adopted and not recognized as incorrect for the KM's hundredth part. # In 2017, Edin Bujak from Department of archaeology on Faculty of Philosophy in Sarajevo, noticed a mistake on 10 KM banknote for the Federation of B&H.; Picture of ste\u0107ak on reverse side is actually a picture of ste\u0107ak from Kri\u017eevi\u0107i, Olovo, and not from Radimlja necropolis as stated on banknote. Central bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina confirmed this mistake and it will be corrected in future printing of banknotes. ==See also== * Currencies related to the euro * Economy of Bosnia and Herzegovina ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Historical and current banknotes of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Circulating currencies Category:Currencies of Bosnia and Herzegovina Mark, Convertible Category:Fixed exchange rate Category:Currencies introduced in 1998 ",
