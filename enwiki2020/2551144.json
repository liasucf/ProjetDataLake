He was murdered by Idi Amin's regime in 1972. ==Biography== A member of the Baganda ethnic group, Kiwanuka was born in Kisabwa to Kaketo-Namugera (father) and was a member of the Roman Catholic Church. He was admitted to the bar association at Gray's Inn in February 1956. As a result of the September 1961 Uganda Constitutional Conference held in London, Uganda achieved internal self-government on 1 March 1962. Kiwanuka became Uganda's first prime minister in the new National Assembly. New elections, however, were held in April 1962, with Kiwanuka's party losing to the alliance of Milton Obote's Uganda People's Congress and the Buganda traditionalist party, Kabaka Yekka. In addition, Kiwanuka's Catholicism made him unpopular with his fellow Buganda, a mainly Protestant people. Uganda achieved independence on 9 October 1962, with Obote as the first prime minister of a fully independent Uganda. Kiwanuka was imprisoned in 1969 by Obote's government, but was one of 55 political detainees released by Idi Amin immediately after the coup that brought Amin to power.Martin, General Amin, p. 140 Amin appointed him as chief justice of Uganda on 27 June 1971. Kiwanuka soon came into confrontation with Amin's disregard for the rule of law. In the immediate aftermath of Obote's abortive counter coup of 1972, Kiwanuka was arrested at gunpoint by Amin's men as he presided over a session of the High Court.David Martin, General Amin, London: Faber and Faber, 1974, p. 211 As well as countermanding from the bench some of Amin's more draconian orders, Kiwanuka had also secretly agreed to support Obote's return to power, with the proviso that Kiwanuka would be involved in constitutional reform.Martin, General Amin, p. 212 Kiwanuka was killed by Amin's forces on 22 September at Makindye Military Prison in a prolonged execution which, according to eyewitnesses, involved Kiwanuka ears, nose, lips, and arms being severed, a disembowelling, and castration before he was finally immolated. Kiwanuka's death was not acknowledged as an execution, with Amin instead publicly blaming it on Obote's supporters and even launching a police investigation. Kiwanuka's killing was the first of a series directed against leading figures in the Baganda and Ankole tribes, aimed at curbing their power.Martin, General Amin, p. 213 Kiwanuka's grandson, Mathias Kiwanuka, played defensive end for Boston College's American football team from 2001 to 2005 and was the New York Giants' first round pick in the 2006 NFL Draft.Kiwanuka Goes Home, but His Heart Is Far Away == References == Category:1922 births Category:1972 deaths Category:Alumni of University College London Category:Assassinated Ugandan politicians Category:British colonial army soldiers Category:Democratic Party (Uganda) politicians Category:Members of Gray's Inn Category:People murdered in Uganda Category:Prime Ministers of Uganda Category:Ugandan judges Category:Ugandan Roman Catholics Category:20th-century Ugandan lawyers Category:Chief Justices of Uganda ",
