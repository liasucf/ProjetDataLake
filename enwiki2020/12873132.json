The natural habitat is along the Andes Range from 38 to 43\u00b0S, and up to 700 meters (2300 ft) above sea level. It is a very elegant tree with a thick trunk and wide crown and can become over 12 m (40 ft) high.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. Eucryphia cordifolia It blooms in February and March, depending on latitude and altitude. The fruit is a capsule about 1.5 cm (0.6 in) length. == Cultivation and uses == Its flowers contain a highly appreciated aromatic nectar, harvested by introduced European bees and commercialized as \"ulmo honey\" (miel de Ulmo). The wood is light brown to brown, heavy, moderately firm, rather hard and quite resistant to decay. It is used locally for construction and very extensively as firewood. It also grows well in Scotland and has been planted in the North Pacific Coast of the United States. == Chemical composition == Eucryphin, a chromone rhamnoside, can be isolated from the bark of E. cordifolia.Eucryphin, a new chromone rhamnoside from the bark of Eucryphia cordifolia.
