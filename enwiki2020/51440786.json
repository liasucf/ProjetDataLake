They chose Stacy, James C, Brandon, Bianca and Ray J. On Day 4, it was revealed that these housemates would not be eligible to nominate during the first round of nominations but could still be nominated. As well as this, Angie and Jamie were tasked to save four of \"edited out\" housemates from eviction leaving one remaining. As James C remained, he automatically faces the first eviction. As late arrivals into the house Jedward were immune from being nominated this week. *: Shortly after Angie's eviction and arrival of Chloe, Jessica and Kim on Day 11, the housemates voted for who they thought was the most \"dull\", unaware of the fact that whoever receives the most votes will be evicted. Austin received the most votes, and was immediately evicted from the house. *: After Austin's eviction, there was a flash vote on the Big Brother app and website for six housemates that would be sent to Hell. Coleen, Heidi & Spencer, James J, Jasmine, Jedward and Stacy received the most votes and were sent to Hell. On Day 12 and 13 the Hell housemates competed to return to the Main House with Jedward and James J winning back their place, however they had to choose a housemate to replace them (Chloe, Jessica and Kim were exempt as new housemates). They chose James C and Calum respectively. Calum, Coleen and Stacy won their place back in their house and the housemates had to choose to evict Heidi & Spencer, James C or Jasmine. They chose Jasmine. *: These nominations were face-to-face. *: As new arrivals, Chloe, Jessica and Kim were immune from being nominated. *: As part of this week's shopping task, Superheroes were paired up with Sidekicks. Nicola was paired with Jedward, Bianca with Heidi & Spencer, Jamie was with Coleen, Calum with Kim, Chloe with Stacy and James C was paired with Jessica. For end of task nominations the pairs were given a buzzer and thirty seconds to press it. If the sidekick pushed their button and their hero did not, the sidekick would receive immunity and their hero would face eviction, and vice versa. If both pushed their buttons, the first press would count \u2013 and if neither pressed, both would be safe from eviction. *: Housemates voted for a housemate of their choice to be awarded eternal immunity from being nominated. James C received the most votes and therefore was awarded eternal immunity, with this he had to choose a housemate to face the public vote each eviction. He chose Heidi and Spencer. *: Every housemate who received a nomination faced eviction. *: Shortly after Stacy's eviction, the housemates took part in face-to-face nominations with a twist. Each housemate had to pick a card at random. If they picked the \"Joker\" card then they received no power, if they picked \"Nominate\" then they would have to nominate a housemate who was not already saved. If they picked \"Save\" they would have to give immunity to a housemate who had not already been nominated. The two housemates with the fewest votes were evicted in a surprise double eviction. *: The public were voting to win rather than to save. The vote was frozen on Day 29, and Calum was evicted with the fewest votes. The vote reopened for the remaining housemates until the final. Coleen won with 32.65% of the final vote, whilst Jedward were runners-up with 29.91%. Kim was third with 14.52%, James C was fourth with 10.33%, Nicola was fifth with 6.94% and Bianca finished sixth with 4.36%. Calum also received 1.3% of the final vote, however none of these figures take into account the vote freezes between each position. ==Ratings== Official ratings are taken from BARB. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; width: 70%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" |- ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:17%;\"| ! scope=col colspan=5| Official viewers (millions) |- !
