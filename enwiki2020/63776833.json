For his Bachelor's degree, he studied at Kasetsart University, majoring in industrial engineering, and graduated with first-class honors (gold medal).

Currently, he is now taking up his PhD degree in industrial engineering at Chulalongkorn University. == Career == Suppasit began his acting career in the boys' love (BL) Thai series I Am Your King (2017). Prior to shooting I Am Your King, Suppasit was cast in the Thai version of the Australian mock-dating reality show, Take Me Out Thailand. Subsequently, he also participated in the spin-off Take Me Out Reality Thailand, where contestants go on dating activities such as picnic dates, theme parks etc. The following year, Suppasit was cast in his first main role in the BL series, What The Duck: The Series (2018), as \"Pree\". Due to the series' popularity, it was announced that a second season would start filming. What The Duck 2: The Final Call, premiered on March 18, 2019 on LINE TV. In early 2019, it was announced that Suppasit would star as \"Tharn\" - the main protagonist of GMM One's and LINE TV's TharnType: The Series. The series immediately gained popularity within Thailand as well as international audiences. After every episode broadcast, the series would soar to the number one spot of worldwide Twitter trends. The popularity of the series and the main cast, has made fans to refer to both actors as \"MewGulf - a combined fandom name of their Thai nicknames, Mew and Gulf, respectively. Suppasit and fellow actor, Kanawut Traipipattanapong won \"Best Kiss Scene\" at the LINE TV Awards 2020. Suppasit and Kanawut have also appeared in the February issue of Harper's Bazaar Thailand, the first BL couple to do so in the history of the magazine. Due to the immense outpour of fans trying to read the article, Harper's Bazaar Thailand's website crashed. With the positive response to TharnType, a second season was announced and auditions would start in early 2020, with production in mid-2020. Due to the global pandemic of novel COVID-19, production was postponed to ensure the safety of the actors and crew. Both Suppasit and Kanawut made a guest appearance in the 2020 series \"Why R U?\" as Tharn and Type. On May 5th, 2020, a management team was launched under the name Mew Suppasit Studio. They will be in charge of future official appearances regarding Suppasit and his endeavors. With Suppasit's popularity growing, his fan club along with Kanawut's fans, have bought rights to name stars after them. On August 1st, 2020, Suppasit published his first single with the title 'Season of You'. == Filmography == ===Television=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |- ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" |Year ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" |Title ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" |Role ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" |Channel ! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" |Note |- | rowspan = \"5\" align = \"center\" | 2014 | rowspan = \"3\" align = \"center\" | Ban Tuk Kam (\u0e1a\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e36\u0e01\u0e01\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21) | align = \"center\" | Top | rowspan= \"3\" align = \"center\" | Channel 3 | align = \"center\" | EP: La Taem (\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e41\u0e15\u0e49\u0e21) (Collecting point) |- | align = \"center\" | Get | align = \"center\" | EP: Game Na Rok Deead (\u0e40\u0e01\u0e21\u0e19\u0e23\u0e01\u0e40\u0e14\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e14) (Hot hell) |- | align = \"center\" | Max | align = \"center\" | EP: Kwam Lab(Rak)Kong Sup Tar (\u0e04\u0e27\u0e32\u0e21\u0e25\u0e31\u0e1a(\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01)\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e40\u0e0b\u0e40\u0e25\u0e1b) (The secret(love)of super star) |- | Soot Ruk Chun La Moon (\u0e2a\u0e39\u0e15\u0e23\u0e23\u0e31\u0e01\u0e0a\u0e38\u0e25\u0e21\u0e38\u0e19) || Game || ONE 31 || EP:4 Jao Kwang noi (\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e01\u0e27\u0e32\u0e07\u0e19\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e22) (oh!
