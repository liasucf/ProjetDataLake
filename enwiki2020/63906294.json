We are Brothers': History, Brotherhood, and Independence in Kerry Young\u2019s Pao\", Anthurium: A Caribbean Studies Journal, Vol. 11, Issue 2, Article 5. and as described by Stevie Davies in The Guardian, \"Kerry Young's heartfelt, sparky and affecting debut novel is a chronicle of multicultural Jamaica, both in its cultural richness and in its strife and tensions. The first-person narrator, writing in a version of local patois, is of Chinese descent, belonging to a community of Chinese immigrants that began in the mid 19th century and came to be resented by black inhabitants in proportion to its business success. ...Young's is a narrative of confusion and conflict, both in the political world and within the self. ...The complexity of Jamaican society in Pao is fascinating and bewildering.\"Davies, Stevie (23 September 2011), \"Pao by Kerry Young - review | A vivid portrayal of the complexities of Jamaica's violent underworld\", The Guardian. For James Urquhart in The Independent, \"Kerry Young's energetic debut novel is a pacy but absorbing saga of domestic struggle and gangland manoeuvring set against the violent backdrop of postwar Jamaican politics.\"Urquhart, James, \"Pao, By Kerry Young \u2013 The gangster who just wants to be loved\", The Independent. Writing in The Observer Ian Thomson stated that Pao \"confirms Young as a gifted new writer. Her novel is a blindingly good read in parts, both for its mesmeric story-telling and the quality of its prose.\" Young's next two novels were also, like Pao, set in mid-20th-century Jamaica \"against a backdrop of social change and political upheaval, telling three people's interlinked stories of struggle and redemption, love and ambition, race, class, gender and colour in a country at a crossroads.\" Kirkus Reviews characterized Young's second novel, Gloria (2013), as \"Not quite a love story and not quite a feminist bouquet, but a well-seasoned hybrid\"\"Gloria\", Kirkus Reviews, 31 March 2013. and the Northern Echo review concluded: \"Gloria is a brilliant, observant, sometimes complex read, but with clear and simple messages, it speaks to the feminist and equal rights campaigner in all of us.\"Burt, Vicky (29 April 2013), \"Gloria by Kerry Young\", Northern Echo. Gloria was nominated for the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award, shortlisted for the East Midlands Book Award, longlisted for the OCM Bocas Prize for Caribbean Literature.\"Our Judges\", Jhalak Prize. Show Me a Mountain (2016) was summed up by the Historical Novel Society as \"Highly recommended, shocking, complex and riveting historical fiction!\"Crystal, Viviane, \"Show Me A Mountain\" (review), Historical Book Society. As stated on the British Council website: \"Her fiction has been praised for combining family history, deep research and the expressive power of patois. By doing so, it brings the global realities of Chinese identity to life. And she celebrates the underappreciated impact of Chinese culture on the modern Caribbean, making a powerful case for a new understanding of Jamaican urban life.\" She has said that she sees herself as an inheritor of the works of \"other hyphenated Chinese writers such as Maxine Hong Kingston and Han Suyin\",Jacob, Debbie (16 June 2013), \"Putting history in a new light\", Trinidad and Tobago Guardian. and she counts among her other influences William Faulkner, Toni Morrison and Hermann Hesse, also naming: \"My most important philosophical influence, Aristotle.
