    "text": "\"Mars na Drinu\", Stanislav Binicki's original hand-written score, May 26, 1915. The March to the Drina (, ) is a Serbian patriotic march which was composed by Stanislav Bini\u010dki during World War I. Bini\u010dki dedicated it to his favourite commander in the Serbian Army, Col. Milivoje Stojanovi\u0107, who had fought during the Battle of Cer, but was killed later in the Battle of Kolubara. The song experienced widespread popularity during and after the war and came to be seen by Serbs as a symbol of resistance to the Central Powers. Following World War II, it was popular in Socialist Yugoslavia where a single release in 1964 achieved Gold Record status. The march was played at the presentation ceremony for the Nobel Prize in Literature when Yugoslav writer Ivo Andri\u0107 was named a Nobel laureate in 1961. Serbian lyrics to the song were written many decades after Bini\u010dki composed it, by poet and journalist Miloje Popovi\u0107, in 1964 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Cer. English lyrics were added in 1964 by American songwriter Vaughn Horton for a recording by Patti Page under the title Drina (Little Soldier Boy). German lyrics were added by Walter Rothenburg in 1964 and Bert Olden in 1976. Italian lyrics were added in 1964 by Daniele Pace for the recording by Marie Lafor\u00eat. Milutin Popovi\u0107 Zahar added Serbian lyrics to a version entitled \"Svirajte mi Mar\u0161 na Drinu\" in 1989. An eponymous 1964 Yugoslav film was made by the Avala Film studio in Belgrade that featured the march in a historical dramatization of the 1914 Battle of Cer. ==History== ===World War I=== alt=A large stone monument topped by an eagle. The Drina River is an important symbol of Serbian national identity, serving as the boundary between Bosnia and Serbia. By the outbreak of World War I, Bosnia had been under the control of Austria-Hungary since 1878. The Serbian defeat of Austro-Hungarian forces at the Battle of Cer in August 1914 was the first Allied victory over the Central Powers during World War I. Stanislav Bini\u010dki composed what became known as March on the Drina shortly after the battle to commemorate the Serbian victory. He dedicated it to his favourite commander in the army, Pukovnik or Colonel Milivoje Stojanovi\u0107 Brka, who fought at the Battle of Cer but who was killed in a subsequent battle in December. His composition was initially titled March to Victory. Some scholars have hypothesized that Bini\u010dki based his work on an Ottoman Turkish military march. March on the Drina symbolized the desire of Serbs in the Kingdom of Serbia to unite with those living in Bosnia. The song experienced widespread popularity during and after World War I. It was seen as a symbol of Serbian resistance to the Central Powers and became one of the most famous Serbian nationalist songs, as described by author Eric D. Gordy. ===Post-war=== The song was popular in Socialist Yugoslavia during the Josip Broz Tito era after World War II. It was released as a single and other formats on the Zagreb-based Yugoton label in Croatia.Discogs.com. The recording by Ansambl Urosevic was awarded a Zlatna Ploca or Gold Record for their single release on Jugoton. The Communist film studio Avala also released a film in 1964 based on the march which featured the tune. Moreover, at the height of the Yugoslav Communist or Josip Broz Tito era, a journalist published Serbian lyrics to the song in 1964. It was played at the presentation ceremony for the Nobel Prize in Literature when Serbian writer Ivo Andri\u0107 was named a Nobel laureate in 1961. Serbian lyrics to the song were written in 1964 in Socialist Yugoslavia by poet and journalist Miloje Popovi\u0107 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Cer. A Yugoslavian war film based on the events of World War I, also titled March on the Drina, was released the same year. The Socialist Party of Serbia used the song as the soundtrack for an important promotional spot on Serbian television prior to the 1992 Serbian general elections. That year, the song was chosen to be the national anthem of Serbia. The Serbian National Assembly later bypassed the decision, deeming the song too provocative and adopted the royalist anthem Bo\u017ee pravde instead. In 2013, the song was at the centre of a controversy after it was performed by a Serbian choir entertaining the United Nations General Assembly. Vuk Jeremi\u0107, the President of the United Nations General Assembly, Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, and other United Nations officials gave the song a standing ovation. Bosniak organizations responded to the performance by demanding that Jeremi\u0107 be removed from his position as President of the United Nations General Assembly. Jeremi\u0107 stated that \"we [Serbs] are very proud of it [the song] and wanted to share it with the world\". He went on to say that \"regrettable attempts at twisting the meaning of our musical gift offered to the world last Monday are deeply offensive to the Serbian people\". The United Nations later apologized for the ovation and Ban Ki-moon expressed regret that some were offended by the song. ==1964 Serbian lyrics== There were many different lyrics set to the music in several languages, English, German, and Italian, including those written in 1964 in Serbian by the poet and journalist Miloje Popovi\u0107 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Battle of Cer in Communist or Josip Broz Tito era Yugoslavia. Only four verses of Miloje Popovic's 1964 poem were recorded in 1966 by vocalist Ljubivoje Vidosavljevi\u0107 and the Narodni Orkestar \"Carevac\". ==International hit== 1963 release as \"Marchen Til Drina\" by J\u00f8rgen Ingmann as a 45 single in Denmark on Metronome Records, B 1575.
