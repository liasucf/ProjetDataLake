    "text": "\u03b4 Doradus (often Latinised to Delta Doradus, abbreviated to \u03b4 Dor or delta Dor) is a star in the southern constellation of Dorado. Based upon an annual parallax shift of 21.80 mas as seen from Earth, it is located around 150 light years from the Sun. The star is visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of +4.34. This is an A-type main sequence star with a stellar classification of A7 V. The star is spinning rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of 172 km/s. This is giving the star an oblate shape with an equatorial bulge that is 12% larger than the polar radius. Although A-type stars are not expected to harbor a magnetic dynamo needed to power X-ray emission, an X-ray flux of has been detected at these coordinates. This may indicate that the star has an unseen companion. \u03b4 Doradus displays an infrared excess suggesting it may be a Vega-like star with an orbiting debris disk. Currently this star is the Moon's south pole star, which occurs once every 18.6 years. The pole star status changes periodically, because of the precession of the Moon's rotational axis. When \u03b4 Doradus is the pole star, it is better aligned than Earth's Polaris (\u03b1 Ursae Minoris), but much fainter. It is also the south pole star of Jupiter. ==References== ==External links== * http://server6.wikisky.org/starview?object_type=1&object;_id=951&object;_name=%CE%B4+Dor&locale;=EN Category:A-type main-sequence stars Category:Circumstellar disks Category:Southern pole stars Category:Orbit of the Moon Category:Dorado (constellation) Doradus, Delta Category:Durchmusterung objects 039014 027100 2015 ",
