Stanton was educated at Choristers\u2019 School, Salisbury Cathedral before undertaking an organ scholarship at Lancing College, Sussex. He then went to Merton College, Oxford (1909\u20131913) where he was an organ scholar and was awarded M.A., B.Mus. He proceeded to Mus.D. in 1935. Stanton taught at St John\u2019s School, Leatherhead, Surrey (1914\u20131915), St Edward's School, Oxford (1915\u20131924), and Wellington College, Berkshire (1924\u20131937).

He served on several examining boards and was active in a number of musical societies. Stanton was known affectionately to students and colleagues as \u2018WK\u2019. He was a railway enthusiast and a keen philatelist. Stanton composed mostly choral music, including almost 50 hymn tunes and numerous choral anthems, several of which have become standard church choir fare. Two motets for double choir (Sing We Triumphant Hymns Of Praise and The Spacious Firmament On High) are considered notable. He also compiled the Wellington College Hymn Book, was Editor-In-Chief of the BBC Hymn Book, and provided the commentary for Sixty Years Of Cathedral Music 1898\u20131958. Stanton\u2019s father was a schoolmaster and he had a younger brother, Cyril, who was a Special Telegraphist during World War 1 and a self-taught pianist.
