    "text": "Figure 1 from Emma Read's patent for a \"Portable Baby Cage\" A baby cage was a bed in a wire cage suspended from city apartment windows. The \"health cage\", as it was initially called, was invented by Mrs. Robert C Lafferty to provide babies with fresh air and sunshine while living in crowded cities. ==History== In the early 1900s, many open air schools were built as an attempt to combat the widespread rise of tuberculosis. The belief that open air and ventilation were key in fighting the epidemic, inspired the creation of baby cages. Dr. Luther Emmet Holt, In 1906, according to the recommendations of a doctor who insisted for the need of fresh air for babies, Eleanor Roosevelt, a 21 years old young mother, attach at her window of New York a wooden basket with wire grid for the naps of Anna, her first child born the same year; but the neighbourhood, alerted by the continuous screams of the child - the same medical advice that was to leave the child screaming or crying -, threat the mother of alerting the New York Society for prevent of cruelty toward Children. Later on, the spouse of the 32e President of the United States reported how she was shocked by the reaction of the neighbours, while she thought she was a modern mother. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote in her autobiography that in 1908 she had placed her daughter Anna in \"a kind of box with wire on the sides and top\" out of one of her back windows during her morning naps. She writes she did so because fresh air was necessary. In 1922, a patent application about a \"portable baby cage\" has been submitted by Emma Read. This cage was intended to be suspended on the external edge of a window, in which the baby would be placed. The usage of baby cages has known a great popularity in London during the years 1930s. The installation has been created for children who live in cities without gardens. These baby cages are given by the neighbourhood communities, like the Chelsea Baby Club. to every members who don't had a garden. In 1935, the Royal Institute of British Architects dedicated the element as essential to every housing of the middle class, while citing the example of the Chelsea Baby Club initiative. At the beginning of the World War 2, the Battle of Britain led by the Luftwaffe ended the usage of baby cages in all London. But they appeared again from 1953. Ultimately, the sale of baby cages progressively declined through the mid-1900s, possibly due to safety concerns and the rise of urban automobile traffic. ==Design== Although the materials differed, the general design was the same. A mesh cage allowed air and sunlight to pass through while preventing the child from falling out to the street below. Some designs incorporated roofs in order to shield the child from snow, rain, or debris dropped from above. ==References== ==Further reading== * * * * * * * Category:Babycare ",
