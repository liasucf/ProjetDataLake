    "text": "Aconbury Camp is an Iron Age hillfort on Aconbury Hill in Herefordshire, England, about south of Hereford, and near the village of Aconbury. It is a scheduled monument. ==Description== It has a single rampart, with external ditch, enclosing an area of about ; about long west-to-east, and wide. At the south-east and south-west corners there are inturned entrances. The rampart is about above the interior, and up to wide. ===Excavation=== The site was examined between 1948 and 1951; it was found that the ramparts seem to have internal revetments. Many pottery sherds, prehistoric and some Roman, were found. The material suggests occupation similar to that of the nearby hillforts Dinedor Camp and Sutton Walls. ===Later history=== During the English Civil War, the hill was occupied briefly in 1642 by a Royalist army under Lord Herbert; in 1645 it was occupied by a Scots army under the Earl of Leven. ==See also== * Hillforts in Britain ==References== Category:Hill forts in Herefordshire Category:Scheduled Ancient Monuments in Herefordshire Category:Former populated places in Herefordshire ",
