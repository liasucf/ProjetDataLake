The second episode was eventually broadcast on 30 December 2006, which focused on a woman called Louise Holliday, desperate to prove to her closest friend, who has been fighting a serious illness - how much she cares about her. ==Cancellation== The series was cancelled after airing only one episode, as a result of poor ratings - 1.7 million saw the programme in its Saturday night prime time slot. With low ratings, ITV decided to replace the following week's episode, 29 July 2006, with a repeat of outtakes show It'll Be Alright on the Night. == See also == *List of television series canceled after one episode == External links == * *BBC article on the shows cancellation *Article on the programme from The Stage Category:2006 British television series debuts Category:2006 British television series endings Category:ITV (TV network) original programming Category:British game shows Category:2000s British game shows Category:2000s British television miniseries Category:English-language television shows ",
