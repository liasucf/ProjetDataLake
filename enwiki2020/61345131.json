    "text": "The Kissing Booth 2 is a 2020 American teen romantic comedy film directed by Vince Marcello, from a screenplay by Marcello and Jay Arnold. The film is a direct sequel to the 2018 film The Kissing Booth. Based on The Kissing Booth books by Beth Reekles, the film stars Joey King, Joel Courtney and Jacob Elordi. The film was released on July 24, 2020, by Netflix. Like its predecessor, the film received generally negative reviews from critics. A third installment is scheduled to be released in 2021. ==Plot== The film starts with Elle narrating her time with Noah before he leaves for Harvard. Her senior year starts with her classmates gossiping how she and Noah will eventually break up, making her fear as Noah has befriended an attractive girl named Chloe as she checks his Instagram. Elle and Lee are planning the kissing booth again for the Charity Fair, while Lee is trying to convince Elle to have Marco Pe\u00f1a, the attractive new transfer student to be one of the kissers. Elle beats Marco on the dancing game forcing him to participate in the booth. Noah suggests Elle apply to Harvard, which clashes with her plans to study at University of California, Berkeley with Lee (where their moms met and became friends). Elle does it without telling Lee. Elle visits Noah in Boston, meeting his new friends and Chloe, making her more insecure. She finds an earring below Noah's bed making her angry and confronting Noah, who assures her nothing has happened between him and Chloe and asking her to trust him. Elle talks with her father about college tuition and learns money is a problem, and is willing to participate with Lee on a dance competition with a cash reward for the first place. Lee has an accident on one of their practice sessions (later revealed to be fake) and proposes Marco to become her dance partner, which she isn't too happy to accept but eventually does. As Marco and Elle start passing time together they grow closer, and an attraction between them initiates. Unbeknownst to Elle, Lee's relationship with Rachel is having problems, as Elle is going everywhere with them and not letting them have their time as a couple. After leaving Rachel waiting at the movies she asks Lee to talk with Elle, promising he will but never does. The Halloween Dance arrives, and Lee forgets to tell Rachel that they changed costumes (Rachel was a marshmallow while Lee and Elle were going to be crackers making a smore) upsetting her even more. Elle shares a dance with Marco, almost kissing him but stops when listening to the OMG girls gossiping about her. The day of the competition Lee finds on his car trunk Elle's applications to Harvard, angering him. Elle and Marco excel at their performance and she kisses him at the end of their dance, not knowing Noah was in the crowd causing him to walk away. Elle wants to go after him in the moment her and Marco are announced the winners. Thanksgiving dinner happens at the Flynn's residence, where Noah arrives with Chloe, upsetting Elle who is confronted by Lee for not telling him about her application to Harvard and Rachel being upset with her as well. During the dinner, Rachel discovers Lee never spoke with Elle and leaves the dinner. Lee catches up with her and Rachel breaks up with him. Elle tries to convince Rachel to reconcile with Lee but is unsuccessful. She also gives back the earring to Chloe, who confirms it belongs to her. She reveals to Noah in a bar that one night she slept in Noah's room when he was out and lost it. The day of the carnival arrives, and both Lee and Rachel reconcile after being blindfolded and kissing each other at the kissing booth. Elle is also blindfolded and is approached by Marco, who wants to talk with her about their feelings. Elle admits to Marco there is an attraction between them, but tells him she loves Noah and goes looking for him at the airport. Chloe tells her that he went to look for her, Elle finds him in the shelter park where they first kissed. Noah confesses to being embarrassed that he wasn't doing well at Harvard as he initially thought. He also wants a relationship with Chloe in the same way Elle has with Lee. Elle and Noah reunite. 6-7 months later, Noah returns and Elle, Lee, and Rachel graduate. Lee shares with Elle that he was accepted at Berkeley and asks if she received a response which she answers she was waitlisted at both Berkeley and Harvard. Marco looks from afar at Elle, his friend notices it and answers she's not worth it. Marco decides that she is still worth it. When Elle opens both envelopes in her room it turns out she was accepted in both universities, which will force her to make a decision: go to Harvard with Noah or Berkeley with Lee. ==Cast== * Joey King as Elle Evans * Joel Courtney as Lee Flynn * Jacob Elordi as Noah Flynn * Maisie Richardson- Sellers as Chloe Winthrop * Taylor Zakhar Perez as Marco Valentin Pe\u00f1a * Molly Ringwald as Sara Flynn * Meganne Young as Rachel * Stephen Jennings as Mike Evans * Morn\u00e9 Visser as Mr. Flynn * Bianca Bosch as Olivia * Zandile Madliwa as Gwyneth * Camilla Wolfson as Mia * Carson White as Brad Evans ==Production== In February 2019, it was announced Joey King, Joel Courtney and Jacob Elordi would reprise their roles, with Vince Marcello directing from a screenplay he wrote alongside Jay Arnold, with Netflix distributing.

IndieWire's Kate Erbland gave it a grade C+, and wrote: \"While it offers some necessary growth for all of its characters, The Kissing Booth 2 can never resist looking and acting like dozens of other offerings of its genre ilk, unable to grow beyond basic complications and done-to-death dramas. And yet there are hints that its evolution has a few more tricks left to employ, its winking conclusion only one of them.\" == Sequel == Upon the release of the second film, it was revealed the third had been shot back-to-back with it, and is scheduled for a 2021 release. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2020 films Category:2020s coming-of-age films Category:2020s romantic comedy-drama films Category:2020s teen comedy-drama films Category:American coming-of-age comedy- drama films Category:American films Category:American romantic comedy-drama films Category:American sequel films Category:American teen comedy-drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on British novels Category:Films based on young adult literature Category:Films shot in South Africa Category:English-language Netflix original films ",
