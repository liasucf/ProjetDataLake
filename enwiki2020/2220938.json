From 1981 to 2009, Drillers Stadium was home to the Tulsa Drillers, of the Double-A Texas League. For a number of years Drillers Stadium also hosted one of the regular season baseball games played between Oklahoma State University and the University of Oklahoma in the Bedlam Series. Drillers Stadium is located on the southwest corner of Yale Avenue and 15th Street, in the Tulsa State Fairgrounds complex that also includes Expo Square Pavilion, the QuikTrip Center and Golden Driller, a racetrack, a waterpark, and the sites of the former Bell's Amusement Park and of Oiler Park, where Tulsa's professional baseball teams had played since 1934. ==Baseball== After the Tulsa Oilers, a Triple-A team, left Tulsa in 1976 due to the continuing deterioration of Oiler Park, followed by the partial collapse of the Oiler Park grandstand during a 1977 exhibition game, Tulsa County's long-delayed efforts to build a new stadium were accelerated. The new 8,000 seat stadium was completed in 1981 and named Robert B. Sutton Stadium, in honor of its chief benefactor, a local oil executive. However, Sutton was convicted in 1982 on obstruction of justice charges, and the ballpark was renamed Tulsa County Stadium.\"Tycoon who helped fund Drillers Stadium dies\", Tulsa World, July 7, 2009. The stadium received the name Drillers Stadium in 1989. The stadium eventually seated 10,997, making it the largest stadium in Double-A baseball.Barry Lewis, \"Biggest may not be best for Drillers: Tulsa may join trend of teams that are moving to smaller parks\", Tulsa World, September 3, 2006 .

The University of Tulsa conducted a formal study in 2009 to consider whether the school might use the empty stadium to restore its baseball program, which had been terminated in 1980; but the university concluded that the financial demands of adding a new sport were more than it could accept.John Klein, \"Space Available\", Tulsa World, June 29, 2009 (pay site).

The stadium was to be replaced by a multimillion-dollar indoor BMX arena, but those plans hit a snag in mid-2017 when a disagreement over soft drink \"pouring rights\" derailed the negotiations and saw the BMX project move to an alternate location on a parcel of city-owned industrial property, northwest of downtown.http://www.bmxnews.com/2017/06/coca-cola-pour-rights-take-fizz-out- of-usa-bmx-expo-square-plan/ As of March 2019 the stadium and the adjacent offices have been demolished leaving nothing of the former stadium remaining. ==References== ==External links== * Drillers Stadium * Ballpark Reviews * Drillers Stadium Views - Ball Parks of the Minor Leagues * \"City breaks ground on downtown ballpark,\" Tulsa World, December 19, 2008. * Barry Lewis, \"Best moments at Drillers Stadium\", Tulsa World, September 6, 2009. * ONEOK Field official website * Tulsa Voters Clear Path for USA BMX Epicenter BMX News, April 6, 2016 Category:Baseball venues in Oklahoma Category:Multi-purpose stadiums in the United States Category:Sports venues in Tulsa, Oklahoma Category:Sports venues completed in 1981 Category:NAIA World Series venues Category:Soccer venues in Oklahoma Category:National Premier Soccer League stadiums Category:1981 establishments in Oklahoma Category:Tulsa State Fair ",
