    "text": "\"Hold Your Piece\" is the 13th episode of the seventh season of Pretty Little Liars, an American mystery drama television series based on the novel series written by Sara Shepard, and is the 153rd episode of the series. The episode, directed by Marta Cunningham and written by Bryan M. Holdman, originally aired on May 2, 2017 on the cable network Freeform. The episode yielded 0.86 million viewers, a decrease from the previous episode, and garnered a 0.4 rating in the 18-49 demographic. In the episode, it's Hanna's turn to play the Liar's Lament board game, and \"A.D.\" handles her a task which can bring down her entire career. Meanwhile, Aria and Emily investigate on Sydney, and Spencer goes out with Det. Furey in order to fresh up her mind. == Plot == In Hanna's (Ashley Benson) turn to play the Liar's Lament board game, \"A.D.\" hands her the task of wearing a discriminatory Oriental-themed dress during her meeting with Lucas' (Brendan Robinson) bosses. However, Caleb (Tyler Blackburn) tries to invade the board and a poisonous gas is released from the board. With this, Hanna's reunion is interrupted right in the beginning when she is warned about what happened to him. Ultimately, \"A.D.\" calls Hanna a loser and doesn't give her her piece of the puzzle. Spencer (Troian Bellisario) is invited by Detective Furey (Nicholas Gonzalez) to visit an educational centre he visited as a child. There, they kiss and Furey makes a bandage on Spencer's wound, remnants of the shooting. Aria (Lucy Hale) and Emily (Shay Mitchell) investigate on Sydney's (Chloe Bridges) strange behaviour using Aria's recent skills of hacking, which were taught to her by Caleb. Sydney reveals to the girls that she allegedly no longer play on Jenna's game, and that Jenna has become someone truly dangerous. However, the girls follow her and discover that she was visiting a clinic for the blind to make a donation for a surgery for Jenna. When asked when name she wants it under, she signs as \"A.D.\", supposedly for \"Anonymous Donor\". The girls freak out and Aria reaches Sydney's phone messages. She receives a message from a blocked number, questioning if she had done it, and she confirms. Aria and Emily follow her and confront her, demanding answers. Sydney claims \"Anonymous Donor\" is merely a client at her bank who wishes to remain anonymous, but Aria and Emily aren't convinced and place a tracker in her bag. Toby (Keegan Allen) and Yvonne (Kara Royster) finally ring up after Yvonne wakes up from the coma; however, during a moment of familiar planning, Yvonne drops the flower bouquet she was holding, passing away subsequently. Spencer returns from the outing and encounters a grave Toby crying, as she understands that Yvonne's dead. When Aria arrives home, she discovers Nicole (Rebecca Breeds) is back in Rosewood and is living in Ezra's apartment. == Production == The 153rd episode of the show overall, \"Hold Your Piece\" was directed by Marta Cunningham and written by executive producer Bryan M.
