They were led by head coach Bruce Barnum and played their home games at Providence Park, with one home game at Hillsboro Stadium. They were a member of the Big Sky Conference. They finished the season 9\u20133, 6\u20132 in Big Sky play to finish in a tie for second place. They received an at-large bid to the FCS Playoffs where they lost in the second round to Northern Iowa. On October 10, 2015, the Vikings beat North Texas, 66\u20137. The 59 point margin was the largest margin of victory by an FCS team over an FBS team since the split of NCAA Division I football in 1978 into the groupings now known as FBS and FCS. Portland State also became the first FCS team to defeat two FBS teams in the same season since North Dakota State in 2007. ==Schedule== ==Game summaries== ===at Washington State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" !
