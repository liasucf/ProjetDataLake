    "text": "Georgia O'Keeffe made a number of Red Canna paintings of the canna lily plant, first in watercolor, such as a red canna flower bouquet painted in 1915, but primarily abstract paintings of close-up images in oil. O'Keeffe said that she made the paintings to reflect the way she herself saw flowers, although others have called her depictions erotic, and compared them to female genitalia. O'Keeffe said they had misconstrued her intentions for doing her flower paintings: \"Well \u2013 I made you take time to look at what I saw and when you took time to really notice my flower you hung all your own associations with flowers on my flower and you write about my flower as if I think and see what you think and see of the flower \u2013 and I don't.\" O'Keeffe was not unaware of the sexual references in her work, but male art critics' misinterpretations of these references perpetuated a sexual understanding of her work that was very different from her original intention. She expressed herself through the use of vibrant colors like red, yellow, and orange. ==Overview== A gardener, O'Keeffe was often inspired to make a dozen or more paintings of a specific flower. She became interested in brilliant colors and billowy petals of the canna lilies when she visited Lake George, New York in 1918 with Alfred Stieglitz. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts states that \"In these extreme close-ups she established a new kind of modern still life with no references to atmospheric effects or realistic details, reflecting her statement, 'I paint because color is significant.'\" As she evolved as an artist, her works became suggestive of female form, like Inside Red Canna. Paul Rosenfeld, who owned one of her Red Canna paintings, said \"... there is no stroke laid by her brush, whatever it is she may paint, that is not curiously, arrestingly female in quality. Essence of very womanhood permeates her pictures.\" ==Red Canna (1915) watercolor== Georgia O'Keeffe, Red Canna, 1915, Yale University Art Gallery In 1915, O'Keeffe painted a watercolor of a bouquet of red canna blossoms on paper. The work, , is among the collection of the Yale University Art Gallery. ==Small Red Canna (1919)== A small painting of a close-up of a red canna lily was made by O'Keefe in 1919. The oil painting depicts the flower against a dark cloudy background. Owned by a private collector, it is on extended loan to the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum.

The carefully blended colors and voluptuous curves reflect her emerging personal style.

In the 1920s it was believed to be among the collection of Flora Stieglitz Strauss and possibly that of O'Keeffe in 1953. It was in private collections until 1993, when it was acquired by Sotheby's in New York. It was last recorded to be in the private collection of A.
