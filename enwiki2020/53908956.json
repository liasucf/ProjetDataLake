In his early career, Hartford occasionally filled in for Albert Lee at Everly Brothers performances. He also performed with the re-formed Amazing Rhythm Aces. In the mid-90s, Hartford was signed by Asylum Records and recorded an album with producer Pete Anderson. This album was never released. In 1997, Paladin Records released Hartford's album What About Yes. He was assisted by Pat McLaughlin (guitar), Jeff \"Stick\" Davis (bass), and Jim Lauderdale. Hartford paid homage to his father by recording an album with him (Hartford & Hartford) and recorded an album of John's songs (Part Of Your History: The Songs Of John Hartford). The Jamie Hartford Band includes Ray Flacke (guitar), Rick Lonow (drums), Paco Ship (harmonica), and Charlie Chadwick (bass). The late singer-songwriter Guy Clark, who built 19th- century-style flamenco guitars, made a gift of one to Hartford. == Discography == ===Solo albums=== * 1997: What About Yes (Paladin) * 2005: Part Of Your History The Songs Of John Hartford (New Sheriff) ===With the Jamie Hartford Band=== * 2000: Live (Wildwood) * 2004: Stuff That Works (Earwave) ===With John Hartford=== * 1991: Hartford & Hartford (Flying Fish) ===As guest musician=== * 1991: Johnny Cash - The Mystery of Life (Mercury) * 1996: Laura Boosinger - Sing It Yourself!
