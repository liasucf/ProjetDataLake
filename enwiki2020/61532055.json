One of the pools is designed to contain of water. The pools will contain 12 telescopes to capture high-energy photons. Cherenkov radiation detectors are used. Research teams from Australia and Thailand will participate in the project directly, with others expressing interest.Chinese scientists' pursuit of cosmic rays opens windows on universe, [SpaceDaily.com], 2019-10-24 == References == Category:Cosmic-ray telescopes Category:Astronomical observatories in China ",
