Papal Letter to Christian II of Denmark, 21 April 1518 (Royal Archives) The term \"chancery hand\" can refer to either of two distinct styles of historical handwriting. A chancery hand was at first a form of handwriting for business transactions that developed in the Lateran chancery (the ) of the 13th century, then spread to France, notably through the Avignon Papacy, and to England after 1350.Fisher, John, Malcolm Richardson, and Jane L. Fisher, An Anthology of Chancery English, 3 This early \"chancery hand\" is a form of blackletter. Versions of it were adopted by royal and ducal chanceries, which were often staffed by clerics who had taken minor orders. A later cursive \"chancery hand\", also developed in the Vatican but based on humanist minuscule (itself based on Carolingian minuscule), was introduced in the 1420s by Niccol\u00f2 Niccoli; it was the manuscript origin of the typefaces we recognize as italic. ==English chancery hand== In medieval England each of the royal departments tended to develop its own characteristic hand: the chancery hand used in the royal chancery at Westminster from the mid-century was employed for writs, enrolments, patents, and engrossing of royal letters; its use continued for the enrollment of acts of Parliament until 1836.*UK National Archives, \"Palaeography\" The English chancery hand was already an arcane speciality by the time of the Restoration. Samuel Pepys recorded (Thursday 12 July 1660): ==Cursive chancery hand== The later (\"cursive chancery hand\"), often called \"Chancery Cursive\", developed from Humanist minuscule, itself the progeny of Carolingian minuscule, in the mid-15th century as \"a cursive form of the humanistic minuscule\". In England and France at the time it was known as Italic. In English it is often changed in spelling to . The Italian scribe Ludovico Vicentino degli Arrighi's 1522 influential pamphlet on handwriting called was the first book on writing the italic script known as cursive chancery hand. He was a scribe in the Papal Curia, which had refined cursive chancery hand in its infancy during the latter half of the 15th century. While considered a cursive, this \"papal hand\" was \"strongly disciplined in form, regular in movement and slightly, if at all, inclined from the perpendicular.\" In cursive chancery hand the pen was held slanted at a 45\u00b0 angle for speed, but it could also produce beautiful calligraphic writing. In 15th-century Italy the cursive chancery hand was employed in correspondence, everyday business, and documents of minor formal importance. It was adapted as the model for the italic typeface developed by Aldus Manutius in Venice, from punches cut by Francesco Griffo and first used in 1500 for the small portable series of inexpensive classics that issued from the Aldine press. In 16th-century England it became known as the \"Italian hand\" to distinguish it from the angular, cramped, Blackletter-derived English chancery hand which had been developed earlier and independently. ==See also== *Asemic writing *Bastarda *Blackletter *Wilfrid Jasper Walter Blunt *Book hand *Calligraphy *Court hand (also known as common law hand, Anglicana, cursiva antiquior, or charter hand) *Cursive *Hand (writing style) *Handwriting *History of writing *Italic script *Law hand *Palaeography *Penmanship *Ronde script (calligraphy) *Rotunda (script) *Round hand *Secretary hand *Zapfino, a digital typeface that simulates an italic chancery hand, designed by Hermann Zapf ==Citations== ==References== *Medieval writing: 15th century English chancery hand *Medieval writing: 16th century English chancery hand *Palaeography: Historical Notes *A.
