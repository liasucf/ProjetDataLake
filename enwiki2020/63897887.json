He is currently a candidate for sainthood, which would make him the first person from Brooklyn to be made a canonized Saint by the Roman Catholic Church. ==Biography== Bernard J. Quinn was born in Newark, New Jersey, to poor Irish immigrants, Bernard and Sarah Quinn. He entered St. John's Seminary in 1906. He was ordained on June 12, 1912 and was temporarily assigned to several different churches. He served as a chaplain in the 333rd Machine Gun Infantry Regiment during World War I, and he was gassed in France. Following the war, he resumed his pastoral duties in Brooklyn. In 1922, Quinn established the first church for Black Catholics in Brooklyn, which he had consecrated to St. Peter Claver, which is still in operation and counts among its graduates of its parochial school the civil rights activist and singer Lena Horne. In 1928, he established the diocese's first orphanage for black children Wading River. His humanitarian work was met with opposition with some groups and individuals. In 1929, Monsignor John L. Belford had written openly in his newsletter against the growing number of African-Americans in the Catholic Church, which was met with strong disagreement from Quinn. Quinn responded, \"No church can exclude anyone and still keep its Christian ideals.\" The Little Flower House of Providence was burned twice in one year by the Ku Klux Klan, which prompted Quinn to rebuild once again but this time out of more fireproof material, according to a 1929 article in The Brooklyn Daily Eagle with the headline: \u201cNew Fireproof Orphanage Will Defy Incendiary.\u201d The Little Flower House of Providence has become the base of operations for the Little Flower Children and Family Services of New York, which continues to provide services such as care for adults with developmental disabilities, for those in Brooklyn, Queens, and Long Island. Quinn included music as part of his ministry. Hundreds of black children joined the church choir, including singers Lena Horne and Pearl Bailey. In April 1940, he was admitted to St. Mary's Hospital for surgery to treat an abdominal problem. He died on April 7, 1940. ==References== Category:1888 births Category:1940 deaths Category:Clergy from Newark, New Jersey Category:American Roman Catholic priests ",
