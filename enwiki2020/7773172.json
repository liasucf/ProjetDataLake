It gave universal recognition to the Dominican Order.Pierre Mandonnet, M.-H. Vicaire, Saint Dominique: l'id\u00e9e, l'homme et l'oeuvre (Paris: Descl\u00e9e de Brouwer, 1938) vol. 1 pp. 54-59. The Order already had monasteries in Rome, Paris and Boulogne and had already been locally recognized by the bishop of Toulouse the year before - its creation had coincided with the Albigensian Crusade in southern France, in whose support the Dominicans had been very active. It adopted the rule of St Augustine, but was also regulated by rulings and decisions taken by regular general chapters. ==See also== *Nos attendentes ==References== Category:Dominican Order Category:1216 works Category:13th-century papal bulls Category:Documents of Pope Honorius III ",
