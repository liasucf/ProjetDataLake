    "text": "\"Hot Girl Bummer\" (stylized in lowercase) is a song by American recording artist Blackbear, released as a single through Beartrap on August 23, 2019, as the lead single from his fifth studio album Everything Means Nothing. It reached number 11 on the US Billboard Hot 100, the top forty in nineteen additional countries, and the top ten in six additional countries. ==Song title== Although the title was considered a play on Megan Thee Stallion's song \"Hot Girl Summer\", Blackbear claimed that it was not a parody and was instead a reference to the \"caption trend\" of using the hashtag \"#hotgirlsummer\". ==Music videos== Two music videos were released for the song, blackbear - hot girl bummer [Low Budget Video] and blackbear - hot girl bummer [big budget music video]. Blackbear released the first music video on August 23, 2019, with the same day as the song's release. The music video consists of Blackbear surrounded by people at a party while sitting on a white couch, as well as being attached to strings and being moved in a puppet like manner by a man in a suit, which was called a \"comment on people who are fake on social media\". The second music video was released on November 21, 2019, and features Blackbear appearing to be sitting on a skyscraper, on a couch, and dancing in a cage. ==Commercial performance == \"Hot Girl Bummer\" is Blackbear's second top 40 hit (as well as his third certified single), reaching number 11 in March 2020. It is also his highest charting record to date, surpassing the number 40 peak of \"Do Re Mi\".https://www.billboard.com/music/blackbear/chart- history ==Composition and remix== The song contains a spoken line by Will Forte in Tim and Eric's Billion Dollar Moviehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtrtcttu-Hc. On December 12, 2019, the song's remix was released along with Argentine rapper Khea. ==Personnel== *Blackbear \u2013 lead artist, producer, songwriter *Andrew Goldstein \u2013 producer, songwriter *Alex Ghenea \u2013 mixer ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019\u20132020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Denmark (Tracklisten) | 19 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Estonia (Eesti Ekspress) | 29 |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| France (SNEP) | 131 |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 7 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Lithuania (AGATA) | 11 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Malaysia (RIM) | 17 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Norway (VG-lista) | 8 |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Singapore (RIAS) | 11 |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 20 |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia (ARIA) | 92 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Latvia (LAIPA) | 56 |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Hot R&B;/Hip-Hop Songs (Billboard) | 96 |} ==Certifications== ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| |- ! scope=\"row\"| Various | August 23, 2019 | | rowspan=\"3\"| Interscope | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\"| United States | rowspan=\"2\"| October 22, 2019 | Rhythmic contemporary | |- | Top 40 radio | |} ==References== Category:2019 singles Category:2019 songs Category:Blackbear (musician) songs Category:Interscope Records singles Category:Songs written by Andrew Goldstein (musician) Category:Songs written by Blackbear (musician) ",
