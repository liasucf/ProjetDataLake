    "text": "Starrcade is a recurring professional wrestling event, originally broadcast via closed-circuit television and eventually broadcast via pay-per-view television, held from 1983 to 2000 by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) and later World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Starrcade was regarded by the NWA and WCW as their flagship event of the year, much in the same vein that its rival, the World Wrestling Federation, regarded WrestleMania. As a result, the buildup to each Starrcade featured the largest feuds of the promotion. From 1983 to 1987, Starrcade was produced by Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP), the dominant promotion of the NWA, and aired on Thanksgiving Day. In 1987, the WWF scheduled a pay-per-view of their own, Survivor Series, on Thanksgiving night and demanded exclusivity from cable providers on carriage of the event. In order to prevent such a problem, Starrcade was moved to December the following year and the show was held around Christmas Day, mostly in the days following, beginning in 1988. Also in 1988, JCP was sold to Turner Broadcasting due to financial problems and became WCW, though Starrcade was held under the NWA banner until 1990. From the 1960s to the 1980s, it was tradition for JCP to hold major professional wrestling events on Thanksgiving and Christmas, mostly at Greensboro Coliseum. In 1983, JCP created Starrcade as their supercard to continue the Thanksgiving tradition, and spread it across its territory on closed-circuit television. It popularized broadcasting on closed-circuit television and was financially successful. From 1987, Starrcade was broadcast on pay-per-view, the first NWA event to do so. Starrcade was held for the final time as a WCW event in 2000: the promotion would be acquired by the World Wrestling Federation in 2001, and the brand would become dormant. In 2017, WWE revived the Starrcade brand for a SmackDown-branded non-televised house show on November 25, 2017. The following year, Starrcade began to be held as a WWE Network special. ==Dates, venues, and main events== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin: 0 auto\" |style=\"background:#BBF; width:2em\"| |SmackDown-branded event |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"align: center\" width=100% !Event !Date !City !Venue !class=\"unsortable\"|Main event |- !colspan=6| |- | |November 24, 1983 |Greensboro, North Carolina |Greensboro Coliseum | |- | |November 22, 1984 |Greensboro, North Carolina |Greensboro Coliseum | |- |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|November 28, 1985 |Greensboro, North Carolina |Greensboro Coliseum |rowspan=2| |- |Atlanta, Georgia |The Omni |- |rowspan=2| |rowspan=2|November 27, 1986 |Greensboro, North Carolina |Greensboro Coliseum |rowspan=2| |- |Atlanta, Georgia |The Omni |- | |November 26, 1987 |Chicago, Illinois |UIC Pavilion | |- !colspan=6| |- | |December 26, 1988 |Norfolk, Virginia |Norfolk Scope | |- | |December 13, 1989 |Atlanta, Georgia |The Omni | |- | |December 16, 1990 |St. Louis, Missouri |Kiel Auditorium | |- !colspan=6| |- | |December 29, 1991 |Norfolk, Virginia |Norfolk Scope | |- | |December 28, 1992 |Atlanta, Georgia |The Omni | |- | |December 27, 1993 |Charlotte, North Carolina |Independence Arena | |- | |December 27, 1994 |Nashville, Tennessee |Nashville Municipal Auditorium | |- | |December 27, 1995 |Nashville, Tennessee |Nashville Municipal Auditorium | |- | |December 29, 1996 |Nashville, Tennessee |Nashville Municipal Auditorium | |- | |December 28, 1997 |Washington, D.C. |MCI Center | |- | |December 27, 1998 |Washington, D.C. |MCI Center | |- | |December 19, 1999 |Washington, D.C. |MCI Center | |- | |December 17, 2000 |Washington, D.C. |MCI Center | |- !colspan=6| |- |-style=\"background: #BBF;\" | |November 25, 2017 |Greensboro, North Carolina |Greensboro Coliseum | |- | |November 24, 2018 |Cincinnati, Ohio |U.S. Bank Arena | |- | |December 1, 2019 |Duluth, Georgia |Infinite Energy Center | |- |colspan=\"6\"| |- |} ==2017== The 2017 Starrcade was a professional wrestling special house show event promoted by WWE for the SmackDown brand division.
