    "text": "Capon Oak TreeThe Capon Oak Tree is one of the last surviving trees of the ancient Jedforest, close to Jed Water, a small river which has cut a course below soft sandstone cliffs. It is located south of Jedburgh, Scotland, west of the A68. The Capon Tree is held together with concrete, bricks and timber beams supporting its trunk and branches due to a massive split down the middle of the trunk. The tree continues to grow. Trees are being replanted in the Borders to establish a renewal of the ancient 'Caledon Wood,' or great northern forest, which included Ettrick Forest and Jedforest. ==See also== * List of Great British Trees ==References== ==External links== *Recorded information about the Capon Oak on the Ancient Tree Hunt *Jedburgh *SNH Category:Individual oak trees Category:Individual trees in Scotland Category:Jedburgh ",
