It is within the local government area of City of Melville, and the electoral district of Willagee, which takes its name from the suburb. == History == Willagee is named after Willagee Swamp, the Noongar name of a now-reclaimed feature in the area. The suburb originally comprised a housing estate known as \"Willagee Park\", created by the State Housing Commission. Willagee was brought into existence \"primarily to provide accommodation for employees in the new industrial area being developed by the Fremantle City Council.\" Surveying and clearing of the land had commenced in December 1950, with a number of \"first-class roads\" constructed by the Melville Roads Board in 1951. A number of dwellings were prefabricated homes imported from Austria.New Suburb In Making For 1,300 Homes \u2013 The West Australian. Published 22 April 1952. Retrieved from Trove, 23 November 2011. The suburb is now characterised by demountable, wooden cottages with stilts(spears), although it is in the midst of a sweeping redevelopment plan, which is supposed to improve the quality of the housing.
