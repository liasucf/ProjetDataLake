    "text": "The United States Senate elections of 1880 and 1881 were elections that coincided with the presidential election of 1880, and had the Democratic Party lose five seats in the United States Senate. The newly elected Readjuster senator caucused with the Republicans, and the Republican Vice President's tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the slightest majority. All of that changed September 19, 1881 when the Vice President ascended to the Presidency and the Senate became evenly-divided. As these elections were prior to ratification of the seventeenth amendment, Senators were chosen by state legislatures. == Results summary == Senate Party Division, 47th Congress (1881\u20131883) * Majority Party: Republican (37) * Minority Party: Democratic (37) * Other Parties: Independent (1); Readjuster (1) * Total Seats: 76 == Change in Senate composition == === Before the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | | D8 | | D7 | | D6 | | D5 | | D4 | | D3 | | D2 | | D1 | colspan=2 | |- | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D13 | width=50px | D14 | width=50px | D15 | width=50px | D16 | width=50px | D17 | width=50px | D18 |- | | D28 | | D27 | | D26 | | D25 | | D24 | | D23 | | D22 | | D21 | | D20 | | D19 |- ! | D29 Ran ! | D30 Ran ! | D31 Ran ! | D32 Ran ! | D33 Ran ! | D34 Ran ! | D35 Ran ! | D36 Ran ! | D37 Ran ! | D38 Ran |- | colspan=9 align=right | Majority \u2192 ! rowspan=2 | D39 Unknown |- ! | R29 Unknown ! | R30 Retired ! | R31 Retired ! | R32 Retired ! | AM1 Retired | | I1 ! | D42 Retired ! | D41 Unknown ! | D40 Unknown |- ! | R28 Unknown ! | R27 Ran ! | R26 Ran ! | R25 Ran ! | R24 Ran ! | R23 Ran | | R22 | | R21 | | R20 | | R19 |- | | R9 | | R10 | | R11 | | R12 | | R13 | | R14 | | R15 | | R16 | | R17 | | R18 |- | | R8 | | R7 | | R6 | | R5 | | R4 | | R3 | | R2 | | R1 | colspan=2 | |} === After the elections === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" width=750px |- | | D8 | | D7 | | D6 | | D5 | | D4 | | D3 | | D2 | | D1 | colspan=2 | |- | width=50px | D9 | width=50px | D10 | width=50px | D11 | width=50px | D12 | width=50px | D13 | width=50px | D14 | width=50px | D15 | width=50px | D16 | width=50px | D17 | width=50px | D18 |- | | D28 | | D27 | | D26 | | D25 | | D24 | | D23 | | D22 | | D21 | | D20 | | D19 |- ! | D29 Re-elected ! | D30 Re-elected ! | D31 Re-elected ! | D33 Re-elected ! | D33 Hold ! | D34 Hold ! | D35 Hold ! | D36 Gain ! | D37 Gain | | I1 |- | colspan=9 align=right | Plurality \u2193 ! rowspan=2 | RA1 Gain |- ! | R29 Hold ! | R30 Hold ! | R31 Gain ! | R32 Gain ! | R33 Gain ! | R34 Gain ! | R35 Gain ! | R36 Gain ! | R37 Gain |- ! | R28 Hold ! | R27 Hold ! | R26 Re-elected ! | R25 Re-elected ! | R24 Re-elected ! | R23 Re-elected | | R22 | | R21 | | R20 | | R19 |- | | R9 | | R10 | | R11 | | R12 | | R13 | | R14 | | R15 | | R16 | | R17 | | R18 |- | | R8 | | R7 | | R6 | | R5 | | R4 | | R3 | | R2 | | R1 | colspan=2 | |} {| |- valign=top !

Democrat Francis Kernan had been elected in January 1875 to this seat, and his term would expire on March 3, 1881. At the State election in November 1879, 25 Republicans and 7 Democrats were elected for a two-year term (1880-1881) in the State Senate. At the State election in November 1880, 81 Republicans and 47 Democrats were elected for the session of 1881 to the Assembly. The 104th State Legislature met from January 4, 1881, on at Albany, New York. The caucus of Republican State legislators met on January 13, State Senator Dennis McCarthy presided. All but one of the legislators were present, only State Senator Edward M. Madden (13th D.) was absent. The caucus nominated Ex- Congressman Thomas C. Platt for the U.S. Senate. Platt was a friend of the other U.S. Senator from New York, Roscoe Conkling, and belonged to the Stalwart faction. The opposing Half-Breeds (in the press sometimes referred to as the \"anti-machine men\") at first wanted to nominate Chauncey M. Depew, but he withdrew before balloting. The majority of the Half-Breeds, led by President pro tempore of the State Senate William H. Robertson, then supported Platt, a minority voted for Sherman S. Rogers, the defeated Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor of New York in 1876. Congressman Richard Crowley was supported by a faction led by Speaker of the State Assembly George H. Sharpe, allied with Governor Alonzo B. Cornell. U.S. Vice President William A. Wheeler, and Congressmen Elbridge G. Lapham and Levi P. Morton also received votes. {| class=wikitable |+1881 Republican caucus for United States Senator result |- bgcolor=lightgrey ! Office ! Candidate ! First ballot |- |U.S. Senator |Thomas C.
