BYU told him he could be expelled or visit weekly with his bishop, turn in fellow gay students, cut off contact with any gay friends, and have frequent visits with a BYU therapist until he was heterosexual and \"safe\" for other students to be around. Included in the therapy was weekly dates with women as an additional attempt to change his attractions. He got his Master's degree at Oxford University where he studied Geography and Russian Foreign Policy. == Career == Evans began working for National Geographic Traveler on a real-time digital story-telling assignment in 2009 on an assignment called \"Bus to Antarctica\".
