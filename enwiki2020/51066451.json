If there was any harsher punishment than this, their crimes would merit that too. This crime is a blot on society. If rapists like them are set free, it will only encourage molesters and rapists, and send a wrong message to society. Also, it is necessary that equal urgency is shown in all rape and molestation cases. This incident has changed our lives. We live in a locality where word spreads very fast. Some of our neighbours have made our lives hell. They taunt us when we pass. While she has been struggling to overcome the trauma, the local boys have not been letting her do that. She is often chased by youths in the area. When we venture out for family functions, we feel the difference in our relatives' approach towards us.\" She also added that the quick conviction was only due to the proximity of the 2014 general elections.In July 2017, Agarwal courted controversy by associating Hindu Gods with alcohol, while speaking on the issue of mob violence related with cow protection in the Rajya Sabha.
