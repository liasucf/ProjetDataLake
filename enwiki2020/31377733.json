    "text": "Castlebrae Community High School is a secondary school in the Greendykes area of Edinburgh. ==Headteacher and SMT== The Head Teacher is Norma Prentice and the Depute Head Teachers are Tony O'Doherty and John Johnstone. In June 2014 the previous head teacher Derek Curran was suspended while allegations against him were investigated. Norma Prentice took over for 2014-15 as Curran's investigation continued. In 2015 it was confirmed that Prentice would continue permanently and that Curran had been dismissed. ==Feeder schools== Feeder Primaries are Castleview, Niddriemill and Newcraighall. ==School houses== Castlebrae's pupils are split into three house groups. These are: *Blackford *Pentland *Calton These are named after the hills that surround Edinburgh. ==Proposed closure== In September 2012 it was announced that City of Edinburgh Council proposed to close the school in June 2013 because of falling rolls and poor exam results. A group of local parents and pupils contested the closure. In February 2013 a report recommended closure, with a new school to be built in the next 10 years as the area regenerates and demand builds. In March the council voted to give the school a \"reprieve\". ==References== ==External links== *Official School Website Category:Secondary schools in Edinburgh ",
