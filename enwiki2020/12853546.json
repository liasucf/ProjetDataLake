    "text": "Black Eagles () is a term describing a series of Colombian drug trafficking, right-wing, counter-revolutionary, paramilitary organizations made up of new and preexisting paramilitary forces, who emerged from the failures of the demobilization process between 2004 and 2006, which aimed to disarm the United Self-Defense Units of Colombia (AUC). These were first considered to be a third generation of paramilitary groups but there are Colombian military reports suggesting the \u00c1guilas Negras are intermediaries in the drug business between the guerrilla and drug cartels outside Colombia. As of 2007 they were reported as active in the city of Barrancabermeja. ==Origins== The Black Eagles first appeared in the Norte de Santander Department in 2006. On 18 October 2006, President \u00c1lvaro Uribe openly ordered their detention. The government ordered the creation of a new Search Bloc against the Black Eagles and classified this organization as a gang of former paramilitaries.Nine presumed members of the \u00c1guilas Negras captured, ejercito.mil.co; accessed 20 August 2007. Las \u00c1guilas Negras are one of a number of groups that have formed following the demilitarisation of the AUC, and they are said to be closely linked with the Usuga Clan. ==Drugs== The Black Eagles are closely associated with drug cartels and are involved in drug trafficking activities, extortions, racketeering and kidnappings. They have also attacked guerrilla members and suspected sympathizers. One individual who has been accused of leading the Black Eagles is former AUC leader Vicente Casta\u00f1o. Casta\u00f1o later disappeared and was believed to have been assassinated under the orders of Diego Murillo Bejarano in retaliation for taking controls of territory and criminal rackets. ==Groups== * Los Rastrojos: operating in Cauca Department and Valle del Cauca.27 alleged members of 'Los Rastrojos' gang arrested Colombia Reports, 24 November 2010 (Approx. 1200 members). * Mano Negra: operating in the Putumayo Department.
