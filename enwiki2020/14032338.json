    "text": "Kevin McDonald (born 23 January 1981 in Rutherglen) is a Scottish former footballer who played in midfield. His most prominent club was Dundee United, where he returned to work as a community coach after ending his playing career. ==Career== Having been developed as a player through Dundee United's youth scheme, he turned professional with the club in July 1997. McDonald made his United debut in a League Cup tie at home to Airdrie in September 2000 and appeared as a substitute in the Dundee derby two weeks later. During the derby match, McDonald \u2013 who himself suffered concussion and sickness \u2013 admitted responsibility for a challenge that saw teammate Jason de Vos wrongly sent off for challenging Fabi\u00e1n Caballero, injuring the Argentine for several months. The fallout from the challenge saw Dundee manager Ivano Bonetti call de Vos \"an animal\", prompting the Canadian to consider legal action. McDonald failed to make another appearance for United and went on loan to Greenock Morton in January 2001, playing three times for them. In October, McDonald was released from United along with youngsters Blair Sturrock and Gary Middleton. McDonald captained Scotland's under-15 and under-16 teams. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Rutherglen Category:Scottish footballers Category:Scottish Premier League players Category:Dundee United F.C. players Category:Greenock Morton F.C. players Category:Dundee United F.C. non-playing staff Category:Association football midfielders Category:Scottish Football League players Category:Scotland youth international footballers Category:Ross County F.C. players Category:Drogheda United F.C. players ",
