The campus is also home to the Carolyn Floyd Library. ==About== In 1968, Kodiak College opened its doors and began operations as a community college. The college did not have a large budget and carried out its classes at the local high school facilities on the island of Kodiak. There were just eight courses available with a total of 95 students enrolled in the college's first year; the director Carolyn Floyd taught the courses personally. In 1972, Kodiak had completed its first building that was dedicated to classrooms allowing for the college's first departure from the High School campus onto its own. In 1987, Kodiak College changed its previous designation as a community college to be absorbed by and be an extension to the University of Alaska Anchorage. The campus sits on 50 acres approximately from the city of Kodiak. During the winter semester in 2014, there were 914 students enrolled and approximately 100 courses are offered each semester. The college employs approximately 50 faculty members each semester. Kodiak College's only bachelor's degree is in education; there are multiple associate degree options. ==Academics== ===Two-Year Degrees=== *Associate of Arts, General Program (AA) *Accounting (AAS) *Computer Information & Office System (AAS) *Computer Systems Technology (AAS) *Early Childhood Education (AAS) *General Business (AAS) *Nursing (AAS) *Technology [applied/vocational] (AAS) ===Certificates=== ====Computer Information and Office Systems==== *Office Foundations *Office Support *Bookkeeping Support *Medical Office Support *Office Digital Media *Technical Support ====Other Certificates==== *Health Care Assistant ==References== ==External links== * Category:1968 establishments in Alaska Category:Buildings and structures in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska Category:Community colleges in Alaska Category:Education in Kodiak Island Borough, Alaska Category:Kodiak, Alaska Category:University of Alaska Anchorage Category:Educational institutions established in 1968 ",
