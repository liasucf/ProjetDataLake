After completion of the group stage matches, the top two teams advanced to the Quarter-finals. Teams are not able to face opponents from the same country in the group. ==Tiebreakers== In the group stage, teams were ranked according to points (2 points for a win, 1 point for a draw, 0 points for a loss). After completion of the group stage, if two or more teams had scored the same number of points, the ranking will be determined as follows: #Highest number of points in matches between the teams directly involved; #Superior goal difference in matches between the teams directly involved; #Highest number of goals scored in matches between the teams directly involved (or in the away match in case of a two-team tie); #Superior goal difference in all matches of the group; #Highest number of plus goals in all matches of the group; If the ranking of one of these teams is determined, the above criteria are consecutively followed until the ranking of all teams is determined. If no ranking can be determined, a decision shall be obtained by EHF through drawing of lots. ==Groups== The matchdays were 4\u20135 January, 11\u201312 January, 18\u201319 January, 25\u201326 January, 1\u20132 February and 8\u20139 February 2020. ===Group A=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group B=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group C=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ===Group D=== \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- \\---- ==References== group stage ",
