On 18 September 2008 INCRA recognised the reserve as supporting 300 families of small farmers, who would be eligible for PRONAF support. The deliberative council of the reserve was created on 4 November 2010. An ordinance of 9 January 2012 established a joint planning process for conservation units in the BR-319 area of influence, which are the Abufari Biological Reserve, Cuni\u00e3 Ecological Station, Nascentes do Lago Jari National Park, Mapinguari National Park, Balata-Tufari National Forest, Humait\u00e1 National Forest, Iquiri National Forest, Lago do Capan\u00e3-Grande Extractive Reserve, Ituxi Extractive Reserve, M\u00e9dio Purus Extractive Reserve and Lago do Cuni\u00e3 Extractive Reserve.

Objectives included giving the residents an update on progress in preparing the community forest management plan, and informing the residents about the business plan for commercializing wood. The institutes had entered a partnership with the Association of Agroextractive Producers of the Assembly of God of Ituxi River to prepare a training plan for forest management. The Sustainable Forestry Management Plan was approved in June 2014, covering an area of divided into ten units of annual production.
