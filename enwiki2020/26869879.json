    "text": "The M992A2 Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle (FAASV) is built on the chassis of the M109-series howitzer. It is also colloquially referred to as a \"cat\" (referring to its nomenclature, CAT: Carrier, Ammunition, Tracked). It replaced the M548 supply vehicle. Unlike the M548, it is armored. ==Design== Inside the M992 as viewed from the rear as well as its loader This ammunition vehicle has no turret, but has a taller superstructure to store 95 rounds with a corresponding number of powders and primers. There is a maximum of 92 conventional rounds, 45 each in two racks, and 3 M712 Copperhead rounds. Until recently, much of the remaining internal crew space was taken up by a hydraulically powered conveyor system designed to allow the quick uploading of rounds or their transfer to the M109-series howitzer. Most early models had an additional mechanism called an X-Y Conveyor to lift the rounds into the honeycomb-like storage racks in the front of the superstructure. A ceiling plate above the two racks can be unbolted and opened to allow the racks to be winched out of the vehicle. This vehicle is fitted with a Halon fire suppression system and a weapons mount similar to that on the M109 turret, usually mounting a Mk 19 grenade launcher for local defense against infantry and light armored vehicles. The latest models have a mounting point for two secure radios. The hydraulic conveyor system is usually removed by crews, as it is slower than moving the rounds by hand. Recently, the army has removed the conveyor system and changed the two horizontal opening doors to two vertical doors opening from the center to provide protection to the crew during transfers. The vehicle also contains a 2-stroke diesel powered auxiliary power unit that can power all non-automotive energy requirements on the Field Artillery Ammunition Supply Vehicle and on the howitzer when a slave cable is used to connect the two. This reduces fuel consumption when mobility is not required. ==Variants== ===K66=== K66 is a variant of the M992 license- produced by South Korea. Modifications include NBC protection and the increase of ammunition storage capacity to 110 rounds, 116 packs of powders, and 132 primers. ==Users== * - 40 (former U.S. Army) * - 48 (former Swiss, upgraded by RUAG) * - 275 * * * - 85 in 2016 * - K66 * * * * * ==References== ==External links== Category:Military vehicles of the United States ",
