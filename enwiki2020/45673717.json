    "text": "The Lo Nuestro Award for Regional Mexican Male Artist of the Year is an award presented annually by American network Univision. The accolade was established to recognize the most talented performers of Latin music. The nominees and winners were originally selected by a voting poll conducted among program directors of Spanish-language radio stations in the United States and also based on chart performance on Billboard Latin music charts, with the results being tabulated and certified by the accounting firm Deloitte. At the present time, the winners are selected by the audience through an online survey. The trophy awarded is shaped in the form of a treble clef. Prior to 1992, the award was known as Regional Mexican Artist of the Year, until the category was split to form this award and the Regional Mexican Female Artist of the Year award. The award was first presented to Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez in 1992. Mexican performers Marco Antonio Solis and Espinoza Paz hold the record for the most awards with 4 each. Mexican singer Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez is the most nominated performer without a win, with five unsuccessful nominations. ==Winners and nominees== Listed below are the winners of the award for each year, as well as the other nominees for the majority of the years awarded. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:%;\"| Key ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:%;\"| Meaning |- | style=\"background:#FAEB86\"| |Indicates the winner |} Mexican singer Vicente Fern\u00e1ndez (pictured in 2011), winner in 1992, 1993, and 2009 Mexican singer Marco Antonio Solis (pictured in 2006), one of the two most awarded performer with 4 wins, winner in 1997, 2004, 2006, and 2008 Mexican singer Espinoza Paz (pictured in 2012), the other most awarded performer with 4 wins, winner in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013 {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- style=\"background:#bebebe;\" !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\"| Year !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:5%;\"| Performer !scope=\"col\" style=\"width:1%;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1992 (4th) | style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- |Roberto Pulido |- |Juan Valentin |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1993 (5th) | style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1994 (6th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1995 (7th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- |Ezequiel Pe\u00f1a |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1996 (8th) | style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1997 (9th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1998 (10th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 1999 (11th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2000 (12th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2001 (13th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2002 (14th) | style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2003 (15th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4| |- | |- |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2004 (16th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |rowspan=4 | |- | |- |Jorge Luis Cabrera |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2005 (17th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4 | |- | |- |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2006 (18th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |rowspan=4 | |- | |- | |- |Sergio Vega |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2007 (19th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4 | |- |El Chapo de Sinaloa |- |Mariano Barba |- |Sergio Vega |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text- align:center\" | 2008 (20th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |rowspan=4 | |- |El Chapo de Sinaloa |- | |- |Mariano Barba |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2009 (21st) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=5 | |- |El Chapo de Sinaloa |- |El Potro de Sinaloa |- |El Potro de Sinaloa |- |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2010 (22nd) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=5 | |- |El Chapo de Sinaloa |- |German Montero |- |Marco Antonio Sol\u00eds |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2011 (23rd) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=5 | |- | |- |Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez |- | |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2012 (24th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4 | |- | |- |Juli\u00f3n Alvarez |- | |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=4 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2013 (25th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=4 | |- |Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez |- | |- |Fidel Rueda |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 style=\"text-align:center\" | 2014 (26th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=5 | |- |Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez |- |Chuy Liz\u00e1rraga |- | |- |Noel Torres |- ! scope=\"row\" rowspan=5 style=\"text- align:center\" | 2015 (27th) |style=\"background:#FAEB86\" | |rowspan=6 | |- |Juli\u00f3n \u00c1lvarez |- |El Komander |- | |- |Noel Torres |- |} ==References== Regional Mexican Male Artist of the Year Category:Regional Mexican musicians Category:Awards established in 1992 ",
