    "text": "Courage & Patience & Grit is a DVD/CD set released by the band Great Big Sea on November 14, 2006. It contains video of the live performance from a concert at the Empire Theatre in Belleville, Ontario along with music videos for the songs \"Captain Kidd\", \"When I Am King\", \"Lukey\", and \"Shines Right Through Me\". The live performance was recorded during their The Hard and the Easy tour. The name of the album comes from a line in the song \"Tickle Cove Pond\" (\"It's only by courage and patience and grit\"), a song on The Hard and the Easy, which provides the name for that album but which does not appear on this DVD. == Track listing == # \"Captain Kidd\" (Traditional, Arranged Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett) \u2013 2:56 # \"Jack Hinks\" (Traditional) \u2013 4:08 # \"Sweet Forget Me Not (Graceful and Charming)\"(Bobby Newcome, Arranged Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett) \u2013 3:24 # \"Billy Peddle\" \u2013 (Traditional) 4:34 # \"Concerning Charlie Horse\" (Omar Blondahl) \u2013 3:40 # * \"I\u2019m A Rover\" (Traditional) 3:32 # \"A Boat Like Gideon Brown\" (Traditional, Arranged Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett, Darrell Power) \u2013 3:20 # \"The Mermaid\" (Shel Silverstein, Arranged Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett) \u2013 3:59 # \"The River Driver\" (Traditional, Arranged Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett) \u2013 3:20 # \"Scolding Wife\" (Traditional Arranged By Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett, Darrell Power) \u2013 3:59 # \"Old Polina\" (Traditional, Arranged Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett) \u2013 2:34 # \"Shines Right Through Me\" (Alan Doyle, Kalem Mahoney, S\u00e9an McCann) \u2013 3:17 # \"When I\u2019m Up\" (Ian Telfer, Alan Prosser, John Jones) \u2013 4:19 # \"The Night Pat Murphy Died\" (Johnny Burke) \u2013 3:37 # \"When I Am King\" (Alan Doyle) \u2013 2:48 # * \"Danny Boy\" (Traditional) 3:01 # * \"Run Runaway\" (Noddy Holder, Jim Lea) 3:30 # \"General Taylor\" (Arranged By Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett, Darrell Power) \u2013 3:33 # \"Sea Of No Cares\" (Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Chris Trapper) \u2013 4:15 # \"Helmet Head\" (Bob Hallett) \u2013 3:00 # \"Consequence Free\" (Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett, Darrell Power) \u2013 3:23 # \"Mari-Mac\" (Arranged By Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett, Darrell Power) \u2013 3:25 # \"Ordinary Day\" (Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann) \u2013 4:40 # \"Excursion Around The Bay\" (Johnny Burke) \u2013 2:41 # \"Fortune Set\" (Arranged By Alan Doyle, S\u00e9an McCann, Bob Hallett, Darrell Power) \u2013 3:15 # * \"Old Brown\u2019s Daughter\" (Traditional) 2:48 * Tracks marked with an asterisk not available on the audio CD. == Personnel == *Eric Beausejour \u2013 Design *Chris Butler \u2013 Photography *Yves Dion \u2013 Editing *Alan Doyle \u2013 Guitar (Acoustic), Bouzouki, Guitar (Electric), Liner Notes *Murray Foster \u2013 Bass, Vocals *Bob Hallett \u2013 Fiddle, Liner Notes, Tin Whistle, Button Accordion, Tenor Banjo *Fran\u00e7ois Lamoureux \u2013 Liner Notes, Mixing *Pierre Lamoureux \u2013 Director, Liner Notes *Kris MacFarlane \u2013 Guitar (Acoustic), Percussion, Drums, Vocals, Piano- Accordion *Andrew MacNaughtan \u2013 Photography *S\u00e9an McCann \u2013 Guitar (Acoustic), Vocals, Liner Notes, Bodhran, Shaker, Tin Whistle *John McCullagh \u2013 Scratching *Denis Normandeau \u2013 Mixing ==References== Category:Great Big Sea albums Category:2006 compilation albums Category:2006 video albums Category:2006 live albums Category:Live video albums ",
