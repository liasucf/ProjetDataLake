As such, it is the central provider of access to publications of the European Union including legal publications (prominently the Official Journal of the European Union), public procurement notices, open data and applications. The Publications Office makes this content available in a variety of digital and physical formats with the aim of facilitating access to and reuse of all official information coming from the EU as well as ensuring its long-term preservation.
