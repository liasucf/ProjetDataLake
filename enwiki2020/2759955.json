The name comes from the indigenous name of the location, \"shallow pond of caymans\", yakar\u00e9 (cayman, C. yacare) + up\u00e1 (pond) + gu\u00e1 (shallow), by the time of the Portuguese colonization. Jacarepagu\u00e1 is located in the West Zone of Rio in the Baixada de Jacarepagu\u00e1, between Maci\u00e7o da Tijuca and the Serra da Pedra Branca. The upper middle class Barra da Tijuca separates the suburb from the sea. Jacarepagu\u00e1 is divided into the following sub-areas (sub-bairros), which nowadays are already considered different neighborhoods: *Anil *Curicica *Cidade de Deus *Freguesia *Gard\u00eania Azul *Pechincha *Pra\u00e7a Seca *Rio das Pedras *Tanque *Taquara *Vila Valqueire The suburb is known for large open areas where events and shows, such as the last Rock in Rio, take place. The bairro contains the Camorim center of the Pedra Branca State Park, created in 1974. It is one of the greenest areas of Rio, with plenty of nature in some of the sub-areas, especially in Vargem Grande and Vargem Pequena. It holds a samba school called Unidos de Jacarepagu\u00e1, churches like Nossa Senhora do Loreto, many shopping centers like Rio Shopping, Quality Shopping, and Center Shopping, and schools such as Garriga de Menezes, Pent\u00e1gono and Primus, and several clubs, like Ol\u00edmpico and Bandeirantes. In the mid-20th century, the area was home to the composer and mandolin player known as Jacob do Bandolim. It is also home to the Aut\u00f3dromo de Jacarepagu\u00e1, which hosted the Formula One Brazilian Grand Prix between 1978 and 1989. It also hosted the Rio de Janeiro motorcycle Grand Prix between 1995 and 2004. Recently, works have been done to build an Olympic Village in an area disputed by Jacarepagu\u00e1 (or JPA) and Barra da Tijuca, a neighborhood nearby. Regardless of who \"owns\" the area, the Cariocas that live close to it were very excited about the Pan-American Games that were held there in 2007.
