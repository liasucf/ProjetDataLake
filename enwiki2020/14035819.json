Individual agencies set aside a fraction of their research and development funds for the program and competitively award contracts to those firms that propose the best strategies to solve solicitation topics. The topics are chosen to address technical issues that each agency considers important. Roland Tibbetts began the SBIR program as a tiny experimental project at the National Science Foundation. Today, the SBIR program has developed more than $21 billion worth of research by more than 15,000 firms\u2014resulting in more than 45,000 patents. SBIR companies employ more than 400,000 scientists and engineers\u2014making the program the largest concentration of scientific and engineering talent in the United States, exceeding the combined total of all American academic and non- profit institutions. Each year, 11 federal agencies award $2 billion in research contracts as part of the SBIR program. ==Past winners== Ben Plowman receives his 2002 Tibbetts Award. 2016 {| class=\"wikitable\" !Winner !Location |- |Made In Space, Inc. |Mountain View, CA |- |EnChroma | |} 2015 https://www.sbir.gov/sites/default/files/Tibbetts%20&%20SBIR%20HoF%20Award%20Booklet.pdf {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
