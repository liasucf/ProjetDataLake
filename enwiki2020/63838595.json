He became the ruler of the emirate together with his two sons; Modibo and Ibrahim. He was commonly known as Sarkin Sudan, which translates to \"King of Blacks\" and was the first of the Sokoto Fulani ruling house in the northern region of Nigeria to become king. Nagwamatse was the tenth son of Sultan Abubakar Atiku, from the Dan Fodio ruling house of Sokoto. ==Rijiyar Nagwamatse== The legend of Rijiyar Nagwamatse involves Prince Nagwamatse of the Sokoto Caliphs. The legend states that while the prince was resting beneath a tree in Kontagora he scratched the earth with his finger, causing water to gush forth miraculously. This lead to the birth of the Rijiyar Nagwamatse, and the Nagwamatse well remains a watering spot to this day. The prince also performed ablution for \"Salat Asr\" (Islamic Prayer) at this particular site, because the kingdom lacked drinking water. Although the Kambari people entirely inhabited the kingdom at that time, it is still reclaimed by the Niger State. In the early 19th century, the Kambari people left the kingdom because of a civil war in the Magna Kingdom. The ruling family of Umaru Nagwamatse now leads it.Rethinking histories of forced movements and migrations within the valleys of Niger Province from a Kambari perspective. 1860s1960s.
