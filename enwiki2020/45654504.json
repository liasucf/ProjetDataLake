    "text": "Souq Okadh is a souq, or open air market, near Ta'if, in Saudi Arabia. It was the largest and best known souq in pre-Islamic times. Today it is a popular tourist destination. ==History== Souq Okadh was a seasonal market which operated for two weeks each year during the month of Dhu al-Qi'dah. It was active from approximately 542-726 CE. It was more than a market, it was an important center where Arabs would meet to formalize tribal rules, settle disputes, pass judgments, make agreements, announce treaties and truces, hold sporting competitions and races, poetry competitions, and religious gatherings. It was especially important for poetry competitions, which served to formalize rules of Arabic language grammar and syntax. It was destroyed by the Kharijites in 726. The location of Souq Okadh was disputed until historian Muhammad bin Abdallah al-Blahad rediscovered it. ==Modern Souq== A modern souq has been recreated at the location of the historic souq. Each year's souq honors a different poet. The souq covers 14 million square meters of land. In modern times, as in the past, there are lectures, sporting competitions, poetry, artwork, and items for sale. The souq has 200 shops selling different goods including pottery, silverware, glassware, wall arts and historical manuscripts. == See also == * Tourism in Saudi Arabia ==References== ==External links== *Souq Okadh website *Saudi Arabia Museums website *Saudi Rock Art Heritage website Category:Pre-Islamic Arabia Category:Souqs Category:Tourist attractions in Saudi Arabia Category:Annual events in Saudi Arabia ",
