    "text": "The Lingga Regency () is a group of islands in Indonesia, located south of Singapore, along both sides of the equator, off the eastern coast of Riau Province on Sumatra island. They are south of the populated Riau Archipelago, known for the industrial island of Batam and the tourist-frequented island of Bintan, although the Lingga Islands themselves are rarely visited due to the infrequent local transportation. The equator goes through the northern tip of Lingga, the name of the main island in the archipelago. Administratively they form a Regency of the Riau Islands Province with an area of 2,266.6 km\u00b2 and a population of 86,244 people at the 2010 Census;Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. the latest official estimate (as at 2017) is 86,971.Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2019. The regency seat lies at Daik. The population are mainly Malay, Bugis and Chinese (predominantly Hakka, Teochew and Hokkien). ==Name== Lingga derives its name from the profile of Mount Daik which is shaped like the Hindu lingam, often interpreted as a phallic symbol. This mountain has three sharp teeth as peak, one of them seems to have broken off at its base, and it was immortalised by Malay poets as the symbol of durability. The poem is Pulau Pandan jauh ke tengah, Gunung Daik bercabang tiga, Hancur badan dikandung tanah, Budi yang baik dikenang juga. Nearby are the remains of the fort of Benteng Bukit Cening, overlooking the sea. The cannons are still lined up, as if they were awaiting another enemy attack. ==Islands== By size and population the most important islands in the archipelago are Lingga and Singkep, then Sebangka and Bakung. * Lingga with smaller Pulau Alut. * Pulau Selayar of Riau Islands between Lingga and Singkep. * Singkep with Pulau Posik to the west, Pulau Serak to the southwest, Pulau Lalang to the south. * Sebangka and Bakung to the northwest of Lingga, with town of Limas, and the islets Senayang, Kapas, Kentar and Mowang. * Pulau Lobam and Cempah to the west of Sebangka. * Temiang and Mesawak in the north. ==Administration== As at 2010, the Regency was divided into five districts (kecamatan) \u2013 tabulated below with their 2010 Census population:Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011. {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !

These days the main industry is fishing. There are a number of fine beaches with some coral around the Archipelago but there is very little tourism on account of the poor transport links with the outside world. * Singkep has two ports, Dabo near Dabosingkep and Jago near Sungaibuluh. Service to the port of Muntok on P. Bangka of Sumatera Selatan ceased operating regularly with the demise of the tin mining industry. However, a high-speed ferry continues to connect Tanjung Pinang to Singkep, from where local boats may be chartered to Lingga. * For Lingga, Daik is the major town and port.

During World War II, Lingga Roads was used as a fleet anchorage by major units of the Imperial Japanese Navy, in order that these ships be near a source of fuel. It was from Lingga Roads that the main Japanese southern striking force deployed for the Battle of Leyte Gulf. ==References== ==External links== * * Singkep Community Website * Descriptions of all the major Riau Islands Category:Regencies of the Riau Islands Category:Archipelagoes of Indonesia Category:Landforms of the Riau Islands Category:Islands of Sumatra Category:Islands of the South China Sea ",
