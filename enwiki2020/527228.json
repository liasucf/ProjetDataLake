    "text": "{| |} RFA Green Ranger was a fleet support tanker of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. She was wrecked on the Hartland peninsula, on a large rock, called Gunpath Rock, on 17 November 1962. She broke her tow from the tug that was taking her to be refitted in Cardiff, and drifted onto the rocks. Her skeleton crew of seven were rescued by the Hartland Lifesaving Company, with their breeches buoy. The ship became a total loss, and her remains are still visible at low tide. ==References== * Category:Tankers of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary Category:Ships sunk with no fatalities Category:Maritime incidents in 1962 Category:1940 ships Category:Ships built in Dundee ",
