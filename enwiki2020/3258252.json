    "text": "Caffyns Halt was a halt on the Lynton and Barnstaple Railway, a narrow gauge line that ran through Exmoor, England, from Barnstaple to Lynton and Lynmouth in North Devon. The station primarily served Caffyns Golf Links, as well as the rural area near the hamlet of Dean. It opened in 1907, and closed on 29 September 1935. From 1923 until closure, the line was operated by the Southern Railway.L T Catchpole: The Lynton & Barnstaple Railway 1895-1935 published by The Oakwood Press. Eighth edition 2005. . The site, now within the confines of the Exmoor National Park is still visible from the Lynton - Blackmoor Gate road. The isolated arch of a road overbridge is still standing, after an attempt by the landowner to demolish it was blocked by the national park authority. The ruined shell of the golf club house remains about half a mile north of the station. ==References== Category:Former Lynton and Barnstaple Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1907 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1935 Category:Disused railway stations in Devon Category:Exmoor ",
