It was selected as the Chilean entry for the Best International Feature Film at the 92nd Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. ==Plot== In\u00e9s (22), along with her husband Justo (28) and their best friend, Gerardo (23), are members of Fatherland and Liberty, a chilean right-wing paramilitary group of nationalist and neo-fascist ideology supported by the CIA, that performed multiple terrorist acts in the early 1970s in order to overthrow the leftist government of Popular Unity and Salvador Allende. In the heat of this fight they are involved in a risky and passionate love triangle. Together they commit a political crime that changes the country's history and incidentally involves them in a great betrayal that separates them forever. Forty years later, Gerardo reappears. Not only does revenge inspire him, but also his youth's obsession to revive the nationalist cause, now focused on street crime and haitian immigration. The police surprise him with an arsenal of war in his house. In\u00e9s, today a powerful and influential businesswoman, will do what is in her hands so that Gerardo does not disclose her past or her husband's. ==Cast== * Mar\u00eda Valverde as Young In\u00e9s * Mercedes Mor\u00e1n as In\u00e9s * Marcelo Alonso as Gerardo * Pedro Fontaine as young Gerardo * Felipe Armas as Justo * Gabriel Urz\u00faa as young Justo * Mar\u00eda Gracia Omegna as Nadia * Mario Horton as Jos\u00e9 * Benjamin Westfall as Doctor Sepulveda * Jaime Vadell as Don Ricardo * Caio Blat as Antonio * Mart\u00edn Salcedo as Jos\u00e9's brother ==See also== * List of submissions to the 92nd Academy Awards for Best International Feature Film * List of Chilean submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film ==References== ==External links== * Category:2019 films Category:2019 thriller films Category:Chilean films Category:Chilean thriller films Category:Spanish- language films Category:Films directed by Andr\u00e9s Wood ",
