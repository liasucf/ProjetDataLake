    "text": "{| |} HMS Calder was a Captain class frigate of the Royal Navy during World War II. It was named after Admiral Sir Robert Calder, Bt. KCB, who was appointed Captain of the Fleet to Admiral John Jervis in 1796, and saw action at the battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797. Originally destined for the US Navy as a turbo-electric (TE) type Buckley-class destroyer escort, HMS Calder was provisionally given the name USS Formoe. However, the delivery was diverted to the Royal Navy before the launch. ==Actions== HMS Calder served exclusively with the 4th Escort Group, earning battle honours for service in the North Atlantic. On 26 January 1945 the submarine was sunk in the Irish Sea south of the Isle of Man, at position by the frigates , , HMS Calder and . U-1051 was forced to the surface by the use of depth charges. A gun battle then ensued, with U-1051 finally sinking after it had been rammed by HMS Aylmer. This action resulted in the loss of all hands (47) from the crew of U-1051. It was entirely clear that the ramming of U-1051 by HMS Aylmer was intentional and that Cdr B.W.Taylor was not removed from command of HMS Aylmer shortly after this incident (see the article on for more information). On 8 April 1945 the submarine was sunk in the North Atlantic south-west of Ireland, at position , by the frigates HMS Bentinck and HMS Calder. U-774 was attacked by the use of depth charges after its periscope was spotted by a lookout on HMS Calder. This action resulted in loss of all hands (44) aboard U-774. ==General information== *Pennant (UK): K 349 *Pennant (US): DE 58 ==External links== * Uboat.net page for HMS Calder * Uboat.net page for U-1051 * Uboat.net page for U-774 * captainclassfrigates.co.uk ==References== * The Captain Class Frigates in the Second World War by Donald Collingwood. published by Leo Cooper (1998), . * The Buckley-Class Destroyer Escorts by Bruce Hampton Franklin, published by Chatham Publishing (1999), . * German U-Boat Losses During World War II by Axel Niestle, published by United States Naval Inst (1998), .
