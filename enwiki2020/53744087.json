    "text": "Mount Minnie Station, often referred to as Mount Minnie, is a pastoral lease that once operated as a sheep station but now operates as a cattle station. It is located about south east of Onslow and east of Exmouth in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The property was pioneered by Kenneth Durwent Messer. It was once part of the Gifford Creek lease, which was owned by Septimus Burt. The station takes its name from the nearby Minnie Creek. In 1913 a stone homestead was built on the property. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations *List of pastoral leases in Western Australia ==References== Category:Pastoral leases in Western Australia Category:Stations (Australian agriculture) Category:Pilbara ",
