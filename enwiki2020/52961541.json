    "text": "The Czech Social Democratic Party (\u010cSSD) leadership election of 1993 was held on 28 February 1993. Milo\u0161 Zeman was elected new leader of \u010cSSD. Zeman defeated Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek, Petr Miller and Pavel Nov\u00e1k who was endorsed by incumbent leader Ji\u0159\u00ed Hor\u00e1k. Zeman and Paroubek qualified but Paroubek dropped out of the election and Pavel Nov\u00e1k took his place in the second round. Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek represented so-called \"Rakovn\u00edk wing\" in \u010cSSD that supported centrist orientation of the party. Zeman was more left-wing candidate. Zeman's wing was more radical against ODS. The third wing was called Centrist and its stances were somewhere between the other two wings. It was represented by Pavel Nov\u00e1k. Petr Miller was not part of any wing and his support was minimal. 407 delegates were allowed to vote. Candidate needed to gain at least 204 votes to win. ==Results== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !rowspan=2|Candidate !colspan=3|Preliminary !colspan=3|First round !colspan=3|Second round |- !Votes !colspan=2|% !Votes !colspan=2|% !Votes !colspan=2|% |- |align=left|Milo\u0161 Zeman||179||46.37||||197||54.72||||212||56.53|| |- |align=left|Ji\u0159\u00ed Paroubek||101||26.17||||colspan=6| |- |align=left|Pavel Nov\u00e1k||99||25.65||||163||45.28||||163||43.47|| |- |align=left|Petr Miller||7||1.81||||colspan=6| |- |align=left|Total||386||colspan=2|100||360||colspan=2|100||375||colspan=2|100 |} ==References== Category:Czech Social Democratic Party leadership elections Category:1993 elections in the Czech Republic Category:Indirect elections ",
