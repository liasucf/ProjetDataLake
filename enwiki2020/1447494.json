    "text": "The Greatest American was a four-part American television series hosted by Matt Lauer in 2005. The show featured biographies and lists of influential persons in U.S. history, and culminated in a contest in which millions in the audience nominated and voted for the person they felt was the \"greatest American\". The four-part competition was conducted by AOL and the Discovery Channel and reported on by the BBC. President Ronald Reagan achieved the highest position. His son, Ronald Reagan Jr., commented to the network that \"I'm sure he would be very honored to be in the company of these great gentlemen.\" In total, the American public cast over 2.4 million votes during the nomination process. In detail, Martin Luther King Jr. was the highest ranked person of color, at number three, while Oprah Winfrey, at number nine, was the highest ranked woman. George W. Bush, at number six, had the highest status of any living American. ==Nominations== Nominations were accepted through 31 January 2005. The seven-hour-long series was broken into four episodes: The first episode counted down the top 100 and introduced the top 25 nominees in alphabetical order. The second episode featured biographies of the top 25 nominees as well as commentaries from influential people such as celebrities and politicians. The third episode, called \"The Great Debate\", introduced the top five nominees and pitted the studio audience supporters of each of the nominees and a person selected to represent each of the top five candidates against a panel of three celebrities. In the finale the top five \"Greatest Americans\" were announced as well as what percentage of the votes each had received. Votes were taken through a toll free (if calling from a land line) phone number, through text messages from cellphones, and through online voting. Voters were allowed to vote three times per voting method, so anyone had a chance of voting at least nine times. ==Top Twenty-five== # Ronald Reagan, (1911\u20132004) actor and 40th President # Abraham Lincoln, (1809\u20131865) 16th President # Martin Luther King Jr., (1929\u20131968) minister and civil rights leader # George Washington, (1732\u20131799) general and 1st President # Benjamin Franklin, (1705\u20131790) author, printer, scientist and politician # George W.
