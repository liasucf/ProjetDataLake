He began his career directing short travelogue documentaries, starting with April in Portugal in 1954 (not released until 1956). He worked in publicity, giving away Anita Ekberg at her wedding to Anthony Steel. Lloyd befriended Alan Ladd while making The Red Beret (1953) and Ladd gained Lloyd a job on production for Warwick Productions. He worked for that company for a number of years, then went to work for Carl Foreman. Lloyd's first credit as producer came when Richard Widmark, with whom he had made A Prize of Gold (1955), asked him to co produce The Secret Ways (1961). He went on to produce The Poppy Is Also a Flower (1966), Murderer's Row (1966), and westerns such as Shalako (1968) Catlow (1971) and The Man Called Noon (1973). Lloyd obtained finance from international sources. In the 1970s, Lloyd went independent, but his first effort, Paper Tiger (1975), was not a success, although he said it was probably his favourite picture.The Last of the Gentleman Producers at YouTube He put everything he had behind the $10 million action film The Wild Geese (1978). He followed with The Sea Wolves, (1980) starring Roger Moore, David Niven and Gregory Peck and Who Dares Wins (1982). His last film was Wild Geese II (1985) starring Scott Glenn and Laurence Olivier.
