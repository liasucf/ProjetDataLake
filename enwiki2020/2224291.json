Routledge: London. . and active interest in others. It is the first of the four sublime states (Brahmaviharas) and one of the ten p\u0101ram\u012bs of the Therav\u0101da school of Buddhism. The cultivation of benevolence (mett\u0101 bh\u0101van\u0101) is a popular form of Buddhist meditation. It is a part of the four immeasurables in Brahmavihara (divine abidings) meditation. Metta as 'compassion meditation' is often practiced in Asia by broadcast chanting, wherein monks chant for the laity. The compassion and universal loving- kindness concept of Metta is discussed in the Metta Sutta of Buddhism, and is also found in the ancient and medieval texts of Hinduism and Jainism as Metta or Maitri. Small sample studies on the potential of loving-kindness meditation approach on patients suggest potential benefits. However, peer reviews question the quality and sample size of these studies. ==Etymology and meaning== Mett\u0101 is a Pali word, from maitr\u012b itself derived from mitra which, states Monier-Williams, means \"friendly, amicable, benevolent, affectionate, kind, good-will\",Monier Williams, 1964, p. 834, entry for \"Maitr\u012b,\" retrieved 2008-04-29 from \"U. Cologne\" at http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi- bin/serveimg.pl?file=/scans/MWScan/MWScanjpg/mw0834-meSUraNa.jpg. as well as a form of \"love, amity, sympathy\". The term is found in this sense in the Vedic literature, such as the Shatapatha Brahmana and various early Upanishads, and Vedanga literature such as P\u0101\u1e47ini's A\u1e63\u1e6d\u0101dhy\u0101y\u012b 5.4.36. The term appears in Buddhist texts as an important concept and practice. Buswell and Lopez, as well as Harvey, translate metta as \"loving-kindness\". In Buddhist belief, this is a Brahma-vihara (divine abode) or an immeasurable that leads to a meditative state by being a counter to ill-will. It removes clinging to negative state of mind, by cultivating kindness unto all beings. The \"far enemy\" of Metta is hate or ill-will, a mind-state in obvious opposition. The \"near enemy\" (quality which superficially resembles Metta but is in fact more subtly in opposition to it), is (attachment) greed: here too one likes experiencing a virtue, but for the wrong reason.Buddhagosha, 'Vishudimagga' Section 2.98 == Mett\u0101 meditation == Mett\u0101 meditation, or often loving-kindness meditation, is the practice concerned with the cultivation of Mett\u0101, i.e. benevolence, kindness, and amity. The practice generally consists of silent repetitions of phrases such as \"may you be happy\" or \"may you be free from suffering\", for example directed at a person who, depending on tradition, may or may not be internally visualized. Two different methodological approaches have been discerned in recent review papers, practices that focus on compassion and practices focussing on loving-kindness. Focussing on compassion means that meditation consists of the wish to relieve a being from suffering, whereas focussing on loving-kindness means wishing a being happiness. The practice gradually increases in difficulty with respect to the targets that receive the practitioner\u2019s compassion or loving-kindness. At first the practitioner is targeting \"oneself, then loved ones, neutral ones, difficult ones and finally all beings, with variations across traditions\". Difficult may include rude, annoying, busy bodied, arrogant, self-righteous, vice-respect, neglectful, war-profiteers, fence sitters, nay-saying, charlatans, unkind, accusers, rebukes, provocation, liars, sacrilegious and unhappy. A 2015 meta- analysis synthesising various high quality experiments on loving-kindness meditation, found a medium-sized improvement to daily positive emotion, with meditation on the loving-kindness aspect of metta having a greater effect than practices with a focus on compassion. The length of time meditating did not affect the magnitude of positive impact of the practice. Kindness is the actions to alleviate suffering. Taking actions to improve the subjective experience of someone suffering, having experienced the instinct to help someone suffering (compassion). Imagine the pain, hatred, evil, terrible, annoying, stressful person, and consider how he/she feels all the time. Empathy may be feeling the entirety of his/her subjective experience, and understanding their thoughts or feelings. ==Origins== Prior to the advent of the Buddha, according to Martin Wiltshire, there existed the traditions of Brahma-loka and meditation with the four virtues of loving-kindness, compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. The early Buddhist texts assert that pre-Buddha ancient Indian sages who taught these virtues were earlier incarnations of the Buddha. Post-Buddha, these same virtues are found in the Hindu texts such as verse 1.33 of the Yoga Sutras of Pata\u00f1jali, wherein the word Maitri is synonymous with Metta.Quote: \u092e\u0948\u0924\u094d\u0930\u0940 \u0915\u0930\u0941\u0923\u093e \u092e\u0941\u0926\u093f\u0924\u094b\u092a\u0947\u0915\u094d\u0937\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u0938\u0941\u0916\u0926\u0941\u0903\u0916\u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u093e\u092a\u0941\u0923\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093f\u0937\u092f\u093e\u0923\u093e\u0902 \u092d\u093e\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0924\u0936\u094d\u091a\u093f\u0924\u094d\u0924\u092a\u094d\u0930\u0938\u093e\u0926\u0928\u092e\u094d \u0965 \u0969\u0969\u0965 - Yogasutra 1.33; Source, SanskritDocuments.Org Loving-kindness (maitri), along with compassion and equanimity, are found in the early Upanishads of Hinduism, while loving- kindness (metta) is found in early Sutras of Jainism along with compassion, empathetic joy and equanimity. The ancient Indian Paccekabuddhas mentioned in the early Buddhist Suttas, those who lived before the Buddha, mention all \"four immeasurables\" and Brahmavihara, and they are claimed in the Suttas to be previous incarnations of the Buddha. According to Peter Harvey, the Buddhist scriptures acknowledge that the Metta-concept containing four Brahmavihara meditation practices \"did not originate within the Buddhist tradition\". The Buddha never claimed that the \"four immeasurables\" and related Metta-meditation were his unique ideas, states Harvey Aronson, in a manner similar to \"cessation, quieting, nirvana\". The pre-Buddha Chandogya Upanishad, states Jayatilleke, in section 8.15 teaches metta and ahimsa (doctrine of non- harm, esp. non-violence) to all creatures claiming that this practice leads to Brahmaloka. The shift in Vedic ideas, from rituals to virtues, is particularly discernible in the early Upanishadic thought, and it is unclear as to what extent and how early Upanishadic traditions of Hinduism and Sramanic traditions such as Buddhism and Jainism influenced each other, on ideas such as \"four immeasurables\", meditation and Brahmavihara. In the Jain text, the Tattvartha Sutra (Chapter 7, sutra 11), which is accepted by all Jainism sub- traditions as authoritative, there is a mention of four right sentiments: Maitri, pramoda, karunya, madhyastha: ==Buddhist texts== In the P\u0101li Canon, the term metta appears in many texts such as the Kakacupama Sutta and Karaniya Metta Sutta. Other canonical materials, such as in the Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga, elaborate on it as a practice. And yet other canonical sources, such as the Abhidhamma, underline the key role of benevolence in the development of wholesome karma for better rebirths. This basic statement of intention and verse can also be found in several other canonical discourses.In addition to AN 10.176, other discourses that contain this text include: Discourse for the Brahmans of Sala (S\u0101leyyaka Sutta, MN 41) (\u00d1anamoli & Khantipalo, 1993); Discourse for the Brahmins of Vera\u00f1ja (Vera\u00f1jaka Sutta, MN 42, which is substantially a reiteration of MN 41 in a different locale); Sutta on the To Be Cultivated and Not to Be Cultivated (Sevitabb\u0101sevitabba Sutta, MN 114) ( & Bodhi, 2001, p. 917); First Discourse on Hell and Heaven (Pahama-niraya-sagga Sutta, AN 10.211); Second Discourse on Hell and Heaven (Dutiya-niraya-sagga Sutta, AN 10.212); First Discourse on Intentional Actions (Pahama-sa\u00f1cetanika Sutta, AN 10.217); Second Discourse on Intentional Actions (Dutiya-sa\u00f1cetanika Sutta, AN 10.218); as well as in the Pa\u1e6disambhid\u0101magga (see below) and the paracanonical Milinda Pa\u00f1ha. ===Karaniya Metta Sutta (Sn 1.8)=== Metta or lovingkindness here, states Harvey, is a heartfelt aspiration for the happiness of all beings. It is different than \"lack of ill-will\", and more an antidote to fear and hatred. It is the precept to conquer anger by kindness, conquer the liar by truth, conquer stingy by giving, conquer evil by good, states Harvey. ===Vatth\u016bpama Sutta=== In over a dozen discourses, the following description (in English and P\u0101li) is provided for radiating loving- kindness in six directions:See for instance, in the Digha Nik\u0101ya alone, The Great Splendor Discourse (Mah\u0101sudassana Sutta, DN 17), v. 2.4 (Walshe, 1995, p. 287); The Great Steward Discourse (Mah\u0101govinda Sutta, DN 19), v. 59 (Walshe, 1995, p. 312); The Great Lion's Roar to the Udumbarikans Discourse (Udumbarika-S\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta, DN 19), v. 17 (Walshe, 1995, pp. 390-391); and The Lion's Roar on the Turning of the Wheel Discourse (Cakkavatti-S\u012bhan\u0101da Sutta, DN 79), v. 28 (Walshe, 1995, p. 405). {| style=\"margin:auto\" | style=\"padding- right:2em\" | One abides, having suffused with a mind of benevolence one direction of the world, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth, and so above, below, around and everywhere, and to all as to himself; one abides suffusing the entire universe with benevolence, with a mind grown great, lofty, boundless and free from enmity and ill will.This particular English text is from the Nyanaponika (1988) translation of the Simile of the Cloth (Vatth\u016bpama Sutta, MN 7), v. 12. | 'Bodhgaya News(n.d.), Majjhima Nikaya, book 1, BJT p. 88, retrieved 2009-08-07 at http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&record;=2987 . |} In the canon, this basic formula is expanded upon in a variety of ways. For instance, a couple of discoursesSee, for instance, the Discourse to Subha (Subha Sutta, MN 99) ( & Bodhi, 2001, pp. 816-17); and, The Threefold Knowledge Discourse (Tevijja Sutta, DN 13), vv. 76-77 (Walshe, 1995, p. 194). See also the Discourse to Dh\u0101na\u00f1j\u0101ni (Dh\u0101na\u00f1j\u0101ni Sutta, MN 97) ( & Bodhi, 2001, p. 796), in which a similar statement about union with Brahma is made by the Ven. Sariputta without the trumpeter metaphor. provide the following description to gain rebirth in the heavenly realm of Brahm\u0101 ( sahavyat\u0101ya maggo) : :\"What ... is the path to the company of Brahm\u0101? Here a bhikkhu abides pervading one quarter with a mind imbued with benevolence, likewise the second, likewise the third, likewise the fourth; so above, below, around, and everywhere, and to all as to himself, he abides pervading the all-encompassing world with a mind imbued with benevolence, abundant, exalted, immeasurable, without hostility, and without ill will. When the deliverance of mind by benevolence is developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none persists there. :\"Just as a vigorous trumpeter could make himself (or herself) heard without difficulty in the four quarters, so too, when the deliverance of mind by benevolence is developed in this way, no limiting action remains there, none persists there. This is the path to the company of Brahm\u0101.\"MN 99 ( & Bodhi, 2001, pp. 816-17). In this translation, this text is presented as one paragraph. Here, it was divided into two, thus following the P\u0101li text presentation, to enhance readability.Given this text's length, relatively uncomplicated translation and lesser known status (e.g., compared with the Karaniya Metta Sutta), the associated P\u0101li text is not represented in this main article but here: :'''' :' (Bodhgaya News, n.d., Majjhima Nikaya, book 2, BJT p. 730 [MN 99], retrieved 2009-08-07 at http://www.bodhgayanews.net/tipitaka.php?title=&record;=3702 .) In this particular P\u0101li text, the word that is repeatedly elided (\"...\") is ' (\"student\" or \"young man\") so that only the text that is common to all of the identified discourses is represented here. (For instance, in MN 97, instead of ', it uses the name of the Brahmin being addressed.) ===Patisambhidamagga Mettakatha (Ps. 2.4)=== In the Khuddaka Nik\u0101ya's ', traditionally ascribed to Sariputta, is a section entitled Mett\u0101kath\u0101 (Ps. 2.4, \"Story on Loving- Kindness\").In this section of this article, the primary English-language sources are Buddhaghosa & (1999), pp. 301-304, Vsm.IX,49-58; and, \u00d1anamoli (1987), section 11, \"Methodical Practice: from the Patisambhidamagga.\" The Pali is primarily based on Bodhgaya News (n.d.), Patisambhidamagga 2, BJT pp. 64-80, retrieved 2009-08-07 starting at . In this instruction, a general formula (below, in English and P\u0101li), essentially identical to the aforementioned Cunda Kammaraputta Sutta verse (especially evident in the P\u0101li), is provided for radiating benevolence: In addition, this instruction categorizes twenty-two ways in which \"the mind-deliverance of benevolence\" (mett\u0101cetovimutti) can be radiated with * five ways of \"unspecified pervasion\" (') - all beings (sabbe satt\u0101 ), all breathing things ('), all creatures (sabbe bh\u016bt\u0101 bh\u0101vapariy\u0101pann\u0101), all persons (sabbe puggal\u0101 bh\u0101vapariy\u0101pann\u0101), all with a personality (sabbe attabh\u0101vapariy\u0101pann\u0101) * seven ways of \"specified pervasion\" (') - all women (sabb\u0101 itthiyo), all men (sabbe puris\u0101), all Noble Ones (sabbe ariy\u0101), all non-Noble Ones (sabbe anariy\u0101), all deities (sabbe dev\u0101), all humans (sabbe manuss\u0101), all born in lower realms (sabbe vinip\u0101tik\u0101), * ten ways of \"directional pervasion\" ('), of the eastern direction (puratthim\u0101ya dis\u0101ya), of the western direction (pacchim\u0101ya dis\u0101ya), of the northern direction (uttar\u0101 dis\u0101ya), of the southern direction ( dis\u0101ya), of the eastern intermediate direction (puratthim\u0101ya anudis\u0101ya), of the western intermediate direction (pacchim\u0101ya anudis\u0101ya), of the northern intermediate direction (uttar\u0101 anudis\u0101ya), # of the southern intermediate direction ( anudis\u0101ya), of the downward direction ('), of the upward direction (uparim\u0101ya dis\u0101ya). Moreover, the directional pervasions can then be applied to each of the unspecific and specific pervasions. For instance, after radiating benevolence to all beings in the east (Sabbe puratthim\u0101ya dis\u0101ya satt\u0101 ...), one radiates it to all beings in the west and then north and then south, etc.; then, one radiates it to all breathing things in this fashion (Sabbe puratthim\u0101ya dis\u0101ya ...), then all creatures, persons, and so forth until such is extended for all those born in the lower realms. ===Benefits=== The Pali Canon says that there are a number of benefits from the practicing of metta meditation, including: :One sleeps easily, wakes easily, dreams no evil dreams. One is dear to human beings, dear to non-human beings. The devas protect one. Neither fire, poison, nor weapons can touch one. One's mind gains concentration quickly. One's complexion is bright. One dies unconfused and \u2013 if penetrating no higher \u2013 is headed for [reborn in]Metta (Mettanisamsa) Sutta Piyadassi Thera (translator) the Brahma worlds.AN 11.16 (trans. Thanissaro, 1997b). See also AN 8.1 (similarly entitled, Mett\u0101nisasa Sutta [SLTP] and Mett\u0101 Sutta\u1e43 [CSCD]) which omits the last three of four benefits mentioned in AN 11.16 (that is, it omits \"One's mind gains concentration quickly. One's complexion is bright. One dies unconfused...\"). The Canon also upholds fully ripened metta development as a foremost antidote to ill will: :\u201cNo other thing do I know, O monks, on account of which unarisen ill will does not arise and arisen ill will is abandoned so much as on account of this: the liberation of the heart by benevolence. For one who attends properly to the liberation of the heart by benevolence, unarisen ill will does not arise and arisen ill will is abandoned.\u201dAN 1.ii.7 (trans. Nyanaponika & Bodhi, 1999, p. 34). Monks, whatever grounds there are for making merit productive of a future birth, all these do not equal a sixteenth part of the liberation of mind by benevolence. The liberation of mind by benevolence surpasses them and shines forth, bright and brilliant. Mett\u0101 meditation is regularly recommended to the Buddha's followers in the Pali canon. The canon generally advises radiating metta in each of the six directions, to whatever beings there may be.See, e.g. MN 7.12, Snp 1.8/Khp 9: , . A different set of practical instructions, still widely used today, is found in the 5th CE Visuddhimagga; this is also the main source for the 'near and far enemies' given above. In addition, variations on this traditional practice have been popularized by modern teachers and applied in modern research settings. == Maitr\u012b and Mett\u0101 == Metta is found in pre- Buddhist Vedic Sanskrit texts as Maitr\u012b, Maitra and Mitra, which are derived from the ancient root Mid (love), and these Vedic words appear in the Samhita, Aranyaka, Brahmana and Upanishad layers of texts in the Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.Maurice Bloomfield, A Vedic Concordance, Harvard University Press, pages 713-717 Similarly, the term appears in hymn 55 of Book 19 of the Atharvaveda, and various Upanishads. A major early Upanishad of Hinduism, named Maitri Upanishad, discusses universal kindness and amity. The Maitri Upanishad, states Martin Wiltshire, provides the philosophical underpinning, by asserting, \"what one thinks, that one becomes, this is the eternal mystery\". This idea, adds Wiltshire, reflects the assumption in the ancient thought that one influences their own environment and situation, causality is equitable, and \"good volitional acts conduce pleasant situations, while bad volitional acts conduce unpleasant situations\". The Maitri Upanishad teaches, states Juan Mascar\u00f3, that peace begins in one's own mind, in one's longing for truth, in looking within, and that \"a quietness of mind overcomes good and evil works, and in quietness the soul is one: then one feels the joy of eternity.\" The Isha Upanishad similarly discusses universal amity and loving-kindness, but without the term metta. These teachings of universal Maitri influenced Mahatma Gandhi. In Jainism, Yogabindu \u2013 the 6th-century yoga text by Haribhadra \u2013 uses the Sanskrit word Maitri in verses 402-404, in the sense of loving-kindness towards all living beings. ==Metta meditation research== Some pilot research studies on the effect of Mett\u0101 meditation indicate an increase in positive emotions for practitioners. In particular, an immediate impact on positive emotions after practice as well as a long term effect could be shown, though these effects might not hold true for everybody. In one proof-of-concept study, uncontrolled in sample selection and benchmarking, the researchers report therapeutic potential for psychological problems like depression or social anxiety, when combined with other reliable treatments. === Therapeutic potential === The application of Mett\u0101 meditation for the treatment of psychological and other healthcare-related problems is the topic of current research. Hofmann et al. discuss in their paper the potential use for therapy and report insufficient data, with some promising studies so far. Those studies could show a positive impact on problems such as schizophrenia, depression and anxiety. According to Hofmann et al., there needs to be more rigorous research, especially with the application of Buddhist approaches to loving-kindness and compassion meditation. In an 8-week pilot study in 2005, loving-kindness meditation showed reduced pain and anger in people with chronic lower back pain. Compassion meditation, a Science Daily article states, may benefit by reductions in inflammatory and behavioral responses to stress that have been linked to depression and a number of medical illnesses. Mett\u0101 meditation is a central practice within mindfulness- based pain management (MBPM), the effectiveness of which has been supported by a range of studies. === Caution and reviews === Bishop in a 2002 review suggests caution on claims of benefits, and states, \"what has been published has been rife with methodological problems. At present, we know very little about the effectiveness of this [mindfulness-lovingkindness-compassion meditation] approach; however, there is some evidence that suggests that it may hold some promise.\" In a 2014 review of multiple studies, Galante et al. reach a similar conclusion, stating \"results were inconclusive for some outcomes, in particular against active controls; the methodological quality of the reports was low to moderate; results suffered from imprecision due to wide CIs (confidence intervals) deriving from small studies\" and that \"the kindness meditation methods show evidence of individual and community benefits through its effects on their well-being and social interaction\". ==See also== * Anapanasati Sutta * Kayagatasati Sutta * Satipatthana Sutta, also called the Four Satipatthanas * Agape, Philia, Philautia, Storge, Eros: Greek terms for love * Brahmavihara * Caritas, Latin term for love * Chesed, loving-kindness and compassionate love in Judaism * Kamma\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na * Theoria, the practice of \"loving contemplation\" in Eastern Christianity * Yogasutras, a text that includes loving-kindness as a part of Yoga practice ==Notes== ==Sources== * Acharya Buddharakkhita (trans.)
