    "text": "The R\u00e4tisches Grauvieh is an endangered Swiss breed of cattle from the Graub\u00fcnden in eastern Switzerland. It is a smaller type of the Tiroler Grauvieh breed of Alpine grey cattle. In the 1920s it was absorbed into the Braunvieh population. In 1985 the population was re-established by the introduction of cattle of the similar Albula type from Austria. Like the Rhaetian Alps, it is named for the Ancient Roman province of Rhaetia. == History == In the Graub\u00fcnden, in eastern Switzerland, there were two strains of the Alpine Tiroler Grauvieh: the large and heavy Oberl\u00e4nder type, and the smaller Albula type. They were triple-purpose animals, reared for draught use, for milk, and for meat. In the 1920s, they were absorbed into the Braunvieh population. In 1985, cattle of the Albula type were re-introduced to the area from Austria by ProSpecieRara in order to re-establish the breed. In 2015 a population of 2000 was reported. ==References== Category:Cattle breeds originating in Switzerland ",
