    "text": "Carlos Imperial in 1971 Carlos Eduardo da Corte Imperial (, November 24, 1935 \u2013 November 4, 1992), better known as Carlos Imperial, born in Cachoeiro de Itapemirim, ES, Brazil, was a Brazilian actor, filmmaker, television presenter, songwriter and music producer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ==Early life and career== Around 1961, at the age of 29, Imperial tried to launch the career of Roberto Carlos as a \"prince of bossa nova\", producing his first album, Crazy For You. However, his pupil was accused of shamelessly imitating Joao Gilberto, and the album failed. But he continued until he was signed to CBS in 1958 as a producer. At that time he was known as \"Dad\". In the early 1970s, Imperial became a controversial judge on a talent show presented by Chacrinha. At the end of the decade, he presented TV Tupi as an attraction on Saturday nights; it later migrated to TVS - Canal 11 Rio de Janeiro. Imperial was also a columnist for the magazine Amiga, published by Bloch Publishing from 1969. His column was characterised by its irreverence. At the 1984 Carnival, Imperial became famous for releasing the notes of the jurors in the parades of the samba schools in Rio. Every time a maximum score was awarded he exclaimed loudly \"dez, nota dez\" (\"ten! ten points!\"). This sentence appealed to popular taste, gaining him real support. He was elected an alderman of Rio de Janeiro in 1982. He ran for mayor of Rio in 1985, but lost the election. He later became an author of the well-known 1960s song \"A Pra\u00e7a\" (\"the square\"), the Ronnie Von hit that became the opening theme of the humorous television programme A Pra\u00e7a \u00c9 Nossa (\"the square is ours\"). ==Personal life== Imperial had a daughter Maria Luiza and a son Marco Antonio from his marriage to Rose Gracie, the daughter of Carlos Gracie from the Gracie Family. Maria Luiza married her second cousin Rorion Gracie and had two daughters that were the love of his life as he would claim named Riane and Rose. Rose took care of her grandfather for the last few months of his life and moved to the US soon after Imperial's death and has lived there since then. She has three daughters. Riane also moved to the US and has one daughter. Marco Antonio got involved with the Santo Daime and has become a prominent figure in that religion. ==Death== Imperial was a victim of the rare disease myasthenia gravis. After an operation to remove his thymus, he died on November 4, 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, at the age of 56. ==Filmography== ===TV shows=== *1977: Programa Carlos Imperial *1979: Show Carlos Imperial ===Director=== *1974: A Building Called 200 *1975: The Death Squad *1976: Sex Dolls *1976: The sex fiend *1979: Humor, the Golden Butt *1981: Delights of Sex *1981: A Martian in My Bed *1981: Women ===Actor=== *1954: The oil is ours - Bit part *1956: Smuggling *1957: De Vento em Popa *1957: Sherlock Araque - Carlos *1957: cowboy up *1957: Canjer\u00ea *1958: My mother and Police *1958: And He Do not Bug - Chic\u00e3o *1958: Joy of Life *1958: Ag\u00fcenta o Roj\u00e3o *1959: Women on Vista *1959: Walking in the Table *1959: Lean Girl *1960: Go That Is Soft - P\u00e9 de Cabra *1961: Women, I came *1961: Rio Night *1961: The owner of the Ball - Ronaldo *1962: Blood at Dawn *1964: Asphalt Wild *1968: The King of Pilantragem *1968: Bebel, Garota Propaganda *1969: Time of Violence *1971: The Loves of a Tacky *1971: The Sweet Sex Sports *1972: The Virgin Widow - Coronel Alexandr\u00e3o *1972: Independence or Death - taberneiro *1972: Cassy Jones, Magnificent Seducer *1973: A building called 200 - Boror\u00f3 *1973: Pica-Pau Amarelo - Capit\u00e3o Gancho *1973: The depraved *1974: Sex Dolls *1974: Banana Mechanics - Dr. Ferr\u00e3o *1975: The Expletive *1975: The Monster Cara\u00edba *1975: The Death Squad *1976: The Pervert *1976: O Palavr\u00e3o *1976: Girls Want ...
