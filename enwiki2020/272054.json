    "text": "In mathematics, a weakly compact cardinal is a certain kind of cardinal number introduced by ; weakly compact cardinals are large cardinals, meaning that their existence cannot be proven from the standard axioms of set theory. (Tarski originally called them \"not strongly incompact\" cardinals.) Formally, a cardinal \u03ba is defined to be weakly compact if it is uncountable and for every function f: [\u03ba] 2 \u2192 {0, 1} there is a set of cardinality \u03ba that is homogeneous for f. In this context, [\u03ba] 2 means the set of 2-element subsets of \u03ba, and a subset S of \u03ba is homogeneous for f if and only if either all of [S]2 maps to 0 or all of it maps to 1. The name \"weakly compact\" refers to the fact that if a cardinal is weakly compact then a certain related infinitary language satisfies a version of the compactness theorem; see below. Every weakly compact cardinal is a reflecting cardinal, and is also a limit of reflecting cardinals. This means also that weakly compact cardinals are Mahlo cardinals, and the set of Mahlo cardinals less than a given weakly compact cardinal is stationary. == Equivalent formulations == The following are equivalent for any uncountable cardinal \u03ba: # \u03ba is weakly compact. # for every \u03bb<\u03ba, natural number n \u2265 2, and function f: [\u03ba]n \u2192 \u03bb, there is a set of cardinality \u03ba that is homogeneous for f. # \u03ba is inaccessible and has the tree property, that is, every tree of height \u03ba has either a level of size \u03ba or a branch of size \u03ba. # Every linear order of cardinality \u03ba has an ascending or a descending sequence of order type \u03ba. # \u03ba is \\Pi^1_1-indescribable. # \u03ba has the extension property. In other words, for all U \u2282 V\u03ba there exists a transitive set X with \u03ba \u2208 X, and a subset S \u2282 X, such that (V\u03ba, \u2208, U) is an elementary substructure of (X, \u2208, S). Here, U and S are regarded as unary predicates. # For every set S of cardinality \u03ba of subsets of \u03ba, there is a non-trivial \u03ba-complete filter that decides S. # \u03ba is \u03ba-unfoldable. # \u03ba is inaccessible and the infinitary language L\u03ba,\u03ba satisfies the weak compactness theorem. # \u03ba is inaccessible and the infinitary language L\u03ba,\u03c9 satisfies the weak compactness theorem. # \u03ba is inaccessible and for every transitive set M of cardinality \u03ba with \u03ba \\in M, {}^{<\\kappa}M\\subset M, and satisfying a sufficiently large fragment of ZFC, there is an elementary embedding j from M to a transitive set N of cardinality \u03ba such that ^{<\\kappa}N\\subset N, with critical point crit(j)=\u03ba. A language L\u03ba,\u03ba is said to satisfy the weak compactness theorem if whenever \u03a3 is a set of sentences of cardinality at most \u03ba and every subset with less than \u03ba elements has a model, then \u03a3 has a model. Strongly compact cardinals are defined in a similar way without the restriction on the cardinality of the set of sentences. ==See also== *List of large cardinal properties == References == * * * * Category:Large cardinals ",
