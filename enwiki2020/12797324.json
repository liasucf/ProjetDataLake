Marks died in 2000 from methanol poisoning while working at the Amundsen\u2013Scott South Pole Station. New Zealand police and the coroner, Richard McElrea, said Raytheon and the National Science Foundation failed to provide full and prompt information to the authorities. New Zealand police believe there was a private U.S. investigation into the death, which the U.S. organizations refused to disclose. In 2007, two employees of Raytheon had to be evacuated from the South Pole Station after one broke the other's jaw in a \"drunken Christmas punch-up\". https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/dec/27/usa.barbaramcmahonhttp://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/01/02/booze- fueled-fight-forces-south-pole-evacuation.html ==References== == External links == * Raytheon Polar Services * USAP Program Participant Guide, 2008-2010 * Defense Contract Audit Agency review of Raytheon Polar Services Company Category:National Science Foundation Category:Raytheon Company ",
