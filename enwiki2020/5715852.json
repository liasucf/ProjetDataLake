    "text": "Disney's Party is a pair of 2002/2003 party video games, one developed by Neverland Co. for the GameCube, and the other by Jupiter Corporation for the Game Boy Advance. The games are much like the games of the Hudson Soft- produced Mario Party series, where you compete in mini-games to win the game. ==Gameplay== The gameplay in this game is different from other games of its kind. In starting the game, there are only up to 4 different choices. You then vote on these choices, the more votes a game receives the more it increases the chance of the spinner landing on it. Whatever game the spinner lands on is then played. Similar to the popular Mario Party series, you play on a game board, which features an item shop stocked with items for use on the board's spaces. In order to win the game, you must advance and land on the flag where it says destination. You then have to play another minigame to win the park. When you win the most parks you advance to a boss stage. Upon the boss' defeat, you win the game and the credits appear. ==Reception== Disney's Party received bad reviews with gaming critics, for example receiving a score of 3 out of 10 from Game Informer magazine. ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * Category:2002 video games Category:Mickey Mouse video games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Game Boy Advance games Category:Game Boy Advance-only games Category:GameCube games Category:GameCube-only games Category:Hudson Soft games Category:Jupiter (company) games Category:Tomy games Category:Party video games Category:Donald Duck video games Category:Goofy (Disney) video games Category:Neverland (company) games Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:Video games developed in Japan ",
