So after we told Jello, his jaw dropped to the floor... he asked me again, \u201cMoe, so are you guys going to write a new album?\u201d... He says, \u201cThat sounds like some intense subject matter, maybe you should write about that.\u201d I really didn\u2019t give it a second thought that night, but the more I thought about it, I thought wow... the possibilities.\"Interview with Moe Adame (Burning Image) A Future in Noise.
