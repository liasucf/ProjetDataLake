    "text": "Larry Baptiste (born 10 August 1978) is a Grenadian-born Sint Maartener cricketer. A right-handed batsman and right-arm off break bowler, Baptiste was selected in Sint Maarten's squad for the 2006 Stanford 20/20, playing in their preliminary round loss to the United States Virgin Islands (USVI). Batting at number ten, Baptiste was dismissed for a single run by Sherville Huggins, while in the USVI innings he bowled two overs which conceded 16 runs, but failed to take a wicket. This marks Baptiste's only appearance in Twenty20 cricket. He has since played minor inter-island matches for Sint Maarten. ==See also== *List of Sint Maarten Twenty20 players ==References== ==External links== *Larry Baptiste at ESPNcricinfo *Larry Baptiste at CricketArchive Category:Living people Category:1978 births Category:People from Saint Andrew Parish, Grenada Category:Grenadian emigrants to Sint Maarten Category:Sint Maarten cricketers Category:Sint Maarten representative cricketers ",
