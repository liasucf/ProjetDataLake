    "text": "The Lombard autonomy referendum of 2017 took place on 22 October in Lombardy, Italy. The poll was not binding, but it might have consequences in terms of negotiations between the Italian government and Lombardy as the regional government will ask for more devolved powers since the \"yes\" won. Neighbouring Veneto also held a similar referendum on 22 October. Both President of Lombardy Roberto Maroni and President of Veneto Luca Zaia are members of Lega Nord (LN) and more specifically of Lega Lombarda and Liga Veneta, respectively. The LN is a strong proponent of federal reform, but in this case the referendums are also supported by the Five Star Movement. == See also == * 2017 Venetian autonomy referendum == References == Category:2017 elections in Italy Category:2017 referendums Category:21st century in Lombardy Category:Autonomy referendums Category:Elections in Lombardy Category:October 2017 events in Italy Category:Referendums in Italy ",
