    "text": "Mundia Sikatana ( 1938 \u2013 14 June 2012; Lusaka) was a Zambian politician, diplomat and lawyer. ==Career== In 2002, Siktana was appointed Minister of Agriculture. He and his government faced widescale media condemnation for banning genetically modified maize donations during a widescale famine in 2002. Upon the re-election of President Levy Mwanawasa in 2006, Sikatana was appointed foreign minister on 9 August 2006. On 22 August 2007, the former ally of Mwanawasa was fired as foreign minister with Mwanawasa citing Sikatana's declining health. However, on 3 September, Siktana refuted that claim, citing instead his reputation as an anti-Mugabe politician and Mwanawasa's better relationship with Mugabe following his appointment as head of the Southern African Development Community. He trained as a lawyer and during the one party rule by the first president Kenneth Kaunda, Sikatana championed the cause for justice and the respect of human rights. ==References== Category:1938 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Zambian diplomats Category:Zambian lawyers Category:Foreign Ministers of Zambia Category:Agriculture ministers of Zambia ",
