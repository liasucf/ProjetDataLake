    "text": "The 2008\u201309 Scottish Football League Third Division (also known as the 2008\u201309 Irn-Bru Scottish Football League Third Division for sponsorship reasons) was the 14th season in the format of ten teams in the fourth-tier of Scottish football. The season started on 2 August 2008 and ended on 9 May 2009. Dumbarton F.C. finished top and were promoted alongside Stenhousemuir F.C. as play-off winners. Cowdenbeath F.C. were also promoted due to Livingston being demoted to the Third Division. ==Teams for 2008\u201309== East Fife as champions of the 2007\u201308 season were directly promoted to the 2008\u201309 Scottish Second Division. They were replaced by Berwick Rangers who finished bottom of the 2007\u201308 Scottish Second Division. A second promotion place was available via a play-off tournament between the ninth-placed team of the 2007\u201308 Scottish Second Division, Cowdenbeath, and the sides ranked second, third and fourth in the 2007\u201308 Scottish Third Division, Stranraer, Montrose and Arbroath respectively. The play off was won by Arbroath who defeated Stranraer in the final. Cowdenbeath were therefore relegated. However, due to Gretna's expulsion from the Football League, an extra promotion place was awarded, thus Stranraer as losing play-off finalists were also promoted. Annan Athletic, formerly of the East of Scotland League, were admitted to the SFL to replace Gretna, who resigned their league status on 3 June.) The SFL voted on the matter on 3 July, with 5 clubs having put forward applications. Annan, who like Gretna are from the Dumfries and Galloway region, were chosen above other applicants Cove Rangers, Edinburgh City, Preston Athletic and Spartans. ===Overview=== Relegated from Second Division to Third Division * Berwick Rangers * Cowdenbeath (via play-offs) Promoted from Third Division to Second Division * East Fife * Arbroath (via play-offs) * Stranraer (losing play-off finalists, promoted due to Gretna's demotion to Third Division) Newly admitted into SFL * Annan Athletic ==Stadia and attendances== {| {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- ! class=unsortable|Team ! class=unsortable|Stadium !
