The album title refers to this being their seventh album in their 20 years of performing. At under 46 minutes, it also is distinctive as being the shortest album in their catalog. The album cover was photographed by bassist Ricky Kinchen, who has done the photography for all Mint Condition albums since 1999's Life's Aquarium. The music videos released from the album are recognized for their ties to actors. Actress Regina King directed the video for the Kelly Price duet \"Not My Daddy\".
