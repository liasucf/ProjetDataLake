    "text": "Bradamante (occasionally spelled Bradamant) is a fictional knight heroine in two epic poems of the Renaissance: Orlando Innamorato by Matteo Maria Boiardo and Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto. Since the poems exerted a wide influence on later culture, she became a recurring character in Western art. ==In Orlando Innamorato and Orlando Furioso== Bradamante, a female Christian knight, is the sister of Rinaldo and falls in love with a Saracen warrior named Ruggiero, but refuses to marry him unless he converts from Islam. An expert in combat, she wields a magical lance that unhorses anyone it touches, and rescues Ruggiero from being imprisoned by the wizard Atlantes. The two lovers are separated many times in the story, and her parents reject the suitor even after Ruggiero converts to Christianity, preferring a nobleman called Leo. She decides to marry whoever withstands her in combat and Ruggiero overcomes the challenge. At the end, their marriage gives rise to the noble House of Este, who were patrons to both Boiardo and Ariosto. The poems drew from legends of Charlemagne, chansons de geste, and blended recurring motifs found in the Matter of France and the Matter of Britain.DeSa Wiggins, Peter in ==In later works== Bradamante and Fiordispina (1632\u20131635) by alt= In 1582, French dramatist Robert Garnier wrote a tragicomedy named Bradamante that further develops the love story between the heroine and Roger (Ruggiero). Several eponymous operas have been written about the heroine: *La Bradamante, written by Pietro Paolo Bissari with music composed by Francesco Cavalli, was first performed in 1650 at the Teatro Santi Giovanni e Paolo of Venice. *Bradamante, composed by Louis Lacoste with a libretto written by Pierre- Charles Roy, was first performed at the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Musique (the Paris Opera) on 2 May 1707. *Bradamante, written by Heinrich Joseph von Collin with music composed by Johann Friedrich Reichardt, was first performed in Vienna on 3 February 1809. *Bradamante, composed by Eduard Tauwitz, was first performed in Riga in 1844. She also appears as a character in Handel's opera Alcina and Johann Adolph Hasse\u2019s Il Ruggiero. Bradamante appears as one of the leading characters in several novels. For example, in Italo Calvino's surrealistic, highly ironic 1959 novel Il Cavaliere inesistente (The Nonexistent Knight). In cinema, she is depicted by Barbara De Rossi in the 1983 Italian film ' (also known as Paladins\u2014the story of love and arms or Hearts and Armour) \u2013 a film based on the legends surrounding the Peers of Charlemagne. She appears as a Lancer class Servant in the mobile game Fate/Grand Order. The mobile game Puzzles and Dragons has added her to their roster as \"White Feathered Knight, Bradamante\" with Active Skill \"La Bella Paladina\" and Leader Skill \"I don't fraternize with weaklings\". ==See also== *List of woman warriors in legend and mythology * ==Notes and references== ==Further reading== * Bateman, J.
