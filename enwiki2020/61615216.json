They met while working on a low budget indie movie and were married a year later for 18 years before being divorced in 2004. They have 2 children, Ian Alexander Hernandez Andreen and Natalie Grace Hernandez Andreen. Scilla and her long time love of 15 years, Eric Michael Winn, have a blended family including children, Rashel, Jesse, and twins Ally and Arin Winn. Andreen started working in high end commercials and industrials until she landed her first job as a costume designer on a small independent movie called Dirty Laundry. She continued working on independent films until she landed the position as costume designer on The Wonder Years (1989-1993) for which she garnered an Emmy nomination for Best Costume Design. From there she went on to work on Party of Five (1994-1999) with Neve Campbell, Scott Wolf, Lacey Chabert, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Matt Fox, the pilot of Dawson\u2019s Creek (1998) with Katie Holmes, episodes of Smallville, Jack & Jill (2000-2001) with Amanda Peet, Sarah Paulson, Justin Kirk and Ivan Sergei.

Her first short film she produced, Mutual Love Life (1999), received Oscar consideration as Top 10 Live Action Short. She then worked as associate producer for Bit Players, which led her to her first trip to Sundance Film Festival. ==Indieflix== In 2005, Andreen launched Indieflix; a global DVD, on-demand subscription, streaming and screening service that serves independent filmmakers and provides social impact films, television, shorts and documentaries to create positive change in the world. IndieFlix has amassed over ten thousand titles from 85 countries and has secured worldwide rights on a revenue share basis. In 2007, she transitioned the library to streaming delivery and created the RPM model (Revenue per minute) paying filmmakers for every minute watched. In 2016 she successfully pivoted the streaming service to be edutainment focused, and now streams over 5,000 curated features, documentaries, shorts and TV series. Andreen additionally oversees the creation and streaming of IndieFlix original social impact documentaries to thousands of schools, corporations and communities in over 50 countries; effectively connecting the off and online worlds through film. IndieFlix also supports a variety of documentaries through the IndieFlix Distribution Lab whose messages merge with social campaigns. Unlike most other distribution companies, IndieFlix operates on a Royalty Pool Minutes (RPM) platform, which pays filmmakers based on how many minutes their films are viewed on various devices instead of a flat licensing fee. This methodology allows filmmakers to keep the \u201clion's share\u201dof the money.
