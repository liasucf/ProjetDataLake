It was published by Miraesa on July 10, 2019. It was subtitled \"The Root of the Korean Crisis\" (\ub300\ud55c\ubbfc\uad6d \uc704\uae30\uc758 \uadfc\uc6d0). The Japanese version, published on November 14, 2019, is subtitled \"The Root of Japan-South Korea Crisis\" (\u65e5\u97d3\u5371\u6a5f\u306e\u6839\u6e90). The book is based on a series of lectures delivered on the web-based Rhee Syngman TV, of which Lee is the host. The Japanese version was published by Bungeishunj\u016b Ltd. in November 2019 and immediately became a bestseller (No. 1 at Amazon on the day of publication). Bungeishunj\u016b announced it had sold 200,000 copies within a week. == Content == Described as \"anti-Japan tribalism,\" the book posits that there is a shamanistic mentality in a small minority of South Korean people who regard Japan as their primary enemy. Such a mentality, the authors argue, gave rise to some anti-Japan arguments among some South Koreans. In the book\u2019s prologue titled \"A Country of Lies,\" Lee Young-hoon speaks critically of the people who lie, the politics which lie, the scholarship of lies, and the trials of lies. According to this book, the lies are particularly noticeable in some instances of the ROK's national history. Lee and the co-authors thus elucidate how a minority of people in their country has created a small number of forged historical accounts. Essentially, the book argues that the official history of the ROK has never been empirical. Anti-Japanism has been a dogma for a minority in post-independence South Korea. As such, some anti-Japan forgeries were produced to dramatize the ROK's national history. Critical of such a falsification, the book argues that some South Korean scholars, journalists, novelists, artists, activists, and politicians all contributed to this process. Anti-Japan Tribalism is an attempt by some South Korean scholars to argue that there is distorted historical narrative in their own country. Based on their opinion, the authors discuss some anti-Japan arguments. The book \"has a potential to dismantle the ROK's official history, the one that has been taught as right.\" == Table of contents == The table of contents of this book, in Japanese edition, is as following: ;Preface to the Japanese Edition ;Preface ;Prologue: A Nation of Lies ;Part 1: Memory of Tribalism :1.

Lee Young-hoon responded to Cho's criticism, \"it is nasty propaganda that is not worth mentioning.\" He also said, \"I don't think Cho really read my book. He should criticize the book after analyzing its logic and reasoning.\" Hong Jun- pyo mentioned on his Facebook, \"I think this book is inconsistent with our common sense about the Japan's cadastral surveys, installation of iron stakes, wartime forced labor, and comfort women issues. It seems to be consistent with historical views to support Japanese ruling in Korean Peninsula.\" As discussed by Lee Woo-yeon, the book\u2019s coauthor and researcher at the Naksungdae Institute of Economic Research, Japan\u2019s better wages and employment opportunities attracted 100,000 to 200,000 Korean workers each year through the 1930s and the early 1940s. Moreover, there was little wage discrimination during the war, when Japanese companies were in need of Korean workers. No comprehensive criticism of the book has emerged by March 2020, although some reacted with political slander and reiteration of their views, such as insistence upon holding the Japanese government responsible for the mobilization of Korean men and women for the Pacific War. == Footnotes == == See also == *Chinilpa *Japan\u2013Korea disputes *Special law to redeem pro- Japanese collaborators' property == External links == * *# Lee Young-hoon 2018/12/10 *# Lee Young-hoon 2018/12/11 *# Kim Yong-sam 2018/12/13 *# Lee Young-hoon 2018/12/16 *# Lee Woo-yeon 2018/12/18 *# Lee Woo-yeon 2018/12/20 *# Ju Ik-jong 2018/12/23 *# Kim Nak-nyeon 2018/12/26 *# Lee Woo-yeon 2018/12/30 *# Kim Nak-nyeon 2019/01/01 *# Joung An-ki 2019/01/06 *# Ju Ik-jong 2019/01/08 *# Kim Yong-sam 2019/01/11 *# Kim Yong-sam 2019/01/13 *# Joung An-ki 2019/01/15 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/01/17 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/01/20 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/01/22 *# Ju Ik-jong 2019/01/24 *# Joung An-ki 2019/01/27 *# Kim Yong-sam 2019/01/29 *# Kim Yong-sam 2019/01/31 *# Kim Yong-sam 2019/02/07 *# Ju Ik-jong 2019/02/10 *# Joung An-ki 2019/02/12 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/02/21 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/03/05 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/03/07 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/03/12 *# Lee Young-hoon 2019/03/14 Category:Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea Category:South Korean books Category:2019 non-fiction books ",
