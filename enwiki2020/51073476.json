Following his business career, he has with his wife, Myriam Ullens, established the Guy & Myriam Ullens Foundation, known for the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing, China, and for founding the Ullens School in Lalitpur, Nepal. == Early life == Guy Ullens was born in San Francisco, California, as the third child to Baron Jean Marie Joseph Anne Mathilde Alphonse Ullens de Schooten Whettnall (1897\u20131950), a Belgian diplomat, and a member of the noble family of the Southern Netherlands. His mother was ethnographic photographer, writer, and Royal Geographical Society fellow, Baroness Marie Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Pauline Francis Ullens de Schooten Whettnall n\u00e9e Wittouck (1905\u201389), of the Belgium noble family , a daughter of distilling and sugar magnate , who together with his brothers and Paul Wittouck owned the Sugar refinery of Tienen. The family moved to Oslo, Norway shortly after Guy was born, where Jean Ullens took up the diplomatic position of acting Minister for Belgium. Over the course of World War II, the family was confined to Berlin, and later lived in India, Pakistan, and Iran. == Education and career == After a degree in law from the Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, in 1958, Ullens obtained an MBA at Stanford University in 1960. He started Eurocan in Mechelen, Belgium, a company that specialized in the manufacture of metal packagings for preserved foods and beverages. In 1973, he joined the management of the family company R. T. Holding, a conglomerate in food industries, and played as CEO a central role in the company's expansion into Asia. In 1989, the Raffinerie Tirlemontoise was sold to German company S\u00fcdzucker in a \u20ac1 billion deal. Proceeds from the sale were reinvested in food businesses via the holding company Artal Group, which Ullens served as president and CEO for. In 1999, following a change in strategy, Artal entered the textile industry buying French company Albert,http://supplychainmagazine.fr/TOUTE-INFO/Archives/SCM096/RETOUR- EXPERIENCE-96-CWF.pdf and took control of Weight Watchers International in a US$735 million 1980s-style leveraged buyout in September 1999 buying from Heinz 94% of Weight Watchers' equity. Artal Group subsequently earned US$3.8 billion by selling stocks while retaining a 52% majority stake in Weight Watchers. Guy Ullens told Forbes in 2012, that the initial US$224 million direct investment in Weight Watchers had returned US$5.2 billion to Artal Group. == Philanthropic projects == In 2000, Guy Ullens retired from business to devote himself to philanthropic projects with his wife, Myriam Ullens. In 2002 they set up the Guy & Myriam Ullens Foundation. One of the first purposes of the Foundation was to sponsor and organize exhibitions of Chinese art, and to lend pieces to museums and cultural centres around the world. Guy and Myriam Ullens helped children in Nepal by establishing orphanages and two intensive care centres for children with malnutrition. They also set up the Ullens School Kathmandu, partnering with the Bank Street College of Education to train Nepalese teachers. The Ullens School Kathmandu is the only school in Nepal to be IB certified. When Myriam Ullens was diagnosed with cancer in 2003, Guy Ullens took over the development of the Nepal project. == Art collection == In the early 1980s, Ullens initiated a collection of Chinese art that is one of the world's largest and by 2007 included nearly 1,700 pieces. The Ullens Collection is managed by the Guy and Myriam Ullens Foundation. In 2007, the Foundation established the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art (UCCA) in the Dashanzi district of Beijing. In order to establish UCCA, Ullens sold off his collection of J. M. W. Turner watercolour paintings for \u00a310.76 million at a Sotheby's auction in London in July 2007. UCCA was the first not-for- profit art centre in China dedicated to contemporary art. In a Sotheby's Hong Kong auction in April 2011, exclusively featuring 106 works from the Ullens Collection, Zhang Xiaogang's 1988 triptych oil work Forever Lasting Love, of half-naked figures in an arid landscape suffused with mystical symbols, sold for HK$79 million (US$10.1 million), a record auction price for a contemporary artwork from China, in Hong Kong.Record price paid for contemporary art, RTHK News, 4 April 2011Triptych by Chinese artist Zhang Xiaogang sets record, BBC News, 4 April 2011 In October 2013, Sotheby's Hong Kong at the Asian Contemporary 40th Anniversary Sale, Ullens put up for sale Chen Yifei's political realist work Red Flag 1 (1971), and The Last Supper (2001) by contemporary Chinese artist Zeng Fanzhi. The Last Supper was sold for US$23.3 million, setting a new record for contemporary Asian artwork. In 2016, Ullens, now in his 80s, announced that he was looking to hand over the UCCA and would sell his art collection at auction. On 11 February 2017, the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art received the 2016 Global Fine Art Awards for Best Contemporary / Postwar / SoloArtist \u201cRauschenberg in China\u201d. == Personal life == Ullens married Micheline Franckx (1932\u20132015) in 1955. They had four children, and divorced in 1999. In 1999, Ullens married Myriam \"Mimi\" Lechien (born 1952), a Belgian entrepreneur. Ullens is a yachtsman, and owns the 170 ft (51.77 m) long flybridge aluminium sloop Red Dragon II with interior design by French architect Jean-Michel Wilmotte. Build by Alloy Yachts in New Zealand in 2007 and commissioned in 2008, the yacht was put up for sale for US$28 million in 2015.
