Most strips of the series are one page long. ==Plot== The series follows the daily misadventures of a family of a low-middle class and their dog. It takes place almost always within the building, on the third floor of a typical large city block. In this aspect the series is very similar to other series of Bruguera featuring families, especially La familia Cebolleta. ===Characters=== The protagonist is Pancracio, the breadwinner, a dull office employee (firefighter in the early strips). He is bald, mustachioed, envious, arrogant, clumsy and above all, very unlucky, so he is always at the receiving end of the multiple slapstick misfortunes common of the strip. His wife, Leonor, a housewife and two children, Felip\u00edn, a very naughty small boy and Sabihond\u00edn, a bald kid with glasses who is always dressed in black and is a great student. The dog, Atila feels nothing but contempt by his owner Pancracio (the reader knows this via his thought balloons) In the first strips they had a rustic maid, Robustiana, but this character was soon dropped.La Familia Trapisonda, Un Grupito Que Es La Monda in Corra, jefe, corra One year after the publication of the first strip, Francoist censorship banned the ridiculing of the father figure in juvenile magazines, so Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez had to change the family relationships. Pancacrio and Leonor changed from husband and wife to brother and sister and the children turned onto nephews. To add to the confusion the kids were not brothers but cousins. It is never explained why the kids are living with their uncles.Guiral, Antoni. (10/2009). El universo de Ib\u00e1\u00f1ez: De 13, Rue del Percebe a Rompetechos.
