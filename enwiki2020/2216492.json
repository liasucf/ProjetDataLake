The studios and offices are on Rookwood Avenue in Fredericton, shared with sister stations CFXY-FM and CKHJ.FoxRocks.ca/contests The transmitter is on Provincial Route 620 at Route 617, at Hamtown Corner in Douglas, northwest of Fredericton.FCCdata.org/CIBX- FM ==History== CIBX traces its history to the first radio station in New Brunswick, CFNB (the call letters naturally stood for Fredericton, New Brunswick). The station went on the air under the experimental call sign of 10AD broadcasting at 1210 kilocycles in 1923. It was granted a full license as CFNB in 1926. CFNB then moved to 1030 in 1933, and finally to 550 in 1934. The station was affiliated with the CBC's Trans-Canada Network. In 1959 the station increased its power to 50,000 watts, giving it full-time coverage over most of the Maritime Provinces. The CBC affiliation was dropped in 1964 when the network started its own station in Fredericton, CBZ. CFNB played an adult contemporary format before switching to oldies in the early 1990s. In 1996, CFNB's parent company, Radio Atlantic, was granted permission to move its signal to 106.9 FM and to eliminate the AM transmitter.Decision CRTC 96-9 The call sign changed in the process, and after a brief simulcast period, CFNB 550 signed off the air on June 11 of that year. The new station, CIBX, played soft adult contemporary music. The former CFNB call sign now belongs to a radio station in D'Arcy, British Columbia, known as CFNB-FM. Over time, CIBX evolved towards hot adult contemporary. Between 2000 and 2005, CIBX used the on-air EZ Rock branding along with other stations in Canada (while using Capital FM as a secondary name), although it returned to using only the \"Capital FM\" name. As of July 18, 2012, CIBX officially flipped to Top 40/CHR. It was one of two Top 40/CHR outlets in the Fredericton market as it took on rival station CFRK. The competition lasted nearly three years. On May 31, 2015, CFRK flipped to country music, leaving CIBX as the only Top 40/CHR station in the market.\"CFRK Drops CHR For Country\" from Radio Insight (May 31, 2015) CIBX-FM and seven other radio stations in the Atlantic provinces are currently owned by Bell Media. ==Former Logos== File:Capital ezrock cibx.svg|2002-2004 File:CapitalFM 2005.svg|2005-2012 ==References== ==External links== *106.9 Capital FM *CFNB/CIBX history - Canadian Communications Foundation *CFNB Radio Atlantic - Timeline with photos from mynewbrunswick.ca *CIBX - fybush.com * Ibx Ibx Ibx Category:Radio stations established in 1923 Category:1923 establishments in New Brunswick ",
