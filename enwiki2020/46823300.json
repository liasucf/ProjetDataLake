    "text": "David Ancillon (17 March 1617 - 3 September 1692) was a French Huguenot pastor and author. He was born at Metz on March 17, 1617. At sixteen, he went to Geneva to study theology and, in 1641, was appointed minister of Meaux. In 1653, he accepted a post in his native Metz. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 compelled him to move to Frankfort. He then moved to Hanau and then Berlin, where he died on September 3, 1692. He was the father of Charles Ancillon. ==References== * \"David Ancillon\" in the Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, 9th ed. Category:1617 births Category:1692 deaths Category:People from Metz ",
