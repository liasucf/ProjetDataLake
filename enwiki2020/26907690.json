The station shared its program hours with KPCN-LP, a similar station owned by the Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste; that station left the air on November 20, 2019, and was effectively replaced by KTUP (98.3 FM). KPVN-LP had applied for a U.S. Federal Communications Commission construction permit to move to 95.9 MHz and decrease ERP to 28.8 watts, but instead turned in its license to the FCC on December 20, 2019. The FCC cancelled the station's license on January 8, 2020. ==References== ==External links== * PVN- LP PVN-LP Category:Woodburn, Oregon Category:Radio stations established in 2006 Category:2006 establishments in Oregon Category:Defunct radio stations in the United States Category:Radio stations disestablished in 2020 Category:2020 disestablishments in Oregon Category:Defunct religious radio stations in the United States PVN-LP PVN-LP PVN-LP ",
