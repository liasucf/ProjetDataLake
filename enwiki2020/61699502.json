    "text": "The Carpenter Building is a historic commercial building at 136 East Main Street in Gentry, Arkansas. Built in 1927\u201329, it is a single-story masonry structure, its exterior finished mainly in red brick and hollow clay tile. A stepped parapet obscures the flat roof, and the front facade is inset with square pier supports, giving the impression of a portico. The interior includes surviving original sections of tin ceilings. The building originally housed a retail grocery, as well as a mortuary and funeral chapel, but has since been repurposed to other uses. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Benton County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1904 Category:Buildings and structures in Benton County, Arkansas Category:1904 establishments in Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Benton County, Arkansas ",
