    "text": "Ion Constantin Br\u0103tianu (; June 2, 1821 \u2013 May 16, 1891) was one of the major political figures of 19th-century Romania. He was the son of Dinc\u0103 Br\u0103tianu and the younger brother of Dimitrie, as well as the father of Ionel, Dinu, and Vintil\u0103 Br\u0103tianu. He also was the grandfather of poet Ion Pillat. ==Biography== ===Early life=== Br\u0103tianu in 1848, detail of a group portrait of Provisional Government members Born to wealthy Arge\u0219 boyars in Pite\u0219ti, Principality of Wallachia, he entered the Wallachian Army in 1838, and in 1841 started studying in Paris. Returning to his native land, Br\u0103tianu took part, with his friend C. A. Rosetti and other young politicians (including his brother), in the 1848 Wallachian Revolution, and acted as prefect of the police in the provisional government formed in that year. The restoration of Imperial Russian and Ottoman authority shortly afterwards drove him into exile. He took refuge to Paris, and endeavoured to influence French opinion in favor of the proposed union and autonomy of the Romanian Danubian Principalities. In 1854, however, he was sentenced to a fine and three months' imprisonment for sedition, and later confined in a lunatic asylum; in 1856, he returned to Wallachia with his brother - afterwards one of his foremost political opponents. ===Under Cuza and in the opposition=== He was in favor of the Danubian Principalities' (Wallachia's and Moldavia) union, as a member of Partida Na\u021bional\u0103. During the reign of Alexander Ioan Cuza (1859\u20131866), Br\u0103tianu founded (in 1875) the National Liberal Party (PNL), until today a major political formation. Opposition to the land reform united the emerging Liberals and Conservatives against the Domnitor and his inner circle. Both parties comprised mainly landowners, and allied to block legislation in the Chamber - causing Cuza to impose his authoritarian government in May 1864. The two-party coalition, remembered as the monstrous coalition, opted for the removal of Cuza. Br\u0103tianu took part in the deposition of 1866 and in the subsequent election of Prince Carol of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, under whom he held several ministerial appointments throughout the next four years. Nonetheless, his very sinuous relationship with the new Prince was the source of several crisis situations. Notably, Br\u0103tianu would point to the benefits of a Republican project (which Rosetti and his left wing of the Liberal Party had never ceased advocating). Thus, when the experimental Republic of Ploie\u0219ti was created in 1870 around a Liberal group, Ion Br\u0103tianu was arrested as the inspirational figure, but was soon released.

The weight of the moment showed the weaknesses of the Liberals, as well as Carol's resolution: the Prince called on Lasc\u0103r Catargiu to form a stable and reliable government. The change in tactics forced the Liberals to form their loose tendency as a real Party in 1875. Alongside several liberal tenets, the new formation took a further step towards advocating protectionism and persecution of Jewish Romanians (see History of the Jews in Romania). In 1876, aided by C. A. Rosetti, Br\u0103tianu formed a Liberal cabinet, which remained in power until 1888 - this marked his coming to terms with Carol. ===Prominence=== The government took steps at taking the country out of its Ottoman vassalage; however, it differed from Conservatives in that they saw the main threat posed to Romania in Austria-Hungary. Liberals were of the generation that had truly brought Romanians in Transylvania to the country's attention; on the other hand, Catargiu had signed an agreement with the Austrian Monarchy that awarded it commercial privilege in Romania \u2013 while quieting its suspicion towards Romanian irredentism. Br\u0103tianu's government did not disturb this climate after the Russian alliance proved unsatisfactory, and the two parties resorted to assisting Romanian cultural ventures in Transylvania (until World War I). He aligned the country with Russia as soon as the Russo-Turkish War of 1877\u20131878 began \u2013 with its chapter, the Romanian War of Independence. While Romania did emancipate itself from Ottoman tutelage, Br\u0103tianu had to accommodate a prolonged Russian occupation, and the Congress of Berlin saw Russia seizing Southern Bessarabia, the only part of Bessarabia still under Romanian control (Romania was awarded Northern Dobruja in return). After the war, the Principality of Bulgaria appeared and began a search for a prince. According to Nikolay Pavlovich Ignatyev, Br\u0103tianu supported the election of Prince Carol I as monarch of Bulgaria. Ignatyev said the intention of the Romanian officials was to establish a personal union with Bulgaria. In 1881, Romania proclaimed itself a Kingdom. Ion C.

The Br\u0103tianu government introduced most modern reforms in the administrative, educational, economical, and military fields. It celebrated its main success in 1883, when the Liberals managed to have the 1866 Constitution of Romania amended \u2013 enlarging the number of electors and establishing a third electoral college, one that gave some representation to peasants and the urban employees. The move was not radical, and it served to obtain the Liberals political ascendancy: the very first elections under the new law brought them an overwhelming majority. In 1886, after a meeting with Carol I and the Bulgarian prince Alexander of Battenberg, Br\u0103tianu informed the Bulgarian diplomat Grigor Nachovich that Alexander had requested a Balkan confederation under the leadership of Carol I. This turned out to be a misunderstanding. After 1883 Br\u0103tianu acted as sole leader of the party, owing to a quarrel with Rosetti, his friend and political ally for nearly forty years. His long tenure of office, without parallel in Romanian history, rendered Br\u0103tianu extremely unpopular, and at its close his impeachment appeared inevitable. But any proceedings taken against the minister would have involved charges against the king, who was largely responsible for his policy, and the impeachment was averted by a vote of parliament in February 1890. ===Other activities=== Besides being the leading statesman of Romania during the critical years 1876\u20131888, Br\u0103tianu attained some eminence as a writer. His French language political pamphlets, M\u00e9moire sur l'empire d'Autriche dans la question d'Orient (\"Account of the Austrian Empire in the Oriental Issue\", 1855), R\u00e9flexions sur la situation (\"Musings on the Situation\", 1856), M\u00e9moire sur la situation de la Moldavie depuis le trait\u00e9 de Paris (\"Account on Moldavia's Situation After the Treaty of Paris\", 1857), and La Question religieuse en Roumanie (\"The Religious Issue in Romania\", 1866), were all published in Paris. == In memoriam == Many places, schools, streets, etc. in Romania are name after him, including: * The commune I.
