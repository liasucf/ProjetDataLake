    "text": "Benthosema glaciale, or glacier lantern fish, is the most common species of lanternfish and important part of the midwater ecosystem of northern North Atlantic. ==Distribution== Benthosema glaciale occurs in the North Atlantic as well as in the Mediterranean Sea. In the eastern Atlantic it is found from Guinea northwards to the Kara Sea, and in the western Atlantic from the northern edge of the Gulf Stream northwards to the Baffin Bay and Greenland. It is common in Norwegian fjords. Benthosema glaciale is a mesopelagic fish that can be found from surface waters down to depth of , but it is most common at around . It undergoes diel vertical migration, moving to shallower water to feed at night. However, depth distribution can be bimodal at night, suggesting that not all individuals migrate. ==Life history== Benthosema glaciale can grow to SL. They have a maximum lifespan of about eight years, although typical lifespan is shorter. Maturity is reached at age 2\u20133 years. Spawning takes place mostly in summer. In Norway, oceanic populations grow slower but to a larger size than fjord populations. Mediterranean populations have smaller body size, shorter lifespan, and might spawn throughout the year. ==References== glacier lantern fish Category:Fish of the North Atlantic Category:Fish of the Mediterranean Sea glacier lantern fish Category:Taxa named by Johan Reinhardt ",
