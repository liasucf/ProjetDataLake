It forms a pair with Porcia (Uffizi). The work was first recorded in 1942 in an antiques shop in Toulouse, at which time it was attributed to Lorenzo Costa. Three years later it was acquired by France's R\u00e9union des Mus\u00e9es Nationaux as a work by an anonymous French artist, reattributed to Perr\u00e9al and assigned to the Mus\u00e9e de Moulins. In 1963 Charles Sterling researched the work, removing the attribution to Perr\u00e9al and instead assigned it to the Emilian Renaissance. He was also the first to link it back to Porcia (then thought to be a Saint Agnes or Virgin of the Annunciation from the circle of Lorenzo di Credi or of Franciabigio), which Sterling happened to have seen at the Istituto Centrale del Restauro in Rome. Minerva was reassigned yet again to a Florentine painter in 1967, the same year as it was moved to the Louvre's stores. It formed part of an exhibition in 1982, for which Sylvie B\u00e9guin reattributed it to Fra Bartolomeo's youth. However, it to took until its inclusion in the Il Giardino di San Marco exhibition in 1992 for this attribution to be definitively confirmed. ==References== category:Paintings of the Louvre by Italian artists Fra Bartolomeo category:1495 paintings category:Paintings by Fra Bartolomeo ",
