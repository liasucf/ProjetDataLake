A bishop sometimes begins to get hemmed in after the Morphy Defence is used, and c2\u2013c3 may be used to create an extra escape square. One way to get a king out of check is to move to a flight square on the next move. The other ways to get out of check are to the checking piece or to a piece to block the check. If the checked king has no flight square and there is no other way to get out of check, it is checkmate. One way to win from an opponent (i.e., end up with more pieces or more valuable pieces left on the board) is to dominate a piece by removing all of its flight squares (through attacking or occupying them), then threatening to capture it. ==See also== * Luft ==References== Bibliography * * Category:Chess terminology ",
