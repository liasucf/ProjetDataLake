    "text": "Love Is Payable is a 1997 Chinese-language period romance television series produced by Young Pei-pei, set in the Shanghai International Settlement during the Second Sino-Japanese War (which was policed by British and Americans before 1941 even after Shanghai fell to the Japanese in 1937). The series was filmed in Tianjin and Shanghai and first broadcast on Taiwan's Formosa Television. Originally, Anita Mui was the first choice to play Xiangxue'er, and Stephen Chow was the first choice for the role of Bai Lang. However, they were unavailable, so Carina Lau and Steven Ma were cast instead. In 2010, Young Pei-pei produced a remake, titled Entangling Love in Shanghai in English (the Chinese title remains the same). ==Cast== *Carina Lau as Xiangxue'er *Steve Ma as Bai Lang *Leanne Liu as Bai Ping *Lee Li-chun as Qiao Xiannong *Lawrence Ng as Zhang Guiting *Sun Xing as Ma Xianliang *Angus Tung as Chen Congming *Song Chunli as Hu Ying *Lu Wen as Liao Wanzhen *Yue Yueli as Han Dong *Chen Zihan as Yang Ming *Doze Niu as Da Mi *Chu Zhong-heng as Rong San *Dong Xiaoyan ==Awards and nominations== {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !# !Award !Category !Individual !Result |- |rowspan=4|34th |rowspan=4|Golden Bell Awards |Best Television Series | | |- |Best Supporting Actor |Lee Li-chun | |- |Best Sound Effect |Hu Lianzhong, Huang Gaoping | |- |Best Lightning |Lin Helong, Chen Zelin | |} ==References== Category:1997 Taiwanese television series debuts Category:1997 Taiwanese television series endings Category:1997 Chinese television series debuts Category:1997 Chinese television series endings Category:Television shows filmed in Shanghai Category:Television shows filmed in Tianjin Category:Television shows set in Shanghai Category:Television series set in the 1930s Category:Television series set in the 1940s Category:Mandarin-language television shows ",
