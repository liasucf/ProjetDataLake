The industry in the Hunedoara county is linked with the mining activity in the region. In the mountains, from ancient times, metals and coal have been exploited. Nowadays, there is one large industrial complex at Hunedoara owned by Mittal Steel. Also energy related enterprises are located in the county - one of the biggest thermoelectric plant is located at Mintia. The Jiu Valley, located in the south of the country, has been a major mining area throughout the second half of the 19th century and the 20th century, but many mines were closed down in the years following the collapse of the communist regime. The city of Hunedoara has also suffered significantly from the 1990s onwards - under communism it contained the largest steel works in Romania (until Gala\u021bi took the lead), but activity gradually diminished after the fall of communism due to the loss of the market. This was a blow to the overall prosperity of the town, which is now recovering through new investments. Agricultural activities also take place in Hunedoara county, which include livestock raising, and fruit and cereal cultivation. The county also has touristic potential, especially through the Dacian Fortresses of the Or\u0103\u0219tie Mountains and the Corvin Castle. The predominant industries in the county are: * Metallurgy. * Construction materials. * Textile industry. * Mining equipment. * Food industry. In the 1990s, a large amount of mines were closed down, leaving Hunedoara county with the highest unemployment rate in Romania, of 9.6%, in comparison to the national average of 5.5%. ==Tourism== Corvin Castle in Hunedoara, it is one of the largest castles in Europe and figures in a list of the seven wonders of Romania Fortress of Deva in Deva Retezat National Park and other picturesque regions makes it one of the most beautiful counties in Romania. Also there can be found Dacian and Roman complexes in the Or\u0103\u015ftie Mountains. The main tourist attractions in the county are: * The Dacian Fortresses of the Or\u0103\u0219tie Mountains - nowadays part of UNESCO World Heritage. * Colonia Augusta Ulpia Traiana Dacica Sarmizegetusa - the capital of the Roman province of Dacia. * The medieval edifices of Densu\u0219, Deva, Hunedoara, Sant\u0103maria-Orlea, Strei. * The Medieval Castle from Hunedoara * The Medieval Guard Tower from Crivadia ==Politics== The Hunedoara County Council, elected at the 2016 local government elections, is made up of 33 counselors, with the following party composition: {| class=\"wikitable\" ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Party ! style=\"background:#ccc\" | Seats ! style=\"background:#ccc\" colspan=\"18\" | Current County Council |- | | | Social Democratic Party | style=\"text-align: right\" | 18 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |- | | | National Liberal Party | style=\"text-align: right\" | 15 | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |} ==Administrative divisions== Deva Hunedoara Hunedoara County has 7 municipalities, 7 towns and 55 communes.
