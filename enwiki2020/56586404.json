    "text": "The BVG Class IK is a type of electrical multiple unit used on the Berlin U-Bahn. ==History== In August 2011, BVG announced an order of IK series to replace A3L71 stock which had reached the end of its working life. Two prototypes were bought from Stadler Rail with the remaining 38 units being delivered between 2015 and 2017. These trains are based on the Stadler Tango family of trams and light rail vehicles, but resemble and function like a full-fledged subway train. The number '1xxx' will be jumped into '18Yxxx' (where Y is the train car number). Due to regenerative braking the trains will recuperate up to 20% of the energy they require. In 2012, BVG had awarded the tender for Class IK to Stadler Pankow, which replaces the life-expired A3L71 trains, which consists of 24 trains. It costs 158 million Euros. It has options for 10 more trains. In May 2015, BVG nicknamed the train \"Icke\". In September 2015, the first two trains were delivered - 1025 and 1026, into U1 and U2 respectively. In July 2016, BVG has plans to buy 27 more trains. From July to December 2017, BVG has delivered 11 more trains under IK17. The trains are deployed to the bigger profile U5, which is due to shortage of trains. It is also called \"Class I\". The first train began running on 27 October 2017. From April 2018, BVG had bought 27 more trains and delivered under IK18, which replaces A3L71. In August 2017, U5 needs 20 more trains under IK19. This is because of various reasons as mentioned above. The Class D trains will be retired when the U55 extends to Alexanderplatz and this will be replaced by I-Class trains. ==References== ==External links== Category:Berlin U-Bahn Category:Electric multiple units of Germany ",
