She is one of the few African-American woman today producing records for indie artists, including herself. She is the owner of a production company, Winslow Productions.

She has also collaborated with a local visual artist, Kim Morris, for a concert and art show. Winslow's music is sold on Amazon.com and other online sales web sites, such as CDBaby.

This has been especially in England and Germany, where she has performed with Nick Katzman, as well as in Poland, Denmark, and Latin America.
