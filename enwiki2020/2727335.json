TKEP was founded on May 1, 1980 by the People's Liberation Army of Turkey-Unity in Struggle (THKO-MB). THKO-MB was the pro-Soviet faction that developed out of the crumbles of the original THKO. The general secretary of TKEP was Teslim T\u00f6re. T\u00f6re was jailed in 1993. TKEP set up a 'Kurdish Autonomous Organization'. In 1982 it developed into the Communist Party of Kurdistan (KKP). In 1990 KKP was separated from TKEP. In 1990 TKEP suffered a major split as the Communist Labour Party of Turkey/Leninist (TKEP/L) was founded. TKEP/L wanted to continue armed struggle. TKEP started entering legal politics. It organized an open movement, Emek, that in 1994 joined the (BSP), which would later become the Freedom and Solidarity Party (\u00d6DP) in 1996. In effect, through Emek, TKEP acted as a fraction within \u00d6DP. When \u00d6DP split in 2002, TKEP joined the new Socialist Labour Movement (SEH). ==See also== *List of illegal political parties in Turkey *Communist Party of Turkey (disambiguation), for other groups using similar names *Communist party (disambiguation) *List of Labour Parties ==References== Category:1980 establishments in Turkey Category:Communist parties in Turkey Category:Political parties established in 1980 Category:Banned political parties in Turkey Category:Banned communist parties ",
