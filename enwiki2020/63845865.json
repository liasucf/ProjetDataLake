This promoter sequence has one CpG island associated with it, with a CpG count of 78 Additionally, there are a number of transcription factor binding sites associated with this promoter sequence, such as RB1, HNF4A, ETS1, and RBL2. === Expression pattern === C14orf119 is expressed in 203 organs. The c14orf119 gene is expressed in a number of tissues and has the highest expression rates in cultured fibroblast cells, with a TPM of 75.63. There is notable decreased expression of c14orf119 in the following tissues, pancreas, bone marrow, brain, salivary glands, and the liver. Additionally, there is notable increased expression of c14orf119 in the adrenal gland, kidney, lung, prostate, thymus, white blood cells, lymph node, and thyroid. Finally, expression levels of c14orf119 decrease with the development of the kidney and increases with development of the stomach. == Transcript level regulation == There were no predicted enhancers associated with c14orf119. There were a number of stem loop formation predictions in both the 5' UTR and 3' UTR of c14orf119. === miRNA targeting === The miRNA binding sites found in the 3' UTR of c14orf119 include miR-489, miR-1872, and miR-4778-3p; however, there were no miRNA binding sites found in the 5' UTR of c14orf119. == Protein level regulation == ===Subcellular localization=== The c14orf119 protein is predicted to be located in the nucleus, with a reliability score of 55.5.

Conceptual translation of c14orf119, which reveals predicted post-translational modifications. ===Post-translational modifications=== There are a number of post-translational modifications of the c14orf119 protein, all of which are shown on the conceptual translation of c14orf119 in Figure 2. There are predicted ubiquitination sites at lysine residues at positions 128 and 139. There are predicted kinase-specific phosphorylation sites at serines at the following position in the c14orf119 protein sequence, 15, 19, 27, 32, 36, 81, 83, 90, and 121. Protein phosphorylation at serine residues can play critical roles in the regulation of protein function and the transmission of signals throughout the cell. There are two N-glycosylation sites at positions 25-27 and 48\u201350. This type of post- translational modification plays important roles in both the structure and function of some eukaryotic proteins. Additionally, there are predicted glycation of epsilon amino groups of lysines at the following positions, 40, 64, 69, and 139. Glycation is a process in which proteins react with reducing sugar molecules, which ultimately impairs the function and changes the characteristics of the protein. There are also predicted mammalian mucin type GalNAc-O-glycosylation sites at the following positions, 5, 6, 7, 12, 15, 19, and 24. GalNAc-type-O-glycosylation is the attachment of a sugar molecule to the oxygen atom of serine or threonine residues in a protein. O-glycans or the sugars added to the serine or threonine, have various functions, including allowing recognition of foreign material, providing cartilage and tendon flexibility, controlling cell metabolism, and trafficking cells in the immune system. There is a predicted SUMOylation sites at the lysine at position 139. SUMOylation is involved in transcriptional regulation, protein stability, apoptosis, nuclear-cytosolic transport, progression through the cell cycle, and response to stress. Finally, there are predicted O-GlcNAc sites at the serines at the following position in the c14orf119 protein, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 83. This post-translational modification can play various critical roles such as, progression through the cell cycle, response to cellular stress, protein turnover, and protein stability. == Regulation of expression == ===Epigenetic=== There are varying levels of H3K27ac, H3K4me1, and H3K4me3 throughout the c14orf119 gene. H3K4me1 has variation in signal strength among different cell lines, which may reflect differences of epigenetic landscapes in these cell lines. Additionally, there is a strong signal of H3K27ac across the majority of cell lines along the predicted promoter region. Finally, there is also a strong signal of H3K4me3 across the majority of the cell types along the predicted promoter region, with no signal variation across cell types. alt= ==Homology/evolution== C14orf119 is conserved in both vertebrates and invertebrates, however, it is not conserved in bacteria, archaea, trichoplax, plants or fungi. The c14orf119 gene is highly conserved in the mammalian orthologs, however, within the non-mammalian orthologs, there are various insertions, especially at the beginning and end of the gene. This gene does not contain any paralogs or paralogous domains.
