    "text": "\u00c7a Ira (French for \"It'll be fine\", subtitled \"There is Hope\") is an opera by Roger Waters. It comes in three acts and is a concept album. The album is based on the French libretto co-written by \u00c9tienne and Nadine Roda-Gil on the historical subject of the early French Revolution. \u00c7a Ira was released 26 September 2005, as a double CD album featuring baritone Bryn Terfel, soprano Ying Huang, and tenor Paul Groves. The album received mixed reviews, with critics praising the composition but criticising its plot and simplicity. ==History== Waters, known for his work in the English rock band Pink Floyd, was approached by friends \u00c9tienne Roda-Gil and his wife Nadine Delahaye in 1987, and asked to set their libretto to music. The initial version was completed and recorded by the end of 1988. After hearing it, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand was suitably impressed and urged the Paris Opera to stage it for the bicentennial of the revolution the following July. The opera directors, however, were resistant, according to Waters, because \"I was English, and I had been in a rock group.\" Starting in 1989, Waters rewrote the libretto in English. ==Critical reaction== \u00c7a Ira has received mixed reviews. The biggest criticisms were that the opera is too narrative, which makes staging very difficult \u2013 and, as a result, disrupts the flow of the piece. Others have complained that the score is too conventional and that Waters should have taken more risks with it. ==Performances== The first time any part of \u00c7a Ira was heard in public was on 16 October 2002 when the Overture was performed live at the Royal Albert Hall in London by the Royal Philharmonic Concert Orchestra, during a benefit gala for the Countryside Alliance. The next public airing (not a live performance, but a recording played through a sound system) took place in Malta on 1 May 2004, the night that Malta entered the European Union. An approximately 15-minute-long excerpt was heard by 80,000 people present at the waterfront of the Grand Harbour. The music was accompanied by a light show by Gert Hoff. The official premiere took place in Rome on 17 November 2005, in front of a sold-out crowd, and was followed the next evening by another performance. Both shows were praised for the high quality of music, vocal performances, and sound. The choir, orchestra, and soloists were complemented by a projection screen backdrop which displayed images (some photographed by Mark Holthusen) helping to tell the story. A full operatic performance took place on 25 August 2006 in Pozna\u0144, Poland, and was televised live on Poland's TVP. The project involved the same number of musicians from the concert performances in addition to more than 200 dancers from the Great Theatre in Pozna\u0144. There were also period elements of stage design (such as horses, carriages and war scenes with soldiers and stunt performers) and full costumes. Over 500 artists were involved, and the production reportedly cost in excess of \u20ac2 million. Performances were held in Kiev on 16 December, and at the Pozna\u0144 Opera House on 30 and 31 December 2006. In April 2008, the opera was performed, with the libretto in English, as part of the in Manaus, Brazil by the Amazonas Philharmonic Orchestra and choir. ===Dates=== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Date !City !Country !Venue !Ref. |- |16 October 2002 |London |England |Royal Albert Hall (Overture only; benefit for Countryside Alliance) | |- |17 & 18 November 2005 |Rome |Italy |Auditorium Parco della Musica | |- |26 August 2006 |Pozna\u0144 |Poland |Pozna\u0144 International Fair Grounds | |- |16 December 2006 |Kiev |Ukraine |International Expo Congress Center | |- |30 December 2006 \u2013 9 March 2007 (7 performances) |Pozna\u0144 |Poland |Pozna\u0144 Opera House | |- |15 \u2013 24 April 2008 (3 performances) |Manaus |Brazil |Amazonas Theatre (Amazonas Opera Festival) | |- |5 May 2008 |Den Haag |Netherlands |World Forum Theatre | |- |17 November 2010 |Rotterdam |Netherlands |Nieuwe Luxor Theater | |- |2 \u2013 9 May 2013 (4 performances) |S\u00e3o Paulo |Brazil |S\u00e3o Paulo Municipal Theatre | |- |13 August 2013 |Gothenburg |Sweden |G\u00f6taplatsen (Gothenburg Culture Festival) | |- |30 January 2015 |Nashville |USA |Schermerhorn Symphony Center || |} ==Recordings== The 2005 release was available in three formats: * A three-disc set with regular CD and Super Audio (SACD) stereo and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound versions.
