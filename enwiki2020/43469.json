    "text": "Karel \u010capek (; 9 January 1890 \u2013 25 December 1938) was a Czech writer, playwright and critic. He has become best known for his science fiction, including his novel War with the Newts (1936) and play R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots, 1920), which introduced the word robot.Oxford English Dictionary: robot n2 He also wrote many politically charged works dealing with the social turmoil of his time. Influenced by American pragmatic liberalism, he campaigned in favor of free expression and strongly opposed the rise of both fascism and communism in Europe. Though nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature seven times, \u010capek never received it. However, several awards commemorate his name, such as the Karel \u010capek Prize, awarded every other year by the Czech PEN Club for literary work that contributes to reinforcing or maintaining democratic and humanist values in society. He also played a key role in establishing the Czechoslovak PEN Club as a part of International PEN.Derek Sayer, The Coasts of Bohemia: A Czech History. Princeton University Press, 2000 , (p.22-3). \u010capek died on the brink of World War II as the result of a lifelong medical condition, but his legacy as a literary figure became well established after the war. == Life == House of \u010capek brothers in Prague 10, Vinohrady === Early life and education === Karel \u010capek was born in 1890 in the village of Mal\u00e9 Svato\u0148ovice in the Bohemian mountains. However, six months after his birth, the \u010capek family moved to their own house in \u00dapice. Karel \u010capek's father, Anton\u00edn \u010capek, worked as a doctor at the local textile factory. Anton\u00edn was a very active person; apart from his work as a doctor, he also co-funded the local museum and was a member of the town council. Despite opposing his father's materialist and positivist views, Karel \u010capek loved and admired his father, later calling him \u201ca good example... of the generation of national awakeners\u201d. Karel's mother, Bo\u017eena \u010capkov\u00e1, was a homemaker. Unlike her husband, she did not like life in the country, and she suffered from long- term depression. Despite that, she assiduously collected and recorded local folklore, such as legends, songs and stories. Karel was the youngest of three siblings. He would maintain an especially close relationship with his brother Josef, a highly successful painter, living and working with him throughout his adult life. His sister, Helena, was a talented pianist who later become a writer and published several memoirs about Karel and Josef. After finishing elementary school in \u00dapice, Karel moved with his grandmother to Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9, where he started attending high school. Two years later the school expelled him for taking part in an illegal students' club. \u010capek later described the club as a \"very non-murderous anarchist society\". After this incident he moved to Brno with his sister and attempted to finish high school there, but two years later he moved again, to Prague, where he finished high school at the Academic Grammar School in 1909. During his teenage years \u010capek became enamored with the visual arts, especially Cubism, which influenced his later writing. After graduating from high school, he studied philosophy and aesthetics in Prague at Charles University, but he also spent some time at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin and at the Sorbonne University in Paris. While still a university student he wrote some works on contemporary art and literature. He graduated with a doctorate of philosophy in 1915. === World War I and Interwar period === Exempted from military service due to the spinal problems that would haunt him his whole life, \u010capek observed World War I from Prague. His political views were strongly affected by the war, and as a budding journalist he began to write on topics like nationalism, totalitarianism and consumerism.James Sallis, Review of Karel Capek: Life and Work by Ivan Klima. The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, (pp. 37\u201340). Through social circles, the young author developed close relationships with many of the political leaders of the nascent Czechoslovak state, including Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, Czechoslovak patriot and the first President of Czechoslovakia, and his son Jan Masaryk, (p. 56) (p. 3) who would later become minister of foreign affairs. T. G. Masaryk was a regular guest at \u010capek's \"Friday Men\" garden parties for leading Czech intellectuals. \u010capek was also a member of Masaryk's Hrad political network. Their frequent conversations on various topics later served as the basis for \u010capek's book Talks with T. G. Masaryk. Tomb of Karel \u010capek and Olga Scheinpflugov\u00e1 at Vy\u0161ehrad cemetery \u010capek began his writing career as a journalist. With his brother Josef, he worked as an editor for the Czech paper N\u00e1rodn\u00ed listy (The National Newspaper) from October 1917 to April 1921. Upon leaving, he and Josef joined the staff of Lidov\u00e9 noviny (The People's Paper) in April 1921.Sarka Tobrmanova-Kuhnova, \"Introduction,\" to Karel \u010capek, \"Believe in People: the essential Karel \u010capek.\"London, Faber and Faber 2010, 2010, (p.xxiv-xxv). \u010capek's early attempts at fiction were short stories and plays for the most part written with his brother Josef. \u010capek's first international success was R.U.R., a dystopian work about a bad day at a factory populated with sentient androids. The play was translated into English in 1922, and was being performed in the UK and America by 1923. Throughout the 1920s, \u010capek worked in many writing genres, producing both fiction and non-fiction, but worked primarily as a journalist. In the 1930s, \u010capek's work focused on the threat of brutal national socialist and fascist dictatorships; by the mid-1930s, \u010capek had become \"an outspoken anti-fascist\". He also became a member of International PEN Club. Established, and was the first president of the Czechoslovak PEN Club. === Late life and death === In 1935 Karel \u010capek married actress Olga Scheinpflugov\u00e1, after a long acquaintance. In 1938 it became clear that the Western allies, namely France and the United Kingdom, would fail to fulfil the pre-war treaty agreements, and they refused to defend Czechoslovakia against Nazi Germany. Although offered the chance to go to exile in England, \u010capek refused to leave his country \u2013 even though the Nazi Gestapo had named him \"public enemy number two\". While repairing flood damage to his family's summer house in Star\u00e1 Hu\u0165, he contracted a common cold. As he had suffered all his life from spondyloarthritis and was also a heavy smoker, Karel \u010capek died of pneumonia, on 25 December 1938. Surprisingly, the Gestapo was not aware of his death. Several months later, just after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia, Nazi agents came to the \u010capek family house in Prague to arrest him. Upon discovering that he had already been dead for some time, they arrested and interrogated his wife Olga. His brother Josef was arrested in September and eventually died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in April 1945.Adam Roberts, \"Introduction\", to RUR & War with the Newts. London, Gollancz, 2011, (p.vi). Karel \u010capek and his wife are buried at the Vy\u0161ehrad cemetery in Prague. The inscription on the tombstone reads: \"Here would have been buried Josef \u010capek, painter and poet. Grave far away.\" == Writing == Karel \u010capek's handwriting Karel \u010capek wrote on a wide variety of subjects. His works are known for their precise description of reality. \u010capek is renowned for his work with the Czech language. He is known as a science fiction author, who wrote before science fiction became widely recognized as a separate genre. Many of his works also discuss ethical aspects of industrial inventions and processes already anticipated in the first half of the 20th century. These include mass production, nuclear weapons and intelligent artificial beings such as robots or androids. His most productive years were during The First Republic of Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938). \u010capek also expressed fear of social disasters, dictatorship, violence, human stupidity, the unlimited power of corporations, and greed. \u010capek tried to find hope, and the way out. From the 1930s onward, \u010capek's work became increasingly anti-fascist, anti-militarist, and critical of what he saw as \"irrationalism\".Darko Suvin, \"Capek, Karel\" in Twentieth- Century Science-Fiction Writers by Curtis C. Smith. St. James Press, 1986, (p.842-4). Ivan Kl\u00edma, in his biography of \u010capek, notes his influence on modern Czech literature, as well as on the development of Czech as a written language. \u010capek, along with contemporaries like Jaroslav Ha\u0161ek, spawned part of the early 20th-century revival in written Czech thanks to their decision to use the vernacular. Kl\u00edma writes, \"It is thanks to \u010capek that the written Czech language grew closer to the language people actually spoke\". \u010capek was also a translator, and his translations of French poetry into the language inspired a new generation of Czech poets. His other books and plays include detective stories, novels, fairy tales and theatre plays, and even a book on gardening.The Gardener's Year, illustrated by Josef \u010capek. First published in Prague, 1929. English edition London: George Allen & Unwin, 1931 His most important works attempt to resolve problems of epistemology, to answer the question: \"What is knowledge?\" Examples include Tales from Two Pockets, and the first book of the trilogy of novels Hordubal, Meteor, and An Ordinary Life. He also co-wrote (with his brother Josef) the libretto for Zden\u011bk Folprecht's opera L\u00e1sky hra osudn\u00e1 in 1922.\"Karel \u010capek\". The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians. 2nd edition, Oxford, 2001. After World War II, \u010capek's work was only reluctantly accepted by the communist government of Czechoslovakia, because during his life he had refused to accept communism as a viable alternative. He was the first in a series of influential non-Marxist intellectuals who wrote a newspaper essay in a series called \"Why I am not a Communist\".K. \u010capek, Why I am not a Communist? P\u0159\u00edtomnost December 4, 1924. In 2009 (70 years after his death), a book was published containing extensive correspondence by Karel \u010capek, in which the writer discusses the subjects of pacifism and his conscientious objection to military service with lawyer Jind\u0159ich Groag from Brno. Until then, only a portion of these letters were known.\u201eVoj\u00e1ku Vladim\u00edre...\u201c: Karel \u010capek, Jind\u0159ich Groag a odp\u00edra\u010di vojensk\u00e9 slu\u017eby, Nakladatelstv\u00ed Zden\u011bk Bauer, Prague 2009. Arthur Miller wrote in 1990: > I read Karel \u010capek for the first time when I was a college student long ago > in the Thirties. There was no writer like him...prophetic assurance mixed > with surrealistic humour and hard-edged social satire: a unique > combination...he is a joy to read.Miller, Arthur. \"Foreword\" to Toward the > Radical Center: A Karel Capek Reader, edited by Peter Kussi.Catbird Press, > 1990, . == Etymology of robot == R.U.R. theatrical poster, 1939 Karel \u010capek introduced and made popular the frequently used international word robot, which first appeared in his play R.U.R. in 1920. While it is frequently thought that he was the originator of the word, he wrote a short letter in reference to an article in the Oxford English Dictionary etymology in which he named his brother, painter and writer Josef \u010capek, as its actual inventor.Karel Capek \u2013 Who did actually invent the word \"robot\" and what does it mean? at capek.misto.czIvan Margolius,'The Robot of Prague', Newsletter, The Friends of Czech Heritage no. 17, Autumn 2017, pp. 3 - 6. https://czechfriends.net/images/RobotsMargoliusJul2017.pdf In an article in the Czech journal Lidov\u00e9 noviny in 1933, he also explained that he had originally wanted to call the creatures labo\u0159i (from Latin labor, work). However, he did not like the word, seeing it as too artificial, and sought advice from his brother Josef, who suggested roboti (robots in English). The word robot comes from the word robota. The word robota means literally \"corv\u00e9e\", \"serf labor\", and figuratively \"drudgery\" or \"hard work\" in Czech. It also means \"work\", \"labor\" in Slovak, archaic Czech, and many other Slavic languages (e.g., Bulgarian, Russian, Serbian, Polish, Macedonian, Ukrainian, etc.). It derives from the reconstructed Proto-Slavic word *orbota, meaning \"work, hard work, obligatory work for the king, or a short form used for plowing\". ==Awards and honors== The asteroid 1931 \u010capek, discovered by Lubo\u0161 Kohoutek was named after him. \u010capek received the Order of Tom\u00e1\u0161 Garrigue Masaryk, in memoriam, in 1991. == Selected works == === Plays === * 1920 \u2013 The Outlaw (Loupe\u017en\u00edk) * 1920 \u2013 R.U.R.
