    "text": "Eduard Hedvicek () was born in 1878 in Kojet\u00edn, Moravia, Austria-Hungary, now in the Czech Republic, and died 1947 in Vienna, Austria. He was the secretary of Engelbert Dollfu\u00df, the Austrian Chancellor before the Anschluss. On 25 July 1934 he unsuccessfully tried to prevent Dollfu\u00df's assassination by Otto Planetta. He testified at the trial of the murderers as a \"Crown\" (prosecution) witness and was awarded the Gold Medal of Merit Signum Laudis by the Austrian government for his heroic efforts. He was imprisoned by the Nazis after Germany annexed Austria. His imprisonment was a matter of personal revenge for Ernst Kaltenbrunner, the SS-Obergruppenf\u00fchrer and Chef der Reichssicherheitshauptamtes of the Nazi government and a famous Austrian Nazi, who himself was involved in Dollfu\u00df's assassination and was for this and other crimes hanged after the war. Eduard Hedvicek died after the war in 1947. == Publications == * Assassination in Vienna, Walter B.
