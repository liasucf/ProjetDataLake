During the German occupation she wrote in the occupation press. In 1942 she won the anti-typhoid art competition announced by the General Government's propaganda department (from the Nazi propaganda poster about Jews). Her art entitled The quarantine was staged by the Traveling Theater throughout the General Government. Art had an anti- Semitic character: emphasizing the alleged handicap of a lower race (Jews, Roma) and urged the surrender of Jews in hiding to the occupation authorities. In 1944, after the Warsaw Uprising, Rapacka moved to Bregenz, Austria. After the fall of the Third Reich, she obtained asylum in Britain with the help of her brother. ==References== Category:1901 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Polish collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Polish expatriates in the United Kingdom Category:Polish stage actresses Category:Actresses from Warsaw ",
