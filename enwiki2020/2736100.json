    "text": "Pedro Borb\u00f3n Rodriguez (December 2, 1946 - June 4, 2012) was a Dominican professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball as a right- handed relief pitcher from through , most notably as a member of the Cincinnati Reds dynasty that won four National League pennants and two World Series championships between 1970 and 1976. Borb\u00f3n was known for his durability, appearing in more games than any other pitcher in the National League between 1970 and 1978. He also played for the California Angels, San Francisco Giants and, the St. Louis Cardinals. In 2010, Borb\u00f3n was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. ==Early life== Borb\u00f3n was born in Santa Cruz de Mao, Dominican Republic, to Ram\u00f3n Jimenez and Ana Teresa Borb\u00f3n. He was signed as an amateur free agent by the St. Louis Cardinals organization in 1964 and two years later was drafted out of the Cardinals organization by the California Angels. ==Major League career== Borb\u00f3n made his Major League debut on April 9, 1969, for the California Angels in a 7\u20133 home win over the Seattle Pilots. He entered the game in the fifth inning in relief of Andy Messersmith, hurling three scoreless innings with two strikeouts and allowing only two hits as he also earned his first career win. He pitched a total of 22 games for the Angels that season, with a record of 2\u20133 with a 6.15 earned run average. In November 1969 he was part of a five-player trade that sent him to the Cincinnati Reds. He proved to be one of the most effective and durable relievers in baseball for the Big Red Machine; he was in the top five in the National League in games pitched in six consecutive seasons from 1972 to 1977. He pitched at least 121 innings in each of those six seasons, and was part of a tandem of reliable Reds relievers along with Clay Carroll (who was with the Reds through the 1976 season). No National League pitcher appeared in more games from 1970 to 1978 than Borb\u00f3n. Borb\u00f3n and Carroll, along with relievers Wayne Granger, Will McEnaney, and Rawly Eastwick, anchored a bullpen that enabled Reds manager Sparky Anderson to change pitchers frequently, earning him the nickname \"Captain Hook.\" Of Borb\u00f3n, Reds teammate Baseball Hall of Famer Tony P\u00e9rez said, \"He may have been the most critical part of that great bullpen because he was such a rubber arm. He'd give two, three innings \u2013 whatever you needed. He could pitch every night. And he wasn't intimidated by anything. I always enjoyed his company on and off the field. He was a great guy.\" Borb\u00f3n also excelled in the postseason. In four National League Championship Series, he was 1\u20130 with a 1.26 ERA in 10 games, of which he finished seven. He was especially effective in the 1976 National League Championship Series, pitching 4 scoreless innings of relief in a three-game Reds' sweep. He also pitched well in three World Series, pitching 10 games and going 0\u20131 with a 3.86 ERA as the Reds were world champions in 1975 and 1976. After playing the entire decade of the 1970s with the Reds, he was traded midway through the 1979 season to the San Francisco Giants, where he pitched the remainder of the season. Shortly before the 1980 season, he was released and signed by the St. Louis Cardinals, for which he pitched ten games before he was released, signalling the end of his career. Besides being known as a very good pitcher, the licensed barber was also a colorful character. A local Cincinnati urban legend claims that Borb\u00f3n, incensed about being traded from the Reds in 1979, placed a voodoo losing curse on the Reds until the last member of the Reds front office management left in 1990. The Reds did, in fact, win the World Series that year (and have not played in one since). In 2002, Borb\u00f3n admitted that this was a hoax. Another notable story involving Borb\u00f3n occurred in 1973. After a bench clearing brawl, Borbon started to fight with New York Mets pitcher, Buzz Capra. Following the fracas, Borb\u00f3n accidentally placed a Mets hat on his head. After realizing what he had done, Borb\u00f3n removed the hat and ripped a piece of it off with his teeth. A year later during a nasty brawl with the Pittsburgh Pirates, Borb\u00f3n pinned Pirates' hurler Daryl Patterson to the turf, began pulling out clumps of his hair and bit him in the side. Patterson lost a piece of flesh in the incident and received a precautionary tetanus shot. He also bit a bouncer on the chest during an altercation at a nightclub in Cincinnati called West Side Story in Cincinnati's Monfort Heights neighborhood. Borb\u00f3n was referenced in a joke in the movie Airplane! As Ted Striker's inner-dialogue is heard echoing in his mind, it resembles a stadium public address announcement, and he is heard thinking \"Pinch hitting for Pedro Borb\u00f3n...Manny Mota...Mota...Mota\"This never happened in a real big-league game, as the two never actually played for the same MLB team at the same time; however Borbon and Mota did play together for the Tigres del Licey in the Domincan Winter League for several seasons. \"He was always talking about that,\" his son said. \"A lot of people remember him by that. He liked that.\" ==After baseball== Furthering his reputation as a workhorse, even after retiring from major league baseball, he continued to pitch consistently and well in his native Dominican Republic in winter ball and in semi-pro leagues in his adopted hometown in Texas. During the Major League Baseball strike of 1994\u201395, Borbon was a member of the Cincinnati Reds replacement team. Borb\u00f3n was inducted into Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame in 2010. He continued to return to Cincinnati for events such as the team's annual RedsFest and for the annual Reds Legends baseball camps in Ohio in which he would sometimes team up to instruct youths with his former fellow Reds reliever Clay Carroll. Borb\u00f3n's son, Pedro Borb\u00f3n, Jr. (born in 1967), pitched in the majors for nine seasons (1992\u20132003) for four teams. Borb\u00f3n died of cancer at age 65 on June 4, 2012 at his home in Pharr, Texas. He was cremated, and there was no memorial service. He was survived by his wife Maria Borbon; son Pedro Francisco Borb\u00f3n; two daughters Gabriela Michelle Borb\u00f3n and Maria Jacqueline Borb\u00f3n married to Major League Baseball Player outfielder Carlos Peguero; Five grandsons Anthony Romeo Borb\u00f3n, Pedro D. Borb\u00f3n, Lennox Ezequiel Peguero, Robert Tiger Sanchez, Carlos Optimus Peguero; Two granddaughters Katelyn Borb\u00f3n, Chlo\u00e9 Juliette Sanchez, two brothers Porfirio and Rafael Borb\u00f3n; and a sister Maria de Jesus Borb\u00f3n. ==References== ==External links== , or Retrosheet, or Baseball Reference (Minor and Mexican Leagues), or SABR Biography Project Category:1946 births Category:2012 deaths Category:Broncos de Reynosa players Category:California Angels players Category:Caribbean Series players Category:Cedar Rapids Cardinals players Category:Cincinnati Reds players Category:Deaths from cancer in Texas Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Mexico Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Indianapolis Indians players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:Mexican League baseball pitchers Category:Modesto Reds players Category:Paris Dragons baseball players Category:People from Pharr, Texas Category:People from Santa Cruz de Mao Category:San Francisco Giants players Category:St. Louis Cardinals players Category:St. Petersburg Cardinals players Category:Tigres del Licey players Category:Winter Haven Super Sox players ",
