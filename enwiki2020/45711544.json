    "text": "Nudnik was a Czechoslovak/Czech animated film series directed by Gene Deitch, produced by William Lawrence Snyder, and distributed by Paramount Studios. Twelve shorts were released during 1965 and 1967. The character's tagline is \"Whatever can go wrong with Nudnik, will go wrong.\" The first cartoon of the series, Here's Nudnik, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1965. Nudnik was based on a previous Terrytoons character, Foofle, who appeared from 1959 to 1960. ==Synopsis== Nudnik contains only one major character, simply named Nudnik (or \"Yaramaz Nudnik\", as the Turkish DVDs refer to him). He cannot do anything right; when he does something, it usually ends with disastrous results, and usually gets him in trouble. At first the idea was for each short to be scored with melancholy jazz music, which was done for the first cartoon. However, the studio wasn't pleased with the musical choice, and they made Gene use more upbeat music. The song that was used most often was \"Wrap Your Troubles In Dreams\", used both for the opening sequence and as a general theme of sorts for the character himself. Though there were other characters, they were unnamed, such as the fat woman, the dog, the cop, and the thief. There was something of an unspoken rule that everything in the world hates Nudnik, further adding to the mayhem. ==Shorts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Title !! Release Date !!

It also had 11 bumpers with all new animation, each one being about 30 seconds long, according to the IMDb listing, Jules Feiffer was a writer for the series, so it is most likely that he wrote for the bumpers.
