    "text": "The Awesome Snakes were a two-person punk rock band from Minneapolis, Minnesota, featuring Annie \"Sparrows\" Holoien (The Soviettes, The God Damn Doo Wop Band) on bass and Danny Henry (The Soviettes, France Has The Bomb, International Robot) on drums. The band was formed as a side project for both members while they were still playing with The Soviettes. Their instrumentation is just bass and drums, with the bass played through a fender blues deville on high distortion. ==History== In 2004, a cassette-only label, Home Taping Is Killing the Record Industry, released the debut release by Awesome Snakes. In July 2006, Crustacean Records issued the Awesome Snakes' full-length debut CD, Venom. It featured fifteen tracks recorded in much higher fidelity than the debut cassette by their friend Ross and mastered by Dave Gardener and features a guest appearance by Twin Cities MC P.O.S.. Awesome Snakes appeared on the Crustacean Records DVD \"Drown Out The Daylights\", which was released in July 2008. Their final release was a digital-only four track EP entitled Snake Cake, released on Ass Records on October 12, 2009. The duo's last show as Awesome Snakes was on March 19, 2010 in St. Paul, MN; the same night as their old band The Soviettes' release show for their Rarities album. ==Members== * Annie Holoien (aka \"Annie Awesome\") - bass, vocals.
