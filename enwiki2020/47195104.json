The single elimination tournament was played at Rec Hall in University Park, Pennsylvania during May 2006. UCLA defeated Penn State in the final match, 3\u20130 (30\u201327, 30\u201327, 30\u201327), to win their nineteenth national title. The Bruins (26\u201312) were coached by Al Scates. This was Scates' final title before retiring in 2012; Scates was with the Bruins for all 19 of their championships. UCLA's Steve Klosterman was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Klosterman, along with six other players, comprised the All Tournament Team. ==Qualification== Until the creation of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all NCAA men's volleyball programs, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
