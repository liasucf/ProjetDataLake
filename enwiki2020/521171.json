The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is , and the equivalent X-SAMPA symbol is `p`. ==Features== Features of the voiceless bilabial stop: == Varieties == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

(See voiced velar stop for another such gap.) This is an areal feature of the \"circum-Saharan zone\" (Africa north of the equator, including the Arabian peninsula). It is not known how old this areal feature is, and whether it might be a recent phenomenon due to Arabic as a prestige language (Arabic lost its in prehistoric times), or whether Arabic was itself affected by a more ancient areal pattern. It is found in other areas as well; for example, in Europe, Proto-Celtic and Old Basque are both reconstructed as having but no . Nonetheless, the sound is very common cross-linguistically. Most languages have at least a plain , and some distinguish more than one variety. Many Indo- Aryan languages, such as Hindustani, have a two-way contrast between the aspirated and the plain (also transcribed as in extensions to the IPA). ===Examples=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! colspan=\"2\"|Language !!
