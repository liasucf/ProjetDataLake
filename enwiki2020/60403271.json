    "text": "Judah L\u00f6b Davidovich (1855, in Vilna \u2013 1 January 1898, in Odessa) was a Russian Hebrew writer and translator. After serving in the Imperial Russian Army, Davidovich studied surgery, but failed to find work as a feldsher. After a futile attempt to make a career as a singer, he settled in Odessa about 1885 as a private teacher. There he was influenced by Ahad Ha'am to turn his attention to Hebrew literature. Davidovich translated into Hebrew Herbert Spencer's essay on education, with preface and explanatory notes, published by A\u1e25iasaf under the name Ha-\u1e24innukh (Warsaw, 1894). He also wrote two articles on educational subjects in Ha-Shiloa\u1e25 (vols. i., ii.). ==References== Category:1855 births Category:1898 deaths Category:English\u2013Hebrew translators Category:Imperial Russian Jews Category:Writers from Vilnius ",
