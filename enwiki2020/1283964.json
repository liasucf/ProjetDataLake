Schmidt was appointed Dean of the law school in 1984, where he served until 1986, before accepting the offer to be President of Yale University. ==Yale University== Schmidt was the President of Yale University from 1986 to 1992. In academics, he instituted several new and successful programs, but his attempt to reduce faculty stirred up controversy. He anticipated the need to repair the University's physical infrastructure, which had fallen into disrepair, but widespread renovation was not carried out until the arrival of Schmidt's successor Rick Levin. Most impressively, Schmidt raised over a billion dollars for Yale. a faster-growing endowment than at any other university. Answering faculty reports of poor writing abilities among incoming freshmen, Schmidt convened a committee to review the issues, and after reflecting upon committee's recommendations, he made significant changes to the writing programs, such as instituting writing tutors at each of the residential colleges, a program which remains today. Under Schmidt's leadership, Yale established the Ethics, Politics and Economics (EP&E;) program,Raymond Carlson, Ten presidents and 130 years at the University , Yale Daily News, January 28, 2008{} which was modeled on the University of Oxford's PP&E; program, and a number of interdisciplinary programs, including environmental sciences, molecular biology, and international studies.New York City Mayor's Press Office, Release #201-98, May 6, 1998 Schmidt questioned the validity of other academic programs, although his proposal to reduce the faculty by 11-percent was not well received.

Brady, a vice president of Nomura Securities International, Incorporated; Richard T. Roberts, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Housing Preservation and Development; and Richard Schwartz, president and CEO of Opportunity America and special assistant to Mayor Giuliani. A year later, on June 7, 1999, the task force report entitled \"An Institution Adrift\" characterized the \"moribund conditions\" of a public University system \"caught in a spiral of decline\". Schmidt and his colleagues called for a complete restructuring of the City University of New York system. Specifically, Schmidt advised CUNY to organize into a unified university system, rather than continue under a system of governance in which each of its 17-campuses runs itself as a separate fiefdom. Similarly, in a section on financial planning, Schmidt advised the University overhaul the passivity of CUNY's central Executive Administration. Four years later, Governor George E. Pataki appointed Benno C. Schmidt Jr. to the position of chairman of the City University of New York Board of Trustees. In 2003, Schmidt was reappointed to the position of Chair. Prior, Schmidt served CUNY's Board in the positions of Vice Chairperson, from 1999 to 2003. In 2006, Governor George Pataki reappointed Schmidt to the position of Chair another seven-year term. In 2016, financial impropriety by the former City College of New York, and an investigation conducted by the New York State Office of the Inspector General, concluding the City University of New York financial system was \u201cripe for abuse\u201d due to a lack of proper oversight of decentralized funds, resulting in \"financial waste and abuse,\" prompting Governor Andrew Cuomo to replace Schmidt with a new chairmen, and most of the CUNY Board of Trustees with a new bloc of politically prominent trustees. ===Other professional and civic service=== Schmidt has served as Director/Trustee of the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation; chairman of board for the Council on Aid to Education - a not-for- profit providing colleges and universities assessment and strategic planning services; National Humanities Center (NHC), and American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as well as an advisory board member of the Happy Hearts Fund, a nonprofit focused on rapidly rebuilding schools in disaster-stricken areas. Schmidt serves as Vice Chairman on the board of directors of Edison Schools, Inc., after serving as the organization's chairman from 1992 to 2007. In 2014, Schmidt delivered a talk at Yale commencement, entitled \"Governance for a New Era\", or \"The Schmidt Report\", and subtitled \"A Blueprint for Higher Education Trustees\", in which the former University president harshly criticizes passive governance over the nation's public and smaller private institutions, which serve the vast majority of American college students. Schmidt issues a challenge to higher education leadership to step up and take responsibility for doing more to increase academic standards and graduation rates. ==Professional recognition== In 1989 he was appointed Honorary Member of the Order of Australia (AM), for his service to the arts and agricultural development in Australia.
