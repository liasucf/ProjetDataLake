    "text": "Lucas Mauricio Acosta (born 12 March 1995) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a goalkeeper for Lan\u00fas. ==Career== Acosta started his career in 2013 with Primera Divisi\u00f3n side Belgrano. He appeared on the bench for twelve games in two seasons, prior to making his professional debut in the Copa Sudamericana on 18 September against Lan\u00fas; an encounter Belgrano lost 5\u20131. He made his next appearance and league bow on 11 March 2017, a day before his 22nd birthday, in a defeat to San Lorenzo. Acosta had been selected forty- seven times by the end of 2017\u201318, though the goalkeeper didn't feature across 2018\u201319. In August 2019, Belgrano revealed a contractual dispute was ongoing with Acosta; as a deal with Col\u00f3n was agreed, but Acosta rejected the move. In July 2020, after continued issues with Belgrano that stopped him being selected, Acosta departed to Lan\u00fas following the expiration of his contract. ==Career statistics== . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Club statistics |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"9\"|Belgrano |2013\u201314 |rowspan=\"7\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2014 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2015 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||1Appearance(s) in the Copa Sudamericana||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2016 |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |16||0||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0||17||0 |- |2017\u201318 |27||0||2||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||29||0 |- |2018\u201319 |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera B Nacional |0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !43!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!47!!0 |- |rowspan=\"1\"|Lan\u00fas |2020\u201321 |rowspan=\"1\"|Primera Divisi\u00f3n |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !43!!0!!3!!0!!0!!0!!1!!0!!0!!0!!47!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina Category:Argentine footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Belgrano footballers Category:Club Atl\u00e9tico Lan\u00fas footballers ",
