    "text": "You Need a Mess of Help to Stand Alone is the first compilation album released by British band Saint Etienne, released in 1993. It compiles singles and b-sides released by the group during the period 1990 to 1993, most notably the non-album singles; \"Kiss and Make Up\" (1990), \"Speedwell\" (1991), \"Join Our Club/People Get Real\" (1992) and \"Who Do You Think You Are\" (1993). The compilation's title is derived from the song of the same name by the Beach Boys. Receiving good reviews, the compilation was released in November 1993 as on CD, Cassette and LP formats. Artwork was designed by Anthony Sweeney with photography by Aude Prieur and James Fry. Before its release as a standalone compilation album, the disc was originally packaged in a 2CD limited edition reissue of So Tough (HVNLP6CDX).
