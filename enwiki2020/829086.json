It has an area of 42.18 km\u00b2 and c. 9,600 inhabitants (2013). ==History== In 1775 Simon August, Count of Lippe-Detmold issued a writ of lease (Meierbrief) for the area of today's Augustdorf in favour of August Simon Stru\u00df, permitting him to establish a settlement (colony) at D\u00f6ren hill. In 1779 the actual development plan for the settlement was decided, but the place hardly developed. In 1780 the settlement at D\u00f6ren consisted of only four tiny thatched huts. In 1789 the settlement was named in honour of Count Simon August. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Lippe Category:Principality of Lippe ",
