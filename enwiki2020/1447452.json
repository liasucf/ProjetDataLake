Built by Kawasaki K\u014dk\u016bki K\u014dgy\u014d K.K. for the Imperial Japanese Army, it saw combat service in Manchukuo and in North China during the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War. Its reporting name given by the Allies was \"Perry\". ==Design and development== Kawasaki Ki-10-II KAI prototypeThe Ki-10 was designed by Japanese aeronautical engineer Takeo Doi, who had succeeded Richard Vogt as chief designer for Kawasaki. The design was in response to a requirement issued by the Imperial Japanese Army for a new fighter, and was the winner of a competition against Nakajima's Ki-11. Although the low-wing monoplane offered by Nakajima was more advanced, the Army preferred the more maneuverable biplane offered by Kawasaki. In order to overcome the speed disadvantage the Kawasaki team used a metal three-blade propeller in the third prototype, while flush-head rivets were used in an attempt to reduce drag. The Kawasaki design had sesquiplane (unequal-span) wings, braced by struts, and with upper-wing ailerons. The structure was of all-metal construction, which was then fabric-covered. Armament consisted of two 7.7 mm (.303 in) Type 89 machine guns, synchronized to fire through the propeller. The initial production version was powered by a liquid-cooled Kawasaki Ha9-IIa V-12. ==Operations== The Ki-10 was deployed in Manchukuo (Manchuria) and in the initial campaigns of the Second Sino-Japanese War in northern China. On September 21, 1937, Major Hiroshi Miwa, formerly hired as a military flight instructor for Marshall Chang's Fengtian army air corps and well known in the Chinese military aviation circles of the time, commanded a flight of 7 Ki-10 fighters of the 1st Daitai-16th Hiko Rentai, on an escort of 14 Mitsubishi Ki-2 bombers to attack the city of Taiyuan where they encountered Chinese air force V-65C Corsairs and Curtiss Hawk IIs, shooting down a few, but Major Miwa himself was shot down and fatally wounded by Captain Chan Kee-Wong, commander of the 28th Pursuit Squadron of the 5th Pursuit Group flying a Curtiss Hawk.http://surfcity.kund.dalnet.se/china_kee- wong.htm By the time of the Nomonhan Incident (Battles of Khalkhin Gol) in 1939, the Ki-10 had become largely obsolete, and was being superseded by the Nakajima Ki-27.https://ww2db.com/aircraft_spec.php?aircraft_model_id=77 At the beginning of the Pacific War, the Ki-10 was retired to training and secondary missions, but later returned to front-line service, performing short-range patrol and reconnaissance missions in Japan proper and China in January\u2013February 1942. ==Variants== Another picture of the Kawasaki Ki-10-II KAI prototype data from Japanese Aircraft of the Pacific War * Ki-10 : Prototype for Imperial Japanese Army Air Force (4 built in early 1935). * Ki-10-I (Army Fighter Type 95-I): Initial production version (300 built December 1935 - October 1937) * Ki-10-II : Prototype of modified Mark I, increased in length (1 built May 1936) * Ki-10-II (Army Fighter Type 95-2): Improved production version (280 built June 1937 - December 1938) * Ki-10-I KAI : Prototype Ki-10-I with modifications to engine and radiator (1 built October 1936) * Ki-10-II KAI : Prototype - Aerodynamic modification of Ki-10-II, now designated Ki-10-I-KAI, with Kawasaki Ha9-IIb engine (2 built November 1937) Total production: 588 units ==Operators== ; * Imperial Japanese Army Air Force ** 1st Rentai IJAAF ** 4th Rentai IJAAF ** 5th Rentai IJAAF ** 6th Rentai IJAAF ** 8th Rentai IJAAF ** 11th Rentai IJAAF ** 13th Rentai IJAAF ** 4th Sentai IJAAF ** 9th Sentai IJAAF ** 33rd Sentai IJAAF ** 59th Sentai IJAAF ** 64th Sentai IJAAF ** 77th Sentai IJAAF ** Akeno Fighter Training School ==Specifications (Ki-10-II)== ==See also== ==References== ;Notes ;Bibliography * * * ==External links== * Rickard, J (9 March 2010), Kawasaki Ki-10 'Perry' * Kawasaki (Ki-10) Type 95 \u2018Perry\u2019 at surfcity.kund.dalnet.se * Debut in the Chinese Sky, Fighter \u201cKawasaki\u201d Ki-10 at j-aircraft.com Category:Sesquiplanes Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Ki-10, Kawasaki Ki-010 Category:Aircraft first flown in 1935 ",
