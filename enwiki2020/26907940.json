On December 12, 1922, the Lady Blues joined the Ladies Ontario Hockey Association and paid dues of eleven dollars (six dollars association fee, five dollars one time fee).Coast to Coast:Hockey in Canada to the Second World War, p.137, Edited by John Chi-Kit Wong, University of Toronto Press, 2009, The Lady Blues were the LOHA Provincial Champions in 1924.Coast to Coast:Hockey in Canada to the Second World War, p.150, Edited by John Chi-Kit Wong, University of Toronto Press, 2009, In 1925, the Lady Blues withdrew from the LOHA, and the reason was certain unsatisfactory aspects of competition.Bruce Kidd, The Struggle for Canadian Sport, Toronto:University of Toronto Press, 1996, p.103 There were issues as to the acceptable definition of womanhood. In 1993, (although the Lady Blues won 13 of the last 15 provincial championships), a task force recommended that the University of Toronto cut the team for financial reasons.http://webapps.utsc.utoronto.ca/ose/story.php?id=349 Justine Blainey, a member of the team, organized a \"Save the Team\" night that raised over $8,000. She personally called 100 alumni during a one-week fundraising blitz. Blainey had previously earned national recognition as she endured five different court cases before finally having her case heard by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1986 because the Metro Toronto Hockey League denied her the opportunity to play hockey for them in 1981.http://www.dynamicchiropractic.ca/pdf_out/DynamicChiropractic.ca-The- Justine-Blainey-Story-1285010719.pdf During the 2000-01 regular season, the Lady Blues accumulated an undefeated record with 22 wins and no losses or ties. They outscored all opponents by a 114-14 margin. In the OUA playoffs, the Lady Blues defeated Toronto rival York University by a 4-1 mark and shut out Laurier 5-0 to win the OUA championship. Heading into the 2001 National Championships, the Lady Blues were seeded Number 1 overall. The Lady Blues first game was a 12-1 whitewash of the host school Calgary Dinos. In the semifinal, the Lady Blues would proceed to eliminate the McGill Martlets by a 4-1 tally. The championship game was a closer affair, with the Lady Blues besting the Regina Cougars in a 4-3 triumph. It was the Lady Blues first national championship in CIS women\u2019s hockey. Of note, the Varsity Blues managed to defeat every other top team in the nation that season. The teams that were defeated included Regina, Concordia, Alberta, McGill and Saskatchewan, as the Lady Blues finished with an overall win loss record of 35-0-0.http://www.varsityblues.ca/news/2011/1/31/WHOCKEY_0131111909.aspx ==Notable games== Blues player 2014. *On February 25, 1997, a little-known rule denies the Blues\u2019 their second consecutive title. The OWIAA gold medal game in Waterloo, Ontario resulted in a controversial finish. Lady Blues player Jayna Hefford scored 23 seconds into overtime in the OWIAA gold medal game against the York Yeowomen at Waterloo Memorial Arena. The Lady Blues believed they had claimed the provincial championship. :OWIAA league rules indicated that the first five-minute overtime session in a playoff game must be played in its entirety (as a regular period). It was advised that the game would continue after Hefford's goal. York University (known as the Yeowomen at the time) tied the game with 1:47 left in the first overtime. Sari Krooks broke in on the right wing and scored on Keely Brown. :A second overtime period began and this overtime period was classified as sudden death. York skater Shanley White took advantage of a Lady Blues clearing error. She scored on the error and York prevailed by a 3-2 mark in double overtime to claim the OWIAA gold medal. The Lady Blues loss ended the Blues' undefeated season, and gave York its first championship in 10 years. :The two played a scoreless opening period, but the Lady Blues scored ten seconds into the second period when Hefford passed to linemate Laura Schuler, and beat goalie Debra Ferguson. York tied the game 26 seconds into the third period which led into overtime. Despite winning the silver medal, the Lady Blues ended its regular season with a 13-0-2 record. In the semifinal, the Lady Blues defeated the Guelph Gryphons by a 4-1 tally. In that game, Laura Schuler had a hat trick, while Hefford added three assists.http://www.whockey.com/team/blues/article/The_Varsity_970225.txt *On February 11, 2000, the Ontario University Athletics women's ice hockey program saw its longest game take place. The University of Toronto's Rhonda Mitchell scored on a 35-foot slap shot. It was the 5:07 mark of the eighth period and the Varsity Blues defeated the York Lions women's ice hockey program. Although the victory allowed the U of T to advance to the OUA gold medal game, it was the longest in the history of Canadian women's hockey. The game lasted over five hours and ten minutes. York's player of the game was goaltender Debra Ferguson, as she valiantly made 63 saves over 125 minutes. ==Lady Blues in Olympic hockey== {|class=\"wikitable\" width=\"80%\" |- align=\"center\" style=\"background:#27408B;color:#74B4FA;\" | Player || Position || School ||Event || Result |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Lesley Reddon||Goaltender|| University of Toronto || 1998 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Lori Dupuis||Forward|| University of Toronto || 1998 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Lori Dupuis||Forward|| University of Toronto || 2002 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Gold |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Jayna Hefford||Forward|| University of Toronto || 1998 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Jayna Hefford||Forward|| University of Toronto || 2002 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Gold |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Jayna Hefford||Forward|| University of Toronto || 2006 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Jayna Hefford||Forward|| University of Toronto || 2010 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Gold |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Laura Schuler||Forward|| University of Toronto || 1998 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Vicky Sunohara||Forward|| University of Toronto || 1998 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"silver\"|Silver |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Vicky Sunohara||Forward|| University of Toronto || 2002 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Gold |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |Vicky Sunohara||Forward|| University of Toronto || 2006 Winter Olympics||bgcolor=\"#FFCC00\"|Gold |- align=\"center\" bgcolor=\"\" |} ==Marion Hilliard== The Marion Hilliard Award is named in honour of former Toronto Lady Blues player Marion Hilliard.
