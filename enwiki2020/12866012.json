It featured a new smaller body with no reduction in interior space. Stylistically, the XD was strongly influenced by the European Ford Granada Mark II of 1977. The only common components shared between the Granada and the Falcon however were the headlights. Unlike its predecessor, the XD range did not include a 2-door Hardtop model. The base engine offered in the XD range was a 3.3-litre six cylinder engine. Other choices were a six cylinder, a eight cylinder and a \"Cleveland\" eight cylinder engine. Transmissions available were a three speed column shift manual for six cylinder versions, the popular four speed manual floor shift, and the most popular transmission choice, the three speed automatic with the selector lever located either on the steering column or the floor.Ford XD Falcon Retrieved from www.uniquecarsandparts.com.au on 5 June 2009 All engines had a carburettor with electronic ignition. In June 1980 the 3.3 and 4.1 inline six's iron cylinder head was replaced by an alloy head.

He set up an aftermarket body styling company with Bob McWilliam, but remained a silent partner to avoid conflicts with Ford management. Between 1976 and 1978 they produced front splitters and rear spoilers for XB and XC Falcon Hardtop race cars. Draper, who was a Senior Designer for the XD-XF Falcon, purchased the rights to the \"HO\" nameplate, as \"homologated options\". Draper then designed an aero kit and tested scale models of an XD Falcon in Ford's wind tunnel. This became known as \"XD Phase 5\". The Confederation of Australian Motor Sport implemented a few changes (including using Dick Johnson's rear spoiler rather than the Phase 5 wing) to the cars for homologation and HO/Phase Auto then produced the 25 cars required to allow the XD to race as a Group C Touring Car. Dick Johnson and John French won the 1981 James Hardie 1000 driving a Ford Falcon (XD) Dick Johnson drove a Group C Falcon XD, commonly called \"Tru-Blu\" (due to the cars blue paint and the name of the steel products from the main sponsor - Palmer Tube Mills), to win the 1981 and 1982 Australian Touring Car Championships.www.shannons.com.auSam Hollier, Street Fords Issue's 86 and 111 Johnson and co-driver John French also won the 1981 James Hardie 1000 driving an XDAustralian Motor Racing Yearbook, 1981/82 when race was stopped after a multi-car accident on lap 121 of 163. For the first time in the history of the Bathurst 1000, the race officials declared the race over as more than 2/3 had been completed. French was driving the car at the time of the accident and was well clear in first place, gradually increasing his lead on the second placed XD Falcon of Bob Morris (co-driver John Fitzpatrick). The Falcon was rated at and is now part of the David Bowden collection. Allan Moffat also raced an XD Falcon in the 1980 Bathurst 1000 when delays in approval of his Mazda RX-7 meant he would have to wait until the following season in 1981. Ford Australia had announced that they would not be taking part in racing due to a disagreement with CAMS over homologating the XD, which left AMR with no program and budget. By the end of the ATCC, Moffat still had no vehicle and it eventuated that he might miss the upcoming Bathurst 1000. Six weeks out from the race, Moffat put together a deal to run a yellow XD Falcon. Lack of time limited its development and Moffat had to essentially use the practice sessions at Bathurst to test the car. Recurring oil problems with the dry-sump system could not be eliminated during practice and on race day the vehicle was a DNF after only 2 laps due to the failure of the oil system. This was the last time Ford racing legend Allan Moffat would race a Falcon for many years and the yellow XD is also part of the David Bowden collection along with many of his other racing Falcons. == References == == External links == * XD XD Falcon Category:Cars of Australia Category:Sedans Category:Station wagons Category:Rear-wheel-drive vehicles Category:Vans Category:Cars introduced in 1979 Category:1970s cars Category:1980s cars ",
