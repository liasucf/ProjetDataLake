He was one of the many relatives of Queen Sophie Magdalene who came to Denmark in the years after 1730 and belonged to the inner circle around the king. The architect was af arkitekten Johann Soherr (died 1778). W\u00fcrttembergske left the country when Christian VI died in 1747 and the house was then purchased by general Christian Lerche (1692-1757). It was later passed on to his son and grandson. The building was expanded with an extra floor when it was acquired by the Danish state to make room for the growing central administration in 1805. ==Architecture== The building is 25 bays long and designed in Rococo style. Among the partly surviving interiors is the dining room with murals and door pieces by Jacob Fabris. ==Today== The building is now home to the Minister for Immigration, Integration and Housing. Prior to the 2015 Danish general election, it housed the Ministry of Economy. ==References== Category:Listed residential buildings in Copenhagen Category:Listed government buildings in Copenhagen Category:Rococo architecture in Copenhagen Category:Slotsholmen ",
