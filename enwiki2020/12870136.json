Accessed 5 September 2015. ==Siege of Mafeking correspondent== The Daily Mail newspaper recruited Lady Sarah after one of its correspondents, Ralph Hellawell, was arrested by the Boers as he tried to get out of the besieged town of Mafeking to send his dispatch. She was in the right place at the right time to step into the journalistic breach, having moved to Mafeking with her husband, Lt.-Col. Gordon Chesney Wilson, at the start of the war, where he was aide-de-camp to Col. Robert Baden-Powell, the commanding officer at Mafeking. Baden-Powell asked her to leave Mafeking for her own safety after the Boers threatened to storm the British garrison. This she duly did, and set off on a madcap adventure in the company of her maid, travelling through the South African countryside.Sarah Wilson, South African Memories Social, Warlike & Sporting From Diaries Written At The Time, Chapter VI. Accessed 5 September 2015. Eventually, she was captured by the Boers and returned to the town in exchange for a horse thief being held there.Wilson, chapters IX and X. When she re-entered Mafeking, she found it had not been attacked as predicted. Instead, over of trenches had been dug and 800 bomb shelters built to protect residents from the constant shelling of the town.Wilson, chapters XI and XII. During her stay in the city, she also helped with nursing in a convalescent hospital, and was slightly wounded when it was shelled by Boer forces in late January 1900. Three soldiers talk with Sarah Wilson in Mafeking. She is seated by the door to her bomb shelter. On 26 March 1900, toward the end of the siege, she wrote: Lady Sarah Wilson during the Siege of Mafeking during the Second Boer War Although death and destruction surrounded her, the Mail\u2019s fledgling war correspondent preferred not to dwell too much on the horrors of the siege. She described cycling events held on Sundays and the town\u2019s celebration of Colonel Baden-Powell\u2019s birthday, which was declared a holiday. Despite these cheery events, dwindling food supplies became a constant theme in the stories she sent back to the Mail and the situation seemed hopeless when the garrison was hit by an outbreak of malarial typhoid. In this weakened state the Boers managed to penetrate the outskirts of the town, but the British stood firm and repelled the assault.Wilson, chapter XIII. The siege finally ended after 217 days, when the Royal Horse and Canadian Artillery galloped into Mafeking on 17 May 1900. Only a few people standing in a dusty road, singing \"Rule, Britannia!\", were there to greet their saviours. But in London it was a different scene as more than 20,000 people turned out in the streets to celebrate the relief of Mafeking.The boisterous celebration ensuing from the lifting of the siege created the word, to maffick, for extravagant and public celebrations).See Pall Mall Gaz. 21 May 2/2 \"We trust Cape Town..will \u2018maffick\u2019 to-day, if we may coin a word, as we at home did on Friday and Saturday.\" Complete definition: \"To celebrate uproariously, rejoice extravagantly, esp. on an occasion of national celebration (originally the relief of the British garrison besieged in Mafeking (now Mafikeng), South Africa, in May 1900). In later use usually with pejorative connotations.\" \"maffick, v.\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, June 2015. Web. 5 September 2015. ==Later life== In May 1901, Wilson was invested as a Dame of Grace of The Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of Saint John of Jerusalem (DStJ), and in December the same year King Edward VII personally conferred on her the decoration of the Royal Red Cross (RRC) for her services in Mafeking. She returned to South Africa with her sister Countess Howe in September 1902. ==Notes and references== Sarah Wilson, circa 1899. ===Notes=== ===Citations=== * S. J. Taylor (1996).
