    "text": "WikiAfrica focuses on getting external Africa-based, cultural organisations, museums and archives, as well as bloggers and journalists, to contribute their knowledge to Wikipedia. The project is an international collaboration that intends to Africanise Wikipedia by creating and expanding 30.000 articles on Wikipedia over two years. The principal reason for this focus is for people with the greatest knowledge of the African continent to participate in the online representation of Africa. This project will contribute to building a free and open encyclopedia that provides greater access and visibility to current information and historic archives about Africa. ==Contents== ===History=== WikiAfrica began in 2007, its leadership focusing on producing content, ensuring the involvement of experts and institutions, assessing and utilizing other assets and dealing with other critical aspects of the project.
