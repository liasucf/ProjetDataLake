In this period they had several singles on the Norwegian hit charts and were among the bestselling bands in the country. They won \"NRK\u00b4s Rockem\u00f8nstring\" in 1985. In 1993 the band took a break, but came back in 2001 with a collection and some gigs. In 2005 they released a new studio album, and in 2008 they released another collection which also includes a DVD with shots from a concert in Hamar in 2007. The band's musical style has gone through minimal changes through almost three decades; they have kept most of the typical 1980s rock, with a substantial amount of power ballads.
