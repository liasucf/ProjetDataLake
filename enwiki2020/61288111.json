The original seals on the charter featured those of the Archbishop of Canterbury Hubert Walter, the Bishop of Sarum Herbert le Poer (Poore), William of Perche (died 1226) bishop of Ch\u00e2lons, and Stephen of Perche (killed in 1205);Walter Money, FSA, A history of the ancient town and borough of Newbury, in the county of Berkshire, Parker & Co., Oxford & London, 1887, page 60. The Priory of St John the Baptist at Sandleford was founded for the Augustinian Canons Regular by Geoffrey, Earl of Perch and his wife Maud some time between 1193 and 1202. In 1274, Maud de Clare, Countess of Gloucester and Hertford made arrangements to refound it as a double house for Fontevrault Benedictine nuns and brothers, but this did not come about. It was dissolved in 1478 and abandoned by the remaining monks after years of mismanagement by a prior. The ownership fell into the hands of the Bishop of Salisbury, and circa 1480 passed to the Dean and Chapter of Windsor. The old priory chapel is the present library. The remains were converted to a country house. On 31 August 1320, King Edward II was at Sandleford Priory, where he apparently tarried for the night.Walter Money, Newbury, page 160 One of the last of the priors was a man named Simon Dam who was dismissed after he was cause with his mistresses, Thomasina, at the Priory in 1440. The number of canons at the priory eventually dwindled until at the death of the last prior in 1478 when there were none left. ==Priors== *Walter, occurs (presented or elected) July 1222;The Heads of Religious Houses: England and Wales, II. 1216\u20131377, edited by David M.

Matilda, countess de Perche, was thus a legitimate granddaughter of King Henry II (died 1189) and Eleanor of Aquitane (died 1204), a great-granddaughter of Empress Matilda (died 1167), great-great grand daughter of Matilda of Scotland (died 1118), and was niece of both King Richard the Lionheart (died 1199) and Bad King John (died 1216), and of Queen Eleanor of Castille (died 1214).

Second Battle of Lincoln, which occurred at Lincoln Castle on 20 May 1217 during the First Barons' War between the forces of the future Louis VIII of France and those of King Henry III of England. Louis' forces were attacked by a relief force under the command of William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke. Thomas du Perche, the Comte de la Perche, who was commanding the French troops, was killed; the illustration depicts his death. Perche had come to England to try and recover the honour of Perche which had been lost in 1204 by his mother (a niece of John, King of England) \u2013 this included Newbury and Shrivenham in Berkshire, Toddington in Buckinghamshire, and Haughley in Suffolk. This heavy defeat led to Louis being expelled from his base in the southeast of England. Thomas du Perche, son and heir of Geoffrey & Matilda, killed 1217. :Matilda and Geoffrey III, fourth Count of Perche, founded Sandleford Priory between 1193 and 1200. In addition to the freehold of the site and 600 or so acres, all the lands at Sandleford, as it is bound by hedges and ditches, with all its appurtenances, an annuity of 13 marks from the mills of Newbury was allocated for the support of the house.A History of the County of Berkshire: Volume 4, Victoria County History, London, 1924. :Geoffrey's grandfather the great Rotrou III, Count of Perche (1084-killed 1143/44) married (1136) Hawise (Harwise or Hedwig) d'Evereux (1118\u20131152), daughter of Walter (d'Evereux) of Salisbury by Sibyl de Chaworth (de Chaources, alias Mundublel, alias de Cadurcis). Sibyl's parents who married in 1118 were Maud/Matilda de Hesdin and Patrick de Chaources. Sibyl was thus a granddaughter of the modern era founder of Newbury the Lord of Ulvritone, Ernulf de Hesdin (died Antioch, 1097). Hawise was an elder sister of Patrick of Salisbury, 1st Earl of Salisbury (c. 1122 \u2013 1168) and of Sibyl Marshal. :Hawise and Rotrou III's son, Count Geoffrey's father, Rotrou IV, count of Perche and Mortagne,sometimes written Montague: perhaps a fanciful connection that drew Edward Montagu to lease Sandleford over 500 years later?

Dr. Kathleen Thompson says (2013): However, the king went to some lengths to preserve the Rotrou family association with the lands. He guaranteed two pensions which Count Geoffrey had granted from the revenues of Newbury, ordering that Simon of Pattishall was to be reimbursed for their continued payment, and instructed Simon to honour Count Geoffrey's grant of a rent from the mill at Newbury to the canons of Sandleford.Power and Border Lordship in Medieval France, The County of the Perche, 1000\u20131226, Dr. Kathleen Thompson, Boydell, 2013, page 183 Eliz. de Clare, Lady de Burgh, by John Faber Senior, after Unknown artist, mezzotint, 1714. *Alice de Colville (died before 1220?) of Maidencourt, East Garston.

She was prepared to increase the endowment from \u00a3100 to \u00a3200, directing that one of the priests should act as prior with the assent of the abbots (sic) and nuns.
