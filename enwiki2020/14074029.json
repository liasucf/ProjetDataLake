Apaliunas is considered to be the Hittite reflex of *Apelj\u014dn, an early form of the name Apollo, which may also be surmised from comparison of Cypriot with Doric . Apaliunas is among the gods who guarantee a treaty drawn up about 1280 BCE between Alaksandu of Wilusa, interpreted as \"Alexander of Ilios\" and the great Hittite king,Latacz 2001:138. Muwatalli II. He is one of the three deities named on the side of the city. In Homer, Apollo is the builder of the walls of Ilium, a god on the Trojan side. A Luwian etymology suggested for Apaliunas makes Apollo \"The One of Entrapment\", perhaps in the sense of \"Hunter\". Further east of the Luwian language area, a Hurrian god Aplu was a deity of the plague - bringing it, or, if propitiated, protecting from it - and resembles Apollo Smintheus, \"mouse-Apollo\"\"smintheus\" (Perseus.tufts) \u03c3\u03bc\u03b9\u03bd\u03b8\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2 worshiped at Troy and Tenedos, who brought plague upon the Achaeans in answer to a Trojan prayer at the opening of Iliad.\"You Apollo Smintheus, let my tears become your arrows against the Danaans, for revenge\". Homer, Iliad, i. 33-39 Aplu, it is suggested, comes from the Akkadian Aplu Enlil, meaning \"the son of Enlil\", a title that was given to the god Nergal, who was linked to Shamash, Babylonian god of the Sun,de Grummond, Nancy Thomson (2006) Etruscan Myth, Sacred History, and Legend. (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology); Mackenzie, Donald A. (2005) Myths of Babylonia and Assyria (Gutenberg) and with the plague. ==References== ==Sources== *Latacz, Joachim, 2001. Troia und Homer: Der Weg zur L\u00f6sung eines alten R\u00e4tsels.
