Alex and his wife now have six children. ==Film career== Upon reading a survey stating that films had become more influential than churches, Kendrick set out to change the perception of movies in mainstream America. He co-wrote (with brother Stephen Kendrick), directed and acted in all four movies Sherwood Pictures has produced. Their second film, Facing the Giants, grossed over $10 million at the box office. The football feature became the best-selling Christian DVD of 2007. His third film, Fireproof, grossed $33.5 million, making it the highest-grossing independent film of 2008.

The cast includes New York Times best- selling author and Bible teacher Priscilla Shirer in her film debut, along with T.C. Stallings, Alex Kendrick, comedian Michael Jr., and Karen Abercrombie. It introduces newcomer Alena Pitts as Danielle and features a cameo by renowned Bible teacher and author Beth Moore in her first acting role. Provident Films and AFFIRM films partnered with the Kendrick brothers to release the film in theaters. Sony Pictures again handled distribution. Movie critic Phil Boatwright, a Baptist Press columnist, said of the Kendricks: \"One gets the impression this is their ministry, while at the same time understanding the No. 1 rule of cinematic storytelling -- story must come first.\" Movie reviewer Michael Foust said in a Baptist Press feature on the Kendricks: \"They've been the Lewis and Clark of the genre. No, they weren't the first to make faith movies, but they did it better than anyone who came before -- and Hollywood noticed. They were trailblazers who made first-class movies on shoestring budgets.\" Foust added, \"Even more impressive, the Kendricks have continued to improve on their craft. War Room was better than Courageous, which was better than Fireproof, which was better than Facing the Giants, which was better than Flywheel. Remember: War Room was the No. 1 movie at the box office in its second weekend in 2015. That's an accomplishment that many well-known Hollywood directors haven't achieved. The Kendricks also have been models of humility, giving all credit to God while working to help raise up the next generation of filmmakers.\" ==Filmography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !
