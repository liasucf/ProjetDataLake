    "text": "The New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) was formed on December 22, 1914, as a consolidation of the companies listed below. It later merged with the Pennsylvania Railroad to form Penn Central. The NYCRR owned stock in the New York, Chicago and St. Louis Railroad and the Lake Erie and Western Railroad, but sold it in July 1917 and April 1922, respectively. ==Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad== Also known as the Mohawk and Malone Railway, the Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad was built by Dr. William Seward Webb. The line crossed the northern Adirondacks at Tupper Lake Junction, just north of Tupper Lake. Webb began by purchasing the narrow gauge Herkimer, Newport and Poland Railroad, which ran 16 miles from Herkimer to Poland. He then had track built from Tupper Lake to Moira and thence to Montreal. This was variously called the Adirondack and St. Lawrence Railroad and the Mohawk and Malone Railway.Kudish, Michael, Where Did the Tracks Go in the Central Adirondacks?, Volume Two, Purple Mountain Press, Fleischmanns, New York, 2007. . It opened in 1892 from Malone Junction to Childwold Station with a branch from Lake Clear Junction to Saranac Lake. After 1893, it was controlled by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, and in 1913, it merged with the Central as the \"Adirondack Division\". ==Air Line Railway of Michigan== ==Allegheny and Western Railway== ==Amsterdam, Chuctanunda and Northern Railroad== ==Aurora and Cincinnati== ==Bailey Run, Sugar Creek and Athens Railway== ==Beech Creek Extension Railroad== * Canoe Creek Railroad * Clearfield Southern Railroad ==Bowman's Creek Railroad== ==Chicago, Indiana and Southern Railroad (original)== ==Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago and St. Louis Railway== * Cairo, Vincennes and Chicago Railway ** Cairo and Vincennes Railroad * Central Railroad of Indianapolis * Central Union Depot and Railway Company of Cincinnati * Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis Short Line Railway * Cincinnati and Michigan Railroad * Cincinnati and Southern Ohio River Railway * Cincinnati and Springfield Railway * Cincinnati Northern Railroad ** Cincinnati, Jackson and Mackinaw Railway *** Cincinnati, Van Wert and Michigan Railroad **** Celina, Van Wert and State Line *** Columbus and Northwestern Railway *** Michigan and Ohio Railroad **** Allegan and Southeastern Railroad * Cincinnati, Hamilton, Middletown and Toledo * Cincinnati, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway * Cincinnati, Sandusky and Cleveland Railroad ** Cincinnati, Dayton and Eastern Railroad * Cincinnati, Wabash and Michigan Railway ** Cincinnati, Wabash and Michigan Railroad * Cleveland, Columbus, Cincinnati and Indianapolis Railway ** Bellefontaine Railway *** Bellefontaine and Indiana Railroad ** Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railroad *** Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati Railway * Cleveland, Indianapolis, St. Louis and Chicago Railway * Columbus, Hope and Greensburg Railroad * Columbus, Indianapolis and Western * Columbus, Springfield and Cincinnati Railroad * Mount Gilead Short Line Railway ** Mount Gilead Short Line Railroad * Peoria and Eastern Railway ** Indianapolis Union Railway *** Indianapolis Belt Railroad and Stock Yards **** Indianapolis Belt Railroad **** Union Railroad Transfer and Stock Yards ***** Indianapolis Belt Railway ==Cleveland Short Line Railway (merged 1915)== ==Cleveland Union Terminals Company== ==Cornwall Bridge Company (merged 1917)== ==Detroit and Chicago Railroad (original)== ==Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad (original)== Chartered in 1855, the Detroit, Monroe and Toledo Railroad (DM&T;) ran from Detroit, Michigan, south- southwest along the shore of Lake Erie to Monroe, Michigan.

The DM&T; leased itself in perpetuity to the Michigan Southern and Northern Indiana Railroad (MS&NI;) on July 1, 1856. The MS&NI; merged with the Lake Shore Railway in 1869 to form the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway (LS&MS;).
