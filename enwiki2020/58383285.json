This corp of militias had an active participation during the Argentine War of Independence. == History == The husares of Pueyrred\u00f3n owes its name to Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n, who was in charge of recruiting volunteers during the first British invasion of the R\u00edo de la Plata. Pueyrredon belonged to a family of French and Irish descent, maternal grandson of Dionis O'Duggan, an Irish officer who served in the Spanish armies. Members of this squadron participated in the Battle of Perdriel, against the troops of William Beresford. The Escuadr\u00f3n de H\u00fasares de Pueyrred\u00f3n was officially created on August 14, 1806, it was composed of three cavalry squadrons commanded by Juan Mart\u00edn Pueyrred\u00f3n, Lucas Vivas (2\u00b0 Escuadr\u00f3n) and Pedro Ram\u00f3n N\u00fa\u00f1ez (3\u00b0 Escuadr\u00f3n). A few months later, a fourth squad was formed under Captain Diego Herrera (Escuadr\u00f3n de Cazadores de la Reina). During the second English invasion the 3rd squadron of Husares was sent to the Banda Oriental as reinforcement of the troops of Francisco Javier de Elio against Denis Pack. The 1st squadron was commanded by Pueyrredon and Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez, and among its officers was the Lieutenant Domingo French and Lt. Mariano Canaverys, the grandfather of \u00c1ngel Canavery and Tom\u00e1s Canavery, lieutenant colonels of the Argentine Army. After the May Revolution the squadron was renamed as H\u00fasares de la Patria, H\u00fasares de la Uni\u00f3n and H\u00fasares de Buenos Aires, taking an active part in the cause of Argentine emancipation.. == Gallery == File:Pueyrred\u00f3n por Pueyrred\u00f3n.jpg|Brigadier General Juan Mart\u00edn de Pueyrred\u00f3n by Prilidiano Pueyrred\u00f3n File:Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez 2.JPG|Captain Mart\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez File:HusaresPueyrredon.jpg|uniform of Husares of Pueyrredon File:CazadoresdelaReina.jpg|uniform of Cazadores de la Reina File:Canaveris 6.jpg|index with the records of an officer belonging to the 1\u00b0 Hussar Squadron File:MedallaPerdriel-d.jpg|Medal of Perdriel File:Chacra Perdriel.jpg|Chacra of Perdriel (place of battle) == References == Category:Regiments of Argentina Category:Military history of Argentina Category:R\u00edo de la Plata ",
