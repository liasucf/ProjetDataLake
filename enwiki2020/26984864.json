    "text": "\"Venezia\" is a song by the Spanish pop rock band, Hombres G. It was released as a single from their debut album, Hombres G (1985). The song was a hit in the summer of 1985, during which it reached number one on the Spanish singles chart. It became their second number one single in Spain, following the success of \"Devu\u00e9lveme a mi chica\". The song features an introductory a cappella by Javier Molina, the band's drummer. An earlier version of the song which appears on Hombres G's 1983 single \"Milagro en el Congo / Venezia\" does not include this introductory a cappella. ==Track listing== Venezia #\"Venezia\" - 4:33 #\"Hace Un A\u00f1o\" - 4:02 ==Chart history== {| class=\"wikitable\" !align=\"center\"|Chart !align=\"center\"|Provider(s) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- | Spanish Singles Chart |align=\"center\"|Radio Luz (RR) Alcazar de S.Juan |align=\"center\"|1 |- |} ==Personnel== Hombres G * David Summers - lead vocals, bass * Rafa Guti\u00e9rrez - guitar * Daniel Mezquita - guitar * Javier Molina - drums, a capella vocals ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Discography * Hombres G: Albums, Songs, Bios, Photos at Amazon.com Category:1985 singles Category:Hombres G songs Category:1985 songs ",
