    "text": "In Camera were an English post-punk band, comprising David Steiner (vocals, keyboards), Andrew Gray (guitar), Pete Moore (bass), and Jeff Wilmott (drums), formed in London in 1978 and signed to the 4AD label. The band split in 1981 after releasing only one single and two EPs (the final one being released posthumously). == Background == The seeds of the band were sown when youthful drummer Jeff Wilmott introduced aspiring bass guitar player Pete Moore to singer David Steiner; through this nucleus the addition of guitarist Andrew Gray became possible. After an incendiary performance at 'Billy's' in Soho, London opening for Bauhaus, In Camera were signed by that band's record label, 4AD. In Camera released a 7\" single, \"Die Laughing\"/\"Final Achievement\" in 1979, followed six months later by the four-track EP IV Songs. Various gigs materialised throughout England, culminating at the end of 1980 in a John Peel session. This resulted in the release of the session on 12\" as the EP Fin; the recording being the final vinyl document of the band before its non- acrimonious split in 1981. === Post-split === A retrospective, 13 (Lucky for Some), was released in 1992 on CD. All releases were on the 4AD label. In March 2015, 4AD announced a pre-order for \u201cEra\u201d an anthology of In Camera\u2019s pre-1991 material - featuring previously unheard tracks, rehearsal tapes, live recordings and demos - via direct-to-fan platform PledgeMusic. \u201cEra\u201d will be released in June 2015 and available in digital, 2xCD and 2xLP formats. Andrew Gray went on to join The Wolfgang Press. ==Discography== ; Singles * \"Die Laughing\"/\"Final Achievement\" (AD8, June 1980) ; EPs * IV Songs (BAD19, December 1980) * Fin (BAD205, April 1982) ; Compilation albums * 13 (Lucky for Some) (BAD205CD, August 1992) * Era (DAD3508, June 2015) == References == == External links == * Category:4AD artists Category:English post-punk music groups Category:Musical groups established in 1978 ",
