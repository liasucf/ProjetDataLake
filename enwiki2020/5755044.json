    "text": "So Many Roads (1965\u20131995) is a five-disc box set by the Grateful Dead. Primarily consisting of concert recordings from different periods of the band's history, it also contains several songs recorded in the studio. All but one of the tracks were previously unreleased. The album was released on November 7, 1999. It was certified a gold record by the RIAA on April 12, 2000. The title of the album comes from the Jerry Garcia and Robert Hunter song of the same name; the version included is from the group's final concert. A single disc sampler called So Many Roads (1965\u20131995) Sampler was released to various media outlets. 30 Trips Around the Sun: The Definitive Live Story 1965\u20131995, a second box set using the same chronological format, was later released. After track two, the fifth disc contains live or rehearsal versions of songs that apparently would have gone into the making of the band's never finished 14th studio album. ==Track listing== ===Disc one=== #\"Can't Come Down\" (Grateful Dead) \u2013 2:59 #\"Caution (Do Not Stop On Tracks)\" (Grateful Dead) \u2013 3:12 #* (tracks 1\u20132 studio recordings) Autumn Sessions 1965-11-03 #\"You Don't Have to Ask\" (Grateful Dead) \u2013 3:55 #* Fillmore Auditorium, San Francisco, California 1966-07-16 #\"On The Road Again\" (Traditional, arranged by the Grateful Dead) -
