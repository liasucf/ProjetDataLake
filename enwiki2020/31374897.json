He developed a theoretical and an analytical framework of cultural cognition, cultural conceptualisations, and language, which draw on and expands the analytical tools and theoretical advancements in several disciplines and sub- disciplines, including cognitive psychology, anthropology, distributed cognition, and complexity science. The theoretical/analytical frameworks and their applications in several areas of applied linguistics including intercultural communication, cross-cultural/intercultural pragmatics, World Englishes, Teaching English as an International Language (TEIL), and political discourse analysis are the subject of Sharifian\u2019s monographs entitled Cultural Conceptualisations and Language (John Benjamins, 2011) and Cultural Linguistics (John Benjamins, 2017). These books have widely been recognised as laying \"solid theoretical and analytical grounds for what can be recognised as Cultural Linguistics\". (Alexandra Bagasheva, in the journal of Language and Cognition, Vol. 4:3 (2012), pp. 243\u2013249). Professor Sharifian was the founding Editor-in-Chief of the International Journal of Language and Culture, and the Series Editor of Cultural Linguistics book series (Springer), and the founding Series Editor of Routledge Advances in Teaching English as an International Language (Routledge). He published articles in many edited books and in more than 25 leading international journals. His awards and honours included the prestigious Humboldt Fellowship for Experienced Researchers, from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, Germany. ==Career== In his early career Sharifian was an English language teacher in Tehran. He moved to Melbourne in 1998 and he completed a multiple award winning (The University Research Medal, Dean's Prize for Outstanding Research, and Western Australian Institute of Education Early Career Medal) at Edith Cowan University in 2003. He was awarded a Post-Doctoral Fellowship by the Australian Research Council in 2003, based at the University of Western Australia. He was appointed a Lecturer at Monash University in 2005. In 2008 he was appointed the Director of Language and Society Centre at Monash. In 2011, after only 6 years of scholarly service at Monash, he was appointed Professor. He was appointed as the Chair in Cultural Linguistics in 2015. In 2014 he was elected as the President of Applied Linguistics Association of Australia.
