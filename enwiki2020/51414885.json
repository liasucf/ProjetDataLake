    "text": "\"Heartbreak Dream\" is the song by Australian recording artist Betty Who. It was released on 18 February 2014 with a limited edition CD single in North America in April 2014 as the lead single from her second extended play, Slow Dancing (2014) and her debut studio album, Take Me When You Go (2014). The song is used over the end credits of the 2015 film Pitch Perfect 2. Who describes \"Heartbreak Dream\" as being about \"the kind of relationship that you probably should end but for some reason [you can\u2019t].\" ==Music video== The music video was released on 2 April 2014. It features Who in concert and interacting with fans. ==Critical reception== Jamieson Cox from Entertainment Time said; \"There\u2019s a remarkable density and confidence to \u201cHeartbreak Dream\u201d: Who applies layers and layers of hooks like a cake decorator with a heavy fondant hand, but trusts in her voice to soar above the fray. In a remarkable show of personality, it does: she\u2019s tender and tough in equal measure, balancing defiance and reflection on a relationship that\u2019s souring. It\u2019s tough to draw complex situations with nuance and depth over the course of a four- minute pop song, but Who makes it look easy with \u201cHeartbreak Dream\u201d \u2014 this is another strong effort from a star in the making.\" Josh Terry of Consequence of Sound said; \"While the song deals with the unromantic and complex sides to relationships, it manages to wrap its sense of melancholy in bouncing pop euphoria.\" Robbie Daw from Idolator said; \"Is it possible for a song about heartbreak to sound this upbeat? Betty Who makes it seem effortless.\" Nic Kelly from Project U (in a review of the extended play) said \"'Heartbreak Dream' follows the single 'Somebody Loves You' in its size and romanticism. It\u2019s real \u2018close the curtains, make sure the door\u2019s locked and jump around your room singing it\u2019 stuff. 'In a moment, you were everything to me. In this moment, we\u2019re living in a heartbreak dream,' Betty wails over a massive pop jam which would stand an entire Allphones Arena up to sing and dance along.\" ==Track listings== ;Digital download # \"Heartbreak Dream\" \u2013 3:50 ;Limited edition CD single(RCA \u2013 088843-04577-7) # \"Heartbreak Dream\" # \"Somebody Loves You\" (Acoustic) ==References== Category:2014 songs Category:2014 singles Category:Betty Who songs Category:RCA Records singles Category:Sony Music singles ",
