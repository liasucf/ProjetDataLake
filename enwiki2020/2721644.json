    "text": "Wentworth and Dearne is a constituency represented in the House of Commons of the UK Parliament since its 2010 creation by John Healey, a member of the Labour Party. ==History== Parliament accepted the Boundary Commission's Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies recommending the creation of this constituency for the 2010 general election. ;Political history Most forerunner parts of the seat of Wentworth (which only existed in its second period from 1983 until 2010) matched its record of being a safe seat for Labour. However, since the 2019 general election the seat has become a marginal between Labour and Conservative Party. Labour's majority over the Conservatives currently stands at 2,165. Labour's vote share declined by 24.7% at the 2019 election, the second worst decline in vote share it suffered in any of the 630 constituencies that the party contested at that election (only being surpassed by the 24.9% decline in the Labour vote in Bassetlaw). ;Prominent frontbencher The present member, John Healey held a continuous period of frontbench positions, withstanding during this time various rotations of the Labour frontbench \u2013 the positions were: *May 2002 \u2013 May 2005 \u2013 Economic Secretary to the Treasury *May 2005 \u2013 June 2007 \u2013 Financial Secretary to the Treasury *June 2007 \u2013 June 2009 \u2013 Minister of State for Local Government *July 2007 \u2013 June 2009 \u2013 Minister for Flood Recovery *June 2009 \u2013 May 2010 \u2013 Minister of State for Housing *May 2010 \u2013 October 2010 \u2013 Shadow Minister of State for Housing *October 2010 \u2013 October 2011 \u2013 Shadow Secretary of State for Health In September 2015 he was appointed Shadow Minister for Housing (attending Shadow Cabinet) ==Boundaries== The seat comprises satellite settlements to two large Yorkshire towns, separated by green buffers, in a band north of Rotherham and southeast of Barnsley and as such has electoral wards: *Hoober, Rawmarsh, Silverwood, Swinton, Wath and Wickersley in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham *Dearne: North and South wards in the Metropolitan Borough of Barnsley.2010 post-revision map Greater London and metropolitan areas of England Most of the constituency succeeds Wentworth however the large settlement of Dearne was instead the largest in Barnsley East and Mexborough. The name of the seat stems from the village that shares its name with the largest private house in the country and listed gardens in the seat, Wentworth Woodhouse, in a similar manner, with a widened use of an otherwise scarcely populated settlement, as Sefton. ==Constituency profile== The South Yorkshire settlements grew in the seat into primarily large town size developments from the large presence of coal leading to extensive mining in this area, coupled with convenient proximity to Sheffield, the canals and rivers network, as well as to Doncaster, York, Wakefield and Leeds. As the mining industry has suffered a decline (see UK Coal which has one mine left in this county) and agriculture employs few people, niche manufacturing, general processing (such as of food and raw materials) as well as retail and distribution are critical sectors of the economy to local employment. Workless claimants who were registered jobseekers were in November 2012 higher than the national average of 3.8%, at 5.6% of the population, based on a statistical compilation by The Guardian.Unemployment claimants by constituency The Guardian ==Members of Parliament== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member !Party |- |style=\"background-color: \" | | 2010 | John Healey | Labour |} ==Elections== ===Elections in the 2010s=== This seat was fought for the first time at the 2010 general election. :* Served as an MP in the 2005\u20132010 Parliament ==See also== *List of Parliamentary constituencies in South Yorkshire ==Notes and references== ;Notes ;References Category:Parliamentary constituencies in Yorkshire and the Humber Category:United Kingdom Parliamentary constituencies established in 2010 ",
