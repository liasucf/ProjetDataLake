    "text": "The third-generation iPad Air is a tablet computer designed, developed, and marketed by Apple Inc. It was announced on March 18, 2019, alongside the 5th- generation iPad Mini. The device is similar appearance wise to the iPad Air 2, but features an upgraded Apple A12 Bionic chip, a slightly larger 10.5-inch Retina Display, support for Apple Pencil (1st generation), Bluetooth 5.0 and faster memory (LPDDR4X). It was discontinued on September 15, 2020, with the announcement of the 2020 iPad Air.https://www.techradar.com/amp/news/new-ipad- air-4-2020 ==Features== ===Hardware=== The third-generation iPad Air features an upgraded, 7MP front camera (used first in the iPhone 7 and up to the iPhone XS), compared to the 1.2MP camera found in the previous generation. However, it retains the same, older 8MP rear camera. The third-generation iPad Air has a 2.49GHz six-core processor, the Apple A12 Bionic chip. That chip has a 66% faster clock speed than the 1.5GHz triple-core Apple A8X in the second-gen. It also has a True Tone display, which allows the LCD to adapt to ambient lighting to change its color and intensity in different environments, and P3 wide color gamut to allow the LCD shows more vibrant colors. This iPad Air retains the Lightning port, keeps the headphone jack, and has a slightly larger battery of 30.2 watt-hours (up from 27.6 W\u00b7h), rated by Apple to provide the same \"10 hours\" of active use. ==Reception== The third-generation iPad Air received positive reviews. It was praised for its laminated screen, Smart Keyboard case capability, as well as a speedy SoC. However, it only supports the first-generation Apple Pencil, uses the 2017's 10.5-inch iPad Pro design and only has two speakers compared to four on the Pro models. In addition, while the current Pro models provide some support for HDR, the Air 3 does not. ==Hardware Issues== Some devices of this model, which were manufactured between March 2019 and October 2019, have issues where the screen may flicker or flash before permanently dying. As a result of this Apple released a recall program which allows users to send in their device for replacement up to 2 years from the date of purchase. ==Timeline== According to Macworld, Apple products use the convention 1 GB = one gigabyte (one billion bytes), meaning that 16, 32, 64 and 128 GB storage devices contain a total of 14.9, 29.8, 59.6 and 119.2 GiB, respectively. Formatting and apps take up some of this total storage, leaving 11.5, 27.5, 56.5 and 114 GiB available to the user. == References == Air 3 iPad (9) Category:Tablet computers Category:Touchscreen portable media players Category:Tablet computers introduced in 2019 ",
