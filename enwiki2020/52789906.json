Schmidt. Entrancing Muse: A Documented Biography of Francis Poulenc. The venue was occupied by the musicians of Les Six (Georges Auric, Louis Durey, Arthur Honegger, Darius Milhaud, Francis Poulenc and Germaine Tailleferre). It also gave young painters the opportunity to exhibit their first works: Pablo Picasso, Juan Gris, Georges Braque, Amedeo Modigliani. The evenings also included declamations of fashionable poets, such as Jean Cocteau or Blaise Cendrars. The performances, called \"Lyre et palettes\" after the name of a collective named \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Lyre et palettes\" created in 1916, were financed by Blaise Cendrars, Pierre Bertin, and F\u00e9lix Delgrange. They welcomed a multicolored public, very chic and very bohemian, like the Montparnasse district at its peak. == References == == External links == * Entrancing Muse: A Documented Biography of Francis Poulenc * Jean Cocteau, Guillaume Apollinaire, Paul Claudel et le groupe des six * Les rendez-vous de la rue Huyghens Category:Les Six Category:Entertainment venues in Paris Category:14th arrondissement of Paris ",
