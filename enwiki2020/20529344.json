It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. ==Description== The Frederick K. Stearns House is a two-and-one-half-story house constructed from hollow tile. It has a gabled roof and stuccoed, half timber fa\u00e7ades. The medieval feel of the house is accentuated through the use of varied window sizes, and by several projecting bays and broad roof surfaces. ==Significance== This house is significant in that it was built for Frederick K. Stearns, son of the founder of a pharmaceutical firm that built the Frederick Stearns Building, also located on Jefferson Avenue, and who served as its president from 1887-1921.Burton, Clarence Monrow, William Stocking and Gordon K.
