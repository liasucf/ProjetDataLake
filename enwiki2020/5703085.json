    "text": "Harry Dickson is a fictional pulp detective, born in America, educated in London, and was called The American Sherlock Holmes. He has appeared in almost 200 pulp magazines published in Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium and France. == History == The original pulp dime-novel series that later became Harry Dickson began in Germany in January 1907 under the title of Detektiv Sherlock Holmes und seine weltber\u00fchmten Abenteuer (Sherlock Holmes' Most Famous Cases), published by Verlagshaus f\u00fcr Volksliteratur und Kunst, and comprised 230 issues in total, published until June 1911. The name Sherlock Holmes was actually used for the first 10 issues. After some concern about the rights of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the series was retitled Aus den Geheimakten des Weltdetektivs (The Secret Files of the King of Detectives) with No. 11, even though the main character was still called Sherlock Holmes inside. Holmes' Doctor Watson sidekick, however, was a younger man named Harry Taxon. Sixteen issues of the original German series were adapted into French starting in October 1907 by publisher Fernand Laven for the magazine La Nouvelle Populaire under the title Les Dossiers Secrets de Sherlock Holmes (Sherlock Holmes' Secret Files) for No. 1, immediately changed to Les Dossiers Secrets du Roi des D\u00e9tectives (The Secret Files of the King of Detectives) with issue No. 2. In December 1927, the Dutch-Flemish publisher Roman-Boek-en-Kunsthandel launched a Dutch translation of the original German series, this time entitled Harry Dickson de Amerikaansche Sherlock Holmes (Harry Dickson, the American Sherlock Holmes). The name Harry Dickson may have been inspired by that of Harry Taxon (from the German edition above), or by writer Arnould Galopin's Allan Dickson, the King of Australian Detectives which had been created in the early 1900s. Allan Dickson even met Sherlock Holmes in L'Homme au Complet Gris (The Man in Grey) (1912). The Dutch series lasted 180 issues, until May 1935. In it, Dickson's young assistant was renamed Tom Wills In 1928, Belgian publisher Hip Janssens asked writer Jean Ray to translate the Dutch series into French, for distribution in Belgium and France. The French-language edition, also entitled Harry Dickson, le Sherlock Holmes Americain, began in January 1929. Eventually, Ray became tired of translating the mediocre original stories. Using the titles and the covers from the original pre-World War I German edition (by artist Alfred Roloff, a member of the Berlin Academy) as starting points, he began to write his own stories. The French edition lasted 178 issues, until April 1938. ==Overview== The adventures of Harry Dickson and his young assistant, Tom Wills, have delighted several generations of French readers. Because they were written by a master of horror fiction, they are far more fantasy-oriented than the true Holmesian canon. The best and most fondly remembered Harry Dickson stories are those that pit the Great Detective against some supervillains such as Professor Flax, the mad scientist known as the Human Monster, and, later, his daughter, the equally deadly Georgette Cuvelier, a.k.a. The Spider (with whom Dickson had a love-hate relationship); Euryale Ellis, a beautiful woman who had the power to turn her victims into stone and who may be a reincarnation of the legendary gorgon Medusa; Gurrhu, a living Aztec god who hid in the Temple of Iron, an underground temple located beneath the very heart of London, filled with scientifically advanced devices; the last, living Babylonian mummies who found refuge under a Scottish lake; a nefarious blood-drinking serial killer dubbed the Vampire with Red Eyes; the enigmatic, tuxedo-suited avenger known as Cric- Croc, the Walking Dead; the supervillain Mysteras, who relies on elaborate and deadly illusions; the bloodthirsty Hindu god Hanuman, etc. Harry Dickson's fame in France rivals that of Sherlock Holmes and Ars\u00e8ne Lupin. == Fictional Biography == Based on various clues mentioned in the series, Harry Dickson was likely born circa 1890 in New York City. He was educated from childhood in England, because his father wanted him to receive a British education. He only spent three months during his summer holidays in New York where, as a child, he befriended Reginald Marlow. Dickson\u2019s family background is unknown, but we know that Ars\u00e8ne Lupin studied magic with a stage magician named Dickson in Paris in 1893. At age 15, Dickson was a student in England at the Pertwee Private School and solved a case involving a diamond smuggling ring. At age 20 or about, Dickson enrolled as a student at the University of South Kensington in London and became acquainted with Jean Ray\u2019s armchair detective Mister Triggs. He also helped fellow French student Antoine de Hautefeuille solve a family mystery. Coincidentally, Arnould Galopin began recording the adventures of a young detective named Allan Dickson also in 1910 although Galopin\u2019s Dickson is said to be Australian. In 1919, Dickson was on an official intelligence mission in post-war Berlin. There, he met the brilliant Professor Krausse, whom he much impressed. Dickson met Krausse again, ten years later, i.e.: in 1929, when he was already an established detective at 221B Baker Street. This supports the notion that Dickson\u2019s published cases take place from the mid-1920s to the mid- or late 1930s when he was in his late thirties and early forties, which is consistent with his physical description and abilities. == Bibliography (French Edition) == # \u00c9chapp\u00e9 \u00e0 une Mort Terrible (Escaped from a Dreadful Death) (1929) # L'H\u00f4tel Borgne du Caire (The Shady Hotel of Cairo) (1929) # Idolatrie Chinoise (Chinese Idol-Worshipping) (1929) # Le Testament du D\u00e9tenu (The Prisoner's Testament) (1929) # Le Secret du Gobelin (The Secret of the Gobelin) (1929) # L'\u00c9cole pour Meutriers \u00e0 Pittsburgh (The Pittsburgh Murder School) (1929) # L'Europe en P\u00e9ril (Europe in Danger) (1929) # Un Cadeau de Noces Horrible (An Awful Wedding Gift) (1929) # Le Roi des Malandrins (The King of Burglars) (1930) # Le Myst\u00e8re de la Tour (The Mystery of the Tower) (1930) # Le Drame au Cirque Bianky (The Tragedy of Circus Bianky) (1930) # Le Mod\u00e8le du Faux Monnayeur (The Counterfeiter's Model) (1930) # Le Dogue de Soho (The Mastiff of Soho) (1930) # Les Douze Coeurs Morts (The Twelve Dead Hearts) (1930) # Les Bandits de la F\u00eate Populaire (The Robbers of the Popular Festivities) (1930) # Un Chevauch\u00e9e \u00e0 la Mort par le St. Gothard (The St. Gothard Death Ride) (1930) # Le Capitaine Disparu (The Disappeared Captain) (1930) # Le Professeur Flax, Monstre Humain (Prof. Flax, Human Monster) (1930) # Une Poursuite \u00e0 travers le D\u00e9sert (Desert Pursuit) (1930) (Flax) # La Femme \u00e0 Quatre Faces (The Woman with Four Faces) (1930) # Le Repaire aux Bandits de Corfou (The Lair of the Corfu Bandits) (1930) # La Prisonni\u00e8re du Clocher (The Prisoner of the Bell Tower) (1930) # Sur la Piste d'Houdini (On the Trail of Houdini) (1930) # La Sautoir Vol\u00e9 ou Les Myst\u00e9rieux Voleurs de Bijoux (The Stolen Necklace or The Mysterious Jewel Thieves) (1930) # Dans la Vienne Souterraine (In Underground Vienna) (1930) # Le Rajah Rouge (The Red Rajah) (1930) (Flax) # Le Bourreau de Londres (The Executioner of London) (1930) (Flax) # Le Roi des Contrebandiers d'Andorre (The King of the Andorra Smugglers) (1930) # La Mal\u00e9diction des Walpole (The Curse of the Walpoles) (1930) # Une Fumerie d'Opium Parisienne (A Parisian Opium-Smoking Den) (1930) # Le Tor\u00e9ador de Grenade (The Toreador of Granada) (1930) # Le Mus\u00e9e des Horreurs (The Horror Museum) (1930) # Miss Merc\u00e9des, la Reine de l'Air (Miss Mercedes, Queen of the Air) (1931) # Le Docteur Criminel (The Criminal Doctor) (1931) # Sous le Poids d'une Forfaiture (The Burden of Betrayal) (1931) # Un R\u00e9veillon au Dragon Rouge (New Year's Eve at the Red Dragon) (1931) # L'Ermite du Marais du Diable (The Hermit of the Devil Swamp) (1931) # L'Intrigante D\u00e9masqu\u00e9e (The Schemer Unmasked) (1931) # Les Voleurs Vol\u00e9s ou Le Carnaval Tragique (The Stolen Thieves or Tragic Carnival) (1931) # Les D\u00e9trousseurs de Cadavres (The Corpse Robbers) (1931) # Autour d'un Tr\u00f4ne (Around the Throne) (1931) # Une Nuit d'\u00c9pouvante au Ch\u00e2teau Royal (A Night of Terror at the Royal Castle) (1931) # Le Sosie d'Harry Dickson (Harry Dickson's Look-Alike) (1931) # L'Agence des Fausses Nouvelles (The Phony News Agency) (1931) # Le Double Crime ou La Montagne Sanglante (The Double Crime or The Bloody Mountain) (1931) # Le Crucifi\u00e9 (The Crucified Man) (1931) # Le Mauvais G\u00e9nie du Cirque Angelo (The Evil Genius of Circus Angelo) (1931) # La Myst\u00e9rieuse Maison du Lutteur (The Wrestler's Mysterious House) (1931) # Le Repaire de Palerme (The Lair of Palermo) (1931) # La Veuve Rouge (The Red Widow) (1931) # Une B\u00eate Humaine (A Human Beast) (1931) # Le Signe de la Mort (The Sign of Death) (1931; rep.
