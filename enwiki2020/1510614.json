The charity has received international media coverage on a number of occasions due to its work in highlighting bad practice in online videos in relation to photosensitive epilepsy. * In 2007, it claimed that 30 people had seizures as a result of a segment of animated footage commissioned by the organising committee of the London 2012 Summer Olympics to promote its logo. * In 2011, Epilepsy Action highlighted issues with the video for the Kanye West song \"All of the Lights\". Tests of the video showed that it failed the flashing images guidelines set down by UK broadcasting watchdog Ofcom and so was likely to trigger a seizures in someone with photosensitive epilepsy. A warning was placed on YouTube for people watching the video on its website. * In 2015, it highlighted advertisements posted on Vine by Twitter. The Advertising Standards Authority confirmed that Twitter were in breach of its guidelines Since 2008, the charity has organised the annual Bradford 10K athletics race which in 2019 attracted 3,000 runners. ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Epilepsy organizations Category:Health charities in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 1950 Category:Charities based in West Yorkshire Category:Health in Yorkshire ",
