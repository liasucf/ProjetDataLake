    "text": "Ilyas Malayev (January 12, 1936 - May 2, 2008) (, ) was an Uzbekistani musician and poet. Malayev was born in Mary (then in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic, now in Turkmenistan) to Efraim and Yelizaveta Malayev, a Bukharian Jewish family and raised in the Uzbek town of Katta-Kurgan near Bukhara. He learned to play the tar and the tanbur (both lute-like instruments), as well as the violin, and immersed himself in the shashmaqam genre. In 1951, he moved to Tashkent, where he performed with various state- sponsored ensembles, and became popular as a variety entertainer, performing comedy routines, his own songs and poetry and Shashmaqom excerpts. Tens of thousands of fans attended his stadium performances. He was later named \"Honored Artist of the Uzbek SSR\".Grimes, William: Ilyas Malayev, 72, Uzbek Musician and Poet, Dies, The New York Times, May 7, 2008. In 1994, following the breakup of the Soviet Union, Malayev emigrated to the United States where he settled in Queens, New York City along with thousands of other Bukharian Jews. Although it was a considerable step down from his fame and popularity in Uzbekistan, Malayev emigrated as he was unable to have his poetry published in his homeland, a restriction he suspected was due to either anti-Semitism or the state of the Soviet cultural bureaucracy.Dugger, Celia W.: Uzbeks' Classical Master Reclaims Role in Queens, The New York Times, February 27, 1997. He was granted U.S. citizenship on November 15, 2001.Brawarsky, Sandee: Central Asian Jews Create 'Queensistan', The New York Times, November 16, 2001. Malayev died on May 2, 2008, aged 72, after suffering from pancreatic cancer. On May 29, 2011, in Queens, NY, USA, an honorary concert celebrating Ilyas' 75th year in his memory was held where various Bukharian Jewish and Uzbek performers gave tribute to the virtuoso. ==References== ==External links== *Ilyas Malayev - Official Web Site Category:1936 births Category:2008 deaths Category:American people of Uzbekistani-Jewish descent Category:Jewish American musicians Category:People from Mary, Turkmenistan Category:Turkmenistan Jews Category:Bukharan Jews Category:Uzbekistani musicians Category:20th-century Uzbekistani poets Category:Uzbekistani Jews Category:Soviet Jews Category:Deaths from pancreatic cancer Category:Deaths from cancer in New York (state) Category:Uzbekistani emigrants to the United States Category:20th-century poets Category:Uzbekistani male poets Category:20th-century male writers ",
