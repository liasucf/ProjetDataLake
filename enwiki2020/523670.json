These entities often have de facto control of their territory. A number of such entities have existed in the past. There are two traditional doctrines that provide indicia of how a de jure sovereign state comes into being. The declarative theory defines a state as a person in international law if it meets the following criteria: # a defined territory # a permanent population # a government, and # a capacity to enter into relations with other states. According to the declarative theory, an entity's statehood is independent of its recognition by other states. By contrast, the constitutive theory defines a state as a person of international law only if it is recognised as such by other states that are already a member of the international community.Thomas D. Grant, The recognition of states: law and practice in debate and evolution (Westport, Connecticut: Praeger, 1999), chapter 1. Proto-states often reference either or both doctrines in order to legitimise their claims to statehood. There are, for example, entities which meet the declarative criteria (with de facto partial or complete control over their claimed territory, a government and a permanent population), but whose statehood is not recognised by any other states. Non-recognition is often a result of conflicts with other countries that claim those entities as integral parts of their territory. In other cases, two or more partially recognised states may claim the same territorial area, with each of them de facto in control of a portion of it (as have been the cases of the Republic of China (ROC; commonly called 'Taiwan') and the People's Republic of China (PRC), and North and South Korea). Entities that are recognised by only a minority of the world's states usually reference the declarative doctrine to legitimise their claims. In many situations, international non-recognition is influenced by the presence of a foreign military force in the territory of the contested entity, making the description of the country's de facto status problematic. The international community can judge this military presence too intrusive, reducing the entity to a puppet state where effective sovereignty is retained by the foreign power. Historical cases in this sense can be seen in Japanese-led Manchukuo or the German-created Slovak Republic and Independent State of Croatia before and during World War II. In the 1996 case Loizidou v. Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights judged Turkey for having exercised authority in the territory of Northern Cyprus. There are also entities which do not have control over any territory or do not unequivocally meet the declarative criteria for statehood but have been recognised to exist de jure as sovereign entities by at least one other state. Historically this has happened in the case of the Holy See (1870\u20131929), Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (during Soviet annexation), and more recently the State of Palestine at the time of its declaration of independence in 1988. The Sovereign Military Order of Malta is currently in this position. See list of governments in exile for unrecognised governments without control over the territory claimed. == Criteria for inclusion == The criteria for inclusion mean that a polity must claim sovereignty, lack recognition from at least one UN member state, and either: * satisfy the declarative theory of statehood, or * be recognised as a state by at least one UN member state. == Background == Women in Somaliland, wearing the colors of the Somaliland flag. There are United Nations (UN) member states, while both the Holy See and Palestine have observer state status in the United Nations. However, some countries fulfill the declarative criteria, are recognised by the large majority of other states and are members of the United Nations, but are still included in the list here because one or more other states do not recognise their statehood, due to territorial claims or other conflicts. Some states maintain informal (officially non-diplomatic) relations with states that do not officially recognise them. The Republic of China (ROC; commonly called 'Taiwan') is one such state, as it maintains unofficial relations with many other states through its Economic and Cultural Offices, which allow regular consular services. This allows the ROC to have economic relations even with states that do not formally recognise it. A total of 56 states, including Germany, Italy, the United States,U.S. Department of State Websites of U.S. Embassies, Consulates, and Diplomatic Missions Retrieved 3 February 2011 and the United Kingdom, maintain some form of unofficial mission in Taiwan. Kosovo, Artsakh (Nagorno-Karabakh), Northern Cyprus, Abkhazia, Transnistria, the Sahrawi Republic, Somaliland, and Palestine also host informal diplomatic missions, and/or maintain special delegations or other informal missions abroad. == Present geopolitical entities by level of recognition == === UN member states not recognised by at least one UN member state === {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\" |- ! style=\"width:12%;\"|Name ! style=\"width:5%;\"|Declared ! style=\"width:38%;\"|Status ! style=\"width:24%;\"|Other claimants ! style=\"width:16%;\"|Further information ! style=\"width:7%;\"|References |- | Republic of Korea | 1948 | South Korea (officially the Republic of Korea), independent since 1948, is not recognised by one UN member, North Korea. | considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of Korea, and claims all territory controlled by South Korea. | Foreign relations, missions (of, to) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | | 1991 | Armenia, independent since 1991, is not recognised by one UN member, Pakistan, which has a position of supporting Azerbaijan since the Nagorno- Karabakh War. | style=\"text-align:center;\"| None | Foreign relations, missions (of, to) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|Pakistan Worldview \u2013 Report 21 \u2013 Visit to Azerbaijan Senate of Pakistan \u2014 Senate foreign relations committee, 2008Nilufer Bakhtiyar: \"For Azerbaijan Pakistan does not recognise Armenia as a country\" 13 September 2006 [14:03] \u2013 Today.Az |- | | 1960 | The Republic of Cyprus (commonly known as Cyprus), independent since 1960, is not recognised by one UN member (Turkey) and one UN non-member (Northern Cyprus), due to the ongoing civil dispute over the island. | claims the northeastern half of the island of Cyprus. | Foreign relations, missions (of, to) | style=\"text- align:center;\"|European Parliament Directorate-General External Policies Policy Department \"Turkey and the problem of the recognition of Cyprus\" 20 January 2005 Retrieved 3 February 2011European Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs \"The influence of Turkish military forces on political agenda- setting in Turkey, analysed on the basis of the Cyprus question\" 18 February 2008 Retrieved 3 February 2011 |- | Democratic People's Republic of Korea | 1948 | North Korea (officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea), independent since 1948, is not recognised by three UN members: France, Japan, South Korea; and one non-UN member: Taiwan.See South Korea\u2013Taiwan relations.Seung-Ho Joo, Tae-Hwan Kwak \u2013 Korea in the 21st Century \"Seoul recognized Taiwan as the sole legitimate government of China\" | considers itself to be the sole legitimate government of Korea, and claims all territory controlled by North Korea. | Foreign relations, missions (of, to) | style=\"text-align:center;\"| |- | | 1949 | The People's Republic of China (PRC), proclaimed in 1949, is the more widely recognised of the two claimant governments of China, the other being the Republic of China (ROC, also known as Taiwan).

Since the end of the first Palestinian Intifada against Israel the Israeli government has gradually moved its armed forces and settlers out of certain parts of Palestine's claimed territory, while still maintaining varying degrees of control over most of it.:\"Saeb Erekat, disagreed arguing that the Palestine Liberation Organisation had already declared independence in 1988. \"Now we need real independence, not a declaration. We need real independence by ending the occupation. We are not Kosovo. We are under Israeli occupation and for independence we need to acquire independence\". The Palestinian National Authority (PNA), which performs limited internal government functions over certain areas of Palestine, was established in 1994. The 2007 split between the Fatah and Hamas political parties resulted in competing governments claiming to represent the PNA and Palestine, with Fatah exercising authority exclusively over the West Bank and enjoying majority recognition from UN member states, and a separate Hamas leadership exercising authority exclusively over the Gaza area (except for a short period from 2014 to 2016). Palestine is currently UN member states, the Holy See, and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. \"... the SADR was one of the first countries to recognise the state of Palestine.\" The remaining UN member states, including Israel, do not recognise the State of Palestine.

The United Nations itself recognised the ROC as the sole representative of China until 1971, when it decided to give this recognition to the PRC instead (see United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758). The ROC and PRC do not recognise each other's statehood, and each enforces its own version of the One-China policy meaning that no state can recognise both of them at the same time. The ROC is currently recognised by UN members and the Holy See. Almost all the remaining UN member states, as well as the Cook Islands and Niue, recognise the PRC instead of the ROC and either accept the PRC's territorial claim over Taiwan, take a non-committal position on Taiwan's status, or sidestep the Taiwan issue entirely. A significant number of PRC- recognising states nonetheless conduct officially non-diplomatic relations with the ROC. Bhutan is the only UN member state that has never explicitly recognised the ROC or the PRC.

These entities, however, do not explicitly claim to be independent states and are therefore not included. Examples include Galmudug and Puntland in Somalia, Gaza in Palestine, the Kurdistan Region in Iraq, Rojava in Syria, and the Wa State in Myanmar. * Entities considered to be micronations are not included. Even though micronations generally claim to be sovereign and independent, it is often debatable whether a micronation truly controls its claimed territory. For this reason, micronations are usually not considered of geopolitical relevance. For a list of micronations, see list of micronations. * Those areas undergoing current civil wars and other situations with problems over government succession, regardless of temporary alignment with the inclusion criteria (e.g. by receiving recognition as state or legitimate government), where the conflict is still in its active phase, the situation is too rapidly changing and no relatively stable proto-states have emerged yet. * Rebel groups that have declared independence and exert some control over territory, but that reliable sources do not describe as meeting the threshold of a sovereign state under international law. Examples include Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic, though both entities have received international recognition from partially-recognized states (see list of rebel groups that control territory for a more complete list of such groups). * Those of the current irredentist movements and governments in exile that do not satisfy the inclusion criteria by simultaneously not satisfying the declarative theory and not having been recognised as state or legitimate government by any other state. * Some states can be slow to establish relations with new UN member states and thus do not explicitly recognise them, despite having no dispute and sometimes favorable relations.
