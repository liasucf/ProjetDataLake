Born in Vranje, Southern Serbia, he concentrated on the history, folklore and culture of the Serb and Roma (Gypsy) inhabitants of Yugoslavia in general and the southern province of Kosovo in particular, as well as in gender issues, most specifically of sworn virgins,Cf. a text about \"Third gender\"\u201cSexual tendencies toward females seem to be present in [some cases], albeit in a rather limited and repressed way. Although I found no trace of liaisons with women, cohabitation of masculine \u2018sworn virgins\u2019 with female partners is not completely unknown. I know of three such couples, in two of which a sexual relationship is actually indicated. At least two of these three couples were bound by \u2018blood- sisterhood,\u2019 a kind of ritual or spiritual kinship that, however, does not usually include living together. According to Tatomir Vukanovic, sworn virgins were in some places ill reputed for \u2018certain abnormal sexual relations\u2019 with their blood-sisters.\u201d (From the chapter \u201cWoman Becomes Man in the Balkans\u201d by Rene Gremaux; of \u201cThird Sex, Third Gender: Beyond Sexual Dimorphism in Culture and History\u201d Edited by Gilbert Herdt.) the latter due to the fact that he himself was gayAs remarked by Dejan Medakovi\u0107 in Efemeris which in homophobic Socialist Yugoslavia led to his marginalisation as a scholar and demise from positions of authority to which he had aspired as a Josip Broz Tito's partisan guerilla petty officer. ==Bibliography== * \"The Vampire\".
