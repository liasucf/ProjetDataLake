Her mother, Deborah (n\u00e9e Hurlbatt), was brought up in Hong Kong and Africa, and studied drama before marrying Kristin's father, Lieutenant Commander Simon Scott Thomas, a pilot in the Royal Navy's Fleet Air Arm who died in a flying accident when Kristin was aged five. She is the elder sister of actress Serena Scott Thomas, the niece of Admiral Sir Richard Thomas (a former Black Rod, the parliamentary ceremonial officer in the House of Lords), and the great-great-niece of the ill-fated explorer Captain Scott, who lost the race to the South Pole. Scott Thomas was brought up as a Roman Catholic. Her childhood home was in Trent, Dorset, England. Her mother remarried, to another Royal Navy pilot, Lt Cdr Simon Idiens (of Simon's Sircus aerobatic team flying Sea Vixens) who also died in a flying accident, flying a Phantom FG1 off the North Cornwall coast, six years after the death of her father. Scott Thomas was educated at Cheltenham Ladies' College and St Antony's Leweston in Sherborne, Dorset, both independent schools. On leaving school in 1978, she moved to Hampstead, London, and worked in a department store. She began training to become a drama teacher at the Central School of Speech and Drama, enrolling on a BEd in Speech and Drama. During her time at the school, she requested to switch degree courses to acting but was refused. After a year at Central, speaking French fluently, she decided to move to Paris to work as an au pair and studied acting at the \u00c9cole Nationale sup\u00e9rieure des arts et techniques du th\u00e9\u00e2tre (ENSATT).

In 1994, she starred in the Romanian-French film An Unforgettable Summer, in which she played Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Von Debretsy. Rather than learn Romanian for the part, she read her lines phonetically. She had all the lines translated into French, which she speaks fluently, so she knew what she was saying. In a 2002 interview for WENN, Kristin stated that this is the film that she is most proud of and that she views it as the peak of her career. In an interview for Gloucester Citizen on 22 March 2015, she cited An Unforgettable Summer as one of the films that she's most proud of alongside The English Patient and Only God Forgives. 1996 saw the release of her most famous role as Katharine Clifton in The English Patient, which gained her Golden Globe and Oscar nominations as well as critical acclaim. This was followed by a brief period working in Hollywood on films such as The Horse Whisperer with Robert Redford and Random Hearts with Harrison Ford. However, growing disillusioned with Hollywood, she took a year off to give birth to her third child. She returned to the stage in 2001 when she played the title role in a French theatre production of Racine's Berenice and on-screen as Lady Sylvia McCordle in Robert Altman's critically acclaimed Gosford Park. This started a critically acclaimed second career on stage, in which she has received four nominations for a Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress, including one win, for her performance of Arkadina in a London West End production of Anton Chekhov's The Seagull.
