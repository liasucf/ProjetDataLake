He was named in the startlist for the 2017 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a. In May 2019, he was named in the startlist for the 2019 Giro d'Italia. While riding the Giro, Molano was suspended by his team following stage 3 after \"seemingly unusual physiological results\". The team did not comment where these results originated from and refrained from commenting further until more tests were carried out. Molano did not start stage 4. Molano was later cleared to resume racing at the Adriatica Ionica Race in late-July 2019 after further tests found he was \"highly sensitive to altitude changes.\" ==Major results== ;2014 : Pan American Track Championships ::1st 20px Omnium ::1st 20px Team pursuit ;2016 : 1st Stage 1 Vuelta a la Comunidad de Madrid : 1st Stage 4 Vuelta a Colombia ;2017 : Volta ao Alentejo ::1st Stages 3 & 5 : 3rd 15px Road race, Pan American Road Championships : 3rd Grand Prix de Denain ;2018 : 1st 20px Road race, Pan American Road Championships : 1st 20px Overall Tour of China I ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stage 2 : Tour of Xingtai ::1st Stages 2 & 3 : 1st Stage 2 Tour of China II : 10th Overall Tour of Taihu Lake ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stages 1 & 2 ;2019 : 1st Stage 3 Tour Colombia ;2020 : Tour Colombia ::1st 20px Points classification ::1st Stages 2, 3 & 5 ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\" | Grand Tour ! scope=\"col\" | 2017 ! scope=\"col\" | 2018 ! scope=\"col\" | 2019 ! scope=\"col\" | 2020 |- style=\"text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A pink jersey Giro d'Italia |\u2014 |\u2014 |DNF |DNF |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A yellow jersey Tour de France |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |\u2014 |- style=\"text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"row\" | alt=A red jersey Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a |152 |\u2014 |143 |\u2014 |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Legend |- ! scope=\"row\" | \u2014 | Did not compete |- ! scope=\"row\" | DNF | Did not finish |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Colombian male cyclists Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists ",
