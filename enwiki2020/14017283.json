The supermarket business can trace itself back to 1977. It was founded as the discount grocery store chain RIMI 500 by Norwegian businessman Stein Erik Hagen. Starting in 1992, Hagen sold an interest in the chain to the Swedish group, ICA AB. In 1998, Hagen and ICA reached an agreement to sell a half interest in the business to the Netherlands based group, Koninklijke Ahold N.V.. In 2004, Hagen sold his remaining interest in RIMI.Company profile (Ahold)) From 2004 to 2014, RIMI was owned and operated by ICA Norge. In 2012, Ahold sold its share of ICA Norge to ICA AB, leaving Rimi under fully Swedish ownership.
