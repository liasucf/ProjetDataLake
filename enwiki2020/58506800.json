He started studying mathematics at university, but quit to enroll at Milan's film-making school Civica Scuola di Cinema \u00abLuchino Visconti\u00bb, where he graduated in 1999. He taught himself American literature and started directing documentaries in 2004, especially about social, political and literary topics.
