    "text": "Angoor () is a 1982 Indian Hindi-language comedy film starring Sanjeev Kumar and Deven Verma in dual roles, and directed by Gulzar. It is a remake of the Indian Film Do Dooni Char which was a remake of 1963 Bengali language comedy film Bhrantibilas, that is based on Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Bengali novel by the same name, which itself is based on Shakespeare's play The Comedy of Errors and is again getting adapted by Rohit Shetty in his new movie, Cirkus starring Ranveer Singh, Pooja Hegde, Jacqueline Fernandez, and Varun Sharma in the lead role. All characters are innocent and destiny plays the main role in bringing all characters to one place. Most of the other films are generally based on false characters and deliberately make false statements to fool others. ==Plot== The film is about two pairs of identical twins separated at birth and how their lives go haywire when they meet in adulthood. Raj Tilak (Utpal Dutt) and his wife (Shammi) are on a trip with their twin sons, both of whom they call Ashok. Since they look the same, they should be called the same, is Mr Tilak's reasoning. As fate would have it, they adopt another set of twins, both of whom they call Bahadur. An unfortunate accident then divides the family, leaving both parents with one child out of each pair of twins. A few years later, Ashok (Sanjeev Kumar) is married to Sudha (Moushumi Chatterjee) and Bahadur (Deven Verma) is married to Prema (Aruna Irani). They all stay together with Sudha's younger sister Tanu (Deepti Naval). Into their lives enter the other Ashok, a detective novel aficionado, and Bahadur, a bhang (an edible form of cannabis which has been used in India since before the Vedic period) lover. Now there are two Ashoks and two Bahadurs in the same city. This is more than their families, the Jeweller, the Taxi Driver and the Inspector can handle. == Cast == *Sanjeev Kumar as Ashok R.
