    "text": "\"Yon Yonson\" is an infinitely recursive poem, nursery rhyme or song, perhaps best known from the novel Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, although Vonnegut did not create it. == Origins of the song == The song is often sung in a Scandinavian accent (e.g. j pronounced as y, w pronounced as v). This accent is revealed by the name \"Yon Yonson\", which when recited in American English is usually rendered \"Jan Jansen\" or \"John Johnson\". The Swedish pronunciation \"Yon Yonson\" probably dates the origin of the song to soon after the Swedes' arrival in the United States. A possible origin of the song is the dialect stage comedy Yon Yonson by Gus Heege and W. D. Coxey (1890).Anne- Charlotte Harvey, \"Swedish Theater\", in Philip J. Anderson & Dag Blanck, eds., Swedes in the Twin Cities: Immigrant Life and Minnesota's Urban Frontier (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 2001), , pp. 156ff. Excerpts available at Google Books.Landis K. Magnuson, \"Ole Olson and Companions as Others: Swedish- Dialect Characters and the Question of Scandinavian Acculturation\", in Rhona Justice-Malloy, ed., Theatre History Studies 2008 (University of Alabama Press, 2008), , pp. 75ff. Excerpts available at Google Books. The play's setting included a Minnesota lumber camp. However, no evidence shows that the song was actually performed as part of the play. == Lyrics == One version of the song Numerous versions of the song exist, but all are similar to the following: :My name is Yon Yonson, :I live in Wisconsin. :I work in a lumber yard there. :The people I meet as :I walk down the street, :They say \"Hello!\" :I say \"Hello!\" :They say \"What's your name.\" :I say: My name is Yon Yonson... (repeated again and again). Another version goes: :My name is Yon Yonson, :I come from Wisconsin :I work in a lumber mill there :All the people I meet :As I walk down the street :Ask me how in the hell I got there :So I tell them: My name is Yon Yonson... Another version goes: :My name is Yon Yonson, :I come from Wisconsin :I work in a lumber mill there :All the people I meet :As I walk down the street :They say \"Hello, Yon Yonson, hello\" Another version goes: :My name is Yon Yonson :I come from Wisconsin :I work in a lumber yard there, you see. :And the people I meet, :When I walk down the street. :Say 'Hello'. :And I say 'Hello'. :And they say 'What's your name'? :And I say... Another version goes: :My name is Yon Yonson :I come from Wisconsin :I work in the Lumberyard there: :I got hit by a log :and I live with a dog :and somehow just set fire to my hair. Another version goes: :My name is Yon Yonson :I come from Wisconsin :I work in a Lumberyard there :As I walk down the street :All the people I meet :Say \"Hey, What's your name?\" :And I say... Another version goes: :My name is Eye Yonson :I come from Wisconsin :I work in a Lumberyard there :As I walk down the street :All the people I meet :Ask me how I came to be there :And I tell them... == Other occurrences of the song == * In the novel Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut, \"Yon Yonson\" is used as a repeated motif, ultimately serving as a model for the recursive, time-repeating structure of the book.Peter Freese, \"Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, or, How to Storify an Atrocity\", in Harold Bloom, ed., Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-five (Infobase Publishing, 2009), , pp. 23, 25-26.
