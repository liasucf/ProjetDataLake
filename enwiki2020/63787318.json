He was an eminent professor of medicine at Isfahan University\u2019s Medical School and a member of Iranian Encyclopedia of Medical Sciences (\u0641\u0631\u0647\u0646\u06af\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0648\u0645 \u067e\u0632\u0634\u06af\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646). In addition to teaching at the university and in related hospitals and serving as the Dean of the Medical School for some time, he maintained a private practice of his own for about five decades. Among his unique qualities were the manner in which he combined knowledge and techniques of modern medicine with those of traditional medical practices of Iran as well as his sharp observations and accurate diagnostic skills. ==Early life== Dr. Naficy was born in 1914 in the small village of Pudeh (today's Puyan Shahr) near Isfahan, and he died in November 2007 at home in Isfahan.

British Public Record office, BW 49/, 1943-1946. The film was about the diagnosis of diphtheria and ended with a question and answer period afterwards. Through such methods, surgical techniques were promulgated through Iran.
