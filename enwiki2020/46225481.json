Sprague de Camp) *\"Afterword\" (Mike Ashley) ==Reception== John Clute considered the collection a \"jalopy of a book,\" an \"atrocious little money-spinner,\" whose contents could not have \"required more than a modicum of research to uncover.\" Of the editor, he wrote \"In general his editorial comments are among the most illiterate ever printed, with high-school syntax howlers and unintended neologisms breeding together ... like fruit flies in Hiroshima, nor on decipherment is what he says about his assemblage of stories even interestingly false.\" Clute was kinder in regard to the stories themselves. He singled out for particular praise del Rey's \"Helen O'Loy,\" \"that famous crazy comedy romp.\" The other tales he lumped together as \"warhorses,\" with the exception of the Aldiss piece, which he neglected to mention.Clute, John. \"Books,\" in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction, v. 54, no. 1, January 1978, p. 29. ==Notes== Category:1977 short story collections Category:Science fiction anthologies Category:Robert Hale books ",
