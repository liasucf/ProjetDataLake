In Mrs. John Strentzel and her daughter Louisa Strentzel Muir, wife of John Muir, donated land and a new library was built by popular subscription for . After more than 40 years at that location, voters passed an bond issue to fund a new library building. The new building was designed in an Art Deco style and completed in . In Measure H was passed narrowly by voters in the city of Martinez to renovate and expand the library. The bond specified a designated children's area, youth recreational opportunities, and improving disabled access. The renovation work started in and the library continued operating for 25 hours per week in a temporary location in the old train depot near Martinez station. The library continued operating in the interim Depot Library until when it closed to transition back to the renovated building. The Martinez Library held the Grand Reopening on Saturday with over 1000 visitors entering the library that day. New self-service stations were installed along with new furniture and additional computers. ==Modern== The Martinez Library offers a variety of activities and resources for their patrons. Activities vary from story time and lego workshops for children to book clubs for adults. The library actively seeks to expose patrons to other cultures and has been hosting Chinese Lunar New Year celebration since . Lion dance and other Chinese cultural traditions have been showcased along with crafts. Lunches were provided to children and teens three days a week in the summer as part of the California Summer Meal Coalition.

Library usage increased with the implementation of the program. ==Gallery== {| | File:Martinez Library Plaque Historical Society.jpg|Historic Society Plaque File:Martinez Library Plaque Free Reading Room.jpg|Free Reading Room and Library Association 1885 File:Martinez Library Building Front.jpg|View of Art Deco Architecture style File:Martinez Library Front Entrance.jpg|Front entrance of library |} ==See also== *GoLibrary *National Register of Historic Places listings in Contra Costa County, California ==References== ==External links== * Category:National Register of Historic Places in Contra Costa County, California Category:Martinez, California Category:Art Deco architecture in California Category:Library buildings completed in 1941 Category:Link+ libraries Category:1941 establishments in California ",
