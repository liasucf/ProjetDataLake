There was every reason to hope for continued success in the post-Wright era, though, with younger players like Bobby Mason and Mickey Lill excelling in the team. Manchester United enjoyed a good return in the season following the Munich tragedy, as new signings and younger players integrated with crash survivors to achieve runners-up spot in the league. Arsenal, Bolton Wanderers and West Bromwich Albion completed the top five, while newly promoted West Ham United recorded their highest league finish yet by finishing sixth. ===Second Division=== Sheffield Wednesday sealed an immediate return to the First Division as Second Division champions, being joined by runners-up Fulham. ===Third Division=== Plymouth Argyle won the first championship of the new national Third Division, with Hull City finishing one point behind them in second place. Norwich City made the headlines with their run to the semi-finals of the FA Cup, but the cup run distracted them from the league as fourth place in the final table was not enough for promotion. ===Fourth Division=== Port Vale were champions of the new Fourth Division, and were joined in promotion by Coventry City, York City and Shrewsbury Town. ===Top goalscorers=== First Division *Jimmy Greaves (Chelsea) \u2013 33 goals Second Division *Brian Clough (Middlesbrough) \u2013 42 goals Third Division *Jim Towers (Brentford) \u2013 32 goals Fourth Division *Arthur Rowley (Shrewsbury Town) \u2013 37 goals ==National team== Although the England national football team eventually shared victory in the 1959 British Home Championship with Northern Ireland, it was a tough year without so many of the squad's key players lost in the Munich air disaster the year before. The season concluded with a disastrous tour of the Americas, in which the team lost three successive games before restoring some pride in the final match against the USA. The final game against the USA was also the last match for veteran defender and captain Billy Wright after a then record 105 caps. The match was played in front of just 13,000 fans on a gravel pitch in Los Angeles. ===Tour of the Americas === \\---- \\---- \\---- ==References== ",
