    "text": "The 1987\u201388 Toshiba Rugby Union County Championship was the 88th edition of England's County Championship rugby union club competition. Lancashire won their 13th title after defeating Warwickshire in the final. The final only attracted 2,000 spectators at Twickenham Stadium which was blamed on the fact that the Grand National was taking place at the same time. However a more logical explanation was the introduction of the 1987\u201388 Courage League which provided the sport with its first official league table after replacing the former Merit table. Consequently clubs, players and fans now prioritised the Courage League over the County Championship. == Semi finals == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !width=80| Date !width=120| Venue !width=150| Team One !width=150| Team Two !width=100| Score |- | 12 Mar ||Vale of Lune || Lancashire || Gloucestershire || 11-6 |- | 13 Mar || Coundon Road || Warwickshire || Middlesex || 31-19 |- |} == Final == {| width=\"80%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |- !width=\"20\"| !!width=\"200\"| |- | || A Higgin || Vale of Lune |- | || B Hanavan || Fylde |- | || D Fell || Orrell |- | || G Ainscough || Orrell |- | || Nigel Heslop || Waterloo |- | || I Aitchison || Waterloo |- | || G Williams || Pwllheli |- | || D O'Brien || Orrell |- | || N Hitchen ||Orrell |- | || D Southern ||Orrell |- | || Bob Kimmins || Orrell |- | || Wade Dooley || Fylde |- | || D Cleary || Orrell |- | || P Cook || Nottingham |- | || S Gallagher || Waterloo |- |} |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=\"center\" |- !width=\"20\"| !!width=\"200\"| |- | || Steven Hall || Barkers' Butts |- | || C Leake || Coventry |- | || M Warr || Barkers' Butts |- | || K Shaw || Barkers' Butts |- | || Stuart Hall || Coventry |- | || M Lakey || Coventry |- | || S Thomas || Coventry |- | || L Johnson || Coventry |- | || A Farrington || Coventry |- | || S Wickes || Coventry |- | || A Gulliver || Coventry |- | || P Bowman || Rugby |- | || P Thomas || Coventry |- | || R Travers || Coventry |- | || K Hickey || Moseley |} |} ==See also== * English rugby union system * Rugby union in England ==References== Rugby Union County Championship Category:County Championship (rugby union) seasons ",
