San Francisco Chronicle (Pre-1997 Fulltext) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/302440423 ==Plot== Scientist Alex Marsh (Agar) has invented a powerful paralytic-hypnotic nerve gas for the military that he has been testing on sheep in the California desert. The local mailman (Jack Younger) blunders into the test site and is overcome but recovers without ill effect. A confidant Alex rushes to the Los Angeles home of his mentor, Dr. Frederick Ramsey (Gordon), to tell him about it. Alex's girlfriend Carol Wilson (Raymond) and his colleague Tom Holland (Dunne) are also there. The gas, Alex says, will put people exposed to it into \"a hypnotic trance for days, maybe weeks, subject to all orders and suggestions,\" thus eliminating \"all resistance while the occupation of the enemy territory is being completed.\" He declares, \"This could be a weapon so powerful it could conceivably banish nuclear warfare.\" But Carol calls the gas \"horrible\" and \"somehow immoral.\" Alex replies, \"Well, it's certainly better than killing and maiming and blinding and having radiation affect even future generations, which a nuclear war would do.\" Carol is not mollified. Alex returns to his lab, where he accidently gases himself. At first, all that happens is that his skin gets darker in color. But when his assistant Carlos (John A. Alonzo) touches him and promptly dies, he realizes that he himself has become lethal. Alex sets the lab afire to cover Carlos's death and heads to Ramsey's. When Alex stops as a gas station, the attendant (Joe Besser) dies after touching him. Alex begs Ramsey to find an antidote, which Ramsey eventually agrees to do. He enlists Tom's help. Ramsey develops two potential antidote serums and Tom starts work on a third. The first does nothing. But the second unexpectedly turns Alex into a monster, unable to speak intelligibly, his head and hands enormously bloated, and, in the words of a police dispatcher, his skin \"blackened and cracked like rough charcoal.\" Before Tom can finish the third serum, Alex accidently kills Ramsey. Carol finds his body and flees. Alex puts on a trench coat and hat to disguise himself. He gets into a cab, but the cab driver (Fred Krone) can't understand his muffled speech. The cabbie doesn't seem to be afraid of Alex and orders him out of the taxi. When Alex doesn't exit, the cabbie pulls him out, then falls dead to the sidewalk. Alex drives off in the cab. Tom offers his beach house to Carol to hide in. Alex abandons the cab and stumbles toward Tom's house. As Alex pounds on the door, Carol calls Tom for help. Tom says he'll call the sheriff and that he's on the way. Alex bursts in and tries to speak to a terrified Carol, but can only scrawl a note in shaky handwriting that simply reads \"TOM SERUM HELP.\" When the sheriff arrives, Alex attempts to run away down the beach. Carol begs him to surrender. Tom protectively puts his arm around Carol, and Alex lunges at him. Before he can get ahold of him, though, a deputy shoots Alex and he falls into the surf. Tom escorts Carol from the scene as the deputies call for the \"dead wagon.\" ==Cast== ==Production== Screenplay writer Harry Spalding said that 20th Century Fox initially refused the project but passed it on to Robert L. Lippert's Associated Productions, which had made low budget movies for them in the past. Ling was assigned to write the script for Hand of Death because Maury Dexter, a producer/director himself, said that Lippert \"owed him a favor.\" According to Dexter, they could not find an experienced director for the film because the script was so bad. Nelson had acted in the past and was keen to direct, so Lippert gave him the job. Shooting took seven days. Filming took place in Malibu and Santa Monica. Raymond said in an interview that \"shortly after completing\" Hand of Death, she had a serious car crash which severed her nose and resulted in multiple plastic surgeries. At the time of interview, she said she had never seen the film. The working titles of Hand of Death were Five Fingers of Death and The Death Walker. The film was shot in black-and-white CinemaScope with a widescreen aspect ratio of 2.35:1. Theatrical posters for the film were headlined \"He Experimented in HORROR!\", \"No One Dared Come Too Close\" and \"DOOM Was Always In His GRASP!\" == Distribution == Hand of Death was released in the US on 1 May 1962 on a double bill with The Cabinet of Caligari. The latter film is described as \"not so much a remake\" of the famous 1920 German Expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, but as one \"inspired\" by it. Hand of Death was granted an X certification by the British Board of Film Censors on 5 March 1962. The X-cert prevented it from legally being shown in theatres to audience members under age 16. == Exhibition == According to BoxOffice magazine's \"Boxoffice Barometer,\" the film opened simultaneously in Denver; Detroit; Kansas City; New Haven CT; and Omaha NE. The \"Barometer\" shows how financially well new releases are performing during their first week, with a score of 100 indicating \"normal\" gross box office receipts. Hand of Death averaged an 85 with scores in the same order as the five cities listed above of 65, 70, 100, 90 and 100, By comparison, the most popular film of the same week, The Music Man, had an average score of 273. Critic Bryan Senn writes that Hand of Death was part of Fox's TV movie package during the 1960s and early 1970s, but \"the company's distribution rights expired in the early 1980s, causing the feature to fall into legal limbo. Consequently, the movie languished unseen for over two decades,\" resurfacing sometime after the year 2000. As such, it was generally regarded as a lost film. Film historian Bill Warren, however, says that Agar brought a previously unknown VHS copy of the film to his birthday party \"a year or so\" before his death in 2002. Hand of Death was shown on FXM on 6, 15, 16, 20 and 21 September 2020. == Reception == Agar's makeup has gotten some degree of attention over the years. In an interview, Agar said that his son, age 2 or 3 at the time, \"came onto the set with his mother and heard his dad's voice coming out of this monster get-up - it scared him half to death! I had a tough time explaining it to him.\" Raymond recalled it as \"grotesque\" but \"outstanding and frightening to look at.\" But while Warren comments that makeup artist Bob Mark used \"some admirable imagination\" in creating the Alex- monster, he also writes that \"having [Alex] turn black was a terrible blunder\" for the studio because it resulted in the monster looking like \"the grossest possible caricature of a black man.\" Senn agrees, writing that \"Though it's doubtful filmmakers intended to send a racial message, this seemingly insensitive device speaks volumes about the way many whites viewed African American men in the early 1960s.\" BoxOffice magazine, in a review in its issue of 19 March 1962, calls Hand of Death \"program filler from the word go\" and which will cause the more \"discriminating\" audience members to \"squirm with disgust.\" As for acting, though, the anonymous reviewer says that Agar is \"appropriately grim-faced\" and \"Miss Raymond is a proper feminine foil and the supporting actors are good.\" Warren notes that the film \"begins reasonably well (...) but when the plot becomes clear, with Agar simply killing a bunch of people before he himself is shot, most audiences lost interest. They'd seen it before, and the early promise was betrayed.\" Similarly, Bruce Elder at AllMovie points out that by the time it was released, \"this kind of movie was rapidly losing its traditional audience, as earlier examples from the genre (...) began showing up regularly on television.\" ==References== ==External links== * *Hand of Death at TCMDB Category:1962 films Category:American films Category:American horror films Category:1962 directorial debut films Category:English-language films Category:20th Century Fox films ",
