    "text": "SchleFaz [\u02c8\u0283le\u02d0fat\u0361s] is a satirical film series of the German private broadcaster Tele 5. In this series, mainly B-movies, which are characterized by particularly bad workmanship or unintentionally funny ideas, are introduced, commented and presented by Oliver Kalkofe and Peter R\u00fctten. These films themselves are called Schlefaze. In 2013, Kalkofe and fellow comedian Peter R\u00fctten created and began hosting the still-running show SchleFaZ (Die schlechtesten Filme aller Zeiten) (\"The worst movies of all time\") on Tele 5, which is loosely based on the MST3K format. In it, Kalkofe and R\u00fctten present trash films, introduce them with various background information, after every commercial break comment on the plot so far, and in the end summarize upon it, all within a retro-styled studio decorated in reference to the current film they're commenting on. The show has become an instant surprise hit for Tele 5, being the channel's leading show in ratings (with Kalkofe's other show Kalkofes Mattscheibe Rekalked being second), and during broadcasts of the show on Friday nights, the hashtag #schlefaz regularly enters the German Twitter top ten charts, which has prompted German TV Guides and even Tele 5 themselves to adopt the Twitter hashtag as a semi-official name for the show, also used by show hosts Kalkofe and R\u00fctten themselves. R\u00fctten and Kalkofe made an ironic cameo appearance in the 2015 trash movie Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!. == Start == Oliver Kalkofe, together with Tele-5 station manager Kai Blasberg, developed the concept for the series in 2012. Since the Tele M\u00fcnchen Gruppe owns a large number of B-movies, e.g. of the production company The Asylum, which had already been broadcast on Tele 5, the idea of presenting them as trash television - in deliberate dissociation from the concepts of other broadcasters - matured. Thus, the title of the programme stands in contrast to the Kabel One slogan \"The best films of all time\". The films are presented by the presenters during the broadcast and are provided with biting comments which are then cut in between. == Concept == During the programme, films are presented which, according to the presenters, are considered particularly bad and therefore deserve special attention. One film is presented per programme and is examined in more detail. At the beginning of each episode the viewer is prepared for the film by the presenters. Information about the actors, the director and other facts about the film are presented in a humorous way. In addition, a special cocktail is created or presented for each film, whose composition or name has a reference to the film. In connection with this, a drinking game is usually introduced. For example, the audience of the film Sharknado should drink a cocktail every time a flying shark is seen. During the film, pop-ups are used to provide background information on the respective scene or to remind viewers of the drinking game. After the commercial breaks, the presenters ironically discuss particularly prominent scenes of the film. At the end of the film, what has been seen is summarized and a conclusion is given. As the seasons progress, it has become established that Kalkofe is the incorrigible enthusiast who always gives the films an artistic touch, while R\u00fctten plays the constantly pessimistic and disinterested viewer who almost without exception finds the film bad. Yet, the curse \"Fickende H\u00f6lle! (\"Fucking Hell!\") has established itself as R\u00fctten's catchphrase. In 13 German cinemas (as of February 2014) the SchleFaZ series will be shown on the big screen simultaneously with the TV broadcast. The summer episodes of the 3rd season were simultaneously broadcast on Joiz Germany. First films of the series were released on DVD in June 2015. == Airing data == Most of the Drinking Game are word plays and/or rhyme in German and therefore make little or no sense in English. The Cocktail was not translated cause of the word play. === Season 1 === {| class=\"wikitable sortable zebra\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- ! No. (Sum) !! Nr. (Season) !!
