By 1872 he had acquired freehold to several allotments totalling over 2,000 acres and the north-west corner of Ballangeich following the 1969 Selection Act. A large gum tree which stands on the banks of the Hopkins River was originally used by the women folk as a wash-house, stones being placed down to the water\u2019s edge for their convenience in performing their domestic duties.The Victorian Centenary Book page 293 He decided to swap portion of his property and an old homestead with George Threlfall who had property in Ballarat.The Victorian Centenary Book page 292 He was a member of Mortlake Shire Council for many years and was replaced by Mr Threlfall.Camperdown Chronicle 8 February 1888 The old station has a private cemetery in which many of the old pioneers have been laid to rest. At the time that Ballangeich was thrown open for selection, someone selected this piece of land known as \"The Groves\" on the bank of the Hopkins River. On hearing of this Captain Eddington started off on horseback \u2013 at night \u2013 to lodge a petition that it be declared a cemetery. The letter signed by the superintendent Charles La Trobe, made the necessary grant dated 1848. Ballangeich was named by Captain Eddington after the Pass of Ballangeich below Stirling Castle where he had played in his boyhood. In earlier times the aborigines were very numerous in the neighbourhood, but there was seldom any trouble with them except for the occasional killing of cattle for food. ==References== ==Further reading== * The Victorian Centenary Book page 291 Category:1798 births Category:1873 deaths Category:Settlers of Victoria (Australia) ",
