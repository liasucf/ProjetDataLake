The ground floor arcade is well known for its many snack shops. ==History and background== Tai On Building is located at 57-87 Shau Kei Wan Road on Hong Kong Island, which is next to the Sai Wan Ho MTR station and the tram stop of Tai On Street. It was constructed by Hong Kong Land Buildings Limited in 1968. It was designed as a H-block, which was the common structure of residential properties in the 1960s. It has 28 floors from Ground floor to the 28th floor, there are 68 flats per floor, a total of 1,884 flats all together and 16 lifts for the entire building. Before land reclamation in around 1978, it was alongside the coastal area. In the early 1960s, there were no walled residential buildings in Sai Wan Ho area. Thus, the construction of Tai On Building was a sensation at that time and Hong Kong Land Buildings Limited received more than ten thousand applications. There are two types of flats (375 square feet and 465 square feet including common area) in Tai On Building. In the earlier years, the most expensive flat cost only from $17,300-$27,000 and buyer only needed to pay 10% initial deposit while the whole installment payment could be paid off in a maximum of 14 years. Thus, the common working class could also afford the payment. Besides residence, it also consists of a shopping centre, parking lot, petrol station and an open garden/terrace area on the waterfront side on the first floor. Once upon a time, Tai On Building has its own cinema named Tai On Cinema which was located at the current McDonald's restaurant. The 20,000 square feet shopping center is on the ground floor with around hundred shops, including food stalls, grocery stores, Chinese restaurant, stationery store, laundry-shop, hardware store, clinic, bookstore, game center etc. Due to the varieties of shops, many locals in the area besides the building residents often visit Tai On Building for goods and services. Tai On Building is famous for the food stalls. Visitors can find many local snacks from those shops.

However, in recent years, most of the food stalls are licensed and therefore the hygiene status has been improved. Nowadays, many Hong Kong's style snacks are going to disappear as the young generations are not interested in preserving the local refreshments. However, as Tai On Building is providing more and more local cuisines, the popularity of Tai On Building continues to grow.

When the building first opened to the public, there was a huge party with bands and singers on top of the fountain one weekend and since then, it has been nicknamed \"The most colourful lighting fountain\" by the public.
