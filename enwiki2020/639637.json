On 18 October 2000 Cavaleri performed during the Opening Ceremony of the 11th Paralympic Games in Sydney. Cavaleri reflected on his early career said in 2004, \"When I was doing all of that stuff (it) doesn't even feel like it was my life ... It feels like a haze. It feels like a dream. It just feels like images in the head, almost like a western movie.\" \"I just totally escaped music ... It can be a dark time when you\u2019re finding yourself creatively.\" ===2003-2012: Dirty Skanks & Nat Col and the Kings=== In 2003 he formed a group, Dirty Skanks, with Col Hatchman on drums, then a member of The Screaming Jets.
