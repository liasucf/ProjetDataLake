In 1946, he won the Atlantic Award for Literature for his collection of short stories, The Leaping Lad. After another stint as a miner, Chaplin began writing full-time for the National Coal Board magazine from 1950. He later wrote for The Guardian, including theatre reviews, essays of social observation and, from 1963, his own column Northern Accent. Chaplin's literary career pre-dated the so-called angry young men genre and has been credited as an influence on the late 1950s/early 1960s \"kitchen sink\" social realism of writers such as Alan Sillitoe and Stan Barstow. His novels The Day of the Sardine (1961) and The Watchers and the Watched (1962) have been cited as classics of \"working class existentialism\" and were reprinted by Flambard Press in 2004.http://www.flambardpress.co.uk/books/show.php?book=721&author;=sid.chaplin In 1968, playwright Alan Plater based his play and musical production Close The Coalhouse Door on Chaplin's early writings, set to songs by Alex Glasgow. The musical was revived in 2012. In 1976, Chaplin contributed to the writing of the TV series When The Boat Comes In. The following year he was awarded an OBE for services to the arts in the North East.https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/local-news/sid-chaplins-residence- newcastle-up-1369113 Chaplin died in 1986.
