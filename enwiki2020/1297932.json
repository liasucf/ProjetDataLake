In 1994, one of his colleagues at college discovered he had an interest in blackjack and subsequently introduced him to poker. In 1996, he became Chief Technical Officer for Go2Net.

He was banned from competing in the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in the early 2000s due to comments he made about the way in which the Horseshoe split entry money between players and casino employees. Despite being reinstated as a competitor in late 2001, he only played one event in 2002 (placing 2nd to John Juanda in the $1,500 triple draw lowball Ace to Five event). Despite choosing not to play in the WSOP, Phillips finished 2nd in the 2003 Tournament Poker Money List. In 2004 he made three WSOP final tables (one in Omaha hi-lo split and two in no limit hold'em.) He spoke out against the inclusion of Phil Hellmuth Jr, Doyle \"Texas Dolly\" Brunson and Johnny \"Oriental Express\" Chan in the 2005 World Series of Poker Tournament of Champions, and subsequently became the subject of message board flame wars. Phillips has played in both of the first two National Heads-Up Poker Championships, losing in second round play both years. As of 2012, his total live tournament winnings exceed $2,300,000. However, Phillips has no tournament cashes since 2009.Paul Phillips' Poker Statistics: Hendon Mob Poker Database. Pokerdb.thehendonmob.com. Retrieved on April 23, 2012.
