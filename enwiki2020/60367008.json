    "text": "Heilprin Glacier (), is a glacier in northwestern Greenland. Administratively it belongs to the Avannaata municipality. This glacier was named by Robert Peary after geologist, paleontologist and naturalist Angelo Heilprin (1853 \u2013 1907), curator of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, who took part in the Peary expedition to Greenland of 1891\u201392.Robert Neff Keely, Gwilym George Davis, In Arctic Seas: the Voyage of the Kite with the Peary Expedition, 2011 p. 373 ==Geography== The Heilprin Glacier discharges from the Greenland Ice Sheet into the head of the Inglefield Fjord just east of the Harvard Islands and northeast of Quajaqqisaarsuaq. Its terminus lies between the Smithson Range nunatak that separates it from the Tracy Glacier to the north, and Nunatarsuaq, a plateau dotted with lakes to the south. Both neighboring glaciers drain roughly of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Although the Heilprin Glacier is contiguous to the Tracy Glacier, both glaciers have a different nature, a fact which has been a source of puzzlement for scientists for over a century. {| |- valign=\"top\" |Map of Northwestern Greenland |19th century map of the Inglefield Gulf. |} ==See also== *List of glaciers in Greenland *Inglefield Fjord ==References== ==External links== *NASA - Decline of Two Glaciers in Northwest Greenland *Identifying Spatial Variability in Greenland's Outlet Glacier Response to Ocean Heat *The recent regimen of the ice cap margin in North Greenland Category:Glaciers of Greenland ",
