    "text": "Wolverhampton Wolves are a British speedway team based in Wolverhampton, England. They are sponsored by Parry's International Travel, and signed a deal with owner Dave Parry (previous speedway rider for the Wolverhampton Wolves) for the 2008 season onwards. The team is managed by Peter Adams and the promoter of the club is Chris Van Straaten. ==History== The club was founded in 1928 racing at Monmore Green, and after a brief flirtation with speedway, saw its last pre-war meeting in 1930. It was 20 years later that the sport returned to the town. During 1948 and the post-war optimism, record crowds were attending speedway events up and down the country. With towns keen to cash in on the boom, Wolverhampton's stadium owners applied to the local council for a track to be re-built at the original site. Australian Arthur Simcock set the ball rolling and was granted permission to promote speedway in Wolverhampton and finally his dream came true on 14 October 1950. The first to test the new track were some visiting Norwich riders, en route to a meeting. They declared themselves satisfied. Officially once again founded in 1951, known as the Wolverhampton Wasps, the racing keen fans saw a Wolverhampton team defeat Sheffield 58-26 (old 14-heat formula). With all parties happy, Wolverhampton were admitted into Division Three of the National League of the same year. However the winter of 1952/3 was a tumultuous one for speedway in the Black Country. Cradley Heath had endured a tough season in the Second Division, but meanwhile Wolverhampton had enjoyed a solid Third Division campaign. Due to the events at Cradley, a merger took place between the two promotions and saw a new formed team racing in the Second Division at Monmore Green. (Dudley Wood closed and didn't hear the roar of speedway bikes until 1959). Wolverhampton were pleased with this 'promotion' and saw the only meeting where supporters had been 'locked out'. It was reported 12,000 fans turned up with many more scaling the walls. The first meeting against Stoke in their new form saw the Potters demolished 52-32. This was however short lived and the side was thumped home and away in the early part of the 1954 season. A decision was made by the promotion and in early May of the same year, Wolverhampton closed its doors to speedway. It wasn't until 1961 when the sport returned to the venue again. Since 1965 Wolverhampton have competed in the top tier of British speedway with the exception of 1981 (second tier) and 1982/3 (inactive). The Wolverhampton Wolves were the Sky Sports Elite League champions in 2002. They regained the champion status in the 2009 season, beating the Swindon Robins 95-90 on aggregate in the 2009 play-offs. On 10 August 2015 Swindon Robins rider Darcy Ward broke the track record time held by Tai Woffinden. Darcy's new record time 53.45 seconds. Then on 29 August 2016 Niels-Kristian Iversen broke the track record again with a time of 52.69 seconds. The team had a title success in 2016, beating the top of the table finishing Belle Vue Aces. After winning by an 18-point margin at home in the first leg by beating the Belle Vue Aces 54-36, the second leg was a win for Belle Vue of 50-42, meaning victory for the Wolves by a 10-point margin with the aggregate scores 96-86. ==Olympique== Wolves host the Olympique annually. ==Riders== === 2019 team === * * * * * * * * (Cover for Jacob Thorssell) === Previous seasons === 2018 team * * * * * * * * 2017 team * * * * * * * * * 2016 team * * * * * * * * 2015 team * * * * * * * 2014 team * * * * * * * * * * 2013 team * * * * * * * 2012 team * * * * * * * 2011 team * * * * * * * 2010 team * * * * AS * * * \u2021 * \u2021 * * *\u2021 \u2021 AS 2009 team * * * * * * * \u2021 * \u2021 * (No.8) Also Rode: * (No.8) \u2020 \u2021 \u2020 2008 team * * * * * * * * (No.8) Also Rode: * * * 2007 team * * * * * * * * * (No.8) Also Rode: * * 2006 team * * * * * * * * 2005 team * * * * * * * 2004 team * * * * * * * * * 1975 team * * * * * * ==Notable riders== {| | George Hunter with Gary Peterson | Finn Thomsen and Ole Olsen |} ==Individual Honours== ===World Championship=== * Ole Olsen (1971, 1975) * Sam Ermolenko (1993) * Tai Woffinden (2013, 2015) ===World Under-21 Championship=== * Mikael Karlsson (1994) * Piotr Pawlicki Jr. (2014) ===Long Track World Championship=== * Ole Olsen (1973) ===British Speedway Championship=== * Tai Woffinden (2013, 2014, 2015) ===British League Riders' Championship=== * Ole Olsen (1972) * Sam Ermolenko (1991, 1994) ===Elite League Riders' Championship=== * Fredrik Lindgren (2010, 2016) ===Australian Championship=== * Jim Airey (1968) * Sam Masters (2017) ===Danish Championship=== * Ole Olsen (1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1975) ===United States Championship=== * Sam Ermolenko (1993, 1994) * Billy Hamill (2007) ===British Under 21 Championship=== * Simon Stead (2003) * Joe Haines (2010) ===British Under 19 Championship=== * Max Clegg (2016) ===South Australian Championship=== * Mark Fiora (1984) ==References== ==External links== * Category:Speedway Elite League teams Category:Sport in Wolverhampton ",
