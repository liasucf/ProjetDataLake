    "text": "The C&C; 51 Custom is a Canadian sailboat, that was designed by Robert W. Ball and first built in 1986. The design was built by C&C; Yachts in Canada, but it is now out of production. ==Production== At least 5 examples were produced (based on Hull Identification Numbers (HIN) in the US Coast Guard database), while three more were under construction when the C&C; factory in Niagara-on- the-Lake was destroyed by fire in 1994. The last example, Silent Partner II, was finished from a hull produced by C&C; and spared by the fire, with the finishing work completed at the Wiggers Yard in Ontario, Canada, and was launched in 1997. ==Design== The C&C; 51 Custom is a small recreational keelboat, built predominantly of fiberglass, with wood trim. It has a masthead sloop rig, a raked stem, a reverse transom, an internally-mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a wheel and a fixed stub fin keel with a retractable centreboard. It displaces and carries of ballast. It carries a sail area of and has an air draft (overall height) of . The C&C; 51 was designed as a centerboarder from the start. The centreboard is filled with lead ballast and has a hydraulic lift with a tackle arrangement in which the hydraulic cylinder moves about one quarter the distance needed to pull up the board. As a result the boat has a draft of with the centreboard extended and with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow moorings. One example, Silent Partner II, was completed with a fixed keel. The design has a hull speed of . There was a 51 XL version produced with a slightly taller mast and so a slightly larger sail area. ==See also== *List of sailing boat types ==References== ==External links== * Original Factory Brochure - C&C; Custom 51 * Original Factory Brochure - C&C; Custom 51 xl Category:Keelboats Category:1980s sailboat type designs Category:Sailing yachts ",
