    "text": "Ciaran Kelly (born 4 July 1998) is an Irish professional footballer who plays for NIFL Premiership club Ballymena United, on loan from League of Ireland Premier Division club Bohemians. He previously played for St Patrick's Athletic, the club where he started his professional career. He has also spent one season at Drogheda United. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Kelly started playing football with his local side in Lucan, Esker Celtic where he played from under 5's age group, right up to under 14's.He then played for Lucan United from 2012 to 2014 before moving to Peamount United where he caught the eye of St Patrick's Athletic scouts. ===St Patrick's Athletic=== Kelly signed for St Patrick's Athletic on his 17th birthday ahead of their underage 2015 campaigns, with Kelly eligible for both the under 17 and under 19 sides. Kelly impressed for the under 19's among an excellent squad including Fuad Sule, Aidan Keena, Darragh Markey, Jamie Lennon, JJ Lunney, Rory Feely, Conor Kane and Shane Elworthy, all of whom went on to play at senior level in the League of Ireland Premier Division or abroad. His first involvement with the first team came on 16 October 2015, when manager Liam Buckley included him on the bench for a league game with Drogheda United, although he remained an unused substitute. Kelly and the under 19's were narrowly beaten by Cork City in the final of the Enda McGuill Cup on 13 September 2016. He made his first senior appearance on 25 October 2016 when he came off the bench for Ian Bermingham in the 88th minute of a 5\u20132 win over champions Dundalk at Richmond Park. Unfortunately for Kelly and the Pats under 19's, on 1 November 2017, they again finished up their season up as runners up in the league, as they lost 1\u20130 in the final to Bohemians at Dalymount Park, in what was Kelly's last game in underage football. Kelly made 2 more appearances for the first team in the 2017 season, against Firhouse Clover and Shelbourne in the Leinster Senior Cup. ===Drogheda United season=== With first team appearances at St Patrick's Athletic limited, it was announced on 1 January 2018 that Kelly had been persuaded to sign for Drogheda United by new manager Tim Clancy. Kelly's first career goal came on 11 March 2018, in a 6\u20130 win over Athlone Town at United Park on the opening night of the season. He proved to be a mainstay in the team and a key player as Drogheda had a late push in the league to finish in 4th place ahead of Longford Town to qualify for the League of Ireland Promotion Playoffs. His side beat Shelbourne over 2 legs before they were knocked out by Finn Harps despite Kelly scoring a vital goal in the first leg to give Drogs the lead. Kelly's first full season in senior football saw him make 39 appearances in all competitions, scoring seven goals from his centre back position. ===Return to St Patrick's Athletic=== On 20 November 2018, it was announced that Kelly had signed a contract back at St Patrick's Athletic under new manager Harry Kenny. Kelly's manager at Drogheda, Tim Clancy stated soon after his move that he would not have left the club if it had been any club other than Pat's. Kelly's first league start came against Finn Harps on 25 February 2019, with Kelly playing at left back, covering for the injured Ian Bermingham. He had to wait until the 12 April away to Cork City for his first start in his preferred centre back role and he impressed in a 1\u20131 draw which helped him nail down his spot in the starting 11 from there on. Kelly's first senior goal for Pats came in a 2\u20130 win over UCD. His first appearances in Europe came on 11 and 18 July 2019 as he played in both legs against IFK Norrk\u00f6ping of Sweden, as Pats lost 2\u20130 at home and 2\u20131 away with Kelly being sent off in the 89th minute after 2 yellow cards. Kelly announced on his Twitter account on 1 November 2019 that he was leaving St Patrick's Athletic following the ending of his contract.https://twitter.com/ciaran_3/status/1190268098324127745 ===Bohemians=== Kelly was announced as a pre-season signing for Phibsborough side Bohemians before the 2020 League of Ireland campaign.https://www.rte.ie/sport/soccer/2020/0116/1107891-ciaran-kelly-signs- bohemians/ ===Ballymena United loan=== After just 3 appearances in all competitions for Bohs,https://ie.soccerway.com/players/ciaran-kelly/426152/ Kelly was loaned out to NIFL Premiership side Ballymena United on the 1st of October 2020 until January 2021.https://www.ballymenaunitedfc.com/news/news.php?newsid=1712 He made his debut in the opening game of the season, a 1\u20130 win away to Coleraine at The Showgrounds.https://www.ballymenaunitedfc.com/report/report.php?reportid=334&sseason;=202021 ==Career statistics== Professional appearances \u2013 correct as of 18 October2020. {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Division !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|National Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"3\"|St Patrick's Athletic |rowspan=\"3\"|League of Ireland Premier Division |2015 |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2016 |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- |2017 |0||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||2||0||2||0 |- |Drogheda United |League of Ireland First Division |2018 |31||6||2||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||1||39||7 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|St Patrick's Athletic |League of Ireland Premier Division |2019 |25||1||2||0||1||0||2||0||2||0||32||1 |- !colspan=\"2\"|St Patrick's Athletic Total !26!!1!!2!!0!!1!!0!!2!!0!!4!!0!!35!!1 |- |Bohemians |League of Ireland Premier Division |2020 |2||0||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||3||0 |- |Ballymena United (loan) |NIFL Premiership |2020\u201321 |1||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014||colspan=2|\u2014||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career Total !59!!7!!5!!0!!2!!0!!2!!0!!9!!1!!77!!8 |} ==Notes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1998 births Category:Living people Category:People from Lucan, Dublin Category:Association footballers from County Dublin Category:St Patrick's Athletic F.C. players Category:Drogheda United F.C. players Category:Bohemian F.C. players Category:Ballymena United F.C. players Category:League of Ireland players Category:NIFL Premiership players Category:Association football defenders Category:Republic of Ireland association footballers ",
