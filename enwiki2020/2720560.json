    "text": "An undefined variable in the source code of a computer program is a variable that is accessed in the code but has not been previously declared by that code.\"undefined variable.\" YourDictionary, n.d. Web. 24 July 2013. . In some programming languages, an implicit declaration is provided the first time such a variable is encountered at compile time. In other languages such a usage is considered to be sufficiently serious that a diagnostic being issued and the compilation fails. Some language definitions initially used the implicit declaration behavior and as they matured provided an option to disable it (e.g. Perl's \"`use warnings`\" or Visual Basic's \"`Option Explicit`\"). ==Examples== The following provides some examples of how various programming language implementations respond to undefined variables. Each code snippet is followed by an error message (if any). ===CLISP === (setf y x) *** - EVAL: variable X has no value ===C=== int main() { int y = x; return 0; } foo.c: In function `main': foo.c:2: error: `x' undeclared (first use in this function) foo.c:2: error: (Each undeclared identifier is reported only once foo.c:2: error: for each function it appears in.) ===JavaScript === y = x Error: x is not defined Source File: file:///c:/temp/foo.js ===Lua=== y = x (no error, continuing) print(y) nil ===ML (Standard ML of New Jersey) === val y = x; stdIn:1.9 Error: unbound variable or constructor: x ===MUMPS=== Set Y=X ===OCaml === let y = x;; Unbound value x ===Perl=== my $y = ($x // 0) + 1; # defined-or operator (no error) ===PHP 5=== $y = $x; (no error) error_reporting(E_ALL); $y = $x; PHP Notice: Undefined variable: x in foo.php on line 3 ===Python 2.4=== >>> x = y Traceback (most recent call last): File \"\", line 1, in NameError: name 'y' is not defined ===REXX=== signal on novalue y = x +++ Error 30 in line 2: Label not found ===Ruby === irb(main):001:0> y = x NameError: undefined local variable or method `x' for main:Object from (irb):1 ===Tcl === % set y $x can't read \"x\": no such variable ===VBScript === Dim y y = x (no error) Option Explicit Dim y y = x (3, 1) Microsoft VBScript runtime error: Variable is undefined: 'x' ==References== Category:Variable (computer science) Category:Software bugs ",
