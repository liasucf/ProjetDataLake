Along with Coxon's music, the label issued records by acts such as Ooberman, The Buff Medways, You Am I, and Billy Childish. It was co-owned by Jamie Davis, who subsequently co-founded Ark Recordings and founded Dr Pepper's Jaded Hearts Club Band . Coxon issued his first five solo albums and their associated singles on the label between 1998 and 2005. After the closure of Transcopic, Coxon released his sixth album, Love Travels at Illegal Speeds (2006), via Parlophone. ==Selected releases== * Assembly Line People Program - Noise Vision 80 (TRAN001) * Ooberman - Sugar Bum (TRAN002) * Control Freaks - Agro (TRAN003) * Assembly Line People Program - Critical Gate (TRAN004) * Graham Coxon - The Sky is Too High (TRANCD005/TRANLP005) * Assembly Line People Program - Subdivision of Being (TRANCD006/TRANLP006) * Bunsen Honeydew - Didn't You Used To Be Invisible?
