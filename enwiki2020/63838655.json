    "text": "The Toronto Six are a professional women's ice hockey team based in Toronto playing out of Canlan Ice Sports \u2013 York. They will be the first Canadian team to compete in the National Women's Hockey League (NWHL) and are the first expansion team to join the league since the collapse of the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) in 2019. The team was founded in 2020 and the 2020\u201321 NWHL season will be their inaugural season. == History == Following the 2018\u201319 season, the Canadian Women's Hockey League (CWHL) ceased operations and with it the league's Toronto team, the Toronto Furies, citing the fragmentation of corporate sponsors between the CWHL and National Women's Hockey League (NWHL), which caused their league to be financially infeasible. The NWHL then announced it was pursuing adding two CWHL markets to the league, Montreal and Toronto, for the 2019\u201320 season if the NWHL found financial backers for the teams. The league was not able to set up the new teams before the start of the season, partially due dealing to a player strike that resulted in the creation of the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association. On April 22, 2020, the new Toronto NWHL franchise was officially announced as the league's sixth team and first original expansion team (the Minnesota Whitecaps joined the league's original four teams after being an independent team). The team's ownership was announced as of a group of Boston- based investors headed by Johanna Neilson Boynton, a former competitor with the Harvard Crimson women's ice hockey program. Margaret \"Digit\" Murphy, former head coach of the Brown Bears, Boston Blades, and Kunlun Red Star WIH, became team president, while sports executive Tyler Tumminia was announced as the team's chairman. The team simultaneously announced its first five signed players as Kristen Barbara, Elaine Chuli, Shiann Darkangelo, Emma Greco, and Taylor Woods. All five were former players in the CWHL. The team held the first overall pick in the 2020 NWHL Draft, but traded the pick to the Boston Pride. The first player drafted by Toronto was Jaycee Gebhard, an alumna of the Robert Morris Colonials women's ice hockey program, with the sixth overall pick in the 2020 NWHL Draft. The team announced Mandy Cronin, CWHL co-founder and former goaltender of the Buffalo Beauts, as general manager on May 11, 2020. The team name, colours, and logo were announced by the NWHL on May 19, 2020. The name was chosen from over 300 entries submitted in an online poll and was chosen because the team is the sixth NWHL team founded for the sixth NWHL season, as well as there being six players on the ice. The Six is also a nickname for the city of Toronto, referring to the original cities of Toronto, North York, Scarborough, York and Etobicoke, and the borough of East York. The team colours were revealed as red and gold, the former representing the country of Canada and the latter representing the Golden Horseshoe. The logo is a combination of the letter \"T\", \"O\" and the number 6, with a maple leaf in the middle. On October 1, 2020, the team announced that they had agreed to a partnership with Canlan Ice Sports for the team to play their inaugural season at Canlan Ice Sports \u2013 York. On the 13th of October, Tyler Tumminia stepped down as club chairperson to become interim NWHL commissioner.https://www.theicegarden.com/2020/10/13/21513812/nwhl-changes- governance-structure-new-commissioner-in-tyler-tumminia-womens-hockey-dani- rylan On the 20th of October, the club announced Digit Murphy as the first head coach in franchise history.https://www.theicegarden.com/2020/10/20/21525254/digit-murphy-named- head-coach-of-toronto-six-nwhl-womens-hockey == Team == === Roster === As of July 20, 2020. |} === General managers === * Mandy Cronin, 2020\u2013present ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:National Women's Hockey League (2015\u2013) teams Category:Ice hockey teams in Ontario Category:Ice hockey clubs established in 2020 Category:Women's ice hockey teams in Canada Category:2020 establishments in Ontario Category:Ice hockey teams in Toronto ",
