    "text": "The Gymnop\u00e9dies (), or Trois Gymnop\u00e9dies, are three piano compositions written by French composer and pianist Erik Satie. The first and third were published in 1888 and the second in 1895. ==History== Jeunes filles au bord de la mer, 1879 painting by Pierre Puvis de Chavannes, which may have inspired Satie for the atmosphere he wanted to evoke in his Gymnop\u00e9dies The work's unusual title comes from the French form of gymnopaedia, the ancient Greek word for an annual festival where young men danced naked \u2013 or perhaps simply unarmed. The source of the title has been a subject of debate. Satie and his friend Alexis Roland-Manuel maintained that he adopted it after reading Gustave Flaubert's novel Salammb\u00f4, while others see a poem by J. P. Contamine de Latour as the source of Satie's inspiration,Robert Orledge, Satie the Composer, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 207, since the first Gymnop\u00e9die was published in the magazine La Musique des familles in the summer of 1888 together with an excerpt of Latour's poem Les Antiques, where the term appears. {| | |Slanting and shadow-cutting a bursting stream Trickled in gusts of gold on the shiny flagstone Where the amber atoms in the fire gleaming Mingled their sarabande with the gymnopaedia. |} However, it remains uncertain whether the poem was composed before the music. Satie may have picked up the term from a dictionary such as Dominique Mondo's Dictionnaire de Musique, where gymnop\u00e9die is defined as a \"nude dance, accompanied by song, which youthful Spartan maidens danced on specific occasions\", following a similar definition from Jean-Jacques Rousseau's Dictionnaire de Musique. Later in 1888, the third Gymnop\u00e9die was published. The second Gymnop\u00e9die did not appear until seven years later, and its impending publication was announced in several editions of the Chat Noir and Auberge du Clou magazines. Pierre Puvis de Chavannes' symbolist paintings may have been an inspiration for the atmosphere Satie wanted to evoke with his Gymnop\u00e9dies.Steven Moore Whiting. Satie the Bohemian: From Cabaret to Concert Hall. Clarendon Press, 1999. , p. 129 ==Music== These short, atmospheric pieces are written in time, with each sharing a common theme and structure. #Lent et douloureux (D major / D minor) #Lent et triste (C major) #Lent et grave (A minor) The melodies of the pieces use deliberate, but mild, dissonances against the harmony, producing a piquant, melancholy effect that matches the performance instructions, which are to play each piece \"painfully\" (douloureux), \"sadly\" (triste), or \"gravely\" (grave). The first few bars of Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1 (shown below) consist of an alternating progression of two major seventh chords, the first on the subdominant, G, and the second on the tonic, D. : ew PianoStaff << ew Staff << ew Voice \\relative c { \\clef treble \\key d \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo \"Lent et douloureux\" \\voiceOne R2.

Claude Debussy, whose popularity was rising at the time, helped draw public attention to the work of his friend. Debussy expressed his belief that the second Gymnop\u00e9die did not lend itself to orchestration. (Orchestrations of this Gymnop\u00e9die were only realised many decades later, by other composers, and not frequently performed.) Thus, in February 1897, Debussy orchestrated the third and first only, reversing the numbering: Satie's first became Debussy's third, and vice versa. The score was then published in 1898. ==Legacy== From the second half of the 20th century on, the Gymnop\u00e9dies were often erroneously described as part of Satie's body of furniture music, perhaps because of John Cage's interpretation of them.Cage's Place in the Reception of Satie by Matthew Shlomowitz (1999) on Niclas Fogwall's Erik Satie website. Collectively, the Gymnop\u00e9dies are regarded as an important precursor to modern ambient music.Mark Prendergast, The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby \u2013 The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age, London: Bloomsbury, 2000, p. 6 The first and second Gymnop\u00e9dies were arranged by Dick Halligan for the group Blood, Sweat & Tears under the title \"Variations on a Theme by Erik Satie\" on the group's eponymous album, released in 1968. The recording received a Grammy Award the following year for Best Contemporary Instrumental Performance. In 1979, the English/Australian musical group Sky performed Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1 on their self-titled debut album. The track also appeared on Sky's 1984 compilation album Masterpieces, The Very Best of Sky. In 1980, Gary Numan produced a track called \"Trois Gymnopedies (First Movement)\", which appeared on the B-side of the single \"We Are Glass\". In 1999 the chord sequence was used in the Sunship remix of the song \"Flowers\" by girl band Sweet Female Attitude. All three pieces were arranged with percussion by the UK electronic duo Isan in 2006, in their signature analogue sound. Gymnop\u00e9dies have been heard in numerous movies and television shows. Examples include Louis Malle's My Dinner With Andre, the French thriller Diva, the documentary Man on Wire, Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums, and Woody Allen's Another Woman, all of which use Gymnop\u00e9die No. 1 in their soundtracks. In 2007 arranged the first and the third Gymnop\u00e9die for The 12 Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic. Jack DeJohnette included a tribute to Gymnop\u00e9dies in his 2016 album Return. In 2018, Fernando Perdomo included a portion of Gymnopedie No. 1 on his album \"Out to Sea\". In 2020, Perdomo released a full cover of the song. ==References== ==External links== * * * Public Domain Sheet Music of the Gymnop\u00e9dies at the Mutopia Project Category:1888 compositions Category:Compositions by Erik Satie Category:Compositions for solo piano Category:Greek Antiquity in art and culture ",
