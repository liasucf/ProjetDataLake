    "text": "Alaska Current in red. The Alaska Current is a southwestern warm-water current alongside the west coast of the North American continent. The current results from the northward diversion of a portion of the North Pacific Current. It forms a part of the Alaska Current and continues into the Alaskan Stream, which begins near Kodiak Island and flows southwestward along the Alaska Peninsula. The Alaska Current produces large clockwise eddies at two sites: west of the Queen Charlotte Islands (\"Queen Charlotte Eddy\" or \"Haida Eddies\") and west of Sitka, Alaska (\"Sitka Eddy\") == See also == * * * ==References== * Category:Climate of Alaska Category:Currents of the Pacific Ocean Category:Water in Alaska ",
