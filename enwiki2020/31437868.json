Crossville, TN == History == In 1898 the Art Circle, a local group of women that would gather to socialize, decided to collect and lend out books to the public from a room at the old Cumberland County High School (now the Military Museum). Due to its popularity, the first official Art Circle Public Library was opened in a former bank building in March 1939, and by 1975 the collection had expanded so much that a new building was built.Randleman, Susie \"Let ACPL be the \u2018destination\u2019 for your teenager this year\", \"The Crossville Chronicle\", January 24, 2011. In 2010, the collection had again expanded and needed a new home: after years of fundraising, the brand new ACPL building was opened just down the street from the 1975 building.Wattenbarger, Missy \"New Art Circle Library celebrates grand opening\", \"The Crossville Chronicle\", May 6, 2010. === New director === In late 2008, Library Director Debra Kokes retired after 37 years of service to the local community.\"Retirement celebration for former Director, Debra Kokes\", \"BookEnds\", February 2009. In mid-2009, Susie Randleman became the new Director of the ACPL.\"New Library Director\", \"BookEnds\", July 2009. === New library building === The groundbreaking for the new ACPL was held on October 1, 2008.

The new ACPL, opened on May 3, 2010, is a building, made with local Crab Orchard stone and craftsman-style detailing. At its center\u2014and reaching two and a half stories\u2014is the Carol Darling Reading Room, named for the ACPL\u2019s former chair of the Board of Trustees, and one of its most active supporters, who died in 2008. Above this main room are balconies on the second floor that look out onto murals painted by Nashville artist Keith Tucker. These murals depict historical scenes of the county\u2019s past and present.Nelson, Gary. \"Check it out: Finance committee approves library bid\", The Crossville Chronicle, September 2, 2008. The floor also includes a Young Adult room; a Children\u2019s Library room, which has a \u201cCounty Fair\u201d theme and incorporates carved carousel animals, also done by artist Keith Tucker; a small caf\u00e9; a used bookstore area; two pianos; and meeting rooms available for public use. The second floor holds adult fiction; the nonfiction collection; and the Tennessee Room, dedicated to local authors and works about the state. Many seating areas and tables are scattered throughout both floors for all to use. == Services == At the time of the move to the new building, the ACPL held a collection of over 44,000 print materials, 2,000 audio and over 1,600 video materials, as well as just over 100 print subscriptions available to the public.\"Art Circle Public Library - Crossville, Tennessee - Central Library\",\"EducationBug\", Retrieved April 4, 2011.

The archives intends to bring together documents and records that are held in offices across the county, and make them available to the public, which will be a lengthy process.Wattenbarger, Missy \"County's new archives facility now open to public\", \"The Crossville Chronicle\", September 8, 2010.
