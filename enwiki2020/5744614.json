    "text": "The Grevilleoideae are a subfamily of the flowering plant family Proteaceae. Mainly restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, it contains around 46 genera and about 950 species. Genera include Banksia, Grevillea, and Macadamia. ==Description== The Grevilleoideae grow as trees, shrubs, or subshrubs. They are highly variable, making a simple, diagnostic identification key for the subfamily essentially impossible to provide. One common and fairly diagnostic characteristic is the occurrence of flowers in pairs that share a common bract. However, a few Grevilleoideae taxa do not have this property, having solitary flowers or inflorescences of unpaired flowers. In most taxa, the flowers occur in densely packed heads or spikes, and the fruit is a follicle. ==Distribution and habitat== Grevilleoideae are mainly a Southern Hemisphere family. The main centre of diversity is Australia, with around 700 of 950 species occurring there, and South America also contains taxa. However, the Grevilleoideae are barely present in Africa; almost all of the Proteaceae taxa there belong to the subfamily Proteoideae. The Brabejum tree of Cape Town is the exception, and the only grevilleoid in Africa. ==Taxonomy== Stenocarpus sinuatus (firewheel tree) Lomatia silaifolia Telopea oreades, the Gippsland waratah Grevillea banksii Banksia sessilis (parrotbush) The framework for classification of the Proteaceae was laid by L.A.S. Johnson and Barbara Briggs in their 1975 monograph \"On the Proteaceae: the evolution and classification of a southern family\". Their classification has been refined somewhat over the ensuing three decades, most notably by Peter H. Weston and Nigel Barker in 2006. The Grevilleoideae are now considered one of five subfamilies of the Proteaceae. The placement and circumscription of the Grevilleoideae according to Weston and Barker can be summarised as: Family Proteaceae Juss. :Subfamily Bellendenoideae P.H.Weston(1 genus) :Subfamily Persoonioideae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs(2 tribes, 5 genera) :Subfamily Symphionematoideae P.H.Weston & N.P.Barker(2 genera) :Subfamily Proteoideae Eaton (4 tribes, 5 subtribes, 25 genera) :Subfamily Grevilleoideae Engl. ::incertae sedis ::::Sphalmium \u2014 Carnarvonia ::Tribe Roupaleae Meisn. :::incertae sedis ::::Megahertzia \u2014 Knightia \u2014 Eucarpha \u2014 Triunia :::Subtribe Roupalinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Roupala \u2014 Neorites \u2014 Orites :::Subtribe Lambertiinae (Venk.Rao) L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Lambertia \u2014 Xylomelum :::Subtribe Heliciinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Helicia \u2014 Hollandaea :::Subtribe Floydiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Darlingia \u2014 Floydia ::Tribe Banksieae Rchb. :::fossil form genera ::::Banksieaeidites \u2014 Banksieaeformis \u2014 Banksieaephyllum :::Subtribe Musgraveinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Musgravea \u2014 Austromuellera :::Subtribe Banksiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Banksia ::Tribe Embothrieae Rchb. :::Subtribe Lomatiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Lomatia :::Subtribe Embothriinae Endl. ::::Embothrium \u2014 Oreocallis \u2014 Alloxylon \u2014 Telopea :::Subtribe Stenocarpinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Stenocarpus \u2014 Strangea :::Subtribe Hakeinae Endl. ::::Opisthiolepis \u2014 Buckinghamia \u2014 Hakea \u2014 Grevillea \u2014 Finschia ::Tribe Macadamieae Venk.Rao :::Subtribe Macadamiinae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Macadamia \u2014 Panopsis \u2014 Brabejum :::Subtribe Malagasiinae P.H.Weston & N.P.Barker ::::Malagasia \u2014 Catalepidia :::Subtribe Virotiinae P.H.Weston & N.P.Barker ::::Virotia \u2014 Athertonia \u2014 Heliciopsis :::Subtribe Gevuininae L.A.S.Johnson & B.G.Briggs ::::Cardwellia \u2014 Sleumerodendron \u2014 Euplassa \u2014 Gevuina \u2014 Bleasdalea \u2014 Hicksbeachia \u2014 Kermadecia \u2014 Turrillia The tribes of Grevilleoideae given by Weston and Barker are shown below: ==Uses== Edible nuts of Macadamia The nursery industry cultivates many Grevilleoideae species as barrier plants and for their prominent and distinctive flowers and foliage. Some species are of importance to the cut-flower industry, especially some Banksia and Dryandra species. Two species of the genus Macadamia and the Chilean species Gevuina avellana (Chilean hazel) are grown commercially for edible nuts. Chilean hazel has an acceptable frost tolerance. ==References== ==External links== Category:Proteaceae Category:Eudicot subfamilies ",
