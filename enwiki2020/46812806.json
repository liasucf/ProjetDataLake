The line ran from 7 to 9pm each evening with calls being taken about a wide range of issues. Over the decades, the services broadened out to include counselling, group work and email support. In April 2000, MLGSS unified with Healthy Gay Manchester (HGM) to form the Lesbian & Gay Foundation, (The LGF).Attitude.co.uk, Lesbian and Gay foundation change their name to celebrate diversity.
