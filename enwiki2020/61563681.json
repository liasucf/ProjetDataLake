    "text": "The Galen Elementary School is a historic building in Macon County, Tennessee. It was built by Jimmy Bohanon in 1928\u201329. With It was a two-year feeder high school until 1960, when it closed down. One of the teachers was Harold Blankenship, who was interviewed in 1991. The building has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since February 22, 1993. It was built to a standard design for a two-year high school with grade school, which would have four classrooms, specifically plan 3-B for a \"Three-teacher school\". The plan was adapted somewhat, and one of the four classroom areas was split into a smaller classroom, a cloakroom, and a teacher's room. The standard plan specified that the building was \"To Face East or West Only\" and has classroom windows only on those sides; this implementation in fact faces east. When it opened it used one room for grades 1\u20134, another for 5\u20138, one for 9, and one for grade 10. Blankenship reported it never was used for a high school that students would graduate from, but rather served as an elementary school in its later years. The school was the first rural school in Macon County to have hot lunches, which started in 1941, with conversion of the small classroom into a kitchen.

It was in use as a rural schoolhouse until 1960. After that, it served as a community center, as a voting precinct, and as a meeting place for groups such as Home Demonstration Clubs. It was deemed significant \"as an excellent example of a local interpretation of a state school plan\". ==See also== *Belview School, a two-teacher schoolhouse also NRHP-listed, also in Macon County ==References== Category:1929 establishments in Tennessee Category:National Register of Historic Places in Macon County, Tennessee Category:School buildings completed in 1929 ",
