    "text": "Caf\u00e9 Psychologique is a grassroots public discussion initiative where people who are interested in psychology and psychological ways of thinking meet to discuss issues that are important to them. == Philosophy == Caf\u00e9 Psychologique follows the philosophy of Caf\u00e9 Scientifique in using invited experts and a discussion-based format to make specialist subjects accessible to a lay audience. Caf\u00e9 Psychologique is intended to bring the insights and methods of psychological therapies into accessible public spaces. The UK's Caf\u00e9 Psychologique movement was set up by a group analyst and adheres to the principles of group analysis by promoting a culture where groups can meet and talk in a way that benefits the participants and promotes psychological well- being. == Format == The caf\u00e9-based format is a combination of world caf\u00e9 and Pub Philosophy. Visiting experts introduce a theme for the session, and then participants discuss issues surrounding the theme as a large group. Guest therapists and psychologists participate in the discussions as invited. == History== The UK's first Caf\u00e9 Psychologique started in 2011 and meets in the Severn Arts Centre, Leeds. Other UK Caf\u00e9 Psychologiques include Liverpool, Wolverhampton and Manchester. There is also a Cafe Psychologique in Sydney, Australia. == See also == * Caf\u00e9 philosophique * Caf\u00e9 Scientifique * Collective intelligence * Group analysis * Public awareness of science ==References== Category:Scientific organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Psychology organisations based in the United Kingdom Category:Organizations established in 2011 ",
