The House of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle (Maison de La Tr\u00e9moille in French) was a French noble family from Poitou whose name comes from the village La Trimouille in the d\u00e9partment of Vienne. This family has been known since the middle of the 11th century, and since the 14th century its members have been conspicuous in French history as nobles, military leaders and crusaders, and influential as political leaders, diplomats, Huguenots and courtiers. The male line of the family died out in 1933, while female line heirs of the last duke have kept the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle surname alive in Belgium. == Lords and crusaders== Pierre, the first known seigneur (or sire) of La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, was settled in Poitou, and died after 1040. His descendant, Guy, accompanied Godefroy de Bouillon to the Holy Land as a crusader in 1096. Upon his return, he had the abbey of Reims rebuilt, and died after 1145. His son, Guillaume, joined the expedition of Louis VII of France to the Holy Land as a crusader. Guillaume's great-grandson, Thibaut, crusaded alongside St. Louis, and was killed, along with three of his sons, on 8 February 1250 in battle at Mansoura in Egypt. In 1269 another Guy de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, who is numbered \"I\" in the family lineage, paid homage to his liege, Alphonse, Count of Poitou, and died sometime after 1301. Guy IV (d. 1350), predeceased his father, Guy III, having been designated Grand Panetier of France. His son, Guy V (1346-1398), was called \"The Valiant\" according to P\u00e8re Anselme, being a renowned warrior, the confidante of Philip the Hardy of Burgundy, and later counselor in the service of Charles VI of France, whose Oriflamme he carried into battle against the English in 1382. He journeyed with Louis II, Duke of Bourbon on crusade to Africa, and died in Rhodes en route to France, having been ransomed in 1396 following imprisonment at Nicopolis. His son George (1382-1444), became Grand Chamberlain of France in 1406 and husband in 1416 of Joan II, Countess of Auvergne, thereby also acquiring the counties of Boulogne and Gu\u00eenes. His rivalry with Arthur de Richemont, rather than hostility to Joan of Arc, is believed to have slowed her crusade's momentum against the English, allowing them to capture and burn her at the stake in 1431.Pernoud, Marie- V\u00e9ronique and Clin, R\u00e9gine. Louis of Luxembourg. Joan of Arc: Her Story. Palgrave Macmillan. 1999. p. 80. . His family's rise to wealth and power made him a target, and he was ransomed after capture thrice; after the Battle of Agincourt, once again by the English, and at Chinon, whence he was taken from the king's side and held prisoner at Montr\u00e9sor. His grandson Louis II (1460-1525), commanded French troops in the conquest of Lombardy for Louis XII. Defeated and wounded fighting the Swiss at Novarra in 1513, he redeemed his reputation by raising the siege of Marseilles against the Constable de Bourbon's Imperial troops in 1523 before being killed at the Battle of Pavia in 1524. In 1485 he had wed the princesse du sang Gabrielle de Bourbon, daughter of Louis I, comte de Montpensier, subsequently marrying the daughter of Cesare Borgia. He inherited from his mother Marguerite d'Amboise, vicomtesse de Thouars, the title, \"prince de Talmond\", which Du Cange noted, in his Glossarium medi\u00e6 et infim\u00e6 latinitatis, had become attached to an allodial seigneurie in the Vend\u00e9e.Heraldica.org, Francois Velde, Talmond: A list of French Princes and Principalities, 21 January 2008, retrieved 7 November 2018 It was his grandson, Fran\u00e7ois de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle (1505-1541), who succeeded Louis II in his titles, his father Charles, prince de Talmond (1486-1515), having been killed at the Battle of Marignano. He was taken prisoner at the battle of Pavia at which his grandfather was killed, but was subsequently ransomed. Fran\u00e7ois wed the heiress Anne de Laval in 1521, who eventually brought to their descendants the pretendership to a royal throne. Their two younger sons, George (died 1584) and Claude (died 1566) founded, respectively, the branches of the marquis d'Royan (extinct 1698) and of the ducs de Noirmoutier (extinct 1733). The eldest son of Fran\u00e7ois de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, Louis III (1521-1577), was the first of his family to obtain ducal status when Charles IX conferred that honor upon him in 1563. His son with Jeanne de Montmorency, Claude (1566-1604), had the dukedom elevated into a peerage in 1595, although it was not registered as hereditary in the Parlement until 1599. He had converted to Protestantism and fought for the Huguenots during the French Wars of Religion at the battles of Coutras in 1587, Ivry in 1590 and Fontaine-Fran\u00e7aise in 1595, and at the sieges of Paris and Rouen. In 1598 he married Charlotte Brabantine of Orange-Nassau (1580-1631), daughter of the Protestant Dutch leader William the Silent. Claude's sister, Charlotte Catherine de La Tr\u00e9moille (d. 1619), married Henri I de Bourbon, prince de Cond\u00e9 (1552-1588) in 1586, but when he died suddenly six months before the birth of their only son in September 1588, she was imprisoned on suspicion of having poisoned her husband to prevent the child's rejection as a bastard, although the king recognized the child as premier prince du sang and heir presumptive to the crown until the birth of his own son, the future Louis XIII, in 1601. The third duc de Thouars, Henri (1599-1674), was present at the Siege of La Rochelle in October 1628, after which he was obliged to abjure Protestantism for Catholicism while face-to-face with the victorious Cardinal Richelieu. He fought for France thereafter, at Pas-de-Suze in 1629, at the siege of Corbie in 1636, and was wounded at Carignano in 1629. Of his marriage with his cousin in 1619, Marie de La Tour d'Auvergne (1601-1665), daughter of Henri, Duke of Bouillon, was born Henri-Charles de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle (1620-1672), fourth duc de Thouars and prince de Tarente. He lived much of his life outside of France, serving as a cavalry general in the service of the Estates of Holland and holding the post of governor of Bois-le-Duc. He married a German princess, Emilie of Hesse-Cassel (1626-1693), in 1648, and only returned to France and converted to Catholicism two years before his death, in September 1670. His great-grandson, Charles Armand Ren\u00e9 de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle (1683-1719) became the seventh duc de Thouars in father-to-son succession. He received the position of Premier Gentilhomme de la Chambre du Roi, which had become a family sinecure. In 1725 he married his cousin, Marie Hortense de La Tour d'Auvergne (1704-1788), daughter of Emmanuel-Th\u00e9odose, Duke of Bouillon. ==Claim to kingdom of Naples== In the 17th century the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle family put forth a claim to the throne of the Kingdom of Naples. Henry de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, in representation of his great-grandmother Anne de Laval (1505\u20131554), wife of Fran\u00e7ois de la Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, was the sole heir to King Frederick of Naples. Ferdinand I (1423-1494), an illegitimate son of King Alfonso V of Aragon, managed to become king of Naples in 1458, although upon his death his son Alfonso II (1452-1504) was driven out by France. Alfonso II's only legitimate child, Charlotte (1480-1506), was married in 1500 to Nicolas de Montmorency, comte de Laval. Her younger daughter Anne married in 1521 Louis I de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, vicomte de Thouars. By this connection the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle claimed the title \"Prince of Tarento\", along with the inheritance of Montmorency-Laval (it had passed to the Rieux family on the death of Guy XVI in 1531, then through Claude de Rieux, comtesse de Laval et Montfort, to Fran\u00e7ois de Coligny in 1547, and on the death in 1605 of his grandson Guy XX, to the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle). Henri-Charles (1599-1674), duc de Thouars, received royal confirmation of the rank of foreign prince in 1651; he bore as arms Quarterly Or a chevron gules between three eagles azure (La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle), France, Bourbon-Montpensier and Montmorency-Laval. His eldest son Charles-Belgique-Hollande (1655-1709) bore Quarterly France and Two-Sicilies, over all La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, the younger son Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric-Guillaume (d. 1739) was titled prince de Talmond; he acquired the lordship of Ch\u00e2tellerault and had it raised to a dukedom for his son in 1730, but the latter died without issue in 1759 and the title of Talmond returned to the eldest branch. The 13th and last duke of Thouars, 13th prince de Tarente and 17th prince de Talmond died in 1933. In 1643 he asserted his rights to that crown jure uxoris, and his descendants would continue to do so at various diplomatic conferences, in vain. Louis XIII, however, recognized the duc de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle's assumption of \"Prince of Taranto\" as a title of pretence and, by patent issued in 1629, granted him and his family the rank and prerogatives of princes \u00e9trangers at the French court.M\u00e9moires de la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 des antiquaires de l\u2019Ouest, 1867, page 40. In 1648, Louis XIV allowed him to send a representative in presented their claims before the Congress of Munster, where the Treaty of Westphalia was concluded. The princes de Tarente also sought to their dynastic rights recognized at the congresses of Munster, Nijmegen and Ryswyk, but without success.Marie-Nicolas Bouillet, Dictionnaire universel d'histoire et de g\u00e9ographie, Hachette, 1858, page 1009. On November 6, 1748 the La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle family made a final protest concerning their rights to the kingdom of Naples which had been yielded by the Treaty of Vienna of 1738 to the King of Sicily.Louis duc de La Tr\u00e9moille Les La Tr\u00e9moille pendant cinq si\u00e8cles, \u00c9diteur E. Grimaud, 1896, pages 88-91 \u00ab Derni\u00e8re protestation de la maison de La Tr\u00e9moille, relative \u00e0 ses droits sur le royaume de Naples \u00bb ==Extinction== Louis Jean Marie de La Tr\u00e9moille (8 February 1910 \u2013 9 December 1933), prince and 12th duc de La Tr\u00e9moille, 13th duc de Thouars, 13th prince de Tarente and 17th prince de Talmond,Almanach de Gotha, La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle. Justus Perthes, 1944, p.463. French. was the only son and heir of Louis Charles de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, 12th duc de Thouars and 12th Prince of Taranto, and was the last male of the historic La Tr\u00e9moille family. He died, unmarried and childless, at the age of 23 at the estate of Leander J. McCormick (son of L. Hamilton McCormick) in Whitchurch, Hampshire. It was noted in the New York Times at the time that his mysterious death by fire in England evoked the martyrdom at English hands of Joan of Arc five centuries earlier, who had been betrayed by the young duke's ancestor, Georges de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle, founder of the family's fortune in France. Although the 1944 Almanach de Gotha states that his successor, as 14th duchesse de Thouars, was the eldest of his four sisters, Charlotte (1892-1971), the Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels of 1991 refrains from doing so,Genealogisches Handbuch des Adels, Furstlicher Hauser Bande XIV, C.A. Starke Verlag, Ligne, Limburg, 1991, pp. 498-499. German. a 1959 ruling of the French courts having found that hereditary titles may only be transmitted \"male-to-male\" in \"modern law\".Heraldica.org, Francois Velde, Nobility and Titles in France, 18 June 2008, retrieved 31 July 2011 The original grant of the dukedom, in July 1563 by Charles IX, stipulated that it was heritable by both male and female successors, although when erected into a pairie by Henry IV in 1599, the letters patent restricted succession to the peerage\u2014but not the dukedom\u2014to male heirs, restrictions inapplicable to the title of pretence, Prince of Taranto, traditionally borne by the representative heir to the historical throne of Naples, which was heritable in the female line. The only son of the 1910 marriage of Charlotte de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle with Prince Henri Florent de Ligne (1881-1967), head of the Antoing cadet branch of that princely family, had de La Tr\u00e9mo\u00eflle appended to his own surname in the Kingdom of Belgium as \"Jean Charles, Prince de Ligne de La Tr\u00e9moille\" (1911-2005) on 20 December 1934, and his only son, Prince Charles- Antoine (born 1946), bears the same title and name. ==Doubts about extinction== Although the main branch is extinct, it seems that the Maison de La Tr\u00e9moille remains since the journalist and photographer Georges de La Tr\u00e9moille is mentioned, on , during the TF1 https://www.lci.fr/international/maree-noire-a-maurice-la-france-vient-en- aide-al-ile-depuis-la-reunion- apres-echouement-wakashio-2161237.html newscast and as well as in several newspaper articles such as Le Monde https://www.lemonde.fr/planete/article/2020/08/ 08 / when-biodiversity-is-in- danger-there-is-an-urgency-to-act-in-France-announces-help-against-the-oil- spill-in-maurice_6048485_3244.html , Euronewshttps://www.euronews.com/2020/08/08/mauritius-declares-state-of- environmental-emergency-after-oil-leak-from-stranded-ship and Sky Newshttps://news.sky.com/story/mauritius-declares-environmental-emergency- after-mass-oil-spill-from-grounded-tanker-12044845. ==Chief line== Viscounts of Thouars (elevated to duke 1563), Princes of Talmont, etc. * Louis I de La Tr\u00e9moille * Louis II de La Tr\u00e9moille, son, called the chevalier sans reproche (\"knight beyond reproach\"), defeated and captured Francis II, Duke of Brittany at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du-Cormier (1488), distinguished himself in the Italian Wars, and was killed at the Battle of Pavia (1525). * Charles I de La Tr\u00e9moille, son, died in his father's lifetime and under his command at the Battle of Marignano (1515). * Fran\u00e7ois II de La Tr\u00e9moille, son, acquired a claim on the Kingdom of Naples by his marriage with Anne de Laval, daughter of Charlotte of Aragon * Louis III de La Tr\u00e9moille, son, became duke of Thouars in 1563, and his son ** Charlotte Catherine de La Tr\u00e9moille, princesse de Cond\u00e9 (1568\u20131629) daughter of the above * Claude de La Tr\u00e9moille, son, turned Protestant, was created a peer of France in 1595, and married a daughter of William the Silent in 1598. ** Charlotte de La Tr\u00e9moille, Countess of Derby, daughter * Henri de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Claude, 3rd duke of Thouars (died 1674) * Henri Charles de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Henry (died 1672) * Charles Belgique Hollande de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Henry, 4th duke of Thouars (died 1709) ** Marie Armande Victoire de La Tr\u00e9moille, daughter of the above, wife of Emmanuel Th\u00e9odose de La Tour d'Auvergne * Charles Louis Bretagne de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Charles-Belgique, 5th duke of Thouars (died 1719) * Charles Armand Ren\u00e9 de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Charles-Louis, 6th duke of Thouars (died 1741) * Jean Bretagne Charles de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Charles-Armand, 7th duke of Thouars (died 1792) * Charles Bretagne Marie de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Jean- Bretagne, 8th duke of Thouars (died 1839) * Louis Charles de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Charles-Bretagne, 9th duke of Thouars (died 1911) * Louis Charles Marie de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Louis-Charles, 10th duke of Thouars (died 1921) * Louis Jean Marie de La Tr\u00e9moille, son of Louis-Charles-Marie, 11th duke of Thouars (died without issue 1933) ==Branches== The family was divided into several branches including, among others: * viscounts and dukes of Thouars * dukes of La Tr\u00e9moille * princes of Talmont * princes of Tarente * dukes of Ch\u00e2tellerault * dukes of Noirmoutier * marquis of Royan * count of Joigny ==Notable family members== * Guy de la Tr\u00e9moille, standard-bearer of France, was taken prisoner at the Battle of Nicopolis (1396), and * Georges de la Tr\u00e9moille (c. 1382 - 6 May 1446) was count de Gu\u00eenes, the favorite of King Charles VII of France, took part in the Praguerie and was captured at Battle of Azincourt (1415). * Jean de la Tr\u00e9moille (1377-1449) * Marie Anne de La Tr\u00e9moille, princesse des Ursins (1642\u20131722) ==References== * Tremoille ",
