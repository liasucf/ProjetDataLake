The station also has an integrated urban bus terminal with lines that attend Areas 3 (yellow) and 4 (red). ==History== Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio station originated in a controverse project for expansion of Metro East-West Line to Guaianazes, initiated in 1987. Although the studies of S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitan Company didn't recommend the expansion of the line, Governor Qu\u00e9rcia's administration started the construction anyway. Initiated in an official ceremony on 14 October 1987, the construction of Jos\u00e9 Bonif\u00e1cio station was put on hold right after because of lack of funds, blocked by Brazilian Development Bank (BNDES) because of Metro debts with the bank. On May 1988, the construction work was resumed, but in slow motion, as the Metro priority was the Paulista Branch. After a slow progress, the station construction was put on hold again in 1992. The construction was only resumed in 1995, when they were transferred to CPTM, which could renegotiate the loan with BNDES. The station was opened on 27 May 2000. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 2000 Category:2000 establishments in Brazil ",
