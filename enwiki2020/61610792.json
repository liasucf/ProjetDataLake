However, the summit has been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Planned venue== ===Attempt to hold summit at Trump resort=== The choice of the summit's location was controversial. The Secret Service initially vetted ten sites for the summit and reduced that list to four (in Hawaii, Utah, California, and North Carolina). They then eliminated the California and North Carolina sites, and added, at Trump's direction, the option of hosting at Trump National Doral in Miami. On October 17, 2019, Trump's acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney announced the summit would be held at the Trump National Doral, dismissing concerns about potential conflict of interests and the prospect of a president personally profiting from an official event. Trump initially touted the benefits of using his resort for the conference and called the selection \"something very good for our Country\" but, two days later, after bipartisan criticism, announced that the G7 summit would no longer be held at Doral, blaming \"Media & Democrat Crazed and Irrational Hostility\" on his Twitter account. At the time of the announcement, Trump was the target of two lawsuits--D.C. and Maryland v. Trump and CREW v. Trump-- alleging that he was violating the U.S. Constitution's foreign and domestic emoluments clauses because of payments received from the Saudi government and other foreign governments for stays at his Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C. Legal experts debated whether hosting the G7 at a Trump-owned property would violate the Constitution's emoluments clauses. ===Selection of Camp David=== A Lodge at Camp David photographed in 1959. On December 3, 2019 it was announced that the summit would be held at Camp David, the country retreat of the President of the United States. The same venue hosted the group's 38th summit in 2012. ==Postponements== In response to the coronavirus pandemic, Trump canceled the G7 at Camp David and said that the meeting would be conducted by video conference, as in the case of an G7 session held on 16 April 2020.Video conference with G7 leaders Roundtable (16/04/20, Brussels), European Commission.

British Prime Minister Boris Johnson also suggested that he favored an in-person gathering. On May 30, 2020, Trump delayed the summit until at least September 2020. In August 2020, Trump said that he wanted to delay the summit until after the November 2020 election.Orion Rummler, Trump says G7 summit will be delayed until after the election, Axios (August 10, 2020). ==Invitees== Trump named India, Australia, Brazil, South Korea, and Russia as potential invitees to the summit, and said \"I don't feel that as a G7 it properly represents what's going on in the world. It's a very outdated group of countries.\" Trump's aides said that China would be a subject of G7+ discussions, but not a part of it,Chidanand Rajghatta, G7 Countries: Donald Trump wants to expand G7 to G10/11 to Include India, Times News Network (Times of India (May 31, 2020). and said that Trump intended to use the summit to build an anti-China bloc.

(Russia was admitted to the G7 in 1997, but was expelled from the group in 2014 due to its aggressive actions, including the annexation of Crimea.) However, Trump's proposal to invite Putin was staunchly opposed by the UK and Canada. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said that Russia's \"continued disrespect and flaunting of international rules and norms is why it remains outside of the G7 and why it will continue to remain out\" and a spokesman for the British government said that Russia should not be readmitted to the group \"unless it ceases aggressive and destabilizing activity that threatens the safety of UK citizens and the collective security of our allies.\"Julian Borger, Donald Trump offers to invite Vladimir Putin to expanded G7 summit, The Guardian (June 1, 2020). The European Union agreed that Russia should not be readmitted to the G7, with EU chief diplomat Josep Borrell, the High Representative of the EU for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, explaining that Trump did not have the unilateral power to change the permanent membership of the G7 or its scope: \"The prerogative of the G7 chair, in this case the United States, is to issue guest invitations -- guest invitations reflect the host's priorities. But changing membership, changing the format on a permanent basis, is not a prerogative of the G7 chair.\"Donald Trump does not have the power to change G7 format: EU, Agence France-Presse (June 2, 2020). On August 10, 2020, Trump said that he has not decided whether to invite Putin. ==Participants== Participants will include the leaders of the G7 member states as well as representatives of the European Union. The President of the European Commission has been a permanently welcome participant at all meetings and decision-making since 1981. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- |colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align: center; background:Gainsboro\" |Core G7 members Hosting member shown in bold text. |- style=\"background:LightSteelBlue; text- align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | Member ! scope=\"col\" | Represented by ! scope=\"col\" |Title |- | !scope=\"row\"| Canada | Justin Trudeau | Prime Minister |- | !scope=\"row\"| France | Emmanuel Macron | President |- | !scope=\"row\"| Germany | Angela Merkel | Chancellor |- | !scope=\"row\"| Italy | Giuseppe Conte | Prime Minister |- | !scope=\"row\"| Japan | Yoshihide Suga | Prime Minister |- | !scope=\"row\"| | Boris Johnson | Prime Minister |- | !scope=\"row\"| United States |Donald Trump | President |- | rowspan=\"2\" | !scope=\"row\" rowspan=\"2\" | European Union | Ursula von der Leyen | Commission President |- | Charles Michel | Council President |- |colspan=\"4\" style=\"text- align: center; background:Gainsboro\" |Invitees |- style=\"background:LightSteelBlue; text-align:center;\" ! scope=\"col\" colspan=2 | Member ! scope=\"col\" | Represented by ! scope=\"col\" |Title |- | !scope=\"row\"| Australia | Scott Morrison | Prime Minister |- | !scope=\"row\"| Brazil | Jair Bolsonaro | President |- | !scope=\"row\"| India | Narendra Modi | Prime Minister |- | !scope=\"row\"| South Korea | Moon Jae-in | President |} ==Agenda== ===Climate change=== Trump did not take part in the climate change mitigation discussions during the 44th meetings held in Canada or the 45th meetings held in France.
