The Solovki special camp (later the Solovki special prison), was set up in 1923 on the Solovetsky Islands in the White Sea as a remote and inaccessible place of detention, primarily intended for socialist opponents of Soviet Russia's new Bolshevik regime. The first book on Gulag, namely, In the Claws of the GPU (1934) by Franci\u0161ak Aljachnovi\u010d, described the Solovki prison camp. At first, the Anarchists, Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries enjoyed a special status there and were not made to work. Gradually, prisoners from the old regime (priests, gentry, and White Army officers) joined them and the guards and the ordinary criminals worked together to keep the \"politicals\" in order. This was the nucleus from which the entire Gulag grew, thanks to its proximity to the first great construction project of the Five-Year Plans, the White Sea\u2013Baltic Canal. In one way, Solovki and the White Sea Canal broke a basic rule of the Gulag: they were both far too close to the border.Dmitriev comment This facilitated a number of daring escapes in the 1920s; as war loomed in the late 1930s it led to the closure of the Solovki special prison. Its several thousand inmates were transferred elsewhere, or shot on the mainland and on Solovki. ==The \"mother of the Gulag\"== Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn called Solovki the \"mother of the GULAG\". === From monastery to concentration camp=== Historically, the Solovetsky Islands were the location of the famous Russian Orthodox Solovetsky Monastery complex. It was a centre of economic activity with over three hundred monks, and also a forepost of Russian naval power in the North, repelling foreign attacks during the Time of Troubles, the Crimean War, and the Russian Civil War. In the autumn of 1922 the process of transitioning from a monastery to concentration camp began. All wooden buildings were burnt and many of the monks were murdered, including the Igumen. The remaining monks were sent to forced labour camps in central Russia. The unpublished decree of 3 November 1923 led to the conversion of the monastery buildings into the Solovki \"special\" camp: the Solovetsky Lager Osobogo Naznachenia or SLON in Russian\u0421\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041b\u0430\u0433\u0435\u0440\u044c \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f (\u0421\u041b\u041e\u041d). (the acronym is a play on the Russian word for elephant). One of the first \"forced labor camps\", Solovki served as a prototype for the Gulag as a whole.Gulag by Anne Applebaum.

The treatment of the prisoners in the Soviet-era camp attracted much criticism in Western Europe and the USA. After a thorough clean-up, the Soviet government sent the proletarian writer Maxim Gorky there in an attempt to counter this negative publicity. He wrote a very favourable essay, which praised the beauty of nature on the islands, but some authors believe he understood the real conditions he was witnessing. See pp. 242\u2013243. See p.188. === The Baltic-White Sea Canal === The exact number of prisoners sent to Solovki from 1923 to the closure of its penitentiary facilities in 1939 is unknown. Estimates range between tens and hundreds of thousands.\"Forced Labor Camps\" , on-line exhibition at the Open Society Archives. In 1923, Soloviki contained \"no more than 3,000\" prisoners; by 1930, the number had jumped to \"about 50,000\", with another 30,000 held on the mainland at the nearest railhead of Kem. In the early 1930s, many of the prisoners from the camp worked on the notorious White Sea \u2013 Baltic Canal, one of a succession of grandiose schemes devised by Stalin. ===A Special Prison, 1936-1939=== In 1936, the Solovki camp was renamed a \"special\" prison (STON, an acronym that reads \"Groan\" in Russian) and from then until its closure in 1939 it served as a holding area for many prisoners subsequently executed, there or on the mainland, during the Great Terror of 1937\u20131938.\"The Victims at Sandarmokh\", The Dmitriev Affair website . Until documents confirming their execution were found in 1996, it was long thought that a transport of over one thousand prisoners, a quota for \"1st category arrests\" (executions), died from drowning after the barges on which they were travelling were deliberately sunk in the White Sea.\"Sandarmokh\" It is now known that they were shot on the mainland in late October and early November 1937; subsequent quotas for execution came too late in the year to sail across the White Sea and were shot on the islands, near Sekirnaya Hill.A 12 October 2017 news item by Meduza, includes footage of Yury Dmitriev supervising work to clear the burial pits at Sekirnaya gora. All but five of the 1,116 prisoners sent from Solovki across the White Sea on 27 October 1937 were executed by NKVD Captain and senior executioner Mikhail Matveyev at Sandarmokh between that date and 10 November 1937, when he reported his task complete. Among those killed were 289 members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia, the Executed Renaissance. A further transport was prepared to sail to the mainland for execution, but it was too late in the year to cross the frozen sea. Instead, between 200 and 300 prisoners were shot on Solovki itself, near the Sekirnaya Hill.A. Razumov (n.d.), Skorbny put, pp. 13-14 One of the many victims was Yelizaveta Katz, an engineer, who was 8 months pregnant. She was due to be shot with the others on 17 February 1938, but was allowed to give birth, then shot three months later on 16 May, aged 28.A. Razumov (n.d.), Skorbny put, pp. 14-16 In 1939, the prison was closed. It was situated too close to the border with Finland, and the Second World War was imminent. The buildings were transformed into a naval base and a cadet corps was deployed there. (One of its students was the future author Valentin Pikul.) === World Heritage and a disputed legacy === In 1989, a permanent exhibition, \"The Solovki special camp\", was added to the museum on the islands, the first anywhere in the USSR to be devoted to the Gulag. In June of that year, the first Days of Remembrance for Victims of Political Repression were held on the islands; in subsequent years this event would take place in August.The history of the Solovki Museum, 1975-1998 The Orthodox Church reestablished the monastery in 1992, and that year the ensemble was added to UNESCO's World Heritage List. In 2015, human rights activists expressed disquiet that the authorities were \"gradually removing all traces of the labor camp\". In January 2016 the Gulag section in the Solovki Museum was closed by its new director, Vladimir Shutov who, as Archimandrite Porfiry, was head of the monastery.\"Head of Museum's disbanded Gulag section is threatened with eviction\", Dmitriev Affair website, 18 February 2018. In August 2017, the local authorities asked police to investigate the 29th annual Days of Remembrance as an \"unauthorised\" gathering.Sergey Markelov, Elena Bayakina, \"Police check the rally in memory of victims of political repressions\", 7x7 news website, 9 August 2017. Early in 2018, a court in the Arkhangelsk Region heard an unsuccessful plea by Archimandrite Porfiry to annul a contract concluded in 2011 with the head of the now disbanded Gulag section of the museum and evict its former head, Olga Bochkaryova, and her daughter from their two-room apartment.\"Court upholds Bochkaryova's right to apartment\", Dmitriev Affair website, 20 February 2018. The author of several books about Solovki, Yury Brodsky, was accused by an Orthodox website of displaying \"religious hatred\" in his latest publication.Vera Vasilyeva and Robert Coalson, \"Russian historian accused of 'Religious hatred' over account of Solovki Gulag\", RFE/RL, 10 February 2018. == Notable prisoners == Memorial to the victims of political repression in the USSR, on Lubyanka Square, Moscow, next to FSB headquarters, made of a boulder from the Solovetsky Islands Memorial to the victims of political repression in the USSR, in St. Petersburg, made of a boulder from the Solovetsky Islands Members of the intelligentsia, representing both Tsarist Russia and the post-revolutionary USSR, were prominent among the prisoners on Solovki.Application for UNESCO World Heritage Site , 1991, p. 11. ===The 1920s=== In the 1920s many of those sent to Solovki were released, but often arrested and imprisoned (or exiled) a second time. * Franci\u0161ak Aljachnovi\u010d, Belarusian writer, a citizen of interwar Poland, who wrote the first book-length witness-account about Gulag, titled, In the Claws of the GPU; imprisoned 1927-1933, in 1933 exchanged with Poland for Branis\u0142a\u016d Tara\u0161kievi\u010d. * Vladimir Artemyev, inventor: imprisoned 1923-1925 * Osip Braz, Russian-Jewish realist painter: imprisoned 1924-1926 * Leonid Feodorov, Bishop and Exarch of the Russian Greek Catholic Church: imprisoned 1923-1929 * Konstantine Gamsakhurdia, Georgian writer: imprisoned mid-1920s * G.J.Gordon, historian: * A.K.Gorsky (:ru:\u0413\u043e\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439, \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447), poet: sent to Solovki (?) in 1929 * Jamo bey Hajinski, State Controller and Minister of Transportation, Postal Service and Telegraph of Azerbaijan Democratic Republic: imprisoned 1925-1928 * Archimandrite Illarion (Troitsky, :ru:\u0418\u043b\u0430\u0440\u0438\u043e\u043d (\u0422\u0440\u043e\u0438\u0446\u043a\u0438\u0439)), Professor of the Moscow Theological Academy: imprisoned 1924-1929 * I.V.
