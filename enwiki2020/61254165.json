    "text": "Heute hier, morgen dort (German for \"Here today, tomorrow there\" or \"day to day\") is a song by Hannes Wader. It first appeared in 1972 on his album 7 Lieder (7 Songs). The melody comes from the song Indian Summer by the American musician Gary Bolstad, who studied veterinary medicine in Berlin in the 1960s and performed in folk clubs. The German text is by Hannes Wader. In 1997, Bolstad translated, again in the US, Wader's text into English again. The result, Day to Day, Wader sang in 1998 on the live album appearance: Hannes Wader. In 2001 he sang the original version Indian Summer for the album W\u00fcnsche for the first time. Heute hier, morgen dort was with his catchy melody and - compared to many other Wader songs - little complex text to a kind of modern folk song. The title of the song has also become a phrase in German colloquialism. The song describes the lifestyle of a person who is always on the move, never asks for \"yesterday and tomorrow\", but occasionally has \"heavy dreams\". The \"I\" expresses its external and internal mobility in the light of the general principle of constant change in the world to which it gives itself in its way of life. The title and lyrics of the song are based on the tradition and way of life of the Wandervogel movement of the early 20th century. In general, songwriters are often associated with the tradition of moving singers, which makes appear Heute hier, morgen dort as a kind of anthem of this group of artists. In this sense, Michael K\u00f6hler in the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung called the song a \"song about the multiple impressions that like him [sc. Wader] encounter in unsteady touring life.\" Since 1972 Wader always starts his concerts with this piece. Only in the meantime, when it became too monotonous for him, he played Gut wieder hier zu sein as the first piece, but changed again after two years to Heute hier, morgen dort. According to his own statement this was done at the request of his audience and he does not plan to change this again. == Cover version == A French version of the song was created under the title Je suis ci, je suis l\u00e0 by the German-Belgian chanson singer Didier Caesar from Konstanz as commissioned work. She was approved by Hannes Wader, who also speaks French. The version is used in meetings between twinning companies and when traveling to France in the context of pupil exchange. == References == Category:German folk songs Category:1972 songs Category:German songs Category:1972 singles ",
