    "text": "The First Portuguese Republic (; officially: Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa, Portuguese Republic) spans a complex 16-year period in the history of Portugal, between the end of the period of constitutional monarchy marked by the 5 October 1910 revolution and the 28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat. The latter movement instituted a military dictatorship known as Ditadura Nacional (national dictatorship) that would be followed by the corporatist Estado Novo (new state) regime of Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar. The sixteen years of the First Republic saw nine presidents and 44 ministries, and were altogether more of a transition between the Kingdom of Portugal and the Estado Novo than they were a coherent period of governance. == Religion == The First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. The leaders of the Republic were secularists and, indeed, were following liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, \"The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualist middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.\"Payne, A history of Spain and Portugal (1973) 2: 559 Under the leadership of Afonso Costa, the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 October \u2013 five days after the inauguration of the Republic \u2013 the new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship. A series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by Afonso Costa culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911. The republicans were anticlerical and had a \"hostile\" approach to the issue of church and state separation, like that of the French Revolution, and the future Mexican Constitution of 1917 and Spanish Constitution of 1931. On 24 May 1911, Pope Pius X issued the encyclical Iamdudum which condemned the anticlericalism of the new republic for its deprivation of religious civil liberties and the \"incredible series of excesses and crimes which has been enacted in Portugal for the oppression of the Church.\"IAMDUDUM: ON THE LAW OF SEPARATION IN PORTUGAL Papal Encyclicals Online The Republic repelled a royalist attack on Chaves in 1912. ==Heads of state and government== The First Portuguese Republic was an unstable period in the History of Portugal. In a period of 16 years (1910\u20131926) Portugal had 8 Presidents of the Republic, 1 Provisional Government, 38 Prime Ministers and 1 Constitutional Junta: ==Evaluation of the republican experiment and legacy== Most historians have emphasized the failure and collapse of the republican dream by the 1920s. Jos\u00e9 Miguel Sardica in 2011 summarized the consensus of historians: Portuguese flag dates back to the First Republic. Sardica, however, also points up the lasting effects of the republican experiment: ==References== ==Further reading== * Leal, Ernesto Castro. \"Parties and political identity: the construction of the party system of the Portuguese Republic (1910\u20131926).\" E-journal of Portuguese History 7#1 (2009): 37\u201344.
