The station is owned by the University of Arkansas, with studios near the school's campus in downtown Fayetteville. Its powerful 100,000-watt signal also serves Fort Smith as well. Most of the day, the station airs news programming, both locally produced and nationally syndicated from NPR, but classical music is aired during the mid-morning and overnight hours. KUAF's studios in Fayetteville KUAF began broadcasting in 1973 as a student-run station using a small transmitter on 88.9 FM which sent a signal that reached most of the U of A campus and parts of surrounding Fayetteville. The station was supervised by a faculty member in the Department of Journalism at the University of Arkansas. Students studying radio, television, and film were given the opportunity to volunteer for various time slots available throughout the week. Aside from a few mandatory promos and songs, students were free to play whatever music was of interest to them. Many listeners referred to the station as \"the 10-watt wonder\". In 1985, KUAF joined the NPR network, giving western Arkansas its first NPR station. KUAF became the first station in its market to sign-on with an HD Radio signal in 2006. While KUAF HD1 repeats the station's regular FM signal, KUAF HD2 broadcasts around-the-clock classical music from Classical 24, and KUAF HD3 broadcasts news and information programming from NPR, overnight world news from the BBC World Service, and programming from independent producers. ==References== ==External links== * * * UAF Category:News and talk radio stations in the United States Category:NPR member stations Category:Radio stations established in 1973 Category:1973 establishments in Arkansas ",
