By 1983/84, Reebok accounted for 70% of Pentland's turnover. Pentland's shares rose from 0.55 at the start of 1984 to 3 by the end of the year, and up to 10 in June 1985, while profits rose from 1 million in 1983 to 12.9 million in 1985.

He later became chairman and chief executive of Pentland, remaining so until 1998 when he split his role and appointed his son, Andrew, as chief executive. Pentland was taken private in 1999 to focus on longer-term investments.
