Then, the Spanish forces entered and took possession of the fortress (Spanish: tomando la fortaleza a placer). For the cowardice demonstrated at Valkenburg, the English troops were rejected by the Dutch rebel army at Leiden, and finally Chester's troops surrendered to the Spanish army.From England, Colonel Edward Chester brought five companies to nearby Valkenburg Castle. Orange wanted to get these men into Leiden, but they fled as Spanish units approached the castle, and were subsequently denied admission to Leiden because of their cowardice. James Tracy p.II Soon after, the English forces at Alphen (now called Alphen aan den Rijn, southwest Leiden), were defeated as well, and at Gouda, another English force was surprised and defeated by a contingent of Spanish troops, with the loss of 300 men and three colours for the English.Mark Charles Fissel p.41 In April 1574, Francisco de Vald\u00e9s halted the siege of Leiden, to face the invading rebel army led by Louis of Nassau and Henry of Nassau-Dillenburg (brothers of Prince William of Orange), but the Spanish forces commanded by General Don Sancho d'Avila reached them first, leading to the Battle of Mookerheyde.The History of The Netherlands (Complete). John Lothrop Motley The Dutch suffered a disastrous defeat, losing at least 3,000 men, with both Louis and Henry killed.Radhey Shyam Chaurasia p.256 Finally, the rebel army dispersed due to lack of pay.Dictionary of Battles and Sieges: F-O.
