    "text": "350px Portrait of Madame Brunet is an oil painting on canvas by \u00c9douard Manet, begun in 1861 and completed in 1863. Its subject is Caroline de P\u00e8ne, the wife of the sculptor Eug\u00e8ne Cyrille Brunet.Manet, \u00c9douard, Mary Anne Stevens, and Lawrence W. Nichols. Manet: Portraying Life. Toledo: Toledo Museum of Art. 2012. p. 191. According to Duret the she was not beautiful and \u2013 although Manet flattered her \u2013 she burst into tears when she first saw the painting. It originally depicted the sitter full-length, but by 1867 Manet had cut away the bottom section. The tonality of the painting, with its emphasis on black, shows the influence of Spanish art, and Diego Vel\u00e1zquez in particular. Vel\u00e1zquez's Philip IV as a Hunter has been suggested as a likely inspiration for the landscape background. The painting was acquired from the private Payne-Whitney collection in New York (largely built up by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney) by the J. Paul Getty Museum in 2011.http://www.getty.edu/art/collection/objects/258736/edouard-manet- portrait-of-madame-brunet-french-1861-to-1863/acquisition 2011 ==Title== Vel\u00e1zquez, Philip IV as a Hunter, c. 1632\u20131634, Museo del Prado When first exhibiting the work in 1867, Manet entitled it Portrait of Madame B.. At that exhibition Moreau-N\u00e9laton referred to it as La Parisienne de 1862 (The Parisian Woman of 1862). Tabarant stated its subject to be Madame Brunet, n\u00e9e Penne, and called the painting La Femme au gant (Woman with a Glove). In 1902, Th\u00e9odore Duret retitled the work Jeune dame en 1860 (Young Woman in 1860). The work was mocked by the popular press and refused by its subject, remaining in Manet's studio for a long time. It appears in the inventory of his works as number 14 with the title Woman with a Glove, Fashion of 1850, being retitled Young Woman of 1860 at the 1884 sale of his works. Rouart-Wildenstein 1975 tome I, p. 27 Just after the sale, Durand-Ruel sold it to Jacques-\u00c9mile Blanche, who sold on the painting around 1930 to the galerie Knoedler in Paris. It was then acquired by Mrs Charles S. Payson n\u00e9e Joan Witney. == References== ==Bibliography== * Timothy James Clark, The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and His Followers, Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1999, 376 p.
