The edifice dates from the thirteenth century, having been erected on the site of an earlier building that was destroyed during the Massacre at B\u00e9ziers in the Albigensian Crusade. The cathedral was formerly the seat of the Bishopric of B\u00e9ziers, which was dissolved by the Concordat of 1801 and annexed into the Diocese of Montpellier. == Views of the Cathedral == File:B\u00e9ziers Cathedral and Old Bridge002.JPG File:B\u00e9ziers Cathedral and Old Bridge008.JPG File:B\u00e9ziers Cathedral and Old Bridge010.JPG File:B\u00e9ziers - Pont-Vieux (H\u00e9rault).JPG File:B\u00e9ziers - Vue du Pont vieux et de la cath\u00e9drale depuis l'Orb.jpg File:B\u00e9ziers Cathedral and Old Bridge004.JPG == Gallery == File:Statue of Mother of God and B\u00e9ziers Cathedral.JPG|Statue of the Mother of God File:Orgue de la cath\u00e9drale St Nazaire de B\u00e9ziers08.jpg|Organ decorated with figures playing a wooden flute and violin File:Orgue de la cath\u00e9drale St Nazaire de B\u00e9ziers05.jpg|Figures with a harp and lute File:Orgue de la cath\u00e9drale St Nazaire de B\u00e9ziers10.jpg|King David on the left grandstand File:Orgue de la cath\u00e9drale St Nazaire de B\u00e9ziers12.jpg|Saint Cecilia on the right grandstand File:Rochelongue 119 B\u00e9ziers.JPG|Street leading up to the cathedral * Catholic Encyclopedia: Diocese of B\u00e9ziers, in article on Montpellier Category:Former cathedrals in France Category:Fortified church buildings in France Category:Churches in H\u00e9rault Category:B\u00e9ziers ",
