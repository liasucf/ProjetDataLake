    "text": "Nelly Kim Furtado (, ; born December 2, 1978) is a Portuguese-Canadian singer- songwriter and record producer. Furtado is known for her musical versatility and reinvention, commonly associated with world music. She first gained fame with her trip hop inspired debut album, Whoa, Nelly! (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, \"I'm Like a Bird\" and \"Turn Off the Light\". The first of the two singles won her a Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, Folklore explored her Portuguese roots. Its singles received moderate success in Europe, but the album's underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a sophomore slump. Furtado's third album, Loose (2006), was a smash hit and became her best selling album with more than 12 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the best selling albums of the 2000s. Considered a radical image reinvention, Furtado continued to explore her Latin heritage while leaning heavier into hip hop. The album spawned four successful number one singles worldwide; \"Promiscuous\", \"Maneater\", \"Say It Right\", and \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\". Her Timbaland collaboration \"Give It to Me\" (2007) in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas. Furtado's critically acclaimed duet with James Morrison, \"Broken Strings\" also topped the charts in Europe in 2008. She released her first Spanish language album, Mi Plan, in 2009, which won her a Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album. In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia inspired fifth album, The Spirit Indestructible. Furtado split with her management and went independent thereafter, releasing her indie-pop sixth album, The Ride in 2017 under her own label Nelstar Entertainment. Furtado has sold over 40 million records worldwide, making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. She has won several awards throughout her career, including one Grammy Award from seven nominations, one Latin Grammy Award, ten Juno Awards, one BRIT Award, one Billboard Music Award, one MTV Europe Music Award, one World Music Award, and three Much Music Video Awards. Furtado has a star on Canada's Walk of Fame and was awarded Commander of the Order of Prince Henry on February 28, 2014, in Toronto by An\u00edbal Cavaco Silva, the former President of Portugal. == Early life == Furtado was born on December 2, 1978, in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. Her Portuguese parents, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Furtado and Maria Manuela Furtado, were born on S\u00e3o Miguel Island in the AzoresNelly Furtado Interview at DailyMusicGuide.com and had immigrated to Canada in the late 1960s. Nelly was named after Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim. Her siblings are Michael Anthony and Lisa Anne. They were raised Roman Catholic. At age four, she began performing and singing in Portuguese. Furtado's first public performance was when she sang a duet with her mother at a church on Portugal Day. She began playing musical instruments at the age of nine, learning the trombone, ukulele and, in later years, the guitar and keyboards. At the age of 12, she began writing songs, and as a teenager, she performed in a Portuguese marching band. Furtado has acknowledged her family as the source of her strong work ethic; she spent eight summers working as a chambermaid with her mother, along with her brother and sister, who was a housekeeper in Victoria. == Career == === 1996\u20131999: Career beginnings === During a visit with her sister Lisa Anne in Toronto in mid-1995, Furtado met Tallis Newkirk, member of the hip hop group Plains of Fascination. She contributed vocals to their 1996 album, Join the Ranks, on the track \"Waitin' 4 the Streets\". After graduating from Mount Douglas Secondary School in 1996, she moved to Toronto to reside with her sister Lisa Anne. The following year, she formed Nelstar, a trip hop duo with Newkirk. Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip hop style of the duo was \"too segregated\", and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability. She left the group and planned to move back home. In 1997, she performed at the Honey Jam talent show. Her performance attracted the attention of The Philosopher Kings singer Gerald Eaton, who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member Brian West helped Furtado produce a demo. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions was shopped to record companies by her attorney Chris Taylor and led to her 1999 record deal with DreamWorks Records, signed by A&R; executive Beth Halper, partner of Garbage drummer and record producer Butch Vig. Furtado's first single, \"Party's Just Begun (Again)\", was released that year on the soundtrack album for Brokedown Palace (1999). === 2000\u20132005: Whoa, Nelly! and Folklore === Furtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, Whoa, Nelly!, which was released in October 2000. The album was an international success, supported by three international singles: \"I'm Like a Bird\", \"Turn Off the Light\", and \"...On the Radio (Remember the Days)\". It received four Grammy nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Furtado's work was also critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. Slant Magazine called the album \"a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium\". The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and \"the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful\". According to Maclean's magazine, Whoa, Nelly! had sold six million copies worldwide as of August 2006.Intini, John. \"Nelly Furtado: 'I'm not Mother Teresa'\" . Maclean's. August 25, 2006. Retrieved September 18, 2006. Portions of the song \"Scared of You\" are in Portuguese, while \"Onde Est\u00e1s\" is entirely in Portuguese, reflecting Furtado's Portuguese heritage. Following the release of the album, Furtado headlined the \"Burn in the Spotlight Tour\" and also appeared on Moby's Area:One tour. In 2002, Furtado appeared on the song \"Thin Line\", on underground hip hop group Jurassic 5's album Power in Numbers. The same year, Furtado provided her vocals to the Paul Oakenfold song \"The Harder They Come\" from the album Bunkka. She also had a collaboration with Colombian artist Juanes in the song \"Fotograf\u00eda\" (\"Photograph\"), where she showed her diversity of yet another language, Spanish. Furtado was also featured in \"Breath\" from Swollen Members' Monsters in the Closet release; the video for \"Breath\", directed by Spawn creator Todd McFarlane, won the 2003 Western Canadian Music Awards Outstanding Video and MuchVIBE Best Rap Video. In 2002, Furtado was the recipient of an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for her song \"I'm Like a Bird\". Furtado's second album, Folklore, was released in November 2003. One of the tracks on the album, \"Childhood Dreams\", was dedicated to her daughter, Nevis. The album includes the single \"For\u00e7a\" (meaning \"strength\"/ \"power\" or \"you can do it!\" in Portuguese), the official anthem of the 2004 European Football Championship. Furtado performed this song in Lisbon at the championship's final, in which Portugal's national team played. The lead single released was \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\" and the second single was the ballad \"Try\". The album was not as successful as her debut, partly due to the album's less \"poppy\" sound, as well as underpromotion from her label DreamWorks Records. DreamWorks had just been sold to Universal Music Group at the time of the album's release. Eventually in 2005, DreamWorks Records, along with many of its artists, including Furtado, were absorbed into Geffen Records. \"Powerless (Say What You Want)\" was later remixed into a Spanish version called \"Abre Tu Coraz\u00f3n\", featuring Juanes, who had previously worked with Furtado on his track \"Fotograf\u00eda\". The two would collaborate again on \"Te Busqu\u00e9\" (\"I Searched for You\"), a single from Furtado's 2006 album Loose. In 2003, Furtado won an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for her song \"Turn Off the Light\". === 2006\u20132008: Loose === Nelly Furtado performing live at Manchester Arena on February 16, 2007 Furtado's third album, named Loose, after the spontaneous, creative decisions she made while creating the album, was released in June 2006. In this album, primarily produced by Timbaland, Furtado experiments with sounds from R&B;, hip hop, and 1980s music. Furtado herself describes the album's sound as punk-hop, described as \"modern, poppy, spooky\" and as having \"a mysterious, after- midnight vibe... extremely visceral\". She attributed the youthful sound of the album to the presence of her two-year-old daughter. The album received generally positive reviews from critics, with some citing the \"revitalising\" effect of Timbaland on Furtado's music, and others calling it \"slick, smart and surprising\". Loose has become the most successful album of Furtado's career so far, as it reached number one, not only in Canada and the United States, but also several countries worldwide. The album produced her first number-one hit in the United States, \"Promiscuous\", as well as her first number-one hit in the United Kingdom, \"Maneater\". The single \"Say It Right\" eventually became Furtado's most successful song worldwide, due to its huge success in Europe and in the United States, where it became her second number- one hit. \"All Good Things (Come to an End)\" became her most successful song in Europe, topping single charts in numerous countries there.
