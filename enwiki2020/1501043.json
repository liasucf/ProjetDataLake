The Society of Saint Anne is a New Orleans Mardi Gras marching krewe that parades each Mardi Gras Day. The Society was founded in 1969. Known for the very elaborate and beautiful costumes of its members, the core group gathers in the Bywater neighborhood of New Orleans each Mardi Gras morning, with the Storyville Stompers brass band providing the music. As they pass through the Faubourg Marigny and French Quarter, additional costumed marchers join the parade at various coffee-shops and bars along the route. The marchers continue to Canal Street to watch the Rex Parade, then return into the French Quarter. ==External links== * Society of Saint Anne Category:Mardi Gras in New Orleans Category:Organizations established in 1969 ",
