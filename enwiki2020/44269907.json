    "text": "The Dominican national identity card (C\u00e9dula de Identidad y Electoral or c\u00e9dula) is a polycarbonate card which contains the holder's name and surnames, city of birth, nationality, sex, date of birth, civil status, occupation, polling station, residential address, and a photograph that adheres to ISO/IEC 19794-5. The card can also optionally include the holder's blood type. Formerly, it included the holder's race (until 2014). Each c\u00e9dula features an 11-digit number that uniquely identifies the holder on a national level. This number is used as a driver's license number as well as a taxpayer identification number. Private companies also use the c\u00e9dula number to uniquely identify their customers. The c\u00e9dula is issued at Central Electoral Board (Spanish: Junta Central Electoral, JCE) offices nationally and at Cedulaci\u00f3n en el Exterior offices internationally. They are issued to all Dominican citizens and legal residents in the country. == History == The Dominican c\u00e9dula was first issued in 1932 as a result of law number 247. All males who were 16 or older were required to hold a c\u00e9dula and pay an annual renewal tax under threat of imprisonment. This early c\u00e9dula was only useful for identification purposes and did not allow its holders to participate in elections. Law 390 made the c\u00e9dula a legal requirement for all adult women with similar punishments for those who did not renew their c\u00e9dula on time. Shortly after the Trujillo dictatorship ended, a new document named the \"Registro Electoral\" was created with the intent of organising those who were eligible to vote. The Registro Electoral in combination with the paper c\u00e9dula continued to be used until 1992, when \u201cla c\u00e9dula azul\u201d replaced it and combined the two into one document. In 1998, the JCE introduced a new c\u00e9dula, replacing the blue c\u00e9dula with an electronically-backed yellow/brown plastic card. On 15 January 2014, the JCE announced the specifications for a new c\u00e9dula that would address many of the security concerns raised over the previous card. The new c\u00e9dula began being issued in April 2014. On 16 December 2014, the JCE announced all old c\u00e9dulas would be revoked on 10 January 2015. Although most governmental organisations ceased accepting the old c\u00e9dula on the JCE's deadline, the Superintendence of Banks instructed banks to continue accepting the old c\u00e9dula in combination with a driver's license or passport until 30 June 2015 for existing customers. As of July 2015, no governmental or private institution in the Dominican Republic accepts the old c\u00e9dula as a valid form of identification. Design of the Dominican national ID card from 1998 to 2013. == Types == Design of a non-voting cedula. Citizens are issued with a yellow c\u00e9dula de identidad y electoral which indicates their polling station on the reverse. Minors, military personnel, police officers, and foreigners are issued a green c\u00e9dula de identidad which identifies their inability to vote on the reverse (\"NO VOTA\") in addition to the reason why they are unable to vote. Changing c\u00e9dula types (for example, a civilian enlisting in the military or a minor becoming an adult) does not change the holder's c\u00e9dula number. == Technical details == The Dominican c\u00e9dula is printed using a Toppan CP-500 printer using thermal transfer printing at 600ppi. The card's static details (such as its design and serial number) are pre-printed onto the card. The card's front features the national flag as guilloch\u00e9 art and Juan Pablo Duarte's face as microprint reading \"Rep\u00fablica Dominicana.\" The card's header is made up of alternating rows of \"R\u00c9PUBLICA DOMINICANA\" and the card's type (either \"C\u00c9DULA DE IDENTIDAD Y ELECTORAL\" or \"C\u00c9DULA DE IDENTIDAD\") printed in microtext. The bottom right corner features an image of the island in optically variable color-changing inks and a semi- transparent version of the cardholder's photo. The card's centre features the Dominican Republic's emblem inside a gulloch\u00e9 printed with invisible ink. The card's top right corner features a hologram of the JCE logo and the Santiago Monumento a los H\u00e9roes de la Restauraci\u00f3n. Finally, microtext of the cardholder's name is printed under the cardholder's signature. The card's reverse includes a QR code encoding a GUID identifying the cardholder's details in the JCE's database. Next to the QR code, a Codabar encodes the cardholder's c\u00e9dula number. A vertical Code128 barcode encodes the card's serial number. The card's serial number's first letter also identifies whether the cardholder is able to vote (N for a non-voting person and V for a voting person). A Machine Readable Zone at the bottom of the card encodes the cardholder's c\u00e9dula number, birthday, sex, card expiration date, nationality, and names. Although the JCE's printers are equipped to program contactless smart cards, the card does not contain any integrated circuits. The c\u00e9dula number is broken up into three pieces: a series number (3 digits), a document number (7 digits), and a Luhn checksum. Series numbers used to represent the municipality where the cardholder was first issued a c\u00e9dula but recent c\u00e9dulas are assigned under the 402 series. == References == Category:Government of the Dominican Republic Dominican Republic ",
