    "text": "Electric Daisy Carnival, commonly known as EDC, is the largest electronic dance music festival in North America. The annual flagship event is now held in May, at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway and Orlando. The event primarily features electronic dance producers and DJs, such as Armin van Buuren, Calvin Harris, Diplo, Alesso, Dillon Francis, Martin Garrix, Zedd, Afrojack, Seven Lions, NGHTMRE, Yellow Claw, and Ti\u00ebsto. The festival incorporates a variety of electronic music, including house, techno, drum and bass, and dubstep. Sponsors of the most recent EDC events include Corona, Smirnoff, Uber and Tinder. EDC was created with the purpose of utilizing music and art to inspire individuals. In addition to the music, individuals experience three- dimensional superstructures, colorful glow-in-the-dark environments, and LED- infused flora and fauna. Part of the experience are the interactive art installations scattered throughout EDC, the various carnival performers that walk around the crowds, and a variety of both thrilling and relaxing carnival rides. The goal is ultimately for EDC to be a place where people can connect, on and off the dance floor. Since its inception, other EDC events have been held in other states and abroad, including Mexico, Puerto Rico, the UK, Brazil, Japan and India. Currently, EDC is held annually in Orlando, China, and Mexico, along with the main Las Vegas event. In 2009, EDC became a two-day event, and in 2011, a three-day event that drew 230,000 people. In 2015, it drew more than 400,000 over three days (134,000 per day). In 2018, EDC Las Vegas expanded the festival to include an on-site camping experience. Recent iterations of the festival have featured eight stages, each with a unique set and specific genre of EDM. 18 carnival rides, four ferris wheels, and a staff of more than 5,000 people make up the event at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In 2019 access to purchasing tickets to EDC was expanded to mobile phone apps for convenience. In 2017, EDC won the Festival of the Year award at the Electronic Music Awards. ==History== The first Electric Daisy Carnival was held in 1991, and was first organized by Stephen Hauptfuhr.
