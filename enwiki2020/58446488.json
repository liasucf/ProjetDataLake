It was for the entire period located at the corner of Amagertorv (No. 33) and Hyskenstr\u00e6de (No. 1) but the current building was built for the pharmacy in 1908. ==History== ===17th century=== L\u00f8ve Apotek was established by Esaias Fleischer on 12 September 1620 and served as pharmacy for the Danish Royal Court from 1633 to 1715. Esaias Fleischer was married twice, last to Maren Hansdatter, a sister of Hans Nansen's wife. He died in January 1663. In 1650 his pharmacy privilege was made heritable, and his son Gregorius Fleischer inherited the pharmacy. He ran it for fifty years, from 1665 to 1715. ===18th century=== Ludvig Manthey The pharmacy was from 1716 to 1742 owned by Andreas Winter. The pharmacy was then acquired by August G\u00fcnter. His son ran it until 1790. It was then endowed to his son-in-law, Ludvig Manthey, who had just passed his pharmaceutical exam. The pharmacy was destroyed in the Copenhagen Fire of 1795. Manthey commissioned Caspar Frederik Harsdorff to designed a new building for the pharmacy and it was already completed the following year. In 1796, he was also appointed as director of the Royal Porcelain Manufactory. In 1800. he was sent abroad by the king to study porcelain manufacturing. Hans Christian \u00d8rsted, his proteg\u00e9, managed his pharmacy while he was away. ===19th century=== Late 19th-century advertisement In 1805, Manthey took over the management of \u00d8rholm and Brede Works. He therefore sold the pharmacy on Amagertorv to Max Boye, who kept it until 1835. His successor, J\u00f8rgen Albert Bech, who owned the pharmacy from 1735 to 1859, was later able to purchase the estates T\u00e5rnborg and Kruusesminde at Kors\u00f8r. The next owner, Harald August Faber, operated the pharmacy until his death in 1873. Niels N\u00f8rgaard Aggersborg was the owner from 1877 to 1889. He was succeeded by Paolo Victor Madvig, who owned it until 1904. ===20th century=== L\u00f8ve Apotek's old building August Kongsted and Anton Antons, who acquired the pharmacy in 1908, founded L\u00f8vens Kemiske Fabrik (now Leo Pharma) the same year. The company acquired a lot in Hyskenstr\u00e6de and constructed a production facility. The new building The photographer Frederik Riise operated a photographic studio in the top floor of the building between 1909 and 1913. The photographic studio was from 1914 to 1928 continued by Julius Folkmann. August Kongsted's son August Julius Helmuth Kongsted took over the pharmacy in 1920. Its production facilities relocated to Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8k in 1926 and Ballerup in 1958, August Julius Helmuth Kongsted died in 1939. The pharmacy was then passed on to his son-in-law, Ludvig Holtmann, who ran it until it closed in 1971. ==Building== The current building at the site was built in 1907-08. It was designed by Victor Nyeb\u00f8llle og Chr. Brandstrup. A lion relief from Harsdorff's building has been installed above the gate. ==Pharmacists== * 12.09.1620 - 13.01.1663 Esais Fleischer * 16.06.1665 - xx.04.1715 Gregorius Fleischer * 23.03.1716 - xx.xx.1742 Andreas Winther * 21.04.1742 - xx.xx.1758 August G\u00fcnther * 13.10.1758 - 13.02.1790 Christopher G\u00fcnther * 05.08.1791 - 30.06.1805 Johan Georg Ludvig Manthey * 17.07.1805 - xx.xx.1835 Marx Boye * 31.07.1835 - 30.04.1859 J\u00f8rgen Albert Bech * 31.05.1859 - xx.12.1873 Harald August Faber * 22.04.1874 - 31.10.1876 Boet efter ovenst\u00e5ende * 12.01.1877 - 31.10.1889 Niels N\u00f8rgaard Aggersborg * 01.09.1889 - 31.12.1904 Paolo Victor Madvig * 01.12.1904 - 01.02.1907 Gustav Rink + * 01.12.1904 - xx.xx.1908 Claus Albert Clausen * 30.05.1908 - 18.12.1917 August Julius Helmuth Kongsted+ \u00d8 30.05.1908 - 11.04.1920 Anton Marius Mathias Christian * Antons * 21.10.1920 - 24.04.1939 August Julius Helmuth Kongsted * 06.11.1939 - 30.04.1971 Carl Ludvig Holtmann ==References== ==External links== * Renderings for Harsdorff's building in the Danish National Art Library * Early Danish pharmaceutical companies Category:Pharmacies in Copenhagen Category:Retail companies established in 1620 Category:1620 establishments in Denmark Category:1971 disestablishments in Denmark Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1908 ",
