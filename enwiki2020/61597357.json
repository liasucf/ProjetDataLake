It is the creek for which Wolf Creek Pass is named. ==Sources== The creek rises just to the west of the Wolf Creek ski area at the Continental Divide near the top of Wolf Creek Pass. From there it flows west, paralleling U.S. Highway 160 for several miles until it passes under the highway on its way to its confluence with the West Fork of the San Juan River near the bottom of the pass.
