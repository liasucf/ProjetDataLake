    "text": "Thorne South railway station is one of two stations serving the ex-mining town of Thorne in South Yorkshire, England. The station is north of Doncaster on the South Humberside Main Line. It is unstaffed, and the only passenger facilities are standard shelters on each platform. The station was more substantial until the mid-1970s, with the westbound platform being an island, a subway linking the platforms and wooden buildings and canopies on each side (the platforms were also located slightly further east than now).\"Memories of Thorne\" History of Thorne website; Retrieved 20 January 2017 There was also a signal box - this was abolished when the line was resignalled in the early 1980s. The other station in the town is Thorne North, which is served by trains towards Hull. ==Facilities== There is no ticketing provision here, so all tickets must be bought on the train or prior to travel. A dedicated, partially-surfaced area has recently been provided adjacent to the north side of the station offering a small amount of free car parking for rail users. Train running information is provided by timetable poster boards and telephone. A fully accessible ramped footbridge links the two platforms - this was opened in July 2013 by Network Rail to replace the old barrow crossing, which had been the scene of several \"near misses\" prior to a passenger being injured by a passing train whilst trying to cross the line in January 2013. The temporary structure erected immediately after the accident was then replaced by the current accessible bridge whilst the line was closed for repairs following the spoil tip collapse at Hatfield Colliery.\"Safety fears lead to new railway bridge\" Doncaster Free Press news article 3 July 2013; Retrieved 20 January 2017 ==Service== From the 20 May 2018 timetable change on Monday to Saturday Thorne South has an hourly Northern service from Doncaster to Scunthorpe only.
