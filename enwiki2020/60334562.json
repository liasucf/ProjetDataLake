    "text": "Octagon Hall, in Simpson County, Kentucky near Franklin, Kentucky, was built in 1862 with eight sides. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. It has also been known as the Andrew Jackson Caldwell House after the man who built the house. There is a second contributing building on the property. Octagon Hall is located northeast of Franklin, Kentucky on U.S. Route 31W. ==Architecture== It is a red brick, two-story octagon house with a high basement. The three front facades have brick laid in Flemish bond, while brickwork is common bond elsewhere. With ==History== In 1847, Andrew Jackson Caldwell laid out the foundation for his new family home he would share with his wife Lizzie and their daughter Mary Elizabeth. Wanting distinction, his home would not be a simple structure like so many others in the area, but an eight-sided edifice. During the Civil War, Octagon Hall served as a hospital for not only Confederate soldiers, but for Federal soldiers, as well. It also doubled as a hideout for Confederate troops on the run from the Union army. Currently, it is the site of the Octagon Hall Museum & Kentucky Confederate Studies Archive. There is a rather extensive library, and a display of Civil War artifacts, Native American artifacts, and genealogical and historical research material. There is a slave cemetery, historic gardens on the grounds, as well as tours of the house.https://www.kentuckytourism.com/octagon-hall- civil-war-museum/ ==Paranormal== The Octagon Hall is known as one of the most haunted places in the South.https://www.octagonhallmuseum.com/ Almost everybody who steps foot inside Octagon Hall has had some sort of paranormal experience; shadow figures, dark entities, and disembodied voices. Even before construction was completed in 1859, Octagon Hall was marred by tragedy. The owner, Andrew Jackson Caldwell's wife, Lizzie, tragically died before they could move into their new home, and she was buried on the grounds. Their daughter, Mary Elizabeth, joined her in the makeshift cemetery when she was 12-years-old when she died in a tragic accident. She died while catching her clothing on fire standing too close to the fireplace while in the 'winter kitchen' located in the basement. Witnesses have reported toys being moved around by an unseen force in Mary Elizabeth's bedroom. Some visitors have felt their hands being grabbed as if it was by a little child, as well as whispers of a little girl's voice saying, \"Mommy\". In the attic, there have been reports by visitors that an unsettled spirit of a Confederate soldier, known as 'Edward', has been seen. Edward's leg was nearly shot off by Union troops. He managed to escape and made his way to Octagon Hall. However, by the time it was safe for him to come out of hiding, it was three days, he had already bled out. People say that they can still hear Edward dragging his leg around inside the house. ==In popular culture== ===Television=== Octagon Hall has been featured on A&E;, Syfy, History Channel, Discovery Channel, and many others. It was also featured as a haunted location on Haunted Live that aired live on the Travel Channel in 2018. ==References== Category:Octagon houses in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Simpson County, Kentucky Category:Houses completed in 1862 Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Kentucky ",
