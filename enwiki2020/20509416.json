    "text": "The Western Canary Islands goldcrest, Regulus regulus ellenthalerae, is a very small passerine bird in the kinglet family. It is restricted to the western Canary Islands of La Palma and El Hierro where it is a non-migratory resident. Previously thought to be the same taxon as the Tenerife Goldcrest Regulus regulus teneriffae, it was separated as a distinct subspecies of the goldcrest which apparently evolved from an independent colonisation of the islands 1.3\u20131.8 million years ago.P\u00e4ckert, Martin; Dietzen, Christian; Martens, Jochen; Wink, Michael & Kvist, Laura: Radiation of Atlantic goldcrests Regulus regulus spp.: evidence of a new taxon from the Canary Islands.
