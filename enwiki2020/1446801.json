    "text": "In population genetics, Ewens's sampling formula, describes the probabilities associated with counts of how many different alleles are observed a given number of times in the sample. ==Definition== Ewens's sampling formula, introduced by Warren Ewens, states that under certain conditions (specified below), if a random sample of n gametes is taken from a population and classified according to the gene at a particular locus then the probability that there are a1 alleles represented once in the sample, and a2 alleles represented twice, and so on, is :\\operatorname{Pr}(a_1,\\dots,a_n; \\theta)={n! \\over \\theta(\\theta+1)\\cdots(\\theta+n-1)}\\prod_{j=1}^n{\\theta^{a_j} \\over j^{a_j} a_j!}, for some positive number \u03b8 representing the population mutation rate, whenever a1, ..., ak is a sequence of nonnegative integers such that :a_1+2a_2+3a_3+\\cdots+ka_k=\\sum_{i=1}^{k} i a_i = n.\\, The phrase \"under certain conditions\" used above is made precise by the following assumptions: * The sample size n is small by comparison to the size of the whole population; and * The population is in statistical equilibrium under mutation and genetic drift and the role of selection at the locus in question is negligible; and * Every mutant allele is novel. This is a probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the integer n. Among probabilists and statisticians it is often called the multivariate Ewens distribution. ==Mathematical properties== When \u03b8 = 0, the probability is 1 that all n genes are the same. When \u03b8 = 1, then the distribution is precisely that of the integer partition induced by a uniformly distributed random permutation. As \u03b8 \u2192 \u221e, the probability that no two of the n genes are the same approaches 1\\. This family of probability distributions enjoys the property that if after the sample of n is taken, m of the n gametes are chosen without replacement, then the resulting probability distribution on the set of all partitions of the smaller integer m is just what the formula above would give if m were put in place of n. The Ewens distribution arises naturally from the Chinese restaurant process. ==See also== * Chinese restaurant table distribution * Coalescent theory * Unified neutral theory of biodiversity * Biomathematics ==Notes== * Warren Ewens, \"The sampling theory of selectively neutral alleles\", Theoretical Population Biology, volume 3, pages 87-112, 1972. * H.
