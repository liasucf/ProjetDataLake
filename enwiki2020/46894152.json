While production of the album was overseen by Roland Spremberg, several musicians contributed to Lieber so, including producers Marcus Brosch and Christian \"Crada\" Kalla as well as rappers Kitty Kat and Sera Finale, Jennifer Rostock keyboarder Joe Walter, and Swiss pop singer Mia Aegerter. Upon its release, Lieber so earned mixed to positive reviews from music critics but became a moderate chart success, debuting and peaking at number 14 on the German Albums Chart. A reissue of the album, released in 2015 to accompany Catterfeld's participation in the second season of the reality television series Sing meinen Song - Das Tauschkonzert, the German version of The Best Singers series, surpassed this peak and has since reached number eight in Germany. Also, Lieber so entered the charts in Austria and Switzerland, where it became her highest-charting effort in a decade. ==Chart performance== Upon its release, Lieber so debuted at number twenty-one on the German Albums Chart.
