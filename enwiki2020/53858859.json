With the Saurashtrian language being the only Indo-Aryan language employing a Dravidian script, the population\u2019s familiarity with the language resulted in the translation of the Tirukkural in this language spoken by a small number of people. Tirukkural Payiram\u2014Pitika Pragaranam by S. S. Ram remains the only known translation of the Kural text into the Saurashtra language. It was posthumously published in 1980 in Madurai. ==Translations== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !style=\"text- align:center; width:25%;\" rowspan=\"2\"|Translation !colspan=\"2\"|Chapter 26, \u0baa\u0bb2 \u0b952\u0ba9\u0bbf\u0b95\u0bcd \u0b86\u0b95\u0bcd\u0bb7\u0bc7\u0baa\u0ba3 |- !Kural 254 (Couplet 26:4) !Kural 258 (Couplet 26:8) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\"|S.
