The object, with a mass roughly 12 times that of Jupiter, is located 324 light years (99.4 parsecs) from Earth orbiting 1.65 astronomical units from its G-type star, HD 38801. HD 38801 b, besides being the only planet in its system also lies within the inner habitable zone and takes around 1.9 years, or 693.5 days to complete a full orbit. Hd 38801 b is characterized by its uniquely low eccentricity values, or having a near circular orbit. As a super massive planet with an orbital period of hundreds of days, this occurrence is quite uncommon. A low eccentricity orbit. ==References== Category:Exoplanets discovered in 2010 Category:Giant planets in the habitable zone ",
