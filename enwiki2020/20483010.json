    "text": "The Pro Caecina is a public speech made by Marcus Tullius Cicero on behalf of his friend Aulus Caecina sometime between 71 BC and 69 BC. The speech was delivered in the third hearing of a lawsuit where Caecina averred that he had been unlawfully dispossessed of a farm by use of force. Known for its refinement and scathing characterisations of the opposing parties, the speech is a good study in how rhetorical advocacy can occlude legal argument. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Roman law Category:Orations of Cicero Category:Speeches ",
