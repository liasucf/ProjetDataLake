    "text": "Yamal 201 (Russian: ) was a geostationary communications satellite operated by Gazkom and built by RSC Energia. It was, along with Yamal 202 the second dual launch of the Yamal program and the second iteration of the USP Bus. It was a satellite with 4,080W of power (3.4 kW at end of life) on an unpressurized bus. It had eight SPT-70 electric thrusters by OKB Fakel for station keeping. Its payload was 9 C band and 6 Ku band transponders supplied by Space Systems Loral. ==History== During 1997, even before the launch of their first satellites (Yamal 101 and Yamal 102), Gazkom was planning the second generation. At that time they planned a 24 satellites of the second generation. This extremely aggressive plan was scaled back by 2001 with a plan to launch four 200 series satellites. The first two, Yamal 201 and Yamal 202 would be launched by 2001 and the second pair, Yamal 203 and Yamal 204 by 2004. Yamal 201 and Yamal 203 would be identical and be positioned at the 90\u00b0E slot and Yamal 202 and Yamal 204 would also be twins and be positioned at the 49\u00b0E slot. Yamal 201 was launched along Yamal 202 November 24, 2003 at 16:2 UTC from Baikonur Site 81/23 by a Proton-K/Blok-DM-2M directly to GEO. The launch and satellite deployment was successful and Yamal 201 was commissioned into service. On June 5, 2014 Yamal 201 failed and the clients had to be moved to other satellites of the network. The satellite lasted 3846 days (10 years 6.5 months), short of the design life of 12.5 years. ==See also== * Yamal 202 \u2013 Satellite that was launched together with. * Yamal \u2013 Communication satellite family operated by Gazprom Space Systems. * Gazprom Space Systems \u2013 Satellite communication division of the Russian oil giant Gazprom. * USP Bus \u2013 The satellite bus on which Yamal 201 is based. * RSC Energia \u2013 The designer and manufacturer of the Yamal 201 satellite. ==References== ==External links== * Gunter Space Page on the Yamal 201/203 Yamal-201 Category:Satellites using the USP bus Category:Spacecraft launched in 2003 Category:2003 in Russia Category:Spacecraft launched by Proton rockets ",
