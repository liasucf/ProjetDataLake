Owned by Harvard Broadcasting, it broadcasts a rhythmic classic hits format focusing on music from the 1990s and 2000s == History == The station was launched on February 4, 1966 by Metropolitan Broadcasting with the call sign CFMQ. It was acquired by Buffalo Broadcasting in 1974 and by Harvard Broadcasting, its current owner, in 1981. In 1994, it flipped to country as Country 92, airing a \"new country\" format to flank sister station CKRM. In 1999, the station flipped to a CHR format as Kiss 92. In 2001, it flipped to soft adult contemporary as Lite 92. On August 3, 2011, CJMX flipped to mainstream adult contemporary as My 92.1. On September 4, 2020, CHMX flipped to a \"rhythmic classic hits\" format as Play 92, featuring a focus on hit music from the 1990s and 2000s. Station management felt that the existing adult contemporary format's growth potential was limited, and that the new format filled a niche not yet covered by existing stations in the market. The success of the Play format at sister station CKPW-FM in Edmonton was also cited as a factor. == References == ==External links== * * HMX HMX HMX Category:Radio stations established in 1966 Category:1996 establishments in Saskatchewan ",
