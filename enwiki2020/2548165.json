He was the son of William d'Aubigny \"Pincerna\" of Old Buckenham Castle in Norfolk, and Maud Bigod, daughter of Roger Bigod of Norfolk. ==Life and career== William fought loyally for King Stephen of England, who made him first Earl of Arundel (more precisely, Earl of Sussex) (c. 1138The Peerage.com) and then Earl of Lincoln. In 1153 he helped arrange the truce between Stephen and Henry Plantagenet, known as the Treaty of Wallingford, which brought an end to The Anarchy. His first known appearance as \"earl\" was at Christmas 1141. When Henry Plantagenet ascended the throne as Henry II, he confirmed William's earldom and gave him direct possession of Arundel Castle (instead of the possession in right of his wife (died 1151) he had previously had). He remained loyal to the king during the 1173 revolt of Henry the Young King, and helped defeat the rebellion. In 1143, as Earl of Lincoln, he made two charters confirming a donation of land around Arundel in Sussex to the abbey of Affligem in Brabant (representing his wife Adeliza of Louvain), with William's brother, Olivier, present. He was the builder of Castle Rising Castle at Castle Rising, Norfolk. William is the first proven English supporter of the crusader Order of St. Lazarus of Jerusalem and before 1146 had granted them land at Wymondham and built a Leper Hospital near his castle in Norfolk. His wife, Adeliza, was also a major benefactor to leper hospitals at Wilton, Wiltshire and Arundel and his cousin, Roger de Mowbray and his family, were to become the most significant patrons of the Order's headquarters at Burton Lazars Hospital. ==Marriage and issue== The younger William was an important member of Henry I of England's household. After Henry's death, William married his widow, Queen Adeliza in 1138. William and Adeliza were parents to the following children: *William d'Aubigny, 2nd Earl of Arundel (died 24 December 1193) *Reynor d'Aubigny *Henry d'Aubigny *Geoffrey d'Aubigny *Alice d'Aubigny (died 11 September 1188) *Olivia d'Aubigny *Agatha d'Aubigny ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:1100s births Category:1176 deaths Category:12th-century English nobility Category:Anglo-Normans Category:Earls of Lincoln *01 Category:Earls of Sussex Category:Peers created by King Stephen ",
