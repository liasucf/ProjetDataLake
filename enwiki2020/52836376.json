    "text": "\"Perfect\" is a song by English singer-songwriter Ed Sheeran from his third studio album, \u00f7 (2017). After the album's release, it charted at number four on the UK Singles Chart. On 21 August 2017, Billboard announced that \"Perfect\" would be the fourth single from the album. The song was serviced to pop radio on 26 September 2017 as the third single from the album in the United States (fourth overall). The song eventually reached number one on the UK Singles Chart and the US Billboard Hot 100 in December 2017. \"Perfect\" became the UK Christmas number-one song for 2017 and also peaked at number one in sixteen other countries, including Australia, Canada, Ireland , and New Zealand. The second version of the single, titled \"Perfect Duet\", with American singer Beyonc\u00e9 was released on 1 December 2017. Another duet with Italian singer Andrea Bocelli, titled \"Perfect Symphony\", was released on 15 December 2017. The song and its official music video received three nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards. ==Composition and production== \"Perfect\" was the first track Sheeran wrote for his third studio album \u00f7. The song was recorded in 2016 and first appeared online in early March 2017. The song is a romantic ballad written about his wife-to-be Cherry Seaborn, whom he knew from school and then reconnected with when she was working in New York. Sheeran revealed that the inspiration for the lyrics came after visiting James Blunt's house in Ibiza, where the two singers had listened to the rapper Future's music at six in the morning. He said: \"Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song, which happened to be Future's \"March Madness\"... I booked the studio for the day, and I had that and I was like, right, let me just flesh that out. And the song happened and was sort of finished that day. I knew it was special.\" In an interview with Zane Lowe, Sheeran said that he needed to write the best love song of his career with \"Perfect\". He said: \"I need to do it 100% me, so everyone will listen to that will be like, \"Ah! He can actually do it!\" ... I wanted to beat \"Thinking Out Loud\", 'cause I know that song was going to define me.\" Sheeran produced the song himself with help from Will Hicks. It was recorded with strings orchestration from his brother Matthew Sheeran. This is the first time the brothers had collaborated on a song as it was the final wish of their grandmother to see the brothers working together before she died. The full string orchestration was later used for the recording with Andrea Bocelli. The song is written in the key of A major (G major in live performances) with a tempo of 63.5 beats per minute in time (if not using triplets) or time (if using triplets). \"Perfect\" moves at a chord progression of A\u2013Fm\u2013D\u2013E. The vocals span from E3 to A4 in the song. ==Commercial performance== In March 2017, Sheeran broke the record set by Frankie Laine in 1953, occupying all of the top five positions in the United Kingdom, and placing nine songs in the top ten of the UK Singles Chart. Also, every single one of the sixteen tracks from his new album \u00f7 entered the top twenty. \"Perfect\" debuted at number four, selling 62,599 copies. After Sheeran's performance of \"Perfect\" on The X Factor on 26 November 2017, the song reached a new peak in the UK, advancing to number three and selling 32,507 units. The Beyonc\u00e9 version, released on 1 December 2017, drove consumption of the track to 89,359 sales (including 45,460 from sales-equivalent streams) as it became Sheeran's second number-one song from \u00f7, following \"Shape of You\" \u2013 and his fourth number-one single in total. With UK sales of 1,048,313, \"Perfect\" became Sheeran's tenth million-selling single. It was the Christmas number-one song for 2017, and held the summit for six consecutive weeks before being displaced by Eminem's \"River\", which features Sheeran as a guest artist. In the United States, ten songs from \u00f7 debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 2017, including \"Perfect\" at number thirty-seven. In October, the song ascended to number eighteen and became the third song from \u00f7 to reach the country's top twenty. It also lifted 4\u20133 on Digital Songs (50,000 downloads sold), 34\u201330 on Radio Songs (45 million) and 46\u201335 on Streaming Songs (11.5 million). On 30 October 2017, \"Perfect\" soared to the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. The ballad gained in all metrics, holding at number three on Digital Song Sales (53,000, up 7 percent) and climbing 30-22 on Radio Songs (53 million, up 16 percent) and 35\u201327 on Streaming Songs (13.1 million, up 14 percent).

Sheeran scored his seventh Radio Songs top ten and the third from his album \u00f7, following \"Shape of You\" and \"Castle on the Hill\". The next week, \"Perfect\" hit top five on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the second-highest- charting hit from his album \u00f7, following \"Shape of You\". \"Perfect\" became Sheeran's third top five hit overall; his first, \"Thinking Out Loud\", rose to number two in 2015. \"Perfect\" remained at number three on Digital Song Sales (60,000, down 6 percent) and powered 10\u20136 on Radio Songs (80 million, up 10 percent) and 38\u201315 on Streaming Songs (18.9 million, up 61 percent).

He previously topped the chart for a week in 2015 with \"Thinking Out Loud\" and for ten weeks earlier in 2017 with \"Shape of You\". \"Perfect\" reached number one on Digital Song Sales, aided by the first few hours of tracking for its duet version, released before the end of the sales (and streaming) tracking week at 7 p.m. ET on 30 November. For the full week, the Beyonc\u00e9 version accounted for 18 percent of the song's sales. On 11 December 2017, after a full tracking week, the single topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart, becoming Sheeran's second number-one song in the United States and Beyonc\u00e9's sixth as a solo act. \"Perfect\" remained at number-one on the Digital Songs chart with sales of 181,000 copies (up 202 percent).

The duet topped the Hot 100 for five weeks. The original version of the song would later take over at the top on the week ending 20 January 2018. After six total weeks at number one, the song was dethroned by \"Havana\" by Camila Cabello featuring Young Thug. \"Perfect\" was the seventh best-selling song of 2017 in the US, with 1,340,000 copies sold that year. It was the best- selling song of 2018, with 1,300,000 copies sold. The original version peaked at number one in Austria, Belgium, France, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Netherlands, Philippines, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland. After the Beyonc\u00e9 duet release, \"Perfect\" also reached number one in Australia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, New Zealand, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The song is Sheeran's fourth to reach number one in Australia, and held the country's top spot for eight consecutive weeks before \"God's Plan\" by Drake displaced it. It went to number one as well in Canada, becoming Sheeran's second number one there and Beyonc\u00e9's first. As of 3 January 2019, the song has sold 207,000 digital copies in Canada. ==Music video== Hintertux Mountains, Austria On 22 September 2017, a lyric video for \"Perfect\" was released on Sheeran's YouTube channel. The music video for \"Perfect\" was released on Sheeran's YouTube channel on 9 November 2017. The video stars Zoey Deutch and was directed by Jason Koenig, who also directed the video for \"Shape of You\". The video was filmed at the Austrian ski resort of Hintertux and shows Sheeran and Deutch going on a ski trip with friends, with the two dancing in the snow and ending up in a cabin together. Ross McNeilage who writes for MTV UK called the video a \"Christmas dream\" for its wintery visual. While praising the simple story and the video's cinematography, McNeilage noted that Zoey Deutch acts opposite to the superstar as his love interest and we watch as they \"coyly flirt until they realise their love for one another and slow dance in the snow together.\" As of August 2020, the music video has received over 2.5 billion views on YouTube, making it the 31st most viewed video on the site. It received nominations for Song of the Year, Best Pop Video and Best Direction at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards. ==Remixes== In November 2017, Sheeran released an acoustic version of \"Perfect\" and two remixes by Mike Perry and Robin Schulz. ==In other media== *\"Perfect\" appeared as one of the prom songs in The Good Doctor's season 3 episode \"Mutations.\" *\"Perfect\" was one of the wedding songs of Ian Gallagher and Mickey Milkovich in the Shameless season 10 finale \"Gallavich!\" ==Formats and track listings== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" !
