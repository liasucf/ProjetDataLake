Lenus (; E. Courtney (1995) reads the original dative form as in Musa Lapidaria: A Selection of Latin Verses 160, p. 152.) was a Celtic healing god worshipped mainly in eastern Gaul, where he was almost always identified with the Roman god Mars. He was an important god of the Treveri tribe, who had large sanctuaries at medicinal springs at Trier and the Martberg by Pommern in what is now Germany. Two dedications to him are also known from southwestern Britain (Chedworth and Caerwent). Edith Wightman characterizes him as \u201cone of the best examples of a Teutates, or god of the people, equated with Mars\u2014protector of the tribe in battle, but also [...] bestower of health and general good fortune\u201d (p. 211).Edith Mary Wightman (1970). Roman Trier and the Treveri. Rupert Hart-Davis, London. His sanctuary \u2018Am Irminenwingert\u2019 at Trier had a large temple, baths, smaller shrines and a theatre; that on the Martberg also included a large variety of buildings, probably including rooms for health-seeking pilgrims to stay. Despite his associations with healing, Lenus Mars is depicted classically as a warrior with Corinthian helmet in a bronze statuette from the Martberg. His name most often appears in inscriptions as \u2018Lenus Mars\u2019, rather than \u2018Mars Lenus\u2019 as would be expected from other most syncretized names. At Trier, Lenus Mars's divine partners were the Celtic goddess Ancamna and the Roman Victoria,L'Arbre Celtique as well as the Xulsigiae, who are perhaps water nymphs. An inscription from Kaul in Luxembourg appears to invoke Lenus Mars \u2018Veraudunus\u2019 along with the Celtic goddess Inciona.Mus\u00e9e d'histoire et d'art, Luxembourg. 1974.

Lenus was not the only Celtic god identified with Mars by the Treveri; others, such as Iovantucarus (apparently a protector of youth), Intarabus, Camulos, and Loucetios were identified with Mars and perhaps, by extension, with Lenus. His name occasionally appears as \u2018Mars Laenus\u2019;Nicole Jufer & Thierry Luginb\u00fchl (2001).

Paris: Editions Errance. . the more usual form \u2018Lenus Mars\u2019 is accompanied by the epithets Arterancus and Exsobinus on one inscription each. In Britain, Mars Lenus may have been identified with Ocelus Vellaunus, on the evidence of this inscription on the base of a statue:B. Collingwood and R.P. Wright. The Roman Inscriptions of Britain.
