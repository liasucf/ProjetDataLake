It is the largest part of the wider Pannonian Plain. Its territory signifficantly shrinked and its boundary was rewritten by the new political borders of post WW1 era, after the Treaty of Trianon in 1920. == Boundaries == Hydrography of the Pannonian basin before the river and lake regulations in the 19th century. Wells in the Hortob\u00e1gy National Park Puszta, with a stable Its boundaries are the Carpathians in the north and east, the Transdanubian Mountains and the Dinaric Alps in the southwest, and approximately the Sava river in the south. == Geography == === Plain in Hungary === The territory of the GHP in Hungary. Its territory covers approximately of Hungary, approximately 56% of its total area of . The highest point of the plain is Hoporty\u00f3 (); the lowest point is the Tisza River. The terrain ranges from flat to rolling plains. The most important Hungarian writers inspired by and associated with the plain are Ferenc M\u00f3ra and Zsigmond M\u00f3ricz, as well as the poets S\u00e1ndor Pet\u0151fi and Gyula Juh\u00e1sz. Hungarian scientists born on the plain include Zolt\u00e1n Bay, physicist; J\u00e1nos Irinyi, chemist, inventor of the noiseless match; J\u00e1nos Kabay, pharmacologist; G\u00e1bor K\u00e1tai, physician and pharmacist; and Frigyes Kor\u00e1nyi, physician and pulmonologist. The most important river of the plain is Tisza. The notable cities and towns with medicinal baths are Debrecen, Berekf\u00fcrd\u0151, Cserkesz\u0151l\u0151, Gyula, Hajd\u00faszoboszl\u00f3, Szentes and Szolnok.

The portion of the Pannonian plain in Serbia is mostly divided into 3 large geographical areas: Ba\u010dka, Banat and Srem (Syrmia), most of which are located in the Vojvodina province. === Plain in Croatia === The term is rarely used in Croatia, and is usually associated there with the geography of Hungary. Parts of Pannonian Croatia can be considered an extension of Alf\u00f6ld, particularly eastern Slavonia and the connected parts of Syrmia. === Plain in Slovakia === The portion of the plain located in Slovakia is known as the Eastern Slovak Lowland. === Plain in Ukraine === The part of the plain located in Ukraine is known as the Transcarpathian Lowland. === Plain in Romania === In Romania, the plain (Rom. c\u00e2mp or c\u00e2mpia, from Lat. campus) includes the regions of Banat and Cri\u015fana. It is referred to in Romanian as The Western Plain (C\u00e2mpia de Vest). == Prehistoric culture == During the prehistoric era, the Great Hungarian Plain was a place of cultural and technological changes, as well as an important meeting point of cultures of Eastern and Western Europe. It is a region of great archaeological importance to major European cultural transitions. Agriculture began in the Great Hungarian Plain with the Early Neolithic K\u00f6r\u00f6s culture, located in present-day Serbia, 6.000-5.500 B.C.E. followed 5.500 B.C.E. by the Linear Pottery culture(LBK) which later became the dominant agricultural culture of Europe. The LBK was followed by the Lengyel culture in the Late Neolithic 5000-3400 BC. During the Early Bronze Age (2.800 - 1.800 BC), the growing demand for metal ores in Europe resulted in the new pan- European and intercontinental trade networks. During that period cultures of the Great Hungarian Plain incorporated many elements from the other cultures of Bronze Age Near Eastern, Steppe and Central Europe During the early Iron Age (first millennium BC), a variant of the Central European Hallstatt culture inhabited Transdanubia, while pre-Scythian and later Scythian cultures were found in the eastern region of the Great Hungarian Plain. == Genomic analysis of prehistoric populations == In 2014, a major study of DNA from burials in the Great Hungarian Plain was published. The 5,000-year record indicated significant genomic shifts at the beginning of the Neolithic, Bronze and Iron Ages, with periods of stability in between. The earliest Neolithic genome was similar to other European hunter-gatherers and surprisingly there was no evidence of lactase persistence at that period. The most recent samples, from the Iron Age, showed an eastern genomic influence contemporary with introduced Steppe burial rites. There was also a transition towards lighter pigmentation. == See also == *Eurasian Steppe *Little Hungarian Plain *Pannonian Basin *Puszta *Steppe Route *Vienna Basin ==References== == External links == * *K\u00f6r\u00f6s Regional Archaeological Project: Neolithic and Copper Age archaeology in the Great Hungarian Plain Category:Eurasian Steppe Category:Historical regions in Hungary Category:Historical regions in the Kingdom of Hungary Category:Geography of Vojvodina Category:Plains of Croatia Category:Plains of Hungary Category:Plains of Romania Category:Plains of Serbia Category:Plains of Slovakia Category:Plains of Ukraine Category:Pannonian Plain ",
