    "text": "Infrared images from instruments at Kitt Peak National Observatory (left) and NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope document the outburst of HOPS 383, a young protostar in the Orion star-formation complex. The background is a wide view of the region taken from a Spitzer four-color infrared mosaic. HOPS 383 is a Class 0 protostar. It is the first class-0 protostar discovered to have had an outburst, and as of 2015, the youngest protostar known to have had an outburst. The protostar was discovered by the Herschel Orion Protostar Survey (HOPS) team. ==References== ==Further reading== * \"HOPS 383: An Outbursting Class 0 Protostar in Orion\"; Emily J.
