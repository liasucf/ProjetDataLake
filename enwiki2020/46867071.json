    "text": "Eldgarns\u00f6 Nature Reserve () is a nature reserve in Stockholm County in Sweden. Eldgarns\u00f6 Nature Reserve consists of Eldgarns\u00f6 island in Lake M\u00e4laren. A trail runs around the island. The nature reserve consists of on the one hand an area of broad-leaf forest, and on the other of an area which is more mixed, containing arable land, coniferous forest and beach meadows with shallow water overgrown with reeds. ==Flora== The broad-leaf forest is dominated by oak, European ash and wych elm. Mistletoe grows among the trees; this parasite is uncommon in Sweden (and hence a protected species) due to the cool climate, but survives in local areas of warmer micro-climate such as Eldgarns\u00f6 island. In the open meadows, solitary oak trees rise above stands of unspotted lungwort, Cardamine bulbifera, spring vetchling and black pea. ==Fauna== The island has a rich bird-life. Species include the European honey buzzard, Eurasian wryneck and ortolan bunting. The nature reserve also supports a rich variety of insects. ==References== Category:Nature reserves in Sweden Category:Geography of Stockholm County Category:Protected areas established in 1979 Category:1979 establishments in Sweden Category:Tourist attractions in Stockholm County ",
