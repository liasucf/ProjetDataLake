Born in Glasgow, he attended Glasgow University and is a qualified vet. He started training at a stable near Louth, Lincolnshire in 1987, and his first winner was Hinari Video at Carlisle. He has been training in Middleham since 1988 when he purchased Kingsley House (often falsely attributed to be the former home of Charles Kingsley, author of The Water Babies). In 2004 he won the 1,000 Guineas with Attraction. Other successful horses he has trained are Mister Baileys, winner of the 2,000 Guineas, Shamardal, 2004 European Champion Two-Year-Old, and Double Trigger, winner of the Ascot Gold Cup. Johnston's horses are known for their front running style and bravery in a finish, two attributes that were best advertised by the exploits of Attraction. He cites Shamardal as the best horse he ever trained, and Attraction as the one he is most proud of. He reached his 4,000th winner on the flat in Britain when Dominating won at Pontefract on Monday 23 October 2017. He is only the third trainer in either code to reach that figure. On 23 August 2018 Mark Johnson became the most successful British Flat Trainer of all time when Frankie Dettori rode Poet's Society to win the 3.00 at York at odds of 20-1 to give Mark his 4,194 winner. The motto of the stable is \"Always Trying\". He is married to Deirdre, a former teacher. ==Major wins== Great Britain * 1,000 Guineas - (1) - Attraction (2004) * 2,000 Guineas - (1) - Mister Baileys (1994) * Ascot Gold Cup - (3) - Double Trigger (1995), Royal Rebel (2001, 2002) * Cheveley Park Stakes - (1) - Lumiere (2015) * Coronation Stakes - (1) - Attraction (2004) * Dewhurst Stakes - (1) - Shamardal (2004) * Falmouth Stakes - (1) - Nahoodh (2008) * Middle Park Stakes - (2) - Awzaan (2009), The Last Lion (2016) * St. James's Palace Stakes - (1) - Bijou d'Inde (1996) * Sun Chariot Stakes - (1) - Attraction (2004) \\---- Germany * Bayerisches Zuchtrennen - (1) - Lady Jane Digby (2010) * Preis von Europa - (1) - Jukebox Jury (2009) * Rheinland-Pokal - (1) - Yavana's Pace (2002) \\---- Ireland * Irish 1,000 Guineas - (1) - Attraction (2004) * Irish St. Leger - (1) - Jukebox Jury (dead heat 2011) * Matron Stakes - (1) - Attraction (2005) * Phoenix Stakes - (1) - Princely Heir (1997) \\---- Italy * Gran Criterium - (3) - Lend a Hand (1997), Pearl of Love (2003), Kirklees (2006) \\---- United Arab Emirates * Dubai Sheema Classic - (1) - Fruits of Love (1999) ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:British horse trainers ",
