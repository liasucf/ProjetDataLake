    "text": "Matthew Derrick Williams (born November 28, 1965), nicknamed \"Matt the Bat\" and \"The Big Marine\" is an American professional baseball manager and former third baseman who is the manager for the Kia Tigers of the KBO League.Rubin, Shayna. \"Why Matt Williams left the A\u2019s to manage a team in Korea: Former San Francisco Giants star and A\u2019s coach is managing the Kia Tigers of the Korean Baseball Organization,\" The Mercury News (May 11, 2020). A right-handed batter, Williams played in Major League Baseball for the San Francisco Giants, Cleveland Indians, and Arizona Diamondbacks. He managed the Washington Nationals from 2014 to 2015. Williams played in a World Series for each of these teams ( with the Giants, with the Indians, and with the Diamondbacks in which he won over the New York Yankees). During these years, Williams became the only player to hit at least one World Series home run for three different Major League baseball teams.Washington Nationals, MLB.com Matt Williams #9 Page Accessed March 11, 2013 During his career, Williams had an overall batting average of .268, with 378 home runs and 1218 runs batted in (RBIs). He scored 997 Major League runs, and he accumulated 1878 hits, 338 doubles, and 35 triples, while playing in 1866 regular-season games. As of August, 2015 - 13 years after his final game - he still ranks in the top 75 all-time players for career home runs and the top 150 all-time players for career RBIs. ==Early life== Williams originally was selected by the New York Mets from Carson High School in Carson City, Nevada, but he did not sign with the Mets. Williams was the starting quarterback on the Carson Senators football team in high school. Two of his teammates who played baseball in high school, Bob Ayrault and Charlie Kerfeld, also played baseball in the major leagues. ==San Francisco Giants== Williams accepted a baseball scholarship to play for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and after attending college and playing baseball there, Williams was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the first round (the 3rd pick) of the 1986 pro baseball draft. Williams began his major league career in 1987 primarily as a shortstop for the Giants while playing some games at third base also. He played both shortstop and third base until the 1990 season when he became the starting third baseman for the Giants and went on to lead the National League in Runs Batted In with 122 while making the National League All Star team. Despite suffering from several leg injuries and some lower-back ailments, Williams was an excellent fielder at third base, and a dangerous and productive hitter. As a third baseman, Williams had good reflexes and excellent hands, with a quick release and strong, accurate arm. During his career, he earned four Gold Glove Awards, all between 1991 and 1997. A hitter with exceptional power, six times he hit more than 30 home runs in a season as a Giant, with more than 90 runs batted in. His best season was 1994 when he hit a National League-best 43 home runs and had an impressive 96 runs batted in (RBI) in only 110 games as the Major League Baseball season was shortened by nearly one-third because of a season-ending strike by Major League baseball players. He was on pace to challenge the single season home run record of 61, at the time held by Roger Maris, with his 43 home runs in 115 games projecting to 60.6 home runs at season's end. Williams finished second in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award that year behind first baseman Jeff Bagwell of the Houston Astros. ==Arizona Diamondbacks== Williams (left) as third base coach with the Diamondbacks in 2011 Williams was an original member of the Arizona Diamondbacks from the club's inaugural season in 1998. He holds the Diamondbacks record for the most RBIs in one season with a total of 142 during 1999; the record has since been tied by Luis Gonzalez in 2001, but has never been exceeded. Williams was a partial owner of the Diamondbacks, and carried the title of \"Special Assistant to the General Partner\".
