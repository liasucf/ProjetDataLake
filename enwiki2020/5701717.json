In his art Danielsen distils the essence of the landscape in an original way. B\u00e1r\u00f0ur J\u00e1kupsson in his book F\u00e6r\u00f8ernes billedkunst (F\u00e4r\u00f6i screen end art) compares Danielsen with the classical author S\u00e1mal Mikines, who lived on a similarly small, remote and inaccessible Faroe Island: Mykines. Both islands have important bird colonies and both islands have only one village. Danielsen spent most of his 24 productive years on N\u00f3lsoy, with just one period abroad in Denmark between 1951 and 1956. His first exhibition in 1952 in \u00d3lavs\u00f8ka brought him to the attention of the Faroese art community. Danielsen's paintings describe his homeland island in everyday detail, capturing not only the landscapes, boats, buildings but also the atmosphere and spirit of the place. He captures the light, with sun and rain, snow and fog, and the predominantly red tones allude sensitively to the colour nuances of the Faroese landscape. ==Gallery== His paintings of N\u00f3lsoy were featured on a series of Faroese stamps in 1990: Image:Faroe stamp 201 steffan danielsen - nolsoy.jpg|FR 201 Image:Faroe stamp 202 steffan danielsen - nolsoy.jpg|FR 202 Image:Faroe stamp 203 steffan danielsen - nolsoy.jpg|FR 203 Image:Faroe stamp 204 steffan danielsen - nolsoy.jpg|FR 204 and also in this stamp of 1985: Image:Faroe stamp 114 steffan danielsen.jpg|Stamp FR 114: Winter day, N\u00f3lsoy 1959, 65x87cm, Listasavn F\u00f8roya (The Faroe Islands Art Museum) ==Sources== * text translated from :de:Steffan Danielsen ==See also== * Art of the Faroe Islands ==External links== * Art.fo - art museum of the Faroes * Faroeartstamps.fo - art on Faroese stamps Category:1922 births Category:1976 deaths Category:20th-century Faroese painters ",
