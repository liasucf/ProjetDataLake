Tax credits are a form of UK social welfare benefit paid out to parents and workers on low incomes. In 2016, Concentrix was receiving heavy criticism from the cross-party parliamentary committee on welfare for incorrectly closing the claims of tens of thousands of claimants, leaving them without money for essentials. A government report disclosed that of 36,000 appeals against Concentrix, 87% were upheld. In September 2016, the HMRC announced that it would not renew the contract, due to expire in 2017, although the Treasury has resisted calls for a full inquiry thus far. As a result of Concentrix's failings, thousands of claimants are also due to receive back-payments for incorrectly stopped claims. Processing the resultant case reviews cost HMRC \u00a343 million.Centrelink contractor Concentrix wrongly cut thousands off welfare in the UK ABC News, 6 December 2018.
