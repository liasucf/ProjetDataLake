Originally a Guanche settlement, before the Spanish conquest in 1496. (There is no truth to the popular myth, that the village was once home to pirates). The village is now home to around 90 inhabitants. The village lies at an altitude of 650 m in the Macizo de Teno mountains, which extend up to the northwesternmost point of Tenerife. Forests including cypresses and palm trees abound. The village lies at the head of the Masca Gorge. The trail from the village down the gorge to the beach on the Atlantic Ocean is a popular, though strenuous, hiking route, which takes about 3 hours each way. == References == ==External links== Category:Populated places in Tenerife ",
