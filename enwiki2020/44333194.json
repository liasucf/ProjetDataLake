Gelber gave Goldberg and Costikyan his notes for the game and they turned those ideas into a complete manuscript. Gelber, Costikyan , and Goldberg licensed Paranoia to West End Games, and Ken Rolston helped rewrite the rules before it was published in 1984. Gelber also designed (with Jeffrey Simons and Evan Jones) The Marvel Universe Roleplaying Game. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:Role-playing game designers Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
