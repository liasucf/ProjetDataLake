    "text": "Shape Shift with Me is the seventh studio album by American punk rock band Against Me!, released on September 16, 2016 on Total Treble Music and Xtra Mile. The title is a lyric from the song \"Norse Truth\", which appears as track 10. Shape Shift with Me features a shift in vocal style on many of its songs, with Grace hailed for a more spoken word-like structure in her singing on songs such as \"12:03\", \"333\" and \"Norse Truth\". No non-promotional singles have been released from the album. However, both of the b-sides recorded for the album, as identified from the band's publishing catalogue, \"Stabitha Christie\" and \"First High of the Morning\", were released on a 7\" single to mark Record Store Day 2017. ==Accolades== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" |- !
