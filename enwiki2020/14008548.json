    "text": "The Summerleaze Footbridge is a footbridge across the River Thames in England linking Dorney, Buckinghamshire and Bray, Berkshire; it is about two miles downstream of Maidenhead Bridge, on the reach above Boveney Lock. The footbridge was built as a gravel conveyor belt, taking gravel from the construction of Dorney Lake, a nearby purpose-built rowing lake, and takes its name \"Summerleaze\" from the firm who built it in 1996. ==See also== *Crossings of the River Thames ==References== Category:1996 establishments in England Category:Bray, Berkshire Category:Bridges in Berkshire Category:Bridges in Buckinghamshire Category:Bridges completed in 1996 Category:Pedestrian bridges across the River Thames Category:South Bucks District ",
