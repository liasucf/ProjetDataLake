His best year in the majors was 1999, when he won 21 games for the Astros and pitched in his only All-Star Game. A flamboyant free spirit, he was best known for coining all his pitching appearances as Lima Time. His remarkably animated displays of emotion on the mound made him a fan favorite, but also drew the ire of opposing teams. He was known for his flamboyant celebrations after his victories in the face of opponents.Stephens, Bailey \"Former big leaguer Lima dead at 37.\" www.mlb.com, May 23, 2010. Retrieved December 5, 2016. Due to his indulging in musical pursuits beyond baseball, he was once described by The New York Times sportswriter Ben Shpigel as \"the national anthem-crooning, towel-waving merengue singer who moonlights as a right-handed pitcher\".\"Lima dies from heart attack at 37,\" The Associated Press, Sunday, May 23, 2010.Sphigel, Ben. \"BASEBALL; Lima's Shot With Mets No Laughing Matter,\" The New York Times, Friday, February 17, 2006. == MLB career == Lima made his Major League debut with the Detroit Tigers on April 20, 1994, at age 21 making a start against the Kansas City Royals. After three years in Detroit, he was traded to the Houston Astros on December 10, 1996, in an eight-player trade. In he compiled a record of 21\u201310 and was named to the National League All Star Team that season. However, after the 1999 season, Lima struggled to recapture his success and surrendered a league-leading 48 home runs, which was only two short of the single season record held by Bert Blyleven, and lost 16 games. On June 23, 2001, Lima was traded back to Detroit in exchange for Dave Mlicki. He was released by Detroit during the season, proclaiming at the time, \"If I can't pitch on this team\u2014the worst or second- worst team in baseball\u2014where am I going to pitch? If I can't start on this ballclub, I must be the worst pitcher on Earth.\" He pitched for the Newark Bears in the Independent Atlantic League early in 2003, but returned to MLB in June 2003, when he was acquired by the Kansas City Royals. Lima started off fast in Kansas City, he was 7\u20130 with a 2.17 ERA after eight starts. But a groin injury during his ninth start caused his performance to decline significantly and he went 1\u20133 with a 10.65 ERA in his last six starts. He joined the Los Angeles Dodgers in . With the Dodgers, Lima was 13\u20135 with a 4.07 ERA, his best performance since the 1999 season. Possibly the best moment of his career came on October 9, 2004, in Game Three of the 2004 National League Division Series, when he pitched a 5-hit shutout against the St. Louis Cardinals. It was the Dodgers' first post-season victory since Game Five of the 1988 World Series.

On July 4, 2006, he was again called up again to the Mets, when Heath Bell was optioned back to the Norfolk Tides. Lima had another poor outing on July 7, 2006, against the Florida Marlins which included surrendering up a grand slam to opposing pitcher Dontrelle Willis and was removed from the game. After the game Lima was designated for assignment back to the Norfolk Tides for the second time during the 2006 season. Lima finished the 2006 season with a 0\u20134 record with a 9.87 ERA in four total starts for the Mets. In the Dominican Winter Baseball League, he played for the \u00c1guilas Cibae\u00f1as. In , Lima also played for Saraperos de Saltillo in the Mexican League. == Korea Professional Baseball == For the 2008 season, Lima signed with the Kia Tigers, a nine-time champion in the Korea Professional Baseball. Despite high expectations as a former Major League Baseball pitcher, Lima struggled in several starts. After that, he was sent down to the Korea Baseball Futures League, and media reported that Lima would be released from the Tigers. However, after returning to the Tigers, Lima got two consecutive wins against the Woori Heroes by pitching seven innings while not allowing a single run, and the Hanwha Eagles, pitching five innings and allowing just three runs, but was still released by the Tigers. == Golden Baseball League == Lima signed with the Long Beach Armada of the independent Golden Baseball League (GBL) on March 27, 2009.

He pitched a total of four games for the Capitals, going 1-2 in the regular season and losing his only GBL playoff appearance.O'Leary, Chris & Sumamo, Yonathan. \"One-time Edmonton Capitals pitcher Jos\u00e9 Lima dead at 37,\" Edmonton Journal, Sunday, May 23, 2010. == Personal life == Lima made statements in his native Dominican Republic that he would possibly pursue a career as a singer after his baseball career was over; specifically in the genre of bachata.
