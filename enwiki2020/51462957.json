He was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science in 2016 in recognition of his work in understanding the role of \"sea ice and Antarctica in the global climate system\". == Career and impact == Allison received his MSc and PhD both in Meteorology from the University of Melbourne in 1970 and 1987 respectively. He worked at the Australian Antarctic Division for 42 years. His research focuses on the global climate system and in particular the role of Antarctica in the world's climate. His research spans disciplines including ice shelf-ocean interaction, meteorology, glaciology and oceanography. Allison led or participated in 25 expeditions to Antarctica, and during this time he conducted foundational research on Antarctic sea ice. His research documented the seasonal change in sea ice driven by its interaction with the water column and the atmosphere. Allison was a lead author of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Second, Fourth and Fifth Assessment Reports.

He was awarded Tasmanian Senior Australian of the Year in 2016. Allison Glacier on the west side of Heard Island is named in his honour. == References == Category:Australian climatologists Category:Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change lead authors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Officers of the Order of Australia ",
