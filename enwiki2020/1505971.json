    "text": "It Takes a Thief is an American action-adventure television series that aired on ABC for three seasons between 1968 and 1970. It stars Robert Wagner in his television debut as sophisticated thief Alexander Mundy, who works for the U.S. government in return for his release from prison. For most of the series, Malachi Throne played Noah Bain, Mundy's boss. It was among the last of the series in the 1960s spy television genre, although Mission: Impossible continued for several more years. It Takes a Thief was inspired by, though not based upon, the 1955 motion picture To Catch a Thief, directed by Alfred Hitchcock; both of their titles stem from the English proverb \"Set a thief to catch a thief\" (or as it is more often phrased, \"It takes a thief to catch a thief\"). ==Premise== Malachi Throne with Robert Wagner in It Takes a Thief, 1968 Fred Astaire and Robert Wagner, 1969 It Takes a Thief, which was created by television writer Roland Kibbee, featured the adventures of cat burglar, pickpocket, and thief Alexander Mundy, who steals to finance his life as a polished playboy and sophisticate. He is in prison when the U.S. government's SIA (the fictional Secret Intelligence Agency) proposes a deal to Mundy: steal for the government in exchange for his freedom. Mundy is puzzled and asks, \"Let me get this straight. You want me to steal?\" In the main opening titles, his new SIA boss, Noah Bain, uses the catch phrase, \"Oh, look, Al, I'm not asking you to spy. I'm just asking you to steal.\" In pre-production, the title for a while was Once a Crook. The series opened with its pilot episode, a ninety-minute (with commercials) special premiere titled \"A Thief is a Thief is a Thief\", written by Kibbee and directed by Leslie Stevens. When the series was released in syndication in the 1970s, the pilot episode was withheld from the package and was expanded into a 99-minute feature film for overseas release; this was eventually released in a separate domestic syndication package, under the title Magnificent Thief. The pilot feature film version was released on home video in the 1990s. In the series' third season, Throne was replaced by Edward Binns as Mundy's SIA boss, Wallie Powers. As Throne explained: \"They had this idea of shooting the whole season in Italy, but they wanted me to stay behind and give Wagner\u2019s character...orders over the phone. I told them if I didn't go I'd quit, and I did. The show didn't last another half a season.\" Throne's version of events was incorrect, as the third season was not shortened. In the end, portions of season three were filmed in Europe and Binns, Throne's replacement, filmed some scenes there. Also during the third season, Fred Astaire played Alistair Mundy, Alexander's father, in five episodes. Alistair is also a master gentleman-thief, who says bemusedly, at the start of each episode in which he appears, \"I've heard of stealing from the government, but for the government?\" Alistair was the lead character in most episodes in which he appeared, rather than Wagner's character of Alexander, who was relegated to supporting or even cameo roles in these episodes. This is somewhat reminiscent of the way the 1950s TV series Maverick would introduce a relative of the previously established main character, and then alternate the two characters the leading series role from week to week. Susan Saint James appeared in five episodes. Charlene Holt appeared in three episodes. Other guest stars included prominent veteran Hollywood movie stars such as Bette Davis, Joseph Cotten, Hermione Gingold, Paul Henreid, Fernando Lamas, and Ida Lupino. ==Cast== Source: * Fred Astaire - Alistair Mundy * Edward Binns - Wallie Powers * Malachi Throne - Noah Bain * Robert Wagner - Alexander Mundy ==Episodes== ==Home media== On November 15, 2011, Entertainment One released It Takes a Thief: The Complete Series on DVD in Region 1.
