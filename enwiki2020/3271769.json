    "text": "The Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 is an Act of the Parliament of Australia which followed the New South Wales Seat of Government Surrender Act 1915. The Act created the Territory of Jervis Bay, subject to the laws of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT). While the Act's use of the language of \"annexed\" is sometimes interpreted as implying that the Jervis Bay Territory was to form part of the Federal Capital Territory, the accepted legal position is that it has been a legally distinct territory from its creation, despite being subject to FCT/ACT law and (prior to ACT self-government in 1988) being administratively treated as part of the FCT/ACT. ==See also== *History of the Australian Capital Territory *Territorial evolution of Australia ==References== ==Further reading== *National Archives of Australia - Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 *Jervis Bay Territory Acceptance Act 1915 (NO. 19, 1915) (as passed) *JERVIS BAY TERRITORY ACCEPTANCE ACT 1915 (consolidated version, incorporating subsequent amendments) Category:Acts of the Parliament of Australia Category:History of the Australian Capital Territory Category:1915 in Australian law Category:Jervis Bay Territory Category:20th century in the Australian Capital Territory ",
