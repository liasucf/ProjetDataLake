    "text": "Portrait of Sion Gheorghe Sion (May 22, 1822 \u2013 October 1, 1892) was a Moldavian, later Romanian poet, playwright, translator and memoirist. He was born in Mamorni\u021ba to paharnic (royal cup-bearer) Ioni\u021b\u0103 Sion and his wife Eufrosina (n\u00e9e Schina), the daughter of Filiki Eteria member Gheorghe Schina. His uncles included Constantin Sion, author of a semi-fictitious noble genealogy (Arhondologia Moldovei); and sp\u0103tar Antohi Sion, the rumored author of Izvodul lui Cl\u0103n\u0103u, an outright forgery. After spending two years (1837-1839) at Saint Sava College in Bucharest, the capital of Wallachia, he returned to his native Moldavia. Entering the Ia\u0219i-based provincial administration, he became a copyist at the Justice Department in 1842, followed by work as a clerk at the Interior Department. He became a wanted man for his participation in the 1848 revolution, and so fled to Austrian-ruled Transylvania. He returned to Ia\u0219i in 1849, working as bureau chief at the Department of Church Property and Public Education. From 1855, he worked at the State Archives. Subsequently, around the time of the Union of the Principalities, Sion moved to Bucharest, where his posts included membership in the Appeals Court and, from 1866, head of the Tobacco Monopoly Company. In 1868, he was elected a titular member of the Romanian Academy.
