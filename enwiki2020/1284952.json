The municipal area stretches along the southeastern rim of the Harz National Park from an elevation of up to at the Wurmberg summit. Other peaks in the vicinity include the Achtermannsh\u00f6he and the Hahnenklee Crags. ===Districts=== The town consists of three districts: * Braunlage proper * Hohegei\u00df*, incorporated on 1 July 1972 * Sankt Andreasberg**, incorporated on 1 November 2011 * with the village of K\u00f6nigskrug ** with the villages of Sonnenberg, Oderhaus, Oderbr\u00fcck, Oderberg, Odertaler S\u00e4gem\u00fchle and Silberh\u00fctte ===Transportation=== Braunlage is situated at the Bundesstra\u00dfe B4 running from Braunschweig to Nordhausen and B27 from Blankenburg to G\u00f6ttingen. Local buses provide service between Braunlage and the nearby communities of Bad Harzburg, Sankt Andreasberg, Schierke, Wernigerode, Hohegei\u00df, Bad Sachsa, Nordhausen, Bad Lauterberg, Herzberg, and Clausthal-Zellerfeld. Braunlage used to be served by the South Harz Railway Company, providing a link to the Harz Narrow Gauge Railways via Sorge, but service was cut in 1958. == Climate == == History == Braunlage ironworks, 1654 engraving by Matth\u00e4us Merian First mentioned as Brunla in 1227, the town started out as a pit settlement in the Harz forests. It appeared as Brunenlo in a 1253 register of the Saxon counts of Regenstein and was revived, when their successors, the Counts of Blankenburg, established an ironworks here in 1561. With the extinction of the Blankenburg dynasty in 1599, Braunlage fell to the Dukes of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel. In the 17th century it was a small Brunswick market town located in the western part of the former Blankenburg lands. Tourism developed from the late 19th century onwards, other branches of business were forestry and a large granite quarry at the Wurmberg. Around 1910, one of the first interurban bus lines ran from Bad Harzburg up to Braunlage, served by B\u00fcssing vehicles. The Wurmberg Ski Jumps were erected in 1922 (demolished in 2014). In 1934 Braunlage received town privileges and municipal status as a health resort. After World War II, Braunlage was located close to the fortified inner German border which ran through the Harz mountains. In 1963 it became the location of the Wurmberg Gondola Lift, today with a length of and a height difference of to the summit station the longest in Northern Germany. On 7 May 1964 Gerhard Zucker demonstrated a flight of mail rockets on the Hasselkopf hill. One of these rockets exploded, killing two spectators. Since German reunification in 1990, Braunlage again is located in the centre of the Harz touristic region, however, it had to cope with growing competition by the neighbouring resorts in Saxony-Anhalt. === Demographics === Population statistics {| | {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
