The family lived in Braybrook, Victoria. Barrett started ballet lessons at the age of two and a half. In January 1957 she performed in the pantomime, Jack and Jill, at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne. Note: includes a photo of Barrett, aged 10. In 1963 she joined the cast of Swallow's Juniors, a children's TV talent contest and entertainment show on HSV7. Note: includes a photo of Barrett. She took singing lessons in her mid-teens, which led to musical theatre including, The Sound of Music, in the role of Louisa von Trapp, at the Princess Theatre in October 1961. She subsequently appeared in Carnival!, Wild Cat and Stop the World \u2013 I Want to Get Off. Barrett described working in musicals to The Australian Women's Weeklys correspondent in July 1964, \"I love everything about the theatre. We work odd hours, but it doesn't worry me. I've never known a nine to five job - and it's wonderful to be able to sleep in in the mornings.\" Barrett became a regular on pop music TV program, The Go!! Show, by 1965, where she performed her renditions, \"Off & Running\", \"I Walk Alone\" and the Toys' \"A Lovers Concerto\". She was signed to the related Go!! Records label, which issued her first three singles. She achieved her highest chart success with her cover version of Petula Clark's \"You're the One\" backed by her rendition of Chloee Harris' \"Little People\", in October 1965. Note: Chart positions back calculated by Kent in 2005. In December Barrett, along with fellow TV personalities, Ian Turpie, Tommy Hanlon Jr and Pat Carroll, entertained Australian troops during the Vietnam War. They were \"the first Government-sponsored entertainment team\" to visit the Australian troops in Vietnam. Her next single, \"Send Her Away\", appeared in July 1966 and was followed by \"Don't Bother Callin'\" in October; Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, described the singles as, \"minor hits in Melbourne.\" Barrett and Carroll returned to Vietnam for another tour in August 1968. Barrett was presented with a Vi\u1ec7t C\u1ed9ng flag during one of her two tours. Australian pop music newspaper, Go-Set (not related to Go!! Show or Go!!

She performed \"Always Something There to Remind Me\" and Rare Earth's, \"Get Ready\". During the 1970s she moved into session work and club appearances, and was a regular on Mary Hardy's The Penthouse Club on HSV7. Soon after she moved to Perth.

The couple had separated in the following year. Barrett's body was found on 3 September 1985, at her unit in Birchgrove, New South Wales. Her estranged husband, Truong, was found guilty of her murder. At his trial it was alleged that he had recently returned from New Zealand and spent a night with her. He was asked to leave the following morning but did not comply and assaulted her with a bottle to her head before strangling her with his belt. He then took Serepax tablets and cut his wrists. Death notices were published on 9 September 1985. Note: User must add 'Barrett' into the Surname search parameter and 'Yvonne' into the Any Given Name(s) parameter. Truong was sentenced to life imprisonment without a non-parole period, on 5 August 1986, by Justice Finlay of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. Finlay rejected a submission by the public defender, Bill Hosking, that Truong was \"suffering from a disease of the mind that impaired his responsibility for the crime.\" Hosking claimed that Truong's war service, tragic life and \"ingestion of marijuana at the time of this offence had occurred\" had diminished his responsibilities. Barrett's funeral was held at Christ the King, Catholic Church, Braybrook, Victoria. It was attended by Australian show business celebrities including, Bert and Patti Newton. Patti posted a condolence notice in The Age, \"What wonderful times to remember of growing up together.\" Barrett was buried at Altona Memorial Park, Victoria. == Discography == === Singles === * \"Little People\" / \"You're the One\" (October 1965) \u2013 Go!!
