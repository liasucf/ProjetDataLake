Willey will boost a pitching rotation that includes Roger Craig, Al Jackson and Tracy Stallard. The Mets will improve to 51\u2013111 in 1963. ===April=== *April 11 \u2013 Warren Spahn of the Milwaukee Braves becomes the all-time winningest left-handed pitcher in Major League Baseball history. His 6\u20131 victory over the New York Mets gives him 328 career wins, moving him ahead of Eddie Plank as the all-time winningest left- hander. Except for Duke Snider's home run in today's game, no Mets get past second base. *April 13 \u2014 After 11 hitless at bats, Cincinnati Reds second baseman Pete Rose records his first major league hit, a triple off Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Bob Friend. Increased enforcement of the balk rule produces a Major League record seven in the Pirates' 12\u20134 trouncing of the Reds at Crosley Field. Friend commits four of the balks. ===May=== *May 5- the Detroit Tigers released Vic Wertz. Wertz would later sign with the Minnesota Twins to finish out his 17 year career. *May 9 \u2013 Chicago Cubs first baseman Ernie Banks became the first National League player to record 22 putouts in a game, during a 3\u20131 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. *May 11 \u2013 At Dodger Stadium, Sandy Koufax of the Los Angeles Dodgers no-hits the San Francisco Giants 8\u20130, his second no-hitter in as many seasons. The final out is made by Harvey Kuenn on a ground ball back to than Koufax. Kuenn will also make the final out of Koufax's perfect game two years later. *May 17 \u2013 Houston Colt .45's pitcher Don Nottebart throws the first no-hitter in franchise history, leading his team past the Philadelphia Phillies, 4\u20131. *May 19 \u2013 Detroit Tigers center fielder Bill Bruton tied a Major League record for most doubles in a single game. Brutton hit his four doubles in a row, as Detroit defeated the Washington Senators, 5\u20131. Teammate and rookie pitcher Bill Faul tossed a three-hitter in his first Major League start. *May 23- The New York Mets trade Gil Hodges to the Washington Senators for Jim Piersall. Hodges returned to the Mets as their manager in 1968. ===June=== *June 2 \u2013 At Busch Stadium, Willie Mays hits three home runs off pitchers Ernie Broglio, Bob Humphreys and Bobby Shantz, helping the San Francisco Giants beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6\u20134. *June 9 \u2013 Ernie Banks hits three home runs. *June 10 \u2013 Al Kaline hit his 200th career home run helping the Detroit Tigers beat the Boston Red Sox 6\u20131. *June 11 \u2013 Bob Aspromonte clouts a walk-off grand slam in the tenth inning off pitcher Lindy McDaniel to give the Houston Colt .45s a 6\u20132 victory over the Chicago Cubs at Colt Stadium. *June 14 \u2013 The New York Mets' Duke Snider hits his 400th career home run off Bob Purkey in the first inning of the Mets' 10\u20133 victory over the Cincinnati Reds at Crosley Field. ** Willie Kirkland of the Cleveland Indians hits a home run in the 11th inning to tie the game 2-2. In the 19th inning, he hits the game winning home run to defeat the Washington Senators. Kirkland joins Vern Stephens as the only player to hit two extra inning home runs. *June 15 \u2013 At Candlestick Park, Juan Marichal of the San Francisco Giants no-hits the Houston Colt .45's, 1\u20130, becoming the first Latin American pitcher to throw a no-hitter. The no-hitter is the first by a Giant since the franchise's move from New York City after the 1957 season. Moreover, Marichal joined Carl Hubbell, who did it while pitching for the New York York Giants in 1929, as the second Giants pitcher to accomplish the feat. ===July=== *July 1- The Kansas City Athletics purchased the contract of Charley Lau from the Baltimore Orioles. *July 2 - The Giants' Juan Marichal pitched a 16-inning shutout against the Milwaukee Braves, outdueling Warren Spahn, who pitched 15_1/3 scoreless innings before Willie Mays won it 1-0 with a home run in the bottom of the 16th. In the 9th inning when the Giants' manager suggested Marichal should come out for a pinch hitter, he angrily replied \u201cI am not going to come out of that game as long as that old man is still pitching.\u201d Later, when the Braves manager suggested to Spahn that it was time for him to come out he was told that if that young kid could still pitch, then so could he. When it was over, Marichal had thrown 227 pitches and Spahn had thrown 201. *July 9 \u2013 At Municipal Stadium, the National League wins 5\u20133 over the American League in the All-Star Game. After four years, MLB had decided to return to the original single-game format. The American League out- hit the National League 11\u20136, but the effort went in vain as MVP Willie Mays put on a one-man show. Although he was held to a single, Mays collected two runs, two RBI, two stolen bases and made the defensive play of the game \u2014 a running catch that deprived Joe Pepitone of an extra base in the eighth inning. This game also marked the 24th and final All-Star appearance of Stan Musial, who pinch-hit in the fifth inning. He lined out to right field, leaving behind a .317 batting average (20-for-63) and an All-Star Game record of six home runs. *July 31 \u2013 A crowd of 7,288 at Cleveland Stadium watched Cleveland Indians infielder Woodie Held, pitcher Pedro Ramos, outfielder Tito Francona, and shortstop Larry Brown slug four straight solo home runs off Los Angeles Angels right-hander Paul Foytack in the bottom of the sixth inning. The four homers built the Indians' lead to 9\u20131, and they won, 9-5. ===August=== *August 7 \u2013 The New York Mets beat the St. Louis Cardinals, 7\u20133. Mets outfielder Jim Hickman hits for the cycle, doing it in order. Both are firsts for the Mets. *August 9 \u2013 Jim Hickman of the New York Mets becomes the second player to hit a walk-off grand slam against Chicago Cubs pitcher Lindy McDaniel this season, in a 7\u20133 victory at Polo Grounds. Bob Aspromonte of the Houston Colt .45s did that on June 11. McDaniel is the second pitcher in major-league history to surrender two game-ending grand slams in one season, joining Satchel Paige, who did that in . Other pitchers will join Paige and McDaniel in the coming years: Lee Smith, in , and Francisco Rodr\u00edguez in . *August 27 \u2013 Willie Mays hits 400th career home run helping San Francisco Giants beat St. Louis Cardinals 7\u20132. *August 23 \u2013 Milwaukee Braves veteran pitcher Warren Spahn topped the National League record for most starts in a season, previously set by Grover Alexander, with his 601st appearance on the mound during a 6\u20131 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers. Later in the season, Spahn would match a National League record set by Christy Mathewson with his 13th, 20-win season, while becoming the oldest pitcher to do so at age forty- two. *August 29 \u2013 Helped by a league-record-tying eight home runs, the Minnesota Twins garner a team-record forty-seven total bases in the first game of a double-header at D.C. Stadium. Harmon Killebrew and Vic Power both strike for two homers in the 14\u20132 victory. In the second game, a 10\u20131 Minnesota win, the Twins hit four more homers for a team-record even dozen on the day. ===September=== *September 5 \u2013 Willie McCovey hits 100th career home run. *September 6 \u2013 Major League Baseball celebrated its 100,000th game with a classic match-up between the Cleveland Indians and the Washington Senators at D.C. Stadium. *September 10 \u2013 The Alous become the first brother trio to bat consecutively in one game, during the eighth inning of a San Francisco Giants' 4\u20132 loss to the New York Mets at the Polo Grounds. Jes\u00fas pinch-hits in his Major League debut and grounds out to shortstop Al Moran; Matty, also pinch- hitting, strikes out, and Felipe ends the inning by grounding out to pitcher Carl Willey, who goes the distance for the victory. *September 13 \u2013 Cleveland Indians pitcher Early Wynn finally won his 300th and final game thanks to a little help from the Indian's bullpen. After losing eight straight starts and struggling through five innings against the Kansas City Athletics, Wynn was replaced by relief man Jerry Walker, who tossed four scoreless innings en route to a 7\u20134 win over the Athletics. *September 18 \u2013 In the final regular- season game ever played at the Polo Grounds, the Philadelphia Phillies defeat the New York Mets 6\u20131. New York gets its only run on Jim Hickman's 4th-inning home run, the last home run to be hit at the park. *September 21 \u2013 Harmon Killebrew, in a double-header split between his Minnesota Twins and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, hits four home runs on the day to tie an American League record. *September 22 \u2013 Willie McCovey hits 3 home runs helping San Francisco Giants beat New York Mets 13\u20134. *September 22 \u2013 Outfielder Jimmie Hall of the Minnesota Twins hits his 33rd and final home run of the year. No other rookie without previous-year at bats has hit more. Hall tops the current record-holder, Boston's Ted Williams, who hit 31 in 1939. *September 27 \u2013 Manager Harry Craft of the Houston Colt 45s fields the \"Baby Colts\", a starting line-up with an average age of nineteen years, against the New York Mets at Colt Stadium. The oldest player used by Houston all game was 26-year- old Dick Drott, who pitched the ninth inning. *September 28 \u2013 Minnesota Twins first baseman Vic Power hits his tenth home run of the year. It is the club's 225th, a season total that ranks second behind the 1961 New York Yankees' 240. *September 29- John Paciorek makes his MLB debut for the Houston Colt 45s at the age of 18. In the game Paciorek hits three hits, drive in four runs, and draws two walks. Since he reached base in all five plate appearances, he has a batting average of 1.000. However, this would be Paciorek's only appearance in a major league game. He'd suffer an injury in the minors that would end his baseball career by the time he was 24. ===October=== *October 6 \u2013 At Dodger Stadium, Sandy Koufax defeats the New York Yankees, 2\u20131, completing a shocking World Series sweep for the Los Angeles Dodgers. Whitey Ford gives up only two hits, both by Frank Howard, who belts a long home run in the fifth inning to start the Dodgers' scoring. In the Series, the Yankees bat just .171 and score only four runs, the second-lowest total in World Series history. Curiously enough, the Dodgers would set the mark for the least runs scored in a World Series only three years later, falling victim to a decisive sweep at the hands of the Baltimore Orioles. *October 12 \u2013 In the first (and last) Hispanic American major league All-Star Game, the National League team beats the American League 5\u20132 at the Polo Grounds. The game features such names as Felipe Alou, Luis Aparicio, Orlando Cepeda, Roberto Clemente, Juli\u00e1n Javier, Minnie Mi\u00f1oso, Tony Oliva and Zoilo Versalles. Vic Power receives a pregame award as the number one Latin player. NL starter Juan Marichal strikes out six in four innings, though reliever Al McBean is the winning pitcher. Pinch hitter Manny Mota drives in two runs against loser Pedro Ramos. This was the last baseball game played at the Polo Grounds, as the New York Mets would move into the brand new Shea Stadium in 1964.\"The forgotten all-star game: 50 years ago, baseball's Latino legends played in Polo Grounds\u2019 last game\", by Robert Dominguez, New York Daily News *October 29- The New York Yankees release catcher Yogi Berra. ===November=== *November 26 \u2013 Second baseman Pete Rose is a landslide winner of National League Rookie of the Year honors, taking 17 of 20 first place votes, with the others going to Ron Hunt (2) and Ray Culp (1). Rose becomes the second Cincinnati Reds player to win the award, joining Frank Robinson. *November 27: **Chicago White Sox pitcher Gary Peters, who posted a 19\u20138 record with 189 strikeouts and a 2.33 ERA, edges teammate third baseman Pete Ward (.295 BA, 22 HR, 84 RBI) and Minnesota Twins outfielder Jimmie Hall (.260, 33, 80) for American League Rookie of the Year honors. Peters takes 10 of 20 first-place votes, Ward six and Hall four. **In a first baseman transaction, the Kansas City Athletics acquire Jim Gentile and $25,000 from the Baltimore Orioles in exchange for Norm Siebern. ===December=== *December 2: ** The MLB Rules Committee bans oversized catcher's mitts, effective in 1965. **The Indianapolis and Little Rock franchises are transferred from the International League to the Pacific Coast League. With the movement, the IL is reduced to eight clubs while the PCL membership is raised to 12 clubs. ==Births== ===January=== *January 2 \u2013 David Cone *January 2 \u2013 Edgar Mart\u00ednez *January
