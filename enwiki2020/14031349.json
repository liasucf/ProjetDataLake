Gastric signet ring cell carcinoma. H&E; stain. In histology, a signet ring cell is a cell with a large vacuole. The malignant type is seen predominantly in carcinomas. Signet ring cells are most frequently associated with stomach cancer,Cancer Research UK. Signet Ring Cancer. cancerhelp.org.uk. URL: http://www.cancerhelp.org.uk/help/default.asp?page=7581 .

They contain a large amount of mucin, which pushes the nucleus to the cell periphery. The pool of mucin in a signet ring cell mimics the appearance of a finger hole and the nucleus mimics the appearance of the face of the ring in profile. ==Diagnostic significance== A significant number of signet ring cells, generally, are associated with a worse prognosis.Cabebe EC, Mehta VK, Fisher G.
