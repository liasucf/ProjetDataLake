Jean Ybarnegaray was born in Uhart- Cize, Department of Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es-Atlantiques, then called Basses Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, in the Northern Basque Country. He studied law at the Sorbonne and Bordeaux University and practised as a lawyer. He was elected to the Chamber of Deputies in April 1914. On the outbreak of the First World War, he was recalled to service. He was wounded and discharged from the army with the L\u00e9gion d'honneur, returning to the Chamber of Deputies, where he criticised the Nivelle Offensive of 1917, the armistice of 1918 and the Treaty of Versailles. A member of the Republican Federation, Ybarnegaray joined the French Social Party of Fran\u00e7ois de La Rocque in 1938. He served as Minister of State in Paul Reynaud's government from 10 May 1940. On arrival of refugees from the Basque (1937) and Catalan fronts (1939) in the Spanish Civil War, Ybarnegaray took a hostile stance against the exiles, labeling them as \"reds\" and turned a cold shoulder to Basque nationalism or any Basque political approach. He served in the Vichy government, as Minister of State in the first government of Marshal Philippe P\u00e9tain and as Minister for Veterans and the Family in the second P\u00e9tain government. He resigned his office on 6 September 1940. Ybarnegaray had undertaken French Resistance activities, assisting escapees in crossing the Pyrenees, for which he was arrested in 1943, and detained in Plansee in the state of Tyrol. Although he was sentenced after the war to losing civil rights, his Resistance activities resulted in the sentence being suspended. He died in Paris on 25 April 1956. ==References== * Category:1883 births Category:1956 deaths Category:People from Lower Navarre Category:Politicians from Nouvelle-Aquitaine Category:Republican Federation politicians Category:Republican Independents Category:French Social Party politicians Category:Government ministers of France Category:French Ministers of Veterans Affairs Category:Members of the 11th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 12th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 13th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 14th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 15th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:Members of the 16th Chamber of Deputies of the French Third Republic Category:University of Paris alumni Category:University of Bordeaux alumni Category:French collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:Basque collaborators with Nazi Germany Category:French military personnel of World War I Category:Chevaliers of the L\u00e9gion d'honneur ",
