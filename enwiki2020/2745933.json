    "text": "The Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Services Block Grant (or ADMS Block Grant) was a federal assistance block grant given by the United States Department of Health and Human Services. This block grant has been replaced by two separate block grants which cover essentially the same set of services once combined in the ADMS. These are the Substance Abuse Prevention and Treatment Block Grant (Substance Abuse Block Grant) ( et seq) and the Community Mental Health Services Block Grant. ==History== The ADMS block grant was created in August 1981 with passage the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 ( ). It replaced four earlier grant programs legislated by the Community Mental Health Centers Act, Mental Health Systems Act, Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Prevention, Treatment and Rehabilitation Act and Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act. Whereas those grants had been administered by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, National Institute on Drug Abuse, and National Institute of Mental Health, the ADMS grants were administered by the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Administration. ==See also== * Social programs in the United States * Administration of federal assistance in the United States ==References== Category:Federal assistance in the United States Category:United States Department of Health and Human Services ",
