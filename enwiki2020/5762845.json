It seems to be a part of classic British cuisine and while by no means common, it appears on menus in some British hotels and restaurants. Essentially, it is a pounded beef fillet, rolled around a filling of pate de foie gras, then wrapped with bacon and braised in spiked stock. Category:Beef dishes ",
