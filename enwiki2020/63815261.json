    "text": "Lemmermannia /\u02ccl\u025bm\u0259\u0279\u02c8m\u00e6ni\u0259/ is a genus of fresh water trebouxiophyceans that currently contains four described species forming coenobia of 4 to 16 cells. Bock, C., Luo, W., Kusber, W.-H., Hegewald, E., Pa\u017eoutov\u00e1, M., & Krienitz, L. (2013, April).Classification of crucigenoid algae: phylogenetic position of the reinstated genus Lemmermannia, Tetrastrum spp. Crucigenia tetrapedia, and C. lauterbornii (Trebouxiophyceae, Chlorophyta) (1). Rerieved April 28, 2020. doi: 10.1111/jpy.12039.. Its type species is L. tetrapedia (Kirchner) Lemmermann, originally described in 1880 but put into the genus Lemmermannia in 1904Kirchner, O. (1880).

Das Plankton schwedischer Gew\u00e4sser. Arkiv f\u00f6r Botanik 2 (2): 1-209.. == Etymology == The genus is named in honor of German botanist Ernst Johann LemmermannChodat, R. (1900). Sur trois genres nouveaux de Protococcoid\u00e9es et sur la florule planktonique d'un \u00c9tang du Danemark. M\u00e9moires de L\u2018Herbier Boissier 8:1\u201310.. == History == In 1880, Kirchner described Staurogenia tetrapedia. In 1897, Schr\u00f6der described Tetrapedia emarginataSchr\u00f6der, B. (1897). Attheya, Rhizosolenia und andere Planktonorganismen im Teiche des botanischen Gartens zu Breslau. Ber. Deutsch. Bot. Ges. 15:367\u201374. In 1898, Kuntze moved Staurogenia tetrapedia to the genus Crucigenia, in the name Crucigenia tetrapediaKuntze,O.(1898). Revisio generum plantarum. Pars III (3). pp.1-576.. In 1900, Chodat described the genus Lemmermannia and used T. emarginata (now L. emarginata) as the type of the new genus . In 1904, Lemmermann moved Crucigenia tetrapedia into Lemmermannia as Lemmermannia tetrapedia, which was not widely recognized; the old name Crucigenia tetrapedia was kept in use. The genus Lemmermannia has been ignored for many years until 2013. In 2013, Bock et al. found a new clade of algae including Crucigenia tetrapedia and three others using molecular methods. Bock et al. (2013) decided that Crucigenia tetrapedia and Lemmermannia emarginata are the same organism. Since C. tetrapedia was described first (in 1880) and has priority, it is the species name that should be used. The type of Lemmermannia thus changed its name, from L. emarginata to L. tetrapedia (Kirchner) Lemmermann 1904. Three other species formerly in the genus Tetrastrum were added to Lemmermannia. == Habitat == All species inhabit freshwater around the globe. L. tetrapedia has been reported highly susceptible to heavy metals in waterMonteiro, M. T., Oliveira, R., & Vale, C. (1995). Metal stress on the plankton communities of Sado river (Portugal). Water Research, 29(2), 695-701. Retrieved April 28, 2020. doi:10.1016/0043-1354(94)00156-2. == Morphology == Lemmermannia includes triangular or oval green, planktonic algae that mostly form tightly joined square coenobia of 4 cells, with or without small rectangular opening in the centre.. L. komarekii make coenobia of up to 16 cells in the form of near- square synceonobia, where 4 tetrads join together. The cells have a single plastid, with or without a small pyrenoid. All species lack spines, and mostly have smooth cell walls, with or without convexity. A minority of L. punctata individuals, as well as old empty cells of the species, have granules on the outer cell walls == Metabolism == Lemmermannia tetrapedia can use hypoxanthine and allantoin as the only nitrogen source for photosynthesis, which indicates that eukaryotic algae share similar purine degradation pathway to higher plants, animals, and fungiPrasad, P. V. D. (1983). Hypoxanthine and allantoin as nitrogen sources for the growth of some freshwater green algae. New Phytologist, 93(4), 575\u2013580. Retrieved April 28, 2020. doi: 10.1111/j.1469-8137.1983.tb02708.x.. == Reproduction == Lemmermannia perform asexual reproduction (autosporation by sporangium); sexual reproduction has not been observed. Lemmermannia species perform two types of reproduction: L. tetrapedia exhibits Crucigenia-type of autosporation where the daughter coenobium rotates 45\u02da relative to the cell wall of the mother coenobium; the other four species produce daughter coenobia in the same orientation as the mother coenobia. This demonstrates that in this taxon a Crucigenia-type of autosporation should not be used as a generic character. == Phylogeny == Molecular phylogenies based on the SSU rDNA and ITS rRNA genes show Lemmermannia to be a sister clade to Botryococcus in Trebouxiophyceae. == List of Species == According to Block et al, there are four identified species in Lemmermannia [2]: \u2022 Lemmermannia tetrapedia (Kirchner) Lemmermann \u2022 Lemmermannia triangularis (Chodat) C. Bock et Krienitz comb. nov. \u2022 Lemmermannia punctata (Schmidle) C. Bock et Krienitz comb. nov. \u2022 Lemmermannia komarekii (Hind\u00e1k) C.
