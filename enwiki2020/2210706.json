    "text": "Littlefield is an unincorporated community and census-designated place in Mohave County located in the Arizona Strip region of the U.S. state of Arizona. As of the 2010 census, its population was 308. It lies just south of Interstate 15, next to the Virgin River, approximately northeast of Mesquite, Nevada. Littlefield is located in the 86432 zip code. ==History== Littlefield was first settled by Latter-day Saints, also known as Mormons, in 1865.Andrew Jenson. Encyclopedic History of the Church. (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941). p. 438 Littlefield is the former home of the Littlefield Unified School District, the geographically largest school district in Arizona. The only school-related thing left in Littlefield is the historic adobe Littlefield Schoolhouse, currently under renovations. Littlefield, Beaver Dam, and Scenic have the distinction of being the only towns in Arizona along I-15. Owing to its location in the Arizona Strip, northwest of Grand Canyon National Park and west of the Virgin River, it is isolated by hundreds of miles from the rest of the state. Travel to other towns within Arizona requires crossing through either Nevada or Utah, or driving on unpaved roads to the rest of Arizona's road network. The Virgin River Gorge is located just to the east of Littlefield. ==Demographics== ==See also== * Beaver Dam Elementary School * Beaver Dam Middle School * Beaver Dam High School * Littlefield Unified School District * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Arizona ==Notes== ==External links== * Littlefield Unified School District No. 9 * Littlefield School Memories on Facebook Category:Census-designated places in Mohave County, Arizona Category:Populated places established in 1865 Category:Census-designated places in Arizona Category:History of the Mojave Desert region Category:1865 establishments in Arizona Territory ",
