The strategy set the vision of Malta to become one of the top 10 information societies in the world by 2010. The new strategy sought to proactively address several major challenges including: the new digital divides; the successful application of technologies in the enhancement of quality of life; and the constantly moving target of becoming (and remaining) a leading ICT industry in the region. === Digital Malta Strategy (2014-2020) === In 2013, MITA drew up a national strategy for the digital economy. On 24 March 2014, the Digital Malta \u2013 the National Digital Strategy for 2014-2020 was launched by the Prime Minister Hon Dr. Joseph Muscat. Digital Malta puts forward a set of guiding principles and policy actions of how ICT can be used for socio-economic development. It sets out a path how ICT can be applied to different sectors of the economy and society, and how citizens and businesses can benefit from its application. On 15 May 2014, the Prime Minister Hon. Dr Joseph Muscat inaugurated MITA Innovation Hub SmartCity Malta, an Internet-enabled office environment which students, web innovators, software developers and start-ups can use to develop proof-of-concept projects supported by mentors from the industry, as well as by software tools and other resources made available by world players from the ICT industry. The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) published by the European Commission in early 2016, placed Malta in the \u2018running ahead\u2019 cluster of EU countries, and confirmed that Malta is among the \u2018fastest growing\u2019 digital economies in the EU. Furthermore, Malta has been reconfirmed as leader in the delivery and performance of eGovernment services amongst 34 countries (28 European Union member states together with Iceland, Norway, Serbia, Switzerland, Turkey and Montenegro). The results were published in the eGovernment Benchmark Report 2016 issued in October 2016 by the European Commission. === Malta Cyber Security Strategy (2016) === After a green paper and numerous consultation sessions with businesses and the general public, on 23 September 2016, the Minister for Competitiveness and Digital, Maritime and Services Economy launched the first national Cyber Security Strategy.
