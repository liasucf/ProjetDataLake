Founded in 2012 by two former Nebraska Cornhuskers football players, opendorse has become the world's leading athlete marketing platform. Founded in 2012, the company is based in Lincoln, Nebraska. Founders Blake Lawrence and Adi Kunalic built and sold a 25 person social media agency that used social media to connect brand clients with customers and athletes with fans. In 2011, Lawrence and Kunalic began to work with athletes in brand campaigns and were exposed to the challenges that faced both parties. Lawrence and Kunalic subsequently founded opendorse seeking to help athletes share content on social. As of July 2019, opendorse was on pace to become the largest sports content publisher following a $3.1M round of funding. == References == Category:Companies based in Nebraska Category:Companies based in Lincoln, Nebraska Category:2013 establishments in Nebraska ",
