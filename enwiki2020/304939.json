    "text": "Philosophical logic refers to those areas of philosophy in which recognized methods of logic have traditionally been used to solve or advance the discussion of philosophical problems.Dale Jacquette, A Companion to Philosophical Logic, Wiley-Blackwell: 2002. Among these, Sybil Wolfram highlights the study of argument, meaning, and truth, while Colin McGinn presents identity, existence, predication, necessity and truth as the main topics of his book on the subject.Preface to Colin McGinn, Logical Properties: Identity, Existence, Predication, Necessity, Truth, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000 (). Philosophical logic also addresses extensions and alternatives to traditional, \"classical\" logic known as \"non-classical\" logics. These receive more attention in texts such as John P. Burgess's Philosophical Logic,John P. Burgess, Philosophical Logic, Princeton University Press: 2009. the Blackwell Companion to Philosophical Logic,Lou Goble (ed.), The Blackwell Guide to Philosophical Logic, Oxford: Blackwell: 2009 (). or the multi-volume Handbook of Philosophical Logic edited by Dov M.
