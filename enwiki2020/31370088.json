The students come from both the town and several of the surrounding villages. The school had specialist status for science from 2003. The proportion of students with learning difficulties and/or disabilities(LDD) was well above average; though the proportion of students with SEN statements was is broadly average. Demographically the majority of students are White British. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. \u00a9 Crown copyright It was closed requiring improvement in 2015, and the student transferred into the new academy. The school was helped through the transition period by seconded staff from William Howard Trust, and subsequently they joined that trust. The trust was renamed Cumbria Education Trust. ===New building=== The academy was first situated in the same Stainburn School and Science College building. It relocated to the new building, located at the same site, in March 2017. Workington Academy's new building was officially opened on Tuesday 26 September 2017 by Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Gloucester. As of 2018, both the Southfield Technology College building and the Stainburn School and Science College building have been demolished. Workington is small isolated community where change happens slowly, from Lancaster, from Newcastle-upon-Tyne and from Manchester. ==Cumbria Education Trust== The academy is part of the Cumbria Education Trust multi-academy trust. The trust's Chief Executive Officer is Mrs Lorrayne Hughes. 30px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0. \u00a9 Crown copyright ==Academics== The 2018 Ofsted Report identified that the current headteacher is showing leadership, and is supported by the parents and children. It identifies that the school was not meeting government floor standards previously, and the principal problem for most pupils is raising their literacy and numeracy standards to an age appropriate level. It acknowledges that some children level cannot control their behaviour in the corridors and social areas and in some cases the classroom. Ofsted calls them 'a small disruptive minority', some teachers are targeted leading to variable quality of learning. The head has put strategies in place, and year on year the results are improving. The Cumbria Education Trust has broadly the same curriculum in its three secondary schools, based on the principle that each child is entitled to receive the education described in the UK governments National Curriculum - the trusts plans to exceed it. ===2020 Sixth form=== In September 2020 a new level of co-operation starts with the initiation of the West Coast Sixth Form. Students from Whitehaven Academy and Workington wanting to enter one of the three pathways of sixth-form education (Academic, Vocational and Other), will study in a combined sixthform. There will be a free bus service between the two sites ==Negative publicity== In July 2017, the school received negative publicity after parents and pupils reported of poor teaching on a local Facebook page, with people claiming that there were a large amount of supply teachers and pupils being allowed to play on mobile phones. The interim headteacher, Colette Macklin, promptly hit back at the claims in an interview with local newspaper News and Star. ==Headteachers== * Mr Jonathan Logan (2015\u20132016) * Mrs Colette Macklin (Interim, 2016\u20132017) * Mr Des Bird (2018\u2013present) ==References== == External links == * Workington Academy official website * Cumbria Education Trust website Category:Secondary schools in Cumbria Category:Academies in Cumbria Category:Workington ",
