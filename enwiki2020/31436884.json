Poor visibility and malfunctioning instruments in the cockpit led the pilots to lose control. The Douglas DC-3 aircraft was damaged beyond repair. This was the first airline fatality in Pakistan after its independence in 1947. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Air India accidents and incidents Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1947 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in Pakistan Category:1947 in Pakistan Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas DC-3 Category:History of Sindh (1947\u2013present) Category:December 1947 events ",
