    "text": "\"Lookin' Out for #1\" is a 1975 song written by Randy Bachman and first recorded by Canadian rock group Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (BTO) for their December, 1975 album Head On. The lead vocal is provided by Randy Bachman. Released in early 1976, it was the second of two singles from the LP to be issued in North America, following \"Take It Like a Man\". A departure from BTO's earlier heavy rock releases, \"Lookin' Out for #1\" was strongly influenced by Randy\u2019s jazz upbringing and tutelage under Lenny Breau. In his book Randy Bachman\u2019s Vinyl Tap Stories, Randy stated: \"The chord progression on \u2018Lookin' Out for #1\u2019 came from the Mickey Baker Guitar Book that Lenny Breau had told me about when I was a teenager. It was a chance for me to stretch out a bit on the guitar. It\u2019s still among my most requested live songs, and made the transition to my jazz career.\" \"Lookin\u2019 Out for #1\" did not perform particularly well on the U.S. Billboard pop charts, peaking at #65 on May 15, 1976 and spending just six weeks in the Hot 100. On the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart, however, it was a Top 20 hit, peaking at #15 on May 29, 1976. As a result, the song got significant airplay on soft rock radio stations, a first for BTO. There are multiple versions of the \"Lookin\u2019 Out for #1\" single. The initial U.S. and Canadian releases have an edited version of the song, running 3:50. Some versions released in Europe have the full album version of the song, running 5:19. Both of these releases had \"Find Out About Love\" as the B-side. A version released in late 1976 has \"Take It Like a Man\", the band\u2019s prior hit from the Head On album, on the B-side. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Chart (1976) !Peak position |- |US Billboard Hot 100 |align=\"center\"|65 |- |US Billboard Easy Listening |align=\"center\"|15 |- |Canada RPM Top 100 |align=\"center\"|40 |- |} ==References== Category:1976 songs Category:1976 singles Category:Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive songs Category:Mercury Records singles Category:Songs written by Randy Bachman ",
