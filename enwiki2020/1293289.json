    "text": "\"The economy, stupid\" is a phrase coined by James Carville in 1992. It is often quoted from a televised quip by Carville as \"It\u2019s the economy, stupid.\" Carville was a strategist in Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign against incumbent George H. W. Bush. His phrase was directed at the campaign's workers and intended as one of three messages for them to focus on. The others were \"Change vs. more of the same\" and \"Don't forget health care.\" Clinton's campaign advantageously used the then-prevailing recession in the United States as one of the campaign's means to successfully unseat George H. W. Bush. In March 1991, days after the ground war in Kuwait, 90% of polled Americans approved of President Bush's job performance.Agiesta, Jennifer. Approval Highs and Lows . The Washington Post. 2007-07-24. Later the next year, Americans' opinions had turned sharply; 64% of polled Americans disapproved of Bush's job performance in August 1992. ==History== In order to keep the campaign on message, Carville hung a sign in Bill Clinton's Little Rock campaign headquarters that read: #Change vs. more of the same. #The economy, stupid #Don't forget health care. Although the sign was intended for an internal audience of campaign workers, the second phrase became a de facto slogan for the Clinton election campaign. ==Legacy== The phrase has become a snowclone repeated often in American political culture, usually starting with the word \"it's\" and with commentators sometimes using a different word in place of \"economy\". Examples include \"It's the deficit, stupid!\"Plumer, Bradford. It's the Deficit, Stupid!. Mother Jones. 2004-09-16. \"It's the corporation, stupid!\"Ivins, Molly. It's the Corporation, Stupid. AlterNet. 2006-02-23. \"It's the math, stupid!\"Falvey, Christopher J. It's the Math, Stupid. The VN/VO. 2005-01-03., and \"It's the voters, stupid!\"\"It's the Voters, Stupid\" Time 2008-01-21 A 2019 cartoon by Ren\u00e9 Cattin depicts Bill Clinton expressing the line \"It's the economy, stupid\" in 1992 while in 2019, teen climate activist Greta Thunberg climbs up a stepladder writing over the word \"economy\" and replacing that word with \"planet\" below. ==See also== * List of United States political catchphrases * The War Room * Keep it simple, stupid ==References== Category:1992 United States presidential election Category:American political catchphrases Category:Snowclones Category:Bill Clinton Category:Words and phrases introduced in 1992 ",
