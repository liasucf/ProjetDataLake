    "text": "R.E.M. Live is a live album from R.E.M., recorded at the Point Theatre, Dublin, on February 26 and 27, 2005, the closing nights of the winter European leg of the Around the World Tour in support of their thirteenth studio album Around the Sun released in late 2004. It was released in the United Kingdom on October 15, 2007 and in the United States a day later as a two-Compact Disc audio set and a DVD, then released in February 2008 as a triple vinyl set. The performance was filmed by Blue Leach, who also directed Depeche Mode's Touring the Angel: Live in Milan. R.E.M. Live features rare performances of \"I Took Your Name\" from 1994's Monster and \"Ascent of Man\" from Around The Sun as well as the previously unreleased \"I'm Gonna DJ.\" A studio version of that song would later appear on the band's 2008 effort, Accelerate. On September 26, 2007, the band launched R.E.M. Live Zine to solicit reviews from fans and promote the album. The DVD has the option for stereo or digital 5.1 surround sound. ==Reception== ==Track listing== All songs written by Peter Buck, Mike Mills and Michael Stipe except as indicated. ;CD 1 #\"I Took Your Name\" (Bill Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Monster) \u2013 4:08 #\"So Fast, So Numb\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on New Adventures in Hi-Fi) \u2013 4:40 #\"Boy in the Well\" (originally on Around the Sun) \u2013 5:16 #\"Cuyahoga\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Lifes Rich Pageant) \u2013 4:25 #\"Everybody Hurts\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Automatic for the People) \u2013 6:49 #\"Electron Blue\" (originally on Around the Sun) \u2013 4:13 #\"Bad Day\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on In Time: The Best of R.E.M. 1988-2003) \u2013 4:26 #\"The Ascent of Man\" (originally on Around the Sun) \u2013 4:12 #\"The Great Beyond\" (originally on Man on the Moon Soundtrack) \u2013 4:49 #\"Leaving New York\" (originally on Around the Sun) \u2013 4:48 #\"Orange Crush\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Green) \u2013 4:27 #\"I Wanted to Be Wrong\" (originally on Around the Sun) \u2013 5:02 #\"Final Straw\" (originally on Around the Sun) \u2013 4:10 #\"Imitation of Life\" (originally on Reveal) \u2013 3:53 #\"The One I Love\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Document) \u2013 3:27 #\"Walk Unafraid\" (originally on Up) \u2013 5:02 #\"Losing My Religion\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Out of Time) \u2013 4:53 ;CD 2 # * \"What's the Frequency, Kenneth?\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Monster) \u2013 4:06 #\"Drive\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Automatic for the People) \u2013 5:41 #\"(Don't Go Back To) Rockville\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Reckoning) \u2013 4:39 #\"I'm Gonna DJ\" (later released on Accelerate) \u2013 2:27 #\"Man on the Moon\" (Berry, Buck, Mills, Stipe) (originally on Automatic for the People) \u2013 6:46 The DVD consists of all of the preceding songs, in the same sequence.
