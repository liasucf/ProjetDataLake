    "text": "The 1935 Quebec general election was held on November 25, 1935 to elect members of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Quebec, Canada. The incumbent Quebec Liberal Party, led by Louis-Alexandre Taschereau was re- elected, defeating the Action lib\u00e9rale nationale, led by Paul Gouin, and the Quebec Conservative Party, led by Maurice Duplessis. It was the fourth and final general election victory in a row for Taschereau, who had held office since 1920. He would resign less than seven months later due to a scandal. The Action lib\u00e9rale nationale (ALN) was a newly formed party led by the son of former Liberal premier Lomer Gouin. It was established by former Liberals who had become dissatisfied with the party. The ALN and Conservatives formed an alliance, the Union Nationale, to contest this election, and after the election merged to form the Union Nationale as a fully-fledged party, which soon became a dominant political force. ==Results== {| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse border-color: #444444\" |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" !rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Party !rowspan=\"2\"|Party leader !rowspan=\"2\"|# of candidates !colspan=\"3\"|Seats !colspan=\"3\"|Popular Vote |- bgcolor=\"darkgray\" |align=\"center\"|1931 |align=\"center\"|Elected |align=\"center\"|% Change |align=\"center\"|# |align=\"center\"|% |align=\"center\"|% Change | Louis-Alexandre Taschereau |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|79 !align=\"right\"|47 |align=\"right\"|-40.5% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 46.53% |align=\"right\"|-8.35% |Action lib\u00e9rale nationale | Paul Gouin |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|* !align=\"right\"|25 |align=\"right\"|* |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 29.48% |align=\"right\"|* |Conservative | Maurice Duplessis |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 11 !align=\"right\"| 17 |align=\"right\"| +54.5% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 18.93% |align=\"right\"| -24.6% |colspan=2|Other |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|- !align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"|- |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"| 5.06% |align=\"right\"|+3.5% |- |colspan=\"3\"|Total !align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|90 !align=\"right\"|89 !align=\"right\"|-1.1% !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"|100% |align=\"right\"| |- |} Note: * Party did not nominate candidates in the previous election. ==See also== * List of Quebec premiers * Politics of Quebec * Timeline of Quebec history * List of Quebec political parties * 19th Legislative Assembly of Quebec Quebec general election Category:Elections in Quebec General election Quebec general election ",
