    "text": "The Venta de Ba\u00f1os\u2013Gij\u00f3n railway is a Spanish railway linking Gij\u00f3n, Asturias to the rest of the mainline Spanish rail network. ==Route== The line branches from the Madrid\u2013Hendaye railway at Venta de Ba\u00f1os, and serves Palencia, Le\u00f3n and Oviedo before reaching Gij\u00f3n. At Le\u00f3n, the Le\u00f3n\u2013A Coru\u00f1a railway starts. ==Services== The Cercan\u00edas Asturias commuter rail service operates to Puente de los Fierres from Gij\u00f3n; and a Renfe Regional service runs the full length of the line from Gij\u00f3n to Valladolid-Campo Grande, taking 5 hours and 43 minutes. ==Future== The line is to be extended from its current Gij\u00f3n terminus further into the city to Cabue\u00f1es via a tunnel with underground stations. This project, known as Metrotr\u00e9n Asturias, stalled in 2006, but is due to resume in 2019 and conclude in 2023. ==References== Category:Railway lines in Spain Category:Railway lines opened in 1884 Category:Iberian gauge railways ",
