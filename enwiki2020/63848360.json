    "text": "Goldmine is the debut album from American country music singer Gabby Barrett. It was released on June 19, 2020, through Warner Nashville. ==Content== Barrett told the blog Sounds Like Nashville that she had begun writing songs for the album in 2018 and 2019, with lead single \"I Hope\" having been written in late 2018. Pop singer Charlie Puth, after hearing the song, contacted Barrett on Instagram and offered to remix it with his own vocals. \"I Hope\" reached No. 1 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart dated April 25, 2020, and also topped the Billboard Country Streaming Songs chart, which made Barrett the first woman to score a No. 1 on that chart with her debut single. Ross Copperman and Zach Kale produced the entire album, with assistance on some tracks from Jimmy Robbins, Sam Martin, and Bryan Fowler. Contemporary Christian duo Shane & Shane are featured on \"Got Me\". \"The Good Ones\" was released on June 8, 2020 as the album's second single.https://bulletins.billboard.com/country/country_update_0601.pdf ==Critical reception== Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found the album's sound \"draped in a digital gloss designed to appeal to a number of different demographics\". He also thought that Barrett's presence as a cowriter on all but one song helped to establish her musical identity. Brian Mansfield gave the album a largely positive review for Variety, comparing Barrett's vocals favorably to those of Carrie Underwood while also praising the hooks written in songs such as \"The Good Ones\" and \"Hall of Fame\". ==Commercial performance== Goldmine debuted at number four on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart, earning 20,000 equivalent album units. The album garnered 15.98 million on-demand streams in its opening week, breaking the record for the largest streaming week ever for a debut country album by a woman. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Adapted from AllMusic ;Vocals *Trannie Anderson \u2013 background vocals *Gabby Barrett \u2013 lead vocals, background vocals *Ross Copperman \u2013 background vocals *Zach Kale \u2013 background vocals *Charlie Puth \u2013 duet vocals on \"I Hope (Remix)\" *Rozes \u2013 background vocals *Shane & Shane \u2013 featuring vocals on \"Got Me\" ;Musicians and production *Jacob Arnold \u2013 drums *Ross Copperman \u2013 acoustic guitar, keyboards, programming *Adam Doleac \u2013 acoustic guitar *Dan Fernandez \u2013 bass guitar, guitar *Cade Foehner \u2013 guitar *Bryan Fowler \u2013 guitar, keyboards, programming *Jonny Fung \u2013 banjo, bass guitar, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, programming *Caleb Gilbreath \u2013 drums *Adam Griffith \u2013 guitar *Zach Kale \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar, keyboards, programming *Sam Martin \u2013 guitar, keyboards, programming *Buckley Miller \u2013 programming *Spence Peppard \u2013 guitar *Danny Rader \u2013 acoustic guitar *Jimmy Robbins \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar, programming *Shane & Shane \u2013 acoustic guitar *Derek Wells \u2013 guitar *Alex Wright \u2013 keyboards *Nir Z. \u2013 drums ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" !
