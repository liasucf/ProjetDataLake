    "text": "Abu Ishaq al-Saffar al-Bukhari (), was an important representative of the Sunni theological school of Abu Mansur al-Maturidi (d. c. 333/944) and the author of Talkhis al-Adilla li-Qawa'id al-Tawhid () which is a voluminous kalam work. He lived in Bukhara under the dominance of West Karakhanids. His theological works, his method in kalam, and frequent reference to his works by Ottoman and Arab scholars indicate that al-Saffar is a respected and authoritative Hanafi-Maturidi theologian who systematically establishes his ideas about kalam believing that information based upon reason, revealed knowledge and senses are determinative in his area. == Name == Abu Ishaq Ibrahim b. Isma'il b. Ahmad b. Ishaq b. Shayth, known as al-Zahid al-Saffar. The alternative name Ibrahim b. Ishaq, recorded by Brockelmann in his GAL, is found only in the British Museum manuscript no. 1577, Add. 27526, and is presumably erroneous, since the few biobibliographical sources that mention al-Saffar call him Ibn Isma'il. == See also == * Abu Hanifa * Abu Mansur al- Maturidi * Abu al-Yusr al-Bazdawi * Abu al-Mu'in al-Nasafi * List of Ash'aris and Maturidis * List of Muslim theologians == References == Category:Hanafis Category:Maturidis Category:Muslim theologians Category:Sunni imams Category:Sunni Muslim scholars Category:Hanafi fiqh scholars Category:Uzbekistani Muslims Category:12th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:11th-century Muslim scholars of Islam Category:1067 births Category:1060s births Category:1139 deaths Category:11th-century jurists Category:12th-century jurists ",
