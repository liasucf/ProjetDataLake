She appeared in 16 games during the regular season, averaging 2.9 points per game. Haukar dominated during the season, winning all four major trophies; the national championship, the Icelandic Basketball Cup, the Supercup and the Company Cup while also finishing with the best win-loss record in the \u00darvalsdeild. During the offseason, Haukar lost several key players, including stars Helena Sverrisd\u00f3ttir and P\u00e1l\u00edna Gunnlaugsd\u00f3ttir. Despite the losses he guided the team to Icelandic Cup finals and the \u00darvalsdeild playoffs.

On 9 January 2014, she became the first player to be charged by the Icelandic Basketball Federation's referee committee for her unsportsmanlike foul on Helga Hj\u00f6rd\u00eds Bj\u00f6rgvinsd\u00f3ttir during Valur's game against Sn\u00e6fell on 8 January. She was cleared by the Federations disciplinary court as it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction over incidents where a referee called a foul on player but did not eject him. ===Stjarnan (2015\u20132019)=== On 19 August 2015, Ragna signed with newly promoted Stjarnan. The season turned out to be highly disappointing with high scoring American guard Chelsie Schweers being fired in December and head coach Baldur Ingi J\u00f3nasson resigning in February.

In the playoffs, Stjarnan got swept in the first round by Sn\u00e6fell. After the season she was named to the Domestic All-First team for the second time in her career. On 3 February 2018, Ragna collided with Sn\u00e6fell's Anna Soff\u00eda L\u00e1rusd\u00f3ttir, resulting in a concussion that forced her to miss the rest of the season. Without her, Stjarnan missed out on the playoffs with a loss against Skallagr\u00edmur in the last game of the regular season. On 27 September 2018, she said in an interview with Karfan.is that she was still dealing with issues from the head injury and was unsure when she would return to the court. In January 2019, Ragna resumed training with Stjarnan but stated that there was no timetable for her return to the court. On 9 January, she played her first game since the injury, scoring 7 points in 12 minutes in a loss against Keflav\u00edk. She appeared in 8 games during the season, averaging 9.5 points and 6.0 rebounds. Her last game came on 27 February 2019 and she did not play during the playoffs. Following the season, Ragna retired from competitive basketball. ==Icelandic national team== From 2008 to 2017, Ragna played 43 games for the Icelandic national basketball team.
