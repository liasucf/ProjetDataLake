    "text": "\"Alone and Forsaken\" is a song written and demoed by Hank Williams. It has been since covered by many artists. It was featured in the 2013 video game The Last Of Us, appearing during the cutscene titled bil-hun-transition. ==Background== The recording of \"Alone and Forsaken\" by Williams was taken from a performance on Shreveport radio from KWKH studio between August 1948 and May 1949\" MGM released it in 1955, over two years after Williams' death. The singer accompanies himself alone on an acoustic guitar. The song explores the themes of loneliness and desolation, which Williams had written about on previous ballads like \"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\" and \"May You Never Be Alone,\" but this song, set in A minor and featuring only Hank's guitar and voice, has a stark quality that is darkly affecting. It is one of the few songs that Williams ever wrote and sang that sounds more like a folk song than a country song. In the half spoken verses, the narrator reflects upon meeting his love, when \"the pastures were green and the meadows were gold,\" but \"her love, like the leaves, now have withered and gone.\" The darkening imagery gives way to a desperate plea on the chorus: ::\"Alone and forsaken by fate and by man ::Oh Lord, if you hear me, please hold to my hand, oh please understand.\" ==Cover versions== *The first issued version of the song was by Bill Darnell, who recorded it on January 16, 1952. *Pianist Floyd Cramer recorded an instrumental version in 1962 on RCA. *Chet Atkins (who played guitar on several of Williams' recordings) recorded it for his 1965 album More of That Guitar Country. *A previously unissued version by Hank Williams, Jr. recorded in 1974 appears on the 1992 box set Living Proof: The MGM Recordings 1963-1975. *Tony Rice recorded it on his 1975 LP California Autumn. *British rock band the Mekons issued the song as the B-side to their 1986 single \"Hello Cruel World.\" *Townes Van Zandt performs the song on the 1996 album In Pain. *Neko Case included a version on her 2001 EP Canadian Amp. *The album is featured on the 2001 tribute album Timeless: Hank Williams Tribute as a duet by Mark Knopfler and Emmylou Harris. *The song appears on the 2011 Social Distortion album Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes. *Tim O'Brien and Darrell Scott covered the song for their 2013 album Memories and Moments. *Blue Grass Boogiemen covered the song on their Hits of Hank Williams album. *16 Horsepower covered the song on their album Folklore. *Dave Matthews and Neil Young covered it on \"Help F OK R Haiti\", the fund-raising album produced in 2010 to benefit the victims of the Haitian earthquake that spring. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:1952 songs Category:Songs written by Hank Williams Category:Hank Williams songs ",
