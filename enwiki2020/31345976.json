He was a member of the Tepenahuales, a group of Nahua Aztecs who were on their way to Zacatula (Colima) when they decided to settle the San Mart\u00edn de Hidalgo area. The first Spanish conquistadores came in 1540, during his time as chief, and humbly he and his people seceded their town and possessions to the Spanish newcomers. For his nobleness, the Spanish named him Captain and gave him a part of the portion of the land seceded. Today, in honor of the chief, there is a street in San Mart\u00edn de Hidalgo called \"Mart\u00edn Huitzingarit\" ==References== Category:Indigenous Mexicans ",
