    "text": "Basque Country Veleia was a Roman town in Hispania, now located in the Basque Autonomous Community, Spain. The site is located in the municipality of Iru\u00f1a de Oca, 10 kilometers west of Vitoria. The town was an important station on the Roman road ab Asturica Burdigalam that ran parallel to the coast of the Bay of Biscay. At its apogee, the city could have been inhabited by some five to ten thousand people, and apparently went through different cycles of prosperity and decline into the Early Middle Ages until it was finally abandoned. It has been argued (e.g. J.M.Lacarra) that the location of Iru\u00f1a is actually the Victoriacum founded by Liuvigild in his campaigns against the Vascones (581), since only a very small portion of the actual town has been unearthed so far by archaeologists. The archaeological site of Iru\u00f1a-Veleia is the most important from the Roman period in the Basque Country. \"\u00c1lava se querella contra los responsables del fraude de Veleia\", El Pa\u00eds, 2009-03-25. It was alleged to contain the oldest known texts written in the Basque language as well as, allegedly, the oldest representation of the crucifixion of Jesus found to date, but later it was said that the findings were forgeries. \"Veleia: disparateen zerrenda\", Sustatu, 2008-11-20. \"Tres arque\u00f3logos abandonaron Veleia tras los hallazgos de 2006\", El Pa\u00eds, 2008-11-22. \"Iru\u00f1a-Veleia, culebr\u00f3n arqueol\u00f3gico\", El Pa\u00eds, 2008-12-06, Other authors favored their genuinely ancient provenance, in agreement with the stratigraphic dating performed by the archaeologists who made the discoveries. In June 2020 the archaeologist who had made the claims and two collaborators were found guilty of fraud and presenting false records. The court ruled that the artefacts had been altered \u201cwith contemporary incisions that were intended to suggest they contained inscriptions or markings of the same age as the objects themselves, and that they possessed a historical and cultural value of which they were devoid.\u201d The leader of the police investigation said that it had been \u201cone of the greatest falsifications or manipulations relating to archaeological materials from the Roman world\u201d.\" ==Chronology== ===Bronze and Iron ages=== The town was founded in the 8th century BC, in the Late Bronze Age. The houses from this period, rectangular and round with adobe walls and thatched roofs, are similar to those found at the nearby site of Atxa (Vitoria). ===Roman period=== In the first half of the 1st century some of these houses were replaced by others of Roman style (domus). This architectural romanization continued as the century advanced. The late Roman city (3rd and 4th centuries) is better known. It shows signs of decay and the construction of a wall that encloses an eleven hectare area. The town survived into the 5th century after Roman power had disappeared from the region, but by the end of the century only burial plots in abandoned buildings are found. ===Modern age=== There was an abbey at the site at least since the 16th century whose buildings remained visible until the mid 19th century. ==Sensational findings== ===Developments=== The Iru\u00f1a-Veleia site had been granted 3.72 million euros funding by the Basque regional government. In 2006, a series of sensational findings at Iru\u00f1a-Veleia were announced to the press by the director of the archaeological mission. These included what would have been the oldest non-onomastical texts in Basque, which were hailed as the first evidence of written Basque. Also, it was announced the discovery of a series of inscriptions and drawings on pottery fragments, some of which refer to Egyptian history and even some written in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Finally, it was announced the finding of the earliest representation of the Calvary (crucifixion of Jesus) found anywhere to date. \"Un maestro entre el Nilo y el Zadorra\", Diario de Noticias de \u00c1lava, 2006-06-09; \"En Veleia hubo alguien muy culto y de alto 'status', que dominaba la historia egipcia y sab\u00eda escribir jerogl\u00edficos\", El Pa\u00eds, 2006-06-09; \"Aparecen en Veleia restos de inscripciones en euskera del siglo III y de tem\u00e1tica cristiana\" , Noticias de \u00c1lava, 2006-06-09. Eventually, a committee of experts, the \"Comisi\u00f3n Cient\u00edfica Asesora\" (\"Scientific Advisory Committee\") was constituted by the provincial government of \u00c1lava to study the findings. The committee was originally made up of nine academics, all professors of the University of the Basque Country in Vitoria, along with three members of the provincial government of \u00c1lava, the director of the Provincial Museum of Archaeology, and the director of the excavation (Eliseo Gil), and was presided over by one of the members of the provincial government of \u00c1lava. Later others were added from Madrid, Italy and Britain. Alicia Canto, professor of classical archaeology and epigraphy at the Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, cast doubts over the capacity of such committee to elucidate the veracity of the sherd inscriptions based on linguistic grounds, as well as highlighting the contradictory positions shown by some of its members while noting that some claimed texts were \"beyond salvation\". At its fifth meeting on November 19, 2008, every report except that by Gil found problems with the so-called \"exceptionals\". The culture deputy of \u00c1lava, Lorena Lopez de la Callecase, dubbed the case the \"biggest archaeological fraud in the history of the Iberian Peninsula\", and demoted the chief technical official of the Archaeological Museum of \u00c1lava for her support to the authenticity of the findings. \"La Diputaci\u00f3n alavesa relega a Amelia Balde\u00f3n a un museo de segunda fila\", El Pa\u00eds, 2009-03-04. Ultimately, one of the members of the committee, Julio N\u00fa\u00f1ez, became the new director of the Iru\u00f1a-Veleia archaeological excavations. ===Forgery case=== The provincial government of Alava pursued legal actions against the alleged perpetrators of the supposed fraud. \"La Diputaci\u00f3n aporta al fiscal nuevas pruebas sobre el enga\u00f1o de Veleia. Una empresa alemana afirma que los gr\u00e1ficos aportados por Cerd\u00e1n para autentificar los hallazgos \u00abson una copia\u00bb de su manual\", El Correo, 2009-03-03. The sponsors of the project (Euskotren) also brought charges against the archaeological team, but the case was dismissed, and only the lawsuit filed by the provincial government of Alava remained in force. In June 2020 the perpetrators were found guilty of fraud and the production of false records. The court ruling stated that the artefacts had been modified \"with contemporary incisions that were intended to suggest they contained inscriptions or markings of the same age as the objects themselves, and that they possessed a historical and cultural value of which they were devoid.\u201d Soon after the verdict, Gil filed an appeal for acquittal and the prosecutor filed an appeal for a greater penalty. ==See also== * Basque language * Caristii * Autrigones * Ab Asturica Burdigalam (the Roman road that run through Veleia). * Glosas Emilianenses for the actual oldest text in Basque ==Bibliography== * Barandiaran, Alberto, Veleia afera, Elkar, 2010. * Elkin, Mike (2009): \"The Veleia Affair\" Archaeology Volume 62 Number 5, September/October 2009. * Iglesias, Hector (2009), \u00ab Les inscriptions de Veleia-Iru\u00f1a \u00bb {pdf} Les inscriptions de Veleia-Iru\u00f1a (version enti\u00e8rement revue et augment\u00e9e d'un index alphab\u00e9tique).
