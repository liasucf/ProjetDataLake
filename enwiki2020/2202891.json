Shortly afterward, they launched Brit and The Walking Dead at Image Comics. Although Moore ceased regular interior artist duties on The Walking Dead with #6, he continued to contribute to the title as cover artist through issue #24, and illustrated the covers for the series' first four collected volumes. Moore was nominated for two Eisner Awards for his work on The Walking Dead, (2004: \"Best New Series\",2004 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, the Comic Book Awards Almanac and 2005: Best Cover Artist.2005 Will Eisner Comic Industry Awards, the Comic Book Awards Almanac) Because of the popularity of the series, which increased considerably when it was adapted into a television series of the same name, Moore's original artwork for the series' early issues has gone up in value. On the March 28, 2013 episode of the VH1 reality television series For What It's Worth, Moore's original artwork for Page 7 of issue #1 was professionally appraised to be worth $20,000.\"Amoeba & John Azarian\".

Moore has since moved on to his own co-created properties, The Exterminators with Simon Oliver at DC/Vertigo, and Fear Agent with Rick Remender at Dark Horse Comics, and has contributed covers to numerous titles, including Claudio Sanchez's The Amory Wars and Rob Zombie's Spookshow International. He has also contributed to Marvel Comics' titles Ghost Rider (with Jason Aaron), and Punisher (with Rick Remender).

On February 9, 2012, Moore filed a lawsuit alleging that in 2005, writer Robert Kirkman deceitfully engineered him into surrendering his rights to The Walking Dead comic book and eventual TV series in exchange for payments that never materialized. Kirkman said in a statement the following day that he and Moore \"each had legal representation seven years ago and now he is violating the same contract he initiated and approved and he wants to misrepresent the fees he was paid and continues to be paid for the work he was hired to do.\" Kirkman in turn sued Moore. On September 24, 2012, the two released a joint statement saying they had reached a settlement \"to everyone's mutual satisfaction.\" ==Bibliography== Interior comic work includes: *Battle Pope #1-5, 8, 10-13 (with Robert Kirkman, Funk-O-Tron, 2000\u20132002) *Kieron Dwyer's LCD #3: \"Lockdown Laffs\" (script and art, anthology, FogelComix, 2002) *9-11 Volume 1: \"Untitled\" (with Robert Kirkman, anthology graphic novel, Dark Horse, 2002) *Masters of the Universe: Icons of Evil \u2014 Beast Man (with Robert Kirkman, one-shot, MVCreations, 2003) *Brit and Brit: Cold Death (with Robert Kirkman, one-shots, Image, 2003) *The Walking Dead #1-6 (with Robert Kirkman, Image, 2003\u20132004) *Fear Agent (with Rick Remender): ** \"Re-Ignition\" (with Jerome Ope\u00f1a, in #1-4, Image, 2005\u20132006) ** Fear Agent: The Last Goodbye #1-4 (Dark Horse, 2007) ** \"I Against I\" (in #22-27, Dark Horse, 2008\u20132009) ** \"Out of Step\" (with Mike Hawthorne, in #28-32, Dark Horse, 2010\u20132011) *Western Tales of Terror #5: \"Know When to Hold 'em\" (with Matty Field, anthology, Hoarse and Buggy, 2005) *24Seven Volume 1: \"Fear and Loathing in NYC\" (with Jonathan L.
