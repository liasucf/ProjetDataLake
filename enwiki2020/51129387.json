Once again, Tony Hernando and Roland Grapow acted as producers and mixing and mastering were done by Roland Grapow at Grapow Studios in Slovakia. \"II\" featured a combination of classic rock and heavy metal with progressive elements. Guitarist Tony Hernando commented that their live shows had influenced the direction they took in writing the album. The band was able to tour non stop for more than a year, opening for other artists such Axel Rudi Pell in September 2016. Lords Of Black closed 2016 with their first show in Japan at Loud Park Festival and another European Tour as headliners of \"Merciless Over Europe Tour\" in fall of 2016, with intentions to begin writing and producing a follow up album afterwards. === Icons Of The New Days (2018) and Alchemy of Souls, Pt.
