    "text": "The 2008 AFL Under 18 Championships is the 2008 series of the AFL Under 18 Championships, a state and territory based Australian rules football competition which showcase the best junior footballers in Australia, primarily with the aim for them to be drafted into the Australian Football League. The competition is split into two divisions. The major football states of Victoria (split into separate Country and Metropolitan teams), South Australia and Western Australia are in Division 1, with the smaller football states of Northern Territory, NSW/ACT, Tasmania and Queensland are in Division 2. Unlike previous years, in 2008 the top two teams from the Division 2 competition advanced to be part of Division 1. Division 2 games were played as a qualifying series over a week in May in Melbourne, whereas Division 1 will be played mainly as curtain-raisers before AFL matches in late May and early June. ==Division 2 qualifying series== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
