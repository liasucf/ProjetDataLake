    "text": "Abdufatto Tashpulatovich Zamanov (born April 7, 1973 in Tajikistan), known as the \"Krasnoyarsk Chikatilo\", is a Tajik-born Russian serial killer. Between June 2002 and November 2004, he killed 9 men and 5 women in Krasnoyarsk and its suburbs on the basis of personal hostility, also raping two girls aged between 12 and 16. == Biography == Zamanov was born in Tajikistan, but since 1993 he has lived in Krasnoyarsk. He killed his victims in suburban areas, in public gardens, near cafes and roads, with the first murder committed at a cemetery. \"At the same time he used knives and household items\", the press release said. The bloodiest of the attacks occurred in November 2004, when he murdered five women in a village in the Mansky District. Zamanov killed them with the help of improvised weaponry. In all cases, the criminal fled the scene, taking all valuables and gold jewelry from the victims. In addition, the investigation found that Zamanov, who was living in the Beryozovsky District, had been in sexual relations with two sisters who were minors. Zamanov was characterized by his unpredictability and extreme cruelty - 6 of the 14 murders he committed all in one day. As a murder weapon, he used improvised items - stones, knives, victims' clothing. He never planned the murders and attacked at random, laughing at his victims while abusing them (especially the women). Zamanov's motive is quite rare - resentment, anger and a strong and sudden irrational hatred for the victims. Rape was only an additional motive and did not always take place. Zamanov's last killing spree was the 6 murders in one day, which occurred in a summer cottage. Witnesses were able to described a man of Asian appearance, and the militsiya had the opportunity to make a facial composite, indicating important features. Meanwhile, the killer's talkativeness caught up to him - he told about the murders to his female partner, who filed a complaint to the authorities. He resisted during his arrest. He did not admit guilt even at the trial, continuing to claim that he was provoked in each case. In 2006, he was sentenced to 25 years in prison. However, the relatives of the victims and the regional prosecutor's office appealed this decision. In 2008, he was sentenced to life imprisonment by the court, which he will serve in a special regime colony. All instances of the verdict remained unchanged.\u0412 \u041a\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043d\u043e\u044f\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0440\u043d\u043e \u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0438\u043b\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u043d\u044c\u044f\u043a\u0430 \u0417\u0430\u043c\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0430: 14 \u0442\u0440\u0443\u043f\u043e\u0432, 2 \u0438\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0439 Zamanov is serving his sentence in the Polar Owl colony in the Yamalo-Nenets Autonomous Okrug. === In the media === * Documentary film \"Savage\", from the series \"Crime Chronicles\" ==See also== * List of Russian serial killers == References == == External links == * Krasnoyarsk maniac, who killed 14 people, sentenced to life Category:Russian rapists Category:Russian people convicted of child sexual abuse Category:People from Krasnoyarsk Krai Category:1973 births Category:Russian serial killers Category:Male serial killers Category:Living people Category:Tajikistani emigrants to Russia ",
