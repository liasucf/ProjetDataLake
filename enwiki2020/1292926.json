    "text": "Nine Tonight is a live album by American rock band Bob Seger & The Silver Bullet Band, released in 1981 (see 1981 in music). The album was recorded at Cobo Hall in Detroit, Michigan, in June 1980 and at the Boston Garden in Boston, Massachusetts in October 1980. With the exception of three tracks - \"Nine Tonight\", \"Tryin' To Live My Life Without You\" and \"Let It Rock\" - the album is composed entirely of songs drawn from Seger's three previous studio albums. Only \"Let It Rock\" was repeated from the previous live album Live Bullet. \"Tryin' to Live My Life Without You\" was a U.S. top 5 pop hit, peaking at #5. The album's title track was originally recorded for the Urban Cowboy soundtrack album. The 2011 remastered album has a bonus track called \"Brave Strangers\", which was originally released on his 1978 album Stranger in Town. This live version was originally released as the B-side of the \"Tryin' to Live My Life Without You\" live single. On release of the 2011 remastered version, fans were disappointed that it did not restore the full 10:30 version of \"Let It Rock\". __NOTOC__ ==Track listing== Track times based upon 2011 remaster.
