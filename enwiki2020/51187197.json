Van Hoeij praises the actors Hofmann and Sch\u00fcmann, who portrayed those two boys in an affectionate and tender way, which is as interesting as the fact that those teenagers have to question themselves, due to their sexuality, if they are ever going to be happy. However, van Hoeij also noted that because of the focus on those two characters, others like Kat and Diane felt like they were neither protagonists nor side characters.Boyd van Hoeij: 'Center of My World' ('Die Mitte der Welt'): Munich Review In: The Hollywood Reporter, 7. Juli 2016. ===Reaction in Russia=== On the verge of the press conference in the course of the premiere in Moscow, the film was rejected by some journalists and critics as propaganda as non-traditional portrayal of sexual relationships between teenagers that are not allowed to be distributed in Russia. Kirill Raslogow, the program director of the film festival, had warned his fellow countrymen beforehand: \"This movie could shock the audience.\" The Austria Presse Agentur (APA) described the problem of the film in Russia: \"With this portrayal of society, the director reproduces a downright nightmare of right- conservative Russians who often disqualify Europe as 'Gayrope'.\"Ein schwuler Jugendlicher begeistert Moskau In: Austria Presse Agentur (zitiert in futter.), 27 June 2016. Russian film critic Andrej Plachow, who is in charge of the selection panel of the Moscow film festival, explained: \"I fear that there will be barely any companies in Russia that want to distribute this movie. They understand that they would get into trouble.\" However, the film received a surprisingly positive response by the audience in Moscow.Ohne Schock nahm Moskau Jakob M.
