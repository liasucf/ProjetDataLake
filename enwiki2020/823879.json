His father, Reverend Walter Frear, was born in Poughkeepsie, New York August 16, 1828, graduated from Yale in 1851, came to the Kingdom of Hawaii as a missionary, and then lived in California when he was born. His mother was Frances Elmira Foster. The family returned to Honolulu in 1870, where his father was pastor of the Fort Street Church until 1881. He graduated from Punahou School in 1881, Yale with a B.A. in 1885, and Yale law school in 1890. On August 1, 1893 he married Mary Emma Dillingham, the daughter of industrialist Benjamin Dillingham. They had two daughters: Virginia (1900\u2013?) and Margaret (1908\u2013?). He was appointed as circuit judge on January 1, 1893 by Queen Liliuokalani. On March 7, 1893 he was promoted to serve on the Supreme Court of the Provisional Government. After the death of Albert Francis Judd, on July 5, 1900 he became Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of what was then the Territory of Hawaii. Frear was appointed governor after George R. Carter by President Theodore Roosevelt on August 15, 1907. Alfred S. Hartwell replaced him as Chief Justice. He was a member of the Republican Party of Hawaii. After the election of Woodrow Wilson, Frear was replaced by the first governor from the Democratic Party of Hawaii, Lucius Pinkham in November 1913. He died January 22, 1948 in Honolulu, Hawaii. The Frears founded the Mary D. and Walter F. Frear Eleemosynary Trust to sponsor educational projects. Frear Hall, a dormitory building built in the 1950s on the University of Hawaii at Manoa campus, was named after Governor Frear's wife Mary Dillingham Frear, a member of the University's Board of Regents from 1920\u20131943. The aging structure was demolished in 2006, to make way for a new dorm facility also called Frear Hall completed in the Summer of 2008. The Frear home, known as \u201cArcadia,\u201d was located at 1434 Punahou Street. It was built in 1907. Upon Mary's 1951 death it was donated to Punahou School. The property is currently occupied by Arcadia, a retirement residence. The Frear Center, located at 1132 Bishop Street, was named after Walter and Mary Frear. It is a classroom building of Hawaii Pacific University, and was designed for information systems and computer science courses. The trust also supported Chaminade University of Honolulu. ==Personal Life== Frear's father passed away on May 25, 1922 in Oakland, California.
