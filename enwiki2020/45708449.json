    "text": "Ivan Nalimov (born August 12, 1994) is a Russian professional ice hockey goaltender. He is currently playing with the Rockford IceHogs of the American Hockey League (AHL). He was drafted in the 6th round, 179th overall, in the 2014 NHL Entry Draft by the Chicago Blackhawks. ==Playing career== Nalimov was selected by SKA Saint Petersburg in the first round (12th overall) of the 2011 KHL Junior Draft. He made his Kontinental Hockey League debut during the 2014\u201315 KHL season with Admiral Vladivostok. In the 2017\u201318 season, Nailmov appeared in 17 games with Vladivostok before he was traded, as the club fell out of playoff contention, to Salavat Yulaev Ufa on December 27, 2017. On August 6, 2018, Nalimov joined his fourth KHL club in signing a one-year deal as a free agent with Chinese outfit, Kunlun Red Star. In the 2018\u201319 season, Nalimov made four appearances with the Red Star before he was traded to Avangard Omsk. After impressing in his short stint with Avangard, on 13 July 2019, Nalimov was returned in a trade to original draft club, SKA Saint Petersburg, in exchange for fellow goaltending prospect, Ivan Prosvetov. With the 2019\u201320 season underway, before making his season debut, Nalimov continued his journeyman career in the KHL as he was again traded by SKA to HC Sochi on 8 October 2019. He made 24 appearances with Sochi, posting a .911 save percentage unable to help propel the club to the post-season. Nalimov extended his season in North America by signing a professional try-out contract with the Rockford IceHogs of the AHL, the primary affiliate to the Chicago Blackhawks, on 7 March 2020. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:Admiral Vladivostok players Category:Avangard Omsk players Category:Chicago Blackhawks draft picks Category:HC Kunlun Red Star players Category:Russian ice hockey goaltenders Category:Salavat Yulaev Ufa players Category:HC Sibir Novosibirsk players Category:HC Sochi players Category:Sportspeople from Moscow ",
