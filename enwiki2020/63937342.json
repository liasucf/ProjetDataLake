    "text": "Vote McGovern, also known as Vote McGovern, 1972, is a colored lithograph by Andy Warhol. He produced it in support of George McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign. The print depicts a photograph of then-President of the United States Richard Nixon with his face dyed green and blue, and with his jacket and tie dyed pink and red, respectively. It was Warhol's first political poster and has been described as Warhol's \"most overtly political work\". The photograph of Nixon on which the print is based was taken from a photograph of him and his wife Pat Nixon on the cover of Newsweek; Warhol chose the colors used to dye Nixon's face based on those of Mrs. Nixon's dress. Art critic Jonathan Jones described the print as follows: \"Nixon's face is acidic green, colliding shockingly with an orange background, almost like classical Indian art in its chromatic intensity. It captures the way Nixon in the flesh looked like a cartoon, his head too big for his body. But that's all in the way of satire.\" In 2016, it was featured in a printmaking exhibition at the British Museum. ==References== ==External links== *Entry at British Museum website Category:Lithographs Category:Cultural depictions of Richard Nixon Category:Art by Andy Warhol Category:1972 works Category:Prints and drawings in the British Museum Category:Prints (art) ",
