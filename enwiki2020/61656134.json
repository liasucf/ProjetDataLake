    "text": "Closeup map of historical Yawelmani distribution Yawelmani Yokuts (also spelled Yowlumne and Yauelmani) is an endangered dialect of Southern Valley Yokuts historically spoken by the Yokuts living along the Kern River north of Kern Lake in the Central Valley of California. Today, most Yawelmani speakers live on or near the Tule River Reservation. == Name == Academic sources frequently use the name \"Yawelmani\" while referring to the language, though tribe members more often use the name \"Yowlumne.\" When referencing their language, modern speakers of Yawelmani use the terms \"inyana\" (Indian), and \"yaw'lamnin \u1e6deexil\" (speech of the Yowlumne). ==Phonology== ===Consonants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! ! !Bilabial !Dental !Retroflex !Palatal !Velar !Glottal |- align=\"center\" !rowspan=3|Stop !plain | p | t | \u1e6d | | k | \u02bc |- align=\"center\" !aspirated | ph | th | \u1e6dh | | kh | |- align=\"center\" !ejective | p\u02bc | t\u02bc | \u1e6d\u02bc | | k\u02bc | |- align=\"center\" !rowspan=3|Affricate !plain | | c | | \u010d | | |- align=\"center\" !aspirated | | ch | | \u010dh | | |- align=\"center\" !ejective | | c\u02bc | | \u010d\u02bc | | |- align=\"center\" !colspan=\"2\"|Fricative | | s | \u1e63 | | x | h |- align=\"center\" !rowspan=2|Nasal ! plain | m | n | | | | |- align=\"center\" !glottalized | m\u02bc | n\u02bc | | | | |- align=\"center\" ! rowspan=2|Approximant ! plain | w | l | | y | | |- align=\"center\" !glottalized | w\u02bc | l\u02bc | | y\u02bc | | |} ===Vowels=== Yawelmani has 8 vowel phonemes: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! colspan=\"2\" | Unrounded ! colspan=\"2\" | Rounded |- ! short ! long ! short ! long |- ! High | | | | |- ! Non-high | | | | |} * There are 4 short-long vowel pairs. * Short high vowels may become more centralized in fast speech: , . * Long high vowels are almost always lower than their short counterparts: , . * All long vowels may be shortened by a phonological process. Thus, a single long vowel has two different phonetic realizations: ** , ** , ** , ** . * Note that the high long vowel is usually pronounced the same as and . As can be seen, Yawelmani vowels have a number of different realizations (phones) which are summarized below: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! rowspan=\"2\" | ! colspan=\"2\" | Front ! colspan=\"2\" | Back |- ! short ! long ! short ! long |- ! High | | | | |- ! Near-high | | | | |- ! Mid | | | | |- ! Low | | | | |} ===Syllable & phonotactics=== The Yawelmani syllables can be either a consonant-vowel sequence (CV), such as deeyi- 'lead', or a consonant-vowel-consonant sequence (CVC), such as xata- 'eat'. Thus the generalized syllable is the following: : CV(C) Word roots are bisyllabic and have either one of two shapes: * CV.CV * CV.CVC ===Phonological processes=== ====Vowel shortening==== When long vowels are in closed syllables, they are shortened: :{| | | \u2192 | | p\u0313axaat\u0315it | 'mourn (passive aorist)' | ( remains long) |- | | \u2192 | | p\u0313axat\u0315hin | 'mourn (aorist)' | ( is shortened) |- | | \u2192 | | c\u0313uyoohun | 'urinate (aorist)' | ( remains long) |- | | \u2192 | | c\u0313uyot | 'urinate (passive aorist)' | ( is shortened) |} ====Vowel harmony==== Yawelmani has suffixes that contain either an underspecified high vowel or an underspecified non-high vowel . * Underspecified will appear as following the high rounded vowel and as following all other vowels : :{| | | | | -hun/-hin | (aorist suffix) |- | | \u2192 | | mu\u1e6dhun | 'swear (aorist)' |- | | \u2192 | | giy\u0313hin | 'touch (aorist)' |- | | \u2192 | | gophin | 'take care of infant (aorist)' |- | | \u2192 | | xathin | 'eat (aorist)' |} * Underspecified will appear as following the non-high rounded vowel and as following all other vowels : :{| | | | | -tow/-taw | (nondirective gerundial suffix) |- | | \u2192 | | goptow | 'take care of infant (nondir. ger.)' |- | | \u2192 | | giy\u0313taw | 'touch (nondir. ger.)' |- | | \u2192 | | mu\u1e6dtaw | 'swear (nondir. ger.)' |- | | \u2192 | | xattaw | 'eat (nondir. ger.)' |} ====Vowel epenthesis==== Yawelmani adds vowels to stems, when suffixes with an initial consonant are affixed to word with two final consonants in order to avoid a triple-consonant-cluster. == Grammar == === Case system === Yawelmani is a primary object language. A. L. Krober documented the language's case system in his 1907 paper The Yokuts language of south central California. {| class=\"wikitable\" |+Case suffixes (per Kroeber) | rowspan=\"3\" |Objective |Noun | -a (i) |- |Demonstrative | -n, -in |- |(plural), Pronoun | -wa |- |Possessive | | -in |- |Instrumental | |ni |- |Locative | |u |- |Ablative | |nit |} == Speakers == A 2011 estimate by Victor Golla placed the number of fluent and semi-fluent Yawelmani speakers at \"up to twenty-five\" == Revitalization efforts == In 1993, the Master-Apprentice Language Learning Program piloted a series of language programs that included Yawelmani. The program was reportedly effective in teaching conversational Yawelmani to tribal members without prior knowledge and increasing language use among elders. == Selected vocabulary == File:Yowlumne body parts.svg|Yawelmani anatomy File:Yawelmani kinship.svg|Yawelmani kinship terms == References == == External links == * English/Yowlumne dictionary *Yowlum'nen Trexul: Yowlumne phrase and lesson book Category:Endangered Yokutsan languages ",
