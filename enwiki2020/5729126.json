Anu, a Torres Strait Islander, changed some lyrics to reflect her circumstances.Undercover \"Christine Anu interview\" e.g.: Rather than moving to the desert, she compares island life to the city life, and from the point of view of a woman. In the music video, it intercedes between her singing, and an Aboriginal man deciding to drop his job as a janitor, and start running through the city, the desert, and finally to the ocean. When he gets there, he swims to his home island and waves at his kid and wife. At the 1995 APRA Awards, \"My Island Home\" won Song of the Year. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1995, \"Island Home\" was nominated for ARIA Award for Song of the Year, but lost to \"Chains\" by Tina Arena.

Anu performed the song at the closing ceremony of the 2000 Summer Olympics and at opening ceremony of the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney.

Anu re-recorded the song for her second album Come My Way in 2001, subtitled \"Earth Beat\" version, which removed the echoed effects during the choruses, but added subtle synth effects and more prominent guitar during the song, making it sound more rhythmic and polished, whereas the original was driven more with a drum beat.
