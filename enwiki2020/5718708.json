In 1979, 25 years after the first factory establishment, DYO and DYOSAD in Turkey had become bigger than the domestic paint and ink activities in Denmark of Sadolin & Holmblad \u2013 in terms of both net revenue, net profit and number of employees.

Since Sadolin & Holmblad during these years was a multinational group with more manufacturing operations on more than 60 sites in over 40 countries (until the group were integrated into AkzoNobel), the Sadolin family's direct involvement in DYO and DYOSAD was rather unusual. == Ya\u015far-BASF Otomotive Boya == In 1992, DYOSAD sold its automotive refreshing to Ya\u015far Holding, which made a joint venture with the German chemical group BASF regarding automotive refinishes, and Ya\u015far-BASF Otomotive Boya was founded becoming a 100% owner.
