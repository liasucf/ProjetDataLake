    "text": "You Can't Stop the Murders is a 2003 Australian comedy film directed by Anthony Mir and written by and starring Mir, Gary Eck and Akmal Saleh. ==Plot== The plot revolves around a series of Village People-themed murders in a small town, and the police who investigate the crimes. The title is a satirical reference to the 1980 film Can't Stop the Music, in which the Village People star. Eck and Saleh play two police constables in a rural village, 'Gary' and 'Akmal' who lead fairly unremarkable lives. Gary's main aim is to be crowned line dancing champion of the village, having always been the runner-up. However, a series of horrific murders, involving the mutilation of bodies, rock the town, and 'Tony' (Mir), a detective from the city, is called in reluctantly to investigate. Whilst the young Akmal is in awe of the dashing detective, Tony's aggressive methods clash with the uptight Gary, and 'Chief Carter' (Richard Carter), the officer in charge of the station. Tony is eventually sent back to the city, after shooting a French male stripper. Gary and Akmal soon discover that the murders have a Village People theme, with those murdered having been in one of the occupations of a Village Person, or resembling one. They fearfully deduce that either a policeman or a dentist (Akmal is uncertain, as he doesn't clearly remember the Village People, although Gary quickly deduces that it is, in fact, a policeman) will be next to die, as does Tony, who rushes back from the city. ==Production== The film stars a number of Australian stand-up comedians including Jimeoin, Bob Franklin, The Umbilical Brothers, Kitty Flanagan, Garry Who, Haskel Daniel, Richard Carter, The Dickster, Rash Ryder, Kenny Graham and Sandman. ==Box office== You Can't Stop the Murders grossed $254,871 at the box office in Australia.Film Victoria - Australian Films at the Australian Box Office ==See also== *Cinema of Australia ==References== ==External links== * * You Cant Stop The Murders at the National Film and Sound Archive Category:2003 films Category:2000s crime comedy films Category:2000s comedy thriller films Category:Australian films Category:Australian comedy films Category:Cultural depictions of the Village People Category:Films about murder Category:Films set in Australia Category:Films shot in Australia Category:2003 comedy films ",
