The Embassy of India in Dakar, Senegal is concurrently accredited to The Gambia, the only Anglophone country accredited to that mission. India also maintains an Honorary Consulate General in Banjul. ==History== Relations between The Gambia and India were very limited until 1985, consisting only of a confirmation of their common non-aligned principles, and common position on decolonisation and North-South issues. Prior to 1985, The Gambia maintained limited diplomatic ties with Asian countries, primarily focusing on countries such as Taiwan, China, South Korea and North Korea, from which it sought aid in exchange for political support. The Gambia co-sponsored a resolution moved by India at the UN General Assembly in January 2015, to declare 21 June as International Yoga Day. Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi visited The Gambia in September 2015 as the Prime Minister's Special Envoy and officially invited the country to participate in the third India Africa Forum Summit (IAFS).

Addressing the IAFS delegates, Njie-Saidy described India as a \"genuine friend\" and \"brotherly country\", and described its contribution to sustainable development in Gambia and Africa as \"remarkable\". She praised the bilateral co-operation between the two countries calling it \"a flourishing partnership that remained a strong strategic mutual benefit to both sides\". Njie-Saidy stated, \"The Gambia and India have common interest in international affairs and sometimes share common points of view on international issues. The level of cooperation between Gambia and India at the international scene is very much encouraging especially at the level of the United Nations.\" She added that The Gambia continues to \"enjoy immense support and assistance\" from the Indian government, and that India's intervention in Africa had led to national development and improvements in the lives of the African people. Njie-Saidy also held closed door bilateral talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Hyderabad House on 30 October. Gambian Health and Social Welfare minister Omar Sey visited India in November 2015 and participated in the 2015 India-Africa Business forum.
