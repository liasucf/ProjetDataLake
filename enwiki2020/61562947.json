    "text": "Aimee Stephens (December 7, 1960 \u2013 May 12, 2020) was an American funeral director known for her fight for civil rights for transgender people. She worked as a funeral director in Detroit and was fired for being transgender. Based on her court case, in a historic 2020 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees from discrimination based on sex. ==Early life and education== Stephens was born on December 7, 1960 in Fayetteville, N.C. She graduated from Mars Hill University in 1984 with a degree in religious education and obtained a degree in mortuary science from Fayetteville Technical Community College in 1988. == R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Homes Inc. v. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission == Stephens was fired from her job at R.G. & G.R. Harris Funeral Home in Garden City in 2013 after she said she would wear appropriate women's business attire at work. Stephens started a legal case, arguing that she was protected under Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964. The funeral home owner argued that since he would have required everyone to dress according to the gender they had been biologically assigned at birth, he hadn't discriminated against her. Justice Neil Gorsuch who argued for the LGBTQ+ community acknowledged that \"Congress in 1964 likely did not have the LGBTQ community in mind when it banned discrimination based on sex. But he said the words of the statute are clear.\" ==Personal life== She was married to Donna Stephens for 20 years. ==Death and legacy== Stephens died from complications related to kidney failure on May 12, 2020. In June 2020, Stephens was added among American \u201cpioneers, trailblazers, and heroes\u201d on the National LGBTQ Wall of Honor within the Stonewall National Monument (SNM) in New York City\u2019s Stonewall Inn. The SNM is the first U.S. national monument dedicated to LGBTQ rights and history. == References == Category:2020 deaths Category:1960 births Category:Transgender and transsexual women Category:People from Fayetteville, North Carolina Category:People from Garden City, Michigan Category:LGBT people from North Carolina Category:LGBT people from Michigan Category:LGBT rights activists from the United States Category:Activists from North Carolina Category:Activists from Michigan Category:Mars Hill University alumni Category:Deaths from kidney failure Category:Funeral directors ",
