In 2000, after Marit Berger took over as editor, it was relaunched in a magazine format under the name Xtra. Following the strong showing by the Conservative Party in the 2005 parliamentary election, which led to lower state aid, some annual issues started being published online. The publication was sued for unauthorized use of a cover photo in 2007 and had to pay a \u20ac5980 fine.
