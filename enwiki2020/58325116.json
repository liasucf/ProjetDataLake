    "text": "The following inequality is known as Sedrakyan's inequality, Engel's form or Titu's lemma, respectively, referring to the article \u201cAbout the applications of one useful inequality\u201d of Nairi Sedrakyan published in 1997, to the book Problem-solving strategies of Arthur Engel (mathematician) published in 1998 and to the book Mathematical Olympiad Treasures of Titu Andreescu published in 2003. It is a direct consequence of Cauchy-Bunyakovsky-Schwarz inequality. Nevertheless, in his article (1997) Sedrakyan has noticed that written in this form this inequality can be used as a mathematical proof technique and it has very useful new applications. In the book Algebraic Inequalities (Sedrakyan) are provided several generalizations of this inequality. == Statement of the inequality (Nairi Sedrakyan (1997), Arthur Engel (mathematician) (1998), Titu Andreescu (2003)) == For any reals a_1, a_2, a_3,\\ldots, a_n and positive reals b_1, b_2, b_3,\\ldots, b_n , we have \\frac{a^2_1}{b_1}+\\frac{a^2_2}{b_2}+\\cdots+\\frac{a^2_n}{b_n} \\geq \\frac{(a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n)^2}{b_1 + b_2 +\\cdots+ b_n}. == Direct applications == Example 1. Nesbitt's inequality. For positive real numbers a,b,c we have that \\frac{a}{b+c}+\\frac{b}{a+c}+\\frac{c}{a+b} \\geq \\frac{3}{2}. Example 2. International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) 1995. For positive real numbers a,b,c , where abc=1 we have that \\frac{1}{a^3(b+c)}+\\frac{1}{b^3(b+c)}+\\frac{1}{c^3(a+b)} \\geq \\frac{3}{2}. Example 3. For positive real numbers a,b we have that 8(a^4+b^4) \\geq (a+b)^4. Example 4. For positive real numbers a,b,c we have that \\frac{1}{a+b}+\\frac{1}{b+c}+\\frac{1}{a+c} \\geq \\frac{9}{2(a+b+c)}. == Proofs == Example 1. We have that \\frac{a}{b+c}+\\frac{b}{a+c}+\\frac{c}{a+b} = \\frac{a^2}{a(b+c)}+\\frac{b^2}{b(a+c)}+\\frac{c^2}{c(a+b)} \\geq \\frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2(ab+bc+ac)} \\geq \\frac{3}{2}. Example 2. We have that \\frac{\\Big(\\frac{1}{a}\\Big)^2}{a(b+c)} + \\frac{\\Big(\\frac{1}{b}\\Big)^2}{b(a+c)} + \\frac{\\Big(\\frac{1}{c}\\Big)^2}{c(a+b)} \\geq \\frac{\\Big(\\frac{1}{a}+\\frac{1}{b}+\\frac{1}{c}\\Big)^2}{2(ab+bc+ac)} = \\frac{ab+bc+ac}{2} \\geq \\frac{3 \\sqrt[3]{a^2 b^2 c^2}}{2} = \\frac{3}{2}. Example 3. We have that a^4+b^4 =\\frac{a^4}{1}+\\frac{b^4}{1} \\geq \\frac{(a^2+b^2)^2}{2} \\geq \\frac{\\Big( \\frac{(a+b)^2}{2} \\Big)^2}{2} = \\frac{(a+b)^4}{8}. Example 4. We have that \\frac{1}{a+b}+\\frac{1}{b+c}+\\frac{1}{a+c} \\geq \\frac{(1+1+1)^2}{2(a+b+c)} = \\frac{9}{2(a+b+c)}. ==References== Category:Inequalities Category:Linear algebra Category:Operator theory Category:Articles containing proofs Category:Mathematical analysis Category:Probabilistic inequalities ",
