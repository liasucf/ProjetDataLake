    "text": "The Tinayguk River is a tributary of the North Fork Koyukuk River in the U.S. state of Alaska. Heading in the Endicott Mountains of the Brooks Range, the river flows generally west then south to meet the larger river about north of Bettles. In 1980, the entire river was designated \"wild\" and added to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System. The designation means that the Tinayguk is unpolluted, free-flowing and generally inaccessible except by trail and that its watershed is essentially primitive. The river's name means Moose in Inupiat. In 1930, forester Robert \"Bob\" Marshall recommended it as an alternative to West Fork, a local name that Marshall considered over-used. ==Boating== Although whitewater enthusiasts sometimes run the river in small rafts or inflatable canoes or kayaks, it is remote, hazardous, and difficult to reach. It is a small one-channel river that drops over its first and an average of over the rest of its course. The upper reaches are rated Class III (difficult) on the International Scale of River Difficulty, while the rest of the river varies between Class II (medium) and Class III. Hazards include swift current, shallow water, sharp bends, logjams, boulders, and aufeis. ==See also== *List of National Wild and Scenic Rivers *List of rivers of Alaska ==References== Category:Rivers of Alaska Category:Rivers of Yukon\u2013Koyukuk Census Area, Alaska Category:Gates of the Arctic National Park and Preserve Category:Wild and Scenic Rivers of the United States Category:Rivers of Unorganized Borough, Alaska ",
