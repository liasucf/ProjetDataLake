They often are an elite unit of the regular armed forces, or are designated as such, and may maintain special rights or privileges. ==Institution and tasks== Ernst Rudolf The Palace Guard Royal guards have historically comprised both purely ceremonial units serving in close proximity to the monarch, as well as regiments from all arms, forming a designated substantial elite and intended for active service as part of the army. An example of the first category would include the Tropas de la Casa Real of the Spanish monarchy prior to 1930, comprising halberderos and a mounted escort. Examples of the second would include the Imperial Guards of the Russian and German Empires prior to 1917-18.Jos\u00e9 M. Bueno, El Ej\u00e9rcito de Alfonso XIII - Tropas de la Casa Real, Monarchs frequently modeled their royal guards upon those of fellow rulers. Thus, Napoleon I's Garde Imperiale was imitated by his opponent Alexander I of Russia, his Bourbon successor Louis XVIII and his nephew Napoleon III. The modern Garderegiment Grenadiers en Jagers regiment of the Netherlands and the Escorte Royale of Belgium retain features of uniform and other distinctions that can be traced back to Napoleonic influences.Philip Mason, Pillars of Monarchy, ==Political importance== Because of their location, status, role and nature, royal guards have frequently been able to play a political role beyond their intended military and social ones. In times of revolution, the continued loyalty or defection of such units has often played a key part in the outcome of wider unrest. Historical examples were England in 1688, Spain in 1808, Sweden in 1809, France in 1789 and again in 1814-15, Russia in 1917 and Persia in 1906 and again in 1953.Philip Mason, page 167 Pillars of Monarchy, ==List of royal guards== ===Past=== Royal Guards in Baroda The French Guards at Fontenoy in 1745. * Mesedi, in the Hittite Empire * Medjay, since the old kingdom of Egypt until the Ptolemaic dynasty * Somatophylakes, in the ancient Kingdom of Macedonia * Imperial Guard, in the Achaemenid Empire of Persia * Praetorian Guard, in the Roman Empire * Jovians and Herculians, in late Roman Empire and early Byzantine Empire * J\u00ecn J\u016bn, in the Tang Dynasty of China * Sh\u00ecw\u00e8i, in the Qing Dynasty of China * Manchukuo Imperial Guards, in Manchukuo * Excubitors, Spatharii, Hetaireia, Paramonai and the Varangian Guard, in the Byzantine Empire * Monaspa, in the Kingdom of Georgia * Tobang, in the Goryeo Dynasty of Korea * Naegeumwi, in the Joseon Dynasty of Korea * ValaShahis, in Mughal Empire * Kheshig, in the Mongol Empire * Walloon Guards, in Spain; recruited from the Spanish Netherlands * Spanish Guards (Gardes Espagnoles), an infantry regiment brigaded with the Walloon Guards but recruited within Spain itself. * Maison militaire du roi de France (to which belonged the Swiss Guards and the French Guards), in the Kingdom of France * Leyb-gvardiya, in the Russian Empire * Imperial Guard, in Napoleon I's First French Empire * Imperial Guard, in Napoleon III's Second French Empire * Royal Foot Guard, in the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth * Leibgarde der Hartschier, in the Kingdom of Bavaria * Garde Du Corps, in Prussia, and later in the German Empire * Noble Guard and Palatine Guard, in the Holy See until 1970 * Corazzieri, in the Kingdom of Italy * Personal Cavalry Convoy, in the Principality of Bulgaria and Kingdom of Bulgaria * Arci\u00e8ren-Leibgarde (Lifeguard of Halberdiers), in the Austro-Hungarian Empire 1700-1918 * Trabanten Leibgarde (Gentlemen at Arms), in the Austro-Hungarian Empire until 1918 * Hofburgwache (Palace Bodyguard) in the Austrian Empire.
