    "text": "Andromeda Attumasen is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character is an Atlantean of Marvel's shared universe, known as the Marvel Universe. She is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma == Publication history == Andromeda was introduced in The Defenders #143 (March 1985) and added to the titular supergroup's lineup just a few issues later. Writer Peter B. Gillis later revealed, \"My long-term plan was to populate the Defenders with my own crew of characters, characters who nonetheless had ties to interesting parts of the Marvel Universe. Andromeda, while not the Sub-Mariner, gave me a connection to Atlantis.\" However, Andromeda would be the last character Gillis added to the Defenders, since shortly after her debut he was told that the series was being cancelled. ==Fictional character biography== A member of the Homo mermanus race, Andromeda is the illegitimate daughter of Attuma of Atlantis by a woman named Lady Gelva. He did not know of her existence until she confronted him and told him he was her father.Iron Man Annual #10. Marvel Comics. Andromeda was raised in Atlantean society and trained in the arts of hunting and war and she exceeded any other male except for her father in these skills. Despite her skills, she was considered unworthy of promotion in the Atlantean military because she is a woman even though she was highly decorated.Defenders #149. Marvel Comics. Andromeda, inspired by Namor's tales, moved to the surface world, where she used a serum to give herself a human appearance and the ability to breathe out of water. She took the name Andrea McPhee and posed as a surface woman.Defenders #143. Marvel Comics. When she was revealed as an Atlantean, she quickly abandoned her charade and became a member of the Defenders, joining them against a villain named Hotspur.Defenders #146-147. Marvel Comics. She was with the Defenders, christened the \"New Defenders,\" for only a short time, revealing only portions of her background to them.Defenders #149. Marvel Comics. With them, she traveled to outer space and battled the second Star-Thief.Defenders #150. Marvel Comics. She fought Manslaughter as he menaced the team,Defenders #151. Marvel Comics. and then aided the Defenders and the Interloper in battle against fellow Defender Moondragon, and the Dragon of the Moon who was possessing Moondragon. Andromeda sacrificed her life force, joining with Manslaughter, the Valkyrie, and the Interloper to drive the Dragon of the Moon from the Earth, and her body was turned to stone.Defenders #152. Marvel Comics. The Dragon would later return, this time without a body. To stop the Dragon of the Moon, Doctor Strange cast a spell which returned the souls of the Defenders fallen in the battle against the Dragon to the bodies of several recently deceased humans, changing them into duplicates of the Defenders. Andromeda's soul entered the body of Genevieve Cross and these Defenders now called themselves the Dragon Circle. Together the Dragon Circle banished the Dragon from Earth and Andromeda returned to the oceans.Doctor Strange Vol. 3 #3-4. Marvel Comics. Andromeda played an important part in the 1989 Atlantis Attacks crossover. Andromeda led a rebellion to stop her father Attuma from invading the surface world, but was bested by Attuma in personal combat. She was kidnapped unconscious by the Deviant priest Ghaur as one of his \"Seven Brides of Set.\"X-Factor Annual #4. Marvel Comics. Under Ghaur's domination, she accompanied She-Hulk to acquire a piece of Set's life force.Avengers West Coast Annual #4. Marvel Comics. In the end the Brides of Set gained their freedom thanks to the Fantastic Four and Avengers.Fantastic Four Annual #22. Marvel Comics. Andromeda joined her forces with those of Namor. She was part of the short-lived Deep Six, a group of underwater heroes.Namor, the Sub-Mariner #58 (Jan. 1995). Marvel Comics. During this time her mind and that of Genevieve Cross would repeatedly exchange control and even turn her body into a copy of Genevieve's. Andromeda sacrificed her own mind to save Namor's soul, leaving Genevieve in control of Andromeda's body.Dr. Strange vol. 3 #3. Marvel Comics. Months later, either Genevieve in Andromeda's body or a restored Andromeda herself assisted Namor and the Defenders against Attuma's own Deep Six.Defenders vol. 2, #7 (Sep. 2001). Marvel Comics. Andromeda was last seen as an ally of Namor, living in Atlantis.Fantastic Four vol 1 #588. Marvel Comics. Andromeda later appears as a member of Namor's Defenders of the Deep.Avengers Vol. 8 #9. Marvel Comics. ==Powers and abilities== Andromeda has all the powers inherent to the Homo mermanus, but her strength and speed are far greater than that of any ordinary Homo mermanus, though not as great as that of her father, Attuma. She is adapted to live underwater, having gills that allow her to breathe underwater, she can swim at high speeds and her body is resistant to the pressure and the cold of the deep oceans. Her specially-developed vision allows her to see clearly in the murky depths of the ocean. She can survive only for 10 minutes out of water, unless she uses a special serum that gives her the ability to breathe air. Her stamina, agility, and reflexes are reduced when out of the water. She has been trained as an Atlantean warrior, and is very skilled in the arts of hunting and war, wielding a trident as her weapon of choice. She carries a short sword and an 8\" dagger as additional weaponry. Andromeda also has extensive knowledge of biochemistry. ==Notes== * Genevieve Cross is called Genevieve Cass in the Dragon Circle entry in the Handbook of the Marvel Universe '89 edition. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Comics characters introduced in 1985 Category:Female characters in comics Category:Marvel Comics Atlanteans (Homo mermanus) Category:Marvel Comics characters with superhuman strength Category:Marvel Comics superheroes Category:Marvel Comics female superheroes ",
