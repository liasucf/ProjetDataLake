Kirkham and Dr David Seymour. Britain's war effort created great demand for munitions and goods, which had to be produced by a relatively unskilled workforce. Butten and his colleagues formed Personnel Administration Limited to provide advice to industry as to how to improve the productivity of their workers.The story of the PA Consulting Group 1943-1992, Christine Jackson and Mark SmalleyPagano, Margareta (30 January 2011) A perfect partnership between the geeks and suits The Independent Like the other three firms that dominated consulting in the 1940s, '50s and '60s, PA was an offshoot of the pre-war Bedaux Company.Kipping Matthias Management Consultancies and Organizational Innovation in Europe in P\u00e9rez, Paloma Fern\u00e1ndez and Rose, Mary (Eds) Innovation and Entrepreneurial Networks in Europe p.66, Routledge, 2009. Bedaux in turn had been developed based on 'scientific management' theories of Frederick Winslow Taylor and Frank Gilbreth. Butten sought to take the mechanistic and task-orientated concepts of scientific management and add a human dimension to them. The chief idea, along the lines of Douglas McGregor's 'Theory Y', was that by involving the worker in the process of change and a suitable form of ownership, greater gains could be made both by the worker and the organisation.Ernest Butten Obituary - The Times (London, England), Tuesday, 26 March 1985; pg. 14; Issue 62096. PA's first assignment was to train housewives to assemble the tail gun section for the Avro Lancaster bombers, as part of Britain's policy of bringing women into the factories in order to free up male workers for the armed forces.Power, Helen (15 August 2008) Britain's biggest private companies: Expertise at your service The Daily Telegraph By 1964, the company had dropped the name Personnel Administration and was known as simply PA Consulting Group.The Times Monday 1 June 1964, p.19, Issue:56026 ===1950\u20131970=== PA expanded over the next 20 years, and by 1970 it was the world\u2019s largest management consulting firms by headcount.Hill, Andrew (11 November 2013) Change ripples through fish tank FT.com PA had also expanded geographically, mostly along the lines of the Commonwealth, with its operation in Australia providing about a third of the firm's revenue.The story of the PA Consulting Group 1943-1992\u2019, Christine Jackson and Mark Smalley In the 1960s, PA diversified its business significantly by developing the use of the 'newspaper box' advertisement for recruitment. Butten retired from PA in 1970, having earlier sold his 100% shareholding in PA to the Butten Trust in 1958. The Trust was intended as a long-term guardian of PA's fortunes and an assurance that the company would be 'owned by the employees'.The Times, 26 March 1985, Ernest Butten obituary ===1970\u20131992=== PA's strength during this period was in the firm's work advising companies on potential applications of technology to business issues. Arising out of this success, major technology centres were built in Melbourn, UK, and Princeton, USA.The story of the PA Consulting Group 1943-1992\u2019, by Christine Jackson and Mark Smalley Towards the end of the '80s, after an upsurge in the industry, PA's management decided it wanted to take the firm public. The Butten Trust, after an application to the courts in the UK, agreed to give 15% of its shares to its employees as part of a long-term plan to float. However, the company suffered in the subsequent consulting industry downturn of 1989 to 1992 and changed its strategy to one of staff ownership. ===1992\u20132015=== Between 1991 and 1994, PA reduced its workforce by almost half. In 1992, Jon Moynihan was appointed as chief executive of PA, with a remit to turn the company around.

At the time, Nyras was the only consultancy in the air transport industry authorised by the Financial Conduct Authority to undertake commercial and transactional advisory services in the aviation sector. In April 2018, PA's Chairman, Marcus Agius, announced he would step down and assume the role of Deputy Chairman, with John Alexander replacing him. Alexander made the move from environmental and sustainability consultancy ERM, where he took the company through two rounds of private equity funding and grew the enterprise value from US$525 million to US$1.75 billion. The next month, PA bought London-based Sparkler, a leading digital insight and strategy consultancy that works with the like of Microsoft, Diageo and Uber. By October 2018, the consultancy expanded its acquisitions into the United States, acquiring innovation strategy and product design business Essential Design. Based in Boston, Massachusetts, the company has helped Woodford Reserve bourbon to strengthen its brand and designed the Hydrow connected home rowing machine. In December 2018, PA bought another London-based company, the digital service design and engineering agency We Are Friday. They brought with them high- profile digital clients like HSBC, Nuffield Health and the British Red Cross. In the same month, PA also announced it was appointing a new head of its Americas business, Ken Toombs, to drive rapid expansion in the United States. He brought 30-years experience in management consulting and moved to PA from his role as the Global Head of Infosys Consulting. Then, in June 2019, PA looked again to the US and acquired 4iNNo, an innovation company based in Cincinnati, Ohio. In February 2020, PA announced record fee income of \u00a3500 million and stated their plans to double its revenue in the next five years. Most recently, in June 2020, PA acquired San Francisco-based Astro Studios, a brand strategy and product design agency that works with the likes of Nike, Bose and Facebook.
