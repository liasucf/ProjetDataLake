The building is currently owned by the Public Trustee and open to the public.Richmond Castle: A Tale Of Grandeur And Romance The house sits on a hill from the Kalutara, adjoining the Kalu Ganga River at Palatota,Richmond Castle travel tips on a estate beside the Kalutara-Palatota Road. ==History== Mudaliyar Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena photographed 22 December 1919 The building was constructed by a local landowner and philanthropist, Padikara Mudali Nanayakkara Rajawasala Appuhamilage Don Arthur de Silva Wijesinghe Siriwardena (12 November 1889 - 8 July 1947). Srirwardena studied in Britain and on completion of his studies he was bestowed the position of Mudaliyar by the King, returning to Ceylon to take up the position. The mansion was built based on a similar plan of a castle in India, which was owned by Srirwardena's schoolmates, Raja Rajeswara Sethupathi, the Raja of Ramnad. Sriwardena had requested a copy of the building plans from the Sethupathi, but was refused with the advice the Ceylonese were not capable of undertaking such a large construction project. This inspired Sriwardena to visit the Raja with two local architects, who secretly drew plans of the castle. Richmond Castle is a two-storey building with sixteen rooms, 99 doors and 34 windows. All essential supplies for the building were sourced from abroad, including floor titles from Italy, teak from Burma (used to construct the main staircase), window panes, decorated with glass depicting grape vines, from Scotland, and an iron stair and bathroom fittings from England. Srirwardena moved into Richmond Castle upon his marriage to Clarice Matilda Maude Suriyabandara in 1910. The marriage took place in St. Mary's Church, Kalamulla. The couple spent 32 years together however they were unable to have children. Srirwenda bequeathed his properties to the Public Trustee, with the request that the castle was converted to a children's home. Srirwardena died on 8 July 1947 and from 1956 the Richmond Castle has been taken care by the Public Trustee Department of Sri Lanka. ==See also== *Srawasthi Mandiraya ==References== ==External links== * Department of Public Trustee Category:Government buildings in Sri Lanka Category:Houses completed in 1910 Category:Buildings and structures in Kalutara ",
