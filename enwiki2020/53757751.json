    "text": "Austroargiolestes brookhousei is a species of Australian damselfly in the family Megapodagrionidae, commonly known as a Barrington flatwing. It is endemic to northern New South Wales, where it inhabits streams and bogs. Austroargiolestes brookhousei is a medium-sized to large, black and pale blue damselfly, without pruinescence. Like other members of the family Megapodagrionidae, it rests with its wings outspread. ==Etymology== In 1986, G\u00fcnther Theischinger and Tony O'Farrell named this species brookhousei, an eponym in acknowledgement of the work of Peter Brookhouse who was responsible for collecting specimens for analysis. ==Gallery== Austroargiolestes brookhousei female (11775637924).jpg | Tip of female tail Austroargiolestes brookhousei male (11775495553).jpg | Tip of male tail Austroargiolestes brookhousei female wings (34664647402).jpg | Female wings Austroargiolestes brookhousei male wings (34664650482).jpg | Male wings ==See also== * List of Odonata species of Australia == References == Category:Megapodagrionidae Category:Odonata of Australia Category:Insects of Australia Category:Endemic fauna of Australia Category:Taxa named by G\u00fcnther Theischinger Category:Taxa named by A.F.
