It originated as the front of the a processional banner - the reverse showed Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata and is now in Parma. The banner was painted for a confraternity based at the San Francesco Monastery in Fabriano, the painter's birthplace - he had returned there from Brescia for a few months in spring 1420 before moving on to Florence. Ambrogio de' Bizochis was probably the intermediary between the painter and the confraternity - he was cousin to Egidio, brother of Gentile's wife.Mauro Minardi, Gentile da Fabriano, Skira, Milano 2005. ==References== category:Paintings by Gentile da Fabriano category:1420s paintings Category:Paintings of the J.
