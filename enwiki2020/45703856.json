    "text": "First World War Honour Board is a heritage-listed memorial at the National Australia Bank, 308 Queen Street, in the Brisbane central business district, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. == History == Of the 331,946 Australians who embarked for overseas service, nearly 60,000 did not survive the First World War. Memorials were commissioned by service organisations, shire or city councils and by business groups. Some commemorated those who had died, while others recorded all who had served in the armed forces during the war. This honour board was erected by the Queensland National Bank in commemoration of those employees who served during this War. The Sydney firm of Wunderlich Ltd, suppliers of architectural metalwork, manufactured the board. Listed in an oval centrepiece are the names of 115 employees of the Queensland National Bank (now the National Australia Bank) who saw service during the war and returned. Around this are the photographs and names of 22 employees who died while on active service. The memorial was unveiled by George Edward Bunning, Chairman of the Queensland National Bank Board on 19 August 1920. It is located to one side of the main entrance of the banking chamber, matched by a less elaborate Wunderlich honour board commemorating service of the bank's employees during the Second World War. == Description == Roll of Honour, Queensland National Bank, Brisbane, August 1920 The honour board is a large bronze panel framed by mouldings and relief ornamentation, with lettering covering the pediment and frieze.
