It was released as a download-only single on 15 December 2008.Christmas Song Release Confirmed Retrieved 27 April 2013 The song was originally written by lead singer Dan Gillespie Sells several years before on his piano. He said on the band's official website: \"I'm the opposite of the 'Bah Humbug' Christmas grump. I've always loved Christmas and the surrounding hullabaloo - especially the songs from Bing to Slade to Wizzard to Bing and Bowie. I wrote and recorded this one several years ago on the piano, but never intended it to be released so I kept it a secret. We added the drums and strings this year and then we thought it might be a good time to let people hear it to see what they thought!\"Feeling Like Christmas!
