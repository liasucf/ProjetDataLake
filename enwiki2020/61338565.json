    "text": "Johann M\u00fcnzberg (3 August 1799 \u2013 1 September 1878) was an industrialist in Austrian-era Bohemia. His textile factories, Textilwerke Johann M\u00fcnzberg & Co., were at the time leading companies in Bohemia. He was also influential in the building of the Empress Elisabeth Bridge across the Elbe at Tetschen, a railway, a brewery on his estate in Libotschan, schools and a savings bank. == Life == M\u00fcnzberg was born on 3 August 1799 in Sch\u00f6nlinde, Bohemia, the son of Johann Gottfried Lorenz M\u00fcnzberg (1758\u20131824) who had founded a textile factory for calico print, twine and linen in 1786. M\u00fcnzberg trained as a weaver and first worked in his father's factory. He gained experience as a journeyman and merchant in Rumburg and Georgswalde. In 1828 he and his brother Josef M\u00fcnzberg (1794\u20131867) founded a cotton spinning mill, Theresienau, in Altstadt near Tetschen. It developed into an important group of companies. After further foundations and takeovers, the factories, under the name Textilwerke Johann M\u00fcnzberg & Co., had more than 60,000 spindles in 1876 and were thus the most important company in the industry in Bohemia. M\u00fcnzberg was called the Spinner King (Spinnerk\u00f6nig). Empress Elisabeth Bridge in Tetschen M\u00fcnzberg also founded a brewery on his estate in Libotschan and participated in the establishment of a sugar factory in Saaz. He supported the construction of a new bridge across the Elbe in Tetschen. The chain bridge was opened in 1855 as the Empress Elisabeth Bridge and connected Tetschen to the railway from Dresden to Prague. M\u00fcnzberg supported the construction of the railway as well as the establishment of schools and a savings bank in Tetschen. In 1848 and 1849 he was entitled to print emergency money (Notgeld). M\u00fcnzberg's descendants continued to run the textile businesses, but many factories became unprofitable and were therefore shut down or taken over by Czech entrepreneurs. The factory in Bensen-Eleonorenhain remained family-owned until 1945. M\u00fcnzberg was awarded the Order of Franz Joseph. He died at the Libotschan estate on 1 September 1878. == References == == External links == * * Heimatfreunde Tetschen-Bodenbach (in German) Heimatfreunde Tetschen Category:1799 births Category:1878 deaths Category:German Bohemian people Category:German industrialists Category:Textile industry Category:Businesspeople in textiles Category:People from Kr\u00e1sn\u00e1 L\u00edpa ",
