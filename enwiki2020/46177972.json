    "text": "Lars Hjorth (born 15 August 1959) is a retired Norwegian football striker and sports official, currently managing director of Stab\u00e6k Fotball. ==Career== He started his career in \u00d8vrevoll BK, and made his national youth team debut at the age of 15. In 1977, he joined SFK Lyn, then playing on the second tier. In 1978, 1980 and 1981 he played on the highest tier with Lyn, in the First Division, scoring 12 goals in 88 games (tally for the 1982 season are unknown). In 1983 and 1984, Lyn had been relegated and Hjorth transferred to SK Brann. Upon returning to Lyn, the team languished in the third tier and Hjorth only played 11 games. He then more or less retired from football, citing burnout after playing on a high level from an early age. In 1987, he briefly played for B\u00e6rum SK, and in 1989 he was on the roster of sixth-tier club Lommedalens IL. After his active career he pursued a career as a sports administrator, among others managing different golf clubs in the district. He was also a liaison for AC Milan, bringing their AC Milan Junior Camp to Norway. In January 2013 he started to volunteer as managing director of Stab\u00e6k Fotball, being formally hired in October the same year. He is married to an Italian woman, has a son and a daughter and settled in Lommedalen. In his younger days, Hjorth was also a national youth player in bandy. ==References== Category:1959 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from B\u00e6rum Category:Norwegian footballers Category:Lyn Fotball players Category:SK Brann players Category:Eliteserien players Category:B\u00e6rum SK players Category:Norwegian sports executives and administrators Category:Norwegian bandy players Category:Association football forwards Category:Norway youth international footballers Category:Norway under-21 international footballers ",
