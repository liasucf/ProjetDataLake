    "text": "William Glass (11 May 1786 - 1853) was a Scottish Corporal and settler. He established the settlement that would become Edinburgh of the Seven Seas, the main settlement on Tristan da Cunha. == Early life == William Glass was born William Glasgow in Kelso, Scotland, in the Scottish borders region on 11 May 1786 to David and Janet Glasgow. He enlisted into the British Army at Berwick- on-Tweed in March 1804. Although it is unclear why, he enlisted under the surname Glass. == Military career == While serving in Cape Town in 1816, Glass was sent to the remote uninhabited island of Tristan da Cunha in order to secure the island in the event that the recently defeated Napoleon Bonaparte, then exiled on St Helena island, might use the island as a base to plan an attack. The soldiers were called back the following year, however William and another man requested permission to remain permanently on the island. This request was granted by Lord Somerset. William also brought his South African wife, Maria Magdalena Leenders and two children. Many others soon followed and by 1852 the population was 52.

Many of his descendants remain on the island, with Glass being the most numerous surname. Notable descendants include police officer Conrad Glass and politician Anne Green. The Glass surname remains one of the most common amongst the local population. Upon his death, his wife and their children relocated to New London, Connecticut. A son, Thomas Glass and a grandson returned ten years later and settled in the old family home on the island. He married a daughter of Thomas Swain and had four sons: Joseph, John, Robert and William and a daughter Jane. Thomas Sr. would perish at sea during the 1885 lifeboat disaster. == References == Category:1786 births Category:1853 deaths Category:People from Kelso, Scottish Borders Category:History of Tristan da Cunha Category:Scottish military personnel Category:Tristan da Cunha ",
