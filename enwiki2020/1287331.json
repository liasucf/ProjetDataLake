    "text": "Sachs and Violens is a fictional comic book duo created by American writer Peter David and co-developed with George P\u00e9rez. They first appeared in a four- issue miniseries of the same name that was published by Marvel's Epic Comics imprint from 1993 to 1994. The series was part of the Heavy Hitters line, and featured a greater amount of violence and adult situations compared with mainstream comic books of the time (the title itself is an obvious play on the words \"sex and violence\"), and as such it was recommended for mature readers. The duo later appeared as supporting characters in David's other creator-owned series, Fallen Angel. ==Plot and characters == Juanita \"J.J.\" Sachs is a model who does softcore pornography photo shoots for her friend Ernie \"Violens\" Schultz, a former Vietnam War photojournalist. After her friend is viciously murdered in a snuff photo shoot, the two of them track down the people responsible and, in the process, become lovers and uncover an underworld of depravity, ending in a violent showdown in Mardi Gras. Sachs and Violens appeared as supporting characters in Peter David's other creator-owned title, Fallen Angel. They first appeared in the second volume of the series, which was published by IDW Publishing, in which they arrive in the series' setting of Bete Noire, a mysterious city of Biblical origin inhabited by various characters of dubious character and motives. They become allies of the series' titular heroine, Liandra, and continue to appear in the series' third volume, by the same publisher, which debuted in August 2009. ==Collected edition== In December 2006, the miniseries was collected as Sachs and Violens, a 128-page trade paperback by DC Comics. ==Merchandising== In August 2009, Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab, a company that produces comic book-themed perfumes, debuted \"Sachs & Violens\", based on the titular comic book characters. Proceeds from sales of the scent went to the Hero Initiative, a non-profit organization dedicated to helping comic book creators in need of health, medical, and quality-of-life assistance.Peter David. \"I Love the Smell of Sachs in the Morning\" peterdavid.net August 18, 2009Sachs & Violens at Black Phoenix Alchemy Lab ==References== ==External links== * * Newsarama interview with Peter David about Sachs and Violens Category:1993 comics debuts Category:Adult comics Category:Comics by Peter David Category:Marvel Comics limited series ",
