The cast included Fats Waller, Eddie Rector and Ralph Cooper, Hall, Maude Mills, Arthur Gaines, Leondus Simmons and a dance troupe called the Tan Town Topics Vamps.

From October 1926, Hall toured America playing the TOBA circuit until September 1927 in the highly praised show Desires of 1927, conceived by J. Homer Tutt and produced by impresario Irvin C. Miller. As the Pittsburgh Courier noted: \"Adelaide Hall and assistants have some show. Speed, pretty girls, catchy music, a touch of art, which touches the border line of nudity \u2013 the names of such well-known stage celebrities as Adelaide Hall, J. Homer Tutt, Henry \"Gang\" Jones, the Harmony, Trio, Charles Hawkins, Arthur Porter, \"Billy\" McKelvey and Clarence Nance.\" Billed as the star \"soubrette\" of the show, Hall's performance included several songs (most notably \"Sweet Virginia Bliss\"), flat-foot dancing and accompanying herself on the ukulele while singing. ===Recordings with Duke Ellington=== In October 1927, Hall recorded her wordless vocals on \"Creole Love Call\", \"The Blues I Love To Sing\" and \"Chicago Stomp Down\" with Duke Ellington and his Orchestra. The recordings were worldwide hits and catapulted both Hall's and Ellington's careers into the mainstream. For historical reasons the story behind \"Creole Love Call\"'s conception is interesting to recount: In 1927, Hall and Duke Ellington were touring in the same show, Dance Mania. The show played several large cities before reaching New York City. In mid-November, Hall travelled from Chicago (where she had been performing at the Sunset Caf\u00e9) to New York City in her Packard automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Hall was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.The Pittsburgh Courier, 19 November 1927, front page: \"'They Always Come Back For More,' says Adelaide\" \u2013 report & photograph. Hall, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in New York City garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big Broadway show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in Dance Mania at the Lafayette Theatre, Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.Dance Mania dates listed on Ellingtonweb. In Dance Mania, Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"Creole Love Call\", which he included in his set. When Hall first heard the number back in October, she recounted, > I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it > (\"Creole Love Call\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the > number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. > Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was > doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, > and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the > band.\" A couple of days later I did. Cotton Club, Harlem When Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand ... the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"David Bradbury, Duke Ellington, Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 (), p. 19. On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's Cotton Club in a revue called Rhythmania. The show featured Hall singing \"Creole Love Call\".Williams, Underneath A Harlem Moon, Chapter 8, pp. 122\u201324.

Blackbirds of 1928 was the idea of impresario Lew Leslie, who planned to build the show around Florence Mills in New York after her success in the hit London show Blackbirds but Mills died of pneumonia in 1927 before rehearsals commenced. Hall was chosen to replace her. The revue opened at Les Ambassadeurs Club in New York in January 1928, under the name Blackbird Revue, but it was renamed Blackbirds of 1928 and in May 1928 transferred to Broadway's Liberty Theatre, where it ran for 518 performances. After a slow start, the show became the hit of the season. Hall's performance of \"Diga Diga Do\", created a sensation. Her mother was so incensed when she went to see the show by her daughter performing what she termed 'risqu\u00e9 dance moves', she tried to stop the show during Hall's performance and banned her from appearing in any future performances. The ban only remained for one performance, and Hall returned triumphantly to her role the following day. It was reported in the press of the day that the show's producer Lew Leslie was so concerned about race violence connected with the controversy surrounding Hall's performance that he took out a hefty insurance policy to cover the cast; the most heavily insured were the principals, Hall and \"Bojangles\" Robinson.\"Adelaide Hall returns to cast of Blackbirds\", Chicago Defender, 11 August 1928.
