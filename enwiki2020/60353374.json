It made its debut at the 2019 Chicago Auto Show on February 7, 2019 and went on sale in the third quarter of 2019. This is the first Legacy model that isn't officially sold in Japan, as the nameplate usage ended there in June 2020. ==History== Series production of the seventh generation Legacy and sixth generation Outback started in July 2019. The first of each model was driven off the SIA production line in Lafayette, Indiana on July 29. The seventh generation Legacy was not marketed in Japan. Orders for the sixth generation Legacy were accepted through June 22, 2020 and production was discontinued after that. ==Design== The 2020 model year Legacy was moved to the Subaru Global Platform (SGP), which is torsionally stiffer compared to the previous generation Legacy. Its exterior styling is similar to the previous generation model, but the headlights and the taillights are slightly restyled. The interior now features an 11.6 inch touchscreen on all trims except the base model, which has two 7 inch displays. Notable mechanical changes include an updated base engine, the FB25 now featuring direct injection, and a turbocharged 2.4 liter FA24 flat four engine from the Ascent for higher trim levels which replaces the outgoing 3.6 liter EZ36 flat six engine. 90% of the components in the new FB25 are new compared to its predecessor. In terms of safety, there is a new optional facial recognition system which uses cameras to warn the driver if the system detects that they are distracted or fatigued. ===Trim summary=== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center;font- size:100%;\" |+United States Legacy key features by trimline |- ! colspan=2 | !
