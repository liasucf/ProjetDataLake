    "text": "Murcia del Carmen railway station is the main railway station in the Spanish city of Murcia. ==Services== The Cercan\u00edas Murcia/Alicante commuter rail network connects Murcia del Carmen with Alicante railway station and \u00c1guilas through lines C-1 and C-2. Alvia high speed services use the Madrid\u2013Levante high-speed rail network as far as Albacete, then the classic rail tracks to Murcia and on to Cartagena. Talgo services also operate to Valencia Nord and Barcelona Sants. ==Future== The AVE high-speed rail system is due to be extended to Murcia in 2021 as part of the Madrid\u2013Levante high-speed rail network, (and later, in 2023, as the starting point for the Murcia\u2013Almer\u00eda high-speed rail line) with platforms and track possibly being relocated underground. In October 2017, protesters against the underground alignment blocked the track leading to the station, leading to multiple train cancellations. ==References== Category:Railway stations in the Region of Murcia ",
