She returned to play in 1964, and at Wimbledon, she lost in a third-round match to Margaret Smith. She entered the U.S. Championships the same year, but withdrew before the tournament. Susman played little in the 1960s and 1970s, but joined the start of Team Tennis in the USA in 1974 and made occasional tournament appearanceshttps://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/07/sports/tennis/when-skills-in- the-kitchen-outranked-skills-on-the-tennis-court.html, returning to Wimbledon once and the US Open, where her last Grand Slam singles tournament was at the 1980 US Open.

According to Lance Tingay of The Daily Telegraph and the Daily Mail, Susman was ranked in the world top 10 in 1961, 1962, and 1964, reaching a career high of world no. 4 in 1962. Susman was included in the year-end top 10 rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association from 1959 through 1962 and in 1964.
