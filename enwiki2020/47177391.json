    "text": "The Noah Bryan Store is a historic commercial building at the southwest corner of Glade and Main Streets in Marshall, Arkansas. It is a single-story fieldstone structure, built in a distinctive Ozark regional style in which quarry-faced stone is set at differing depths to create a rusticated and textured surface. It was built in 1926 by Bob Hardin, a local builder, for Noah Bryan, who operated a retail store on the premises until the great depression. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. == See also == *National Register of Historic Places listings in Searcy County, Arkansas == References == Category:Commercial buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1926 Category:Buildings and structures in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Searcy County, Arkansas Category:1926 establishments in Arkansas ",
