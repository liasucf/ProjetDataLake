Chris O'Connor of Impulse Gamer rated it 4 out of 5. He considered the game to be quite relaxing, but he considered its content not deep enough. Alec Meer of Rock, Paper, Shotgun enjoyed the atmosphere in the game, which is so great that he even would like to become a bus driver. He says \"Bus Simulator 18 leaves me with a deep sympathy for bus drivers and a great terror that I might ever become one.\" Andy Kelly of PC Gamer compared the game with the similar-genre video game Euro Truck Simulator 2 of SCS Software, commenting the game maybe not as good as the truck-simulator, but it is full of interaction, which is what the Truck Simulator franchise is missing. ==References== ==External links == * Category:2018 video games Category:Bus simulation video games Category:Bus Simulator series Category:Multiplayer and single-player video games Category:PlayStation 4 games Category:Unreal Engine games Category:Video games developed in Austria Category:Windows games Category:Xbox One games Category:Video game sequels ",
