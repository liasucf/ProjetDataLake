Rinn an Chaisle\u00e1in was originally the site of a castle built by the Ferriters. In 1840 a Protestant \"soup-school\" was built using the stones from the castle ruins; it closed in 1852. Rinn an Chaisle\u00e1in remained in use as a calluragh (unconsecrated burial ground). All island families traced their ancestry to either Dunquin or Ventry, and so were buried on the mainland to rest with their families. In times of bad weather the island would be cut off from the mainland, and corpses remained unburied, sometimes for weeks. In extremis, bodies would be buried at Rinn an Chaisle\u00e1in. It was also used for the burial of unbaptised infants, suicides and shipwrecked sailors. Some of the burial sites are marked by stones. ==References== Category:Religion in County Kerry Category:Archaeological sites in County Kerry Category:National Monuments in County Kerry ",
