The district was originally a bay in the Gulf of Finland, which eventually became swampy. The bay was filled in the middle of the 19th century. The odour of rotting seaweed and other plants can still be smelled near construction sites. The Helsinki Metro construction found a kluuvi in the district, when it turned out the planned site for a metro tunnel was supposed to go didn't have a solid rock base. The soft ground had to be artificially frozen before it was possible to dig through it to construct a solid base for the metro track. == External links == Category:Vironniemi district ",
