Analyses of innovations by large scale public actors\u2014national governments and transnational organizations\u2014address both success and failure of policy, informed by both empirical evidence and the experience of policy innovators.

Each includes discussion of motivations, challenges, strategies, outcomes, and unintended consequences. Following each case narrative, we present commentary by an academic discussant. The discussant highlights the aspects of the innovation that are analytically most interesting, have the most significant implications for policy, and/or best illustrate reciprocal relationships between technology and governance. Authors and co-authors of Innovations case narratives and discussions have included Seth Berkley, Larry Brilliant, John Elkington, Matt Flannery (co-founder of Kiva (organization)), Peter Gabriel, Robin Hanson, Marcin Jakubowski, Richard Anthony Jefferson, Victoria Hale, Cory Ondrejka, and Bunker Roy. == References == == External links == * Category:Business and management journals Category:Publications established in 2006 Category:MIT Press academic journals Category:Quarterly journals Category:English-language journals Category:George Mason University academic journals Category:Harvard University academic journals Category:MIT academic journals Category:Open access journals ",
