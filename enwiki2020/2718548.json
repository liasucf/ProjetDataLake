Susie assumed the creative and Doug Tompkins the financial role in the business. At that time (mid-60's) their sales success was due to their original \"Big Mama\", Helene W. Japhe, who agreed to represent them exclusively as their sales agent, taking their line \"on the road\" and having great success. After Helene Japhe's departure from the company and San Francisco, the business continued to flourish under more professional administration and management until its US downturn and eventual sale to a Hong Kong firm.
