He served as Archbishop of Detroit from 1937 until his death, and was made a cardinal in 1946. ==Early life and ministry== Edward Mooney was born in Mount Savage, Maryland as the seventh child of Thomas and Sarah (n\u00e9e Heneghan) Mooney. At age 5, he moved with his family to Youngstown, Ohio, where his father worked at a tube mill. Following his father's death in the 1890s, his mother opened a small bakery to support the family, with Edward and his siblings delivering the baked goods to her customers. He attended St. Charles College in Ellicott City and St. Mary's Seminary in Baltimore before being sent to Rome in 1905 to study at the Pontifical North American College. He was ordained to the priesthood by Cardinal Pietro Respighi on April 10, 1909. Upon his return to the United States, Mooney taught dogmatic theology at St. Mary's Seminary in Cleveland until 1916. He was the founding principal of the Cathedral Latin School in Cleveland from 1916 to 1922, and pastor of St. Patrick's Church in Youngstown from 1922 to 1923. Returning to Rome, he then became spiritual director of the North American College in 1923. Albert Meyer, a student at the North American College and future cardinal, once said, \"[Mooney] was revered and greatly beloved...he left an indelible mark on all the students, inspiring them with his great learning and his solid spiritual guidance.\" He was raised to the rank of Domestic Prelate of His Holiness on June 3, 1925. ==Episcopal career== ===Apostolic Delegate=== On January 21, 1926, after having made a favorable impression on Cardinal Pietro Gasparri,TIME Magazine. 17th Archdiocese 1937-06-14.

During his tenure in Bangalore, fifteen missions and three dioceses were created and the Syro-Malankara Church was reconciled with the Holy See.The Syro-Malankara Catholic Church Mooney was later named Apostolic Delegate to Japan on March 30, 1931. At the time of his arrival, all Japanese were required to visit and pay homage at Shinto shrines, with Catholics objecting to participation in Shinto worship. Mooney led a successful effort for the Japanese government to declare that visits to the shrines were only of a patriotic nature and not a religious one. He later presided over a plenary council of the Korean bishops. ===Bishop of Rochester=== Being recalled from Tokyo to the United States, he was appointed the fourth Bishop of Rochester, with the personal title of \"Archbishop\", on August 28, 1933.

During his tenure in Rochester, he promoted Catholic Action and the Knights of Peter Claver as a means of outreach to the African American community, and took deep interest in Catholic social teaching and labor relations.Diocese of Rochester.

Charles Coughlin, whose controversial radio broadcasts had angered many in the Catholic hierarchy and American public. In October 1937, he rebuked Coughlin for casting aspersions on President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's sanity over his nomination of Hugo Black to the Supreme Court, leading Coughlin to cancel his contract for twenty-six radio broadcasts.TIME Magazine.
