They were crowned champions of the 2015\u201316 Iraq Division One which promoted them to the Iraqi Premier League for the first time in their history.2016/17 Iraqi Premier League, Goalzz.com ==History== Al-Hussein, named after the Imam of Shia Husayn ibn Ali, were founded in 1999 during the reign of Saddam Hussein. Their first participation in the Iraq FA Cup was in the 2002\u201303 edition when they were in the third division of Iraqi football; they faced Al-Tharthar in Round 1 on September 2, 2002 and the game ended 0\u20130 with Al-Hussein being knocked out of the competition via penalty shootout. By the 2004\u201305 season, Al-Hussein were in the Iraq Division One (the second division of Iraqi football) and in that season, they finished top of their group in the first stage with 20 points from ten games to qualify for the final stage. In the final stage, Al-Hussein needed to finish top of their group to be promoted to the Iraqi Premier League but they only achieved seven points from six matches and failed to gain promotion. By the time the 2011\u201312 Iraq Division One came around, Al-Hussein had still failed to gain promotion. In that season, Al-Hussein performed poorly, finishing tenth in their 12-team group, losing half of their 22 matches. The 2012\u201313 Iraq Division One was a similar story as they only won one of their ten games and only managed to achieve six points from ten games. In the 2013\u201314 season, Al-Hussein performed better by winning nine of their 15 matches but this was not enough to qualify them for the second stage of the competition. After many seasons trying to get promoted to the top division of Iraq, Al-Hussein finally achieved it by being crowned champions of the 2015\u201316 Iraq Division One. They did so by finishing top of their group in the Elite Stage and then also finishing top of their group in the Golden Stage. That season, they also participated in the 2015\u201316 Iraq FA Cup and they were one of the best-performing teams in the tournament. In the preliminary round, they knocked out Al-Etisalat with a 2\u20131 win, and in the round of 32 they produced one of the biggest upsets of the cup, knocking out Al-Mina'a, one of the top teams in the Iraqi Premier League, with a 2\u20131 scoreline. They eased past fellow Division One team Balad 3\u20130 in the round of 16 to qualify for the quarter-finals, being one of only two lower division teams to reach the quarter-finals of that competition. In the quarter-final, Al-Hussein were drawn with Al-Zawra'a, who would eventually win the Iraqi Premier League that season without a single loss. However, Al-Hussein produced another shocking result, inflicting the first defeat of the season on Al-Zawra'a by beating them 2\u20131. But, unlike the previous rounds, the quarter-final consisted of two legs rather than just one, so Al-Zawra'a managed to recover the tie in the second leg and defeat Al-Hussein 3\u20131 to knock them out 4\u20133 on aggregate. ==Current squad== ===First-team squad=== ==Current technical staff== {| class=\"toccolours\" !bgcolor=silver|Position !bgcolor=silver|Name !bgcolor=silver|Nationality |- bgcolor=#eeeeee |Manager:||Sabah Abdul Hassan|| |- |Assistant Manager:||Ziyad Qasim|| |- bgcolor=#eeeeee |Assistant manager:||Kareem Salim|| |- |Goalkeeping coach:||Sajed Juma|| |-bgcolor=#eeeeee |Fitness coach:||Tariq Musab|| |- |Director of football:||Subhi Al-Azzawi|| |- bgcolor=#eeeeee | Administrative director:||Fadhil Zghayer|| |- |Technical advisor:||Sabeeh Aftan|| |- |Reserve team Manager:||Sadiq Mnati|| |- |Reserve team Assistant:||Hussien|| |- bgcolor=#eeeeee |Reserve team Assistant:||Ali Shendi|| |- |Reserve team Goalkeeping coach:||Mohammed Taher|| |-bgcolor=#eeeeee |Reserve team fitness coach:||Ali Mizher|| |- |U-16 Manager:||Hussien Lafta|| |- |U-16 Assistant Manager:||Mohammed Kadhim|| |- bgcolor=#eeeeee |U-16 Fitness coach:||Karrar Akram|| |- |U-16 Goalkeeping coach:||Hamza Eidan|| |-bgcolor=#eeeeee |U-16 Team Supervisor:||Nael Khalil|| |- |U-16 Administrative Director:||Ali Tahseen|| |- bgcolor=#eeeeee ==Managerial history== * Adel Acher * Sadiq Saadoun Abdul-Ridha * Ziyad Qasim (caretaker) * Ali Wahab * Sabah Abdul Hassan ==Honours== *Iraq Division One **Winner (1): 2015\u201316 ==References== ==External links== * Club's page on Goalzz.com Category:Football clubs in Iraq Category:Sport in Baghdad ",
