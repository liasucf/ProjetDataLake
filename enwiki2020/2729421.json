    "text": "The 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (\"Red Arrow\") is an infantry brigade combat team in the United States Army National Guard. It was formed from the inactivated 32nd Infantry Division in 1967. It is the largest unit in the Wisconsin National Guard.http://www.wisgov.state.wi.us/journal_media_detail.asp?locid=19&prid;=3116 ==History== M-60A1/A3 Patton main battle tanks are lined up in the staging area at the Dundalk Marine Terminal, Port of Baltimore, after being offloaded from the vehicle cargo/rapid response ship USNS Antares (T-AKR-294). The tanks were used by the 32nd Infantry Brigade (Mechanized) (Separate), Wisconsin Army National Guard, during Exercise REFORGER '86. Formed in 1967 from the inactivated 32nd Infantry Division, the Red Arrow Brigade consisted of three battalions of light infantry as well as support and engineer units. The 32nd's shoulder patch, a line shot through with a red arrow, originated in the division's tenacity in piercing German lines during World War I that no other army could breach. It then became known as the Red Arrow Division. After 1967 the brigade was a separate brigade of the Wisconsin Army National Guard, not part of any larger infantry division. In April 1971, the brigade was converted to a mechanized brigade and became the 32nd \"Red Arrow\" Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Mechanized). In 1984\u201385 the brigade included 2\u2013127 Infantry (Mech); 1\u2013128 Infantry (Mech); 1st Battalion, 632nd Armor Regiment; 1\u2013120 Field Artillery; Troop E, 105th Cavalry; and the 32nd Engineer Company.Isby and Kamps 1985, 384. In January 1986 the 32nd Brigade participated in REFORGER '86. The entire brigade deployed from Wisconsin, with all of its equipment, to Germany. In October 1996, the brigade lost its separate status and became a divisional brigade, assigned to the 34th \"Red Bull\" Infantry Division. The 34th Division had its headquarters in Minnesota. On 1 October 2001, the brigade was reorganized as the 32nd Infantry Brigade (Separate) (Light).\"'Back to the future' for new, lighter 32nd infantry brigade\", National Guard, 2001. This resulted in the 32nd Brigade becoming a separate formation once again, no longer attached to the 34th ID. On 23 January 2003 about 100 soldiers from various 32nd \"Red Arrow\" Infantry Brigade units reported for active duty for service as Task Force Red Arrow in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Task Force Red Arrow supplemented security for two years at three of Wisconsin's airbases, the 440th Airlift Wing in Milwaukee, the 128th Air Refueling Wing in Milwaukee, and the 115th Fighter Wing in Madison. The brigade was reorganized again in September 2007 as the 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team. With this change the 2nd Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment was reorganized as a cavalry reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition unit, known as the 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry Regiment. ==Units 2015== 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (32nd IBCT) consisted of the following elements in 2015: * Headquarters and Headquarters Company (HHC) 32nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team (32nd IBCT) * 1st Squadron, 105th Cavalry Regiment (RSTA) Reconnaissance, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition * 3rd Battalion, 126th Infantry Regiment (Michigan National Guard)https://doorcountypulse.com/celebrating-red-arrow-wisconsin-national- guard-begins-campaign-honor-world-war- soldiers/https://issuu.com/ltcdavid/docs/126newsletter_apr_2017 * 2nd Battalion, 127th Infantry Regiment * 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment * 1st Battalion, 120th Field Artillery Regiment (1-120th FAR) * 173rd Brigade Engineer Battalion (173rd BEB) (formerly Special Troops Battalion, 32nd BCT) * 132nd Brigade Support Battalion (132nd BSB) ==Operation Iraqi Freedom== ===Units deployed to Iraq in 2004\u201305=== First Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment *Activated: 10 June 2004 *In theater: November, 2004 *Return: 25 October 2005 *Location: FOB O'Ryan, FOB Cobra, FOB McKenzie, Patrol Base Olson, and the Kaufman Compound *6 KIA (TF 1\u2013128) includes attached Units Second Battalion, 127th Infantry Regiment *Activated: June, 2005 *In theater: August, 2005 *Return: August, 2006 *3 KIA *Location: CSC Navistar, Kuwait Second Battalion, 128th Infantry Regiment *Activated: August, 2005 *In theater: November, 2005 *Return: November 2006 *Locations: :A Company Camp Navistar, Al-Abdali, Kuwait. :B Company Camp Victory, Kuwait, then Camp Virginia after its closure. :C Company Camp Buehring, Udairi Range, Kuwait, Ali Al-Salim airbase L.S.A. :D Company Camp Virginia, Kuwait.
