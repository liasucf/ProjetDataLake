    "text": "Erich Josef Gliebe (born May 23, 1963 in Cleveland, Ohio) is a former boxer and former Chairman of the National Alliance. In his youth, Gliebe had been a professional boxer who had the ring name of \"The Aryan Barbarian.\" == Biography == Gliebe's political views were inspired by his father, who served in the German Wehrmacht in World War II. He became prominent within the National Alliance, a white nationalist, anti-semitic and white supremacist political organization in the United States. As leader of the Cleveland National Alliance Local Unit he was hired by William Pierce to run the White- power music label Resistance Records after the National Alliance bought full ownership of it in 1999. After Pierce's death in July 2002, Gliebe was appointed the new Chairman by the Board of Directors. Almost immediately, Gliebe began to alienate members, provoking a backlash within the NA leadership. Gliebe briefly turned the leadership over to Shaun Walker, but resumed the leadership of the National Alliance, after his successor was charged with Civil Rights violations. After resuming the leadership of the organization, Gliebe saw the National Alliance's membership decline precipitously, orchestrated the sale of its Hillsboro, West Virginia property, and halted its operations as a \"membership organization.\" In April 2009, it was revealed that Gliebe's name was on the list of people banned from entering the United Kingdom. He is married to Playboy model, Erika Gliebe. ==References== ==External links== * * Fall of the Fourth Reich, Scene Magazine * Lack of Leadership Blamed for Demise of Pro-White Group, American Free Press Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:American neo-Nazis Category:American people of German descent Category:Boxers from Ohio Category:Sportspeople from Cleveland Category:American male boxers ",
