The winning Shannon Kleibrink team represented Alberta at the 2017 Scotties Tournament of Hearts in St. Catharines. The 2006 Winter Olympics bronze medallist Shannon Kleibrink and her Okotoks, Alberta-based team never trailed in the final game against Val Sweeting. It was Kleibrink's fifth career provincial championship, but the first for her teammates. Kleibrink had missed a few games due to a back injury following a routine work-out sessionhttp://www.edmontonsun.com/2017/01/24/kleibrinks-back-out-nedohin- filling-in-at-alberta-scotties and was replaced by two-time Scotties champion Heather Nedohin.http://www.sportsnet.ca/curling/nedohin-skips-team-kleibrink- alberta-scotties-playoffs/ For Sweeting, her loss in the final was the second time in a row, as she had lost to Chelsea Carey in the final of the 2016 Alberta Scotties Tournament of Hearts.http://www.sportsnet.ca/curling/live- provincial-curling-championships-2017/ Organizers of the event were pleased with the turnout of the event.
