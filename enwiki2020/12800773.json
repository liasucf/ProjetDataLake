His early career focused mainly on the track, where he won the Points Race at the 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships. Later that season Kiryienka won Stage 19 of the Giro d'Italia, a mountainous affair leading to Presolana, after spending the day on the attack and registering more than 6 hours and a half in the saddle. He attacked his six breakaway companions at the foot of the Monte Para climb and soloed to the finish for the win, by a margin of over four minutes. ===Caisse d'Epargne (2009\u20132012)=== time trial at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London Kiryienka moved to the Spanish squad for the 2009 season. In 2010 he finished second in the tenth stage of the Tour de France after he was outsprinted at the line in Gap by S\u00e9rgio Paulinho () after the pair's decisive attack with remaining. On 23 May 2011, during the Giro d'Italia, Kiryienka's team mate Xabier Tondo was killed in a freak accident at home while preparing to train with teammates. He was reportedly crushed between his car and a garage door. Five days later, Kiryienka rode to victory in a solo effort on Stage 20, a mountain top finish at Sestriere, and he dedicated the stage victory to Tond\u00f3, pointing skyward as he crossed the finish line. The team had met to consider withdrawing from the race after Tond\u00f3's death, but instead the riders unanimously voted to ride on. Kiryienka commented that the squad at the Giro hoped to get a further stage win (as Francisco Ventoso's win had come before Tond\u00f3's death) to honor him, while other members of the team grieved with Tond\u00f3's family. In September 2012, Kiryienka finished third in the individual time trial at the road world championships. ===Team Sky (2013\u20132020)=== Kiryienka at the 2014 Tour de France Kiryienka left at the end of the 2012 season, and joined on an initial three-year contract from the 2013 season onwards. In May 2015, Kiryienka won the individual time trial of the Giro d'Italia, which was long and relatively rolling. In June 2015, he won the individual time trial at the inaugural European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan. On 23 September 2015, Kiryienka won the individual time trial at the road world championships in Richmond, Virginia, United States. Kiryienka had the honor to carry the flag of his native Belarus at the opening ceremony of the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, where he competed in the men's individual time trial event; he finished in 17th place. In January 2020, Kiryienka retired from the sport due to recurring \"cardiac issues\". ==Major results== ;1999 : 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships ;2000 : 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships ;2001 : 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships ;2002 : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships ;2003 : UCI Track World Cup, Aguascalientes ::1st 15px Individual pursuit ::3rd 15px Team pursuit : UEC European Under-23 Track Championships ::3rd 15px Individual pursuit ::3rd 15px Team pursuit ;2004 : National Road Championships ::2nd Time trial ::3rd Road race : 3rd 15px Individual pursuit, UCI Track World Cup, Aguascalientes : 6th Overall Tour of Turkey ;2005 : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships : 1st 15px Points race, 2004\u201305 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics, Manchester : 1st Coppa della Pace : 1st Giro del Casentino : 1st Coppa Comune Castelfranco di Sopra : 1st Coppa Mobilio Ponsacco \u2013 Cronometro : 1st Stage 3 Giro della Toscana Under-23 ;2006 : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships : 2006\u201307 UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics ::1st 15px Scratch, Sydney ::2nd 15px Points race, Moscow ::3rd 15px Points race, Sydney : 2nd Overall Scandinavian Week ::1st Stage 3 : 2nd Scandinavian Open : 3rd 15px Points race, UCI Track World Championships : 3rd Riga Grand Prix : 4th Tallinn\u2013Tartu GP : 4th Szlakiem Walk Majora Hubala : 5th Overall Five Rings of Moscow : 6th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 8th Overall Course de la Solidarit\u00e9 Olympique ::1st Stage 6 ;2007 : 1st Stage 3 Ster Elektrotoer : 1st Stage 5 Vuelta a Burgos : 2nd Overall \u00c9toile de Bess\u00e8ges : 2nd Eindhoven Team Time Trial : 3rd Time trial, National Road Championships : 7th Overall Tirreno\u2013Adriatico : 8th Overall Tour of Austria : 8th Tour du Haut Var : 9th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 9th Grand Prix de Fourmies ;2008 : 1st 20px Points race, UCI Track World Championships : 1st Stage 19 Giro d'Italia : 1st Stage 1 (TTT) Settimana Ciclistica Lombarda : 2nd Time trial, National Road Championships : 2nd Overall Ster Elektrotoer : 2nd Gran Premio Citt\u00e0 di Camaiore : 7th Overall Vuelta a Murcia ;2011 : 1st 20px Overall Route du Sud : 1st Stage 20 Giro d'Italia : 2nd Overall Crit\u00e9rium International ::1st 20px Points classification : 9th Overall Vuelta a Murcia : 10th Overall Tour of the Basque Country ::1st Stage 2 ;2012 : 3rd 15px Time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 6th Overall Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 ;2013 : 1st Stage 18 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a : UCI World Road Championships ::3rd 15px Team time trial ::4th Time trial ;2014 : 1st Stage 1b (TTT) Settimana Internazionale di Coppi e Bartali : 3rd Overall Bayern\u2013Rundfahrt : 4th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 20px Combativity award Stage 11 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a ;2015 : 1st 20px Time trial, UCI Road World Championships : 1st 15px Time trial, European Games : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships : 1st Chrono des Nations : 1st Stage 14 (ITT) Giro d'Italia ;2016 : 1st Chrono des Nations : 2nd 15px Time trial, UCI Road World Championships ;2017 : UCI Road World Championships ::3rd 15px Team time trial ::5th Time trial : 6th GP Miguel Indur\u00e1in ;2018 : 1st 20px Time trial, National Road Championships : 9th Time trial, UCI Road World Championships ;2019 : 1st 15px Time trial, European Games ===Grand Tour general classification results timeline=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !
