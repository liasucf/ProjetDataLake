    "text": "Joe McMahon is an Irish Gaelic footballer. A two-time All-Ireland-winner, he started the 2005 All-Ireland Senior Football Championship Final, but had to be replaced because of injury, making him the first Omagh man to win an All- Ireland. He also started the 2008 final at number 12 but played most of the game alongside his brother in the back line helping to hold Kerry's \"Twin Towers\" of Donaghy and Walsh to 1 point. 2008 was a career-defining year for McMahon, being switched between the forwards and the backs on the Tyrone side throughout most of the season. In the quarter final, while being one of a number of Tyrone players sporting a beard for the occasion, he scored a crucial goal against Dublin. In October 2005, barely a month after his All- Ireland win, McMahon was part of the Omagh St Enda's team that reached the Tyrone Championship Final. He was part of the Omagh CBS MacRory Cup team that shared the title in 2001 (the scheduled replay was abandoned, due to restrictions of crowd gatherings amid a Foot and Mouth outbreak), and reached the final in 2002.OMAGH CBS TO MEET ST MICHAEL'S AGAIN... . ulstercollegesgaa.com. 5 March 2002OMAGH CBS TITLE HOPES DASHED BY SLICK ST MICHAEL'S . ulstercollegesgaa.com. 18 March 2002 His younger brother, Justin was the captain of the Tyrone Under 21s that won the 2006 Ulster Championship.
