Malkin had been a contributor to CRTV, but left the network following its merger with TheBlaze in December 2018 and joined competitor Newsmax TV. Malkin also founded the website Twitchy, a Twitter content curation site. A day after the death of journalist Cokie Roberts, Malkin claimed that Cokie was \"One of the first Guilty Culprits of Fake News\". Brian Stelter quickly said, during the panel discussion, \"You're attacking her today. I just want to be clear: the body isn't even cold yet.\" ===Books=== Malkin has written a total of seven books. Her first book, Invasion: How America Still Welcomes Terrorists, Criminals, and Other Foreign Menaces (2002)Regnery Publishing, 2002, was a New York Times bestseller. In 2004, she wrote In Defense of Internment: The Case for 'Racial Profiling' in World War II and the War on Terror, defending the U.S. government's internment of 112,000 Japanese Americans in prison camps during World War II, and arguing that the same procedures could be used on Arab- and Muslim-Americans today. The book engendered harsh criticism from several Asian American civil rights organizations. The Historians' Committee for Fairness, an organization of scholars and professional researchers, condemned the book for not having undergone peer review and argued that its central thesis is false.Historians' Committee for Fairness. \"Open Letter to Michelle Malkin\" History News Network, August 31, 2004.

A 2007 memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee described Malkin as one of the five \"best-read national conservative bloggers\",Budoff, Carrie. \"GOP issues rules to avoid Macaca moments\" , The Politico, June 13, 2007 and as of 2012 Technorati had ranked MichelleMalkin.com in its \"Top 100 blogs of all types\". In 2011, the people search company PeekYou claimed that Malkin had the largest digital footprint of any political blogger. Malkin accused hip hop artist Akon of degrading women in a HotAir YouTube video in May 2007. Following this, Akon's record label, Universal Music Group (UMG), issued a DMCA takedown notice removing the video. UMG retracted the notice after the Electronic Frontier Foundation joined Malkin in contesting the removal as a misuse of copyright law. MichelleMalkin.com was revamped and moved to a larger server on WordPress in June 2007.Malkin, Michelle. \"Welcome to the new michellemalkin.com!\",\"MichelleMalkin.com\", June 19, 2007. Malkin has also been a contributor to anti-immigration website VDARE. ===Jamil Hussein=== Malkin was among the first of several bloggers who questioned the credibility and even the existence of Iraqi police Captain \"Jamil Hussein\" who had been used as a source by the Associated Press in over 60 stories about the Iraq war. The controversy started in November 2006 when the AP reported that six Iraqis had been burned alive as they left a mosque and that four mosques had been destroyed, citing Hussein as one of its sources. In January 2007, Malkin visited Baghdad, and stated, \"the Iraqi Ministry of Interior says disputed Associated Press source Jamil Hussein does exist. At least one story he told the AP just doesn't check out: The Sunni mosques that as Hussein claimed and AP reported as 'destroyed,' 'torched' and 'burned and blown up' are all still standing. So the credibility of every AP story relying on Jamil Hussein remains dubious.\"Malkin, Michelle. \"Fact-checking the AP and Jamil Hussein\", MichelleMalkin.com, January 21, 2007. Malkin has since issued a correction for her denial of Hussein's existence, \"I relayed information from multiple sources\u2014CPATT, Centcom, and two other military sources on the ground in Iraq\u2014that the Associated Press's disputed source, Jamil Hussein, could not be found.\" [...] \"I regret the error,\" but still contested AP claims of destroyed mosques and civilians burned alive. ===Students Against War controversy=== In April 2006, Students Against War (SAW), a campus group at University of California, Santa Cruz, staged a protest against the presence of military recruiters on campus, and sent out a press release containing contact details (names, phone numbers and e-mail addresses) of three student leaders for use by reporters. Malkin included these contact details in a blog column entitled \"Seditious Santa Cruz vs. America\". Malkin claimed the contact information was originally taken from SAW's own website, but that later SAW had removed it and had \"wiped\" the \"cached version\". The students asked Malkin to remove the contact details from her blog, but Malkin reposted them several times writing in her blog: \"I am leaving it up. If you are contacting them, I do not condone death threats or foul language. As for SAW, my message is this: You are responsible for your individual actions. Other individuals are responsible for theirs. Grow up and take responsibility.\" SAW remarked: \"Due to the continued irresponsible actions of some bloggers, members of the group have received numerous death threats and anti-Semitic comments through phone calls and emails.\" Students Against The War. \"Far-Right Threats Fail to Distract from Santa Cruz Protest Successes\", April 19, 2006, A blog war ensued. Malkin claimed that she received hostile e-mails, then her private home address, phone number, photos of her neighborhood and maps to her house were published on several websites. The Santa Cruz Sentinel reported receiving an email from Malkin saying that this forced her to remove one of her children from school and move her family. Another controversy involving private addresses began on July 1, 2006, when Malkin and other bloggers commented on a New York Times Travel section article that had featured the town where Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld owned summer homes. The article included a picture of Rumsfeld's long tree-lined driveway that showed a birdhouse and small portion of the housefront. Malkin declared that this story was part of \"a concerted, organized effort to dig up and publicize the private home information of prominent conservatives in the media and blogosphere to intimidate them.\" The photos of Rumsfeld's house were taken with Rumsfeld's permission. ==Views== ===Immigration=== Although herself the child of immigrant parents and citizens of the Philippines, Malkin opposes birthright citizenship to U.S.-born children of foreign tourists, temporary foreign workers, and undocumented immigrants. She claims this undermines the integrity of citizenship and national security, and argues that the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, \"originally intended to ensure the citizenship rights of newly freed slaves and their families after the Civil War, has evolved into a magnet for alien lawbreakers and a shield for terrorist infiltrators and enemy combatants\".Malkin, Michelle. \"What makes an American?\", Jewish World Review, July 4, 2003. Retrieved July 18, 2009. This is in direct conflict with her own experience as Malkin automatically became a citizen under the same Fourteenth Amendment when she was born in Pennsylvania to parents who were Philippine citizens. Her parents, a physician and a teacher, were here on an employer- sponsored visa. Malkin also opposes sanctuary cities, in which local authorities limit cooperation with national immigration agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).Malkin, Michelle. \"Sanctuary Nation or Sovereign Nation: It\u2019s your choice\" , \"MichelleMalkin.com\", August 15, 2007. Retrieved December 4, 2009.

In 2019, Malkin gave a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) condemning politicians, including the \"ghost\" of recently deceased Senator John McCain, for failing to enact stricter immigration regulation. ===Unemployment benefits=== During an appearance as a news analyst on the roundtable segment of ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on August 2, 2009, she explained why she opposed another 13-week extension of unemployment benefits: \"If you put enough government cheese in front of people they are going to just keep eating it and kicking the can down the road... people will just delay getting a job until the three weeks before the benefits run out.\" ===Women's issues=== In a February 2012 column, Malkin called the \"War on Women\" a false narrative, arguing rather that \"It's the progressive left in this country that has viciously and systematically slimed female conservatives for their beliefs.\" === Daniel Holtzclaw === Malkin took a special interest in the conviction of Daniel Holtzclaw, whom she advocates as innocent. She has dedicated a significant amount of time and effort to his case, authoring multiple videos and articles on the various issues in his case. ===Legalization of cannabis=== Malkin is a proponent of legalizing the medical use of cannabis, dating back to 1998 when she argued in favor of the passage of Washington State's Initiative 692. She also criticized the war on drugs as a \"dismal, costly, inefficient failure\" in a 1997 column titled \"Liberty Is Biggest Loser In Nation's War On Drugs\". In a 2014 interview Malkin said she was \"grateful\" for the passage of Colorado's Amendment 64 (legalizing recreational use), as it allowed her ailing mother-in-law to easily obtain cannabis. === Support for Holocaust deniers === In 2020, Malkin faced criticism for speaking at a conference hosted by far-right former YouTuber Nick Fuentes and Patrick Casey, head of the neo-Nazi organization known as the American Identity Movement (formerly Identity Evropa). At the conference, Malkin said it was \"not anti-semitic\" to question \"whatever the precise number of people is who perished in World War II.\" Malkin was dropped by the conservative YAF organization for her support of Fuentes, who has also denied the Holocaust. ==Personal life== While in college at Oberlin, she began dating Jesse Malkin.Kelley, Debbie (September 9, 2019). \"Michelle Malkin, the Conservative Pundit of El Paso County, Isn't Going Silent\".

She denied allegations that she had been insensitive to the \"plight of minorities\", listing several racial epithets that had been used against her, and by relating a lesson she learned from her mother for which she is \"eternally grateful\". When in kindergarten, Malkin went home in tears one day because her classmates had called her a racist name.
