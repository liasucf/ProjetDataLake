    "text": "Reseda , also known as the mignonette , is a genus of fragrant herbaceous plants native to Europe, southwest Asia and North Africa, from the Canary Islands and Iberia east to northwest India. The genus includes herbaceous annual, biennial and perennial species 40\u2013130 cm tall. The leaves form a basal rosette at ground level, and then spirally arranged up the stem; they can be entire, toothed or pinnate, and range from 1\u201315 cm long. The flowers are produced in a slender spike, each flower small (4\u20136 mm diameter), white, yellow, orange, or green, with four to six petals. The fruit is a small dry capsule containing several seeds. Other common names include weld or dyer's rocket (for R. luteola), and bastard rocket. ==Cultivation and uses== Propagation is by seed, which is surface-sown directly into the garden or grass verge. The plant does not take well to transplanting and should not be moved after sowing. Mignonette flowers are extremely fragrant. It is grown for the sweet ambrosial scent of its flowers. It is used in flower arrangements, perfumes and potpourri. A Victorian favourite, it was commonly grown in pots and in window-boxes to scent the city air. It was used as a sedative and a treatment for bruises in Roman times. The volatile oil is used in perfumery. The yellow dye was obtained from the roots of R. luteola by the first millennium BC, and perhaps earlier than either woad or madder. Use of this dye came to an end at the beginning of the twentieth century, when cheaper synthetic yellow dyes came into use. Charles Darwin used R. odorata in his studies of self-fertilised plants, which he documented in The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom. ==Species== The Plant List recognises 41 accepted species (including infraspecific names): * Reseda alba White Mignonette ** subsp. myriosperma * Reseda arabica * Reseda aucheri * Reseda barrelieri * Reseda bucharica * Reseda complicata Glaucous Mignonette * Reseda decursiva * Reseda ellenbeckii * Reseda glauca * Reseda globulosa * Reseda gredensis * Reseda inodora * Reseda jacquinii ** subsp. litigiosa * Reseda lanceolata * Reseda lutea Wild Mignonette ** subsp. neglecta * Reseda luteola Weld ** subsp. biaui * Reseda media * Reseda minoica * Reseda muricata * Reseda odorata Common Mignonette * Reseda orientalis * Reseda paui ** subsp. almijarensis * Reseda phyteuma Corn Mignonette ** subsp. collina * Reseda pruinosa * Reseda scoparia Canaries Mignonette * Reseda stenostachya * Reseda stricta * Reseda suffruticosa ** subsp. barrelieri * Reseda tymphaea ** subsp. anatolica * Reseda undata ** subsp. gayana ** subsp. leucantha * Reseda urnigera * Reseda villosa * Reseda virgata * Reseda viridis ==References== ==External links== *Data sheet with pictures of weld (Reseda luteola L.)
