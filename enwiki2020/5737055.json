    "text": "The Copper-Roof Palace () is an 18th-century palace in Warsaw, Poland. It takes its name (which is less precisely phrased in the original Polish) from the copper roof, a rarity in the first half of the 18th century. Since 1989 the Palace has been a branch of the Royal Castle Museum. The palace is contiguous with Warsaw's Royal Castle, and down a slope from Castle Square and Warsaw's Old Town. Beneath the palace, a 17th-century lodge still exists. ==History== The original patrician house of Wawrzyniec Reffus was built in 1651-56. After its 1657 destruction by the army of George II R\u00e1k\u00f3czi, it was completely remodeled in 1698-1701 for Jerzy Dominik Lubomirski. Lubomirski built on a southern wing, perpendicular to the rest of the structure, and expanded the western elevation. Soon after, the palace came to be called Palais Martin after Lubomirski's grandson. In 1720 the palace was rebuilt with the addition of a second, northern wing; and the interior was decorated with rococo paintings. After 1777 the palace passed into the possession of Poland's last king, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, who hired the architect Domenico Merlini to redesign the rooms and to join the Royal Castle's library wing to it. The King then presented the redecorated palace to his nephew, Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski. The Prince was a successful commander in the 1794 Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising, and later one of Napoleon Bonaparte's marshals. Under the Prince's ownership, the Palace became a center of Warsaw's high-class social scene. When Warsaw became part of the Kingdom of Prussia after the Third Partition of Poland (1795), the Palace became a Prussian Ministry of War headquarters. The Copper-Roof Palace was deliberately burned in 1944 by the occupying Germans. In 1948-49 it was reconstructed, based on 18th-century paintings by Bernardo Bellotto. The palace is now a museum, part of Warsaw's Royal Castle, and hosts a historic library and a permanent exhibit of oriental rugs. ==Gallery== File:Palac pod Blacha 001.jpg|Southern facade File:Palac pod Blacha 002.jpg|Eastern facade, St. Anne's Church on the left, Royal Castle on the right File:Kolekcja Kobierc\u00f3w Wschodnich Pa\u0142ac pod Blach\u0105 01.JPG|Exhibition of oriental rugs File:Pok\u00f3j sypialny Pa\u0142ac pod Blach\u0105.JPG|Prince J\u00f3zef Poniatowski's bedroom File:Copper-Roof Palace, Warsaw.png File:Warszawa-pod Blach\u0105.jpg ==See also== * History of the Royal Castle in Warsaw * Library at the Royal Castle, Warsaw ==References== ::In-line: ==External links== * Pa\u0142ac pod Blach\u0105 *http://www.zamek-krolewski.pl/?page=1212 Category:Houses completed in 1730 Category:Palaces in Warsaw Category:Rococo architecture in Warsaw Category:Rebuilt buildings and structures in Poland Category:Baroque palaces Category:1730 establishments in Europe ",
