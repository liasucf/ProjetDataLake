    "text": "Miegunyah House in Bowen Hills, Queensland The Queensland Women's Historical Association is a historical society in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia which studies the history and heritage of Queensland, including its pioneer families and the contribution made by women. The association is headquartered at the heritage-listed house Miegunyah in Bowen Hills. ==History== Maryvale in 1963 The association was established in Brisbane in April 1950 as the Women's Historical Association. Its headquarters were at the heritage-listed Newstead House. In 1957 it was renamed the Queensland Women's Historical Association. From 1960 to 1983 the association placed plaques to commemorate historic sites associated with Queensland's history. In 1966, Newstead House was to be converted into a museum so the association required new headquarters. At the same time, a nearby historic house Miegunyah (then called Beverley Wood) in Bowen Hill was about to be demolished. Through a public appeal, the association raised the funds for a deposit to buy Miegunyah to restore it to its former glory. ==Current activities== The association continue to restore and maintain Miegunyah, which is open to the public as a museum and a venue for talks, exhibitions and social events. The association maintains a library and archive and publishes books. ==Plaques== Some of the plaques placed by the association include: * the monument at Lake Moogerah to the women of the Fassifern District * the Cactoblastis Memorial beside Myall Creek, Dalby commemorating the introduction of the Cactoblastis insect that helped eradicate the highly invasive prickly pear from Queensland farmland == Collection policy == Barrow and silver spade presented to Sir George Bowen, 1865 In the absence of a well-defined collection policy, over the years the association acquired via donations a number of items in its collection that did not fit its primary mission to collect and preserve women's history, often to save precious artifacts which might otherwise have been lost in the absence of other collecting organisations. Following the establishment of a collection policy and a review of the collection in 2016, it was decided some original items should be donated to more appropriate collections. In 1964, Roma Browne, granddaughter of the first Queensland Governor, George Bowen, donated a silver spade to the association. Bowen had used this spade to turn the first sod of the Queensland Northern Railway at Rockhampton on 27 September 1865 and had been presented with the spade as a souvenir of the occasion. In 2018, the association donated it to the State Library of Queensland. Also in 1964, Mrs Vernon Alford donated a parian ware vase to the association. It is believed to be a favourite wedding present of Mrs Louis Hope of Ormiston House. In 2018, it was donated to the Ormiston House Museum. ==Published works== Published works of the association include: * * * * * ==References== ==External links== * Category:Historical societies of Australia Category:1950 establishments in Australia Category:History of Queensland Category:Organizations established in 1950 Category:Women's organisations based in Australia Category:Organisations based in Queensland ",
