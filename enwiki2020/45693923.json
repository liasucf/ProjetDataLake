    "text": "Dean Stalham (born c. 1963) is a British self-taught artist, playwright and community activist from North London. He has spent time in prison for handling stolen artworks. Whilst serving time in Wandsworth Prison he won a prize for his art from the Koestler Trust. He founded the Art Saves Lives charitable organisation in 2007. In 2010 he wrote a play, God Don't Live on a Council Estate, and staged it using a tiny budget in an old council office building in New Cross. WhatsonStage.com described it as \"an emotionally gripping and riveting production\", while theguardian.com called it \"different\" and \"of high quality\". ==References== Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Artists from London Category:Founders of charities ",
