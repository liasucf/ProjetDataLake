    "text": "Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107 (, ; born 2 September 1973) is a Serbian former professional footballer and current manager. A former forward, after making a name for himself at Partizan, he signed for English club Aston Villa, before going on to spend the vast majority of his career in Spain, where he amassed La Liga totals of 91 goals in 241 games for four clubs including CA Osasuna. Over the course of his 16-year professional playing career, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 scored nearly 300 official goals in just over 660 appearances. At the international level, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played for the national team of FR Yugoslavia (later renamed Serbia and Montenegro), and Serbia, winning over 100 caps for both teams combined. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 appeared in two World Cups and one European Championship, at which he earned the Golden Boot at Euro 2000. ==Club career== ===Partizan=== Milo\u0161evi\u0107 started playing football at the age of 6 and spent his youth in the Drina Valley, until at 14 he was spotted by FK Partizan scouts, who convinced the club to secure his transfer for 5,000 Deutsche Mark. In 1992, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 made his senior debut for Partizan, scoring 14 goals in 31 games during his first season at the club. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 went on to score an impressive 21 and 30 league goals in his next two seasons respectively \u2013 competition-bests in both years \u2013 as the Belgrade club won back-to-back national championships, including the double in 1993\u201394. ===Aston Villa=== In the summer of 1995, then Aston Villa manager Brian Little bought Milo\u0161evi\u0107 from Partizan for \u00a33.5 million, a club record at the time. His spell in England lasted three seasons, during which time he earned the tabloid nickname \"Miss-a-lot-evi\u0107\" owing to his frequent goalscoring dry spells.The 10 worst foreign signings of all time; The Guardian, 6 August 2000 However, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 did score 34 goals in 117 games for the Villans (28 in the Premier League), including one in the 1995\u201396 Football League Cup final, a 3\u20130 win against Leeds United. ===Zaragoza=== Milo\u0161evi\u0107 signed for La Liga club Real Zaragoza in 1998 for 8.5 million pounds, again recording some impressive goalscoring performances, notably netting 21 in the 1999\u20132000 season as the team secured fourth position. ===Parma=== After rediscovering his form in Spain, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 joined Parma A.C. in the summer of 2000 for \u20ac25 million.D\u017eeko je kralj transfera SFRJ (D\u017eeko is the king of transfers in Yugoslavia); MTS Mondo, 7 January 2010 (in Serbian) He was a regular starter in his first season in Italy, playing in 21 out of 34 Serie A matches and scoring 8 goals; in the next season, however, he was sparingly used. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was loaned back to Spain in January 2002, re-joining his former club Zaragoza to replace Blackburn Rovers-bound Yordi. He scored six times during his second spell, finishing as the club's joint top scorer \u2013 alongside Yordi and Roberto Acu\u00f1a. His second spell at Zaragoza ended unsuccessfully, with the club eventually relegated. In the 2002\u201303 campaign, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 played for RCD Espanyol, again finishing as his team's top scorer but narrowly escaping relegation, a fate that would befall him the following year with Celta de Vigo. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was able to help Celta reach the round- of-16 in their first ever appearance in the UEFA Champions League, with his one goal in seven appearances in the competition coming in a 3\u20132 group stage home win against AFC Ajax. ===Later years=== Rubin Kazan (2008) In mid-July 2004, aged 30, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 signed a three-year contract with another Spanish top flight club, CA Osasuna. In his second season with the Navarrese, he scored 11 goals in 32 games to help the team qualify for the Champions League. Though Milo\u0161evi\u0107 failed to score in ten appearances in the subsequent UEFA Cup semifinal run, he did provide two assists in a 3\u20130 away win against Bayer 04 Leverkusen in the first leg of the quarterfinal (which Osasuna won 4\u20130 on aggregate). In the summer of 2007, Milo\u0161evi\u0107's contract expired and he left Osasuna after 3 seasons at the club. He took a six-month break from competitive football, during which time he had a trial with Major League Soccer's Toronto FC with a view of signing with them for the 2008 season. The deal fell through and, on 8 March 2008, he agreed terms with FC Rubin Kazan prior to the start of the Russian Premier League campaign. On 2 November 2008, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 scored the decisive goal for Rubin in a game against FC Saturn Ramenskoye, securing the team their first ever national championship. He retired shortly afterwards, aged 35. ==International career== He played on 1992 Toulon Tournament and reached the finals with the team.https://web.archive.org/web/20131006071956/http://www.festival-foot- espoirs.com/archive-festival-foot/archive-festival- foot.php?annee=1992&id;=20&content;=equipes Milo\u0161evi\u0107 earned 102 caps for Serbia, making his international debut for the nation (then named Federal Republic of Yugoslavia) on 23 December 1994, in a 0\u20132 friendly loss in Brazil. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 scored 37 goalsSavo Milosevic \u2013 Goals in International Matches; at RSSSF for his country over the course of a 14-year international career. After appearing in two games at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 scored five goals at UEFA Euro 2000, earning him the Golden Boot, an award he shared with Dutch forward Patrick Kluivert. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 made his 100th international appearance on 16 June 2006 during the FIFA World Cup in Germany, in a 0\u20136 group stage loss against Argentina, and in doing so became the most capped player in Serbian history. As a formal farewell from international football, he was called up for a friendly with Bulgaria on 19 November 2008, scoring twice and missing two penalties in a 6\u20131 win before being replaced by Dragan Mr\u0111a. ==Managerial career== ===Montenegro (assistant)=== From 2011 to 2012, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was an assistant manager to Branko Brnovi\u0107 at the Montenegro national team. ===Partizan=== On 27 March 2019, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was named by the board of directors at FK Partizan as the club's new manager, with his first win as Partizan's manager came on 3 April 2019, in a 3\u20132 home win against FK \u010cukari\u010dki. In Milo\u0161evi\u0107's first Eternal derby as manager of Partizan, his team suffered a 2\u20131 away loss to Red Star Belgrade, with Ricardo Gomes's 90th minute strike proving only a consolation. At the end of his first season in charge, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 succeeded in qualifying Partizan for the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League qualifying rounds, and on 23 May 2019, won his first managerial trophy as his Partizan side beat Red Star Belgrade 0\u20131 in the 2018\u201319 Serbian cup final, courtesy of a Bojan Ostoji\u0107 goal. In July and August 2019, Partizan secured their ninth participation in the group stages of UEFA Europa League. Under Milo\u0161evi\u0107's leadership, Partizan knocked-out Connah's Quay Nomads F.C. (1\u20130, 3\u20130), Yeni Malatyaspor (3\u20131, 0\u20131) and Molde (2\u20131, 1\u20131) in the qualifiers. On 30 August, Partizan was drawn in to Group L of the 2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League, alongside Manchester United, FC Astana and AZ Alkmaar. ==Personal life== Milo\u0161evi\u0107 with former water polo player Aleksandar \u0160api\u0107 at a Democratic Party convention on 12 September 2009. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was born into an ethnic Serb family in the Semberija city of Bijeljina and was raised in Johovac, both in the then-SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia, where he lived with a younger brother Andrija (1975\u20132013) and younger sister Cvijeta \"Mira\". Milo\u0161evi\u0107's mother died in 2000 from cancer; he has paternal ancestry from the large Milo\u0161evi\u0107 brotherhood of the Vasojevi\u0107i tribe in northeastern Montenegro, and was a relative of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was a political supporter of the Democratic Party led by Boris Tadi\u0107, having supported it since 1993 after meeting with Zoran \u0110in\u0111i\u0107 and officially becoming a member in 2003. He took part in the 1996\u201397 protests and the 5 October Overthrow. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 is married to Vesna, with whom he had two sons, including Nikola, and a daughter. On 11 June 2011, his father Stevan \"Stevo\" (1953\u20132011) was shot in the chest and killed in the family house in Glavi\u010dice by his grandfather Savo (1928\u20132012), after a family row; the latter was later detained. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Partizan |1992\u201393 |rowspan=\"3\"|First League of FR Yugoslavia |31||14||8||3||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||39||17 |- |1993\u201394 |32||21||9||7||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||41||28 |- |1994\u201395 |35||30||4||4||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||39||34 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !98!!65!!21!!14!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!119!!79 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Aston Villa |1995\u201396 |rowspan=\"3\"|Premier League |37||12||5||1||7||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||49||14 |- |1996\u201397 |30||10||3||0||1||0||2Appearances in UEFA Cup||0||36||10 |- |1997\u201398 |23||7||2||1||1||0||6||1||32||9 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !90!!29!!10!!2!!9!!1!!8!!1!!117!!33 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Zaragoza |1998\u201399 |rowspan=\"2\"|La Liga |35||17||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||37||18 |- |1999\u20132000 |37||21||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||42||22 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !72!!38!!7!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!79!!40 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Parma |2000\u201301 |rowspan=\"2\"|Serie A |21||8||5||2||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||5||2||31||12 |- |2001\u201302 |10||1||3||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||6Four appearances and one goal in UEFA Cup, two appearances in UEFA Champions League||1||19||3 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !31!!9!!8!!3!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!11!!3!!50!!15 |- |Zaragoza (loan) |2001\u201302 |La Liga |16||6||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||16||6 |- |Espanyol (loan) |2002\u201303 |La Liga |34||12||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||35||12 |- |Celta (loan) |2003\u201304 |La Liga |37||14||5||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||9Appearances in UEFA Champions League||1||51||16 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Osasuna |2004\u201305 |rowspan=\"3\"|La Liga |27||6||7||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||34||6 |- |2005\u201306 |32||11||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||1||34||12 |- |2006\u201307 |23||4||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||12Ten appearances in UEFA Cup, two appearances in UEFA Champions League||0||36||4 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !82!!21!!8!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!14!!1!!104!!22 |- |Rubin Kazan |2008 |Russian Premier League |16||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||3 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !476!!197!!61!!22!!9!!1!!42!!6!!588!!226 |} ;Notes ===International=== *Includes caps for FR Yugoslavia (1994\u20132002), Serbia and Montenegro (2003\u20132006), and Serbia (2008). {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"15\"|FR Yugoslavia SCG Serbia |1994||1||0 |- |1995||7||4 |- |1996||7||5 |- |1997||9||5 |- |1998||11||2 |- |1999||7||4 |- |2000||12||6 |- |2001||8||5 |- |2002||9||1 |- |2003||10||1 |- |2004||7||2 |- |2005||8||0 |- |2006||5||0 |- |2007||0||0 |- |2008||1||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total!!102!!37 |} ====International goals==== *Scores and results list FR Yugoslavia/Serbia and Montenegro/Serbia's goal tally first.
