    "text": "Giorgetto Giugiaro (; born 7 August 1938) is an Italian automobile designer. He has worked on supercars and popular everyday vehicles. He was born in Garessio, Cuneo, Piedmont. Giugiaro was named Car Designer of the Century in 1999 and inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2002. In addition to cars, Giugiaro designed camera bodies for Nikon, Navigation promenade of Porto Santo Stefano, in 1983, the organ of the cathedral of Lausanne, composed of about 7000 pipes in 2003, and developed a new pasta shape \"Marille\", as well as office furniture for Okamura Corporation. ==Influence on design== Giugiaro's earliest cars, like the Alfa Romeo 105/115 Series Coup\u00e9s, often featured tastefully arched and curving shapes, such as the De Tomaso Mangusta, Iso Grifo, and Maserati Ghibli. In the late 1960s, Giugiaro made increasingly angular designs, culminating in the \"folded paper\" era of the 1970s. Straight- lined designs such as the BMW M1, Lotus Esprit S1, and Maserati Bora followed. He changed again during the early 1990s, introducing a more curvy approach with his Lamborghini Cal\u00e0, Maserati Spyder, and Ferrari GG50. Giugiaro is widely known for the DMC DeLorean. Notable in its own time for its unique design, the car was prominently featured in the Hollywood blockbuster movie series Back to the Future. His most commercially successful design was the Volkswagen Golf Mk1. In 1976, Giugiaro explored a new taxi concept with the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), which became the 1978 Lancia Megagamma concept. Fiat had commissioned the 1978 concept from Italdesign, asking for a 4-meter, high roof, high h-point, multi-functional, monospace design -- but ultimately decided the concept was too risky for production. In retrospect the Megagamma was more influential than successful in its own right. It is considered the \"conceptual birth mother of the MPV/minivan movement.\" it influenced design of such mini/compact MPVs as the Nissan Prairie (1981) and Fiat 500L (2011), as well as larger MPVs, including the Renault Espace and Chrysler minivans. ===Studios=== * Fiat Special Vehicle Design (1955\u20131959) * Bertone (1959\u20131965) * Ghia (1965\u20131967) * Italdesign Giugiaro
