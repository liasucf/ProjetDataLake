Twelve seats (eight district representatives and four at-large members) were contested in the general election, as the incumbent in district 3 was unopposed. Eight seats (the four at-large members, and districts 1, 4, 5, and 8) had also been contested in the preliminary election held on September 24, 2013. ==At-large== Councillors Ayanna Pressley and Stephen J. Murphy were re-elected, while the seats formerly held by John R. Connolly and Felix G. Arroyo were won by Michael F. Flaherty and Michelle Wu. Connolly and Arroyo did not seek re- election, as they ran for Mayor of Boston; Arroyo was eliminated in the preliminary election, while Connolly was defeated by Marty Walsh in the general election. {| class=wikitable !colspan=1 rowspan=2 |Candidates !colspan=2 |Preliminary Election !colspan=2 |General Election |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- | Ayanna Pressley | align=\"right\" | 42,915 | align=\"right\" | 16.71% | align=\"right\" | 60,799 | align=\"right\" | 18.30% |- | Michelle Wu | align=\"right\" | 29,384 | align=\"right\" | 11.44% | align=\"right\" | 59,741 | align=\"right\" | 17.98% |- | Michael F.
