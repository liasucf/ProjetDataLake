    "text": "Daniel Weinstein (born February 4, 1981) is a retired American short track speed skating competitor and two-time Olympian. ==Biography== Of the handful of Jewish-American Olympians who competed in the 1998 Winter Olympics at Nagano, Japan, Weinstein was by far the youngest. At 17 years of age, he was not only the youngest athlete on the U.S. speedskating team, he was also the youngest man on the entire U.S. Winter Olympics Team. Four years later, Weinstein competed in the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah. Weinstein has won multiple individual distance US Championships, and he won the men's overall title at the 2000 U.S. Short Track Speedskating Championships. In 1994, Weinstein was the youngest person to ever skate in the Olympic trials, but he placed poorly. Raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, he began skating at age eight, after his parents saw an article about local speedskating in the Boston Globe. He completed his bachelor's degree at Harvard University in 2004, and his MBA at The Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth in 2009. ==See also== *List of select Jewish speed skaters ==References== ==Sources== * Jewish Sports profile * Dan Weinstein '03: Go Speed Racer Go, Harvard Crimson, March 2, 2000 (via Google Cache) Category:1981 births Category:Living people Category:American male short track speed skaters Category:Olympic short track speed skaters of the United States Category:Short track speed skaters at the 1998 Winter Olympics Category:Short track speed skaters at the 2002 Winter Olympics Category:People from Brookline, Massachusetts Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Jewish American sportspeople Category:American male speed skaters Category:Tuck School of Business alumni ",
