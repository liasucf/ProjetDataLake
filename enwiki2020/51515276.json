Disposal: The Principal Officers and Commissioners of His Majesty's Navy first offered \"Swallow, 381 Tons, Copper-Bottomed and Copper-fastened, lying at Portsmouth\" for sale on 7 August 1802. She sold there that month. ==Privateer and whaler== \"Metcalf\" purchased Swallow.Lloyd's Register (1803), Supplement, Seq. \u2116S42. Her master was David Smyth Simmons (or David Symonds Smith, or C.F. Smith). David Smyth Simmons received a letter of marque on 1 June 1803. She then sailed on 26 June.British Southern Whale Fishery Database - Voyages: Swallow. Around 15 May 1804 Swallow sent the French whaler Hero (H\u00e9ros) into Falmouth.Lloyd's List 22 May 1804, \u21164455. During the Peace of Amiens, the French resumed whaling and on 10 February 1803 Captain Stephen Rawson sailed Hero from Le Havre for Walvis Bay, where she stayed for a month from 24 May to 23 June. Hero sailed in company with Baleine, of Le Havre, Captain Reuben Baxter. Between 10 July and 15 August they cruised the coast, but after having gathered only 200 barrels of oil, they sailed first to St Helena and then to St Catherine, Brazil. Swallow captured both Hero and Baleine. Swallow was reported to have arrived at Rio de Janeiro on 17 August 1804. As noted earlier, Swallow took Hero back to Britain. Swallow apparently abandoned Baleine, though in what state, and what happened to her subsequently, is not clear. There are accounts that Swallow engaged in whaling in 1807 and 1809-10. Although there is no record of her in Lloyd's Register after 1805, she does appear in the Register of Shipping in 1809 with F. Smyth, master, Metcalf, owner, and trade London-South Seas fisheries.Register of Shipping (1809), Seq.\u2116780. She is last listed in 1810 with the same information. ==Notes, citations, and references== Notes Citations References * * * * * * * * * Category:1795 ships Category:Brig- sloops of the Royal Navy Category:Privateer ships of the United Kingdom Category:Whaling ships Swa ",
