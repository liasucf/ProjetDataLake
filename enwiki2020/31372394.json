Guardian was a gift to the people of San Francisco by anonymous donors following the notable role of the fireboat Phoenix in helping to save the Marina District buildings from further destruction by fire following the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Both Guardian and Phoenix fireboats are based at Firehouse No. 35 at Pier 22\u00bd of the Port of San Francisco. Guardian has 5 pumps which can deliver up to 26,000 gallons of water per minute, significantly more than Phoenix ==History== Guardian was built by Yarrows, LTD of British Columbia in 1951 and was hull number 115. Guardian served the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada from 1951 until the time it was retired in 1987 by Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services under the name Fireboat #2. Though the city of San Francisco had operated two fireboats from the early 1900 until 1954, the Phoenix was the only fireboat in the city from 1955 until the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. Because of the role of Phoenix in the protection of the Marina District after the 1989 earthquake, $50,000 from grateful Marina property owners and $300,000 from anonymous donors were used purchase and refurbish Guardian. Upon arrival in San Francisco, the ship was rechristened Guardian, a name chosen by the school children of San Francisco at the request of the anonymous donors. thumb Both Guardian and Phoenix are based at Pier 22 1/2. In 1999, Firehouse 35 at Pier 22 1/2 was declared San Francisco's 225th Historic Landmark. ==Crew and maintenance== Guardian has operated in San Francisco since 1990 in an unmanned reserve status. Firehouse 35 on Pier 22\u00bd has seven crew on duty at all times: four to serve Engine #35, and three dedicated to the two fireboats. All seven are able to man the fireboats in an emergency. Although, having the reserve fireboat manned by recalled personnel (if available) is desirable. It is the most powerful fireboat in the world in terms of water pumping capacity, 26,000 gallons per minute ==References== * Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services * http://www.baycrossings.com/dispnews.asp?id=1515 ==External links== * http://guardiansofthecity.org/sffd/fireboats/guardian.html *SF Phoenix fireboat Category:Fireboats of California Category:1951 ships ",
