It is the place where the Chilean Central Valley meets the Pacific Ocean. The Calbuco Archipelago comprises the islands in the sound, including Tenglo, Maill\u00e9n, and Huar Islands. Puluqui Island and Queul\u00edn Island separate the sound from the Gulf of Ancud. The Carretera Austral runs along the eastern shore of the sound, but is interrupted in the area where the Reloncav\u00ed Estuary opens into this wide sound. Located in this same area is the Alerce Andino National Park, home to ancient alerce trees. There is a Ferry service available between La Arena and Puelche Fishing Creeks operated by www.transportesdelestuario.cl ==References== Category:Landforms of Los Lagos Region Category:Sounds of Chile ",
