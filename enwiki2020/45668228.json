The tournament was originally going to be held in Nepal, but was moved to Malaysia due to the April 2015 earthquake. Nepal defeated Ireland in the tournament final to qualify for the 2016 Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. In January 2016, Australia withdrew their team from the World Cup and Ireland, as runners-up in the qualifier, replaced them. ==Teams== The second-placed teams at each of the five regional qualifying tournaments progressed to the qualifier: * \u2013 runner-up in 2014 ACC Under-19 Premier League(16 November 2014). \"Nepal remain in hunt for U-19 World Cup\" \u2013 eKantipur.com.
