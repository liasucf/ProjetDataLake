    "text": "Maite Pagazaurtund\u00faa (MEP) Mar\u00eda Teresa Pagazaurtund\u00faa Ruiz (born in 1965 in Hernani, Guipuzcoa), better known as Maite Pagazaurtund\u00faa or Maite Pagaza, is a Spanish politician, activist and writer. She is currently a Member of the European Parliament, and spokesperson of Uni\u00f3n Progreso y Democracia in the European Parliament. She was born and grew up in a small village in the Basque Country. She studied Basque and Spanish Philology at the University of Deusto. Her mother was a war refugee who later became an activist for freedom in the Basque Country. One of her siblings, Joseba Pagazaurtund\u00faa, was murdered by ETA in 2003 after suffering threats, harassment and aggressions for years. She is married and has two daughters. She had to leave the Basque Country, encouraged by the police, after years of harassment, persecution and aggressions, and especially after her brother's murder. == Activism == Maite Pagaza is a reference for freedom and Human Rights activism, as well as in the fight against terrorism and fanaticism. She took part in different social movements and initiatives in favour of freedom both in Spain and abroad. In 2005 she was part of a list of 1000 women nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. === Against ETA === She is a prominent figure within civic movements supporting victims of terrorism in Spain. She was the President of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism and of the victims of terrorism collective in the Basque Country COVITE. Her achievements earned her several recognitions, such as the prestigious Sakharov Prize for Human Rights in the year 2000 -as member of \u00a1Basta Ya!- or the Medal of the Order of Constitutional Merit in 2003. Her public stance in the frontline of the fight against terrorism came with a price: she had to live for 13 years with police escort, suffer years of harassment, threats, aggressions and both physical and psychological violence, and leave her home and resettle with her family outside the Basque Country. Maite Pagaza has kept her engagement with freedom in the Basque Country, justice for the victims of ETA and the regeneration of Basque society upon joining the European Parliament. Some of her works are reports such as \u201cDemocracy and freedom\u201d and \u201cLos profesores de la UPV-EHU contra ETA\u201d. === \u00a1Basta Ya! === In 1999, together with Basque intellectuals such as Fernando Savater, citizens and politicians, she took part in the founding of \u00a1Basta Ya!. They all shared the commitment to fight terrorism under any circumstance, to support its victims and to defend the Rule of Law, the Spanish Constitution and the Basque Country's Statute of Autonomy. Her brother, Joseba Pagazaurtund\u00faa, murdered by ETA in 2003, was also a member of \u00a1Basta Ya!. Amidst great hostility from the nationalist entourage in the Basque Country, \u00a1Basta Ya! engaged in new and dynamic ways to actively defend freedom against terrorism such as demonstrations, peace convoys, putting up of posters and an online publication. \u00a1Basta Ya! was awarded the prestigious Sakharov Price for Human Rights in the year 2000, becoming the first civic association to ever be awarded this recognition. === Joseba\u2019s Mailbox === In February 2015, on the 12th anniversary of her brother's murder by ETA, she and her family set up a white mailbox next to Agust\u00edn Ibarrola's homage sculpture to Joseba Pagazaurtund\u00faa in Andoain. The aim is to allow the hundreds of inhabitants of Andoain who asked of ETA to murder any neighbours who did not think like them to send letters to the mailbox -even anonymously- and hence acknowledge their part in the harassment and persecution of so many innocent people. The actual letterbox has an online version which makes it possible to have contributions from all over Spain, included those of Mario Vargas-Llosa and Fernando Savater. == Politics == === European Parliament === She was second in UPYD's list for the 2014 European Elections. She is a member of the Committee onCivil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), the Committee on Development (DEVE) and Human Rights (DROI) committee.

Pagazaurtund\u00faa is specialised in international terrorism, radicalisation and religious fanaticism, as well as in prevention of violent radicalisation and yihadism. She is supporting different causes at an international level, such as democracy and freedom in Venezuela or the Iranian opposition. === Foundation for Victims of Terrorism === She was the president of the Foundation for Victims of Terrorism from 2005 to 2012.

She distanced herself from the party when it tried to get closer to the Basque Nationalist Party and with Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero's anti-terrorism policies. == Writing == Maite Pagazaurtund\u00faa has written several books: * The Pagazas Story of a Basque family (Temas de Hoy, 2004), a biographical work depicting the story of her family and how they lived her brother's murder. * The sensitive widower and other secrets (Seix Barral, 2005), a compilation of short stories. * Aralda (Espasa, 2010) * Operaci\u00f3n Cochinillo (Editorial Espasa, 2014), a satirical work about corruption in Spain. * Lluvia de fango (Confluencias, 2016): a compilation of his press articles in the Basque press.
