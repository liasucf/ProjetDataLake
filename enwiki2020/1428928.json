He is also known for his portrayal of Harvey Lipschultz, a crotchety history teacher, on the television series Boston Public. ==Early life== Philip Finkel was born at home in Brownsville, Brooklyn, the third of four sons of Jewish immigrant parents, Mary (\"Miryam\"), a housewife from Minsk, Belarus, and Harry (\"Cwi Hirsh\") Finkel, a tailor from Warsaw.

In 2008 he recalled: > I played child parts till I was 14, 15, then my voice changed. So I decided > to learn a trade and went to a vocational high school in New York. I studied > to be a furrier, but I never worked at it. As soon as I graduated high > school, I went to a stock company in Pittsburgh, a Jewish theater, and I > played there for 38 weeks, and that's where I actually learned my trade a > little bit as an adult.
