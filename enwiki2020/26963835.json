He played for his local team, Stockton, before signing for FA Cup-holders Bradford City in December 1911. He made his Football League First Division debut the following season, but played only seven League games for Bradford City, scoring twice, before moving down to the Second Division with Lincoln City for a fee of \u00a3600 in February 1914. He went straight into the first team, and by the time the First World War put a stop to League football, he had played 45 games. He played for Lincoln City regularly in the wartime competitions, and also made guest appearances for former club Bradford City. In 1919\u201320, the first post-war season, Chesser was Lincoln City's leading scorer, though with only eight goals as the club finished in 21st place in the League and failed to be re-elected. Chesser moved to Merthyr Town, founder members of the newly formed Football League Third Division South. He stayed only one season with the club, but became part of their history by scoring the winning goal in their first Football League game, a 2\u20131 win at home to Crystal Palace. In 1921 he joined Wigan Borough, again for their first season in the Football League as founder members of the Third Division North. He played 13 League games before returning to Lincoln City, but made no more first-team appearances for the latter club. Chesser died on 27 October 1949 aged 56. ==References== Category:1893 births Category:1949 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Stockton-on-Tees Category:Footballers from County Durham Category:English footballers Category:Association football forwards Category:Stockton F.C. players Category:Bradford City A.F.C. players Category:Lincoln City F.C. players Category:Merthyr Town F.C. players Category:Wigan Borough F.C. players Category:English Football League players ",
