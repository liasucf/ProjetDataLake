    "text": "Rosa 'Just Joey', (aka CANjujo ), is an apricot blend hybrid tea rose cultivar, bred by Roger Pawsey and named in honor of his wife, Joey. The plant was introduced into the United Kingdom by Cants of Colchester rose growers in 1972. 'Just Joey' was inducted into the Rose Hall of Fame as \"World's Favourite Rose\" in 1994. ==History== Cants of Colchester, the oldest firm of commercial rose growers in Great Britain, was founded by Benjamin Cant in 1765. The nursery, 'Benjamin R Cant & Sons', was located in Mile End, now a northern suburb of Colchester. The firm originally sold a variety of plants, seeds, bulbs and trees. With the rise in popularity of roses in the mid 1800s, Benjamin R. Cant (1827-1900) initiated a rose breeding program at the nursery in 1875. By 1880, Cant had become a very successful rose exhibitor in England. Cant's nephew, Frank Cant (1857-1928), left the family business to establish his own nursery in Colchester in the early 1880s. The two Cant families became fierce competitors. The rivalry between the two nurseries lasted until the 1960s, when their descendants decided to merge the two family businesses into one company. The 'Benjamin R Cant & Sons' of Mile End Colchester and 'Frank Cant & Company' of Stanway, Essex became the 'Cants of Colchester' under the leadership of Cant family descendant, Roger Pawsey. Cants of Colchester has introduced several popular rose varieties, including Rosa 'English Miss', Rosa 'Alpine Sunset' and Rosa 'Goldstar'. 'Just Joey' was bred by Roger Pawsey and named in honor of his wife, Joey. The cultivar was created from parent hybrid tea roses, 'Fragrant Cloud' and 'Dr. A.J. Verhage'. The plant was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1972. 'Just Joey' was used to hybridize the following plants: Rosa 'Abbaye de Cluny', (1995), Rosa 'Apricot Candy', (2006), Rosa 'Bronze Star', (2000). 'Just Joey' was inducted into the Rose Hall of Fame as \"World's Favourite Rose\" in 1994. ==Description== 'Just Joey' is a tall, upright shrub, 5 to 6 ft (152\u2014182 cm) in height with a 3 to 4 ft (90\u2014121 cm) spread.
