    "text": "Music published by Leo Feist. Artwork by H.H. Warner The Greenwich Village Follies was a musical revue that played for eight seasons in New York City from 1919 to 1927. Launched by John Murray Anderson,Green, Stanley. Broadway Musicals Show by Show. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Books, 1985, 31. and opening on July 15, 1919, at the newly-constructed Greenwich Village Theatre near Christopher Street, the show's success has been credited in part to its timing: as a non-union production, it was unaffected by the then-current actors' strike.Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, 342. ==From downtown to uptown== Though considered a pioneer in the history of Off-Broadway musicals,Hischak, Thomas S. Off-Broadway Musicals Since 1919: From Greenwich Village Follies to The Toxic Avenger. Lanham, MD: Scarecrow Press, 2011 this annual revue actually spent very little time in its original downtown home. The first edition moved uptown soon after its opening, as did the second. By the third year, the revue simply skipped its native venue and opened at the Shubert Theatre.Green, Stanley. Broadway Musicals Show by Show. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Books, 1985, 31. Typically, after a run in New York, an adapted version of the show toured the country. ==Rival revues== To the dismay of rival impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Anderson changed the last word of his title from \u201cNights\u201d to \u201cFollies.\u201d Ziegfeld did not take Anderson to court, but in the decade to come, the two Broadway moguls were often compared.New-York Tribune, August 31, 1920, 6. Like Ziegfeld\u2019s famous Follies, Anderson\u2019s revue boasted of lavish curtains,New York Times, July 16, 1919 original scores, comedy sketches, and, of course, a bevy of beautiful girls. Other peers included George White, with his Scandals; and Earl Carroll, with his Vanities. ==Featured acts== The first star of The Greenwich Village Follies was Ziegfeld-veteran Bessie McCoy Davis. She made several appearances in the first edition, including one as a marionette. While singing \u201cI\u2019m the Hostess of the Bum Cabaret,\u201d she spoofed the recently-ratified Eighteenth Amendment.New York Times, July 16, 1919 The names at the top of the marquee changed from season to season. In a 1924 number titled \u201cThe Dollies and the Collies,\u201d trained dogs danced alongside vaudeville's celebrated Dolly Sisters.Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, 393. Specialty acts included circus veterans, such as the wire-walking Bird MillmanNew York Herald, September 1, 1921, 9.; female impersonators, such as Bert SavoyNew- York Tribune, August 31, 1920, 6.; and even blackface comics, such as Al HermanNew York Herald, September 1, 1921, 9. and comedy team of Moran and Mack. In later editions, aspiring dancers Martha Graham and Agnes DeMille made appearances.Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, 380/536. ==Music and dance== In 1919, a critic for The New York Times commended the collective singing talent of the cast: not only did a male quartet provide harmony, the beautiful girls who had no other obligation than to be beautiful proved to have beautiful voices as well.New York Times, July 16, 1919 The following season, another newspaper critic extended high praise to the show\u2019s choreography.New-York Tribune, August 31, 1920, 6. A year after that, however, a critic decried the show\u2019s over-reliance on dance.New York Herald, September 13, 1922, 6. For nearly a decade, popular composers of the day, including Irving Berlin,Green, Stanley. Broadway Musicals Show by Show. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Books, 1985, 31. Cole Porter, and Richard Rodgers,Bordman, Gerald. American Musical Theatre: A Chronicle. New York: Oxford University Press, 1978, 393. contributed tunes; but to the perpetual disappointment of the backers, the revue never seemed to produce any notable hits.Everett, William A., and Paul R. Laird. Historical Dictionary of the Broadway Musical. London: Rowman & Littlefield, 2016, 325. ==Distinguishing qualities== True to its bohemian roots, the revue came to be distinguished by its socially- and intellectually-provocative content.Green, Stanley. Broadway Musicals Show by Show. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Books, 1985, 31. Even so, the material appealed to the eye as well as the brain. Anderson was often noted for his striking stage pictures and his novel lighting effects.New-York Tribune, August 31, 1920, 6. Not surprisingly, the ballad ballet became a staple of the revue. Popular stories, such as Oscar Wilde\u2019s \u201cThe Nightingale and the Rose\u201dNew York Herald, September 13, 1922, 6. and Edgar Allan Poe's \u201cThe Raven,\u201d provided inspiration for these wordless interludes. ==Decline== By the late 1920s, the Broadway revue was losing patrons to story-driven book musicals like Show Boat. Anderson left the show after 1924,Green, Stanley. Broadway Musicals Show by Show. Milwaukee: Hal Leonard Books, 1985, 31. and the franchise went into hibernation during the seasons of 1926 and 1927. The last year the revue was produced on Broadway was 1928. At the onset of the Great Depression, the modest and short-lived Greenwich Village Theatre was demolished. ==Reinvention== In July of 2011, the Manhattan Theatre Source reimagined The Greenwich Village Follies as an exploration of local history. Like its predecessor, this production paid homage to members of the cultural avant-garde, such as Edna St. Vincent Millay and Jackson Pollock; it also tackled gritty subjects, such as the Stonewall Uprising of 1969.Gates, Anita.
