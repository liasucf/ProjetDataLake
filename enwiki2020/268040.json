    "text": "Ghent University (, abbreviated as UGent) is a public research university located in Ghent, Belgium. It was established in 1817 by King William I of the Netherlands. After the Belgian revolution of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer the university. In 1930, the university became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium, whereas French had previously been the standard academic language in what was Universit\u00e9 de Gand. In 1991, it was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from State University of Ghent (, abbreviated as RUG) to its current designation. In contrast to the Catholic University of Leuven or the Free University of Brussels, UGent considers itself a pluralist university in a special sense, i.e. not connected to any particular religion or political ideology. Its motto Inter Utrumque ('In Between Both Extremes'), on the coat of arms, suggests the acquisition of wisdom and science comes only in an atmosphere of peace, when the institution is fully supported by the monarchy and fatherland. Ghent University is one of the biggest Flemish universities, consisting of 44,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the University Library and the University Hospital, which is one of the largest hospitals in Belgium. It is one of the greatest beneficiaries of funding from the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO). Ghent University consistently rates among the top 100 universities in the world . == History == === Foundation, in the 19th century === Painting of the establishment of the State University of Ghent in 1817 when the city was under Dutch ruleThe university in Ghent was opened on October 9, 1817, with JC van Rotterdam serving as the first rector. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. The original four faculties consisted of Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine and Science, and the language of instruction was Latin. The university was founded by King William I as part of a policy to stem the intellectual and academic lag in the southern part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, later to become Belgium. After peaking at a student population of 414, the number of students declined quickly following the Belgian Revolution. At this time, the Faculties of Humanities and Science were broken from the university, but they were restored five years later, in 1835. Ghent University played a role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich August Kekul\u00e9 (7 September 1829 \u2013 13 July 1896) unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and Adolf von Baeyer (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of August Kekul\u00e9, made contributions to organic chemistry. In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at the university. French became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin, after the 1830 Revolution. In 1903, the Flemish politician Lodewijk De Raet led a successful campaign to begin instruction in Dutch, and the first courses were begun in 1906. left === Developments since the 20th century === Universiteitsforum 2010PM 0603 21H7975 During World War I, the occupying German administration conducted Flamenpolitik and turned Ghent University into the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. A Flemish Institute (Vlaemsche Hoogeschool), commonly known as Von Bissing University, was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and French language was fully reinstated. In 1923, Cabinet Minister Pierre Nolf put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch- speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. August Vermeylen served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.A Language Come Back, TIME Magazine, April 28, 1923 In the Second World War, the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists. After the war, the university became a much larger institution, following government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500. The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992. In the 1960s to 1980s, there were several student demonstrations at Ghent University, notably around the Blandijn site, which houses the Faculty of Arts & Philosophy. The severest demonstrations took place in 1969 in the wake of May 1968. In 1991, the university officially changed its name from Rijksuniversiteit Gent (RUG) to Universiteit Gent (UGent), following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the Flemish Community. The University in the City == Academic Profile == Aula academica === Organisation and structure === Ghent University consists of eleven Faculties with over 130 individual departments.

For instance, Ghent University supports the Belgian Co-ordinated Collections of Micro-organisms and the Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie. Within Europe, it is a member of the Santander Network and the U4 Network. It also participates in the Conference of European Schools for Advanced Engineering Education and Research. In addition, the University cooperates with numerous universities for the Erasmus and Erasmus Mundus programs; within the framework of the latter, it heads the International Master of Science in Rural Development and the International Master of Science in Soils and Global Change (IMSOGLO). Outside of Europe, Ghent University conducts exchange programs on all six continents. === Associated contributions and innovations === Ghent University has been instrumental in the development of COinS and Unipept. == Gallery == File:Rommelaere Instituut 2010PM 0261 21H7267.JPG|Rommelaere Instituut File:Faculteit Rechtsgeleerdheid 2010PM 1120 21H8919.JPG|Law School File:Rectoraat 2010PM 0217 21H7220.JPG|Rectorate File:Plantentuin 2010PM 1080 21H8867.JPG|Botanical garden File:Boekentoren ugent rozier 675.jpg|The Boekentoren, designed by Henry van de Velde, is one of the most famous university buildings File:Technicum 2010PM 0223 21H7226.JPG|The Technicum, or Faculty of Engineering File:Volderstraat aula UGent.jpg|Aula Academica File:Faculteit Bio-ingenieurswetenschapppen 2010PM 0299 21H7326.JPG|Faculty of Bioengineering File:Blandijn 2010PM 1039 21H8809.JPG|The Blandijn houses the Faculty of Letters and Philosophy File:UGent Campus Kortrijk.png|UGent Campus in Kortrijk File:Faculteit Psychologie UGent.JPG|Faculty of Psychology File:Resto Overpoort 2010PM 0098 21H7081.JPG File:Leeszaal 3.jpg|Library of the department of Architecture and Urbanism File:Boekentoren ugent0103.jpg|Boekentoren File:Boekentoren ugent0102.jpg|UGent Boekentoren File:Faculteitsbibliotheek Letteren en Wijsbegeerte UGent.jpg|Library of the Humanities Faculty File:Museum voor Dierkunde 2010PM 0413 21H7553.JPG|Museum of Zoology File:Anatomisch Instituut - Bijlokesite 2010PM 0778 21H8528.JPG|Institute for Anatomy == People == File:Johan Heinrich Neuman - Johan Rudolf Thorbecke.jpg|Johan Rudolf Thorbecke, statesman File:Henry.Pirenne.Portrait.gif|Henri Pirenne, historian File:George de Hevesy.jpg|George de Hevesy, Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry File:Maurice Maeterlinck 2.jpg|Maurice Maeterlinck, Nobel Prize winner in Literature File:Corneille Heymans nobel.jpg|Corneille Heymans, Nobel Prize winner in Medicine File:Belgisch-Nederlandse studieconferentie te Helvoirt (NB).
