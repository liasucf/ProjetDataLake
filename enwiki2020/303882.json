    "text": "The Welsh Football Association Cup () is a knock-out football competition contested annually by teams in the Welsh football league system. It is considered the most prestigious of the cup competitions in domestic Welsh association football. The Football Association of Wales is the organising body of this competition, which has been run (except during the two World Wars) every year since its inception in 1877\u201378. In the early years of organised football in Wales, football was very much the sport of north Wales rather than the rugby union playing south \u2013 the FAW was founded in Wrexham in 1876, and Wrexham remained the site of the FAW's head office until 1986; it was not until 1912 that a southern team, Cardiff City, won the Welsh Cup for the first time. The winning team qualifies to play in the following season's UEFA Europa League (previously teams qualified for the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, which was discontinued in 1999). Currently, the full sponsored name of the competition is the JD Welsh Cup. ==Participants== Until 1995, Welsh clubs playing in the Welsh or English leagues were invited to play in the Welsh Cup. On occasion some English clubs, mostly those from border areas such as Shrewsbury, Hereford and Chester, were also invited to participate. However, in the event of an English club winning the Welsh Cup, they were not allowed to progress to the European Cup Winners' Cup. Instead, the best placed Welsh club in the Welsh Cup competition would take the European place. From 1996 to 2011, only clubs playing in the Welsh football league system were allowed to enter the Welsh Cup. This rule excluded the six Welsh clubs who played in the English football league system: Cardiff City, Colwyn Bay, Merthyr Town, Newport County, Swansea City and Wrexham. On 20 April 2011, the Football Association of Wales invited these six clubs to rejoin the Welsh Cup for the 2011\u201312 season, but only Merthyr Town, Newport County and Wrexham accepted. In March 2012, UEFA stated that Welsh clubs playing in the English football league system could not qualify for European competitions via the Welsh Cup but they could qualify via the English league and cup competitions, hence they were subsequently again excluded from the Welsh Cup. ==History== Between the 1961\u201362 and 1984\u201385 seasons, the final was played as a two-leg match, originally on a points basis rather than aggregate score. In the 1985\u201386 season, it reverted to a single game, to be decided by extra time and penalties as necessary. Shrewsbury Town hold the record for the most times an English team has won the Cup, a record that will remain unbroken because English teams have not been allowed to compete in the cup since 1995. The last English winner of the Welsh Cup was Hereford United in 1990. ==Welsh Cup Final results== ==Performance== ===Performance by club=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" !Club !Winners !Runners-up !Final appearances !Last final |- |align=left|Wrexham |23 |22 |45 |1995 |- |align=left|Cardiff City |22 |10 |32 |1995 |- |align=left|Swansea CityHave played in the final as Swansea Town and Swansea City. |10 |8 |18 |1991 |- |align=left|Bangor City |8 |10 |18 |2013 |- |align=left|Cefn Druids |8 |6 |14 |2012 |- |align=left|The New SaintsHave played in the final as Llansantffraid and Total Network Solutions. |7 |4 |11 |2019 |- |align=left|Shrewsbury Town |6 |3 |9 |1985 |- |align=left|Barry Town |6 |1 |7 |2003 |- |align=left|Chirk A.A.A. |5 |1 |6 |1894 |- |align=left|Rhyl |4 |4 |8 |2006 |- |align=left|Chester City |3 |10 |13 |1970 |- |align=left|Merthyr Tydfil |3 |2 |5 |1987 |- |align=left|Wellington TownItalics indicates the club no longer exists. |3 |\u2013 |3 |1940 |- |align=left|Newtown |2 |4 |6 |2015 |- |align=left|Oswestry United |2 |\u2013 |2 |1901 |- |align=left|Crewe Alexandra |2 |\u2013 |2 |1937 |- |align=left|Hereford United |1 |3 |4 |1990 |- |align=left|Aberystwyth Town |1 |3 |4 |2018 |- |align=left|Connah's Quay & Shotton |1 |2 |3 |1929 |- |align=left|Newport County |1 |2 |3 |1987 |- |align=left|Carmarthen Town |1 |2 |3 |2007 |- |align=left|Llanelli |1 |2 |3 |2011 |- |align=left|Oswestry White Stars |1 |1 |2 |1885 |- |align=left|Tranmere Rovers |1 |1 |2 |1935 |- |align=left|Lovell's Athletic |1 |1 |2 |1959 |- |align=left|Connah's Quay Nomads |1 |2 |3 |2019 |- |align=left|Ebbw Vale |1 |\u2013 |1 |1926 |- |align=left|Bristol City |1 |\u2013 |1 |1934 |- |align=left|South Liverpool |1 |\u2013 |1 |1939 |- |align=left|Flint Town United |1 |\u2013 |1 |1954 |- |align=left|Borough United |1 |\u2013 |1 |1963 |- |align=left|Inter Cardiff |1 |\u2013 |1 |1999 |- |align=left|Prestatyn Town |1 |\u2013 |1 |2013 |- |align=left|Bala Town |1 |\u2013 |1 |2017 |- |align=left|Aberdare Athletic |\u2013 |4 |4 |1923 |- |align=left|Pontypridd |\u2013 |3 |3 |1921 |- |align=left|Cwmbran Town |\u2013 |3 |3 |2002 |- |align=left|Westminster Rovers |\u2013 |2 |2 |1892 |- |align=left|Whitchurch |\u2013 |2 |2 |1906 |- |align=left|Northwich Victoria |\u2013 |2 |2 |1910 |- |align=left|Kidderminster Harriers |\u2013 |2 |2 |1989 |- |align=left|Ruthin |\u2013 |1 |1 |1880 |- |align=left|Davenham |\u2013 |1 |1 |1887 |- |align=left|Aberaman |\u2013 |1 |1 |1903 |- |align=left|Ton Pentre |\u2013 |1 |1 |1922 |- |align=left|Merthyr Town |\u2013 |1 |1 |1924 |- |align=left|Flint Town |\u2013 |1 |1 |1925 |- |align=left|Stourbridge |\u2013 |1 |1 |1974 |- |align=left|Hednesford Town |\u2013 |1 |1 |1992 |- |align=left|Afan Lido |\u2013 |1 |1 |2007 |- |align=left|Port Talbot Town |\u2013 |1 |1 |2010 |} ===Notes=== ==See also== *FAW Premier Cup *Football in Wales *List of football clubs in Wales *List of stadiums in Wales by capacity *Welsh football league system *Welsh League Cup *FAW Trophy ==References== ==External links== * Welsh Football Data Archive Welsh Cup pages 1 Wales Category:1877 establishments in the United Kingdom Category:Recurring sporting events established in 1877 ",
