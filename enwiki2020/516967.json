    "text": "Three Man (also referred to as Mr. Three or Hat Man) is a drinking game played with two dice. It can be played with at least three people but some consider it better with around five.\"3-man / 3-bitch.\" 3-man Drinking Game. PinkyMcDrinky, n.d. Web. 15 Aug. 2013. . ==Rules== A random player is chosen to be the \"Three Man\", and may be given a hat to wear to signify this role. Players then take turns around the table to roll two six-sided dice, with the following effects: ;Threes :For a roll that totals 3, or shows 3 on one of its dice, The Three Man must take a drink. ;Sevens :For any roll that totals 7, the person to the left of roller drinks. (If a 3-4 is rolled, \"Three Man\" must also drink.) ;Nines :For any roll that totals 9, the person to the right of roller drinks. ;Elevens :If you roll 11 you drink. ;Doubles :Whenever a double is rolled, the roller may pass the dice to one or two other players, who roll the dice and apply the result. If this results in another double, the original roller must drink the sum of the dice. ==Variations== In the \"doubles\" variation, whoever rolls doubles (Player A) can \"give\" them to another player (Player B), who then rolls both the dice to see how many times they must drink. If B rolls doubles, the dice are returned to A, who must roll and drink twice as many times as the value that they roll (e.g., if A rolls 3 and 2, A must drink 10 times). In the \"Party Foul\" variant, if the dice fall off the table, the player drinks for each fallen die.\"Three Man.\" BeerTutor.com's Rules. 7 Seconds Resources, Inc., n.d. Web. 15 Aug. 2013. . When a \"Sloppy Jalopy\" rule is applied, the player with fallen dice is loudly admonished as a \"Sloppy Jalopy\" and immediately becomes the new Three Man.\"Dice Games.\" RP Repository. Repository and PIXELovely, n.d. Web. 15 Aug. 2013. . One version includes special effects for any roll of 1: * 1 and 1 follow the usual rules for passing off doubles. * 1 and 2 makes the roller Three Man. * 1 and 3 makes the Three Man drink (as with any roll of a 3). * 1 and 4 thumb to table or floor: last player to place his/her thumb must drink. * 1 and 5 turn ends. * When a 1 and 6 is rolled, the player to the left drinks. Another house rule is a \"bathroom penalty\": if a player is in the bathroom when it is their turn to roll, they must take a drink for every 5 seconds they are late in returning. In an Australian version of this game the rules are as follows: *1+1 : New Rule (You make a rule affecting the current game, Little Green Man[5], Nicknames etc) *1+2 : 3 man (You are the three man put on a hat, every time a three is on the dice drink, remains until someone else rolls this) *2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-6 (doubles) : Choose a person to fill their drink and finish their drink. *7 or 11 : Choose a person to fill their drink and finish their drink. If someone has a double, seven or Eleven they roll as soon as the person touches the cup and if they get a 7, 11, or double the person must repeat. If a player touches the dice before that, they must finish their drink. On the third time this is rolled, the roller must finish their drink. *9 : Busta Rhyme (Make up one line of a rhyme, go around table, loser drinks) *10 : Categories (Select a category go around the table until someone misses out they drink) ==Notes== Category:Dice games Category:Drinking games ",
