    "text": "Cursed, later renamed The Weber Show, is an American sitcom television series that ran on NBC from October 26, 2000 to August 28, 2001. It starred Steven Weber, Amy Pietz, Wendell Pierce, and Chris Elliott. ==Overview== The show is notable for having an abrupt title change in the middle of its first season. The initial premise was that its protagonist (Weber) had been cursed by an ex- girlfriend and thus constantly encountered bad luck. The show failed to find an audience, and so midway through the season the entire \"bad luck\" angle was abruptly dropped. The show was revamped as a more traditional sitcom and renamed The Weber Show. In spite of the change (or perhaps because of it), the show still struggled and was canceled at the end of the season, leaving a cliffhanger unresolved. The show's theme song was written and performed by Liz Phair. ==Cast== *Steven Weber as Jack Nagle *Amy Pietz as Melissa Taylor *Chris Elliott as Larry Heckman *Wendell Pierce as Wendell Simms *Paula Marshall as Katie ==Episodes== ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:2000 American television series debuts Category:2000s American sitcoms Category:2001 American television series endings Category:English- language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in Chicago ",
