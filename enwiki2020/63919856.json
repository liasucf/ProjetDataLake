    "text": "Alprazolam triazolobenzophenone is a chemical compound which can be both a synthetic precursor and a prodrug for the benzodiazepine derivative alprazolam. At neutral pH it readily cyclizes to alprazolam, while in acidic conditions alprazolam undergoes a ring-opening reaction back to the triazolobenzophenone. A series of related acyl derivatives was researched in the 1980s as injectable water-soluble prodrugs of alprazolam, but were never developed for medical use. Subsequently, this compound has been detected as a designer drug, first being identified from a seizure in Spain in March 2014. ==See also== * Avizafone * Rilmazafone == References == Category:Benzodiazepines Category:Chloroarenes ",
