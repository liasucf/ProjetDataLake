    "text": "Ralph Rexford Bellamy (June 17, 1904 \u2013 November 29, 1991) was an American actor whose career spanned 62 years on stage, film, and television. During his career, he played leading roles as well as supporting roles, garnering acclaim and awards, including an Tony Award for Best Dramatic Actor in Sunrise at Campobello and Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for The Awful Truth (1937). ==Early life== Bellamy was born in Chicago. He was the son of Lilla Louise (n\u00e9e Smith; January 23, 1875 \u2013 June 15, 1962), a native of Canada, and Charles Rexford Bellamy (January 12, 1876 \u2013 October 7, 1968). He ran away from home when he was 15 and managed to get into a road show. He toured with road shows before finally landing in New York City. He began acting on stage there and by 1927 owned his own theater company. In 1931, he made his film debut and worked constantly throughout the decade both as a lead and as a capable supporting actor. He co-starred in five films with Fay Wray. ==Film and television career== Cary Grant, Rosalind Russell and Bellamy in a publicity shot for His Girl Friday (1940) Gloria McGhee and Ralph Bellamy in Man Against Crime (1953) Guest stars for the 1961 premiere episode of The Dick Powell Show, \"Who Killed Julie Greer?\".

His film career began with The Secret Six (1931) starring Wallace Beery and featuring Jean Harlow and Clark Gable. By the end of 1933, he had already appeared in 22 movies, most notably Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm (1932) and the second lead in the action film Picture Snatcher with James Cagney (1933). He played in seven more films in 1934 alone, including Woman in the Dark, based on a Dashiell Hammett story, in which Bellamy played the lead, second-billed under Fay Wray. Bellamy kept up the pace through the decade, receiving a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in The Awful Truth (1937) with Irene Dunne and Cary Grant, and played a similar part, that of a naive boyfriend competing with the sophisticated Grant character, in His Girl Friday (1940). He portrayed detective Ellery Queen in a few films during the 1940s, but as his film career did not progress, he returned to the stage, where he continued to perform throughout the 1950s. Bellamy appeared in other movies during this time, including Dance, Girl, Dance (1940) with Maureen O'Hara and Lucille Ball, and the horror classic The Wolf Man (1941) with Lon Chaney, Jr. and Evelyn Ankers.Maltin 1994, p. 63. He also appeared in The Ghost of Frankenstein in 1942 with Chaney and Bela Lugosi. In 1949, Bellamy starred in the television noir private eye series Man Against Crime (also known as Follow That Man) on the DuMont Television Network; initially telecast live in its earliest seasons, the program lasted until 1956 and was simulcast for a season on Dumont and NBC, and ran on CBS during a different year. The lead role was taken by Frank Lovejoy in 1956, who subsequently starred in NBC's Meet McGraw detective series. Bellamy appeared on television in numerous roles over the following years.

In December 1961, he portrayed the part of Judge Quince in the episode \"Judgement at Hondo Seco\" on CBS's Rawhide. During the 1963\u20131964 television season, Bellamy co-starred with Jack Ging in the NBC medical drama The Eleventh Hour, in the role of a psychiatrist in private practice. Wendell Corey had appeared in the first season of the series. As Franklin D. Roosevelt (1960) Bellamy appeared on Broadway in one of his most famous roles, as Franklin Delano Roosevelt in Sunrise at Campobello, winning a Tony Award for the role in 1957. He reprised the role in the 1960 film version. In the summer of 1961, Bellamy hosted nine original episodes of a CBS Western anthology series called Frontier Justice, a Dick Powell Four Star Television production.

He was a member of the cast of the short-lived CBS espionage drama Hunter in 1977. An Emmy Award nomination for the mini-series The Winds of War (1983) \u2013 in which Bellamy reprised his Sunrise at Campobello role of Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2013 brought him back into the spotlight. This was quickly followed by his role as Randolph Duke, a conniving millionaire commodities trader in Trading Places (1983) alongside Don Ameche. The 1988 Eddie Murphy film, Coming to America, included a brief cameo by Bellamy and Don Ameche, reprising their roles as the Duke brothers. In 1988, he again portrayed Franklin Roosevelt in the sequel to The Winds of War, War and Remembrance. Among his later roles was a memorable appearance as a once- brilliant but increasingly senile lawyer sadly skewered by Jimmy Smits' character on an episode of L.A. Law. Bellamy continued working regularly and gave his final performance in Pretty Woman (1990). ==Personal life== Throughout the 1930s and '40s, Bellamy was regularly seen socially with a select circle of friends known affectionately as the \"Irish Mafia,\" although they preferred the less sensational \"Boy's Club.\" This group consisted of a group of Hollywood A-listers who were mainly of Irish descent (despite Bellamy having no Irish family connections himself).
