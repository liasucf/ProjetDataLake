    "text": "The Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball program is the intercollegiate men's basketball program of the University of Kansas. The program is classified in the NCAA's Division I and the team competes in the Big 12 Conference. Kansas is considered one of the most prestigious college basketball programs in the country with 5 overall National Championships (winning 3 NCAA Tournament championships and being retroactively named with 2 Helms National Championships), as well being a National Runner-Up six times and having the most conference titles in the nation. Kansas is the all-time consecutive conference titles record holder with 14 consecutive titles, a streak that ran from 2005 through 2018. The Jayhawks also own the NCAA record for most consecutive NCAA Tournament appearances with an active streak of 30 consecutive appearances. The Jayhawks have been ranked in the AP poll for 220 consecutive polls, a streak that has stretched from the poll released on February 2, 2009 poll through the poll released on March 18, 2020, which is the longest active streak in the nation. That streak is 1 behind UCLA's record run of 221 straight from 1966 to 1980. Of the 24 seasons the Big 12 conference has been in existence, Kansas has won at least a share of 19 Regular Season Conference titles. The Jayhawks' first coach was the inventor of the game of basketball, James Naismith. Naismith, ironically, is the only coach in Kansas basketball history with a losing record. The Kansas basketball program has produced many notable professional players, including Clyde Lovellette, Wilt Chamberlain, Jo Jo White, Danny Manning, Raef LaFrentz, Paul Pierce, Nick Collison, Kirk Hinrich, Mario Chalmers, Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid. Politician Bob Dole also played basketball at Kansas. Former players that have gone on to be coaches include Phog Allen, Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg, and former assistants to go on to be notable coaches include John Calipari, Gregg Popovich, and Bill Self. Mark Turgeon, Jerod Haase, Danny Manning, and Tad Boyle are all former players and assistant coaches that became head coaches. Allen founded the National Association of Basketball Coaches and, with Lonborg, was an early proponent of the NCAA tournament. Four different Jayhawk head coaches are in the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as coaches, Phog Allen, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and current head coach Bill Self. Three different Division I basketball arenas have been named after former Kansas players, the Dean Smith Center named after Dean Smith at North Carolina, Rupp Arena named after Adolph Rupp at Kentucky, and the Jayhawks own arena Allen Fieldhouse named after Phog Allen. In 2008, ESPN ranked Kansas second on a list of the most prestigious programs of the modern college basketball era. Kansas currently has the longest streak of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances of all-time (30), the longest current streak of consecutive NCAA winning seasons (35), the most winning seasons in Division I history (97), the most non-losing seasons (.500 or better) in NCAA history (100), the most conference championships in Division I history (61), the most consecutive regular season conference titles in Division I (14), the most First Team All Americans in Division I history (22), and the most First Team All American Selections in Division I history (29). As of the last complete season, the program ranks third in Division I all-time winning percentage (.725) and second in Division I all-time wins (2,274). Since the opening of Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks home arena, in 1955, the Jayhawks have earned a well established home court advantage. Allen Fieldhouse is often considered one of the best home court advantages in college basketball. The Jayhawks have won over 70 percent of their games in Allen Fieldhouse, losing only a little over 100 games in its over 60-year history. Under current head coach Bill Self, the Jayhawks have had three home court winning streaks over 30 games and two streaks that have reached over 50 games. In addition to Allen Fieldhouse, the Jayhawks will frequently play games at the nearby T-Mobile Center (formally Sprint Center) in Kansas City, Missouri. These games, while technically a neutral site, are officially considered home games when they are not a part of a tournament, the only exception being their games at the arena during their six-game series with rival Missouri. ==History== Kansas ranks second all-time in NCAA Division I wins with 2,302 wins (as of the last complete season), against 862 losses (.728 all time winning %, 3rd all-time). This record includes a 765\u2013110 (.874) mark at historic Allen Fieldhouse. The Jayhawks are first in NCAA history with 98 winning seasons, and tied for first in NCAA history with 101 non-losing (.500 or better) seasons with Kentucky. Kansas has the fewest head coaches (8) of any program that has been around 100 years, yet has reached the Final Four under more head coaches (6) than any other program in the nation. Every head coach at Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament has led the program to the Final Four. Kansas has had four head coaches inducted into the Naismith Hall of Fame, more than any other program in the nation. A perennial conference powerhouse, Kansas leads Division I all-time in regular season conference titles with 62 in 113 years of conference play (the MVIAA Conference was created in 1907) through the 2019\u201320 regular season. The Jayhawks have won a record 20 conference titles and a record 11 conference tournament titles in the 24 years of the Big 12's existence. The program also owns the best Big 12 records in both those areas with a 412\u2013102 record in conference play and a 46\u201312 record in tournament play. The Jayhawks won their 2,000th game in school history when they defeated Texas Tech in the 2009\u20132010 season, joining the University of Kentucky and the University of North Carolina as the only schools to boast such an achievement at that time. ===James Naismith era (1898\u20131907)=== The 1899 University of Kansas basketball team, with Dr. James Naismith at the back, right. The men's basketball program officially began in 1898, following the arrival of Dr. James Naismith to the school, just six years after Naismith had written the sport's first official rules. Naismith was initially hired to be a chapel director and physical education instructor, but became the head basketball coach. During those early years, the majority of the university's basketball games were played against nearby YMCA teams, with YMCAs across the nation having played an integral part in the birth of basketball. Other common opponents were Haskell Institute and William Jewell College. Under Naismith, the team played just one game against a current Big 12 school, a matchup with rival Kansas State University.Naismith's Record Naismith was, ironically, the only coach in the program's history to have a losing record (55\u201360). Including his years as coach, Naismith served as the Athletic Director and a faculty member at Kansas for a total of almost 40 years before retiring in 1937. Naismith died in 1939, and his remains are buried in Lawrence, Kansas. The basketball court in Allen Fieldhouse is named James Naismith Court. Beyond inventing the game, his next greatest basketball legacy may be his coaching tree, whose two trunks are the well-known Phog Allen and Kansas native John McLendon. (McLendon attended KU in the 1930s when Allen was head coach. Although McLendon tried out for the team, he never played for Allen. Naismith mentored McLendon from his arrival at Kansas through degree completion and beyond.) On December 10, 2010, the David Booth family purchased Dr. James Naismith's 13 Original Rules of the game at a Sotheby's auction in New York City for the sum of $4.3 million. They brought the founding document of basketball back to KU's Lawrence campus, where it is currently housed at the DeBruce Center. ===Phog Allen/William O. Hamilton era (1907\u20131956)=== In 1907, Kansas hired one of Naismith's players, Dr. Forrest C. \"Phog\" Allen as head coach. Naismith provided Allen with a now infamous piece of wisdom: \"You can't coach basketball; you just play it.\" Allen would set out to prove the adage wrong and through success and an unrivaled coaching tree has become known as the \"Father of Basketball Coaching\", having passed on his knowledge of the game to some of the most well-respected names in the history of college basketball, including National Basketball Hall of Fame coaches Adolph Rupp, Dean Smith, Dutch Lonborg and Ralph Miller (all except Lonborg were born and raised in Kansas). Allen coached the team from 1907 to 1909, but William O. Hamilton coached from 1909 to 1919, with Allen taking over again in 1919. The team went 125\u201359 and won five conference championships under Hamilton's direction. Allen coached KU for 39 seasons and amassed a record of 590\u2013219, with two retroactively-awarded Helms Foundation national titles and one NCAA Tournament championship in 1952. Numerous basketball greats would play at Kansas during Allen's era, including Dean Smith, Adolph Rupp, Dutch Lonborg, and Ralph Miller (all future Hall of Fame coaches), Paul Endacott, Bill Johnson, and Clyde Lovellette (Hall of Fame players), two-time Olympic Gold Medalist Bill Hougland, and even former United States Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. In 1952, the Jayhawks won the national title with an 80\u201363 victory in the final game over St. John's, coached by Frank McGuire. Clyde Lovellette of Kansas was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player, and is still the only player to lead the nation in scoring and lead his team to a national title in the same year. This tournament was the first to have a true \"Final Four\" format. Seven members of the championship team represented the United States in the 1952 Summer Olympics and brought home a gold medal for the national basketball team. This was especially poignant for Allen, as he had been the driving force for having basketball added to the Olympics in 1936. Allen was forced to retire when he turned 70 in 1956, because he was getting too \"old\". Allen had recruited legendary Wilt Chamberlain to Kansas, but would not get to coach him because freshmen were not eligible to play varsity basketball in 1956. ===Dick Harp era (1956\u20131964)=== Wilt Chamberlain was one of the top centers to ever play for the Jayhawks. Following Allen's retirement, the Jayhawks hired former KU player and assistant, Dick Harp. Under Harp the Jayhawks went 121\u201382 with two conference titles and two NCAA tournament berths. Wilt Chamberlain played his varsity years under Harp, making his job a rather easy one for the first two seasons. In his first varsity game, Chamberlain scored 52 points and grabbed 31 rebounds, breaking both all-time college records in an 87\u201369 win against Northwestern. In 1957, he led the Jayhawks to the championship game against North Carolina, coached by Frank McGuire, whom they had defeated in the 1952 title game when McGuire was at St. John's. McGuire triple-teamed Chamberlain and, as a result, KU was defeated 54\u201353 in triple overtime. The game is considered one of the greatest in NCAA history. Chamberlain continued to average 30+ points per game until leaving KU early to play professionally with the Harlem Globetrotters. ===Ted Owens era (1964\u20131983)=== Ted Owens took over for Harp in 1964, and would go 348\u2013128 during his tenure, eventually winning six Big Eight Conference titles. The team advanced to NCAA postseason play seven times under Owens. The 1971 team went 27\u20133 and advanced to the Final Four before losing to UCLA. In 1974 the team went 23\u20137 and again advanced to the Final Four before losing to Marquette. During this era the program produced All-Americans such as Jo Jo White, Walt Wesley, Bud Stallworth, Darnell Valentine, and Dave Robisch. After 19 years of coaching at University of Kansas, Owens was fired following the 1982\u201383 season after the Jayhawks posted back-to-back losing seasons. ===Larry Brown era (1983\u20131988)=== Brown helped lead Kansas to the school's second-ever NCAA Tournament championship in 1988. In 1983, Larry Brown headed to the University of Kansas, after coaching in the NBA. Under Brown, Kansas finished first in the Big Eight in 1986, and second in 1984, 1985, and 1987. In 1988, Kansas got off to a mediocre 12\u20138 start, including 1\u20134 in the Big 8. The Jayhawks' 55-game homecourt winning streak in Allen Fieldhouse was snapped with a loss to rival Kansas State, and they would also lose 2 more home games to Duke and Oklahoma. Behind the high-scoring of Danny Manning, KU finished 21\u201311 at the end of the season and entered the NCAA tournament as a #6 seed. Two early upsets allowed them to face lower seeds, gain momentum, and advance. The Jayhawks would ultimately go on to face the three teams who had given them their three home losses that season. They defeated rival Kansas State in the Elite 8, then defeated Duke in the Final 4, and won the national championship, defeating favored conference rival Oklahoma 83\u201379 in the final. The 11 losses Kansas accrued in 1988 are more than any other national champion have before or since. The win garnered the team the nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Earlier, near the start of the tournament, Dick Vitale had been asked about Kansas' chances and commented \"If Kansas wins, I'll kiss the Jayhawk on the floor of Allen Fieldhouse.\" Eventually, he did make good on his promise. During Brown's tenure, Kansas had five NCAA Tournament appearances, which included two second round appearances, one Sweet 16 appearance, two trips to the Final Four and the national championship. He also compiled a 135\u201344 (.754) overall record. Brown left under a cloud, as NCAA sanctions and a postseason probation were levied against Kansas following Brown's departure in the 1988\u20131989 season as a result of recruiting violations that took place during Brown's tenure. The major violation was a plane ticket home for potential transfer Vincent Askew to see his sick grandmother. Prior to the investigation, Askew had already decided not to transfer to Kansas. ===Roy Williams era (1988\u20132003)=== Shortly following Brown's departure, Kansas hired then North Carolina assistant Roy Williams as head coach. From 1988 to 2003, under the direction of Williams, the Jayhawks had a record of 418\u2013101, a .805 winning percentage. Williams' Kansas teams averaged 27.8 wins per season. Except for his first season at Kansas (when the team was on probation), all of Williams' teams made the NCAA tournament. From 1990 to 1999 Kansas compiled a 286\u201360 record, giving them both the most wins and best winning percentage of any team in that decade. From 1994 to 1998, the Jayhawks won 62 consecutive home games at Allen Fieldhouse, which was the longest such streak in the NCAA at the time. The seniors of 1998 (Raef LaFrentz, Billy Thomas, and C.B. McGrath) went 58\u20130 at home during their KU careers. Kansas won nine regular- season conference championships over Williams' last 13 years. In seven years of Big 12 Conference play, his teams went 94\u201318, capturing the regular-season title in 1997, 1998, 2002 and 2003 and the postseason tournament crown in 1997, 1998 and 1999. In 2001\u201302, KU became the first, and so far only, team to go undefeated (16\u20130) in Big 12 play. From 1995 to 1998, Kansas was a combined 123\u201317 \u2013 an average of 30.8 wins per season. Williams' teams went 201\u201317 (.922) in Allen Fieldhouse, and won 62 consecutive games in Allen from February 1994 to December 1998. Kansas was a regular in the Associated Press Top 25 from 1991 to 1999, placing in the poll for 145 consecutive weeks. Williams' teams were ranked in the Top 10 in 194 AP polls from 1990.Official Bio Kansas led the nation in field goal percentage and scoring in 2002 and in scoring margin in 2003, held opponents to the lowest field goal percentage in the country in 2001 (37.8 percent), and led the nation in winning percentage in 1997 and 2002. The team shot better than 50 percent from the floor for seven different seasons under Williams, and led the country in field goal percentage in 1990 (53.3) and 2002 (50.6). Williams' teams shot a combined 49.4 percent from the floor during his tenure. Williams-coached teams led the nation in assists in 2001 and 2002 and were seventh in the nation in 2003; scored 100 or more points 71 times (once every 13 games); averaged 82.7 points per game over his 15 seasons as coach; and averaged 90 or more points per game in two seasons (92.1 in 1990 and 90.9 in 2002). The Jayhawks were in the AP Top 25 in 242 of 268 weekly polls, reached the No. 1 ranking in the country in six different seasons, and reached at least No. 2 in the nation in 11 of William's 15 seasons as head coach at Kansas. Under Williams, the team had several deep runs in the NCAA Tournament, making it to four Final Fours and appearing in the national championship game in both 1991 and 2003, losing both, to Duke and Syracuse respectively. Amidst the tournament successes, there were plenty of woes. The 1996\u201397 team was said by many to be one of the greatest teams in history, featuring future NBA players such as Paul Pierce, Jacque Vaughn, Raef LaFrentz, and Scot Pollard. The team was upset in the Sweet Sixteen by the eventual champion, Arizona Wildcats. The Jayhawks advanced to the Final Four in 2002 & 2003\\. Following the national championship loss in 2003, Williams left Kansas and returned to coach at his alma mater, North Carolina. ===Bill Self era (2003\u2013present)=== Bill Self was introduced as the new head coach for the 2003\u201304 season and in his first season at Kansas, Self inherited Williams' players and recruits, which often caused turmoil as the style of play differed between the two coaches. Nevertheless, Self led his new Kansas team to the Elite Eight at the NCAA tournament his first year. The next two seasons did not end on such a high note. Big things were expected of an experienced KU in 2004\u201305, led by seniors Wayne Simien, Keith Langford, Michael Lee, and Aaron Miles. They began the season ranked #1 and started off 20\u20131, but then they slumped and lost six of their final nine games, including a loss to Bucknell in the first round of the NCAA Tournament. The team finished 23\u20137 and settled for a Big 12 co- championship with Oklahoma. Coach Bill Self (third from left) with his national champion 2007\u201308 squad In 2005\u201306, little was expected of the freshman/sophomore-dominated Jayhawks, and they began the season 10\u20136, including 1\u20132 in the Big 12. Although they did post a 73\u201346 win over Kentucky, they also saw the end of their 31-game winning streak over rival Kansas State with a 59\u201355 loss at Allen Fieldhouse, and two nights later blew a seven-point lead in the final 45 seconds of regulation en route to an 89\u201386 overtime loss at Missouri. But afterward, the Jayhawks matured rapidly, winning 15 of their final 17 games and avenging the losses to both Kansas State and Missouri. KU played as the #2 seed in the Big 12 Tournament in Dallas, and avenged an earlier loss to Texas with an 80\u201368 victory over the Longhorns in the final to clinch the tournament championship and the highlight win of the season. KU was handed a #4 seed for the NCAA Tournament but stumbled again in the first round with a loss to the Bradley Braves. In the 2006\u201307 season, Self led Kansas to the 2007 Big 12 regular-season championship with a 14\u20132 record, highlighted by beating the Kevin Durant-led Texas Longhorns in come-from-behind victories in the last game of the regular season and in the Big 12 Championship game. At the end of the regular season, Kansas stood at 27\u20134 and ranked #2 in the nation in both the AP and coaches' polls. Kansas received a number 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, but their tournament run ended in the Elite Eight with a loss to 2-seed UCLA. In the 2007\u201308 season, Self's Kansas team began the season 20\u20130 until they suffered their first loss at rival Kansas State, their first loss at Kansas State since 1983. The 2008 Jayhawks won the Big 12 regular-season title and the Big 12 conference tourney. They received a number-one seeding in the NCAA Tournament in the Midwest region. On March 30, 2008, Self led Kansas to a win in an Elite Eight game over upstart Davidson College. KU won by two, 59\u201357. The Jayhawks played overall number 1 tournament seed North Carolina in the semifinals, a team coached by former KU head man Roy Williams. The Jayhawks opened the game with a 40\u201312 run over the first 12\u00bd minutes before finally defeating them 84\u201366. On April 7, 2008, the Jayhawks triumphed over a one-loss Memphis team to claim the national title. With only seconds on the clock, Sherron Collins drove the ball the length of the court and threaded a pass to Mario Chalmers, who connected on a deep three-pointer to force overtime. This shot would later come to be known as \"Mario's Miracle\" in a nod to 1988 championship nickname \"Danny and the Miracles\". Kansas then outplayed Memphis in the overtime to win the NCAA Championship game, 75\u201368. The Jayhawks finished the season with a 37\u20133 record, the winningest season in Kansas history. Kansas fans celebrate in Downtown Lawrence, Kansas after the Jayhawks win the 2008 National Championship In the 2008\u201309 season, despite losing 7 of their top 9 scorers and the entire starting line-up, the Jayhawks earned their 20th consecutive NCAA Tournament bid after going 25\u20137 (14\u20132), winning the conference regular season title and extending their home winning streak to 41 straight at Allen Fieldhouse. On March 22, 2009, Kansas defeated Dayton, advancing to their 3rd consecutive Sweet 16 appearance. But the Jayhawks' season ended on March 27 when Michigan State came from behind in the final minute to defeat Kansas 67\u201362, ending their year at 27\u20138. Coach Self's record, after 6 seasons with the Jayhawks, was 169\u201340, an .809 percentage. After the season, Self was named National Coach of the Year by the Associated Press, CBS Sports' Chevrolet Award, USBWA (Henry Iba Award), and Sporting News. On April 13, Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich announced their intent to return for the 2009\u201310 season. On April 23, top high school recruit Xavier Henry made his commitment to play at Kansas in the fall, prompting ESPN to name the Jayhawks as \"the team to beat in 2009\u201310.\" By the time the fall of 2009 arrived, Kansas was the unanimous preseason #1 team in all major publications. The Jayhawks finished the regular season with a 29\u20132 record and continue to hold the Division I record for the current consecutive home winning streak at 59 straight games in Allen Fieldhouse. Kansas passed 2,000 all-time wins in the 2009\u201310 season, only the third school to do so (finishing the season with a total of 2,003 all-time victories). They won the Big 12 tournament on March 13, clinching their 21st consecutive NCAA Tournament appearance, an active NCAA record. However, despite being named the overall #1 seed in the tournament, the Jayhawks fell in the second round to #9-seeded Northern Iowa, finishing the season at 33\u20133. Recruiting began immediately for the 2010\u201311 season, as Kansas landed the nation's top recruit Josh Selby in April. By September 2010, both The Sporting News and Athlon Sports had ranked Kansas in their pre-season outlook as #4 overall and, along with ESPN's Joe Lunardi, were projected to become a #1 seed again in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, which they would again do. Blue Ribbon and the USA Today/ESPN coaches polls both placed Kansas at #7 in the pre-season poll. Josh Selby, became eligible and joined the Jayhawk line-up on December 18. On March 5, the Jayhawks beat Missouri 70\u201366 to clinch the Big 12 regular-season title for the 7th consecutive time and later went on to finish 29\u20132 during the regular season, ranked #2 in both the AP Poll and the USA Today/ESPN Coaches Poll. Bill Self was named Big 12 Coach of the Year and Marcus Morris was named Big 12 Player of the Year. The Jayhawks defeated 16 seed Boston University, 9 seed Illinois and 12 seed Richmond to reach their 3rd Elite Eight in the past 5 seasons before falling to 11 seed Virginia Commonwealth University in the quarterfinal game. During the season, Kansas moved past North Carolina as the 2nd winningest basketball program in history. After being considered the top team but falling short in both of the previous two seasons, Kansas lost six of their top 8 scorers for the 2011\u201312 season. The Jayhawks had to rebuild after winning seven straight Big 12 titles. Prior to the season, the NCAA declared that three of the Jayhawks top recruits were ineligible for the season, which included games against perennial powerhouse programs such as Kentucky, Duke, Ohio State, and Georgetown. Despite 7 games against top 10 ranked opponents, Kansas finished the regular season 26\u20135, earned their 8th consecutive Big 12 title, and advanced to their 14th Final Four in school history. The Jayhawks would face another 2 seed, the Ohio State Buckeyes, in the National Semifinals. Kansas would come back from a 13-point first half deficit to win the game, 64\u201362. They then would face the Kentucky Wildcats, who had beaten the Louisville Cardinals on the other side of the bracket, in the championship game. Kansas would fall to the Wildcats, 67\u201359. Kansas entered the 2012\u201313 season with eight straight Big 12 titles in tow. They continued to have the greatest home court advantage in all of sports, ending the season having won 107 of their last 109 games at home. After scoring their ninth consecutive title and winning the Big 12 tournament championship by defeating rival Kansas State for the third time that season, KU set its sights on a sixth national title. They were seeded #1 in the South bracket, defeating Western Kentucky and North Carolina before losing in overtime to Michigan 87\u201385 in the Sweet 16. With star freshmen Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid on the roster, Kansas entered the 2013\u201314 season as the #5 team in the country. They started off well with five straight wins, including a victory over Duke in the Champions' Classic. However, the team went 4\u20134 over its next eight games, including back- to-back losses to Colorado and Florida and an ugly home loss to San Diego State. The team recovered from this rough stretch and began Big 12 play with seven straight wins, ultimately finishing 14\u20134 to win its 10th consecutive Big 12 title. A back injury to Joel Embiid, however, left the Jayhawks vulnerable on their interior defense, and they fizzled out at season's end with four losses in their final seven games, including a loss to Iowa State in the Big 12 Tournament quarterfinals in Kansas City and an NCAA Tournament Round of 32 loss to Stanford to end the year. Kansas concluded the year 25\u201310, the first ten-loss season for Kansas since Roy Williams' 1999\u20132000 Jayhawks went 24\u201310. After the exodus of Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid to the NBA draft, the Jayhawks reloaded with freshmen Kelly Oubre Jr. and Cliff Alexander, the Jayhawks looked poised for another Big 12 season title, which would be their 11th straight. After a disappointing loss in the Champions Classic to Kentucky, the Jayhawks finished 11\u20132 in the non-conference. In what many regarded as the toughest conference in the nation (Big 12) the Jayhawks won their 11th straight title outright with a record of 13\u20135, having lost their arguably strongest post presence in Cliff Alexander due to an investigation by the NCAA of improper benefits being given to Alexander. Evidence never clearly materialized, but Alexander was held out and played his last game as a Jayhawk at Kansas State, where they lost by 7. They then lost in the Big 12 Championship game to Iowa State 70\u201366, and had a final record going into the tournament of 26\u20138. The Jayhawks were given a two seed in the NCAA Tournament, where they ousted 15 seed New Mexico State by 19 points, but exited the tournament early at the hands of Wichita State by 13 points. Both Oubre Jr. and Alexander declared for the draft shortly after the conclusion of the NCAA tournament. The 2015-16 Jayhawks, led by Perry Ellis and Frank Mason, won a 12th consecutive Big 12 title and won the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA South Region, the Jayhawks reached the Elite Eight, where they stumbled against #2 seed Villanova, the eventual national champions. In 2016\u201317, behind the leadership of national player of the year Frank Mason, the Jayhawks won a 13th consecutive Big 12 title, tying UCLA's record for most consecutive conference titles. Although the team made an early exit from the Big 12 Tournament with a quarterfinal loss to TCU, the Jayhawks got the #1 seed in the NCAA Midwest Region. They dominated UC-Davis, Michigan State, and Purdue in their first three games, but ran into a buzzsaw against Oregon in the Elite Eight. The 2017-18 Jayhawks lost a number of players to graduation, the NBA Draft, and transfer; but appeared to be poised for another spectacular season. Star freshman Billy Preston was sidelined by an NCAA inquiry into the financial picture surrounding his car, and ultimately left the team to play professional basketball in Europe. Kansas won its first seven games before losing in Kansas City to Washington and at home to Arizona State. Kansas would lose a total of three home games during the season, the most for any Bill Self-coached Kansas team, and the most since losing three home games in the 1998\u201399 season. The season bottomed out in early February with an ugly home loss to Oklahoma State and a 16-point loss at Baylor. But Kansas rallied to win a 14th straight Big 12 title, breaking UCLA's record. Then they defeated West Virginia to win the Big 12 Tournament. Seeded #1 in the NCAA Midwest Region, the Jayhawks defeated Penn, Seton Hall, Clemson, and Duke to reach Bill Self's third Final Four appearance and the program's 15th overall. Kansas played in the 2015 World University Games in South Korea as the United States representatives in July 2015. The Jayhawks went undefeated in the World University Games, winning the championship to give the United States its first gold medal in World University Games men's basketball since 2005. In August 2017, Self and the Jayhawks traveled to Italy to play four exhibition matches against local professional Italian teams. Shortly before the 2019-20 season began the NCAA announced they had major NCAA violations stemming from their involvement in the 2017\u201318 NCAA Division I men's basketball corruption scandal putting their NCAA record consecutive tournament appearance streak in jeopardy. The Jayhawks finished the 2019\u201320 regular season 28\u20133 and were unanimously ranked number one in the final regular season AP poll. The Jayhawks went undefeated against unranked teams and their 3 losses came to ranked teams. The Jayhawks were a favorite to win the NCAA Tournament, however, the NCAA Tournament was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, without a national champion being named. ==Rank in notable areas== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Chamberlain was later named the NCAA Final Four Most Outstanding Player, the second to win the award and be a part of the losing team (Kansas\u2019 B.H. Born won the award in 1953). * In the 1966 Midwest Regional Finals, Kansas, the favored team to face Kentucky, played Texas Western. Texas Western got a controversial double overtime victory, 81\u201380. The would-be winning shot, a 35-footer, at the buzzer was made by All-American Jo Jo White at the end of the first overtime, but White was called for stepping on the sideline, ironically being penalized for being too far away from the basket and the shot was negated. This has always been highly contested and a photograph of the play shows his heel over the line but not on the floor. Being the only piece of impartial evidence, it is impossible to tell whether his heel came up from the line prior to the photo, or whether his heel dropped to the line following the photo. Also noted in the photograph is the fact that the referee is not looking at his foot. This supports Ted Owens' objection that the call was made late, if the ref did not see his foot until after the shot. The Kansas players were celebrating when they were told the game was going to a 2nd overtime. Regardless of what actually happened, Texas Western was given the victory and advanced to the Final Four. The game is immortalized in the 2006 film Glory Road which is based on that season's Texas Western team. * On February 26, 1972, near the end of a disappointing 11\u201315 season for the Jayhawks, senior forward Bud Stallworth scored 50 points against archrival Missouri, who were in the running for the Big 8 Conference championship. Behind Stallworth's mammoth effort, the second-highest number of points in a game in KU history (Wilt Chamberlain scored 52 in his first game as a Jayhawk), KU defeated Missouri 93\u201380 on Senior Day at Allen Fieldhouse. Stallworth averaged 25.3 points per game for the 1971\u201372 season. * On April 4, 1988, in the 50th NCAA Tournament National Championship game, Kansas defeated the heavily favored Oklahoma Sooners 83\u201379 to win its second NCAA Men's Basketball championship. Led by senior forward and Player of the Year Danny Manning, Kevin Pritchard, Milt Newton, Chris Piper and a roster of players who came to be known as \"The Miracles\" raced the Sooners to a 50\u201350 halftime tie that had the referees shaking their heads and smiling as they left the court. Upon their return for the second half, Larry Brown convinced his Jayhawks that now that they proved they could run with the Sooners, they needed to slow the game down and take the Sooners out of their fast break offense. The Sooners built a 5-point second half lead until the Kansas defense finally clamped down. The Jayhawks, led by Manning (31 points, 18 rebounds, 5 steals, 2 blocked shots), caught up with them around the 11 minute mark. The rest of the game was neck and neck, until Manning finally sealed the victory from the free throw line.Woodling, Chuck (1988). Against All Odds \u2013 How Kansas Won the 1988 NCAA Championship. Lawrence Journal-World and the University Press of Kansas. * On December 9, 1989, AP #2 Kansas beat Kentucky 150\u201395 in Allen Fieldhouse. The 150 points scored by the Jayhawks set the school record for most points scored in a game, and the team's 80 first-half points set the record for most points scored in a half. * On January 27, 2003, Kansas defeated Big XII Conference Texas 90\u201387 at Allen Fieldhouse behind a 24-point, 23-rebound performance by Nick Collison. Upon Collison fouling out of the game, his effort moved longtime ESPN college basketball analyst Dick Vitale to give him a standing ovation, only the second time Vitale had ever done so. (the first being for David Robinson)\" Both Kansas and Texas would make the Final Four that year. * On March 3, 2007, Kansas recorded its 1,900th all-time program victory and won its 50th conference title against the Kevin Durant-led Texas Longhorns, 90\u201386. Texas led 54\u201342 at the half and led by as many as 16 early in the game. * On April 5, 2008, in their Final Four game leading up to their 2008 NCAA tournament victory over Memphis, the Jayhawks defeated North Carolina 84\u201366. Kansas started the game with a 40\u201312 lead. The Jayhawks held the Tar Heels without a basket for over nine minutes of the first half. After Brandon Rush buried a triple in transition to give Kansas a startling 38\u201312 lead, moving UNC coach Roy Williams to uncharacteristically call a timeout so early in a game, CBS announcer Billy Packer exclaimed, \"This game is over!\" even though there was 7:32 left in the first half. KU eventually won by 18-points. The Jayhawks shot 53 percent from the floor, while holding the Tar Heels to 35 percent. Kansas had 10 steals, 9 more rebounds and assists, six more blocks, and held North Carolina to 23 points below its average. * On April 7, 2008, in one of the most memorable NCAA National Championship games ever, the Kansas Jayhawks defeated the Memphis Tigers 75\u201368 in a come from behind overtime victory to become the 2008 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament Champions. Mario Chalmers made a three-point shot with 2.1 seconds remaining, bringing the Jayhawks all the way back from a 60\u201351 deficit with two minutes remaining. The Jayhawks went 4\u20134 from the field, including 2\u20132 from 3-point range, and also went 2\u20132 from the line in the final 2 minutes. The Jayhawks then continued their hot flurry by going 4\u20136 from the field in OT and 4\u20134 from the line, outscoring the Tigers 12\u20135 in overtime to capture their third NCAA title, and fifth overall, including the retroactively awarded Helms Foundation Championships for the 1922 and 1923 seasons. Chalmers finished with 18 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, and 4 steals, and was chosen the Most Outstanding Player at the Final Four, the fifth Jayhawk all-time to be selected Final Four MOP. * On March 11, 2010, the Jayhawks claimed their 2,000th victory with an 80\u201368 win over Texas Tech.\"Top-ranked Jayhawks pull away in Big 12 tourney opener.\" Associated Press. March 11, 2010. With this win, Kansas became the third program to achieve 2000 victories, and moved into a tie for #2 in all-time victories.

(The streak ended on January 22, 2011 with a loss at home to the Texas Longhorns.) * On September 24, 2011, Bill Self and the University of Kansas made use of the NBA lockout by inviting former players and coaches to the first-ever \"Legends Of The Phog\" exhibition game. The money raised went to Lawrence's Boys & Girls Club and the family of the late Neil Dougherty. Former coaches Larry Brown and Ted Owens led the teams, featuring Paul Pierce and a slew of Jayhawk legends. * On February 25, 2012, in possibly the most epic finish in Allen Fieldhouse to date, the Jayhawks played their final Border War with longtime rival, the Missouri Tigers. The Kansas Jayhawks came back from a 19-point deficit in the second half to take the team to an 87\u201386 overtime win against the Tigers. The volume level inside the arena was a sustained 120 dB, with a high point of 127 dB when Thomas Robinson blocked Phil Pressey's shot at the end of regulation to preserve the tie. * On February 25, 2013, at Iowa State, Bill Self got his 500th victory as a head coach with a 108\u201396 overtime win. * On February 24, 2014, the Jayhawks won their 10th consecutive Big 12 regular season championship with an 83\u201375 win at home against Oklahoma.

The game was back and forth the last few minutes of regulation. The game eventually went to 3 overtimes and KU won 109\u2013106. Kansas forward Perry Ellis scored 27 points and got 13 rebounds while Oklahoma guard Buddy Hield scored 46 points. The game was the first time in Big 12 history that a conference game featured the number 1 ranked team and the number 2 ranked team. * On February 27, 2016, the Jayhawks won their 12th consecutive Big 12 regular season championship with a 67\u201358 win at home against Texas Tech.

With this win, Kansas broke the NCAA record for most consecutive league championships (previously held by UCLA with 13). *On March 25, 2018, the Jayhawks played Duke in the 2018 NCAA Tournament in the Elite Eight. The game featured two of the top college basketball programs in the nation with a Hall of Fame coach on both sidelines with Bill Self and Mike Krzyzewski. The game was a back and forth game that had 18 lead changes and 11 ties. Senior guard Sviatoslav Mykhailiuk made a 3 pointer with 25.7 seconds left to tie the game at 72. Duke guard Grayson Allen missed the potential game winning shot as time expired and the game went into overtime. Kansas guard Malik Newman scored all 13 of the Jayhawks points in overtime to help them win with a score of 85\u201381 earning KU their first Final Four trip since 2012. ==Coaches== Despite having a program for almost 120 years, the Jayhawks have only had 8 head coaches. The longest tenured coach was Phog Allen at 39 seasons, while the shortest tenured coach was Larry Brown, who coached for 5 seasons. Allen also has the most wins in Kansas basketball history with 590. The next closest coach is current head coach Bill Self, who has won 500 games in his 17 seasons with the Jayhawks. Ted Owens is the only coach in program history to have been fired. Of programs who have been around for at least 100 years, Kansas has had the fewest coaches, yet they have been led to the Final Four by more coaches than any other program. Every coach that has coached Kansas since the inception of the NCAA Tournament in 1939 has led the team to a Final Four. Phog Allen, Dick Harp, Ted Owens, Larry Brown, Roy Williams, and Bill Self have all led Kansas to NCAA Final Four appearances. Of those coaches, Allen, Brown, and Bill Self have led the Jayhawks to NCAA Championships (in 1952, 1988, and 2008, respectively). In addition to an NCAA Tournament National Championship, Allen won two Helms Athletic Foundation National Championships, in 1922 and 1923. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background-color:#; color: #\"|Years | Duration of head coaching career at Kansas |- | style=\"background-color:#; color: #\"|Record | Number of career games won-lost at Kansas |- | style=\"background- color:#; color: #\"|Percent | Percentage of games won at Kansas |- | style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; border:1px solid #aaaaaa; width:3em\"| * |Elected to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Notes: * In 1919, Karl Schlademan coached, and won, the first game of the season before relinquishing the coaching position to Allen in order to concentrate on his duties as head track coach. * In 1947, Howard Engleman coached 14 games (going 8\u20136) after Allen was ordered to take a rest following the 13th game of the season. Engleman's record is not listed in this table as he was never officially a head coach at the university. Updated March 19, 2018 ==Facilities== ===Snow Hall (1898\u20131927)=== Before 1907 the Jayhawks played in various venues, ranging from the basement of the original Snow Hall (even though the ceiling was only 14 feet high) to the skating rink at the local YMCA. Although a current campus building bears the same name, the original Snow Hall was demolished in 1934. ===Robinson Gymnasium (1907\u20131927)=== Robinson Gym was the first athletic building on the KU campus and featured a 2,500-seat auditorium used for basketball purposes. The building was demolished in 1967. ===Hoch Auditorium (1927\u20131955)=== Hoch Auditorium was a 3,500 seat multi-purpose arena in Lawrence, Kansas. It opened in 1927. It was home to the University of Kansas Jayhawks basketball teams until Allen Fieldhouse opened in 1955. Many of Hoch's nicknames during the basketball years were \"Horrible Hoch\" and \"The House of Horrors.\" Such nicknames were in reference to the difficulty opposing teams had in dealing with the tight area surrounding the court and the curved walls and decorative lattice work directly behind the backboards. The curvature of the walls made the backboards appear to be moving causing opponents to miss free throws. On June 15, 1991, Hoch Auditorium was struck by lightning. The auditorium and stage area were completely destroyed. Only the limestone facade and lobby area were spared. When reconstruction of the building was complete, the rear half of the building was named Budig Hall, for then KU Chancellor Gene Budig. The name on the facade was altered to reflect the presence of three large auditorium-style lecture halls within the building: Hoch Auditoria. ===Allen Fieldhouse (1955\u2013present)=== Inside of Allen Fieldhouse Allen Fieldhouse was dedicated on March 1, 1955 when the Jayhawks defeated in-state rival, Kansas State 77\u201367. Since February 20, 1994, the Jayhawks have lost only 14 regular season games in Allen Fieldhouse, a 263\u201314 record (.951). Since February 3, 2007, the Jayhawks have gone 140\u20133 (.979) at Allen Fieldhouse, as of April 2, 2015, the best home record in all of basketball. Allen Fieldhouse is also notorious for its noise level as well. On November 4, 2010, ESPN The Magazine named Allen Fieldhouse the loudest college basketball arena in the country, reaching sustained decibel levels over 120. On February 13, 2017 in a game against Big 12 opponent West Virginia, fans at Allen Fieldhouse broke the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd roar at an indoor sporting event with a roar of 130.4 decibels, which had been broken by Kentucky on January 28 against Kansas. The Booth Family Hall of Athletics is the future home of Dr. Naismith's Original 13 Rules Of Basketball, purchased at auction by the Booth family for $4.3 million on December 10, 2010. Plans for the document's enshrinement there are in the early stages. Kansas won 69 consecutive games at the Fieldhouse between February 3, 2007 and January 17, 2011 until Texas ended the longest streak in NCAA Division I since 1992 with a 74\u201363 win against Kansas on January 22, 2011. This streak broke Kansas' previous school record of 62, which lasted from February 26, 1994 through December 18, 1998 (during which time, the Jayhawks, along with the remaining members of the Big Eight Conference merged with the remaining members of the Southwest Conference to become charter members of the Big 12 Conference). The Jayhawks also completed a 55-game streak between February 22, 1984 through January 30, 1988, which is a Big 8 record. ==Home game traditions== Before the start of every Jayhawks home game, before the singing of \"The Star-Spangled Banner\", it is a tradition to sing the alma mater, \"Crimson and the Blue\". While singing the alma mater, it is tradition for the students in attendance to put an arm over the shoulders of their neighbors and slowly sway side to side, lifting their arms over their heads as the last line of the song is sung. The song is concluded by the Rock Chalk Chant. Post-game, the band will play a rendition of the state of Kansas anthem \"Home on the Range\", which the crowd will stand up for similar to the national anthem. After singing The Star-Spangled Banner, while the opposing team is being introduced, members of the student section take out a copy of the student-run newspaper, The University Daily Kansan, and wave the paper in front of their faces, pretending to be reading it in an effort to show lack of interest in the opposing team. After the opponents are introduced, a short video is shown, detailing the history and the accomplishments of Kansas basketball. As the Jayhawks are introduced, the students rip up their newspapers and throw the confetti pieces of paper in the air as celebration. Whatever confetti remains is typically thrown in the air after the first basket made by the Jayhawks. If an opposing player fouls out of the game, the fans will \"wave the wheat\", waving their arms back and forth, as a sarcastic good-bye to the disqualified player, to the tune of \"You Didn't Have Your Wheaties\", from a series of 1970s television commercials promoting Wheaties breakfast cereal. The same waving motion to the tune of \"A Hot Time in the Old Town\" follows a Jayhawk victory. If the Jayhawks are leading comfortably near the end of the game, the crowd begins a slow version of the Rock Chalk Chant, which has become the signature tradition of Allen Fieldhouse. The chant can also occasionally be heard at neutral sites, such as arenas for the NCAA tournament and the nearby Sprint Center on the Missouri side of Kansas City which during the regular season serves as an alternate home arena. Fans and students will also line up early for Late Night In The Phog, which is the first practice of the season.
