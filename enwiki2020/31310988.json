    "text": "The Georgian Special Operations Forces (GSOF) () are the special operations forces component of the Defense Forces of Georgia. They have been established to conduct special operations, special-and long range reconnaissance, military counter intelligence, counter terrorism, counter insurgency, amphibious and asymmetric warfare in and outside Georgia.https://mod.gov.ge/ge/page/24/specialuri-operaciebis-dzalebi Georgian Special Operation Forces are subordinated under the MOD Special Operations Main Division to a brigade-level command structure. Each formation is split into several sub-divisions which are allocated on different Georgian regions, cities and strategically important areas. Most instructor units are composed of veterans of past conflicts including the Soviet\u2013Afghan War and the internal conflicts in Georgia. Officers and instructors served as in former Soviet Army or NATO special services. ==History== The very first of such formations was founded during the War in Abkhazia in 1992.http://georgiatoday.ge/news/5263/Georgia%E2%80%99s-Special-Operations- Forces-Celebrate-17th-Anniversary At the time there was no clear division between paramilitary and military units while cadres that received training from former Soviet and Russian instructors generally enjoyed more popularity among the Georgian leadership. A lot of effort was put into the establishment of a sustainable system of development of special military units, which was achieved in 1999. In order to replace the Soviet model with something that would resemble highest international standards the so-called SOF Train and Equip Program was established with financial and material assistance from Turkey. Some officers had already completed Army Rangers and SF courses in the United States. Because Georgia lacked the infrastructure and means at that time, the first applicants and candidates for Georgian special forces were sent to Turkey to train there. Since 2001, Georgia has intensified the training of its elite forces in cooperation with American, French, British, Israeli and other countries' special services.Israel, Georgia: Israel To Halt Arms Sales To Georgia . Stratfor. 5 August 2008.http://mod.gov.ge/index.php?l=E&m;=5&sm;=12&ssm;=3&acm;=2 In 2002 as part of the Georgia Train and Equip program over 2000 soldiers including 1000 paramilitary troops were trained by US instructors for special-and counter terrorism operations. About $65 million were invested by the United States for the training of 400 army commandos and state security forces.https://www.stripes.com/news/first-georgian-soldiers-graduate-from-u-s- sponsored-training-program-1.300#.WZDZKlWrQUE In the framework of said program over $6 million were committed by the Georgian government itself to properly arm and supply the country's special forces battalion so that training in accordance to US and NATO standards was ensured. The US 10th Special Forces Group of SOCOM was tasked with assisting in setting up the proper infrastructure and training ground for Georgia's special operations forces, identified by NATO as GSOF.http://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2003/1/31/2003february- special-ops-forces-are-tool-of-choice Georgian commandos were part of KFOR, played a limited role during the 2001 Macedonia insurgency and participated in the Iraq War from 2003 until the complete withdrawal of the Georgian contingent in 2008 due to an escalation of hostilities in South Ossetia. Another $11.5 million were raised by the US in 2008 for special forces training. However, as a result of the Russo-Georgian conflict the US ceased providing any type of assistance in training Georgian forces, including special forces as unofficial and undeclared embargoes were in full effect against the country until a new government took over in 2012.https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CPRT-111SPRT53985/pdf/CPRT-111SPRT53985.pdfhttp://www.tabula.ge/en/story/70011-the- embargo-that-never-was Despite that brief setback a foundation had been laid and Georgia's elite units became much less dependent on foreign assistance. Instead focus was shifted towards cooperation, bilateral exercises and inter- operability with their NATO and European, particularly Eastern European counterparts. Georgian special forces have taken part in numerous international missions and joint exercises.https://sputniknews.com/military/201605201039980489-drills- lithuania-forces/http://www.radiocraiova.ro/exercitiul-multinational-junction- strike-16-in-romania/http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri- esential-20264351-fotogalerie-imagini-cel-mai-amplu-exercitiu-desfasurat- fortele-speciale-din-armata-romana-impreuna-militari-americani-moldoveni-din- alte-tari-europene.htm Following the 2014 Wales summit joint training exercises between US-and Georgian special forces officially renewed and since then are held on a regular basis. Several NATO certifications were achieved in 2017 following multinational manoeuvers. Another close partner besides SOCOM is the Polish Special Forces Command, in particular JW GROM, JWK and AGAT which took part in the general assessment, mentoring and qualification leading to a NATO operational certification for GSOF.https://www.janes.com/images/assets/244/73244/Elite_assistance_the_future_of_special_forces_partnering.pdfhttp://polska- zbrojna.pl/home/articleshow/23774?t=Gruzinscy-specjalsi-blizej-NATO The years long assessment and enhancement of operational capabilities culminated in a final certification during a 2017 exercise in which several Polish special forces components played the opposing force against their Georgian counterparts. GSOF is thereby NATO certified and qualified to operate a Special Operations Task Group or SOTG within Alliance structures, which is unique for non-Nato countries.https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/special- operations/georgian-sf-become-nato-certified/ Joint exercises and qualification with Polish SOF are commenced on a regular basis since 2013.http://en.mon.gov.pl/news/article/latest-news/polish-special-forces- cooperation-with-georgia-w2016-04-08/http://www.polska- zbrojna.pl/home/articleshow/23761?t=Miedzynarodowe-cwiczenia-wojsk- specjalnychhttp://www.polskieradio.pl/5/3/Artykul/1604999,Wojska-specjalne- Polski-i-Gruzji-zaciesniaja-wspolprace ===Early 1990s=== Several elite units were formed during the early 1990s. Those included state security group ALFA and another Russian trained special battalion called \"Orbi\" which was considered more or less a military counterpart. Their members were trained primarily by Russian officers from Spetsnaz and equipped with heavy military hardware. Both units were part of the garrison in the coastal town Gagra which was struck by a massed separatist assault during the War in Abkhazia. Despite initial success for the defenders Gagra was quickly overrun. Russian involvement became very apparent in that period when an unidentified force consisting of hundreds of soldiers with unmarked uniforms were landed at the coast south of the town and started to push against the Georgian defences in the area. Part of the same force also headed towards Gagra. In the ensuing encounter which was very costly for both sides, the Georgians lost another 30 men including a few of the surviving special forces members. Gocha Karkarashvili and 11 of his men were killed when defending Gagra to their last moment.http://abkhazworld.com/aw/conflict/543-military-aspects-of-the-war-d- billingsley However both sides kept commencing raids and skirmishes against each other after the war and specifically throughout the late 1990s.https://worldview.stratfor.com/article/commando-assaults-threaten- georgian-abkhaz-peace ===Pankisi Gorge=== In 2002 Georgia carried out a special operation in the infamous Pankisi Gorge known for its supposed hosting of militant groups and criminals elements. The aim was to surround and force the surrender of armed Chechen saboteurs formations that crossed the border. Clashes and arrests occurred all over the region when Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that the Georgian government handle the situation as it presented a direct threat. It has also been suggested that the US urged Georgia to take action in order to prevent further deterioration of an already tense political environment. The Georgian special forces would continuously transfer captured insurgents to Russian special services. Georgian special forces have been accused multiple times to have carried out numerous assassinations and acts of sabotage in North Caucasus(Russia) and within the separatist regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Russia also accused Georgia of using its special forces to train and equip Chechen militants in the Pankisi Gorge who then would pass the Georgian-Russian border to commit terrorist acts in the Russian Federation. The situation in the Gorge is yet still disputed as Georgia itself states to have the Gorge cleared of militant activities contradicting the claims of Russian authorities. ===South Ossetia 2008=== Georgian special operations forces took part in several engagements of the 2008 war. They supported a mobile task force consisting of Interior Ministry special forces that formed the spearhead for the assault on Tskhinvali center. Their most notable involvement was in the attack on general Khrulyov's command battalion on 9 August.https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/09/24/natos-endless-caucasian-courtship/ Early Russian reports gave full credit to Georgian commandos for the near complete destruction of the trapped unit.http://www.apn.ru/publications/article20625.htm However, later Russian claims suggest it was more likely part of a combined assault from different military elements including armor. In either case, the Georgian special forces engaged in fighting were fewer in numbers but able to disrupt and stall much larger enemy forces until the general withdrawal.http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/publications/articles/here-s-how- nato-can-open-a-path-to-membership-for-georgia There are also claims that Russian special forces prevented Georgian saboteurs from damaging or destroying the Roki tunnel, Russia's main supply line for the conflict region.https://sputniknews.com/analysis/20080820116170190/ One special forces member is confirmed to have died in the war.http://mod.gov.ge/index.php?page=-10&Id;=31\u27e8=1 Sergeant Kakhaber Tavgorashvili, who was assistant counter-terrorist instructor, was reportedly killed by an Ossetian sniper at Shanghai street in Tskhinvali on 8 August.https://www.mod.gov.ge/c/news/opening-of-the-memorial- board?lang=enghttp://georgiaupdate.gov.ge/en/tagliavini/2e23d3845c1828554649713a4b935d3a/a5779fdef6136ecd98e3631e109e9ffd/4cbc30c68c5f8abbbf0cb74936d7c98f Some 55 sustained mostly light injuries as a result of fighting and shelling.http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc/1600839 ===Lopota Valley=== In 2012 one combat medic of the special forces, corporal Vladimer Khvedelidze, was killed during a controversial engagement with 20 armed militants crossing the Georgian-Dagestani border.http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25164https://www.mod.gov.ge/c/news/military- serviceman-killed-in-lopota-gorge-was-buried-today?lang=eng According to the official version, security forces were reinforced by military after a group of armed men took locals hostage and demanded ransom. The local residents were released when a trapped border guard officer offered himself as hostage instead insisting he had a much higher value for them. The armed group was offered negotiations but refused the unprofitable conditions and threatened to take the negotiator. In that moment Georgia's anti terror unit opened fire and killed one of the militants. During the firefight 10 more were killed but also one MIA security officer. In midst of the shootout the army special forces corpsman tried to evacuate a wounded officer but got attacked and both men died on the spot.http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25164http://www.civil.ge/eng/article.php?id=25155 ===Involvement in the Ukraine conflict=== In May 2015 Georgian special forces were claimed by Ukrainian officials and also have been accused by Russia and the Donetsk People's Republic to have apprehended Russian nationals fighting with the separatists because they were suspected to be members of Russian special services and military intelligence.http://novorossia.today/georgian- special-forces-involved-in-detention-of-russian-nationals-in-east-ukraine- dpr/http://tass.ru/en/world/795867ahttp://sputniknews.com/europe/20150520/1022380115.html Georgian nationals, mostly retired servicemen, including former special forces members and police have been confirmed to be fighting with the Ukrainian army intelligence and security services.http://en.hunternews.ru/?p=3276 Georgian instructors were also involved in training Ukraine's special forces.http://uatoday.tv/politics/israeli-and-us-military-instructors-train- ukrainian-special-forces-422959.html In October 2015 both countries discussed further cooperation that would allow Ukrainian special forces personnel to be trained in Georgia, particularly the Mountain Warfare School.http://www.kyivpost.com/article/content/ukraine/ukrainian-georgian- military-general-staff-discuss-cooperation-on-mountain-special-operations- forces-training-400396.html ==Participation in International Peacekeeping Missions== ===Kosovo Force=== Georgia's first involvement in peacekeeping operations was part of the KFOR mission. In 1999 a platoon consisting of 34 members of the newly formed unit was stationed in Mamu\u0161a as part of the Turkish contingent. They were distinguishable by their shoulder patches and berets but used Turkish equipment. Their primary task was to provide security to the town and protect ethnic minorities from reprisal and violence. Later the contingent was reinforced by an infantry company under German command.http://www.nato.int/Kfor/chronicle/1999/chronicle_199903/p11.htmhttp://eu- nato.gov.ge/sites/default/files/ENGLISH.pdf During the 2001 insurgency in Macedonia the special forces platoon was deployed at the border to combat and disarm insurgent forces that intended to cross over into Kosovo. ===Operation Iraqi Freedom=== In August 2003 Georgia deployed a 70 men strong detachment to Iraq. The contingent consisted of special forces, a sapper unit and medical personnel. The special forces were stationed in Baiji, Iraq and served as QRF. Their task was to respond to insurgent attacks on Coalition forces and other peacekeeping elements as well as conduct patrols, provide base security, VIP and convoy protection in conjunction with U.S. counterparts.https://sof.mod.gov.ge/ge/page/22/saertashoriso-misiebi Equipment and ammunition was provided by the U.S. They were also assisting in intercepting weapon smuggling over the Iranian border and provide security to officials.http://www.pravdareport.com/world/ussr/19-03-2003/1939-georgia-0/http://www.themilitant.com/2003/6745/674557.html The contingent would abandon its mission in 2008 due to the outbreak of the Russo-Georgian war. ===ISAF=== Towards the end of the ISAF mission from March to October 2014 the former Mountain-Reconnaissance Battalion was deployed to Afghanistan, mainly stationed at the Kandahar Air Base amidst the withdrawal process.http://1tv.ge/en/news/view/76751.html The unit's mission was to provide security and carry out patrols and combat operations. Prior to deployment the battalion's soldiers participated and prepared in extensive mission rehearsal exercises with U.S. troops in Hohenfels Germany.https://www.dvidshub.net/news/146810/georgian-special-mountain- battalion-ends-afghan-mission-with- ceremony#.Vznc1biLTRYhttp://agenda.ge/news/21484/eng ===Resolute Support=== One reinforced Ranger company was deployed to Afghanistan as part of the Resolute Support Mission. It was tasked with providing security and protection to RSM headquarters.http://www.centcom.mil/MEDIA/VIDEO-AND- IMAGERY/VIDEOS/dvpTag/Ranger/ The Rangers were also part of the force that repelled the Taliban attack on the German consulate in 2016.https://sputniknews.com/asia/201611111047333613-german-consulate- afghanistan-attack/http://www.tabula.ge/en/story/114485-georgian-soldiers- thanked-for-defending-german-consulate-in-afghanistan ==Cooperation and interoperability with NATO forces== Georgian special operations forces work closely with and are advised and monitored by US SOCOM, POL SOCC and United States Special Operations Command Europe respectively.https://www.shephardmedia.com/news/special-operations/georgian- sf-become-nato-certified/ The US 10th Special Forces Group took a pivotal role in creating a training and education basis for GSOF to be able to conduct training and qualification befitting US and NATO standards. Currently as of 2017 the GSOF are being prepared by SOCOM for instructor and advisory roles for conventional multinational forces and be able to assist, conduct and lead joint training exercises and international missions like their US counterparts.https://www.defense.gov/News/Article/Article/1279830/noble- partner-supports-georgias-nato-response-force-integration/ At the same time GSOF operators receive advanced training by JW GROM in NATO operational procedures while working together with AGAT and qualify in Polish lead multinational special forces manoeuvers for NATO certifications and access to broader education. The years-long cultivation of cooperation and mutual assistance helps the GSOF align with NATO operational doctrines and prepare for eventual membership in addition to successful mission deployments alongside NATO counterparts and forces in general.http://polska- zbrojna.pl/home/articleshow/23777?t=-Kobra-17-czas-na-uderzenie ==Organization== Georgian and Romanian SOF soldiers during simulated campsite assault, part of exercise Junction Strike 2015 Ukrainian Marines during a multinational maneuver, 2017https://www.kyivpost.com/ukraine- politics/ukrainian-marines-take-part-noble-partner-2017-multinational-drills- georgia.html In 2019 the special operations forces were divided into two main operational groups for Eastern and Western Operational Command respectively: the acting formations and their sub units as two autonomous forces and the Special Operations Training Center which contains all training and educational arms of the branch. ===Special Operations Forces=== Current structure as of 2020.https://sof.mod.gov.ge/ge/page/3/istoria *Finance and Accounting Service *Headquarters *22px Special Operations Forces ** Special Operations Battalion ** Naval Special Operations Squadron ( Company ) ** Ranger Battalion *Special Operations Training Center named after Major Gela Chedia *Staff Company The Special Operations Battalion and supplementary Frogman Company are the primary air-land-sea deployable special operations forces of the Defense Forces of Georgia. They are subordinate to the primary HQ but as part of the respective autonomous military commands, maintain their own sub divisions such as staffs, control-communications & counterintelligence, medical, logistics and supply unit as well other supporting elements. Both units are expected to carry out the full spectrum of special operations, including direct action, special reconnaissance and support tasks in their assigned areas of operation. The Naval Special Operations Squadron provides the naval warfare components of the force and is responsible for the training and development in that area. There is always at least one team from each company in full combat readiness, while the rest conduct training, exercises and education classes.https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/27/2704332_re-land-forces-of- georgia-.html In a constant cycle numerous types of firing drills are being exercised through day and night by one group while another group is training on explosives, a third one in hand-to-hand combat, a fourth in weapons specialisation and so forth.http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1600839 The Ranger Battalion was established as SOF support component in 2009.https://sof.mod.gov.ge/ge/page/3/istoria ===Special Operations Training Center=== The training center consists of following: *Staff -S1 -S2 -S3 -S4 -S5 -S6 -S7 *Command *Special Operations School *Rangers Preparation School *Snipers Preparation School *Paratroopers Preparation School *Evaluation Development Section *Logistical Support & Transport Company Function and mission of the training center is to ensure the development of programs for the development of military servicemen for special subunits, organize and conduct basic courses of special military training in accordance to specialization and provide training and further retraining of the personnel and / or collectively qualified military personnel within the competence.

However that regulation does not deny them entrance to the special operations forces in general. There have been cases of female individuals passing the application and qualification courses, in one recorded case even surpassing the scores of some of their fellow male candidates. However such individuals were excluded from combat assignment. The special operations forces reportedly have had a female sniper. Passing the special forces sniper course is one of the most challenging in the Georgian military.https://www.kvirispalitra.ge/samkhedro-thema/27065-qdaundoblebiq- gaicanith-qarthuli-armiis-mriskhane-iaraghi.html ==Selection and courses== The four main education and training schools are the Special Forces School, Rangers School, Snipers School and Airborne School, which vary in admission criteria, requirements and difficulty.
