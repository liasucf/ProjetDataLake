Justin Timberlake - Dead And Gone Official Music Video In it, T.I. is filmed driving through a desert landscape, interspersed with shots of Justin Timberlake standing alone in the desert or playing a piano. T.I. eventually drives up in a '67 Camaro SS and meets with Timberlake and they continue the song together as the camera circles around them. Shortly before the final rendition of the chorus, there is a break in the music and a brief montage of images, with the words \"good\", \"evil\", and \"redemption\", appears. As the song draws to a close, T.I. is seen returning to his car and driving off, leaving Timberlake standing alone once again in the dark, with his piano set ablaze in the background. The very end of the video shows T.I. getting out of the car and entering a prison whose gates close behind him. This is a cliffhanger that is resolved in \"Remember Me\".
