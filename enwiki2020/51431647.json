    "text": "|} The El Gran Senor Stakes is a Listed flat horse race in Ireland open to thoroughbreds aged two years only. It is run at Tipperary over a distance of 7 furlongs and 100 yards (1,513 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in August. The race was first run in 2003 as the El Gran Senor Stakes. However, as is the case for the Tipperary Stakes, the name is regularly changed to advertise one of the Coolmore Stud stallions. Churchill has been the beneficiary since 2020, preceded by Caravaggio (2018-19), Ivawood (2017), Canford Cliffs (2012-2016), Hurricane Run (2008-2011) and Ad Valorem (2007). ==Winners== {| class = \"sortable\" | border=\"1\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; font-size:90%\" |- bgcolor=\"#77dd77\" align=\"center\" ! style=\"width:36px\" | Year ! style=\"width:160px\" | Winner ! style=\"width:180px\" | Jockey ! style=\"width:180px\" | Trainer ! style=\"width:60px\" | Time |- | 2003 | Simple Exchange | Pat Smullen | Dermot Weld | 1:24.10 |- | 2004 | Gaff | Pat Smullen | Dermot Weld | 1:30.00 |- | 2005 | Rhythm'n Roots | D J Moran | Jim Bolger | 1:42.20 |- | 2006 | Zafonical Storm | D J Moran | B W Duke | 1:40.40 |- | 2007 | Lisvale | Wayne Lordan | David Wachman | 1:39.10 |- | 2008 | Westphalia | Johnny Murtagh | Aidan O'Brien | 1:39.77 |- | 2009 | Viscount Nelson | Johnny Murtagh | Aidan O'Brien | 1:37.61 |- | 2010 | Snow Watch | Declan McDonogh | Kevin Prendergast | 1:35.67 |- | 2011 | Strait Of Zanzibar | Shane Foley | Ken Condon | 1:37.53 |- | 2012 | First Cornerstone | Chris Hayes | A Oliver | 1:38.82 |- | 2013 | Indian Maharaja | Joseph O'Brien | Aidan O'Brien | 1:33.96 |- | 2014 | Convergence | Colin Keane | Ger Lyons | 1:35.59 |- | 2015 | Waipu Cove | Colin Keane | Ger Lyons | 1:40.86 |- | 2016 | Capri | Seamie Heffernan | Aidan O'Brien | 1:36.43 |- | 2017 | Ballet Shoes | Donnacha O'Brien | Aidan O'Brien | 1:37.40 |- | 2018 | Christmas | Donnacha O'Brien | Aidan O'Brien | 1:36.03 |- | 2019 | Justifier | Colin Keane | Ger Lyons |1:39.20 |- | 2020 | Sweet Gardenia | Robbie Colgan | John Joseph Murphy | 1:38.92 |} ==See also== * Horse racing in Ireland * List of Irish flat horse races ==References== *Racing Post: **, , , , , , , , , **, , , Category:Flat races in Ireland Category:Tipperary Racecourse Category:Flat horse races for two-year-olds Category:Recurring sporting events established in 2003 Category:2003 establishments in Ireland ",
