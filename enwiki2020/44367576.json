He was the author of many famous works, such as ', El aguacero (lyrics by ), ' and Caser\u00f3n de tejas (both with music by ), Mar\u00eda and ' (both with music by An\u00edbal Troilo), and El \u00faltimo caf\u00e9 (with music by ). The tango La calesita, which he composed with Mariano Mores, inspired the film of the same name directed in 1962 by Hugo del Carril. His father, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Castillo, an anarchist, wanted to list himself in the civil registry as Descanso Dominical Gonz\u00e1lez Castillo, but was convinced by his friends not to, and kept his other name.Interview with Riardo Horvath. Accessed 20 July 2008. As an infant, C\u00e1tulo lived in Chile, where his father was exiled because of his anarchist ideology. He returned to Argentina in 1913. C\u00e1tulo later affiliated with the Communist Party. ==Professional career== x200px C\u00e1tulo composed Organito de la tarde, his first tango, at the age of 17. He was also a boxer, eventually becoming the featherweight champion in Argentina and was pre-selected for the Paris Olympics, attending as part of his country's delegation, but not competing. In 1926, he traveled to Europe, where he would later conduct his own orchestra. During the 1930s, he obtained one of the cathedras of the Municipal Conservatory of Manuel de Falla in Buenos Aires. In 1950, he would become the director of that conservatory, where he remained until he retired. During the 1940s and 1950s, when tango was at its peak, he dedicated himself to poetry and wrote with distinguished composers: Mores (Patio de la Morocha), (Anoche), Pugliese (Una vez), Sebasti\u00e1n Piana (Tinta roja and Caser\u00f3n de tejas), and his main collaborator after 1945: An\u00edbal Troilo (Mar\u00eda, La \u00faltima curda, Una canci\u00f3n). He wrote for many journals, published the book Danzas Argentinas in 1953, composed songs for different films, wrote the lyrical sainete El Patio de la Morocha (with music by Troilo), and was both secretary and president of SADAIC in different years. In 1953, he became president of the National Commission of Culture of the Nation. Two years later, the military government, the so-called Revoluci\u00f3n Libertadora, stripped him of everything he had achieved. His wife, Amanda Pelufo, recalls those times: Because of persecution by Pedro Eugenio Aramburu's government, he had to abandon his profession. Included on blacklists with dozens of other tangueros like Hugo de Carril, Nelly Omar, , Anita Palmero, and Chola Luna, among others, he was persecuted for his political ideas, and did not return to work until the regime's fall. With the political thaw in the 1960s, C\u00e1tulo returned to his former activity. He continued composing, writing radical screenplays, and working in SADAIC. He published the novel Amalio Reyes, un hombre, which became a film directed by Hugo del Carril. He also published Prostibulario, on his correspondence with Per\u00f3n, in 1971. Among his most popular songs were: Maria, El \u00faltimo caf\u00e9, La \u00faltima curda, La Calesita, Caf\u00e9 de los Angelitos, Desencuentro, Y a mi qu\u00e9, A Homero, Arrabalera, Mensaje, Tinta roja, Patio m\u00edo, and Caser\u00f3n de tejas. In 1974, he was named Illustrious Citizen of Buenos Aires. Upon receiving the award, he told a short fable: ==Death== He died 19 October 1975 from a heart attack. ==Filmography== ;Author * El patio de la morocha (1951) * La calesita (1963) * Amalio Reyes, un hombre (1970) * ' (1999) ;Music * Internado (1935) * Juan Moreira (1936) * ' (1940) * Arrabalera (1950) ;Soundtracks * Ay\u00fadame a vivir (1936) * Eclipse de sol (1942) * Buenos Aires a la vista (1950) * Vivir un instante (1951) * La muerte flota en el r\u00edo (1956) * ' (1989) ;Texts * \u00c9sta es mi Argentina (1974) ==References== ==Bibliography== * * ==External links== * C\u00e1tulo Castillo, Todo Tango * Informaci\u00f3n sobre C\u00e1tulo Castillo on the Argentine national film website Category:1906 births Category:1975 deaths Category:Writers from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine male poets Category:20th-century Argentine poets Category:20th-century Argentine male writers Category:Burials at La Chacarita Cemetery Category:20th-century composers Category:Argentine composers Category:Illustrious Citizens of Buenos Aires Category:Sportspeople from Buenos Aires Category:Argentine male boxers Category:Featherweight boxers ",
