    "text": "Samuel Okon Peter (born 6 September 1980) is a Nigerian professional boxer. He held the WBC heavyweight title in 2008, when he stopped Oleg Maskaev in six rounds. In his prime, he was known for his rivalry with the Klitschko brothers, having faced Wladimir twice (in 2005 and 2010) and Vitali once. Peter is known for his punching power and holds a 78.9% knockout-to-win ratio. ==Early years and amateur career== Originally, Peter's preferred sport was football. In 1992, some boxers came to his school to train. The curious young 11-year-old stopped by and asked if he could train along with them. He was put up against an experienced amateur and knocked him out. This marked the beginning of a successful amateur career for Peter. He won the Nigerian Amateur Heavyweight Championship and the Africa Zone 3 Heavyweight Championship. He faced stiff competition as an amateur (including a knockout victory over 2000 silver medalist Mukhtarkhan Dildabekov of Kazakhstan). However, he prevailed and was given the opportunity to represent Nigeria at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. Peter lost in the quarterfinals to Italian Paolo Vidoz by decision. However, his performance was noted for being very impressive from such a young pugilist and hence more excitement was generated for him than the eventual gold medalist, Audley Harrison, to whom Peter had lost a very close decision just a few months before the Olympics. ==Professional career== === Early career === Immediately after the Olympics, Ivaylo Gotzev signed on as Peter's manager, and Andy \"Pops\" Anderson became his coach. They were then able to land a promotional deal with Dino Duva of Duva Boxing. Though Peter posted a string of 1st-round knockouts at the beginning of his career, he fought to 2 consecutive decisions against Charles Shufford and Jovo Pudar in 2004. Some critics asked if Peter could exhibit the one-punch knockout power he had exhibited in his early days against stronger opposition. He won a victory against Jeremy Williams on December 4, 2004 by knockout 27 seconds into the second round, to win the vacant WBC-NABF heavyweight title. Williams was out cold for several minutes following the knockout. He then defeated Yanqui D\u00edaz on 22 January 2005 to win the vacant IBF-USBA heavyweight title, knocking him down five times along the way. Peter then went on to defeat WBA-NABA heavyweight champion Taurus Sykes in Reno, Nevada on 2 July 2005 trained by Andy \"Pops\" Anderson in a unification match. ===Peter vs. Wladimir Klitschko I=== On 24 September 2005 he faced Wladimir Klitschko in an elimination match in Atlantic City for the IBF title, in which Peter's WBC-NABF title was also on the line. Coming into the bout, Klitschko was viewed by many as the underdog against the 7-to-5 favorite Peter who had won all of his 24 fights, with 21 of them having ended inside the distance. At the time, Samuel Peter was considered one of the brightest prospects in the heavyweight division. Distinguished boxing coaches Angelo Dundee and Teddy Atlas expected Peter to win.. \u00abBolshoi ring\u00bb. (rus.) Wladimir's team, including his brother Vitali, were worried about Wladimir, and were against this fight to happen. Wladimir, however, insisted on fighting Peter, claiming that beating a feared, hard-hitting fighter like Samuel Peter would help him to regain his stock and become mandatory challenger for two heavyweight belts. The first four rounds were tentative, with Peter not being to close the distance. At the end of the third, Peter staggered Klitschko with a powerful left hook. He hurt Klitschko again in the fifth with another left hook, sending Klitschko to the canvas with the rabbit punch. The referee counted it as the knockdown. Peter immediately went for the attack after Klitschko got up, dropping him again with the rabbit punch. The referee scored it as the second knockdown.Alexander Belienkiy: Golden Klitschko brother, p. 188\u2013190 (rus.). Peter was outboxed through sixth to ninth rounds, frequently trying to hit Klitschko with the rabbit punch whenever escaping from a clinch. Near the end of the tenth round Peter staggered Wladimir with a hard right hand, eventually sending Klitschko to the canvas with another right when Wladimir was backing away. In the 11th and 12th rounds, Klitschko was trying to keep Peter at the distance using straight punches. Peter caught Klitschko with a left hook in the last round, but was unable to capitalize on it. Instead, Klitschko caught him with a hard counter left hook of his own, staggering Peter for the first time in the fight. Eventually the bout went the distance, with Peter losing the fight by unanimous decision (UD). All the judges scored the bout identically 114\u2013111. On 15 December 2005, Peter faced Robert Hawkins and won a 10-round decision. He regained the WBC-NABF title (vacated by Klitschko after his victory) on 28 April 2006, by defeating Julius Long. ===Peter vs. Toney I, II=== His next bout was a fight with heavyweight contender James Toney on 2 September 2006 at the Staples Center in Los Angeles for the right to challenge WBC heavyweight champion Oleg Maskaev. Peter would win by split decision; however, the WBC would find adequate cause to order a rematch. For this fight against Toney, Manny Masson was brought in to train Peter. On 6 January 2007, Peter defeated Toney in the rematch by unanimous decision (UD). The official judges' scorecards read 119\u2013108, 118\u2013110, 118\u2013110. ===Peter vs. McCline=== After defeating Toney, he had earned the right to challenge the WBC heavyweight champion. A match against Oleg Maskaev was scheduled for 6 October 2007. However, Maskaev pulled out of the fight due to a back injury. This led the WBC to proclaim Peter their interim heavyweight champion. Jameel McCline was scheduled to fight Vitali Klitschko on 22 September for a title elimination. However, the fight was canceled because Klitschko had suffered a back injury in training. Under these conditions, a fight was arranged between Peter and McCline. Peter stepped into the ring as the champion trying to defend his title. Much controversy preceded the match since McCline had been accused of using illegal substances in 2005 and 2006, but the organizers decided to let the fight happen despite of this. Lab analysis would be available about 5 days after the fight. Peter almost pulled out of the fight due to a hand injury he had sustained due to inadequate hand- wrapping during his training camp in the Poconos but the situation was resolved when Manny Masson took complete control of Peter's hand-wrapping. On 6 October at 10 p.m, in Madison Square Garden, Peter was knocked down 3 times in the second and third round by McCline, who had a height advantage of almost 6 inches. Though he seemed badly hurt in the third round, Peter managed to get up and eventually won the remaining rounds to win the match with a unanimous decision and retain his title as the WBC interim heavyweight title. As in the second Toney fight the key to Peter's victory was the use of his triple jab, footwork, head movement, and combination punching which is also attributable to his trainer Manny Masson. He kept Mccline off with the jab and then forced him backwards in the final minute of each round to score points. Mccline was perhaps tired from throwing so many power punches early on. Nevertheless, Peter outworked him for the better part of nine rounds. ===WBC heavyweight champion=== As interim champion, he was a mandatory challenger for the WBC belt held by Oleg Maskaev, who had been inactive since December 2006 due to injury. This long-anticipated fight took place on 8 March 2008, at the principal bullfighting venue in Canc\u00fan, Mexico. Peter won by TKO, with the referee stopping the fight with only a few seconds remaining in the sixth round. Peter used far less movement than he had in his previous two bouts against Maskaev, from the first round onwards both were trading heavy shots. In round three Peter staggered Maskaev and was then rocked in return. Maskaev had not been able to really hurt Peter. Peter used his jab to pursue Maskaev in the sixth and eventually broke through with a big right hand. Maskaev staggered backwards and Peter moved in for the finish. Peter continued to pummel Maskaev on the ropes while Oleg tried to motion to the referee about rabbit punches. The referee stepped in with seconds remaining as Maskaev staggered backwards into the corner. Peter was ahead on all three judges' scorecards at the time of the stoppage. ===Peter vs. Vitali Klitschko=== Following his victory over Maskaev, he publicly challenged IBF, WBO and IBO champion Wladimir Klitschko to a unification bout, which would have been Klitschko's second such fight, as well as his second matchup with Peter (the first ending with a unanimous decision victory for Klitschko). Such a fight would have unified three of the four major titles, the closest the division had been to an undisputed champion since Lennox Lewis relinquished the WBA title (one of the three he then held) by court order on 29 April 2000. Klitschko indicated he might fight Peter, but suggested that Peter should fight his brother Vitali first. Vitali Klitschko had retired as WBC champion in November 2005, and was considered the WBC's champion emeritus, giving him the right to a mandatory challenge under the rules of that organization should he elect to fight again. At the time of his retirement, Vitali was the dominant force in his division. Both had a claim to being the rightful WBC belt holder. Yet there was added importance for the bout; if Vitali were to win it would mean that both brothers would achieve their dream of being heavyweight champions at the same time. On the other hand, if Peter were to win and then challenge Wladimir in a rematch, it would bring the heavyweight division close to the first undisputed title holder in years. Peter accepted the WBC's ruling and the bout was scheduled for 11 October at O2 World Berlin. Peter fought Klitschko on 11 October 2008 in Berlin. Klitschko had a memorable ring entrance with five former heavyweight champions appearing to wish him luck in his comeback. Klitschko would reclaim his belt in dominating fashion. Although he was coming back from a four-year layoff, Klitschko was sharp from the opening bell. Peter had been expected to set the pace and pursue Vitali, instead he spent time outside trying to box his way in. Klitschko took the center of the ring and found Peter an easy target. Peter landed two hard right hands in the second round, but they had almost no effect on Vitali at all. After four rounds Peter's face was swelling and his corner was growing in frustration. His corner implored him to let his hands go and push Vitali back. Peter tried to rally in the sixth round, but only made himself an even more open target for Klitschko's counter punches. The seventh round was extremely punishing for the defending champion as he ate several; left hooks, right crosses and jabs. Peter seemed unresponsive to his corner's advice after a few rounds, totally shocked at the speed and accuracy of his opponent. Klitschko continued with a near punch perfect display. Looking disheartened Peter slumped in his corner after the 8th round. As his corner tried to give him instructions the scores of the fight were read out by the ring announcer. Two judges had Klitschko ahead by 80\u201372, and one by 79\u201373. Peter listened to the scores shook his head and said \"stop it.\" There was some confusion in the Peter corner over what was happening, but although he had not been down or seriously hurt Peter was adamant \"stop the fight.\" He had been dominated the entire fight by Klitschko's efficient outside punching. By retiring on his stool Peter became one of the only heavyweight champions in history to quit against his corner's advice while defending the championship. ===After Klitschko: defeat to Chambers and return to form=== Looking to bounce back to the heavyweight title picture, Peter faced Eddie Chambers on 27 March 2009. The fight took place in Nokia Theatre in Los Angeles, and was aired on ESPN2. Chambers injured his right thumb early in the third round, but was able to outbox Peter for the majority of the fight, frustrating his opponent with speed and quickness and being able to block most of Peter's shots using his gloves and armes. As a result, Chambers was declared the winner by majority decision, with the judges scoring the bout 99\u201391, 96\u201394 and 95\u201395. Some observers criticized the 95\u201395 score, believing Peter had not done enough to win more than three rounds. He fought Marcus McGee on 25 July 2009 in Mexico, knocking him unconscious in the third round with a right hand. He weighed in at a 243 lbs for this fight. His next fight was on 15 September 2009 against the little known Ronald Bellamy. Peter won by second-round knockout. He then fought journeyman Gabe Brown and won by fourth round stoppage. Following his three successful victories over journeymen, Peter took a step up in competition against Nagy Aguilera in an IBF eliminator (Aguilera had earned the position with a stunning first-round knockout of former champion Oleg Maskaev). Peter came in at 237 pounds, the lightest since his seventh pro fight. He dominated an entertaining first round before sending Aguilera down in the second with a right hand counter, Nagy beat the count but was stopped soon after as he was hanging against the ropes, taking heavy shots. Peter then targeted either a rematch with Wladimir Klitschko or a final IBF eliminator with unbeaten Alexander Povetkin. Sensing that Povetkin was not willing to fight Klitschko, Peter made himself available as a replacement opponent. Both Peter and Povetkin were ranked as #1 IBF contenders. ===Peter vs. Wladimir Klitschko II and release from Top Rank=== On 11 September 2010, Peter fought Wladimir Klitschko again at the Commerzbank Arena in Frankfurt, Germany, for the IBF, WBO, and IBO heavyweight titles. Peter weighed in at 241 pounds, two pounds lighter than the first fight. Klitschko came in at a career heavy of 247 pounds. Both fighters had promised knockouts in the pre fight build up. Peter started the fight very aggressively in a bob and weave style he had never before fought in. He caught Klitschko with a good left hook in the opening round, though Klitschko remained unshaken. Klitschko ended the round well. In the second round Klitschko caught Peter with three hard right hands, one of which seemed to stun him. Both fighters struggled to land punches in the third round, there was a lot of clinching in what was a physical encounter. Unlike their first fight referee Robert Byrd did not let Peter punch on the break or hit to the back of the head. After four rounds the fight became one sided, with Peter's right eye closing. Peter could not find the target and started lunging with wild shots, his legs had slowed dramatically and he was taking heavy shots. He did get through with a big right hand in round six though. Klitschko, instead of going backwards as he did in their first fight, would meet Peter in the middle of the ring and dominate him physically in the clinches. Peter was taking heavy punishment and after eight rounds was totally exhausted. After the ninth round Peter's cornerman Abel Sanchez threatened to stop the fight, and said he would give him one more round. Emanuel Steward implored Klitschko to throw combinations. Peter swung wildly in the tenth and Klitschko opened up with a punishing combination which floored him. Referee Robert Byrd did not start a count and waved the fight off, awarding Klitschko the win by knockout. It was Klitschko's ninth successful title defense. The nature of the defeat to Klitschko in the rematch possibly spelled the end of Peter's career as a top level fighter. Top Rank released him from his contract soon after. In spite of this Peter's manager says they will look to secure other big fights in the division against anyone other than the Klitschko brothers. ===Peter vs. Helenius=== After his release from Top Rank, Peter and his management sent an offer to Tomasz Adamek for an IBF elimination match. The fight fell through when Peter refused Adamek's challenger money of $150,000. Peter then went into negotiations for a fight with Tye Fields which also failed to materialise. Then, in March 2011, it was revealed that Peter would travel to Germany to face undefeated Finnish prospect Robert Helenius. Peter was rumoured to be in training with Jeff Mayweather, however, Mayweather was not present for Peter's fight against Helenius. Peter weighed in for the contest at , 18.5 lbs heavier than in the Klitschko fight. Peter was without a reputed trainer or even a cutman for the fight. Peter had reasonable success in the first half of the bout, winning several of the first six rounds; however, after that point Peter began to tire. The end came when Helenius knocked down an exhausted Peter in round nine, Peter got to his feet only to be sent back to the canvas where he remained for well over the 10 second count, awarding Helenius the win by KO. The nature of the loss to Helenius, as well as Peter's terrible physical condition led many to call for Peter's retirement from boxing. === 2014 return === Peter made an unexpected return to the ring on 27 September 2014 to face journeyman Ron Aubrey. Peter came into the ring at an all-time career heavy of , and was struggling to walk before the bout began. Peter ended the fight when a vicious right hook knocked Aubrey unconscious in the first round. Given Peter's current physical condition is such that his health is at risk by engaging in any vigorous physical activity, there is likely to be serious difficulty in him being granted a boxing licence from any major state in the US should he wish to continue his career. ===Fight cancellations=== During his four-year period of near total inactivity, Peter has been signed to fight several opponents with all the bouts being cancelled. He was scheduled to compete in the Super 8 boxing tournament, but pulled out injured. He was then scheduled to face former title challenger Alex Leapai but once again he pulled out as the fight neared. Most recently he signed to fight Alexander Ustinov but again cancelled the fight with only days to go. More recently Peter was close to agreeing to fight Luis Ortiz before eventually being replaced. It is as of yet unclear whether he will make any substantive ring return. === Career from 2016\u2013present === At the age of 36, after a two-year layoff, Peter returned to the ring on 23 October fighting in Mexico, defeating unknown boxer Juan Carlos Salas (6\u20139) in three rounds. Peter weighed 262-pounds. It was still unclear if Peter would be returning to boxing full-time. On 1 November, there were early talks that Peter would be fighting former world title challenger Kubrat Pulev in December in Sofia, Bulgaria. Pulev, ranked at number 2 with the IBF, recently defeated Dereck Chisora via decision in May. A fight was confirmed five days later by Team Sauerland, officially announcing the fight between Peter and Pulev on 3 December in Bulgaria. This would be a stay busy fight for Pulev before his anticipated European title defense against Polish boxer Mariusz Wach. Pulev vacated his European title on 22 November. In front of 15,000 at the Arena Armeec, Pulev defeated Peter via fourth round corner retirement (RTD) to win the vacant WBA Inter-Continental heavyweight title. Peter was aggressive throughout but struggled with Pulev's jab. The fight was stopped after round three when Peter dislocated his right shoulder while throwing a big punch. He went back to the corner leaning towards the right side and the injury forced him to retire. Peter returned to Mexico once again on 22 February 2019 having not fought in two years. He appeared at the Cheers Bar & Grill in Tijuana knocking out Gerardo Escobar in just 44 seconds of the fight starting. On 26 March Peter signed a promotional contract with Salita Promotions and was announced to fight Mexican journeyman Mario Heredia (15\u20136\u20131, 13 KOs) on 13 April at the Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City on the undercard of Claressa Shields vs. Christina Hammer. Prior to the fight, Heredia was 2\u20135\u20131 in his previous eight bouts. Peter lost an eight- round split decision to Heredia, which took place at the Adrian Phillips Theater. Peter scored a knockdown in round-three yet was unable to finish Heredia, who fought on and prevailed by scores of 77\u201374 and 76\u201375, with the third judge giving Peter the nod via a 79\u201372 margin. ==Outside the ring== Peter is a devout Christian who neither drinks nor smokes. He lives in Las Vegas, Nevada. He is managed by Ivailo Gotsev and is a stablemate to former WBO heavyweight champion Sergei Liakhovich. Peter was formerly promoted by both Duva Boxing and Don King. Originally trained by Andy \"Pops\" Anderson, he has since gone on to work with former champion Cornelius Boza-Edwards. He also worked with technical specialist and strategist Manny Masson who assisted in the training for his two decisive victories against James Toney and Jameel McCline. Peter is currently trained by Ibn Cason. Following his split with Duva boxing, he had a court case against Don King over a dispute in the purse bid for his title loss to Vitali Klitschko. He challenged American Champion Chris Arreola to a bout in 2009. Claiming that Arreola had stolen his \"nightmare\" nickname. Peter said that if the fight went through then the loser would have to change his moniker. Peter is the nephew of Nigerian professional wrestler Great Power Uti. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent
