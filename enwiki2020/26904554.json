He ran to the upturned vehicle and, smelling strong fumes, saw a man twisted and trapped inside the cabin. After advising bystanders to move away, Senior Constable Anderton crawled inside the cabin and elevated the man's head, despite leaking fuel falling onto his head and gas discharging from a cylinder into the vehicle. Although he was feeling dizzy and nauseous from the fumes, Senior Constable Anderton remained with the man for almost 40 minutes until he was cut free from the vehicle by emergency services. By his actions, Senior Constable Luke Alan Anderton displayed conspicuous courage.Anderton, Luke Alan, itsanhonour.gov.au, www.gg.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 38 | Attempted rescue of surfer swept against rocks in rough seas.BADGER, Stephen William, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 63 | On the afternoon of 6 July 1991 Scott Bailey, then aged 17, swam through dangerous seas at Cape Freycinet, Western Australia to assist a drowning fisherman. Scott, who was visiting Cape Freycinet with his father and brother, was one of several people in the vicinity when a fisherman fell eight metres from rocks into a heavy sea. Despite cold conditions, a strong current and large swell, Scott stripped, dived 10 metres into the sea, and swam for 15 minutes carrying a sealed bucket and hauling a rescue line. On reaching the unconscious fisherman, Scott spent some time attempting, unsuccessfully, to revive him and then commenced bringing him back to shore. During the return journey the rescue line parted and Scott twice had the fisherman pulled from his grip by rough waves. Scott's condition was reduced by these events and he was forced to abandon his attempt to bring the fisherman to the shore. Scott needed to be assisted from the water by family members and others participating in the rescue attempt from the shore.BAILEY, Scott Daniel, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 31 | Attempted rescue of school boy at Rocky Point, Eagle Bay, Western AustraliaBennett, Kevin Allan, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 87 | C of Aust Gazette No. S81. 12 March 1997Bichler, Garry Michael, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 85 |Boughton, Ian Maurice, itsanhonour.gov.au On 20 April 1995 Senior Constable Boughton put himself at danger to rescue a diver trapped inside an underwater inlet cooling pipe at the BHP Pumphouse at Port Waratah, Newcastle, New South Wales. The diver was making a routine inspection on the inlet pipe prior to fitting a filter when he was drawn in feet first. The above-water crew, seeing irregularities on the air hose equipment pulled on the security line which broke free from the diver, dislodging his face mask and allowed him to be sucked further into the pipe at great speed. Constable Boughton responded to a call for assistance and although he had no previous underwater diving experience entered the water in a rescue attempt, after first ensuring that the pumps had been switched off. He descended 5 metres below the surface of the water before he located the pipe, which was 1 metre in diameter but had been reduced considerably by the build up of crustacean growth and algae. Carrying a torch Constable Boughton entered the pipe and travelled 3 metres vertically to a bend where visibility was reduced to only centimetres. After moving around the bend and a few metres along the horizontal arm of the pipe he located the diver's hand. He tugged at the unconscious diver a number of times before he was able to pull him free and drag him back through the pipe to the open water where he was lifted from the water. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 82 | Rescue of children from burning cabin at Caravan Park, SuttoBoukouvalas, Constantinos , itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 17 | Assisted in rescue of passengers from crashed helicopterBOWEN, Wayne Thomas, 26 November 1982, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 6 | At about 1 a.m. on 6 September 1978, Mr Bowman, a Municipal Council employee, was driving along Canley Vale Road, Canley Vale, New South Wales, when he saw a house ablaze. Upon enquiring from bystanders he ascertained that two persons were trapped inside the fiercely burning building. Mr Bowman broke away some of the fibro wall sheeting, entered the house but was forced back by the smoke and heat. Although the portion of the building was well alight where the occupants were trapped, he entered the house again and reached the two persons \u2013 who were severely burned \u2013 and brought them one at a time to safety outside the building. By his conspicuous courage in which he placed himself in great peril Mr Bowman saved the lives of the two persons.BOWMAN, Robert James, 30 March 1979, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 89 | Gaz S179 1997BOYLE, Dominic, 9 April 1997, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 80 | Rescue from shark at Julian Rocks, Byron Bay, New South WalesBRACKENRIG, Jeffery David, 12 October 1994, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 26 | Rescued man from burning vehicle after accidentBRADSHAW, Paul, 31 January 1986, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 83 || Rescue of man being stabbed by intoxicated man at Kings Cross, New South WalesBRASSEY, Spencer John, 5 April 1995, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 120 |BREEN, David Ashley, 21 February 2005, itsanhonour.gov.au On the afternoon of 21 November 2003, Mr Breen rescued a man from a burning vehicle after an accident at Mount Inkerman, Queensland. Mr Breen was driving north along the Bruce Highway when he noticed an approaching car drift onto the other side of the road, narrowly missing his own vehicle. The car careered across a concrete culvert toward a raised train carriageway before landing upside down on the tracks. Mr Breen saw the accident in his rear vision mirror and called 000 emergency. He then heard the female driver, who had escaped, scream that her husband was trapped in the overturned vehicle. Mr Breen rushed, bare foot, to help. As he approached the car, he noticed smoke coming from the engine bay and that the grass surrounding the car was alight. Mr Breen tried all the doors of the car but they were jammed shut. To free the man he climbed through the front passenger window and dragged him from the burning vehicle. Another person who had arrived on the scene helped Mr Breen move the man to safety. Within 30 seconds the car exploded. In quick succession it then exploded a second time. David lost his hat in the fire, which he also attempted to save. This was later retrieved by the couple, framed with the newspaper clipping of the accident and presented to David. By his actions, Mr Breen displayed conspicuous courage. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 126 ||BROWN, Michael Thomas, 27 February 2006, itsanhonour.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 144 |BURNS, Trevor Ronald, 25 March 2013, itsanhonour.gov.au On 30 October 2010, Mr Burns rescued a woman from a shark attack north east of Garden Island, near Rockingham, Western Australia. The woman was a female dive guide with a group of about twelve tourists swimming with dolphins as part of a Rockingham Wild Encounters tour. As the woman was engaging dolphins to interact with the tourists she was suddenly and violently attacked by a three-metre shark. Mr Burns, who was snorkeling with other members of the tour group, saw the violent attack, and immediately grabbed the shark's tail in an attempt to pull it off her. As he held on, the shark began to thrash about, aggressively throwing Mr Burn around in the water. Soon after, the shark released its grip on the woman, and swam off. After hearing a warning alarm coming from the boat, all of the swimmers swam to the boat except for Mr Burns. Despite a large amount of blood in the water, and the whereabouts of the shark unknown, he dove down about four metres to the injured woman who was sinking below him. Mr Burns pulled her to the surface and swam a short distance to the boat where he lifted her onto the back landing amongst others who were trying to get out of the water. Mr Burns ensured everyone was safe before he left the water. The woman survived the attack but received significant injuries to her legs which required over 200 stitches and several operations. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 42 || 9 August 1989 for assisting with the disarming of an armed man who had wounded and killed workers in an Australia Post building in Melbourne during the Queen Street massacre. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 14 || (Posthumous award). 6 May 1981.

In the midst of the Black Saturday bushfires, Ms Casey, a member of the Country Fire Authority (CFA), assisted her friend to defend her house in Bald Spur Road, Kinglake from the firestorm. With safety considerations paramount, her friend asked Ms Casey to leave as the fire front approached. Ms Casey managed to return to the Kinglake CFA shed and remained until the fire front had past. As darkness approached, Ms Casey became aware that her friend's situation had become dire, so decided to drive back to assist. She drove through the fire-stricken forest until she was unable to travel further due to the fallen and burning trees which had blocked Bald Spur Road. Using a torch, Ms Casey left the safety of her vehicle and walked about 600 metres along the road until she found her friend, badly injured and almost unconscious. In very difficult conditions, Ms Casey assisted her friend back to the vehicle and again negotiated fallen trees to return to the main road and back to the CFA shed. With no ambulances available, local police officers were able to transport the woman to Whittlesea, Victoria to receive urgently needed medical attention. By her actions, Ms Casey displayed conspicuous courage. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 102 || Police Marine and Rescue Services, Tasmania Police |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 101 || SC.

Whilst visiting and working in the US, a young Australian woman joined a group of people to make a tandem skydive. Her instructor was Mr Robert Cook with whom she would be harnessed for the skydive. Soon after take-off from an airport near St Louis, Missouri, the plane experienced serious engine malfunctions and the pilot attempted to return to the airstrip. Mr Cook, an experienced instructor, turned to the woman and calmly told her that the plane was likely to crash. Instructing her to focus solely on his instructions, Mr Cook clipped his skydive harness to hers, demanding that the woman wrap herself around him so that he could cushion her fall. As the aircraft lost altitude and crashed through a tree, the woman remembers being jostled around and slipping to the floor of the plane. Mr Cook pulled her back onto the seat and again pressed her against him. Moments later the plane hit an electrical wire and, as it plunged towards the ground, Mr Cook tightened his grip around the woman, acting as a human shield to protect her. Having entirely understood the implications of his actions, and as a result of his selfless courage, the woman, although seriously injured in the crash, survived the impact. Sadly Mr Cook died instantly as a result of his injuries. By his actions, Mr Cook displayed conspicuous bravery, thereby losing his life.Robert Cook, Bravery Council Honours List, 17 March 2008, www.gg.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 30 || Attempted to rescue man in rough seas |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 35 || 16 March 1988.

On the afternoon of 5 January 2011, Nurse, Mr Robert Fenwick and a female colleague were attending to a patient at a hospital in Orange. For reasons of privacy, the female nurse left the bedroom, when another patient entered through the door armed with a steak knife in each hand. He lunged at the female nurse causing a severe laceration to her right hand, nearly severing her little finger. The nurse yelled for help. Mr Fenwick immediately left the room and placed himself between the offender and his colleague, when he was stabbed in the chest, receiving multiple lacerations to his body. Despite his injuries, Mr Fenwick, and his patient, who came to assist, forced the offender outside. Mr Fenwick grabbed a broom and defended himself with it. The offender backed off and security staff apprehended him. Sadly, after being transported to Westmead Hospital, Mr Fenwick died the next morning. His colleague received surgery to reattach her little finger.

On the night in question, Mr Hyland was standing on the front landing of his house when he heard frantic screams from across the road. He saw two women run to a next door neighbour's house, thump desperately on the screen door and call out for the police to be called. Moments later the women were confronted by a young man. In a rage the man raised a sword and struck out at the women, severely injuring both of them. Mr Hyland raced to confront the attacker, picking up a second weapon dropped earlier by the offender. Mr Hyland repeatedly demanded the man back away, which resulted in the offender moving away a short distance from the victims. As he did so, Mr Hyland jumped in and stood between the offender and the women, mirroring the offender's movements as he tried again to get at his victims. As the women attempted to escape, the offender pursued them, quickly followed by Mr Hyland who challenged the offender again. One of the women ran up behind Mr Hyland for protection and as he shielded her she desperately screamed for help. Mr Hyland resolutely maintained his position in the standoff, calling out to others in the street to contact the police. The sound of police in the distance spooked the offender and he quickly fled the scene. Mr Hyland checked the condition of the two victims, reassuring them until police and ambulance arrived at the scene. The offender was later apprehended by police. By his actions, Mr Hyland displayed conspicuous courage.Stephen William HYLAND, Australian Bravery Decorations Honours List, 2 March 2009, www.gg.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 7 || Through his initiative Mr James placed himself in great peril and by his conspicuous courage rescued three persons caught in a rip in heavy surf, which was sweeping them towards a rocky headland. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 139 | On the night of 9 June 2006, Mr Janakievski attempted to detain an armed robber escaping from a holdup at a hotel at St Peters, New South Wales. Around midnight, four men armed with a shot gun and large knives entered a hotel at St Peters. They spread out in the public bar area, and began to menace patrons and staff. They screamed aggressively as they rounded up their victims, ordering them into an adjacent room and on to the floor. The duty hotel manager, Mr Janakievski, was attacked from behind and forced to open a safe, and then threatened by another offender armed with the shot gun as cash was also removed from one of the registers. The offenders continued to intimidate and yell obscenities at the patrons as they were ordered to hand over wallets and mobile phones. Mr Janakievski was made to move into the room with the victims where he was again threatened by the offender armed with the shot gun. The weapon was raised to shoulder level, and aimed at him at point blank range. Fearing for the safety of his customers, Mr Janakievski lunged at the offender and was able to wrestle the gun from him, prompting the robbers to flee from the hotel. Reacting instinctively, Mr Janakievski pursued them out into the street and tried to detain one of the offenders. As the robbers escaped by car, Mr Janakievski learnt that one of his customers had sustained a critical knife wound. Running to his aid, Mr Janakievski dropped to the ground and applied pressure to the man's chest wound then commenced Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation. Sadly, the victim's injury was fatal. By his actions, Mr Janakievski displayed conspicuous bravery. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 52 || For alerting residents of burning hotel at Longreach, Queensland.The citations for Hurley, Jeppesen, Kozakiewicz, Lumb, Meagher, no longer appears on the ABA page. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 21 || For rescuing an unconscious man from the path of oncoming train at Boronia railway station, Victoria. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 12 || Prevented payroll robbery at the Randwick Bus Depot, New South Wales |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 2 || On 25 December 1975, Mr Kerr attempted to rescue an employee who had fallen down a well while carrying out repairs to a petrol driven pump in the well.

The tractor struck a mine, overturning it and severely injured the driver. Chief Inspector Thurgar immediately crossed through the mine field to the injured person. He then picked up the injured person and returned through the mine field so that medical care could be obtained; in doing so he saved the person's life. Chief Inspector Thurgar displayed conspicuous courage and placed himself in great peril in traversing the mine field to rescue the injured person. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 40 || Disarmed offender holding hostages |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 136 || In the early hours of 12 January 2008, Mr Tucker rescued two children from a burning house at Cranbourne, Victoria. Mr Tucker heard the sound of a nearby smoke alarm and on investigating saw a neighbouring house on fire. He ran to the building to see a mother and father screaming that two of their children were still inside. Mr Tucker raced into the house where sections of the roof had already collapsed and with dense choking smoke restricted his visibility, he was forced to retreat. Mr Tucker grabbed a torch and re-entered the house only to find the light was of no use in the thick blanket of smoke. Covering his face and mouth with a dressing gown, Mr Tucker entered the building for a third time. He struggled through the house but found that access to the children's bedroom was blocked by huge flames. He then raced outside to the back of the building and climbed through a window. He was feeling overcome by the heat and his breathing was dangerously impaired by the black toxic smoke. As Mr Tucker felt his way around inside he stumbled over the two children huddled together under a doona. The smoke was so thick and disorienting that Mr Tucker could no longer see where he had entered the room. As the fire began to consume the house Mr Tucker persisted with his efforts and instinctively found his way back to the opening. One by one he passed the children to the arms of waiting neighbours. Exhausted and overcome by smoke, Mr Tucker fell through the window and slowly crawled away from the burning house. He was helped over a fence where ambulance administered first aid. By his actions, Mr Tucker displayed conspicuous courage.Michael Anthony TUCKER, Australian Bravery Decorations Honours List, 2 March 2009, www.gg.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 70 || New South Wales Police Service.

During its deployment to assist earthquake victims in Indonesia, a Royal Australian Navy Sea King helicopter crashed near the village of Tuindrao on Nias Island, Indonesia. Leading Seaman Warburton was aboard the helicopter and sustained severe injuries. He was trapped in the rear of the cabin which was on fire and quickly filling with thick black smoke. The cockpit had caved in and the two pilots were deceased. Leading Seaman Warburton tried to rouse other passengers, and found one other person alive. He inched his way through the debris and found a service colleague with horrible leg fractures and other injuries. Although almost overcome by exhaustion and restricted by choking black smoke, he summoned his strength and determination and dragged the victim as far as he could to a small opening in the tail of the helicopter, where he shouted for help. As Leading Seaman Warburton was pulled from the wreckage by local villagers he pleaded with them to rescue his mate from the aircraft. After the second rescue attempt succeeded, Leading Seaman Warburton attempted to return to the crash site to search for other victims but was restrained by the villagers when a series of explosions accelerated the fire. Sadly, the remaining personnel on the helicopter died in the crash. By his actions, Leading Seaman Warburton displayed conspicuous bravery.Shane Robert Warburton, Bravery Council Honours List, 17 March 2008, www.gg.gov.au |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 3 || On 27 March 1977, a young man was washed from rocks at Twilight Beach near Esperance, Western Australia. The sea was very rough and was forming breakers approximately twenty feet high that were breaking against a vertical rock face resulting in strong undercurrents. Mervyn Williams entered the water on a surfboard and made his way out to the man, a distance of about 50 metres, taking a line with him. He supported the man until a lifebuoy could be launched along the line and he then assisted the man into the lifebuoy. Both men were now weak. After a further 30 minutes in the surf both men were exhausted and Mr Williams urged the people on shore to drag them up onto the rock face. This attempt failed as the line broke when they were approximately 3 metres from the rock face. They were then thrown repeatedly against the rocks and dragged out to sea again. Eventually, they were picked up by a wave and dumped in a crevice under the overhanging rocks from where they hauled to safety. Although he was weakened by the extremely cold waters and risked being either swept out to sea or dashed against the rocks, Mr Williams kept hold of the man and assisted him until they both were rescued. The rescue would not have been possible but for the conspicuous courage displayed by Mr Williams in putting his own life in peril. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 121 | On the afternoon of 3 August 2003, Mr Wust rescued a man and a woman from a burning vehicle after an accident on the Leichhardt Highway near Biloela, Queensland. Mr Wust was travelling south with his wife on the Leichhardt Highway towards Biloela when he saw a station wagon on its roof with large amounts of smoke coming from the engine. Mr Wust stopped his car and asked his wife to turn on the hazard warning lights and to ring 000 emergency. He then ran to the overturned vehicle and saw a man and woman trapped inside in their seats. Both were unconscious. The driver's door was jammed and the car had burst into flames. Mr Wust realised the man and woman would burn to death if he did not act quickly. After considerable effort, he forced open the back door on the driver's side, freed the female driver from her seat belt and dragged her out of the car. The flames were now spreading, with the engine compartment well alight. Mr Wust could feel the heat from the front of the car. Although someone yelled at him not to go back into the vehicle because it was about to explode, Mr Wust returned to help the trapped male passenger. He climbed over the heavy set man and managed to free his broken foot and drag him through the back door of the car. Other people helped Mr Wust to move the man and the woman away from the car before it exploded. By his actions, Mr Wust displayed conspicuous courage. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 34 || Rescued persons from burning building |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 141 | On the morning of 9 May 2006, Mr Zerafa assisted a wounded police officer and confronted an armed offender at Mangalore, Tasmania. Mr Zerafa was travelling along the Midland Highway at Mangalore, Tasmania, with a friend when he came upon a police vehicle and another vehicle stopped by the side of the road. Two other drivers had stopped by the vehicle and were attempting to assist a police officer, who had been shot and was lying on the ground. One of the men notified police on the police radio of the situation, and informed Mr Zerafa and his friend that a man was armed with a gun. As the two men moved away, Mr Zerafa approached the wounded officer and checked for a response. Despite the considerable risk to his own safety, he then yelled to the armed offender and tried to negotiate with him, but the man responded by pointing a gun directly at him. Mr Zerafa moved away as the offender knelt down beside the wounded police officer. The offender then went to back to his vehicle and appeared to be reloading his weapon, which allowed Mr Zerafa the opportunity to return to the police officer. While continually trying to negotiate with the gunman Mr Zerafa inched closer to him, however the offender responded by pointing the gun at him again. Mr Zerafa continued negotiating until the police arrived and arrested the man By his actions, Mr Zerafa displayed conspicuous courage. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 145 |On the morning of 5 August 2010, Mr Andrew MacDonald rescued a colleague from an armed offender at Bonnyrigg, New South Wales. Mr MacDonald was working as a department manager at a major retail store in Bonnyrigg when three men entered the store and requested to speak to the store loss prevention officer. As he was speaking with them the undercover loss prevention officer approached and identified himself. The men requested he go outside with them, before an argument ensued and they began to assault him. As the men wrestled, a handgun was produced and aimed at the victim's stomach. Mr MacDonald called for help, as he pushed one of the offenders away and managed to keep the two other men on the ground which allowed the victim to run away and hide elsewhere inside the store. After the offenders got up, Mr MacDonald warned other staff and customers to stay back as he followed the men and ordered them outside despite them threatening to shoot him. When the offenders departed through the back exit and headed to their trucks Mr MacDonald prevented staff and customers from leaving the store for their own safety before one of the men fired two shots towards where he and others were standing. By his actions, Mr MacDonald displayed conspicuous courage.http://www.gg.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/honours/bd/bd80/Media%20Notes%20-%20Star%20of%20Courage.pdf |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 148 |Between 6 and 10 July 2018, Dr Craig Challen and Dr Richard Harris were involved in the rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in the Tham Luang cave system in Northern Thailand. On 23 June 2018, 12 young boys and their soccer coach became trapped in the 9.6 km long Tham Luang cave system in Northern Thailand. On 25 June, Thai Navy Seal divers entered the complex and began the search for the boys and their coach but were forced back by rising water. On 27 June, the Prime Minister of Thailand sought international assistance and an Australian Federal Police Specialist Response Group arrived on the scene to search for the missing group. They were later joined by an Australian Defence Force Clearance Diver. On 2 July, two members of a British expedition located the boys and their coach. Dr Harris, an anaesthetist and member of the Australian Medical Assistance Team, and his dive partner, Dr Craig Challen arrived at the scene on 6 July, and the next day they entered the cave system and reached the boys and their coach. Dr Harris conducted initial medical assessments and was able to provide information to the awaiting authorities regarding the safest extraction methods. The rescue mission was hazardous, with poor or zero visibility, debris and constrictive passageways, variable air quality, and made more difficult with further rainfalls predicted. The order of evacuation was decided, and on 8 July Dr Harris again entered the cave system, reached the boys and provided medical support for the extraction of the first four boys. Dr Challen assisted to de-kit the boys of their diving equipment in one section of the evacuation route. The boys were then transferred from harnesses to stretchers and carried to the next section where they were re-kitted and prepared for the next dive. This procedure was repeated until the boys reached Chamber Three, where they were assessed before being taken to a nearby field hospital. During the extractions, Dr Challen stayed inside the cave system and Dr Harris remained in Chamber Nine with the coach and boys. The extraction process was repeated on 9 July with Dr Harris and Dr Challen performing the same duties, resulting in four more boys being safely extracted from the cave. On 10 July, the final four boys and their coach were extracted using the same method. By his actions, Dr Richard Harris displayed conspicuous courage. |- | ||align=right| ||align=right| 149 |Between 6 and 10 July 2018, Dr Craig Challen and Dr Richard Harris were involved in the rescue of 12 young boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave in the Tham Luang cave system in Northern Thailand.

Mr O\u2019Toole and his wife were working at the back of their jewellery store, when they heard the door to the store open. Mrs O\u2019Toole moved into the main area where she was met by a man in disguise walking towards the counter. The offender yelled at her and she noticed that he was holding something in his right hand which turned out to be a large, 20 cm carving knife. A struggle ensued between the woman and the offender before he pushed her onto a large counter in the middle of the store. Mr O'Toole immediately rushed from the back of the shop in order to render assistance to his wife who was screaming. The offender then pushed the woman into the store's glass display cabinets. Mr O'Toole confronted the armed offender and wrestled with him before slipping over and landing on his back. He attempted to fend of the offender who then stabbed him with the knife. The offender further assaulted the woman before stealing a range of rings and leaving the store. Sadly, Mr O'Toole died as a result of his injuries. By his actions, Mr O'Toole displayed conspicuous courage. |} ==References== ==Further reading== ;Australian Bravery Association The Star of Courage citations describe the deeds of: {| |- valign=top | *Scott Bailey *Michael Brown *Lorraine Casey *Corporal Shaun Clements *Alan Dwyer | *Rodney Fiechtner *Kevin Fletcher *Ronald Gianoncelli *Natalie Goold *Mitchell Hancock | *Ken Janakievski *Robert Meredith *Sean Murphy *Lauren Munro *Oguz Taskun | *John Thurgar *Charles Zerafa |} ;Bravery Council Honours Lists Hosted by the Governor General's website {| |Meeting 68: ||align=right| 17 March 2008 ||Robert Cook, Kerri-Anne O\u2019Meley, Shane Warburton |- |Meeting 70: ||align=right| 2 March 2009 ||Stephen Hyland, Michael Tucker |- |Meeting 71: ||align=right| 17 August 2009 ||Joanne Lucas |- |Meeting 72: ||align=right| 15 March 2010 ||Ronald Gianoncelli |- |Meeting 73: ||align=right| 16 August 2010 ||Ken Janakievski |- |Meeting 75: ||align=right| 22 August 2011 ||Lorraine Casey, Charles Zerafa |- |Meeting 76: ||align=right| 10 March 2012 ||Robert Fenwick |- |Meeting 77: ||align=right| 27 August 2012 ||Luke Anderton, Clayton Giddings |- |Meeting 78: ||align=right| 25 March 2013 ||Trevor Burns |- |Meeting 80: ||align=right| 24 March 2014 ||Andrew MacDonald |} Star of Courage ",
