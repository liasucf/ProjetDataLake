    "text": "Tom York (born November 30, 1924) is an American television personality, who worked for WBRC in Birmingham, Alabama from 1957 to 1989. == Early life and education == York was born in Holland, Missouri. He served in the United States Navy as an aviation radioman and gunner during World War II. He graduated from Florence State Teachers College (now the University of North Alabama), then worked as a radio host in North Alabama before moving to Birmingham. == Career == While he served in several capacities with the station, he is best remembered for The Tom York Morning Show, which was the station's primary morning show for 32 years. During the early 1960s, Fannie Flagg served as his co-host. The show was so popular that when WBRC's parent network, ABC, premiered its own morning show, Good Morning America, WBRC refused to carry it since it would have required moving York's show to another timeslot or canceling it altogether. WBRC began airing the second hour of GMA in the early-1980s, and only began airing the entire show in 1989 after York retired. Since retiring from broadcast television, York has worked as a weekly columnist for his hometown newspaper, The Hoover Gazette, from 2006 until shortly before the newspaper's demise in 2007. York won a regional Emmy Award in 1995. York was the master of ceremonies for the induction ceremonies for the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame for more than a quarter century, and was himself inducted into ASHOF in 1996. He wrote a book about the ASHOF in 2001. He is the father of American author and conservative columnist Byron York. ==References== Category:Television anchors from Birmingham, Alabama Category:American columnists Category:1924 births Category:Living people Category:People from Pemiscot County, Missouri Category:Military personnel from Missouri Category:University of North Alabama alumni Category:Journalists from Alabama ",
