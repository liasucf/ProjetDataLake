    "text": "In politics, a red\u2013green alliance or red\u2013green coalition is an alliance of \"red\" (often social-democratic or democratic socialist) parties with \"green\" (often green and/or occasionally agrarian) parties. The alliance is often based on common left political views, especially a shared distrust of corporate or capitalist institutions. While the \"red\" social-democratic parties tend to focus on the effects of capitalism on the working class, the \"green\" environmentalist parties tend to focus on the environmental effects of capitalism. The term was coined by conservative Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt in a debate against the Social Democrat opposition leader Ingvar Carlsson 1994. == Red\u2013green coalition governments == There have been a number of red\u2013green governments in Europe since the 1990s. * In Germany, a red\u2013green coalition of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) and Alliance '90/The Greens led by Chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der formed the federal government from September 1998 to September 2005. * In France, the 'Plural Left' coalition of the Socialist Party (PS), The Greens, French Communist Party and allies governed from 1997 until 2002. The Ayrault government which governed from May 2012 until March 2014 had ministers affiliated with the PS, Radical Party of the Left (PRG) and Europe Ecology \u2013 The Greens. The second Valls government (August 2014 to December 2016) and Cazeneuve Government (December 2016 to May 2017) were both formed of ministers from the PS, PRG and Ecologist Party. * In Finland, Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen's first and second cabinets contained ministers from the Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP), including Lipponen himself, and the Green League. The Green League participated in government from April 1995 until May 2002. The Rinne Cabinet formed in June 2019 is formed by the SDP as largest party, in coalition with the Green League, agrarian Centre Party and Swedish People's Party. * In Norway, the Red-Green Coalition of the Labour Party, Socialist Left Party and Centre Party governed Norway as a majority government from the 2005 general election until 2013. The 'green' element was the Centre Party, an agrarian party with green as its official color. * In Iceland, the First and Second Cabinets of Prime Minister J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir were formed from a coalition of the Social Democratic Alliance and Left-Green Movement, governing from February 2009 to May 2013. * In Italy, from 1996-2001 and 2006-2008, the Prodi I, D'Alema I, D'Alema II, Amato II and Prodi II Cabinets included the social-democratic Democrats of the Left (later to become the Democratic Party) as the largest party, with the Federation of the Greens receiving at least one ministry. However, unlike a straightforward red\u2013green alliance, these centre-left cabinets involved a broad range of political parties that were Catholic- inspired Christian left, social-liberal and even communist backgrounds. * In Denmark, the Thorning-Schmidt government, which governed from October 2011 to February 2014, contained the Social Democrats as the largest party in coalition with the Social Liberals and Socialist People's Party, the latter being a green party and member of the European Green Party and Global Greens. * In Sweden, the L\u00f6fven I Cabinet established on 3 October 2014 was a minority government coalition of the Social Democrats and Greens. This coalition was renewed on 21 January 2019 as the L\u00f6fven II Cabinet. * In Portugal, the Ant\u00f3nio Costa Cabinet established on 26 November 2015 is a Socialist Party minority government with external support of the Left Bloc, Portuguese Communist Party and Ecologist Party The Greens. ==Red\u2013red\u2013green coalition== A red\u2013red\u2013green coalition or red\u2013green\u2013red coalition is a left-wing alliance of two \"red\" social democratic, democratic socialist or socialist parties with one \"green\" environmentalist party. Examples include: *Germany: \"red-red- green\" is a frequently used term in reference to cooperation between the social-democratic Social Democratic Party of Germany, democratic-socialist The Left (Die Linke), and The Greens. Though cooperation between the SPD and Greens is common, many SPD politicians are averse to cooperation with The Left. The first red-red-green coalition government was formed after the 2014 Thuringian state election, under the leadership of The Left. *Sweden: The Red- Greens () was a political alliance in Sweden, established on 7 December 2008. It consisted of the Social Democrats, Left Party and Greens in the Riksdag, sitting in opposition to the centre-right Alliance for Sweden coalition government. The Red-Greens aimed to achieve a majority at the 2010 Swedish general election held on 19 September 2010 and form its own coalition government. However, the Red-Greens failed to unseat the incumbent centre- right Alliance government, and the pact was dissolved on 26 October 2010.http://www.thelocal.se/29832/20101026/ After that, the Social Democrats and Greens remain co-operations and formed a minority government coalition after the 2014 general election, with the Left Party providing confidence and supply. == Radical red\u2013green alliances == Political parties or joint electoral lists have been formed over the years, most often between socialists and left- oriented greens. Example include: * GreenLeft of the Netherlands: a political party that began in 1989 as a political alliance comprising the Communist Party of the Netherlands, Pacifist Socialist Party and the Christian left parties Evangelical People's Party and Political Party of Radicals.

The SYRIZA-led cabinet of Alexis Tsipras contains ones junior minister, Giannis Tsironis, from the Ecologist Greens. == Red\u2013green alliances with centre-left parties == There are also red/green political alliances and/or electoral agreements between social-democratic or liberal parties cooperate with green parties *In Canada, the term red\u2013green alliance has been used to describe the limited co-operation between the Liberal Party of Canada which uses red as its colour, and the Green Party of Canada,TheStar.com | News | Could the 'red-green coalition' be revived? which is centre-left but not seen as being as radical as many of its overseas sister parties. * A red\u2013green alliance of sorts occurred during the campaign leading up to the 2008 London mayoral election. Incumbent mayor Ken Livingstone, candidate for the Labour Party, formed an electoral pact with the Green Party mayoral candidate Si\u00e2n Berry via the supplementary voting system, in which Labour voters were encouraged to place the Green candidate as their second preference, and vice versa. * In Italy, The Olive Tree and The Union coalitions comprised the Federation of the Greens along with social- democratic, social Christian, centrist and other parties in a broad heterogenous centre-left alliance. The successor party to the Olive Tree, the Democratic Party, maintains an internal faction of greens called the Democratic Ecologists. * In Australia, the term red\u2013green alliance has been used to describe the co-operation between the centre-left Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens. The Greens supported Labor to form the minority government in 2010. As the Greens is the third party in the Australian Senate which hold the balance power from crossbench, the Labor minority government needed to rely support from the Greens from 2010 to 2013. * In New Zealand, after the 2017 general election, the Labour and the Greens signed a memorandum of understanding. This formed a loose relationship between the two parties with the goal of working together when possible to unseat the incumbent National Government. Later, the two parties also agreed to a set of budget responsibility rules, committing both parties to sustainable surpluses and capping debt, amongst other rules. Following the election, a Labour-led coalition government was formed, supported by the Greens through a confidence and supply arrangement. == See also == * Red\u2013green\u2013brown alliance * Red\u2013red\u2013green coalition * Traffic light coalition * Jamaica coalition (politics) * Green Left (disambiguation) * Green socialist (disambiguation) * Eco-socialism * Social Movement Unionism * Democratic socialism ==References== Category:Alliance 90/The Greens * Category:Democratic socialism Category:Eco- socialism Category:Green politics * Category:Social democracy Category:Social Democratic Party of Germany ",
