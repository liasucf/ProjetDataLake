The game was created using an authoring system called CyberCad, and used early 3D software Infini-D. By April 1994 it was due for release that fall. NY Daily News deemed it \"a nicely done CD rip-off of the old \"Incredible Journey\" movie\". Los Angeles Times felt it was \"reminiscent of some \u201860s sci-fi flicks\" and that its educational content came across as an afterthought detached from the gameplay. == References == == External links == * bloomberg.com/news/articles/1994-12-11/to-tickle-the-tykes * https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-11-25-9411250037-story.html Category:1995 video games Category:Educational video games Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Windows games Category:Windows- only games ",
