    "text": "Hung Out is a British situation comedy in the 2010 Channel 4 Comedy Lab strand about the etiquette of friendship and focuses on a group of close mates living in London. It is written and created by a real group of six friends who based the material on their real-life experiences. ==Main cast== *Emily Bevan as Anna *David L E Davis as Dave *Lucy McCall as Lucy *Alex McGettigan as Alex *James Shakeshaft as James *Catherine Shepherd as Maya ==Main characters== ===Dave=== Dave is intelligent and socially awkward - yeah, one of them. He is always arguing with flatmate James. ===James=== James is like a big baby. Friendly, but he'll turn if he's backed into a corner. That's babies, right? He owes money to flatmate Dave - which is never a good thing. ===Alex=== Alex is attractive and cocky, but not in a cocky way. More like someone who enjoys looking in the mirror but isn't exactly sure who they're looking at... ===Lucy=== Lucy would bluff her way through anything if she wasn't so bad at bluffing her way through everything. She thinks she's independent but needs everyone to tell her so... ===Maya=== Maya considers herself a free spirit. But we all know people who do that are usually so uptight they have their kaftan shawls arranged precisely according to the order of the colours in the rainbow. ==Synopsis== Dave and James, who live on one side of the street, decide to make a spreadsheet detailing everything they owe each other. Meanwhile, Lucy and Alex, who live opposite, fall out over what to do on Saturday night - a dinner party or going ice skating are the two choices. A new girl called Maya moves into Lucy and Alex's flat. She is soon questioning what she has walked into - the light in the bathroom never works, and Lucy keeps managing to inconvenience her life by being an assertive control freak. ==References== ==External links== * * Comedy Lab page at Channel4.com * Review from Den of Geek. * Channel K Website Category:Channel 4 sitcoms ",
