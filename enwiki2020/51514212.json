Bushranging, squatting, droving, gold mining, and countless other phases of colonial existence furnish themes for the facile pen of the author of Robbery Under Arms, and, indeed, no subject connected with Australian life seems to come amiss to him.\"\"Current Literature\", The Advertiser, 18 June 1901, p6 In The West Australian the reviewer noted: \"Boldrewood is eminently an entertaining causeur, and his short tales, interspersed with exquisite bits of nature, are his greatest charm. Even where he turns to more ambitious work he cannot abandon this method, and in the midst of a sentence he stops to make a most irrelevant explanation in brackets as to the scientific name of the native cat. On things Australian he is such an undoubted authority that it is no exaggeration to say that from his books, and from this book in particular, one may learn more about Australian life than from most of the so-called Australian novels put together.\"\"Reviews\", The West Australian, 13 July 1901, p12 ==See also== * Full text of the volume is available from the University of MichiganUniversity of Michigan - In Bad Company and Other Stories by Rolf Boldrewood * 1901 in Australian literature ==References== Category:Australian short story collections Category:1901 short story collections ",
