    "text": "Eva Kinney Griffith Miller (November 8, 1852 \u2013 1918) was an American journalist, temperance activist, novelist, newspaper editor, and journal publisher. Griffith was lecturer and organizer of the Wisconsin Woman's Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) for several years. Her illustrated lectures won her the name of \"Wisconsin Chalk Talker.\" She wrote temperance lessons and poems for the Temperance Banner and the Union Signal. She also published a temperance novel A Woman's Evangel (Chicago, 1892), having already put out a volume named Chalk Talk Handbook (1887), and True Ideal, a journal devoted to purity and faith studies. In 1891, Miller moved to Chicago where she became a special writer for the Daily News Record, and afterwards, an editor on the Chicago Times, and by this means, she made public her views on temperance. ==Early years and education== Eva Kinney was born in Whitewater, Wisconsin, November 8, 1852. She was a daughter of Francis Kinney and Sophronia Goodrich Kinney. She entered Whitewater State Normal School in 1868, graduating in the class of 1871. ==Career== After completing her education, Griffith taught one term in Elkhorn, Wisconsin and two terms in Cold Spring, Wisconsin before spending one year in Chicago, where she entered the field of journalism. She wrote for the Detroit Free Press, Pomeroy's Democrat, the Educational Weekly, the Cincinnati Saturday Night, and many other journals. Overwork broke her health in 1878, and in the following year, she went to Kansas to recuperate. She returned to teaching in 1879 and again in 1883, in Hays City, Kansas. She was not able to resume writing to any great extent until 1883. In May 1891, she married Charles E. Griffith, and they moved to St. Louis, Missouri. The marriage proved a mistake. They separated, and Griffith returned to Whitewater, entering the temperance movement in 1883. For seven years, she was a lecturer and organizer of the Wisconsin WCTU, her illustrated lectures winning her the nickname of \"Wisconsin Chalk Talker.\" She wrote temperance lessons and poems for the Temperance Banner, and was a regular contributor to the Union Signal, writing the semi-monthly \"Queen's Garden\" for that journal. She also wrote for the Woman's News. Griffith published a temperance novel, A Woman's Evangel (Chicago, 1892), and a volume entitled Chalk Talk Hand-Book (1887). In 1889, she published the True Ideal, a journal devoted to social purity and faith studies. In 1891, she removed to Chicago, where she became a special writer for the Daily News-Record and afterward, society editor of the Chicago Times. ==Personal life== She later married Mr. Miller and they removed to Anna, Illinois and then Peoria, Illinois where in 1918, Griffith died. ==Selected works== * A woman's evangel, 1892 ==References== ===Attribution=== * * * ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * * \"Individuality\", by Eva Kinney Griffith, Pennsylvania School Journal, Volume 39, 1890, p. 513 * \"Hygiene for Writers\", by Eva Kinney Griffith, The Author, Vol. III, Boston, January 15, 1891, pg. 1 * \"School Government\", by Eva Kinney Griffith, The New Education, Volumes 4\u20135, 1891, pg. 154 Category:1852 births Category:1918 deaths Category:19th-century American non-fiction writers Category:19th- century American novelists Category:19th-century American women writers Category:19th-century American newspaper editors Category:People from Whitewater, Wisconsin Category:University of Wisconsin\u2013Whitewater alumni Category:Woman's Christian Temperance Union people Category:American temperance activists Category:American magazine publishers (people) Category:Editors of Illinois newspapers Category:American women non-fiction writers Category:Women newspaper editors Category:Wikipedia articles incorporating text from A Woman of the Century ",
