    "text": "Murder Uncovered is an Australian true-crime series that first screened on the Seven Network on 8 February 2017 hosted by Michael Usher. This investigative series reopens infamous cases of killings and crimes in Australian criminal history. ==Broadcast== The third episode of Murder Uncovered, titled Two Weddings and 29 Funerals, was scheduled to be aired on 22 February 2017, but was indefinitely pulled due to legal reasons. The timeslot intended for the episode was instead used to broadcast a short message by Michael Usher explaining the schedule change, followed by an episode of Bride & Prejudice. It was later rescheduled to air on 20 March, but was rescheduled again to air on Monday, 27 March. The reason for the broadcast block was reported by Fairfax Media to be due to a judge in the Victorian Supreme Court requesting the Seven Network to co-operate for fear it might prejudice jurors in the then-ongoing trial of Stephen Asling, charged with murdering Graham \u201cThe Munster\u201d Kinniburgh in 2003. ==Episodes== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center; line-height:16px; width:99%;\" |- ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=4%; rowspan=\"2\" | No. Overall ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=4%; rowspan=\"2\" | No. in Season ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=20%; rowspan=\"2\" | Title ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=8%; rowspan=\"2\" | Original airdate ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=8%; rowspan=\"2\" | Duration ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=8%; colspan=\"2\" | Australian Viewers ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=8%; rowspan=\"2\" | Nightly Rank ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=4%; rowspan=\"2\" | Ref. |- ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=8% | Part 1 ! style=\"background: yellow;\" width=8% | Part 2 |- ! 1 | 1 | David & Catherine Birnie | | 120 minutes | 957,000 | 799,000 | #3 | |- ! 2 | 2 | Murray Hearne | | rowspan=\"2\" | 60 minutes | colspan=\"2\" | 577,000 | #14 | |- ! 3 | 3 | Angelika Gavare | | colspan=\"2\" | 675,000 | #10 | |- ! 4 | 4 | Leanne Holland | | rowspan=\"2\" | 120 minutes | 656,000 | 662,000 | #12 | |- ! 5 | 5 | Two Weddings and 29 Funerals | | 693,000 | 549,000 | #11 | |} ==See also== * List of Australian television series * Crime in Australia ==References== Category:Seven Network original programming Category:Australian non-fiction television series Category:Australian crime television series Category:2017 Australian television series debuts Category:2017 Australian television series endings ",
