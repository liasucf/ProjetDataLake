The complex was built by Gy\u00f6rgy K\u00e1rolyi from the K\u00e1rolyi noble family, designed by architects Henrich Koch and Mikl\u00f3s Ybl. There are 20 rooms in the building, and there is a guided tour. == History == From 1691 the Hochburg family was the first owner of the estate in Feh\u00e9rv\u00e1rcsurg\u00f3, then a branch of the Ber\u00e9nyi family inherited it, and later the Per\u00e9nyi family. According to records, before 1786 in the site of today's castle was the Baroque Castle of Baron Ign\u00e1c Per\u00e9nyi. In 1834, the estate was pledged by Imre Per\u00e9nyi to the Count Gy\u00f6rgy K\u00e1rolyi, who was a founding member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences with a donation of 40,000 HUF at the Reformation Assembly. In 1853, the area was finally bought by the K\u00e1rolyi family by way of purchase. The castle was built between 1844 and 1851 according to the plans of Henrich Koch, who also remodeled the Classicist K\u00e1rolyi Palace of Pest, the architect who lived in Vienna was represented by Mikl\u00f3s Ybl, who as architect of the K\u00e1rolyi family, was involved in the planning of the management. Aereal view After the death of Gy\u00f6rgy K\u00e1rolyi in 1877, the castle was inherited by his second-born son Viktor. and after his early death, in 1888 the castle was owned by Gyula K\u00e1rolyi, the organizer and first president of the Hungarian Red Cross Association.

Following the World War II, the castle and estate were removed from the K\u00e1rolyi family and nationalized without compensation. From 1946 it was utilized by Budapest Gas Works as a resort.
