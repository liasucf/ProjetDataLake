    "text": "This page documents the tornadoes and tornado outbreaks of 1990, primarily in the United States. Most tornadoes form in the U.S., although some events may take place internationally. Tornado statistics for older years like this often appear significantly lower than modern years due to fewer reports or confirmed tornadoes, however by the 1990s tornado statistics were coming closer to the numbers we see today. ==Synopsis== 1990 saw some unusual and powerful tornadoes and tornado outbreaks. On March 13 not one, but two F5 tornadoes struck Kansas, both coming from the same supercell. This was the only day since the 1974 Super Outbreak to have more than one F5 on the same day until the 2011 Super Outbreak, when four EF5 tornadoes touched down on April 27. In June, a strong outbreak struck the upper midwest United States and in late August a powerful F5 tornado struck the city of Plainfield, Illinois, resulting in significant loss of life and damage. ==Events== Confirmed tornado total for the entire year 1990 in the United States. ==January== There were 11 tornadoes confirmed in the US in January. ==February== There were 57 tornadoes confirmed in the US in February. ==March== There were 86 tornadoes confirmed in the US in March. ===March 11\u201313=== This destructive tornado outbreak produced at least 64 tornadoes across the region including four violent tornadoes.
