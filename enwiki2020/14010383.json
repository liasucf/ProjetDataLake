    "text": "The Seventh Battle of the Isonzo was fought from September 14-17, 1916 between the armies of the Kingdom of Italy and those of Austria-Hungary. It followed the Italian successes during the Trentino Offensive and the Sixth Battle of the Isonzo in the spring of 1916. == Battle == A short, sharp encounter fought from 14-17 September 1916, the Seventh Battle of the Isonzo saw Italian Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna shift his focus from broad-based diversionary attacks to tightly focused initiatives directed at single targets.. This latest Isonzo battle saw the Italian Third Army, with a large amount of artillery, attack on the Carso toward Nova Vas. Following a successful first day, Nova Vas was assaulted on the second day with substantial artillery bombardments on German bunkers. Within minutes of the Italians ceasing fire, the Austro-Hungarian forces surrendered. Nevertheless Cadorna's continued offensives along the So\u010da (Isonzo) did succeed in wearing away at Austro-Hungarian resources, both in terms of manpower and in crucial artillery availability. As each battle proceeded the Italians' war of attrition seemed ever more likely to wear the Austro-Hungarians into defeat, short of assistance from their German allies. The Eighth Battle of the Isonzo followed on 10 October 1916. ==See also== *First Battle of the Isonzo - 23 June-7 July 1915 *Second Battle of the Isonzo - 18 July-3 August 1915 *Third Battle of the Isonzo - 18 October-3 November 1915 *Fourth Battle of the Isonzo - 10 November-2 December 1915 *Fifth Battle of the Isonzo - 9-17 March 1916 *Sixth Battle of the Isonzo - 6-17 August 1916 *Eighth Battle of the Isonzo - 10-12 October 1916 *Ninth Battle of the Isonzo - 1-4 November 1916 *Tenth Battle of the Isonzo - 12 May-8 June 1917 *Eleventh Battle of the Isonzo - 19 August-12 September 1917 *Twelfth Battle of the Isonzo - 24 October-7 November 1917 also known as the Battle of Caporetto ==References== ==External links== *FirstWorldWar.Com: The Battles of the Isonzo, 1915-17 *Battlefield Maps: Italian Front *11 battles at the Isonzo *The Walks of Peace in the So\u010da Region Foundation.
