    "text": "Carex sprengelii, known as Sprengel's sedge and long-beaked sedge, is a sedge with hanging seed heads, native to North America. ==Description== Long-beaked sedge has flowering stems (culms) long. The leaves are wide and shorter than the flowering stems. Each flowering stem has 1 to 4 spikes of flowers. While flowering, they are crowded at the tip of the stem. The terminal spike is either all male or male with a few female flowers at the bottom. Each female spike has 10 to 40 female flowers, each about apart. Each spike is on its own stalk (pedicel), and each succeeding spike is shorter than the previous one. As the female flowers develop into seeds (achenes), the stalk droops or nods downwards. The bract enclosing the seed has a long tapered tip (beak), which gives the plant its common name. ==References== ==External links== * sprengelii Category:Flora of North America Category:Flora of Canada Category:Flora of Eastern Canada Category:Flora of Western Canada Category:Flora of the Northwestern United States Category:Flora of the North- Central United States Category:Flora of the Northeastern United States Category:Flora of the South-Central United States ",
