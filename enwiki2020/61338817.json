Originally meant to be a spin- off/continuation of Fey's series 30 Rock, the series was to star Alec Baldwin reprising his 30 Rock role of Jack Donaghy, following his political career in New York City. After around a year of negotiations, Baldwin dropped out of the project and was replaced with Danson. Danson declined to move from his home of Los Angeles, and the series was rewritten to take place there. On May 11, 2020, it was announced that the series would be called Mr. Mayor. The series will be executive produced by Tina Fey, Jeff Richmond, Robert Carlock and David Miner. Production companies involved with the series include Little Stranger, Bevel Gears, 3 Arts Entertainment and Universal Television. ===Casting=== In 2019, Deadline reported Bobby Moynihan had joined the cast as Jayden and later that Holly Hunter had also joined the cast as Arpi. In early 2020 Vella Lovell joined the cast as Mikaela, Mike Cabellon joined the cast as Tommy, and Kyla Kenedy joined the cast as Orly Bremer. ===Filming=== On March 12, 2020, Universal Television suspended the production of the series following the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on television. ==References== ==External links== * Category:American political comedy television series Category:English-language television shows Category:NBC original programming Category:Political satirical television series Category:Television series created by Tina Fey Category:Television series by 3 Arts Entertainment Category:Television series by Universal Television Category:Television shows set in Los Angeles Category:Television shows filmed in Los Angeles Category:Upcoming comedy television series Category:Television productions postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic ",
