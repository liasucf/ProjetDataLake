    "text": "The Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters\u2014more commonly referred to as the Hague Evidence Convention\u2014is a multilateral treaty which was drafted under the auspices of the Hague Conference on Private International Law (HCPIL). The treaty was negotiated in 1967 and 1968 and signed in The Hague on 18 March 1970. It entered into force in 1972. It allows transmission of letters of request (letters rogatory) from one signatory state (where the evidence is sought) to another signatory state (where the evidence is located) without recourse to consular and diplomatic channels.https://scholarship.law.unc.edu/ncilj/vol40/iss3/4/ Retrieved 15 February 2015. Inside the US, obtaining evidence under the Evidence Convention can be compared to comity.https://ssrn.com/abstract=2564797 The Hague Evidence Convention was not the first convention to address the transmission of evidence from one state to another. The 1905 Civil Procedure Convention\u2014also signed in The Hague\u2014contained provisions dealing with the transmission of evidence. However, that earlier convention did not command wide support and was only ratified by 22 countries. ==Substantive Provisions== ===Central authorities and procedures=== The convention establishes a procedure whereby each contracting state designates a \"central authority\" to receive and review incoming \"letters of request\" for taking evidence in that country. The central authority reviews the letter of request to determine that it complies with the requirements of the convention. If the letter of request does comply, the central authority then \"transmits\" the letter of request \"to the authority competent to execute\" it (article 2), which essentially means to a court. Under Article 9, the judicial authority that executes a letter of request applies its own law as to the methods and procedures for executing the letter of request. Under article 13, (a) the documents establishing the execution of the letter of request are to be sent by the requested authority (the recipient of the letter of request) to the requesting authority by the same channel that was used by the requesting authority, and (b) whenever the letter of request is not executed (in whole or in part), the requesting authority is to be informed immediately and advised of the reasons. ===Pre-trial discovery=== The convention also applies to pre-trial discovery: obtaining of evidence prior to trial without the prior approval of a judge. While this is a common practice in many common law countries, it was felt unacceptable by many others. Countries can however object to application to pre-trial discovery through an objection according to Article 23. As of April 2019, the convention applies to pre-trial discovery in 15 countries. 26 states have objected fully excluding pretrial discovery, while 17 others have restricted its applicability. An example of a partial objection to pre-trial discovery is from Mexico, requiring the start of the judicial proceedings, identifiability of the documents and a clear relationship between the requested documents and the pending proceedings: > C) FORMULATION OF PRE-TRIAL DISCOVERY OF DOCUMENTS 4\\. With reference to > Article 23 of the Convention, the United Mexican States declares that > according to Mexican law, it shall only be able to comply with letters of > request issued for the purpose of obtaining the production and transcription > of documents when the following requirements are met: (a) that the judicial > proceeding has been commenced; (b) that the documents are reasonably > identifiable as to date, subject and other relevant information and that the > request specifies those facts and circumstances that lead the requesting > party to reasonable believe that the requested documents are known to the > person from whom they are requested or that they are in his possession or > under his control or custody; (c) that the direct relationship between the > evidence or information sought and the pending proceeding be identified. ==Parties to the Hague Evidence Convention== {| style=\"border:solid 1px #aaa;\" cellpadding=\"10\" cellspacing=\"0\" |+Countries that ratified (cumulative by year) |- | ImageSize = width:auto height:180 barincrement:15 PlotArea = left:50 bottom:15 top:10 right:18 AlignBars =justify DateFormat = yyyy Period = from:0 till:62 TimeAxis = orientation:vertical ScaleMajor = unit:year increment:10 start:0 PlotData= color:orange width:15 bar:72 from:start till:3 text:3 bar:73 from:start till:3 text:3 bar:74 from:start till:4 text:4 bar:75 from:start till:6 text:6 bar:76 from:start till:9 text:9 bar:77 from:start till:10 text:10 bar:78 from:start till:11 text:11 bar:79 from:start till:13 text:13 bar:80 from:start till:13 text:13 bar:81 from:start till:15 text:15 bar:82 from:start till:16 text:16 bar:83 from:start till:17 text:17 bar:84 from:start till:17 text:17 bar:85 from:start till:17 text:17 bar:86 from:start till:18 text:18 bar:87 from:start till:20 text:20 bar:88 from:start till:20 text:20 bar:89 from:start till:21 text:21 bar:90 from:start till:21 text:21 bar:91 from:start till:21 text:21 bar:92 from:start till:22 text:22 bar:93 from:start till:24 text:24 bar:94 from:start till:25 text:25 bar:95 from:start till:26 text:26 bar:96 from:start till:28 text:28 bar:97 from:start till:30 text:30 bar:98 from:start till:30 text:30 bar:99 from:start till:31 text:31 bar:00 from:start till:34 text:34 bar:01 from:start till:37 text:37 bar:02 from:start till:38 text:38 bar:03 from:start till:39 text:39 bar:04 from:start till:42 text:42 bar:05 from:start till:43 text:43 bar:06 from:start till:43 text:43 bar:07 from:start till:44 text:44 bar:08 from:start till:47 text:47 bar:09 from:start till:50 text:50 bar:10 from:start till:52 text:52 bar:11 from:start till:54 text:54 bar:12 from:start till:56 text:56 bar:13 from:start till:56 text:56 bar:14 from:start till:58 text:58 bar:15 from:start till:58 text:58 bar:16 from:start till:60 text:60 bar:17 from:start till:61 text:61 bar:18 from:start till:61 text:61 bar:19 from:start till:62 text:62 |} As of 2019, there are 62 states which are parties of the Hague Evidence Convention. Fifty-six of the HCPIL member states are party to the Hague Evidence Convention. In addition, six states that are not members of the HCPIL (Barbados, Colombia, Kuwait, Liechtenstein, Nicaragua and Seychelles) have joined the Hague Evidence Convention. Article 39 of the Hague Evidence Convention expressly permits states which were not members of the HCPIL at the time of the conclusion of the treaty to accede to the Convention. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Under the law of the British Virgin Islands, if a witness is summoned to testify pursuant to a letter of request, a legal practitioner for any party may administer the oath to the witness.See http://www.mondaq.com/x/187532/trials+appeals+compensation/Guiding+You+Through+Letters+Of+Request+In+The+BVI The availability of a private lawyer to be directly involved is even more broad under Israeli law. As noted above, Israel has not issued an article 23 declaration. Israeli law provides, pursuant to the Legal Assistance Among States Law 1998,See http://www.justice.gov.il/En/Units/StateAttorney/DepartmentInternational/Pages/LegalAssistance.aspx for the possibility of the appointment of a private lawyer to oversee the process of taking evidence under the convention. That statute also governs the procedure for evidence-gathering in Israel in aid of foreign criminal investigations. As a result, even in civil matters (including Hague Evidence Convention requests), the Israeli court system usually assigns letters of request to judges in the criminal division. Due to that allocation, most Israeli decisions issued in connection with international evidence-gathering are stamped \"closed doors,\" which essentially means that it is unlawful to publish the decision. The American Bar Association conducted a survey to receive feedback from American lawyers concerning their experience with the letter of request procedures under the Hague Evidence Convention. The ABA published the results of the survey in October 2003, and its Conclusions section begins as follows: > The Hague Evidence Convention has been remarkably successful in bridging > differences between the common law and civil law approaches to obtaining > evidence and has significantly streamlined the procedures for compulsion of > evidence from abroad.https://static.lettersblogatory.com/wp- > content/uploads/2011/05/2003-us-response.pdf ==Obtaining evidence outside the convention== Insofar as requests to United States courts are concerned, parties may also use the simpler discovery provision codified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 (see Section 1782 Discovery). Between states of the European Union, the convention has largely been supplanted by Council Regulation (EC) No. 1206/2001 on Cooperation Between the Courts of the Member States in the Taking of Evidence in Civil or Commercial Matters. ==References== ==External links== *Hague Evidence Convention at the Hague Conference website *Ratifications Category:Treaties concluded in 1970 Category:Treaties entered into force in 1972 Category:Hague Conference on Private International Law conventions Category:Evidence law Category:Treaties of Albania Category:Treaties of Andorra Category:Treaties of Argentina Category:Treaties of Armenia Category:Treaties of Australia Category:Treaties of Barbados Category:Treaties of Belarus Category:Treaties of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Treaties of Brazil Category:Treaties of Bulgaria Category:Treaties of the People's Republic of China Category:Treaties of Colombia Category:Treaties of Costa Rica Category:Treaties of Croatia Category:Treaties of Cyprus Category:Treaties of the Czech Republic Category:Treaties of Czechoslovakia Category:Treaties of Denmark Category:Treaties of Estonia Category:Treaties of Finland Category:Treaties of France Category:Treaties of West Germany Category:Treaties of Greece Category:Treaties of Hungary Category:Treaties of Iceland Category:Treaties of India Category:Treaties of Israel Category:Treaties of Italy Category:Treaties of Kazakhstan Category:Treaties of Kuwait Category:Treaties of Latvia Category:Treaties of Liechtenstein Category:Treaties of Lithuania Category:Treaties of Luxembourg Category:Treaties of Malta Category:Treaties of Montenegro Category:Treaties of Mexico Category:Treaties of Morocco Category:Treaties of Monaco Category:Treaties of the Netherlands Category:Treaties of Nicaragua Category:Treaties of North Macedonia Category:Treaties of Norway Category:Treaties of Poland Category:Treaties of Portugal Category:Treaties of Romania Category:Treaties of Russia Category:Treaties of Serbia Category:Treaties of Seychelles Category:Treaties of Singapore Category:Treaties of Slovakia Category:Treaties of Slovenia Category:Treaties of South Africa Category:Treaties of South Korea Category:Treaties of Spain Category:Treaties of Sri Lanka Category:Treaties of Sweden Category:Treaties of Switzerland Category:Treaties of Turkey Category:Treaties of Ukraine Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom Category:Treaties of the United States Category:Treaties of Venezuela Category:1970 in the Netherlands Category:Treaties extended to Ashmore and Cartier Islands Category:Treaties extended to the Australian Antarctic Territory Category:Treaties extended to Christmas Island Category:Treaties extended to the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Category:Treaties extended to Heard Island and McDonald Islands Category:Treaties extended to Norfolk Island Category:Treaties extended to Aruba Category:Treaties extended to Akrotiri and Dhekelia Category:Treaties extended to Anguilla Category:Treaties extended to the Cayman Islands Category:Treaties extended to the Falkland Islands Category:Treaties extended to Gibraltar Category:Treaties extended to Guernsey Category:Treaties extended to the Isle of Man Category:Treaties extended to Jersey Category:Treaties extended to Guam Category:Treaties extended to Puerto Rico Category:Treaties extended to the United States Virgin Islands Category:Treaties extended to the Coral Sea Islands Category:Treaties extended to South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands Category:Treaties extended to Portuguese Macau Category:Treaties extended to British Hong Kong Category:Treaties extended to West Berlin Category:20th century in The Hague Category:Judicial cooperation ",
