    "text": "Tryon Country Club is a historic country club located near Tryon, Polk County, North Carolina. The nine-hole golf course was originally laid out in 1914; the course opened in 1917. The donor family attests that the layout was designed by noted golfer Donald Ross. The clubhouse was built in 1922, and is a one- story, five bay, Rustic Revival style log building with two projecting front- gable porches. The pro shop and storage building was built about 1935, and is a one-story side-gable frame structure, with additions made about 1940, 1958, and 1972. Also on the golf course is a contributing one-story frame building known as the Summer House and added in 1958. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2013. ==References== Category:Golf clubs and courses in North Carolina Category:Golf clubs and courses on the National Register of Historic Places Category:Sports venues on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:Clubhouses on the National Register of Historic Places in North Carolina Category:National Register of Historic Places in Polk County, North Carolina Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1922 Category:Buildings and structures in Polk County, North Carolina ",
