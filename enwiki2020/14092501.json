The station is owned by Coyote Communications and licensed to Morgan Hill, California, with a translator, K277BN, in San Martin, California. It serves the greater San Francisco Bay Area from North Santa Clara County to Marin County. Its studios are in San Jose, and it has a transmitter site just south of the city limits. As the Sunol Grade is reached, KYMX, an adult contemporary station from the Central Valley cuts off KSQQ's signal almost completely. The signal has difficulty reaching the Tri-Valley area because of rough terrain. ==Additional frequencies== In addition to the main station, KSQQ is relayed by these stations and translators to widen its broadcast area. ==External links== *R\u00e1dio Comercial Portuguesa *Singtao Chinese Radio *Bay Area Chinese Radio *Sound of Hope Radio Network *SVC Media *VNFM * * SQQ Category:Portuguese-language radio stations in the United States Category:Portuguese-American culture in California Category:Radio stations established in 1970 Category:1970 establishments in California SQQ Category:Mandarin-language radio stations SQQ Category:Chinese-language radio stations in the United States Category:Chinese-American culture in California Category:Vietnamese-American culture in California Category:Mass media in San Jose, California ",
