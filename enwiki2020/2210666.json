    "text": "Methodist Boys' School, Kuala Lumpur (; abbreviated MBS Kuala Lumpur) is a semi-government aided Cluster School of Excellence and High Performance School in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It was founded in July 1897, making it one of the oldest schools in Malaysia. It is known as MBS and its students are known as MBSians. The school is also known as Horley School, a reference to one of its principals, Rev. William E. Horley, who was responsible for changing and giving the school its present name from the previous name of Anglo-Tamil School. The name Horley School has been widely misunderstood as a reference to marble, which is also called Horley in Chinese, a game that was popular amongst its students then. It is noted for its library, which attracts visits from many other schools. The school was founded by Christian missionary Dr. Kensett in July 1897. The school population grew to be overwhelmingly Indian and the school was named Anglo-Tamil School, at a small wooden shophouse at the corner of Batu Road and Java Street, since demolished. In 1899, Rev. Abraham became its first headmaster, leading a staff of four teachers. It was then registered as a government-aided school. Three years later, the MBS proper was founded by Rev. W. E. Horley at the temporary premises of an unused pork market in Malacca Street. The Anglo-Tamil School was absorbed into it, opening up the school to all races. In 1904, the school decided to move to Petaling Hill (its present site) after a few evacuations by the sanitary board due to the dilapidated condition of the buildings. Within eight months, enough funds had been collected to erect a new building. Two new wings were constructed and a playing field laid down.MBS Centenary Commemorative Book. In 2008, Methodist Boys' Secondary School was awarded cluster school status by the Malaysian Ministry of Education (MOE). ==MBS Anthem== ===English Version=== The School Song was composed in 1948 by former principal, Mr. Hugh F. Clancy. The music was harmonised by N.Swan, in the same year. The school anthem was sung over Radio Malaya in 1949 by the school choir. Go forward MBS Filled with courage fine With your colours flying We will cheer you all the time And so you go forward MBS On to victory Work for the fame of our fair name Forward we must play the game The Malay Version was drafted during a competition to translate the school song in Malay in which Cheok Heng Wai of 5 Mori (1995), at that time, won the competition and this was the lyrics that followed. === Malay Version === The Song was translated into the national language in 1995. Majulah MBS Penuh azam baru Dengan semangat waja Kita menjulangkan namamu Majulah MBS Raih kejayaan Harumkan namamu selalu Kekalkan keunggulan , Methodist Boys' Secondary School. Source: Excelsior 1954 and Excelsior 2006 ==School Crest== The school badge consists of the words \"MBS\" and a banner in Or Yellow against a background shield of Azure Blue. Azure Blue, represents the fact that all humanity shares the same sky and a sense of togetherness. It represents the harmony of all the races in MBSSKL, and that the importance of each individual is recognised. Whereas, Or Yellow, represents the excellence for which we are encouraged to strive for. The school crest has changed somewhat throughout the years especially on the removal of a \"white cross\" upon which the text \"MBS\" once sat. The removal of the cross was initially made in deference to Muslim students in the school who would specifically wear the \"cross-less\" version of the badge. (The badges of convent schools which featured a prominent cross had to be completely redesigned.) Politically, Malaysia was developing into a primarily Muslim country with a multi-racial, multi-ethnic population who have long learnt to exist among each other with tolerance. The permanent removal of the cross in 1989 reflects this subtle shift in the country's sensitivity to the Muslim community. The shape of the bar in which the motto sits has been morphed over the years. The most recent crest shows that the bar curves down on both sides and extends beyond the crest body. The original crest that was last used in the mid-nineteen seventies had it pointed up at both the edges and is shorter than the crest body. The motto, \"Ora et Labora\" means \"Pray and Work\" in Latin. Source: Excelsior 2004 ==School Magazine== The school magazine of the MBSSKL is named the Excelsior. It was published annually by the Excelsior Editorial Board since 1906 to the late 1910s where it was discontinued before being revived by Dr. Ho Seng Ong in the early 1920s, then still a student in the school before becoming a principal later. It is one of the oldest school magazines in the entire country. The first school magazine which was published in the year 1906 is still in the possession of the school's archive and principal. In 2007, the Excelsior magazine was awarded as the best school magazine in the country. ==School Library== The MBSSKL Library is supposedly the oldest school library in the country. The Library was founded in 1906, by philanthropist Mr. Eu Tong Sen of Perak, the youngest son of Mr. Eu Kong, founder of Eu Yan Sang company. In 1937, the library was renamed the Lum Mun Yoke Memorial Library. In 1941, war broke out and left the library in shambles. In 1947, the library was revived by former principal Mr. S. Kanagaratnam (Acting). At the early stages of revival, only senior students were allowed to use the library while the library masters were working hard to restore the condition of the library. Initially, during these stages, the library was separated into three libraries, namely the Students' Library, the Form Six Library and the Staff Library. The library was at that time located directly above the principal's office, which according to sources, was located at the Hinch Block. In 1957, Students who were voluntary helpers were formally given the title \"Student Librarians\". In 1962, the Student Librarians were formally recognised as \"The Board of Student Librarians\" and were given the privilege of wearing a light blue shirt to distinguish themselves from the rest of the students, hence earning them the name \"Lightblues\". Before this, no other Student Librarian body in the country had the honour of wearing a special distinctive uniform. Special badges were given out as well. Until today, the Board of Student Librarians has still retained their traditional white and lightblue uniform, with the addition of a dark blue blazer, which is the highest honour given to student leaders. Only the 2 most distinguished boards of the school have been given permission to don dark blue (The School Colour), while the rest of the Boards have no blazers or black blazers. In the 60s also, the libraries were once again centralised to form the MBSSKL Central Library. The Central Library was relocated to the top floor of the T. Mori Block. The school library also earned the distinction of being one of the first libraries in town to enjoy central air conditioning and had a fine collection of reference books. This is proved by the fact that the Central Library was a popular place for Methodites to study in and was opened on weekdays. The Central Library also occasionally opened during Saturdays until 6 pm. In 1962, the library was designated a \"model school library\". Many other schools have visited the MBSSKL library to learn from its library, including schools from as far as Thailand. The visitors were never disappointed with the standard of the library, which was considered to be among the most well-equipped school library in the nation in that era. In 2006, the library shifted to its current premises on top floor of the Tan Sri Dato' Seri(Dr) Lim Goh Tong block. It is located in a big hall known as the Wong Chee Kooi room and Reunion 5971 room, and the library itself is called the Centenary Library. It is administrated by the Board of Student Librarians, and the Junior Board of Student Librarians. The motto of the Board of Student Librarians is \"Esprit de Corps\", which means \"the spirit of togetherness\". Source: MBSSKL Library Heritage Corner ==History== MBSKL was founded by Rev. Dr. William T. Kensett, a naval officer of the Royal Navy battleship HMS Orion. In July 1897 he decided to set up a church and school for the Tamils in Kuala Lumpur, and he left the British Navy. A shophouse was secured at the corner of Batu Road and Java Street, and the predominantly Tamil school was named the Anglo-Tamil School. In 1904, the school moved to its current premises on Petaling Hill and was renamed the Methodist Boys' School Kuala Lumpur by Rev William E Horley, the name used until this day. In 1954, the 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys' Brigade Company was set up in the school by Mr. Khoo Oon Soo and Mr. R.A. Allen. After the first few years, 1st KL shifted to the Wesley Church just next door to the school, and used the Church premises as its meeting place. The 1st Kuala Lumpur Boys' Brigade Company is the 3rd oldest company in Malaysia, and is known for its history in Band, Footdrill and Talent Time competition results at National Level. The Company has also produced a fine collection of President's Men and Founder's Men, as well as two Queen's Men. In 1958, the school was divided into the Secondary School (MBSSKL) and the Primary School (MBPSKL) in accordance with Malaysia's new Education Policy. In its natural geography, Petaling Hill, on which MBS now stands, the school overlooks one of the oldest business sections of Kuala Lumpur which consists of many of the oldest Chinese business establishments. The reason for Rev Horley choosing this site for the Wesley Church, the parsonage and the school was not different from other pioneer missionaries who chose sites for church, school and living quarters in other parts of the country. It was to be close to the community whom they wanted to serve, but yet sufficiently removed to have the quiet serenity for school and church to function and the incumbent pastor who used to also head the school, to dwell in peace. It is not surprising that as the country developed and as towns became cities, churches and schools which were once at the fringes of towns, are now engulfed in the midst of city centres. Numbered among the former students are successful citizens in all walks of life and professions. There is no record of the progress and achievements of students who have left the school. The school's traditional rivals are the Victoria Institution and St. John's Institution, as the two institutions together with MBSKL are generally known as the top three boys' schools in Kuala Lumpur. This friendly rivalry existed way back in the three schools' history of over 100 years, not only on the sports field but also in academic and extracurricular pursuits. The MBSSKL bell is the oldest existing school bell in Kuala Lumpur and dates from 1923. It was mounted in a special tower built by MBSOBA and was located at the Reading Corner. The tower was demolished along with the Youth Center on 28 June 2010. However, the bell tower was restored and rebuilt in its old spot in 2014. Source: MBSKL Centenary Commemorative Book ==Culture== ===Uniform=== The traditional uniform for the students is white long pants and a white shirt, with a plain dark blue tie. However, the school has changed its uniform in line with Government policy which requires all secondary students to wear Olive Green pants and a white shirt. MBSSKL does not allow the wearing of pants with pleats and/or bell-bottoms. The school tie is navy blue in colour, with repeated patterns of the school crest. A metal school badge is worn over the left pocket, and a cloth name tag sewn on under the school badge. Students from different year groups would have different coloured name tags. Nevertheless, temporary name tags are available for sale during morning assemblies and recess time. (Until 2004, the name tags were made of plastic, coloured based on forms with black wordings for students.) Members of the all the student boards wear different uniforms and metal badges except those in the Editorial Board. ===Student Boards=== There are eight major boards in the school, namely the Prefectorial Board, Board of Student Librarians, Editorial Board, IT Brigade, the Sportsmen's Board, SPBT Prefects Board, Board of Student Cooperation, and Board of Class Monitors. ====Prefects==== The Prefectorial Board was founded in 1931. The head of prefects in MBSSKL are known as School Captains (Kapten Sekolah) and not Head Prefects (Ketua Pengawas). In the event that a former School Captain should return to study in the school for the Lower and Upper Six form, he would immediately assume the post of Honorary School Captain and be part of the Executive Committee until the incumbent Executive Committee retires. Former Senior Prefects returning to study in the school for the Lower and Upper Six form are considered assets to the Board and are immediately reinstated. In any one academic year, a Vice Captain 2 may be elected in the Annual General Meeting if the position is deemed necessary. However, the position is reserved for a Form 6 Senior Prefect only. Interviews for appointments as prefects are extended only to selected students after exhaustive vetting. Appointments to students of the Lower Sixth Form are reserved for girls. The interviewing panel consist of the members of the Executive Committee, although pro tem EXCOs may take up this responsibility if the interviews fall after 31 July. Successful interviewees would undergo a period of probation where the duration is determined by the Executive Committee of the Board and the Advisor(s). Inauguration of the in- coming elected Executive Committee and the installation of new Senior Prefects are held annually in a ceremony on Prefects' Day. Upon installation, the new Senior Prefects will wear a Prefect's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a blue banner beneath bearing the word \"Prefect\" in white lettering. A Prefect's name tag is yellow with navy blue lettering, and is worn immediately below the Prefect's Badge. The Executive Committee members of the Prefectorial Board are the only students in the school warranted to wear special school badges that bear their respective portfolio titles in white lettering on a blue banner beneath the school crest (e.g. Secretary), unlike the Executive Committee members of other boards where a separate tag is worn beneath their Board badges (i.e. The Librarian Chairman wears a tag stating his position - \"Chairman of Centenary Library\" below his Librarian's Badge and above his white name tag.). Aside from maintaining student discipline, the Prefects are organisers of the annual Teachers' Day and are given near-total autonomy for all the activities in the event. ====Librarians==== The Board of Student Librarians proper was founded in 1962 although students who were voluntary helpers were formally given the title \"Student Librarians\" in 1957. In 1962, the current uniform of the librarians was designed by former teacher advisor Mrs. Sally Ti. The Librarians wear a Librarian's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a yellow banner beneath bearing the word \"Librarian\" . A Librarian's name tag is white with dark blue lettering, and is worn immediately below the Librarian's Badge. The Executive Committee members of the Board of Student Librarians retains their Board Badge and wears a separate tag bearing their respective portfolio titles. ====Sportsmen==== The Sportsmen's Club (Now Sportsmen's Board) was founded in the early 1970s. Membership to this board is extremely exclusive to those who excel in sports and character. Annually, less than 5 students are awarded membership to the Sportsmen's Board. The Sportsmen wear a Sportman's Badge, which is a silver pentadecagon with 120 decorative straight lines (8 lines between each vertices) projecting outwards engraved on the edge with the standard school crest in the centre encircled by a blue ring that bear the words \"Lembaga Olahragawan Kuala Lumpur\". ====Information Technology Brigade==== The IT Brigade was established in 2006 to develop the IT infrastructure in the school compound. Their duties include all computer-related issues of the school especially maintaining the Multimedia labs for the students' usage and computer repairs. The IT Brigadiers wear an IT Brigadier's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a black banner beneath bearing the word \"IT Brigade\". An IT Brigadier's name tag is silver with black lettering, finished with a clear protective layer, and is worn immediately below the IT Brigadier's Badge. The Executive Committee members of the IT Brigade retains their Board Badge and wears a separate tag bearing their respective portfolio titles. ====SPBT Prefects (BOSS)==== The Board of Student SPBT Prefects was established in 2012 to coordinate the loaning, returning and preservation of textbooks under the textbook loaning programme introduced by the Malaysian Ministry of Education. Apart from the annual loaning and returning of textbooks at the end of every academic year, they are responsible for making sure the textbooks are treated with care and respect throughout the loan period. The BOSS Prefects are trained to wrap books neatly (i.e. wrapping the covers tightly with minimal excess plastic wrapping) and cataloguing textbooks. The BOSS Prefects wear a BOSS Prefect's Badge, which is the standard school crest with a red banner beneath bearing the word \"BOSS\". ====Editorial==== The Editorial Board was established in 1906. Members of this Board do not wear special uniforms and may consist of students of any age. Membership from students in existing Boards are allowed as long as their prior responsibilities do not impede the progress of the magazine production. The Excelsior's Editor-in-Chief is assisted by his sub-editors and six other departments, namely Highlights, Organisation, Miscellaneous, Graphics, Photography, and Profiles. Every member is selected based on their strengths (e.g. writing, photography, etc.) and ability to work in a team. The teacher advisor and the team are given privileged access to all events related to the school so as to be able to capture important moments in photos and words for the Excelsior. The Board's duties regardless of whichever department is labour-intensive and requires precision in their works to be able to meet tight deadlines with external printers, photographers and binders. ====Board of Student Cooperation==== The Board of Student Cooperation was established in 2017 to help in managing mainly students locker and promoting school supplies such as school tie and badges. The uniform of this Board is black slacks with white colour sleeve shirts together with a badge. ====Board of Class Monitors==== The Board of Class Monitors was established to primarily assist teachers with daily tasks such as taking attendance and maintaining the order in class. Members of this Board do not wear special uniforms but a small tag written with \"Ketua Tingkatan\" and \"Penolong Ketua Tingkatan\" was given to the members and are required to wear with school uniforms at all times. The Board will have meetings every first week of the month to discuss about problems faced in class, rules and regulations in class and the cleanliness of each class. ===Discipline=== MBSSKL operates a merit/demerit points scheme for rewards and punishments. The computer server and system is maintained and coordinated by the Prefectorial Board with guidance from the Senior Assistant of Student Affairs and discipline teachers. Accumulated demerit points may be worked off by carrying out tasks such as cleaning the assembly terraces, field and walkways.Rules and Regulations, Methodist Boys' Secondary School. Corporal punishment is administered for a wide range of school offences, consisting of either one, two or three strokes of the cane.Peraturan Sekolah Untuk Murid, SMKL Methodist, 2010. ===House System=== Like other former British schools, MBS practises the house system, although nowadays the house system is mainly for sports purposes. Four of the houses are named after donors who provided the establishment funds of the school, and one is named after a prominent former principal. 3 new houses were introduced in 2009. The houses are: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! House ! Named after ! Colour !

IT Brigade joined in as the 4th Board in 2007 and SPBT Board joined in as the 5th Board in 2012. Traditionally, the main focus of this event was the installation of the members of the above boards, but over the years, the function has evolved to no longer include installation. It is now a day of fun, socialising and fellowship with student leaders from KL and Selangor schools, and is always organised in a way that brings positive outcomes to the boards as well as the school. It can also be a day of conference where Kuala Lumpur and Selangor school leaders meet up together and discuss about issues arising among students as well as to solve the problems. Like most events organised in MBSSKL, students are given near-total autonomy on selecting the theme and planning the events of the day. The 29th Combined Boards' Day was held in 2019. ==Co-curricular== ===Uniform Bodies=== There are 7 uniformed bodies in the school as of 2009. Some examples are: Uniform bodies in MBSSKL ===10th Kuala Lumpur Air Scouts Group=== 10th Kuala Lumpur Air Scouts was established in 1915 and absorbed 15th Kuala Lumpur Scouts Troop after the second World War.
