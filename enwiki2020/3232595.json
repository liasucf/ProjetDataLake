    "text": ":For former name of a road in Tsim Sha Tsui, see Hankow Road. Garden Road is a major road on Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong, connecting the Central and Mid- Levels areas. At its lower (Central) end, Garden Road forms a grade-separated intersection with Queensway. For most of its length, Garden Road carries traffic only in the downhill direction. Uphill traffic is carried by Cotton Tree Drive, parallel to and to the east of Garden Road. Cotton Tree Drive merges with Garden Road just above the intersection with Upper Albert Road, and Garden Road continues uphill to an intersection with Robinson Road and Magazine Gap Road in the Mid-levels. Garden Road is rich in historical and heritage value. The Bank of China Tower, Three Garden Road, St. John's Cathedral, St. John's Building, the Helena May main building, the lower terminus of the Peak Tram, the United States Consulate-General, and the Hong Kong Zoological and Botanical Gardens all lie on the road. ==See also== * List of streets and roads in Hong Kong ==External links== *Google Maps of Garden Road Category:Central, Hong Kong Category:Government Hill Category:Roads in Hong Kong ",
