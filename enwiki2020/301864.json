    "text": "Larry King (born Lawrence Harvey Zeiger; November 19, 1933) is an American television and radio host, whose work has been recognized with awards including two Peabodys, an Emmy award, and 10 Cable ACE Awards. King began as a local Florida journalist and radio interviewer in the 1950s and 1960s and gained prominence beginning in 1978 as host of The Larry King Show, an all- night nationwide call-in radio program heard on the Mutual Broadcasting System. From 1985 to 2010, he hosted the nightly interview television program Larry King Live on CNN. From 2012 until 2020, he hosted Larry King Now on Hulu and RT America. He continues to host Politicking with Larry King, a weekly political talk show which has aired weekly on the same two channels since 2013.RT schedule Click on America for RT America. Accessed September 15. 2013. ==Early life and education== King was born in Brooklyn, New York, one of two kids of Jennie (Gitlitz), a garment worker who was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, and Aaron Zeiger, a restaurant owner and defense-plant worker who was born in Kolomyia, Austria-Hungary.Larry King Fast Facts CNN. May 5, 2013 His parents were Orthodox Jews. King attended Lafayette High School, a public high school in Brooklyn. King's father died at 44 of a heart attack which resulted in his mom, brother and himself being supported by welfare. King was greatly affected by his father's death, and he lost interest in school. ==Career== After graduating high school, Larry worked to help support his mother. From an early age, he desired to work in radio broadcasting. ===Miami radio and television=== A CBS staff announcer, whom King met by chance, suggested he go to Florida which was a growing media market with openings for inexperienced broadcasters. King went to Miami, and after initial setbacks, he gained his first job in radio. The manager of a small station, WAHR (now WMBM) in Miami Beach, hired him to clean up and perform miscellaneous tasks. When one of the station's announcers abruptly quit, King was put on the air. His first broadcast was on May 1, 1957, working as the disc jockey from 9 a.m. to noon. He also did two afternoon newscasts and a sportscast. He was paid $50 a week. He acquired the name Larry King when the general manager, Marshall Simmonds, claimed that Zeiger was too ethnic and difficult to remember, so minutes before airtime, Larry chose the surname King, which he got from an advertisement in the Miami Herald for King's Wholesale Liquor. Within two years, he legally changed his name to Larry King. He began to conduct interviews on a mid-morning show for WIOD, at Pumpernik's Restaurant in Miami Beach. He would interview whoever walked in. His first interview was with a waiter at the restaurant. Two days later, singer Bobby Darin, in Miami for a concert that evening, walked into Pumpernik's having heard King's radio show; Darin became King's first celebrity interview guest. King's Miami radio show brought him local attention. A few years later, in May 1960, he hosted Miami Undercover, airing Sunday nights at 11:30 p.m. on WPST-TV Channel 10 (now WPLG). On the show, he moderated debates on important local issues of the day. King credits his success on local television to the assistance of comedian Jackie Gleason, whose national television variety show was being taped in Miami Beach during this time. \"That show really took off because Gleason came to Miami,\" King said in a 1996 interview he gave when inducted into the Broadcasters' Hall of Fame. \"He did that show and stayed all night with me. We stayed till five in the morning. He didn't like the set, so we broke into the general manager's office and changed the set. Gleason changed the set, he changed the lighting, and he became like a mentor of mine.\" King's mugshot from 1971 arrest in Miami During this period, WIOD gave King further exposure as a color commentator for the Miami Dolphins of the National Football League, during their 1970 season and most of their 1971 season. However, he was dismissed by both WIOD and television station WTVJ as a late-night radio host and sports commentator as of December 20, 1971, when he was arrested after being accused of grand larceny by a former business partner, Louis Wolfson. Other staffers covered the Dolphins' games into their 24\u20133 loss to Dallas in Super Bowl VI. King also lost his weekly column at the Miami Beach Sun newspaper. The charges were dropped. Eventually, King was rehired by WIOD. For several years during the 1970s, he hosted a sports talk-show called \"Sports-a- la-King\" that featured guests and callers. ===National radio=== King interviewing Vladimir Putin in 2000 President George W. Bush and First Lady Laura Bush in 2006 On January 30, 1978, King went national on a nightly Mutual Broadcasting System coast-to-coast broadcast, inheriting the talk show slot that had begun with Herb Jepko in 1975, then followed by \"Long John\" Nebel in 1977, until his illness and death the following year. King's Mutual show rapidly developed a devoted audience. The program was broadcast live Monday through Friday from midnight to 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time. King would interview a guest for the first 90 minutes, with callers asking questions that continued the interview for another 90 minutes. At 3 a.m., the Open Phone America segment began, where he allowed callers to discuss any topic they pleased with him, until the end of the program, when he expressed his own political opinions. Many stations in the western time zones carried the Open Phone America portion of the show live, followed by the guest interview on tape delay. Some of King's regular callers used pseudonyms or were given nicknames by King, such as \"The Numbers Guy\", \"The Chair\", \"The Portland Laugher,\" \"The Miami Derelict,\" and \"The Scandal Scooper\". The show was successful, starting with relatively few affiliates and eventually growing to more than 500. King hosted the show until stepping down in 1994.Larry King Bio King occasionally entertained the audience by telling amusing stories from his youth or early broadcasting career. For its final year, the show was moved to afternoons. After King stepped down, Mutual gave the afternoon slot to David Brenner and Mutual's affiliates were given the option of carrying the audio of King's new CNN evening television program. After Westwood One dissolved Mutual in 1999, the radio simulcast of the CNN show continued until December 31, 2009. ===CNN=== King during a recording of his Larry King Live program at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, in 2006 The Larry King Live CNN show began in June 1985 in which King hosted a broad range of guests from controversial figures of UFO conspiracy theories and alleged psychics,One notable guest is Sylvia Browne, who in 2005 told the Newsweek magazine that King, a believer in the paranormal, asks her to do private psychic readings. to prominent politicians and leading figures in the entertainment industry, often doing their first or only interview on breaking news stories on his show. After doing his CNN show from 9 to 10 p.m., King then traveled to the studios of the Mutual Broadcasting System to do his radio show, when both shows still aired. Unlike many interviewers, King has a direct, non-confrontational approach. His reputation for asking easy, open-ended questions has made him attractive to important figures who want to state their position while avoiding being challenged on contentious topics. King has said that when interviewing authors, he does not read their books in advance, so that he will not know more than his audience. Throughout his career, King has interviewed many of the leading figures of his time. According to CNN, King has conducted more than 30,000 interviews in his career. King also wrote a regular newspaper column in USA Today for almost 20 years, from shortly after that first national newspaper's debut in Baltimore-Washington in 1982 until September 2001. The column consisted of short \"plugs, superlatives and dropped names\" but was dropped when the newspaper redesigned its \"Life\" section. The column was resurrected in blog form in November 2008 and on Twitter in April 2009. ====Departure==== On June 29, 2010, King announced that after 25 years, he would be stepping down from his nightly job hosting Larry King Live. However, he stated that he would remain with CNN to host occasional specials. The announcement came in the wake of speculation that CNN had approached Piers Morgan, the British television personality and journalist, as King's primetime replacement, which was confirmed that September. The final edition of Larry King Live aired on December 16, 2010, after a quarter-century. The show concluded with his last thoughts and a thank you to his audience for watching and supporting him over the years. The concluding words of Larry King on the show were, \"I... I, I don't know what to say except to you, my audience, thank you.

In 2020, it was reported that King had unwittingly been duped into filming a purported interview that was in fact part of a Chinese propaganda campaign against Guo Wengui, a Chinese dissident in New York City whom the Chinese government seeks to have deported. In 2019, King was asked by Jacobi Niv, a friend who had in the past arranged for King to film various informercials and promotional videos to film what King was told would be a conference video. Niv gave King a list of scripted questions to read. These were later edited into a video of comments by Russian journalist Anastasia Dolgova on the topic of Guo Wengui, whom Dolgova alleged had committed a number of crimes. The video was edited to give the appearance of King and Dolgova having a live conversation however the questions and answers were recorded separately and King, reading a script, was unaware of her responses, which repeated the line of the Chinese government on the issue. Once King's own production company saw the completed video, they refused to post it online and asked that it not be released. Niv disregarded their objections and released the video independently on YouTube. King's family insisted that it be removed but once Niv took it down he found that it had been duplicated and gone viral on Twitter due to the efforts of what ProPublica alleges are Chinese government run social media accounts. As a result of the incident, King has severed his relationship with Niv, saying he believes Niv took advantage of their friendship. ==Personal life== King has been married eight times, to seven women.
