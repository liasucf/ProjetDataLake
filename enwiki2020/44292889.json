Sahm began playing drums at a young age after being inspired by his father's music and by KISS,Shandon Sahm Interview on My San Antonio site with his first appearance on record being Where the Pyramid Meets the Eye: A Tribute To Roky Erickson, in 1990.Shandon Sahm Discography on All Music site During the early '90s, Sahm was drumming for the heavy metal band Pariah, who issued one album for Geffen Records, To Mock a Killingbird, in 1993. After Pariah split up, Sahm supplied drums on a Sir Douglas Quintet album, 1994's Day Dreaming at Midnight, before first crossing paths with Meat Puppets singer/guitarist Curt Kirkwood, who had relocated to Texas, and was looking to put a new band together (as the Meat Puppets were on hiatus at the time). Kirkwood enlisted Sahm and his ex-Pariah bandmate, guitarist Kyle Ellison, as well as ex-Bob Mould bassist Andrew Duplantis, to form the Royal Neanderthal Orchestra. Eventually, the band adopted the familiar Meat Puppets moniker, and issued an EP in 1999, You Love Me (on which Sahm earned a co- songwriting credit with Kirkwood, for the tune \"Been Caught Itchin'\") and a studio album in 2000, Golden Lies (which saw Sahm earn another co-songwriting credit with Kirkwood, for the composition \"Hercules\"). Despite mounting a successful U.S. tour in support of Golden Lies, this version of the Meat Puppets would splinter by 2002, but a live album from the tour, Meat Puppets Live, would be issued that year. An unreleased Meat Puppets song that featured Sahm on drums (\"New Leaf\") would be included on the 2004 compilation, Classic Puppets, and in 2009, Sahm supplied drums on the release Keep Your Soul: A Tribute to Doug Sahm (which featured contributions by the likes of Los Lobos, Alejandro Escovedo, Greg Dulli, Jimmie Vaughan, Dave Alvin, Joe \"King\" Carrasco, etc.). Also in 2004, Sahm joined Butthole Surfers singer Gibby Haynes (in his band, Gibby Haynes and His Problem) for a U.S. tour and provided drums for a self-titled record by the band, which was released on Surfdog Records (and includes such songs as \"Redneck Sex,\" \"Charlie,\" \"Dream Machine,\" \"Kaiser,\" \"Woo\"). The band went on to perform a string of dates with Ween. L-R: Elmo Kirkwood, Cris Kirkwood, Curt Kirkwood, and Shandon Sahm. With Curt and Cris Kirkwood reconciling circa 2006, the Meat Puppets reunited, but without original drummer Derrick Bostrom.
