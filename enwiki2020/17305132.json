Until 1998, the museum ran an educational programme for ten- to seventeen-year-olds titled \"\u0091In the World of Byzantine Icons\"\u0092, and one of its aims for 2000 is to resume the programme. It involved a guided tour of the museum and a detailed account of the stages of the making of an icon, accompanied by related activities and games. ==Gallery== File:Macedonian_Museums-15-Byzantino_Kastorias-70.jpg|View inside File:Macedonian_Museums-15-Byzantino_Kastorias-71.jpg|Icon of St Paraskevi carrying her own head, and two Vema doors with a representation of the Annunciation File:Macedonian_Museums-15-Byzantino_Kastorias-72.jpg|Prophet Elijah (12th century) File:Macedonian_Museums-15-Byzantino_Kastorias-73.jpg|Christ Pantocrator (16th century) ==References== ==External links== *Macedonian-heritage.gr *Hellenic Ministry of Culture and Tourism / in Greek *Ministry of Foreign Affairs *listed in www.icon-network.org Kastoria Category:Museums in Kastoria Category:Byzantine art Category:Museums established in 1989 ",
