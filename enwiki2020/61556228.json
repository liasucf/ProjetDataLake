    "text": "Election Day is an alternate history short story written by Harry Turtledove. It was first published in the anthology Alternate Peace (Steven H Silver and Joshua Palmatier, eds, Zombies Need Brains, 2019).http://www.uchronia.net/label/turtelecti.html ==Plot== The story, told in the second-person, follows Ralph Tompkins of Youngstown, Ohio as he votes on election day in the 2016 United States presidential election, first thing, then goes about his normal work routine. While Donald Trump is the Republican Party nominee as he was in real life, the identity of the Democratic Party nominee is not revealed to the reader, although there are some hints as to the person's identity, including the fact that he is or was a Senator for the state of New York and that he was part of a political dynasty. After a day at work, Tompkins returns home and watches the election coverage. Initially, the electoral vote matches the results of real life. In the end, however, the so- called \"Blue Wall\" holds. Although Trump is able to carry the traditional swing states of Florida and Ohio, the Democratic candidate carries Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan, thereby winning the presidency. Trump gives a graceless concession speech. Tompkins is relieved that Trump didn't contest the results as promised. Then the story finally reveals the identity of the Democratic winner: John F. Kennedy Jr.. It is revealed that Kennedy entered politics during the early 2000s and became a senator. He and his wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy are still married, and have a 12-year-old son, both of whom are present as he speaks. Kennedy vows to continue the policies of Barack Obama, emphasizing the expansion of healthcare reform. Kennedy concludes his victory speech by thanking Carolyn for convincing him not to fly on the night of July 16, 1999. It is also revealed that Michael Bennet served as Kennedy's running mate. The story ends with Tompkins realizing how early in the morning it now is. ==References== ==External links== * Short story on baen.com Category:2019 short stories Category:Short stories by Harry Turtledove Category:Alternate history short stories Category:American short stories Category:Fiction set in 2016 Category:Cultural depictions of Donald Trump Category:2016 United States presidential election in popular culture Category:Ohio in fiction Category:Works about the Kennedy family Category:Michael Bennet ",
