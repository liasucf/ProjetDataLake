    "text": "In geometry, the ten-of-diamonds decahedron is a space-filling polyhedron with 10 faces, 2 opposite rhombi with orthogonal major axes, connected by 8 identical isosceles triangle faces. Although it is convex, it is not a Johnson solid because its faces are not composed entirely of regular polygons. Michael Goldberg named it after a playing card, as a 10-faced polyhedron with two opposite rhombic (diamond-shaped) faces. He catalogued it in a 1982 paper as 10-II, the second in a list of 26 known space-filling decahedra.Goldberg, Michael. On the Space-filling Decahedra. Structural Topology, 1982, num. Type 10-II ==Coordinates == If the space-filling polyhedron is placed in a 3-D coordinate grid, the coordinates for the 8 vertices can be given as: (0, \u00b12, \u22121), (\u00b12, 0, 1), (\u00b11, 0, \u22121), (0, \u00b11, 1). :160px == Symmetry == The ten-of- diamonds has D2d symmetry, which projects as order-4 dihedral (square) symmetry in two dimensions. It can be seen as a triakis tetrahedron, with two pairs of coplanar triangles merged into rhombic faces. The dual is similar to a truncated tetrahedron, except two edges from the original tetrahedron are reduced to zero length making pentagonal faces. The dual polyhedra can be called a skew-truncated tetragonal disphenoid, where 2 edges along the symmetry axis completely truncated down to the edge midpoint. {| class=wikitable width=400 |+ Symmetric projection |- !colspan=2|Ten of diamonds !Related !colspan=2|Dual !Related |- align=center valign=top |120px Solid faces |120px Edges |120px triakis tetrahedron |120px Solid faces |120px Edges |120px Truncated tetrahedron |- align=center |colspan=2|v=8, e=16, f=10 |v=8, e=18, f=12 |colspan=2|v=10, e=16, f=8 |v=12, e=18, f=8 |} == Honeycomb== {| class=\"wikitable\" align=\"right\" style=\"margin-left:10px\" width=\"240\" !bgcolor=#e7dcc3 colspan=2|Ten-of-diamonds honeycomb |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Schl\u00e4fli symbol||dht1,2{4,3,4} |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Coxeter diagram|| |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Cell||Ten-of-diamonds 80px |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Vertex figures||dodecahedron tetrahedron |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Space Fibrifold Coxeter||I (204) 8\u2212o 4,3+,4 |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Dual||Alternated bitruncated cubic honeycomb |- |bgcolor=#e7dcc3|Properties||Cell-transitive |} The ten-of-diamonds is used in the honeycomb with Coxeter diagram , being the dual of an alternated bitruncated cubic honeycomb, .

Cells can be seen as the cells of the tetragonal disphenoid honeycomb, , with alternate cells removed and augmented into neighboring cells by a center vertex. The rhombic faces in the honeycomb are aligned along 3 orthogonal planes. {| class=wikitable width=500 !Uniform !Dual !Alternated !colspan=2|Dual alternated |- ! t1,2{4,3,4} ! dt1,2{4,3,4} ! ht1,2{4,3,4} !colspan=2| dht1,2{4,3,4} |- valign=top |137px Bitruncated cubic honeycomb of truncated octahedral cells |110px tetragonal disphenoid honeycomb |107pxDual honeycomb of icosahedra and tetrahedra |139px Ten-of-diamonds honeycomb |175px Honeycomb structure orthogonally viewed along cubic plane |} == Related space- filling polyhedra== The ten-of-diamonds can be dissected in an octagonal cross-section between the two rhombic faces. It is a decahedron with 12 vertices, 20 edges, and 10 faces (4 triangles, 4 trapezoids, 1 rhombus, and 1 isotoxal octagon). Michael Goldberg labels this polyhedron 10-XXV, the 25th in a list of space-filling decahedra.On Space-filling Decahedra, type 10-XXV. The ten-of-diamonds can be dissected as a half-model on a symmetry plane into a space-filling heptahedron with 6 vertices, 11 edges, and 7 faces (6 triangles and 1 trapezoid).

The two right-most symmetric projections below show the rhombi edge-on on the top, bottom and a middle neck where the two halves are connected. The 2D projections can look convex or concave. It has 12 vertices, 28 edges, and 18 faces (16 triangles and 2 rhombi) within D2h symmetry. These paired-cells stack more easily as inter-locking elements. Long sequences of these can be stacked together in 3 axes to fill space.Robert Reid, Anthony Steed Bowties: A Novel Class of Space Filling Polyhedron 2003 The 12 vertex coordinates in a 2-unit cube.
