    "text": "Guillem de Torroella (also written Torroelha) was a Majorcan poet whose family came from Empord\u00e0. He lived during the 14th century and it is thought he was born in 1348. He wrote the Patra\u00f1a around 1370. The Faula was reedited in 2007 in the Library of Majorcan Writers by Anna Mar\u00eda Compagna Perrone.\u00abGuillem de Torroella\u00bb. == La Faula == La Faula (The Tale) is a tale written by Guillem of Torroella, part of the Matter of Britain, which explains in first person how he was kidnapped and taken to the Enchanted Island by Morgan le Fay who, with the presence of Torroella, wants to end the invincible sadness of her brother, King Arthur. The presence of the foreigner comforts the king, who had fallen in a deep sadness over the decline of chivalry. King Arthur finally entrusts Torroella with a mission: go back to the real world and explain all he has seen. The story begins in the valley of S\u00f3ller in Majorca. Torroella arrives on horseback at the port of Santa Caterina, where he sees a parrot on a rock. Torroella decides to approach to bird but just at that moment the \"rock\", which in reality was a whale, carries him through the sea until he arrives at the Enchanted Island (Sicily, for many scholars) where his adventure begins and he meets an occitan-speaking serpent then the famous king Arthur. This book was a model for some later writers like Bernat Metge, Anselm Turmeda and Joanot Martorell. == References == == External links == * La Faula at RIALC * Guillemos Of Torroella: La Patra\u00f1a (fragments) * 2007 edition by Anna Maria Compagna Perrone Category:Spanish writers Category:14th-century Spanish writers Category:Writers of Arthurian literature Category:1348 births Category:Majorcan writers Category:Arthurian legend Category:14th-century people from the Kingdom of Aragon ",
