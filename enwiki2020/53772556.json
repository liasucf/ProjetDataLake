    "text": "Andrzej Cichocki from the RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako, Saitama, Japan was named Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in 2013 for contributions to applications of blind signal processing and artificial neural networks. According to Google Scholar Doctor Andrzej Cichocki has h-index 92 with more than 42000 citations. Doctor Andrzej Cichocki has been invited to the Council of Canadian Academies Survey of Science and Technology Strengths as an author of one of the top 1% most highly cited papers in his field worldwide. Dr. Andrzej Cichocki was a member of the editorial board (8 journals) and the reviewer (more than 10 journals) of leading world scientific journals (\"Journal of Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience\", \"IEEE Transaction on Neural Networks\", \"Methods in Neuroscience\", \"Neural Computation\", \"Neurocomputing\", \"Journal of Neural Networks\", etc.) and a member of many technical committees of international programs and conferences (\"IEEE Circuits and Systems Technical Committee for Blind Signal Processing\", \"Machine Learning for Signal Processing Technical Committee\", etc.). Dr. Andrzej Cichocki participated in the development of software packages: Independent Component Analysis LAB, Nonnegative Tensor Factorization LAB, Nonnegative Matrix Factorizations LAB and others. He also is the author of 6 patents. Doctor Andrzej Cichocki developed novel multi-way (tensor) and machine learning (ML) technologies for massive brain (and generally multi-modal biomedical) data analysis and for computational (neuro)science, that is modeling and simulations of complex mechanisms and phenomena. He developed novel algorithms and software for multiway component analysis, including multilinear Independent Component Analysis (ICA), non- negative matrix/tensor factorization (NMF/NTF), Smooth Component Analysis and Sparse Component Analysis (SCA), for tensor decomposition and tensor networks to simulate complex systems and process massive large-scale multidimensional data sets. Doctor Andrzej Cichocki also conducts research in the fields of Feature extraction, Dimensionality reduction, Classification and hierarchical clustering, Anomaly detection, Multiomadal data fusion, Very large scale optimization problems. He is engaged in practical applications related to brain\u2013computer interface (BCI), Human Robot Interactions (HRI), EEG hyper- scanning and their application for rehabilitation, learning and therapies. == References == Category:Fellow Members of the IEEE Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
