The first is government infrastructure projects, which are central for the cement industry. The second is the housing industry. In recent years, the construction industry has been thriving due to an increase in national and international investment to the extent that it is now the largest in the Middle East region. The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes, with huge amounts of idle money entering the housing market.Iran Daily \u2013 Domestic Economy \u2013 12/23/06 Iran Daily \u2013 Domestic Economy \u2013 04/09/07 Iran has three shopping malls among the largest shopping malls in the world. Iran Mall is the largest shopping mall in the world, located in Tehran. The annual turnover in the construction industry amounts to US$38.4 billion. The real estate sector contributed to 5% of GDP in 2008. Statistics from March 2004 to March 2005 put the number of total Iranian households at 15.1 million and the total number of dwelling units at 13.5 million, signifying a demand for at least 5.1 million dwelling units. Every year there is a need for 750,000 additional units as young couples embark on married life. At present, 2000 units are being built every day although this needs to increase to 2740 units. Iran's construction market will expand to $154.4 billion in 2016 from $88.7 billion in 2013.https://finance.yahoo.com/news/iran-could-big-deal- asian-040057087.html;_ylt=AwrC0CbZD7FVglMAW8GTmYlQ;_ylu=X3oDMTBya2hmZ3R1BGNvbG8DYmYxBHBvcwM2BHZ0aWQDBHNlYwNzYw-- ==History== For a decade after the revolution, the land question, especially in cities, was among the most contested issues in the Islamic Republic. The collapse of state authority, coupled with the populist convictions of the new regime and spontaneous popular land occupations labeled as \u201crevolutionary housing,\u201d led to the dramatic expansion of cities. Tehran doubled in size within two years, and Ahvaz tripled in area from . But only a small fraction of this geographic expansion was confiscated private land. The rest, more than 90 percent of the total distributed, had been public land. From 1979 to 1993 nearly half a million hectares of predominantly public unoccupied land was converted into private and cooperative residential property. New state institutions like the Urban Land Organization and the Housing Foundation played the key role in this massive transfer of property. By the mid-1980s more than 60 percent of all urban residential land transactions were being allocated by the state.About the Middle East Report | Middle East Research and Information Project . Merip.org. Retrieved on 2012-07-16. This large-scale transfer of mostly public land, coupled with the absence of enforceable regulation, transformed Iran\u2019s urban geography. Between 1979 and 1982, 75 percent of all new construction in Tehran occurred outside the formal city limits, where satellite villages were transformed into sprawling suburbs. Remarkably, by 1986 urban housing stock had doubled, as Housing Ministry surveys showed that more than half of all urban dwellings in the entire country had been built after the revolution. It was private individuals who built these 2.3 million new units. The state merely transferred the public land into private hands; its share of investment in housing construction (affordable or otherwise) was less than 2 percent of the total after the revolution.Kamal Athari, \u201cSanjesh dar andakhtan-e tarhi no-e,\u201d Goft-o-gu 39 (March 2004) and \u201cBakhsh-e maskan dar Iran, bazar ya barnameh?\u201d Iran Farda 7 (July 1993). Following an extraordinary boom in the Iranian real estate market between 2004 and 2007, activity in this market suddenly slowed down from early 2008. In 2009, construction activity was at its lowest level for the past eight years. Since 2010, this sector has experienced a modest recovery. ==Market== The Central Bank of Iran indicate that 70 percent of the Iranians own homes, with huge amounts of idle money entering the housing market. The housing industry is one of the few segments of the Iranian economy where state capital shares as little as two per cent of the market, and the remaining 98 per cent is private sector investment. There is little red tape or hurdles and, as a result, through launching mass development projects, the use of new technologies and fast-pace project execution, a larger portion of the housing market is accessible. This is also true for new construction materials and technological advances. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |+Average price and cyclic growth rate of 1 m\u00b2 of housing in metropolitan areas (1992\u20132007) in USD !

The average size of housing units has been around 80 square meters over the past five years. At present, the average price of a housing unit in urban areas is about 10 times the annual income of an urban household. Average construction cost for 1m\u00b2 of urban residential buildings in the first half of 2008 was $350 dollars. In January 2014, prices in Tehran were $1275 per square meter. In 2011, Iran implemented a national electronic system for the registration and tracking of real estate transactions in order to bring more transparency to the market (97% of real estate transactions and ownership changes have been recorded in the new system). ===Mehr Housing Scheme=== Mehr Housing project in Iran. Mehr project, designed in 2007, aimed to cover a part of house shortage through building of around 2 million housing units within 5 years.http://financialtribunedaily.com/articles/2014/09/13/economy-domestic- economy/427/gov%E2%80%99t-revise-housing-projects As of January 2011, the banking sector, particularly Bank Maskan has given loans up to 102 trillion rials ($10.2 billion) to applicants of Mehr housing project.No. 3870 | Domestic Economy | Page 4 . Irandaily. Retrieved on 2012-07-16. Under this scheme real estate developers are offered free lands in return for building cheap residential units for first-time buyers on 99-year lease contracts. The government then commissioned agent banks to offer loans to the real estate developers to prepare the lands and begin construction projects in an attempt to increase production and create equilibrium in the supply and demand curve (2008). Close to 400,000 units have been built and permits have been issued for another 12,000. Mehr Housing project is expected to provide 600,000 residential units in its first phase. About 3.7 million people have so far registered for Mehr Housing Plan (2008). About 10 million rials is to be paid by applicants for preparing the land and another 10 million to be given by the government in the form of banking facilities. Applicants should pay about 20 percent of the construction costs. In addition, about 140 million rials worth of housing loans will be granted to them (10,000 rials=1 USD in 2008). While most Iranians have difficulties obtaining small home loans, 90 persons have managed to secure collective facilities totaling $8 billion from banks.No Operation . Presstv.com.

Starting in 2014, the Mehr housing scheme will be taken off the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Iran. The government of President Rouhani announced that by 2017 the Mehr housing project will be replaced with cheap loans to needy families with the stated objective to build only 150,000 homes on a yearly basis. ===Restorations=== Restoration of old buildings is one of the priorities for the Government of Iran. Estimates show that about US$143 billion needs to be allocated in the next 10 years for restoration of 14,000 meters of critically decaying buildings. The government will earmark 11.5 percent of the funding while the rest will be supplied by public investment and bank loans (2007). The refurbishment of aged buildings nationwide has increased to $6.3 billion in 2010 from $3.3 billion in 2009.Iran boost credits to refurbish old buildings . tehran times. Retrieved on 2012-07-16. Another avenue for restoration in light of the new energy subsidy reform is to make housing more energy efficient in terms of heating. In addition, Iran\u2019s geographical position over a seismic belt necessitates the reinforcement and renovation of housing. This is possible only through a boom in real-estate development and foreign investment. The plan is to provide a number of 1.8 million loans over a period of 6 years (2014\u20132020) ranging between $7,500 and $18,700 each.http://www.turquoisepartners.com/iraninvestment/November%202014.pdf ===Real estate investment=== The housing sector plays an important role in the economy of Iran; it has links with 130 economic sectors, contributes to more than 20 percent of fixed capital formation each year, constitutes 25 percent of the balance of loans in the banking sector, 33 percent of household expenses are housing expenses, and the housing sector contributes around 12 percent of employment to the economy. In terms of investment, the domestic rival markets of real estate market are gold, car and the Iranian bourse. Construction is one of the most important sectors in Iran accounting for 20\u201350% of the total private investment. One of the prime investment targets of well off Iranians as tangible. In Iran, only government employees pay their fair share of income taxes and no one pays a capital gains tax, which has allowed the rich to \"squirrel away\" their speculative real estate gains abroad. Prices for imported goods have increased somewhat along with global inflation but prices of non-tradables have increased at a much faster rate (with Tehran's real estate prices increasing by about 1,500\u20132,000% [sic] over the last 10 years), resulting in a highly overvalued currency and damaging Iran's competitiveness.Asia Times Online :: Middle East News, Iraq, Iran current affairs .
