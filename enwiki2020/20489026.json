Several trails from the north, east, and south converge at Mount Naomi. The most traveled trail (approximately one way) is likely the one that starts at the Tony Grove Lake parking area just east of Naomi Peak. The road leading in to Tony Grove from U.S. Route 89 is entirely paved and easily accessible in the summer months. ==See also== * List of mountains in Utah ==References== ==External links== * Naomi Peak.
