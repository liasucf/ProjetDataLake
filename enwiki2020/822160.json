    "text": "Kolho is a village in the city-municipality of M\u00e4ntt\u00e4-Vilppula in Finland. During the Finnish Civil War, in winter 1918, the Finnish air force used Kolho as a base. Kolho has influenced a number of Finnish artists ranging from Eero J\u00e4rnefelt, Akseli Gallen-Kallela to Pentti Saarikoski and also was the site of the worst church boat accident in Finnish history. Kolho played a role in the rise of the Finnish paper industry together with the neighbouring M\u00e4ntt\u00e4 community. More recently Kolho is known for its natural environment and is a summer resort destination. James Vehko (aka Jalmari Vehkom\u00e4ki), the designer of the first Ford's metallic automobile chassis, was originally from Kolho. ==External links== * * Kolho Category:Villages in Finland Category:M\u00e4ntt\u00e4- Vilppula fi:Vilppula ",
