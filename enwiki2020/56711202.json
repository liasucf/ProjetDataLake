    "text": "\"Amorfoda\" is a song by Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny. It was released as a single by Rimas Entertainment on February 14, 2018. Bad Bunny co-wrote the song with Noah Assad, and its producers DJ Luian and Mambo Kingz. Eschewing Bad Bunny's Latin trap sound, \"Amorfoda\" is a piano ballad about regret in a relationship gone awry. The singer said it is about \"something almost everyone has experienced. Everyone has been in love\". Its title translates to \"Fuck Love\". ==Background== Bad Bunny wrote \"Amorfoda\" a long time before his rise to fame. In an interview for Billboard, he said: \"I've always loved this song because I wrote it with a lot of sentiment behind it. It's the kind of record that reminds me of the longevity of really good songs. A good song never gets old. It was just a matter of time, and it was time to come out with something different.\" The track's title arose when the singer was searching for a term in Portuguese to send love to the devil. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- !
