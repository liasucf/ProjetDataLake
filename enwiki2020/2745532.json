    "text": "Monmouth Park is a seasonal NJ Transit commuter rail station on the North Jersey Coast Line, located in Oceanport, New Jersey, and serving Monmouth Park Racetrack. Railway service to Monmouth Park can be traced as far back as 1892. There were two stations: a diesel-only terminal station, and an electric- compatible station. The diesel-only stop is closer to the entrance of Monmouth Park Racetrack where the special Pony Express service terminated, until the end of the 2005 racing season.The Monmouth Running Track (Abandoned Rails of New Jersey) That service was discontinued afterwards and so this area is no longer used as a train station (since filled over). During the 2007 Breeders Cup, the area where the single-track station is located served as a hospitality center/entrance. The mainline electrified station is located approximately from the track's main entrance on Port-Au-Peck Avenue. This station is served at least once an hour from approximately 10:30 a.m. until approximately 7 p.m. on Fridays and race days during the racing season. __NOTOC__ ==Station layout== The station has two low-level gravel surfaced side platforms serving trains in both directions. The northbound platform features bus shelter style protection from the elements along with some benches. The southbound platform features just benches. There are no ticket machines at this station. {|cellspacing=0 cellpadding=3 |- |style=\"border- top:solid 1px gray; border-bottom:solid 1px gray\" rowspan=5 width=75|Ground/ platform level |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 2px black;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |- |Track 1 |\u2190 toward Bay Head (Long Branch) |- |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"|Track 2 |style=\"border-top:solid 1px gray;\"| toward Hoboken or New York (Little Silver) \u2192 |- |style=\"border-top:solid 2px black;border-right:solid 2px black;border-left:solid 2px black;border-bottom:solid 1px gray;text- align:center;\" colspan=2|Side platform, doors will open on the right |} ==References== ==External links== * * Station from Port Au Peck Avenue from Google Maps Street View Category:Railway stations in Monmouth County, New Jersey Category:NJ Transit Rail Operations stations Category:Stations on the North Jersey Coast Line Category:Former New York and Long Branch Railroad stations ",
