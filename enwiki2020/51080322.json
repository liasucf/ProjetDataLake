Hardy, was released digitally on May 29, 2016. The album received positive mention in Broadway World. Hardy said the music was intended to \"reflect the period in history and to pay homage to L. Frank Baum\u2019s touching story\", using different musical genres.Dani Del Pico, ===Track listing=== ==Reception== New York Times critic Laura Collins-Hughes praised the 2015 production, especially for Hardy's music and for Ortiz's puppet design, while noting that the visual, nonverbal storytelling of the hour-long production was not always clear to the audience. Collins-Hughes found the 2016 production to be less rushed and \"more assured\", with an increased \"visual lushness\", but felt that \"mechanics get in the way of fantasy\" during part of the show. Variety's Marilyn Stasio cited the production's \"haunting beauty\", while Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter described the \"charming and disturbing\", minimalist production as the antithesis of Wicked, the massively successful big-budget Oz-based musical playing a block away. ==References== ==External links== *The Woodsman at Lortel Archives *Woodsmantheplay.com * Edward W.
