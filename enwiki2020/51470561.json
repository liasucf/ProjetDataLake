    "text": "The ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Championship is a professional wrestling championship owned by the Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion. The title was officially announced in a press release on August 30, 2016, and marked the first new title created by ROH in six years, following the 2010 creation of the ROH World Television Championship. ROH promoted the title as the first time in nearly 25 years that a major American promotion had had a six-man tag team title. The championship belts were redesigned in January 2018. Like most professional wrestling championships, the title is won as a result of a match with a predetermined outcome. There have been 10 reigns shared among 8 teams and 22 wrestlers. Mexa Squad (Bandido, Flamita, and Rey Horus are the current champions in their first reign both as a team and individually. They defeated Villain Enterprises (Brody King, Marty Scurll and PCO) at ROH's Saturday Night at Center Stage show on January 11, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia to win the titles. ==Championship tournament== The tournament to crown the inaugural ROH World Six-Man Tag Team Champions took place between September 30 and December 2. The tournament featured participants from the Mexican Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) and Japanese New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) promotions, both of which ROH had partnerships with. ROH noted how six-man tag team matches were a staple of Mexican lucha libre and how NJPW had recently created its own six-man tag team title, the NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship, which had first been won by a trio made up of NJPW wrestler Toru Yano and the ROH tag team The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe). Lio Rush was originally announced for the tournament, but ended up being replaced by NJPW wrestler Kushida. However, Rush eventually returned to the team, replacing ACH in the final due to his departure from ROH. The tournament started on September 30 at the All Star Extravaganza VIII pay-per-view (PPV), with the remaining first round and semifinal matches taking place at the October 1 and 29 tapings of the weekly Ring of Honor Wrestling program. The final of the tournament took place at the Final Battle PPV. ;Participants *ACH/Lio Rush, Jay White and Kushida *The Addiction (Christopher Daniels and Frankie Kazarian) and Kamaitachi *The Briscoes (Jay Briscoe and Mark Briscoe) and Toru Yano *Bullet Club (Adam Cole, Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) *The Cabinet (Caprice Coleman, Kenny King and Rhett Titus) *Jason Kincaid, Leon St. Giovanni and Shaheem Ali *The Kingdom (Matt Taven, TK O'Ryan and Vinny Marseglia) *Team CMLL (Hechicero, Okumura and \u00daltimo Guerrero) ==Reigns== ==Combined reigns== As of , .
