In 1909 graduated from the Working Man's College (now Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology) with the highest marks in Mechanical Engineering. He then undertook a 5-year apprenticeship with Anderson and Son, an engineering firm in Richmond, Melbourne. From February 1916 to June 1919 in World War I, he served in the Australian Flying Corps and, on loan, in the Royal Flying Corps, mostly in the Middle East.

In the early years of Qantas they constructed their own aircraft and Baird supervised the construction of seven DH-50 airliners and a DH-9. As Qantas grew, Baird became responsible for their engineering work at Archerfield Airport in Brisbane and the seaplanes at Rose Bay in Sydney. Baird assisted the Rev. John Flynn establish the Royal Flying Doctor Service in Queensland by modifying its first aircraft to be used as an air ambulance and to operate effectively in remote inland conditions. During World War II, when Japan invaded Singapore, Baird modifying Qantas's Catalina seaplanes to fly non-stop from Perth, Western Australia to Colombo, Ceylon (a flight of 3500 miles over open ocean). == Later life == Baird retired in June 1949, but continued as an adviser at Rose Bay.
