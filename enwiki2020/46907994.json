Long Beach State defeated USC in the final match, 3\u20131 (15\u20136, 15\u201311, 8\u201315, 15\u20138), to win their first national title. The 49ers (31\u20134) were coached by Ray Ratelle. This was a rematch of the previous year's final, won by USC. Long Beach State's Brent Hilliard was named the tournament's Most Outstanding Player. Hilliard, along with five other players, comprised the All-Tournament Team. ==Qualification== Until the creation of the NCAA Men's Division III Volleyball Championship in 2012, there was only a single national championship for men's volleyball. As such, all NCAA men's volleyball programs, whether from Division I, Division II, or Division III, were eligible. A total of 4 teams were invited to contest this championship. {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Team ! Appearance !
