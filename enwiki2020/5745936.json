Over 12 seasons, he played 278 games in La Liga, scoring 211 goals for Celta, Real Madrid and Deportivo. He won one Pichichi Trophy each with the first two clubs. ==Club career== Born in the neighbourhood of San Paio de Navia in Vigo, Province of Pontevedra, Pahi\u00f1o joined RC Celta de Vigo in 1943, immediately becoming a starter. He only scored four La Liga goals in his first season (from 15 appearances), being relegated. After the team's return to the top flight, Pahi\u00f1o never scored less than 15 times until his departure. In the 1947\u201348 campaign, his league-best 21 goals helped them finish a best-ever fourth and reach the final of the Copa del General\u00edsimo. In summer 1948, both Pahi\u00f1o and Miguel Mu\u00f1oz signed for Real Madrid. He continued to find the net at a regular rate for his new club, winning his second Pichichi at the end of 1951\u201352. However, he lost his importance in the squad following the arrival of Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano, who later admitted his frustration of never having played alongside him; across all competitions, he scored 124 goals in 143 matches, ranking 13th in the all- time scoring list at the time of his death. Until his retirement in 1957, at the age of 34, Pahi\u00f1o represented Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a (top division, three seasons) and Granada CF (Segunda Divisi\u00f3n). On 30 October 1955, whilst at the service of the former, he scored twice in a 2\u20131 win over his former employer at the Santiago Bernab\u00e9u Stadium. Over a fortnight in February 1956, Pahi\u00f1o acted as player-coach for Deportivo. The team conceded 12 goals in three games, which included losses against FC Barcelona (0\u20137, home) and Deportivo Alav\u00e9s (2\u20134). ==International career== Pahi\u00f1o earned three caps for Spain, over seven years. He scored on his debut on 20 June 1948, against Switzerland, adding a brace in his final appearance, a 2\u20132 draw with the Republic of Ireland in another friendly. ==Style of play== An ambidextrous player that excelled in the physical aspects of the game, Pahi\u00f1o possessed a powerful shot with either feet as well as a tremendous heading ability. In 1945, during a promotion play-offs clash against Granada, he played more than 40 minutes with a broken fibula after a challenge by Jos\u00e9 Mill\u00e1n, in an eventual 4\u20131 away win. ==Personal life== Pahi\u00f1o received his nickname after a variation of his father's second surname, Pa\u00ed\u00f1o. He was an avid reader of the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky and Leo Tolstoy. A half-time incident during the international with Switzerland, in which he sarcastically grinned as the team was being harangued by General G\u00f3mez Zamalloa, who was also vocal to the National Sports Delegation, may have led to the small number of appearances for his country. He died in the capital Madrid on 12 June 2012, aged 89. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! colspan=3 | Club performance ! colspan=2 | League ! colspan=2 | Cup ! colspan=2 | Continental ! colspan=2 | Total |- !
