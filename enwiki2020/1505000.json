    "text": "On a New Organic Base in the Coca Leaves is an 1860 dissertation written by Dr. Albert Niemann. Its title in German is \u00dcber eine neue organische Base in den Cocabl\u00e4ttern. The piece describes, in detail, how Niemann isolated cocaine, a crystalline alkaloid. It also earned Niemann his Ph.D. and is now in the British Library. He wrote of the alkaloid's \"colourless transparent prisms\" and said that, \"Its solutions have an alkaline reaction, a bitter taste, promote the flow of saliva and leave a peculiar numbness, followed by a sense of cold when applied to the tongue.\" Niemann named the alkaloid \"cocaine\" \u2014 as with other alkaloids its name carried the \"-ine\" suffix. ==External links== * Category:Cocaine Category:Theses Category:Works about cocaine ",
