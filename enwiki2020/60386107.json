The museum aims to materialize the memories of the Jamaican rhythm that conquered the state of Maranh\u00e3o. S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds is also considered the capital of reggae in Brazil, having received the nickname of Brazilian Jamaica. The city has more than 200 radiolas, a name given to sound teams formed by DJs and stereos with dozens of powerful amplifiers stacked. Several narratives seek to explain how reggae was incorporated into the local culture. According to some reports, since the 1970s, some people were able to capture short-wave Caribbean radio, due to geographical proximity. Later, tourists, emigrants and sailors of the port zone of the city also would influence in the introduction of the rhythm in the state. In the 80's and 90's, reggae shows spread throughout the outskirts of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds. In 1984, the first reggae radio program appeared and later the first local television programs, such as the Conex\u00e3o Jamaica, of the TV Difusora. Also appeared the first local bands, like the Tribo de Jah. The reggae played in S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds presented different characteristics in relation to Jamaican reggae, seeking a more romantic and sensual rhythm. The way of dancing is also typical of the region. Some researchers argue that the rhythm style is similar to local folk rhythms, such as bumba-meu-boi and Tambor de Crioula. Some songs are called \"mel\u00f4\" or \"pedra\" (stone, in Portuguese), when they become local successes. In the Historic Center of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds, there is a tourist tour in which a guide leads the visitors to places that represent the history of reggae in the city, with the presentation of dace . Reggae Square, in the Historic Center, also hosts musical attractions. In the first year of operation, the museum received 50 thousand visitors, of which 20 thousand were tourists. == Collection == Reggae Personality Panels The main goal of the architectural project was to honor Bob Marley, the greatest reggae icon in the world. The museum was painted in yellow, green and red. The Museum of Reggae of Maranh\u00e3o has five spaces. In the Hall of Immortals, the space seeks to honor the great names that have died of reggae in Maranhao. In the other four venues, the reggae clubs of S\u00e3o Lu\u00eds are honored: Pop Som Club, the Toque de Amor Club, the Uni\u00e3o do BF Club and the Espa\u00e7o Aberto Club. The audience may have contact with rare records, historical videos and photos, reggae fashion over time, and testimonials recorded with characters from the reggae scene. They also compose the collection and digitize books, articles, theses and dissertations, in the Library of Reggae, enabling a research, in addition to the museum cafe, Roots Caf\u00e9. The museum features relics of reggae, such as a guitar from the Maranhense band Tribo de Jah, used by the band in more than 20 countries, as part of the group's history, having been used in the main recordings of their songs and in national and international major concerts . It is present the radiola \"Voz de Ouro Canarinho\", by Edmilson Tom\u00e9 da Costa, better known as Serralheiro, who is one of the pioneers of reggae in Maranh\u00e3o, and popularizer of the musical genre in the 1970s. The space has structure for the realization of shows, musical festivals, meetings, workshops and dance classes. The museum seeks to enable its visitors to feel experienced at a reggae party in their spaces. == References == Category:Music museums Category:Bob Marley Category:Cultural centers in Brazil Category:Maranh\u00e3o ",
