The campaign sought to raise awareness of transphobic hate crimes by collecting and providing data to stakeholders such as An Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na. The first report was launched on 18 June 2014 at the University of Limerick. The report offered six recommendations: * Transphobic incidents should be logged on the PULSE (Police Using Leading Systems Effectively) system * Additional training should be provided for police officers * Conduct further research * Improve the relationship between the trans community and the police * Advocate for legislation to protect trans people * Educate the public about transphobia == National Transgender Healthcare Conference == On 3 December 2015, in partnership with the HSE, TENI co-hosted the first National Transgender Healthcare Conference in Carlow. The conference, which was attended by 380 healthcare professionals, sought to highlight issues that transgender people face accessing health services in Ireland. This conference led to the publication of the HSE's Health Report towards meeting the health care needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. == Gender Recognition Bill 2017 == In 2013 TENI supported the recommendation of the Social Protection Committee to lower the legal age for gender recognition from 18 to 16. This led to the passing of the Gender Recognition Act 2017. This Act amends the Gender Recognition Act 2015 in three ways: * Provide a right to self determination for persons who have reached the age of 16 years * Introduce a right to legal gender recognition for persons under the age of 16 years * Ensure consideration of the status of non-binary persons in Irish law 50px This article contains quotations from this source, which is available under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. == Strategy for Education and Skills 2016-18 == TENI made a submission on the Strategy for Education and Skills 2016-18 to improve the conditions and advance the rights of trans people and their families. == Publications == * Speaking from the Margins: Trans Mental Health and Wellbeing in Ireland * STAD: Stop Transphobia and Discrimination Report ==See also== * Transgender rights in Ireland ==References== Category:Transgender organizations Category:LGBT organisations in Ireland ",
