They currently play in the Gozo Football League Second Division. == History == St. Lawrence Spurs was established in 1968 and took part in three successive seasons which are 1968/69, 1969/70, 1970/71. After having participated in those seasons, the team had to stop because many players have migrated to Australia. In 1985, the team has been established over time along with the village of G\u0127arb and took part in the 1985/86 season. The years following G\u0127arb have formed their own team which was G\u0127arb Rangers FC. This led to a renaissance of St. Lawrence Spurs as an independent team. From the 1986/1987 season, St. Lawrence Spurs always competed in the tournament organized by the GFA, these years were years of disappointment, success and also hard work. == Honors == Second Division Gozo: :* Runners-up (2) : 1999-00, 2003-04 Second Division Cup: :* Winners (1) : 1992-93 2018-2019 :* Runners-up (5) : 1989-90, 1993-94, 2001-02, 2005-06, 2012-13 == References == ==External links== * St. Lawrence Spurs Official Website Category:Football clubs in Malta Category:Association football clubs established in 1968 Category:1968 establishments in Malta Category:San Lawrenz ",
