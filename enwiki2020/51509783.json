    "text": "Grevillea yorkrakinensis is a shrub of the genus Grevillea native to Western Australia. The low dense and spreading shrub typically grows to a height of and has non-glaucous branchlets. It has undissected, flat, linear leaves with a blade that is in length and wide. It blooms between May and October and produces an axillary raceme irregular inflorescence with orange or red flowers with green or pink styles. Later it forms ribbed or ridged, ovoid, simple hairy fruit that are long. The species was first formally described by the botanist Charles Austin Gardner in 1923 as part of the work Contributions to the flora of Western Australia as published in the Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Western Australia. The type specimen was collected by Gardner near Yorkrakine in 1922. The shrub is endemic to an area in the south eastern Wheatbelt and western Goldfields-Esperance regions of Western Australia where it is found on sandplains and often on or near granite outcrops where it grows in sandy, sandy-loam and sandy-clay soils often with gravel. It has a scattered distribution between Mount Gibson and Wubin in the north down to Hyden and Southern Cross in the south where it makes up part of shrubland or mallee heath communities. ==See also== * List of Grevillea species ==References== yorkrakinensis Category:Proteales of Australia Category:Eudicots of Western Australia Category:Plants described in 1923 Category:Taxa named by Charles Gardner ",
