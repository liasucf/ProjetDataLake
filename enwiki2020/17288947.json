    "text": "Japan is an album by the British band Japan, released in the United States in 1982 on the Epic Records label. It was the first U.S. release of the band's material recorded for Virgin Records in the U.K. (Obscure Alternatives, on Ariola Records, had already been released in the U.S.), and was a combination of most of Tin Drum with three tracks from Gentlemen Take Polaroids. Despite the group's popularity in Europe and Asia, and a cult following in the U.S., the album was not a chart success, and was released at a time when the band was beginning to break up. ==Track listing== All tracks written by David Sylvian unless otherwise noted === Side A === #\"The Art of Parties\" - 4:15 #\"Talking Drum\" - 3:30 #\"Ghosts\" (alternate edit) - 4:18 #\"Gentlemen Take Polaroids\" - 7:02 === Side B === #\"Still Life in Mobile Homes\" - 5:30 #\"Visions of China\" (Steve Jansen/David Sylvian) - 3:36 #\"Taking Islands in Africa\" (Steve Nye Remix) (Ryuichi Sakamoto/David Sylvian) - 4:51 #\"Swing\" - 6:18 #\"Cantonese Boy\" - 3:46 ==Personnel== * Richard Barbieri - keyboard instruments, programming, tape, synthetic bass track B3 * Steve Jansen - drums, percussion instruments, electronic percussion, keyboards (percussion), keyboards track B3 * Mick Karn - fretless bass, African flute, dida, African drum track B3, percussion track B3 * David Sylvian - guitar, keyboard instruments, programming, tape, vocals, additional keyboards track B3 * Simon House - violin * Yuka Fujii - vocals * Ryuichi Sakamoto - keyboards track B3 ==Production== * Japan - producers tracks: A1 to A3, B1 to B2, B5, remix track B3 * John Punter - producer, engineer tracks A4 & B4 * Steve Nye - engineer tracks: A1 to A3, B1 to B3, B5, remix track B3 * Renate - assistant engineer * Colin Fairley - engineer tracks A4 & B4 * Nigel Walker - engineer tracks A4 & B4 * Steve Prestage - engineer tracks A4 & B4 * John Berg - artwork, design * Fin Costello - photography * Mastered at Columbia NY.
