    "text": "Hans Wright (29 December 1854 - 3 December 1925) was a Danish architect. He served as city architect in Copenhagen from 1904 to 1925. ==Early life and education== Wright was born in Helsing\u00f8r, the son of ship-owner and major Albert Wright and Wigoline Jensine Margrethe Beck. He went to school in Gelsing\u00f8r and then moved to Copenhagen where he apprenticed as a carpenter and studied at Copenhagen Technical College until 1875. He then enrolled at the Roydal Danish Academy of Fine Arts from where he graduated as an architect in June 1881. ==Career== Wright initially worked for Hos H. Chr. Hansen, Vilhelm Friederichsenm Johannes Emil Gnudtzmann and Johan Daniel Herholdt. He worked for Copenhagen Municipality from 1884 and from 1886 under city architect Ludvig Fenger. He headed the department of building maintenance from 1899. When city architect Ludvig Fenger died in 1904, Ludvig Claussen, his intended successor, had recently died. Wright was therefore appointed as acting city architect. The appointment of a new city architect was delayed by the city's considerations about discontinuing the office to rely on private architects but these plans were abandoned and in 1907 Wright was appointed on a permanent basis. His work comprises large residential developments in N\u00f8rrebro and Vesterbro, public schools and bath houses, and technical installations. ==Personal life== Wright married Louise Gustave Dorothea Hildegard von Bauditz (1861-1935), a daughter of actuary and later hospital manager in Helsing\u00f8r Carl Adolph Valentin von B. and Elisabeth Jeanette Carlsen, on 1 May 1886 in Helsing\u00f8r. == List of works== ===Private practice=== * M.
