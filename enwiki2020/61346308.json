    "text": "The Jungle Bird is a tiki cocktail made with dark rum, Campari, simple syrup, pineapple juice, and lime juice, and garnished with a pineapple wedge (cut to resemble a bird's plumage), pineapple leaves, and a maraschino cherry. The New York Times notes that it is \"a natural for home bartenders, because it contains only five ingredients\". It was originally served in a ceramic bird container or a chilled hurricane glass. Punch notes, \"While not a usual suspect in many tiki drinks, Campari lends itself well to the modern American palate, which has adapted a hankering for all things bitter and boozy (case in point: the Negroni craze).\" The Spruce Eats notes, \"Usually reserved for dry dinner drinks like the Negroni, the bitter aperitif works surprisingly well in this mix\". According to one account, the Jungle Bird was created in 1978 at the Aviary bar of the Kuala Lumpur Hilton, where it was served as a welcome drink. ==Variants== New York bartender Giuseppe Gonzalez created a version that replaces dark Jamaica rum with the more intense blackstrap rum. The Aviary is a variant that uses tequila Cimarr\u00f3n. The Jungle Peacock, a mix of white rum, Malibu rum, red wine, Midori, Campari, pineapple juice, lime juice, and sugar, adds more alcohol. ==See also== * List of cocktails ==References== Category:Tiki drinks Category:Cocktails with dark rum Category:Cocktails with Campari Category:Cocktails with pineapple juice Category:Cocktails with lime juice ",
