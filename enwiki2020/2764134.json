    "text": "Cascade River State Park is a state park near the northeastern tip of Minnesota, USA. The park is in a rocky and rugged location where the Cascade River descends to meet Lake Superior. It has many different types of wildlife including various birds and mammals. Cascade River State Park is also connected to the Superior Hiking Trail. The site was originally named Cascade River State Wayside. It was developed by the Civilian Conservation Corps starting around July 1934. One of the projects was a huge overlook wall, built from locally quarried gabbro. The roadside development plans were drawn by Arthur R. Nichols and Harold E. Olson. The project was considered a model for roadside development. The development work was supervised and inspected not just by National Park Service employees, but also by members of the Minnesota Highway Department, staff of the Minneapolis Park Board, Civilian Conservation Corps individuals, members of the Minnesota Legislature, and some Canadian officials. The wayside was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 4, 2003. ==Gallery== Image:CascadeParkMN_arf.JPG|The Cascade River Image:CascadeParkMN_arf (3).JPG|The Cascade River Image:CascadeParkMN_arf (4).JPG|A rainbow over the Cascade River Image:CascadeParkMN_arf (5).JPG|A rainbow over the Cascade River Image:CascadeParkMN_arf (6).JPG|The Cascade River Image:CascadeParkMN_arf (8).JPG|Lake Superior just South of Cascade River State Park ==References== ==External links== * Cascade River State Park Category:1957 establishments in Minnesota Category:Park buildings and structures on the National Register of Historic Places in Minnesota Category:Protected areas established in 1957 Category:Protected areas of Cook County, Minnesota Category:State parks of Minnesota Category:National Register of Historic Places in Cook County, Minnesota ",
