Na'im was from Baghdad and lived in the second half of the 9th century. He was the son of Mu\u1e25ammad ibn M\u016bs\u0101 ibn Sh\u0101kir, the oldest of the three brothers Banu Musa. ==Collection of geometrical propositions== Although not regarded as a major mathematician, his treatise Collection of geometrical propositions was \"one of the first examples of a particular kind of mathematical treatises that became quite usual during the 10th century, and it reflects quite well 'the mathematical culture' of a 9th-century Baghdadi mathematician educated at Thabit ibn Qurra\u2019s school\". Only one copy of this work is known, preserved at the University Library of Istanbul. The treatise was edited and translated to French by Roshdi Rashed and Christian Houzel. == See also == * Banu Musa, his father and two uncles ==References== ==Sources== * Category:Mathematicians of medieval Islam Category:9th-century mathematicians Category:Medieval Iraqi mathematicians Category:People from Baghdad Category:9th-century people of the Abbasid Caliphate ",
