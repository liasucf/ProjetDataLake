However a re-run of the race was ordered by the International Paralympic Committee following protests by the Australian, US and Swiss teams after 6 competitors were involved in a crash on the penultimate lap. The re-run race resulted in the same three athletes winning medals but in a different order. \u2020\u2020 Rebecca Chin of Great Britain was originally awarded the silver medal in the women's discus throw F37-38 event. Following a challenge to her classification, Chin was deemed ineligible for the event, stripped of her medal, and her results were erased. * David Weir was initially awarded the gold medal in the men's 800 m T54 but a re-run of the race was ordered after a lane violation was discovered. However, following a letter from Kurt Fearnley and the Australian authorities to the IPC, asking that, in the spirit of sportsmanship, the result not be overturned the re-run was cancelled and the medals reinstated. == Boccia == {| |- | Individual BC1 | | | |- | Individual BC2 | | | |- | Individual BC3 | | | |- | Individual BC4 | | | |- | Team BC1-2 | Dan Bentley Nigel Murray Zoe Robinson David Smith | Joao Paulo Fernandes Fernando Ferreira Cristina Gon\u00e7alves Antonio Marques | Francisco Javier Beltr\u00e1n Pedro Cordero Manuel \u00c1ngel Mart\u00edn Jos\u00e9 Vaquerizo |- | Pairs BC3 | Ho-Won Jeong Keon-Woo Park Bo-Mee Shin | Yolanda Mart\u00edn Santiago Pesquera Jos\u00e9 Manuel Rodr\u00edguez | Armando Costa M\u00e1rio Peixoto Eunice Raimundo |- | Pairs BC4 | Dirceu Pinto Eliseu Santos | Fernando Pereira Bruno Valentim | Ladislav Kratina Radek Prochazka |} ==Cycling == === Road cycling === {| |- | Women's time trial B&VI; 1\u20133 | Karissa Whitsell Mackenzie Woodring | Iryna Fiadotava Alena Drazdova | Jayne Parsons Annaliisa Farrell |- | Women's time trial HC A/B/C | | | |- | Women's time trial LC 1\u20132/CP 4 | | | |- | Women's time trial LC 3\u20134/CP 3 | | | |- | Women's road race B&VI; 1\u20133 | Iryna Fiadotava Alena Drazdova | Karissa Whitsell Mackenzie Woodring | Genevieve Ouellet Mathilde Hupin |- | Women's road race HC A/B/C | | | |- | Men's time trial B&VI; 1\u20133 | Christian Venge David Llaurado | Alfred Stelleman Jaco Tettelaar | Krzysztof Kosikowski Artur Korc |- | Men's time trial CP 3 | | | |- | Men's time trial CP 4 | | | |- | Men's time trial HC A | | | |- | Men's time trial HC B | | | |- | Men's time trial HC C | | | |- | Men's time trial LC1 | | | |- | Men's time trial LC2 | | | |- | Men's time trial LC3 | | | |- | Men's time trial LC4 | | | |- | Men's road race B&VI; 1\u20133 | Andrzej Zajac Dariusz Flak | Jarmo Ollanketo Marko Tormanen | Olivier Donval John Saccomandi |- | Men's road race HC B | | | |- | Men's road race HC C | | | |- | Men's road race LC 1\u20132/CP 4 | | | |- | Men's road race LC 3\u20134/CP 3 | | | |- | Mixed time trial CP 1\u20132 | | | |- | Mixed road race CP 1\u20132 | | | |} === Track cycling === {| |- | Women's 500m time trial (LC1\u20132/CP 4) | | | |- | Women's 500m time trial (LC3\u20134/CP 3) | | | |- | Women's 1 km time trial (B&VI; 1\u20133) | Aileen McGlynn Ellen Hunter | Felicity Johnson Katie Parker | Lindy Hou Toireasa Gallagher |- | Women's Individual pursuit (B&VI; 1\u20133) | Aileen McGlynn Ellen Hunter | Lindy Hou Toireasa Gallagher | Karissa Whitsell Mackenzie Woodring |- | Women's Individual pursuit (LC 1\u20132/CP 4) | | | |- | Women's Individual pursuit (LC 3\u20134/CP 3) | | | |- | Men's 1 km time trial (B&VI; 1\u20133) | Anthony Kappes Barney Storey | Ben Demery Shaun Hopkins | Kieran Modra Tyson Lawrence |- | Men's 1 km time trial (CP 3) | | | |- | Men's 1 km time trial (CP 4) | | | |- | Men's 1 km time trial (LC 1) | | | |- | Men's 1 km time trial (LC 2) | | | |- | Men's 1 km time trial (LC 3\u20134) | | | |- | Men's Individual pursuit (B&VI; 1\u20133) | Kieran Modra Tyson Lawrence | Christian Venge David Llaurado | Bryce Lindores Steven George |- | Men's Individual pursuit (CP 3) | | | |- | Men's Individual pursuit (CP 4) | | | |- | Men's Individual pursuit (LC 1) | | | |- | Men's Individual pursuit (LC 2) | | | |- | Men's Individual pursuit (LC 3) | | | |- | Men's Individual pursuit (LC 4) | | | |- | Men's Sprint (B&VI; 1\u20133) | Anthony Kappes Barney Storey | Ben Demery Shaun Hopkins | Gavin Kilpatrick Michael Thomson |- | Men's Team sprint (LC1\u20134 CP3/4) | Darren Kenny Mark Bristow Jody Cundy | Kuidong Zhang Yuanchao Zheng Zhang Lu | Tomas Kvasnicka Jiri Bouska Jiri Jezek |} ==Equestrian == == Football five-a-side== == Football seven-a- side== ==Goalball == == Judo == == Powerlifting == ==Rowing== == Sailing == ==Shooting == == Swimming== ==Table tennis == == Volleyball == == Wheelchair basketball == == Wheelchair fencing == == Wheelchair rugby == ==Wheelchair tennis == == Medal leaders == Athletes that won at least two gold medals or at least three total medals are listed below. ==References== Medal winners 2008 Summer Paralympics medal winners 2008 Summer Paralympics medal winners 2008 Summer Paralympics medal winners * ",
