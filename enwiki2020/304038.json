    "text": "Joseph Gregory Randa (; born December 18, 1969) is a former Major League Baseball player. He was primarily a third baseman during his career. His nickname is \"The Joker\" due to his resemblance to the comic book character in Batman and his ever-present smile, especially during his plate appearances. It was given to him by Tony Muser, the Kansas City Royals manager during Randa's second tour with the ballclub. This had resulted from Muser having to constantly answer questions about why Randa was always smiling. \"I'd tell them that's not a smile, it's his normal look\", Muser explained.Spencer, Lyle. \"Padres acquire Randa from Reds\", MLB.com, Saturday, July 23, 2005 ==High school years== Randa attended Kettle Moraine High School in Wales, Wisconsin, lettering in football, basketball, baseball, and tennis.
