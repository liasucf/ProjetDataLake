    "text": "Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation is a 1962 American comedy film directed by Henry Koster and starring James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara. The film is based on the novel Mr. Hobbs' Vacation by Edward Streeter and features a popular singer of the time, Fabian. == Plot == Roger Hobbs is an overworked banker whose wife Peggy plans a quiet seaside vacation with their family, including the grown daughters, teenage daughter & son, family cook, sons-in-law and grandchildren. What he finds upon reaching their vacation destination is a very dilapidated beach house. Complications mount up. His teenage son Danny only wants to watch television. His youngest daughter Katey, embarrassed by a new set of dental braces, refuses to leave the beach house; and his grandchildren do not want to have anything to do with him. Furthermore, one of his sons-in-law, Stan, is unemployed and Mr. Hobbs must entertain Stan's snooty potential employer on a boring bird-watching jaunt. An older daughter is married to the aloof professor Byron, who has unorthodox ideas about both disciplining children and the family dynamic. One by one, Mr. Hobbs tries to solve each problem. After the television breaks, he finds time to take Danny on a boating trip, where they get very lost in the fog but bond as father and son. He also manages to take Katey to a dance, where he bribes a handsome young man named Joe to pay attention to her. The bird-watcher and his prim wife don't turn out to be what they seem to be and chaos reigns for a while. But in time Mr. Hobbs and his wife sort out everybody's personal crisis, Joe turns out to be a suitable suitor for Katey, and the family is almost sad to leave the beach and return home. == Cast == * James Stewart as Roger Hobbs * Maureen O'Hara as Peggy Hobbs * Fabian as Joe * Lauri Peters as Katey * Lili Gentle as Janie * John Saxon as Byron * John McGiver as Mr. Turner * Marie Wilson as Mrs. Turner * Reginald Gardiner as Reggie McHugh * Valerie Varda as Marika * Natalie Trundy as Susan * Josh Peine as Stan * Michael Burns as Danny Hobbs * Minerva Urecal as Brenda, Hobbs' maid * Richard Collier as Mr. Kagle * Peter Oliphant as Peter Carver (uncredited) == Production == Nunnally Johnson wrote the screenplay for Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation based on Edward Streeter's novel of the same name. Streeter had previously written the novel Father of the Bride, which was filmed in 1950 and remade in 1991. Johnson had just finished directing a series of films and wanted to focus on writing. He agreed to do Hobbs because he liked the story \"and I knew something about it.\"Johnson p 134 Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation was filmed in California at Laguna Beach and Dana Point. The film was shot using CinemaScope wide screen formatting, with color by DeLuxe. It marked the first time James Stewart and Maureen O'Hara starred together in a film. They would co-star again in the 1966 western The Rare Breed. During the scene where Mr. Hobbs escorts his daughter Katey to a dance at the yacht club, Herb Alpert is the trumpet player in the band. The movie was the first of two James Stewart made with Fabian. \"If anybody\u2019s ever blessed, you have to be blessed to work with Jimmy Stewart,\" recalled Fabian. \"He was the most congenial, helpful person I ever worked with.\"Jack Neary, \"Interview with Fabian\" accessed 18 January 2014 It was a rare comedy role for John Saxon. == Reception == The film was relatively successful in the United States and Canada upon its release on June 15, 1962, earning $4 million with an estimated budget of $2 million, but found even greater success when released overseas. James Stewart won the Silver Bear for Best Actor at the 12th Berlin International Film Festival for his performance, and director Henry Koster was nominated for Best Director. Stewart was nominated for a Golden Globe as Best Actor in a Musical/Comedy. The screenplay by Nunnally Johnson was nominated for Best Written Comedy by the Writers Guild of America. Stewart and Maureen O'Hara were also nominated for their performances by the Laurel Awards. Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation's success inspired a series of light-hearted family comedies written by Johnson. Two of these also starred Stewart and were directed by Koster: Take Her, She's Mine (1963) and Dear Brigitte (1965).Johnson p 136 This was the final feature film for actress Marie Wilson. ===Critical reaction=== Bosley Crowther of The New York Times writes in his review: \"EDWARD STREETER'S genial thesis that the family unit is perhaps the most anomalous and irritating social arrangement ever devised by so-called civilized man is given amusing illustration in Jerry Wald's film version of \"Mr. Hobbs Takes a Vacation,\" which arrived at the Paramount yesterday. Right off the bat it is suggested in this wacky domestic report that togetherness is strictly for the birds and that sensible parents, especially elders, should write it out of their books. The Mr. Hobbs of the title, played beguilingly by James Stewart, is very much of this opinion as far as his own brood is concerned.\" ==References== ===Sources=== * * ==External links== * * * * Category:1962 films Category:1962 comedy films Category:20th Century Fox films Category:American comedy films Category:American films Category:English-language films Category:Films scored by Henry Mancini Category:Films about families Category:Films about vacationing Category:Films based on American novels Category:Films directed by Henry Koster Category:Films set in California Category:Films set on beaches Category:Films with screenplays by Nunnally Johnson Category:Beach party films ",
