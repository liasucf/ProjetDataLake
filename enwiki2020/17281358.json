The song was written by the duo along with Don Cook. ==Content== The male narrator explains to his significant other that she has constantly been mistreating him, and although he still shows great affection for her, he ultimately comes to the realization that their relationship is in serious jeopardy because of her actions and therefore contemplates ending the relationship for good. Beforehand, the narrator presents his soon-to-be former lover an opportunity to give him a farewell kiss, informing her that she will regret the mistakes that she had made and will miss him after he leaves her. ==Critical reception== Billboard's Eric Boehler praised the craftsmanship and production of the song, simply calling it \"another welcome Brooks & Dunn outing.\"Boehlert, Eric. \"The modern age.\" Billboard 13 May 1995: JuniorQuest Magazines, ProQuest.
