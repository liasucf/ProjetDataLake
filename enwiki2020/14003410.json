    "text": "Swedish brand Craft is a producer of functional sports apparel. The company is based in Bor\u00e5s, an old, traditional textile industry town in the South of Sweden. The initial concept of founder Anders Bengtsson was to develop underwear, which propels moisture away from the skin during physical activity. Craft started with technical baselayers and soon developed the three-layer principle with a 2nd layer of insulation and moisture transportation and an outer shell for protection. Today, the company offers gear for all kinds of sports focusing with layer 3 on running, triathlon, bike and cross-country skiing. == History == In 1973, Swede Anders Bengtsson started developing a baselayer material that transports moisture (sweat) away from the skin. Bengtsson tested his designs by weighing his gear after exercise sessions. He used polyester fibres, which only absorb a minimum of moisture and worked them in a special weaving construction. The so-called capillary action further promotes moisture expulsion transporting sweat from the skin to the outer surface of the garment where it quickly evaporates. The brand Craft of Sweden was officially founded in 1977. In addition to technical baselayers, the company soon started producing second layer garments (focusing on fleece material) and outerwear. == Company takeovers == New Wave Group acquired the brand in 1996. ==Sponsorships== Craft is the official supplier and sponsor of numerous association football teams, players and associations, including: ===Associations=== * 2016 ConIFA Football World Cup ===Club teams=== ====Europe==== * Gent * Helsing\u00f8r * Frem * PS Kemi * Darmstadt 98 * Dynamo Dresden * SC Cambuur * Zwolle * Hammarby * IFK G\u00f6teborg * Trelleborgs FF * Varbergs BoIS * Luzern ===Handball=== ====National teams==== * (Men) (since July 2019) * (Women) (since July 2019) ====Club teams==== * Odense H\u00e5ndbold (since July 2019) ===Ski=== * Sweden (Men) (since January 2019) * Sweden (Women) (since January 2019) ===Volleball=== ====Club teams==== * DSC Volleyball Damen (Women) (since July 2019) The Craft athlete team includes several national teams, among them the Swedish National XC-Team, Swedish and- Norwegian Track & Field team, as well as individual athletes such as Marit Bj\u00f6rgen, Charlotte Kalla, Rene Poulsen, and Kaisa M\u00e4k\u00e4r\u00e4inen Craft also supply bicycle specific apparel to the Orica-BikeExchange professional cycling team.
