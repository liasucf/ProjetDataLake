Jones began singing gospel as a child with her sisters, Brenda and Valorie, and her mother Mary Frazier Jones. Shirley and her sisters eventually began singing secular music as The Jones Girls, and in 1976 became background singers for Diana Ross. In 1979, they signed with Philadelphia International Records, and enjoyed a string of hit singles in the first half of the 1980s. After the group disbanded in 1984, Jones was offered a solo contract with Philadelphia International, and released a hit single, \"Do You Get Enough Love\". A full-length album followed. Soon after the success of the single, Jones married Harlem Globetrotters player Harold Hubbard.Shirley Jones biography, Allmusic One more full-length album followed in 1994. ==Discography== ;Albums *Always in the Mood (Philadelphia International Records, 1986) U.S. #128, U.S. R&B; #8Charts, Allmusic *With You (Diverse Records, 1994) ;Singles *\"Do You Get Enough Love\" (1986) U.S. R&B; #1 *\"Last Night I Needed Somebody\" (1986) U.S. R&B; #36 *\"She Knew About Me\" (1987) U.S. R&B; #80 ==References== Category:American female singers Category:1953 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Detroit ",
