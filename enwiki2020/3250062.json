    "text": "\"Pow R. Toc H.\" is an instrumental, with vocal effects, by Pink Floyd on their 1967 album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn. In addition to the vocal effects, the piano is a prominent instrument in the piece. ==Background== Toc H. was the army signallers' code for \"TH\", representing Talbot House, a club where officers and enlisted men were equals. It later became an interdenominational Christian fellowship organization serving the community. According to Nick Mason, the original four members of Pink Floyd (Syd Barrett, Roger Waters, Richard Wright and Mason) were present at Abbey Road Studios and watched the Beatles record \"Lovely Rita\" from Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. Voice effects and noises similar to those used in \"Lovely Rita\" could be heard in \"Pow R. Toc H.\", recorded in the next studio during the same period. In the song, Syd Barrett displays an early example of beatboxing. Roger Waters also uses the \"scream\" he later used in \"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\". ==Alternative and live versions== \"Pow R. Toc H.\" was renamed \"The Pink Jungle\" in the \"Journey\" part of The Man and The Journey. Pink Floyd performed the song live from 1967 to 1969. ==Personnel== * Syd Barrett \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitars, vocal percussion * Roger Waters \u2013 bass guitar, screams * Richard Wright \u2013 Farfisa organ, piano, additional vocalisations * Nick Mason \u2013 drums, percussion ==References== Category:Pink Floyd songs Category:1967 songs Category:Songs written by Syd Barrett Category:Songs written by Nick Mason Category:Songs written by Richard Wright (musician) Category:Songs written by Roger Waters Category:1960s instrumentals ",
