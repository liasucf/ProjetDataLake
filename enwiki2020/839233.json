ISKCON Moscow Ratha Yatra Hinduism has been spread in Russia primarily due to the work of scholars from the religious organization International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON) and by itinerant Swamis from India and small communities of Indian immigrants. While ISKCON and Brahma Kumaris appear to have a relatively strong following in Russia, the other organizations in the list have a marginal presence in this country. There is an active Tantra Sangha operating in Russia. According to a 2010 religious census, there are 240,000 Hindus in Russia, which account for 0.1% population of Russia.Arena - Atlas of Religions and Nationalities in Russia.

The Human rights publication list to free Hare Krishnas in Soviet The history of Hinduism in Russia dates back to at least the 16th century. When Astrakhan was conquested in 1556, the small Indian community became part of the Moscow state. In the early 18th century, Peter the Great, the first Russian Emperor, met Astrakhan Hindus and on their request asked the Russian Senate to issue a law for protecting the beliefs of Hindus. This was the first law in Russia to protect foreign religion. In 1971 A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, the founder of the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), introduced it to Russia. In 1988, ISKCON was first registered as a religion. Later, it was re-registered in 1998. In the same year, there were 120 Krishna communities in Russia. In 2007, the ancient idol of Vishnu was excavated in the Volga region which fueled the interest for Hinduism in Russia. ==Hindu denominations in Russia== Russian Hindus celebrating Rath Yatra.

Slavic Vedism involves the use of Vedic rituals and worship of ancient Vedic deities, distinguishing from other groups which have maintained a stronger bond with modern Indian Hinduism, although Krishnaite groups often identify themselves as \"Vedic\" too. Also some syncretic groups within the Slavic Native Faith (\"Rodnovery\") such as Peterburgian Vedism use the term \"Vedism\"Robert A. Saunders, Vlad Strukov.

In 2006, the Russian capital Moscow has an estimated 10,000 Hare Krishna devotees and at least 5,000 Indians, Sri Lankans, Nepalese, and Mauritians following Hindu denominations. The number of ISKCON followers in Russia is disputed. According to the Sanjeet Jha of the Association of Indians of Russia, Russia's Krishna population is estimated to be as high as 250,000, while Filatov of the Institute of Oriental Studies estimates Russia's Krishna population to be 15,000. According to Bhakti Vijnana Goswami, a Russian Iskcon guru, there were 50,000 active Hare Krishna devotees in Russia in 2011. ==Prominent Russian Hindus== *Indra Devi, Russian yoga teacher *Yekaterina Lisina, Russian basketball player who competed for the Russian National Team at the 2008 Summer Olympics *Sati kazanova, Russian singer ==See also== * Bhagavad Gita trial in Russia * Hindu Council of Russia * Hinduism by country * Religion in Russia ==References== ==Sources== * * \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0443\u0438\u0437\u043c // \u0421\u043e\u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0433\u0438\u043e\u0437\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0436\u0438\u0437\u043d\u044c \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438. \u041e\u043f\u044b\u0442 \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f / \u041e\u0442\u0432. \u0440\u0435\u0434. \u041c. \u0411\u0443\u0440\u0434\u043e, \u0421. \u0411. \u0424\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043e\u0432. \u2014 \u041c.: \u041b\u043e\u0433\u043e\u0441, 2005. \u2014 \u0422. 3. \u2014 \u0421. 335\u2014454. \u2014 464 \u0441. \u2014 * \u041a\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d, \u0418. \u042e. \u0418\u043d\u0434\u0438\u0439\u0446\u044b \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438=Indians in Russia. \u2014 \u0421\u0430\u0430\u0440\u0431\u0440\u044e\u043a\u0435\u043d: LAP, 2011. \u2014 97 p. ==External links== * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * Collection of Mysteries Monastery - Slavic Vedism Russia Russia ",
