    "text": "Malanjkhand also referred to as MCP (acronym for Malanjkhand Copper Project) is an open-pit copper mine in India, located near the town of Malanjkhand, northeast of Balaghat in Madhya Pradesh, at an altitude of 576 MRL. It falls in the tehsil of Baihar, which is from the project, on the way to Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh State.It is located nearby to Kanha National Park.It is the largest base metal mine in India. Closepet series of the Dharwarian formation is prominent there. It is the main source of copper to Malanjkhand Copper plant functioning there. Besides copper, quartzite, copper pyrite and magniferous rocks are other important minerals sources found in Malanjkhand. The place is home of about 10,000 people. MCP though small place have communities i.e. social communities from all parts of India that is Maharashtra,Bengal,Kerala,Andhra, Bihar, etc. and they have their groups which are more popularly referred to as Samaj. == Malanjkhand Copper Project == Malanjkhand Copper Project was inaugurated by Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi in 1980 and Hindustan Copper Limited started to exploit the copper ore through open pit mining. Geological Survey of India took systematic geological exploration at this deposit during 1969. Mining lease of the ore was granted to Hindustan Copper Limited in 1973. With advancement of time this project was enhanced with viable operational developments. It is the largest open cast mining in Asia. This area is the result of many cycles of erosion on the gneiss base during the Amgaon orogeny. Although it provided employment to many villages which would have been impossible otherwise, locals were not skilled enough to be employed at the mine so they feel cheated and that justice hasn't been done to them. The leftover of the refining process, called tailing, ends up in the fields of these villagers, hurting their crops and cattle. At present besides the open-pit mine and concentrator plant the project has also been provided with auxiliary facilities such as Tailings Disposal and Water Reclamation System, repair shops, Maintenance Garage, Water Treatment Plant, Warehouses, Fuelling Stations, 132 kV power sub-station, Waste Treatment Facilities and township with modern amenities.
