    "text": "The Guatuso are a tribe of American Indians of Costa Rica. Their language may also be known as Maleku, which is spoken in the north-central part of the country, and is a Chibchan language. The 1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica describes them as an active, hardy people, who have always maintained hostility towards the Spaniards and retain their independence, and their language indicates that they are a distinct stock. They were described by old writers as being very fair, with flaxen hair, and these reports led to a belief, since exploded, that they were European hybrids. As of 1911, there were very few surviving. ==References== Category:Ethnic groups in Costa Rica Category:Indigenous peoples of Central America ",
