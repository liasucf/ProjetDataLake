    "text": "Tyler Kali Yates (born August 7, 1977) is a former Major League Baseball right-handed pitcher. ==Career== ===Oakland Athletics/New York Mets=== Yates attended the University of Hawaii at Hilo before being drafted by the Oakland Athletics in the 23rd round of the 1998 Major League Baseball Draft. He spent most of seven seasons in the Athletics and New York Mets' minor league organizations, before pitching in the majors in 2004 and managing a high 6.36 earned run average. Further experience was limited by Tommy John surgery in 2002 and rotator cuff surgery that wiped out his entire 2005 season. He was used as a relief pitcher in the Athletics farm system, but the Mets attempted to make him a starting pitcher following his 2002 surgery. Yates recorded the first save of his career on July 14, 2006, in a 15-12 extra-inning win over the San Diego Padres. ===Atlanta Braves/Pittsburgh Pirates=== Yates was traded by the Atlanta Braves to the Pittsburgh Pirates on March 26, 2008, in exchange for minor league pitcher Todd Redmond. In 2008, he was better than in 2007 with an ERA of 4.66. Yates missed the second half of the 2009 season after having a second Tommy John procedure, performed by Dr. James Andrews, in July. He was re-signed to a minor league deal on January 4, 2010. Yates also received an invite to spring training. ==Personal== His brother, Kirby Yates, currently plays for the San Diego Padres.Brothers in arms ==References== ==External links== *\"Yates to Speak at UH-Hilo Fundraiser\" Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:New York Mets players Category:Atlanta Braves players Category:Pittsburgh Pirates players Category:Arizona League Athletics players Category:Southern Oregon Timberjacks players Category:Visalia Oaks players Category:Modesto A's players Category:Midland RockHounds players Category:Sacramento River Cats players Category:Norfolk Tides players Category:St. Lucie Mets players Category:Binghamton Mets players Category:Richmond Braves players Category:Hawaii\u2013Hilo Vulcans baseball players Category:Baseball players from Hawaii Category:People from Kauai County, Hawaii Category:1977 births Category:Living people ",
