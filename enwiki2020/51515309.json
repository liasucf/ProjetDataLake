He made his senior debut for the farm team CD Basconia in 2008, in Tercera Divisi\u00f3n. On 29 June 2010, after being promoted to the reserves in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B, Fern\u00e1ndez was called up to the first team for the pre-season as a backup to Gorka Iraizoz and Ra\u00fal Fern\u00e1ndez. However, he only appeared in 19 matches for the former during the season, mainly due to a hand injury which kept him out for two months, and struggled even more in 2011\u201312, again due to injuries, being overtaken by new signing Jon Ander Serantes. On 22 July 2012, Fern\u00e1ndez was loaned to fellow league side Barakaldo CF for one year, but had his contract with the Lions terminated on 28 January 2013. He signed a two-and-a-half-year deal with Villarreal CF a day later, being assigned to the B team also in the third level. ===Numancia=== On 6 July 2016, Fern\u00e1ndez joined Segunda Divisi\u00f3n club CD Numancia on a two-year contract. He made his professional debut on 4 September 2016, starting in a 1\u20131 away draw against AD Alcorc\u00f3n. Initially a backup to Munir, Fern\u00e1ndez profited from national call-ups and became a regular starter, holding that position until the end of the campaign. On 27 February 2017, he extended his link until 2020. ===Levante=== On 23 July 2018, Fern\u00e1ndez agreed to a four- year contract with La Liga side Levante UD. His maiden appearance in the competition took place on 2 February 2019, in a 0\u20130 home draw to Getafe CF. In November 2019, it was announced that Fern\u00e1ndez might miss Levante's next match as he had been called by his local town to work at a polling station for the Spanish general election, however he was later excused from this. He signed a new deal until 2023 the same month, the new release clause being set at \u20ac30 million. ==International career== Fern\u00e1ndez made his debut for the unofficial Basque Country national team on 30 May 2019, in a 0\u20130 draw away to Panama for which a small, youthful and inexperienced squad was selected. ==Honours== Spain U19 *UEFA European Under-19 Championship runner-up: 2010 ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1991 births Category:Living people Category:People from Mondrag\u00f3n Category:Sportspeople from Gipuzkoa Category:Spanish footballers Category:Basque footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:CD Basconia footballers Category:Bilbao Athletic footballers Category:Villarreal CF B players Category:CD Numancia players Category:Levante UD footballers Category:Spain youth international footballers Category:Basque Country international footballers ",
