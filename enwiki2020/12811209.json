    "text": "Jos\u00e9 Norberto Francisco Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio, O.F.M., (June 6, 1804 \u2013 November 2, 1875) was a Roman Catholic friar prominent in the early history of California. His life encompassed the transition from Spanish colonial, to Mexican, and finally, American society. == Early life == Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio was born in Guadalajara, New Spain, on June 6, 1804. His Spanish-born parents were Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio and Manuela Guti\u00e9rrez. He had at least two siblings. Upon completing his primary education, Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio studied at the Seminario Conciliar of Guadalajara. He continued at the University of Guadalajara, where he graduated on July 20, 1820, with a degree in philosophy. In 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. In 1824, he applied to the Colegio de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Zapopan, seeking admission to the Franciscan Order. He began his novitiate and was accepted into the Order on January 10, 1825 with the religious name \"Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda de Jes\u00fas\" and the title of Fray (Friar). == Missions in California == On February 13, 1833, Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio was named to replace Father Narciso Dur\u00e1n at the Mission San Jos\u00e9 in California, consistent with a policy of replacing Spanish-born clergy with those born in Mexico. He arrived at the Mission two months later to begin his new duties. During his tenure, the Mexican government began to implement a policy to secularize the California missions. In 1842, Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio was transferred to the Mission Santa Barbara, eventually becoming its chief administrator. He served as the Apostolic administrator of the Diocese of the Two Californias after Bishop Francisco Garcia Diego y Moreno's death in 1846 until bishop Joseph Alemany's appointment as Bishop of Monterey in 1850. Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio continued to serve as the administrator of Mission Santa Barbara and came into conflict with the presiding bishop of the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles, Bishop Thaddeus Amat, over the question of jurisdiction over the Mission. Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio argued that the Mission was rightfully under the Franciscan order, not the diocese. During the dispute, the United States annexed California as a result of the Mexican American War. On March 18, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln restored the California missions to the Catholic Church. The deed to Mission Santa Barbara was given to the diocese, not the Franciscans. Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio protested, but Bishop Amat refused to give up the deed to the Mission. However, in 1925, Bishop John J. Cantwell handed the deed over to the Franciscans at Mission Santa Barbara. ==Death== Having lived long enough to become the oldest survivor of the early California missionaries, he died on November 2, 1875 at Mission Santa Barbara, where he is interred. ==References== *Hispanic Catholicism in transitional California: the life of Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez Rubio, O.F.M.
