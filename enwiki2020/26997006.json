It was completed in 1301 during the rule of the Zakarid dynasty. It was built and completed as an alternative church of the nearby ruined Katoghike Church, a large three-nave basilica dating back to the 5th and 6th centuries. == Architecture == The Holy Mother of God Church is a small cruciform central-plan interior with a rectangular but almost square plan exterior and a second floor. Centered above is a single cylindrical drum and a conical umbrella type dome. The drum is made up of twelve columns with arches that support the weight of the dome. The second floor has a semi-cruciform layout with single small windows to the left and rear fa\u00e7ades, while on the right is a larger window with a single column that stands in the middle. A small inset portal sits in the middle of the front fa\u00e7ade, with the remnants of exterior stone steps that once led to the second floor. The first floor has a single large portal at the front fa\u00e7ade with a semi-circular lintel and decorative columns, while the left, right, and rear fa\u00e7ades each have a small window. The left and right are surrounded by a large intricately carved cross in high-relief. Exceptionally rich decorations cover a large portion of the church. There are beautiful motifs on each side at the second floor level and geometric patterns around the cornices, eaves, and other parts of the walls. Notable is the large cross carved in high relief on the front flanked by the Virgin Mary holding the baby Jesus and another saint. Below and just above the portal to the second floor are the motifs of a bull and lion. Above the larger window on the right fa\u00e7ade is a motif of a large bird with a geometric rosette on its chest holding a hooved animal in its talons. On the left fa\u00e7ade is a mountain goat, and on the rear is a large cat pouncing upon a goat. Adjacent to the church are the remains of a chapel foundation. Khachkars and graves are nearby. == Gallery == File:Yeghvard- Church-View.jpg|Yeghvard Church View, Yeghvard, Armenia Image:Yeghvard Church Front.JPG|Front fa\u00e7ade.
