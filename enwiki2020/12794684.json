    "text": "James Walter \"Jock\" Robertson (21 February 1898 \u2013 29 December 1970) was an English association footballer who played professionally for Gillingham. He joined the club while it was still playing non-league football and went on to set a club record for the most matches played in the Football League, making over 350 appearances. ==Career== Robertson was born in Chatham and shortly after the First World War played for local team Chatham Centrals. Upon his demobilisation from the Army in November 1919 he signed for professional club Gillingham, at the time playing in the Southern League, but had to wait until the following April to make his debut for the team, which came in an away match against Southend United. He played in seven of the team's final eight matches of the season. At the end of the 1919\u201320 season, the Southern League Division One was absorbed into the Football League to form the new Third Division, and Robertson played in the club's first ever Football League match against Southampton on 28 August 1920. Over the next thirteen seasons he made over 350 Football League appearances, a club record which stood for over 30 years. At the end of the 1932\u201333 season he left Priestfield Stadium to join non-league club Canterbury Waverley. Details of his career beyond that point are unknown. He died in Rochester in 1970. ==Career statistics== {|border=1 cellpadding=4 cellspacing=2 style=\"background: ivory; font-size: 95%; border: 1px #aaaaaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; clear:center\" |+ Club performance |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|Southern League Division One !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\" align=center valign=top|Gillingham |1919\u201320 |align=\"center\"|7 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|7 |align=\"center\"|0 |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|Football League Third Division !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"1\" align=center valign=top|Gillingham |1920\u201321 |align=\"center\"|41 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|3 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|44 |align=\"center\"|0 |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"2\"|Football League Third Division South !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"12\" align=center valign=top|Gillingham |1921\u201322 |align=\"center\"|27 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|29 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1922\u201323 |align=\"center\"|35 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|37 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1923\u201324 |align=\"center\"|28 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|4 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|32 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1924\u201325 |align=\"center\"|38 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|7 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|45 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1925\u201326 |align=\"center\"|42 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|44 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1926\u201327 |align=\"center\"|36 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|4 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|40 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1927\u201328 |align=\"center\"|30 |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|3 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|33 |align=\"center\"|1 |- |1928\u201329 |align=\"center\"|32 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|34 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1929\u201330 |align=\"center\"|30 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|31 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1930\u201331 |align=\"center\"|16 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|16 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1931\u201332 |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|2 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |1932\u201333 |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|0 |- |colspan=2|Career totals |align=\"center\"|365 |align=\"center\"|1 |align=\"center\"|30 |align=\"center\"|0 |align=\"center\"|395 |align=\"center\"|1 |} ==References== Category:1898 births Category:1970 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Chatham, Kent Category:Footballers from Kent Category:English footballers Category:Gillingham F.C. players Category:Canterbury Waverley F.C. players Category:Southern Football League players Category:English Football League players Category:Association football defenders ",
