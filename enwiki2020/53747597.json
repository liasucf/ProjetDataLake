    "text": "\"God\" (stylized as \"GOD.\") is a song by American rapper Kendrick Lamar, from his fourth studio album Damn, released on April 14, 2017. The thirteenth and penultimate track on the album (second on the Collector's Edition of Damn), the song was produced by Riera, Sounwave, DJ Dahi, B\u00ebkon, Cardo, Tiffith, with additional production by Yung Exclusive, Mike Hector and Teddy Walton. The song details Lamar's successes, how it feels, and why he works so hard to get to where he is today. The song also finds Lamar declaring his faux-divinity as a rap god. == Background == Before the release of Damn, the album itself was rumored to be centered around God. It was soon confirmed by Lamar himself. Lamar has been a devout Christian since approximately his late teen years or adolescence. == Lyrics == According to Jake Woolf of GQ magazine, Lamar trolls Canadian musician and rapper Drake by imitating his singing voice on the song's chorus. == Live performances == Lamar performed \"God\" live at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 23, 2017. Lamar has performed \"God\" at every show as an encore on the Damn tour. == Credits and personnel == Credits adapted from the official Damn digital booklet. *Kendrick Lamar \u2013 songwriter *Ricci Riera \u2013 songwriter, producer *Mark Spears \u2013 songwriter, producer *Dacoury Natche \u2013 songwriter, producer *Daniel Tannenbaum \u2013 songwriter *B\u0113kon \u2013 producer, additional vocals *Ronald LaTour \u2013 songwriter, producer *Anthony Tiffith \u2013 songwriter, producer *Mike Hector \u2013 additional drums *Derek Ali \u2013 mixing *Tyler Page \u2013 mix assistant *Cyrus Taghipour \u2013 mix assistant == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Ireland (IRMA) | 57 |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| Sweden Heatseeker (Sverigetopplistan) | 9 |- |- |- |} ==Certifications== == References == == External links == * Category:2017 songs Category:Kendrick Lamar songs Category:Songs written by Kendrick Lamar Category:Songs written by DJ Dahi Category:Songs written by Sounwave Category:Songs written by Cardo (record producer) Category:Songs written by Teddy Walton Category:Songs written by Daniel Tannenbaum ",
