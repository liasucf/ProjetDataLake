Not wanting their paid Midsummer Night's Garden Hotel suite to go to waste she stays the night with her older sister, Law Lai- chi, and friend/wedding photographer, Ko Sam. Meanwhile, Richmond Chong Fu- ho's (Eddie Cheung), head of Midsummer Night's Garden Hotel who has just won a top executive award, night is ruined when he has to deal with his good for nothing son, Wayne Chong (Owen Cheung), who has taken advantage of his father's position and has an all out drinking party in one of the hotel rooms. While carting his dead drunk son out of the hotel, Richmond finds Lai-ching's abandoned shoe stuck in the elevator. No one seems to be able to pull the shoe out except Richmond, who doesn't find anything out of the ordinary and throws the shoe away. Three years later Lai-ching works at her almost to be mother- in-law's small bridal studio along with her sister, Lai-chi, and friend, Ko Sam. Lai-ching's almost to be mother-in-law, Dina Buffett, still holds a grudge against Lai-ching for embarrassing her son and cursed Lai-ching to be a spinster for life. During a trip to the airport to pick up her new boyfriend Titan, Lai-ching gets into a minor car accident with Richmond's chauffeured car and immediately recognizes Richmond as a man she had met seven years ago. After a fallout between Richmond and Wayne, Wayne gets into a bar brawl which leaves him delirious drunk and beaten on the streets. Lai-ching and Ko Sam tend to Wayne but a drunken Wayne mistakes Ko Sam's macaron-shaped USB drive as an actual macaron and eats it. With precious client photos stored in the USB drive Lai-ching has no other choice but to take Wayne to her home, where Wayne pretends to have amnesia in order to stay with her. Richmond soon finds Wayne refusing to come back to the hotel and is working as a wedding videographer. While Lai-ching books a suite at the Midsummer Night Garden Hotel to prepare for her wedding to her latest fianc\u00e9e Titan, Richmond encounters a distressed man who can't decide which woman to settle for. After some words of advice from Richmond, the distressed man decides he doesn't want to get married anymore and leaves his fianc\u00e9e Lai-ching on their wedding day. Blaming Richmond for her latest wedding mishap Lai-Ching seeks out Richmond for revenge only to get drunk when he finds her and then for her to blurt out that he has been the one she always wanted to marry. Richmond seeing Lai-ching is drunk thinks she is speaking nonsense. It is soon revealed that seven years ago Lai-ching was a former staff member at Midsummer Night's Garden Hotel who highly admired Richmond for his fairness and honorable treatment of the hotel staff. The two had spent a passionate night together which Richmond doesn't seem to remember since he was very drunk. While at the hotel to repay a bill for damages done to the suite she stayed at, Lai-ching is mistaken by a staff member to be an underprivileged person looking for a job interview the company was conducting. After hearing her sad story about her failure in romance Lai- ching gets hired at Midsummer Night's Garden Hotel. She doesn't want the job but her sister Lai-chi reminds her that they are in need of money since they just repaid a hefty bill to the hotel. Wayne is in a power struggle with his father, Richmond, and forcefully recruits Lai-ching as a staff member of the hotel to make Richmond miserable and also cure Lai-ching of her love sickness for Richmond. ==Cast== ===Chong family=== *Eddie Cheung as Richmond Chong Fu- ho (\u838a\u5bcc\u8c6a, homophone to \u88dd\u5bcc\u8c6a, acting like rich man), CEO of Shakespeare Group and head of the Midsummer Night Garden Hotel.
