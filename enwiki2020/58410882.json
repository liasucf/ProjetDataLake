Caribou Biosciences was initially housed in the basement of the same building that housed Doudna's laboratory. Haurwitz's company supports the commercialization of CRISPR technology in healthcare and agriculture. Its researchers explore issues in antimicrobial resistance, food scarcity, and vaccine shortages. The company licensed Berkeley's CRISPR patent and deals with agricultural and pharmaceutical companies and research firms. As of 2018 she oversees 46 employees. In 2018, Haurwitz announced that Caribou Biosciences was shifting focus on medicine and developing cancer therapies targeting microbes.
