    "text": "Jarom\u00edr Bla\u017eek (; born 29 December 1972) is a Czech former professional football goalkeeper. ==Club career== Born in Brno, Bla\u017eek started his career in Slavia Prague, where he got to play his first league games. After two years during which he was mainly used as a substitute, he moved to Dynamo \u010cesk\u00e9 Bud\u011bjovice to become the number one goalkeeper there. This season (1992\u201393) was to be the last of the Czechoslovak First League, and he decided to spend his first season in the new Gambrinus liga with Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov, which turned out to be a good choice since he won his first title, the national cup. He left after only one year though, returning to Prague, this time to FC Bohemians. They were relegated that year and Bla\u017eek, who did not want to spend a year in the Druh\u00e1 liga, was loaned for one year to his first club Slavia Prague, where again he was but a substitute. Since Bohemians regained promotion the same year, he returned there and stayed for three and a half years. However, while his club was not performing very well, Bla\u017eek drew the attention of giants Sparta Prague, transferring there in early 2000 and winning back-to-back titles in 2000 and 2001. He went on loan to rivals Marila P\u0159\u00edbram in 2001 but returned after one year. After that, he played almost every single game for Sparta Prague, be it league, cup or Champions League games. It was a very successful period for Bla\u017eek as he won four more titles and three national cups. In 2007, he decided to try a first experience abroad and was sold to German club 1. FC N\u00fcrnberg, who purchased him as a replacement for Raphael Sch\u00e4fer who had left for VfB Stuttgart over the summer. Bla\u017eek was the number one there but fell sick in April and could not play the end of a season that saw N\u00fcrnberg being relegated. In June, it was announced that Bla\u017eek was returning to Sparta Prague for the following season. However, on 16 December 2011, Sparta Prague announced their decision to terminate Bla\u017eek's contract early, releasing him as a free agent. This was confirmed by the player's agent Pavel Paska. On 22 February 2014, in a league match for Jihlava against Znojmo, Bla\u017eek kept his 139th clean sheet, setting a new goalkeeper record for the Czech league. ==International career== Bla\u017eek made his debut for the national team on 29 March 2000 in a friendly against Australia that ended up in a 3\u20131 win. He was however never able to be but the number two behind Petr \u010cech. He was part of the Czech roster at both Euro 2000 and Euro 2004, but only played in one match during the two tournaments combined. He was also on the Czech roster for the 2006 World Cup. ==Personal life== He is married and has two children \u2013 Jakub and Aneta. Bla\u017eek is the cousin of tennis player Radek \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek. ==Honours== ===Club=== Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov * Czech Cup: 1994 Slavia Prague * Czech First League: 1995\u201396 Bohemians 1905 * Czech Second League: 3rd Place 1997\u201398 * Czech Second League: 1998\u201399 Sparta Prague * Czech First League: 1999\u20132000, 2000\u201301, 2002\u201303, 2004\u201305, 2006\u201307 * Czech First League: Runner-up 2003\u201304, 2008\u201309, 2010\u201311 * Czech Cup: 2004, 2006, 2007 * Czech Cup: Runner-up 2001 Vyso\u010dina Jihlava * Czech Second League: Runner-up 2011\u201312 ===International=== Czech Republic * UEFA European Championship: Semi- finalist 2004 ===Individual=== * Czech First League: Most clean sheets 2002\u201303, 2006\u201307, 2009\u201310, 2010\u201311 * Czech First League: Team of the Year 1999\u20132000, 2002\u201303, 2003\u201304, 2008\u201309 * Czech Footballer of the Year personality of the 2005\u201306 * Czech First League: Best goalkeeper 2012\u201313 * Czech First League Player of the Month: October 2013 * Czech First League: Second best goalkeeper between the years 1993\u20132013 by the fans' poll ==Records== * Czech First League: Oldest player in history of the Czech First League (42 years, 4 months) * Czech First League: Most clean sheets in history of the Czech First League (157) * Czech First League: Most played seasons (19) ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1972 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Brno Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Czech footballers Category:SK Slavia Prague players Category:FK Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov players Category:AC Sparta Prague players Category:1.
