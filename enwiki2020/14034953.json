His areas of specialization are membrane biochemistry/biophysics and medicinal & pharmaceutical chemistry. He has extensively contributed in the areas of drug targeting in parasitic diseases and membrane phospholipids transbilayer dynamics, and is working on elucidation of actin cytoskeletal network in Leishmania. These studies have resulted in publication of about 136 original research papers, 10 review articles, 5 book chapters and 6 patents. Besides this, he is also responsible for planning, design and initiating construction of new campus at the Sitapur Road for CDRI.
