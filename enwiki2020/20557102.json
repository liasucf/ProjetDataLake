    "text": "The 2010 United States Senate election in Ohio was held on November 2, 2010, as one of many Ohio elections in 2010. Incumbent two-term Republican U.S. Senator George Voinovich decided to retire instead of seeking a third term. Republican Rob Portman won the open seat. == Democratic primary == === Background === Congressman Tim Ryan, Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner, and Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher were considered leading contenders to run against George Voinovich. Ohio Governor Ted Strickland urged Jennifer Brunner to run for re-election rather than run for the Senate. Cuyahoga County Commissioner Peter Lawson Jones and Ohio State Representative Tyrone Yates considered running, but both withdrew from consideration. === Candidates === * Lee Fisher, Lieutenant Governor * Jennifer Brunner, Secretary of State === Campaign === On February 17, 2009, Brunner and Fisher both officially announced their candidacies for the now-open seat election, with Strickland officially endorsing Fisher. Ryan declined to run and endorsed Fisher in July. Fisher was endorsed by Governor Ted Strickland and U.S. Representatives John Boccieri, Tim Ryan, Zack Space, and Charlie Wilson. Polling in late 2009 and January 2010 showed Brunner to be more competitive than Fisher in a general election matchup against Portman, while Fisher and Brunner were deadlocked in Democratic primary polling. Charlene Renee Bradley and Traci Johnson also filed to run in the Democratic primary. === Polling === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- valign=bottom ! Poll source ! ! ! !

Former Ohio Secretary of State Ken Blackwell was also considered a potential candidate, but declined in order to run for chairman of the Republican National Committee. === Candidate === * Rob Portman, former U.S. Representative, former United States Trade Representative and former Director of the Office of Management and Budget === Campaign === When Voinovich made his retirement official, Portman declared his candidacy the next day. Thomas Ganley, a Cleveland car dealer, launched his campaign for the nomination in April, after Portman had collected support from most of the Ohio Republican establishment. Taylor officially declined to run in May and was announced as gubernatorial candidate John Kasich's running mate on January 12, 2010 Ganley was the only other declared candidate, but on February 17, 2010, he announced that he would switch races and run against Betty Sutton in Ohio's 13th congressional district instead, leaving Portman as the only Republican candidate. He had over $7 million in campaign funds. === Results === == General election == === Candidates === * Rob Portman (R), former U.S. Congressman and Cabinet member for George W. Bush * Lee Fisher (D), Lieutenant Governor, former Ohio Attorney General, former State Senator, and former State Representative * Dan La Botz (Socialist Party) * Eric Deaton (Constitution Party) * Michael Pryce (Independent) === Campaign === When the incumbent announced he would retire, Portman jumped into the race in early 2009. During the two-year time period, Portman raised over $9 million. Originally, the election was seen as a toss up, as Portman's experience in the Bush administration was considered a liability for him. Both President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Fisher. However, Portman consistently led in fundraising and polling, particularly as Portman was unopposed in the Republican primary, while the Democratic primary between Fisher and Brunner was highly divisive. Television advertisements were very negative. Fisher attacked Portman for helping to ship jobs overseas during his entire political career, backing deals that shipped jobs overseas, and the trade deficit with China, which grew by over $41 billion.PolitiFact | Lee Fisher hammers Rob Portman on record in Bush administration Portman claimed in response that most jobs were being lost to other states, not countries.Portman targets Fisher with claim that most jobs Ohio lost went to other states: PolitiFact Ohio | cleveland.com Portman attacked Fisher for supporting Obama's stimulus and cap and trade.RealClearPolitics - Portman Hits Fisher on Jobs in New Ad === Debates === Three debates were held in Cleveland, Columbus, and Toledo.U.S. Senate candidates Rob Portman and Lee Fisher agree to debates in Cleveland, Columbus and Toledo | cleveland.com The first one was in Toledo on October 5.
