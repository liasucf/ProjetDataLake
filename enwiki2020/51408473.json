His mathematical work is in the area of automorphic forms, including major advances on the Langlands programme == Career and distinctions == Clozel was a student at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure and later obtained a Ph.D. under Michel DufloMathematics Genealogy Project He is currently a full professor at the Universit\u00e9 Paris-Sud in Orsay. He received the Prix \u00c9lie Cartan of the French Academy for his work on base change for automorphic forms. He was an invited speaker at the 1986 International congress of mathematicians in Berkeley , talking about \"Base change for GL(n)\". Together with Richard Taylor, Nicholas Shepherd-Barron and Michael Harris he proved the Sato\u2013Tate conjecture. == Selected publications == * With James Arthur: Simple algebras, base change and the advanced theory of the trace formula, Annals of Mathematical Studies, Princeton University Press, 1989 * Motifs et formes automorphes: applications du principe de fonctorialit\u00e9 in James Milne, ed. : Automorphic forms, Shimura Varieties and L-Functions, Proc.
