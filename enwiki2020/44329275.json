    "text": "The Shoffner Act was intended to restore order in North Carolina counties where Ku Klux Klan (KKK) violence raged. Introduced by Alamance County Republican senator T. M. Shoffner, the act, which was passed by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1870, empowered the governor to suspend habeas corpus and use the state militia. Local indignation over the klan's excesses caused Governor William W. Holden to declare Alamance and Caswell counties to be in a state of insurrection and invoked the Shoffner Act, and brought in Colonel George Kirk to restore order; the acts of Colonel Kirk's troops to end klan terrorism came to be known as the Kirk-Holden War.NCpedia article by Allen W Trelease, 2006, http://ncpedia.org/shoffner-act Senator Shoffner was burned in effigy in several counties,T.
