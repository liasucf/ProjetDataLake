    "text": "The Ro\u0219iori were a type of cavalry unit in the Romanian army. Active throughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Ro\u0219iori were known for their vibrant red uniforms. == History == The Ro\u0219iori were formed in the late 19th century during a period of modernization within the Romanian army. The result of these reforms was the formation of an irregular cavalry force (described in one source as being armed like Cossacks), the Lakarashi, and a professional cavalry force, the Ro\u0219iori, who were armed and organized along the lines of the cavalry of the German Empire. The Ro\u0219iori wore scarlet hussar uniforms, white pantaloons, and white belts; some sources describe the units as the \"Red Hussars\". By 1908, the Romanian army had elected to split the army's professional cavalry forces into hussar and lancer regiments. As part of this division, the Ro\u0219iori were re-organized as lancers, and formed six of the Romanian army's seventeen cavalry regiments. The Ro\u0219iori were full-time soldiers, and maintained their distinctive red uniforms. Ro\u0219iori regiments were made up of five squadrons (four of which were professional, one of which was irregular), with each squadron consisting of 174 horsemen. During World War I, the Ro\u0219iori regiments served with distinction in campaigns against Austria-Hungary, the Kingdom of Bulgaria, and the German Empire.(in Romanian) Multiple authors.

The conflict also saw the mobilization of dismounted Ro\u0219iori regiments. Following the Romania's joining of the Axis powers and subsequent entry into World War II, Ro\u0219iori regiments (which numbered 13 as of 1942) saw service on the Eastern Front against the Red Army. == List of Ro\u0219iori regiments == * 1st Ro\u0219iori regiment * 2nd Ro\u0219iori regiment - Distinguished itself at the Battle of Prunaru, where it was nearly destroyed. * 3rd Ro\u0219iori regiment * 4th Ro\u0219iori regiment - associated with the Romanian royal family, and ceremonially led by Queen Marie of Romania.
