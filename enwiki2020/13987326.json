    "text": "Kirtland's snake (Clonophis kirtlandii) is a threatened or endangered (depending on location) North American species of nonvenomous snake of the subfamily Natricinae, of the family Colubridae. www.reptile-database.org. It is the only species in the genus Clonophis.\"Clonophis kirtlandii \". ITIS (Integrated Taxonomic Information System). www.itis.gov. ==Etymology== The specific name, kirtlandii, is in honor of Dr. Jared Potter Kirtland, an American naturalist of the Nineteenth Century.Beltz, Ellin (2006). Scientific and Common Names of the Reptiles and Amphibians of North America \u2013 Explained. ebeltz.net/herps/biogappx.html#K.Beolens, Bo; Michael Watkins; Michael Grayson (2011). The Eponym Dictionary of Reptiles. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (Clonophis kirtlandi, p. 142). The snake was first identified by Robert Kennicott in 1855. Kennicott sent a specimen to Spencer Fullerton Baird, the assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, who offered to publish a description of the animal in Kennicott's name. Baird suggested Regina kirtlandii as a scientific name, as Kirtland had been a mentor to Kennicott. ==Common names== Common names for C. kirtlandii include: Cora Kennicott's snake, Kirtland's red snake, Kirtland's water snake, little red snake, Ohio Valley water snake, and spread head.Wright, A.H., and A.A. Wright (1957). Handbook of Snakes of the United States and Canada. Ithaca and London: Comstock. 1,105 pp. (in 2 volumes) (Natrix kirtlandi, pp. 496-499, Figure 146 + Map 40 on p. 491). ==Description== Kirtland's snake is small and slender. Adults reach a total length (including tail) of 12-18 inches (30\u201346 cm). It is grayish brown with a double series of large black spots down the back, and alternating smaller spots running down each side.Boulenger, G.A. (1893). Catalogue of the Snakes in the British Museum (Natural History). Volume I., Containing the Families ... Colubrid\u00e6 Aglyph\u00e6, part. London: Trustees of the British Museum (Natural History). (Taylor and Francis, printers). xiii + 448 pp. + Plates I.- XXVIII. (Ischnognathus kirtlandii, p. 286). The ventral scales are brick red with a prominent round black spot at each outer end.Conant, R. (1975). A Field Guide to Reptiles and Amphibians of Eastern and Central North America, Second Edition. Boston: Houghton Mifflin. xviii + 429 pp. + Plates 1-48. (hardcover), (paperback). (Natrix kirtlandi, p. 151 + Plate 22 + Map 106). It has 19 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, and the anal plate is divided.Smith, H.M., and E.D. Brodie, Jr. (1982). Reptiles of North America: A Guide to Field Identification. New York: Golden Press. 240 pp. . (Clonophis kirtlandi, pp. 156-157). ==Geographic range== Kirtland's snake is found in Illinois, Indiana, northern Kentucky, southern Michigan, Ohio, and western Pennsylvania. ==Habitat== The preferred natural habitats of C. kirtlandii are forest, grassland, and wetlands such as swamps and marshes. It is almost always found very close to a water source, even though it is less aquatic than water snakes of the genus Nerodia which share its geographic range. ==Conservation status== The species Clonophis kirtlandii is listed as endangered in Indiana,. Michigan, and Pennsylvania.Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission. It is listed as threatened in Illinois and Ohio, though current research in Ohio is leaning towards the snake being listed as vulnerable. ==Diet== Kirtland's snake feeds on primarily crayfish, along with the occasional earthworm, slug, minnow, salamander, frog and toad. Kirtland's snake may have a venom adapted towards killing crayfish. ==Defensive behavior== When alarmed C. kirtlandii flattens its entire body to a remarkable thinness, and becomes rigid.Schmidt, K.P., and D.D. Davis (1941). Field Book of Snakes of the United States and Canada. New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons. 365 pp. (Natrix kirtlandii, pp. 209-210 + Plate 22, Center, on p. 342). Kirtland's snake will also coil up into a disc the size of about a quarter in an attempt to hide from potential threats. If this does not succeed, it will then flee instead of fight. No person on record has ever been bitten by a Kirtland's snake. This species prefers intimidation, hiding, and fleeing rather than any form of fighting. ==Reproduction== Kirtland's snake is ovoviviparous. Females give birth in August and September. Brood size varies from 4 to 22. Each newborn is 13\u201317 cm (5-6\u00be in.) in total length and averages 1.4 gm in weight. ==References== ==Further reading== *Behler, J.L., and F.W. King (1979).
