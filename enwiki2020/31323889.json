It was released in 1959. ==Plot== Students Dieter and Sonja, who are a couple for several years, attend a masquerade. Dieter confuses young Siegi with his friend and dances with her.

The two new couples go on vacation in the Baltic Sea, where they encounter each other several times while enjoying the local attractions. They all resolve to marry their new partners.

Klein: Professor for social sciences * Friedrich Richter (actor)|Friedrich Richter: Professor B\u00f6ck * Werner Dissel: taxi driver * Ursula Fr\u00f6hlich: Sonja's mother ==Production== Love's Confusion was Dudow's last film. Influenced by the relaxed political climate ushered with the Khrushchev Thaw, the picture was unprecedentedly libertine in regards to sexuality .Feinstein. p. 89. The film was the screen debut of actress Angelica Domr\u00f6se,Poss. p. 132 who has been selected from among 800 contestants who applied for auditions.DEFA: Unternehmer-Moral. Der Spiegel, 3 September 1958. Principal photography lasted eleven months.Poss. p. 133. Dudow's work greatly exceeded its approved budget, which was originally set on 2,309,500 East German Mark; additional costs reached some 925,000 DDM. Karl-Eduard von Schnitzler published an article in Neues Deutschland critical of the delays and expenditures. In addition, the director faced difficulties in including a scene featuring nude bathing. While the DEFA studio insisted on its removal, Dudow attempted to preserve it by turning it into a dream sequence; he appealed to Minister of Culture Alexander Abusch, a former naturist who appeared in Dudow's 1932 Kuhle Wampe as a nude extra. Abusch forwarded the decision directly to Walter Ulbricht, who denied the request.Feinstein. p. 88. ==Reception== Love's Confusion sold 1,900,000 tickets in East Germany.Feinstein. p. 93. While it was not met with approval by government officials and the cultural establishment, it enjoyed great popularity with audiences,Schittly. p. 97. becoming \"a huge hit.\"Bock, Bergfelder. p. 100. Neues Deutschland critic Horst Knietzsch wrote that the film was \"an attempt to demonstrate in an amusing fashion the victorious strength of socialist life.\" Der Morgen reviewer Christoph Funke commented that \"the love of young people today... Knows no tragic consequences, since it is rooted in socialist order.\"Feinstein. p. 92. West German Heinz Kersten noted that Love's Confusion was \"refreshing\" as it virtually lacked a political message, a rare feature in East German cinema.Kersten. p. 231. Antonin and Miera Liehm defined the film as an \"exception among DEFA's productions and an honorable conclusion of Dudow's career.\"Liehm. p. 265. ==References== ==Bibliography== *Joshua Feinstein.
