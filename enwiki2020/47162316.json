Lanyon's software supported a range of clients including corporations, hotels, associations, tradeshows, convention and visitor bureaus (CVBs), and intermediaries in the meetings, events and travel space. It was merged into Cvent in 2017.lanyon.com ==History== Lanyon Solutions was formed from the combination of two companies, Active Network Business Solutions Group and Lanyon, by Vista Equity Partners in 2014. Two acquisitions added Passkey and GenieConnect in 2014. Nevertheless, the solutions and services offered by the individual companies date back decades. ===Lanyon=== Lanyon was founded in 1984 by Nick Lanyon in Irving, Texas as a provider of software focused on corporate transient travel. In 2009, Lanyon received $10 million in funding from Frontier Capital, Charlotte, NC-based private equity company to expand Lanyon's product, customer and sales support. The company was purchased by Vista Equity Partners in December 2012, signaling the exit of Frontier Capital's investment in the company. ===Passkey International=== Founded in 1996, Waltham, MA-based Passkey International provided hotel reservation technology to hotels and event planners. In April 2014, Lanyon acquired Passkey, which complemented Lanyon's existing event solutions. This included Passkey's GroupMAX technology, which enabled hotels and destination marketing organizations to drive more revenue on group reservations while easing manual tasks associated with managing group room blocks. ===StarCite=== StarCite was founded in 1999 as a spinoff from McGettigan Partners. The company expanded its focus from desktop consolidation to meetings technology after acquiring attendee applications provider RegWeb in 2002 and attendee product provider b-there in 2003. In 2006, StarCite merged with OnVantage Inc., which was formed through a merger between seeUthere Technologies and PlanSoft in 2004, bringing together two leaders in meetings technology. The merged company took the StarCite name. Products included StarCite Mobile attendee for attendee networking, 1:1 meetings to schedule meetings, Business Intelligence for meetings data analytics, suite of SMM applications, and a supplier database. ===Active Network Business Solutions Group=== In 2008, The Active Network acquired Boulder, CO-based RegOnline, an online registration company, and Lindon, UT-based WingateWeb, which provided large enterprise event management software. In January 2012, Active Network acquired StarCite for $57.7 million to form the Business Solutions group to offer SMM and event marketing software for all meetings and events. In addition to StarCite for SMM, the Business Solutions group technology offering included ActiveWorks Conference for conferences, RegOnline for online registration, and StarCite Supplier Marketplace for hotel and venue sourcing. In September 2013, Active Network was acquired by Vista Equity Partners for over $1 billion, which would return the public company to private status. In February 2014, Lanyon was paired with Active Network's Business Solutions Group and consolidated under the Lanyon name. ===GenieConnect=== GenieConnect was founded in 2010 with teams in the US, UK and APAC. Previously known as GenieMobile until March 2013, UK-based GenieConnect offered an enterprise-level mobile event technology. Products included SmartConnect which provides content based on attendee app usage, iBeacon-enabled audience response solution, marketing to track attendee behaviors and send messages to audiences, and OmniStream Event Wall to aggregate social and event activity. GenieConnect's mobile event technology is used by associations, corporations, exhibitors and expo companies.

Acquired by Lanyon in December 2014, GenieConnect's mobile technology was already integrated with many of Lanyon's existing solutions. ===Lanyon Solutions=== Formed in early 2014 with the merger of Active Network Business Solutions Group and Lanyon, Lanyon Solutions expanded its software offering focus through several key mergers and acquisitions. The company acquired group hotel reservations company Passkey in April 2014 and mobile application company GenieConnect in December 2014.
