    "text": "Ira Martin Gessel (born 9 April 1951Ira Gessel's CV in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) is an American mathematician, known for his work in combinatorics. He is a long-time faculty member at Brandeis University and resides in Arlington, Massachusetts. == Education and career == Gessel studied at Harvard University graduating magna cum laude in 1973. There, he became a Putnam Fellow in 1972, alongside Arthur Rubin and David Vogan.Putnam Competition Individual and Team Winners, MAA website. He received his Ph.D. at MIT and was the first student of Richard P. Stanley. He was then a postdoctoral fellow at the IBM Watson Research Center and MIT. He then joined Brandeis University faculty in 1984. He was promoted to Professor of Mathematics and Computer Science in 1990, became a chair in 1996\u201398, and Professor Emeritus in 2015. Gessel is a prolific contributor to enumerative and algebraic combinatorics. He is credited with the invention of quasisymmetric functions in 1984K. Luoto, S. Mykytiuk, S. van Willigenburg, An Introduction to Quasisymmetric Schur Functions Hopf Algebras, Quasisymmetric Functions, and Young Composition Tableaux, Springer, New York, 2013, p. vii. and foundational work on the Lagrange inversion theorem. As of 2017, Gessel was an advisor of 27 Ph.D. students. Gessel was elected a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society in the inaugural class of 2012. Since 2015, he is an Associate Editor of the Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.Profile of Ira Gessel, DLMF. ==Political activism== In 1970, while a senior in High School, Ira Gessel and his brother Michael Gessel started a grass-roots political organization to end pay toilets in America.A. Gordon, Why Don\u2019t We Have Pay Toilets in America?, Pacific Standard, Sep 17, 2014. The movement was largely successful and was disbanded in 1976. == See also == * Lindstr\u00f6m\u2013Gessel\u2013Viennot lemma * Dyson conjecture * Stirling permutation * Dixon's identity * Super-Catalan numbers ==References== ==External links== * Ira Gessel's homepage * Category:1951 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century American mathematicians Category:21st-century American mathematicians Category:Combinatorialists Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:American Jews Category:Jewish scientists Category:People from Philadelphia Category:Brandeis University faculty Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni ",
