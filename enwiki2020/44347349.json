    "text": "Henuttawy or Henettawy, was an ancient Egyptian princessThough Henuttawy C was daughter of a High Priest of Amun, she is often referred as princess likely due to the fact that her father Menkheperre held a kingly status within Karnak. and priestess during the 21st Dynasty. ==Biography== Henuttawy was probably a daughter of the Theban High Priest of Amun Menkheperre and of Isetemkheb C, herself daughter of pharaoh Psusennes I. She likely married her brother Smendes II who became High Priest of Amun after his father's death. The couple had at least a daughter, Isetemkheb E.Kenneth Kitchen, The Third Intermediate Period in Egypt (1100\u2013650 BC), 1996, Aris & Phillips Limited, Warminster, , \u00a7 46 (ii). She holds many titles such as Chantress of Amun, Mistress of the House, Chief of the Harim of Amun, Flautist of Mut, God's Mother of Khonsu.Mummy board of Henettawy (C), Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York (see description) Henuttawy died as an elderly woman around her 70s, and was buried in the Deir el-Bahari necropolis near the Mortuary Temple of Hatshepsut. Her tomb (MMA 60) was plundered in antiquity, and was rediscovered in 1923-24 by an expedition led by Herbert E. Winlock. The jewelry was long gone but the mummy, coffins and part of the funerary equipment were taken to the Metropolitan Museum of Art where these are exhibited today.Porter, B. & Moss, R., Topographical bibliography of ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic texts, reliefs and paintings. I. The Theban necropolis, part 2. 2nd edition, Oxford University Press 1964, p. 629. Later, some of Henuttawy's coffin were given to the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (acc. no. 54.639-40). According to Kenneth Kitchen, she is likely the same Henuttawy who is mentioned as the beneficiary of a decree carved on the Tenth Pylon of the Precinct of Amun-Ra at Karnak, and issued in years 5, 6 and 8 of an unnamed king \u2013 possibly Siamun \u2013 when the High Priest of Amun at Thebes was Smendes II's successor, Pinedjem II. The inscriptions did not mentions any title but from these is clear that Henuttawy and her daughter Isetemkheb inherited the property of a man named Smendes, likely the former's defunct husband (Smendes II).Kenneth Kitchen, op. cit., \u00a7 389. \"Amduat\" Papyrus of Henettawy, daughter of Isetemkheb.
