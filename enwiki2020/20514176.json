The site was originally built during the early period of the Medang Kingdom which controlled Central Java during the 8th and 9th centuries. Similar to the Dieng temples on the Dieng Plateau, Gedong Songo was erected out of volcanic stone and the two complexes represent the oldest Hindu structures in Java. Dieng and Gedong Songo predate Borobudur and Prambanan, and show considerable influence from Indian Hindu temple architecture.MichellTemple IV at Gedong Songo Temple I at Gedong SongoThe temples of Gedong Songo reflect a similar architectural structure to those on the Dieng Plateau, though they have less variation in form than them.
