It was held on 27 and 28 January 2013 in Santiago, Chile. All CELAC member states participated except Paraguay. Following the impeachment of Fernando Lugo in 2012, Paraguay was excluded from Mercosur and Unasur meetings. While Paraguay was not officially sanctioned or suspended by CELAC, the government decided not to attend the summit, claiming that it had not been invited to it. On 28 January 2013, the President of Cuba Ra\u00fal Castro succeeded President of Chile Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era as the pro tempore president of the CELAC.
