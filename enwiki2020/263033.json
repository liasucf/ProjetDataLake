The complex is the oldest surviving Turkish architectural structure built in Istanbul, and further gives its name to the neighborhood around it in the city's Beykoz district. ==History== Anadoluhisar\u0131 was built between 1393 and 1394 on the commission of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, as part of his preparations for a siege on the then- Byzantine city of Constantinople. Constructed on an area of , the fortress is situated at the narrowmost point of the Bosporus, where the strait is a mere wide. The site is bound by G\u00f6ksu () creek to the south, and was previously home to the ruins of a Roman temple dedicated to Uranus. Erected primarily as a watch fort, the citadel has a tall, quadratic main tower within the walls of an irregular pentagon, with five watchtowers at the corners. Constantinople was blockaded from 1394 on, but Bayezid's campaign was first interrupted by the Crusade of Nicopolis, and then ended with his defeat at the Battle of Ankara. An 11-year civil war followed, which ended with the ascent of Mehmed I to the throne. His grandson, Sultan Mehmed II reinforced the fortress with a two-meter-thick wall and three additional watchtowers, and added further extensions, including a warehouse and living quarters. As part of his plans to launch a renewed military campaign to conquer Constantinople, Mehmed II further built a sister structure to Anadoluhisar\u0131 across the Bosphorus called Rumelihisar\u0131, and the two fortresses worked in tandem in 1453 to throttle all maritime traffic along the Bosphorus, thus helping the Ottomans achieve their goal of making the city of Constantinople (later renamed Istanbul) their new imperial capital. After the Ottoman conquest of the city, Anadoluhisar\u0131 served as a customs house and military prison, and after several centuries, fell into disrepair. After the fall of the Ottomans and the 1923 establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the newly-created Turkish Ministry of Culture tended to and ultimately restored the site in 1991 - 1993. Today, Anadoluhisar\u0131 lends a picturesque appearance to its corner of the Bosphorus alongside the timber yal\u0131 homes that define the neighborhood, and functions as a historical site, although it is not open to the public.
