    "text": "Clare Oliver (25 August 1981 - 13 September 2007) was an Australian woman whose own health crisis prompted her to become an activist, garnering wide media coverage for her campaign to raise awareness about the risks of using solariums excessively. She had wanted to become a journalist and wrote a story before her death that was published in newspapers all over the country. Oliver's melanoma was first discovered as part of a health check-up shortly after she had been employed by SBS Television upon completion of a media degree. She went to Melbourne Girls' College and Presentation College Windsor in her high school years. Clare partially blames her melanoma on solarium use, but admits that excessive tanning at the beach also contributed to her cancer. She believed the government didn't realise the dangers of solariums, and that young people need to be educated about the dangers of solariums before making any decisions regarding their use.Sun Safe Summer.Tributes pour in as Clare's message rolls out, The Age September 14, 2007.
