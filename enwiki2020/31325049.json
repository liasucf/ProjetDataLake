    "text": "{| |} The Laister LP-15 Nugget is an American single-seat, high-wing glider designed by Jack and Bill Laister for the FAI Standard Class.Said, Bob: 1983 Sailplane Directory, Soaring Magazine, page 14. Soaring Society of America, November 1983. USPS 499-920 ==Design and development== Designed in the 1970s, the Nugget was intended to compete with the new European fiberglass gliders that were beginning to appear, and as such incorporated mixed construction methods. The fuselage is built with a fiberglass cockpit area, with the fuselage aft of the wing trailing edge made from aluminum. The wing is of Chem-weld bonded aluminum construction, the bonding replacing rivets in an attempt to get a surface as smooth and wave-free as fiberglass. The wing employs a Wortmann FX 67 170/150 airfoil and has flaps. The long span flaps serve both as speed-range drag reducing camber changing devices and full deflection high-lift/high-drag landing flaps. The aircraft can carry up to of water ballast in a center fuselage tank, located at the center of gravity. The landing gear is a retractible monowheel. Even though several sources report that the LP-15 was type certified, no type certificate was ever filed for it and all aircraft are registered as Experimental-Racing, Experimental- Exhibition or Experimental-Amateur-built. The LP in the designation indicates Laister Products and the model number is the wingspan in metres. ==Operational history== As of January 2016 there were still 9 LP-15 Nuggets registered in the USA. ==Aircraft on display== *National Soaring Museum - 1 ==Specifications (LP-15) == Laister LP-15 Nugget ==See also== ==References== ==External links== *Photos of the LP-15 in the National Soaring Museum *Video of an LP-15 Nugget in soaring flight Category:1970s United States sailplanes LP-15 ",
