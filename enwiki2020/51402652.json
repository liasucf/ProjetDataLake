    "text": "Tyler Jake Denton (born 6 September 1995) is an English professional footballer who plays as a left-back for National League side Chesterfield. A former England U17 international, he can also play as a midfielder. He turned professional at Leeds United in 2014, and joined Port Vale on loan for the first half of the 2017\u201318 season. He joined Peterborough United on loan for the 2018\u201319 season and was sold to Stevenage in July 2019. From Stevenage he moved to Chesterfield in October 2020. ==Club career== ===Leeds United=== Denton started his career at Leeds United in 2003 and graduated through the academy, turning professional in the summer of 2014, before being appointed as the under-21 captain for the 2015\u201316 season. Under new manager Garry Monk, Denton was called into Leeds first team squad for their friendlies for the 2016\u201317 pre-season and was given squad number 33. He made his first team debut on 23 August, when he started at left-back in an EFL Cup fixture against Luton Town; he scored the only goal of the game and was subsequently named in the competition's team of the second round. Three days later he signed a new three-year contract. On 9 January 2017, Denton made his next appearance for Leeds when he started in their 2\u20131 FA Cup win at Cambridge United. He made his third appearance in the next round of the competition 20 days later, as Leeds were eliminated by non-league side Sutton United. He signed a new three-year contract in August 2017. ====Port Vale loan==== On 7 August 2017, Denton joined EFL League Two side Port Vale on loan for the 2017\u201318 season, with a recall clause option in January. The loan was authorized by Leeds manager Thomas Christiansen after he secured Cameron Borthwick-Jackson on a season- long loan. He was a first-team regular under Michael Brown, before losing his place in October under new manager Neil Aspin. He was recalled to Elland Road on 3 January 2018 due to family reasons. Prior to joining Peterborough, Denton was subject of a loan offer from Italian Serie B Side Brescia, owned by previous Leeds owner Massimo Cellino. ====Peterborough loan==== On 6 July 2018, Denton joined League One side Peterborough United on loan for the 2018\u201319 season. Manager Steve Evans had briefly been Leeds manager shortly after Denton had turned professional. His debut for the \"Posh\" came on 14 August, in a 2\u20130 defeat to EFL Championship side Queens Park Rangers in the EFL Cup. He made his first league appearance on 27 October, in a 2\u20131 win over Burton Albion. The form of Colin Daniel and Daniel Lafferty meant that he was limited to 14 appearances during the 2018\u201319 season and chairman Darragh MacAnthony tweeted that \"[he] needs to improve massively if to ever break into Leeds team\". ===Stevenage=== Denton joined League Two club Stevenage on 11 July 2019, signing for an undisclosed fee. He missed the start of the season due to injury and was only able to feature in one game before manager Dino Maamria was sacked and replaced by Graham Westley. He played 19 games for \"Boro\" in the 2019\u201320 season as the club were relegated after finishing bottom of the English Football League and was released by new manager Alex Revell in June 2020. ===Chesterfield=== On 10 October 2020, Denton signed with National League side Chesterfield after training with the \"Spireties\"; manager John Pemberton said he had \"been recruited to help the balance of the team [as] we needed a left-sided player to share the workload\". ==International career== In 2011, Denton made his debut for England U17 against the Faroe Islands. ==Style of play== Denton is primarily a left-back, but can also play as a midfielder. ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|League Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=\"6\"|Leeds United |2014\u201315 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2015\u201316 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2016\u201317 |Championship |0||0||2||0||1||1||0||0||3||1 |- |2017\u201318 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Championship |0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !0!!0!!2!!0!!1!!1!!0!!0!!3!!1 |- |Port Vale (loan) |2017\u201318 |League Two |15||0||3||0||0||0||3||0||21||0 |- |Peterborough United (loan) |2018\u201319 |League One |10||0||1||0||1||0||2||0||14||0 |- |Stevenage |2019\u201320 |League Two |15||0||0||0||0||0||4||0||19||0 |- |Chesterfield |2020\u201321 |National League |1||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||1||0 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !41!!0!!6!!0!!2!!1!!9!!0!!58!!1 |} ==References== ==External links== * Category:1995 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Dewsbury Category:Black English sportspeople Category:English footballers Category:England youth international footballers Category:Association football fullbacks Category:Association football midfielders Category:Leeds United F.C. players Category:Port Vale F.C. players Category:Stevenage F.C. players Category:Chesterfield F.C. players Category:Peterborough United F.C. players Category:National League (English football) players ",
