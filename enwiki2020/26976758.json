    "text": "Lost Boy is the second full-length album by American metalcore band MyChildren MyBride. It was released on June 8, 2010 through Solid State Records. The album was recorded at Glow in the Dark Studios in Atlanta, Georgia and produced by Matt Goldman.\"Solid State Records - Lost Boy'\", undated ==Review== Christian metalcore outfit MyChildren MyBride's sophomore effort rises above its 2008 predecessor with a more adventurous approach to the genre. The basic tenets of the style (toneless screaming and staccato riffs layered over a foundation of tight, dry, double kick drum pedal bursts) are well represented on Lost Boy, but the machine screw production and tone-deaf melodic structures that often accompany those parameters are not. Guitarists Robert Bloomfield and Daniel Alvarado know how to grind out basic jackhammer riffs, but they also know how to take those riffs and bend them into something real, melodic, and surprisingly progressive. Standout cuts like \u201cHooligans\u201d and \u201cRedeemer\u201d benefit from the old-school punk gang vocals, and producer Matt Goldman (Underoath, the Chariot) allots vocalist Matthew Hasting's voice (which is surprisingly effective and utterly devoid of Cookie Monster posturing) the room it needs to be heard, resulting in another strong outing for both the band and the increasingly \u201csolid\u201d Solid State Records.\"Solid State Records - Lost Boy'\", undated ==Track listing== ==Credits== ;MyChildren MyBride * Matthew Hasting \u2013 vocals * Daniel Alvarado \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Robert Bloomfield \u2013 rhythm guitar, backing vocals * Joe Lengson \u2013 bass guitar, backing vocals ;Session musicians * Patrick Snyder - drums ;Production * Produced and engineered by Matt Goldman, at Glow in the Dark Studios, Atlanta, Georgia * Mixed by Jason Suecof * Mastered by Troy Glessner, at Spectre Studios, Renton, Washington * A&R; by Brandon Day * Artwork by Jordan Butcher * Photography by Jerad Knudson ==References== Category:Solid State Records albums Category:2010 albums Category:MyChildren MyBride albums ",
