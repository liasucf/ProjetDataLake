    "text": "Sir James Augustine Gobbo, (born 22 March 1931) is an Australian retired jurist who served as the 25th Governor of Victoria, from 1997 to 2000. ==Family and early life== Giacomo \"James\" Gobbo was born in Carlton, Victoria, on 22 March 1931, to Italian parents Antonio and Regina. In March 1935 the family returned to Cittadella, Padua, Italy, where a sister, Natalina, was born shortly after. Three years later the family, which also included a brother, Flavio, arrived back in Australia to take up permanent residency in North Melbourne, Victoria.National Archives of Australia, Department of Immigration and Border Protection; A12508, 31/2551 Personal Statement and Declaration by alien passengers entering Australia (Forms A42) Gobbo, then aged seven, spoke no English at the time of his return, and his father, who had started a caf\u00e9, felt the time was right for him to receive a Catholic education. Gobbo's early schooling included St Mary's Primary School, West Melbourne and later St Joseph's CBC, North Melbourne. In 1944 he was accepted into Xavier College, where he won the 1948 Associated Public Schools Head of the River before studying law at the University of Melbourne during which time he lived at Newman College. In 1951 he was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship, with which he attained a Master of Arts degree at Magdalen College, University of Oxford. In 1957 Gobbo married former librarian Shirley Lewis, and has five children. His son, James Gobbo, Jr., was the Liberal candidate for the district of Bentleigh in the 2006 Victorian state election. ==Judicial career== After many years as a barrister and later as a Queen's Counsel, Gobbo was appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court of Victoria. He served from 18 July 1978 until he retired from the bench on 14 February 1994. ==Vice-regal career== Gobbo served as Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria from 1995 until he was appointed Governor of Victoria in 1997 by Queen Elizabeth II on the advice of the Victorian premier, Jeff Kennett. He was the first Australian state governor of Italian descent. Gobbo's term of office was to be shorter than the usual five years, due to the uncertain outcome of the looming 1999 Australian republic referendum. If a republic had come into effect, then the governorship of Victoria would have been abolished from 1 January 2001. In August 2000 the new premier, Steve Bracks, announced that Gobbo's successor would be John Landy, who would take up his post in January 2001. Gobbo immediately made it known that he had had an understanding with Kennett for an extension of his term beyond 2000, and expressed deep disappointment that this was not now to occur.ABC: The World Today Archive \u2013 Victoria's new governor However, this understanding must have been private, since Kennett's letter of appointment stated that any extension beyond 31 December 2000 would be a matter for the premier of the day. Bracks said that he had no knowledge of any such understanding. After leaving office, Gobbo took up the position of Commissioner for Italy for the Victorian government until June 2006, and has since continued on various boards and councils. In 2006, Gobbo was the Chair of the Council of the National Library of Australia and the Council of the Order of Australia and Chair of the Australian Multicultural Foundation. ==Honours== Gobbo was appointed a Knight Bachelor in 1981; a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) in 1993; and a Knight of Grace of the Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St John of Jerusalem in 1997. He was awarded the Centenary Medal in 2001 and is also a Knight of Malta.https://web.archive.org/web/20080719155755/http://www.smom.org.au/pdf/Hospitaller%20P8.pdf ==See also== * Judiciary of Australia * List of Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria * Victorian Bar Association ==References== ==External links== * https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/172103629 James Gobbo and parents photograph * https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/172107971 Gobbo family portrait, Italy Category:1931 births Category:Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:Australian Commanders of the Royal Victorian Order Category:Australian Knights Bachelor Category:Australian people of Italian descent Category:Australian Rhodes Scholars Category:Australian Queen's Counsel Category:Companions of the Order of Australia Category:Governors of Victoria (Australia) Category:Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria Category:Knights of Malta Category:Living people Category:Melbourne Law School alumni Category:People educated at Xavier College Category:Lieutenant- Governors of Victoria ",
