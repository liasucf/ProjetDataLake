The Blackbirds most recently played their home games at the Steinberg Wellness Center, formerly known as the Wellness, Recreation & Athletics Center, and were members of the Northeast Conference. Their final head coach was Derek Kellogg, who was hired after his firing from Massachusetts in 2017, with 2017-18 season was his first as head coach. On March 12, 2013, the team achieved what was the greatest run in Northeast Conference history with a third straight NCAA Tournament bid. In October 2018, LIU announced that it would merge its two existing athletic programs\u2014the LIU Brooklyn Blackbirds and LIU Post Pioneers, the latter an NCAA Division II member\u2014effective with the 2019\u201320 school year. The merged athletic program now competes as the LIU Sharks, with the new colors of blue and gold, with Kellogg becoming the Sharks' first head men's basketball coach. ==History== LIU was a national powerhouse in the 1930s and 1940s under Clair Bee, who compiled the highest winning percentage in major college basketball history. The Blackbirds were retroactively recognized as the pre-NCAA Tournament national champion for the 1935\u201336 season by the Premo- Porretta Power Poll. However, after several players were implicated in the point-shaving scandal of 1951, LIU shuttered its entire athletic program. It returned to the College Division (now Division II) in 1957, and only returned to the University Division (the predecessor to Division I) in the late 1960s. ==Postseason== ===NCAA Division I Tournament results=== The Blackbirds appeared in the NCAA Division I Tournament seven times.
