He is believed to have succeeded Vasishka and was succeeded by Vasudeva II. He ruled in areas of Northwestern India. ==Inscriptions== In an inscription dated to the \"Year 41\" (probably of the 2nd century of the Kanishka era) and discovered on the borders of the river Ara in Punjab, he qualifies himself as a Maharaja Rajatiraja Devaputra Kaisara Kanishka (\"Great King, King of Kings, Son of God, Caesar, Kanishka), suggesting some awareness of the Roman Empire as Kaisara seems to stand for \"Caesar\", and names himself as the son of Vajheshka, identified as Kushan ruler Vashishka.Mario Busssagli, \"L'Art du Gandhara\", p229 The inscription is rather worn and the reading Kaisara has been doubted, especially since no other mentions of this title are known from Kushan sources. ==Coinage== No definite coins are known of him, as the \"Kanishka\" named in the coins is not differentiated. Only workmanship and graphical style in relation to other known rulers, tend to suggest attribution to this later Kanishka. ==Notes== Category:Kushan Empire Category:3rd-century Indian monarchs ",
