The Old Town in Poole used to contain slums which became very unhealthy during the warmer summer months and so mothers would take their children to camp on the island while the fathers continued to work, visiting their families when they could.Poole's Hidden History-Doughty's Island at boathookbald.blogspot.co.uk.
