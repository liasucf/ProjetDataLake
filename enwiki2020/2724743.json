    "text": "House Of Krazees is an American hip hop group from Detroit, Michigan. The group was originally composed of emcees The R.O.C. (Raps On Contact, later known as Sol)http://www.myspace.com/rapsoncontact, Mr. Bones and Hektic. House of Krazees performed a style of hardcore hip hop known as horrorcore or The Wicked Shit which their particular style of this was known as \"retro horror music\" and was originally active from 1992 until 1997. The original lineup have reunited in 2013 and currently perform together at times under the HOK moniker, and released a box set and new music in 2018. Hektic and Mr. Bones left the group in 1997 to form Twiztid, changing their stage names respectively to Monoxide Child and Jamie Madrox, which put the group on a temporary hiatus. Later in 1997, The R.O.C. resurrected House of Krazees, changed his stage name to Sol and continued to perform under the House of Krazees name (for one album, to fulfill contractual obligations for one more H.O.K. album) with rapper Skrapz (formerly of 2 Krazy Devils with Psycho C). This new edition of House of Krazees released one album in 1999, \"The Night They Kame Home\", and the House of Krazees name was retired by the fall of 1999. Sol and Skrapz left their old manager \"Uncle Kreepy\", and formed the duo HaLFBrEEd, releasing the majority of its material on their own record label, Virus Independent. HaLFBrEEd was active up until 2003, after only four years of activity. In 2013, it was rumored and semi-announced that HaLFBrEEd was reuniting after a decade apart. Similarly, it was rumored around this time that House of Krazees were reuniting as well with the original lineup of Sol (who later changed his name back to The R.O.C.), Jamie Madrox and Monoxide. However, nothing came about from these rumors, despite another House of Krazees compilation album being released in 2013, \"Casket Cutz\", which was sold through Twiztid's online store. ==Biography== ===1992-1999: Early career=== House of Krazees was formed by R.O.C. (Raps On Contact) in 1992, with Paul Methric and Jamie Spaniolo performing under the names EXP and Big J, later changing their names to Hektic and Mr. Bones respectively. House of Krazees' catalog was only released on Compact Cassette until the group signed to Latnem Entertainment. Problems between House of Krazees and Latnem led the group to leave the label following its 1996 album, Head Trauma. That year, the group was scheduled to tour with Insane Clown Posse and Myzery, serving as an opening act for ICP. The tour was cancelled after Insane Clown Posse was dropped by Hollywood Records. They did tour with ICP and Myzery after the Great Milenko tour finally started after Island records bought the contract from Hollywood records. House of Krazees was only on a select number of dates because of tensions within the group. Methric and Spaniolo left House of Krazees in 1997, due to conflicts with the group's manager, Walter Stepanenko. R.O.C. continued to perform under the House of Krazees name with rapper Skrapz until 1999. R.O.C. and Skrapz also performed under the name \"HaLFBrEEd\". ===Post-split=== ====Twiztid==== After the split, Methric and Spaniolo sent a demo tape to Insane Clown Posse member Joseph Bruce. The demo contained the tracks \"2nd Hand Smoke,\" \"Diemuthafuckadie,\" and \"How Does It Feel?\" Bruce was extremely impressed, invited Methric and Spaniolo to perform on 'The House of Horrors Tour', and signed them to Psychopathic Records. Before the tour kicked off, Bruce, Methric and Spaniolo decided on a name that they felt would fit the duo: Twiztid. Twiztid was signed to Psychopathic from 1997 until 2012. ====R.O.C.'s solo career==== R.O.C. later became the hype man for Psychopathic Records artist Blaze Ya Dead Homie.A Family Underground documentary R.O.C. appears on Blaze's 2007 album Clockwork Gray, on the tracks \"Ill Connect\", \"Inside Looking Out\" and \"E.O.D.\" R.O.C. signed to Hatchet House in 2008 and released an EP, Welcome To The Darkside. In 2009, R.O.C. announced that he was retiring from music. In 2012, he came out of retirement and appeared on Prozak's EP Nocturnal, contributing a verse on \"Knuckle Up\". R.O.C. also appeared alongside Methric and Spaniolo on Psychopathic's fourth \"Psypher\", released in October 2012, marking an unofficial reunion of House of Krazees.//www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg0Ioxhk5yk In 2013 R.O.C appeared on Twiztids mixtape A New Nightmare on the track \"Monstrosity\" which was labeled as a House of Krazees song.

Not saying it was for HOK, but hinted at it saying \"since FTC produced Death 4 Any1 Who we've had a few more songs he's been working on for the 3 of us\". Which at that point FTC told Jamie not to say anymore, creating speculation that HOK would be releasing a full length album in 2018. It was announced on September 7th, 2018 that the House of Krazees will release a limited edition cassette box set including all 5 original HOK albums, both Mr. Bones solo releases, and The R.O.C.'s X-Posed on December 1st, 2018. ==Discography== * Home Sweet Home (October 1, 1993) * Home Bound (1994) * Season Of The Pumpkin (1994) * Outbreed (1995) * Head Trauma (October 1, 1996) * Collector's Edition '97 (1997) * The Night They Came Home (1999) * Evolution (2001) * Casket Cutz (2013) * Post Apocalyptic World (2018) ==References== Category:Bands with fictional stage personas Category:Detroit hip hop groups Category:Horrorcore groups Category:Musical groups established in 1993 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 1997 Category:Rappers from Detroit Category:Twiztid Category:Underground rappers Category:1993 establishments in Michigan ",
