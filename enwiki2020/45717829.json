The album was exclusively released through the Jet Life website through a pre- order pack, and will be released digitally and physically at a later date. == Critical response == Pilot Talk 3 was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from critics, the album received an average score of 78, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\", based on 4 reviews. Pitchfork Media's Julian Kimble wrote that, \"Curren$y may not do 'new,' but he is very good at what he does: riffing on cars, money, women, weed, and obscure moments from television shows.\" Michael Madden from Consequence of Sound said, \"There\u2019s virtually nothing not to like about Pilot Talk III. Like other Curren$y releases, it makes up for its lack of revelations with a contagious joyfulness.\" Kellan Miller from HipHopDX said, \"While other artists are constantly on the prowl for the latest trend that will keep their names relevant, Spitta never ventures out of his own lane, and yet, his latest material never seems to spoil.\" Complex's B.J. Steiner said, \"As the third installment of Spitta\u2019s aircraft-themed series, Pilot Talk 3 finds the NOLA sky captain delivering a familiar set of luxury rap fairytales upon which he\u2019s built a quietly impressive career.\" == Track listing == ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Currensy albums Category:Albums produced by Jahlil Beats Category:Albums produced by Cool & Dre Category:Albums produced by Harry Fraud Category:Sequel albums ",
