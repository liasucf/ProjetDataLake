    "text": "Blairdaff United Free Kirk Blairdaff is a parish in Garioch, Aberdeenshire, Scotland, next to the villages of Kemnay and Monymusk. Until 1986, Blairdaff had a grocery store, a post office, and both gas and diesel pumps until they were relocated to Blindburn Farm. Blairdaff Parish Church (Church of Scotland) is linked to the church in the Chapel of Garioch. The original church is located in Blairdaff's courtyard. After a fire in the 1950s, the old church had the roof removed, however, there is a tradition of open air services in the summer months, which continues to this day. ==References== Category:Parishes of Scotland ",
