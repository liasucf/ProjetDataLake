    "text": "Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement (), inasmuch as the Kyoto School, Neo-Confucianism and other prominent philosophical movements in the early-twentieth-century East Asia, is a significant philosophical movement during the Japanese colonial rule in Taiwan, in which the intellectuals in the 1920s formulated their reflections on the Taiwanese community through the western values and thoughts and wedged against the colonial domination and imperial assimilation. Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement was intensely bond with political and cultural counter- imperialism, involving intellectuals e.g. Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f), Hung Yao- hs\u00fcn(:zh:\u6d2a\u8000\u52f3), Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e), Mingdian Liu(:zh:\u5289\u660e\u96fb), Shao-Hsing Chen(:zh:\u9673\u7d39\u99a8), Lin Qiu-wu(:zh:\u6797\u79cb\u609f), Hsiang-yu Su(:zh:\u8607\u858c\u96e8), Shenqie Zhang(:zh:\u5f35\u6df1\u5207), Chin-sui Hwang(:zh:\u9ec3\u91d1\u7a57), Shoki Coe(:zh:\u9ec3\u5f70\u8f1d), Issh\u016b Y\u014d(:zh:\u694a\u674f\u5ead), C K Wu(\u5433 \u632f\u5764), and so forth. \u2018At the begin,\u2019 according to the Taiwanese cultural sociologist Ren-yi Liao (\u5ed6 \u4ec1\u7fa9)\u2019s 1988 grounding formulation, \u2018Taiwanese Philosophy has been a civil intellectual movement against domination, rather than an academic form of conception.\u2019 \u2018Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement\u2019, however, has yet ratified and systemically studied until 2014. \u2018Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn\u2019 (\u5be6\u5b58) is a Taiwanese phonic understanding from the widely discussed concept \u2018Jitsuzon\u2019(\u5b9f\u5b58; \u3058\u3064\u305e\u3093) in the 1930s Japanese intellectual circles; translated from \u2018Existenz\u2019 by Kyoto School philosopher Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d(:ja:\u4e5d\u9b3c\u5468\u9020), this concept originated from the German Philosophy and variously adopted on the dialectics of self and the others, of master and serfdom, and sovereign beings \u2018Dasein\u2019. Comparing to \u2018:de:Existenzphilosophie\u2019, \u2018:fr:L'existentialisme\u2019, \u2018Existentialism\u2019, and \u2018Jitsuzon\u2019, \u2018Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn\u2019 has its own intellectual and cultural understanding on the being in pursuit of counter-domination resistance and justice from its historical sediments as fragments of/f empires. This may somehow refer to Iris Marion Young\u2019s justice theory. == Theoretical Formulation == Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement is an intellectual movement on practice, which intensely bond with counter-domination during the Japan colonial rule. Such a cultural and societal movement came along with the political defeat in pursuit of parliamentary autonomy Petition Movement for the Establishment of a Taiwanese Parliament(:zh: \u81fa\u7063\u8b70\u6703\u8a2d\u7f6e\u8acb\u9858\u904b\u52d5)) led by the Taiwanese bourgeois Chiang Wei-shui(:zh:\u8523\u6e2d\u6c34), Lin Hsien-tang(:zh:\u6797\u737b\u5802) and other activists against the colonial regulation 'Law No. 63'(:zh:\u516d\u4e09\u6cd5). In 1920s, the Taiwanese Cultural Association(:zh:\u53f0\u7063\u6587\u5316\u5354\u6703) galvanized the self- identification from the cultural and societal perspectives, through public lectures, publications, playlets and summer schools, in which intellectuals eg. Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f), Shao-Hsing Chen(:zh:\u9673\u7d39\u99a8), Lin Qiu-wu(:zh:\u6797\u79cb\u609f) addressed in the public sphere; Lin Qiu-wu(:zh:\u6797\u79cb\u609f) and Issh\u016b Y\u014d(:zh:\u694a\u674f\u5ead) were involved with student movements, and even Shenqie Zhang(:zh:\u5f35\u6df1\u5207) and Hsiang-yu Su(:zh:\u8607\u858c\u96e8) were enlisted to militia resistance. As the Kyoto School, there lies with intellectual similarity yet different understanding on Taiwan philosophical topics from Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement philosophers. === Existence and Truth === Zeng Tianzong(:zh:\u66fe\u5929\u5f9e)\u2019s \u2018the Principles on Truth\u2019 (\u771f\u7406\u539f\u7406\u8ad6, 1937) is an enquiry of truth from phenomenological viewing. Referring to Shino Yoshinobu(\u5fd7\u91ce\u597d\u4f38). First, he critiqued on anthropocentrism and relativism for their truth is varied with milieu; and second, he differentiated truths on \u2018Keis\u014d\u2019(\u5f62\u76f8) and \u2018Rinen\u2019 (\u7406\u5ff5); the former meant form and the later meant context, which could be understood by pure logic and existence; at last, he rendered that \u2018Keis\u014d\u2019 and \u2018Rinen\u2019 could be overcoming through \u2018absolute- nothingness\u2019 (\u7d55\u5c0d\u7121) and \u2018absolute-being\u2019 (\u7d55\u5c0d\u5b58\u6709). The first two promulgations were originated from Husserlian Phenomenology and the last was inherited from the Kyoto School. Comparing to Zeng Tianzong(:zh:\u66fe\u5929\u5f9e)\u2019s disanthropocentrism, his intellectual companion Hung Yao-hs\u00fcn(:zh:\u6d2a\u8000\u52f3)\u2019s \u2018Existence and Truth\u2019 (\u5b58\u5728\u8207\u771f\u7406, 1937) elaborated further on the being and becoming in the milieu, for formulating the Taiwanese community. The Dasein of Taiwanese could be also taken into Hung Yao-hs\u00fcn(:zh:\u6d2a\u8000\u52f3)\u2019s review \u2018View on F\u016bdo\u2019 (\u98a8\u571f\u6587\u5316\u89c0) on Tetsuro Watsuji(:ja:\u548c\u8fbb\u54f2\u90ce) and Hegelian dialectics and phenomenology. Rwei-ren Wu(:zh:\u5433\u53e1\u4eba) furtherly suggests that Hung Yao-hs\u00fcn(:zh:\u6d2a\u8000\u52f3) was to formulate a Formosan Phenomenology of Spirit. === Education and Democracy === British philosopher Bertrand Russell and American philosopher John Dewey visited Asia respectively in 1920/21 and whirlwinded with the intellectual circles. In 1924, Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f) issued a series of \u2018Social Evolution and School Education' (\u793e\u6703\u4e4b\u9032\u5316\u53ca\u5b78\u6821\u6559\u80b2) and analyzed philosophy of education from the Oriental perspective: the purpose of education is to improve human civilization and the progress underlies with intellectual reinvigoration and cultural accumulation; the former is a knowledge and thought quest beyond material life and distinguishes humans from beasts, and it also infers to a well-being society without falls. The assimilation of Japanese Empire was just the opposite: imperial ideology haunted with cultural discrimination and militarism obsession. Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f)\u2019s dissertation \u2018Public Education in Formosa under the Japanese Administration - A Historical and Analytical Study of the Development and the Cultural Problems\u2019 (1929) elaborated from his supervisor John Dewey\u2019s horizon on education , and critique the overall public education in Taiwan under the Japanese colonial rule which suppressed the authentic language and cultural development and therefore led to discrimination. Taiwanese epistemologist Hsi-Heng Cheng(\u912d\u559c\u6046) noted that \u2018Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f)\u2019s critique on Japanese colonial rule was due to a universal value and democracy, rather than Taiwanese ethnic-nationalism sentiment.\u2019. === Individual and the Community === Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e)\u2019s magnum opus \u2018Individual and the Community\u2019 (1933) articulated that \u2018how each one as an individual member is determined by his community and how he as an intellectual leader reacts upon it. That the individual is essentially a product of the community, and yet may by chance become a guide of it\u2019. Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e) referred the human conduct to three factors: \u2018spontaneous\u2019 (instinct and drive), \u2018regulative\u2019 (familial and social), and \u2018adaptive\u2019 (conscience, sense and reflection). When an individual's inner conscience goes against the outer social domination as usual, it follows with conscience. Taiwanese epistemologist Cheng-Hung Tsai (\u8521\u653f\u5b8f) ascribes Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e)\u2019s moral theorem to moral institutionalism which exists with irreducible moral belief. Shao-Hsing Chen(:zh:\u9673\u7d39\u99a8)\u2019s formulation on the relation of individual and society was particularly on civil society formation from Adam Ferguson and G.W.F. Hegel. His \u2018\u9ed1\u683c\u723e\u5e02\u6c11\u793e\u6703\u8ad6\u2019 (Hegel's Theorem on Civil Society, 1936) noted that civil society is an intermediate between family and the State, which is the center of all economic activities; however, conflicts and inequalities in the civil society seems inevitable due to different needs and desires of each member. Although Shao-Hsing Chen(:zh:\u9673\u7d39\u99a8) seemingly agreed with Hegelian idea that the state must be the intermediator reconciling conflicts and injustices, but also reckoned on John Locke\u2019s critique on absolute monarchy(which may implied the flaw of the Japanese imperialism and militantism). From Shao-Hsing Chen(:zh:\u9673\u7d39\u99a8) and Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e)\u2019s formulation, a Taiwanese community independent of empires seemed intellectually expected, but failed with the postwar retrocession of Chiang Kai-shek authoritarian regime, that Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e) exiled to Hong Kong in the 1940s and Shao-Hsing Chen(:zh:\u9673\u7d39\u99a8) flew to the USA and became a sociologist on population after his doctorate in Princeton. == Concurrence with the Kyoto School and the Neo-Confucianism == Some scholars of Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement was apostles of the Kyoto School. Fa-Yu Cheng(:zh:\u912d\u767c\u80b2) studied under Nishida Kitar\u014d(:ja:\u897f\u7530\u5e7e\u591a\u90ce), and Chin-sui Hwang(:zh:\u9ec3\u91d1\u7a57) published \u2018On Dailiness \u2013 A Phenomenological Suggestion\u2019 (\u65e5\u5e38\u6027\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066\u2015\u73fe\u8c61\u5b78\u7684\u8a66\u8ad6) under the supervision of Tanabe Hajime(:ja:\u7530\u908a\u5143). In 1928, Taihoku Imperial University was established with the Department of Literature and Politics, constituted of Risaku Mutal(:ja:\u52d9\u53f0\u7406\u4f5c), Okano Ryuziro(:ja:\u5ca1\u91ce\u7559\u6b21\u90ce), Awano Yasutaro(:ja:\u6de1\u91ce\u5b89\u592a\u90ce), Sera Hisao(:ja:\u4e16\u826f\u58fd\u7537) and other intellectual pedigrees of the Kyoto School. Hung Yao-hs\u00fcn(:zh:\u6d2a\u8000\u52f3) enrolled his professorship in Taihoku at that time and furtherly elaborated his conception from the Kyoto School. Kyoto Philosopher Masakatsu Fujita(:ja:\u85e4\u7530\u6b63\u52dd) takes Hung Yao-hs\u00fcn(:zh:\u6d2a\u8000\u52f3)\u2019s philosophical significance on not merely an inheritance from Tanabe Hajime(:ja:\u7530\u908a\u5143)\u2019s \u2018species\u2019 (\u7a2e) as medium but rather an existence in lifeworld, and thus he attempted to reformulate a Taiwanese community on its own historical and social formulation. Comparing to Neo-Confucianism, Sinologist Chong-Xiu Huang (\u9ec3\u5d07\u4fee) considered Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f) to be advanced on Yangmingism studies for his comparing with Immanuel Kant, earlier than the Neo-Confucianism scholars in China e.g. Xiong Shili(:zh:\u718a\u5341\u529b), Liang Shuming(:zh:\u6881\u6f31\u6c11)), Yifu Ma(:zh:\u99ac\u4e00\u6d6e), Carsun Chang(:zh:\u5f35\u541b\u52f1), Feng Youlan(:zh:\u99ae\u53cb\u862d). Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f)\u2019s understanding on Yangmingism, aside from Japan and China, on one hand due to his childhood education in Mandarin diverged from Meiji sinologists Inoue Tetsujir\u014d(:ja:\u4e95\u4e0a\u54f2\u6b21\u90ce) and Kanie Yoshimaru(:ja:\u87f9\u6c5f\u7fa9\u4e38)\u2019s interpretation from the Enlightenment perspective, on the other contemplated a more systemic study on Kant and Descartes comparison on conscience of Yangmingism \u2018liangzhi\u2019 than his Chinese contemporaries e.g. Liang Qichao(:zh:\u6881\u555f\u8d85).

Most of Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn philosophers suffered for the wartime and the suppression. A philosopher of Anthropology Ming-kun Kuo(:zh:\u90ed\u660e\u6606) and his family demised during the wartime because their cargoship from Kobe back to Taiwan was hit by an American submarine near the East China Sea. Lin Mosei(:zh:\u6797\u8302\u751f) was disappeared and murdered by the espionage during February 28 Incident. Dong- fang Chang(:zh:\u5f35\u51ac\u82b3) was mentally ill due to the White Terror prosecution. Wen Kwei Liao(:zh:\u5ed6\u6587\u594e), C K Wu(\u5433 \u632f\u5764), Issh\u016b Y\u014d(:zh:\u694a\u674f\u5ead), Ai Chih Tsai(:zh:\u8521\u611b\u667a), Su-Qing Lin(:zh:\u6797\u7d20\u7434), Shoki Coe left Taiwan.

Ren-yi Liao articulated that during the postwar White Terror, Taiwanese Philosophy was substituted by exogenesis Chinese Philosophy as a whole; and considered that Philosophy in Taiwan would be \u2018rootless\u2019 if its academic disciplines drifted apart from its position.\u2019 The 1996 Founding Proclamation of Taiwan Philosophical Association pinned on \u2018a civic movement on academic discourse of Taiwanese Philosophy in a various way of study and research.\u2019. The interdisciplinary project on Taiwanese Philosophy held by Academia Sinica since 2017 has been unearthing the philosophical literature of pre-wartime Si\u030dt-ch\u00fbn Movement and hence developed contemporary dialogues with intellectualism crisis. == Bibliography ==
