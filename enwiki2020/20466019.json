    "text": "William \"Stockport\" Smith was an English footballer. His regular position was as an inside right, but he also played in various other forward positions and even as a wing half on occasion. He played for Stockport County, Manchester City, and Newton Heath. He joined Manchester City from Stockport in 1897 and scored 22 goals in 54 league appearances in three years at the club. He is often confused with another William Smith who played for Manchester City at the same time; because of this, they were known to Manchester City fans by the clubs they were signed from, with this William Smith referred to as \"Stockport Smith\" and the other as \"Buxton Smith\". He rejoined Stockport in 1900, but was unable to reproduce his goalscoring feats and moved on to Newton Heath for their final season before being renamed Manchester United. He made his Newton Heath debut on 14 September 1901, playing at outside right for a 5\u20130 defeat away to Middlesbrough. His only goal for Newton Heath may have come on 5 October 1901 in a 3\u20133 home draw with his former club, Stockport County, although this goal is credited to Alf Schofield by some sources. No record of Smith's football career exists beyond the 1901\u201302 season. Smith had two brothers who also played football. Lancelot and Fred both played for Wigan Town in the 1905\u201306 season. ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *MUFCInfo.com profile *10 Worsley Terrace....The Story of Wigan Town Wigan Observer: 27 December 1905: Page 8, column 3 Category:English footballers Category:Stockport County F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Manchester City F.C. players Category:Association football forwards Category:Year of birth missing Category:Year of death missing ",
