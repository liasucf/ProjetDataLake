Known for his impassioned lyrical tenor vocals, distinct stage presence and specific brand of poetic lyrics, Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 remains the vocal soloist, primary composer and lyricist for the musical group Hari Mata Hari. ==Biography== Born as Hajrudin Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 in early 1961, in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina (then a part of Yugoslavia.) Hari grew up in the Vratnik neighborhood of Sarajevo's old town. His grandfather was one of the more well- known singers of traditional Bosnian music called sevdalinka. At the age of six, Hajrudin began to sing and learned to play the guitar. At the local cultural center, he was asked to sing, then at the age of ten he sang with the group \"Omi\", and later for the group \"Sedam \u0161uma\". In Vratnik, Hari recorded his first song \"Za\u0161to da ne uzmem nju\". After finishing electrical school, Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 began to study Philosophy and attended classes of natural politics, but he never completed the courses. Music took up much of his time, as did his love of photography. In 1979, Hari joined the group Zov with whom he recorded the hit song \"Poletjela golubica sa Ba\u0161\u010dar\u0161ije.\" The song is still very popular. Next, Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 sang with the group \"Ambasadori\", with whom, it is said, that he matured into a professional artist. After his serving mandatory military service in the town of Ni\u0161, he appeared on the music scene by himself releasing the (1984) album Zlatne Ko\u010dije. His professional career has lasted over a quarter of a century and he has performed at over 1,000 concerts. In 1999, Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 performed his song \"Starac i More\" in hope of representing Bosnia and Herzegovina at the Eurovision Song Contest 1999. However, after \"Starac i More\" had won it turned out the song had already been recorded, since Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 had sold the song to record label Unirecords in Finland, and Finnish artist Janne Hurme recorded that song in 1997 in name \"Heart Blood\" (\"Syd\u00e4nveri\"). Hari Mata Hari was disqualified. The runner-up, Dino Merlin, was sent to the ESC instead. In 1999, he recorded a duet with a famous fellow Bosnian singer, Hanka Paldum. The song, \"Crni snijeg\", was featured on her album Nek' je od srca and was covered later the same year by Serbian singer Ceca on her album Ceca 2000. On 9 February 2006, the Bosnian television network PBSBiH announced that Hari Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 would represent Bosnia and Herzegovina with the song \"Lejla\" at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006. The announcement confirmed rumors circulating throughout the country for more than two months. Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 performed a song with music written by Serbian composer \u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107 and lyrics written by Bosnian writer Fahrudin Pecikoza and Serbian Dejan Ivanovi\u0107. Hari Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 told the Bosnian newspaper Nezavisne Novine: > ... The song is the best in the world. I have to admit that I have not heard > a better one. I am impressed with it and Pecikoza's lyrics. We have made a > song that comes out the spirit of our people and I am glad to be singing > it... On 20 May 2006, Hari Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 and his group Hari Mata Hari reached third place at the Eurovision Song Contest 2006 held in Athens, Greece. In 2011, Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 composed the music to and wrote the lyrics to Bri\u0161i me, a song sung by Bosnian singer Lepa Brena for her sixteenth studio album Za\u010darani krug. He also wrote the lyrics to her 2014 song Zaljubljeni veruju u sve. ==Personal life== On 14 February 2010, Vare\u0161anovi\u0107 married girlfriend Jasminka I\u0161tuk from Osijek, Croatia. They live in Sarajevo and Munich. It is the second marriage for both. Each have children from previous marriages.http://www.sarajevo-x.com/showtime/showbiz/clanak/100214046 ==References== ==External links== *Sarajevo school of pop rock Category:1961 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Sarajevo Category:Bosniaks of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina musicians Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina male singers Category:Yugoslav male singers Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants for Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Eurovision Song Contest entrants of 2006 Category:Hayat Production artists Category:Indexi Award winners ro:Hari Mata Hari ",
