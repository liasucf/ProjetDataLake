    "text": "\"String of Pearls\" is the debut studio album by Australian rock singer- songwriter and guitarist, Deborah Conway. The album was released in October 1991 and peaked at number 20 on the Australian ARIA Charts. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1992, the album received nominated for four awards; ARIA Award for Breakthrough Artist \u2013 Album, ARIA Award for Album of the Year, ARIA Award for Best Cover Art and ARIA Award for Best Female Artist. It won Best Female artist. In June 2015, Conway celebrated the 25th anniversary of the album by performing the entire album in Melbourne. ==Critical reception== Jonathan Lewis from AllMusic said \"\u2019\u2019String of Pearls\u2019\u2019 ranges from the melodic pop of the most successful single \"It's Only the Beginning\" to the rock of \"Under My Skin.\" Much of the rest of the album is acoustic pop and gentle ballads, with the superb \"Release Me\" being the best example. Conway's voice is what holds the album together. Her voice is strong and suited to these songs. In the hands of a lesser singer String of Pearls would not have been anywhere near as effective. Instead, Conway manages to cover the slight lack of originality in songwriting by her strong presence and produces a memorable set of songs. ==Track listing== ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1991/92) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\" |- |} ==Certifications== ==Credits== *Accordion \u2013 Dror Erez, Rick Staff *Autoharp \u2013 Michael den Elzen *Bass \u2013 Dave Cochrane, Michael den Elzen, Nigel Griggs, Richard Pleasance *Cello \u2013 Peter O'Reilly *Drums \u2013 Greg Morrow, Peter Jones *Drums [Snare] \u2013 Peter Maslen *Engineer \u2013 Doug Roberts, Joe Hardy *Guitar \u2013 Michael den Elzen, Richard Pleasance, Deborah Conway *Harmonica \u2013 Chris Wilson *Mandolin \u2013 Richard Pleasance *Organ \u2013 Alan Harding, Lawrence Maddy, Mick O'Connor, Rick Staff *Percussion \u2013 Greg Morrow, Michael den Elzen, Peter Maslen, Richard Pleasance *Piano \u2013 Alan Harding, Dror Erez, Richard Pleasance *Tambourine \u2013 Peter Maslen *Trumpet \u2013 Vince Jones *Violin \u2013 Ann Hickey, Tom Fitzgerald *Vocals (backing) \u2013 Deborah Conway, Joe Hardy, Linda Bull, Michael den Elzen, Richard Pleasance, Vika Bull, Vince Jones ==References== Category:1991 debut albums Category:Deborah Conway albums Category:ARIA Award-winning albums Category:Mushroom Records albums ",
