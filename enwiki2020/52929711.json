    "text": "The is a five-axle C-B wheel arrangement diesel-hydraulic locomotive type operated in Japan as a self-propelled snowplough unit since 1967 by the national railway company Japanese National Railways (JNR), and later by Hokkaido Railway Company (JR Hokkaido), East Japan Railway Company (JR East), and West Japan Railway Company (JR West). A total of 85 locomotives were built between 1967 and 1981, and , 25 locomotives remain in service. ==Variants== A total of 85 locomotives were built between 1967 and 1981, divided into the following sub-classes. * Class DE15-0 * Class DE15-1000 * Class DE15-1500 * Class DE15-2050 * Class DE15-2500 * Class DE15-2550 ==Design== The Class DE15 was developed from the Class DE10 locomotive design, with the addition of separate two-axle snowplough units at either end. The snowplough units could be attached and detached relatively easily, allowing the locomotives to be used for shunting and other duties outside the winter periods, unlike the snowplough units on the earlier Class DD15 locomotives, which were mounted directly onto the locomotives and required a crane to be attached and detached. ==History== ===DE15-0=== Six Class DE15-0 locomotives were built between 1967 and 1969 by Kisha and Nippon Sharyo. The locomotives were based on the Class DE10-0 design and were equipped with a engine and train-heating steam generator. Locomotive DE15 3 had a snowplough unit designed for clearing single-track lines, while the other five locomotives were designed for clearing double-track lines. Initially, the locomotives operated with only one snowplough unit, but locomotives DE15 1 to 3 and 6 were subsequently modified with snowplough units at both ends. DE15 3 was renumbered DE15 2053. , no Class DE15-0 locomotives remain in service. ===DE15-1000=== Six Class DE15-1000 locomotives were built between 1971 and 1973 by Nippon Sharyo using the DML61ZB engine uprated to . Locomotive DE15 1002 had a snowplough unit designed for clearing single-track lines, while the other five locomotives were designed for clearing double-track lines. Initially, the locomotives operated with only one snowplough unit, but locomotives DE15 1002, 1004, and 1006 were subsequently modified with snowplough units at both ends. DE15 1002 was renumbered DE15 2052. Type for clearing double-track lines, fitted with engine and train-heating steam generator. , no Class DE15-1000 locomotives remain in service. ===DE15-1500=== 18 Class DE15-1500 locomotives were initially built, initially with a snowplough unit at only one end. Locomotives DE15 1501 to 1504, 1507, 1509 to 1512, 1514 to 1516, and 1518 were designed for clearing double-track lines, while the others were designed for single- track lines. Like the DE15-1000, these locomotives were equipped with a engine, but had no train-heating steam generator. From 1976, a further batch of locomotives was built by Kawasaki Heavy Industries and Nippon Sharyo with snowplough units at both ends and designed for clearing double-track lines. , 15 Class DE15-1500 locomotives remain in service, operated by JR Hokkaido (nine locomotives), JR East (two locomotive), and JR West (four locomotive).

The locomotives were equipped with a engine and no train-heating steam generator. , eight Class DE15-2500 locomotives remain in service, operated by JR Hokkaido (five locomotives) and JR West (three locomotives). File:DE15 2525 Toyooka Station.jpg|JR West DE15 2525 in July 2010 ===DE15-2550=== Five Class DE15-2500 locomotives were formed by modifying Class DE15-1500 locomotives with the addition of a second snowplough unit at the other end. These were designed for clearing single- track lines. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Original number !!
