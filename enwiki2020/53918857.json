She then served as part of \"W\" Task Force where she served off the coast of Arakan, while participating in the Burma Campaign. LST-410 took part in Operation Dracula, the retaking of Rangoon, Operation Zipper, the retaking of Malaya, and Operation Tiderace, the retaking of Singapore. She then provided relief work repatriating ex-POWs of the Japanese after the war. LST-410 saw no active service in the United States Navy. The tank landing ship was struck from the Navy list on 26 February 1946. She was returned to United States Navy custody and decommissioned on 16 March 1946. On 13 February 1948, LST-410 was sold to Bosey, Philippines, and subsequently scrapped. == See also == * List of United States Navy LSTs == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * ==External links== * Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1942 ships Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the Royal Navy Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United Kingdom Category:S3-M2-K2 ships ",
