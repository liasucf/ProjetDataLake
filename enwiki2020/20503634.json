Similar to the Dutch band Focus, \u00deursaflokkurinn combined rock music with influences of classical music and jazz, enhancing their sound by adding elements of Scandinavian folk music and sometimes eccentric vocals resembling the Rock in Opposition work of, for instance, the Swedish band Samla Mammas Manna. Since their foundation in Reykjav\u00edk in 1978, the group consisted of Egill \u00d3lafsson (vocals, keyboards) and acoustic guitar, guitarist \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur Arnason, bassoonist R\u00fanar Vilbergsson, bassist T\u00f3mas Magnus T\u00f3masson and drummer \u00c1sgeir \u00d3skarsson. Between 1978 and 1980, the band mainly played progressive rock with influences of folk, psychedelic and jazz rock. Most of the songs are based on Icelandic folk songs; especially the debut album includes many traditional folk tunes which all have been turned into a progressive rock arrangement. The second album \u00deursabit has more psychedelic influences than the 'folkier' debut album and also features more prominent keyboards, for example the Hammond organ (played by the newly recruited keyboarder Karl Sighvatsson) and the electric piano. The band's 1980 tour is documented by the live album \u00c1 hlj\u00f3mleikum and imports jazz influences into the band's music. A punk rock track at the end of the album became a popular and well-known song in Iceland. The fourth album of the band, G\u00e6ti eins veri\u00f0... from 1982, showed a completely new style, the new wave music. The acoustic instruments were nearly completely substituted by synthesizers; keyboarder Karl Sighvattson and bassoonist R\u00fanar Vilbergsson had left the band. After some recording sessions for a new album in 1983 and 1984, the band split. One reason was that the band's success did not progress to countries other than Iceland. Egill \u00d3lafsson started working as a writer and was a member in the band Stu\u00f0menn in which other \u00deursaflokkurinn musicians were also playing. Sometimes the band met again for one-off performances, for example for the memorial for Karl Sighvattson, who died in 1991. For their 30th anniversary in February 2008, all the albums were reissued in a mini- vinyl-box with a CD full of previously unissued tracks and live versions. In addition there is a tour going through Iceland since early 2008 with the small orchestra Cap\u00fat; a live CD-DVD was issued in late November 2008 with the title \u00cd H\u00f6llinni \u00c1 \u00deorra 2008. == Discography == * Hinn \u00edslenzki \u00deursaflokkur (1978) * \u00deursabit (1979) * \u00c1 hlj\u00f3mleikum (1980) * G\u00e6ti eins veri\u00f0...
