    "text": "Emaj\u00f5gi (; meaning \"Mother River\") is a river in Estonia which flows from Lake V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv through Tartu County into Lake Peipsi, crossing the city of Tartu for 10 km. It has a length of 100 km. The Emaj\u00f5gi is sometimes called the Suur Emaj\u00f5gi (\"Great Emaj\u00f5gi\"), in contrast with the V\u00e4ike Emaj\u00f5gi (\"Little Emaj\u00f5gi\"), another river which flows into the southern end of Lake V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv. Emaj\u00f5gi is the second largest river in Estonia by discharge and the only fully navigable river. ==Course== The source of Emaj\u00f5gi is at the northeastern shore of V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv at Rannu-J\u00f5esuu, from where the river follows a roughly eastward course towards Lake Peipsi. The course of Emaj\u00f5gi is divided into 3 distinct sections. dead link In the upper course, from V\u00f5rtsj\u00e4rv to K\u00e4revere bridge, the river flows through large, flat and marshy areas, which are part of Alam- Pedja Nature Reserve. In this heavily meandering section, Emaj\u00f5gi lacks a clearly defined floodplain \u2013 the flooded area spans several kilometres at times and has no definite borders. In the middle course from K\u00e4revere to Kavastu through Tartu, Emaj\u00f5gi follows a straighter course and flows in a clearly defined, shallow valley mostly a maximum of 10 m deep. The width of the valley in the middle course is 1\u20131.5 km; in Tartu, it narrows to 800 m. The narrowest section of the valley (400\u2013600 m) is located in the end of the middle course near Kavastu. In the lower course, the river flows through a swampy lowland \u2013 Emaj\u00f5e Suursoo \u2013 before emptying into Lake Peipsi at Praaga. The length of the river is . In 1927, its length was measured to be . This may have changed somewhat in the 1930s, when the river's meandering upper course was straightened to allow for easier navigation. ==History== A modern replica of the historic lodi The Emaj\u00f5gi has been widely used as a waterway and trade route for centuries. In the past, it has also been an obstacle for land transport between Northern and Southern Estonia, because the river flows in a low-lying and swampy valley. Of the few suitable locations for crossing the river, Tartu has the most favourable conditions. Due to its location on the crossing of land and water routes, Tartu became an important trading center in Ancient Estonia. In the 19th century, Emaj\u00f5gi was actively used for transporting different cargo to Tartu \u2013 firewood, timber, hay, fish, and so on. The main type of vessel used was the lodi, a small river barge or sailing ship adjusted for navigation on Lake Peipsi and Emaj\u00f5gi. Up to 200 barges were anchored in Tartu port at the time. The first steam paddler appeared on Emaj\u00f5gi in 1843; there were six by 1900. The last river barges disappeared by the mid-20th century. Several new ships were brought to the river in the Soviet era to continue navigation to Pskov, Piirissaar, among other destinations. Fast hydrofoils, which were first introduced in 1960s, operated daily on the Tartu-Pskov route. Traffic on the route ended in 1992. Though attempts have been made to restart it since 1997, it remains closed. ==Crossings== Arch Bridge) in Tartu J\u00e4nese railway bridge in Vorbuse. Emaj\u00f5gi is crossed by 10 bridges, the majority of them located in Tartu. The bridges are, in downstream order: *Rannu-J\u00f5esuu bridge at the source of Emaj\u00f5gi on Tartu\u2013Viljandi highway **Includes an old bridge currently reserved for pedestrians and local traffic and a new highway bridge completed in 2009. *K\u00e4revere bridge on Tartu\u2013Tallinn highway **Includes a closed old bridge and a new highway bridge completed in 1999. *J\u00e4nese railway bridge on Tallinn\u2013Tapa\u2013Tartu railway 7 km northwest of Tartu in Vorbuse *Kroonuaia bridge in Tartu *Vabadussild in Tartu **Vabadussild replaced the Raudsild in 2008. *Kaarsild \u2013 pedestrian bridge in Tartu *V\u00f5idu bridge in Tartu *Turusild \u2013 pedestrian bridge in Tartu *S\u00f5pruse bridge in Tartu *Ihaste bridge on the Tartu ring road, opened in 2015 *Luunja bridge on Tartu\u2013R\u00e4pina highway in Luunja In addition to the bridges, the only operating cable ferry in Estonia crosses the river at Kavastu, about downstream of Luunja bridge. ==References== Category:Rivers of Estonia Category:Landforms of Tartu County Category:Tartu ",
