    "text": "Mars Cars is an Apple II maze game written by David Husch and published by Datamost in 1982. ==Gameplay== The player maneuvers a car to collect four treasures--one in each corner of the screen--while avoiding computer- controlled Mars Cars (which look more like aliens than vehicles). Getting touched by a Mars Car results in loss of a life. The player's car is allowed to drive through and remove the barriers making up the maze, but Mars Cars cannot. When all treasures are collected, the player can start the next level by driving into the warp area on the right side of the screen. There are sixteen levels. ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Apple II-only games Category:Maze games Category:Video games developed in the United States ",
