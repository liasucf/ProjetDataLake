    "text": "Raja is a genus of skates in the family Rajidae containing 16 species. Formerly a wastebasket genus, many species historically placed here have been moved to other genera in the family, such as Amblyraja, Beringraja, Dipturus, Leucoraja and Rostroraja. Raja are flat-bodied, cartilaginous fish with a rhombic shapes due to their large pectoral fins extending from or nearly from the snouts to the bases of their tails. Their sharp snouts are produced by a cranial projection of rostral cartilage. The mouth and gills are located on underside of the body. They may be either solid-coloured or patterned, and most skates have spiny or thorn-like structures on the upper surface, and some species contain weak electrical organs within their tails. Mating typically occurs in the spring and the female lays numerous eggs per clutch which are encapsulated in leathery cases, commonly known as \"mermaid\u2019s purses\". Species vary in size, ranging from about in length. These bottom-dwellers are active during both day and night, and typically feed on molluscs, crustaceans and fish. Raja skates are found in the East Atlantic, including the Mediterranean, and western Indian Ocean, ranging from relatively shallow water to a depth of . Skates and related species have fossil records dating from the Upper Cretaceous period, thus this well adapted species is quite ancient. ==Species== There are currently 16 species in this genus: * Raja africana Capap\u00e9, 1977 (African skate) * Raja asterias Delaroche, 1809 (Mediterranean starry ray) * Raja brachyura Lafont, 1873 (blonde ray) * Raja clavata Linnaeus, 1758 (thornback ray) * Raja eglanteria L.
