    "text": "Hounslow London Borough Council is the local authority for the London Borough of Hounslow in Greater London, England. It is a London borough council, one of 32 in the United Kingdom capital of London. ==History== A map showing the wards of Hounslow since 2002 There have previously been a number of local authorities responsible for the Hounslow area. The current local authority was first elected in 1964, a year before formally coming into its powers and prior to the creation of the London Borough of Hounslow on 1 April 1965. Hounslow replaced the Municipal Borough of Brentford and Chiswick, the Municipal Borough of Heston and Isleworth and Feltham Urban District. It was envisaged through the London Government Act 1963 that Hounslow as a London local authority would share power with the Greater London Council. The split of powers and functions meant that the Greater London Council was responsible for \"wide area\" services such as fire, ambulance, flood prevention, and refuse disposal; with the local authorities responsible for \"personal\" services such as social care, libraries, cemeteries and refuse collection. As an outer London borough council it has been an education authority since 1965. This arrangement lasted until 1986 when Hounslow London Borough Council gained responsibility for some services that had been provided by the Greater London Council, such as waste disposal. Since 2000 the Greater London Authority has taken some responsibility for highways and planning control from the council, but within the English local government system the council remains a \"most purpose\" authority in terms of the available range of powers and functions. ==Powers and functions== The local authority derives its powers and functions from the London Government Act 1963 and subsequent legislation. Hounslow has the powers and functions of a London borough council. It is a billing authority collecting Council Tax and business rates, it processes local planning applications, it is responsible for housing, waste collection and environmental health. It is a local education authority, responsible for social services, libraries and waste disposal. The council shares responsibility with the Greater London Authority for strategic policies including housing, planning and the environment. ==Finances== Hounslow London Borough Council is the billing authority for Council Tax, and collects a precepts on behalf of the Mayor's Office for Policing and Crime, the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority the Greater London Authority and Transport for London. ==See also== *Hounslow local elections *Thamesbank Credit Union ==References== ==External links == *London Borough of Hounslow website Category:Local authorities in London Category:London borough councils Category:Politics of the London Borough of Hounslow Category:Leader and cabinet executives Category:Local education authorities in England Category:Billing authorities in England ",
