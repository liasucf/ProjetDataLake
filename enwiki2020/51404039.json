He was head of the Third Bureau of the Ustasha Surveillance Service (), and was also a member of the Main Usta\u0161e Headquarters, one of the two main deputies of Paveli\u0107. == Murder of Toni \u0160legel == On 22 March 1929, Babi\u0107 and Matija Soldina murdered Toni Schlegel, the chief editor of Novosti and president of Jugoslovenska \u0161tampa, in Zagreb. At that time, Babi\u0107 was a chauffeur for the Siemens plant in Zagreb and, according to official reports, he murdered one and wounded another of the policemen who came to arrest him, and managed to escape. Babi\u0107 fled to Italy where he stayed until Yugoslavias entry into World War II. Italian police considered Babi\u0107 a very dangerous man who was capable of the worst crimes. == Planning == While in Italy, Usta\u0161e spent years planning for a genocidal campaign in their native country and trained a small band of followers for a takeover. As early as 1932, Babi\u0107, as one of the propagandists of Paveli\u0107, had written: == Concentration camps == Babi\u0107 participated in preparations for the establishment of Danica concentration camp. At the end of May or beginning of June 1941, he went to Pag island, based on the order of Andrija Artukovi\u0107, where he established Slana concentration camp. Babi\u0107 also organized the Kru\u0161\u010dica concentration camp near Travnik. == Blagaj massacre == Babi\u0107 had an important role in the Blagaj massacre on 9 May 1941. Against Paveli\u0107s order, Babi\u0107 brought several trucks of Usta\u0161e from Zagreb to massacre 520 Serb peasants in the region of Kordun, where they had lived together with Croats for many centuries. == Killing of Serbs in Eastern Herzegovina == Organized by Babi\u0107, Ivo Heren\u010di\u0107, Jure Franceti\u0107 and other Usta\u0161e officers, killings of Serbs were extensive in Eastern Herzegovina. In June 1941, Babi\u0107 and a group of Usta\u0161e officers, based on the order of Andrija Artukovi\u0107, went to Herzegovina to organize killings of its Serb population. On 16 or 17 June 1941, Babi\u0107 came to \u010capljina. He and other Usta\u0161e commanders had been instructed to suppress rebellions and undertake the complete extermination of the Serb population of the region and settle people from other parts who would be loyal to the Usta\u0161e movement. == June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina == Babi\u0107 and a group of Usta\u0161e officers were organizing a struggle against rebels during the June 1941 uprising in eastern Herzegovina.

Babi\u0107 held the rank of Major at the time of his death.: \"He held the rank of Ustasha major when he was killed in Bcrkovici near Stolac, Herzegovina, on 3 July 1941 \" His body was transported through Sarajevo to Zagreb where Paveli\u0107 ordered eight days of mourning for members of his Bodyguard Battalion. A newspaper in Croatia dedicated a whole page to Babi\u0107's \"heroic\" death in a battle against \"Serbian Chetniks\".: \"Most of page five of the paper was dedicated to the death and funeral of an Ustasha officer, Mijo Babic, who had died \"heroically\" on July 3, 1941, in a battle with \"Serbian Chetniks.\" The Chetniks were originally irregular army units that played ...\" == References == == Sources == * * * * * * * * * * * * * Category:1903 births Category:1941 deaths Category:People from Nova Bukovica Category:People from the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia Category:Usta\u0161e Category:Croatian people of World War II Category:Independent State of Croatia Category:Croatian exiles Category:Anti-Serbian sentiment ",
