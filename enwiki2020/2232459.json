This includes locales in the Modoc Plateau, southern Cascade Range, Klamath Mountains, and northern Sierra Nevada.Jepson Manual, University of California It is slow-growing in the wild, and is mostly restricted to sites difficult for plant growth, on serpentine soils and on old lava flows. Its tolerance of these sites enables it to avoid competition from much faster-growing trees. It is found in chaparral and Yellow pine forest habitats. Cupressus bakeri trunk and bark of a juvenile tree ==Description== Cupressus bakeri\u2212Hesperocyparis bakeri is an evergreen tree with a conic crown, growing to heights of (exceptionally to 39 meters\u2212130 feet), and a trunk diameter of up to 50 cm (20 inches) (exceptionally to 1 meter\u201440 inches). The foliage grows in sparse, very fragrant, usually pendulous sprays, varying from dull gray-green to glaucous blue-green in color. The leaves are scale-like, 2\u20135 mm long, and produced on rounded (not flattened) shoots.Pinetum Photos, trees The seed cones are globose to oblong, covered in warty resin glands, 10\u201325 mm long, with 6 or 8 (rarely 4 or 10) scales, green to brown at first, maturing gray or gray-brown about 20\u201324 months after pollination. The male cones are 3\u20135 mm long, and release pollen in February\u2013March.Pinetum Photos, cones The cones often remain closed for several years, only opening after the parent tree is killed in a wildfire, thereby allowing the seeds to colonize the bare ground exposed by the natural fire. ==Conservation== Fire suppression policies of the past decades have severely limited reproduction of this fire dependent species. It is listed as an IUCN Red List vulnerable species. \\- Listed as Vulnerable (VU B1+2bcd v2.3) ==See also== *Fire ecology * *List of plants on the Modoc National Forest *Milo Samuel Baker * ==References== ==External links== *CalFlora Database: Hesperocyparis bakeri (Baker's cypress) *Jepson Manual eFlora (JM2) treatment of Hesperocyparis bakeri *USDA Plants Profile for Hesperocyparis bakeri (Modoc cypress) *Gymnosperm Database: Cupressus bakeri *photo of herbarium specimen at Missouri Botanical Garden, collected in 1934 in Siskiyou County, California *UC Calphotos Photos Gallery: Hesperocyparis bakeri bakeri Category:Flora of California Category:Flora of Oregon Category:Endemic flora of the United States Category:Trees of the Northwestern United States Category:Trees of the Southwestern United States Category:Flora of the Cascade Range Category:Flora of the Klamath Mountains Category:Natural history of the California chaparral and woodlands ~ ~ ~ Category:Plants described in 1909 Category:Taxa named by Willis Linn Jepson ",
