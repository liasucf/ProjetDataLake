Mike Hale of The New York Times noted that the caliber of production was above that of contemporary regular network television film and on par with Syfy and USA Network productions. Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club posted a very negative review, describing the film as \"deeply stupid\". However, at the 3rd Streamy Awards, Peregrym won Best Female Performance \u2013 Drama, and the series had three other nominations.
