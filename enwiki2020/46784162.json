    "text": "French Pete Creek is a tributary of the South Fork McKenzie River in Lane County, in the U.S. state of Oregon. It flows generally west through the Three Sisters Wilderness to the south end of Cougar Reservoir, about from the larger river's confluence with the McKenzie River. The creek has two named tributaries\u2014Olallie Creek and, further downstream, Pat Creek\u2014both of which enter from the right. The stream derives its name from an early-day shepherd who grazed his flock along the valley. The shepherd's last name is unknown. French Pete Trail, which crosses the stream twice, runs along the creek's valley. The trail begins near French Creek Campground, at the confluence of the creek with the river. Campground amenities include 17 tent, car, and trailer sites, picnic tables, vault toilets, and drinking water. The campground is generally open from early April to mid-September. In the 1970s, environmentalists and timber interests clashed over a \"substantial stand of young timber with a high potential value at maturity\" along the creek, according to Oregon Geographic Names. In 1978, most of the French Pete Creek valley was added to the Three Sisters Wilderness. ==See also== *List of rivers of Oregon ==References== ==External links== * McKenzie Watershed Council Category:Rivers of Lane County, Oregon Category:Rivers of Oregon ",
