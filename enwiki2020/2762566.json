    "text": "\"1 Thing\" is a song by American singer Amerie from her second studio album, Touch (2005). Written by Amerie and Rich Harrison and produced by the latter, the song is influenced by go-go rhythms and features a prominent sample of the Meters' 1970 funk recording of \"Oh, Calcutta!\", written by Stanley Walden. Its lyrics focus on an unidentified \"thing\" that fuels a romantic attraction. The song was released as the album's lead single in 2005, and is the only single from the soundtrack to the 2005 romantic comedy film Hitch. \"1 Thing\" received acclaim from critics, and peaked at number eight on the Billboard Hot 100 and number four in the United Kingdom, becoming Amerie's first top-10 single and her biggest singles to date, also peaking at number one on the US R&B; singles chart. Its digital download and ringtone releases were each certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). A remix of \"1 Thing\" features rapper Eve. The song earned Amerie a nomination for Best Female R&B; Vocal Performance at the 2006 Grammy Awards, and was also nominated for Choice R&B;/Hip-Hop Track at the 2005 Teen Choice Awards. It was later named the 22nd and 25th best song of the 2000s decade by Rolling Stone and Robert Christgau, respectively. ==Conception== In 2004, when working on her second album, Amerie enlisted the services of producer Rich Harrison, who had helped produce and write her first album. In May 2004, Harrison heard \"Oh, Calcutta!\" for the first time and began working on the beat accompanying the ten-second back-and- forth breakdown between Meters drummer Ziggy Modeliste and guitarist Leo Nocentelli. Harrison said he loved the work of the Meters, especially Modeliste, commenting, \"Ziggy, he's crazy.\" He processed the way the breakdown could be \"flipped\", added a bongo drum, a cowbell, and a ride cymbal, and sent it to Amerie. According to Harrison, they wrote and finished the song in two to three hours. Amerie's manager, Len Nicholson, felt the song was \"the single\" to release. When executives at Amerie's label, Columbia/Sony Urban Music, heard \"1 Thing\", they felt that the song's choruses needed to be \"bigger\". They recommended that more music be added to the percussion-focused beat, but Harrison and Amerie replied that adding more to the beat would overpower the song.Ratcliffe, Fahiym. \"Amerie: The Interview\". Sun Reporter, volume 62, issue 19, page 4. May 12, 2005. Harrison and Amerie returned to the studio several times to rework the track. Each time they submitted a new version to the label, Columbia told them that the song sounded unfinished, but was unable to specify what should be changed. The label continued to refuse to release \"1 Thing\"; in Amerie's words, \"People just weren't getting it\". Later in 2004, six months after recording \"1 Thing\", Amerie and Harrison leaked it to US radio stations in an attempt to get it released officially. The response from DJs and listeners was positive, and it consequently received airplay across the country. Columbia Records attempted to suppress the song because it was an unofficial release, and because Jennifer Lopez (another artist on the label) had expressed interest in recording the song for her own album, Rebirth.Shipley, Al. \"Amerie \u2013 Touch\" . Stylus Magazine. May 13, 2005. Radio stations refused to retract the song from their playlists, and Columbia eventually began promoting \"1 Thing\" as a single, making it a last-minute addition to the Hitch soundtrack. Lopez settled on another Harrison-produced, funk-infused track, the Usher outtake \"Get Right\". ==Theme and sound== \"1 Thing\" was produced by Harrison and is built around a sample of the Meters' 1970 version of the theme song from the musical Oh! Calcutta!, \"Oh, Calcutta!\", written by Stanley Walden. Built around The Meters' funky beat- driven percussion, \"1 Thing\" finds Amerie lamenting an aspect of a relationship that keeps her satisfied. Even if other factors are less than positive, there is one thing that keeps her hooked (\"It's this one thing that's got me trippin'\"). Amerie said that the inspiration for the song came from a conversation she had with Harrison \"about relationships and how there's always one thing that keeps you attracted to someone. No matter what they do or how they act, there's that one undeniable thing that keeps you coming back.\"Hall, Rashaun. \"Amerie Growing Up But Keeping Her Clothes On, Thank You\". MTV News. February 3, 2005. She told Blender that the \"one thing\" \"could be bringing flowers, or something more ... physical. People think I'm just this good girl, but there are other sides they don't see.\" Despite being based on a New Orleans funk sample, the song belies a strong go-go influence. Harrison likened the two based on their heavy use of percussion and chant. Amerie stated, \"You don't hear go-go outside of D.C. ... I was like, 'We have to do it in an up-tempo way because when you hear it on the radio in D.C., it's fast.' ... So it's a fresh sound for everybody but people in the D.C./Maryland/Virginia area.
