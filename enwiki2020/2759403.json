    "text": "The Miracles were the Motown Record Corporation's first group and its first million-selling recording artists. During their nineteen-year run on the American music charts, The Miracles charted over fifty hits and recorded in the genres of doo wop, soul, disco, and R&B.; Twenty-six Miracles songs reached the Top Ten of the Billboard R&B; singles chart, including four R&B; number ones. Sixteen of the Miracles' songs charted within the Top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100, with seven of those songs reaching the Top Ten and two \u2013 1970's \"The Tears of a Clown\" and 1975's \"Love Machine\" (Part 1) \u2013 reaching number-one. A third song,the million-selling \"Shop Around\", reached #1 on the Cash Box magazine Top 100 Pop chart. The Miracles also scored 11 U.S. R&B; Top 10 Albums, including 2-#1's . According to several websites, the Miracles are one of the most oft-covered groups in recorded history and the most covered Motown group ever. Their music and songs have influenced artists all over the world \u2013 in every major musical genre \u2013 over the last 50 years . At # 32, The Miracles are the highest-ranking Motown group on Rolling Stone Magazine's list of \"The 100 Greatest Artists of All Time.\" They also have the distinction of having more songs inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame than any other Motown group.List of The Miracles awards and achievements#Grammy Hall of Fame (Original lineup: Claudette Rogers Robinson, Bobby Rogers, Ronnie White, Smokey Robinson, Marv Tarplin, Pete Moore) . All releases were on Motown Records' Tamla subsidiary label unless otherwise indicated. In the 1960s, Motown Record Corporation, like many independent labels, did not register sales figures through the RIAA, the organization that certifies and awards Gold Records. So it is difficult to determine the full number of Miracles songs and recordings that sold a million or more records. Also, with the passing of decades of time, some songs that did not sell a million records on their initial release may have indeed done so over the years. However, several reference works, such as the books Hits Of The Sixties: The Million Sellers by Demitri Coryton & Joseph Murrells, as well as The Book Of Golden Discs by Joseph Murrells, point out that the Miracles had several million- selling records during their career, including the following: \"Shop Around\" (1961), \"You've Really Got a Hold on Me\" (1962), \"Mickey's Monkey\" (1963), \"The Tracks Of My Tears\" (1965), \"Going To A Go-Go\", (single and album) (1965), \"I Second That Emotion\" (1967), \"Baby Baby Don't Cry\" (1969), \"The Tears of a Clown\"* (1970), \"Do It Baby\" (1974), \"Love Machine\"* (1975), and the platinum album City Of Angels (1975). This is quite probably an incomplete list, since Miracle Pete Moore states on his corporate website, that The Miracles actually had 12 gold records to their credit by 1967, including 1965's \"Ooo Baby Baby\". * multi-million sellers. * Note:The Miracles' 2006 DVD release The Definitive Performances (1963\u20131987) was also certified Gold by the R.I.A.A. ==Albums== ===The Miracles=== ;Tamla (Motown) releases: {|class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Year !rowspan=\"2\"|Album !colspan=\"2\"|Peak chart positions |- !US !US R&B; |- |rowspan=\"2\"|1961 |Hi...
