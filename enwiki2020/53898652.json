    "text": "Iddi-Ilum, shakkanakku of Mari\", using the Sumerian: , \u0161agina, on the Statue of Iddi-Ilum. In the Akkadian language Shakkanakku (Sumerian: , GIR.NITA or \u0161agina, ), was a title designating a military governor. Mari was ruled by a dynasty of hereditary Shakkanakkus which was originally set by the Akkadian Empire and gained independence following Akkad's collapse. It is considered that the Shakkanakka gained some form of independence and came to be considered as \"Kings\" from the time of Apil-Kin. A critical analysis of the Shakkanakku List of Mari has been published. The title is also known around the same time in Elam, where several \"Shakkanakku (Military Governor) of the country of Elam\" with typically Akkadian names ruled for the Akkadian kings.Translation into French in The title also existed in Qatna in the 14th century BC, and Dilmun under the Kassites. ==Shakkanakkus under the Akkadians== Shakkanakkus, or Shagina military governors are known from the time of the Akkadian Empire. For example, Shar-kali-sharri had a military governor in Nippur taking charge of the construction of the temple of Enlil. One of his year names reads: \"Year in which Szarkaliszarri appointed Puzur- Esztar the shagina (general)\" to build the temple of Enlil \"Year Szarkaliszarri appointed Puzur-Eshtar, the shagina, to build the temple of Enlil\".Douglas Frayne, Sargonic and Gutian periods, RIME E2.1.5, p.184 ==Main Shakkanakkus of Mari== Several Shakkanakkus of Mari are known from archaeological artifacts: File:Ishtup-Ilum statue (front, wider).jpg|Statue of Ishtup-Ilum, Shakkanakku of Mari.
