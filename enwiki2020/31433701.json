Records discography accessed April 8, 2011 ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden awarded the album 2 stars stating \"the forgettable sound of the electric harpsichord (an instrument that thankfully didn't catch on, contrary to liner note writer Stanley Dance's prediction that it was here to stay along with earlier electronic instruments) keeps this release from achieving the heights it would have if Jones had only stuck to the piano throughout the sessions. This disc will be sought only by those fans who must have everything Hank Jones has recorded\".Dryden, K.
