He then played for Buymore FC between 2005 and 2007. He then joined CAPS United F.C. from 2008 to 2011. He then went on to join the Moroka Swallows of South Africa, where he signed a three year deal. He was part of the Moroka Swallows team which finished second in the local Premiership for the 2011-12 season, and which won The MTN8 in 2012. Mapemba's contract with Moroka Swallows was not renewed because of the \"5 foreign player policy\" in the South African Premier Soccer League, as the team wanted to add foreign strikers. He currently is a free agent.http://www.soccerwiki.org/player.php?pid=59603 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Living people Category:1985 births Category:Zimbabwean footballers Category:Zimbabwe international footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:CAPS United players Category:Expatriate soccer players in South Africa Category:Moroka Swallows F.C. players ",
