    "text": "The third season of Saturday Night Live, an American sketch comedy series, originally aired in the United States on NBC between September 24, 1977, and May 20, 1978. The DVD set of the entire season was released on May 13, 2008. ==Cast== Prior to the start of the season, two new cast members were added as featured cast members which were comedy duo Tom Davis and Al Franken. Meanwhile Dan Aykroyd joined Jane Curtin as an anchor for Weekend Update becoming the first Weekend Update anchor team. This would be the final season that the cast was called \"The Not Ready for Primetime Players\". ===Cast=== The Not Ready for Prime Time Players *Dan Aykroyd *John Belushi *Jane Curtin *Garrett Morris *Bill Murray *Laraine Newman *Gilda Radner Featured players *Tom Davis *Al Franken bold denotes Weekend Update anchor ==Behind the scenes== In the \"Anyone Can Host\" episode\u2014for which a contest found a non- celebrity to host the show\u2014the musical guest, Elvis Costello, halted his band, the Attractions, seven seconds into the song \"Less Than Zero\", launching into \"Radio Radio\", an as-yet unreleased song critical of mainstream broadcasting. (The Sex Pistols were originally booked to appear on the show, but were denied visas to enter America.) The change angered Lorne Michaels, who banned future appearances on the show for a while. Costello would not be invited back to the show until 1989. Chevy Chase hosted during the season, making him the first cast member to host after leaving the show. Right before the end-of-the-show onstage goodbyes, a heated argument broke out backstage between Chase and relatively new cast member Bill Murray. After several insults were exchanged (including Chase's referencing Murray's acne-scarred skin and Murray calling Chase a \"medium talent\"), the two men had a violent fistfight. Although by most accounts the scuffle had been at least partially instigated by John Belushi, he was the one (along with Dan Aykroyd) who pulled apart Murray and Chase only moments before the entire cast regrouped in front of the live cameras. Chase would host the show several times throughout the show's history, though he feuded with the cast and crew. ==Writers== Tom Davis and Al Franken got prominent amounts of screen time. Brian Doyle-Murray and Don Novello joined the writing staff. Michael O'Donoghue temporarily left the show. This season's writers were Dan Aykroyd, Anne Beatts, Tom Davis, Jim Downey, Brian Doyle-Murray, Al Franken, Neil Levy, Lorne Michaels, Marilyn Suzanne Miller, Don Novello, Michael O'Donoghue, Herb Sargent, Tom Schiller, Rosie Schuster and Alan Zweibel. The head writer, like the previous season, was Michael O'Donoghue. ==Episodes== ==Home media== Season 3 was released on DVD May 13, 2008. ==References== 03 Category:Saturday Night Live in the 1970s Category:1977 American television seasons Category:1978 American television seasons ",
