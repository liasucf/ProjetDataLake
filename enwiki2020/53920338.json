Having played as a centre forward in the earlier years of his youth career, McTominay converted to a central midfield role under Warren Joyce. He signed his first professional contract in July 2013. He made seven appearances for the Under-18s between 2013 and 2015, but struggled due to his small size. McTominay missed most of the 2014\u201315 season due to injuries relating to growth and development issues, growing 14 inches within two years. McTominay struggled again during the 2015\u201316 season, making 11 appearances across the Under-19s and Under-21s, but commanded a place in the team the following season with three goals in 21 games prior to his senior call-up. ====2016\u201317 season==== On 30 April 2017, McTominay was named on the substitutes bench for a match against Swansea City in the Premier League.

He made his European debut on 18 October, against Benfica, coming on for Henrikh Mkhitaryan in injury-time, winning a free-kick and getting Luis\u00e3o sent off before seeing out the 1\u20130 away win. Two days later, McTominay signed a new contract with United, keeping him at the club until June 2021, with an option to extend for a further year. He made his first start of the season on 24 October, in a 2\u20130 win over Swansea at Liberty Stadium in the EFL Cup fourth round. ====2018\u201319 season==== On 21 January 2019, McTominay signed a contract extension, keeping him at United until 2023, with the option of another year. Replacing the injured Nemanja Mati\u0107, his first start of real significance under the management of Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r was against Liverpool on 24 February.

On 27 October, McTominay scored United's 2,000th Premier League goal in a 3\u20131 victory against Norwich City at Carrow Road. McTominay was credited with another goal, scored against Brighton on 10 November, after United successfully appealed to a Premier League panel that it should not be designated as an own goal by Davy Pr\u00f6pper. McTominay suffered a knee ligament injury on 26 December, which prevented him from playing for two months. He resumed full training on 19 February 2020. On 27 February, McTominay scored his first European goal in United's UEFA Europa League Round of 32 second leg match against Club Brugge, with United winning 5\u20130 (6\u20131 on aggregate).

McTominay attended training camps with the Scottish youth sides. In November 2017, McTominay told Scottish Football Association performance director Malky Mackay that he wanted to concentrate on securing a place in the Manchester United first-team. Speaking in February 2018, club manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho suggested that new Scotland manager Alex McLeish should select McTominay \"because it looks like England is missing him\". McTominay pledged his future to Scotland and was selected in their squad for two friendlies in March. Later that month, McTominay's grandfather revealed Sir Alex Ferguson wanted him to represent Scotland. Manchester United academy coach Brian McClair explained \"McLeish made a huge effort getting to Carrington to meet up with him, because it was in the middle of the bad weather that we had. He made it, put a case. Gareth Southgate sent him a text.\" McTominay said of the conversation with McLeish, \"He travelled a hell of a long way to come and speak with me and I have to thank him for that. The conversation we had was relatively simple. I wanted to play for Scotland and I always have done since I was a young boy and it was an incredibly proud moment for me when he did call me up and hopefully I can kick on and do well.\"\"Scott McTominay Interview | Scotland v Costa Rica\" Scotland National Team, 20 March 2018 On 23 March, McTominay was one of four players to be given their international debuts in McLeish's first game in charge. He played the first 57 minutes in a 1\u20130 friendly defeat to Costa Rica before being replaced by Stuart Armstrong. He made his first competitive appearance for Scotland in September 2018, as a 79th minute substitute for Callum McGregor in a 2\u20130 win against Albania. In November 2019 he was one of three Scotland players to withdraw from the national squad due to injury. For the international games played in September 2020, McTominay was used as a centre-back in a three-man defence. The Times commented that McTominay had the physique needed for the position, but had struggled to adapt to the role. He continued in this role during the October 2020 internationals, and the Daily Record said that there were indications that his play had improved. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|FA Cup !colspan=\"2\"|EFL Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=5|Manchester United |2016\u201317 |Premier League |2||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||0||2||0 |- |2017\u201318 |Premier League |13||0||3||0||3||0||4||0||0||0||23||0 |- |2018\u201319 |Premier League |16||2||3||0||0||0||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014||22||2 |- |2019\u201320 |Premier League |27||4||2||0||1||0||7||1||colspan=2|\u2014||37||5 |- |2020\u201321 |Premier League |3||0||0||0||1||1||1||0||colspan=2|\u2014||5||1 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !61!!6!!8!!0!!5!!1!!15!!1!!0!!0!!89!!8 |} ===International=== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center |+ Appearances and goals by national team and year |- !National team!!Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |rowspan=3|Scotland |2018||5||0 |- |2019||7||0 |- |2020||5||0 |- !colspan=2|Total!!17!!0 |} ==Honours== ===Club=== Manchester United *FA Cup runner-up: 2017\u201318http://www.thefa.com/news/2018/may/19/fa-cup-final-chelsea-manchester- united-190518 ==See also== *List of Scotland international footballers born outside Scotland ==References== ==External links== * * * *Profile at ManUtd.com * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:English people of Scottish descent Category:Sportspeople from Lancaster, Lancashire Category:Scottish footballers Category:English footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Premier League players Category:Scotland international footballers ",
