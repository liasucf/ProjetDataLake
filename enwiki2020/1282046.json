    "text": "Freak Kitchen is an experimental rock band from Gothenburg, Sweden, formed in 1992. == History == Freak Kitchen's style of music is influenced by many genres besides the traditional heavy metal, ranging from jazz to pop. The band described their third album as \"A corny little heavy-pop-rock-Latin-world- jazz-avant-garde-metal-blues-record straight from hell!\". The album \"Land of the Freaks\", which was released in late October 2009, features Indian inspiration and the band is also joined by the two Indian musicians V. Selvaganesh and Neyveli S Radhakrishna on several tracks. The lyrics of Freak Kitchen often contain humor and criticism of capitalist society, conformity, racism and the attitude of major labels. Frontman Mattias Eklundh has a reputation as a guitar virtuoso, acknowledged by Guitar Player Magazine for instance, and live shows often contain parts where Eklundh plays the guitar using several foreign objects such as a vibrating dildo. Eklundh has also released four solo albums, Sensually Primitive (1996) (under the pseudonym Mr Libido), Freak Guitar (1999), Freak Guitar - The Road Less Traveled (2004) and Freak Guitar: The Smorgasbord (2013). They also co-headlined Fuel Great Indian Rock 2008 alongside Sahg and Satyricon. Their album, Cooking with Pagans, was released in 2014, with the first single, \"Professional Help\" released in November. The 2018 album Confusion To the Enemy contains a song with Swedish lyrics, called S\u00e5 Kan Det G\u00e5 N\u00e4r Inte Haspen \u00c4r P\u00e5 (which roughly translates to That's What Happens When You Don't Take Precautions) == Members == Current * Mattias \"IA\" Eklundh \u2013 vocals, guitar (1992\u2013present) * Christer \u00d6rtefors \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (2000\u2013present) * Bj\u00f6rn Fryklund \u2013 drums (2000\u2013present) Previous * Christian Gr\u00f6nlund \u2013 bass guitar, vocals (1992\u20132000) * Joakim Sj\u00f6berg \u2013 drums (1992\u20132000) == Discography == Albums * Appetizer (Thunderstruck Productions, 1994) * Spanking Hour (Thunderstruck Productions, 1996) * Freak Kitchen (Thunderstruck Productions, 1998) * Dead Soul Men (Thunderstruck Productions, 2000) * Move (Thunderstruck Productions, 2002) * Organic (Thunderstruck Productions, 2005) * Land of the Freaks (Thunderstruck Productions, 2009) * Cooking with Pagans (Thunderstruck Productions, 2014) * Confusion to the Enemy (Thunderstruck Productions, 2018) EPs * Junk Tooth (1997) == References == == External links == * Category:Musical groups established in 1992 Category:Swedish hard rock musical groups Category:Swedish heavy metal musical groups ",
