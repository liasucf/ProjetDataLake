The club competes in the A Lyga, the top flight of Lithuanian football. The club was founded as Dinamo in 1947. The club's name commemorates the victorious Battle of \u017dalgiris (Battle of Grunwald) (both names: \u017dalgiris and Grunwald are translated as \"green grove\"). \u017dalgiris has featured many Lithuanian football legends during their history, including Arminas Narbekovas, Valdas Ivanauskas, Edgaras Jankauskas and Deividas \u0160emberas. They have won the Lithuanian Championship 7 times, the Lithuanian Football Cup 12 times and the Lithuanian Supercup 6 times. The team's colours are green and white. The club plays at LFF stadium in Vilnius which has a capacity of 5,067. ==History== ===Foundation and Soviet period=== The first incarnation of the club played in 1946 as a national team of Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic when it competed in USSR Group III Zone 4 championship and it was one of the clubs which represented one of the Soviet republics. The club consisted of Spartakas Kaunas and Dinamo Kaunas players. Their first match was against Stroitel Moscow which ended 1\u20131 and they were managed by French coach Emil Pastor. That year they finished in fourth place in RSFSR Western Zone championship.Vytautas Saulis ir Gediminas Kalinauskas. \"Lietuvos futbolas, 1922\u20131997 m.: istorin\u0117 apybrai\u017ea\" // Vilnius, \"Diemedis\", 1997. 55 p. The club is thought to have been founded in 1947 when it was moved from Kaunas to Vilnius and its name was changed to Dinamo Vilnius.Vytautas Saulis ir Gediminas Kalinauskas. \"Lietuvos futbolas, 1922\u20131997 m.: istorin\u0117 apybrai\u017ea\" // Vilnius, \"Diemedis\", 1997. 53 p. First official match of the formed club was played on 16 May 1947 against Lokomotiv Moscow, who managed to defeat local team 1\u20132. Steponas Petraitis scored the first official goal for the club that day, beating goalkeeper from a penalty spot in 44th minute. The next year club changed its name to Spartakas Vilnius and used this name until the end of 1961 season. In 1962, they changed their name to \u017dalgiris. \u017dalgiris competed in Soviet Union football league system from 1947 to 1989. Team achieved its first promotion to the top tier in 1952, but came last next season. Before the start of the 1983 season in Soviet Top League, players initiative group demanded to resignation of coach Benjaminas Zelkevi\u010dius, players wish was satisfied, Algimantas Liubinskas became of trainer. Start was cautious. A similar result 0\u20130 has played in Tashkent with Pakhtakor, in Leningrad with Zenit, in Vilnius with Dynamo. In fourth match in season against Neftchi in Baku, Gra\u017eulis scored goal on 1\u20130 and brought victory. There were victories and failures, but \u017dalgiris became the winners of the first round. In first place \u017dalgiris stayed short, Nevertheless, final fifth place is the highest achievement of Lithuanian football on this time and gives a great hope for future. Arminas Narbekovas, Romas Ma\u017eeikis, and Vladimiras Buzmakovas succeeded in the team in that season.http://www.fkzalgiris.lt/naujienos/n5859_vilniaus_%E2%80%9Ezalgirio%E2%80%9C_istorija_meistru_komanda.html In 1984 Soviet Top League season, \u017dalgiris finished on 9 place among 18 teams, but rejoiced victories against FC Dynamo Kyiv (1\u20130 at home), FC Spartak Moscow (twice 2\u20131), FC Dynamo Moscow (1\u20130 at home, 2\u20131 in Moscow). and Valdas Ivanauskas debuted in first team. The club's most successful season was in 1987 when they finished third in the Soviet Top League and qualified for 1988\u201389 UEFA Cup where they played against Austria Wien, while also for the first time in club's history reaching semi\u2013finals of the 1987\u201388 Soviet Cup (after being eliminated in quarter-finals of the 1955, 1959\u201360, 1964 campaigns) and 1987 USSR Federation Cup. The club represented the Soviet Union at 1987 Summer Universiade which they won by defeating the South Korean team. In the following season they finished fifth and again qualified for UEFA Cup where they faced IFK G\u00f6teborg in the first round and Red Star Belgrade in the second. In 1988, several of \u017dalgiris players were decorated with medals in the USSR national teams: Vyacheslav Sukristov received silver medal of the UEFA Euro 1988, and Arminas Narbekovas and Arvydas Janonis brought back gold medals from the 1988 Summer Olympics. In 1989 the club finished in fourth place and for the third year in a row qualified for UEFA Cup. They managed to play one game in 1990 at the start of the season before withdrawing due to re- establishment of Lithuania's independence and joined the Baltic League which consisted of clubs from Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Therefore, they lost their place in UEFA Cup, which was taken by Chornomorets Odesa. ===1990\u20132007=== Following Lithuania's declaration of independence in 11 March 1990, \u017dalgiris has left Soviet Top League with immediate effect. Despite most of the top players including Arminas Narbekovas, Valdas Ivanauskas, Igoris Pankratjevas, Vyacheslav Sukristov and Robertas Fridrikas leaving the club \u017dalgiris remained favorites to clinch Lithuanian title and won A Lyga regular season having lost just once in 32 games. The championship, however, was decided by the knock-out competition where \u017dalgiris lost in the semi-finals to Ekranas Panev\u0117\u017eys and only managed to take a third place. Edgaras Jankauskas scored 41 goals in 93 matches with \u017dalgiris (1991\u20131996). Green and whites took their first A Lyga title the following season when they won the regular season, took the revenge against Ekranas beating them in the semi-finals and won the final against Lietuvos Makabi Vilnius 3\u20131 with Ri\u010dardas Zdan\u010dius scoring a hat-trick. \u017dalgiris completed the double later that year by winning the Lithuanian cup. The 1991 season was followed by two significant changes in league format: the knock-out competition was removed and league was reorganized to be played from autumn till spring. \u017dalgiris saw off the challenge from Panerys Vilnius to defend their title by a single point. There were no double in this year, however: Lietuvos Makabi took revenge for their defeat in last season's league final and beat \u017dalgiris in the final 1\u20130. In the summer of 1992, \u017dalgiris made their debut in the UEFA Champions League. Europe's elite proved to be merciless: PSV Eindhoven hammered \u017dalgiris 8\u20130 on aggregate in the first round. In 1992\u201393 season things went the other way round in national competitions: having lost the national title to FK Ekranas by three points \u017dalgiris reclaimed the cup, beating Sirijus Klaip\u0117da 1\u20130 in the final courtesy of the extra-time goal by Aurelijus Skarbalius. A similar story happened in the 1993\u201394 season when ROMAR Ma\u017eeikiai narrowly beat Vilnius' side to the title while \u017dalgiris defended the cup by beating FK Ekranas 4\u20132 in the final. Darius Maciulevi\u010dius was the hero of that day scoring a hat-trick and Aidas Preik\u0161aitis added another from the penalty spot. 1994\u201395 season delivered a double blow for the side from the capital. \u017dalgiris and Inkaras Kaunas finished the league locked on points at the top and extra match on neutral ground was set to be played. Inkaras Kaunas beat \u017dalgiris 2\u20130 in Panev\u0117\u017eys and four days later the same two teams met in Klaip\u0117da for cup final. Inkaras once again came out better off as former \u017dalgiris man Eimantas Poderis scored twice in a 2\u20131 victory for Kaunas' side. 1995\u201396 season did not bring silverware either: free scoring \u017dalgiris side racked up 106 goals in just 28 games in the league yet could only take a third place, six points behind champions Inkaras Kaunas. On this time Edgaras Jankauskas was top scorer A Lyga with 25 goals. He was later sold to CSKA Moscow. Things did not go well in the cup as well as Vilnius' side lost to Kareda \u0160iauliai in the semi-finals and failed to advance to the final for the first time in six years. \u017dalgiris reclaimed the cup in 1996\u201397 season as Donatas Vencevi\u010dius' penalty was enough to see off Inkaras in the final but had to settle for second in the league as Kareda coasted to the title with an 8-point margin. Green and whites mounted a stronger challenge in 1997\u201398 yet Kareda proved its success has been no fluke by defending their title. Deividas \u0160emberas started his career in \u017dalgiris (1996\u20131998) The elusive title finally came in 1998\u201399 season, the last one to be played from autumn till spring. Defense was the key to success as \u017dalgiris conceded just 8 goals in 23 games and did not lose a single league match that season. Things were different in the cup as Kareda dismantled \u017dalgiris 7\u20130 on aggregate in the semi-finals. The league title allowed \u017dalgiris to have another try in the UEFA Champions League and this time Vilnius' side eliminated Armenian champions Araks Ararat before succumbing to a defeat to last season's semi-finalists Dynamo Kiev in the second round. With a turn of the century a new force rose in Lithuanian football: FBK Kaunas. Under the name of \u017dalgiris Kaunas they won the transitional shortened league season in 1999 and then backed it up by consecutive titles in 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003 and 2004. \u017dalgiris on the other hand went into decline and cup final win in 2003 proved to be the sole piece of silverware for the club in the 2000s. In the league \u017dalgiris started to struggle as well. While in 1999 and 2000 green and whites finished second, 2001 saw them dropping to third, 2002 to fourth and 2005 to the recently unimaginable lows of eighth. \u017dalgiris was not even the strongest team in the capital as newcomers V\u0117tra and FC Vilnius were clearly having better time on the pitch. Despite a constant presence in European competitions the results there were rarely encouraging with the aggregate defeats like 2\u20137 to Ruch Chorzow and 0\u20137 to Maccabi Tel Aviv. Budapest Honved and Portadown were the only teams eliminated by \u017dalgiris between 2000 and 2004. 2005 UEFA Intertoto Cup thus stood out as a major success as green and whites went past three teams \u2013 Lisburn Distillery, Dinaburg and Egaleo, before being eliminated by CFR Cluj. ===2008\u2013present=== The struggles of the noughties culminated in 2008. The league finish of fifth could have been seen as adequate for the time (20 points gap to fourth-placed S\u016bduva was harder to take) but as country's economy braced for the inevitable crisis, expenditures were cut and uncertainty rose \u017dalgiris was dealt a big blow when club owner Vadim Kastujev was arrested in Moscow. Striped of funds club survived till the end of the season but failed to meet licensing requirements for top flight competition in 2009. With old club's future very much in doubt fans of \u017dalgiris founded a new phoenix club called VMFD \u017dalgiris which had the same players and staff, and following unsuccessful application for A Lyga license entered second division. A year outside of top flight proved to be difficult. \u017dalgiris finished sixth in seven team league and were eliminated from the cup in the Round of 16 by Sakuona Plikiai, a team from a town with a population of just 600. Despite this bleak performance the club received promotion to A Lyga as the number of teams in top flight was increased and some other clubs refused to join in mainly because of financial burden. \u017dalgiris finished 2010 season in the third place, their highest since 2001. The fortunes of \u017dalgiris went all uphill from there. With FBK Kaunas in complete turmoil and V\u0117tra bankrupt Ekranas for several years became the undisputed superpower of Lithuanian football. Green and whites were closing in, however: \u017dalgiris took second in 2011, eight points adrift, and closed the gap to a single point a year later. Moreover, in 2012 Vilnius side finally ended their nine-year trophy drought and won Lithuanian Football Cup, beating Ekranas on penalties following a 0\u20130 draw. The same season saw \u017dalgiris returning to European competitions but their UEFA Europa League campaign proved to be short: following 1\u20131 draw in Vilnius, Admira Wacker M\u00f6dling hammered \u017dalgiris 5\u20131 in the second leg of the second qualifying round. \u017dalgiris were considered to be strong favorites for the title before the 2013 season and for much of the season it looked that they would cruise to the championship. \u017dalgiris had eleven points lead over second- placed Atlantas with five games remaining but four draws in the row followed and before the final match of the season the gap at the top was reduced to three points. In final match out of form \u017dalgiris proved to be no match for S\u016bduva and for much of the day prospect of season decider on neutral venue looked very likely. However, in tense atmosphere it was Atlantas who ultimately let it slip as they could only draw the game with Banga Garg\u017edai and \u017dalgiris celebrated their first title in fourteen years. Victory in Cup final against \u0160iauliai meant that the double was won\u2014the first since 1991. The great year was backed up by successful performance in UEFA Europa League where Vilnius' side eliminated St. Patrick's Athletic, Pyunik Yerevan and Lech Poznan before losing out to Red Bull Salzburg. Defending the title in 2014 proved to be far more routine task. \u017dalgiris finished the season 18 points clear of second-placed Kruoja Pakruojis (the largest winning margin in the league since 2006) and also claimed the cup for the third time in the row, beating Banga Garg\u017edai 2\u20131 in the final. The club made return to UEFA Champions League after fourteen-year absence yet it did not bring much joy as Dinamo Zagreb beat \u017dalgiris 4\u20130 on aggregate in the second qualifying round. In May 2015 \u017dalgiris won Lithuanian cup for a record fourth time in the row, beating Atlantas 2\u20130 in the final. UEFA Champions League campaign was again limited to just two games as Malmo won the return leg in Vilnius 1\u20130 after goalless first match in Sweden. \u017dalgiris finished the season top of the league, ten points clear of second-placed Trakai thus claiming third successive title. In the 2016 season, \u017dalgiris continued its dominance in Lithuanian football in 2016 with fourth consecutive league title and, remarkably, two cup wins. LFF Cup was rescheduled to be played from spring till autumn that year and therefore two editions of the cup have been played that year. \u017dalgiris won the first final in May with 1\u20130 extra time win over Trakai and backed it up with 2\u20130 final win over S\u016bduva in September. European experience proved to heartbreaking as following a goalless draw in the first leg in Vilnius \u017dalgiris was a whisker away from eliminating Astana only to concede an injury time goal to lose the game 2\u20131. In the 2017 season, \u017dalgiris failed to progress beyond the Champions League's second qualifying round once again in 2017 when impressive first leg win over Ludogorets Razgrad and an early goal by Serge Nyuiadzi in the second leg were completely undone by four straight goals by Bulgarian side. In September 2017, \u017dalgiris reached the seventh consecutive cup final, where they lost to Stumbras, who appeared in their first major final. \u017dalgiris failed to defend the league title, while they were in top position of the standings until October 2017, but a late march by S\u016bduva saw them winning their first-ever championship. In the 2018 season, \u017dalgiris finished in second place as S\u016bduva defended their league title, while \u017dalgiris managed to win the cup in a repeat of last year's final as they defeated Stumbras. Playing in the UEFA Europa League, \u017dalgiris reached the third qualifying round where they lost to Spain's Sevilla, which was their best performance in European competition since 2013 when they reached the play-off round of the qualification in the UEFA Europa League. In November 2018, \u017dalgiris announced that Deividas \u010cesnauskis and Deividas \u0160emberas joined the club. \u010cesnauskis was appointed as sports director, while \u0160emberas \u2013 director of sports operations. During the 2019 preseason head coach Valdas Urbonas signed contract with the Lithuanian Football Federation and became the head coach of Lithuania national team. \u017dalgiris then appointed Marek Zub, who was previously successfully working in the club, as head coach. However, on 15 July 2019 Zub left \u017dalgiris. Jo\u00e3o Lu\u00eds Martins, who became available after the dissolution of FC Stumbras, took on the job of head coach on temporary basis until the end of the season. In January 2020, \u017dalgiris announced the appointment of Juan Ferrando as head coach. However, Ferrando was forced to pull out due to health issues. Later that month, Alyaksey Baha was signed as the team's new head coach. He started off with a success by winning the Lithuanian Supercup on 29 February against champions FK S\u016bduva. ==Name history== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- |colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#044C20; color:#FFFFFF; border:1px solid #044C20; text- align:center;\"|Name history |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF; color:#044C20; border:1px solid #044C20; text-align:center;\"|Year |style=\"background:#FFFFFF; color:#044C20; border:1px solid #044C20; text-align:center;\"|Name |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|1947 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|Dinamo Vilnius |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|1948 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|Spartakas Vilnius |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|1962 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|\u017dalgiris Vilnius |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|1993 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|\u017dalgiris-EBSW Vilnius |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|1995 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|\u017dalgiris Vilnius |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|2009 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|VMFD \u017dalgiris |- |style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|2015 |align=center style=\"background:#FFFFFF;color:#000000;border:1px solid #044C20\"|\u017dalgiris Vilnius |} ==Stadium== LFF stadium. For the majority of the time \u017dalgiris played in \u017dalgiris Stadium. This stadium was the biggest in Lithuania and had a capacity of 15,029. Since 2011 \u017dalgiris plays in LFF Stadium (Lithuanian Football Federation stadium). This arena, formerly known as V\u0117tra Stadium, was built in 2004 and holds up 5,500 people. After the bankruptcy of FK V\u0117tra football club, LFF took control of the stadium. It is situated 400 metres up the Au\u0161ros vart\u0173 and Liepkalnio streets from the Gate of Dawn (Lithuanian: Au\u0161ros vartai) ==Supporters== Piet\u0173 IV The official club of \u017dalgiris' fans is named Piet\u0173 IV. The members of Piet\u0173 IV support the team during every game in Lithuania and in Europe and never leave the team alone. This community is united by their love and loyalty to \u017dalgiris. Piet\u0173 IV is the leader of organised supporting in Baltic states. The establishment date of Piet\u0173 IV is considered October 1985. Since that time fans have been supporting the team while singing, waving flags and creating impressive choreography. Fans helped \u017dalgiris to survive the financial crisis. During hard periods they organized various events and collected enough money to remain. Piet\u0173 IV and the managers of the club together are the founders of \u017dalgiris Vilnius. \u017dalgiris supporters maintain friendly relations with fans of Atlantas. Internationally, there are close historical ties with supporters of Dynamo Kyiv, Karpaty Lviv and Dinamo Tbilisi. ==Kit== From the establishment of the club, \u017dalgiris colours was blue, or red, sometimes was orange. In the 1980s green and white kits were introduced, establishing green/white tradition. From then on, the kit is usually a green and white striped jersey and green/white variation of shorts and socks. In the past there have also been checkered green-white jersey designs.
