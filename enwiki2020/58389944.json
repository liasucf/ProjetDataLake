The estate covers approximately 1,700 hectares and comprises Rangle M\u00f8lle and Holmstrup. The current main building was built in Gothic Revival style in 1933 after the old one had been destroyed in a fire. ==History== ===1730\u20131820: Early history=== D\u00f8nnerup was originally a village first mentioned as Dindethorp in 1199. It consisted of 12 farms and a couple of houses without land in 1688. Supreme Court justice Peder Benzon was granted royal permission to close the village and convert the land into a new manor under the name Benzonslund. Benzon died in 1735. His heirs were initially unable to find a buyer for the estate but in 1737 it was finally sold to Henrik von Eickstedt, a 22-year-old nobleman who would later become known as one of the leaders in the revolt against Johann Friedrich Struensee. Poul Christian von Stemann purchased Benzonslund in 1791. He achieved a successful career at the royal court, which would later culminate with his appointment to president of Danish Chancellery in 1827. He sold Benzonslund tp Johannes Meldahl in 11800. He sold it to Cecilius Andreas Ulrik Rosen\u00f8rn in 1806. Rosen\u00f8rn had four children while he lived on the estate, including later Cultus Minister Ernst Emil Rosen\u00f8rn. ===1820\u20131925: Zytphen- Adeler family=== Georg Frederik Otto von Zytphen-Adeler Benzonszlund was sold after Rosen\u00f8rn's early death in 1820. The new owner was Bertha Adeler, the widow of Frederik, Baron Adeler, whose ambition it was to restore the Barony of Adelersborg (now Dragsholm Castle). Georg Frederik Otto von Zytphen, who was married to Bertha Adeler's grand daughter, was ennobled under the name Zytphen-Adeler in 1838. He managed the Benzonszlund estate from 1839 and became its owner in 1843. Zytphen-Adeler introduced many improvements in the management of the estate. In 1867. he was granted royal permission to rename it D\u00f8nnerup after the former village. ===1925\u2013present: Later history=== The barony was dissolved in 1925 and D\u00f8nnerup was at the same time sold to Aage Hastrup. The main building was destroyed in a fire but a new one was constructed in 1932-33. Members of the Hastrup family owned the estate until 1994. ==Architecture== D\u00f8nnerup is built in Gothic Revival style. It consists of a main wing with crow-stepped gables flanked by two detached side wings. All three buildings are white-washed with red tile roofs and have crow-stepped gables. ==Today== D\u00f8nnerup is owned and operated by D\u00f8nnerup A/.
