South Australian Champion John Boulger took out the Final from fellow Australians Billy Sanders and Phil Crump. The then four time World Champion Ivan Mauger finished fourth to grab the final spot in the 1976 Intercontinental Final at London's famous Wembley Stadium. Mitch Shirra, who before the end of the 1970s would be riding for his native New Zealand (he was born in Auckland), actually rode as an Australian in this meeting complete with the Australian flag on his breast plate. Sixteen-year-old Shirra (who in late 1973 began riding at the age of 14 after lying about his age) was living in Sydney and considered the Liverpool International Speedway to be his home track. ==Australasian Final== * 21 February * Auckland, New Zealand - Western Springs Stadium * Referee: * Qualification: First 4 to the Intercontinental Final in London, England {| class=wikitable !width=25px|Pos. ||width=200px|Rider ||width=70px|Total |-align=center |1 ||align=left| John Boulger || 14 |-align=center |2 ||align=left| Billy Sanders || 13 |-align=center |3 ||align=left| Phil Crump || 12 |-align=center |4 ||align=left| Ivan Mauger || 11+3 |-align=center |5 ||align=left| Phil Herne || 11+2 |-align=center |6 ||align=left| Mitch Shirra || 11+1 |-align=center |7 ||align=left| Barry Briggs || 8 |-align=center |8 ||align=left| John Titman || 8 |-align=center |9 ||align=left| Ricky Day || 6 |-align=center |10 ||align=left| Colin Tucker || 5 |-align=center |11 ||align=left| John Langfield || 4 |-align=center |12 ||align=left| Larry Ross || 4 |-align=center |13 ||align=left| Colin Farquharson || 4 |-align=center |14 ||align=left| Graeme Stapleton || 3 |-align=center |15 ||align=left| Roy Trigg || 2 |-align=center |16 ||align=left| Paul Fewings || 2 |-align=center |17 ||align=left| D.
