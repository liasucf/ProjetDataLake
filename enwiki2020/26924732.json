    "text": "Surin was an Iranian aristocrat from the Suren family, who briefly served as the Patriarch of the Church of the East in 753. Although he was not recognized as a legitimate patriarch by his contemporaries, he is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East. == Sources == Brief accounts of Surin's reign are given in the Ecclesiastical Chronicle of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (floruit 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), Amr (fourteenth- century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century). == Surin's patriarchate == The following account of Surin's reign is given by Mari: > Surin bribed Abanus, the emir of al-Mada\u00efn, to send his henchmen to compel > the people to consecrate him on the fifth Sunday of Easter. Some took the > eucharist, while others broke the fast. Abanus sent his satellites against > those who remained. They rounded them up and, standing by the very gates of > the altar with drawn swords, forced them to consecrate Surin, which they did > with tears in their eyes. Yaqob, metropolitan of Jundishapur, as he spoke > the words of the consecration over him, raised his hands to heaven and > prayed that no good would befall him. Then the fathers told Saffah what had > happened and begged for his help, and he had Abanus flogged and told the > fathers to hold a fresh election. And so Surin was deposed in Hira on the > Sunday after Ascension. Then the fathers went to al-Mada\u00efn with Yahya ibn > Ibrahim and consecrated Yaqob. But Surin and his relatives ceaselessly > attacked him, and finally al-Mansur threw him into prison. Yaqob was > eventually released, and was asked by the faithful to send Surin to Basra, > since its metropolitan had died. Yaqob granted their request, but Surin was > hated by the people of Basra, and while he was received by some, he was > shunned by others. Meanwhile, al-Mansur was now better informed about him, > and ordered that he should be thrown into prison. He fled from Isa ibn > Shahlafa, but the emir of al-Mada\u00efn soon captured him and imprisoned him. > After his death he was buried in the monastery of Shemon, and his name was > inscribed in the roll of the metropolitans of Basra.
