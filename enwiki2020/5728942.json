    "text": "Nautilus praepompilius is an extinct species of nautilus. It lived during the Late Eocene through Oligocene epochs. Fossil specimens have been uncovered from the Chegan Formation of Kazakhstan. N. praepompilius has been grouped into a single taxon together with extant species based on their shared shell characters. It is morphologically closest to N. pompilius, hence the name. The nepionic constriction shows that the hatching size was approximately 23 mm, close to that for N. pompilius (around 26 mm).Ward, P.D. & W.B. Saunders 1997. Allonautilus: a new genus of living nautiloid cephalopod and its bearing on phylogeny of the Nautilida. Journal of Paleontology 71(6): 1054\u20131064. N. praepompilius, along with aff. N. cookanum fossils from the late Eocene Hoko River Formation in Washington state are the oldest occurrences of the genus. ==References== Category:Prehistoric nautiloids Category:Nautiluses Category:Eocene animals Category:Oligocene animals Category:Paleogene animals of North America Category:Fossil taxa described in 1957 ",
