    "text": "Variet\u00e9 is the fifteenth studio album by the British singer/songwriter Marc Almond. It was released on 7 June 2010 through Strike Force Entertainment, part of Cherry Red Records. ==Background== Variet\u00e9 marks Almond's 30th year as a recording artist. It is his first album of original material in nine years. At the time of its release, Almond himself stated it would be his final album of original material as he had increasingly become more interested in recording pre-existing songs (as many of his covers albums have showcased), but this would prove to be untrue and he went on to record further original material afterwards. Much of it is self-produced and co-written with longtime collaborators Neal Whitmore and Martin Watkins. The album was released in a standard one-disc jewel case and a limited edition two-disc digipak in a slip- sleeve version, featuring seven bonus tracks on the second disc. ==Critical reception== Variet\u00e9 received mixed reviews from critics. The Guardian described a \"nostalgic mood\" but saw the album as \"furrows already ploughed\". The Daily Telegraph wrote about Almond's lyrics, stating that \"his lyrical pen remains hilariously barbed\", and called the album \"self-composed cabaret sleaze\". The review in The Scotsman agreed that Almond is looking back with this album, returning \"to old themes with alacrity\", and summarised by calling Variet\u00e9 \"mischievous, lightweight fun compared to Almond's darker, more tortured journeys into European chanson\". Simon Price in his review from The Independent called the album \"an autobiography and also a hymn to the underground\" and stated that Almond \"is determined to squeeze life for its every last drop\". The AllMusic review praised the production as flowing \"freely from spare, late-night-in-the-cocktail-lounge settings to big, bold, orchestral statements\". It also had further commentary on the bonus tracks available with the limited edition version of the album, stating that the \"more minimal, acoustic-based\" songs shine \"a brighter light on Almond's songwriting abilities\". ==Track listing== # \"(Intro)\" (Marc Almond, Michael Cashmore) \u2013 0:42 # \"Bread & Circus\" (Almond, Alexei Fedorov) \u2013 3:47 # \"Nijinsky Heart\" (Almond, Roland Faber) \u2013 3:59 # \"The Exhibitionist\" (Almond, Martin Watkins) \u2013 4:44 # \"The Trials of Eyeliner\" (Almond, Michael Cashmore) \u2013 5:44 # \"Lavender\" (Almond, Watkins) \u2013 5:25 # \"Soho So Long\" (Almond, Fedorov, Neal Whitmore) \u2013 3:37 # \"Unloveable\" (Almond, Faber) \u2013 2:47 # \"Sandboy\" (Almond, Watkins) \u2013 4:41 # \"It's All Going On\" (Almond, Faber) \u2013 4:32 # \"Variety\" (Almond, Faber) \u2013 3:31 # \"Cabaret Clown\" (Almond) \u2013 3:09 # \"My Madness and I\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 4:34 # \"But Not Today\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 4:29 # \"Swan Song\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 3:41 # \"Sin Song\" (Almond, Cashmore) \u2013 7:03 ==Bonus acoustic disc (Limited edition)== # \"My Evil Twin\" (Almond, Faber) \u2013 3:13 # \"A Lonely Love\" (Almond) \u2013 3:35 # \"Cat Dancer\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 2:23 # \"Criminal Lover\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 3:17 # \"I Am No One\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 2:35 # \"Smoke\" (Almond, Whitmore) \u2013 3:11 # \"Kiss the Ghost (Goodbye)\" (Almond) \u2013 4:45 ==Personnel== *Marc Almond \u2013 vocals, arrangement *Neal Whitmore \u2013 electric and acoustic guitar, ukulele, piano, harmonica, Omnichord, arrangement *Martin Watkins \u2013 piano, keyboards, Omnichord, arrangement *Dave Ruffy \u2013 drums, percussion, bongos, spoons, drum machine *Carl Holt \u2013 electric and acoustic bass ;Guest musicians * * Armen Ra \u2013 theremin *David Coulter \u2013 musical saw *Andy Marlowe \u2013 additional guitar *Roland Faber \u2013 Moog, analogue synths, simulated Martenot, Mellotron *Seamus Beaghen v Hammond organ *Thomas Bowles \u2013 clarinet *Igor Outkine (from band Mazaika) \u2013 Bayan accordion *Sarah Harrison (from band Mazaika) \u2013 violin *Gemma Rosefield \u2013 cello *Daisy Gathorne-Hardy \u2013 cello *Sarah McMahon \u2013 cello *Maria Martinez \u2013 cello *Debs White \u2013 violin *Tamsin Waley-Cohen \u2013 violin *Tom Hankey \u2013 viola *James Knight \u2013 saxophone *Dominic Glover \u2013 trumpet *Nichol Thomson \u2013 trombone *Richard Shaw \u2013 cornet *Lucy Jackson \u2013 cornet *Tracy Colston \u2013 tenor horn *Jonathon Ford \u2013 Euphonium *Tris Penna \u2013 string synthesizer ==References== Category:2010 albums Category:Marc Almond albums Category:Cherry Red Records albums ",
