    "text": "The Sorne Hill Wind Farm is a wind farm located in Buncrana, Inishowen Donegal, Ireland and erected in 2006. The farm is operated by Bord G\u00e1is Energy. ==Turbines== Phase 1 of the farm has 16 gearless wind turbines, type Enercon E-70 2 [MW] with a 64-metre hub height and 71 metre rotor diameter giving a total capacity of 32 megawatts. Phase 2 of the farm which is an additional 6.9 MW from three Enercon E-70 2.3 MW turbines were installed in the autumn of 2007. This makes Sorne Hill Wind Farm, at 38 MW the third largest wind farm in Ireland as of August 2008. ==Flow battery storage== Diagram of a Flow battery ==See also== *Flow battery In 2007, there was a feasibility study published which examined the economics of installing a flow battery at Sorne Hill Wind Farm. While the economic case for the system was very compelling, the technology was not ready for deployment at that point in time. A new company, REDT (www.poweringnow.com), has retained the rights to the ESS site at Sorne Hill, and plans to install a utility scale system at some point in the future, subject to funding. == External links == *www.enercon.de - Enercon's home page ==References== Category:Wind farms in the Republic of Ireland Category:Buildings and structures in County Donegal ",
