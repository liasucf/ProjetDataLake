There are plenty of conversion notes and crossover suggestions for using Nightbane with other Palladium systems, and it's well-suited for importing ideas from other horror games. Great stuff.\" Szachnowski concluded by giving the book an above average rating of 8 out of 10. In the July 1996 edition of Dragon (Issue 231), Rick Swan thought this book was \"an above average effort\", but asked why, since there were 144 pages, there wasn't enough room for \"a couple of full-blown adventures?\" ==References== Category:1998 books Category:Role-playing games introduced in 1998 ",
