He was murdered in his home by unknown gunmen on January 23, 2005, , the possible target of assassination by militia members. Sarinle was a supporter of Somalia's Transitional Federal Government and also favored bringing African Union peacekeeping troops to the country. A few days before his murder, an Italian colonial cemetery had been destroyed by militiamen, and Sarinle had been investigating the incident. According to Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram, \"Sarinle was strongly opposed to militant Islamists, and many believe that Islamists were behind his cold-blooded murder.\" Several other high-ranking Somali police officials were also assassinated at that time, and after Sarinle's death, the Islamists took control of Mogadishu. ==References== Category:Somalian police chiefs Category:Somalian murder victims ",
