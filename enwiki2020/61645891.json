He had 2,049 yards and 23 touchdowns as a junior. Former Oaks Christian coach Jim Benkert described Charbonnet as follows: \"He's the best there is. He's got all the measurements and loves the game. He's one of those guys who can take over a game on either side of the ball and is probably the best running back in the country. He competes at a high level on every play. You can't coach that kind of stuff. He's a throwback player. He does his job and doesn't care about statistics. All he cares about is winning.\" ===Recruiting=== Charbonnet was rated among the top running back prospects in the country \u2013 ranked No. 3 by 247Sports.com, No. 4 by Rivals.com, and No. 6 by ESPN.com.
