Early in 1923 the vessel together with two other tankers was sold to General Petroleum Corporation and renamed Emidio. The tanker spent the vast majority of her career carrying oil along the West Coast of the United States as well as between West and East coast. In December 1941 she was shelled and damaged by I-17 and eventually wrecked with a loss of five crew. ==Design and construction== After the United States entry into World War I, a large shipbuilding program was undertaken to restore and enhance shipping capabilities both of the United States and their Allies. As part of this program, EFC placed orders with nation's shipyards for a large number of vessels of standard designs. Design 1047 tank ship was a standard tanker of approximately 10,100 tons deadweight designed by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. and adopted by USSB. Hammac was part of the order for 6 vessels placed by USSB with Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corp. on 18 April 1918 and was laid down on 30 November 1920 at the builder's shipyard at Potrero Point and launched on 25 May 1921 (yard number 5274). The ship was built on the Isherwood principle of longitudinal framing providing extra strength to the body of the vessel and had two main decks. The tanker had her machinery placed aft and a cargo pump room located amidships, and had cargo tanks constructed throughout the vessel with a total capacity to carry 3,369,862 gallons of oil. In addition, the ship had four booms and 4 winches to handle deck load and dry hold cargoes. The vessel had electric lights installed along the decks and was also equipped with wireless of De Forest type. As built, the ship was long (between perpendiculars) and abeam, and had a depth of . Hammac was originally assessed at and and had deadweight of approximately 10,000. The vessel had a steel hull, and a single 422 Nhp (3,100 ihp) vertical triple expansion steam engine, with cylinders of , and diameter with a stroke, that drove a single screw propeller and moved the ship at up to . The steam for the engine was supplied by three single-ended Scotch boilers fitted for oil fuel. The sea trials were held outside the Heads on 12-13 July 1921 with the tanker performing satisfactorily. Upon completion of the twelve hour long trial run, the ship returned to port and after applying final touches was handed over to the USSB. ==Operational history== Following the delivery to her owners the tanker was laid up in Bernicia due to scarcity of cargo and overabundance of tonnage. Hammac remained idle until the end of January 1922 when demand picked up and it appeared the recession was easing. After undergoing maintenance, the ship was chartered for one trip by Union Oil to deliver gasoline to United Kingdom. At the time there was widespread confusion as to why the delivery was effected from the West Coast when it was cheaper and quicker to do the same from the East Coast of the United States. Nevertheless, after loading over 3,000,000 gallons of gasoline the tanker departed San Francisco on 14 March 1922 bound for Thames Haven. Hammac passed through the Panama Canal on March 28-30 and reached her destination on April 21. After unloading her cargo, the tanker left England on April 27 and arrived at Port Eads on May 19, successfully concluding her maiden voyage. The tanker conducted one more trip carrying oil for Union Oil from the Gulf ports to Philadelphia before being switched to molasses trade. In that role Hammac carried molasses in bulk from Cuba to Gulf ports or Europe. For example, in December 1922 she brought in approximately 9,500 tons of molasses to Rotterdam. On her next trip the ship brought in a cargo of beet molasses from Holland to Baltimore. Due to lack of storage space for this type of cargo, it had to be unloaded into a discarded tanker Brindina. In March 1923 several tankers including Hammac, still in the USSB possession were sold to Union Oil and General Petroleum Corp. Following the tanker's arrival in Baltimore she was inspected and transferred to her new owners and departed for West Coast on May 26 reaching San Francisco on June 15. Under new ownership, Hammac conducted one trip with a cargo of gasoline to Philadelphia in July 1923 before returning to West Coast and entering coastal trade there. ===Sinking=== Emidio was sailing in ballast from Seattle, Washington en route to San Pedro, California. The found Emidio off Cape Mendocino on the early afternoon of 20 December 1941, immediately attacking with its 14 cm deck gun. Realizing that the situation was futile, Captain Farrow raised a white flag and gave the order to abandon ship. Ignoring the surrender, I-17 continued firing from its deck gun, blasting three crew members who were lowering a lifeboat overboard. Four crew members remained on board: a radio operator and three engineers. I-17 fired a torpedo which struck the engine room and killed two of the engineers and injured the third. In total I-17 hit the tanker with five shells from its 14 cm deck gun and one torpedo killing five crew members. A Catalina flying boat of 44 Patrol Squadron attacked I-17 with depth charges, but the submarine dove and escaped. The United States Coast Guard cutter Shawnee rescued the remaining 31 survivors who had rowed 16 hours to Humboldt Bay.Panic on the Pacific: How America Prepared for the West Coast Invasion, By Bill Yenne The abandoned tanker drifted north and broke up on the rocks off Crescent City. The bow drifted into the harbor, where it lay until scrapped in 1959. The remains of the hull are still in the harbor, near a commemorative plaque. The site has been declared a California Historical Landmark #497. ==Awards== Louis George Finch, able seaman aboard SS Emidio was given the Merchant Marine Distinguished Service Medal by the president of the United States. This was for his extraordinary courage and disregard of his own safety in voluntarily going into the sea to lighten an overload lifeboat. He stayed in water for one and half hours till another lifeboat came. For the president the award was given by Admiral Emory S.
