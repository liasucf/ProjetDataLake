This district is divided into three towns, Kalpetta, Sultan Bathery and Mananthavady. == Religious sites == # Thirunelli Temple is an ancient temple dedicated to Lord Maha Vishnu. It is situated on the side of Brahmagiri hill in Kerala, which is about 30 kilometers away from Mananthavady (Wayanad district). The name Thirunelli derived from the nelli, the Tamil/Malayalam and Kannada word for Indian gooseberry of the Amla tree. According to tradition, Lord Brahma was traveling round the Universe on his hamsa, when he became attracted by the beauty of the area now known as Brahmagiri Hill. Descending on that spot, Brahma noticed an idol, set in an Amla tree. Brahma recognized the idol as Lord Vishnu Himself and the place as Vaikuntha (Vishnuloka) itself. With the help of the Devas, Brahma installed the idol and called it Sahyamalak Kshetra. At Brahma\u2019s request Vishnu promised that the waters of the area would wash away all sins. (Thus, the spring and river near the temple is called Papanasini: \"washes away all sins\"). Even today the head priest of the temple leaves a portion of the worship materials in the belief that Lord Brahma Himself will come and perform pooja rites deep in the holy hours of morning. The famous incarnation of Lord Vishnu Parasurama is reputed to have visited Thirunelli and performed last rites of his father sage Jamadagni. He also took immersion in the Papanasini to wipe away sins committed in killing Kshatriyas. # Puliyarmala Jain Temple dates back to the 13th century. The temple includes a Dravidian style architecture, beams and pillars carved out of stones, a stone slab roof, and engravings on the doors and walls throughout the temple. The temple is believed to be used as the ammunitions store of Tipu Sultan, the ruler of Mysore. Dedicated to Jain Tirthankar, the temple is also named Ananthantha Swami Temple. Now, this serene place is under the supervision of the local archaeological department. They have maintained it properly with grass walkways and surrounding gardens. # The three Edakkal Caves are located at a height of 1000 m on Ambukuthi Mala, near Sultan Battery.
