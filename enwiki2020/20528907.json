    "text": "Ronda del Guinard\u00f3 is one of the rondes of Barcelona, somewhere between an inner ring road and a district avenue crossing Guinard\u00f3, in the Horta-Guinard\u00f3 district of Barcelona. Basically the same thoroughfare as Travessera de Dalt, or an extension of it, it becomes Ronda del Guinard\u00f3 around Pla\u00e7a d'Alfons el Savi. It cuts Guinard\u00f3 in half and ends at Pla\u00e7a de Maragall. The other major avenue in the area is Avinguda de la Mare de D\u00e9u de Montserrat, not far from it but further north. ==See also== *List of streets and squares in Horta- Guinard\u00f3 ==References== The writer Juan Mars\u00e9 wrote his book Ronda del Guinard\u00f3 in 1984. ==Barcelona Metro== *Alfons X (L4) *Guinard\u00f3 (L4) *Maragall (L4, L5) ==External links== *BCN.es Category:Horta-Guinard\u00f3 Category:Streets in Barcelona ",
