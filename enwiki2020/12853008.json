    "text": "\"You Still Want Me\" is a single by the Kinks released in 1964. It was their second record, and (like its predecessor) failed to chart upon release. This prompted Pye Records to consider dropping the fledgling group. However, the massive success of the band's next single, \"You Really Got Me\", ensured their tenure with Pye would continue until 1970, when their contract expired. ==Credits== *Ray Davies - Vocals *Dave Davies - Guitar *Pete Quaife -Bass *Mick Avory - Drums ==External links== * Category:The Kinks songs Category:1964 singles Category:Song recordings produced by Shel Talmy Category:Songs written by Ray Davies Category:Pye Records singles Category:1964 songs ",
