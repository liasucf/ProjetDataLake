The airport serves two airlines, six air taxis and offers three fixed-base operations (FBOs) for general aviation. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011\u20132015 categorized it as a primary commercial service facility. The National Weather Service forecast office for deep south Texas is on the airport grounds. The airport has scheduled nonstop passenger flights to Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW) and Houston (IAH). ==History== Brownsville was once the main terminal for air service between the United States and Mexico. In 1929 Pan American World Airways acquired a controlling stake in Mexicana de Aviaci\u00f3n and began Ford Trimotor service between Brownsville and Mexico City, eventually extended to the Yucatan Peninsula to connect with Pan Am's Caribbean route network. On March 9, Charles Lindbergh inaugurated this service, landing at BRO after a five-hour, 38-minute flight from Mexico City. An event was held on site in Lindbergh's honor, with a crowd of over 20,000 greeting him upon his arrival. Among the attendees was Amelia Earhart, for whom the main street in front of the Airport is named. Brownsville became an early center for technical development in instrument navigation (\"blind flying\") due to the bad weather conditions that pilots encountered in the mountains over Mexico. Pan Am's service terminated in Brownsville, and passengers were initially taken on the Missouri Pacific Railroad to St. Louis, Missouri for rail connections to the northern US. In 1931, American Airways was flying a multi-stop route Brownsville to Dallas, connecting to Chicago, Los Angeles and other cities.http://www.timetableimages.com, March 15, 1931 American Airways timetable Braniff Airways began service in 1934, and Eastern Air Lines arrived in 1939. During World War II the airport was redubbed Brownsville Army Air Field and used by the military for pilot training, engine testing and overhauls. In 1947 Pan Am's Mexico City route extended to Houston, and Brownsville was an intermediate stop. Pan Am service to Brownsville ended in 1962 as the Mexico City flight became a nonstop DC-8 from Houston. In the 1960s, the 16th weather radar system in the nation was installed at BRO. In 1979, the year after airline deregulation, Brownsville had three airlines: Braniff International Airways (727s to Dallas/Fort Worth), Texas International Airlines (DC-9s to Houston and McAllen), and Tejas Airlines (commuter turboprops to Corpus Christi, McAllen and San Antonio). In 1983 the airport was renamed the Brownsville-South Padre Island International Airport. In 2014 expansion of the runway to was proposed by the Brownsville City Aviation Director, and the city purchased of land for about $200,000. ==Brownsville Army Airfield== During World War II the airport was used by the United States Army Air Forces, although the Air Corps had signed a contract with Pan American Airways in 1940 for the training of aircraft mechanics at the airport. Shortly after the Pearl Harbor Attack on December 7, 1941, both Army and Navy observation aircraft began operations from the airport flying antisubmarine missions over the Gulf of Mexico. For the first year of the United States' involvement in combat of the war, Pan American continued to operate the airport, providing training to Ferrying Command pilots and ground mechanics assigned to the 18th Transport Transition Training Detachment. With the realignment of Ferrying Command to Air Transport Command on July 1, 1942, plans were made by the Army to assume jurisdiction of the airport. On July 28, 1943 the USAAF 568th AAF Base Unit, Air Transport Command was assigned to the newly designated Brownsville Army Airfield. The mission of the 4th Fighter Operational Training Unit at the airfield was the training of pilots to ferry pursuit planes to the various theaters of war. Training was carried out by AAF instructor pilots, however Pan American Airways retained operations at the airfield flying larger 2 and 4 engine transports to the airport as an overhaul facility. In May 1944, a new mission was developed to train multi-engined pilots at the base. The school began operations in June, and the pilots began to ferry large numbers of aircraft to Panama for subsequent shipment by sealift to Australia. Achievements of note during World War II at Brownsville AAF were: * Civilian Pilot Training program initiated to train military and commercial pilots. * The first American jet engine flight was tested at Brownsville Army Air Field. * B-29 bombers were renovated on the site. * The airport had one of the largest overhaul facilities in the country. By the end of the war Pan American had overhauled nearly 6,000 engines. With the end of the Pacific War in August 1945, operations at Brownsville AAF were dramatically reduced. Flight operations continued at a reduced level for the balance of 1945, however in early January the base was declared surplus and was inactivated on March 5, 1946 and returned to full civilian control.
