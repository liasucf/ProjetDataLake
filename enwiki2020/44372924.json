    "text": "Pseudotricholoma is a genus of fungi in the family Tricholomataceae. The genus contains two species known from the Canada, the United States and Europe. Pseudotricholoma was described the mycologists Marisol S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda and P. Brandon Matheny in 2014 with Pseudotricholoma umbrosum as the type species. Pseudotricholoma has a tricholomatoid stature, a dry fibrillose pileus and white to brown gills that have adnate to emarginate attachment and stain reddish when damaged, eventually turning black. The spores are smooth, ellipsoid to ellipsoid-oblong, thin-walled and amyloid. Cheilocystidia are rare to absent and pleurocystidia are absent. The pileipellis is a cutis and clamp connections are present. Species in Pseudotricholoma are found on soil in grasslands and woods in the Northern Hemisphere. They are probably biotrophic, and might be ectomycorrhizal. Macroscopically, it resembles Tricholoma and can be differentiated by its red staining gills. Phylogenetically, it is closely related to Tricholoma and Leucopaxillus. == Etymology == Pseudotricholoma means \"fake Tricholoma\". == Species == * Pseudotricholoma umbrosum (type species, from Canada and the United States) * Pseudotricholoma metapodium (from Europe) ==See also== *List of Tricholomataceae genera ==References== ==External links== * Category:Tricholomataceae Category:Agaricales genera ",
