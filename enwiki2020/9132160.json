    "text": "The Exchange Bank is a historic bank building located in Golden, Adams County, Illinois. The Italian Renaissance style bank was built in 1891 for Harm Emminga. Harm was the son of Henrich Emminga, a German immigrant who had started a prosperous milling business in Golden; Harm continued his father's business by building both a new grain elevator and the new bank. The bank was originally an office building for the mill, as its offices had historically loaned and held money for clients, but it soon developed into the town's main bank. The building also housed the town's newspaper, the New Era. In 1905, the bank moved to a new building in downtown Golden, and by the 1920s it had become a prosperous business affiliated with larger regional banks in Quincy; however, it closed in 1930, a victim of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The bank was added to the National Register of Historic Places on February 12, 1987. It is one of two sites on the National Register in Golden, along with the Ebenezer Methodist Episcopal Chapel and Cemetery. ==Notes== Category:Buildings and structures in Adams County, Illinois Category:National Register of Historic Places in Adams County, Illinois Category:Bank buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Illinois Category:Commercial buildings completed in 1891 Category:Renaissance Revival architecture in Illinois ",
