At the time of the election, he was a member of the Make Poverty History committee on the city's Social Planning Council.Lara Bradley, \"An unlikely Tory among Liberals\", Sudbury Star, 4 October 2008, A3. Labelle became involved in a minor controversy during the 2008 campaign when he made statements in a French-language interview that seemed critical of the Conservative government. According to a press release from Liberal incumbent Diane Marleau, Labelle criticized Finance Minister Jim Flaherty for describing Ontario as \"the last place\" to invest, took issue with the government's decision to abolish the Court Challenges Program of Canada, and said that he was not impressed with the Conservative Party's environmental record. He later issued a retraction, saying that he had not expressed himself clearly and was fully supportive of the Harper government.\"Labelle retracts radio interview statements\", Sudbury Star, 22 September 2008, A3; \"Voters still wary of Harper\" [editorial], Sudbury Star, 27 September 2008, A10. Labelle also spoke in support of the arts community and rejected arguments that his party was hostile to the arts.Angela Scappatura, \"'Gerry Labelle supports arts'\", Sudbury Star, 11 October 2008, A3. Late in the campaign, the Sudbury Star newspaper noted that he \"did not come across as a Harper Conservative\".\"Thibeault in Sudbury\" [editorial], Sudbury Star, 11 October 2008, A10. Labelle received 11,073 votes (25.79%), finishing third against New Democratic Party candidate Glenn Thibeault.
