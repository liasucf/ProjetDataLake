    "text": "A lithopedion. This highly unusual specimen remained in the abdomen of a woman for 55 years. During this time the mother had five additional uncomplicated pregnancies. A lithopedion \u2013 also spelled lithopaedion or lithop\u00e6dion \u2013 ( = stone; = small child, infant), or stone baby, is a rare phenomenon which occurs most commonly when a fetus dies during an abdominal pregnancy, is too large to be reabsorbed by the body, and calcifies on the outside as part of a foreign body reaction, shielding the mother's body from the dead tissue of the fetus and preventing infection. Lithopedia may occur from 14 weeks gestation to full term. It is not unusual for a stone baby to remain undiagnosed for decades and to be found well after natural menopause; diagnosis often happens when the patient is examined for other conditions that require being subjected to an X-ray study. A review of 128 cases by T.S.P. Tien found that the mean age of women with lithopedia was fifty-five years at the time of diagnosis, with the oldest being one-hundred years old. The lithopedion was carried for an average of twenty-two years, and in several cases, the women became pregnant a second time and gave birth to children without incident. Nine of the reviewed cases had carried lithopedia for over fifty years before diagnosis. According to one report there are only 300 known cases of lithopedia in the world, recorded in over 400 years of medical literature. While the chance of abdominal pregnancy is one in 11,000 pregnancies, only between 1.5 and 1.8% of these abdominal pregnancies may develop into lithopedia. ==History== A CT scan showing an extra-uterine calcified foetal skeleton, a lithopedion The earliest known lithopedion was found in an archaeological excavation at Bering Sinkhole, on the Edwards Plateau in Kerr County, Texas, and dated to 1100 BC. Another early example was found in a Gallo-Roman archaeological site in Costebelle, southern France, dating to the 4th century.Wednesday Wonders #3: The Lithopedion The condition was first described in a treatise by the Spanish Muslim physician Ab\u016b al-Q\u0101sim (Abulcasis) in the 10th century. By the mid-18th century, a number of cases had been documented in humans, sheep and hares in France and Germany. In a speech before the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Sciences in 1748, surgeon Sauveur Fran\u00e7ois Morand used lithopedia both as evidence of the common nature of fetal development in viviparous and oviparous animals, and as an argument in favor of cesarean section.Stofft, Henri. Un lithop\u00e9dion en 1678. [One case of Lithopaedion in 1678.] (1986) Histoire des sciences m\u00e9dicales, 20 (3), pp. 267\u201386 http://www.biusante.parisdescartes.fr/sfhm/hsm/HSMx1986x020x003/HSMx1986x020x003x0267.pdf In 1880, German physician Friedrich K\u00fcchenmeister reviewed 47 cases of lithopedia from the medical literature and distinguished three subgroups: Lithokelyphos (\"Stone Sheath\"), where calcification occurs on the placental membrane and not the fetus; Lithotecnon (\"Stone Child\") or \"true\" lithopedion, where the fetus itself is calcified after entering the abdominal cavity, following the rupture of the placental and ovarian membranes; and Lithokelyphopedion (\"Stone Sheath [and] Child\"), where both fetus and sac are calcified. Lithopedia can originate both as tubal and ovarian pregnancies, although tubal pregnancy cases are more common. ==Reported cases== ===Before 1900=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%;\" |- !

The patient was pregnant in two separate occasions but never gave birth. \"A long time\" after, she developed a large swelling in the navel area, that turned into a suppurating wound and would not heal despite receiving treatment. This continued until Abulcasis removed several fetal bones through the wound, which initially shocked Abulcasis, as he had never known of a similar case. The patient largely recovered her health, but she continued to suppurate through the wound.Schumann, Edward A. (1924) Extra-uterine pregnancy. D. Appleton, 189 pp. |- |Lodovia \"LaCavalla\" |Pomponischi, 23px Duchy of Mantua |Unknown |1540 |The patient had a failed pregnancy followed by a successful one, after which she fell sick and rapidly lost weight. Christopher Bain, a travelling surgeon, practised an incision and extracted \"the skeleton of a male child\". She recovered fully and went on to have four more children. |- |Colombe Chatri (68)* |Sens, |1554 |1582 (28 years) |Chatri became pregnant for the first time at 40, but never gave birth after breaking her water and going through labor pains. She was bedridden for the next three years, during which she could notice a hard tumor on her lower abdomen, and complained of tiredness and abdominal pains for the rest of her life. After her death, her widower requested two physicians to examine her body, who discovered a fully formed, petrified baby girl, with remains of hair and a single tooth. By 1653 the lithopedion had come into the possession of King Frederick III of Denmark, who consented to show it to Thomas Bartholin, but not to examine it further. |- |Unknown |Pont-\u00e0-Mousson, Lorraine, |1629 |1659 (30 years) |Encyclop\u00e9die, Ou Dictionnaire Universel Raisonn\u00e9 Des Connoissances Humaines: Con \u2013 Impu (1775), Volume 3, 782 pp. |- |Unknown |D\u00f4le, Franche- Comt\u00e9, |1645 |1661 (16 years) | |- |Marguerite Mathieu (62)* |Toulouse, |1653 |1678 (25 years) |Originally from the Gascon village of Viulas near Lombez, Mathieu gave birth to ten children but only three survived infancy. At 37, she became pregnant, carried to full term and broke her water for the eleventh time, but she never gave birth despite the efforts of a physician. She suffered from acute abdominal pain for two months and vaginal bleeding for five, and felt discomfort for the rest of her life. She could only ease this when she lied over her back, which made her bedridden in practice, and experience periodic paroxysmal attacks. Her case became notorious and her symptoms were popularly attributed to a spell cast by a sorceress whom Mathieu had rejected as a midwife. She consented to be the subject of a public, three-day long necropsy after her death, which was attended by four doctors, three surgeons and their assistants. They found the calcified umbilical cord, placenta and a fully formed baby boy inside that weighed 3,916 grams. The lithopedion was found floating in white, odorless pus, which made it semi-mobile and would explain Mathieu's claim that she could still feel the baby moving inside her. The lithopedion was extensively described and pictured in a published memoir by Fran\u00e7ois Boyle, one of the doctors present. |- |Unknown |Leeuwarden, |c. 1692 |1694 (21 months) |A 21-month old, intra-tubarian lithopedion was removed successfully from a living woman by Cyprien, a teacher of anatomy and surgery at the University of Franeker. |- |Anna Mullern (94)* |Leinzell, Swabia, |1674 |1720 (46 years) |Aged 48, Mullern became pregnant, broke her water and went through labor pains for seven weeks without giving birth, retaining a swollen belly afterwards. She would suffer pain when exercising for the rest of her life, but she was able to become pregnant again and gave birth to healthy dizygotic twins. Convinced that she had been pregnant and carried the previous baby with her still, Mullern made the local physician and surgeon swear that they would open her body after her death. The physician did not survive her, but the elderly surgeon fulfilled his promise with the help of his son, finding \"a hard mass of the form and size of a large Ninepin-Bowl\" that contained a petrified fetus inside. It was examined by George I of Britain's personal physician Johann Georg Steigerthal, who wrote an account of it.Bondenson, Jan (2000) The Two-headed Boy, and Other Medical Marvels. Cornell University, pp. 46\u201347 |- |Marie de Bresse (61)* |Joigny, |1716 |1747 (31 years) |Patient in her second pregnancy after a natural abortion four years before. De Bresse took it to full term and underwent labor pains for two days, but never had vaginal dilatation. After the midwife gave up, an assembly of doctors and physicians from Troyes decided unanimously that the best was to perform a cesarean section, but she refused. She continued having abdominal pains for a month and could not resume work before eight. She never regained her period and continued lactating for thirty years. At 61, she was hospitalized for chest inflammation and died shortly after. The autopsy found an oval mass the size of a man's head embedded in her right fallopian tube, which weighted eight pounds and contained a fully formed baby boy with hair, two incisors and remains of amniotic fluid. The envelope was not fully calcified.Morand, S.F.

William H. H. Parkhurst examined her in 1842, noting the \"largeness, hardness and irregularity\" of her abdominal lump; he would perform her autopsy in front of 20 witnesses when she died a decade later. During the process Parkhurst found \"a perfect formed child... weighing 6 pounds avoirdupois (2.7 kilograms)\" who \"had no adhesions or connections with the mother except to the Fallopian tubes, and the blood vessels which nourished it, and which were given off from the mesenteric arteries... the child was almost floating in the abdomen.\" |- |Sophia Magdalena Lehmann (87)* |Zittau, |1823 |1880 (57 years) |Lehmann, a widow from Olbersdorf, was diagnosed with lithopedion in 1823 by an obstetrician in Zittau, and treated by K\u00fcchenmeister before he moved to Dresden in 1859.

The movements ceased shortly after being admitted to a Kingston hospital but the bleeding and pain continued until she was operated on 8 months later. Although her belly had deflated, the patient still felt a mass inside, but was told by her doctor that it was not important. The pain resumed years later, when the woman had migrated to Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and she was relieved of an oval-shaped, calcified mass of 8 x 4 x 3 cm. |- |Unknown (60) | |1959 |1987 (28 years) | |- |Unknown (76) | |1950 |1999 (49 years) |Patient was originally diagnosed with a benign tumor in 1950, but refused the operation to extract it.http://homepage.vghtpe.gov.tw/~jcma/6406/640608.pdf |- |Unknown (67) |Washington state, |1962 |1999; not extracted (37 years) |Admitted with abdominal pain, the patient reported to have \"missed the baby\" during a pregnancy 37 years prior, but refused intervention.

She had never done pre-natal follow-up. In the third trimester, she had started to feel strong cramps in the lower abdomen at the same time that fetal activity disappeared. She had not looked for medical assistance and some weeks later she had eliminated a dark red mass through the vagina with a placental appearance. She had experienced the characteristic modifications of breast lactation. The abdomen had started to decrease but retained an infra-umbilical mass of about 20 centimeters in diameter, mobile and painless.\" |- |Zahra Aboutalib (75) |Grand Casablanca, |1955 |2001 (46 years) |Probably the most documented case. Heavily pregnant, Aboutalib went through labor pains for 48 hours at her own home before being taken to a hospital, where she was scheduled for a cesarean section. However, after witnessing another young woman dying during the procedure she feared for her life and fled the hospital. The pain ceased days later and did not return for 46 years, when the still unidentified lithopedion was initially mistaken for an ovarian tumor. Aboutalib never bore children again after her ectopic pregnancy, but adopted three. |- |Unknown (80) | |1960 |2001 (c. 40 years) |An 80-year-old woman presented in the outpatient department with severe abdominal pain. Ultrasound examination revealed a large echogenic mass (20 x 20 cm) in the right upper quadrant. An abdominal x-ray demonstrated the skeleton of a fully developed extrauterine fetus. It is presumed from the patient's history that this fetus was present for at least 40 years. Radiography revealed a fetus shrouded in a mantle of calcification. The fetus was hyper-flexed with other signs of \"intrauterine\" death. Fetal dentition charts dated the fetus at 34 weeks, the epiphyses being obscured by extensive calcification. In addition to subcutaneous calcification there was extensive visceral and intracranial calcification. |- |Unknown (63) |Daegu, |1961 |2001 (40 years) |Postterm abdominal pregnancy extended beyond nine months, after which fetal movement ceased and the mother suffered from vaginal bleeding, but never gave birth.
