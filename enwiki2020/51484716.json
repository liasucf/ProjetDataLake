Illustrated London News. Web. 1 Sept. 2016.

She carried out this role from 1927-34.Girton College Register: 1869-1946 At the age of 32, Bliss was Liberal candidate for the East Grinstead division of Sussex at the 1929 General Election. She was adopted as candidate in January 1928.\"By-Elections.\" Times [London, England] 23 Jan. 1928: 7. The Times Digital Archive. Web. 1 Sept. 2016. This was the \"Flapper Election\" where women under the age of 30 were allowed to vote for the first time. East Grinstead was a safe Unionist seat and not promising territory for a Liberal candidate. However, she achieved a swing to the Liberals of 6.3%, finishing a respectable second place ahead of the Labour candidate. She was Liberal candidate for the Carlisle division of Cumberland at the 1935 General Election. She had some link with the area as the Bliss family had lived in Cumberland. However, a Liberal had not won Carlisle since 1918 and no Liberal had fought the seat at the previous election in 1931. This was not a good omen and she came a poor third. 29 years later, she stood for a final time as a parliamentary candidate. She was Liberal candidate for the Isle of Wight division of Hampshire at the 1964 General Election. No Liberal had run here since 1945, when they finished a poor third. It was regarded as a safe Conservative seat. She came third polling nearly 15%. She did not stand for parliament again.British Parliamentary Election Results 1918-1992, FWS Craig ===Electoral record=== ==References== Category:1897 births Category:1987 deaths Category:Liberal Party (UK) parliamentary candidates Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge ",
