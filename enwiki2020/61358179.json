    "text": "Charles Henry Mottram (9 April 1807 - 30 August 1876 London) was a British engraver, mainly in the medium of steel engraving. While Mottram was born on 9 April 1807 \u2013 probably in England \u2013 his exact place of birth and parents are unknown. Among his many other engravings, Mottram's best-known works include four illustrations published for the first time in 1857: three based on The Last Judgement, a triptych of paintings by John Martin, and Boston Harbor (which was based on an 1840 painting by John William Hill). Another work familiar to many people is Off Portland (1871) based on a painting by John Wilson Carmichael. Mottram died on 30 August 1876 in Camden Town, London. He was the grandfather of a prominent New Zealand artist, Charles Howorth (1856\u20131945). ==References== * Robert Edmund Graves, 1894, \"Mottram, Charles\" Dictionary of National Biography, 1885-1900, Volume 39, London, Smith, Elder & Company, p. 98.
