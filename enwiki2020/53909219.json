    "text": "The 2017 Big Ten Women's Lacrosse Tournament was held May 5 and May 7 at the Field Hockey & Lacrosse Complex in College Park, Maryland. For the first time, the top four teams from regular season play will earn berths in the tournament. Previously all schools qualified for the tournament. The seeds were based upon the teams' regular season conference record. The tournament format is single elimination. Maryland successfully defended its 2016 tournament title and received the Big Ten Conference's automatic bid to the 2017 NCAA Division I Women's Lacrosse Championship. The 2017 tournament was the first tournament Johns Hopkins was eligible to participate in as it was their first season in the conference. ==Standings== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Seed !School !Conference !Overall |- |1 |align=left|Maryland \u2021* | 6\u20130 ||19-0 |- |2 |align=left|Penn State * |5\u20131 ||15\u20133 |- |3 |align=left|Northwestern * |4\u20132 ||10-9 |- |4 |align=left|Johns Hopkins * |3\u20133 ||11\u20136 |- |5 |align=left|Rutgers |2\u20134 ||8-8 |- |6 |align=left|Michigan |1\u20135 ||5-12 |- |7 |align=left|Ohio State |0\u20136 ||6\u201311 |- | colspan=4 align=left|\u2021 Big Ten regular season champions. * Qualify for conference tournament. |} ==Schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%\" !Session !Game !Time* !Matchup !Score !Television |- !colspan=6| Semifinals \u2013 Friday, May 5 |- |rowspan=2 align=center|1 |align=center|1 |align=right|6:00 pm |align=center|#1 Maryland vs. #4 Johns Hopkins |align=center|19-16 |rowspan=1 align=center|Big Ten Network |- |align=center|2 |align=right|8:30 pm |align=center|#2 Penn State vs. #3 Northwestern |align=center|12-11 |rowspan=1 align=center|Big Ten Network |- !colspan=6| Championship \u2013 Sunday, May 7 |- |rowspan=1 align=center|2 |align=center|3 |align=right|12:00pm |align=center|#1 Maryland vs. #3 Northwestern |align=center|14-6 |rowspan=1 align=center|Big Ten Network |- |colspan=6| *Game times in EST. # \u2013 Denote tournament seeding. |} ==Bracket== Field Hockey & Lacrosse Complex \u2013 College Park, Maryland ==References== * https://web.archive.org/web/20170509010509/http://www.bigten.org/sports/w-lacros/spec- rel/043017aaa.html * https://web.archive.org/web/20170508165800/http://www.bigten.org/library/stats/wlax- confsked.html ==External links== * Big Ten Women's Lacrosse * @B1GLacrosse Big Ten Tournament Category:Big Ten Women's Lacrosse Tournament Category:2017 in sports in Maryland ",
