As a result of this, many of the scents found within the fragrance are vegetal and mineral based, including Cedar, Patchouli and Vetiver. Ellena would also state that he decided not to use any Musk notes within the fragrance, as \"Musk creates a mask on the skin\", stating that his reasoning for not including this mask was to create a fragrance which was unique to each wearer. ==Variations== Originally released as an Eau de Toilette, Terre d'Herm\u00e8s was reinterpreted as a Pure Parfum which was released in 2009, this was subsequently followed by a Tres Fraiche version 2014.
