    "text": "Napperby Station is a pastoral lease in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is managed by Roy and Janet Chisholm. They run Santa Gertrudis cattle on the property. ==Early history== The station was established on Anmatyerre tribal land. The Chisholm family have owned Napperby Station \"on and off\" since 1948. ==Recent history== Artist Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri was born at Napperby in 1932 and another artist Billy Stockman Tjapaltjarri was raised there. Native title was granted by the Federal Court of Australia over Napperby Station. Both claims were first filed in 2005 after mining leases were granted in the area. The Central Land Council submitted new applications for native title rights over the whole pastoral lease in 2011. ==See also== *List of ranches and stations ==References== Category:Pastoral leases in the Northern Territory ",
