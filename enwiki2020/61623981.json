    "text": "Carolan is a crater on Mercury. Its name was suggested by Belgian individual Fergal Donnelly, American individuals Joseph Brusseau and Deane Morrison in a naming contest which was eventually adopted by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) on 2015. Carolan is named for the Irish composer and performer Turlough O'Carolan, who lived from 1670 to 1738 C.E. S band radar data from the Arecibo Observatory collected between 1999 and 2005 indicates a radar- bright area along the southern interior of Carolan, which is probably indicative of a water ice deposit, and lies within the permanently shadowed part of the crater.Chabot, N.
