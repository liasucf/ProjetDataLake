    "text": "The West Union School is a historic one-room school located near the village of Norwich in eastern Muskingum County, Ohio, United States. Situated along County Road 200 south of the village, the school was erected in 1858. It replaced an earlier log school building; both structures occupied land on the property of pioneer farmer George Richey.Owen, Lorrie K., ed. Dictionary of Ohio Historic Places. Vol. 2. St. Clair Shores: Somerset, 1999, 1116. The school is a weatherboarded building, constructed on a foundation of sandstone and covered with a slate roof; additionally, it features brick details., Ohio Historical Society, 2007. Accessed 2011-04-06. It features a simple rectangular floor plan, measuring long and wide. Although now over 150 years old, the school remains in fine condition; it is believed to have been preserved better than any other extant one-room school in the area. Classes met in the West Union School from its completion in 1858 until the fall of 1933, at which time the West Union School District united with other Union Township districts to merge with the New Concord school system. Since that time, the school has served as a community center: it has hosted events for religious groups, musicians' and farmers' organizations, and even a debate club. In early 1978, the West Union School was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, qualifying both because of its historically significant architecture and because of its role in local history. ==References== Category:School buildings completed in 1858 Category:Community centers in Ohio Category:Defunct schools in Ohio Category:Buildings and structures in Muskingum County, Ohio Category:National Register of Historic Places in Muskingum County, Ohio Category:One-room schoolhouses Category:School buildings on the National Register of Historic Places in Ohio ",
