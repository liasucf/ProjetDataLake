(Mari, 25th century BC) ===Ancient History=== From the discoveries of Dura-Europos to the southeast of Deir Ezzor. Archaeological findings in Deir Ezzor indicate that the area has been inhabited since the ninth millennium BC, however, the current location of the city has not seen a strong and significant city in the past, It was always an urban central subordinate to the neighboring regions and kingdoms, such as the Kingdom of Mari, which rose in the third millennium BC. During the third millennium BC, the Amorites settled the area and established the kingdom of Yamhad, one of whose urban centers was the city of Deir ez-Zor alongside Mayadeen, Qars, and Tarka and its capital is Aleppo. The city had not seen significant incidents with the succession of major empires such as Akkadian or Assyrian over the region, However, some military campaigns by the emperors were destroying entire urban centers for fear of its future rebellion, but, Deir al-Zour at that time, was too small to have the ability to rebel. In the third century BC Alexander the Great crossed the region and built the city of Dura-Europos, which was followed by Deir ez-Zor. and although influenced by Greek culture, the Aramaic language remained prevalent in the city. When Syria entered Roman rule in 64 BC, Deir ez-Zor was a small, marginal village known as \"Azdra\" follow to Circesium, which the Romans made it the center of the region, and they founded in it a strong military garrison. Deir Ezzor also followed the reign of Queen Zenobia of Palmyra in the third century within an autonomous federation of the Roman Empire. === Islamic Invasion === A map showing the march of Khalid ibn al-Walid's army from Iraq to the Levant. al- Jazira region (Upper Mesopotamia) in the 8th century. Iyad played a leading role in the Muslim conquest of the region. After the end of the wars of apostasy and stability in the Arabian Peninsula, Abu Bakr sent four armies to open to the Levant, and the leaders of the armies were Yazid ibn Abi Sufyan, Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah, Amr ibn al-Aas, Shurahbil ibn Hasana. And because of the difficulties that was faced by these armies due to the strength of the armies of the Byzantine Empire and its huge numbers, Abu Bakr ordered Khalid ibn al-Walid to march with a half of the Iraqi army towards fronts of the Levant and command the armies there. Khaled set off with his army towards Sham and opened Bosra and then defeated the Romans at the Battle of Ajnadayn and after Umar ibn Al-Khattab took over the Islamic caliphate in 13 AH (22 August 634 AD) Isolated Khalid ibn al-Walid from the leadership of the Levant armies and replaced him with Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah and ordered him to complete the conquest, and then Damascus opened and after that Baalbek then Homs, Hama and Latakia. After the successive defeats of Byzantine forces,The Byzantine Emperor Heraclius requested the help of the Arab Christians in Mesopotamia who had mobilized a large army and headed towards Homs where the base of Abu Ubaidah in northern Syria, and Heraclius sent to them a soldiers across the sea from Alexandria, Omar ibn al-Khattab wrote to Saad ibn Abi Waqqas to support Abu Ubaidah of muslims from the people of Iraq, So he sent armies with the commanders, including Iyad ibn Ghanm, When the Romans who were besieging Homs heard about the muslims army that was coming from Iraq, withdrew from Homs and returned to their country, Saad wrote to Iyad to invade The Euphrates Island and he conquered in 17 AH and during his march conquered Deir Ezzor, where its people were on that day on the religion of Christianity and Judaism, There was a Christian monastery in the city called Monastery of the Hermits, later built in its place Omari Mosque, Since then, Muslims had come to the city of Deir ez-Zor from Iraq and other countries because of its good location, which combines the purity of air and the abundance of water, and christians had started increasingly disperse, and some of them had converted to Islam. During the Abbasid era, The city has seen great urbanization and agricultural prosperity as a result of security and irrigation development and because of the commercial Euphrates road that was going through it. The small town called \"Deir Al-Rumman\" did not record any significant events during the decline of the Abbasid state and The Mamluk period except for the volatility of the semi-independent states on its rule, that appeared in the Abbasid state, and later its destruction by the Mongols in the thirteenth century. ===Ottoman Era=== The extent of the Ottoman Empire in 1566, upon the death of Suleiman the Magnificent. ====First Ottoman Era (1517\u20131864)==== Ibrahim Pasha, the ruler of Syria (1831-1840). The first Ottoman era extends from the date the Ottomans entered Syria in 1517 until 1864, where the Ottomans found Deir ez-Zor a small town on the upper Euphrates and chose it as a center for their employees and settled in some of tribal sheikhs to protect the trade route between Aleppo and Baghdad and The tribesmen began to visit it to communicate the men of power and buy their needs. Some Arab and European travelers visited it and describe its construction, economy and the nature of its inhabitants. According to the description: \"Its houses are adjacent over an artificial hill and its inhabitants are strong, polite and they welcome guests. Their crops were wheat, barley, cotton and corn, along with orchards full of fruit species, including palm trees, lemons and oranges, the chess game is common among elders\". Deir ez-Zor has repeatedly been subjected to Bedouin attacks for looting and has been greatly affected by these attacks, including the attacks of Wahhabis in 1807, It was repeatedly plundered and destroyed by the Bedouin, because the Ottoman Empire had not subdued them as it was preoccupied with its wars and the corruption of its sultans and officials. The people of the city armed themselves with guns and organized a national army to defend the city resulting in decline the Bedouin attacks, but its negative effects were the shrinking of the city, But the isolation benefited the people of the city, because they relied on themselves to make many of their needs and those of neighboring villages such as axes, spears, swords, gunpowder and weaving the cotton. When security was relatively stable, the commercial convoys started passing through the area and Deir Ezzor was a station for them, providing them with food, feed, and comfort. The khans were established in it and the road between Aleppo and Baghdad began to revive it and get it out of isolation, and young people start traveling to Horan with the beginning of the spring for trading or work and then return in the early fall, they also travel to Aleppo, Baghdad, Mardin and Urfa for trading. In 1831 Ibrahim Pasha took over Deir Ezzor and annexed it to Hama Sanjak and appointed Maejun Agha governor of the city, Egyptian rule remained until 1840 when the authority of the Ottoman returned to the city, Perhaps the most prominent feature of Ibrahim Pasha's rule is the proliferation of weapons among the city's inhabitants, especially the rifles, known as \"Brahimiyat\", which constituted a major tool to defend the city and repel Bedouin attacks. ====Second Ottoman Era (1864\u20131918)==== =====Zor Sanjak===== Ottoman Syria until World War I. Present borders in grey. On 2 January 1858, the Ottoman government launched a military campaign under the command of Omar Pasha (Croatian) comprised 500 soldiers to subdue the tribes in the Euphrates region. The campaign reached Deir ez-Zor city and fought against the residents of the city where 16 Ottoman soldiers were killed. After the Ottoman army subdued the city, Omar Pasha recruited 16 young men from the city to replace the Ottoman soldiers who had been killed. In 1864 the city revolted against Ottoman rule, and Soraya Pasha, the governor of Aleppo, sent a military force to suppress it. After the campaign, Soraya Pasha came to Deir Ezzor and made it the center of the district's headquarters (Qaimakamiyya) and he returned to Aleppo after appointing Omar Pasha governor, whose rule did not last more than 6 months. Khalil Bey Saqib was appointed as Kaymakam of Deir Ezzor after it was annexed to Aleppo. During his reign, it established the government house (Dar Al Saraya), a military barracks, a hospital and some trade markets. Some of the arrivals from Urfa settled in the city to help Khalil Bey Saqib with the administration, as well as starting campaigns to settle the Bedouin in urban centers on the Euphrates. In 1868, the Qaimakamiyya was transformed to the Zor Sanjak, which did not report to the wali but reported directly to the Grand Vizier in Istanbul. Its ruler (Mutasarr\u0131f) was granted wide powers and its area was extended to include the city of Raqqa and Hasakah. The rulers (Mutasarr\u0131fs) solidified security, especially during Arslan Pasha's reign, and were interested in organizing and planning the city, building schools and streets and established the first public park. They also built bridges on the Euphrates and some mosques and encouraged afforestation and they used boats to cross the Euphrates. They reformed the tax system and introduced European uniforms into the city and did not generalize it. The era of the Zor Sanjak lasted 54 years, where 29 Mutasarr\u0131fs successively ruled it, the most recent being Hilmi Bey, who left the city with the Ottoman army on 6 November 1918. The continuous change of rulers (Mutasarr\u0131fs) and lack of resources and disruption of conditions in the Ottoman Empire affected negatively on the urban, economic, cultural and social activity of the city. The outbreak of World War I in 1914 brought calamities, with many young people being recruited, famine and disease spread, livelihoods were confiscated, trade stopped and agriculture declined. However, in the opinion of historian Abdul Qadir Ayyash, Deir Ezzor owed its civilization to the Ottoman rulers despite their mistakes. ===Armenian genocide=== At the beginning of World War I in 1914 the Ottoman Empire began systematic campaigns to kill and displace Armenians. This was carried out through massacres, forced deportations and displacement, which were marches under harsh conditions designed to lead to the death of the deportees. Researchers estimate the number of Armenian victims as between 1 million and 1.5 million. Deir Ezzor was the last destination of the forced displacement of Armenian convoys, and the scene of killings and slaughter by the Turkish gendarmerie, where the Ottoman authorities planned to exterminate Armenians by the Arabs. But their plans failed because the people of Deir ez-Zor regretted what happened to the Armenian men, women and children, prompting Haj Fadel Al-Aboud who was mayor of Deir Ezzor to help and protect them and provide them with food, housing, all livelihoods and safety. If the Armenian forced migration had a tragic side, it had a positive side on the city of Deir Ezzor, reflected in the high population of the city and consequently the high rate of population growth. Historically, the city of Deir Ezzor has a special place for Armenians in Syria and Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora. The Armenian Genocide Memorial Church, which was officially built in 1991, includes a museum containing some remains, collectibles and maps for memory of the martyrs who died in that area by the Ottoman Turks. The city later became a pilgrimage destination for hundreds of thousands of Armenians on 24 April each year, after being declared in 2002 by Catholicos Aram I of the Armenian Orthodox of Cilicia as a pilgrimage to the Armenians. ===Post World War I=== ====The first government of Haj Fadel==== Fadel Al-Aboud President of Deir al-Zour government in 1918 and 1920. King Faisal in 1920. Trouble broke out in the city of Deir al-Zour after the Ottomans left on 6 November 1918, where people began looting and stealing from each other across the area, so it was necessary to have a strong authority for protecting the city and its people and that led Al-Hassan who was the mayor to form his first government in the city and asking all tribal leaders in the villages and surrounding districts to support him and pledge allegiance to him. One of the priorities of this government was maintain the security and running the affairs of the city. This government later known as the \"Haj Fadel Government\".Bukhapur revolution with dates and evidence\u060c Website Al-Muhasan City..

The government continued until the arrival of Sharif Nasser, the cousin of prince Faisal Bin Al-Hussein, on 1 December 1918, and Mar'i Pasha al-Mallah on 7 December 1918. ====British period==== On 11 January 1919, the British army occupied the city via the Iraqi border and annexed it to Iraqi territory. The British government took care of the security and cleanliness of the city and set up a primary school that started teaching English. Fadel Al-Aboud remained mayor, During this period, Fadel Al-Aboud and a number of leaders of the Baggara tribe, Agedat and other tribes represented the Euphrates region at the Syrian National Congress held in late June 1919 Which declared on 8 March 1920 the independence of Syria and establishment of Arab Kingdom of Syria and the appointment of Faisal Ibn Al-Sharif Hussein as King. The people of Deir Ezzor sought to get rid of British rule and wrote their wish to the Arab government in Damascus, The Iraqi officers of the Iraqi \"Al-'Ahd Party\" in Damascus wanted to occupy Deir Ezzor to make it a base to liberate Iraq from the British occupation. So they appointed Ramadan al-Shallash as governor of Raqqa to be a step to liberate Deir Ezzor, Officer Ramadan al-Shallash came and occupied Deir Ezzor with the help of her people and \"Albu Saraya\" clan and British troops withdrew on 27 December 1919 to the Iraqi border. ====The Second government of Haj Fadel==== On 27 December 1919, Ramadan al-Shallash took over the administration of Deir ez-Zor as a military ruler and his authority was nominal and the real ruling was to the notables of the city, and they were not satisfied with his actions so they took him out of the city after two months. After the Battle of Maysalun on 24 July 1920 and occupation of Damascus by French forces, The city of Deir ez-Zor was in a state of chaos and insecurity, which prompted Al-Hassan to form his second government, Which has done great services in protecting the city and maintaining the security of its people despite its limited capabilities. This government continued its work until 23 November 1920, when it was dissolved by a decision of the French occupation authorities.Alayyash\u060c Abdul Qader\u060c Prepare: Walid al-Mashouh\u060c Hadarat Wady Alfurat \u060cAl Ahali for printing publishing and distribution\u060c First Edition\u060c 1989\u060c P 154..Alshamary, Anwar, Biggest Baggara Tribe, Dar Almaref, Homs, 1996, Page: 363.. King Faisal left Syria for Horan then Haifa and from there to Como in Italy then to London in October 1920 at the invitation of the British royal family, Upon his departure, the monarchy in Syria ended and began the French Mandate era. ===French Mandate=== General Yusuf al-Azma Henri Gouraud In July 1920, French General Henri Gouraud issued an ultimatum to the government of King Faisal, known as the \"Gouraud ultimatum \", I set four days to accept it. Although the Syrian government accepted the ultimatum and accepted the demands of General Gouraud to demobilize the Syrian army and withdraw the soldiers from the mounds of the village of Majdal Anjar in violation of the decision of the Syrian National Congress, on 24 July 1920, French troops began to march on the orders of General Goubeier (By order of General Gouraud) towards Damascus, While the Syrian army stationed on the border was retreating, and when General Gouraud) asked about this matter, replied that Faisal's message by accepting the ultimatum had reached him after the deadline. on 24 July 1920, the Battle of Maysalun ended with the loss of the Syrian army and the martyrdom of the Minister of War Yousef Al-Azma, After its control over the entire Syrian territory, France resorted to the fragmentation of Syria into several independent states or entities: * State of Damascus (1920). * State of Aleppo (1920). * Alawite State (1920). * The State of Greater Lebanon (1920). * Jabal Druze State (1921). * Sanjak of Alexandretta (1921). The city of Deir Ezzor, Raqqa and Al-Hasakah were followed to Aleppo. When the French colonial forces entered Deir ez-Zor on 9 November 1921 the region was locally ruled by Fadel Al-Aboud, a member of an aristocratic family, After a while protests and demonstrations against occupation broke out, A group of French armored vehicles and dozens of soldiers encircled the house of Fadel Al-Aboud, where he was arrested and transferred to the military airport of Deir al-Zour and then transported by military aircraft to Aleppo, where he was imprisoned in the castle and during his imprisonment he met with the leader Ibrahim Hanano, In June 1922 he was released and returned to Deir ez-Zor.Fattouh, Issa, Abdul Qader Ayyash Researcher and Historian, Almarifa Magazine, Ministry of Culture in the Syrian Arab Republic, No 646, year 56, July 2017, p 155..

In the demonstrations on Friday, 22 April 2011, (the sixth Friday in the history of the Syrian revolution) the statue of Basil al-Assad was shot down, until then, the Syrian regime had been cautious about the protests in Deir Ezzor, because of their clan nature and the size of their area and the presence of quantities of weapons in it stored from the days of the Iraq war. When the demonstrators headed towards the statue of Basil al-Assad, the security forces fired only in the air. It is said that the demonstrators were not shot and prevented from dropping the statue because the security commanders did not know or appreciate the reaction that could be issued by the people of the city if one of the demonstrators was killed.

Islamic State militants launched an offensive in May 2015, capturing Palmyra and cutting off the remaining supply line to Deir ez-Zor. The city was then effectively under siege by ISIS, leaving supplies to be solely delivered by transport helicopters. ISIS attempted to stop the supplies by daily attacking the Deir ez-Zor Airbase. However, their attempts failed due to the presence of elite Republican Guards of the 104th Airborne Brigade led by Brigadier General Issam Zahreddine.
