Kenny Barron Discography, accessed January 24, 2019 == Reception == In the review on Allmusic, Thom Jurek noted \"this is another fine date by a pianist who seems to restlessly climb another rung with every outing even though he has been at the top of his game for decades\". On All About Jazz John Kelman wrote \"Barron shows with Images that he deserves to be recognized as much a leader and composer as an accompanist. And with this fine quintet on the road this summer, hopefully concentrating on material from the recording, more people will come to see him as exactly that\".Kelman, J. All About Jazz Review, June 20, 2004 while Russ Musto observed \"The flute and vibes grouping gives this unit an appealingly distinctive sound that is airy but never light, sweet but not saccharine ... Barron is, not surprisingly, superb throughout, more than living up to his ever-growing reputation as one of the greatest pianist/composers of the day\".Musto, R.
