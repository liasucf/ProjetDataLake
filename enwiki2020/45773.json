    "text": "Kinshasa (; ; ), formerly L\u00e9opoldville (), is the capital and the largest city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The city is situated alongside the Congo River. Once a site of fishing and trading villages, Kinshasa is now a megacity with a population of about 16 million. It faces Brazzaville, the capital of the neighbouring Republic of the Congo, which can be seen in the distance across the wide Congo River, making them the world's second-closest pair of capital cities after Rome and Vatican City. The city of Kinshasa is also one of the DRC's 26 provinces. Because the administrative boundaries of the city-province cover a vast area, over 90 percent of the city-province's land is rural in nature, and the urban area occupies a small but expanding section on the western side. Kinshasa is Africa's third-largest urban area after Cairo and Lagos. It is also the world's largest Francophone urban area (surpassing Paris in population), with French being the language of government, schools, newspapers, public services, and high-end commerce in the city, while Lingala is used as a lingua franca in the street. Kinshasa hosted the 14th Francophonie Summit in October 2012. Residents of Kinshasa are known as Kinois (in French and sometimes in English) or Kinshasans (English). The indigenous people of the area include the and Teke. ==History== View of L\u00e9opoldville station and port (1884) Kinshassa village (1912) The city was colonized as a trading post by Henry Morton Stanley in 1881.Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 144 It was named L\u00e9opoldville in honour of King Leopold II of the Belgians, who controlled the Congo Free State, the vast territory that is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not as a colony but as a private property. The post flourished as the first navigable port on the Congo River above Livingstone Falls, a series of rapids over below Leopoldville. At first, all goods arriving by sea or being sent by sea had to be carried by porters between L\u00e9opoldville and Matadi, the port below the rapids and from the coast. The completion of the Matadi-Kinshasa portage railway, in 1898, provided an alternative route around the rapids and sparked the rapid development of L\u00e9opoldville. In 1914, a pipeline was installed so that crude oil could be transported from Matadi to the upriver steamers in Leopoldville. By 1923, the city was elevated to capital of the Belgian Congo, replacing the town of Boma in the Congo estuary. The town, nicknamed \"L\u00e9o\" or \"Leopold\", became a commercial centre and grew rapidly during the colonial period. Monument to Lumumba and Tower of Limete After gaining its independence on 30 June 1960, following riots in 1959, the Republic of the Congo elected its first prime minister, Patrice Lumumba. Lumumba's perceived pro-Soviet leanings were viewed as a threat by Western interests. This being the height of the Cold War, the U.S. and Belgium did not want to lose control of the strategic wealth of the Congo, in particular its uranium. Less than a year after Lumumba's election, the Belgians and the U.S. bought the support of his Congolese rivals and set in motion the events that culminated in Lumumba's assassination. In 1965, with the help of the U.S. and Belgium, Joseph-D\u00e9sir\u00e9 Mobutu seized power in the Congo. He initiated a policy of \"Authenticity\" the names of people and places in the country. In 1966, L\u00e9opoldville was renamed Kinshasa, for a village named Kinshasa that once stood near the site, today Kinshasa (commune). The city grew rapidly under Mobutu, drawing people from across the country who came in search of their fortunes or to escape ethnic strife elsewhere, thus adding to the many ethnicities and languages already found there. In the 1990s, a rebel uprising began, which, by 1997, had brought down the regime of Mobutu. Kinshasa suffered greatly from Mobutu's excesses, mass corruption, nepotism and the civil war that led to his downfall. Nevertheless, it is still a major cultural and intellectual centre for Central Africa, with a flourishing community of musicians and artists. It is also the country's major industrial centre, processing many of the natural products brought from the interior. The city has recently had to fend off rioting soldiers, who were protesting the government's failure to pay them. Joseph Kabila, president of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2001-2019, was not overly popular in Kinshasa. Violence broke out following the announcement of Kabila's victory in the contested election of 2006; the European Union deployed troops (EUFOR RD Congo) to join the UN force in the city. The announcement in 2016 that a new election would be delayed two years led to large protests in September and in December which involved barricades in the streets and left dozens of people dead. Schools and businesses were closed down.\"DR Congo election: 17 dead in anti-Kabila protests \", BBC, 19 September 2016.Merritt Kennedy, \"Congo A 'Powder Keg' As Security Forces Crack Down On Whistling Demonstrators \", NPR, 21 December 2016. ==Geography== Down at the banks of the Congo River in Ngaliema commune Kinshasa is a city of sharp contrasts, with affluent residential and commercial areas and three universities alongside sprawling slums. It is located along the south bank of the Congo River, downstream on the Pool MaleboJean Flouriot, \"Kinshasa 2005. Trente ans apr\u00e8s la publication de l\u2019Atlas de Kinshasa \", Les Cahiers d\u2019Outre-Mer 261, January\u2013March 2013; doi:10.4000/com.6770. and directly opposite the city of Brazzaville, capital of the Republic of the Congo. The Congo River is the second longest river in Africa after the Nile, and has the continent's greatest discharge. As a waterway it provides a means of transport for much of the Congo basin; it is navigable for river barges between Kinshasa and Kisangani; many of its tributaries are also navigable. The river is an important source of hydroelectric power, and downstream from Kinshasa it has the potential to generate power equivalent to the usage of roughly half of Africa's population. The older and wealthier part of the city (ville basse) is located on a flat area of alluvial sand and clay near the river, while many newer areas are found on the eroding red soil of surrounding hills.Matthieu Kayembe Wa Kayembe, Mathieu De Maeyer et El\u00e9onore Wolff, \"Cartographie de la croissance urbaine de Kinshasa (R.D. Congo) entre 1995 et 2005 par t\u00e9l\u00e9d\u00e9tection satellitaire \u00e0 haute r\u00e9solution \", Belgeo 3\u20134, 2009 ; doi:10.4000/belgeo.7349.Joe Trapido, \"Kinshasa's Theater of Power \", New Left Review 98, March/April 2016. Older parts of the city were laid out on a geometric pattern, with de facto racial segregation becoming de jure in 1929 as the European and African neighborhoods grew closer together. City plans of the 1920s\u20131950s featured a cordon sanitaire or buffer between the white and black neighborhoods, which included the central market as well as parks and gardens for Europeans.Luce Beeckmans & Liora Bigon, \"The making of the central markets of Dakar and Kinshasa: from colonial origins to the post-colonial period\u201d; Urban History 43(3), 2016; doi:10.1017/S0963926815000188. Urban planning in post-independence Kinshasa has not been extensive. The Mission Fran\u00e7aise d'Urbanisme drew up some plans in the 1960s which envisioned a greater role for automobile transportation but did not predict the city's significant population growth. Thus much of the urban structure has developed without guidance from a master plan. According to UN-Habitat, the city is expanding by eight square kilometers per year. It describes many of the new neighborhoods as slums, built in unsafe conditions with inadequate infrastructure. Nevertheless spontaneously developed areas have in many cases extended the grid street plan of the original city. ===Administrative divisions=== Kinshasa is both a city (ville in French) and a province, one of the 26 provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Nevertheless it has city subdivisions and is divided into 24 communes (municipalities), which in turn are divided into 369 quarters and 21 embedded groupings. Maluku, the rural commune to the east of the urban area, accounts for 79% of the 9.965 km2 total land area of the city-province, with a population of 200,000\u2013300,000. The communes are grouped into four districts which are not in themselves administrative divisions. * Funa District ** Bandalungwa ** Bumbu ** Kalamu ** Kasa-Vubu ** Makala ** Ngiri-Ngiri ** Selembao * Lukunga District ** Barumbu ** Gombe ** Kinshasa ** Kintambo ** Lingwala ** Mont Ngafula ** Ngaliema * Mont Amba District ** Kisenso ** Lemba ** Limete ** Matete ** Ngaba * Tshangu District ** Kimbanseke ** Maluku ** Masina ** Ndjili (N'Djili) ** Nsele (N'Sele) ===Climate=== Under the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Kinshasa has a tropical wet and dry climate (Aw). Its lengthy rainy season spans from October through May, with a relatively short dry season, between June and September. Kinshasa lies south of the equator, so its dry season begins around its winter solstice, which is in June. This is in contrast to African cities further north featuring this climate where the dry season typically begins around December. Kinshasa's dry season is slightly cooler than its wet season, though temperatures remain relatively constant throughout the year. |source 2 = Danish Meteorological Institute (precipitation, sun, and humidity) }} ==Demographics== Kinshasa in 2016 An official census conducted in 1984 counted 2.6 million residents. Since then, all estimates are extrapolations. The estimates for 2005 fell in a range between 5.3 million and 7.3 million. In 2017, the most recent population estimate for the city, it has a population of 11,855,000. According to UN-Habitat, 390,000 people immigrate to Kinshasa annually, fleeing warfare and seeking economic opportunity. Many float on barges down the Congo River.Gianluca Iazzolino, \"Kinshasa, megalopolis of 12 million souls, expanding furiously on super-charged growth \"; Mail & Guardian Africa, 2 April 2016. According to a projection (2016) the population of metropolitan Kinshasa will increase significantly, to 35 million by 2050, 58 million by 2075 and 83 million by 2100,making it one of the largest metropolitan areas in the world. ===Language=== The official language of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, of which Kinshasa is the capital, is French (See: Kinshasa French vocabulary). Kinshasa is the largest officially Francophone city in the world A third factor is simply a demographic one. At least one in ten Congolese live in Kinshasa. With its population exceeding eleven million, it is the second-largest city in sub-Saharan Africa (after Lagos). It is also the second-largest French-speaking city in the world, according to Paris (even though only a small percentage of Kinois speak French correctly), although Lingala is widely used as a spoken language. French is the language of street signs, posters, newspapers, government documents, schools; it dominates plays, television, and the press, and it is used in vertical relationships among people of different social classes. People of the same class, however, speak the Congolese languages (Kikongo, Lingala, Tshiluba or Swahili) among themselves. While the culture is dominated by the Francophonie, a complex multilingualism is present in Kinshasa. Many in the francophonie of the 1980s labelled Za\u00efre as the second-largest francophone country, and Kinshasa as the second-largest francophone city. Yet Za\u00efre seemed unlikely to escape a complex multilingualism. Lingala was the language of music, of presidential addresses, of daily life in government and in Kinshasa. But if Lingala was the spoken language of Kinshasa, it made little progress as a written language. French was the written language of the city, as seen in street signs, posters, newspapers and in government documents. French dominated plays and television as well as the press; French was the language of the national anthem and even for the doctrine of authenticity. Zairian researchers found French to be used in vertical relationships among people of uneven rank; people of equal rank, no matter how high, tended to speak Zairian languages among themselves. Given these limits, French might have lost its place to another of the leading languages of Za\u00efre \u2013 Lingala, Tshiluba, or Swahili \u2013 except that teaching of these languages also suffered from limitations on its growth. == Government and politics == The head of Kinshasa ville-province has the title of Gouverneur. Gentiny Ngobila has been governor since 2019. Each commune has its own Bourgmestre. Although political power in the DRC is fragmented, Kinshasa as the national capital represents the official center of sovereignty, and thus of access to international organizations and financing, and of political powers such as the right to issue passports. Kinshasa is also the primate city of the DRC with a population several times larger than the next-largest city, Lubumbashi.Pain (1984), p. 56. The United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, known by its French acronym MONUSCO (formerly MONUC) makes its headquarters in Kinshasa. In 2016 the UN placed more peacekeepers on active duty in Kinshasa in response to the recent unrest against Kabila.\"UN beefs up peacekeeping force in DR Congo capital \", East African / AFP, 19 October 2016. Critics, including recently the US ambassador to the UN,\"US Ambassador: UN Aiding 'Corrupt' Government in Congo \", VOA News, 29 March 2017. have accused the peacekeeping mission of supporting a corrupt government.Terry M. Mays, Historical Dictionary of Multinational Peacekeeping, Third Edition; Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2011; p. 330.\"UN troops open fire in Kinshasa \", BBC, 3 June 2004. Other non-governmental organizations play significant roles in local governance.Inge Wagemakers, Oracle Makangu Diki, & Tom De Herdt, \"Lutte Fonci\u00e8re dans la Ville: Gouvernance de la terre agricole urbaine \u00e0 Kinshasa \"; L\u2019Afrique des grands lacs: Annuaire 2009\u20132010. The Belgian development agency (Coop\u00e9ration technique belge; CTB) since 2006 sponsors the Programme d\u2019Appui aux Initiatives de D\u00e9veloppement Communautaire (Paideco), a 6-million-euro program aimed at economic development. It began work in Kimbanseke, a hill commune with population verging on one million.Inge Wagemakers & Jean-Nicholas BCH, \"Les D\u00e9fis de l\u2019Intervention: Programme d'aide internationale et dynamiques de gouvernance locale dans le Kinshasa p\u00e9riurbain \"; Politique africaine 2013/1 no. 129; doi:10.3917/polaf.129.0113. ==Economy== Marsavco Kinshasa in 2013 Big manufacturing companies such as Marsavco S.A., All Pack Industries and Angel Cosmetics are located in the centre of town (Gombe) in Kinshasa. There are many other industries, such as Trust Merchant Bank, located in the heart of the city. Food processing is a major industry, and construction and other service industries also play a significant role in the economy. Although home to only 13% of the DRC's population, Kinshasa accounts for 85% of the Congolese economy as measured by gross domestic product.Innocent Chirisa, Abraham Rajab Matamanda, & Liaison Mukarwi, \"Desired and Achieved Urbanisation in Africa: In Search of Appropriate Tooling for a Sustainable Transformation\u201d; in Umar Benna & Indo Benna, eds., Urbanization and Its Impact on Socio-Economic Growth in Developing Regions; IGI Global, 2017, ; pp. 101\u2013102. A 2004 investigation found 70% of inhabitants employed informally, 17% in the public sector, 9% in the formal private sector, and 3% other, of a total 976,000 workers. Most new jobs are classified as informal. The People's Republic of China has been heavily involved in the Congo since the 1970s, when they financed the construction of the Palais du Peuple and backed the government against rebels in the Shaba war. In 2007\u20132008 China and Congo signed an agreement for an $8.5 billion loan for infrastructure development.Emizet Francois Kisangani, Scott F. Bobb, \"China, People's Republic of, Relations with\"; Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 2010; pp. 74\u201375. Chinese entrepreneurs are gaining an increasing share of local marketplaces in Kinshasa, displacing in the process formerly successful Congolese, West African, Indian, and Lebanese merchants.Nuah M. Makungo, \"Is the Democratic Republic of Congo being Globalized by China? The Case of Small Commerce at Kinshasa Central Market \", Quarterly Journal of Chinese Studies 2(1), 2012. Mean household spending in 2005 was the equivalent of US$2,150, amounting to $1 per day per person. The median household spending was $1,555, 66 cents per person per day. Among the poor, more than half of this spending goes to food, especially bread and cereal. ==Education== The University of Kinshasa Kinshasa is home to several higher-level education institutes, covering a wide range of specialities, from civil engineering to nursing and journalism. The city is also home to three large universities and an arts school: * Acad\u00e9mie de Design (AD) * Institut Sup\u00e9rieur d'Architecture et Urbanisme * Universit\u00e9 Panafricaine du Congo (UPC) * University of Kinshasa * Universit\u00e9 Libre de Kinshasa * * Congo Protestant University * Universit\u00e9 Chretienne de Kinshasa * National Pedagogy University * National Institute of Arts * Institut Sup\u00e9rieur de Publicit\u00e9 et M\u00e9dias * Centre for Health Training (CEFA) Primary and secondary schools: * Lyc\u00e9e Prince de Li\u00e8ge (primary and secondary education, French Community of Belgium curriculum) * Prins van Luikschool Kinshasa (primary education, Flanders curriculum) *Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais Ren\u00e9 Descartes (primary and secondary education, French curriculum) * The American School of Kinshasa * Allhadeff School In 2005, 93% of children over six attended school and 70% of people over 15 were literate in French. ==Health and medicine== There are twenty hospitals in Kinshasa, plus various medical centres and polyclinics.\"Provincial Health Division of Kinshasa\" African Development Information Services Since 1991, Monkole Hospital is operating as a non-profit health institution collaborating with the Health Department as district hospital in Kinshasa. Directed by Pr L\u00e9on Tshilolo, paediatrician and haematologist, Monkole Hospital opened a 150-bed building in 2012 with improved clinical services as laboratory, diagnostic radiology, intensive care, neonatal unit, family medicine, emergencies unit and a larger surgical area. == Culture == There are the National Museum and the Kinshasa Fine Arts Academy. Kinshasa is the home to much of the Congo's intelligentsia, including a political class which developed during the Mobutu era.Bill Freund, \"City and Nation in an African Context: National Identity in Kinshasa\u201d; Journal of Urban History 38(5), 2012; doi:10.1177/0096144212449141. Kinshasa has a flourishing music scene which since the 1960s has operated under the patronage of the city's elite. The Orchestre Symphonique Kimbanguiste, formed in 1994, began using improved musical instruments and has since grown in means and reputation.Andy Morgan, \"The scratch orchestra of Kinshasa\", The Guardian 9 May 2013. In 1974, Kinshasa hosted The Rumble in the Jungle boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, in which Ali defeated Foreman, to regain the World Heavyweight title. A pop culture ideal type in Kinshasa is the mikiliste, a fashionable person with money who has traveled to Europe. Adrien Mombele, a.k.a. Stervos Niarcos, and musician Papa Wemba, were early exemplars of the mikiliste style. La Sape, a linked cultural trend also described as dandyism, involves wearing flamboyant clothing. Many Kinois have a negative view of the city, expressing nostalgia for the rural way of life, and a stronger association with the Congolese nation than with Kinshasa. == Places of worship == Among the places of worship, which are predominantly Christian churches and temples: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Kinshasa (Catholic Church), Kimbanguist Church, Baptist Community of Congo (Baptist World Alliance), Baptist Community of the Congo River (Baptist World Alliance), Assemblies of God, Province of the Anglican Church of the Congo (Anglican Communion), Presbyterian Community in Congo (World Communion of Reformed Churches).J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann, \u2018\u2018Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices\u2019\u2019, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2010, p. 777 There are also Muslim mosques. ==Media== Office of the Agence Congolaise de Presse (ACP) Kinshasa is home to several media outlets, including radio and television stations, including state-run Radio-T\u00e9l\u00e9vision nationale congolaise (RTNC) and privately run Digital Congo and Raga TV. The private channel RTGA is also based in Kinshasa. Several national radio stations, including La Voix du Congo, which is operated by RTNC, MONUC-backed Radio Okapi and Raga FM are based in Kinshasa, as well as numerous local stations. The BBC is also available in Kinshasa on 92.6 FM. The state- controlled Agence Congolaise de Presse news agency is based in Kinshasa, as well as several daily and weekly newspapers and news websites, including L'Avenir (daily), La Conscience, LeCongolais (online),L'Observateur (daily), Le Phare, Le Potentiel, and Le Soft.\"Countries: Democatric Republic of the Congo: News\" (Archive). Stanford University Libraries & Academic Information Resources. Retrieved on 28 April 2014. Most of the media uses French and Lingala to a large extent; very few use the other national languages. == Sports == Stade des Martyrs Sports, especially football and martial arts are popular in Kinshasa. The Vita Club,Daring Club Motema Pembe and As Dragon frequently draws large crowds, enthusiastic and sometimes rowdy, to the Stade des Martyrs. Dojos are popular and their owners influential. Kinshasa is home to the country's national stadium, the Stade des Martyrs (Stadium of the Martyrs). ==Buildings and institutions== The People's Palace, seat of the Congolese parliament Kinshasa is home to the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo including: * the Palais de la Nation, home of the President, in Gombe; * the Palais du Peuple, meeting place of both houses of Parliament, Senate and National Assembly, in Lingwala; * the Palais de Justice, in Gombe; * the Cit\u00e9 de l\u2019OUA, built for the Organization of African Unity in the 1970s and now serving government functions, in Ngaliema. The Central Bank of the Congo has its headquarters on Boulevard Colonel Tshatshi, across the street from the Mausoleum of Laurent Kabila and the presidential palace. The quartier Matonge is known regionally for its nightlife. Notable features of the city include the Gecamines Commercial Building (formerly SOZACOM) and Hotel Memling skyscrapers; L'ONATRA, the impressive building of the Ministry of Transport; the central market; the Tour de l'Echangeur. The face of Kinshasa is changing as new buildings are being built on the Boulevard du 30 Juin: Crown Tower (on Batetela) and Congofutur Tower. == Infrastructure and housing == The city's infrastructure for running water and electricity is generally in bad shape.Nzuzi (2008), p. 14. The electrical network is in disrepair to the extent that prolonged and periodic blackouts are normal, and exposed lines sometimes electrify pools of rainwater. Regideso, the national public company with primary responsibility for water supply in the Congo, serves Kinshasa only incompletely, and not with uniformly perfect quality. Other areas are served by decentralized Associations des Usagers des R\u00e9seau d\u2019Eau Potable (ASUREPs). Gombe uses water at a high rate (306 liters per day per inhabitant) compared to other communes (from 71 l/d/i in Kintambo down to 2 l/d/i in Kimbanseke). The city is estimated to produce 6,300 m3 of trash and 1,300 m3 of industrial waste per day. The housing market has seen rising prices and rents since the 1980s. Houses and apartments in the central area are expensive, with houses selling for a million dollars and apartments going for $5000 per month. High prices have spread outward from the central area as owners and renters move out of the most expensive part of the city. Gated communities and shopping malls, built with foreign capital and technical expertise, began to appear in 2006. Urban renewal projects have led in some cases to violent conflict and displacement.Aur\u00e9lie Fontaine, \"Housing: Kinshasa is for the rich\u201d; Africa Report 5 May 2015. The high prices leave incoming refugees with few options for settlement besides illegal shantytowns such as Pakadjuma. In 2005, 55% of households had televisions and 43% had mobile phones. 11% had refrigerators and 5% had cars. ==Transport== :See also: List of streets in Kinshasa (in French) The Boulevard du 30 Juin provides an artery to the business district in Gombe, Kinshasa. The ville-province has 5000 km of roadways, 10% of which are paved. The Boulevard du 30 Juin (Boulevard of 30 June) links the main areas of the central district of the city. Other roads also converge on Gombe. The east-west road network linking the more distant neighborhoods is weak and thus transit through much of the city is difficult. The quality of roads has improved somewhat, developed in part with loans from China, since 2000. The public bus company for Kinshasa, created in 2003, is Transco (Transport au Congo). Several companies operate registered taxis and taxi-buses, identifiable by their yellow colour. ===Air=== The city has two airports: N'djili Airport (FIH) is the main airport with connections to other African countries as well as to Istanbul, Brussels, Paris and some other destinations. N'Dolo Airport, located close to the city centre, is used for domestic flights only with small turboprop aircraft. Several international airlines serve Ndjili Airport including Kenya Airways, South African Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Brussels Airlines, Air France and Turkish Airlines. An average of ten international flights depart each day from N'djili Airport.Flightera.net A small number of airlines provide domestic service from Kinshasa, for example Congo Airways and flyCAA. Both offer scheduled flights from Kinshasa to a limited number of cities inside DR Congo.N'djili Airport website ===Rail=== A memorial at Kinshasa train station remembering those who died during the construction of the railroad The Matadi\u2013Kinshasa Railway connects Kinshasa with Matadi, Congo's Atlantic port. The line reopened in September 2015 after around a decade without regular service. There is an intermittent service, with a poor safety record. According to the Commercial Corporation of Transport and Ports (SCTP), the Matadi-Kinshasa Railway (CFMK) has the highest transport of goods in import, 8 746 tonnes in January, 11,318 tonnes in February 10,032 tonnes in March, 7,244 tonnes in April, 5,024 tonnes in March and 7,745 tonnes in June. The monthly tonnage of exported goods reached only 1,000 tonnes in the month of March 2018. In January some 284 tonnes of goods were exported from the ports of Boma and Matadi, via the railway, and 711 tonnes in February, then 1,058 tonnes in March, 684 tonnes in April, 818 tonnes in May and 853 tonnes in June. The monthly statistics for passenger traffic are as follows: 2,294 persons in January, 1,836 in February, 2065 in March, 2,660 in April, 1,952 in May and 2,660 in June. The line connecting the port of Matadi to Kinshasa is 366 km long. Its distance has been since 3111 of 3112 feet or 42 inches (lane capped 1,067 meter): This railway belongs, in fact, to the National Society, Congo Railways (SNCC). It is only exploited by the SCTP, formerly ONATRA, according to an agreement signed by the two companies. But this line lost large shares of the market, following its lamentable state, insecurity on the rail (some trains are attacked) and the rehabilitation of the road along the rail in 2000. According to Congolese sources , an agreement with a Chinese construction company was signed in 2006, according to which this Chinese company will finance the renovation of the track, the rolling stock, the communication channels the signaling and the electrical energy, the ex -ONATRA has, in fact, opted for an aggressive commercial policy to revive the rail. On June 30, 2018, the SCTP received two locomotives and 50 wagons from the African firm ARSS (African-Rolling Stock Solution). In 2017, some 2.2 million tonnes of cement were produced by the two new start-up companies, PPC Barnet and Kongo Cement Factory (CIMKO). The SCTP did indeed transport part of this production to Kinshasa but the exact quantity was not communicated by the railway department of the company, the former DG Kimbembe Mazunga had communicated an agreed protocol of agreements with the cement manufacturers of Kongo-Central for the transport of their productions. ===External transport=== Kinshasa is the major river port of the Congo. The port, called 'Le Beach Ngobila' extends for about along the river, comprising scores of quays and jetties with hundreds of boats and barges tied up. Ferries cross the river to Brazzaville, a distance of about . River transport also connects to dozens of ports upstream, such as Kisangani and Bangui. There are road and rail links to Matadi, the sea port in the Congo estuary from the Atlantic Ocean. There are no rail links from Kinshasa further inland, and road connections to much of the rest of the country are few and in poor condition. ==Social issues== ===Crime and punishment=== Since the Second Congo War, the city has been striving to recover from disorder, with many youth gangs hailing from Kinshasa's slums.Jonny Hong, \"Gang crime threatens the future of Congo's capital\", Reuters, 19 June 2013. The U.S. State Department in 2010 informed travelers that Kinshasa and other major Congolese cities are generally safe for daytime travel, but to beware of robbers, especially in traffic jams and in areas near hotels and stores. Some sources say that Kinshasa is extremely dangerous, with one source giving a homicide rate of 112 per 100,000 people per year. Another source cites a homicide rate of 12.3 per 100,000.O. Oko Elechi and Angela R. Morris, \u201cCongo, Democratic Republic of the (Congo- Kinshasa)\u201d; in Mahesh K. Nalla & Graeme R. Newman (eds.), Crime and Punishment around the World, Volume 1: Africa and the Middle East; Santa Barbara, California: ABC-CLIO, 2010; pp. 53\u201356. By some accounts, crime in Kinshasa is not so rampant, due to relatively good relations among residents and perhaps to the severity with which even petty crime is punished. While the military and National Police operate their own jails in Kinshasa, the main detention facility under the jurisdiction of the local courts is the Kinshasa Penitentiary and Re-education center in Malaka. This prison houses more than double its nominal capacity of 1,000 inmates.

Of the estimated 20,000 children living on Kinshasa's streets, almost a quarter are beggars, some are street vendors and about a third have some kind of employment. Some have fled from physically abusive families, notably step-parents, others were expelled from their families as they were believed to be witches, and have become outcasts. Previously a significant number were civil war orphans. Street children are mainly boys, but the percentage of girls is increasing according to UNICEF. Ndako ya Biso provides support for street children, including overnight accommodation for girls. There are also second generation street children: \"they referred to their sub-culture of violence as kindoubill\".Charles-Didier Gondola, Tropical Cowboys: Westerns, Violence, and Masculinity among the Young Bills of Kinshasa, Afrique & histoire 2009/1 (vol. 7), p. 77. These children have been the object of considerable outside study.Camille Dugrand, \u201cSubvertir l\u2019ordre?
