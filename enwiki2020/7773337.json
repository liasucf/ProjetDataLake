    "text": "Senegal competed at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The country's appearance marked the third time it had competed at a Winter Olympics, and the last of three appearances at Winter Games by alpine skier Lamine Gu\u00e8ye. The delegation consisted solely of Gu\u00e8ye, who did not win any medals. ==Background== Senegal participated in three Winter Olympics between its debut at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, and the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. No Senegalese athlete had ever won a medal at a Winter Games. In their first appearance, the country was represented by a single alpine skier, Lamine Gu\u00e8ye, while in 1992, fellow skier Alphonse Gomis also competed in addition to Gu\u00e8ye. As in 1984, Senegal sent Gu\u00e8ye as their sole athlete at the 1994 Lillehammer Games. However, this was not intended as they had wished to send a second skier but following changes to the qualification standards by the International Olympic Committee, they were unable to do so. These changes also meant that Gu\u00e8ye was limited to a single event, the downhill. ==Alpine skiing== Competing in the men's downhill, the sole Senegalese athlete, Lamine Gu\u00e8ye's event started on 13 February at the ski resort at Kvitfjell, Ringebu. The gold medal was won by American Tommy Moe with a time of 1.45:75; less than a second separated the top 15 competitors. Gu\u00e8ye was one of four skiers who failed to finish the course, alongside Cary Mullen of Canada, Franz Heinzer of Switzerland and Connor O'Brien of Estonia. Following the Games, Gu\u00e8ye became a spokesman against the qualification standards imposed on the Games, with his book Skieur Senegalais Cherche Esprit Olympique (Senegalese Skier Seeks Olympic Spirit). ;Skiing events {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Athlete !rowspan=\"2\"|Event !colspan=\"5\"|Final |- !Run 1 !Total !Rank |- |Lamine Gu\u00e8ye |Men's downhill |align=\"center\" colspan=3|Did not finish |} ==References== Category:Nations at the 1994 Winter Olympics 1994 Winter Olympics Oly ",
