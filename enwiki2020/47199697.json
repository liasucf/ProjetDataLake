Slightly under a year later, on April 21, 1967, the Millis and Dedham branches were both abandoned due to continued poor ridership. Millis station is still extant, one of only two stations on the Millis Branch (the other being ) to have survived; it is now known as the Lansing Millis Memorial Railroad Station, part of the Millis Center Historic District. ==References== ==External links== Category:MBTA Commuter Rail stations in Norfolk County, Massachusetts Category:Former MBTA stations in Massachusetts Category:Millis, Massachusetts Category:Railway stations in the United States opened in 1886 Category:Railway stations closed in 1967 Category:1886 establishments in Massachusetts Category:1967 disestablishments in Massachusetts ",
