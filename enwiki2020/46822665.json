With a surface temperature of 200,000 K (360,000\u00b0F) and an atmosphere composed of carbon, oxygen and 2% neon, it is the hottest white dwarf ever discovered. It is thought to be the stellar core of a post AGB star, though its composition is unexplainable by current models of stellar evolution. ==References== Category:White dwarfs Category:Ursa Minor (constellation) ",
