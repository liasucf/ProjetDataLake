The area was first colonized by German immigrants in the first half of the 19th century, and the strong German influence can still be seen in each of the towns and villages. The Germanic roots are visible in the architecture, gastronomy and occasionally in the accent and language (Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch) of the region. The Rota Rom\u00e2ntica is approximately 184 km (about 114 miles) in distance and extends from S\u00e3o Leopoldo to S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula. The 13 municipalities along the route are: S\u00e3o Leopoldo, Novo Hamburgo, Est\u00e2ncia Velha, Ivoti, Dois Irm\u00e3os, Morro Reuter, Santa Maria do Herval, Presidente Lucena, Picada Caf\u00e9, Nova Petr\u00f3polis, Gramado, Canela, S\u00e3o Francisco de Paula, and Linha Nova.
