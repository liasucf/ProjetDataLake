Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. Section: Spanish Representation Data. == Diplomatic relations == Both countries began their diplomatic relations in 1967. In 1994, Spain turned to the Rwandan people, highlighting the participation of Spanish troops in the Mission sent that year by the United Nations. It was also the first country that moved a team of forensics and prosecutors to the ground shortly after the genocide to collect evidence and testimonies that allowed to identify and prosecute those guilty of it. The voluminous result of this work, delivered to the UN in 1995, was very useful to initiate the causes of the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. That same year, Spain organized from Nairobi an air bridge with two military planes in order to transfer international humanitarian aid to the hundreds of thousands of refugees installed in the Congolese camp in Goma, in which a Spanish directed the first battalion of Medical officers deployed there by the World Health Organization. It was also through the aid granted by Spain that the Kigali psychiatric hospital was rebuilt after the civil war, with funds provided by the Ministry of Health of the Junta de Andaluc\u00eda.Ficha de Ruanda Office of Diplomatic Information.
