Sandy is a divorced mother of two boys whose ex-husband, Henry has recently remarried a younger woman, Tina. Sandy is still getting used to this when she meets Bradley, a former marine, in the supermarket. Bradley's wife Dana, a Marine Lieutenant, has recently died, leaving him with their two daughters and missing her terribly. Miranda is an accomplished author who gave up her only child Kristin for adoption at birth; as the adult Kristin has her own daughter and mulls over marrying the father, she contemplates the missing part in her life and her friend Jesse encourages her to search for her birthmother. Jesse and her sister Gabi have their own issues with their parents, who they feel are too racist and homophobic to be in their lives: Jesse married and had a son with an Indian- American and Gabi married her girlfriend Max and adopted her son. They're surprised when their parents suddenly show up, and plenty of catching-up is in order. ==Cast== ==Production== ===Development=== In April 2013, Dennis Dugan confirmed that he would next develop Garry Marshall's comedy film Mother's Day. ===Casting=== On June 30, 2015, four cast members were announced, Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Kate Hudson, and Jason Sudeikis, with the film to be directed by Garry Marshall and scripted by Anya Kochoff-Romano and Lily Hollander.
