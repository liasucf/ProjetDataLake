This one is a prop which is on display in the Jimmy Carter Library and Museum, erroneously representing the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline.The red phone that was NOT on the Hotline. electrospaces.blogspot.nl. 30 August 2013 A hotline is a point-to-point communications link in which a call is automatically directed to the preselected destination without any additional action by the user when the end instrument goes off-hook.Derived from Federal Standard 1037C An example would be a phone that automatically connects to emergency services on picking up the receiver. Therefore, dedicated hotline phones do not need a rotary dial or keypad. A hotline can also be called an automatic signaling, ringdown, or off- hook service. == For crises and service == True hotlines cannot be used to originate calls other than to preselected destinations. However, in common or colloquial usage, a \"hotline\" often refers to a call center reachable by dialing a standard telephone number, or sometimes the phone numbers themselves. This is especially the case with 24-hour, noncommercial numbers, such as police tip hotlines or suicide crisis hotlines, which are staffed around the clock and thereby give the appearance of real hotlines. Increasingly, however, the term is found being applied to any customer service telephone number. ==Between states== === Russia\u2013United States === The most famous hotline between states is the Moscow\u2013Washington hotline, which is also known as the \"red telephone\", although telephones have never been used in this capacity.
