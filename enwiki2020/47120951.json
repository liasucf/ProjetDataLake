A.O. Scott reviewing the film for The New York Times found the cast for the film to be very well selected for their roles but the film as a whole to be disappointing stating: \"Ms. Bening, Ms. Moss and Ms. Ronan in particular are superb, as you also probably didn\u2019t need me to tell you. Each one finds the individuality that Chekhov, with uncanny sympathy and sly gallantry, imparted to his female characters. The cast is great. The play is great. But this is still a bad movie, because it has no clear or coherent idea of how to be one\". ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:American films Category:American drama films Category:2018 drama films Category:Films shot in New York City Category:Films set in Russia Category:Films directed by Michael Mayer Category:Films based on plays by Anton Chekhov Category:Sony Pictures Classics films ",
