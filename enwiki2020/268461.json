Lasting from 5\u201316 April 1948, its objective was to break the Siege of Jerusalem by opening the Tel-Aviv \u2013 Jerusalem road blockaded by Palestinian Arabs and to supply food and weapons to the isolated Jewish community of Jerusalem. The operation was also known as \"The operation to take control of the Jerusalem road,\", following which participating units later broke-off to form the Harel Brigade.Yosef Tabenkin, The Turning Point in the War of Independence (\u05d4\u05de\u05e4\u05e0\u05d4 \u05d1\u05de\u05dc\u05d7\u05de\u05ea \u05d4\u05e2\u05e6\u05de\u05d0\u05d5\u05ea), Yad Tabenkin: Efal 1989, p. 123 [Hebrew] Nachshon was the first major Haganah operation and the first step of Plan Dalet, The plan was a set of guidelines for taking control of the territory allotted to Palestinian Jews by the 1947 UN Partition Plan, and defending its borders and people, including the Palestinian Jewish population outside the borders, 'before, and in anticipation of' the invasion by regular Arab armies. According to the Israeli Yehoshafat Harkabi, \"Plan Dalet\" called for the conquest of Arab towns and villages inside and along the borders of the area allocated to the proposed Jewish State pursuant to the UN Partition Plan. In case of resistance, the Arabs of conquered villages were to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the Arab residents could stay put, under military rule.MidEast Web, Plan Daleth (Plan D) Operation Nachshon was carried out by the Haganah's Givati and what was later to be known as the Harel Brigade of the Palmach. ==Background== By the end of March 1948, Abd al- Qadir al-Husayni's troops were preventing supply convoys from reaching Jerusalem. The city was besieged and the Jewish population was forced to adhere to a rationing system. On 31 March a 60 vehicle Jewish convoy was ambushed at Khulda and forced to turn back with the loss of five vehicles and 17 dead.The Times, 1 & 2 April 1948. Yishuv leader David Ben-Gurion decided to launch Nachshon in order to open up the city and provide supplies to the Jewish residents.Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971), p. 369 Although initially intended as a one-shot affair, Nachshon later proved to be the first operation in the implementation of Plan Dalet. Members of the Harel Brigade assembling at Khulda at the beginning of Operation Nachshon ==The operation== Palestinian irregulars, under the command of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, moving to counterattack Haganah positions in Al-Qastal, 7\u20138 April 1948 The operation was named after the Biblical figure Nachshon Ben Aminadav, who was the first to wade into the Red Sea when the Hebrews escaped from slavery in Egypt. The operation was commanded by Shimon Avidan. The first orders were given on 2 April 1948.orders to diversion attacks arose on 2 April, Including Qastel A telegraph confirming the beginning of the operation, was released on 5 April, with the operation starting that same night. It lasted until 20 April.Benny Morris (2003), p. 234. 1,500 men from the Givati and Harel brigades took control of the road to Jerusalem,Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971), p. 372 allowing three of four convoys to get to the city.Benny Morris (2003), p.236 speaks of 3 resupply convoys but Lapierre and Collins (Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971), p. 456) speak of a fourth convoy of 300 lorries that left Kfar Biou on the dawn of 20 April The operation was a military success. All the Arab villages that blocked the route were either taken or destroyed, and the Jewish forces were victorious in all their engagements. Nonetheless, not all the objectives of the operation were achieved, as only 1,800 tonnes of the 3,000 envisaged were transported to the town, and two months of severe rationing had to be assumed.Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971), p. 457 Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni was killed during the night of 7\u20138 April, in the middle of the battles taking place in Al-Qastal. The loss of the charismatic Palestinian leader 'disrupted the Arab strategy and organisation in the area of Jerusalem.'Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971), p. 455 His successor, Emil Ghuri, changed tactics: instead of provoking a series of ambushes throughout the route, he had a huge road block erected at Bab-el-Oued, and Jerusalem was once again isolated as a consequence.Dominique Lapierre and Larry Collins (1971), p. 456 During Operation Nachshon the Haganah wanted to attack the strategic village of Abu Gosh but this was opposed by the Stern Gang whose local commanders were on good terms with the mukhtar.Pappe, Ilan (2006) The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine. Oneworld. . p. 91. ==Aftermath== Operation Nachshon exposed the poor military organisation of the Palestinian paramilitary groups. Due to lack of logistics, particularly food and ammunition, they were incapable of maintaining engagements that were more than a few hours away from their permanent bases.Yoav Gelber (2006), p. 89 Faced with these events, the Arab Higher Committee asked Alan Cunningham to allow the return of the Mufti, the only person capable of redressing the situation. Despite obtaining permission, the Mufti did not get to Jerusalem. His declining prestige cleared the way for the expansion of the influence of the Arab Liberation Army and of Fawzi al- Qawuqji in the Jerusalem area. Between 15 and 20 April, three convoys, totalling over 700 lorries were able to reach Jewish Jerusalem.Joseph, pages 100,101. The Arabs, however, managed to block the road immediately thereafter.Benny Morris, 1948 (2008), p.121 Operation Nachshon was therefore followed by Operation Harel, and immediately thereafter Operation Yevusi. Further operations in the Jerusalem region, Operation Maccabi and Operation Kilshon, took place in May. ==Palestinian communities captured during Operation Nachshon== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Name!!Population!!Date!!Defenders!!Brigade!!Notes |- | al-Qastal | 90 | 3\u20139 April | Palestinian irregulars led by al-Qadir | Palmach | First target of the operation due to its commanding position over the road to Jerusalem.
