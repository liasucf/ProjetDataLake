    "text": "R\u00f6sle Open Kitchen R\u00f6sle is a kitchen accessory manufacturer based in the small Bavarian town of Marktoberdorf in Germany. R\u00f6sle developed the Open Kitchen concept. Originally started in 1888 by Karl Theodor R\u00f6sle as an industrial roofing manufacturer, R\u00f6sle expanded into kitchen utensils prior to World War II. The company saw rapid growth throughout the 1950s and onwards and in 1993 the R\u00f6sle brand became solely dedicated to kitchen tools. In 2012, R\u00d6SLE started their own BBQ range. ==Production Changes== In 2009 the company closed its factory in Germany and sub-contracted production to various firms in China. While insisting the quality would remain, consumer feedback has been poor, leading to a growing market for used, German-made R\u00f6sle products. ==References== ==External links== *R\u00f6sle USA *R\u00f6sle Germany Category:Companies based in Bavaria Category:Manufacturing companies of Germany Category:Mechanical hand tools Category:Knife manufacturing companies ",
