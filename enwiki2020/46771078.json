She lives and works in New York City; Zurich, Switzerland and Apulia, Italy with her husband Fabio and two sons.

As a trained classical violinist, I have to first hear my images and it is always this noise or music that triggers my themes.\" ==Life and career== Barbara Luisi was born and raised in Munich, Germany.
