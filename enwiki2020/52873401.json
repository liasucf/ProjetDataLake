The A.V. Club's Les Chappell gave the episode a \"B\" grade and wrote, \"The madcap nature of \u201cTrust Me Knot\u201d is a step up from the bleaker and more cluttered nature of \u201cFugitive.\u201d While things are still chaotic, it's a chaos that's more in keeping with the Grimm of old and one that seems to acknowledge not all of this chaos is sustainable The final season could certainly be our heroes going to ground and fighting the ascendant Renard for thirteen episodes, but doing so would mess with the rapport and settings that the show has largely preserved for five seasons. \u201cTrust Me Knot\u201d manages to both take a couple steps back into the comfort zone while also remaining cognizant of just how much trouble everyone is in.\" Kathleen Wiedel from TV Fanatic, gave a 4.2 star rating out of 5, stating: \"It's almost too bad that this is Grimm's final season. Grimm Season 6 Episode 2 continued the tension of the season premiere while leavening it some fantastic humorous moments.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:Grimm (season 6) episodes Category:2017 American television episodes ",
