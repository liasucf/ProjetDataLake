It used to be the palace of Fang Qinglu (), who was the 20th Tusi. Towards the completion of the project, someone reported to the Qing government that the building had violated regulations, and Fang Qinglu had to change it into a Buddhist temple. The temple was slightly damaged during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the Cultural Revolution, most of its buildings were completely destroyed by the Red Guards, only the Main Hall and South Hall survived. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the policy of religious freedom was implemented. Foguang Temple was renovated and restored in 1983. ==Architecture== The Main Hall is the most important hall in the temple, it has a double-eave gable and hip roofs. The statue of Sakyamuni is enshrined in the hall. ==Gallery== File:\u8292\u5e02\u4f5b\u5149\u5bfa01.jpg|Foguang Temple File:\u8292\u5e02\u4f5b\u5149\u5bfa02.jpg|Foguang Temple File:\u8292\u5e02\u4f5b\u5149\u5bfa-\u7b80\u4ecb.jpg|Foguang Temple ==References== ===Bibliography=== * * Category:Buddhist temples in Yunnan Category:Buildings and structures in Mangshi Category:Tourist attractions in Mangshi Category:20th-century establishments in China Category:20th-century Buddhist temples Category:Religious buildings and structures completed in 1983 ",
