The Earl of Dartmouth had the house rebuilt, by William Smith of Tettenhall, a leading master-builder of the area. Construction began in 1705, and the brick-built hall, designed by Smith, was completed about 1711. Fragments of the priory house remained as parts of the new building. The house was the favourite residence of William Legge, 2nd Earl of Dartmouth, grandson of the 1st Earl whom he succeeded in 1750. In the mid 18th century a park was created, and ponds, thought to have been part of the priory, were modified. In the early 19th century a portico was added to the house, and the house was extended on the west side.
