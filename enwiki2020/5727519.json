    "text": "Don Pablo Xochiquentzin (died 1536) was a ruler of the Aztecs. Like his predecessor, Andr\u00e9s de Tapia Motelchiuh, he was not of the upper class, so he was not designated a tlatoani, but rather a cuauhtlato (eagle captain). Even so, he was considered a successor to the tlatoques, or rulers. Xochiquetzin was acquainted with Mart\u00edn Ocelotl, a prominent Aztec who would be involved in a famous prosecution by the newly founded Inquisition of Mexico. Ocelotl was the main target of Bishop Juan de Zum\u00e1rraga, but was spared until the death of Xochiquetzin. Xochiquetzin died in 1536 after ruling for five years. After his death the Spanish escalated their efforts to fight against paganism and the influence of the native upper classes. ==See also== *List of Tenochtitlan rulers ==References== *Anales de Tlatelolco (1540) ==External links== Category:Tenochca tlatoque Category:16th-century rulers Category:16th-century monarchs in North America Category:16th-century indigenous people of the Americas Category:16th-century Mexican people Category:Year of birth missing Category:1536 deaths ",
