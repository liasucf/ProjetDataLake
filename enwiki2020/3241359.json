She was born in Moscow and in 1971 she graduated from the Moscow Circus and Performing Arts School. She was a teacher of music in Zagorsk (Sergiev Posad). In the 1970s, Zhanna started to perform Russian folk songs and romances. At that time she was deeply influenced by Bulat Okudzhava, and she quickly gained popularity in Russia and abroad with some critics dubbing her the Russian Joan Baez. Her unique style of music is often described as Russian country-folk. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Zhanna Bichevskaya's songs began to have more political, nationalist and spiritual themes. She performed a series of White Guard officer's songs, as well as a series of patriotic, monarchist and religious songs, some times songs dedicated to the Romanov Holy Martyrs. The lyrics to the latter were composed by Father Roman, a priest of the Pskovo- Pechorsky Monastery. Her album \"Hieromonk Romans's songs\" was blessed by him in 1997.Bichevskaya's Biography In 1999, Zhanna also became the host of her own show on Voice of Russia radio station. She was awarded People\u2019s Artist of the RSFSR.\u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0430\u0439\u0442 \u0416\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b \u0411\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 ==Discography== * Link to selected CDs * \u0413\u043e\u0441\u043f\u043e\u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0435\u0440\u044b: 1994 * Life is too short, \u0421\u043b\u0438\u0448\u043a\u043e\u043c \u043a\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a \u0432\u0435\u043a: 1997, link to CD * Songs of Bulat Okudzhava, link to CD * Great, brothers, great... \u041b\u044e\u0431\u043e, \u0431\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0446\u044b, \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u2026: 1997, Link to CD * Songs of Hieromonk Roman, 1997, Link to CD * \u0416\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0451\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438: 1997 * To Your Name, Lord: 1998 * Autumn of musician: 1998 * \u0420\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0413\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e\u0444\u0430: 1998 * Russian folk songs and ballads: disk 1, disk 2, disk 3, disk 4: 1998 * \u0416\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0451\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438 \u0411\u0443\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u041e\u043a\u0443\u0434\u0436\u0430\u0432\u044b : 1999 * Tzar Nikolai: 1999 * \u0412\u0435\u0440\u0443\u044e: 2000 * We are Russians, Songs of Gennadiy Ponomarev: 2001 * Black Raven: 2002 * \u0411\u043e\u0436\u0435, \u0445\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0438 \u0441\u0432\u043e\u0438\u0445: 2003 * \u041a-141: 2004 * \u0411\u0435\u043b\u0430\u044f \u043d\u043e\u0447\u044c. \u0416\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0430 \u0411\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043f\u043e\u0451\u0442 \u043f\u0435\u0441\u043d\u0438: 2005 * \u042f \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0430\u0436\u0443 \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435... \u0420\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b: 2007 * \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0438, \u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438, \u043c\u043e\u044f \u0437\u0432\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430: 2008 * \u0417\u0430\u0441\u0443\u0445\u0430: 2010 ==References== ==External links== * Official website * Her site in Vkontakte * Zhanna Bichevskaya\u2019s Biography in English * Zhanna Bichevskaya\u2019s Biography in Russian * Zhanna Bichevskaya' songs on Voskres.ru * Zhanna Bichevskaya' songs on ruek.narod.ru (free songs in MP3 format) * Zhanna Bichevskaya's Albums in Korean (7LPs & 22CDs) Category:1944 births Category:Living people Category:Singers from Moscow Category:Russian bards Category:Russian female singers Category:Soviet female singers Category:Soviet songwriters Category:People's Artists of the RSFSR Category:Honored Artists of the RSFSR Category:Recipients of the Lenin Komsomol Prize Category:Russian monarchists Category:20th-century women singers ",
