    "text": "Geissois racemosa wood - MHNT Geissois is a genus of trees and shrubs in the plant family Cunoniaceae. It includes about 19 species mostly found in New Caledonia, but also in Fiji, Vanuatu, and the Solomon Islands. Leaves are opposite, palmate with 3-9 leaflets, with entire margin (serrate in Geissois hirsuta and juveniles) and intrapetiolar stipules. The inflorescences are simple racemes (trident in Geissois hirsuta) and bottle-brush like. The flowers have four red sepals, lacking petals, with many long red stamens. The fruit is a capsule, the seeds flat and winged. The genus includes several nickel hyperaccumulator (most species occurring on ultramafic rocks) and one aluminum hyperaccumulator, Geissois polyphylla. Two species from Australia formerly placed in this genus have now been transferred to the genus Karrabina. ==Species== New Caledonia * Geissois balansae * Geissois belema * Geissois bradfordii * Geissois hippocastanifolia * Geissois hirsuta * Geissois lanceolata * Geissois magnifica * Geissois montana * Geissois polyphylla * Geissois pruinosa ** var. intermedia ** var. pruinosa * Geissois racemosa * Geissois trifoliolata * Geissois velutina Fiji * Geissois imthurnii * Geissois stipularis * Geissois superba * Geissois ternata Vanuatu * Geissois denhamii Solomon Islands (Temotu Province) * Geissois pentaphylla ==References== Category:Flora of New Caledonia Category:Flora of Vanuatu Category:Flora of Fiji Category:Oxalidales genera Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot ",
