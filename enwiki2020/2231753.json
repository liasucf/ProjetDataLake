In 2001 it had a population of 9, which was included in the civil parish of Empingham at the 2011 census. The parish is part of the Exton Hall estate of the Earls of Gainsborough. The civil parish, with just three properties,Rutland County Council report, 9 March 2015; Community Governance Review of Parish of Horn was abolished on 1 April 2016 and merged with Exton to form Exton and Horn. ==History== The village of Horn was mentioned in the Domesday survey, as 'Two hides in Horn of which Langfer had been tenant under Edward the Confessor were held of the king by the Bishop of Durham'. In 1287, Richard son of Richard de Seyton had a manor house at Horne and in 1378 Sir John Seyton had his capital messuage here, although the manor was reportedly valueless in 1376. The land was turned from arable to pasture, which has been suggested as the cause of depopulation. There had been a church, dedicated to All Saints, but it too fell into disrepair and new rectors were installed under a thorn tree in 1471, and until the last appointment in 1809. Horn is part of the Alstoe hundred of Rutland. Proximity to the parish meant that the Battle of Losecoat Field during the War of the Roses was once called the Battle of Hornfield. ==References== ==External links== * The Victoria County History has a lot of detail about Horn.
