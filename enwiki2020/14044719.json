    "text": "The C soprano saxophone is a member of the saxophone family. It closely resembles the more common B soprano saxophone but is pitched a tone higher. Unlike most other saxophones, it is not a transposing instrument, a quality it shares with the C melody saxophone. The C soprano has a very similar range to the oboe. In the early 20th century, the C soprano was marketed to those who wished to perform oboe parts in military band, vaudeville arrangements, or church hymnals. C sopranos are the same shape as B sopranos and differ in length by only around 3 centimeters. C soprano saxophones usually have a \"C\" stamped on them, close to the serial number. The same companies that made C melody instruments manufactured C soprano saxophones (e.g. Conn). As with C melody instruments, production of C sopranos commenced circa 1919 and ended around 1929. == In classical music == The C soprano saxophone was used by Richard Strauss in his Sinfonia Domestica, where included in the music are parts for four saxophones including a soprano saxophone in C. == Notes == Category:Saxophones Category:Woodwind instruments Category:C instruments ",
