    "text": "0010x0010 is a Dutch-born audiovisual artist, currently living in Los Angeles. ==Early years== In his early years, being inspired by underground techno, he released a series of vinyl records under various pseudonyms (only one using his real name) and he performed live acid techno sets at underground parties such as Acid Rain at Amsterdam Graansilo. During the recording sessions for one of the tracks he produced for ex Soul II Soul and The Shamen singer Victoria Wilson James's album on Sony Music, it was suggested that he audition for the \"De Bende van Venlo\", a theatre piece based on a true crime story. He was cast in one of the lead roles and performed over thirty European shows. ==Los Angeles== After the theatre experience, Universal / Island Records won the label-bidding and signed him as an artist and producer. He released one single and one video before he left the label due to creative differences and moved from London to Los Angeles to work on his art, film, photography and editing career. In late 2015, he finished working as the visual supervisor of a documentary about Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky based on his diaries Time within Time, starring Tonino Guerra. In 2016, he released two EPs (as 0010x0010 and T3TSUO 303) on his Generation Acid label which both landed in the Beatport Techno Top 100 charts. The May 2017 released acid techno album |||\u00d8||| made it to the techno and house top 10 charts on both Beatport and Juno Records. In June 2018 he opened the Hong Kong art gallery Nido Asia with the pop up exhibition \"Collixion \u4e2d\" featuring Audio Visual installations and an interactive live show in collaboration with local Hong Kong artist Quistography. Meanwhile his techno music releases \"Alien Love Syndrome\" and \"Stranded on Neptune\" were in heavy club and festival rotation after being played by Dax J and DJ Rush for their Boiler Room (music project) TV sets and his dark trip hop song \"She'll never be me\" featuring vocalist Shexist was used in a prominent scene in the movie Compulsion starring Analeigh Tipton. The song also appeared on the \"We are not alone\" playlist curated by Ellen Allien. During his traveling through Asia and Europe he started to record his album \"M\u00d8DVLXXR\" using strictly modular synthesizers. He finished the album at his studio in Los Angeles and it was released in July 2019 to support his new exhibition \"M\u00d8DVLXXR\" that premiered the same month at Museum of Contemporary Art in Bangkok and was opened by Boonchai Bencharongkul. Both album and exhibition received positive reviews and support from radio and magazines. ==References== == External links == *0010x0010 on Beatport * Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Dutch electronic musicians Category:Audiovisual artists Category:Dutch DJs Category:Dutch photographers Category:Dutch contemporary artists Category:Dutch digital artists Category:Dutch installation artists Category:Dutch video artists Category:Dark ambient musicians Category:Ambient musicians Category:Dutch multimedia artists Category:Electronic dance music DJs ",
