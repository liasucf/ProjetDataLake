It works at the grassroots level with activists, volunteers and paid workers. It is slowly gaining importance as a practical training ground for other NGOs and GOs interested in working on HIV/AIDS in a rural context. SANGRAM started its work with women in prostitution and sex work from South Maharashtra and North Karnataka in 1992, and has since fanned out among diverse populations. SANGRAM is based in Sangli district, which has the highest incidence of HIV/AIDS in Maharashtra after Mumbai. ==References== ==External links== * SANGRAM website Category:HIV/AIDS organizations Category:Organisations based in Mumbai Category:Women's organisations based in India Category:Health charities in India ",
