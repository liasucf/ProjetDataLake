    "text": "Editor's Note (foaled April 26, 1993 in Kentucky) is an American thoroughbred racehorse. He was sired by 1992 U.S. Champion 2 YO Colt Forty Niner, who in turn was a son of Champion sire Mr. Prospector and out of the mare Beware Of The Cat. Trained by D. Wayne Lukas and ridden by Ren\u00e9 Douglas, who was given the assignment after Gary Stevens was injured, Editor's Note is best known for his classic stretch duel with Skip Away in the 1996 Belmont Stakes, beating Preakness Stakes winner Louis Quatorze, who was unplaced. This was the same race in which the Santa Anita Derby winner, Cavonnier, bowed a tendon and was unable to finish. With the death of A.P. Indy on February 21, 2020, Editor's Note became the oldest living winner of the Belmont Stakes. ==Retirement== Editor's Note was originally retired in 1997 to Overbrook Farm in Lexington, Kentucky, but was exported in 2004 to Argentina. ==References== * Pedigree & Partial Stats ==External links== * Washington Post Lukas Wins Belmont Again * NY Times Editor's Note Retired Category:1993 racehorse births Category:Racehorses bred in Kentucky Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Belmont Stakes winners Category:Thoroughbred family 8-c ",
