He was drafted in the third round, 47th overall, by the Buffalo Sabres in the 1986 NHL Entry Draft. ==Playing career== Corkum represented the United States at the 1987 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. After playing four seasons for the University of Maine, Corkum debuted with Buffalo's American Hockey League affiliate, the Rochester Americans, in the 1989\u201390 season. He also appeared in eight regular season games and five playoff games with the Sabres during the 1989\u201390 season. After playing for the Americans and Sabres for the next three seasons, Corkum was chosen by the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim in the 1993 NHL Expansion Draft. After the Mighty Ducks, Corkum made stops with the Philadelphia Flyers, Phoenix Coyotes, Los Angeles Kings, New Jersey Devils, and Atlanta Thrashers. The Thrashers traded him back to the Sabres at the trade deadline of the 2001\u201302 season. After finishing the season with the Sabres, Corkum retired. In his NHL career, Corkum played in 720 games. He recorded 97 goals and 103 assists, for 200 total points. His best season came in 1993\u201394 with Anaheim, when he scored 23 goals and added 28 assists. ==Coaching career== On August 22, 2008, it was announced that Corkum would be returning to his alma mater to become the associate head coach at The University of Maine. He spent the majority of the previous four seasons coaching junior hockey in the EJHL, and Massachusetts High School hockey at Newburyport High prior to that. On April 30, 2013, USA Hockey named Corkum the head coach of Team USA for the 2013 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament to be held in Slovakia during August 2013. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"99\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
