    "text": "The Turkestan lynx (Lynx lynx isabellinus) is a subspecies of Eurasian lynx native to Central Asia. It is also known as Central Asian lynx, Tibetan lynx or Himalayan lynx. It is widespread from west in Central Asia, from South Asia to China and Mongolia. There are 27,000 mature individuals in China as of 2013. It is proposed for the Turkestan lynx to be listed as Vulnerable in Uzbekistan. ==Taxonomy== Felis isabellina was the scientific name proposed by Edward Blyth in 1847 for a lynx skin from Tibet. Lynx lynx wardi was proposed by Richard Lydekker in 1904. However, most authors considered it as synonymous to Lynx lynx isabelinus. Further investigations are in need in order to declare it whether as a separate subspecies or not. As of today, wardi is sometimes regarded as a synonym to isabellinus. ==Distribution and habitat== The Turkestan lynx is one of the most widespread subspecies of Eurasian lynx. In Central Asia, the Turkestan lynx live mostly in open woodlands and steppe, and are also found throughout the rocky hills and mountains of the Central Asian desert regions. In southern Asia, it occurs throughout the northern slopes of the Himalayas, and has been reported both from thick scrub woodland and barren, rocky areas above the tree line. The Turkestan lynx live in the Ladakh area of Kashmir, the Himachal Pradesh and other Indian states of the Himalayas region. In southern China, it occurs sporadically throughout the Tibetan plateau. ==References== Category:Eurasian lynx subspecies Category:Mammals described in 1915 Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan Lynx, Turkestan ",
