    "text": "A \"Section 44\" refers to the New South Wales Rural Fires Act 1997, specifically section 44, Commissioner\u2019s responsibility. Essentially it is used to describe when the Rural Fire Service Commissioner declares a localised \"State of Emergency\" for a specific district suffering severe fire conditions that cannot be managed without drawing in extensive resources from other areas. Once declared by the Commissioner the district has access to any and all fire-fighting personnel/equipment from across the State at no cost to the district or RFS, with the State Government footing the bill of all related Section 44 declared operations. ==See also== * New South Wales * Rural Fire Service * Remote Area Firefighting Team * Bushfires in Australia * New South Wales Fire Brigades * Firefighting * Country Fire Service (South Australia) * Country Fire Authority (Victoria) ==External links== * Rural Fires Act 1997 * NSW Rural Fire Service Website * NSW Rural Fire Service Association Category:New South Wales Rural Fire Service Category:New South Wales legislation Category:1997 in Australian law Category:1990s in New South Wales ",
