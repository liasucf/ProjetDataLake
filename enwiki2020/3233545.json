    "text": "Paramount Cars was a British company which produced the Paramount automobile between 1950 and 1956. Founded by WA Hudson and S Underwood from Derbyshire, the company initially manufactured cars in Swadlincote with production moving shortly after to Melbourne (again in Derbyshire) and then to Leighton Buzzard. Two models were produced, the Paramount Ten and the Paramount 1\u00bd-Litre. == History == The Paramount had an aluminium over wood frame body with BMW like grille and was mounted on a separate tubular steel chassis with front transverse and rear semi elliptical leaf springs. It was originally intended to have Alvis engine and suspension but to reduce cost the production versions used Ford 10 components including the 1172 cc side valve engines, but fitted with twin SU carburettors, which resulted in poor performance. The car was listed in both 2 and 4 seat versions. In 1953, the company was bought by Camden Motors and production moved to Leighton Buzzard and the Ford Consul 1,508 cc engine was an option in a longer chassis as also was a Wade or Shorrock supercharger. The price was now an uncompetitive \u00a31009 and production ceased in 1956 after about 70 cars had been made. After the end of car production the remaining chassis were sold off and several were fitted with Rochdale glass fibre bodies. There was no connection with the two separate American Paramount Car companies of Azusa, California (1923-1924) and New York City (1927-1931). ==Performance== A 1500 cc car tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 31.2 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost \u00a31013 including taxes. ==Gallery== File:1956 Paramount 1\u00bd Litre.jpg|1956 Paramount 1\u00bd Litre with the Ford Consul engine File:Paramount roadster sxm 269 front left chew 2013.jpg|1956 Paramount 1 1/2 litre Roadster File:Paramount roadster sxm 269 left side chew 2013.jpg|1956 Paramount 1 1/2 litre Roadster File:Paramount roadster sxm 269 rear left chew 2013.jpg|1956 Paramount 1 1/2 litre Roadster File:Paramount roadster sxm 269 front chew 2013.jpg|1956 Paramount 1 1/2 litre Roadster File:Paramount roadster sxm 269 rear chew 2013.jpg|1956 Paramount 1 1/2 litre Roadster File:Alvis_Crested_Eagle_Paramount_Coupe_front.jpg|Alvis- based prototype 1948 File:Alvis_Crested_Eagle_Paramount_Coupe_head.jpg|Alvis badge and 3litre engine File:Alvis_Crested_Eagle_Paramount_Coupe_side.jpg|Aluminium body on 1933 Alvis ==See also== * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom ==References== ===Bibliography=== * Lawrence, Mike.
