    "text": "The American logo in Cincinnati's colors The Cincinnati Bearcats are the athletic teams that represent the University of Cincinnati. The teams are members of the American Athletic Conference (The American), which from 1979 to 2013 was known as the Big East Conference. Cincinnati and Wichita State University are currently the only members of The American that are located in the Midwestern United States; all other members are in the Northeast or South. The Bearcats were previously members of Conference USA, where they were a founding member. The creation of Conference USA was the result of a merger between the Great Midwest Conference (of which Cincinnati was a member) and the Metro Conference (whom Cincinnati had previously been a member) in 1995. Other collegiate athletic conferences which the school has belonged to includes the Missouri Valley Conference, 1957\u20131969; the Mid-American Conference, 1947\u20131952; the Buckeye Athletic Association, 1925\u20131935, and the Ohio Athletic Conference, 1910\u20131924. ==The Bearcat== The Bearcat mascot in 2011 The Bearcat became the UC mascot on October 31, 1914 in a football game against the UK Wildcats. The key players in the birth of the Bearcat were a star UC player named Baehr, a creative cheerleader, and a talented cartoonist. During the second half of that hard-fought football game, UC cheerleader Norman \"Pat\" Lyon, building on the efforts of fullback Leonard K. \"Teddy\" Baehr, created the chant: \"They may be Wildcats, but we have a Baehr-cat on our side.\" The crowd took up the cry: \"Come on, Baehr-cat!\" Cincinnati prevailed, 14\u20137, and the victory was memorialized in a cartoon published on the front page of the student newspaper, the weekly University News, on November 3. The cartoon, by John \"Paddy\" Reece, depicted a bedraggled Kentucky Wildcat being chased by a creature labeled \"Cincinnati Bear Cat\". The name stuck, but not immediately. Following Teddy Baehr's graduation in 1916, the name dropped out of use, at least in print, for a few years. On November 15, 1919, Cincinnati played at Tennessee. The Cincinnati Enquirer writer Jack Ryder's dispatch on the game was the first time that the major media called UC's teams \"Bearcats.\" From then on, the university's teams were regularly called Bearcats. In 2008 the Cincinnati Zoo adopted a three-month-old binturong or \"bearcat\". The zoo had a public naming contest where they decided on the name \"Lucy.\" Lucy was a prominent figure at the University of Cincinnati often to be found on Sheakley Lawn before home football games. On August 30, 2019, it was announced that \"Lucy\", the Cincinnati Zoo's binturong (Bearcat) would be retiring from her duties as Mascot. ==Varsity sports== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\" |- |- | Baseball || Basketball |- | Basketball || Cross country |- | Cross country || Golf |- | Football || Lacrosse |- | Golf || Soccer |- | Swimming & diving || Swimming & diving |- | Track and field\u2020 || Tennis |- | || Track and field\u2020 |- | || Volleyball |- | colspan=\"2\" style=\"\" | |} The University of Cincinnati sponsors teams in eight men's and 10 women's NCAA-sanctioned sports, competing in the American Athletic Conference. ===Baseball=== ===Men's basketball=== Cincinnati's men's basketball squads have been a perennial bracket team in the NCAA tournament. A prolific era in Bearcats basketball was during the late 1950s and early 1960s, when the Bearcats posted five consecutive Final Four appearances. Unanimous three-time All American guard Oscar Robertson led the nation in scoring during the 1957\u201358, 1958\u201359, and 1959\u201360 seasons and posted a career average of 33.8 points per game, which ranks as the third all-time best in Division I. Cincinnati has won two national championships in 1961 and 1962. The 1961 and 1962 titles were won under rookie coach Ed Jucker. Cincinnati fell out of prominence during the early 1970s. After a brief resurgence in the mid-1970s, the program fell on hard times in the 1980s, but was revitalized under head coach Bob Huggins following his hiring in 1989. Under Huggins, the Bearcats compiled a 399\u2013127 record in sixteen seasons, and posted fourteen straight NCAA tournament appearances. The most notable of the teams from the Huggins era was the 1991\u20131992 team, which lost to the Michigan Wolverines in the Final Four. In addition, Huggins was responsible for recruiting several future NBA players including Kenyon Martin, Corie Blount, Ruben Patterson, Nick Van Exel and DerMarr Johnson. Huggins would eventually resign in 2005 after a power struggle with UC president Nancy Zimpher, with the resulting coaching vacuum leading to a dip in fortunes for the Bearcats. However, the hiring of alumnus Mick Cronin in 2006 would restore UC to national prominence, reaching the NCAA Tournament nine straight years until Cronin left to coach at UCLA.

The top tier are the Tier 5 sports, which are classified as semi-varsity. These clubs operate at a level similar to a varsity team in sports for which Cincinnati lacks varsity representation, and the tier reflects the commitment these students dedicate to their club. The four Tier 5 semi-varsity sports as of 2013 are equestrian, men's ice hockey, men's and women's rowing, and men's and women's waterski.University of Cincinnati, Club Sports Handbook, http://www.uc.edu/content/dam/uc/sald/docs/CSB%20Documents/Club_Sports_Handbook_2012_13.pdf ==Championships== ===NCAA team championships=== Cincinnati has won 2 NCAA team national championships.http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/champs_records_book/Overall.pdf *Men's (2) **Basketball (2): 1961, 1962 *see also: **American Athletic Conference NCAA team championships **List of NCAA schools with the most NCAA Division I championships ===Other national team championships=== Below are 5 national team titles that were not bestowed by the NCAA: *Women's **Dance (5): 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2015 The Bearcats won the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship in 1961 and 1962, both times against Ohio State.

The Victory Bell awarded to the winner of each contest. The teams take each other on annual in many other sports. Unfortunately, the teams have not played in men's basketball since 2011. ===Xavier=== In basketball, the Bearcats' crosstown rival is the Xavier University Musketeers. Xavier is located less than 3 miles from the University of Cincinnati's main campus. The Bearcats and the Musketeers meet annually in the popular Crosstown Shootout. Cincinnati and Xavier used to have a fierce rivalry in football, before Xavier eliminated their program after the 1973 season. The schools routinely battle each other in other sports annually as well. ===Louisville=== Cincinnati and the University of Louisville battled annually for the Keg of Nails. This rivalry dated back to 1929, but ended when Louisville joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in 2014. The men's basketball teams of both schools have also participated in a fierce rivalry historically, with Louisville leading the all time series 53\u201343. The schools continue to play in other sports, primarily an annual game in baseball. ===Memphis=== The rivalry between these two schools dates to their first men's college football game in 1966, and has continued across all sports, with the basketball series gaining attention as well, having started in 1968. Interest in the series was renewed with both teams reuniting in the American Athletic Conference and Memphis's basketball reemergence. Football has also intensified, with both teams playing in the 2019 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game. ===Others=== When Cincinnati joined the Big East in 2005, they and the University of Pittsburgh started the River City Rivalry. The game is a battle for the River City Rivalry trophy. In 2013 the rivalry series ended due to Pittsburgh's exit from the Big East to the Atlantic Coast Conference. Cincinnati and the Dayton Flyers were another regional rivalry that has lost significance recently. The teams would play periodically in football, before Dayton went down to NCAA Division III in 1977. The teams also frequently played in men's basketball, though the series has ceased since 2011. Cincinnati also has had intermittent rivalries with the Ohio State Buckeyes, Ohio Bobcats, and the Kentucky Wildcats. Although Cincinnati does not play these schools regularly, these are geographic rivals and are all universities of similar size and stature. In 1961 and 1962 Cincinnati defeated Ohio State in both of its back-to-back national title games in basketball. ==Athletic facilities== The UC Bearcat Band charges down Nippert Stadium's steps.
