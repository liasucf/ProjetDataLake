One Struggle\" to advocate for solidarity.

Trans Homoz DZ partnered with Franco-Algerian doctor and imam Ludovic-Mohamed Zahed and with the French organization Homosexuels Musulmans de France, also known as Musulmans Progressistes de France. In 2017, Zak Otsmane, a refugee and member of Trans Homoz DZ, was reportedly attacked in Marseille by two former legionaries, who were later indicted for the assault. == See also == * Official website * Publications == References == Category:LGBT culture in the Arab world Category:LGBT organizations based in Africa Category:Organisations based in Algeria Category:LGBT in Algeria ",
