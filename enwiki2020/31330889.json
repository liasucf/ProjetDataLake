    "text": "The Strohg\u00e4u Railway () is a branch line in the Stuttgart region of the German state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. It is single-track and standard gauge, and is long. It links Weissach and Hemmingen with Korntal, where a connection is made with line S6 of the Stuttgart S-Bahn, which provides a direct service to Stuttgart. The Strohg\u00e4ubahn is owned and operated by the W\u00fcrttembergische Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft (WEG), a member of the Veolia Transport group. The line dates back to 1906, when it was originally opened by WEG. Passenger services on the Strohg\u00e4ubahn use a fleet of 10 single unit railcars. Of these, 2 are Stadler Regio-Shuttle RS1 units with a partial low floor, whilst the remaining 8 units are high floor vehicles. The typical service pattern consists of two trains an hour between Hemmingen and Komtal, although the frequency may reduce to one train an hour on Saturdays or in the evenings, with no service on a Sunday. Only very infrequent trains run beyond Hemmingen to Weissach, but in peak periods trains are extended from Komtal over the S-Bahn route to Stuttgart-Feuerbach. == Gallery == File:Hemmingen Bahnhof.jpg|The station building at Hemmingen File:WEG VT 411 Schwieberdingen 1996 neuer Bahnsteig.jpg|An NE 81 unit at Schwieberdingen station File:RS1 M\u00fcnchingen.jpg|An RS1 unit in M\u00fcnchingen station == References == == External links == * Category:Railway lines in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ",
