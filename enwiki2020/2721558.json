    "text": "Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor is the eleventh studio album by Canadian folk rock musician Neil Young, and his fourth with American rock band Crazy Horse, released in November 2, 1981. == Content == === Musical style === The album marked Young's first use of the Synclavier, which would be featured heavily on the subsequent albums Trans (1982) and Landing on Water (1986). The song \"Shots\" had originally been performed live in 1978 as a ballad. In 2003, Greg Cot of Chicago Tribune proclaimed that Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor \"works up a punk-blues racket [...] that sounds as shaggy and disheveled as anything the Replacements recorded\". AllMusic opined the album to contain \"guitar-drenched hard rock made up of thrown-together material\". === Packaging === The album features the Serenity Prayer on its back cover (\"'Deus dona mihi serenitatem accipere res quae non possum mutare fortitudinem mutare res quae possum atque sapientiam differentiam cognoscere'\" \u2013 \"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference\"). == Release == It was unavailable on compact disc until it was released as a HDCD-encoded remastered version on August 19, 2003, as part of the Neil Young Archives Digital Masterpiece Series. == Reception == William Ruhlmann of AllMusic was largely dismissive of Re\u00b7ac\u00b7tor, awarding the record only two-out-of-five stars, although praised \"Shots\" as \" a more substantive and threatening song given a riveting performance\". ==Track listing== All tracks are written by Neil Young. ;Side one # \"Opera Star\" \u2013 3:31 # \"Surfer Joe and Moe the Sleaze\" \u2013 4:15 # T-Bone\" \u2013 9:10 # \"Get Back on It\" \u2013 2:14 ;Side two # \"Southern Pacific\" \u2013 4:07 # \"Motor City\" \u2013 3:11 # \"Rapid Transit\" \u2013 4:35 # \"Shots\" \u2013 7:42 ==Personnel== *Neil Young \u2013 vocals, guitar, Synclavier, piano, handclaps *Frank Sampedro \u2013 guitar, synthesizer, vocals, handclaps *Billy Talbot \u2013 bass, vocals, handclaps *Ralph Molina \u2013 drums, percussion, vocals, handclaps ==References== ==External links== *Lyrics at HyperRust.org Category:1981 albums Category:Neil Young albums Category:Albums produced by David Briggs (producer) Category:Reprise Records albums Category:Albums produced by Neil Young Category:Hard rock albums by Canadian artists Category:Crazy Horse (band) albums Category:Punk blues albums Category:Punk rock albums by Canadian artists Category:Punk rock albums by American artists Category:Blues rock albums by American artists Category:Blues rock albums by Canadian artists ",
