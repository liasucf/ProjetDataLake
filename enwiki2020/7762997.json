    "text": "Wildest Dreams Tour is the seventh concert tour by American singer Tina Turner. The tour supported her eighth studio album Wildest Dreams. The tour is Turner's biggest outing to date, performing over 250 dates in Europe, North America and Australasia--surpassing her Break Every Rule Tour in 1987. Lasting nearly 16 months, the tour continued her success as a major concert draw. It was sponsored by Hanes, as Turner became the spokesperson for their new hosiery line. ==Background== Shortly after the release of the James Bond theme \"GoldenEye\", Turner announced that she would embark on a tour in the Spring of 1996. The tour unofficially began with six rehearsal dates in Asia, Africa and Europe. In April 1996, Turner performed a private concert for the niece of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah of Brunei. During rehearsals, Turner performed her only concerts to date in the southeast Asia region and Africa. While performing in Johannesburg, Turner was joined onstage by Vusa Dance Company to perform \"Do What You Do\". After the performance, Turner approached dancer David Matamela and gave him a scholarship to the Alvin Ailey Dance School. Despite current issues in South Africa for concert tours, Turner's South African leg proved to be successful playing to over 100,000 spectators. During rehearsals, Turner was not impressed with the stage design. She felt the stage was too dark and felt awkward to perform on. It was later reworked to Turner's liking. Elements of the stage can be seen in Turner's 50th Anniversary Tour. While promoting the North American leg of the tour, it was announced talk show personality Oprah Winfrey would follow the tour with her syndicated talk show from Houston to New York City. Winfrey described the event as her dream stating, > \"She is our goddess of rock 'n' roll. We are going to be right there with > Miss Tina. We're going on tour with Tina. 'The Oprah Show' is actually going > on the road with Tina. I am the biggest Tina Turner fan there is. It is my > wildest dream.\" In her own words, Turner believed this could be her best tour in North America. She further commented, > \"It could be my best tour ever in America. When I walk on stage, there's > such a feeling of faces looking back at me with love and admiration. [And] > it turns into a togetherness. It really is about a desire from the people. > The last tour I actually announced to my audience that I would be back. It > was only because of that feeling, because that's the kind of audience I > have.\" ===Death of Kenny Moore=== During the tour, pianist Kenny Moore suffered health problems. In Sydney, New South Wales, he was admitted to the hospital and later pronounced deceased due to apoplexy. Moore had worked with Turner since 1977. Chuckii Booker replaced Moore for the remaining dates of the tour. Turner dedicated every performance thereafter to Moore. ===Bomb scare in New Zealand=== After successfully touring New Zealand with her last feat, Turner returned to an expanded tour in the region. The leg proved to be a success for Turner as dates quickly sold out. However, during her concert in Wellington, New Zealand, Turner was removed from the stage and the building was later evacuated by local police due to a possible bomb at the venue. After a full sweep of the building, Turner resumed the concert nearly three hours later. The same incident happened in Palmerston North. ==Opening acts== *The Accelerators (Paris, May 1996) *Jimmy Barnes (Australasia) *Tony Joe White (New Zealand) *Cyndi Lauper (North America) *Chris Isaak (Wantagh) *Belinda Carlisle (England, end of 1996) *Toto (Gateshead International Stadium and Don Valley Stadium, Sheffield, July 1996) *Brian Kennedy (Dublin, June 1996) ==Set list== ===Additional notes=== *During performances at the Palais Omnisports de Paris-Bercy in Paris, France (May 1996), Turner performed \"Unfinished Symphony\" with Bruce Willis and his band, \"The Accelerators\". *During the performances at the Amsterdam Arena in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, Turner performed \"Something Beautiful Remains\" for the concert filming. The song was performed in lieu of \"Dancing in My Dreams and was not included in any other performance during the tour. ==Tour dates== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !
