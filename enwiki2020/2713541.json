    "text": "Appointment with Venus () is a novel by Jerrard Tickell published by Hodder & Stoughton in 1951, leading to a British film adaptation the same year and a Danish film adaptation in 1962. The story is based on a real incident of the evacuation of Alderney cattle from the Channel Island during World War II.Alderneysociety.org ==Plot summary== In 1940, after the fall of France, the fictitious Channel Island of Armorel is occupied by a small garrison of German troops under the benign command of Hauptmann Weiss. He finds that the hereditary ruler, the Suzerain, is away in the army, leaving the Provost in charge. Back in London, the Ministry of Agriculture realise that Venus, a valuable pedigree Guernsey cow, remains on the island. They petition the War Office to mount a rescue operation, and Major Valentine Morland is assigned the mission, with the assistance of the Suzerain's sister Nicola Fallaize who joined the A.T.S. at the outbreak of war. They travel to Armorel by submarine, contact the Provost and other friends on the island, and discover that Weiss, a cattle breeder in civilian life, is about to have the cow shipped to Germany. By a series of elaborate deceptions, they extract Venus from Weiss's command and succeed in returning her to England. ==Armorel== The island of Armorel appears to be a fictionalised version of Sark. Sark was used as a location when making the film adaptation. ==Other adaptations== BBC World Service broadcast a 4-part dramatisation by Michael Bartlett featuring Karen Archer and Michael Cochrane in 1992. A 1993 audio cassette version of the novel was produced by Soundings Ltd (). ==See also== *Appointment with Venus (1951 British film adaptation) *Venus fra Vest\u00f8 (1962 Danish film adaptation) *Laura Secord and her cow during the War of 1812 ==References== Category:1951 British novels Category:Novels set during World War II Category:Novels set in the Channel Islands Category:British novels adapted into films Category:Fiction set in 1940 Category:Hodder & Stoughton books ",
