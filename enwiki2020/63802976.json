One of the individuals was caught hoarding over 9,000,000 images and 15 terabytes of child pornography. The investigation began about 5 years prior, when a Belgian man was taking pictures of children in bathing suits on a beach in Blankenberge, West Flanders which caught the attention of a Belgian police officer. Until recently, 110 victims including mostly male children and babies were identified, along with 90 suspects. According to federal police, this was \"one of the biggest cases of sexual abuse of minors ever known\" in Belgium. ==References== Category:Belgian pornography ",
