    "text": "Nicholas James Yarris (born 1961) is an American writer and professional speaker who spent 22 years on death row after being wrongfully convicted of murder. Yarris has stated he was the victim of sexual abuse as a child, although his family doubt this allegation. This made him a wild, uncontrollable boy addicted to alcohol, drugs and petty crime in his teens. One day Yarris and a friend stole a car. When they got to a garage, the owner offered them $200 for the car. Yarris and his friend accepted and began stealing cars in order to raise money for their growing drug addiction. On one of these occasions, Yarris was blasting music while driving under the influence when he was stopped by police in his native state of Pennsylvania. The officer and Yarris got into a physical confrontation, and a shot was fired, The policeman managed to handcuff Yarris, put him in the back of his car and call for reinforcement. Yarris was then charged with stealing a car, driving under the influence, the kidnapping of a police officer, attempted murder of a police officer, reckless endangerment, possession of a firearm, robbery and resisting arrest. While in jail, Yarris, facing life in prison, spotted a newspaper article about the murder and rape of Linda Mae Craig. In The Fear of 13, the documentary based on his life, Yarris recalls how \"something about that newspaper kept calling me.\" To try and get out of jail time, he claimed that a man named Jimmy, a former drug addict thought to be dead by overdose, was involved in the rape and murder of Linda Mae Craig. When Jimmy turned up alive and with no involvement in Craig's murder, Yarris became the number-one suspect. In 1981, Yarris was charged with the abduction, rape and murder of Craig, a woman he had never met in his life. At the time, Yarris was a 20-year-old drug addict who had been thrown out on the streets by his family. The original charges, including the attempted murder of a police officer, were dismissed when the policeman involved told the jury he had been punched by Yarris, but then failed to corroborate his version through photographic evidence. In a second trial, however, Yarris was found guilty of murdering Craig. In 1982 Yarris, 21 at the time, was sentenced to death and sent to death row. In 2003, DNA evidence proved that he had not committed the crime, and in 2004 he was released. After his release, Yarris moved to the UK where he married his second wife and had a daughter who he is estranged from. His wife subsequently divorced him on the grounds of adultery. He then met his third wife and moved back to the USA where she divorced him. After moving back to the UK, Yarris met his current and fourth wife who appears to still be with him although he has recently admitted to committing further adultery. He sued the Delaware County District Attorney's Office for malicious prosecution and the case eventually settled for $3 million in 2008. Despite receiving this settlement, along with other substantial amounts for 'The Fear of 13', 'Seven Days to Life' amongst other projects, Yarris appears to be financially destitute and often asks his social media followers for financial assistance. Yarris is the subject of the documentary The Fear of 13 released in 2015. He is the author of the autobiography Seven Days to Live My Life (2008),. He has also published books called The Kindness Approach (2017), My Journey Through Her Eyes (2017) and Monsters and Madmen (2018). He has an upcoming film which is the follow-up to The Fear of 13, as revealed on the True Geordie podcast. He appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience on September 11th, 2018, talking at length about his experiences.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIc5XYpRc1M Yarris lives in Oregon, USA with his fourth wife Laura and her 2 daughters. == References == Category: Living people Category: Overturned convictions in the United States Category: Place of birth missing (living people) Category: Date of birth missing (living people) Category: People wrongfully convicted of murder Category: 1961 births Category: Rape of males Category: American emigrants to England Category: Writers from Philadelphia ",
