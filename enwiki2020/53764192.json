    "text": "L\u0119bork Castle - a castle built by the Teutonic Order located in L\u0119bork, Pomeranian Voivodeship. The building is found on the river \u0141eba. The castle was built by the Teutonic Order in the fourteenth-century, in the Gothic architectural style shaped as a rectangle without a courtyard. The castle was the capital of the Teutonic vogts. In 1410, the castle came to be in the hands of W\u0142adys\u0142aw II Jagie\u0142\u0142o. During the Thirteen Years' War the castle was part of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, and after the Second Peace of Thorn was given as a fief to the Duke of Pomerania Eric II. In 1637, after the end of the duchy's dynasty, the castle was transferred back to Poland. From 157, the castle was under German rule. Frequently reconstructed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Presently, the castle houses the court house of L\u0119bork. ==References== Category:14th-century fortifications Category:Castles in Pomeranian Voivodeship Category:L\u0119bork County ",
