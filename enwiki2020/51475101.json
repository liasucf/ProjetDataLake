    "text": "The Gulf Coast Premier League (GCPL) is a United States Adult Soccer Association affiliated Amateur Elite League that includes teams from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The regular season of the GCPL runs May through July. On August 13, 2020 it was announced that the GCPL would be the first \"amateur league affiliation\" of the National Independent Soccer Association after Gaffa FC and Louisiana Krewe FC competed in the NISA 2020 Independent Cup. ==Louisiana Premier League== The Louisiana Premier League was formed in 2014 by the Louisiana Soccer Association's Adult Committee members, Jonathan Rednour and Chad Vidrine, with the assistance of Pool Boys FC founder, Jeremy Poklemba. The recent success of a similar formatted competition, administered by the LSA, in the spring of 2014 and the emergence of newly formed clubs, Pool Boys FC and Cajun Soccer Club, along with the interest from Motagua New Orleans from the ISLANO league, offered an opportunity to create a statewide elite amateur league. Motagua New Orleans won the inaugural season, defeating Cajun Soccer Club in the finals, 4-2. On March 8, 2016 the Louisiana Premier League was granted Elite Amateur League status by the United States Adult Soccer Association. ==Gulf Coast Premier League== On August 1, 2016 the Louisiana Premier League, sanctioned and operated by the Louisiana Soccer Association, folded to make way for the newly formed Gulf Coast Premier League. The league formed as a non-profit organization expanding itself to clubs outside Louisiana along the gulf coast. In January 2017 the league announced three expansion teams, expanding the league footprint into Alabama and Florida. Central Texas Lobos FC were announced as a future member in June 2017. ===Developmental League=== A 4-team developmental league called the Gulf Coast Development League (GCDL) was announced and began play in May 2019. ==Great Plains Premier League== In 2019, the GCPL announced the creation of the Great Plains Premier League (GPPL), an expansion conference/sister league with teams to be based in the Dakotas, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas or Missouri. The GPPL will begin play in 2020 and the first team to join, Nebraska Bugeaters FC, would play their 2019 season as exhibition-only.https://www.gcplsoccer.com/bugeaters-fc-joins-the- gcpl/https://www.plainsleague.com/s/GPPL-Info-11-18.pdf ==Teams== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |- ! style=\"background:white\" | Team ! style=\"background:white\" | City ! style=\"background:white\" | Stadium ! style=\"background:white\" | Founded ! style=\"background:white\" | Inaugural season ! style=\"background:white\" | Head Coach |- ! style=\"text-align:left; background:gray;\" colspan=\"6\"| West Division |- | Pool Boys FC | Alexandria, Louisiana | Wildcat Field at Louisiana College | 2013 | 2014 | Jeremy Poklemba |- | Cajun Soccer Club | Lafayette, Louisiana | LUS Fiber Field | 2013 | 2014 | Mark Hiller |- | Central Texas Lobos FC | Buda, Texas | Bob Shelton Stadium | 2015 | 2018 | Jorge Cruz |- | Shreveport United | Shreveport, Louisiana | Cargill Park | 2016 | 2018 | Francois Browne |- | Louisiana Krewe FC | Lafayette, Louisiana | Ragin' Cajuns Soccer/Track Facility | 2018 | 2019 | Joan Olivia |- ! style=\"text-align:left; background:gray;\" colspan=\"6\"| Central Division |- | Baton Rouge SC | Baton Rouge, Louisiana | Olympia Stadium | 2016 | 2017 | Michael Zanco |- | Crescent City FC | New Orleans, Louisiana | TBD | 2015 | 2020 | TBD |- | FC New Orleans | New Orleans, Louisiana | Pan American Stadium | 2018 | 2019 | Wilmer Peralta |- | Gaffa FC | Jackson, Mississippi | Freedom Ridge Park | 2016 | 2017 | Humberto Pel\u00e1ez |- | Mississippi Blues SC | Jackson, Mississippi | Harper Davis Field | 2018 | 2018 | Kurt Albrecht |- | Northshore United FC | Covington, Louisiana | Wolverine Stadium | 2017 | 2018 | Chris Penton |- ! style=\"text-align:left; background:gray;\" colspan=\"6\"| East Division |- | Gulf Coast Rangers FC | Fairhope, Alabama | Fairhope Municipal Stadium | 2017 | 2018 | Daniel Whelan |- | Hattiesburg FC | Hattiesburg, Mississippi | Crusader Field | 1980 | 2019 | Barry Farrell |- | Mobile United FC | Mobile, Alabama | The Jungle | 2010 | 2020 | Kevin deLange |- | Pensacola FC | Pensacola, Florida | Ashton Brosnaham Stadium | 2017 | 2017 | Austin King |- ! style=\"text-align:left; background:gray;\" colspan=\"6\"| Great Plains (Expansion Teams) |- | Nebraska Bugeaters FC | Omaha, Nebraska | Morrison Stadium | 2018 | 2020 | Scott Robertson |- |} ===Former Teams=== *AFC Mobile (Mobile) (2017\u20132019, moved to National Premier Soccer League) *BOCA FC (Shreveport) (2015\u20132019) *Lake City Gamblers (Lake Charles) (2014\u20132017) *Louisiana Fire (New Orleans) (2016\u20132017) *Motagua New Orleans (New Orleans) (2014\u20132019) *Nicholls State University Club (Thibodaux) (2014\u20132015) *Port City FC (Gulfport) (2016\u20132019, moved to National Premier Soccer League) *Real United Riverhawks FC (Moss Point) (2018) *Shreveport Rafters FC B (2016\u20132017) *Tallahassee SC (Tallahassee) (2019, moved to National Premier Soccer League) ==Seasons== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
