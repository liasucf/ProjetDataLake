    "text": "Cyprus has a thriving radio landscape, with 93% of Greek Cypriots tuning in every day. Most stations broadcast in FM, and there's a mixture of state and private-run stations. This article lists all radio stations broadcasting in the southern part of Cyprus and overviews the major stations broadcasting from Northern Cyprus. The British sovereign military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia also operate radio transmitters. In addition to domestic broadcasts, Cyprus hosts international broadcast centers beaming content to the Middle East. ==Republic of Cyprus== ===Public stations=== The Cyprus Broadcasting Corporation charter mandates a diverse radio programme with national coverage. It currently produces 4 radio programmes. The table below only includes high- power transmitters and omits low-power transmitters that serve as gap-fillers for areas with difficult reception. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size:90%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|FM Frequencies MHz ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|AM Frequencies kHz ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Native Name ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|English Name ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|On air since ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Description |- |97.2, 92.4, 91.4, 105.0 |963, 693 |\u03a0\u03c1\u03ce\u03c4\u03bf \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a1\u0399\u039a |CyBC 1st Programme |1953 |News, talk, education, history, culture and tradition |- |91.1, 93.1, 94.2, 97.9, 100.9 | |\u0394\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a1\u0399\u039a |CyBC Radio 2 |1953 |Turkish, Armenian and English programming aimed to Turkish Cypriots, Armenian Cypriots and non-Greek-speaking residents |- |94.8, 94.0, 96.0, 106.7 |603, 1044 |\u03a4\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03bf \u03a0\u03c1\u03cc\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1 \u03a1\u0399\u039a |CyBC 3rd Programme |1990 |Flagship news, sports and entertainment |- |88.2, 90.2, 90.5, 94.2, 100.9 | |\u03a1\u0399\u039a Classic |CyBC Radio 4 |2018 |24hr classical, jazz and rock music |} ===Private stations=== ====National coverage==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|FM Frequencies MHz ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Website ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Native Name ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Transcription ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|On air since ! style=\"background:#ccc;\"|Description |- |87.7, 93.2, 102.5, 107.4 | |Active | |2017 |News and talk (ex.
