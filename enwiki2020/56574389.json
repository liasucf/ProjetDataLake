She was educated at Nunavut Sivuniksavut in Ottawa before completing an indigenous studies program at the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology in British Columbia. Nunavut Sivuniksavut launched in 1985 and is Canada's oldest and first Inuit post-secondary programme, where Inuit youth learn about the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement. Fraser first attracted widespread attention in 2013 with a series of Inuktitut-language covers of pop songs, most notably Rihanna's \"Diamonds\", on YouTube. She released her debut album, Isuma, in 2014. Her songs include Inuktitut and English language, and musically, combine contemporary pop with traditional Inuit sounds. Fraser was dedicated to sharing Inuit culture with a widespread audience and raising awareness of present-day issues and Inuit rights; many of these themes feature heavily in her music. Her producer reported that she was working on another album, to be called Decolonize, when she died; crowdfunding for the album was underway at that time.'Prayers And Tears For Inuk Singer- Songwriter; Fraser, 26, Killed Herself Christmas Eve', Winnipeg Sun (5 January 2020), A4. Fraser died at her home in Winnipeg, Manitoba, on December 24, 2019, by suicide. According to her family she had suffered through \"childhood traumas, racism and persistent cyberbullying\". Several candlelight vigils in her honor were held at The Forks on 4 January and at the Nicola Valley Institute of Technology in Merritt, BC. ==Musicography== ===Isuma=== Fraser's first album, released in June 2014, was recorded with her bandmates from Sanikiluaq, with seven original and three cover songs. The title means 'think'.\"Nunavut's Kelly Fraser releases first CD, 'Isuma'\", CBC News (10 June 2014). ===Sedna=== Sedna was released on February 25, 2017, by Nunavut's Hitmakerz record label. The title of the album, known as \u14c4\u14d5\u140a\u152a\u1483 (Nuliaju) in Inuktitut, refers to the story of Sedna, the Inuit goddess of the sea, which Fraser decided to modernize in this album. She said, \"The goal of the album is to help heal those suffering from the effects of colonization, including the damaging effects of residential school and forced relocation. There is a great need for Inuit artists to directly speak to those affected from the past.\" The album included the song 'Fight for the Right', released as part of the 'no' campaign in the 2016 Nunavut municipal land referendum, which asked voters whether they were willing to allow the municipality to sell municipal lands.Michele LeTourneau, \"Sanikiluaq singer releases second album\", Nunavut News (6 May 2017). ==References== ==External links== * * * * Family statement Category:1993 births Category:2019 deaths Category:Canadian female pop singers Category:Inuit musicians Category:Canadian Inuit women Category:Musicians from Nunavut Category:Inuit from the Northwest Territories Category:Inuit from Nunavut Category:21st-century Canadian singers Category:21st-century Canadian women singers Category:People from Igloolik Category:People from Sanikiluaq Category:Singers who committed suicide Category:Suicide in 2019 ",
