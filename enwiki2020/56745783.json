Iziaslav fled to Poland after his brothers, Sviatoslav Iaroslavich and Vsevolod Iaroslavich, dethroned him in 1073. Sviatopolk accompanied his exiled father. Historian M\u00e1rta Font proposes that Sviatopolk had most probably fathered children by the time he left Kievan Rus'. One \"Gerasclauus, the son of the king of the Ruthenians\" was listed among the witnesses of the deed of foundation of the Somogyv\u00e1r Abbey in 1091. The document also recorded that Gerasclauus was the son-in-law of Ladislaus I of Hungary. Font associates Gerasclauus with Iaroslav,Historian Gy\u00f6rgy Gy\u00f6rffy proposes, that Gerasclauus was Iaroslav Sviatopolkovich's cousin, Iaroslav Sviatoslavich, but Font emphasizes that Sviatoslavich's connections to Hungary cannot be proven. because Iaroslav's good relationship with the Hungarian kings is well-documented. She says that Iaroslav most probably married Ladislaus I's daughter in the early 1090s. In 1097, his father sent Iaroslav to Hungary to persuade Coloman, King of Hungary to support him. ==Prince== Iaroslav's father, Vladimir Monomakh, Oleg and Davyd Sviatoslavich assembled at Uvetichi on 30 August 1100. They summoned David Igorevich, the Prince of Vladimir-in-Volhynia to their conference. They dispossessed David Igorevich and gave Vladimir-in-Volhynia to Iaroslav Along with other Rus' princes, Iaroslav and his father accompanied Vladimir Monomakh to a campaign against the Cumans as far as the river Don in early 1111. Their united troops defeated the Cumans at Sugrov on 27 March. Sviatopolk Iziaslavich died in Kiev on 16 April 1116. Iaroslav was staying in the town when his father died, but the townspeople offered the throne to Vladimir Monomakh. Monomakh accepted the offer and came to Kiev on 20 April. ==In exile== Iaroslav first fled to Hungary to seek assistance from Stephen II of Hungary. He allegedly soon left Hungary for Poland, because he launched several campaigns against his former principality at the head of Polish troops from 1118, according to the Kiev Chronicle (in the Hypatian Codex). Vladimir Monomach always repelled his attacks. ==Notes== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * Category:Princes of Vladimir-in-Volhynia ",
