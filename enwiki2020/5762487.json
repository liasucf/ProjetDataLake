    "text": "Abrakebabra is an Irish fast-food restaurant chain established in Dublin, Ireland in 1982. When the first Abrakebabra restaurant was opened in Rathmines in Dublin it attracted huge attention catering to late-night crowds with a fresh menu that included introducing the doner kebab to the Irish market. As of 2020, there are 33 Abrekabra restaurants in total, including 11 in Dublin, 5 in Cork, 1 in Northern Ireland (on the A26 south of Ballymena). ==Cards== The Abrakebabra Gold Card (AKA Doner Card) allows the recipient free food for life. It is sent unexpectedly, when a public figure expresses their interest/relationship with the brand. Singer Cheryl Cole received a gold card after telling a radio station that Abrakebabra's kebabs were the best. Actor Colin Farrell stated in an interview that he and Irish musician Bono also have gold cards. Actor Colin Farrell stated in a Jimmy Kimmel interview that he was upgraded to a black card with the serial number 001. ==Gallery== File:Abrakebabra Interior.jpg|Abrakebabra Seating Area File:Abrakebabra.jpg|Abrakebra restaurant on South Anne Street, Dublin File:Corkabra.jpg|Abrakebra restaurant in Cork File:Abrakebabra, Buncrana - geograph.org.uk - 1391903.jpg|Abrakebabra in Buncrana, now closed ==References== ==External links== * Category:Fast-food chains of Ireland Category:Restaurants in the Republic of Ireland ",
