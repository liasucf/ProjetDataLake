He played there for two years from 1992 to 1994, making 53 league appearances and scoring 22 goals. In 1996, he was taken to Skonto Riga, where he showed his high scoring ability, scoring 15 goals in 1 season. In 1997, he started his career abroad, joining the Ukrainian club Shakhtar Donetsk, where he spent three years, playing 48 matches and scoring 14 goals. In July 2000, he left and joined yet another big club \u2013 this time the Russian team Spartak Moscow. He quickly scored 5 goals in 12 games and in December of the same year was signed by the English club Fulham. \u0160tolcers joined Fulham when they were still in the second tier of English football. However, Fulham's victorious 2000\u201301 Division One campaign in his first season at the club got them promoted to the Premier League, and \u0160tolcers scored two goals in the process against West Bromwich Albion (on his debut) and Watford. These were his only two league goals for the club, and he failed to score in the Premier League, making just 10 appearances over 3 full seasons at the top level. He did however score twice in a League Cup tie against Bury in November 2002. In 2004, he joined Yeovil Town, playing 36 league matches and scoring 7 goals in all competitions. In 2005, he left England and signed a contract in Azerbaijan with FK Baku. He only played 10 games for them and scored 4 goals. In 2006, he returned to his native Latvia, rejoining Skonto Riga. In the upcoming season he scored 3 goals in 16 matches for them and was released. In 2007, he joined JFK Olimps R\u012bga as the only experienced player in the team to help youngsters with their development. He played 22 matches and scored 5 goals from 2007 to 2009. In 2009, he once again left Latvia, unsuccessfully trying to get into the Yeovil Town squad after being on trial, and later joining Bath City. He scored 1 goal in 8 matches for them, and in 2010, \u0160tolcers joined Hayes & Yeading United, where he retired from playing football with 1 goal in 9 matches in his final season. == International career == His international debut for Latvia came in a 0\u20130 draw against Denmark on 26 August 1992. He has represented his country 81 times and scored seven goals. He played in the 2004 European Championships, held in Portugal. == Managerial career == After being released from Hayes and Yeading United in May 2010, \u0160tolcers started his coaching career. \u0160tolcers took part in an international project called Concept4Football, helping youngsters who are not older than 16 years to develop their football abilities. On 29 May 2011, \u0160tolcers took part in the London Legends Tournament held at Craven Cottage. In the semi-final match against Chelsea legends, he scored a goal from the penalty spot, but that didn't save Fulham from losing 5\u20131. In 2015, \u0160tolcers was Head Coach for Stevenage FC, coaching U18's. In 2016, \u0160tolcers was appointed his first senior professional coaching role as Head Coach in Lisbon, Portugal for FC G.S.
