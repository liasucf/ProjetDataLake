After the season, the Dodgers underwent some changes among the team management when long time general manager Buzzie Bavasi resigned to take over the expansion San Diego Padres. He was replaced by team vice-president Fresco Thompson. However, Thompson was diagnosed with cancer weeks after taking the job and died in November. Al Campanis became the new general manager for the following season. == Offseason == * November 28, 1967: John Roseboro, Ron Perranoski and Bob Miller were traded by the Dodgers to the Minnesota Twins for Mudcat Grant and Zoilo Versalles.Johnny Roseboro page at Baseball Reference * November 30, 1967: Gene Michael was purchased from the Dodgers by the New York Yankees.Gene Michael page at Baseball Reference * November 30, 1967: Lou Johnson was traded by the Dodgers to the Chicago Cubs for Paul Popovich.Paul Popovich page at Baseball Reference * February 13, 1968: Ron Hunt and Nate Oliver were traded by the Dodgers to the San Francisco Giants for Tom Haller and Frank Kasheta (minors).Ron Hunt page at Baseball Reference * March 26, 1968: Rocky Colavito was purchased by the Dodgers from the Chicago White Sox.Rocky Colavito page at Baseball Reference == Regular season == === Season standings === === Record vs. opponents === === Opening Day lineup === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left\" |+ ! colspan=\"2\" |Opening Day starters |- !Name !!Position |- |Willie Davis || Center fielder |- |Zoilo Versalles || Shortstop |- |Wes Parker || First baseman |- |Al Ferrara || Left fielder |- |Bob Bailey || Third baseman |- |Ron Fairly || Right fielder |- |Paul Popovich || Second baseman |- |Tom Haller || Catcher |- |Claude Osteen ||Starting pitcher |- |} === Notable transactions === * April 3, 1968: Hank Aguirre was acquired by the Dodgers from the Detroit Tigers for cash and a player to be named later.
