    "text": "\u00d3scar Washington Tab\u00e1rez Silva (; born 3 March 1947), known as El Maestro (The Teacher), is a Uruguayan professional football manager and former player who is the head coach of the Uruguay national team. After an unassuming career as a player and after working as a primary school teacher, Tab\u00e1rez embarked on an extensive coaching career which has lasted more than 30 years and included coaching teams in Colombia, Argentina, Italy and Spain. He managed the Uruguay national football team from 1988 to 1990, returning to the job for a second time in 2006. He led the team to fourth place in the 2010 FIFA World Cup, and to victory in the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica. With Tab\u00e1rez, Uruguay qualified for three World Cups, reaching the round of 16 two times, and the semi-finals once. In October 2017 Tab\u00e1rez qualified Uruguay for a fourth time; reaching the 5th position at the 2018 World Cup tournament. On 25 March 2016, two and a half weeks after completing ten years as the manager of Uruguay, Tab\u00e1rez surpassed Francisco Maturana for the head coach with most World Cup qualifying games in South America with 47, with the singularity that he has only managed Uruguay. Tab\u00e1rez also is the fourth-ranked manager with most games at the Copa Am\u00e9rica with 30, participating in six tournaments (1989, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2016 and 2019). In 2012, for his contributions to association football, Tabar\u00e9z became the recipient of the FIFA Order of Merit, the highest honour awarded by FIFA. ==Playing career== During his 12-year senior playing career, Tab\u00e1rez played mainly for modest clubs, representing Sud Am\u00e9rica, Sportivo Italiano (Argentina), Montevideo Wanderers (at the time when they were the first non traditional team from Uruguay to qualify for Copa Libertadores), F\u00e9nix, Puebla in Mexico and Bella Vista. He retired at age 32. ==Managerial career== ===Early career=== In 1980, one year after retiring as a player, Tab\u00e1rez took up coaching at Bella Vista. There he met Jos\u00e9 Herrera, who has worked alongside him as physical trainer ever since. The following year, Tab\u00e1rez was named manager of the Uruguay under-20 team. He would coach the side on two separate occasions. He managed the team at the Pan American Games, in 1983 in Caracas, where Uruguay won the gold medal, defeating Guatemala in the final. Tab\u00e1rez subsequently worked for various clubs in Uruguay, including Danubio, Montevideo Wanderers and Pe\u00f1arol. Around this time he first met his current assistant coaches, Mario Rebollo and Celso Otero. In 1987, Tab\u00e1rez led Pe\u00f1arol to its fifth Copa Libertadores title after defeating Am\u00e9rica de Cali in the tournament final. ===Uruguay national team=== ====1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica==== The Copa Libertadores title was fundamental in Tab\u00e1rez's appointment as manager of the Uruguay senior team, in which the 1989 Copa Am\u00e9rica, in Brazil, was his first major tournament in charge. Uruguay finished in second place, eliminating Diego Maradona-led Argentina in the process, losing to hosts Brazil at the Maracan\u00e3 Stadium. ====1990 FIFA World Cup==== After four games of qualification, Uruguay qualified for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, held in Italy. Uruguay reached the round of 16 of the tournament after a draw with Spain, a loss to Belgium and a win against South Korea. In the round of 16, however, Uruguay was eliminated by hosts Italy. After 34 games, Tab\u00e1rez's first stint ended. The victory over South Korea was the first at the World Cup since 1970 and the last until 2010, also with Tab\u00e1rez as manager. ===Managerial work around Europe and South America=== Tab\u00e1rez later coached Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n giants Boca Juniors for two years. In 1994, Tab\u00e1rez moved to Italy to manage Serie A side Cagliari. After leading them to a ninth- place finish in 1994\u201395, Tab\u00e1rez was hired by Milan. His spell, however, would only last a few months: after a Supercoppa Italiana defeat against Fiorentina at home at the San Siro, a 2\u20133 loss at Piacenza for the league cost him his position. He was replaced by Arrigo Sacchi, and the Rossoneri eventually finished 11th. Tab\u00e1rez then worked with Real Oviedo in Spain, with the club eventually only maintaining top division status in the promotion/relegation play-offs against Las Palmas, winning 4\u20133 on aggregate. He then returned to Cagliari, being sacked after one draw and three losses. After two years in Argentina with V\u00e9lez Sarsfield and Boca Juniors, Tab\u00e1rez spent four years away from football management. ===Uruguay national team=== ====\"The Proceso\"==== On 7 March 2006 Tab\u00e1rez took charge of the national team for a second time, and at that time Uruguay had only qualified for 2002 FIFA World Cup since his first spell as manager as they failed to qualify for 1994 FIFA World Cup (losing to Brazil in the last match in their group), 1998 FIFA World Cup (finished 7th in the Group Stage) and 2006 FIFA World Cup (lost to Australia in the play-off). Also on the same day he presented the \"Proceso de Institucionalizaci\u00f3n de Selecciones y la Formaci\u00f3n de sus F\u00fatbolistas\" (Process of National Teams' Institutionalization and Players' Growth), which established a \"proper way\" of work with the national teams (under-15, -18 and -20 and the senior team), reintroducing the 4\u20133\u20133 formation and setting time for players in which they can study. With the help of the Complejo Celeste, the work were facilitated upon the objectives of the Proceso. As of 29 March 2016, 10 of the 11-most capped players for Uruguay have been part of the Proceso. ====2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica==== Tab\u00e1rez's first tournament saw Uruguay finish in fourth place at the 2007 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Venezuela. In the group stage, Uruguay lost to Peru (3\u20130), drew with Venezuela (0\u20130) and defeated Bolivia (1\u20130). In the quarter-finals, Uruguay met Venezuela again, this time winning (4\u20131). After being eliminated in the semi-finals on penalties (5\u20134) against Brazil (2\u20132), they lost in the match for third place against Mexico, (3\u20131). ====2010 FIFA World Cup==== After a successful play-off against Costa Rica, Tab\u00e1rez and the Charr\u00faas qualified for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, first winning Group A (Uruguay did not win its group since 1954 World Cup in Switzerland, 56 years prior). They drew with France (0\u20130), beat South Africa (3\u20130) and Mexico (1\u20130). In the Round of 16 they beat South Korea (2\u20131). In the quarter-finals, Uruguay faced Ghana and after a draw (1\u20131), they went to extra time. In the last minute of extra time, a penalty kick was missed by Asamoah Gyan, after a handball by Luis Su\u00e1rez. In South Africa, the national team reached the semi-finals for the first time in 40 years, where it lost 3\u20132 to the Netherlands, only conceding five goals in six matches until that point. Uruguay ended the competition in fourth place, after a 3\u20132 defeat against Germany. ====2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica==== In the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica, Tab\u00e1rez led Uruguay to its 15th victory in the tournament, with the national side winning three games and drawing three in Argentina, and only conceding three goals. With these wins, Uruguay became the country with the most wins in the history of the Copa Am\u00e9rica. In 2011 and 2012, under Tab\u00e1rez's leadership, Uruguay remained undefeated in 18 consecutive games from June 2011 to August 2012, a national team record previously set by Juan Carlos Corazzo. With the Copa Am\u00e9rica win, Uruguay qualified for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. ====2012 Olympic Games==== After an 84-year absence, Uruguay returned to the Olympic Games, held in London in 2012. After a victory against the (2\u20131), the team lost the next two games against (2\u20130) and Great Britain (1\u20130), marking the end of the Olympic adventure. Egidio Ar\u00e9valo R\u00edos, Edinson Cavani and Luis Su\u00e1rez were the nation's three overage players at the tournament. ====2013 Confederations Cup==== Uruguay passed the first stage after a 2\u20131 defeat to Spain and two victories (2\u20131 against Nigeria and 8\u20130 against Tahiti). In the semi-finals, they lost 2\u20131 against hosts Brazil and finished in fourth place after a 2\u20132 draw against Italy after penalties. ====2014 FIFA World Cup==== Tab\u00e1rez led Uruguay in its qualification to the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, defeating Jordan in two play-off games, and thus becoming the first Uruguayan manager to do so in two consecutive World Cups. In Brazil, after an opening 3\u20131 defeat to Costa Rica followed by two wins (2\u20131 against England, 1\u20130 against Italy), to finish its group stage, Uruguay reached the Round of 16, Tab\u00e1rez's third time for Uruguay at the World Cup. This also marked the first time an Uruguayan team defeated a European opponent in 44 years, the last time being a win against the Soviet Union during the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. Without star striker Luis Su\u00e1rez in the lineup, however, Uruguay lost to Colombia (0\u20132). ====2015 Copa Am\u00e9rica==== On 19 June, the Asociaci\u00f3n Uruguaya de F\u00fatbol made a video tribute to celebrate Tab\u00e1rez's 150 games at the helm of the Uruguayan national team. In the group stage, Uruguay defeated Jamaica (1\u20130), lost to Argentina (1\u20130) and drew Paraguay (1\u20131) to finish in third position in its group. Uruguay qualified as the top third-placed and met Chile in the next stage. In a game marked with the controversy between Edinson Cavani and Chile's Gonzalo Jara, Uruguay were eliminated after a 1\u20130 defeat. After the tournament, Tab\u00e1rez was suspended for three official games for the incidents of the Chile\u2013Uruguay match, in which Cavani was also suspended for two games. ====2016 Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario==== Uruguay contested the Copa Am\u00e9rica Centenario as part of Group C, Uruguay was eliminated after its three group stage matches, losing to Mexico (3\u20131) and Venezuela (1\u20130) but defeating Jamaica (3\u20130). ====2018 FIFA World Cup==== Despite the suspension after the Copa Am\u00e9rica, and with Celso Otero assisting on the bench, Uruguay won its first two games in the 2018 World Cup qualification, the first time it had done this since the 1966 World Cup qualification, including its first ever win in La Paz against Bolivia. After the game against Chile, a 3\u20130 victory, Tab\u00e1rez equaled Francisco Maturana as the South American coach with the most games in the CONMEBOL qualifiers, with the distinction that Tab\u00e1rez has only represented one nation, Uruguay. Qualification continued in March 2016 with a draw at Brazil (2\u20132) and a home win against Peru (1\u20130). In September 2016, after a 1\u20130 defeat to Argentina, Tab\u00e1rez became the national team manager with the most games with one country, surpassing the record held by Sepp Herberger (167 games) since 1964. The next game saw Uruguay beat Paraguay 4\u20130. In October 2016, Uruguay played two games: a victory over Venezuela (the first in Uruguay for 16 years), and a draw with Colombia in Barranquilla (the first time Uruguay got a point in that city). Also, Luis Su\u00e1rez tied Argentinian Hern\u00e1n Crespo as the top goal scorer in World Cup Qualifications for CONMEBOL. In November 2016 Uruguay defeated Ecuador and lost to Chile. In March 2017 Uruguay was defeated by Brazil and Peru. In June 2017 another two defeats against the Republic of Ireland and Italy led to worries about the performance of the national team. In August Uruguay obtained a draw in the Centenario against Argentina, but a victory in September (the first time ever when visiting Paraguay), returned the team to the running for the World Cup. After the game against Argentina, Tabarez told the press that he might leave Uruguay as manager because of his age. In October Uruguay played against Venezuela (0\u20130) and Bolivia (a 4\u20132 victory), which sent Uruguay straight to the World Cup for the first time since the current Qualification system was implemented and the third time in a row. Tab\u00e1rez arrived to his fourth World Cup as the oldest national team manager. In the group stage, Uruguay defeated Egypt, winning its inaugural game for the first time since 1970. Uruguay the defeated Saudi Arabia to qualify for the next round for the third time in a row for the first time in World Cup history. Uruguay defeated Russia to win three consecutive games for the first time since 1954, and for the first time to win its group, with no goals against and no yellow or red cards. It was the fourth time that Uruguay advanced to the next round with Tab\u00e1rez. Uruguay defeated Portugal and advanced to the quarterfinals to face France. France defeated Uruguay, and would proceed to win the World Cup. Tab\u00e1rez became one of the national team managers with the most World Cups, and the third one representing the same team four times. ====2019 Copa Am\u00e9rica==== Uruguay advanced to the next round after defeating Ecuador, a draw against Japan and a win against Chile. In the next round, Peru eliminated Uruguay in the penalties series. Tabarez reached 30 Copa America games, becoming the fourth in the list of national team managers with most games in the history of the competition. Uruguay ended the entire calendar year with 13 games invict. The last time it happened was in 1987. ===Achievements of \"The Proceso\" era=== ====Team==== #First Uruguayan team to win the Copa Am\u00e9rica since 1995. #First Uruguayan team to reach the FIFA World Cup semi-finals in 2010 since 1970. #First Uruguayan team to qualify for the FIFA Confederations Cup in 2013 since 1997. #First Uruguayan team to qualify of the 2012 Summer Olympics since 1928 Summer Olympics. #First Uruguayan team to beat a hosting nation at the FIFA World Cup since 1950. #First Uruguayan team to beat a hosting nation at the Copa America since 1959. #First Uruguayan team to win over Angola, Estonia, Guatemala, Hungary, Libya Nigeria, Northern Ireland, Oman, Poland, Portugal, Russia (since the breakup of the Soviet Union), Saudi Arabia, Tahiti, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, Uzbekistan and Wales. ====Individual==== #H\u00e9ctor Scarone's goalscoring record of 31 goals which was held for 81 years was broken by Diego Forl\u00e1n in 2011, and also Luis Su\u00e1rez is now the leading goalscorer for Uruguay. #Rodolfo Rodr\u00edguez's record for the most caps for Uruguay which was held for 25 years was broken by Diego Forl\u00e1n in 2011 and it turn it was broken by Diego P\u00e9rez in 2012, Diego Lugano and Maxi Pereira in 2013, Diego God\u00edn, Cristian Rodr\u00edguez and Luis Su\u00e1rez in 2014, Edinson Cavani, Egidio Ar\u00e9valo R\u00edos, Fernando Muslera and \u00c1lvaro Pereira in 2016 and Mart\u00edn C\u00e1ceres in 2018. ===World records=== Tab\u00e1rez is presently the first on the list of football managers with most games, that have managed one national team.
