He has served in the National Assembly of Serbia since 2016 as part of the parliamentary grouping of the Serbian Progressive Party (Srpska napredna stranka; SNS). He was previously a candidate for president of Serbia in the 2012 presidential election. ==Early life and private career== Dragi\u0161i\u0107 was born in Belgrade, in what was then the Socialist Republic of Serbia in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and grew up in the Karaburma neighbourhood.\"Serbian paper profiles newly formed Peasants', Workers' Union party,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 7 November 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 2 Nov 11). He graduated from the University of Belgrade Faculty of Security Studies in 1991 as valedictorian and subsequently earned a master's degree (1999) and Ph.D. (2004) from the university's law faculty. He has worked in the department of security studies since 1994, been an associate professor of safety management since 2010, and published extensively in the field.Dr Zoran Dragi\u0161i\u0107, University of Belgrade Faculty of Security Services, accessed 19 April 2017. Dragi\u0161i\u0107's views on defence and national security issues are frequently cited in the Serbian media. In the early 2000s, Dragi\u0161i\u0107 regularly promoted Serbia's cooperation with and eventual membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He remarked in 2005 that better relations with NATO would improve the position of Kosovo Serbs and help the process of Serbia's integration with the European Union.\"Serbia-Montenegro military analysts welcome NATO transit deal,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 21 July 2005 (Source: Glas javnosti, Belgrade, in Serbian 20 Jul 05 pp 4,5); \"NATO accord important for improving ties, Kosovo Serb security - analysts,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 22 July 2005 (Source: Dnevnik, Novi Sad, in Serbian 21 Jul 05 p 3). He also criticized Russian efforts to interfere with Serbia's foreign policy in relation to NATO,\"Analysts against Serbia giving up NATO in return for Russian veto,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 28 March 2007; \"Envoy warns Belgrade Russia \"will have to recognize Kosovo\" if Serbia joins NATO,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 10 February 2010 (Source: Blic website, Belgrade, in Serbian 6 Feb 10). saying that Serbia was a sovereign nation and would ultimately make its own decisions in the matter.\"Analysts shocked at Putin's \"audacity\" to warn Serbia against joining NATO,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 28 March 2011 (Source: Blic website, Belgrade, in Serbian 25 Mar 11). Dragi\u0161i\u0107 also criticized Serbia's decision to gain observer status at the parliamentary assembly of the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization in 2012, arguing that it would not benefit Serbian interests. See \"Analysts view fallout of Serbia's decision to be observer in Russian-led bloc,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 13 December 2012 (Source: Blic website, Belgrade, in Serbian 10 Dec 12). In 2007, Dragi\u0161i\u0107 said that Serbia would be ready to join NATO within three years.\"Serbian defence minister confident Belgrade ready to join NATO by 2010,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 19 June 2007 (Source: Dnevnik, Novi Sad, in Serbian 18 Jun 07). By 2009, however, he indicated that NATO's decision to accept Albania as a member introduced the prospect of Serbia's bid for membership being vetoed.David Vujanovic, \"Enclosed by NATO, Serbia ponders next move,\" Agence France Presse, 5 April 2009. In his view, this changed situation was detrimental to Serbia's territorial integrity; he remarked that if Serbia had joined the Partnership for Peace program earlier and become a NATO member prior to Albania, then Kosovo \"would be part of Serbia and [its] independence would not be an issue.\"\"Serbian governing parties differ on military neutrality, NATO membership,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 14 July 2009 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 7 Jul 09). By 2016, he accepted that NATO membership was no longer a realistic option, saying, \"Serbia [has] clearly stated that it will not join NATO. And nobody has asked us to do it so far. In my opinion, we missed our chance in 2009, when Croatia and Albania joined the alliance.\"\"Serbia caught between NATO and Russia,\" Deutsche Welle, 26 February 2016. There were rumours in December 2005 that Dragi\u0161i\u0107 would be appointed as inspector-general of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro's intelligence-security services.\"University professor to be appointed head of intelligence services - Serbian rad,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 1 December 2005 (Source: Radio B92 text website, Belgrade, in English 1338 gmt 1 Dec 05). This ultimately did not happen, and the state union ceased to exist the following year when Montenegro declared its independence. Dragi\u0161i\u0107 supported Serbia's decision to commemorate the seventieth anniversary of the Liberation of Belgrade with a military parade in 2014, noting that it highlighted the military's anti-fascist tradition and demonstrated to the world that Serbia was a credible country with a serious army.\"Dragi\u0161i\u0107: Srbija ima respektabilnu vojsku\", Blic (source: Tanjug), 14 October 2014, accessed 19 April 2017. Dragi\u0161i\u0107 has said that his favourite book is Ivo Andri\u0107's Bosnian Chronicle.\"Serbian paper profiles newly formed Peasants', Workers' Union party,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 7 November 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 2 Nov 11). ==Political career== ===Before 2016=== Dragi\u0161i\u0107 was a founding member of Vuk Obradovi\u0107's Social Democracy (; SD) party. This party eventually became divided and factionalized, and in January 2008 Dragi\u0161i\u0107 established a breakaway group called the Independent Social Democrats (, NSD).Tom Lansford, ed., Political Handbook of the World 2015. He stated that the latter party's goal was to unify Serbia's left-wing forces for the upcoming 2008 national elections, that it was \"on the verge\" of signing a coalition agreement with the Socialist Party of Serbia, and that the left should rally around Democratic Party incumbent Boris Tadi\u0107 in the 2008 presidential election. He added that most NSD members (including himself) had been opponents of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107's government in the 1990s but that it no longer made sense for Serbian politics to be divided along the lines of former supporters and former opponents of the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 regime.\"Chairman of newly formed Serbian party outlines programme, supports DS's Tadic,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 23 January 2008 (Source: FoNet news agency, Belgrade, in Serbian 1259gmt 23 Jan 08). In August 2009, Dragi\u0161i\u0107 merged the NSD into the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Serbia (; SDPS) led by Rasim Ljaji\u0107.Thomas C. Muller, Judith F. Isacoff, and Tom Lansford, eds., Political Handbook of the World 2012, p. 1255. This proved to be a short-lived alliance; Dragi\u0161i\u0107 became disappointed with the SDPS's direction, left the party, and in October 2011 was chosen as leader of a new group called the Movement of Workers and Peasants (; PRS). At this party's founding conference, he indicated that its purpose would be to \"give the state back to the people\" and noted that it was supported by worker organizations such as Serbia's Union of Raspberry Producers, the Farmers' Association, and the Pig Breeders of Srem and Ma\u010dva.\"Serbian paper profiles newly formed Peasants', Workers' Union party,\" British Broadcasting Corporation Monitoring European, 7 November 2011 (Source: Danas website, Belgrade, in Serbian 2 Nov 11). Dragi\u0161i\u0107 ran under the PRS's banner in the 2012 Serbian presidential election. During this campaign, he pledged to use \"all the state power, including the military, to break the backbone of organized crime, corruption and monopoly system in Serbia.\"\"Zoran Dragi\u0161i\u0107 predsedni\u010dki kandidat\".
