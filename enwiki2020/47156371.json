    "text": "The S\u00f8o or S\u00f8a is a river in the municipality of Heim in Tr\u00f8ndelag county, Norway. The long river originates at Lake S\u00f8o (S\u00f8vatnet), which lies on the border of the municipalities of Orkland, Heim, and Rindal. The lake sits at an elevation of . It then flows into Lake Vassli (Vasslivatnet), which sits at roughly the same elevation, depending on levels behind the dam. The inflow to the S\u00f8o is regulated by a dam high at the west end of Lake Vassli, which serves as a regulation reservoir for the S\u00f8a Hydroelectric Power Station. Its course flows from Lake Vassli through the S\u00f8o Valley (S\u00f8vassdalen) parallel to European route E39 highway. Further down towards the village of Vinje\u00f8ra, it turns northward about east of the village. Norwegian County Road 680 follows the river northwards as flows into Lake Ro (Rovatnet; ). As the water exits the lake, it proceeds about to the east through the village of Kyrks\u00e6ter\u00f8ra before it empties into in the Hemnfjorden. ==See also== *List of rivers in Norway ==References== Category:Rivers of Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Heim, Norway Category:Rivers of Norway ",
