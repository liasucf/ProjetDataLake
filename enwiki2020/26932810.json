    "text": "Respawn Entertainment, LLC is an American video game development studio founded by Jason West and Vince Zampella. West and Zampella previously co- founded Infinity Ward and created the Call of Duty franchise, where they were responsible for its development until 2010. The studio created the Titanfall series, as well as the free-to-play battle royale game Apex Legends. Respawn was acquired by Electronic Arts on December 1, 2017, and developed Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, which was released in November 2019. The studio is developing Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond, which is set to be released in December 2020. == History == Jason West and Vince Zampella had been leads at Infinity Ward, a subsidiary of Activision founded in 2002. Infinity Ward was a principal studio on the Call of Duty series, and in 2007, released Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare, a critical success for the series. West and Zampella leveraged the success of Modern Warfare to renegotiate their contracts with Activision in 2008, asking for large bonuses and creative control of the series in exchange for releasing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 in 2009, which Activision agreed to on the condition that the control would revert to Activision if the pair were fired. From that point, Activision sought ways to trigger that clause, and West and Zampella looked for ways to make Infinity Ward independent. Events came to a head in March 2010 when the two were fired from Activision, forfeiting their bonuses. Several lawsuits followed, with West and Zampella accusing Activision of unpaid bonuses while Activision countersued that the two had conspired with Electronic Arts (EA) to damage Infinity Ward, but these suits were ultimately settled out of court. In April 2010, a month after their release from Activision, West and Zampella set off to form a new independent studio, Respawn Entertainment. They sought funding from EA through the EA Partners Program. West and Zampella will retain the rights to all intellectual property produced by them in the future. As of July 10, 2010, 38 of the 46 Infinity Ward employees who resigned from that studio following the firings of West and Zampella revealed through their LinkedIn and Facebook profiles that they had signed on with Respawn Entertainment. EA Games Label president Frank Gibeau revealed at E3 2011 in June 2011 that Respawn Entertainment's EA-published shooter was \"sci-fi oriented\" and would allow the publisher to \"compete with things like Gears and Halo\". Gibeau also stated that EA would release Respawn's project when it sees an \"opportunistic\" window. Later that month, Respawn released a blurry teaser image of its unannounced game via the official website launched that day. Respawn further released another blurry image, and teased the new game with mo-cap shot. In April 2013, Respawn registered a trademark for the name Titan, and it was reported that Respawn's game was an always-online Xbox exclusive, although nothing had been confirmed. In June 2013, Respawn Entertainment debuted Titanfall at E3. On October 22 they revealed the release date of the game to be March 11, 2014, in North America, and March 13 in Europe. In March 2015, it was announced that Respawn was developing a sequel, Titanfall 2, which was later released on October 28, 2016. In June 2014, it was announced that Stig Asmussen, who previously worked for Sony Santa Monica on the God of War series, had joined the studio as game director of a second project that had nothing to do with Titanfall. From job listings in January 2016, it was found that the project was to be a third person action-adventure game. On May 4, 2016 \u2013 Star Wars Day \u2013 Asmussen announced Respawn Entertainment was making a third-person Star Wars game, later revealed to be Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order at E3 2018. In October 2017, it was announced that Respawn Entertainment is developing a virtual reality first person shooter title for the Oculus Rift, which was formally revealed as Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond in September 2019. In November 2017, Electronic Arts acquired the company for in cash and up to in equity. The acquisition was completed on December 1, 2017. In February 2019, Respawn Entertainment debuted Apex Legends via YouTube livestream. This debut had no prior announcement or marketing. The game was released the same day as the livestream on February 4, 2019. On its tenth anniversary, Respawn announced it was opening a new studio in Vancouver, British Columbia, to focus on ongoing development of Apex Legends. The new studio will be located on the EA Vancouver campus as to be able to tap into their resources. == Games developed == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" ! Year ! Title ! Platform(s) !
