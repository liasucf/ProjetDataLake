He received his first formal drawing lessons from the architect Christian Vilhelm Nielsen (1833\u20131910), then studied perspective at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 1868. Later, he received lessons from Frederik Christian Lund (1826\u20131901) and Eiler Rasmussen Eilersen (1827\u20131912). Jerichau first exhibited in Copenhagen in 1873. Boats Anchored on the Tiber (1871) This was followed by a trip to Italy with his mother. In Rome, he was a pupil of Jean-Achille Benouville (1815-1891), who at that time, was director of the French Academy. After six months there, he made a study trip to Turkey and Greece, spent some time in Paris visited Switzerland and, in 1874, returned to Istanbul with his mother.
