Before the season began, the club only had one player with NSL experience \u2013 former PNG international Samuel Kini. However, on the opening day of the season, the side thrashed Enga Laima 5\u20130 to go top of the league immediately. This opening day victory was their only win in the first half of the season, with the side losing their next four matches by two- or one-goal margins, leaving them fifth out of six sides at the halfway stage. On 30 March, the side picked up a 1\u20130 victory against league leaders Kagua Erave FC, becoming the first team to take any points off Kagua Erave that season. However, this was not enough to revive their campaign fully, and the side finished fourth in the conference with 15 points. == Domestic Record == === National Competitions === * Papua New Guinea National Soccer League **2019: Highlands Conference: 4th == Current Squad == == References == Category:Football clubs in Papua New Guinea Category:Association football clubs established in 2019 Category:2019 establishments in Papua New Guinea ",
