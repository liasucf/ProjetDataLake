    "text": "\"Nuketown\" is a song by American rapper Ski Mask the Slump God, featuring vocals from American rapper Juice Wrld. It was released as the second track off of Ski Mask the Slump God's debut studio album, Stokeley. \"Nuketown\" was the first track that Juice Wrld and Ski Mask the Slump God had recorded in mid 2018; however, it was the only track that would be officially released during Higgins' lifetime. The track is very reminiscent of the loud aggressive tracks that Ski Mask used to release with the late XXXTentacion, with Juice Wrld paying homage to him on his verse on the track. ==Critical reception== The song received positive reviews. Writing for Pitchfork, Trey Alston praised the production and Ski Mask the Slump God's cadence, saying \"[Ski Mask the Slump God] deflects attention from a mid-tempo, bass-heavy beat and allocates it to his jittery cadence\". Donna-Claire Chesman of DJbooth labelled the song \"[a] dark [shout] of the SoundCloud era\". ==Music video== The official music video for \"Nuketown\" was released on October 25, 2019. Directed by Cole Bennett, the video sees Ski Mask the Slump God and Juice WRLD fighting enemies in a desert after their plane crashes. ==Chart performance== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018\u20132019) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 10 |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| Portugal (AFP) | 1856 |} ==Certifications== ==References== Category:Juice Wrld songs Category:2018 singles Category:2018 songs Category:Ski Mask the Slump God songs Category:Music videos directed by Cole Bennett ",
