It is found in Cameroon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon and S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 & Principe (S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9). The wingspan is about 60 mm. Both wings are shining snow white, with a few black markings. The forewings have a trace of an oblique interrupted black dash in the fold and a trace of a median interrupted line, visible as a small black costal mark. There is also a trace of another line in the cell, and a fair sized mark on the inner margin. There is a trace of two very short black costal dashes beyond the cell, followed by a black wedge-shaped costal mark. A bare trace of a black subterminal line is mainly noticeable by a fair sized black mark on the inner margin almost in the tornus. The hindwings are uniform white. ==Subspecies== *Afrocerura cameroona cameroona *Afrocerura cameroona thomensis (Talbot, 1929) (S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9) ==References== Category:Notodontidae Category:Moths described in 1927 Category:Taxa named by George Thomas Bethune-Baker ",
