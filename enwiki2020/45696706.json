For several months, part of the Malagasy population revolted against the French colonial army in a bloody struggle. The repression in villages that followed was terrible, leading to fires, arrests and torture. Women, children and the elderly were the indirect victims of the conflict and suffered particularly from famine and illness. One leader of the MDRM, the party campaigning for independence, arrives in a village. Solo (Fran\u00e7ois Botozandry), the main character, is still too young to fight but he sees his brother and most of the men in his clan join up. His grandmother, Bakanga (Soavelo), knows what will happen, but Solo still hopes his elder brother will return a hero. After months of rumours, he sees instead the French army arrive to crush the rebellion. ==Awards== * Prix du public, Quinzaine des r\u00e8alisateurs, Festival de Cannes, 1988 * Prix du jury, Taormina Film Fest, 1988 * Prix de la premi\u00e8re oeuvre, Carthage Film Festival, 1989 == References == ==External links== * *Raymond Rajaonarivelo \u2013 Tabataba (1988) Category:1989 films Category:Malagasy films ",
