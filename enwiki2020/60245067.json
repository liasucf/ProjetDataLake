He is the author of a rhymed alphabetical treatise in Hebrew on the Hebrew calendar, printed in Kerem \u1e24emed. This poem is interesting for the light it throws on the history of the Jewish calendar as well as on the history of medieval Hebrew poetry. A commentary on Alnaharvanai's verses was later written by Saadia ben Yehuda ben Evyatar in Egypt. ==References== Category:Medieval Jewish poets Category:Medieval Jewish scholars Category:Year of birth unknown Category:Year of death unknown ",
