    "text": "Street of Dreams is a 1988 American action/thriller film directed by William A. Graham and starring Ben Masters and Morgan Fairchild. Made as a television film, Street of Dreams was originally aired on October 7, 1988, on CBS and was subsequently released on DVD on January 10, 2005. The role of a drug addict who--per Fairchild's remarks--\"looks like hell\" marked a departure for Morgan Fairchild, whose career had, up to that point, been defined by roles of glamour and sex appeal. The film follows a laid-back private investigator Kyd Thomas (Ben Masters) who gets thrust into Hollywood's world of crime after he meets Laura Cassidy (Morgan Fairchild). Laura is a cocaine addict who Kyd saves from being beaten and raped and with whom he quickly enters a romantic relationship. The storyline is based on the books Good Night and Good-Bye and Kyd for Hire by American author Timothy Harris which chronicle stories of the life and adventures of a private investigator named Thomas Kyd. Harris has since claimed that he was credited on the film even though he \"didn't really do anything on it\", \"didn't write it, and wasn't involved.\"Nolan, Tom.
