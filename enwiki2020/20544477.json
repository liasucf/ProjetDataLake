In May 1936, at the age of 20, Fielding joined Cardiff City, where he played until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, making a total of 50 appearances in that time. During the war, Fielding made guest appearances for Stockport County and Bolton Wanderers. He officially became a Bolton Wanderers player in June 1944, but never made a league appearance for them. In January 1947, Fielding signed for Manchester United as cover for the injured Jack Crompton in a deal which saw Billy Wrigglesworth move to Bolton. He made his debut on 25 January 1947, playing in the club's FA Cup Fourth Round defeat to Nottingham Forest. He played in seven consecutive games for United, culminating with a 4\u20133 away defeat to Derby County on 15 March. However, he never played for the club again after that, and retired from football in 1948. ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *Profile at MUFCInfo.com Category:1915 births Category:2006 deaths Category:People from Congleton Category:English footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Ashton United F.C. players Category:Cardiff City F.C. players Category:Bolton Wanderers F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:English Football League players Category:Sportspeople from Cheshire ",
