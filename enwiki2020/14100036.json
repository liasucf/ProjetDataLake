    "text": "DWAN (1206 kHz Metro Manila) was an AM station owned and operated by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority. Its studios and transmitter were located in the MMDA's Communications and Command Center in Epifanio de los Santos Avenue corner Orense Street, Guadalupe Nuevo, Makati City. It operates on simulcast at Global Destiny Cable Channel 4 and Traffic Radio 1206 kHz AM band. ==History== The station's aim was to provide real-time traffic updates and public service reminders to inform the public, through safety tips, on how to prevent traffic accidents and some programs aired simulcast on MMDA TV. It operated from 4 a.m. to Midnight from Mondays to Sundays. Prior to MMDA taking over the frequency, the station was known as DWWA 1160/1206, and later DWAN 1206 which was operated by Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation, a company owned by the late Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto. When BBC was dissolved after the 1986 EDSA Revolution, ownership was transferred to the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation. In 1996, DWAN's operation was turned over to Asia Pacific News and Features (ASPAC News), a company founded and owned by publicist Salvador \"Bubby\" P. Dacer. It lasted until 2004. The station has not been broadcasting since July 13, 2010, when it was cut off the air as an effect of Typhoon Basyang (Conson). Both the station and MMDA TeleRadyo permanently ceased operations on August 17, 2010 in order to cut expenses, which were costing the agency at least 1 million pesos every month. ==Programs== *MMDA News (Morning, Evening) *Traffic Updates *Metro Manila, Tuloy sa Pagsulong (talk show) *Mar Maingat (Traffic Safety Tips) *Ikot (Travel Show featuring Various Metro Manila Cities) *Maunlad na Metro *Let's Talk About It One by Juan *Makabuluhang Talakayan with Vic & Vargas *Batas Ng Lansangan *DISKUSYON (Diskarteng Kulang Bibigyan ng Solusyon) *Timbangan *BANYUHAY (Bantay sa Mayuming Buhay) ==References== ==See also== *MMDA TV *Metropolitan Manila Development Authority Category:Radio stations in Metro Manila Category:News and talk radio stations in the Philippines Category:Radio stations established in 2007 Category:Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation Category:Radio stations established in 1978 ",
