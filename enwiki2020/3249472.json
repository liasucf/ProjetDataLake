    "text": "John Aubrey Conway Howarth, (19 February 1896 \u2013 31 March 1984) was an English stage, radio and television actor, best known for his role as grumpy but likeable elderly war veteran Albert Tatlock; an original cast member in the TV series Coronation Street between 1960 and 1984. Prior to his work with Coronation Street, he had a lengthy career in theatre, and in the radio soap opera Mrs. Dale's Diary. ==Biography== ===Early and personal life=== Born at 96 Mitchell Street, Rochdale, Lancashire, Howarth was the son of comedian Bert Howarth, and went to school with the singer and actress Gracie Fields. As a child he sold theatre programmes at the Theatre Royal, Rochdale, and in 1908 at the age of twelve he began playing juvenile roles on stage. He joined the Lancashire Fusiliers in 1914 and served in France and Belgium in World War I.Daily Mirror - 12 November 1980 He married Sarah E. \"Betty\" Murgatroyd at St Mary and St Peter Parish Church, Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire,http://www.yorkshirebmd.org.uk/cgi/marrind.cgi on 25 July 1929. They were married until his death 55 years later. They had a son, John Jr. (born 1930). ===Career=== Howarth ran a small cinema after the outbreak of the First World War, having been a member of the Lancashire Fusiliers during that war. From 1935, he also ran his own theatre in Colwyn Bay, taking most of the male roles himself, due to the lack of men available to play the parts. He toured the country in theatre performances where he met and married his wife Betty in Hull in July 1929. He also appeared in a number of films including The Man in the White Suit (1951) and Hobson's Choice (1954). Howarth made his Coronation Street debut in the first episode in December 1960 and appeared in over 1,300 episodes until his final appearance on 25 January 1984. He hadn't been written out, but was having a spell of time away and was due to return to the set in late April 1984. ===Death=== On 31 March 1984, Howarth died in Llandudno General Hospital from kidney failure and pneumonia, aged 88, with his wife and son John at his bedside. He was cremated six days later at Colwyn Bay. His death meant that Bill Roache, who played Albert Tatlock's nephew-in-law, Ken Barlow, was the only original actor left on Coronation Street at that time. Albert Tatlock was written out shortly after Howarth's real life death, dying off-screen in the episode aired on 14 May 1984. ==Filmography== {|class=\"wikitable\" !Year !Title !Role !Notes |- |1946|| Jeannie || Porter || TV movie |- |1947|| Mine Own Executioner || Party Guest || Uncredited |- |1948|| The Men from the Ministry || || TV movie |- |1949|| Alice's Adventure's in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass || Humpty Dumpty || TV movie |- |1949|| Under the Counter || Mr. Burrouughs || TV movie |- |1949|| The Bear and the Barrier Pigeon || Luka || TV Short |- |1949|| When We Are Married || Alderman Joseph Helliwell || TV movie |- |1949|| The Cure for Love || Hunter || |- |1950|| The Magnet || Auction bidder || Uncredited |- |1950-1956|| BBC Sunday Night Theatre || Timothy \"Tubby\" Wadlow / Mr Bullamy / Cast member 'The Island of Cipango' / Harry Wall / Amos Entwhistle / Ted Munter / Joe Robinson / Sam Ramsdale || 8 episodes |- |1951|| The Man in the White Suit || Receptionist at Corland Mill || |- |1951||A Legend in China || On the Plate: Second Servant || TV movie |- |1952|| Francis and Juniper || Merchant || TV Short |- |1952|| Exercise Hush || Ted, the postman || TV movie |- |1952|| The Secret Garden || Pedler || Episode: \"The Door in the Wall\" |- |1952|| Scotland Yard Inspector || Minor role || Uncredited |- |1952|| The Pickwick Papers || Stout Cricketer || Episode: \"The Second Paper\" |- |1953|| The Great Game || Minor role || Uncredited |- |1953|| The Shadow Man || Landlord || Uncredited |- |1953|| Stand By To Shoot || Tug Wilson || Episode: \"Falling Star\" |- |1953|| The Persian Kitten || Mr Clay || TV movie |- |1954|| Hobson's Choice || Tubby Wadlow || |- |1954|| What Every Woman Wants || Pub Customer || |- |1955|| The Prince and the Pauper || Constable || Episode: \"Hendon Hall\" |- |1955|| Postmark for Danger || Hotel Porter || Uncredited |- |1956|| My Sister and I || Grandfather || 6 episodes |- |1956|| Vanity Fair || Waiter at Vauchhall Gardens || 1 episode |- |1957|| Nathanial Titlark || Croom - Garage owner || Episode: \"O Woodman, Spare That Tree\" |- |1957|| Final at Fernell || Joe Trubshaw || TV Short |- |1957|| The Mail van Murder || Cleaner || Short, Uncredited |- |1957|| Professor Tim || Villager || |- |1957-1958|| Be Soon || || 3 episodes |- |1958|| Champion Road || Mr Briggs || 2 episodes |- |1959|| ITV Play of the Week || Mr Fowle || Episode: \"The Younger Generation\" |- |1959|| The Artful Dodger || || Episode: \"Going, Going, Gone!\" |- |1959|| The Man From Room 5143 || Publican || Episode: \"The Man Who Made Keys: Part 1\" |- |1959|| Glencannon || Mr. Tooth || Episode: \"Pearl of Panama\" |- |1960|| Probation Officer || Mr Boyd || 1 episode |- |1960|| Yorky || Mr Sellby || Episode: \"What's in a Name?\" |- |1960|| Emergency - Ward 10 || Bertie Wallsaw || 1 episode |- |1960|| BBC Sunday-Night Play || Harry || Episode: \"Pay Day\" |- |1960|| Knight Errand Limited || Bootle || Episode: \"The Conspirators\" |- |1960|| The Balloon and the Barron || Mr Brown || TV movie |- |1961|| Armchair Theatre || Uncle Fred || Episode: \"Honeymoon Postponed\" |- |1969|| All-Star Comedy Carnival || Albert Tatlock || TV movie |- |1970|| Spring and Port Wine || 2nd bowler || |} ==Permanent role== {|class=\"wikitable\" |Year |Title |Role |Notes |- |1960\u20131984|| Coronation Street || Albert Tatlock || 1305 episodes, (final appearance) |} ==Honours== Howarth was the subject of This Is Your Life in November 1974 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews on the set of Coronation Street.
