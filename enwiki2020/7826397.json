The high school, located on the eastern edge of Barnesville, was remodeled to expand classroom areas and improve appearances, as well as the addition of a new administrative wing. A new middle school was built beside the high school to rectify the crowded school downtown. The elementary school was remodeled and an older section of the building was removed. The renovations and new school left the school board in a weak financial state, it is now using fundraisers to increase its stability. == Athletics == The school's sports teams' mascot is the shamrock. == See also == * Barnesville High School (Barnesville, Ohio) * East Central Ohio ESC == External links == * Category:Education in Belmont County, Ohio Category:Barnesville, Ohio Category:School districts in Ohio ",
