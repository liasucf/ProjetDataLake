Hansen is the name used by the Danish couple Carla and Vilhelm Hansen to sign their Rasmus Klump comics (in English known as Bruin). ==Biography== Vilhelm Hansen (May 6, 1900 \u2013 December 23, 1992) and Carla Hansen (September 19, 1906 \u2013 December 6, 2001) were an artistic couple. He was a trained lithographist, while she was a writer. Vilhelm worked mainly as an advertising artist between the two World Wars, and only started making comics and illustrating the tales written by Carla in the 1940s. Their collaborative comic Rasmus Klump, about the adventures of a bear, a pelican, a penguin, and some other animals, debuted in Denmark on November 17, 1951, as a daily comic strip. It soon became one of the most popular European children comics, being translated and distributed into many languages and countries, mainly by the publishing houses Carlsen Comics and Casterman. While they no longer wrote or drew the stories after 1965, it was their names that stayed on the albums. ==Bibliography== *De Tidlige B\u00f8rneb\u00f8ger, a series of children books from the 1940s and 1950s illustrated by Vilhelm Hansen *Eventyr, a series of fairy tales written by Carla Hansen in the 1950s *Rasmus Klump, started in 1951: 36 comic albums and some accompanying books and illustrations ==Awards== *2002: Vilhelm Hansen is the subject of a Danish stamp ==External links== *Biography of Vilhelm Hansen *Artwork by Vilhelm Hansen (in Danish) *Fan site, with pictures of Carla and Vilhelm Category:Danish children's writers Category:Danish cartoonists Category:Danish comics artists ",
