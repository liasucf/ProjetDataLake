He attributed most diseases including cancer to autointoxication (defective operation of the alimentary canal) and slow poisoning from constipation.Late Dr Leonard Williams. Outspoken Writer on Health Topics. The Scotsman. (22 August 1939). p. 11 However, the autointoxication hypothesis was discredited in the 20th century as scientific studies failed to support it.Chen TS; Chen PS. (1989).

He stated that raw fruits and vegetables are essential to health and if they are not eaten then vitamin deficiencies emerge.Williams, Leonard. (1925).
