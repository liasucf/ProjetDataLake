    "text": "Miguel \u00c1ngel Castro (born December 24, 1994) is a Dominican professional baseball pitcher for the New York Mets of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played for the Toronto Blue Jays, Colorado Rockies and Baltimore Orioles. ==Professional career== ===Toronto Blue Jays=== Castro signed with the Toronto Blue Jays as an international free agent in 2012, and received a $43,000 signing bonus. He made his professional debut in 2012 with the Dominican Summer League Blue Jays, and earned a 3\u20132 record, 4.73 earned run average, and 20 strikeouts in 20 innings. Castro began the 2013 season with the Dominican Summer League Blue Jays, and was later promoted to the Gulf Coast League Blue Jays and Bluefield Blue Jays. In total, he posted a 6\u20132 record, 1.54 ERA, and 88 strikeouts in 70 innings pitched. His performance in the DSL earned him the Webster Award, given to the best Blue Jays prospect at each minor league level. In 2014, Castro continued his progression through the minor league system, earning promotions to the Vancouver Canadians, Lansing Lugnuts, and Dunedin Blue Jays. He earned an 8\u20133 record, a 2.69 ERA, and 78 strikeouts in 80 innings spread across three minor league levels. Castro was invited to 2015 spring training but was considered to be a long-shot to make the team, and General Manager Alex Anthopoulos stated before camp began that Castro would likely begin the 2015 season in Dunedin. However, after pitching 6 scoreless innings over 4 appearances, with 4 strikeouts and no walks, many believed that Castro had earned a spot on the roster. After Steve Delabar was optioned to minor league camp on March 26, it was reported that Castro would likely make the Opening Day roster as a reliever. His role in the bullpen was confirmed on March 31. Castro made his MLB debut on April 6, 2015, against the New York Yankees. He pitched 1 innings and closed out the game as the Blue Jays won 6-1. At 20 years, 103 days old, Castro became the youngest pitcher to appear for the Blue Jays, breaking a nearly 38-year-old record held by V\u00edctor Cruz. His record was short-lived, however, as it was broken only two days later by teammate Roberto Osuna. After a poor season debut by Brett Cecil, Castro was temporarily moved to the closer role on April 9. He earned his first MLB save that night, closing out a 6\u20133 win over the Yankees. Castro was moved back into a regular relief role in the bullpen on April 28, after recording 4 saves in 6 opportunities. On May 3, Castro was optioned to the Triple-A Buffalo Bisons. ===Colorado Rockies=== On July 28, 2015, Castro was traded to the Colorado Rockies, along with Jos\u00e9 Reyes, Jeff Hoffman, and Jes\u00fas Tinoco, in exchange for Troy Tulowitzki and LaTroy Hawkins. The Rockies optioned him to the Triple-A Albuquerque Isotopes. He was called up by the Rockies on September 1 and made his Rockies debut that day. On April 2, 2017, Castro was designated for assignment. ===Baltimore Orioles=== On April 7, 2017, Castro was traded to the Baltimore Orioles for cash considerations or a player to be named later (Jon Keller). He debuted for the Orioles on May 17 against the Detroit Tigers, striking out one batter in one scoreless inning of relief. He pitched two scoreless innings the following day as well. In his first season with Baltimore, he posted an ERA of 3.53 in 39 games. The following season, he appeared in 63 appearances, posting an ERA of 3.96 in innings. He shared the major league lead in balks, with three.Major League Leaderboards \u00bb 2018 \u00bb Pitchers \u00bb Standard Statistics | FanGraphs Baseball ===New York Mets=== On August 31, 2020, Castro was traded to the New York Mets for pitcher Kevin Smith and Victor Gonzalez. ==Personal life== Castro was born in La Romana, Dominican Republic. His father was a boxer. Castro spent his $43,000 signing bonus on a prostate operation for his father, as well as a surgery to remove his mother's fibrous tumour. ==References== ==External links== : Category:1994 births Category:Living people Category:People from La Romana, Dominican Republic Category:Albuquerque Isotopes players Category:Baltimore Orioles players Category:Bluefield Blue Jays players Category:Bowie Baysox players Category:Buffalo Bisons (minor league) players Category:Colorado Rockies players Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in Canada Category:Dominican Republic expatriate baseball players in the United States Category:Dominican Summer League Blue Jays players Category:Dunedin Blue Jays players Category:Gulf Coast Blue Jays players Category:Lansing Lugnuts players Category:Major League Baseball pitchers Category:Major League Baseball players from the Dominican Republic Category:New York Mets players Category:Toronto Blue Jays players Category:Vancouver Canadians players ",
