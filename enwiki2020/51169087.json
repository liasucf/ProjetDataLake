He edited the Massachusetts State Record from 1847 to 1851 and was the editor-in- chief of the Annals of Phrenology. He wrote several books, of which the most famous is perhaps the History of Democracy. He was, by appointment from President Buchanan, the Postmaster of Boston from 1857 to 1861. As Postmaster, Capen introduced the outside letterbox collection system, the first such system in the U.S. Postal Service. The Ronan Park area on Meeting House Hill was once part of Nahum Capen's estate Mount Ida. ==References== ==External Links== * Nahum Capen papers, 1783-1885 (inclusive), 1826-1885 (bulk). B MS c23.
