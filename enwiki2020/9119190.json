    "text": "Work to Ride (WTR) is an American nonprofit prevention program which seeks to aid disadvantaged urban youth (ages 7 to 19) by offering constructive activities including horsemanship, equine sports (Polo) and education. The program was founded in 1994 by Lezlie Hiner. WTR is based at Chamounix Stables in Fairmount Park, Philadelphia, and gives urban teenagers a chance to come in contact with animals and nature. Children and teens who want to be involved must commit to a minimum of one year of participation in the program; participants are encouraged to remain with the program through their high school graduation. WTR graduates receive assistance with college enrollment; a few also choose to come back to Chamounix and act as mentors to teens entering the program. Despite its humble roots, the Work to Ride program has established themselves as a national powerhouse. In 2011, Work to Ride became the first all-black squad to win the United States Polo Association's national interscholastic championship. In 2012, Work to Ride repeated as national champions. == References == ==External links== *Official site Category:1994 establishments in Pennsylvania Category:Non-profit organizations based in Pennsylvania Category:Organizations established in 1994 Category:Equestrian organizations Category:Polo in the United States Category:African-American history in Philadelphia Category:Sports in Philadelphia ",
