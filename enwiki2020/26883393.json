    "text": "The Land Run of 1892 was the opening of the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation to settlement in the U.S. state of Oklahoma. One of seven in Oklahoma, it occurred on April 19, 1892, and opened up land that would become Blaine, Custer, Dewey, Washita, and Roger Mills counties.Blaine County Oklahoma Genealogy at rootsweb (accessed April 8, 2010)Land Run at OKGenWeb Project (accessed April 8, 2010) The land run also opened up what would become part of Ellis County, but was designated County \"E\" and then Day County prior to statehood. ==Background== The Creek and Seminole were originally relocated to the area in the 1820s and 1830s, but Reconstruction Treaties of 1866 took the land away from both tribes.Wilson, Linda D., \"Blaine County ,\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed June 11, 2010). The Cheyenne and Arapaho were moved to the area from Colorado in 1869. The of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Reservation were opened by a proclamation from U.S. President Benjamin Harrison on April 12, 1892.Reggio, Michael H., \"Cheyenne-Arapaho Opening ,\" Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture (accessed April 8, 2010). The reservation had become a part of the federal public domain after allotment of plots to individual Indians. ==Settlers and developments== A diverse group gathered for the land run. It included Kansans, Texans, Missourians, Oklahomans, African-Americans, Swedes, Bohemians, Germans, and Russians. According to Kiowa chief Big Tree, there were \"as many [people] as the blades of grass on the Washita in the spring.\" Settlers claimed more than 400 lots in what would become Arapaho, the county seat of Custer County.Land Run at Ponca City, Oklahoma (accessed April 8, 2010) The region became cattle country, due to both its geography and the tenacious efforts of cattlemen, who often harassed farmers on the land. ==See also== * Land run * Land Run of 1889 * Land Run of 1891 * Land Run of 1893 * Land Run of 1895 ==References== Category:History of United States expansionism Category:Pre-statehood history of Oklahoma Category:April 1892 events Category:1892 in Oklahoma Territory ",
