It is spoken by the Azande, primarily in the northeast of the Democratic Republic of the Congo and western South Sudan, but also in the eastern part of the Central African Republic. It is called Pazande in the Zande language and Kizande in Lingala. Estimates about the number of speakers vary; in 2001 Koen Impens cited studies that put the number between 700,000 and one million. ==References== ==External links== *PanAfrican L10n page on Zande Category:Languages of the Central African Republic Category:Languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo Category:Languages of South Sudan Category:Zande languages language ",
