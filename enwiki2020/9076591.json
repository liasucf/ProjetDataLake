These player's were named the Man of the Match. This trend continued into the Cricket World Cup. To receive a Man of the Match award in the final generally meant that one had put up a match-winning performance for their team and, in essence, won their team the World Cup. Since 1992, at the end of the World Cup, one player is declared as \"Man of the Tournament\".Cricket World Cup Past Glimpses ===1975 Cricket World Cup=== Man of the Final Match 1975 \u2013 Clive Lloyd \u2013 102 runs from 85 balls The 1975 Cricket World Cup was the first World Cup.

However, Amarnath came in to bowl and took both of their wickets, leaving the West Indies at 8/124, before he trapped Michael Holding leg before wicket to take India to a 43 run victory.

He played 9 matches in the World Cup and almost made it 10 with his final overs cameo against Australia in the semi-final that went in vain as the match was tied.Stats Guru Lance Klusener in the 1999 Cricket World Cup Klusener averaged 140.5 with the bat and 20.58 with the ball in this World Cup.

Apart from making it to the final, they only lost two matches, both to champions Australia. One of the major reasons for this success was the record-breaking performance of \"Little Master\" Sachin Tendulkar. In 11 innings Tendulkar scored 673 runs at an average of 61.18.Stats Guru Sachin Tendulkar in the 2003 Cricket World Cup He started off his World Cup campaign with a 52 against the Netherlands and a gritty 36 against Australia while all else was collapsing. From that point on in the World Cup, he scored consistently. After an 81 and 152 against Zimbabwe and Namibia respectively, he scored 50 against England and 98 against Pakistan in what was the highest successful run chase in the whole World Cup.

However, in the final, he did not perform, scoring only 4 against a mammoth Australia target. Out of his 11 innings, Tendulkar was unlucky to only get 1 century.

Tendulkar remains the record-holder of numerous records in World Cups.See Cricket World Cup records Man of the Final Match 2003 \u2013 Ricky Ponting \u2013 140 not out The final of the 2003 Cricket World Cup was between India and Australia.

Even though he had a golf ball sized tumour around his lungs (that was later diagnosed as cancer) he played his heart out and very significantly helped win India the World Cup. He performed well with both bat and ball in almost all games he played in. He scored a half-century against England and The Netherlands. He impressed with the ball by picking up a 5 for against Ireland, whilst also scoring a half- century. His greatest contribution came against the West Indies, where he scored a hundred on a tough pitch and also picked up 2 wickets, helping India to reach the knockout stages. In the quarterfinals, he played a vital knock against Australia, scoring another half century and picking up 2 wickets. Though he failed to score in the semi-final against Pakistan, he replied with the ball, picking up the important wickets of Asad Shafiq and the experienced Younis Khan. In the final against Sri Lanka, he once again proved his allrounder capabilities, picking up 2 important wickets and providing a winning partnership with MS Dhoni to take India home to a historic win. He scored a total of 362 runs and picked up 15 wickets in the tournament. Man of the final match of 2011 Cricket World Cup: M S Dhoni Man of the Final Match 2011 \u2013 Mahendra Singh Dhoni with 91 (79) runs had led the team from front. He WAS there until the end and made sure that the team crossed the line to lift prestigious trophy in cricket world. Sri Lanka started the innings slowly, constrained by good bowling from Zaheer Khan and committed fielding from Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, and Virat Kohli inside the 30-yard circle. Zaheer began with three consecutive maidens and the wicket of Upul Tharanga, conceding only six runs in his five-over spell. Sri Lankan opener Tillakaratne Dilshan was bowled by Harbhajan Singh when a delivery carried on to the stumps after deflecting off his gloves. Captain Kumar Sangakkara came in after Tharanga's dismissal, and was building a solid foundation with Dilshan before the latter was dismissed. Mahela Jayawardene came to the crease when Sri Lanka were 60/2 in the 17th over. Sangakkara and Mahela went about the task of consolidating the innings, but eventually Sangakkara was caught behind by Dhoni at 48. New batsman Thilan Samaraweera was adjudged not out by the umpire when a ball hit his thigh pad off the bowling of Yuvraj Singh. The Indians decided to review the decision and he was ultimately given out. Chamara Kapugedera, who was playing his first World Cup match, was caught off a deceptive slower ball by Zaheer Khan. Jayawardene, meanwhile, continued with his quality batting, ultimately scoring 103 not out from 88 balls in a high- class batting display. Helped by the hard-hitting of Nuwan Kulasekara and Thisara Perera, Sri Lanka scored 91 runs in the last 10 overs, including 63 in the batting powerplay (45\u201350 overs) to take the score to 274/6 India had a shaky start, with Virender Sehwag and Sachin Tendulkar both dismissed early by Lasith Malinga, leaving them struggling at 31 for two. Sehwag was trapped LBW for a duck on the second ball of the innings. Tendulkar started with some good strokes, racing to 18 off 14 balls, but then edged a catch to wicketkeeper Sangakkara. Virat Kohli and Gautam Gambhir started the recovery with some fluent stroke play and quick running between wickets, taking India to 114 before Kohli was caught-and-bowled by Tillakaratne Dilshan for 35. When he was on 30, Gambhir mistimed a shot off the bowling of Suraj Randiv, sending the ball high up in the air, but Nuwan Kulasekara could not hold on to a difficult chance at long off. Kohli and Gambhir put together an 83-run partnership before Kohli's dismissal. Dhoni came in after Kohli to bat at number five, usually the position of Yuvraj Singh. Both Kohli and Dhoni are right-handed batsmen, while Gambhir and Yuvraj are left-handed. Along with other considerations, by coming ahead of Yuvraj, Dhoni ensured there would be a right-left batting combination between him and Gambhir, which makes it difficult for the bowlers to get into a rhythm, and necessitates frequent field changes. Both Gambhir and Dhoni emphasised on preserving the wickets, and later accelerating with a greater flow of boundaries. Gambhir and Dhoni added 109 for the fourth wicket with Gambhir scoring 97. Gambhir tried to finish his century with a boundary, but his heaving bat failed to connect with the ball, and he was bowled by Thisara Perera. Following Gambhir's dismissal, 52 runs were required off 52 balls. Yuvraj Singh was the new batsman and along with Dhoni took India to victory, and Dhoni sealed the match hitting a six off Nuwan Kulasekara, when only 4 runs were required off 11 balls. Dhoni finished on 91 not out from 79 deliveries. Like in many other day-night matches in the subcontinent, dew started to form on the outfield grass in the night, making the ball damp and difficult to grip especially in the later part of India's batting. However, this was a known factor and was taken into consideration by the Sri Lankan captain when he chose to bat first after winning the toss. By crossing the target of 274, India had set a record for the highest successful run-chase in a World Cup final. At the end of the match, the batting strength of both the teams stood out. The three top run scorers of this tournament were from these finalists: Tillekaratne Dilshan (500 runs), Sachin Tendulkar (482), and Kumar Sangakkara (465). In the top 10 tournament scorers, there were three from Sri Lanka (Upul Tharanga (395) in addition to the previous two), and four from India (Gautam Gambhir (393), Virender Sehwag (380), and Yuvraj Singh (362) in addition to Sachin). ===2015 Cricket World Cup=== Man of the Tournament 2015 \u2013 Mitchell Starc \u2013 22 wickets The Australian fast bowler was notable for his yorkers and wicket-taking deliveries in the World Cup.

He was very supportive by his fellow bowlers James Faulkner, Josh Hazlewood, Mitchell Johnson. In the final Australia took on New Zealand at MCG where Australia started as favourites. In the first over of the final, New Zealand Captain Brendon McCullum was bowled for 0 by Mitchell Starc. It was the big moment of the final. Australia then went on to win the match by 7 wickets to become 5-time world champions. Starc was named as the player of the tournament for his outstanding bowling, yorkers and wicket-taking deliveries. He finished with 22 wickets and joint highest with Trent Boult for the most wickets at 2015 world cup === 2019 Cricket World Cup === Man of the Tournament 2019\u2013 Kane Williamson \u2013 578 runs and 2 wickets (for his captainship as well) ==See also== *Cricket World Cup records *History of the Cricket World Cup ==References== Awards ",
