    "text": "Eadwine was an Ealdorman of Sussex. His death was recorded in 982 and he was buried Abingdon Abbey in Berkshire, where one version of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle was compiled. According to the abbey\u2019s records, in which he was called princeps Australium Saxonum, Eadwinus nomine, he bequeathed estates to them in his will, although the document itself has not survived. Earlier in the same year he witnessed a charter of King \u00c6\u00f0elr\u00e6d Unr\u00e6d http://www.anglo- saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query;=S+839 as Eaduuine dux. His name was also added to a forged charter dated 956 (possibly an error for 976).http://www.anglo-saxons.net/hwaet/?do=seek&query;=S+828 ==References== ==External links== * Category:982 deaths Category:10th-century English monarchs Category:Anglo-Saxon ealdormen Category:Year of birth unknown Category:South Saxon monarchs ",
