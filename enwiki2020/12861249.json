    "text": "The John Tyndall Award is given to the \"individual who has made pioneering, highly significant, or continuing technical or leadership contributions to fiber optics technology\". The award is named after John Tyndall (1820-1893), who demonstrated for the first time internal reflection. This award is sponsored and presented by both the IEEE Photonics Society (formerly called IEEE Lasers and Electro-Optics Society) and The Optical Society (OSA). Recipients of this award will receive a special crystal sculpture that represents the concept of total internal reflection (endowed by Corning, Inc.), a scroll, and an honorarium. == Recipients == Following people received the John Tyndall Award: * 2020: Roel Baets * 2019: Kim Robertshttps://www.ciena.com/insights/articles/Honoring-Cienas-Kim-Roberts--- recipient-of-the-2019-John-Tyndall-Award.html * 2018: Peter J.
