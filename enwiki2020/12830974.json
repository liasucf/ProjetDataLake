    "text": "Avinguda Tibidabo is a station of the Barcelona Metro and is the terminus of FGC-operated line L7 (also known as L\u00ednia de Balmes). The station is situated under Carrer de Balmes at Pla\u00e7a de John F. Kennedy, the former street's junction with the Avinguda Tibidabo and Passeig de Sant Gervasi. The station was opened in 1954, along with the rest of the branch from the junction at Gr\u00e0cia station. It has a single terminal track, which ends at a buffer within the station. Just outside the Gr\u00e0cia end of the station, this track diverges into the twin running tracks of the L7. The terminal track is flanked on both sides by long platforms, which can accommodate a three car train. A concourse at the terminal end of the station is linked by four lifts or a long stairway to a subsurface ticket hall under Pla\u00e7a de John F. Kennedy. This has a single entrance, in the centre of the square. Here connection is made with the historic Tramvia Blau, which provides a link to the Funicular del Tibidabo and hence Tibidabo itself. Several bus routes also serve the station. ==See also== *List of Barcelona Metro stations *List of FGC stations *List of railway stations in Barcelona ==References== ==External links== * * Information and photos about the station at Trenscat.com Category:Barcelona Metro line 7 stations Category:Transport in Sarri\u00e0-Sant Gervasi Category:Railway stations opened in 1954 ",
