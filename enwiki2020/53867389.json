In the early 2000s, Thirumurugan moved to Chennai to pursue his dreams of becoming a film director and was initially financially supported by his father and sister. He then befriended director Sargunam, who introduced him to director A. L. Vijay, with whom Thirumurugan worked as an assistant in more than 50 commercials and some of his films. When Sargunam got a chance to direct Kalavani (2010), Thirumurugan became his co-director, before then being asked to appear as the antagonist in the film. In 2011, Thirumurugan planned to debut as a director with a film starring Vimal in the lead role, but the project was later shelved. After more supporting roles in projects including Aravaan (2012) and Eetti (2015), Thirumurugan was cast in the lead role in Onan (2017) by director Sennan Palassery. ==Filmography== *Kalavani (2010) *Mudhal Idam (2011) *Aravaan (2012) *Ennamo Nadakkudhu (2013) *Parankimala (2014) (Malayalam) *Naalu Policeum Nalla Irundha Oorum (2015) *49-O (2015) *Eetti (2016) *Pencil (2016) *Kattappava Kanom (2017) *Puyala Kilambi Varom (2017) *Onan (2017) *Torchlight (2017) == Awards and nominations == *Tamil Nadu State Film Award for Best Villain for Kalavani (2010) ==References== == External links == * Category:Living people Category:Male actors in Tamil cinema Category:21st-century Indian male actors Category:Tamil comedians Category:Male actors from Tamil Nadu Category:People from Thanjavur district Category:Male actors in Malayalam cinema Category:Indian male film actors Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
