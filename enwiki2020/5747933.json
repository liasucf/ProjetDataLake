The chain has been a subsidiary of the Japan-based APA Group since 2016. APA Group has caused some controversy in the past due to their owner's far right Japanese nationalist books distributed in APA's Japanese properties. Controversy extended to Canada in 2017 when antisemitic remarks by founder and CEO of APA Group, Toshio Motoya, were distributed in Coast Hotels Canadian properties. Coast Hotels range from suburban and airport properties such as those in Greater Vancouver; Edmonton, Alberta; Calgary, Alberta; Seattle, Washington and Portland, Oregon to resort-designated properties such as: The Coast Osoyoos Beach Hotel in Osoyoos, British Columbia; The Coast Sundance Lodge in Sun Peaks, British Columbia; the Hillcrest Hotel, a Coast Resort in Revelstoke, British Columbia; and the Coast Capri Hotel, in Kelowna, British Columbia.
