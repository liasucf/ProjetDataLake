SAF was founded in 1928, as a splinter group from Sveriges Arbetares Centralorganisation (SAC). SAF published the weekly newspaper Arbetare-kuriren from G\u00f6teborg. SAF criticised SAC of centralism and bureaucracy. SAF consistently tried to keep its membership dues low, in order to attract low- paid workers.A history of Anarcho-syndicalism: Unit 10: Sweden - 1889-1939 http://www.selfed.org.uk/a-s- history/unit-10-sweden-1889-1939http://tidning.kb.se/nld/ny/tidning_all.asp?tidnid=673 P. J. Welinder, who for a short time sat on the board of the IWW during his time as an immigrant to the US, was the ideological force in the union. Folke Fridell, the famous proletarian writer, was also a notable member. In 1928 SAF had around 1,000 members. By the mid-1930s, the number had grown to around 3,000. SAC took several initiatives towards a reunification with SAF. In 1938, SAF merged into SAC. ==References== Category:National trade union centers of Sweden Category:Trade unions established in 1928 Category:Trade unions disestablished in 1938 Category:1928 establishments in Sweden Category:Anarchist Federations Category:Anarchist organizations in Sweden Category:Defunct anarchist organizations in Europe ",
