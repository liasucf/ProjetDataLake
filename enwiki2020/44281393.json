The album was released by the Italian label Dodicilune in December 2012. ==Reception== All about jazz review awarded the album 5 stars writing that \"at just under 44 minutes, Blue from Heaven seems to pass by in an instant, but if there's truth in the adage \"leave them hungry for more,\" Balducci succeeds in spades. He may have done so with musicians possessing considerably greater cachet, but throughout Blue from Heaven, this evocative and provocative bassist/composer is never less than a full-on and absolute equal.\"Kelman, J ==Track listing== == Personnel == *Paul McCandless - soprano saxophone, oboe *John Taylor - piano *Pierluigi Balducci - electric bass *Michele Rabbia - drums, percussion == References == Category:2012 albums Category:Jazz albums by Italian artists ",
