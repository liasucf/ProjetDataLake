He came from a musical family on both sides: his father Valentin H\u00f6ller was the Bamberg Cathedral organist for 40 years, and his grandfather and great- grandfather were organists at W\u00fcrzburg Cathedral. His aunt Gretchen was the first female organist at W\u00fcrzburg.http://komponisten.suite101.de/article.cfm/karl_hoeller_komponist_mit_pfiff His mother was a singer, whose father had been a choir director and musician. He showed aptitude for the organ at an early age. He was a choirboy from age six, and he studied piano, organ and cello in Bamberg. He went to the W\u00fcrzburg Conservatory where he studied composition under Hermann Zilcher; and to the Munich Academy of Music, where he studied composition with Joseph Haas and Waltershausen, organ with Gatscher, and conducting with Siegfried von Hausegger. After taking his composition and organ examinations in 1929, he became a master-class student of Haas. He taught at the Munich Academy (1933\u201337), from 1937 in Frankfurt at the Hoch Conservatory and Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik (1938\u201346), and the Munich Conservatory (Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik) (1949\u201372; taking over the composition class of his teacher Joseph Haas). In 1942 H\u00f6ller joined the NSDAP.Ernst Klee: Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945. S. Fischer, Frankfurt am Main 2007, p. 255. He was also president of the Munich Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik from 1954 to 1972. H\u00f6ller became a member of the Academy of Arts, Berlin in 1952, and an honorary member of the Bavarian Academy of Fine Arts in 1958. His compositions are characterized by polyphony and colourful, impressionistic harmony and orchestration. They are redolent of Paul Hindemith, Hans Pfitzner, Max Reger and the French 20th century school. He wrote in a tonal idiom regardless of the prevailing fashions, which meant that he was initially criticised as modernist, and later as a reactionary. His music has been recorded by such artists as Eugen Jochum (Symphonic Fantasy and Sweelinck Variations), Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler (Cello Concerto No. 2, with the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra) and others. Karl H\u00f6ller died on 14 April 1987 in Hausham, Miesbach, Bavaria. ==Works== ===Orchestral=== * Concertino for violin, viola, piano and chamber orchestra, Op. 9 (1930) * Chamber concerto for violin and orchestra, Op. 10 (1930; revised as Violin Concerto, Op. 23, 1938; new version 1967) * Divertimento for Chamber Orchestra, Op. 11a (1939) * Concerto for Organ and Chamber Orchestra, Op. 15 (1930/32; revised 1966) * Toccata, Improvisations and Fugue (orchestration of Op. 16 for 2 pianos) (1942) * Hymn on Gregorian Chorales, Op. 18 (1932/34) * Chamber Concerto for Harpsichord and Small Orchestra or 6 solo instruments (Op. 19, 1933/34; revised 1958) * Symphonic Variations (or Symphonic Fantasy) on a Theme of Girolamo Frescobaldi, Op. 20 (1935, rev. 1956, 1965) * Passacaglia and Fugue on a Theme of Frescobaldi, Op. 25 (1938/39) * 2 cello concertos (No. 1, Op. 26, 1940/41; No. 2, Op. 50, 1949) * Heroische Musik, Op. 28 (1940) * 2 little symphonies, Opp. 32a (1965), 32b (1969) * Concerto grosso for 2 violins and orchestra, Op. 38a (1965; a re- working of the Trio Sonata for 2 violins and piano, Op. 38) * 2 symphonies (No. 1, Op. 40, 1942\u201346; No. 2, Op. 65, 1973, \"Homage to Mozart\") * Sonata for orchestra, Op. 44a (1966) * Serenade for chamber orchestra, Op. 46a (1957; rev. for large orchestra 1972) * Symphonic Concerto for violin and orchestra, Op. 47 (1947/48) * Fugue for string orchestra (1948; a reworking of the first movement of the String Quartet No. 5, Op. 48) * Divertimento for flute and strings, Op. 53a (? 1978) * Sweelinck Variations (\"Mein junges Lebe hat ein End\"), Op. 56 (1950/51) * Intrade, Allegro and Fugue, for timpani, percussion and strings, Op. 60 (1962) *\u201dBamberger\u201d Piano Concerto, Op. 63 (1972/73) * Transcription for orchestra of Franz Schubert's Five German Dances for piano * Transcription for orchestra of Max Reger\u2019s \"Praeludium und Fughetta\", Op. 80 (1974) ===Chamber=== * 8 violin sonatas (unnumbered, Op. 4, 1929, revised 1968; No. 1, Op. 30, 1942; No. 2 in G minor, Op. 33, 1943 \u2013 dedicated to the memory of Alma Moodie, who died in March 1943; No. 3, Op. 35 \"Fr\u00e4nkische\", 1944; No. 4, Op. 37, 1945; No. 5, Op. 39 \"Honegger Sonata\", 1946; No. 6, Op. 44, 1947; No. 7, Op. 52, 1949) * Chamber Trio for 2 violins and piano, Op. 6 (1930) * Piano Quartet (Op. 7, 1930; revised 1955) * Divertimento for flute, violin, viola, cello and piano, Op. 11 (1931) * 6 string quartets (No, 1, Op. 24, 1938, revised 1966; No. 2, Op. 36, 1945; No. 3, Op. 42, 1947 \u2013 see also Serenade for Wind Quintet, Op. 42a; No. 4 in C, Op. 43, 1947; No. 5, Op. 48, 1948; 1st movt.
