    "text": "The American Country Countdown Awards is an annual country music awards show that honors country artists based on their album sales, touring data and the amount of their radio airplay (with the exception of the Breakthrough Artist of the Year award which is fan-voted). It was created by Fox Network (in conjunction with Cumulus Media and Dick Clark Productions) and is a replacement for their American Country Awards show. It is named after the long running radio show American Country Countdown. == Hosts == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year(s) !
