    "text": "Andrew of London was a medieval Bishop of Winchester elect. He should not be mistaken for his namesake who participated in the Siege of Lisbon in 1147. Andrew was elected bishop in a disputed election held on 3 February 1261, when Andrew won a minority of the votes of the cathedral chapter, and William de Taunton won the majority. Andrew held the office of Prior of Winchester at the time of the disputed election.British History Online Bishops of Winchester accessed on 2 November 2007 He probably was forced into the office of prior by the previous bishop of Winchester, Aymer de Valence about 1255. He received a dispensation for his illegitimacy on 10 December 1258 from Pope Alexander IV and became a papal chaplain in 1259.British History Online Priors of Winchester accessed on 2 November 2007 The election to bishop of both men was quashed by the pope before 22 June 1262, and Andrew attempted to recover the office of prior, but was unsuccessful. He died sometime after 8 April 1278 when he was once more unsuccessful in regaining the priorate. ==Citations== ==References== * British History Online Bishops of Winchester accessed on 2 November 2007 * British History Online Priors of Winchester accessed on 2 November 2007 Category:Bishops of Winchester Category:13th-century English people Category:13th-century Roman Catholic bishops ",
