    "text": "Burkes Law is an American crime drama television series that aired on CBS during the 1993\u201394 and 1994\u201395 television seasons. It was a revival of the original Burkes Law television series, and starred Gene Barry as millionaire cop Amos Burke, now deputy chief instead of a captain, and Peter Barton as his son Det. Peter Burke. It was produced by Spelling Television. == Background == In the revival of the show, which ran on CBS from 1994 to 1995 and was produced by Aaron Spelling's production company, the title again became Burke's Law and Burke was back at work as a police detective. In the second incarnation, Burke, now a deputy chief, was assisted by his son, Peter (Peter Barton). The revival, even more than the original program, was regarded as being largely camp. In a nostalgic touch, many of the guest stars were Barry's peers in 1960s cop shows and spy-fi programs, including Patrick Macnee (The Avengers), Peter Graves (Mission: Impossible). Anne Francis appeared reprising the character Honey West (though she was called \"Honey Best\" for legal reasons). == Cast == * Gene Barry as Chief Amos Burke * Peter Barton as Det.
