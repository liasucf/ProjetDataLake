    "text": "\"Moses\" is a song by British rock band Coldplay. It was written by all members of the band for their live album, Coldplay Live 2003. The song was released on 6 October 2003 as the only single from the album. ==Background== The song was written about lead singer Chris Martin's then wife, Gwyneth Paltrow. Martin has said that the song is \"about falling in love with the most beautiful woman in the world.\" The song's title later served as the namesake for the couple\u2019s second child, Moses Bruce Anthony Martin. It was written in mid-2002 after the sessions for A Rush of Blood to the Head (which was released near the end of August 2002) and was intended for the follow-up album X&Y;, but failed to make the album. So far only a live version of this song has been released. ==Personnel== * Chris Martin - vocals, rhythm guitar * Jonny Buckland - lead guitar * Guy Berryman - bass guitar * Will Champion - drums ==Track listing== ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"| Chart (2003) !scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |- |} ==Release history== {|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Country !scope=\"col\"|Date !scope=\"col\"|Format !scope=\"col\"|Label |- !scope=\"row\"| United States | 6 October 2003 | Modern rock radio | Parlophone |} ==References== Category:2003 singles Category:2003 songs Category:Coldplay songs Category:Parlophone singles Category:Song recordings produced by Ken Nelson (British record producer) Category:Songs written by Guy Berryman Category:Songs written by Jonny Buckland Category:Songs written by Will Champion Category:Songs written by Chris Martin Category:Live singles ",
