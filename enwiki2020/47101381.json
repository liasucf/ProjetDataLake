In the 1960s and 1970s Arion was seen as one of the most adventurous and innovative independent labels in France with an eclectic catalogue ranging from classical music to ethnic music to jazz. Its strengths were, and remain, rarely performed classical works and ethnic music.Way, Michael (3 July 1971). \"A Review of French Disk Scene\", p. 48.

Retrieved 28 June 2015 (subscription required for complete article) . ==History== In 1962 Ariane Segal, who had been working as a producer for the French division of Ricordi, left the firm with her entire team, including her sound engineer Claude Morel. She established a new independent label, Arion, serving as its president and managing director, while Morel served as the label's artistic director. By 1967 when Arion signed a US distribution deal with CBS, its recordings had already received prizes from the Acad\u00e9mie Charles Cros and the Acad\u00e9mie du disque fran\u00e7ais.Adamis, Eddie (10 March 1962). \"Twist to last out the year\", p. 22. BillboardBillboard (18 November 1967), \"CBS and Arion Distrib Pact\", p. 56 While most single LPs produced in France during the 1960s and 70s were packaged in sleeves, Arion's records were presented in books with copious liner notes, most of which were written by Segal herself. With the arrival of the compact disc, Arion, with its large catalogue of vinyl records, lacked the financial resources to convert to the new medium. Rather than selling the company to one of her rivals, Segal sold it to the Italian firm Ducale, who had distributed the Arion label in Italy and had begun buying stock in Arion in 1984. Ducale's owner, David Matalon, took over as president of Arion in 1985. His daughter Manuela Matalon Ostrolenk became the managing director, while Segal stayed on as head of A&R; for the label's classical division. Shortly after Matalon's takeover, Arion announced plans for its first four releases on compact disc. These included Les flutes de terres Incas performed by the Andean music ensemble and Guillaume Bouzignac's Motets et sc\u00e8nes sacr\u00e9es.Billboard (3 August 1985). \"Ducale Takes Over Arion\", p. 71Riesel, Yves (6 April 2011). \"Ariane Segal est morte\". Qobuz Magazine. Retrieved 28 June 2015 . In the ensuing years Arion gradually re-released the recordings in its vinyl catalogue on CD as well as continuing to produce new CD recordings and in 1997 acquired the Pierre Verany label. As of 2015 Manuela Ostrolenk serves as both president and CEO of Arion. Ariane Segal, who was described by one of her colleagues at Ricordi as \"a remarkable woman, way ahead of her time\", died in 2011 at the age of 93.Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France.

Fernand Lanore. ==Repertoire== Although from its inception Arion produced recordings in a range of genres, including jazz, dance, and film soundtracks, its core repertoire has been classical and ethnic music from around the world, including the traditional folk music of France. Between 1974 and 1984, Arion produced over 30 LP recordings of ethnic music for the French organization , many of which have subsequently been re-released on CD by the organization's own label.Gr\u00fcnd, Fran\u00e7oise and Ch\u00e9rif Khaznadar, Ch\u00e9rif (1996).

In the classical repertoire, Arion was known for championing composers who had fallen into obscurity such as Hyacinthe Jadin and contemporary composers such as Maurice Ohana as well as the forgotten works of established composers. An example of the latter was their 1993 recording of Daniel Auber's opera Gustave III, ou Le bal masqu\u00e9, composed thirty-five years prior to Verdi's more famous setting, Un ballo in maschera. Under Ariane Segal, Arion also recorded 40 LPs of music by women composers, including that of the medieval troubador Beatritz de Dia.Bessi\u00e8res, Yves and Niedzwiecki, Patricia (October 1985).

Amongst the label's larger-scale classical music projects were Bach's complete Well- Tempered Clavier recorded between 1972 and 1975 by organist Louis Thiry (ARN 468306) and the complete piano works of Emmanuel Chabrier recorded by Alexandre Tharaud in 1998 (ARN 368722). ==References== ==External links== *Arion (\u00c9diteur phonographique) on WorldCat Category:Classical music record labels Category:World music record labels Category:French independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1962 Category:1962 establishments in France ",
