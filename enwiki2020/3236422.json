    "text": "Aarhus Theatre The Aarhus Theatre (Danish: Aarhus Teater) in Aarhus, is the largest provincial theatre in Denmark. The present theatre house was constructed in the late 19th century, as a replacement for the old theatre, nicknamed \"Svedekassen\" (The Sweat-box). Since Aarhus had grown to become Jutland's biggest city during the 19th century, the old theatre had become too small to serve the public demand. A new building was designed by the Danish architect Hack Kampmann (1856\u20131920), and the construction began on 12 August 1898. Only two years later, Aarhus Theatre stood completed and was inaugurated on 15 September 1900. The architectural style of the building is Art Nouveau, with the national romantic emphasis on natural materials, and the interior design was completed by artists Hansen Reistrup and Hans Tegner. In 2007, the Aarhus Theatre received an audio make-over. ==Aarhus Theatre School== The Aarhus Theater offers two 4-year programs for students to train in acting or play writing. ==References== ==External links== *Official Homepage of Aarhus Theatre (in Danish) Category:Theatres completed in 1900 Category:Hack Kampmann buildings Category:Listed theatres in Denmark Category:Theatres in Aarhus Category:Listed buildings in Aarhus Category:Tourist attractions in Aarhus Category:Art Nouveau architecture in Aarhus Category:Art Nouveau theatres Category:Caf\u00e9s in Aarhus ",
