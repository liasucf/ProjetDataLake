Danyew worked with Pete Kipley, in the production of this album. ==Critical reception== Awarding the EP three and a half stars for AllMusic, Jared Johnson writes, \"There are no gimmicks on this record, only the solid craftsmanship of a talented artist.\" Mike Rimmer, rating the album a nine out of ten at Cross Rhythms, says, \"The [multi]-instrumentalist and singer seems content to use the studio as a laboratory to distil his music into something that is lyrically, musically and emotionally powerful.\" Giving the album four stars from Jesus Freak Hideout, Jen Rose states, \"Every song presents a unique facet to his different styles, every part fitting together into a seamless whole.\" ==Track listing== ==References== Category:2009 EPs Category:Sparrow Records EPs ",
