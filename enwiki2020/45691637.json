    "text": "The Hatchard Football League was an English association football league based in Sheffield, South Yorkshire. ==History== Founded in 1892, it was originally called the Sheffield & District Alliance, only changing name to the Hatchard Cup League halfway through the 1893/94 season when a local politician called Frank Hatchard donated a trophy to the Sheffield & Hallamshire FA. For many years there were numerous divisions, with the top sides from each section proceeding to end of season play-offs that would determine the overall winner. The league was suspended for the duration of the First World War, then disbanded altogether in 1923, but was re-introduced after the Second World War. In 1983 the league merged with the Sheffield Association League to form the Sheffield & Hallamshire County Senior League, which (as of 2015) forms a part of the English football league system.http://www.sheffieldfa.com/news/2013/apr/county-senior-league-collect- top-award ==Champions== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font- size:85%\" |- !width=50|Season !width=350| |- | 1892\u201393 | Elsecar |- | 1893\u201394 | Kiveton Park |- | 1894\u201395 | Heeley |- | 1895\u201396 | Kiveton Park |- | 1896\u201397 | Kimberworth |- | 1897\u201398 | Montrose Works |- | 1898\u201399 | Doncaster Rovers reserves & Treeton (shared) |- | 1899\u201300 | Roundel |- | 1900\u201301 | Doncaster Rovers reserves |- | 1901\u201302 | Roundel reserves |- | 1902\u201303 | Hallam |- | 1903\u201304 | Rotherham Main |- | 1904\u201305 | Doncaster St James |- | 1905\u201306 | Parkgate Athletic |- | 1906\u201307 | Worksop Town reserves |- | 1907\u201308 | Thorpe Hesley |- | 1908\u201309 | Thorpe Hesley |- | 1909\u201310 | Dinnington Main |- | 1910\u201311 | Dinnington Main |- | 1911\u201312 | Cammells Sports |- | 1912\u201313 | Retford Town |- | 1913\u201314 | Bird In Hand |- | 1914\u201315 | Bird In Hand |- | 1919\u201320 | Treeton Reading Room & Beighton Recreation (shared) |- | 1920\u201321 | Beighton Recreation |- |1921\u201322 | Treeton Reading Room |- |1922\u201323 | Treeton Reading Room |- |1948\u201349 | Hallam |- |1949\u201350 | Thorncliffe Recreation |- |1950\u201351 | Penistone Church |- |1951\u201352 | Thorncliffe Recreation |- |1952\u201353 | Thorncliffe Recreation reserves |- |1953\u201354 | Wickersley Institute |- |1954\u201355 | Atlas & Norfolk Works |- |1955\u201356 | Atlas & Norfolk Works |- |1956\u201357 | English Steel Corporation |- |1957\u201358 | Dearne Community & Miners Welfare |- |1958\u201359 | Dearne Community & Miners Welfare |- |1959\u201360 | YMCA |- |1960\u201361 | Penistone Church |- |1961\u201362 | YMCA |- |1962\u201363 |Sheffield United 'A' |- |1963\u201364 | Davy United |- |1964\u201365 | Sheffield United 'A' |- |1965\u201366 | Frecheville Community |- |1966\u201367 | Sheffield Waterworks |- |1967\u201368 | Sheffield United 'A' |- |1968\u201369 | City Surveyors |- |1969\u201370 | Worsbrough Bridge Miners Welfare reserves |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; font-size:85%\" |- !width=50|Season !width=350|Division 1 !width=350|Division 2 |- |1970\u201371 | Charlton United | East Dene |- |1971\u201372 | BSC Parkgate | Old Edwardians |- |1972\u201373 | Old Edwardians | Ecclesfield Red Rose |- |1973\u201374 | Old Edwardians | Firth Brown |- |1974\u201375 | Ecclesfield Red Rose | Sheffield Waterworks |- |1975\u201376 | Sheffield Waterworks reserves | TWIL |- |1976\u201377 | Old Edwardians | Woodhouse Ashberry |- |1977\u201378 | Woodhouse Ashberry | Crosspool Sports |- |1978\u201379 | Ecclesfield ES | Windsor |- |1979\u201380 | Oughtibridge War Memorial | Middlewood Hospital |- |1980\u201381 | Stannington Village | Dormer Sports |- |1981\u201382 | Windsor | James Fairley Steels |- |1982\u201383 | Crookes Working Mens Club | Woodsetts Welfare |} http://www.nonleaguematters.co.uk/nonleaguetables/lt1981-1982.html#SH1 ==References== Category:Sports leagues established in 1894 Category:Football in South Yorkshire Category:Defunct football leagues in England Category:Defunct football competitions in South Yorkshire ",
