This is a neuromuscular stimulator developed by an American scientist, Jozef Cywinski. Veinoplus == History == * 2004: Veinoplus design * 2005: Princeps study (first published clinical study) * 2011: Distributed in 25 countries. == Description == Veinoplus is composed of a pocket-size device linked to two electrodes. The device has three buttons: a central one to turn on and off the device and two buttons marked \u201c+\u201d and \u201c-\u201d to adjust the intensity of stimulation. The electrodes have to be placed on the calf: either both electrodes on one calf if the venous disease affects only one leg, or one electrode on each calf if the pathology concerns both legs. == Veinoplus technology == Veinoplus technology is based on the principle of electrostimulation. Thanks to a 9V battery, the device delivers electrical impulses with low frequency and low voltage. Input power is below 0.3W and output power is under 0.05W. The difference between Veinoplus and others electrical muscle stimulators is due to the waveform of the impulses. With this unique waveform, the electrical field can deeply get through the calf and so stimulate an important volume of tissue. As a consequence, Veinoplus triggers deep muscular contractions even if both electrodes are over one meter apart, for instance with one electrode on each calf.Marquage CE 0535. Veinoplus produces safe and painless electrical impulses. Actually, the signal\u2019s intensity is below limits authorized by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation and American National Standards Institute (AAMI / ANSI ; NS-4; 1986/2002). Moreover, the device doesn\u2019t generate excessive electromagnetic interference.International Standard IEC 60601-2-10 Medical electrical equipment. Particular requirements for the safety of nerve and muscle stimulators Thus it can be used in a plane, except during take-off and landing. Finally, a study on pregnant womenA. Le Tohic, H. Bastian, M. Pujo, P. Beslot, R. Mollard, P. Madelenat.

The pulsating calf contractions compress deep veins and pump the venous blood against gravity towards the heart. We can highlight 3 principal hemodynamic effects:Dr F. Zuccarelli, Dr J. Launay, Dr J.
