    "text": "The Arcs of Descent and Ascent (), an ontological circle, are described in Neoplatonism, as well as in Islamic and Sufi cosmology, mainly inspired by the works of Ibn al-Arabi. In the Arc of Descent (\"qaws al-nuzuli\"), from unity to diversity, God creates successively the Intellect (Supreme Pen), the Universal Soul (Guarded Tablet), Prime Matter, Nature, the Universal Body (including the imaginal world) and the Earth. The Arc of Ascent (\"qaws al-su'ud\") is the way back to the Presence of God, the process of spiritual perfection. In a hadith attributed to Ja'far al-Sadiq, the sixth Imam of Shi'i Islam, the arc of descent is described as having seven stages. These stages have been commented on in Shaykhism. ==In B\u00e1bism and the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith== In the B\u00e1b\u00ed and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faiths the seven stages of the Arc of Descent are described as follows: Will (Mashiyyat), Determination (Iradih), Destiny (Qadar), Decree (Qada), Permission (Idhn), Term (Ajal), and Book (Kitab). In Some Answered Questions 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 states that \"man is in the ultimate degree of materiality and the beginning of spirituality; that is, he is at the end of imperfection and the beginning of perfection. He is at the furthermost degree of darkness and the beginning of the light. That is why the station of man is said to be the end of night and the beginning of day.\" The B\u00e1b explained that the obligatory prayer symbolizes a spiritual journey from the realm of the body to the realm of the heart, which can be described as an arc of ascent, mirroring the arc of descent from God to creation. The Seven Valleys of Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h is another example of the arc of ascent. It describes the valley of search, the valley of love, the valley of knowledge, the valley of unity, the valley of contentment, the valley of wonderment, and the valley of true poverty and absolute nothingness.Achieving Coherence: The Ontological Circle 'Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1 describes the following: The depraved soul, the self-accusing soul, the inspired soul, the assured soul, the contented soul, the accepted soul, the perfect soul, the soul of the Kingdom of God (malak\u00fat), the soul of the Dominion (jabar\u00fat) and the Divine Soul (lah\u00fat).Mak\u00e1t\u00edb-i-\u2018Abdu\u2019l-Bah\u00e1, vol. 1, pp.65-98 (62-102), provisional paraphrase and discussion in Savi, 2008, Chapter 9: \u1e62\u00faf\u00ed Concepts and Ciphers Revised by Bah\u00e1\u2019u\u2019ll\u00e1h: Man. ==References== Category:Islamic cosmology Category:Sufi philosophy Category:Neoplatonism Category:Bah\u00e1'\u00ed terminology ",
