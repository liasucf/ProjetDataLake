    "text": "' or Ashvaghosha' (; ) was a Sarv\u0101stiv\u0101da Buddhist philosopher, dramatist, poet and orator from India. He was born in Saketa in northern India. He is believed to have been the first Sanskrit dramatist, and is considered the greatest Indian poet prior to K\u0101lid\u0101sa. He was the most famous in a group of Buddhist court writers, whose epics rivalled the contemporary Ramayana.Randall Collins, The Sociology of Philosophies: A Global Theory of Intellectual Change. Harvard University Press, 2000, page 220. Whereas much of Buddhist literature prior to the time of A\u015bvagho\u1e63a had been composed in P\u0101li and Prakrit, A\u015bvagho\u1e63a wrote in Classical Sanskrit. ==Life as an ascetic== According to the traditional biography of A\u015bvagho\u1e63a,Li Rongxi (2002). The Life of Asvaghosa Bodhisattva; in: The Lives of Great Monks and Nuns, Berkeley CA: Numata Center for Translation and Research, pp. 9\u201316Stuart H. Young (trans.), Biography of the Bodhisattva A\u015bvagho\u1e63a, Maming pusa zhuan \u99ac\u9cf4\u83e9\u85a9\u50b3, T.50.2046.183a, translated by Tripi\u1e6daka Master Kum\u0101raj\u012bva. which was translated into Chinese by Kum\u0101raj\u012bva, and preserved in that language, he was originally a wandering ascetic who was able to defeat all-comers in debate. He set a challenge to the Buddhist monks that if none could meet with him in debate then they should stop beating the wood-block which signalled to the people to bring offerings to them. There was no one there to meet the challenge so they stopped beating the wood-block. However, in the north there was an elder bhik\u1e63u named P\u0101r\u015bva at the time, who saw that if he could convert this ascetic, it would be a great asset to the propagation of the Dharma, so he travelled from northern India and had the wood-block sounded. The ascetic came to ask why it had been sounded. Though thinking the old monk would be unable to debate with him, he accepted the challenge. After seven days, the debate was held in front of the King, his Ministers, and many ascetics and brahmans. The loser agreed to become the disciple of the other. They agreed that the elder P\u0101r\u015bva should speak first, and he said: \"The world should be made peaceable, with a long-lived king, plentiful harvests, and joy throughout the land, with none of the myriad calamities\", to which the ascetic had no response and so was bound to become P\u0101r\u015bva's disciple, and he was given full ordination as a bhik\u1e63u. Although he had to consent to this, he still was not convinced of the elder's virtues until he showed him he had mastered the Bases of Spiritual Power (r\u0325ddhip\u0101d\u0101\u1e25), at which point he gained faith. P\u0101r\u015bva then taught him the 5 Faculties, the 5 Powers, the 7 Factors and the 8-fold Noble Path, and he eventually mastered the teaching. Later, the central kingdom was besieged by the Ku\u1e63\u0101na King's army, who demanded 300,000 gold pieces in tribute. The King could not pay so much, as he had only 100,000. The Ku\u1e63\u0101na King therefore asked for the Buddha's begging bowl, the converted monk, and the 100,000 gold pieces for his tribute. Although the King of the central kingdom was unhappy, the monk persuaded him it would be for the good of the propagation of the Dharma which would spread across the four continents if he went with the Ku\u1e63\u0101na King. He was therefore taken away. thumb The Ku\u1e63\u0101na's King's Ministers, however, were unhappy, not thinking that the bhik\u1e63u was priced correctly at 100,000 gold pieces. The King, who knew the worth of bhiksu, ordered that seven horses be starved for six days. The King then made an assembly and had the bhik\u1e63u preach the Dharma. Even the horses, whose favourite food was placed in front of them, were entranced by the Teaching of the monk, and listened intently. Everybody was thereby convinced of his worth. He was then granted the name A\u015bvagho\u1e63a, Horse-Cry. He travelled throughout northern India proclaiming the Dharma and guiding all through his wisdom and understanding, and he was held in great regard by the four-fold assembly, who knew him as The Sun of Merit and Virtue. ==Written works== He was previously believed to have been the author of the influential Buddhist text Awakening of Mahayana Faith, but modern scholars agree that the text was composed in China.Nattier, Jan.

University of Hawaii Press, 1997, page 33. and seems to have been ordained into a subsect of the Mahasanghikas.Alexander Wynne, The Origin of Buddhist Meditation. Routledge, 2007, page 26. Some recent research into his kavya poems have revealed that he may have used the Yogacarabhumi as a textual reference, particularly for the Saundarananda, which opens up the possibility he was affiliated with either the Yogacara or the Sautrantika school.Yamabe, Nobuyoshi.

PDF He wrote an epic life of the Buddha called BuddhacharitaE. B.

The monk I-tsing (Yijing) mentioned that in his time Buddhacarita was \"...extensively read in all the five parts of India and in the countries of the South Sea (Sum\u0101tra, J\u0101va and the neighbouring islands). He clothed manifold notions and ideas in a few words which so delighted the heart of his reader that he never wearied of perusing the poem. Moreover, it was regarded as a virtue to read it in as much as it contained the noble doctrine in a neat compact form.\"J.K. Nariman: Literary History of Sanskrit Buddhism, Bombay 1919. A\u015bvagho\u1e63a and his School It described in 28 chapters the whole Life of the Buddha from his birth until his entry into Parinirv\u0101na. During the Muslim invasions of the 10th \u2013 12th centuries, half of the original Sanskrit text was lost. Today, the second half only exists in Chinese and Tibetan translations. He also wrote Saundarananda, a k\u0101vya poem with the theme of conversion of Nanda, Buddha's half-brother, so that he might reach salvation. The first half of the work describes Nanda's life, and the second half of the work describes Buddhist doctrines and ascetic practices.Yoshichika Honda.

(Japanese) He is also thought to be the author of the Sutralankara. ==See also== *Sanskrit drama *Sanskrit literature ==References== ==Bibliography== * ==External links== * * Category:80s births Category:150s deaths Category:1st-century Buddhist monks Category:2nd-century Buddhist monks Category:Indian male poets Category:Ancient Indian dramatists and playwrights Category:Indian Buddhist scholars Category:Converts to Buddhism from Hinduism Category:Zen Patriarchs Category:1st-century Indian poets Category:2nd-century Indian poets Category:Indian male dramatists and playwrights Category:Sanskrit writers ",
