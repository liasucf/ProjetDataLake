It was the Hungarian People's Army's 7015th Ceremonial Regiment (Hungarian: Magyar N\u00e9phadsereg 7015 D\u00edsz -\u00e9s \u0151rezred), being at the time the official honor guard and escort of the leadership of the Hungarian People's Republic. The regiment took the name of the 32nd Budapest Guard Regiment on 15 May 1991 by order of Hungarian Minister of Defence Lajos F\u00fcr. On 1 October 2000, the regiment was named the 32nd Budapest Guard and Ornament. As of 1 January 2002, as part of the force reform, the organizational structure of the regiment changed. A support battalion was formed from the two independent centuries and divisions from the logistics headquarters. On New Year's Day in 2003, Colonel L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Talpas became the first and last commander of the regiment, having previously completed the Military Observer Training Course in 1998 and serving in the United Nations International Mission in Western Sahara in 2000. It operated until 31 December 2006, at which time it was disbanded to be replaced by the Ceremonial Battalion branch (part of the MH \"T\u00e1mogat\u00f3 Dand\u00e1r\" HDF Support Brigade) on 1 January 2007. In the course of this, members of the regiment took part in many HDF operations and assignments overseas. It was converted on 1 January 2011 to Nemzeti Honv\u00e9d D\u00edszegys\u00e9g (National Home Defense Ceremonial Regiment) as part of the MH TD and achieved service on 25 April. The decision to re-establish the Holy Crown Guard was made on 20 December 2010 (based on the 1928 Act) with support from the Hungarian Crown Guard Association. On 30 May 2011, due to the resurgence of traditions, the Holy Crown Guard was reestablished and took over the right to protect the Holy Crown again after 66 years (it was last performed in 1944 by members of the Hungarian Royal Crown Guard).Korona\u0151r\u00f6k sz\u00e9p \u00fcnnepe ==Regimental customs and tradition== ===Dress uniform=== Modern Hungarian army ski cap In 1949, a new uniform was introduced, which was similar to the Soviet pattern and molded to honor Hungarian traditions. In 1960, a cotton uniform was introduced. In 1990, a new tunic and other garments were introduced to the tradition that existed in the Horthy era, but was later modified to avoid fascist comparisons. For a time, a green field uniform was used in the unit until a brown full dress uniform was introduced in the early 2000s.https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/europe/hu-uniforms.htm During the changing of the guard, members of the guard wear sunglasses while the ceremony is occurring as well as on guard duty. Since 1990, the guard has worn a native Ski cap known as a Bocskai. Prior to the introduction of this, the unit used a Peaked cap similar to the Soviet model beginning in 1958 with the communist emblem on top. It is named after the Crown of Stephen Bocskai, given to the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire to Prince Stephen Bocskai of Transylvania in the 17th century. ===Musical support=== Being the representative musical ensemble of the HDF, the Hungarian Defense Forces Central Military Band support the regiment musically during protocol events. Being part of the same garrison brigade gives the regiment and the band direct access to each other. Today, the Central Band maintains a fanfare unit as well as a drum corps. The band wears the same uniform as the regiment.http://bhd.honvedseg.hu/rovat/kozponti_zenekar ===Regimental memorial=== The 32nd Infantry Regiment Memorial (32. Gyalogs\u00e1gi ezred Eml\u00e9km\u0171) is located on Baross Street in the J\u00f3zsefv\u00e1ros District of Budapest. The memorial honors the ethnically Hungarian 32nd Infantry Regiment of the Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d of the Austro-Hungarian Army based in D\u00e9s (now Dej, Romania). The memorial was chosen due to the mere fact that bot units bear the same unit number, 32. It was erected in 1933 after a public donation by Istv\u00e1n Szentgy\u00f6rgyi to honor the members of the regiment who served in the First World War.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMA0G7_Monument_of_the_32nd_Mria_Terzia_Home_Regiment_BudapestBudapesti utcanevek A - Z. 274. old.

A modified goose step is performed by the rest of the unit, with the foot raised only a few inches off the ground. In quick time, the unit marches in a similar fashion to the United States Army and the British Army.
