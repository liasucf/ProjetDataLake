The missing parts and figures of the gods and giants depicted in the original 113 m (370 feet) Gigantomachy frieze were added by Andrey Alexander in the form of photos and drawings he had made of present-day athletes, actors, and of fragments of ancient sculptures. In a five-year process, these photographs were then edited with respect to color, surface structure, and elaboration of the details and inserted into the gaps of the remaining marble fragments. The result is a fictional, artistically inspired reconstruction of the original. Leading European archeologists and scientists were consulted for advice on the project.Scientific advisors and partners == Exhibitions == 3-D reconstruction of the quadriga.
