    "text": "Boxing in the 1940s in many ways reflected worldwide events that affected other endeavors as well. World War II raged early in the decade, and just like baseballers, many popular boxers went overseas to fight for their countries, Joe Louis, Billy Conn, Beau Jack, and Bob Montgomery among them. Louis was used to entice Americans to join the war against Germany, a couple of propaganda movies starring Louis and many propaganda posters being produced. The posters in particular are collectors' items today. Louis' great rival, Max Schmeling, a lifelong opponent of the Nazi regime, was forced by Adolf Hitler to join the German military after his loss to Louis at their 1938 rematch. Because of the war many world championship divisions were frozen. Sometimes, a title bout was held five years after the last title bout in that division had been held. Television was in its infancy in the 1940s, but nonetheless, viewers were treated to many 10-round, non-title fights, and many crown challengers became household names under the absence of so many world champions. The 1940s did have some historic world title fights and rivalries. Sugar Ray Robinson and Jake LaMotta began their series of famous bouts towards the middle of the decade, Jack and Montgomery fought four times, and Rocky Graziano and Tony Zale starred in what boxing critics have often called one of the fiercest rivalries in boxing history. The heavyweight division was dominated by Louis, the only man in history to be world champion throughout every year of a decade. He became world champion in 1937 and kept the title until 1949. LaMotta lost a highly controversial fight to Billy Fox in 1947. LaMotta later testified he threw the fight to earn a title shot at world middleweight champion Marcel Cerdan, ==1941== *January 13 \u2013 Anton Christoforidis becomes the first Greek world boxing champion in history, beating Melio Bettina by a fifteen-round decision for the National Boxing Association's vacant world Light-Heavyweight title, in Cleveland. *January 17 \u2013 Fritzie Zivic retains his world Welterweight title with a twelfth-round knockout of Henry Armstrong at their New York City rematch. *May 22 \u2013 Gus Lesvenich wins the world Light-Heavyweight title, with a fifteen-round decision over Anton Christoforidis, at New York. *May 23 \u2013 In an extremely controversial bout, Joe Louis retains his world Heavyweight title with a seventh round disqualification win over Max Baer's brother, Buddy Baer.
