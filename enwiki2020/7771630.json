    "text": "\"Tears on My Pillow\" was a popular song for Johnny Nash. Written by Ernie Smith and produced by Ken Khouri and Johnny Nash, \"Tears on My Pillow\" was the sole number-one single in the UK Singles Chart for Nash, spending a single week at the top of the chart in July 1975. New Zealand act The Parker Project, covered this song in 1991, reaching No. 1 on the New Zealand chart in June of that year. The Johnny Nash version, sung in a Reggae style, featured a spoken recitation in the middle of the song. This song is not to be confused with the Little Anthony and the Imperials hit song from 1958. The Nash version, like the Imperials song, mentions the lines: \"Tears on my Pillow/ Pain in my Heart\". ==Charts== ===Year-end charts=== The Parker Project version {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Chart (1991) !Position |- |align=\"left\"|New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ) |align=\"center\"|22 |} ==References== Category:1975 singles Category:UK Singles Chart number-one singles Category:Irish Singles Chart number-one singles Category:1975 songs Category:Number-one singles in New Zealand ",
