    "text": "David \"Davy\" Lyner (9 January 1893 \u2013 5 December 1973) was a Northern Irish footballer who played as an outside forward for various clubs in Northern Ireland, England and Scotland in the 1910s and 1920s, including Distillery, Glentoran, Manchester United and Kilmarnock. ==Career== ===Club career=== Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Lyner began his career with Belfast club Owen O'Cork before moving across town to play for Distillery. Then, at the age of 19, he moved to another Belfast club, Glentoran, where he spent a full ten seasons, playing in 288 league matches and scoring 53 goals. Although he was now 29 years old, Lyner had obviously impressed enough to warrant a transfer to England's Manchester United, who had just been relegated to the Second Division. Signed in August 1922, Lyner made his debut for United on 23 September 1922, playing in a 2\u20130 away defeat to Coventry City. He also played in the club's next two games, a 2\u20131 home win over Coventry City on 30 September and a 2\u20131 home defeat to Port Vale on 7 October, but, having failed to make a decent impression, these were to be his only appearances for Manchester United, and he was transferred to Kilmarnock in December 1922. The 1924\u201325 season was quite eventful for Lyner. After starting the season at Kilmarnock, he moved back to Northern Ireland to play for Queen's Island. He then moved to Dundela, another Belfast side, before joining Scotland's Clydebank for the end of the season, taking his total of clubs for the 1924\u201325 season to four. He then spent a brief stint with Wales' Mid Rhondda in the 1925\u201326 season, before joining New Brighton for the 1926\u201327 season. The 1927\u201328 season saw Lyner return to Northern Ireland for the last time, joining Glentoran, before he spent his final season with Queen's Island. He retired from football at the end of the 1928\u201329 season, at the age of 36. ===International career=== Lyner's international career began in 1919, when he was selected for Ireland's first two matches of the 1920 British Home Championship, against England on 25 October 1919, and against Wales on 14 February 1920. The matches finished at 1\u20131 and 2\u20132 respectively. He then played in the matches against Scotland and Wales in the 1922 British Home Championship, losing 2\u20131 to Scotland and drawing 1\u20131 with Wales. Lyner's involvement in the 1923 British Home Championship spanned his time with two different clubs: when he played in Ireland's 2\u20130 away defeat to England, he was a Manchester United player, but by the time of his only win with the Irish team, a 3\u20130 away win over Wales, he had signed for Kilmarnock. ==Honours== ;Glentoran *Irish Football League (2): 1912\u201313, 1920\u201321 *Irish Cup (2): 1913\u201314, 1916\u201317 ==External links== *Profile at StretfordEnd.co.uk *Profile at MUFCInfo.com *Profile at Northern Ireland's Footballing Greats Category:1893 births Category:1973 deaths Category:Sportspeople from Belfast Category:Irish association footballers (before 1923) Category:Pre-1950 IFA international footballers Category:Lisburn Distillery F.C. players Category:Glentoran F.C. players Category:Manchester United F.C. players Category:Kilmarnock F.C. players Category:Clydebank F.C.
