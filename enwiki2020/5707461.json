    "text": "Hyrachyus (from Hyrax and \"pig\") is an extinct genus of perissodactyl mammal that lived in Eocene Europe, North America, and Asia. Its remains have also been found in Jamaica. It is closely related to Lophiodon.Hayden, F.V. Report of the United States Geological Survey of the Territories, Volume III. (1883) ==Description== The 1.5-m-long beast was related to palaeotheres, and suspected to be the ancestor of modern tapirs and rhinoceroses. Physically, it would have looked very similar to modern tapirs, although it probably lacked the tapir's characteristic proboscis. Its teeth, however, resembled those of a rhinoceros, supporting the idea of its relationship with that group. ==References== Category:Eocene odd-toed ungulates Category:Transitional fossils Category:Paleogene mammals of Asia Category:Paleogene mammals of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 1871 ",
