    "text": "The Reiseb\u00fcro der DDR (\"Travel Bureau of the GDR\") was the state travel organization of the German Democratic Republic (East Germany). The Reiseb\u00fcro had several travel-related functions, including: # Arranging domestic travel for GDR citizens. The Reiseb\u00fcro (Travel Agency), among other things, controlled hotels located throughout the GDR. # Arranging travel for GDR citizens in other socialist countries, i.e., the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Cuba. # Arranging travel for foreigners visiting the GDR. These services included booking hotel rooms and providing confirmation documents used to justify the issuance of a GDR visa upon arrival in the GDR. The Reiseb\u00fcro had agreements with travel agencies in other countries; travelers would book trips with a participating travel agency in their home country, which would then coordinate with the Reiseb\u00fcro to reserve hotel rooms, etc. ==See also== *Intourist *Tourism in East Germany Category:Government organisations in East Germany ",
