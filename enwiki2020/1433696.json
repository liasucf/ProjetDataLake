    "text": "Grey Turner's sign refers to bruising of the flanks, the part of the body between the last rib and the top of the hip. The bruising appears as a blue discoloration, and is a sign of retroperitoneal hemorrhage, or bleeding behind the peritoneum, which is a lining of the abdominal cavity. Grey Turner's sign takes 24\u201348 hours to develop, and can predict a severe attack of acute pancreatitis. Grey Turner's sign may be accompanied by Cullen's sign. Both signs may be indicative of pancreatic necrosis with retroperitoneal or intra- abdominal bleeding. Grey Turner's sign is named after British surgeon George Grey Turner. ==Causes== Causes include * Acute pancreatitis, whereby methemalbumin formed from digested blood tracks subcutaneously around the abdomen from the inflamed pancreas. * Pancreatic hemorrhage * Retroperitoneal hemorrhage * Blunt abdominal trauma * Ruptured / hemorrhagic ectopic pregnancy. * Spontaneous bleeding secondary to coagulopathy (congenital or acquired) * Aortic rupture, from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm or other causes. ==History== It is named after British surgeon George Grey Turner. ==References== == External links == Category:Medical signs ",
