    "text": "The middle finger, long finger, or tall finger is the third digit of the human hand, located between the index finger and the ring finger. It is typically the longest finger. In anatomy, it is also called the third finger, digitus medius, digitus tertius or digitus III. In Western countries, extending the middle finger (either by itself, or along with the index finger in the United Kingdom: see V sign) is an offensive and obscene gesture, widely recognized as a form of insult (colloquially known as \"flipping the bird\", \"flipping someone off\", or simply \"giving the finger\"). The middle finger is often used for finger snapping together with the thumb. ==References== Category:Fingers Category:Hand gestures ",
