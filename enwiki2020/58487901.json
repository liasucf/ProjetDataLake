    "text": "Leonda was a community, now extinct, in Pipe Creek Township, Miami County, in the U.S. state of Indiana. ==History== Leonda was laid out in 1851 by Jacob Pottarff and Harvey Hoover. In its heyday, the town had a post office, a general store, and a hotel. When the Pan Handle Railroad was built in Miami County, it was not extended to Leonda, being built through nearby Bunker Hill instead. This led to Leonda becoming a ghost town. A post office was established at Leonda in 1852, and remained in operation until it was discontinued in 1860. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Geography of Miami County, Indiana Category:Former populated places in Indiana Category:Ghost towns in Indiana ",
