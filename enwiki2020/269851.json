She was the mother of Peter II, the last Yugoslav monarch. Her citizenship was revoked and her property confiscated by the Yugoslav Communist regime in 1947, but she was \"rehabilitated\" in 2014. ==Early life== Maria was born on January 6, 1900, at Friedenstein Palace in Gotha, a town in Thuringia, in the German Empire. She was named after her maternal grandmother, Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, and was known as Mignon in the family to distinguish her from her mother. Her parents were Princess Marie of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha and Prince Ferdinand of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen. In 1914, after the death of Carol I, they became King and Queen of Romania. She had three brothers and two sisters: King Carol II of Romania; Prince Nicholas of Romania; Princess Elisabeth of Romania and future Queen of Greece; Princess Ileana of Romania and future Archduchess of Austria (Tuscan line); and another brother, Prince Mircea of Romania, who died at age three. Although plump, Maria was a noted beauty in her youth and resembled her sister Elisabeth. During World War I, she worked as a nurse with her mother, along with her two sisters. ==Marriage and children== Peter, Tomislav and Andrew Maria married Alexander I, second King of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, in Belgrade on 8 June 1922, and had three sons: *King Peter II (1923\u20131970) \u221e Princess Alexandra of Greece and Denmark *Prince Tomislav (1928\u20132000) \u221e Princess Margarita of Baden \u221e Linda Mary Bonney Van Dyke *Prince Andrej (1929\u20131990) \u221e Princess Christina Margarethe of Hesse-Cassel \u221e Princess Kira Melita of Leiningen \u221e Princess Eva Marija Karadjordjevic Following the assassination of her husband, King Alexander I, in Marseille in 1934, her oldest son, then only 11 became Peter II of Yugoslavia, the last reigning Yugoslav king. She was given the title Queen Mother of Yugoslavia in 1941. She moved to a farm in England and lived a relatively normal life without royal extravagance. Maria was well educated. She spoke several languages fluently and enjoyed painting and sculpting under the guidance of artist Iva Despi\u0107- Simonovi\u0107. She also drove a car by herself, which was very unusual for royalty at the time. She died in exile in London on 22 June 1961 and was interred at the Royal Burial Ground at Frogmore, which adjoins Windsor Castle, before her remains were transferred to Serbia in April 2013 and re-interred on 26 May 2013 in Oplenac, Serbia.Yugoslavia's exiled Queen returns home at long last ==Humanitarian work== Queen Maria was popular and respected by the Serbian public, and is still well thought of in the region. She was regarded as an ideal wife and mother according to the contemporary Serbian ideal and described as a humble person. She was engaged in several social projects. In the eyes of the Serbian people, she remains one of the greatest patrons of charities in Serbia. Streets are named in her memory, such as \"Ulica kraljice Marije\" or \"Queen Maria Street\", and numerous schools and other organizations still carry her name. ===Titles and styles=== *6 January 1900 \u2013 8 June 1922: Her Royal Highness Princess Maria of Romania, Princess of Hohenzollern- Sigmaringen *8 June 1922 \u2013 6 January 1929: Her Majesty The Queen of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes *6 January 1929 \u2013 9 October 1934: Her Majesty The Queen of Yugoslavia *9 October 1934 \u2013 22 June 1961: Her Majesty Queen Maria of Yugoslavia Queen's summer residence near Budva, Montenegro ===Honours=== * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Carol I * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Crown of Romania * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Kara\u0111or\u0111e (8 June 1922) * : Dame Grand Cross of the Order of the Yugoslav Crown * : Dame Grand Cross of the Legion of Honour (1959)Fifty fifth memorial anniversary of HM Queen Maria at St. George Church in Oplenac ==Sources== ==External links== * Royal House of Yugoslavia * The Mausoleum of the Serbian Royal Family |- |- Category:1900 births Category:1961 deaths Category:People from Gotha (town) Category:Romanian princesses Category:Queen mothers Category:Yugoslav queens consort Category:Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 dynasty Category:Princesses of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen Category:Members of the Romanian Orthodox Church Category:Burials at the Mausoleum of the Royal House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107, Oplenac Category:Burials at the Royal Burial Ground, Frogmore Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of Carol I Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Crown (Romania) Category:Recipients of the Order of Kara\u0111or\u0111e's Star ",
