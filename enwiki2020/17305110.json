The Championship features a mix of professional motor racing teams and privately funded drivers. The Drivers compete in identical 911 Carrera GT3 Cup Cars, that conform technical regulations for the championship and aim to put driver skills in the spotlight. Although the championship is primarily held across the UK, single races in Germany, France and Belgium had been included to the regular racing calendar in seasons 2011, 2014 and 2015. Notable drivers are 2015 Le Mans winner Nick Tandy, two-time Porsche Mobil 1 winner Richard Westbrook and Supercup race winner Damien Faulkner. The Championship continues to be a prime support race to British Touring Car Championship and is featured on a 7-hour live coverage on ITV4 each race weekend. Teams, Drivers and sponsors benefit from the Porsche Carrera Cup GB being broadcast on live TV. In 2006 Porsche introduced a Pro-Am racing class (PA) for non-professional race drivers, giving them a chance to elevate their passion and benchmark their skills on the best national stage possible. By introducing an all-new Rookie class in 2015, Porsche provides a helping hand for young sports car drivers to build a professional racing career. This new class is primarily for young professional race drivers, aged between 17 and 24, with no prior Carrera Cup experience. By operating in its own class, Rookies are also able to compete within one of the other championship categories. The first place wins up to \u00a350.000, the second place wins \u00a320.000 and the third place still wins \u00a310.000. By competing in one of the other championship categories, Rookies are able to win even more money from their respective class. Also a new 911 Carrera Cup Car has been introduced for the 2015 season. All drivers are now competing in a new flat-six, rear-engine 911 (Type 991) GT3 Cup Car, with 460bhp (338kW). . ==Scoring system== {| class=\"wikitable\" !
