    "text": "Vienna Concert is a live solo piano album by American pianist Keith Jarrett recorded on July 13, 1991 at the Vienna Staatsoper in Vienna, Austria and released by ECM label in 1992. It has a forty-two-minute arch-like opening movement that exhibits a much greater debt to classical music than Jarrett's earlier improvised concerts. In its original liner notes Jarrett himself wrote \"I have courted the fire for a very long time, and many sparks have flown in the past, but the music on this recording speaks, finally, the language of the flame itself.\" ==Reception== The Allmusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album 4 stars, stating, \"Jarrett's exalted judgment is close to the mark; though more Eurocentric than ever, these are his most impressive solo performances since Sun Bear\".Ginell, R.
