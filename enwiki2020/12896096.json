Using email marketing and social media, Delaney was able to pre-sell 3,200 lbs of brisket in 48 hours at $25 per lb via online sales. The pre-ordered meat became redeemable at his Brisketlab series which launched in May 2012, and took place in locations like rooftops and cemeteries. Following much interest from Brisketlab, Delaney announced that he would transition the concept to a restaurant called BrisketTown. The restaurant opened on November 15, 2012 in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and has received much acclaim, including Best Breakfast in NYC from New York magazine and a Time Out New York Food & Drink Award.
