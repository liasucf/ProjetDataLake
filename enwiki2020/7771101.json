In January 2004, after an unassuming spell in Austria and a brief return to his first club, he signed with Spain's C\u00e1diz CF, where he would remain for the better part of the following six and a half seasons. With the Andalusia side, de la Cuesta competed in all three major levels of Spanish football. He played 15 games in La Liga in the 2005\u201306 campaign, which ended in relegation; his best output consisted of 25 matches and one goal in 2007\u201308, with his team also dropping down a tier, now from the second division. Released by C\u00e1diz in the summer of 2010, de la Cuesta joined another club in the country, Albacete Balompi\u00e9, having his season curtailed after suffering an anterior cruciate ligament injury to his left knee and again suffering team relegation from division two. ==International career== De la Cuesta represented Colombia at the 2003 FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates, partnering Pablo Pach\u00f3n in central defense as the national team finished third. ==References== ==External links== * *Stats and bio at Cadistas1910 * * *Austria Wien archives Category:1983 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Medell\u00edn Category:Colombian people of Spanish descent Category:Colombian footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Categor\u00eda Primera A players Category:Atl\u00e9tico Nacional footballers Category:Independiente Santa Fe footballers Category:Once Caldas footballers Category:Deportivo Pasto footballers Category:Austrian Football Bundesliga players Category:FK Austria Wien players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:C\u00e1diz CF players Category:Real Valladolid players Category:Albacete Balompi\u00e9 players Category:Colombia under-20 international footballers Category:Colombia international footballers Category:2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup players Category:Colombian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Austria Category:Expatriate footballers in Spain Category:Colombian expatriate sportspeople in Spain ",
