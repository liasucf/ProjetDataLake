Smith was born in Coventry in 1881. He moved to Northamptonshire with his family when he was five years old. He returned to West Yorkshire when he started his playing with Rothwell Town, where he was their leading goal- scorer. He moved on to Kettering Town where he continued to find the net, scoring 23 goals in his third and final season. He moved on to Southern League side Northampton Town in 1904 for one season. He was then signed for \u00a350 in March 1905 by Bradford City. He scored the only goal on his debut in a 1\u20130 win over Leeds City on 2 September 1905, finishing the 1905\u201306 season as top goal- scorer with 20 goals, including a goal in the 5\u20130 victory against First Division Wolverhampton Wanderers in the FA Cup.Giant Killers 1906 He again topped the scoring charts for City the following season with 14 goals as City came fifth. In 1907\u201308 he and Frank O'Rourke formed a lethal partnership to guide City to the Division Two title. Smith finished with 20 goals, one behind O'Rourke, including four against Chesterfield in an opening day 8\u20131 win. Smith struggled in Division One and he failed to find the net in 16 games, leaving in January 1909 for Leicester Fosse.
