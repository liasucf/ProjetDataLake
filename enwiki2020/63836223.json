He later formed a partnership with John Ladds as Ladds and Powell which lasted until around 1890 when he emigrated to South Africa. In South Africa he set up a practice in Durban. On his death in 1900, his eldest son William continued the practice in Durban. He was nominated ARIBA in 1873 and FRIBA in 1887. ==Personal life== He was born in 1847 in Lewes, Sussex, the son of Revd. William Powell (b. 1810) and Matilda Spencer Blaine (1810 - 1891). He married Clara Welch (1852 - 1920), daughter of J.D. Welch of Herne Hill on 23 April 1873 at St Paul's Church, Herne Hill, and they had four sons: *William Powell (b. 1874) *Sydney Powell (b. 1877) *John Stewart Powell (b. 1885) *Owen Powell (b. 1886) In 1889 he was cited in a divorce case by Ralph Thomas, a solicitor in practice in Chancery Lane on the grounds of his wife's adultery with Powell.
