    "text": "Ascalabus, in Greek mythology, was a son of Misme. When Demeter, on her wanderings in search of her daughter Persephone, came to Misme in Attica, the goddess was received kindly, and being exhausted and thirsty, Misme gave her something to drink (a kykeon). As the goddess emptied the vessel at one draught, Ascalabus laughed at her, and ordered a whole cask to be brought. Demeter, indignant at the boy's conduct, sprinkled the few remaining drops from her vessel upon him and thereby changed him into a lizard.Antoninus Liberalis, Metamorphoses 24 The tale is preserved in Antoninus Liberalis' Metamorphoses, which cites Nicander's lost Heteroeumena. The tale is also told in Ovid's Metamorphoses,Ovid, Metamorphoses V.446-461 though Ascalabus and his mother go unnamed: \"presumably... to avoid confusion with Ascalaphus\". == See also == * Baubo * Iambe * Metaneira ==Notes== == References == * Welcker, Das Kunst-Museum zu Bonn, p. 74, &c.; * Grant, Michael and Hazel, John, Who's Who In Classical Mythology Category:Eleusinian Mysteries Category:Attic mythology Category:Metamorphoses into animals in Greek mythology ",
