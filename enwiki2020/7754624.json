    "text": "Surface of a concrete pillar with crack pattern of alkali\u2013silica reaction Alkali\u2013aggregate reaction is a term mainly referring to a reaction which occurs over time in concrete between the highly alkaline cement paste and non- crystalline silicon dioxide, which is found in many common aggregates. This reaction can cause expansion of the altered aggregate, leading to spalling and loss of strength of the concrete. ==More accurate terminology== The alkali\u2013aggregate reaction is a general, but relatively vague, expression which can lead to confusion. More precise definitions include the following: # Alkali\u2013silica reaction (ASR, the most common reaction of this type); # Alkali\u2013silicate reaction, and; # Alkali\u2013carbonate reaction. The alkali\u2013silica reaction is the most common form of alkali\u2013aggregate reaction. Two other types are: * the alkali\u2013silicate reaction, in which layer silicate minerals (clay minerals), sometimes present as impurities, are attacked, and; * the alkali\u2013carbonate reaction, which is an uncommon attack on certain argillaceous dolomitic limestones, likely involving the expansion of the mineral Brucite (Mg(OH)2. The Pozzolanic reaction which occurs in the setting of the mixture of slaked lime and pozzolanic materials has also features similar to the alkali\u2013silica reaction, mainly the formation of calcium silicate hydrate (CSH). ==See also== * Energetically modified cement (EMC) * Calthemite * Pozzolanic reaction ==External links== *Cement.org | Alkali- aggregate reaction *Alkali-Aggregate Reactions (AAR) \u2013 International Centre of Research and Applied Technology Category:Cement Category:Concrete Category:Chemical reactions de:Alkali-Kiesels\u00e4ure-Reaktion fr:R\u00e9action alcali- granulat it:Reazione alcali aggregati pt:Rea\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e1lcali-agregado ",
