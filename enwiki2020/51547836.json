    "text": "In praxeology, methodological dualism is an epistemological position which states that it is necessary \u2500 based on our current state of knowledge and understanding \u2500 to use a different method in analysing the actions of human beings than the methods of the natural sciences (such as physics, chemistry, physiology, etc.).Mises. (1957). Theory and history, p. 1. This position is based on the presupposition that humans differ radically from other objects in the external world. Namely, humans purposefully aim at chosen ends and employ chosen means to attain them (i.e. humans act), whereas other objects in nature \u2500 such as, for example, sticks, stones, and atoms \u2500 do not.id., p. xiii. Methodological dualism is not a metaphysical or ontological doctrine, and refrains from making such judgments.id., p. 1. == Overview == Ludwig von Mises' insistence on methodological dualism was a reaction against \u201cthe \u2018methodological monism\u2019 preached by behaviorists and positivists who [saw] no basic reason to approach human behavior and social phenomena differently from the way natural scientists approach molecular behavior and physical phenomena.\u201dWhite, L. (2003). The methodology of the Austrian school economists, p. 17. Mises states that the sciences of human action deal with ends and means, with volition, with meaning and understanding, with \u201cthoughts, ideas, and judgments of value\u201d. Action is the purposive use of chosen means for the attainment of chosen ends, and ideas, beliefs, and judgments of value (called mental phenomena) determine the choice of both means and ends.Mises. (2008). Human action: A treatise on economics, pp. 11-3. Thus, these mental phenomena occupy a central position in the sciences of human action for, as Mises argues, \u201cacts of choosing are determined by thoughts and ideas.\u201dTheory and history, p. 11. In arguing for methodological dualism, Mises states because the natural sciences have not yet determined \u201chow definite external events [\u2026] produce within the human mind definite ideas, value judgments, and volitions\u201d,Mises. (1962). The ultimate foundation of economic science, p. 83. this ignorance splits our knowledge into two distinct fields, the \u201crealm of external events\u201d on the one hand, and the \u201crealm of human thought and action\u201d on the other. Thus Mises\u2019 conception of the sciences of human action \u2500 i.e. praxeology and thymology \u2500 is based on this methodological dualism. Mises argues that because we are ourselves thinking and acting beings we can reflect, through introspection,Theory and history, p. 283-4. on the meaning of action, of intention and volition, of ends and means, and on our ideas, beliefs, and judgments of value. This kind of reflective knowledge, Mises insists, is knowledge from within us, \u201cis our own because we are men\u201c,Human action, p. 64. whereas we are not stones or atoms and so we cannot reflect on what it means to be these things. == See also == * Behavioral economics * Cognitive science * Methodological individualism ==References== Category:Austrian School ",
