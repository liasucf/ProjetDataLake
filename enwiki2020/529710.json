    "text": "Kresy Wschodnie or simply Kresy (, Borderlands or Eastern Borderlands) was a term coined for the eastern part of the Second Polish Republic during the interwar period (1918\u20131939). Largely agricultural and extensively multi- ethnic, it amounted to nearly half of the territory of pre-war Poland. Historically situated in the eastern Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, following the 18th-century foreign partitions it was annexed by Russia and partly by the Habsburg Monarchy (Galicia), and ceded back to Poland in 1921 after the Peace of Riga. As a result of the post-World War II border changes, none of the Kresy lands remain in Poland today. The Polish plural term Kresy corresponds to the Russian okrainy (), a politicized name for non-Russian or non-Orthodox \"peripheries\" or \"borderlands\",Tomasz Kamusella. (2018) The Russian Okrainy (O\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u044b) and the Polish Kresy: Objectivity and Historiography. Global Intellectual History. DOI: 10.1080/23801883.2018.1511186. derived from the same Old East Slavic root as Ukraiina (), the name of Ukraine. It is also largely co-terminous with the \"Pale of Settlement\", a scheme devised by Catherine the Great to limit Jews from settling in homogenously Christian Orthodox core of the Russian Empire, such as Moscow and Saint Petersburg. The Pale was established after the Second Partition of Poland and lasted until the 1917 revolution, when the Russian Empire ceased to exist. In the aftermath of the Polish\u2013Soviet War and the Peace of Riga, both Austrian and Russian sectors of the Kresy were reincorporated into Poland. However, the population already consisted of various religious and ethnic minorities, which exceeded the number of ethnic Poles, for instance Jews in small towns called shtetls and Ukrainians in the region of Volhynia. Administratively, the Kresy territory was composed of Lw\u00f3w, Nowogr\u00f3dek, Polesie, Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w, Tarnopol, Wilno, Wo\u0142y\u0144, and Bia\u0142ystok voivodeships (provinces). Today, all these regions are divided between Western Ukraine, Western Belarus, and south-eastern Lithuania, with the major cities of Lviv, Vilnius, and Grodno no longer in Poland. During the Second Polish Republic Kresy denoted the lands beyond the so-called, Curzon Line, proposed after World War I by the British Foreign Office in December 1919 as the eastern border of the re-emerging sovereign Polish Republic after over a century of partitions. In September 1939, after the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany simultaneously invaded Poland under the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, all the territories were forcibly incorporated into the Soviet republics of Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania, often by means of terror.Bernd Wegner (1997). From peace to war: Germany, Soviet Russia, and the world, 1939-1941\\. Berghahn Books. p. 74. . Soviet territorial annexations during World War II were later ratified by the Allies at the Tehran Conference, the Yalta Conference and at the Potsdam Conference. When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991, the several parts of Kresy remained within the former Soviet republics as they gained their own independence. Even though the Eastern Borderlands are no longer part of Poland, the provinces are still home to a Polish minority and the memory of \"Kresy\", as a continuation of their centuries-long nationhood, is maintained among many of them. However, in present-day Poland, the attachment to the \"mythic Kresy\", including the prewar vision of the regions as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been debunked in Polish political discourse after the collapse of the Soviet Union.odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12 == Etymology == Typical landscape view of the , marked by low-lying rolling hills and grasslands (location Sielec, Drohobych Raion, western Ukraine) Polish voivodeships 1922\u20131939. One can consider the six easternmost voivodeships as roughly equivalent with . The Polish word (\"borderlands\") is the plural form of the word meaning 'edge'. According to , it is \"a medieval borrowing from the German word \", which in the Middle Ages meant (\"borderline, delineation or circumscribed territory\").Zbigniew Go\u0142\u0105b, \"The Origin and Etymology of Old Russian ,\" International Journal of Slavic Linguistics and Poetics 31/32 (1985, Festschrift H. Birnbaum): 167\u2013174, page 173. Samuel Linde in his Dictionary of the Polish Language gives a different etymology of the term. According to him, meant the borderline between Poland and the Crimean Khanate, in the region of the lower Dnieper. The term appeared for the first time in literature in poems, \"\" (1854) and \"\". Pol claimed that Kresy was the line between the Dniester and Dnieper rivers, neighbouring the Tatar borderland. Coincidentally in relation to Jewish settlement in the macro region, the notion of the pale is an archaic English term derived from the Latin word ', (which in Polish exists as pal and also means a stake), extended in this instance to mean the area enclosed by a fence or boundary.\"pale, n.1.\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, September 2016. Retrieved October 24, 2016. The Pale was the part of medieval Ireland controlled by the English government. At the beginning of the 20th century, the meaning of the term expanded to include the lands of the former eastern provinces of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, east of the line. In the Second Polish Republic, equated to historically Polish settled lands to the east of the notional Curzon line. Currently, the term applies to all the eastern lands of the Second Polish Republic that are longer within the frontiers of modern Poland, together with lands further east, that had been integral to the Commonwealth before 1772, and where Polish communities continue to exist. == History == Polish eastern settlements date back to the dawn of Poland as a state. In 1018, King Boles\u0142aw I the Brave invaded Kievan Rus (see Boleslaw I's intervention in the Kievan succession crisis, 1018), capturing Kiev, and annexing Red Strongholds. In 1340, Red Ruthenia came under Polish control, which intensified defensive Polish settlement and the introduction of Catholicism. After the Union of Lublin 1569, more Polish settlers moved into the eastern borderlands of the vast Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth. Most of them came from the Polish provinces of Mazovia and Lesser Poland. They had moved gradually eastwards settling in sparsely populated areas, inhabited by earlier settlers (Lithuanians and Ruthenians). Moreover, the indigenous upper classes of Kresy accepted Polish religion, culture and language, resulting in their assimilation and Polonization. ===The Partitions of Poland=== The year 1772 marked the first partition of the Commonwealth of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (see Partitions of Poland). By 1795, the whole eastern half of the state had been annexed by the Russian Empire in concert with the Habsburgs and Prussia's Hohenzollerns. The dramatic westward expansion of the Russian Empire through the annexation of Polish-Lithuanian territory substantially increased the new \"Russian\" Jewish population. Kresy and the superimposed Pale, in the former Polish and Lithuanian territories, had a Jewish population of over five million, and represented the largest community (40%) of the world Jewish population at that time. From the Polish perspective, the lands came to be called the \"Stolen Lands\". Even though Poles were becoming a minority in those areas, owing to forced depopulation, the \"Stolen Lands\" remained an integral part of Polish national identity, with Polish cultural centres and seats of learning in Wilno University, Jan Kazimierz University and Liceum Krzemienieckie among many others. Since many local educated inhabitants had actively participated in Polish national insurgencies (November Uprising, January Uprising), the Russian authorities resorted to intensified persecution, confiscations of property and land, penal deportation to Siberia, and the systematic attempt at Russification of Poles and their traditional culture and institutions. ===The Pale of Settlement=== The Pale of Settlement From the Russian perspective the \"Pale of Settlement\" included all of Belarus, Lithuania and Moldova, much of present-day Ukraine, parts of eastern Latvia, eastern Poland, and some parts of western Russia, generally corresponding to the Kresy macroregion and the modern-day western border of Russia. It extended from the eastern pale, or demarcation line, to the Russian border with the Kingdom of Prussia (later the German Empire) and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. It also comprised about 20% of the territory of European Russia and largely corresponded to historical lands of the former Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth, Cossack Hetmanate, and the Ottoman Empire (with Crimean Khanate). The area included in the Pale, with its large Jewish, Uniate and Catholic populations, was acquired through a series of military conquests and diplomatic manoeuvres, between 1654 and 1815. While the religious nature of the edicts creating the Pale is clear: conversion to Russian Orthodoxy, the state religion, released individuals from the strictures - historians argue that the motivations for its creation and maintenance were primarily economic and nationalistic in nature. On the anniversary of the institution of the Pale of Settlement ===Economic decline of Kresy=== Leon Wycz\u00f3\u0142kowski \"Ploughing in the Ukraine\" The Russian Empire had abandoned Kresy to decline as a vast rural backwater after the original Polish landowners had been disposed of in the wake of insurrections and the Abolition of serfdom in Poland in 1864. The devastation of country estates put a halt to large scale economic activity which had depended on agriculture, forestry, brewing and small scale industries. Paradoxically, the Southern Kresy (present-day Ukraine) was famous for its fertile soil and was known as the \"bread basket of Europe\". Towards the end of the 19th century, the decline was so acute that trade and food supplies became problematic and large scale emigration from towns and villages began as Jewish communities, in particular, began heading West, to Europe and the United States. By the time of a newly resurgent Polish state, the provinces had been additionally disadvantaged by having the lowest literacy levels in the country, since education had not been compulsory during Russian rule.W dodatku Kresy Wschodnie II Rzeczypospolitej by\u0142y najbiedniejszym regionem kraju Polska ludno\u015b\u0107 kresowa: rodow\u00f3d, liczebno\u015b\u0107, rozmieszczenie Piotr Eberhardt, page 21 Wydawnictwo Naukowe PWN, 1998Historia gospodarcza Polski Andrzej Jezierski, page 269, 2006 The regions had suffered a legacy of decades of neglect and underinvestment so were generally less economically developed than the western parts of interwar Poland. === Between the World Wars === The years 1918\u20131921 were especially turbulent for Kresy, due to the resurgence of the Polish nation-state and the formation of new borders. At that time, Poland had fought three wars to establish its eastern frontier: with Ukraine (see Polish\u2013Ukrainian War), the Soviet Union (see Polish\u2013Soviet War), and with Lithuania (see Polish\u2013Lithuanian War). In all three conflicts Poland emerged victorious, and as a result, it recovered territories that had been previously annexed under Russian conquest and were east of the Curzon line, plus land formerly absorbed into Austrian Eastern Galicia. The region later formed the eastern provinces of the Second Polish Republic. Territories that were included in Kresy during the interbellum period comprised the eastern part of Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship, Nowogr\u00f3dek Voivodeship, Polesie Voivodeship, Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship, Tarnopol Voivodeship, Wilno Voivodeship, Wo\u0142y\u0144 Voivodeship, and the eastern part of Bia\u0142ystok Voivideship. The Polish government undertook an active policy of re- polonization in those territories (see Osadnik). This led to frequent conflicts with Ukrainian nationalists in the southeastern part of the Kresy region (see Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia (1930)). Numerous Polish communities continued to live beyond the eastern border of the Second Polish Republic, especially around Minsk, Zhytomir and Berdychev. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, the Soviet authorities created two Polish Autonomous Districts in Belarus and Ukraine, but during the Polish operation of the NKVD, most of the Poles in those areas were murdered, while those remaining were forcibly resettled in Kazakhstan (see also Poles in the former Soviet Union). === During and after World War II=== Soviet NKVD prison massacre in Lw\u00f3w ahead of the German advance, June 1941 Members of the German Ordnungspolizei shooting naked women and children in the Mizocz ghetto, October 1942 Massacres of Poles in Volhynia in 1943. Most Poles of Volhynia (now in Ukraine) had either been murdered or had fled the area. As a consequence of the Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact, on September 17, 1939, the Kresy territories were annexed by the Soviet Union (see Soviet invasion of Poland), and a significant part of the ethnic Polish population of Kresy was deported to other areas of the Soviet Union including Siberia and Kazakhstan.Michael Hope, Polish Deportees in the Soviet Union, Veritas Foundation, London, 2000, The new border between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union was re-designated by the German\u2013Soviet Frontier Treaty, signed on September 29, 1939. After the elections to the People's Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus, communist governments for Western Ukraine and Western Belarus were formed and immediately announced their intention of joining their respective republics to the Soviet Union (see also Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union). After the German invasion of the USSR, the southeastern part of Kresy was absorbed into Greater Germany's General Government, whereas the rest was integrated with the Reichskommissariats Ostland and Ukraine. In 1943\u20131944, units of the Ukrainian Insurgent Army, with the help of Ukrainian peasants, carried out mass exterminations of Poles living in southeastern Kresy (see Massacres of Poles in Wo\u0142y\u0144). In January 1944, Soviet troops had reached the former Polish\u2013Soviet border, and by the end of July 1944, they again re- annexed the whole territory that had been taken by the USSR in September 1939 into their control. During the Tehran Conference in 1943, a new Soviet-Polish border was established, in effect sanctioning most of the Soviet territorial acquisitions of September 1939 (except for some areas around Bia\u0142ystok and Przemy\u015bl), ignoring protests from the Polish government-in-exile in London. The Potsdam Conference, via substantive recognition of the pro-Soviet Polish Committee of National Liberation, implicitly consented to the deportation of Polish people from Kresy (see Polish population transfers (1944\u20131946)). Most Polish inhabitants of Kresy were ordered by the Soviets to migrate west to Germany's former eastern provinces, newly emptied of their German population and renamed as the \"Recovered Territories\" of the People's Republic of Poland, based on Polish medieval settlement of the areas. Poles from the southern Kresy (now Ukraine) were forced to settle mainly in Silesia, while those from the north (Belarus and Lithuania) moved to Pomerania and Masuria. Polish residents of Lw\u00f3w settled not only in Wroc\u0142aw, but also in Gliwice and in Bytom. Those cities had not been destroyed during the war. They were relatively closer to the new eastern border of Poland, which could become significant in case of a sudden hoped for a return to the East.Gazeta Wyborcza, Kresowianie nie mieli wyboru, musieli jecha\u0107 na zach\u00f3d, interview with Professor Grzegorz Hryciuk, 2010-12-20 Frequently, whole Kresy villages and towns were deported in a single rail transport to new locations in the west. For instance, the village of Bia\u0142a, near Chojn\u00f3w, is still divided into two parts: Lower Bia\u0142a and Upper Bia\u0142a. Lower Bia\u0142a was settled by people who used to live in a Bieszczady village of Polana near Ustrzyki Dolne (this area belonged to the Soviet Union until 1951: see 1951 Polish\u2013Soviet territorial exchange), while inhabitants of the village Pyszkowce near Buczacz moved to Upper Bia\u0142a. Every year in September, Bia\u0142a is the scene of an annual festival called Kresowiana. In Szczecin and Polish West Pomerania, in the immediate postwar period, one-third of Polish settlers were either people from Kresy or Sybiraks. In 1948, people born in the Eastern Borderlands made up 47.5% of the population of Opole, 44.7% of Babor\u00f3w, 47.5% of Wo\u0142czyn, 42.1% of G\u0142ubczyce, 40.1% of Lewin Brzeski, and 32.6% of Brzeg. In 2011, people with Kresy background made up 25% of the population of the Opole Voivodeship. The town of Jasie\u0144 was settled by people from the area of Ternopil in late 1945 and early 1946, while Poles from Borschiv moved to Trzci\u0144sko-Zdr\u00f3j and Chojna. The situation was completely different in Wschowa and its county. In 1945\u20131948, more than 8,000 people moved there. They came from different areas of the Kresy \u2014 Ashmyany, Stanislawow, R\u00f3wne, Lw\u00f3w, Brody, Dziat\u0142ava district, and Tarnopol. Altogether, between 1944\u20131946, more than a million Poles from the Kresy were moved to the Recovered Territories, including 150,000 from the area of Wilno, 226,300 from Polesie, 133,900 from Wo\u0142y\u0144, 5,000 from Northern Bukovina, and 618,200 from Eastern Galicia.Gazeta Wyborcza, Pierwsza fala przesiedlen The so-called First Repatriation of Poles (1944\u20131946) was carried out in a chaotic, disorganized way. People had to spend weeks, even months at railroad stations, waiting for transport. During that time, they were robbed of their belongings by either locals, Soviet soldiers or Soviet rail workers. For lack of railroad cars, in Lithuania at some point the \"one-suitcase policy\" was introduced, which meant that Poles had to leave behind all their belongings. They travelled in freight or open wagons, and the journeys were long and dangerous, as there was no protection from the military or the police. In the immediate postwar period, Polish Communists, who ceded the Eastern Borderlands to the Soviet Union, were universally regarded as traitors, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Gomu\u0142ka, First Secretary of the Polish Workers' Party, was fully aware of it. People who moved from the East to the Recovered Territories talked amongst themselves about their return to Lw\u00f3w and other eastern locations, and the German return to Silesia, as a result of World War III, in which Western Allies would defeat the Soviets. One of the adages of the postwar period was: \"Just one atom bomb, and we will be back in Lw\u00f3w\" (\"Jedna bomba atomowa i wr\u00f3cimy zn\u00f3w do Lwowa\"). Polish settlers in former German areas were insecure about their future there until the 1970s (see Warschauer Kniefall). Eastern settlers did not feel at home in Lower Silesia, and as a result, they did not care about the machinery, households and farms abandoned by Germans. Lubomierz in 1945 was in good condition, but in the following years, Polish settlers from the area of Czortk\u00f3w in Podolia let it run down and become a ruin. The Germans were aware of it. In 1959, German sources wrote that Lower Silesia had been ruined by the Poles. Zdzis\u0142aw Mach, a sociologist from the Jagiellonian University, explains that when Poles were forced to resettle in the West, which they resented, they had to leave the land they considered sacred and move to areas inhabited by the enemy. In addition, Communist authorities did not initially invest in the Recovered Territories because, like the settlers, for a long time they were unsure about the future of these lands. As Mach says, people in Western Poland for years lived \"on their suitcases\", with all their belongings packed in case of return to the East. == Interwar population == The population of Kresy was multi- ethnic, primarily comprising Poles, Jews, Ukrainians and Belarusians. According to official Polish statistics from the interwar period, Poles formed the largest linguistic group in these regions, and were demographically the largest ethnic group in the cities. Other national minorities included Lithuanians and Karaites (in the north), Jews (scattered in cities and towns across the area), Czechs and Germans (in Wo\u0142y\u0144 and East Galicia), Armenians and Hungarians (in Lw\u00f3w) and also Russians and Tartars.\"Polskie Drogi\" by Bogdan Trybuchowski Map of native speakers of Polish (red) vs. other languages (green) according to the Polish census of 1931; original map by the Main Bureau of Statistics The proportions of different native languages in each voivodeship in 1931, according to the Polish census of 1931, were as follows: *Lw\u00f3w Voivodeship; 58% Polish, 34% Ukrainian, 8% Yiddish *Nowogrodek Voivideship; 53% Polish, 39% Belarusian, 7% Yiddish, 1% Russian *Polesie Voivodeship; 63% \"Other\" or Tutejsi, 14% Polish, 10% Yiddish, 6% Belarusian, 5% Ukrainian *Stanis\u0142aw\u00f3w Voivodeship; 69% Ukrainian, 23% Polish, 7% Yiddish, 1% German *Tarnopol Voivodeship; 49% Polish, 46% Ukrainian, 5% Yiddish *Wilno Voivodeship; 60% Polish, 23% Belarusian, 8% Yiddish, 3% Russian, 8% Other (including Lithuanian) * Volhynia Voivodeship; 68% Ukrainian, 17% Polish, 10% Yiddish, 2% German, 1% Russian, 2% Other *Bia\u0142ystok Voivodeship; 67% Polish, 16% Belarusian, 12% Yiddish, 3% Russian, 2% OtherHistoria 1871\u20131939 Anna Radziwi\u0142\u0142, Wojciech Roszkowski Warsaw 2000 page 278 In addition to ethnic Poles in former eastern Poland, there were also large Polish communities in the USSR and in the Baltic states.

The family of former President of Poland, Bronis\u0142aw Komorowski, allegedly hails from northern Lithuania. The mother of Bogdan Zdrojewski, Minister of Culture and National Heritage is from Boryslav, and the father of former First Lady Jolanta Kwa\u015bniewska was born in Wo\u0142y\u0144, where his sister was murdered in 1943 by the Ukrainian nationalists. == Cradle of Polish culture == Map of areas where Polish was used as a primary language in 1916 Map of the Polish population living in Lithuania on the basis of elections to the parliament of Lithuania in 1923, censuses in 1921 and elections to the Polish parliament in 1922 Since some of the most distinguished names of Polish literature and music were born in Kresy, e.g. Miko\u0142aj Rej, Adam Mickiewicz, Juliusz S\u0142owacki, Karol Szymanowski or Czes\u0142aw Mi\u0142osz, Eastern Borderlands have featured repeatedly in the Polish Literary canon. Mickiewicz's Pan Tadeusz begins with the Polish language invocation, \"O Lithuania, my fatherland, thou art like good health....\" Other notable works located in Kresy, are Nad Niemnem, Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass, With Fire and Sword, Fire in the Steppe. In Communist Poland, all Kresy-related topics, such as Poland's eastern centuries old heritage, including ecclesiastical architecture, country houses and stately homes down to the Massacres of Poles in Wo\u0142y\u0144 were banned from publication for Soviet propaganda reasons, because these lands now belonged to the Soviet Union. In official documents, people born in the Eastern Borderlands were declared as born in the Soviet Union, and very few Kresy- themed books or films were passed by the state censor at that time. One of the exceptions was the immensely popular comedy trilogy by Sylwester Ch\u0119ci\u0144ski (Sami swoi from 1967, Nie ma mocnych from 1974, and Kochaj albo rzu\u0107 from 1977). The trilogy tells the story of two quarreling families, who after the end of the Second World War were resettled from current Western Ukraine to Lower Silesia, after Poland was shifted westwards. After the collapse of the Communist system, the old Kresy returned as a Polish cultural theme in the form of historical polemics. Numerous books and albums were published about the Eastern Borderlands, frequently with original photos from the prewar era. Examples of such publications include: * Roman Aftanazy.

Red: pre-World War II Polish-Lithuanian border The territory known to Poles as Kresy is now partitioned off between the states of Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania. Ethnic Poles still live in those areas: in Lithuania, they are the largest ethnic minority in the country (see Poles in Lithuania), in Belarus, they are the second largest ethnic minority in the country after Russians (see Poles in Belarus), and in Ukraine, they officially number 144,130, but some Polish organizations claim that the number of Poles in Ukraine may be as many as 2 million, most of them assimilated. (see Poles in Ukraine). Furthermore, there is a 50,000 Polish minority in Latvia. In Lithuania and Belarus, Poles are more numerous than in Ukraine. This is the result of the Massacres of Poles in Wo\u0142y\u0144 Voivodeship. Those Poles who survived the slaughter begged for the opportunity to emigrate. Many Polish organizations are active in the former Eastern Borderlands, such as the Association of Poles in Ukraine, Association of Polish Culture of the Lviv Land, there Federation of Polish Organizations in Ukraine, Union of Poles in Belarus, and the Association of Poles in Lithuania. There are Polish sports clubs (Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w, FK Polonia Vilnius), newspapers (Gazeta Lwowska, Kurier Wile\u0144ski), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), many theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in Kresy are helped by a government- sponsored organization Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie, and by other organizations, such as the Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy (see also Karta Polaka). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in Kresy, and there are several annual events, such as \"Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy\", and \"Summer with Poland\", sponsored by Association \"Polish Community\", in which Polish children from Kresy are invited to visit Poland. Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to Kresy. Books are most often sent to Polish schools which exist there \u2014 for example, in December 2010, University of Wroclaw organized an event called \" Become a Polish Santa Claus and Give a Book to a Polish Child in Kresy\". Polish churches and cemeteries (such as Cemetery of the Defenders of Lw\u00f3w) are renovated with money from Poland. For example, in Nysa, money is collected to renovate the Roman Catholic church in Lopatyn near Lviv,\u0141opatyn - nyskie serca na kresach while residents of O\u0142awa collect funds to renovate the church in Sasiv, also in the area of Lviv.Aby nie zapomnie\u0107 gdzie s\u0105 nasze korzenie... Also, physicians from Krak\u00f3w's organization Doctors of Hope regularly visit Eastern Borderlands, and Polish Ministry of Education runs a special program, which sends Polish teachers to former Soviet Union. In 2007, more than 700 teachers worked in the East, most of them in Kresy.700 kresowych nauczycieli Studio East of Polish TV Wroc\u0142aw organizes an event called \"Save your grandfather's tomb from oblivion\" (Mogi\u0142\u0119 pradziada ocal od zapomnienia), during which students from Lower Silesia visit Western Ukraine, to clean Polish cemeteries there. In July 2011, about 150 students cleaned 16 cemeteries in the areas of Lviv, Ternopil, Podolia and Pokuttya. Despite wars and ethnic cleansing many treasures of Polish culture still remain in the East. In Vilnius, there is the Wr\u00f3blewski Library, with 160,000 volumes and 30,000 manuscripts, which now belong to the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences. In Lviv, there is the Ossolineum, one of the most important Polish culture centres. Adolf Juzwenko, current president of Wroc\u0142aw's office of the Ossolineum, says that in 1945, there was a mass public campaign in Poland, aimed at transporting the whole Ossolineum to Wroc\u0142aw. It succeeded in recovering only 200,000 volumes, as the Soviets decided that the bulk of the library had to remain in Lviv. === In contemporary Poland === Even though Poland lost its Eastern Borderlands in the aftermath of World War II, Poles connected with the Kresy still keep a flame burning for those lands. Since Poles from current Western Ukraine mostly moved to Silesia, the city of Wroc\u0142aw is regarded as miasto lwowskie (city of Lw\u00f3w affinity), while Toru\u0144, Gda\u0144sk and Olsztyn are regarded as miasta wile\u0144skie (cities of Wilno affinity).Kresowiacy na nowym miejscu, Rzeczpospolita daily Lw\u00f3w's Ossolineum Foundation, its collections and famous library are now located in Wroc\u0142aw. Polish academics from Lw\u00f3w established the Polish University of Wroc\u0142aw (taking over from the old German University of Breslau) and Silesian University of Technology. At the same time, Polish academics from Vilnius founded Nicolaus Copernicus University in Toru\u0144. There are numerous Kresy- oriented organizations, with the largest one, World Congress of Kresy Inhabitants (\u015awiatowy Kongres Kresowian), located in Bytom, and branches scattered across Poland, and abroad. The Congress organizes annual World Convention and Pilgrimage of Kresy Inhabitants to Jasna G\u00f3ra Monastery. Other important Kresy organizations, active in contemporary Poland, include: * Polskie Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Miasta Krzemie\u0144ca i Ziemi Krzemienieckiej (Polish Association of Lovers of Krzemieniec and Krzemieniec Land) from Pozna\u0144. * Stowarzyszenie Kresowe \"Podkamie\u0144\" (Kresy Association \"Podkamien\") from Wo\u0142\u00f3w, * Stowarzyszenie Odra-Niemen (Association Odra - Niemen) from Wroc\u0142aw, * Stowarzyszenie Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Ziemi Drohobyckiej (Association of Friends of Drohobycz Land) from Legnica, * Stowarzyszenie Rodzin Osadnik\u00f3w Wojskowych i Cywilnych Kres\u00f3w Wschodnich (Association of Families of Osadniks of Eastern Borderlands) from Warsaw, * Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Kultury Kresowej (Association of Friends of Kresy Culture) from Wroclaw, * Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Wo\u0142ynia i Polesia (Association of Lovers of Wo\u0142yn and Polesie) from Warsaw, * Towarzystwo Mi\u0142o\u015bnik\u00f3w Lwowa i Kres\u00f3w Po\u0142udniowo-Wschodnich (Association of Lovers of Lw\u00f3w and Southeastern Kresy) from Wroc\u0142aw, with branches in Brzeg, Bydgoszcz, Bytom, Che\u0142m, Gda\u0144sk, Jelenia G\u00f3ra, K\u0142odzko, Krak\u00f3w, Leszno, Lublin, Pozna\u0144, Szczecinek, \u015awidwin, Warszawa, W\u0119gliniec and Zabrze, * Towarzystwo Przyjaci\u00f3\u0142 Grodna i Wilna (Association of Friends of Grodno and Wilno), with branches in Bia\u0142ystok, E\u0142k, Gda\u0144sk, Gi\u017cycko, Lublin, \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, Ostro\u0142\u0119ka, Stargard Szczeci\u0144ski, Warszawa, W\u0119gorzewo, Wroc\u0142aw, * Zwi\u0105zek Sybirakow (Association of Sybiraks) from Warsaw, with branches scattered across Poland and abroad.

It turned out that almost 15% of the population of Poland (4,3 - 4,6 million people) declared that they either were born in the Kresy, or have a parent or a grandparent from that region. The number of Kresowiacy is high in northern and western Poland \u2013 as many as 51% of inhabitants of Lubusz Voivodeship, and 47% of inhabitants of Lower Silesian Voivodeship stated that their family has ties to the Kresy. Furthermore, Kresowiacy now make 30% of the population of Opole Voivodeship, 25% of the population of West Pomeranian Voivodeship, and 18% of the population of Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship.CBOS: co si\u00f3dmy Polak pochodzi z Kres\u00f3w, onet.pl Retrieved April 16, 2012 ==Polish regional dialects== Since Poles have lived in Kresy for hundreds of years, two groups of Kresy Polish dialects emerged: the northern (dialekt p\u00f3\u0142nocnokresowy), and the southern (dialekt po\u0142udniowokresowy). Both dialects have been influenced either by Ukrainian, Belarusian or by Lithuanian. To Polish speakers in Poland, Kresy dialects are easy to distinguish, as their pronunciation and intonation are markedly different from standard Polish. Before World War II, the Kresy provinces were part of Poland, and both dialects were in common usage, spoken by millions of ethnic Poles. After the war and Soviet annexation of Kresy, however, the majority of ethnic Poles were deported westward, resulting in a severe decline in the number of native speakers. The northern Kresy dialect is still used along the Lithuanian-Belarusian border, where Poles still live in large numbers, but the southern Kresy dialect is endangered, as Poles in western Ukraine do not form a majority of the population in any district. Particularly notable among the Kresy dialects is the Lw\u00f3w dialect which emerged early in the 19th century and was spoken in the city gaining much recognition in the 1920s and 1930s, partly due to the countrywide popularity of numerous Kresy- born and trained actors and comedians whose native speech it was (see also: Dialects of the Polish language). == See also == *Bug River land *Lithuanian and Belarusian Self-Defence *Lw\u00f3w Eaglets *Peace of Riga *Poles in the former Soviet Union *Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union *Polish historical regions *Polish National-Territorial Region *Polonia *Republic of Central Lithuania *Repatriation of Poles (1955\u20131959) *Soviet repressions of Polish citizens (1939\u20131946) *Suwa\u0142ki Agreement *Treaty of Brest-Litovsk *Treaty of Warsaw (1920) *Vilnius Region *Volhynia Experiment *Wanda Wasilewska *West Ukrainian People's Republic * Zakerzonia *\u017beligowski's Mutiny == References == * Ma\u0142y rocznik statystyczny 1939, G\u0142\u00f3wny Urz\u0105d Statystyczny, Warszawa 1939 (Concise Statistical Yearbook 1939, Central Statistical Office, Warsaw 1939). == Bibliography == * Beauvois, Daniel.
