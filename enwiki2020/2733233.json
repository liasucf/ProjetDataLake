Prior to the mid 18th century, most farmers in England rotated their crops across three or four strips of land- see Crop rotation, and \u2018rights of common\u2019- see common land were claimed for grazing the unfenced land. The Inclosures Acts of the 19th century proposed the inclosure of Elmstone-Hardwicke in 1899. However, many fields remained unfenced until 1918, which villagers believe make it the last village in England to be inclosed. Following the Inclosure, many poor farmers lost their common grazing rights, so in Elmstone-Hardwicke, a plot was set aside as a recreation ground for grazing of their animals, and a further for allotments.British History Online (http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383&strquery;=elmstone- hardwicke) Accessed on 17/2/10 These fields still exist, and although none of the current residents graze or cultivate the land as individuals, the Parish Council leases the land to a local farmer, and the money is reinvested into the community. The land in Elmstone-Hardwicke has been mainly used for arable farming over the years, and has had some interesting crops grown there including tobacco in the 17th Century!British History Online (http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383&strquery;=elmstone- hardwicke) Accessed on 17/2/10 More recently, from the early 20th century, teasel growing was established in the village, it continued until the 1960s, and is well remembered by some of the older inhabitants. The teasels were used in the textile industry to raise the nap on the cloth, but were superseded by nylon brushes.British History Online (http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383&strquery;=elmstone-hardwicke) Accessed on 17/2/10 Elmstone-Hardwicke is mentioned in the Domesday Book, where it is called Almundeston. As part of the Deerhurst Hundred, the land of the manor was held by radknights (free men), who ensured that the land was farmed for the Lord. In Elmstone, the named free man was Beorhtric, although it also states that it was held by Reinbald...The National Archives (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk) The first mention of Almundeston is, according to British History OnlineBritish History Online (http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383) in 889, when it was known as Almundingtoun, Hardwicke was noted in 1086, and the two parishes were first noted together in 1378. There are other interesting names in the locality: Low-di-low Lane is a No Through Road, which runs through the heart of the Village and marks the boundary between the parishes of Uckington and Elmstone- Hardwicke. Dog Bark Lane is a Restricted Byway which connects Elmstone- Hardwicke and its neighbour Swindon Village, and is regularly used by walkers, cyclists and horse-riders. It is believed to be named after the call of the male foxes who live along the route. Murder Meadow (or Murder Ground) belongs to one of the small-holdings in Elmstone-Hardwicke, but is in fact just over the boundary in Stoke Orchard. Although the name appears on the deeds from the early 19th century, no evidence has been found to substantiate the origins of the name, although local folklore suggests that it was a crime of passion and the murder was committed by a jealous husband! ==See also== *Knightsbridge ==References== ==External links== *GENUKI - UK & Ireland Genealogy - Elmstone Hardwicke *Elmstone Hardwicke Parish Church - includes a number of photos. *British History Online (http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383&strquery;=elmstone-hardwicke)Accessed on 17/2/10 *The National Archives (http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk) Accessed 23/3/10 * British History Online (http://www.british- history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=66383) Accessed 23/3/10 Category:Villages in Gloucestershire Category:Borough of Tewkesbury ",
