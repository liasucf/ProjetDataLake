The real treat here is Lucky Thompson's tenor sax. The Don Byas-influenced Thompson has a sound that invites the listener to luxuriate in its grace and strength\". ==Track listing== # \"Now's the Time\" (Charlie Parker) \u2013 8:16 # \"In a Sentimental Mood/Mood Indigo/Azure\" (Duke Ellington) \u2013 6:43 # \"Minor Conception\" (Milt Jackson) \u2013 8:36 # \"Soul in 3/4\" (Jackson) \u2013 6:40 ==Personnel== *Milt Jackson \u2013 vibraphone *Lucky Thompson \u2013 tenor saxophone *Hank Jones \u2013 piano *Wendell Marshall \u2013 bass *Kenny Clarke \u2013 drums == References == Category:Savoy Records albums Category:Milt Jackson albums Category:1956 albums Category:Albums recorded at Van Gelder Studio Category:Albums produced by Ozzie Cadena ",
