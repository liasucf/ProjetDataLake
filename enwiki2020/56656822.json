He was chosen in 1870 as the first pastor of St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church of Jacksonville, Florida. He also served in the Florida House of Representatives, representing Jacksonville, from 1868 to 1873 and again in 1879. He was a leading politician in Jacksonville during the Reconstruction Era and a member of the City Council; his group \"once [1872] had so many representatives in the city government that the entire form of government was changed by an executive act in Tallahassee\". In 1893, a photograph documents that he was the president of Edward Waters College. His son John R. Scott, Jr., earned a Bachelor of Divinity, was also a minister of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (and secretary of its conference, 1889), a member of the Florida Legislature, and a professor of homiletics (preaching) at Edward Waters College. == References == ==External links== * Category:African Methodist Episcopal Church clergy Category:Members of the Florida House of Representatives Category:Edward Waters College faculty Category:African-American politicians during the Reconstruction Era Category:History of Jacksonville, Florida Category:Politicians from Jacksonville, Florida Category:American slaves Category:1840s births Category:1929 deaths Category:African-American state legislators in Florida Category:Edward Waters College ",
