    "text": "Japaridze's polymodal logic (GLP), is a system of provability logic with infinitely many modal (provability) operators. This system has played an important role in some applications of provability algebras in proof theory, and has been extensively studied since the late 1980s. It is named after Giorgi Japaridze. == Language and axiomatization == The language of GLP extends that of the language of classical propositional logic by including the infinite series [0],[1],[2],... of \u201cnecessity\u201d operators. Their dual \u201cpossibility\u201d operators <0>,<1>,<2>,... are defined by p = \u00ac[n]\u00acp. The axioms of GLP are all classical tautologies and all formulas of one of the following forms: *[n](p \u2192 q) \u2192 ([n]p \u2192 [n]q) *[n]([n]p \u2192 p) \u2192 [n]p *[n]p \u2192 [n+1]p *p \u2192 [n+1]p And the rules of inference are: * From p and p \u2192 q conclude q * From p conclude [0]p == Provability semantics == Consider a \u201csufficiently strong\u201d first-order theory T such as Peano Arithmetic PA. Define the series T0,T1,T2,... of theories as follows: *T0 is T *Tn+1 is the extension of Tn through the additional axioms \u2200xF(x) for each formula F(x) such that Tn proves all of the formulas F(0),F(1),F(2),... For each n, let Prn(x) be a natural arithmetization of the predicate \u201cx is the G\u00f6del number of a sentence provable in Tn. A realization is a function * which sends each nonlogical atom a of the language of GLP to a sentence a * of the language of T. It extends to all formulas of the language of GLP by stipulating that * commutes with the Boolean connectives, and that ([n]F) * is Pr_n(\u2018F *\u2019), where \u2018F *\u2019 stands for the (numeral for) the G\u00f6del number of F *. An arithmetical completeness theoremG. Japaridze, \"The polymodal logic of provability\". Intensional Logics and Logical Structure of Theories. Metsniereba, Tbilisi, 1988, pp. 16\u201348 (Russian). for GLP states that a formula F is provable in GLP if and only if, for every interpretation *, the sentence F * is provable in T. The above understanding of the series T0,T1,T2,... of theories is not the only natural understanding yielding the soundness and completeness of GLP. For instance, each theory Tn can be understood as T augmented with all true \u220fn sentences as additional axioms. George Boolos showedG. Boolos, \"The analytical completeness of Japaridze's polymodal logics\". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 61 (1993), pp. 95\u2013111. that GLP remains sound and complete with analysis (second-order arithmetic) in the role of the base theory T. == Other semantics == GLP has been shown to be incomplete with respect to any class of Kripke frames. A natural topological semantics of GLP interprets modalities as derivative operators of a polytopological space. Such spaces are called GLP-spaces whenever they satisfy all the axioms of GLP. GLP is complete w.r.t. the class of all GLP-spaces.L. Beklemishev and D. Gabelaia, \u201cTopological completeness of provability logic GLP\u201d. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 164 (2013), pp. 1201\u20131223. == Computational complexity == The problem of being a theorem of GLP is PSPACE-complete. So is the same problem restricted to only variable- free formulas of GLP.F. Pakhomov, \u201cOn the complexity of the closed fragment of Japaridze's provability logic\u201d. Archive for Mathematical Logic 53 (2014), pp. 949\u2013967. == History == GLP, under the name GP, was introduced by Giorgi Japaridze in his PhD thesis \"Modal Logical Means of Investigating Provability\" (Moscow State University, 1986) and published two years later along with (a) the completeness theorem for GLP with respect to its provability interpretation (Beklemishev subsequently came up with a simpler proof of the same theoremL. Beklemishev, \u201cA simplified proof of arithmetical completeness theorem for provability logic GLP\u201d. Proceedings of the Steklov Institute of Mathematics 274 (2011), pp. 25\u201333.) and (b) a proof that Kripke frames for GLP do not exist. Beklemishev also conducted a more extensive study of Kripke models for GLP.L. Beklemishev, \u201cKripke semantics for provability logic GLP\u201d. Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 161, 756\u2013774 (2010). Topological models for GLP were studied by Beklemishev, Bezhanishvili, Icard and Gabelaia.L. Beklemishev, G. Bezhanishvili and T.

The decidability of GLP in polynomial space was proven by I. Shapirovsky,I. Shapirovsky, \"PSPACE-decidability of Japaridze's polymodal logic\". Advances in Modal Logic 7 (2008), pp. 289-304. and the PSPACE-hardness of its variable-free fragment was proven by F.Pakhomov. Among the most notable applications of GLP has been its use in proof-theoretically analyzing Peano arithmetic, elaborating a canonical way for recovering ordinal notation system up to 0 from the corresponding algebra, and constructing simple combinatorial independent statements (Beklemishev L. Beklemishev, \"Provability algebras and proof-theoretic ordinals, I\". Annals of Pure and Applied Logic 128 (2004), pp. 103\u2013123.). An extensive survey of GLP in the context of provability logics in general was given by George Boolos in his book \u201cThe Logic of Provability\u201d.G. Boolos, \u201cThe Logic of Provability\u201d.
