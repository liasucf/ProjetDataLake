    "text": "Greater Ministries International was an Evangelical Christian ministry that ran a Ponzi scheme taking nearly 500 million dollars from 18,000 people. Headed by Gerald Payne in Tampa, Florida, the ministry bribed church leaders around the United States. Payne and other church elders promised the church members double their money back in 17 months or fewer, citing Biblical scripture. However, nearly all the money was lost and hidden away. Church leaders received prison sentences ranging from twelve and half years to 27 years. The group had ties to Stayton, Oregon-based Embassy of Heaven, run by Glen Stoll, which was later closed by the Justice Department. Their group founded a newspaper, the \"Greater Bible College\" in Tampa, a line of \"Greater Live\" herbal remedies, cancer treatments (\"We actually pull the cancer right out of your stomach\", Payne claimed.), a supplement called \"Beta 1, 3rd Glucan\" (to survive \"end-times plagues\",) and plans for \"Greater Lands\", an independent country (an \"Ecclesiastical Domain ... similar to the Vatican\") where other governments would have no jurisdiction. ==References== ==External links== *www.greater-ministries.com (GMI former website archived) * IMDb listing for television show coverage on American Greed (Se3Ep12) ;Injunctions/press releases *Ohio Division of Securities Obtains Injunction, August 24, 1999 *Pennsylvania Injunction, 1999 *U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, February 19, 2002 ;Articles *Whitfield, David v.
