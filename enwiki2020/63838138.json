A covered bridge is considered authentic not due to its age, but by its construction. An authentic bridge is constructed using trusses rather than other methods such as stringers, a popular choice for non-authentic covered bridges. ==List== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Name ! class=unsortable |Image !
