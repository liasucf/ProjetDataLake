He goes back to his biological mother, who found out that he had beaten up the Weasel. ==Reception== On July 30, 1949, Boxoffice reviewed the short: \"Very Good. The so-called Wiley Weasel is flabbergasted when an egg he has stolen from a barnyard hen for his meal, hatches out a small chick. The chick mistakes the weasel for its mother and the rodent is forced to play the game. He tries, without success, to lure the chick into the roasting pan.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1943 films Category:1943 animated films Category:1940s American animated films Category:American films Category:Short films directed by Chuck Jones Category:Merrie Melodies shorts Category:Warner Bros.
