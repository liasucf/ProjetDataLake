    "text": "The Pac-12 Conference Women's Basketball Tournament, otherwise known as the Pac-12 Tournament, is the annual concluding tournament for the NCAA women's college basketball in the Pac-12. After a six-year run at KeyArena in Seattle from 2013 to 2018, the tournament moved to Las Vegas, already the location for the Pac-12 men's tournament, for at least 2019 and 2020, due to the closure of KeyArena for major renovations to accommodate the Seattle Kraken. Seeding is based on regular season records. The Tournament has been held every year since 2002. On March 5, 2016, the Pac-12 announced that it had agreed to extend its contract to keep the women's tournament in Seattle until 2019. However, the conference ended the contract a season early, moving the women's tournament to Las Vegas for 2019 and 2020 because KeyArena was slated for a major two-year renovation and upgrade. The 2019 tournament was held at MGM Grand Garden Arena, and the 2020 edition was at Mandalay Bay Events Center. ==Champions== Tournament champions receive an automatic bid to the year's NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament. Numbers in parentheses refer to each team's finish/seed in the tournament for that year. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !Year !!Champion !!Runner-up !! Location !!
