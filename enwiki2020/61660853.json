It is set on Fire Island and follows the story of a gay attorney who is drugged and robbed while visiting the island and tries to return home after witnessing a murder. It received a Jury Award for Best US Feature at the 2019 NCGLFF. ==Plot== The screenplay was inspired in part by the 2016 horror film The Wailing and the 2013 gay mystery Stranger by the Lake. The story centers around a young lawyer from Manhattan named Joseph who takes a trip to Fire Island in search of a good time. He finds the island is in the off-season without many guys around. He meets a stranger who winds up drugging and robbing him. While partially unconscious, Joseph witnesses a murder and narrowly escapes being killed himself. He wakes up in the care of a local named Cameron whom he later falls for, forgetting about the murder while the murderer reemerges among Cameron's friends. ==Cast== * Ramon O. Torres as Joseph * Myles Clohessy as Rafael * Sheldon Best as Cameron * Gabriel Sloyer as Dr. Anabi * R. Ward Duffy as Richard ==Reception== Last Ferry has screened at numerous film festivals.

As of spring 2020, the movie is available on Netflix (US). The film received mixed reviews from critics, with many noting its failure to explore some of the deeper themes and minor storylines presented. Robert Levin at Newsday noted that the film was a clich\u00e9 of its genre, stating \"It\u2019s formulaic and pedestrian when it should be treading mysterious psychological depths\", but also said that viewers would not feel \"cheated\" if they did watch the film. Almost all reviews praised the film's cinematography and atmosphere. Dylan Andresen at Film Threat said that the film's cinematography was \"top-notch, on par with anything I\u2019ve seen recently in theaters\". ==References== ==External links== * Last Ferry movie website * Last Ferry on IMDb * Last Ferry on Netflix Category:2019 films Category:American LGBT-related films Category:English-language films Category:American mystery films Category:American films Category:LGBT-related thriller films Category:2019 LGBT-related films Category:2010s mystery films ",
