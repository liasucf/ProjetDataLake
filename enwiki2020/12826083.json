    "text": "\"Homosapien\" is a song by English musician Pete Shelley. It was the first single from his album of the same title, released in 1981, and his first single as a solo performer after rising to fame with Buzzcocks. Shelley wrote the song in 1974, before forming the Buzzcocks in 1976.McGartland 9. Originally intended as a demo track for a Buzzcocks' song, \"Homosapien\" was recorded in one day with producer Martin Rushent, who would later go on to produce The Human League.Tennant, vi The track adopted a more synth pop sound in contrast to the Buzzcocks' harsh guitar riffs. The single was a big hit in Australia and Canada, reaching the Top 10 in both territories, as well as being a modest hit in New Zealand. Although it failed to crossover to singles charts, it was a popular dance track in clubs across Europe and the United States and reached number 14 on the Billboard Club Play Singles chart. The song was banned by the BBC for its \"explicit reference to gay sex\" with the lyrics \"homo superior / in my interior\". Shelley denied this was the intention.Hilderbrand 429. ==Lyrics== Lucas Hilderbrand, a professor at UC Irvine, sees \"Homosapien\" as a \"curious pride anthem\" that never uses the word \"gay\" in its lyrics,Hilderbrand 417. much like other tracks by queer artists from the time, for example Soft Cell's \"Tainted Love\" and Queen and David Bowie's \"Under Pressure\". Hilderbrand interprets the verse \"and I just hope and pray / that the day / of our love is at hand... / And the world is so wrong / that I hope that we'll be strong...\" as a message of solidarity against homophobia.Hilderbrand 428. Further, Hilderbrand reads \"I don't wanna classify you like an animal in the zoo / But it seems good to me to know that you're Homosapien, too\" as a statement on \"refusing and then reconfirming identity categories\", proclaiming a hope for gay rights but rejecting an \"essentialist\" label such as homosexual or gay. ==Impact== Since its release, \"Homosapien\" has been a popular LGBT anthem, and was a gay club hit at the time it came out. Hilderbrand has described \"Homosapien\" as the \"most homo- positive hit of\" 1981.Hilderbrand 415. ==Chart positions== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Charts (1981-1982) !Peak position |- |Australia (Kent Music Report) |align=\"center\"|4 |- |Canada Top Singles (RPM) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|6 |- |New Zealand Top 40 (Official New Zealand Music Chart) | style=\"text-align:center;\"|11 |} == References == ===Sources=== * * * Category:1981 debut singles Category:LGBT-related songs Category:Songs written by Pete Shelley Category:1981 songs Category:Song recordings produced by Martin Rushent Category:Island Records singles ",
