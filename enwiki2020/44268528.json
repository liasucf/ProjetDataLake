    "text": "Central Coast Mariners Football Club is an Australian professional football club based in Gosford, on the Central Coast of New South Wales. The first Asian football match played by the Mariners was against Pohang Steelers on 11 March 2009. They have since participated in the AFC Champions League on four occasions, organised by the Asian Football Confederation. The team has made the knockout stage of Asian competition once (2013). Qualification for Asian club competitions is determined by a team's position in the domestic league. The winners of the A-League Premiership (regular season) and Championship (finals series) have always qualified, with the next-best team(s) in the A-League regular season occasionally receiving a place. John Hutchinson holds the club record for most appearances with 24. Adam Kwasnik is the club's record goalscorer in Asian football with three goals. The Mariners' biggest winning margin in Asia is a 5\u20131 scoreline, this was achieved at home against Tianjin Teda in the 2012 AFC Champions League. ==History== Adrian Caceres was the first Mariners player to score in Asian competition. ===2009 AFC Champions League=== The Mariners qualified for the 2009 AFC Champions League after finishing first in the 2007\u201308 A-League regular season. They played their first ever match in Asia against K-League side Pohang Steelers, finishing in a scoreless draw at Central Coast Stadium. In the next match, against Tianjin Teda, Adrian Caceres became the club's first ever goalscorer in Asian football when he deflected a shot from Shane Huke into the goal; the match finished in a 2-all draw. After picking up two points from their first two games, the team had a run of four consecutive losses which saw them eliminated in the group stage. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Season ! Competition !
