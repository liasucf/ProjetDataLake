    "text": "Bilecik HSR station, short for Bileck High Speed Rail station, ( short for Bilecik Y\u00fcksek H\u0131zl\u0131 Tren gar\u0131) is a railway station on the Ankara\u2013Istanbul high-speed railway just east of Bilecik, Turkey. The station opened on 1 June 2015, almost a year after the opening of the Eski\u015fehir-Istanbul portion of the high-speed railway, and is for the moment one of three railway station in Turkey dedicated to high-speed rail. Bilecik YHT has the same layout as the Polatl\u0131 YHT railway station; two tracks served by two side platforms and two passing tracks in the middle, as all scheduled YHT trains do not stop at Bilecik. Prior to the opening of the high-speed railway, the now indefinitely closed Bilecik station, located south of the town and the YHT station, was serviced by many trains running from Istanbul to Ankara and points beyond. The railway station is expected to re-open to passenger traffic, once the construction of the Marmaray commuter rail system in Istanbul is finished and Intercity train services resume. ==Station Layout== ==External links== *Bilecik YHT station information Category:Railway stations in Bilecik Province Category:High-speed railway stations in Turkey Category:Bilecik Central District Category:Transport in Bilecik Province Category:Railway stations opened in 2015 Category:2015 establishments in Turkey Category:Buildings and structures in Bilecik Province ",
