Developed in Russia by Eagle Dynamics and published by Strategic Simulations, Inc (SSI), the game takes part in Crimea and allows players to fly the SU-27 aircraft in various combat roles. The game also includes a mission editor, allowing the player to create custom gameplay scenarios. The Windows 95 version was released first, with the DOS version being developed later. ==Version history== * Su-27 Flanker: released 1995 * Su-27 Flanker Mission Disk: released 1997 * Su-27 Flanker: Squadron Commander's Edition: released 1997, compilation that includes the main game and expansion * Flanker 2.0: released 1999 * Flanker 2.5: released March 26, 2002, released as free patch download in 2001 for Flanker 2.0 * Lock On: Modern Air Combat: Although not technically a sequel, it is regarded by many to be.

He concluded that serious flight sim enthusiasts should consider getting the game for its \"unsurpassed\" realistic modeling of the Su-27, but that anyone else would be completely lost. He scored it two out of five stars. Su-27 Flanker was a runner-up for Computer Gaming Worlds 1995 \"Simulation of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to EF2000. The editors wrote that Su-27 Flanker features \"an astonishing variety of allies and targets in the air and on the ground, as well as extremely challenging computer pilot AI.\" PC Gamer US nominated Flanker 2.0 for its 1999 \"Best Simulation\" award, but it lost to MiG Alley. The editors wrote that Flanker 2.0 is \"not everyone's cup of tea, and even veteran simmers find it a challenge to master every vagary of the Su-27. But for sheer authenticity, it can't be topped.\" In the United States, Flanker 2.0 sold 7,285 copies by April 2000. ==References== ==External links== * * Eagle Dynamics * Gamespot.com's review of Su-27 Flanker Category:1995 video games Category:Combat flight simulators Category:DOS games Category:Strategic Simulations games Category:Video games developed in Russia Category:Video games with expansion packs Category:Windows games Category:Works set in the Crimea ",
