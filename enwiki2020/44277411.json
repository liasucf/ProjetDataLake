Among the attendees were Christina Milian, Mario Lopez, Ryan Seacrest, Katy Tiz, Bleona, Oscar De La Hoya, Dascha Polanco and Selenis Leyva. A free pre-event concert called \"La Villita\" was held in the Forum parking lot before the show, featuring Taboo from the Black Eyed Peas, Becky G and Voz a Voz. Ricky Martin opened the show and Pitbull closed the show. Pitbull then hosted and performed at the 2014 American Music Awards the following evening. August Brown, writing in the Los Angeles Times, said the show represented the dual interests of the young Latino audience. Some of the acts were \"cosmopolitan, combining American hip- hop and R&B;, European techno and the hip-swinging rhythms of the Spanish- speaking world,\" while others were\"foundational acts in Latin popular and regional music.\" Ramon Gonzales, for the Orange County Register, wrote that the five-hour festival \"did a remarkable job of tending to the nuances under the umbrella of Latin music and featured a multitude of subgenres\". He described that Martin whipped the crowd into such a frenzy, it allowed him to walk offstage almost as if to suggest, \"Top that\", then said the audience \"had the pleasure of watching the collective bill impressively attempt just that\". Gonzales described Alejandra Guzman getting the evening's photo op concluding \"Hacer el Amor Con Otro\" amid a shower of confetti. La Banda Original El Limon had the entire house singing the traditional \"Cielito Lindo\" while \"Pitbull emerged as the evening\u2019s triumphant headliner, proving just why he is considered the most bankable star in the Latin urban crossover market\". ==2015 event== On May 13, 2015, iHeartMedia announced that the 2015 event will be held on Saturday, November 7, 2015 at the American Airlines Arena in Miami and will be broadcast live on Yahoo! Live and on iHeartMedia-owned Spanish-Pop, Tropical, regional Mexican and Spanish Adult Hit radio stations across the U.S., as well as a special broadcast on the Spanish-language network Telemundo. ==2014 line-up== * Ricky Martin * Pitbull * Daddy Yankee * Prince Royce * Roberto Tapia * Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n * La Original Banda el Lim\u00f3n feat.
