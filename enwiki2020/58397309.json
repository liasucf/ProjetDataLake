The members consisted of Sonim, who was the group's lead vocalist, and Yuki, who was the group's rapper. == History == ===Pre-debut=== In 1999, three teenagers were scouted by Harmony Promotion and were assigned to a group under the name \"EE Jump\", a pun of the Japanese phrase . The group's music was produced by Tsunku. Sonim was scouted as the group's lead vocalist; Yuki Goto, the younger brother of Maki Goto, was scouted by an agency while at one of his sister's events and became the group's rapper. Half-Canadian, half-Japanese Ken was assigned the group's dancer. The trio made their first television appearance on Warau Inu no B\u014dken to perform a dance routine. Shortly before their CD debut, Ken left the agency. ===2000-2001: Beginnings=== EE Jump released their debut single, \"Love is Energy!\", on October 18, 2000, which served as the theme song for Warau Inu no B\u014dken. The music video was filmed in Manhattan, New York. Their single was followed up by \"Hello! Atarashii Watashi\" on January 24, 2001. Their third single, \"Otto Totto Natsu da ze!\", was released on May 16, 2001 as the theme song for Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ. The song became a summer hit, charting at #5 on Oricon. EE Jump also had their own weekly radio show on Mondays, titled . EE Jump's fourth single, \"Iki na Rhythm!\", was released on August 29, 2001. However, during the single's promotions, Yuki had an argument with the group's female manager over their crowded work schedules, which led to him physically assaulting her, checking out of his hotel room without permission, and fleeing to Tochigi Prefecture. In response, chief manager Kaoru Wada suspended his activities for three months. During this time, Sonim continued activities without him, releasing their fifth single, \"Winter (Samui Kisetsu no Monogatari)\", on November 28, 2001 under the name \"EE Jump featuring Sonim.\" ===2002: Disbandment=== In February 2002, Yuki eventually rejoined the group after releasing an apology, and EE Jump released their sixth single, \"Seishun no Sunrise\", on March 6, 2002. Shortly after graduating middle school, he was photographed by tabloid magazine Friday at a cabaret club drinking alcohol while underage with a member of Johnny's Jr. Wada warned Yuki to keep his personal life private, but after Yuki refused, Wada and Tsunku agreed to revoke his contract in April 2002. EE Jump's first album, titled EE Jump Collection 1, was scheduled for release on May 9, 2002, but it was cancelled upon his dismissal. Sonim resumed activities without him, and the EE Jump name became defunct, with the agency removing any mention of Yuki from their website. ==Members== * * == Discography == === Studio albums === {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Title !rowspan=\"2\"| Year !rowspan=\"2\"| Details !colspan=\"1\"| Peak chart positions !rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:10em;\"| Sales |- !width=\"30\"|JPN |- ! scope=\"row\"| | 2002 | * Released: May 9, 2002 (cancelled) * Label: Toy's Factory * Formats: CD | -- | -- |- | colspan=\"5\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region. |} ===Singles=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" border=\"1\" ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:16em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:2em;\"| Year ! scope=\"col\" colspan=\"1\"| Peak position ! scope=\"col\" rowspan=\"2\" style=\"width:12em;\"| Sales |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:3em;font-size:90%;\"|JPN |- ! scope=\"row\" |\"Love is Energy!\" | 2000 | 18 | *JPN: 50,950 |- ! scope=\"row\" | | rowspan=\"4\" | 2001 | 17 | *JPN: 54,880 |- ! scope=\"row\" | | 5 | *JPN: 188,820 |- ! scope=\"row\" | | 14 | *JPN: 45,880 |- ! scope=\"row\" | | 10 | *JPN: 65,690 |- ! scope=\"row\" | | 2002 | 12 | *JPN: 59,410 |- | colspan=\"4\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"| \"\u2014\" denotes releases that did not chart or were not released in that region. |} == References == Category:Musical groups established in 2000 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2002 Category:Japanese idol groups ",
