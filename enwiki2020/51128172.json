    "text": "Minister for Emergency Services is a position in the government of Western Australia, currently held by Fran Logan of the Labor Party. A separate emergency services portfolio was first created in 1982, for the government of Ray O'Connor. It has often been held by the Minister of Police, and on two occasions (from 1983 to 1990 and from 2001 to 2008) the two portfolios were merged under a single Minister for Police and Emergency Services. The current minister is responsible for the state government's Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES). ==Titles== * 25 January 1982 \u2013 present: Minister for Emergency Services ==List of ministers== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !
