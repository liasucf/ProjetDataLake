    "text": "Pandanus multispicatus (Vakwa de Montanny) is a species of plant in the family Pandanaceae, one of several Pandanus species that are endemic to the Seychelles. ==Description== This is the only Pandanus of Seychelles that does not become a tree, but rather grows as a low (max 4 meters high), sprawling shrub, the thin stems often lying decumbent along the ground. The fruit bodies resemble corn cobs. Each contains 200-400 individual fruit segments, and several fruit bodies are born together on a stalk. ==Distribution and habitat== It grows mainly in rocky areas and was previously very common in the higher mountains of Seychelles (the reason for its local name, \"Vakwa de Montanny\"). Formerly widespread, it is currently restricted to only eight small and isolated populations. Other indigenous Pandanus of the Seychelles include Pandanus sechellarum, Pandanus hornei and Pandanus balfourii. The Madagascan species Pandanus utilis is introduced and is now also widespread. ==References== Category:Flora of Seychelles multispicatus Category:Vulnerable plants Category:Endemic flora of Seychelles Category:Taxonomy articles created by Polbot Category:Taxa named by Isaac Bayley Balfour ",
