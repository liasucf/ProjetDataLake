The character of Simple Simon may have been in circulation much longer, possibly appearing in an Elizabethan chapbook and in a ballad, Simple Simon's Misfortunes and his Wife Margery's Cruelty, from about 1685. Another possible inspiration was Simon Edy, a beggar in the St Giles area in the 18th century. ==Notes== ==External links== *A page containing the full text of the rhyme Category:Roud Folk Song Index songs Category:Year of song unknown Category:Chapbooks Category:English nursery rhymes Category:English folk songs Category:English children's songs Category:Traditional children's songs Category:Songs about fictional male characters ",
