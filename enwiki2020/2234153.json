Saskatchewan Sports Hall of Fame, 1997, p.368. Hazlet has had great senior teams such as the Hazlet Blackhawks of the 1930s and 1940s and the Hazlet Elks of the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The earliest record of an organized team is in 1935, but baseball was being played in and around Hazlet much earlier than that. In 1938 the team won 57 out of 64 games and won 9 tournaments including their own. That year 6 players had batting averages over .400. The coach, Budd Lewis did not give credit for a hit unless it was well deserved, so it stands to reason that the averages may have been even higher by today's rules. Hazlet also had great women's teams such as the Hazlet Hornets Ball team. Hazlet continued to have a women's team until the 1990s. Minor baseball has always been popular, and kids still play baseball and slo-pitch today. Without the development of these young players, Hazlet would not have been able to dominate the South River Baseball League as they did in the 1970s and early 1980s, winning several league championships. The community of Hazlet was inducted into the Saskatchewan Baseball Hall of Fame at a ceremony on August 17, 2013 in Battleford, Saskatchewan. ===Hazlet Elks=== The Hazlet Elks were a senior baseball team that played in Hazlet until 1993. From 1982 to 1993 they played in the Saskatchewan Major Baseball League.

The team finished last in the league that year, and it was obvious that they would have to work their way up from the bottom.\"Liner Batters Feast on Elks\" Saskatoon Star-Phoenix, Saskatoon, June 7, 1982. Retrieved on February 21, 2012 The team was not discouraged because the final playoff pairings were not decided until the very last day of the schedule. In 1983 and 1984 they lost in the league final. It was in 1987 the Elks won their first league championship by defeating the Kindersley Royals. The Hazlet Elks went on to three-peat as SMBL champions by taking the league title in 1987, 1988, and 1989. The achievements of this team were notable as the population of Hazlet was around 125 people. It was truly a community effort to make the team viable. An executive of 14 members helped co-ordinate volunteer hours by themselves and others in the community. Among these were Vince Akre, Don Anderson, Terry Bailey, Bill Boss, Peter Buchanan, Donnie Knutson, Harvey McIntosh, Sandy Starkey, Barry Stock, Mark Stock, Lyle Thoreson, and Donnie Zinn. Larry English was the general manager. They were competing against cities and towns in Saskatchewan that were several times the population of Hazlet.

Larry English was the scout for the Elks, and also had a career as a scout for the Minnesota Twins for 5 years. Because of the small population of Hazlet, the team was allowed to have four American imports on their roster. It was partly because of these imports that Hazlet was able to remain competitive, even against larger centres in the league.\"Important Role Played by Americans\" Leader Post, Regina, August 8, 1986.

Those appointed were Leslie Colter, Rudolph Stock, Frank Dyball, John H. Boyer, Arthur E. Todd, Percy Pyne, Charles W. Perry, Charles J. Herriott, William T. Vilness, Ralph S. Bingham, John Munt, Joseph F. McAdam, Walter Weedon, Edward I. Olson, and Oscar A. Sannes, with J. H. Boyer as Secretary. Branch 202 was re-organized in 1946, and the charter members were Frank McAdam, Leslie Colter, Owen Olsgard, Orland Robertson, George Bell, John McIver and W. J. Burak. The first recorded meeting was on November 5, 1946 in the McCabe grain elevator office with President Owen Olsgard, Secretary/Treasurer Frank McAdam and eight members present. The first project was a dance on May 30, 1947 with net proceeds of $29.18. The attention then turned to the construction of a monument to servicemen from Hazlet and area who had made the supreme sacrifice. The monument was completed in 1948 and still stands today on Railway Street in Hazlet, bearing the following names: F/O T.R. Bailey, D.F.C. Sgt. A/G M.A. Lowick, Sgt. AG/W.N. Partridge, Sgt. A/G D.L. Robertson and Pte. R. Shiels. In 1948, the Legion formed a softball team and actively supported a ladies\u2019 team. The Legion teams existed for several years and each year held a sports day tournament. A meeting place for the Legion was a problem, so in 1949, a clubroom was set up in the basement of the Community Hall. This was used as the meeting place until August 1950, when Maurice Akre offered the use of his poolroom. This continued as their meeting place for seven years, with free use of the pool tables included. The first annual dance for the Branch was on October 26, 1951. Admission was 50 cents per person; the orchestra fee was $55.00, hall rent of $15.00, and the net profit for the evening was $4.00. Other firsts for the Branch are: first annual Legion bonspiel on March 3, 1954; first entry to the Legion Curling playoffs in 1955; first Legion carnival in 1957; first turkey bingo in 1957; and first annual Legion deep-pit barbecue in 1966. The carnivals were held annually for seven years while turkey bingos continued for thirteen years. The deep-pit barbecues reached twenty years annually in 1985. The barbecue in 1978, which was Hazlet\u2019s 50th Anniversary year, had the largest attendance, catering to approximately 1100 people in one hour. In 1956, they purchased the Trent School for $3.00. A concrete basement was poured on November 10, 1956, and we had the first meeting on February 14, 1957, in their own Legion Hall. In 2004, the Hazlet Legion made the decision to close the Legion Hall due to the increasing costs of maintaining it, and the limited use of the building. Meetings are now held in the local Caf\u00e9. In 2005, the Hazlet Ladies\u2019 Auxiliary joined the Legion to bring their experience and much welcomed comradeship to Hazlet Branch\u2019s small, but proud group.http://sasklegion.ca/military-service-recognition-book/ ===Hazlet Lions Club=== The Hazlet Lions Club has been a cornerstone of public service to Hazlet and the surrounding community for generations. The Lions club has supported numerous activities over the years including the Sandhills Relay, Youth Exchange students, dances, parades, pancake breakfasts, cabarets, curling, and other sporting events. They have sponsored numerous sports teams and youth activities in the community. ===UCAL Women's Group=== The United Catholic Anglican Lutheran Church women's group has supported events in Hazlet for generations. They have frequently supported fundraising events, teas, bake sales, trade shows, community gatherings and Bingo's. ==Medicare== Hazlet was a world pioneer in providing universal healthcare. In 1944 The Swift Current area was slated to be the demonstration unit for preventive medicine. The RM of Pittville at Hazlet already had a health scheme, devised by William J. Burak, whereby its residents received both medical and hospital care for just under $11 per person per year. Wishing to add the Pittville method of full medical care to the preventive program planned for the southwest, Burak wrote at his own expense to each municipality, town and village, visited each weekly newspaper editor, and called a public meeting to press for a full medical and hospital plan. When a vote of all ratepayers was held on November 26, 1945, a majority voted in favour of a full regional health plan. The Saskatchewan government, manoeuvred by Burak into initiating a more comprehensive scheme than the preventive medicine program it had planned, passed an Order-in- Council on December 11. The region's hospitalization and health care scheme took effect on July 1, 1946\u2014a full two years before Great Britain's \"cradle to the grave\" health care plan was implemented. Within the Swift Current Health Region (Saskatchewan's Health Region #1) the residents felt empowered, and the region assembled statistical data on the costs of health care that were unrivalled in Canada. The regional scheme flowered when Dr. Vince Matthews, the public health officer, provided seamless integration of preventive work and medical care, a first in Canada. There was a high level of rapport between the local administration, the constituent municipalities, patients, and physicians: Stewart Robertson, the administrator, Dr. Vince Matthews, and Dr. Cas Wolan, president of the district medical association, met informally most days for coffee. In 1951, Swift Current created the first regional hospital board in Canada. ==Wind power== In 2009 the community of Hazlet undertook a project to create the first wind powered recreation complex in Canada. ==Attractions== ===Standing Rock=== Standing Rock is a large glacial erratic left from the last ice age around 14,000 years ago. It is composed of granite from the Hudson Bay area and is 3.35 metres high and 9.14 metres long . It is about 6 kilometres west of Hazlet. It was used as a landmark by early settlers, and as a scratching post for bison for centuries. It is a historical site today. ===Hazlet Regional Park=== In the spring of 1960 a committee was formed to look into the idea of forming a regional park at the Hazlet Dam. Regional Park status was applied for and was received in the fall of 1960Hazlet and Its Heritage \"Hazlet Regional Park\" Hazlet, Saskatchewan, Hazlet Historical Society 1987. Retrieved March 11, 2012. making it one of the original Regional Parks in the province. In 1961 the first trees were planted followed by playground equipment, a cookhouse, benches and a golf course. Later a tennis court and electric campsites were added. ===Hazlet Rink=== The community rink complex is one of the most used facilities in town. Home of the curling rink, skating rink, and lounge, the building is used not only in the winter, but all year round. During the winter, there is always a different curling tournament, from ladies, to mixed, to even high school tournaments and regional curling. The skating part is used everyday in the winter, as there is power skating, skating lessons, public skating, and hockey games for all ages. The lounge is the newest addition to the complex.http://hazletsk.ca/hazlet- and-its-heritage/ ===Hazlet Community Hall=== The community hall in Hazlet is a great size, and is used for all kinds of events. It is home to the Sandhills Players, where they use it for plays and dinner theatres. The hall is also used all year round for any events such dances, concerts, suppers, gatherings and fundraisers. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Villages in Saskatchewan Category:Pittville No. 169, Saskatchewan Category:Division No. 8, Saskatchewan ",
