    "text": "Igor Ciel (April 13, 1931, Ro\u017e\u0148ava \u2013 July 4, 2010, Bratislava) was a Slovakian movie and theatre play director, screenwriter, actor and pedagogue. == Biography == He was born in Ro\u017e\u0148ava, however he lived and studied in Brezno since childhood. While studying on a grammar school, he attended the theatre club of Janko Chalupka, where he first found his interest in theatre. His mother was an actress in amateur theatre and tried to help him during his early years. His interest in theatre continued further into his life, which prompted him to apply to the Academy of Performing Arts in Bratislava (V\u0160MU), where he wanted to study for the role of a director of theatrical plays. However, he was not accepted and instead studied science and aesthetics of theatre on the Commenius University in Bratislava. After graduating, he again applied for the same course at the Academy and was finally accepted. Acting lessons were taught by Andrej Bagar, while he received director lessons from Jozef Budsk\u00fd. He gained attention by directing the androcentric play Oil tanker, by Herb Tank, at the Youth theatre on Dunajsk\u00e1 street. Due to the recommendation by his professors, he later went to study on a theatrical vocational school in Moscow (Russian Institute of Theatre Arts - GITIS), where he expanded his knowledge of theatre by studying prominent artists. After returning in 1955, he finished his studies together with Pavol Haspra and Oto Katu\u0161. After finishing school, rather than directing plays, he became a radio announcer. He started directing plays in Zvolen (1955 \u2013 1959) and later in Nitra (1960 \u2013 1966). With the exception of the Peter Jelmnick\u00fd theatre in \u017dilina, Ciel worked in all non-Bratislava theatrical ensembles. After leaving Nitra in 1966, he started working as a director in the Czechoslovak Television in Bratislava. He worked in the chief editorial office of the literary- dramatic department, where he mainly focused on the adaptation of both Slovak and foreign authors. He is one of the creators of the famous, and popular, \"Bratislava Mondays\". While working on his projects, he worked with some of the most important and best-known Slovakian actors and actresses, such as: Vlado M\u00fcller, Jozef Kroner, \u0160tefan Kvietik, Ladislav Chud\u00edk, Karol Machata, Michal Do\u010dolomansk\u00fd, Jozef Adamovi\u010d, Bo\u017eidara Turzonovov\u00e1, Zdena Studenkov\u00e1, Em\u00edlia V\u00e1\u0161\u00e1ryov\u00e1, Zdena Gruberov\u00e1, Magda Pavelekov\u00e1, Kamila Mag\u00e1lov\u00e1 etc. He is also famous for always working with the same staff. His main cameraman was Mari\u00e1n Min\u00e1rik, the main costumer designer was Milan \u010corba, the art was done by Ladislav Hupka, music composed by Jarom\u00edr Dlouh\u00fd and editing by Ladislav Halama. He filmed more than one hundred and forty titles, not limited to movies, but also TV series, performances and a few documentaries. However, the most popular series among the audience, are The Mohicans of Paris (1971), Vivat Benyovszky! (1975), Louis Pasteur (1977) and Barbora R\u00f6ssel (1979). For many years, he also taught at the Academy of Performing Arts. He worked at the faculty of theatre until 1962, but he became the head of the Department of television directing after its opening in 1974. During the academic year 1985/86, the department was renamed to the Department of movie and television directing, and Igor Ciel was replaced by director Stanislav P\u00e1rnick\u00fd. In 1981 Ciel attained the title of Associate Professor and by the end of 1989 became a professor. In 1990 he was present at the formation of the Movie and television faculty at V\u0160MU, where he started as the only professor and for a couple of years served as its sub-dean. In the 1990s he also figured on the board of the Slovak television and served as its chairman in 1993. Towards the end of the old, and beginning of the new century, he also taught at the Academy of arts in Bansk\u00e1 Bystrica (1998\u20132003). Ciel wasn't just a director and teacher, but also an actor. He debuted in 1958 in the fiction film The last home-coming directed by Franti\u0161ek Kudl\u00e1\u010d. Later he also appeared in various theatrical plays, such as Romeo and Juliet, Unheard gunshot, Key owners. In 1956 he married the actress Al\u017ebeta Pol\u00e1\u010dkov\u00e1, whom he worked with on various theatrical plays, such as House of Bernarda Alba, Enemies, Guest, but also television movies, such as Hatred, Steel workers, Toreador. They have two kids together, Hana and Martin. Hana studied dramaturgy and screenwriting on the FAMU (Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague) and worked with Igor on many television movies e.g. Magma, Foreplay and I'll die tomorrow anyway. Martin studied film and theatre science on V\u0160MU in Bratislava, where he works as an Associate Professor on the Department of audiovisual studies. Igor and Martin performed together in the year 2000 in the television movie Calm after the storm. Igor Ciel lost his fight against a serious illness on the 4th of July in 2010. == Work characteristics == In the 1960s his work was mainly focused on television performances, in the 70s on television series, in the 80s television movies and in the 90s a return to television performances. In his work, we can see a significant focus on psychological and social drama (e.g. Jubel's children, Goodbye), comedies (e.g. Advertised marriage, Appendix transplant), detective stories (e.g. Sea mystery, Killer), but also historical and adventure movies and series (e.g. Two-headed eagle, Vivat Benyovszky!, Barbora R\u00f6ssel). His work also includes several movies about the 2nd World War (e.g. Loveless game, Seven from the town hall, Strange circumstances). He is also known for the adaptation of both Slovak and foreign authors, and playfully changing the contexts of their works. Ciel made several movies with a Hungarian theme, based on books by Hungarian authors (e.g. Ossa Sepia, Culprit's memories). He also filmed two movies directly in Hungary \u2013 A t\u00e9ved\u00e9s joga / Right to error (1982) and Szonatina egy p\u00e1v\u00e1\u00e9rt / Sonata for a peacock (1990). His movies usually follow a linear plot, with the occasional use of a retrospective. He doesn't use many symbols or metaphors. However, in some works there is an obvious effort when it comes to the attempt of showcasing a philosophical meaning, or social commentary portrayed through satire. This tendency is quite visible, for example, in his older plays from the 1950s, such as: It started in the Museum (1956) or Restless youth (1957). == Television production == (Note: Years of release and titles are in alphabetical order) {| class=\"wikitable\" |Year | Original Title | English Title | Motif | Genre | Country |- |1962 |Hra bez l\u00e1sky |Loveless game |An adaptation of a namesake play by \u0160tefan Kr\u00e1lik |War drama |CSSR |- |1963 |\u010co f\u00edge\u013e, to gro\u0161 |A coin for a trick |Based on the script by Rudolf Les\u0148\u00e1k |Comedy |CSSR |- |1963 |Toreador |Toreador |Adaptation of the Spanish playwright Alfonso Sastre |Drama |CSSR |- |1964 |Nen\u00e1vis\u0165 |Hatred |Adaptation of a short story by Vladim\u00edr Min\u00e1\u010d |Drama |CSSR |- |1964 |Pr\u00edpad Dezinger |Case Designer |Script: Bed\u0159ich Becher, Jeron\u00fdm Gregor |Detective |CSSR |- |1965 |\u013do\u0161ka zlodej |Thief \u013do\u0161ka |Adaptation of the novel by Yuri German My Friend Ivan Lapshin |Drama |CSSR |- |1965 |Zuniaci krok |Loud steps |Television staging of a namesake novel by Peter Jilemnick\u00fd |Social drama |CSSR |- |1966 |\u010ces\u0165 |Honour |Adaptation of a humorous short story by Ladislav N\u00e1da\u0161i-J\u00e9g\u00e9 |War comedy |CSSR |- |1966 |Gangstri v na\u0161om meste |Gangsters in our city |Adaptation of the play Gansters from Valencia by Wolfgang Ebert |Satire |CSSR |- |1966 |Kr\u00e1ska a v\u00fdlet |Beauty and the trip |Adaptation of a namesake short story by J\u00e1n Johanides |Social drama |CSSR |- |1966 |Mamka P\u00f4stkov\u00e1 |Mommy Fastie |Adaptation of a namesake short story by Jozef Gregor Tajovsk\u00fd |Social drama |CSSR |- |1966 |V ag\u00f3nii |In agony |Adaptation of a play by the Croatian playwright Miroslav Krle\u017ea |Psychological drama |CSSR |- |1967 |R\u00e1zcestie |Crossroads |Staging of a drama by J\u00e1n K\u00e1ko\u0161: A junction on every path |Drama |CSSR |- |1967 |Villon; Spor o b\u00e1snika |Villon, A dispute over a poet |Biographical play based on a script by Peter \u0160ev\u010dovi\u010d |Historical drama |CSSR |- |1967 |Zhasnut\u00e9 slnko |The Sun Died Down |Biographical play based on a script by J\u00e1n Solov\u010d |Drama |CSSR |- |1967 |\u017dena |Woman |Adaptation of a namesake short story by \u013dudmila Podjavorinsk\u00e1 |Social drama |CSSR |- |1968 |\u010cas nevinn\u00fdch |Time of innocence |Adaptation of a namesake play by Siegfried Lenz |Social drama |CSSR |- |1968 |Koloto\u010d |Carousel |Television play based on a script by Jozef Ruttkay |Psychological drama |CSSR |- |1968 |Koniec a za\u010diatok |An end and a beginning |Television play by Roman Rjachovsk\u00fd |Political drama (temporarily banned) |CSSR |- |1968 |\u013dubica - medvedica |The bear \u013dubica |Based on a script by J\u00e1n K\u00e1ko\u0161 |Fairy tale |CSSR |- |1968 |Opatrn\u00e1 vo\u013eba |Careful choice |Adaptation of a play by Jack Popplewell: Careful Rapture |Comedy |CSSR |- |1968 |Predposledn\u00e9 dni |Penultimate days |Television film based on a script by Peter \u0160ev\u010dovi\u010d |Drama |CSSR |- |1969 |Dvojhlav\u00fd orol |Two-headed eagle |Adaptation of a namesake play by Jean Cocteau |Historical drama |CSSR |- |1969 |Inferno |Inferno |Adaptation of a namesake play by Leopold Lahola |Social drama (Temporarily banned) |CSSR |- |1969 |Morsk\u00e1 z\u00e1hada |The Sea Mystery |Adaptation of a namesake novel by Freeman Wills Crofts |Two-part detective story |CSSR |- |1969 |Traja z 9. poschodia Marta Emil Karol |Trio from the 9th floor Marta Emil Karol |Television film based on a script by J\u00e1n Solovi\u010d |Three-part social drama |CSSR |- |1970 |87. rev\u00edr |87 th Precinct |Television work based on the novel Killer's Wedge by Ed McBain |Detective story |CSSR |- |1970 |Prv\u00fd boj |First fight |Original television script by Sergei Yermolinsky |Biographical political drama |CSSR |- |1971 |Dvaja |Two |Based on a namesake play by J\u00falius Bar\u010d-Ivan |Mountain drama |CSSR |- |1971 |Hovor\u00ed\u0161 len o l\u00e1ske |All you talk about is love |Adaptation of a television play by Lewis Greifer |Social drama |CSSR |- |1971 |Krompa\u0161sk\u00e1 vzbura |Krompachian revolt |Television staging based on a script by J\u00e1n Skalka |Social drama based on true events |CSSR |- |1971 |Par\u00ed\u017eski mohyk\u00e1ni |The Mohicans of Paris |Adaptation of a namesake novel by Alexandre Dumas |Six-part historical drama |CSSR |- |1971 |Siedmi z radnice |Seven from the town hall |Television play based on a script by Imre Bencsik \u2013 Calvary of clerks |Political drama |CSSR |- |1972 |Hej, vy tam |Hey, you there |Adaptation of the one-act play Hello Out There!
