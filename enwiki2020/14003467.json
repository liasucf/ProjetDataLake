Patience is a virtue we should strive to acquire.\" *\"We are not born into this world through our own efforts. Our parents are the direct cause of our birth. If we pursue the matter further, we realize that we have received life through the supreme activity of the fundamental power of the universe. Nevertheless, we tend to think we have come as far as we have in life through our own efforts. As long as we are convinced of that, it is difficult for us to feel humble; but such thinking is shallow and lazy.\" *\"We are grateful for everything\u2013for each day we live, for life itself. There is no greater privilege than being born human. Unfortunately, we usually forget this.\" *\"The first principle of Buddhism is to revere with a warm heart and a flexible mind all things that have life. For that, it is essential to recognize the truth of transience.\" ==Books== *My Father, My Teacher: A Spiritual Journey (1989) *Modern Meditations: A Buddhist Sampler (1991) *Cultivating the Buddhist Heart: How to Find Peace and Fulfillment in a Changing World (2008) ==References== ==External links== *Official Site of Rissh\u014d K\u014dsei Kai Category:Living people Category:1938 births Category:Japanese Buddhists Category:Nichiren Buddhists Category:Rissh\u014d K\u014dsei Kai people ",
