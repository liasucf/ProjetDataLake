    "text": "The Danielle Downey Credit Union Classic is an event on the Symetra Tour, the LPGA's developmental tour. It has been a part of the Symetra Tour's schedule since 2015. It is held at Brook-Lea Country Club, designed by Donald Ross, outside Rochester, New York. The tournament was created to honor the legacy of Danielle Downey a native of the Rochester area who played on the LPGA Tour and died in 2014. Prior to the Danielle Downey Classic, Rochester was home to the LPGA's Wegmans LPGA for more than thirty years. The tournament is a 72-hole event, unlike most Symetra Tour tournaments which are 54-holes, and includes pre-tournament pro-am opportunities.
