    "text": "Notoleptopus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the family Phyllanthaceae. It is one of eight genera in the tribe Poranthereae. The sole species is Notoleptopus decaisnei. It is a monoecious shrub, native to Australia, New Guinea, and Indonesia. Notoleptopus decaisnei had long been treated as a species of Leptopus, but in 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study of DNA sequences found it to be sister to a clade consisting of Pseudophyllanthus and Poranthera.Maria S. Vorontsova, Petra Hoffmann, Olivier Maurin, and Mark W. Chase. 2007. \"Phylogenetics of tribe Poranthereae (Phyllanthaceae).\" American Journal of Botany 94(12):2026-2040. In 2008, the new genus Notoleptopus was created for it.Maria S.
