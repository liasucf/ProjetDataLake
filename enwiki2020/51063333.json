    "text": "Gleb Derujinsky (March 19, 1925 \u2013 June 9, 2011) was an American fashion photographer. He worked for Esquire, Look, Life, Glamour, Town and Country and The New York Times Magazine, before shooting extensively for Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Eileen Ford, founder of Ford Models agency, described him as an \u201cearly visionary on a path that others were to follow\u201d. == Early life and education == Gleb Derujinsky was born in New York City in 1925, and named after his father Gleb W. Derujinsky, an immigrant of Russian nobility who became a successful sculptor. The Derujinsky family served the Russian tsars as far back as Peter the Great, and relatives include the composer Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov and the painter Mikhail Vrubel. Derujinsky\u2019s mother, the classical pianist Alexandra Micholoff Derujinsky, died in the late 1950s. Derujinsky\u2019s first languages were Russian and French, and he went on to learn English while enrolled at the Trinity School in New York. In 1942, Derujinsky became a corporal in the army and stayed until after the end of World War II. His language abilities and negotiation skills contributed to his being promoted to Staff Sergeant halfway through his tours, and learned Morse Code in just 30 days. == Career == Upon his return to New York City, he opened his first photography studio with his veteran loan. By February 1948, he landed his first cover with Collier\u2019s magazine. Shortly thereafter, he began working for Harper\u2019s Bazaar Jr., an offshoot of Harper\u2019s Bazaar aimed towards college-age women that became a supplement of Harper\u2019s Bazaar. Derujinsky was retained as a freelance photographer, working alongside Richard Avedon, Lillian Bassman, and Louise Dahl-Wolfe for editors Carmel Snow and Diana Vreeland and art director Alexey Brodovitch. Citing the great photographer Horst P. Horst as a key influence, Derujinsky photographed the Paris Spring collections from 1953-1963 and was known for his outlandish ideas and travel images taken in remote locations all over the world at time when travel, especially by air, was far from common. Derujinsky also freelanced for Look Magazine, Town and Country, The New York Times Magazine, Ladies\u2019 Home Journal, Esquire, Glamour, Seventeen, Life, and Good Housekeeping. Working extensively with Carmen Dell\u2019Orefice and his then-wife Ruth Neumann-Derujinsky, his work also featured many of the era\u2019s top models, from Jean Patchett and Jean Shrimpton, to Nena Von Schlebr\u00fcgge and Iris Bianchi. In 1957, to commemorate the inauguration of Pan Am\u2019s Boeing 707, Derujinsky, dubbed \u201cthe White Russian,\u201d travelled around the world with Ruth Neumann and Nena Von Schlebr\u00fcgge, photographing the former in 11 countries in the space of 28 days. His photographs of the Paris collections of the same year became a 25-page spread in Harper\u2019s Bazaar. In 1968 he began shooting television commercials for Union Carbide, Dolly Madison, Johnson & Johnson, Texas Instruments, and Revlon, going on to win several awards at Cannes and Venice. == Personal life and death == Derujinsky married four models in his lifetime and had Andrea Derujinsky with his third wife and cover girl Ruth Neumann. In 1972, a few years after his divorce from Ruth Neumann, he married Wallis Fairfax Gault with whom he remained for 42 years until their deaths in 2011 in a car accident in Durango, Colorado, where they had lived for nearly 30 years. In Durango, Derujinsky opened a jewelry studio, One of a Kind, making and designing his own pieces. He turned his love of skiing into a career when he qualified as an instructor in nearby Purgatory, and taught in the children\u2019s division for over a decade. He earned an instructor\u2019s license as a glider pilot and was instrumental in starting the Durango Soaring Club at La Plata airport, now known as Animas Air Park. Other achievements later in life include building a carbon fiber bicycle, whose patented design was one of first to be used in an air tunnel test, as well as being used at the 1984 Olympic trials in Los Angeles. == Notable photographs == * Fragrant Harbor Hong Kong, 1957\u20131958 * The Jaipur Observatory, 1957\u20131958 * Ceylon Sails, 1957\u20131958 == Books == *Capturing Fashion: Derujinsky, Photographs by Gleb Derujinsky, Text by Andrea Derujinsky, Foreword by Eileen Ford (Flammarion, 2016).
