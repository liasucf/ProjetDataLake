    "text": "Novak (in Serbian, Croatian and Slovene; Cyrillic: ), Nov\u00e1k (in Hungarian, Czech and Slovak), Nowak or Novack (in German and Polish) is a surname and masculine given name, derived from the slavic word for \"new\" (e.g. , , / ), which depending on the exact language and usage, translates as \"novice\", \"new man\", \"newcomer\", or \"stranger\". It seems to originate, at least by common occurrence, in the province of Upper Silesia, when Germanic stock moved into the upper Oder river region, the slavs referred to the \"new men\" as \"Nowaks\". Another theory is that \"new man\" refers to a person who has converted to Christianity or to a new arrival in a city. It was also used for newcomers to an army and as an occupational surname for people who used the slash-and-burn method to create new arable land\u2014novina.Izvori priimkov. Imenoslovec prof. Pavle Merku. Mladina.si. It is pronounced almost the same way in most languages, with the stress on the first syllable. The main exception is Slovene, which places the stress on the last syllable.
