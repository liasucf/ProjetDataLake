Information about how to lead the migration must be passed to the first bird that encounters Darius.That is Yellowbird (Seth Green) who is excited by the challenge but has very little life experience. Karl (voiced by Jim Rash) expected to take over as leader but Yellowbird lies to the flock and leads them south for the migration. He is really only a young hatchling with no experience and endangers the flock many times. Delf (voiced by Dakota Fanning) always supports him in the beginning. He flies north by mistake, landing in Holland and not Spain. The flock then crosses the North Sea and ends up somewhere with snow. Finally Yellowbird tells the truth and it turns out the \"Iron Bird\" is not to be feared but really is a solution to their problem. They end up taking a plane to Africa. Yellowbird officially becomes part of the flock and everybody celebrates. ==Voice cast== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Character ! French Voice !
