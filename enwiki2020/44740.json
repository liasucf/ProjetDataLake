Recent linguistic, genetic and archaeological evidence suggests that the earliest Turkic peoples descended from agricultural communities in Northeast China who moved westwards into Mongolia in the late 3rd millennium BC, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle. By the early 1st millennium BC, these peoples had become equestrian nomads. In subsequent centuries, the steppe populations of Central Asia appear to have been progressively Turkified by a heterogenous East Asian dominant minority moving out of Mongolia. Many vastly differing ethnic groups have throughout history become part of the Turkic peoples through language shift, acculturation, intermixing, adoption and religious conversion. Nevertheless, certain Turkic peoples share, to varying degrees, non-linguistic characteristics like cultural traits, ancestry from a common gene pool, and historical experiences. The most notable modern Turkic-speaking ethnic groups include Turkish people, Azerbaijanis, Uzbeks, Kazakhs, Turkmens, Kyrgyz and Uyghur people. ==Etymology== Kashgari's Diwan, showing the distribution of Turkic tribes.

A letter by Ishbara Qaghan to Emperor Wen of Sui in 585 described him as \"the Great Turk Khan\". The Bugut (584 CE) and Orkhon inscriptions (735 CE) use the terms T\u00fcrk\u00fct, T\u00fcrk and T\u00fcr\u00fck.Moriyasu & Ochir 1999, p. 123 Previous use of similar terms are of unknown significance, although some strongly feel that they are evidence of the historical continuity of the term and the people as a linguistic unit since early times. This includes the Chinese Spring and Autumn Annals, which refer to a neighbouring people as Beidi.The Turkmen During the first century CE, Pomponius Mela refers to the Turcae in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the Tyrcae among the people of the same area.Pliny, Natural History \u2013 Harvard University Press, vol.

Scholars, including Toru Haneda, Onogawa Hidemi, and Geng Shimin believed that Di, Dili, Dingling, Chile and Tujue all came from the Turkic word T\u00fcrk, which means means 'powerful' and 'strength', and its plural form is T\u00fcrk\u00fct.T. Allsen, P. B. Golden, R. K. Kovalev, and A. P. Martinez (2012), ARCHIVUM EURASIAEMEDII AEV, p. 85 Even though Gerhard Doerfer supports the proposal that t\u00fcrk means 'strong' in general, Gerard Clauson points out that \"the word t\u00fcrk is never used in the generalized sense of 'strong'\" and that t\u00fcrk was originally a noun and meant \"'the culminating point of maturity' (of a fruit, human being, etc.), but more often used as an [adjective] meaning (of a fruit) 'just fully ripe'; (of a human being) 'in the prime of life, young, and vigorous'\".Clauson, G. An Etymological Dictionary of Pre-13th Century Turkish (1972). p. 542-543 Turkologist Peter B. Golden agrees that the term Turk has roots in Old Turkic.Golden, Peter B. \"Some Thoughts on the Origins of the Turks and the Shaping of the Turkic Peoples\". (2006) In: Contact and Exchange in the Ancient World. Ed. Victor H. Mair. University of Hawai'i Press. p. 143: \"Subsequently, \"T\u00fcrk\" would find a suitable Turkic etymology, being conflated with the word t\u00fcrk, which means one in the prime of youth, powerful, mighty (Rona-Tas 1991,10\u201313).\" yet he does not find attempts to link Dili, Dingling, Chile, Tele, & Tiele, which possibly transcribed *tegrek (probably meaning 'cart'), to Tujue, which transliterated T\u00fcrk\u00fct, to be convincing.Golden, Peter B. (1992), An Introduction to the History of the Turkic Peoples, p. 93-95 The Chinese Book of Zhou (7th century) presents an etymology of the name Turk as derived from 'helmet', explaining that this name comes from the shape of a mountain where they worked in the Altai Mountains.Sinor, Cambridge History of Early Inner Asia, Page 295 Hungarian scholar Andr\u00e1s R\u00f3na-Tas (1991) pointed to a Khotanese-Saka word, tturak\u00e4 'lid', semantically stretchable to 'helmet', as a possible source for this folk etymology, yet Golden thinks this connection requires more data. The earliest Turkic-speaking peoples identifiable in Chinese sources are the Dingling, Gekun, and Xinli, located in South Siberia.The Peoples of the Steppe Frontier in Early Chinese Sources, Edwin G. Pulleyblank, page 35Studies on the Peoples and Cultures of the Eurasian Steppes, Peter B. Golden, page 27, https://www.academia.edu/9609971/Studies_on_the_Peoples_and_Cultures_of_the_Eurasian_Steppes During the Middle Ages, various Turkic peoples of the Eurasian steppe were subsumed under the \"umbrella-identity\" of the \"Scythians\". Between 400 CE and the 16th century, Byzantine sources use the name \u03a3\u03ba\u03cd\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9 (Skuthai) in reference to twelve different Turkic peoples.G. Moravcsik, Byzantinoturcica II, p. 236\u201339 In the modern Turkish language as used in the Republic of Turkey, a distinction is made between \"Turks\" and the \"Turkic peoples\" in loosely speaking: the term T\u00fcrk corresponds specifically to the \"Turkish-speaking\" people (in this context, \"Turkish-speaking\" is considered the same as \"Turkic- speaking\"), while the term T\u00fcrki refers generally to the people of modern \"Turkic Republics\" (T\u00fcrki Cumhuriyetler or T\u00fcrk Cumhuriyetleri). However, the proper usage of the term is based on the linguistic classification in order to avoid any political sense. In short, the term T\u00fcrki can be used for T\u00fcrk or vice versa.Jean-Paul Roux, Historie des Turks \u2013 Deux mille ans du Pacifique \u00e1 la M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e.

The Codex was designed in order to help Catholic missionaries communicate with the Kumans. ===Distribution=== The Turkic languages constitute a language family of some 30 languages, spoken across a vast area from Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean, to Siberia and Western China, and through to the Middle East. Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;Turkic Language family tree entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions. an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a second language. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is Turkish proper, or Anatolian Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers. More than one third of these are ethnic Turks of Turkey, dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly Ottoman-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and West Asia; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the Caucasus, China, and northern Iraq. ===Alphabet=== The Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as runes), used for writing mostly Turkic languages. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in Mongolia. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE. The earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the Old Uyghur alphabet in the Central Asia, Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, Cyrillic in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and Latin alphabet in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of Turkic alphabet was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE. The Turkic runiform scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform palaeography as, for example, have the Gothic runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44 The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the Orkhon version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks from the 8th century to record the Old Turkic language. It was later used by the Uyghur Empire; a Yenisei variant is known from 9th-century Kyrgyz inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and the Old Hungarian script of the 10th century. Irk Bitig is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script. The Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed Altaic language family.Turkic peoples, Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Online Academic Edition, 2008 The various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the Oghuz (or Southwestern) languages, the Kypchak (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like Uygur), the Northern languages (like Altay and Yakut), and one existing Oghur language: Chuvash (the other Oghur languages, like Volga Bulgarian, are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult. The Turkish language belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include Azerbaijani, Gagauz, Turkmen and Urum, and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages. ==Geographical distribution== Descriptive map of Turkic peoples. Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority. While the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia, today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in Central Asia, but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey. While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term Turkish usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey. At present, there are six independent Turkic countries: Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Turkey, Uzbekistan. The Turks in Turkey are over 60 million to 70 million worldwide, while the second largest Turkic people are the Azerbaijanis, numbering 22 to 38 million worldwide; most of them live in Azerbaijan and Iran. In the Russian Federation there are several Turkic national subdivisions,Across Central Asia, a New Bond Grows \u2013 Iron Curtain's Fall Has Spawned a Convergence for Descendants of Turkic Nomad Hordes including Bashkortostan, Tatarstan, Chuvashia, Khakassia, Tuva, Yakutia, the Altai Republic, Kabardino-Balkaria, and Karachayevo-Cherkessiya. Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to Russian). The Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in western China and the autonomous region of Gagauzia, located within eastern Moldova and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The Autonomous Republic of Crimea within Ukraine is a home of Crimean Tatars. In addition, there are several communities found in Iraq, Georgia, Bulgaria, the Republic of North Macedonia, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and western Mongolia. Turks in India are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. Karlugh Turks are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is Karlugh Turks which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\". The Western Yugur at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the Dolgan at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions. ==History== Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE ===Origins=== The origins of the Turkic peoples has historically been disputed, with many theories having been proposed. Martine Robbeets suggests that the Turkic peoples were descended from a Transeurasian agricultural community based in northeast China, which is to be associated with the Xinglongwa culture and the succeeding Hongshan culture. The East Asian agricultural origin of the Turkic peoples has been corroborated in multiple recent studies. \"The Proto-Turkic subsistence strategy included an agricultural component, a tradition that may have been inherited from the earlier Proto-Altaic stage and ultimately went back to the origin of millet agriculture in Northeast China (Robbeets, 2017; Savelyev, 2017). The agricultural vocabulary reconstructed to Proto-Turkic includes terms for cultivated cereals (*\u00fcg\u00fcr \u2018broomcorn millet\u2019, *arba \u2018barley\u2019 and *budgaj \u2018wheat\u2019), bread production (*i\u032funk \u2018flour\u2019), farming techniques (*tar\u00ef- \u2018to cultivate land\u2019, *ek- \u2018to sow\u2019, *or- \u2018to reap\u2019 and *sabur- \u2018to winnow grain\u2019) and tools (*kerki \u2018a type of mattock\u2019 and *ek-eg \u2018plough\u2019).\" Around 2,200 BC, due to the desertification of northeast China, the agricultural ancestors of the Turkic peoples probably migrated westwards into Mongolia, where they adopted a pastoral lifestyle. \"A nomadic, pastoralist lifestyle reached the eastern steppe by the end of the second millennium BCE (Taylor et al., 2017; Janz et al., 2017), and it became the basis of the Late Proto-Turkic subsistence in the first millennium BCE. Consequently, the Proto- Turkic language has developed extensive nomadic pastoralist vocabulary, including terms for domestic animals (e.g. *s\u00efg\u00efr \u2018cattle\u2019, *tokl\u00ef \u2018lamb\u2019, *adg\u00efr \u2018stallion\u2019 and *kulum \u2018foal\u2019), horse-riding (*at \u2018riding horse\u2019and *ed\u014ber \u2018saddle\u2019) anddairy products (*ajran \u2018a kind of salty yoghurt\u2019 and *torak \u2018a kind of cheese or quark\u2019).\" Linguistic and genetic evidence strongly suggest an early presence of Turkic peoples in Mongolia. Genetic studies have shown that the early Turkic peoples were of diverse origins, and that Turkic culture was spread westwards through language diffusion rather than migrations of a homogenous population.. \"Both Chinese histories and modern dna studies indicate that the early and medieval Turkic peoples were made up of heterogeneous populations. The Turkicisation of central and western Eurasia was not the product of migrations involving a homogeneous entity, but that of language diffusion.\" The genetic evidence suggests that the Turkification of Central Asia was carried out by East Asian dominant minorities migrating out of Mongolia.. \"These results suggest that Turkic cultural customs were imposed by an East Asian minority elite onto central steppe nomad populations... The wide distribution of the Turkic languages from Northwest China, Mongolia and Siberia in the east to Turkey and Bulgaria in the west implies large-scale migrations out of the homeland in Mongolia. === Early historical attestation === Xiongnu, Mongolic, and proto-Turkic tribes (ca. 300 CE) Early Turkic speakers, such as the Tiele (also known as Gaoche \u9ad8\u8eca, lit. \"High Carts\"), may be related to Xiongnu and Dingling.Weishu, vol. 103 \"\u9ad8\u8eca\uff0c\u84cb\u53e4\u8d64\u72c4\u4e4b\u9918\u7a2e\u4e5f\uff0c\u521d\u865f\u70ba\u72c4\u6b77\uff0c\u5317\u65b9\u4ee5\u70ba\u52d1\u52d2\uff0c\u8af8\u590f\u4ee5\u70ba\u9ad8\u8eca\u3001\u4e01\u96f6\u3002\u5176\u8a9e\u7565\u8207\u5308\u5974\u540c\u800c\u6642\u6709\u5c0f\u7570\uff0c\u6216\u4e91\u5176\u5148\u5308\u5974\u4e4b\u7525\u4e5f\" tr. \"The Gaoche are probably remnants of the ancient Red Di.

Their language, in brief, and Xiongnu [language] are the same yet occasionally there are small differences. Or one may say that they are the junior relatives [lit. sisters' sons ~ sons-in-law] of the Xiongnu in former times.\" According to the Book of Wei, the Tiele people were the remnants of the Chidi (\u8d64\u72c4), the red Di people competing with the Jin in the Spring and Autumn period. Historically they were established after the 6th century BCE.Peter Zieme: The Old Turkish Empires in Mongolia. In: Genghis Khan and his heirs. The Empire of the Mongols.

Medieval Muslim writers noted that Tibetans and Turks resembled each other, and that they often were not able to tell the difference between Turks and Tibetans. Moreover, on Western Turkic coins \"the faces of the governor and governess are clearly mongoloid (a roundish face, narrow eyes), and the portrait have definite old T\u00fcrk features (long hair, absence of headdress of the governor, a tricorn headdress of the governess)\". ====Xiongnu (3rd c.

It has even been suggested that the Xiongnu themselves, who were mentioned in Han Dynasty records, were Proto-Turkic speakers.Silk-Road:Xiongnu Although little is known for certain about the Xiongnu language(s), it seems likely that at least a considerable part of Xiongnu tribes spoke a Turkic language.Lebedynsky (2006), p. 59. Some scholars believe they were probably a confederation of various ethnic and linguistic groups.Nicola di Cosmo, Ancient China and its Enemies, S. 163ff. A genetic research in 2003, on skeletons from a 2000 year old Xiongnu necropolis in Mongolia, found individuals with similar DNA sequences as modern Turkic groups, supporting the view that at least parts of the Xiongu were of Turkic origin. Xiongnu writing, older than Turkic, is agreed to have the earliest known Turkic alphabet, the Orkhon script. This has been argued recently using the only extant possibly Xiongu writings, the rock art of the Yinshan and Helan Mountains.MA Li-qing On the new evidence on Xiongnu's writings. (Wanfang Data: Digital Periodicals, 2004) Petroglyphs of this region dates from the 9th millennium BCE to the 19th century, and consists mainly of engraved signs (petroglyphs) and few painted images.Paola Dematt\u00e8 Writing the Landscape: the Petroglyphs of Inner Mongolia and Ningxia Province (China).

Excavations done during 1924\u20131925 in Noin-Ula kurgans located in the Selenga River in the northern Mongolian hills north of Ulaanbaatar produced objects with over 20 carved characters, which were either identical or very similar to the runic letters of the Turkic Orkhon script discovered in the Orkhon Valley.N.

CE)==== Huns (c.450 CE) The Hun hordes ruled by Attila, who invaded and conquered much of Europe in the 5th century, might have been, at least partially, Turkic and descendants of the Xiongnu.G. Pulleyblank, \"The Consonantal System of Old Chinese: Part II\", Asia Major n.s. 9 (1963) 206\u201365 In the 18th century, the French scholar Joseph de Guignes became the first to propose a link between the Huns and the Xiongnu people, who were northern neighbours of China in the 3rd century BC. Since Guignes' time, considerable scholarly effort has been devoted to investigating such a connection. The issue remains controversial. Their relationships to other peoples known collectively as the Iranian Huns are also disputed. Some scholars regard the Huns as one of the earlier Turkic tribes, while others view them as Proto- Mongolian or Yeniseian in origin.VAJDA, Edward J. (2008). \"Yeniseic\" a chapter in the book Language isolates and microfamilies of Asia, Routledge, to be co- authored with Bernard Comrie; 53 pages. Linguistic studies by Otto Maenchen- Helfen and others have suggested that the language used by the Huns in Europe was too little documented to be classified. Nevertheless, many of the proper names used by Huns appear to be Turkic in origin.Otto J. Maenchen-Helfen. The World of the Huns: Studies in Their History and Culture. University of California Press, 1973 Turkic peoples originally used their own alphabets, like Orkhon and Yenisey runiforms, and later the Uyghur alphabet. Traditional national and cultural symbols of the Turkic peoples include wolves in Turkic mythology and tradition; as well as the color blue, iron, and fire. Turquoise blue (the word turquoise comes from the French word meaning \"Turkish\") is the color of the stone turquoise still used in jewelry and as a protection against the evil eye. ===Steppe expansions=== ====G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks \u2013 Turkic Khaganate (5th\u20138th c.)==== First Turk Khaganate (600 CE) The Eastern and Western Turkic Khaganates (600 CE) The first mention of Turks was in a Chinese text that mentioned trade between Turk tribes and the Sogdians along the Silk Road.\"Etienne de la Vaissiere\", Encyclop\u00e6dia Iranica article:Sogdian Trade , 1 December 2004. The Ashina clan migrated from Li-jien (modern Zhelai Zhai) to the Rourans seeking inclusion in their confederacy and protection from the prevalent dynasty. The Ashina tribe were famed metalsmiths and were granted land near a mountain quarry which looked like a helmet, from which they were said to have gotten their name \u7a81\u53a5 (t\u016bju\u00e9), the first recorded use of \"Turk\" as a political name. In the 6th-century, Ashina's power had increased such that they conquered the Tiele on their Rouran overlords' behalf and even overthrew Rourans and established the First Turkic Khaganate. In the 6th century, 400 years after the collapse of northern Xiongnu power in Inner Asia, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks assumed leadership of the Turkic peoples. Formerly in the Xiongnu nomadic confederation, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks inherited their traditions and administrative experience. From 552 to 745, G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk leadership united the nomadic Turkic tribes into the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Empire on Mongolia and Central Asia. The name derives from gok, \"blue\" or \"celestial\". Unlike its Xiongnu predecessor, the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk Khaganate had its temporary Khagans from the Ashina clan, who were subordinate to a sovereign authority controlled by a council of tribal chiefs. The Khaganate retained elements of its original animistic-shamanistic religion, that later evolved into Tengriism, although it received missionaries of Buddhist monks and practiced a syncretic religion. The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks were the first Turkic people to write Old Turkic in a runic script, the Orkhon script. The Khaganate was also the first state known as \"Turk\". It eventually collapsed due to a series of dynastic conflicts, but many states and peoples later used the name \"Turk\".West, Barbara A. (2010-05-19). Encyclopedia of the Peoples of Asia and Oceania. Infobase Publishing. p. 829. . \"The first people to use the ethnonym Turk to refer to themselves were the Turuk people of the Gokturk Khanate in the mid sixth-century\" The G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks (First Turkic Kaganate) quickly spread west to the Caspian Sea. Between 581 and 603 the Western Turkic Khaganate in Kazakhstan separated from the Eastern Turkic Khaganate in Mongolia and Manchuria during a civil war. The Han-Chinese successfully overthrew the Eastern Turks in 630 and created a military Protectorate until 682. After that time the Second Turkic Khaganate ruled large parts of the former G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk area. After several wars between Turks, Chinese and Tibetans, the weakened Second Turkic Khaganate was replaced by the Uyghur Khaganate in the year 744.Haywood, John (1998), Historical Atlas of the Medieval World, AD 600\u20131492, Barnes & Noble ====Bulgars, Golden Horde and the Siberian Khanate==== The migration of the Bulgars after the fall of Old Great Bulgaria in the 7th century The Bulgars established themselves in between the Caspian and Black Seas in the 5th and 6th centuries, followed by their conquerors, the Khazars who converted to Judaism in the 8th or 9th century. After them came the Pechenegs who created a large confederacy, which was subsequently taken over by the Cumans and the Kipchaks. One group of Bulgars settled in the Volga region and mixed with local Volga Finns to become the Volga Bulgars in what is today Tatarstan. These Bulgars were conquered by the Mongols following their westward sweep under Genghis Khan in the 13th century. Other Bulgars settled in Southeastern Europe in the 7th and 8th centuries, and mixed with the Slavic population, adopting what eventually became the Slavic Bulgarian language. Everywhere, Turkic groups mixed with the local populations to varying degrees. Golden Horde The Volga Bulgaria became an Islamic state in 922 and influenced the region as it controlled many trade routes. In the 13th century, Mongols invaded Europe and established the Golden Horde in Eastern Europe, western & northern Central Asia, and even western Siberia. The Cuman-Kipchak Confederation and Islamic Volga Bulgaria were absorbed by the Golden Horde in the 13th century; in the 14th century, Islam became the official religion under Uzbeg Khan where the general population (Turks) as well as the aristocracy (Mongols) came to speak the Kipchak language and were collectively known as \"Tatars\" by Russians and Westerners. This country was also known as the Kipchak Khanate and covered most of what is today Ukraine, as well as the entirety of modern-day southern and eastern Russia (the European section). The Golden Horde disintegrated into several khanates and hordes in the 15th and 16th century including the Crimean Khanate, Khanate of Kazan, and Kazakh Khanate (among others), which were one by one conquered and annexed by the Russian Empire in the 16th through 19th centuries. In Siberia, the Siberian Khanate was established in the 1490s by fleeing Tatar aristocrats of the disintegrating Golden Horde who established Islam as the official religion in western Siberia over the partly Islamized native Siberian Tatars and indigenous Uralic peoples. It was the northernmost Islamic state in recorded history and it survived up until 1598 when it was conquered by Russia. ====Uyghur Khaganate (8th\u20139th c.)==== Uyghur Khaganate Uyghur royals The Uyghur empire ruled large parts of Mongolia, Northern and Western China and parts of northern Manchuria. They followed largely Buddhism and animistic traditions. During the same time, the Shatuo Turks emerged as power factor in Northern and Central China and were recognized by the Tang Empire as allied power. The Uyghur empire fell after several wars in the year 840. The Turkic Later Tang Dynasty The Shatuo Turks had founded several short-lived sinicized dynasties in northern China during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period. The official language of these dynasties was Chinese and they used Chinese titles and names. Some Shaotuo Turks emperors also claimed patrilineal Han Chinese ancestry. Considering the father was originally called Nieliji without a surname, the fact that his patrilineal ancestors all had Chinese names here indicates that these names were probably all created posthumously after Shi Jingtang became a \"Chinese\" emperor. Shi Jingtang actually claimed to be a descendant of Chinese historical figures Shi Que and Shi Fen, and insisted that his ancestors went westwards towards non-Han Chinese area during the political chaos at the end of the Han Dynasty in the early 3rd century.According to Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 99, and New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 10. Liu Zhiyuan was of Shatuo origin. According to Wudai Huiyao, vol. 1 Liu Zhiyuan's great-great-grandfather Liu Tuan (\u5289\u6e4d) (titled as Emperor Mingyuan posthumously, granted the temple name of Wenzu) descended from Liu Bing (\u5289\u661e), Prince of Huaiyang, a son of Emperor Ming of HanAccording to Old History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 99, and New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 10. Liu Zhiyuan was of Shatuo origin. According to Wudai Huiyao, vol. 1 Liu Zhiyuan's great-great-grandfather Liu Tuan (\u5289\u6e4d) (titled as Emperor Mingyuan posthumously, granted the temple name of Wenzu) descended from Liu Bing (\u5289\u661e), Prince of Huaiyang, a son of Emperor Ming of Han After the fall of the Tang-Dynasty in 907, the Shatuo Turks replaced them and created the Later Tang Dynasty in 923. The Shatuo Turks ruled over a large part of northern China, including Beijing. They adopted Chinese names and united Turkic and Chinese traditions. Later Tang fall in 937 but the Shatuo rose to become one of the most powerful clans of China. They created several other dynasies, including the Later Jin and Later Han. The Shatuo Turks were later assimilated into the Han Chinese ethnic group after they were conquered by the Song dynasty.Mote, F.W.: Imperial China: 900\u20131800, Harvard University Press, 1999 The Yenisei Kyrgyz allied with China to destroy the Uyghur Khaganate in 840. The Kyrgyz people ultimately settled in the region now referred to as Kyrgyzstan. ===Central Asia=== ==== Kangar union (659\u2013750) ==== Kangar Union after the fall of Western Turkic Khaganate, 659\u2013750 The Kangar Union (Qanghar Odaghu) was a Turkic state in the former territory of the Western Turkic Khaganate (the entire present-day state of Kazakhstan, without Zhetysu). The ethnic name Kangar is a medieval name for the Kangly people, who are now part of the Kazakh, Uzbek,Tolstoi V.P. Origin of the Karakalpak people//KSIE, Moscow, 1947. p.75 and Karakalpak nations. The capital of the Kangar union was located in the Ulytau mountains. The Pechenegs, three of whose tribes were known as Kangar (Greek: \u039a\u03b1\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03c1), after being defeated by the Oghuzes, Karluks, and Kimek-Kypchaks, attacked the Bulgars and established the Pecheneg state in Eastern Europe (840\u2013990 CE). ==== Oghuz Yabgu State (766\u20131055) ==== Oghuz Yabgu State (c.750 CE) The Oguz Yabgu State (Oguz il, meaning \"Oguz Land,\", \"Oguz Country\")(750\u20131055) was a Turkic state, founded by Oghuz Turks in 766, located geographically in an area between the coasts of the Caspian and Aral Seas. Oguz tribes occupied a vast territory in Kazakhstan along the Irgiz, Yaik, Emba, and Uil rivers, the Aral Sea area, the Syr Darya valley, the foothills of the Karatau Mountains in Tien-Shan, and the Chui River valley (see map). The Oguz political association developed in the 9th and 10th centuries in the basin of the middle and lower course of the Syr Darya and adjoining the modern western Kazakhstan steppes. ===Iranian, Indian, Arabic, and Anatolian expansion=== Turkic peoples and related groups migrated west from Northeastern China, present-day Mongolia, Siberia and the Turkestan- region towards the Iranian plateau, South Asia, and Anatolia (modern Turkey) in many waves. The date of the initial expansion remains unknown. ====Persia==== =====Ghaznavid dynasty (977\u20131186)===== Ghaznavid Empire at its greatest extent in 1030 CE The Ghaznavid dynasty ( \u0121aznaviy\u0101n) was a Persianate Muslim dynasty of Turkic mamluk origin,Islamic Central Asia: an anthology of historical sources, Ed.

At its greatest extent, the Seljuk Empire controlled a vast area stretching from western Anatolia and the Levant to the Hindu Kush in the east, and from Central Asia to the Persian Gulf in the south. The Seljuk empire was founded by Tughril Beg (1016\u20131063) and his brother Chaghri Beg (989\u20131060) in 1037. From their homelands near the Aral Sea, the Seljuks advanced first into Khorasan and then into mainland Persia, before eventually conquering eastern Anatolia. Here the Seljuks won the battle of Manzikert in 1071 and conquered most of Anatolia from the Byzantine Empire, which became one of the reasons for the first crusade (1095\u20131099). From c. 1150\u20131250, the Seljuk empire declined, and was invaded by the Mongols around 1260. The Mongols divided Anatolia into emirates. Eventually one of these, the Ottoman, would conquer the rest. =====Timurid Empire (1370\u20131507)===== Map of the Timurid Empire at its greatest extent under Timur.

These Turkic dynasties were the Mamluk dynasty (1206\u201390); the Khalji dynasty (1290\u20131320); and the Tughlaq dynasty (1320\u20131414). Southern India also saw many Turkic origin dynasties like the Bahmani Sultanate, the Adil Shahi dynasty, the Bidar Sultanate, and the Qutb Shahi dynasty, collectively known as the Deccan sultanates. The Mughal Empire was a Turkic- founded Indian empire that, at its greatest territorial extent, ruled most of South Asia, including Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh and parts of Uzbekistan from the early 16th to the early 18th centuries. The Mughal dynasty was founded by a Chagatai Turkic prince named Babur (reigned 1526\u201330), who was descended from the Turkic conqueror Timur (Tamerlane) on his father's side and from Chagatai, second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother's side.Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Article:Mughal DynastyEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Article:Babur A further distinction was the attempt of the Mughals to integrate Hindus and Muslims into a united Indian state.Babur: Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Article ====Arabian world==== Silver dirham of AH 329 (940/941 CE), with the names of Caliph al-Muttaqi and Amir al-umara Bajkam (de facto ruler of the country) The Arab Muslim Umayyads and Abbasids fought against the pagan Turks in the Turgesh Khaganate in the Muslim conquest of Transoxiana. The Medieval Arabs recorded that Medieval Turks looked strange from their perspective and were extremely physically different from the Arabs, calling them \"broad faced people with small eyes\". Medieval Muslim writers noted that Tibetans and Turks resembled each other, and that they often were not able to tell the difference between Turks and Tibetans. Turkic soldiers in the army of the Abbasid caliphs emerged as the de facto rulers of most of the Muslim Middle East (apart from Syria and Egypt), particularly after the 10th century. The Oghuz and other tribes captured and dominated various countries under the leadership of the Seljuk dynasty and eventually captured the territories of the Abbasid dynasty and the Byzantine Empire. ====Anatolia \u2013 Ottomans==== After many battles, the western Oghuz Turks established their own state and later constructed the Ottoman Empire. The main migration of the Oghuz Turks occurred in medieval times, when they spread across most of Asia and into Europe and the Middle East.Carter V. Findley, The Turks in World History (Oxford University Press, October 2004) They also took part in the military encounters of the Crusades.Moses Parkson, \"Ottoman Empire and its past life\" p. 98 In 1090\u201391, the Turkic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army., Steven Lowe and Dmitriy V. Ryaboy As the Seljuk Empire declined following the Mongol invasion, the Ottoman Empire emerged as the new important Turkic state, that came to dominate not only the Middle East, but even southeastern Europe, parts of southwestern Russia, and northern Africa. ====Islamization==== Turkic peoples like the Karluks (mainly 8th century), Uyghurs, Kyrgyz, Kazakhs, and Turkmens later came into contact with Muslims, and most of them gradually adopted Islam. Some groups of Turkic people practice other religions, including their original animistic-shamanistic religion, Christianity, Burkhanism, Jews (Khazars, Krymchaks, Crimean Karaites), Buddhism and a small number of Zoroastrians. ===Modern history=== Independent Turkic states shown in red The Ottoman Empire gradually grew weaker in the face of poor administration, repeated wars with Russia, Austria and Hungary, and the emergence of nationalist movements in the Balkans, and it finally gave way after World War I to the present-day Republic of Turkey. Ethnic nationalism also developed in Ottoman Empire during the 19th century, taking the form of Pan-Turkism or Turanism. The Turkic peoples of Central Asia were not organized in nation-states during most of the 20th century, after the collapse of the Russian Empire living either in the Soviet Union or (after a short-lived First East Turkestan Republic) in the Chinese Republic. In 1991, after the disintegration of the Soviet Union, five Turkic states gained their independence. These were Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Other Turkic regions such as Tatarstan, Tuva, and Yakutia remained in the Russian Federation. Chinese Turkestan remained part of the People's Republic of China. Immediately after the independence of the Turkic states, Turkey began seeking diplomatic relations with them. Over time political meetings between the Turkic countries increased and led to the establishment of T\u00dcRKSOY in 1993 and later the Turkic Council in 2009. ==International organizations== T\u00dcRKSOY members. There are several international organizations created with the purpose of furthering cooperation between countries with Turkic-speaking populations, such as the Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture (T\u00dcRKSOY) and the Parliamentary Assembly of Turkic- speaking Countries (T\u00dcRKPA) and the Turkic Council. The TAKM \u2013 Organization of the Eurasian Law Enforcement Agencies with Military Status, was established on 25 January 2013. It is an intergovernmental military law enforcement (gendarmerie) organization of currently three Turkic countries (Azerbaijan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey) and Kazakhstan as observer. === T\u00dcRKSOY === T\u00fcrksoy carries out activities to strengthen cultural ties between Turkic peoples. One of the main goals to transmit their common cultural heritage to future generations and promote it around the world. Every year, one city in the Turkic world is selected as the \"Cultural Capital of the Turkic World\". Within the framework of events to celebrate the Cultural Capital of the Turkic World, numerous cultural events are held, gathering artists, scholars and intellectuals, giving them the opportunity to exchange their experiences, as well as promoting the city in question internationally. === Turkic Council === The newly established Turkic Council, founded on November 3, 2009 by the Nakhchivan Agreement confederation, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Turkey, aims to integrate these organizations into a tighter geopolitical framework. The member countries are Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Turkey. Uzbekistan formally applied for membership on September 12, 2019. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev back in 2006. Turkmenistan is currently not an official member of the council, however, it is a possible future member of the council. Hungary has announced to be interested in joining the Turkic council. Since August 2018, Hungary has official observer status in the Turkic Council.\"Press Release of the Sixth Summit of the Turkic Council\". Turkic Council. Retrieved 2018-09-04. ==Demographics== Bashkirs, painting from 1812, Paris The distribution of people of Turkic cultural background ranges from Siberia, across Central Asia, to Southern Europe. the largest groups of Turkic people live throughout Central Asia\u2014Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Azerbaijan, in addition to Turkey and Iran. Additionally, Turkic people are found within Crimea, Altishahr region of western China, northern Iraq, Israel, Russia, Afghanistan, and the Balkans: Moldova, Bulgaria, Romania, and former Yugoslavia. A small number of Turkic people also live in Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Small numbers inhabit eastern Poland and the south- eastern part of Finland.Substantial numbers (possibly several millions) of maghrebis of the former Ottoman colonies in North Africa are of Ottoman Turkish descent. Finnish Tatars There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from Turkey) in Germany, United States, and Australia, largely because of migrations during the 20th century. Sometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the Oghuz Turks, Kipchak, Karluk, Siberian, Chuvash, and Sakha/Yakut branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks. The genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.The Karakalpak Gene Pool (Spencer Wells, 2001); and discussion and conclusions at www.karakalpak.com/genetics.html Historical population: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Turks mostly herded sheep, goats and horses. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as s\u00fct (milk), yagh (butter), ayran, qaymaq (similar to clotted cream), qi\u0305mi\u0305z (fermented mare's milk) and qurut (dried yoghurt). During the Middle Ages Kazakh, Kyrgyz and Tatars, who were historically part of the Turkic nomadic group known as the Golden Horde, continued to develop new variations of dairy products. Nomadic Turks cooked their meals in a qazan, a pot similar to a cauldron; a wooden rack called a qasqan can be used to prepare certain steamed foods, like the traditional meat dumplings called manti. They also used a saj, a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and shish. In later times, the Persian tava was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a chanaq, and eaten with a knife (b\u00efchaq) and spoon (qashi\u0305q). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called oqlaghu, a colander called s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h, and a grinding stone called t\u0101girm\u0101n. Medieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called qaw\u00efrmach, while k\u00f6ch\u00e4 was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. Salma were broad noodles that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called tutmaj in the Middle Ages and are called kesme today. There are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. Yupqa is the thinnest type of dough, bawi\u0305rsaq is a type of fried bread dough, and ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k is a deep fried flat bread. Qatlama is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like pinwheel sandwiches. Toqach and ch\u00f6r\u00e4k are varieties of bread, and b\u00f6r\u00e4k is a type of filled pie pastry. Herd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called sujuk. Though prohibited by Islamic dietary restrictions, historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of blood sausage. One type of sausage, called qazi\u0305, was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, offal and rice. Chopped meat was called q\u00efyma and spit-roasted meat was s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch\u2014from the root s\u00f6k- meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as kebab in modern times. Qawirma is a typical fried meat dish, and kullama is a soup of noodles and lamb. ==Religion== ===Early Turkic mythology and Tengrism=== A shaman doctor of Kyzyl. Pre-Islamic Turkic mythology was dominated by Shamanism, Animism and Tengrism. The Turkic animistic traditions were mostly focused on ancestor worship, polytheistic-animism and shamanism. Later this animistic tradition would form the more organized Tengrism. The chief deity was Tengri, a sky god, worshipped by the upper classes of early Turkic society until Manichaeism was introduced as the official religion of the Uyghur Empire in 763. The wolf symbolizes honour and is also considered the mother of most Turkic peoples. Asena (Ashina Tuwu) is the wolf mother of Tumen Il-Qa\u011fan, the first Khan of the G\u00f6kt\u00fcrks. The horse and predatory birds, such as the eagle or falcon, are also main figures of Turkic mythology. ===Religious conversions=== ==== Buddhism ==== Tengri B\u00f6g\u00fc Khan made the now extinct Manichaeism the state religion of Uyghur Khaganate in 763 and it was also popular in Karluks. It was gradually replaced by the Mahayana Buddhism. It existed in the Buddhist Uyghur Gaochang up to the 12th century. Tibetan Buddhism, or Vajrayana was the main religion after Manichaeism. They worshipped T\u00e4\u014bri T\u00e4\u014brisi Burxan, Quan\u0161\u00ef Im Pusar\u56de\u9e58\u89c2\u97f3\u4fe1\u4ef0\u8003 and Maitri Burxan. Turkic Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent and west Xinjiang attributed with a rapid and almost total disappearance of it and other religions in North India and Central Asia. The Sari Uygurs \"Yellow Yughurs\" of Western China, as well as the Tuvans and Altai of Russia are the only remaining Buddhist Turkic peoples. ==== Islam ==== A Mosque in Kazakhstan Most Turkic people today are Sunni Muslims, although a significant number in Turkey are Alevis. Alevi Turks, who were once primarily dwelling in eastern Anatolia, are today concentrated in major urban centers in western Turkey with the increased urbanism. Azeris are traditionally Shiite Muslims. Religious observance is less stricter in the Republic of Azerbaijan compared to Iranian Azerbaijan. The major Christian-Turkic peoples are the Chuvash of Chuvashia and the Gagauz (G\u00f6ko\u011fuz) of Moldova. The traditional religion of the Chuvash of Russia, while containing many ancient Turkic concepts, also shares some elements with Zoroastrianism, Khazar Judaism, and Islam. The Chuvash converted to Eastern Orthodox Christianity for the most part in the second half of the 19th century. As a result, festivals and rites were made to coincide with Orthodox feasts, and Christian rites replaced their traditional counterparts. A minority of the Chuvash still profess their traditional faith.Guide to Russia:Chuvash Church of the East was popular among Turks such as the Naimans. It even revived in Gaochang and expanded in Xinjiang in the Yuan dynasty period.\u9ad8\u660c\u56de\u9e58\u4e0e\u73af\u5854\u91cc\u6728\u591a\u5143\u6587\u5316\u7684\u878d\u5408 \u5510\u4ee3\u4e2d\u56f4\u666f\u6559\u4e0e\u666f\u6559\u672c\u90e8\u6559\u4f1a\u7684\u5173\u7cfb It disappeared after its collapse.7\u201311 \u4e16\u7d00\u666f\u6559\u5728\u9678\u4e0a\u7d72\u7da2\u4e4b\u8def\u7684\u50b3\u64ad Today there are several groups that support a revival of the ancient traditions. Especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union, many in Central Asia converted or openly practice animistic and shamanistic rituals. It is estimated that about 60% of Kyrgyz people practice a form of animistic rituals. In Kazakhstan there are about 54.000 followers of the ancient traditions. =====Muslim Turks and non- Muslim Turks===== Uyghur king from Turpan region attended by servants Kara- Khanids performed a mass conversion campaign against the Buddhist Uyghur Turks during the Islamization and Turkification of Xinjiang. The non-Muslim Turks worship of Tengri and other gods was mocked and insulted by the Muslim Turk Mahmud al-Kashgari, who wrote a verse referring to them \u2013 The Infidels \u2013 May God destroy them! The Basmil, Yab\u0101\u1e33u and Uyghur states were among the Turkic peoples who fought against the Kara-Khanids spread of Islam. The Islamic Kara- Khanids were made out of Tukhai, Yaghma, \u00c7i\u011fil and Karluk. Kashgari claimed that the Prophet assisted in a miraculous event where 700,000 Yab\u0101qu infidels were defeated by 40,000 Muslims led by Arsl\u0101n Teg\u012bn claiming that fires shot sparks from gates located on a green mountain towards the Yab\u0101qu. The Yabaqu were a Turkic people. Mahmud al-Kashgari insulted the Uyghur Buddhists as \"Uighur dogs\" and called them \"Tats\", which referred to the \"Uighur infidels\" according to the Tuxsi and Taghma, while other Turks called Persians \"tat\".https://web.archive.org/web/20151118063834/http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/huri/files/viii- iv_1979-1980_part1.pdf p. 160. While Kashgari displayed a different attitude towards the Turks diviners beliefs and \"national customs\", he expressed towards Buddhism a hatred in his Diwan where he wrote the verse cycle on the war against Uighur Buddhists. Buddhist origin words like toyin (a cleric or priest) and Burx\u0101n or Furxan (meaning Buddha, acquiring the generic meaning of \"idol\" in the Turkic language of Kashgari) had negative connotations to Muslim Turks.

The Kyz kuu (chase the girl) \u2013 it has been played by Turkic people at festivals since time immemorial. The Jereed \u2013 Horses have been essential and even sacred animals for Turks living as nomadic tribes in the Central Asian steppes. Turks were born, grew up, lived, fought and died on horseback. So became jereed the most important sporting and ceremonial game of Turkish people. The kokpar began with the nomadic Turkic peoples who have come from farther north and east spreading westward from China and Mongolia between the 10th and 15th centuries. The jigit which is used in the Caucasus and Central Asia to describe a skillful and brave equestrian, or a brave person in general. ==Gallery== ===Bezeklik caves and Mogao grottoes=== Images of Buddhist and Manichean Turkic Uyghurs from the Bezeklik caves and Mogao grottoes.
