His league and championship career with the Cork senior team spanned eleven seasons from 1984 to 1994. Born in Midleton, County Cork, Hartnett first played competitive hurling at St. Colman's College in Fermoy. Here he was a member of the senior team that played in the Harty Cup. Hartnett later lined out with University College Cork, winning a Fitzgibbon Cup medal in 1985. Hartnett first appeared for the Midleton club at juvenile and underage levels, winning county under-21 championship medals. He later joined the club's senior team and won an All-Ireland medal in 1988. Hartnett also won two Munster medals and four county senior championship medals. In spite of never having played minor hurling for Cork, Hartnett made his debut on the inter-county scene at the age of nineteen when he was selected for the Cork under-21 team. He enjoyed two championship seasons with the under-21 team, winning an All-Ireland medal as a non-playing substitute in 1982. Hartnett subsequently joined his brother, John, on the Cork senior team, making his debut during the 1984 championship. Over the course of the next ten years, he won two All-Ireland medals, beginning with a lone triumph in his debut season in 1984 before adding a second winners' medal in 1986. Hartnett also won four Munster medals and one National Hurling League medal. After being chosen on the Munster Munster inter-provincial team for the first time in 1985, Hartnett was an automatic choice on the starting fifteen for three consecutive seasons. During that time he won one Railway Cup medal. After being involved in team management and coaching with the Midleton under-21 hurling team, Hartnett was appointed as a selector to the Cork minor team in 2014. He became a senior selector as part of Kieran Kingston's management team in 2015. ==Honours== ;University College Cork *Fitzgibbon Cup (1): 1985 ;Midleton *All-Ireland Senior Club Hurling Championship (1): 1988 *Munster Senior Club Hurling Championship (2): 1983, 1987 *Cork Senior Hurling Championship (4): 1983, 1986, 1987, 1991 ;Cork *All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship (2): 1984, 1986 *Munster Senior Hurling Championship (4): 1984, 1985, 1986, 1992 *National Hurling League (1): 1992-93 *All-Ireland Under-21 Hurling Championship (1): 1982 *Munster Under-21 Hurling Championship (1): 1982 ;Munster *Railway Cup (1): 1985 ==References== Category:1962 births Category:Living people Category:Midleton hurlers Category:Cork inter-county hurlers Category:Munster inter-provincial hurlers Category:Hurling selectors Category:All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship winners Category:Alumni of University College Cork ",
