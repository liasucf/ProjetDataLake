It is widely considered to be a major information technology hub of South Asia. Named after the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, its main commercial district was built in the early 1980s and consists of several buildings, that flank a large pedestrian courtyard, built over underground parking. Although poorly maintained, most of the original structures are still in use. The Nehru Place market is open every day except Sundays. Due to higher rental shops, some shops and showrooms remain open on Sunday with a flea- market for clothes, computers, and mobile accessories. ==Location and accessibility== Nehru Place is accessible by all forms of public transport, as it lies next to the Outer Ring Road, an arc that encompasses major parts of South Delhi, and the bus services are very frequent, usually once every five to eight minutes. Private taxis are also available, as well as paid parking for cars and motorcycles. The famous Baha'i faith Lotus temple is also located close by. Now Nehru place is accessible by Delhi Metro. The nearest metro stations include Nehru Place, Kalkaji Mandir and Nehru Enclave. * Has its own Delhi-Metro Station on Violet Line (Kashmere Gate to Escorts Mujesar via Badarpur) * Has a second Metro Station by the name of Nehru Enclave on Magenta Line (Botanical garden-Janakpuri West) connecting commuters with shorter route from Gurgaon with interchange at Hauz Khas and directly connecting Noida and IGI Airport. * 30 minutes from Hazrat Nizamuddin Railway Station * 1 hr from New Delhi Railway Station * It has its own bus terminal, popularly known as Nehru Place Bus Terminal. ==Real estate== Office space and hotels are easily available around Nehru Place. Widely regarded as the center for small-scale IT services, Nehru Place is a hub for all forms of IT hardware, such as personal computers, servers, networking equipment, software, documentation services, and all allied services. Several manufacturers of computer hardware have their authorised dealerships located here, and as such, it is often considered as a computer enthusiasts' shopping area. Several businesses also build custom- specification personal computers and servers to order on-site, and many businesses are dedicated to hardware servicing. There are also firms that deal exclusively in used and second-hand computer hardware, as well as small, one- room shops that sell software titles. One can find some of the best deals for hardware here. One of the unique features of Nehru Place is the pervading informal atmosphere, akin to a flea market or a bazaar, in a place that deals in high-technology products. As such, a visitor may find pavement vendors selling items such as printer toner cartridges, blank optical media, printer paper, and even software from a small stall or cart. Bargaining is widely tolerated, even expected, as a large portion of the trading is done without proper documentation, such as cash receipts and bills, and it is possible to purchase items at a lower price than they are marked with. A vibrant informal economy has developed due to the abundance of illegally copied software available for sale, which has led to legal action against many organisations operating from Nehru Place. Other businesses that operate in the area are banks, multinational corporations, several restaurants, and even a multiplex. Several hotels are also available like Hotel Mint Casa. Intercontinental series of hotels has its own member hotel here as Eros Intercontinental. Surprisingly, the market also has been a hub for digital printing and photocopy services. The market houses around 20 large and small scale digital printers who contribute about INR 100 crore each year. The market is closed on Sunday, but the flea market is open seven days a week. ==Areas near Nehru Place== * Chirag Delhi * Nehru Enclave * Shaheen Bagh * East of Kailash * Greater Kailash * Sarita Vihar * Kailash Colony * Okhla * Kalkaji * Govindpuri * Jasola Vihar * Chittaranjan Park * Sant Nagar ==Other Areas In South Delhi== * Devli Village * Sangam Vihar * East of Kailash * Greater Kailash * Lajpat Nagar * Mehrauli * Malviya Nagar * Nehru Place * Chittaranjan Park * Saket * South Extension * Jaitpur * Dakshin puri ==Spiritual Places near Nehru Place== * Kalka Mandir * Lotus Temple * Prachin Bhairav Mandir * ISKCON Temple Delhi ==References== * https://www.nehruplacemarket.com/ * http://www.delhimetrorail.com/OtherDocuments/Route_Map.pdf * http://www.printweek.in/Gallery/338687,picture-gallery-nehru-place- decoded.aspx/1 Category:District Centres of Delhi Category:New Delhi Category:Shopping districts and streets in India Category:South Delhi district Category:Monuments and memorials to Jawaharlal Nehru ",
