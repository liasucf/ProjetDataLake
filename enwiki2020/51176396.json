In a letter, he told the Al-Nour Party in Egypt to not \u201ctrade God\u2019s law for the law of the world.\" Shortly after Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi was released from prison in June 2014 he sharply criticized the Islamic State. Abu Muhammad al-Tahawi expressed neutral position on dispute between Nusra Front and Islamic State. But on September 30, 2014, while they were both imprisoned, he and Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi issued a statement calling on Abu Qatada to cease his criticism of the Islamic State. ==References== Category:Jordanian Muslims Category:People from Irbid Category:Prisoners and detainees of Jordan Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
