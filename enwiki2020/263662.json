    "text": "Huli jing () or jiuweihu () are Chinese mythological creatures usually capable of shapeshifting, who may either be benevolent or malevolent spirits. ==Development== Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, in which, depending on the tale, they can be a good or a bad omen. During the Han dynasty, the development of ideas about interspecies transformation had taken place in Chinese culture. The idea that non-human creatures with advancing age could assume human form is presented in works such as the Lunheng by Wang Chong (27\u201391). As these traditions developed, the fox's capacity for transformation was shaped. ==Descriptions== The nine-tailed fox occurs in the Shanhaijing (Classic of Mountains and Seas), compiled from the Warring States period to the Western Han period (circa 4th to circa 1st century BC). The work states: In chapter 14 of the Shanhaijing, Guo Pu had commented that the nine-tailed fox was an auspicious omen that appeared during times of peace. However, in chapter 1, another aspect of the nine-tailed fox is described: In one ancient myth, Yu the Great encountered a white nine- tailed fox, which he interpreted as an auspicious sign that he would marry N\u00fcjiao. In Han iconography, the nine-tailed fox is sometimes depicted at Mount Kunlun and along with Xi Wangmu in her role as the goddess of immortality. According to the first-century Baihutong (Debates in the White Tiger Hall), the fox's nine tails symbolize abundant progeny. Describing the transformation and other features of the fox, Guo Pu (276\u2013324) made the following comment: The Youyang Zazu made a connection between nine-tailed foxes and the divine: ==Traditions== Popular fox worship during the Tang dynasty has been mentioned in a text entitled Hu Shen (Fox gods): In the Song dynasty, fox spirit cults, such as those dedicated to Daji, became outlawed, but their suppression was unsuccessful. For example, in 1111, an imperial edict was issued for the destruction of many spirit shrines within Kaifeng, including those of Daji. ==In mythology== In Chinese mythology, it is believed that all things are capable of acquiring human forms, magical powers, and immortality, provided that they receive sufficient energy, in such forms as human breath or essence from the moon and the sun. It was believed that a fox would place skulls on its head, and the one that fit would transform it into a human being. The fox spirits encountered in tales and legends are usually females and appear as young, beautiful women. One of the most infamous fox spirits in Chinese mythology was Daji (), who is portrayed in the Ming shenmo novel Fengshen Yanyi. A beautiful daughter of a general, she was married forcibly to the cruel tyrant Zhou Xin ( Zh\u00f2u X\u012bn). A nine-tailed fox spirit who served N\u00fcwa, whom Zhou Xin had offended, entered into and possessed her body, expelling the true Daji's soul. The spirit, as Daji, and her new husband schemed cruelly and invented many devices of torture, such as forcing righteous officials to hug red-hot metal pillars. Because of such cruelties, many people, including Zhou Xin's own former generals, revolted and fought against Zhou Xin's dynasty, Shang. Finally, King Wen of Zhou, one of the vassals of Shang, founded a new dynasty named after his country. The fox spirit in Daji's body was later driven out by Jiang Ziya (), the first Prime Minister of the Zhou dynasty and her spirit condemned by N\u00fcwa herself for excessive cruelty. Typically fox spirits were seen as dangerous, but some of the stories in the Qing dynasty book Liaozhai Zhiyi by Pu Songling are love stories between a fox appearing as a beautiful girl and a young human male. In the fantasy novel The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt, a huli jing teaches a young girl magic, enabling her to conjure armies with her spells. Belief in fox spirits has also been implicated as an explanatory factor in the incidence of attacks of koro, a culture-bound syndrome found in southern China and Malaysia in particular. There is mention of the fox spirit in Chinese Ch\u00e1n Buddhism, when Linji Yixuan compares them to voices that speak of the Dharma, stating \"the immature young monks, not understanding this, believe in these fox-spirits...\" ==In popular culture== * The 2019 series Love, Death & Robots episode, Good Hunting https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9788498/ is an animated version of the myth based on a short story written by Ken Liu. ==See also== *Daji, a well-known character who was a fox spirit in the Fengshen Yanyi *Fox spirit, a general overview about this being in East Asian mythology **Kitsune, a Japanese fox spirit **Kumiho, a Korean nine-tailed fox spirit ** H\u1ed3 Ly Tinh, a Vietnamese fox spirit *Huxian, the god(dess) personifying fox spirits *Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, a compilation of supernatural stories of which many have fox spirits as a theme ==References== ==Literature== * * * * * Ting, Nai- tung. \"A Comparative Study of Three Chinese and North-American Indian Folktale Types.\" Asian Folklore Studies 44, no. 1 (1985): 42-43.
