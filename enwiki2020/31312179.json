    "text": "Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg (12 February 1709 \u2013 14 December 1779) was a French physician, botanist, writer, translator and publisher known for translating Benjamin Franklin's work into French and for inventing a gentlemen's umbrella fitted with a lightning conductor. He designed a method of histographic visualizations which he called the Carte chronographique. ==Life== He first embarked on theological studies, but abandoned this to devote his life to science. He studied medicine in Paris and obtained a doctorate in 1748. He was a keen follower of the work of Benjamin Franklin, and they maintained a regular friendly correspondence. He translated some of Franklin's early experimental work into French in 1762 and published it in Gazette d'Epidaure, his medical journal. He went on to publish his French translation of Franklin's Observations and Experiments in 1773. Barbeu-Dubourg's \"umbrella- lightning rod\", an umbrella fitted with a tall spike and trailing chain, was designed to give the same protection for gentlemen as was sought by ladies of the time who wore lightning conductors on their hats. Barbeu-Dubourg was a member of the Royal Society of Medicine in Paris, the Medical Society of London and the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia. He wrote numerous books and papers, including: *Chronographie, ou Description des tems, contenant toute la suite des souverains de l'univers et des principaux \u00e9v\u00e9nements de chaque si\u00e8cle... (Paris, 1753), one of the most ambitious of the chronographic charts produced during that period. The chart was 54 feet long, and mounted on an apparatus with scrolls and cranks to allow the reader to move freely through world history, a device which Barbeu-Dubourg called a \"chronographic machine\". *Gazette d'\u00c9pidaure, ou Recueil de nouvelles de m\u00e9decine avec des r\u00e9flexions pour simplifier la th\u00e9orie et \u00e9clairer la pratique (Paris, 1762) *'Le Botaniste fran\u00e7ois, comprenant toutes les plantes communes et usuelles... (two volumes, Paris, 1767) *Petit Code de la raison humaine, ou Exposition succincte de ce que la raison dicte \u00e0 tous les hommes pour \u00e9clairer leur conduite et assurer leur bonheur (Paris, 1789) During the American Revolution the French government appointed Barbeu-Dubourg to act as secret intermediary to offer support to the Americans, but he was soon deemed unsuitable for the task and replaced by Beaumarchais. As Streeter Bass recounts, \"He was too old, he lacked business acumen, and \u2013 more serious in a venture of this nature \u2013 he was insecure and garrulous.\" Barbeu-Dubourg wrote the article \u2033Chronologique\u2033 for the Encyclop\u00e9die of Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. He died in 1779 in Paris and his ashes were buried in the chapel of Saint-Symphorien church in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. ==Carte chronographique== The Chronographie universelle & details qui en dependent pour la Chronologie & les Genealogies abbreviated to Carte chronographique was the first synchronoptical visualisation which attempted to map world history from the Garden of Eden to the Age of Enlightenment. ==Gallery== File:Barbeu- Dubourg - Chronographie (Tableau 34).png|Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg, Chronographie, ou Description des Tems\u2026, tableau 34, Paris 1753 File:Umbrella fitted with lightning conductor.jpg|Umbrella fitted with lightning conductor, designed by Jacques Barbeu-Dubourg. 18th century engraving File:Lightning rod hats.jpg|Lightning rod hats fashion of circa 1778. 19th century engraving designed by \u00c9mile Deschamps (1822\u20131893) and Yan Dargent (1824\u20131899) ==References== Category:French botanists Category:French translators Category:1709 births Category:1799 deaths Category:English\u2013French translators Category:Translators to French Category:Contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131772) Category:French people of the American Revolution Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society Category:People from Mayenne Category:Burials at the Abbey of Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s Category:18th-century French botanists Category:18th-century French journalists Category:18th- century French physicians ",
