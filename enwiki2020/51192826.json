    "text": "Atoma is the eleventh full-length studio album by Swedish melodic death metal band Dark Tranquillity. It was released on 4 November 2016 through Century Media Records. Atoma is the band's first studio album with new bassist Anders Iwers, who replaced founding member Martin Henriksson (also the rhythm guitarist), after Henriksson left the band in early 2016 due to loss of passion for playing music. Two songs, \"The Absolute\" and \"Time Out of Place\", were recorded during the making of this album, but were released on a bonus disc in the limited edition. These songs are softer, darker and more brooding with only clean singing, reminiscent of bands such as Katatonia and the later Opeth. Another song, \"Reconstruction Time Again\", was released as a Japanese edition bonus track. It is a nine-minute electro-industrial medley of the songs \"State of Trust\", \"None Becoming\", and \"Uniformity\" from the Construct album. Atoma is the last release to feature founding member Niklas Sundin, who would depart from the band in March 2020. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Dark Tranquillity=== *Mikael Stanne \u2013 vocals *Niklas Sundin \u2013 guitars; album artwork *Anders Iwers \u2013 bass *Martin Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m \u2013 keyboards *Anders Jivarp \u2013 drums ===Additional personnel=== *David Castillo \u2013 mixing, mastering *Annelie Johansson - backing vocals (track 3) *Bj\u00f6rn Gelotte - lead guitar (track 5) == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !
