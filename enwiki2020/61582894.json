    "text": "Yoongarillup is a locality in the local government area of the City of Busselton. At the 2016 census, the area had a population of 72. The area's name is derived from the Wardandi dialect of the Noongar language and means \"by the Nyungar who belong and come hither to burn on this district\". Spanish settlers arrived in the early 20th century on the recommendation of Rutlan Casas, who had visited in the late 19th century. The Spanish grew potatoes and were later renowned winemakers in the area, which became known as the Spanish Settlement. The area also became part of the Group Settlement Scheme in the 1920s, with the Yoongarillup Hall being built in 1923 during this period. In 2017, a sculpture by Greg James, Spanish Settler, was unveiled by the City of Busselton in the ArtGeo Cultural Complex as part of the Busselton Settlement Art Project. ==References== ==Further reading== * Category:South West (Western Australia) ",
