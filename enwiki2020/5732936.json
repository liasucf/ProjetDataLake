According to Henry Taunt, the part of the road between Banbury Road and Woodstock Road was called Gallows-Baulk Road. When the road was improved, the remains of several people who had been hanged were found. The houses in St Margaret's Road were mostly designed by William Wilkinson and Harry Wilkinson Moore in partnership. They were built between 1879 and 1886. The main buildings of St Hugh's College are by Herbert Tudor Buckland and William Haywood, dating from 1914\u201316 and built in a neo-Georgian style. ==Gallery== File:St Margaret's Road, Oxford.JPG|View west along St Margaret's Road from the junction with Woodstock Road.
