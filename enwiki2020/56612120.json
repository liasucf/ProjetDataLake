Having begun production in September 2013, the film had went through production delays before being released on 16 February 2018. ==Cast== *Rajkamal as Sakthi *Andreanne as Andreanne *Lollu Sabha Manohar *Muthukaalai ==Production== In September 2013, director MSS convinced television actor Rajkamal to play the lead role in his film on a Tamil tour guide falling in love with a tourist. MSS chose to make Melnaatu Marumagan after his debut project Neengatha Ennam starring Bhanu Chander's son Jayanth, was shelved. Melnaatu Marumagan was to be produced by Bahadur Sha, with music by Kishore Kumar and cinematography by Gautham Krishna. Andreanne Nouyrigat, a resident of Pondicherry who has appeared in Tamil cinema, was then recruited to star in the lead role alongside Rajkamal. In the film, she played a Brahmin girl from Madurai and dubbed her own lines in Tamil. The film was completed by January 2015, but a potential release date in February 2015 was bypassed. Following three years of delays and a change of producer, the team began promotions planning to release the film in early 2018. The team also announced plans of potentially releasing the film in France. ==Release== The film was released on 16 February 2018 across Tamil Nadu. In their review of the film, critic Suganth of The Times of India gave the film 0.5 stars out of 5, adding \"it is the kind of film that makes you wonder why it was made in the first place and for whom\". The critic added \"and the all-round bad acting only makes it worse\" and \"by the time we reach the interval point, you stop worrying about the movie\u2019s existence and start questioning your own\". ==Soundtrack== The film's music was composed by V. Kishorkumar. The soundtrack was released on 22 August 2016 through Auro Music. The song \"Yaroival\" was written by lyricist Na. Muthukumar within thirty minutes on a car journey he had to Chennai airport. ==References== ==External links== * Category:2018 films Category:Indian films Category:2010s Tamil-language films Category:Indian action films Category:2018 directorial debut films Category:2018 action films ",
