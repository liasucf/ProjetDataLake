She was, along with Bodymap, one of the new wave of designers who emerged at the beginning of the 1980s in London. Hogg first sold her designs at Hyper Hyper in London's Kensington and later from her own shop in Newburgh Street, always refusing to \u2018sell out\u2019 to the mainstream fashion industry.

Her solo show at the Kelvingrove Art Galleries in 1990, was the first fashion design exhibition to be held there and was well attended. ==1990s== In 1991, Terry Wogan introduced her onto his TV show as \"one of the most original, inventive, creative designers in Britain\" adding, \"She has reached what is called Cult Status\". In the same year a brief appearance on stage in Nashville with industrial noise band Pigface reaffirmed her love of performing, resulting in her shifting focus back to writing music full-time. Unexpectedly landing the support act with Debbie Harry in 1993, she formed new band \u2018Doll\u2019 in five days, and in 1994 with the band firmly established, opened for the post punk band The Raincoats ==2000s== Between 1999 and 2001, her continued love of designing and making clothes resulted in two catwalk collections and her first Fashion Film \"Accelerator\" starring Anita Pallenberg, Bobby Gillespie and Patti Palladin.

In 2003 Hogg was approached by Jarvis Cocker collaborator Jason Buckle to form a \"Cramps like band\" which would become known as Hoggdoll. Using his swamp like Rockabilly sounds as a backdrop she wrote and recorded 6 tracks in as many weeks and built up an underground following across the globe Her unexpectedly tender song 'Honeyland' touched a nerve and eventually surfaced on The Berlin Based Art Riot band Chicks on Speed 'Girlmonster' compilation in 2006.
