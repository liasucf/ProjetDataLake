Many mid- and high-rise apartment buildings which were built after 1900 and before 1940 in New York and surrounding areas are considered \"pre-war\" and known for their spaciousness, hardwood flooring, detailing, and, in some cases, fireplaces. Quite often they are luxury rentals or co-op apartments.https://streeteasy.com/blog/what-is-a-prewar-apartment-building/ ==Examples== *620 Park Avenue *655 Park Avenue *740 Park Avenue *834 Fifth Avenue *The Beresford ==See also== *Antebellum architecture == References == Category:American architectural styles Category:House styles Category:20th- century architecture in the United States ",
