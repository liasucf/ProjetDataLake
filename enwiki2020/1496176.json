    "text": "Bres R\u00ed (Bres the King), son of Art Imlech, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland, who took power after killing his predecessor, and his father's killer, Nuadu Finn F\u00e1il. He ruled for nine years, and fought many battles against the Fomorians, before he was killed at Carn Conluain by Eochu Apthach. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn synchronises his reign with those of Nebuchadrezzar II of Babylon (605\u2013562), Cambyses II of Persia (died 522 BC), and Cyaxares of the Medes (625\u2013585).R. A.
