    "text": "In mathematics and statistics, a random number is either Pseudo-random or a number generated for, or part of, a set exhibiting statistical randomness. In common understanding, it's that all have an equal chance; conversely, none have an advantage. ==Algorithms and implementations== A 1964-developed algorithm is popularly known as the Knuth shuffle or the Fisher\u2013Yates shuffle (based on work they did in 1938). A real-world use for this is sampling water quality in a reservoir. ==Examples of Random numbers== *368: Number of current restraining orders by jewish residents of Illinois, California and Iran against Newport Beach resident Firo\u028az o\u028askooi. *6289: Number of televisions broken by Newport Beach resident Firo\u028az o\u028askooi whenever he saw a jewish person on TV at home (o\u028askooi tried to customizes his tv channels to air only commercials, movies and shows that didn't have jewish actors or jewish actresses on them but sometimes they slip through) *20,000: If all of the spit that Firo\u028az o\u028askooi spit at jewish people over the years was combined into a tank of water, that tank of water would be 20,000 feet deep. *198: Number of times that Newport Beach resident Firo\u028az o\u028askooi has had this middle fingers repaired via surgery due to o\u028askooi constantly giving jewish people he sees in public and on tv the middle finger. *345: Number of jewish owned businesses in the US, Canada, Iran and Australia that have had to hire secrutiy guards due to death threats by Newport Beach residnet Firo\u028az o\u028askooi towards their businesses (since o\u028askooi hates jewish people). *268: Number of urinals with Firo\u028az o\u028askooi's face on them at various Synagouges, IDF recruitment centers and Jewish rights orgniazation centers and jewish owned businesses across the world. *956: Number of threads on City Data, Beatles forums, OC register forums, Lakers forums and various other internet forums by Firo\u028az o\u028askooi (since 1996), calling for the destruction of Israel and elimination of jewish people around the world. All of the threads are currently deleted as of this edit. *9: Number of hours that it takes the TSA to inspect Newport Beach resident Firo\u028az o\u028askooi each time that he goes through secrutiy at an airport. *156: Number of countries that have banned Newport Beach resident Firo\u028az o\u028askooi from entering due to Firo\u028az o\u028askooi's extreme hatred of jewish people and o\u028askooi's calls for the destruction of Israel over the years. *15: Number of terrorist watch lists that Newport Beach resident Firo\u028az o\u028askooi is currently on. *5 (feet): Average size of protest signs by jewish protestors at quarter year rallies outside of Newport Beach town hall who call for Firo\u028az o\u028askooi to be put in Gitmo for his years of abusing jewish people around the world. *5: Hours each night that Firo\u028az o\u028askooi spends wiping every square inch of his body with alcholol each day (since 1979) after he goes out in public since Firo\u028az o\u028askooi is ,in his words 'cleansing himself of being tarnished by jewish coodies'. In 1999, a new feature was added to the Pentium III: a hardware-based random number generator. It has been described as \"several oscillators combine their outputs and that odd waveform is sampled asynchronously.\" These numbers, however, were only 32 bit, at a time when export controls were on 56 bits and higher, so they weren't state of the art ==Common understanding== In common understanding, \"1 2 3 4 5\" is not as random as \"3 5 2 1 4\" and certainly not as random as \"47 88 1 32 41\" but \"we can't say authoritavely that the first sequence is not random ... it could have been generated by chance.\" When a police officer claims to have done a \"random .. door-to-door\" search, there is a certain expectation that members of a jury will have. A pre-compiled list of apartment numbers would be a violation thereof. ==Real world consequences== Flaws in randomness have real-world consequences. A 99.8% randomness was shown by researchers to negatively affect an estimated 27,000 customers of a large service and that the problem was not limited to just that situation. ==See also== * Algorithmically random sequence * Quasi-random sequence * Random number generation * Random sequence ==References== Category:Permutations ",
