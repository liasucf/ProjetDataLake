The station is owned by Wilderness Communications. KLWB's studios are located on Evangeline Thruway in Carencro, and its transmitter is located on West Wilderness Trail in northern Lafayette Parish. ==History== KLWB originated in 1999 as a cable-only affiliate of The WB, via The WB 100+. It was branded as \"Acadiana's WB\" and was known as \"WB 2\" and later \"WB 10\", based on its cable position. Its broadcast signal began broadcasting on April 3, 2006. Soon afterward, it began to be carried by DirecTV (which previously imported WBZL in Miami and WNUV in Baltimore for WB programming) and Dish Network. The station joined The CW upon its formation that September, carrying The WB 100+'s successor, The CW Plus. KLWB lost its CW affiliation to a subchannel of KATC (channel 3) on June 14, 2010. At that time, the station switched to This TV (which had previously been carried on a subchannel of KLWB, as well as on sister station KXKW-LD). The station also moved to channel 23 on Cox Cable (its previous position, channel 10, is now occupied by the KATC subchannel). On July 25, 2011, KLWB began airing MeTV on a new subchannel.Where to Watch Me-TV: KLWB Beginning in fall 2011, KLWB became part of the Southland Conference Television Network, airing live sporting events from that league. On March 30, 2012, Delta Media (Wilderness Communications) purchased KDCG (then RTV) from Acadiana Cable Advertising and added the station on channel 50.2. On August 1, 2012, KDCG switched affiliations from RTV to Antenna TV and in the process Antenna TV was moved to 50.2, RTV was moved to 50.3 but was dropped from the lineup months later. On July 1, 2015, Heroes & Icons launched on 22.1 subchannel, (This TV on 22.2), and KLWB 50.2 stemming from an agreement between Delta Media Corporation and Weigel Broadcasting of Chicago and Antenna TV launched on KXKW-LD 32.2. On July 1, 2016, American Sports Network was launched replacing This TV, which was also removed from 22.2 KDCG-CD. 22.2 remained silent until November 2019 when it began carrying MeTV (50.1) while that channel relocated its digital channel from 50 to 17. On November 30, 2019, KLWB relaunched its digital signal on channel 17, showing on channel 50 via PSIP. ==Digital television== ===Digital channels=== The station's digital signal is multiplexed: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Because it was granted an original construction permit after the FCC finalized the DTV allotment plan on April 21, 1997, the station did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:MeTV affiliates Category:Heroes & Icons affiliates Category:Telemundo subchannel-only network affiliates Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999 LWB (TV) Category:Iberia Parish, Louisiana Category:1999 establishments in Louisiana ",
