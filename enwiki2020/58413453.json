    "text": "The yaogu is a traditional Chinese drum instrument. It is the symbol of Chinese drums. It displays unique forms and traditional customs. It is played on people's waists, using hands or two wooden sticks. == History == In ancient times, in the Yellow River valley, the male in every tribe wrapped sheepskins around the trunk of a tree and carried it at his waist, to drive beasts away from the tribes. The first percussion instrument originated four thousand years ago in China in the neolithic Shang Dynasty. Percussion instruments were widely used in celebration of the dynasty and the conflicts. Drums symbolized spirit and power and represented the universe. Dating to the Qing and Han Dynasties, the yaogu was used to send signals to frontier guards, to inform their leaders that enemies were approaching. People played the Yaogu to celebrate the harvest. It is believed that the sound of the yaogu brings luck to local areas during prayer. Yangko (Yangge): Traditional Chinese dance performance At the beginning of the 20th century, the yaogu was combined with dance when the peasants were working in the fields. In order to recover from fatigue and boredom, peasants in northwest China developed a dance named \"Yangko\" from fieldwork. Yangko (also named Yangge) remains a popular rural folk dance. == Dance movements == Yaogu performers are full of energy. They move their bodies with the beats of drums and musical rhythm to express passions. Performers shake their heads and wave their shoulders strongly combining dancing movements with personal emotions. ==Performing form == Yaogu can also play a leading part in a performance by standing in front of an orchestra. 304x304px == Culture == The Yaogu opened a channel for traditional Chinese percussion instruments. The Yaogu illustrates the simple and unconstrained character of the farmers in the northwest loess plateau. It expresses the collective spirit of the Shanxi people and good wishes for life. == References == Category:Asian percussion instruments Category:Chinese musical instruments Category:Dance in China Category:Drums ",
