    "text": "F is a modular, compiled, numeric programming language, designed for scientific programming and scientific computation. F was developed as a modern Fortran, thus making it a subset of Fortran 95. It combines both numerical and data abstraction features from these languages. F is also backwards compatible with Fortran 77, allowing calls to Fortran 77 programs. F was first included in the g95 compiler. == Overview == F is designed to be a minimal subset of Fortran, with only about one hundred intrinsic procedures. Language keywords and intrinsic function names are reserved keywords in F and no other names may take this exact form. F contains the same character set used in Fortran 90/95 with a limit of 132 characters. Reserved words are always written in lowercase. Any uppercase letter may appear in a character constant. Variable names do not have restriction and can include upper and lowercase characters. ===Operators=== F supports many of the standard operators used in Fortran. The operators supported by F are: * Arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**` * Relational operators: `<`, `<=`, `==`, `/=`, `>`, `>=` * Logical operators: `.not.`, `.and.`, `.or.`, `.eqv.`, `.neqv.` * character concatenation: `//` The assignment operator is denoted by the equal sign `=`. In addition, pointer assignment is denoted by `=>`. Comments are denoted by the `!` symbol: variable = expression ! assignment pointer => target ! pointer assignment ===Data types=== Similar to Fortran, the type specification is made up of a type, a list of attributes for the declared variables, and the variable list. F provides all the same types as Fortran as well, with the sole exception of doubles: ! type [,attribute list] :: entity declaration list real :: x, y ! declaring variables of type real x,y without an attribute list integer (kind = long), dimension (100) :: x ! declaring variable of type big integer array with the identifier x character (len = 100) :: student_name ! declaring a character type variable with len 100 F does not have intrinsic support for object-oriented programming, but it does allow for records: type, public :: City character (len = 100) :: name character (len = 50) :: state end type City Variable declarations are followed by an attribute list. The attributes allowed are `parameter`, `public`, `private`, `allocatable`, `dimension`, `intent`, `optional`, `pointer`, `save` and `target`. The attribute list is followed by `::`, which is part of the syntax. F also allows for optional initialization in the list of objects. All items in a list will have the same attributes in a given type declaration statement. In addition, declarations are attribute oriented instead of entity oriented. ===Statement and control flow=== F supports 3 statements for control flow: `if`, a basic conditional, `case`, a switch statement, and `do`, a conditional while loop. The `return`, `stop`, `cycle`, and `exit` statements from Fortran may be used to break control flow. real :: x do i = 100 x += i print i cycle end do max : do if (x > y) then exit max: end if x = y; end max stop if (x < y) then x = x + y; else if ( x > y) then x = y - x; end if select case (maximum): case (0) x = 0 case (1) x = 1 case (5) x = 5 case default x = 10 end select F places a heavy emphasis on modular programming. Modules in F are called \"programs\": program main ! Insert code here end program main Placing procedures outside of a module is prohibited. F supports most of the modules and subroutines found in the Fortran 95 standard library. All procedures in F are external by default, and require a result clause that returns the value of a function. F supports recursion. All of the intrinsic procedures found in Fortran 95 may be used in F, with the exceptions of `achar`, `iachar`, `lge`, `lgt`, `lle`, `llt`, `transfer`, `dble`, `dim`, `dprod`, and `mod`. == References == == External links == * F Programming Language Homepage * g95 compiler Category:Fortran programming language family Category:Programming languages ",
