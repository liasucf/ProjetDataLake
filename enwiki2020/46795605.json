As a man with a great influence, he managed to secure privileges for the area that suffered under Ottoman misrule. Furthermore he was a member of the Filiki Eteria,Spyridon Trikoupis [\u03a3\u03c0\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b4\u03c9\u03bd \u03a4\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c0\u03b7\u03c2], \u0399\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0395\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2 \u0395\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03c9\u03c2, 1860, vol.1, p.177. a secret 19th-century organization whose purpose was to overthrow the Ottoman rule of Greece and establish an independent Greek state.

On 18 April 1821 in Kalamos in Attica he fought the Ottoman troops coming from Euboea. A few days later he led the attack against Athens. More specifically, in the night between the 25th and 26 April 600 gunmen attacked the walls from the side between Agioi Apostoloi and the Boubounistra Gate and quickly managed to capture the entire city except Acropolis.Spyridon Trikoupis, 1860, vol.1 (\u0391\u2019), p.179.Ioannis Philimon, 1860, vol.3 (\u0393'), p.131. During the summer of the same year, a serious dispute broke out between Vasileiou and the elders of Athens concerning the military leadership of Attica, after the arbitrary assumption of leadership by him on 14 June. The next day, Vasileiou became the target of an assassination attempt while, probably in retaliation, rebels looted the house of an Athenian notable.Municipality of Aspropyrgos, 1992, p.27. The situation appeared to smooth temporarily after the intervention of Demetrios YpsilantisIoannis Philimon, 1860, vol.3 (\u0393'), p.373. and the dispatch of the Vasileiou and his men to Boeotia. However, later, he had a new conflict, this time with his compatriots, which according to one version, was triggered by the Athenian notables.Municipality of Aspropyrgos, 1992, p.28-31. From 1822 until 1825 Vasileiou was gradually promoted to the grades of deputy chiliarch, chiliarch and eventually taxiarch. He took part in the battles of Schimatari, the Siege of the Acropolis and of Marathon, but also in the campaign of Odysseas Androutsos in eastern Central Greece. Later, Vasileiou was appointed by Yannis Gouras in charge of levying the tithe in Attica, thus rekindling local rivalries of previous years.Municipality of Aspropyrgos, 1992, p.31-35. In May 1826 Meletis Vasileiou was murdered by his compatriots, who in the raid of Omer Pasha of Karystos in Attica rushed to declare their surrender to him, due to a disagreement with the commandant of the Acropolis, Yannis Gouras.Spyridon Trikoupis, 1862, vol.4 (\u0394\u2019), p.57. ==References== Category:1778 births Category:1826 deaths Category:Greek military leaders of the Greek War of Independence Category:Members of the Filiki Eteria Category:Assassinated Greek people Category:People murdered in Greece Category:People from Fyli ",
