Zultrax was originally developed in 2001 by Peter Bartholomeus but is now maintained by a team of developers under the name Zultrax V.O.F. It is coded using Borland Delphi, which is the reason a 64-bit version of the program hasn't been released. The aim of Zultrax is to provide ease of use combined with the encrypted ZEPP network.
