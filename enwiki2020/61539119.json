    "text": "\"British Bombs\" is a song by English singer, songwriter, and musician Declan McKenna. It was released as single on 19 August 2019 through Sony Music Entertainment. The song was written by Declan McKenna and produced by James Ford. ==Background== The song is about the exploration of politics, by taking aim at the government over the arms trade. McKenna is also donating proceeds from the single to charity. Speaking about the song, he said, \"'British Bombs' is a tune I wrote about the hypocrisy of the British arms trade and the weapons convention in London. I think too often it's implied that matters in the world are too complex to not end up with war, or to not possess and sell weapons, and I just think it is pure bullshit. Not only do we still engage in wars far away from our homes, which settle nothing and fuel extremism in the aftermath, we sell weapons to other countries full well knowing where they end up. I wanted to write a song that was outright against war, in any form. Violence breeds violence and I just don't think the world is too complex to set a peaceful precedent, but it seems the business of war is what keeps happening. To say it's a shame feels like a huge understatement.\" ==Music video== A music video to accompany the release of \"British Bombs\" was first released onto YouTube on 19 August 2019. The music video was directed by Ed Bulmer. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from Tidal. * James Ford \u2013 producer * Declan McKenna \u2013 composer, lyricist, associated performer, piano, vocal * Tom Herbert \u2013 assistant engineer * Nathan Cox \u2013 bass * Gabrielle King \u2013 drums * Matt Jaggar \u2013 engineer * Will Bishop \u2013 keyboards * Kevin Tuffy \u2013 mastering engineer * Alan Moulder \u2013 mixing engineer * Caesar Edmunds \u2013 mixing engineer ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !
