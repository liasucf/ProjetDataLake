Khajjiar sits on a small plateau with a small stream-fed lake in the middle that has been covered over with weeds. The hill station is surrounded by meadows and forests. It is about above sea level in the foothills of the Dhauladhar ranges of the Western Himalayas and peaks can be seen in the distance. It is part of the Kalatop Khajjiar Sanctuary. Khajjiar can be reached from Dalhousie, the nearest major town and hill station, by bus in an hour or so. It has a rare combination of three ecosystems: lake, pasture and forest. ==Mini Switzerland== On 7 July 1992, Swiss Envoy Willy P. Blazer, Vice Counselor and Head of Chancery of Switzerland in India brought Khajjiar on the world tourism map by calling it \"Mini Switzerland\". He also put a sign of a yellow Swiss hiking footpath showing Khajjiar's distance from the Swiss capital Berne: \". Khajjiar is among the 160 locations in the world that bear topographical resemblance with Switzerland. The counselor also took from Khajjiar a stone which will form part of a stone collage around the Swiss Parliament to remind the visitors of Khajjiar as a \"Mini Switzerland of India\". ==Accommodation== Khajjiar during August Khajjiar view There is a hotel and some cottages run by HP Tourism at Khajjiar where the tourists can stay. Besides that, there are two rest houses one each of P.W.D. and Forest Department. A couple of private hotels have also come up, which do not match the above places in terms of location and amenities. ==Travel== Most tourists travel to Khajjiar by private or rented vehicles.

It is densely covered with deodar and fir forest. The place is a favorite spot for picnics and trekking. ===Khajjiar Lake=== Khajjiar Lake is a small lake, surrounded by saucer-shaped lush green meadow and a floating island. The dense growth of weed called vacha has made its earth spongy. Now the banks stand covered by a thick layer of earth, formed by the years of dust settling down on the weeds. ===Khajji Nag temple=== A little away from the lake is the temple of Khajji Nag belonging to the 12th century CE made by the king of Chamba, Prithvi Singh. The temple has a golden dome due to which it is also known as Golden Devi Temple. In the mandapa of the temple one can see the images of the Pandavas and the defeated Kauravas hanging from the roof of the circumambulatory path. The sanctum of the temple has been carved from wood. This temple is dedicated to snake (N\u0101ga) worship and there are some snake idols inside. The temple also has idols of Shiva and Goddess Hadimba. ==Trekking== Khajjiar offers numerous trekking opportunities. Khajjiar to Dainkund is a easy to moderate trek.
