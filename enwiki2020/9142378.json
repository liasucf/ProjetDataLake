    "text": "Moving Windows is the second and final studio album by American synth-pop trio Our Daughter's Wedding (ODW), released in 1982 by EMI Records. The album was recorded at Intergalactic Studio, except for \"Moving Windows\" which was recorded at Electric Lady Studios, both studios were located in New York. ==Critical reception== In a retrospective review for AllMusic, critic Stephen Schnee wrote of the album, \"Relying exclusively on synths, Silve and bandmates Layne Rico and Scott Simon create an intriguing aural landscape. There is not a synthetic beat out of place here, and it is a most enjoyable release. Too bad we didn't get to hear more of them.\" ==Track listing== All songs written by ODW, except \u2021 ODW and David Spradley Side one #\"Auto Music\"\u2021 - 3:01 #\"She Was Someone\" - 3:03 #\"Elevate Her\"\u2021 - 3:29 #\"Track Me Down\" - 3:15 #\"Daddy's Slave\" - 3:59 #\"Longitude 60\u00b0\" - 3:19 Side two # * \"Love Machine\"\u2021 - 3:44* (*time printed on album, actual time 4:33) #\"Always Be True\" - 2:44 #\"Moving Windows\" - 3:55 #\"Paris\" - 3:14 #\"Buildings\"\u2021 - 4:20 ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the Moving Windows liner notes. * Layne Rico \u2014 synthesizer * Keith Silva \u2014 vocals; keyboards * Scott Simon \u2014 bass synthesizer; saxophone * David Spradley and ODW \u2014 production ** Frank Simon and ODW \u2014 production on \"She Was Someone\" * Claire Taylor \u2014 album design * Anders Nordstr\u00f6m \u2014 photography ==Special thanks== Bob Currie, Aurthur Ring, Nona Hendryx, J.K., Fred Zarr, Ted Currier, M.O.T.C., Lo Chin ==References== ==External links== * Category:1982 albums Category:Synth-pop albums by American artists ",
