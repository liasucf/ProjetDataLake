    "text": "Nanaimo City was a provincial electoral district in the city of Nanaimo, British Columbia in Canada from 1890 to 1912. It was one of two Nanaimo ridings at the time, created out of the older Nanaimo riding (1871 to 1928), with intermediary ridings The Islands and Nanaimo and the Islands. The name Nanaimo was restored as a riding name in the 1996 election. For other current and historical federal and provincial Nanaimo-area ridings please see Nanaimo (electoral districts). ==Demographics== {| class=\"wikitable\" |Population, 1911 | |- |Population Change, 1891\u20131911 | % |- |Area (km\u00b2) | |- |Pop.

In 1933 there was a Cowichan-Newcastle riding, while in 1937 the riding of Newcastle (southern and upland of metropolitan Nanaimo and the Gulf Islands to the southeast) appeared in the 1916 election, as did a new riding called The Islands which lasted until the 1937 election. Part of that area is now represented by North Saanich and the Islands, which had previously been Saanich and the Islands. ==Current Nanaimo-area Ridings== *Nanaimo 1996\u2013present *Nanaimo-Parksville ==Election results== Note: Winners of each election are in bold. |- |Labour 1 |Thomas Keith |align=\"right\"|Accl. |align=\"right\"| -.- % |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|unknown |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total valid votes !align=\"right\"|n/a !align=\"right\"| -.- % !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total rejected ballots !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Turnout !align=\"right\"|% !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=7|1 The first labour candidates elected to the Legislature.

One newspaper refers to Shepherd as a member of the \"Nanaimo Liberal Party\", another as a nominee of the \"Independent Labour Party\", \"a peculiar combination of Liberal politicians\" (Vancouver Province 29 December 1906, p. 1). Thomas is also reported as a nominee of the \"Independent Labour Party\" in Ladysmith. Shepherd ran as a Liberal in 1912, Thomas as a straight Independent in 1909. |} |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total valid votes !align=\"right\"|1,250 !align=\"right\"|100.00% !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total rejected ballots !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Turnout !align=\"right\"|% !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |} |Liberal |Henry (Harry) Shepherd |align=\"right\"|375 |align=\"right\"|23.82% |align=\"right\"| |align=\"right\"|unknown |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total valid votes !align=\"right\"|1,574 !align=\"right\"|100.00% !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Total rejected ballots !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |- bgcolor=\"white\" !align=\"right\" colspan=3|Turnout !align=\"right\"|% !align=\"right\"| !align=\"right\"| |} The name Nanaimo City was dropped after the 1912 election.
