    "text": "The Political Economy Club was founded in 1909 by John Maynard Keynes. It was an invitation only club, initially held weekly in Keynes' rooms at King's College, Cambridge. Typically a paper would be read then members would comment on its contents. Keynes made his last appearance at the club in February 1946, reading a paper about the future of pound sterling and whether the United States dollar would become scarce. ==Participants== * Maurice Dobb * Ralph George Hawtrey (1879 - 1975) * Harry Gordon Johnson (1923 - 1977) * John Maynard Keynes (1883 - 1946, founder) * Dennis Robertson (president circa 1946) ==References== Category:Political economy Category:Economic history of the United Kingdom Category:Keynesian economics Category:Think tanks based in the United Kingdom Category:Learned societies of the United Kingdom ",
