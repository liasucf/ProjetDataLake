It is located in the Ila area in the city of Trondheim, on the wide isthmus between the river Nid (Nidelva) and the Trondheimsfjord. It is the church for the Ilen parish which is part of the Heimdal og By\u00e5sen (deanery) in the Diocese of Nidaros. The stone church was built in a cruciform style in 1889 by local building company of Digre, according to a design by Trondheim based architect Eugene Sissen\u00e9re (b. 1858). The church seats about 550 people, although it originally fit about 900. The seating was reduced to meet the fire regulations. The building was consecrated on 7 June 1889. The historic organ (18/II/P/M) in the church was built by Claus Jensen (1817-1892) during 1889. It was restored in 2017 by Trondheim based organ building company, Br. Torkildsen Orgelbyggeri A/S. A graveyard belonging to the parish is located at Ilsvika in the neighboring district of Ila, a short distance from the church site. ==See also== *List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag ==References== Category:Churches in Trondheim Category:Churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag Category:Stone churches in Norway Category:19th-century Church of Norway church buildings Category:Churches completed in 1889 Category:1889 establishments in Norway ",
