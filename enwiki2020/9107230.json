Bhuvana is the neglected daughter of a rich man and is in search of true love. Bhuvana is drawn to Ganesh's honesty and good heart. She confesses her love to Ganesh, but he turns her away, saying that a rich girl like her would never be able to live a life of poverty with him. Bhuvana tells Ganesh that she will show him that she can do it and comes to his house with just the clothes on herself. As Bhuvana and Ganesh share a happy love and understanding, life is all roses until a storm disrupts their happiness. Bhuvana meets with an accident and fights for her life. The doctors say that nothing but a heart transplant could save her. Ganesh has no money for the operation and is unable to bear the thought of a life without Bhuvana. Ganesh collects about two lakhs out of three, which is not accepted in the hospital counter. He approaches the hospital MD in his VIP party and causes a ruckus. He gets arrested and is detained in a room.He becomes frustrated, holds the emergency room hostage, and threatens to blow up the 40 people inside. The hostages include the cardiologist who refused to operate on his lover, a minister hiding from journalists, a child suffering from blood leukaemia, an old couple, and a young couple. An accident emergency case occurs, and he opens the emergency room for treatment. The hostages began to doubt his threats. Police rescue fails, and they end up conceding to his demand and operating on Bhuvana. The hostages grow sympathetic to Ganesh's cause and help him and pray for him. The commissioner tries to get even for getting slapped by Ganesh during one of the hostage talks. The commissioner pretends to be an injured victim and enters into the room. The hostages refuse to move out of the room even as Ganesh gets apprehended by the commissioner. Though the hospital had agreed to operate on Bhuvana, no hospital seem to have a matching heart to perform a heart transplant. This is when Ganesh is determined to give her his own heart. He cuts his hand to send for a blood group, and it matches to Bhuvana\u2019s blood group. The doctor refuses to accept the heart of a living person, stating that it is illegal. Ganesh decides to kill himself and sacrifice his life for hers. All the hostages persuade him to find some other way. Ganesh talks to Bhuvana one last time and then commits suicide, thereby giving his heart to Bhuvana. ==Cast== * Narain as Ganesh * Deepa as Bhuvana * Mahadevan as Rangasamy Naidu * Thalaivasal Vijay as Ganesh's father * Kalairani as Ganesh's mother * Nassar as Doctor * Livingston as Gandhi * Ganja Karuppu as Auto Driver * Sriman as Hospital MD * Subbaraju as Police Officer * Sanjeev as Sanjeev * Charle as man with broken arm * Aarthi * Master Mahendran * Rekha Vedavyas (Special appearance) * Seema (Special appearance) ==Soundtrack== Soundtrack was composed by Srikanth Deva.http://starmusiq.com/tamil_movie_songs_free_download.asp?MovieId=480 Rediff wrote that \"If you can forget the remix of old hits, this is not a bad album\".http://www.rediff.com/movies/report/nv/20061206.htm {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\" !
