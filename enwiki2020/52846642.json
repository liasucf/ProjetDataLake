He obtained his MD in neuropathology at the Institute for Brain Research T\u00fcbingen in 1986 supervised by the late Prof. J\u00fcrgen Peiffer. For his initial training in Neurology he moved to the Department of Neurology at the University Hospital D\u00fcsseldorf (with Prof. H.J.Freund). In 1987 he obtained a Research Fellowship from the German Research Council (DFG) for which he joined the Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology in T\u00fcbingen (with Prof. F. Bonhoeffer). In 1988 a Max-Planck-Fellowship was granted and allowed B\u00e4hr to join the Group of the late Prof. R.P. Bunge (Department of Neurobiology) at the Washington University in St. Louis. Back in T\u00fcbingen in 1989 he continued his training in Neurology at the University Hospital T\u00fcbingen (with Prof. J.Dichgans)German Neuroscience Society.
