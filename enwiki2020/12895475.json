Major Grey's Chutney is a type of chutney, reputedly created by a 19th-century British Army officer of the same name who, though likely apocryphal, presumably lived in British India. Its characteristic ingredients are mango, raisins, vinegar, lime juice, onion, tamarind extract (occasionally), sweetening, and spices. It has been described as a mild chutney compared to others that have a spicier flavour profile. In 1982, Major Grey's Chutney was described as being the most popular type of chutney used in the United States. The product is unknown in Britain. ==Commercial varieties== Vegetable samosas with Major Grey's Chutney Commercial Major Grey's Chutney products typically contain similar ingredients, with some variations occurring in the formulations of the various products. ===India=== Major Grey's Mango Chutney is manufactured by Sun Brand in India and by Desai Brothers Ltd. in Pune, India, under the brand name Mother's Recipe, and has been exported to Singapore. ===North America=== A number of manufacturers mass-produce a \"Major Grey's Mango Chutney\" for sale in the United States and Canada, for example Patak's and Sharwood's.
