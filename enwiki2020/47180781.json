    "text": "Marvelyne Fatima Wiels (born 15 May 1963) was the Minister Plenipotentiary of Cura\u00e7ao between 2013 and 2016. In that capacity she was stationed in The Hague and was a member of the Council of Ministers of the Kingdom. ==Personal life== Wiels was born on 15 May 1963 and is a sister of the murdered politician Helmin Wiels. She is a single mother of two children. ==Minister Plenipotentiary== Wiels has received criticism for errors in her CV, amongst others relating to a MSc title, as well as the nature of her work at ABN AMRO. \\- Also her management of the Cura\u00e7aohuis, the representation of Cura\u00e7ao in the Netherlands, which falls under her responsibility, was criticized. Criticism in the latter case was related to nepotism and harassment of her deputy. \\- A report of the Ombudsman of Cura\u00e7ao \\- regarding the criticism resulted in a motion of the parliament of Cura\u00e7ao \"to immediately replace her\" did not gain a majority. \\- During the formation of the second cabinet of Prime Minister Ben Whiteman in November 2015 the Party for the Restructured Antilles (PAR) was willing to join the coalition if Wiels would resign. Wiels' party Sovereign People declined this request. The PAR was then offered the post of deputy Minister Plenipotentiary and it joined the new governing coalition. A fourth report on the functioning of the Cura\u00e7aohuis under Wiels was highly critical. The report, and the fact that it had not been shared yet with the Estates of Cura\u00e7ao, led to coalition parties in the Second Whiteman cabinet voicing severe critique in July 2016. The leader of the PAR, Zita Jesus-Leito, asked for the voluntary resignation or Wiels or else her dismissal by Whiteman. \\- \\- Wiels was succeeded by Eunice Eisden on 23 December 2016. ==References== Category:1963 births Category:Living people Category:Cura\u00e7ao politicians Category:Ministers plenipotentiary (Cura\u00e7ao) Category:Sovereign People politicians ",
