    "text": "Noveltoons was an anthology series of animated cartoons produced by Paramount Pictures' Famous Studios from 1943 to the end of the studio during 1967. The series was known for bringing to life characters from Harvey Comics, such as Casper the Friendly Ghost, Wendy the Good Little Witch, Herman and Katnip, Little Audrey, and Baby Huey. All shorts from Baby Huey and Little Audrey are included. It was the successor to the series Color Classics produced by Fleischer Studios (indeed, several Noveltoons feature characters which originated in Color Classics). This series was also similar to the two series from Warner Bros., Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies, in that it features several recurring characters with one general title. The pre-October 1950 Noveltoons were sold to television distributor U.M. & M. TV Corporation in 1956. National Telefilm Associates acquired them soon afterward, eventually to be returned to Paramount via various transactions over the intervening decades (and today part of the Melange Pictures holdings formerly held by predecessor company Republic). Paramount sold the rest of the Noveltoons to Harvey Comics, which was in turn sold to Classic Media, now owned by DreamWorks Animation, a subsidiary of Comcast's NBCUniversal and currently distributed by Universal Television. Until 1962, newly-produced Noveltoons were also sold to Harvey. Paramount still owns the remaining Noveltoons, but a number of them have entered the public domain. ==List of Noveltoons== *No Mutton fer Nuttin' (1943)First Noveltoon cartoon, and first appearances of Blackie the Lamb and Wolfie Wolf.
