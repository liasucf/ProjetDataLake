    "text": "KN-23 is a designation given to a North Korean solid-fueled tactical ballistic missile. ==Design== The KN-23 bears an external resemblance to the Russian Iskander-M and South Korean Hyunmoo-2B SRBMs, being distinguished by its elongated cable raceway and smooth base. Like the Iskander-M, it flies in a quasi-ballistic trajectory, flattening out below an altitude of about where the atmosphere is dense enough so the missile's fins can change course along its flight path. It is believed to have a range of some 450 km with a 500 kg warhead, putting all of South Korea within range, though it is possible to extend range out to 690 km with a reduced payload; warhead is likely to be unitary, submunition, or possibly nuclear. The KN-23's active steering capability could make it accurate to within 100 meters CEP with satellite guidance, or within 200 meters using INS alone. It is launched from a wheeled transporter-erector-launcher (TEL).KN-23. Missile Threat, Center for Strategic and International Studies.KN-23. Missile Defense Advocacy.North Korea\u2019s New Short-Range Missiles: A Technical Evaluation. 38 North. 9 October 2019. The KN-23 is likely to replace older liquid-fueled North Korean SRBMs like the Hwasong-5 and Hwasong-6. Being road-mobile and solid-fueled, it can be moved and fired more rapidly, making it more difficult for an opposing force to locate and target before firing. Once launched, the missile's low apogee, short overall flight time, and ability to conduct a terminal \"pull-up\" maneuver makes it harder to detect and be intercepted by traditional missile defense systems. Its increased accuracy also reduces the number of missiles that would be needed to destroy a single target. ==History== North Korea first displayed the KN-23 publicly in a military parade on 8 February 2018. The first flight test was on 4 May 2019 near Wonsan, reaching an apogee of 60 km and a range of . Five days later, two more missiles were fired from Kusong, one having a range of and the other of , both with a 50 km apogee. By 17 May, United States Forces Korea had formally designated the weapon as the KN-23. A third flight test was conducted on 25 July 2019, with two missiles again reaching 50 km in altitude but demonstrating greater ranges of and 690 km before landing in the Sea of Japan. A fourth flight test on 6 August 2019 launched two missiles from the country's west coast, overflying the North Korean capital region at an apogee of 37 km out to 450 km. ==See also== *9K720 Iskander *Hyunmoo-2 *KN-24 ==References== ==External links== *KN-23.
