    "text": "Astro Awani is a Malaysian pay television news channel. Its programming consists of news and programs, including current affairs, lifestyle, documentaries, interview programs and a local and international magazine. The channel was launched on 6 September 2007 as part of the revamp of Astro's news division. It is targeted at Malaysia, Brunei and Indonesia. == History == In 2002, the channel was launched as Astro News. During that time, it carried programming from Al Jazeera (broadcast in Arabic with live Malaysian dubbing), BBC World, CCTV-9, Eurosport News, the Australia Network and Deutsche Welle. It also aired Astro News, a half-hour locally produced news program. The five networks carried on that channel were since available separately. Until February 2007, Astro News was co-produced with the national news agency Bernama. The news is also translated into Mandarin Chinese on Astro AEC, Malaysian on Astro Ria and Tamil on Astro Vaanavil. English news was also aired on Astro Prima. Astro Awani was first launched on 15 June 2006 in Indonesia by a joint venture between Astro and India-based NDTV. However, due to continued differences between the JV partners, the Indonesian version went off-air in October 2008. On 6 September 2007, Astro Awani was launched in Malaysia, at the Palace of Golden Horses. In 1 March 2009, Astro Awani replaces Astro News which cancelled its programme at that time due to very low viewers. In June 2018, Astro Awani was named the \u201cmost trusted\u201d Malaysian source of news by The Reuters Institute Digital News Report 2018. == Regular presenters == === Notable personalities === * Kamarul Bahrin Haron * Ashwad Ismail * Nazri Kahar * Rizal Zulkapli * Marlina Manaf * Cynthia Ng * Asyraf Hasnan * Ibrahim Sani * Hafiz Marzukhi * Hakim Rahman * Hilal Azmi * Naila Huda * Geegee Ahmad * Hafizi Rosli * Khairunnisa Kasnoon * Melisa Idris * Isabelle Leong * Hilmi Malik * Luqman Hariz * Najib Aroff * Dzulfirti Yusop * Fauzi Zin * Faris Danial * Afiezy Azaman * Ian Johan Ariff (Bual Bola) * Israr Khalid (Bual Bola) * Essan Yahya * Nursyazwani Saiful Sham * Sharaad Kuttan (Consider This) * Syaff Shukri * Assim Hassan * Jasmine Abu Bakar * Nickyson Nyambar (AWANI Sarawak) * Dr. Nazri Khan (Menang Saham Bersama DDNK) * Raja Hisyam Raja Zaid * Shafizan Johari Source: == See also == * Astro (Malaysian satellite television) == References == Category:24-hour television news channels in Malaysia Category:Television channels and stations established in 2007 Category:Astro Malaysia Holdings television channels ",
