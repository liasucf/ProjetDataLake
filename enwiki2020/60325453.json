    "text": "Sieradz is a railway station located in the Polish town of Sieradz, in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship. It is classified by PKP as a regional station. The station serves mainly regional services between \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Pozna\u0144, as well as PKP Intercity trains running between Warsaw and Wroc\u0142aw. It is also a terminus for \u0141KA services running from \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Kaliska station. The station was opened in 1902, along with other stations of the Warsaw-Kalisz Railway. The architectural style of the main building is similar to the stations in Pabianice, \u0141ask and Zdu\u0144ska Wola. Unlike those, the building is asymmetrical. However, the station is the only existing one between \u0141\u00f3d\u017a and Kalisz that still uses mechanical semaphore signals instead of colour light signals used on other stations. == References == Category:Railway stations in \u0141\u00f3d\u017a Voivodeship Category:Railway stations opened in 1902 Category:Railway stations served by \u0141\u00f3dzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna ",
