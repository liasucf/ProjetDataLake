World Wisdom. 2009. p. 128Linda Kay Davidson and David Martin Gitlitz, Pilgrimage: From the Ganges to Graceland: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1. ABC-CLIO. 2002. p. 302 It was constructed in 836 AD and is considered as the prototype for all the square shaped minarets built in the Western Muslim World. Most ancient, surviving minarets were constructed adjacent to a mosque, for the Muslim call to prayer (Adhan) five times each day by a muezzin (crier). A few minarets were built as watchtowers, landmarks or symbols of victory or glory of a Muslim Khanate or empire. In some instances, like the Minaret of Jam only the minaret tower survives today while the adjoining mosques and other structures were destroyed over time by nature and invaders. ==List of oldest minarets== This list ranks the oldest surviving minarets in the world. Only minarets built before 1900 AD. are included. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:left;\" |- ! Name ! class=\"unsortable\"|Image ! Location !
