After spending three years at Broken Hill, Doyle returned to Sydney and in 2005 was stationed at Campbelltown where he later became the chief inspector of police for the area. ==Political career== In 2011, Doyle contested the normally safe Labor seat of Campbelltown in Sydney's south-western suburbs. Doyle was elected with a swing of 20.5 points and won the seat with 53.4 per cent of the two-party vote. Doyle's opponent was Nick Bleasdale, representing Labor. Graham West who was the previous Labor sitting member had earlier announced his retirement from politics after holding the seat for 10 years. In the 2015 election, Doyle was defeated by Labor's Greg Warren, suffering a 14% two-party preferred swing against him. ==References== Category:Liberal Party of Australia members of the Parliament of New South Wales Category:Members of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly Category:Australian police officers Category:Living people Category:1963 births Category:University of Wollongong alumni Category:21st-century Australian politicians ",
