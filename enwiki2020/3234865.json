Their 7\" record also contains two other covers of Captain Beefheart who, among others, was an inspirational catalyst in the creation of Jack White's distinct musical sound. The recording was released in December 2000 as part of the Sub Pop Singles Club in a limited edition pressing of 1,300 copies on half-red, half-white vinyl. Party of Special Things to Do was reissued by Third Man Records in early 2011 as a part of their Vault subscription service.
