The river is located near the capital of the Central African Republic, Bangui. == Description == It is a small tributary off the Oubangui river, which is a tributary off the larger Congo River. The Mpoko River covers 23,900 km2 of land area and 86% savanna cover. It begins on the Oubangui River near the capital, Bangui, and flows northwest. It drains a savanna dominated ecosystem. == History surrounding Mpoko River == Starting in 1899, the French gave land commissions in the French Congo to 39 companies. The companies had to pay royalties to France and their main objective was the collection of rubber and ivory. One concessionary company called the \"La Mpoko\" was founded on July 10, 1899 with the intention of exploiting a concession that covered the basin of the Mpoko River and the other tributaries. Guilbrand Schi\u00f6tz was appointed head of the company in Bimbo, in 1906 Gaston Guibet was appointed head. The chief of the Bouriki peoples came to Guibet with a complaint, armed company men were demanding more rubber in his village and committing violent crimes. In 1907 Guibet reported to the local judicial authorities the crimes committed by agents under La Mpoko. The agents would take women as hostages demanding certain rubber quotas and beat and kill many people for no apparent reason. Agents stationed there would often rape women while the men were away at work. Schi\u00f6tz resigned and left Africa in 1907 right as Guibet began to start an investigation. The French Congo high commissioner \u00c8mile Gentil asked Paris to shut La Mpoko down but was rejected and the minister in Paris claimed that legal procedures against the company's clients had to be completed first. On April 29, 1909 a persecutor in Brazzaville gave a verdict that relieved the company and clients of their crimes. Due to its bad reputation the La Mpoko concession was revoked in 1910 and the company was liquidated in February 1911. == Turbidity == The Mpoko river was found to have high TSM levels around 78.0 mg L\u22121 contrasting from the low levels ranging around 0.7\u201316.0 mg L\u22121 from more rainforest dominated rivers. TSM levels, standing for total suspended matter, depict how clear the water is in a river. Due to the surrounding savanna ecosystem, the water quality of the Mpoko River is highly turbid and not recommended for drinking. == References == Category:Tributaries of the Ubangi River Category:Rivers of the Central African Republic ",
