Photo by Milit\u00e3o de Azevedo. The station was opened on 16 February 1867, being part of Santos- Jundia\u00ed Railway. At the time, it was named S\u00e3o Bernardo, as the city of Santo Andr\u00e9 didn't exist yet and the closest city was S\u00e3o Bernardo. However, the station was fundamental to what is the city of Santo Andr\u00e9 nowadays. The district was created in 1910 and promoted to city in 1938. However, the old designation was kept until 1934. With the growing of the S\u00e3o Paulo Metropolitain Region, the station was slowly prioritizing the urban trains service. In 1975, from the 6,780,434 passengers of the station, 95% of them were from the called suburban trains. In 1977, the original station was demolished and, in 1979, a new structure was opened, which is the same until nowadays. The trains that stopped by the stations quitted traveling to Santos in 1996. On December 2002, after the murder of Mayor Celso Daniel, the station was renamed after him. ==References== Category:CPTM stations Category:Railway stations opened in 1867 Category:Railway stations opened in 1979 ",
