    "text": "Saweto, also spelled Soweto, is a small village of mostly Ash\u00e1ninka people in Peru. Located within the Ucayali region, the village lies deep in the Peruvian Amazon, on the Alto Tamaya river, near the Brazilian border. The people of Saweto have engaged in a continuous struggle for official title from the Peruvian government to the land they inhabit. This would help enforce against illegal activities, like logging, and encroachment. The village and its struggle gained widespread national and international media coverage following the murder of Saweto's leader, Edwin Chota, and three others, in September 2014, by illegal loggers as they crossed the Brazilian border to meet with leaders of another \u2013 though related \u2013 indigenous community. With increased pressure from the media following these assassinations, the Peruvian government granted legal title to the people of Saweto on January 30, 2015. This land title grants the Ash\u00e1ninka people of Saweto 80,000 hectares, despite strong opposition from pro-logging lobbies, and illegal loggers. ==See also== *Scott Wallace (photojournalist) *Illegal logging *Mahogany *Indigenous peoples *Indigenous and community conserved area *Rainforest Foundation US ==References== ==External links== *Peru at the Climate Crossroads: How Saweto and Indigenous Communities can guide Peru down the right path *Upper Amazon Conservancy - Information on Saweto *Facebook - Title Saweto Campaign Page *Facebook - Title Saweto Campaign Page Category:Illegal logging Category:Upper Amazon Category:Indigenous rights organizations in South America ",
