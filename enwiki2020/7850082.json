Forces under his command accomplished the first major victory of the Constitutional forces against the Federal forces of General Victoriano Huerta's government by taking the city of Matamoros in June 1913.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 25\u201333 In August 1913, he became the first revolutionary to distribute hacienda land to the peasantry.Sapia-Bosch, p. 2 In late 1914, he was the driving force of the moderate generals who wished to bring peace between the victorious Constitutional factions who began quarreling among themselves. His efforts resulted in the Convention of Aguascalientes in October 1914.Sapia- Bosch, p. 124 Lucio Blanco was the son of Bernardo Blanco, and Maria Fuentes, prominent landowners.Sapia-Bosch, p. 1 He attended primary school in Muzquiz, Coahuila, and secondary school in the state capital of Saltillo. He also spent several months in Texas, studying English. He finished his secondary schooling in Monterrey. At the age of twenty, he entered a private college in Torre\u00f3n. He did not graduate, but returned home to manage this parent\u2019s property in Muzquiz.Sapia-Bosch, p. 2 Because of family connections, Blanco became a supporter of Francisco Madero, and in the decade before the revolution, helped set up political clubs of Madero supporters in Coahuila. Blanco also became a supporter of the well-known anarchist Ricardo Flores Mag\u00f3n, and in 1906, attempted to join a Flores Mag\u00f3n rebellion. He was dissuaded however, and returned home.Sapia-Bosch, p. 4 In 1909, he joined the Anti-Reelection Party of Francisco Madero and became active in organizing political rallies. He associated himself with Jes\u00fas Carranza, brother of Venustiano Carranza, and when hostilities broke out in late 1910, Blanco joined the forces of Jes\u00fas Carranza. With the conclusion of hostilities in May 1911, Blanco took a position within the Ministry of Interior of the interim government. Blanco had political disagreements with the Minister of Interior, and so he left the capital and returned to Coahuila.Sapia-Bosch, p. 5 At this time, Venustiano Carranza was the Maderist governor of Coahuila, and he advised Blanco to join the State militia. In early 1912, General Pascual Orozco revolted against the Madero government, and Carranza mobilized the State militia to battle the Orozco forces attempting to operate in Coahuila. Despite having no military training, Blanco impressed his superiors, and by the time hostilities ended in the summer of 1912, Blanco had been promoted to captain.Sapia-Bosch, p. 10 In February 1913, a conservative coup d\u2019\u00e9tat removed Francisco Madero as President and established General Victoriano Huerta as the new President. Governor Carranza of Coahuila elected not to support this new government, and organized a resistance. Lucio Blanco was an early supporter of this revolt, and he received a commission as colonel in the Constitutional Forces.Sapia- Bosch, p. 20 Initially, Governor Carranza attempted to lead his revolt in the field, but his results were not successful. Early successes in this revolt came not from forces under Carranza\u2019s direct command, but other forces in Sonora and Chihuahua. The exception was Lucio Blanco. In April 1913, Blanco had his first battlefield victory when he took the city of Aldamas, Tamaulipas, from forces loyal to Huerta. By the end of the month, he controlled a substantial portion of the country side of the state of Tamaulipas.Sapia-Bosch, p. 21 His most important triumph was the taking of the border city of Matamoros from federal troops on June 4, 1913, the first major victory of the Constitutionalists. His soldiers, however, committed atrocities for which Blanco was blamed.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 25\u201333 Carranza promoted Blanco to the rank of brigadier general for having taken the city of Matamoros, but this early glory was short lived.Sapia-Bosch, p. 38 In July 1913, Carranza appointed Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez commander the new department of the Northeast, bypassing Blanco. Slighted, Blanco refused to cooperate with Gonz\u00e1lez, and remained in Matamoros as a military governor, in command of 1,800 soldiers, most stationed in Matamoros.Sapia-Bosch, p. 40 On August 30, 1913, Blanco, on his own initiative, distributed the lands of the hacienda Los Borregos, belonging to F\u00e9lix D\u00edaz, nephew of the old dictator, to the peons living on the hacienda, thus being the first to implement an agrarian reform distribution in the Revolution.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 49\u201351 For this, Emiliano Zapata wrote to him, congratulating him for his actions; this started a correspondence friendship with Zapata.Sapia-Bosch, p. 52 Carranza, however, was disappointed with Blanco\u2019s action, and accused him of exceeding his authority.Sapia-Bosch, p. 53 As punishment, Blanco was recalled and ordered to Sonora to serve under General \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n. Blanco\u2019s regiment was placed under the command of General Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 59, 63 This action by Carranza prevented Blanco from becoming a national hero, alongside Francisco Villa and Emiliano Zapata. Under Obreg\u00f3n, Blanco was charged to organize and command the cavalry division of the Army of the Northwest. He was at the forefront of all of Obreg\u00f3n\u2019s victories and his principal accomplishments were the taking of the cities of Tepic and Guadalajara, the last one considered to be his greatest triumph after Matamoros.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 82\u201396 About this time, the split between Carranza and Pancho Villa was becoming open and bitter. Villa wrote Obreg\u00f3n explaining his position and asking for his support. Obreg\u00f3n advised Villa not to quarrel with Carranza, and then wrote to Carranza saying that he would support Carranza in his quarrels with Pancho Villa. Blanco objected Obreg\u00f3n\u2019s position.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 91\u201392 A few days later, Obreg\u00f3n shocked Blanco when he said he advocated establishing a new dictatorship, stronger than that of D\u00edaz. \u201cAfter all, D\u00edaz\u2019 only crime was growing old.\u201dSapia-Bosch, p. 93 Still, Blanco rode in alongside Obreg\u00f3n into Mexico City in August 1914 when Huerta and his government collapsed.Quirk, Robert, \u201cThe Mexican Revolution, 1914-1915\u201d, p. 59 The Zapatistas armies also were marching toward the capital. Blanco, being sympathetic to Zapata\u2019s land reform program, gave orders for his forces to receive them cordially. He personally greeted the Zapatistas leaders when they arrived.Sapia-Bosch, p. 110 During the final months of 1914, Blanco was one of the most powerful generals in Mexico City. However, both Carranza and Obreg\u00f3n began to doubt his loyalty, and suspected that he would defect with his army and join Pancho Villa\u2019s forces, and he fell out of favor. This was the beginning of Blanco\u2019s decline. Soon, Carranza considered him untrustworthy, and Blanco\u2019s disagreements with Obreg\u00f3n escalated, especially as a result of his actions during the Convention of Aguascalientes in October.Sapia-Bosch, p. 118 The Convention attempted to establish a new government and asked Carranza to step down. When Carranza refused, the Convention participants split into two factions: the Constitutionalists headed by Carranza and Obreg\u00f3n, and the Conventionists, nominally headed by Eulalio Guti\u00e9rrez, but actually under the control of Villa and Zapata. Blanco elected not to follow Carranza and Obreg\u00f3n and instead aligned himself with the Conventionists and Eulalio Guti\u00e9rrez. Guti\u00e9rrez, however, could not control Villa and Zapata, and so he attempted to force both of them out of his government. Blanco supported Guti\u00e9rrez, and Guti\u00e9rrez lost. Then in late January 1915, Blanco lost the support of Zapata because he refused to attack Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez at Quer\u00e9taro. Zapata asked Villa to arrest and hold him for execution.Quirk, pg. 166 During the first half of 1915, Guti\u00e9rrez, Blanco and several other moderate generals attempted to govern independent of Carranza, Villa and Zapata, but the tide was against them. In June, Guti\u00e9rrez renounced all claims to the presidency and made peace with Carranza. But there was to be no forgiveness for Blanco.Sapia-Bosch, p. 200 In September, he was captured by Obregon\u2019s forces, and tried for treason. He was found guilty of insubordination, and sentenced to five years in prison.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 214\u2013218 Because of animosity between Obreg\u00f3n and Blanco, Blanco remained in prison while Obreg\u00f3n served as Secretary of War. After Obreg\u00f3n retired in May 1917, Carranza arranged for Blanco to be re-tried in September 1917. At this trial, he was acquitted, and after his release, he exiled himself to Laredo, Texas.Sapia-Bosch, p. 224 In November 1919, Carranza recalled Blanco from Texas. Carranza was increasingly fearful that Obreg\u00f3n would turn against him, and he hoped that with Blanco\u2019s support, the army would remain loyal.Sapia-Bosch, p. 230 He acted as a mediator with the Zapata forces and was instrumental in concluding a peace between the Carranza government and Gildardo Maga\u00f1a, Zapata\u2019s successor.Sapia-Bosch, p. 231 As the 1920 election approached, it became apparent that Obreg\u00f3n would run against Carranza\u2019s candidate. Because of the continued animosity between Blanco and Obreg\u00f3n, Blanco supported Carranza against Obreg\u00f3n. In 1920, Obreg\u00f3n and his supporters overthrew the Carranza government. Blanco attempted to flee with Carranza to Veracruz, but when their way was blocked, he parted company with Carranza and fled back to Laredo, Texas. There he joined with other exiles opposed to Obreg\u00f3n, and published pamphlets and conspired to start an armed revolt.Sapia-Bosch, pp. 237\u2013239 Lucio Blanco was last seen alive at a party in Laredo, Texas, in June 1922. The next day, his body was found across the border in Nuevo Laredo. It is generally believed that Mexican secret agents led Blanco to believe that some officers in Nuevo Laredo were eager to have him lead them in a revolt against the Obreg\u00f3n government. Blanco agreed to their proposal, and they crossed the Rio Grande that evening. When they reached the Mexican shore, government agents tried to arrest Blanco. In the ensuing struggle, Blanco was killed.Sapia-Bosch, p. 259 The international airport in Reynosa Tamaulipas is named in his honor. ==References== Category:1879 births Category:1922 deaths Category:Mexican generals Category:Military personnel from Coahuila Category:People of the Mexican Revolution Category:People from Laredo, Texas Category:People acquitted of treason ",
