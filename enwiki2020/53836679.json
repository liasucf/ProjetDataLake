    "text": "Ezekiel 35 is the thirty-fifth chapter of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible or the Old Testament of the Christian Bible. This book contains the prophecies attributed to the prophet/priest Ezekiel, and is one of the Books of the Prophets.Theodore Hiebert et al. 1996. The New Interpreter's Bible: Volume VI. Nashville: Abingdon. This chapter contains a prophecy against Mount Seir in Edom, to the south of Judah. Biblical commentator Susan Galambush pairs it with an oracle promising \"restoration to the mountains of Israel\" in the following chapter.Galambush, S., Ezekiel in Barton, J. and Muddiman, J. (2001), The Oxford Bible Commentary, pp. 556-7 ==Text== The original text was written in the Hebrew language. This chapter is divided into 15 verses. ===Textual witnesses=== Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter in Hebrew are of the Masoretic Text tradition, which includes the Codex Cairensis (895), the Petersburg Codex of the Prophets (916), Aleppo Codex (10th century), and Codex Leningradensis (1008). Fragments containing parts of this chapter were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, that is, the Ezekiel Scroll from Masada (Mas 1d; MasEzek; 1\u201350 CE) with extant verses 11\u201315.Dead sea scrolls - EzekielMas 1d at the Leon Levy Dead Sea Scrolls Digital Library There is also a translation into Koine Greek known as the Septuagint, made in the last few centuries BC. Extant ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint version include Codex Vaticanus (B; \\mathfrak{G}B; 4th century), Codex Alexandrinus (A; \\mathfrak{G}A; 5th century) and Codex Marchalianus (Q; \\mathfrak{G}Q; 6th century). ==Verse 2== : \"Son of man, set your face against Mount Seir and prophesy against it\" (NKJV) * \"Son of man\" (Hebrew: \u05d1\u05df\u05be\u05d0\u05d3\u05dd -): this phrase is used 93 times to address Ezekiel. Galambush suggests that \"the choice of Mount Seir as the counterpart to the mountains of Israel is puzzling\", noting that Ezekiel's oracle against Edom in is \"a brief, virtually pro forma condemnation of Israel's neighbour for taking advantage of Israel's broken condition. The motivation for locating a second, more vehement condemnation here is obscure. ==Verse 10== :Because you have said, \u2018These two nations and these two countries shall be mine, and we will possess them\u2019, although the Lord was there.: NKJV This verse suggests that the Edomites planned to take possession of the promised land, Israel and Judah,Explained in the Expanded Bible at following the Israelites' deportation to Babylon. ==Verse 15== : As you rejoiced because the inheritance of the house of Israel was desolate, so I will do to you; : you shall be desolate, O Mount Seir, as well as all of Edom\u2014all of it! : Then they shall know that I am the Lord.\u201d\u2019 (NKJV) Cross reference: ; ==See also== *Edom *Israel *Mount Seir *Related Bible parts: Genesis 36, Isaiah 34, Jeremiah 49, Lamentations 4, Ezekiel 25, Obadiah ==Notes== ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * * * ==External links== ===Jewish=== *Ezekiel 35 Hebrew with Parallel English *Ezekiel 35 Hebrew with Rashi's Commentary ===Christian=== *Ezekiel 35 English Translation with Parallel Latin Vulgate 35 ",
