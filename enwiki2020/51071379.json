Mejia won the Miss California USA 2016 title in November 2016 after previously competing three times for Miss California Teen USA and making the top twenty at Miss California USA 2015. She went on to represent California at the Miss USA 2016 pageant where she was voted Fan Favourite and made the top five. Mejia's open sharing of her body image struggle was praised as a contributing factor for winning the fan favourite vote, however her failed attempt at answering a question about economics during the interview competition was also widely reported in the media. In 2018, Mej\u00eda was featured in major advertising campaigns for Skechers and Too Faced Cosmetics. == References == Category:American beauty pageant winners Category:American people of Ecuadorian descent Category:Miss USA 2016 delegates Category:1995 births Category:Living people ",
