Logan Jones. In 1895 Jones opened a store at 6th and Main in the River Market neighborhood of Kansas City, Missouri. In 1902 Jones leased a seven-story building that took up an entire block at 12th Street and Main across the street from Bernheimer Bros. & Co. Jones declared bankruptcy in 1910 and the store was taken over by New York interests. In 1919 the new owners acquired the merchandise from Bernheimer Brothers.Crews overcome challenges to demolish Jones Store site - bizjournals.com - October 21, 2005J.
