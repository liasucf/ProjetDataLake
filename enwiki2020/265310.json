    "text": "The Regnitz is a river in Franconia, Germany. It is a left tributary of the Main and is in length. The river is formed by the confluence of the rivers Rednitz and Pegnitz, which meet in the city of F\u00fcrth. From there the Regnitz runs northwards through the cities of Erlangen and Forchheim. It finally meets the Main near the city of Bamberg. Including its source rivers Rednitz and Franconian Rezat, it is long, providing the furthest source (and hence length) of the Main's river system, the largest and longest right bank tributary of the River Rhein. Small portions of the Regnitz near Bamberg are incorporated into a canal connecting the Main with the Danube: the Rhine-Main-Danube Canal, which otherwise runs parallel from Bamberg to F\u00fcrth. Between F\u00fcrth and Forchheim many norias for drawing water up were used from the Middle Ages until the 19th century. Some are still there or were reconstructed. == Sources == *Bogner, Franz X.
