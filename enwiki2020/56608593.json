    "text": "Argiope magnifica is a species of orb web spider found in tropical areas of north-east Queensland, Australia, eastern Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. It is commonly known as the magnificent St Andrew's cross spider. This species is similar in size to the sympatric Argiope keyserlingi; females can be distinguished from those of A. keyserlingi via extensive differences in abdominal colouration and patterns. The males of these two species are almost indistinguishable. Little is known about the biology of Argiope magnifica. However, like most orb-web spiders, males are much smaller than females. Females of this species construct web decorations. As of July 2018, there are thirteen records of Argiope magnifica listed in the Atlas of Living Australia. ==Gallery== Argiope magnifica 5611 (juv dorsal).jpg|A.magnifica juvenile dorsal Argiope magnifica 5617 (juv ventral).jpg|A.magnifica juvenile ventral ==References== magnifica Category:Spiders of Australia Category:Spiders of Asia Category:Spiders described in 1871 ",
