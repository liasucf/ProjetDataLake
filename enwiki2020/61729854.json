    "text": "Trilo is a traditional Swedish folk song that has been arranged by Bengt Oll\u00e9n in 2017. The song is about longing for someone at sea, traditionally sung by Swedish and Norwegian wives as their husbands returned from sea. It has been recorded by Sofia Vokalensemble. The piece was included on the album Song of the North released in March 2018 and Oll\u00e9n's arrangement has been described as \"highly atmospheric music\". Oll\u00e9n's arrangement of Trilo was performed by the Oxford Intermezzo chamber choir as the opening number with the choir distributed around the audience in a \"Songs of the North\" concert at SJE Arts Oxford on 7 September 2019. ==References== ==External links== * S:t Jacobs Vokalensemble performance in Storkyrkan, Stockholm, Sweden, 2017 * Prairie Voices performance in Westminster United Church, Winnipeg, Canada, 2017 Category:2017 songs Category:Swedish folk songs ",
