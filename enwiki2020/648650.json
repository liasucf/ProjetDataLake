    "text": "Livarot is a former commune in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northwestern France. On 1 January 2016, it was merged into the new commune of Livarot-Pays-d'Auge.Arr\u00eat\u00e9 pr\u00e9fectoral 24 December 2015 The population is composed of 2,052 inhabitants (in 2017) and the name of its inhabitants is Livarotais. The town is home to many companies of renown such as the Georges Leroy factory, Graindorge cheese manufacturing which produces Livarot, among others. The commune gave its name to its cheese; Livarot cheese. The La Fermi\u00e8re (CCLF) calvados cider is also produced in the commune. ==Geography== Livarot is situated at the junction of the D4 and D579 roads. The nearest city is Caen, approximately to the north-west. ==Toponymy== The place is attested late in the form Livarrot in 1155,Charte confirmative de Goscelin Crespin et de son fils Guillaume, 1155, in \u00ab Histoire de l\u2019abbaye du Bec \u00bb, \u00c9tudes Lexoviennes I, 1915, p. 656. and Livar(r)ou in 1156 or 1157.L\u00e9opold Delisle, Chronique de Robert de Torigni, abb\u00e9 du Mont-Saint-Michel, Le Brument, Rouen, vol. I, 1872, p. 207; entr\u00e9e concernant l'an 1137. The etymological explanation of this place name has no unanimity among toponymists: *Albert Dauzat and Charles Rostaing, based on a false attestation of Livaron from 1137 (form and date wrong), described it as \"obscure\", while evoking a derivision of ivos, an assumed Gallic word designating if, and declaring it unlikely.Albert Dauzat et Charles Rostaing, Dictionnaire \u00e9tymologique des noms de lieu en France, Librairie Gu\u00e9n\u00e9gaud, Paris, 1989, , p. 406. They perhaps resume in these previous assumptions. In reality, the term *ivos or *\u012bvos is not attested and should include an asterisk. *Ernest N\u00e8gre, reasoning from this same erroneous form, considered that it might be from the Germanic name Liubwar, which is followed by the suffix -o /-onemErnest N\u00e8gre, Toponymie g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la France, vol. II, Librairie Droz, 1990, p. 865. and that the final would be modified by attraction of names in -ot. However, Fran\u00e7ois de Beaurepaire notes that a Germanic name is never used with this suffix.Fran\u00e7ois de Beaurepaire (pr\u00e9f. Marcel Baudot), Les Noms des communes et anciennes paroisses de l'Eure, Paris, A. et J. Picard, 1981 () (OCLC 9675154). *Dominique Fournier refuted Livaron (cacography attributed to Albert Dauzat, and badly dated) and based it on the actual form Livar(r)ou, stemming from the Chronicle of Robert of Torigni, to advance the hypothesis of a Gallo-Roman person named Libarius followed by the suffix of Gallic origin -avo which explains most of the words ending in -ou of Normandy.Dominique Fournier, Les noms de lieux du pays de Livarot; vol. I : communes, anciennes paroisses, principaux cours d\u2019eau, \u00c9ditions des Mortes-Terres, Saint-Georges-en-Auge, 2010, p. 40-42. Information reprise dans Ouest-France, 14 octobre 2010 (l'article n'est plus en ligne), Ouest-France. ==History== ===Battle of Normandy=== On 17 July 1944, the pharmacist and Mayor of Livarot brought first aid to Rommel following the strafing of his car by an Allied aircraft, not far away, between the villages of Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery and Vimoutiers. He was then evacuated, the same day, to the German military hospital in Bernay. Livarot was liberated on 19 August. Following Operation Paddle, the British 7th Armoured Division was on the banks of the . The division then faced a strong resistance by the 272nd Division of the German infantry, but also suffered losses to friendly fire from Allied aircraft. On 19 August, British artillery heavily bombed the area. The British arrived to seize a bridge, which hadn't been destroyed, across the river to Saint-Michel-de-Livet, north of Livarot. The French Resistance then learned that the Germans had abandoned Livarot and that the first British soldiers had entered the same day. ==Heraldry== ==Politics and administration== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\" border=\"1\" |+ List of mayors !
