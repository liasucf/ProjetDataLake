    "text": "Saraswati Shloka is a Hindu prayer chanted before beginning a class or at the beginning of one's studies so that all learning may resolve in knowledge alone. It is addressed to the Goddess Sarasvat\u012b, who symbolizes all forms of knowledge, including the knowledge of the performing arts. Knowledge is a fundamental pursuit of human life, and a life of study and learning provides nourishment and discipline to the human intellect. In the Vedic culture, study is considered one's duty. The Shloka is as follows: sarasvat\u012b namastubhya\u1e43 varade k\u0101mar\u016bpi\u1e47\u012b vidy\u0101rambha\u1e43 kari\u1e63y\u0101mi siddhirbhavatu me sad\u0101 == Translation == O Goddess Saraswathi; salutations to you, the giver of boons, the one who fulfills desires. I shall begin my studies.
