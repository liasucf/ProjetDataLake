Previously known as Pilot, The Pride and Snowfield, the band currently consists of Tom Smith (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Russell Leetch (bass guitar, synthesiser, backing vocals), Ed Lay (drums, percussion, backing vocals), Justin Lockey (lead guitar), and Elliott Williams (keys, synthesisers, guitars, and backing vocals). Editors have so far released two platinum studio albums, and six in total, with several million combined sales. Their debut album The Back Room was released in 2005. It contained the hits \"Munich\" and \"Blood\" and the following year received a Mercury Prize nomination. Their follow-up album An End Has a Start went to number 1 in the UK Album Chart in June 2007 and earned the band a Brit Awards nomination for best British Band. It also spawned another Top 10 hit single, \"Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors\". The band's third album, In This Light and on This Evening, was released in October 2009 and went straight to number 1 in the UK Album Chart. The band released their fourth studio album, The Weight of Your Love, in July 2013, followed by self- produced In Dream in October 2015. In 2018, the band released their sixth album Violence. Alongside their critical acclaim and strong success in the charts, Editors have consistently enjoyed sold-out tours and numerous headlining festival slots. Their brand of dark indie rock is commonly compared to the sound of bands such as Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, Interpol, The Chameleons and U2. ==History== ===Formation (2002\u20132004)=== The band met while studying Music Technology at Staffordshire University, but living in Birmingham and playing at venues such as the Jug of Ale and the Flapper & Firkin, the former of which bands such as Oasis and Blur played in during their primitive years, helped the band obtain a record deal. In an interview in 2015, Tom Smith said, \"Birmingham is very important. Looking back further it was where we all lived together in the early years, played all those Flapper and Jug of Ale shows, and then got our record deal. We've always said although only one of us was brought up there, Birmingham was the band's home\". The band was initially known as Pilot and played its first show under this name in 2002. While in college, the band constructed a marketing strategy which involved placing hundreds of promotional stickers across the walls of Stafford asking \"Who's the Pilot?\". However, they realised the name was already taken by a 1970s Scottish pop group, so they changed their name to The Pride.Interview: Editors (Part IV: Band Origins) , www.bigtakeover.com, 5 September 2006. Retrieved 13 May 2008 They made a promo under this name with the tracks \"Come Share the View\" and \"Forest Fire\" and then uploaded them onto the internet, making the songs available to listen to on BBC Radio 1's Onemusic Unsigned. A review of the songs reads \"The Pride keep things subliminally lo-fi. Refreshingly simple and restrained, \"Come Share The View\" is a lesson in welding hypnotic soundscapes with white noise while showing allegiance to the school of slo-mo on \"Forest Fire\"\". The band then took its music offline to create mystery and anxiousness and ensure that more \"A&R;\" representatives came to see them perform. They then changed the line-up with Ed Lay replacing Geraint Owen on drums as he began to focus on his Welsh band The Heights. Under this lineup they became known as Snowfield. They played their debut gig under this name at the request of Fused Magazine in March 2003. The following summer the band self-released a demo six-track EP, all of which went on to become future Editors songs. Then, as it was the home of their management and the nearest big city, the band relocated to Birmingham after graduation in the autumn of 2003.Ankeny, Jason, Allmusic Editors Full Biography, MTV.com, 12 August 2007.

Through producer Flood's heavy usage of synthesisers, the album provided a synthpop/post-punk sound to Editors' production.

In October 2011, Smith spoke to Q Radio about the new album. \"It's still going to be fairly electronic, I think, compared to our earlier records. So far it feels quite muscular with a bit of swagger and a bit more of a groove. The last record was liberating in lots of different ways and I think we just need to, kind of, build on that..... with a nod to our past as well. It's our fourth record and we don't want to feel like we're doing the same thing again.\" On 22 November 2011, Russell Leetch, the band's bassist posted on the band's official site saying they have seven songs ready to record and some more ideas \"floating around\" and that the album \"will be with you next year.\" On 16 April 2012, it was announced that Chris Urbanowicz had left the group due to a difference in musical direction.

Their influences include Echo & the Bunnymen, Joy Division, The Strokes, The Walkmen, Elbow, and R.E.M.. The band draw their musical style particularly from the latter two bands' debut albums Asleep in the Back and Murmur. While often compared to Joy Division and Echo and the Bunnymen by the media, the band commented that those bands are too old to have a major impact on their musical style. Upon Editors' first appearances in the British music scene, they were also heavily compared to American indie band Interpol.Interpol \u2013 We feel sorry for Editors, www.contactmusic.com, 30 July 2007. Retrieved 28 May 2008 Editors performing in Prague in 2018 Editors' first album, The Back Room, was described as having a wiry and raw sound, which led it to being famously dubbed 'dark disco' by the NME.Cutting-room dancefloor , www.montrealmirror.com, 1 August 2006. Retrieved 23 May 2008 This sound was created by the use of synthesisers, catchy guitar riffs and simple, ambiguous lyrics. An End Has a Start showed progression to a new 'bigger' sound. This new sound was created by adding more textured layers to the songs as well as incorporating new forms of music into them. These include the adding of a choir in \"Smokers Outside the Hospital Doors\" and the inclusion of the sounds of the band playing Hide-and-seek in the song \"Spiders\". Lead singer Smith announced that the band would explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. The new sound materialised itself on the third album through the use of traditional synthesisers instead of the band's previous use of guitars. The producer of In This Light and on This Evening, Flood also increased the importance of \"vibe\" in the music's sound, making it darker than the previous two albums, while also attempting to make the album sound as if it had been recorded live.Radio Interview, Couleur 3, 11 June 2009 While Smith tends to write the lyrics and chords, song writing overall is a collaborative effort. The song writing starts with Smith on the piano or acoustic guitar where he records them and sends them to the other band members where the song is turned into a full 'Editors song'. Smith has said that he purposely makes the lyrics ambiguous so people can draw their own conclusions. \"To us, it's interesting if it has a darkness,\" said Smith in 2015. \"Whatever that is. On the lyric side of things, if I was singing about dancefloors or happier or rosier things, it wouldn't ring true for me. I don't know why that is. People quite often say, 'oh, you write these sad lyrics but you're not a sad person' - and I'm not... I don't think you need to be sad to write a sad song, everybody has a dark side.\" ==Members== Current members *Tom Smith \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, piano (2002\u2013present) *Russell Leetch \u2013 bass guitar, synthesizer, backing vocals (2002\u2013present) *Ed Lay \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals (2003\u2013present) *Justin Lockey \u2013 lead guitar (2012\u2013present) *Elliott Williams \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers, additional guitar, backing vocals (2012\u2013present) Former members *Geraint Owen \u2013 drums (2002\u20132003) *Chris Urbanowicz \u2013 lead guitar (2002\u20132012) Former touring members *Nicholas Willes \u2013 keyboards, synthesizers (2014) ==Discography== Studio albums * The Back Room (2005) * An End Has a Start (2007) * In This Light and on This Evening (2009) * The Weight of Your Love (2013) * In Dream (2015) * Violence (2018) ==References== ==External links== * Editors' official web site * \"Anatomy of a Sound \u2013 Editors' In This Light and on This Evening\" at Bluefat Category:Musical groups established in 2002 Category:English indie rock groups Category:Musical groups from Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Alumni of Staffordshire University Category:Post-punk revival music groups Category:PIAS Recordings artists Category:Epic Records artists Category:2002 establishments in England ",
