Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was Iceland's second businessman worth more than a billion dollars \u2014 his son, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Thor Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfsson being the first. He was at one time the majority owner and chairman of the now nationalised Icelandic bank Landsbanki, the second largest company in Iceland. He was ranked by Forbes magazine in March 2008 as the 1014th-richest person in the world, with a net worth of $1.1 billion.Forbes' Rich List 2008 In December of the same year Forbes revalued his net worth to $0, and on 31 July 2009 he was declared bankrupt by the Icelandic courts with debts of almost \u00a3500 million (96 billion ISK).Icelandic bank chief in \u00a3500m of hot water Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur is a former footballer, furniture packer and law student, a recovering alcoholic of 30 years and an old-fashioned philanthropist. In the 1990s he was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for two years, for bookkeeping offences, having faced around 450 charges. He went to Russia, remade his fortune and returned to Iceland, where he also had interests in shipping, publishing, food, communications and property. ==Early life and marriage== Born in Reykjav\u00edk, Iceland, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur's parents were Gu\u00f0mundur P\u00e9tur \u00d3lafsson (1911\u201379) and Krist\u00edn Dav\u00ed\u00f0sd\u00f3ttir.http://www.visir.is/bjorgolfur-gudmundsson ---fra-upphafi-til-enda/article/2009796238314; http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/1499064/ Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur has an elder brother, Dav\u00ed\u00f0, and three sisters.Ingi Freyr Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Hamskiptin: \u00deegar allt var\u00f0 falt \u00e1 \u00cdslandi (Reykjav\u00edk: Ver\u00f6ld, 2014), p. 53.Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, Billions to Bust\u2014And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way (London: Profile, 2014), p. 20. By the account of Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur's son, he was from a working-class background, and his father Gu\u00f0mundur was affected by a stroke around 1945. The young Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur graduated from the Commercial College of Iceland in 1962,'Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0mundsson', St\u00fadentafagna\u00f0ur 2012, . was an organiser of the Independence Party youth wing and is described by Roger Boyes as 'a promising young man, handsome, clean- cut, with reasonable English and a smooth, reassuring manner.'.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64, 71. 76. Accounts vary, but it has been claimed that in 1958 Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was asked by the family of Thor Philip Axel Jensen, Iceland's foremost businessman of the time, to accompany Hallgr\u00edmur Fr. Hallgr\u00edmsson to the USA to bring back Hallgr\u00edmur's daughter Margr\u00e9t \u00de\u00f3ra Hallgr\u00edmsson, who had left her first marriage to Haukur Clausen to marry the American Nazi George Lincoln Rockwell.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 63-64; Ingi Freyr Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Hamskiptin: \u00deegar allt var\u00f0 falt \u00e1 \u00cdslandi (Reykjav\u00edk: Ver\u00f6ld, 2014), p. 55. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur's son suggests, however, that the two met only after \u00de\u00f3ra's return to Iceland following her split with Rockwell.Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, Billions to Bust\u2014And Back: How I Made, Lost and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way (London: Profile, 2014), p. 19. Either way, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur married \u00de\u00f3ra in 1963 and adopted her children by Clausen (\u00d6rn Fri\u00f0rik, b. 1951) and Rockwell (Hallgr\u00edmur, b. 1954; Margr\u00e9t, 1955\u201389; and Evelyn Bent\u00edna).http://www.mbl.is/greinasafn/grein/286017/ The couple subsequently had a child of their own, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Thor Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfsson (b. 1967). From 1962 to 1977, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was the founder and director of D\u00f3sager\u00f0in hf.; from 1977 to 1986 he was the director of Hafskip, with further responsibilities for its various daughter companies in the Europe and the USA. During much of this period, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was, in the estimation of his son Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Thor, 'a highly functional alcoholic', but went into rehab in Hazelden, Minnesota, in 1978 and has not drank since.Thor Bjorgolfsson and Andrew Cave, Billions to Bust\u2014and Back: How I Made, Lost, and Rebuilt a Fortune, and What I Learned on the Way (London: Profile, 2014), pp. 13-15. ==Hafskip affair== The shipping business Hafskip was the main competitor to Iceland's established shipping operator Eimskip (co-founded by the father of Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur's wife). In Roger Boyes's account, :: initially there was more than enough business for both shipping companies, transporting supplies to the U.S. base. But when an American company started to compete on the route, Hafskip floundered. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur borrowed to expand, but in the early 1980s\u2014without a bank in his pocket or sophisticated financial instruments available\u2014he struggled to keep the cash flow going. According to Illugi J\u00f6kulsson, who has written a book about the Hafskip affair, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was suddenly undermined when his bank, \u00datvegsbankinn, declared his company in default on its loans.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-65. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was prosecuted for bookkeeping irregularities, receiving a twelve-month suspended jail sentence, but in Illugi J\u00f6kulsson's interpretation, this :: was a crude act to dispose of an Eimskip rival (which later took on Hafskip\u2019s ships). More, it was an attempt by the Progressive Party to profit from the downfall of a man who was so clearly aligned with the Independence Party'.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 65. The affair had a considerable effect on Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur and his son, and both at times portrayed their subsequent business activities as a way to take revenge on the people they saw as their persecutors and to regain their reputations.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 64-66. One of the avenues through which Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur worked to restore his reputation in the years following the Hafskip affair was by starting a successful alcoholics' rehabilitation centre in Reykjav\u00edk.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), p. 66.'\u00deeir bygg\u00f0u Vog og r\u00e9\u00f0u \u00de\u00f3rarin' (5 August 15). From 1986 to 1991, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur was the director and owner of Icestar Ltd. in Copenhagen and a consultant on the shipping business for AMA Agencies in London. ==Beverage businessman in Saint Petersburg== In 1991, in the wake of the Hafskip affair, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur began running the brewery and soft drinks unit of Pharmaco, a pharmaceuticals group, in 1991. In the early 1990s Pharmaco was required to sell off its unneeded bottling machines, and Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur took the opportunity, through a partner, Ingimar Haukur Ingimarsson, who was already based in St Petersburg, to co-found Bravo Brewery with Magn\u00fas \u00deorsteinsson (chairman of Avion Group) and Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur's own son Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Thor. Notwithstanding legal wrangles with Ingimar Haukur, Bravo Brewery became a success.Roger Boyes, Meltdown Iceland: Lessons on the World Financial Crisis from a Small Bankrupt Island (New York: Bloomsbury, 2009), pp. 67-68. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0mundsson and his son later sold the venture to Heineken for $400 million which they invested both in Iceland and abroad. Danish journalists noted that in St. Petersburg, the Committee on External Economic Relations in Saint Petersburg's Mayor's office was responsible for foreigners in Saint Petersburg. The committee's chairman was Vladimir Putin.. Another copy: . An automatic translation: The Icelandic businessmen, together with Russian partners, founded the bottling company Baltic Bottling Plant, which was sold to Pepsi. They moved to brewing and founded the brewing company Bravo International OOO in August 1996 which became Bravo International JSC in December 1997. Bravo Brewery became a success with the premium beer Botchkarov. In 2005 an article in The Guardian wondered where the Icelandic money comes from and noted that in the 1990s the three Icelandic businessmen \"were not only ploughing money into the country but doing it in the city regarded as the Russian mafia capital. That investment was being made in the drinks sector, seen by the mafia as the industry of choice.\" Competitors in the St. Petersburg brewing market faced problems. Ilya Weismann, deputy director of competing beverage company Baltic, was assassinated on 10 January 2000. Soon afterwards Baltic director general Aslanbek Chochiev was also assassinated. One competing St Petersburg brewery burned to the ground. The company became the fastest growing brewery in Russia. Heineken bought the extraordinarily successful brewery for $400m in 2002 and Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur returned to Iceland.Ingi Freyr Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Hamskiptin: \u00deegar allt var\u00f0 falt \u00e1 \u00cdslandi (Reykjav\u00edk: Ver\u00f6ld, 2014), p. 54. ==The boom years: chairman of Landsbanki== Late in 2002, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Thor Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfsson and Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0mundsson's holding company Samson ehf. gained 45% controlling share of Landsbanki, Iceland's second largest bank, for about 12.3 billion ISK in a controversial privatization.Gu\u00f0mundur Magn\u00fasson, Thorsararnir: au\u00f0ur \u2013 v\u00f6ld \u2013 \u00f6rl\u00f6g (Reykjav\u00edk: Almenna b\u00f3kaf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, 2005), p. 354; Questions over Landsbanki's new shareholder /Euromoney magazineIcelandReview - Online, Iceland News, Travel, Vacation, Culture, Hotels, Politics, Business The board was announced in February 2003, with the chairman being Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0mundsson.Gu\u00f0mundur Magn\u00fasson, Thorsararnir: au\u00f0ur \u2013 v\u00f6ld \u2013 \u00f6rl\u00f6g (Reykjav\u00edk: Almenna b\u00f3kaf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, 2005), p. 354 Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur became famous and very popular in Iceland during this time as the country's leading philanthropist, both through the direct contributions of himself and his wife \u00de\u00f3ra, and through contributions made by Landsbanki (where he started a special service at Landsbanki with the tag \"Give help to a good cause\"): 'dressed in his trademark pin-striped suits he came to be Iceland\u2019s greatest philanthropist, loved by the public, and was for a while perhaps more influential in the island\u2019s cultural life than even the Minister of Culture, who in effect was downgraded to second fiddle in many opening ceremonies'.Eir\u00edkur Bergmann, Iceland and the International Financial Crisis: Boom, Bust and Recovery (Basingstoke: Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), p. 72.

Particularly since the 2008 economic crash, however, it has been pointed out that by accident or design this massive patronage of the artistic and intellectual life of Iceland tended to silence critical commentary on the banking boom, helping to cause the collapse.Ingi Freyr Vilhj\u00e1lmsson, Hamskiptin: \u00deegar allt var\u00f0 falt \u00e1 \u00cdslandi (Reykjav\u00edk: Ver\u00f6ld, 2014), pp. 67-82, 165-206. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur's use of sponsorship of the cultural sector to win public approval of himself and his businesses extended to buying influence in the media. In 2002, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur took a 68% in Iceland's biggest publisher, Edda.Magn\u00fas \u00de\u00f3r Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rnsson, 'Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfskvi\u00f0a- e\u00f0a listaverki\u00f0 a\u00f0 lokinni fj\u00f6ldaframlei\u00f0slu sinni: Sm\u00e1saga me\u00f0 myndum og ne\u00f0anm\u00e1lsgreinum', Kistan (18 October 2008), When, in 2005, Gu\u00f0mund Magn\u00fasson published the book Thorsararnir, on the history of the descendants of Thor Jensen.Thorsararnir: au\u00f0ur \u2013 v\u00f6ld \u2013 \u00f6rl\u00f6g (Reykjav\u00edk: Almenna b\u00f3kaf\u00e9lagi\u00f0, 2005). In the first version of the book was a chapter on \u00de\u00f3ra's marriage with Rockwell. The book was published by the press Edda, but Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur, who owned the publisher, had the author change the text, and had the whole first print run destroyed.'Chairman of Landsbanki burning books?', Iceland Review (5 December 2005, updated 30 January 2014). Moreover, he tried to buy the newspaper Dagbla\u00f0i\u00f0-V\u00edsir, which had discussed the matter, in order to close it down.Ritsko\u00f0ari einokar dagbla\u00f0amarka\u00f0.

After the almost total collapse of the Icelandic banking system in 2008, Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur Gu\u00f0mundsson was pointed out as one of the main players behind the Icelandic economic disaster in all Icelandic media including the Icelandic National Broadcasting Service (RUV) and all major newspapers. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur declared his personal bankruptcy in 2009, owing $750m, $500m of which he owed to Landsbanki. This seems to have been the world's biggest recorded personal bankruptcy.Thorvaldur Gylfason, 'Iceland: How Could This Happen?', CESifo Working Paper no. 4605, Category 6: Fiscal Policy, Macroeconomics and Growth (January 2014), p. 9; https://notendur.hi.is/gylfason/cesifo1_wp4605.pdf In 2010, Time magazine named Bj\u00f6rg\u00f6lfur as one of their hundred most influential people in the world for his role in the Icelandic crash.Bj\u00f6rn \u00de\u00f3r Sigbj\u00f6rnsson, Bergsteinn Sigur\u00f0sson, and others, \u00cdsland \u00ed aldanna r\u00e1s, 2001-2010: Saga lands og \u00fej\u00f3\u00f0ar \u00e1r fr\u00e1 \u00e1ri (Reykjav\u00edk: JPV, 2012), p. 408. ==Other businesses 2002-2008== Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur called 75 organisations to his meeting and gave each one 1 million ISK. Bj\u00f6rg\u00f3lfur has been a keen football fan for years and led the consortium which bought the English Premier League football club West Ham United. He bought 90% of the club himself and became the club's Honorary Life President in June 2006, alongside Eggert Magn\u00fasson who became Chairman.
