    "text": "Smiljan () is a village in the mountainous region of Western Lika in Croatia. It is located northwest of Gospi\u0107, and fifteen kilometers from the Zagreb- Split highway; its population is 418 (2011). Smiljan is the birthplace of inventor and engineer Nikola Tesla. ==Geography== It consists of eighteen scattered hamlets (Ba\u0107inac, Bogdani\u0107, \u010covini, Debelo Brdo, Dra\u017eica, Kolakovica, Kova\u010devi\u0107i, Ljuta\u010da, Milkovi\u0107a Varo\u0161, Milja\u010da, Mi\u0161kulin Brdo, Podkr\u010dmar, Rasova\u010da, Rosulje, Smiljan, Smiljansko Polje, Vaganac). Smiljan resort is located in the central part of the Velebit-Lika plain, on the western edge of the field at the foot of the hill Kr\u010dmar. It consists of twelve villages which makes the spatial and functional unit. In the surroundings are Hill-forts Bogdani\u0107, Smiljan and Kr\u010dmar, prehistoric tombs, the churches of St. Anastasia, St. Mark and St. Vitus. It got its name from the fort Smiljan which ruins are located at hill Vekavac. ==History== The oldest traces of settlement on the ground of Smiljan are dating from the Middle and Late Bronze Age. On the hillfort Miljac once was situated necropolis, and were found numerous remains of Iapodian culture. The origin of the name Smiljan is not fully certain. It is commonly believed to be derived from smilje, the name for the Helichrysum plant. However, Croatian linguist Petar \u0160imunovi\u0107 believed Smiljan is patronymic in origin. Another hypothesis focuses on milja, Croatian for \"mile\", present in other toponyms such as Milja\u010da hill, which suggests a connection with a nearby merchant road. The area of Smiljan was controlled by the Ottoman Empire between 1527\u20131686, after which the Ottoman rule was expelled from those parts by counts Jerko Rukavina and Dujam Kova\u010devi\u0107. Until that time the Ottoman aghas, Rizvan and Zenkovi\u0107, from Novi near Gospi\u0107 had estates in Smiljan, Bu\u017eim and Trnovac. After the defeat of the Ottomans in Lika, most of the Bunjevci (Roman Catholic Vlachs who spoke Western Herzegovinian subdialect of Neo-Shtokavian with Ikavian accent) migrated to Lika, including Smiljan between 1683\u201387. A 1700 church register listed 17 Serbian Orthodox families in the village, who had settled during the Great Turkish War. Villages and hamlets in Lika and Krbava were divided according to religious confession, Serbian Orthodox Vlachs lived in the hamlets of Seli\u0161te, Ljuta\u010da and Bogdani\u0107 at that time. In 1708 the Roman Catholic parish of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was founded. There is a small chapel, Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. The Serbian Orthodox church of St. Peter and Paul was built in 1765; it is now a branch of a parish in Gospi\u0107. The re-construction of the Catholic parish church of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was started in 1860, and finished 1864. In 1830 a minor school was founded. During World War II, the town was occupied by Axis troops and was included into the Paveli\u0107's Independent State of Croatia (NDH). The fascist Ustashe regime committed the Genocide of the Serbs and the Holocaust. The house in which the inventor Nikola Tesla was born, as well as the Serbian Orthodox church in which his father had served as a priest, were destroyed by the Ustashe movement in 1941. During the same period, the Usta\u0161e also established a concentration camp in Smiljan through which 5,000 inmates passed. The camp was part of a wider network of Usta\u0161e concentration camps centred around the town of Gospi\u0107. ==Demography== The village of Smiljan (with Bru\u0161ane and O\u0161tarije) was incorporated to the Croatian Military Frontier only in 1713 (after being separated from the city of Karlobag), and subsequently registered in the 1712/14 census done in Lika and Krbava. In 1712/14 there were 1,405\u20131,536 people, with 1,153\u20131,283 people land owners, 117 landless (with Bru\u0161ane), with average 1.33 acre per individual, 120\u2013139 families who were land owners, with average 9.6 members in family.Most of them were Roman Catholic Vlachs ie Bunjevci (1,312), then Serbian Orthodox Vlachs (208), and Carniolians (16). There were 103 Roman Catholic, and 17 Serbian Orthodox families. Some of the most numerous families (actually kind of tribe- collective) in Lika and Krbava were in Smiljan; of count and captain Nikola Rukavina Bevandi\u0107 (56 members), Dujam Kova\u010devi\u0107 (50), Ivan Dev\u010di\u0107 (46), Mijat Lemaji\u0107 (40), Juri\u0161a Pavi\u010di\u0107 (40), Milanko Pejnovi\u0107 (40), Petar Serdar (40), Ilija Brklja\u010di\u0107 (30), and Anton Tomljenovi\u0107 (30). In 1746 there lived 2,149 people, with 2,144 people land owners, and 290 families of land owners. 206 houses existed in 1830, with 1,880 people, of whom 1,401 Roman Catholic, and 479 Orthodox faith.

Today, Tesla's birth house, together with the Serbian Orthodox church of St. Peter and Paul (built in 1765) and the surrounding area, make up a memorial complex. There are various exhibits of Tesla's inventions and a museum where the details of the inventor's life are shown. There is also a congress hall in a nearby building. The original memorial complex was built in 1956. In 1992, during the Croatian War of Independence, several of the buildings were severely damaged by fire due to shelling. The Croatian authorities restored the complex and reopened it in a 2006 ceremony, with the highest dignitaries of Croatia and Serbia attending. ==Notable people== * Nikola Tesla (1856\u20131943) \u2013 inventor and electrical engineer.
