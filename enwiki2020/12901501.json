In June 2004, he announced a procedure utilizing titanium/polypropylene mesh inserts to perform breast reconstruction, anchoring the \"internal bra\" to the ribs and muscle tissue. The procedure has been used on at least three dozen women to date. Medical evidence regarding the safety of this procedure is still being compiled; however the technique of using titanium/polypropylene mesh in reconstructive surgery for hernias has been in use in Europe for years, and is approved for use for this purpose in the United States. ==References== ==External links== * European Academy of Cosmetic Surgery - official website Category:Turkish plastic surgeons Category:Living people Category:Year of birth missing (living people) ",
