    "text": "Janina Oyrzanowska-Poplewska (2 May 191816 July 2001) was a Polish academic and veterinarian. A professor at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences, she specialized in epizootiology but her main area of research concerned viral diseases of canines, which led to the development of the first vaccine for canine distemper in Poland. During World War II, she was involved with Polish resistance, and her family helped a number of refugees. In 1981, she was honored as a Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem for her efforts to save Jews during the Holocaust. ==Early life== Janina R\u00f3\u017ca Oyrzanowska was born on 2 May 1918 in Warsaw, during the German Regency Kingdom of Poland to Maria El\u017cbieta (n\u00e9e Czarnecka) and Kazimierz Oyrzanowski. Her were Polish nobles, bore the Junosza coat of arms, and owned the Golebie estate near Pu\u0142tusk. She was the great granddaughter of Robert Fryderyk Stichel, the first person to earn a master's degree in Poland in veterinary science. Oyrzanowska completed her high school education in 1936 and began taking courses at the faculty of veterinary medicine at the University of Warsaw. Her studies were interrupted by the German invasion of Poland in September 1939. Oyrzanowska married the veterinarian Mieczys\u0142aw Poplewski (1916\u20131940), who would join the Polish Land Forces at the outset of World War II. Poplewski was a second lieutenant of the and was executed by the NKVD in 1940 near Kharkiv when the Soviet forces invaded Poland and carried out the Katyn massacres. During the war, Oyrzanowska lived with her mother, younger sister Maria, and older brother Kazimierz in an apartment in Warsaw. They also had other apartments in the city and a small summer hut on a piece of land they rented for truck farming in the Czerniak\u00f3w neighborhood. Her family became involved with the Polish resistance from October 1939, and one of their family apartments hosted an underground printing press and document forgery studio. They helped Jews during the war, including their neighbors, the Linfeld and Sterling families; their gardener, Jerzy Glinicki; and others, including Wiktoria Szczawi\u0144ska and Franciszka Tusk Scheinwechsler (during the war known as Natalia Obr\u0119bka). Maria, who had just completed her secondary education, and Oyrzanowska, who was attending university, grew flowers and vegetables to support the family. They moved the Jews they were helping, hiding them in their various homes, ensuring that each of them survived the war. Her family also offered hiding places to other refugees, including escaped Soviet prisoners of war. For their efforts, her sister Maria was arrested by the Germans in 1942 and from March to September that year was incarcerated in the Pawiak Prison. Eventually, the family escaped Warsaw in the latter stages of the Warsaw Uprising. ==Career== Following the end of the war, Oyrzanowska studied at the Maria Curie- Sk\u0142odowska University in Lublin before returning to the reopened Warsaw University, where she received her degree as a doctor of veterinary studies in 1950. She was working in a professional capacity from 1947. In 1960 she received a PhD degree, and in 1967, she did her habilitation. In 1978 she received the title of associate professor (profesor nadzwyczajny) at the Warsaw University of Life Sciences. At the beginning of her career, Oyrzanowska focused on viral diseases of dogs and foxes, such as canine distemper and , which had been discussed in her PhD thesis Rozpoznanie serologiczne nos\u00f3wki i epizootycznego zapalenia w\u0105troby u ps\u00f3w i lis\u00f3w (Serological Diagnosis of Distemper and Epizootic Hepatitis in Dogs and Foxes, 1960). Her work resulted in the development and production of the first Polish vaccine for canine distemper. She also conducted research to determine the necessary dosage for preventive vaccination against rabies. Other notable research by her concerned the topics of the pseudorabies, as well as of the bovine alphaherpesvirus 1. Oyrzanowska was a co-author of a textbook Choroby mi\u0119so\u017cernych zwierz\u0105t futerkowych (Diseases of carnivorous fur animals). She was a member of the and and in the latter, she was a director of its Warsaw and epizootiology sections. In 1980, Oyrzanowska, along with other academics joined in the founding of the Independent Self-Governing Trade Union of Science, Technology and Education Workers (, NSZZ PNTiO). At their first meeting, they agreed to join their trade union with Solidarity in an effort to push forward the democratization process. Throughout her career, Oyrzanowska received several awards, including the Golden Cross of Merit, Knight's Cross of the Order of Polonia Restituta, and the . Based on the account of Franciszka Tusk Scheinwechsler, on 6 June 1981, Oyrzanowska and her sister, Maria, were recognized by Yad Vashem as Righteous Among the Nations. ==Death and legacy== Oyrzanowska-Poplewska's tombstone Oyrzanowska died on 16 July 2001 in Warsaw and was buried in the Pow\u0105zki Cemetery. ==Selected works== * * * * * * * == References == ===Citations=== ===Bibliography=== * * * * * * * * * * Category:1918 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century Polish scientists Category:20th-century women scientists Category:Burials at Pow\u0105zki Cemetery Category:Knights of the Order of Polonia Restituta Category:Maria Curie-Sk\u0142odowska University alumni Category:Physicians from Warsaw Category:Polish medical researchers Category:Polish resistance members of World War II Category:Polish Righteous Among the Nations Category:Polish veterinarians Category:Polish women scientists Category:Recipients of the Gold Cross of Merit (Poland) Category:University of Warsaw alumni Category:Warsaw University of Life Sciences faculty Category:Women medical researchers ",
