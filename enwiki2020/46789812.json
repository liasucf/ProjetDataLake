The festival is hosted by Denizli municipality and Turkish Radio and Television Corporation. Unlike T\u00fcrkvizyon, a similar contest hosted by TRT, T\u00fcrk\u00e7evizyon is not solely competitive, during the festival, concerts and other cultural activities are also scheduled. The Gala night is located in Pamukkale Antique Theatre, and all participants sing only in Turkish language. The festival aims to emphasize the importance of Turkish, however it is widely criticized for having \"-vision\" or \"festival\" words, which are not Turkish originated. The festival, as well as Turkvizyon contest, are both considered as a Turkish alternative to Eurovision Song Contest, which Turkey is inactive since 2012. The festival logo contains a rooster, which is the symbol of Denizli. == Years == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Edition !! Year !!
