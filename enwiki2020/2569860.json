    "text": "Cyclobutene is a cycloalkene. It is of interest in research, but has currently no practical applications. It is a colorless easily condensed gas. A modern synthesis involves the 2-step dehydration of cyclobutanol. The compound was first prepared by thermolysis of the ammonium salt [C4H7NMe3]OH. Cyclobutene thermally isomerizes to 1,3-butadiene. This strongly exothermic reaction reflects the dominance of ring strain. In contrast, the corresponding equilibrium for hexafluorocyclobutene disfavors hexafluorobutadiene. == See also == * Cyclobutane * Cyclobutadiene * Cyclobutyne * Squaric acid == References == Category:Monomers ",
