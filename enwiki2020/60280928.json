    "text": "Ana Shalikashvili (; February 16, 1919, Kutaisi \u2013 March, 2004, Tbilisi) was a Georgian painter. In 1937\u20131942 she studied oil painting under the guidance of David Kakabadze and Valerian Sidamon-Eristavi and drawing under the tutorship of Tamar Abakelia and Sergo Kobuladze at the Tbilisi State Academy of Arts, and later went on to work at the Kutaisi Theater. After having returned to Tbilisi in 1947, she was employed by the Georgian Film Studio as an animator at first and then as an art director. In the 1950s, she carried out productive work in the area of illustrations for children's books. In the late 1950s, Ana Shalikashvili, on Elene Akhvlediani's invitation, joined a group of artists who traveled throughout Georgia and, based on their immediate impressions, created sketches of landscapes characteristic of different regions, and drawings portraying Old and New Tbilisi. Shalikashvili's oil and graphic compositions boast expressive imagery and high-level artistic skills. Ana Shalikashvili, along with other artists from Elene Akhvlediani's group, fostered the creative development of female Georgian graphic artists. ==References== Category:1919 births Category:2004 deaths Category:20th-century women artists Category:20th-century painters from Georgia (country) Category:People from Kutaisi Category:Women painters from Georgia (country) ",
