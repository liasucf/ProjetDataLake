The first of four consecutive tropical cyclones to strike the Philippines, a tropical disturbance became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into Tropical Storm Muifa in the early of the 15th when centered east-southeast of Manila, the Philippines. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130 mph (115 knots), still to the east of the Philippines. Unding, as PAGASA named it, made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80 mph (70 knots). The storm briefly lost typhoon strength for a day until it regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea on the 21st. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250 nm south of Bangkok, Thailand. Later that day Muifa turned northward into an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated south-southwest of Bangkok. The highest 24-hour rainfall amount from the Philippines was 246.4 mm at Catanduanes between midday the 15th and 16th. The death toll reported from the Philippines was 68 dead, 160 injured, and 69 unaccounted for. A total of 26,238 houses were destroyed and 76,062 damaged; total damage reached $1.01 billion pesos ($17.96 million 2004 USD). The highest 24-hour rainfall amount reported in Thailand was 251.5 mm at the Prachuap Khiri Khan airport between the afternoon of the 25th and 26th. Floods and landslides triggered by the typhoon killed about 40 people, and 42 more people were reported missing.Monthly Global Tropical Cyclone Summary November 2004 ==Meteorological history== The disturbance that was to become Muifa can be traced back to the afternoon of November 12, when a weak low-pressure system formed over the Western Marianas.::..Typhoon2000.com: Michael Padua's Full Detailed Report on Typhoon MUIFA (UNDING) ..:: It became Tropical Depression 29W on November 14 and strengthened into a tropical storm while moving north-northwestward by early November 15, when centered east-southeast of Manila, Philippines. PAGASA assigned the name Unding to the cyclone on the 14th as it passed the 135th meridian. The storm's forward speed suddenly decreased from 28 km/h to 13 km/h when it entered an area of weak steering flow in between a high-pressure ridge in development centered over China and a high-pressure ridge weakening south of Japan. On the 16th, the tropical cyclone started drifting north-northeast. Muifa turned back onto a west-northwest heading and intensified. It reached typhoon intensity on the 17th just prior to beginning a two-day clockwise loop. Late on the 18th, Muifa's intensity peaked at 130 mph (115 knots) with a minimum central pressure of 955 mbar (hPa), still to the east of the Philippines. Muifa made landfall very late on the 19th near Naga City with maximum winds of 80 mph (70 knots). The system ambled across the Philippine Archipelago, dropping down to tropical storm intensity on the afternoon of the 20th. Shortly after Unding left the country, on the 22nd,TRMM Tropical Depression MerbokRed Cross Red Crescent - Appeals (Violeta)Over 30 killed as typhoon smashes into Philippines passed over Luzon. Only five days after that, Tropical Depression Winnie hit Luzon. Luzon was hit a third time by Typhoon Nanmadol on December 2. The Philippines being struck by four tropical systems so close together is a very rare event, and also very damaging. On the 21st, Muifa regained typhoon intensity in the South China Sea. Now moving west- southwest, early on the 22nd Muifa re-strengthened into a 105 mph (90 knots) typhoon east of Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Muifa held onto typhoon status until late on the 23rd when its weakened to a tropical storm once more. At this point, it was forecast by the JTWC that Muifa would strike the southern tip of Vietnam with 65 mph (55 knots) sustained winds. From there, it would restrengthen to typhoon strength and pass over Thailand and enter the Indian Ocean, slowly weakening as it heads into the Bay of Bengal.Death toll rises from floods rises to 60 in northern Philippines in wake of Typhoon Muifa This did not happen, though. On the 25th, Tropical Storm Muifa accelerated westward at a 23 mph (21 knots) clip. By early on the 26th, a weakening Tropical Depression Muifa was located 250 nm south of Bangkok, Thailand. It was still forecast by the JTWC that the depression would enter the Andaman Sea, though much weaker than it was previously forecast, and later strike India as a 40 mph (35 knots) tropical cyclone.Typhoon Muifa Once again, this did not occur. Later that day, Muifa turned northward instead and entered an environment of increased wind shear and dissipated 120 nm south-southwest of Bangkok. But according to the Thailand Meteorological Department (TMD) advisories, Tropical Depression Muifa made landfall near Amphoe Ko Pha Ngan, Surat Thani Province at around 1500 UTC on the 25th with winds of 35 mph (30 knots). ==Preparations== Clark Air Base, an American air base on Luzon, had some 70 United States Marines and others evacuated to Okinawa via plane.
