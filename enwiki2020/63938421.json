    "text": "In 1944, an uprising took place in Kivu in the eastern Belgian Congo. The cause of the revolt laid in Belgian authority's taxation and communal labor policies, which the Watchtower Movement denounced as ungodly. The revolt, which took place in spring, was a \"bitter showdown\" and resulted in hundreds of blacks and three whites killed. The leader of the revolt was hanged. == References == Category:Revolts Category:Belgian Congo in World War II Category:1944 in Africa Category:Conflicts in 1944 ",
