    "text": "Hornsey Train Maintenance Depot, main building (2008) The area around Hornsey railway station in Hornsey (London Borough of Haringey) has been the site of several railway maintenance facilities from the mid 19th century onwards. Initial developments included two road engine sheds, built east of the station (1866) and north of the station. In 1899 a substantial eight road engine shed was built east of the station. In c.1973 an electric multiple unit maintenance depot was constructed as part of the electrification of the Great Northern rail route. A new train-wash and additional maintenance building for Class 700 units has been constructed on the site of the old Coronation sidings, together with an underframe cleaning building alongside the current shed. ==Site history== ===1850 & 1866 GNR engine sheds=== A two road dead ended shed was established by the Great Northern Railway (GNR) in 1850, on the east side of the station. The shed closed in 1866 when the nearby Wood Green shed had been built, and was later demolished; making way for expansion of Hornsey station. In 1866 another two road dead ended shed was established (\"Wood Green shed\"), ~1 km north of the station on the west side of the track adjacent to a new water works, and west of Wood Green common. The shed closed in 1899. ===1899 GNR eight road engine shed=== In 1899 an 8 track shed was constructed to the east of Hornsey station, together with a turntable, coal stage and water tank; the shed was connected via the Ferme Park sidings. The shed provided locos for shunting in the yard and nearby Ferme Park sidings, as well as goods workings across London to the south via Snow Hill tunnel. Hornsey locos shared suburban duties over the southern end of the GNR with locos from Kings Cross Top Shed. Under British Railways the facility received the shed code 34B. The depot's initial allocation was primarily GNR Class N1s, GNR Class N2s and GNR Class J13s. With the passing of steam, in 1961 the shed was converted for use with diesel traction, and continued in use until the early 1970s, closing in May 1971. The shed's duties were passed to nearby Finsbury Park diesel depot. In 1973 the shed was converted for use as an Overhead Line (OHL) maintenance depot, as part of the works for the Great Northern electrification. ===1973 Great Northern electrification EMU depot=== In the 1970s the site was extensively rebuilt; part of the Ferme Park sidings south of the shed were cleared, and a new Electric multiple unit depot constructed;Ordnance Survey. 1:10560; 1967-8. 1:10000; 1973-6, 1981-4, Hornsey EMU depot, 1975- the work was done as part of the Great Northern electrification; a new maintenance shed was constructed with six roads, each capable of holding an eight car train. At the same time the old loco shed was converted to use as an Overhead Line (OHL) maintenance depot, stabling an OHL repair train. After 1973 the depot code became HE. In 2008 First Capital Connect opened a 'Driver Training Academy' at the depot in 2008, equipped with British Rail Class 319 and Class 365 driving simulators. The simulators became operational in 2009. ===Thameslink Class 700 maintenance depot=== In 2009 Network Rail initiated plans to build a new EMU depot at Hornsey, as part of the Thameslink Programme. After consultations, revised plans for a smaller depot were submitted in 2011. The depot has been open since 2016. ==Modern facilities== EMU maintenance building (left) and sidings. (2009) Hornsey depot is currently an Electric Multiple Unit depot Quail Map 2 - England East [page 14] February 1998 (Retrieved 2014-04-0909) for Class 365, Class 387, Class 700 and Class 717 units. These units are used on the Thameslink and Great Northern Routes, Thameslink units are brought to Hornsey for maintenance tasks such as wheel turning, which Bedford Cauldwell depot is unable to do. Facilities include a wheel lathe, large maintenance shed with lifting facilities and a train-washing plant, and extensive stabling sidings for Great Northern's commuter stock. ==References== *Rail Atlas Great Britain & Ireland, S.K.
