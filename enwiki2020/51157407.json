    "text": "WDNG Crshrs (pronounced Wedding Crashers) are an American hip hop duo from Atlanta, Georgia consisting of Quentin Miller, and Thaddeus \"TheCoolisMac\" Callaway. In 2015, they released the mixtapes, UTDinfinity and CrshrsGotWings with producer Cardo. ==History== ===2014\u2013present: UTDinfinity and CrshrsGotWings=== Before they met, Callaway was working with Nick Miles, a producer that Miller wasn't working with, but knew because they were in the same studios. One day, Miller heard Callaway's music and told him to go to one of his sessions and they ended up making a song together. Miller was in a \"terrible\" record deal at the time and was staying at an apartment. He offered Callaway to stay with him for about six months since he had an extra room. During these sixth months, they focused on smoking marijuana and recording music. They also recorded music in 1317, which was the unit number to their friend Trice's apartment. It was also their gathering spot for them to hang out and have \"real constructive meetings\" with their college friends. Callaway came up with the name \"WDNG Crshrs\" by being interested in the 2005 film Wedding Crashers. He also came up with the spelling. On February 14, 2015, WDNG Crshrs released their debut mixtape, UTDinfinity. The mixtape has no guest features and is entirely produced by Nick Miles. Cardo reached out to WDNG Crshrs on Instagram and told them he wanted to do a collaboration project called, CrshrsGotWings. That same day, he sent them many beats to their emails. On August 19, 2015, CrshrsGotWings was released. The mixtape has a sole appearance from Jay Dot Rain and production from Cardo, Yung Exclusive, and others. ==Discography== ===Mixtapes=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" border=\"1\" |+ List of mixtapes and selected details ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:13em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\"| Album details |- ! scope=\"row\"| UTDinfinity | * Released: February 14, 2015 * Formats: Digital download |- ! scope=\"row\"| CrshrsGotWings | * Released: August 19, 2015 * Formats: Digital download |- |} ===Singles=== ====As lead artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ List of singles, showing year released and album name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:15em;\" | Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"UTDinfinity.\" | rowspan=\"2\"| 2014 | UTDinfinity |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"N O S H O R T S\" | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"#SERVE\" | rowspan=\"8\"| 2015 | UTDinfinity |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Still\" | rowspan=\"2\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"That's a Fool\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Perfect Timing\" | CrshrsGotWings |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"YaBwai\" | rowspan=\"9\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Fini...\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Q.T. |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"63/WDNG\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Work Off\" | rowspan=\"5\"| 2016 |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Play 2 Win\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Both |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Thirst\" |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Dreams Come True\" |- |} ===Guest appearances=== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ List of non-single guest appearances, with other performing artists, showing year released and album name ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:20em;\"| Title ! scope=\"col\"| Year ! scope=\"col\"| Other artist(s) ! scope=\"col\"| Album |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Go Ahead (Boo Boo Kitty)\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2015 | Timbaland, Goldy, Cynthia | King Stays King |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Audible\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2016 | DJ Drama | Quality Street Music 2 |- |} ===Music videos=== ====As lead artist==== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+List of music videos as a lead artist, showing year released and director ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:16em;\" | Title ! scope=\"col\" | Year ! scope=\"col\" | Director(s) |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"WHTYOUBOUT\" | rowspan=\"4\"| 2015 | |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Combination\" | Jack Begert |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"#SERVE\" | Fresh Start Productions |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"63/WDNG\" | WDNG Crshrs |- ! scope=\"row\"| \"Both\" | rowspan=\"1\"| 2016 | DJ Bluetooth |- |} ==References== ==External links== * *WDNG Crshrs discography at Discogs Category:African-American musical groups Category:American musical duos Category:Hip hop duos Category:Musical groups from Atlanta Category:Musical groups established in 2014 Category:Southern hip hop groups ",
