He was born Nonomura Seisuke (\u91ce\u3005\u6751), and later received the first name Seiemon (\u6e05\u53f3\u885b\u9580). He was later bestowed the artistic name Ninsei with a seal. == Biography == Tea-leaf jar with a design of wisteria by Ninsei, Edo period (National Treasure) Little is known directly about his life; he is believed to have been born in the village of Tamba, near Tachikui in the Hyogo Prefecture of Japan, near to Kyoto. He is associated with Ky\u014d ware, often being credited as one of the key founders and influencers. He was a master craftsman who perfected the colourful painted pottery in Kyoto. After learning the technique of making tea jars in Seto, around the Sh\u014dh\u014d era (1644-1648) he opened the Omuro kiln in front of the gate of Niwa-ji. Tea master Kanamori Sowa (Shigechika) heaped high praise for his excellent potter's wheel technology and Kyoto-style design.http://www.sowaryu.jp/sowa_rekishi-e.html In response to orders from the public and daimy\u014d families his ware became popular with Japanese tea ceremony. He is also believed to have had a son, nicknamed \"Ninsei II\", who attempted to succeed him in his work, but did not reach the same level. == References == == External links == * https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ninsei * http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/29.100.668/ Category:17th-century Japanese artists ",
