    "text": "\"Let Me Roll It\" is a song by the British\u2013American rock band Paul McCartney and Wings, released on their 1973 album Band on the Run. The song was also released as the B-side to \"Jet\" in early 1974, and has remained a staple of McCartney's live concerts since it was first released. ==Origin== Some critics, such as Rolling Stones Jon Landau,https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/band-on-the- run-19970121 saw the song as a pastiche of John Lennon's sound, particularly the riff and the use of tape echo on the vocals. McCartney, however, didn't intend the song to be a pastiche of Lennon. He did say the vocal \"does sound like John. ... I hadn't realised I'd sung it like John.\"McCartney, Paul, Band on the Run: 25th Anniversary Edition, disc two, track 14 The song's title was inspired by a quote from George Harrison's \"I'd Have You Anytime,\" the opening track from his critically acclaimed All Things Must Pass. According to Ultimate Classic Rock contributor Nick DeRiso, Lennon incorporated the riff from \"Let Me Roll It\" into his 1974 song \"Beef Jerky.\" DeRiso rated it as Wings' 7th greatest song. ==Live performances== \"Let Me Roll It\" was performed regularly by Wings' during their Over the World tour.uncut.co.uk McCartney performed the song again during his New World Tour, and it has been a part of every tour since. He has also included live versions of the song on several live albums, including Wings over America, Paul Is Live, Back in the U.S. (and Back in the World), and Good Evening New York City. ==Personnel== *Paul McCartney \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, bass guitar, drums *Linda McCartney \u2013 backing vocals, keyboards *Denny Laine \u2013 backing vocals, guitar ==References== == External links == * * Review of Let Me Roll It at The Beatles Bible Category:Paul McCartney songs Category:Wings (band) songs Category:Songs written by Paul McCartney Category:Songs written by Linda McCartney Category:Song recordings produced by Paul McCartney Category:1974 songs Category:1974 singles Category:Apple Records singles Category:Music published by MPL Music Publishing ",
