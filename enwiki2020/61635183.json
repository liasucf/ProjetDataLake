Chan completed her higher education at Punahou School and Yale Law School respectively before settling in Hong Kong with her husband Hin Cheung Chan to raise a family. In 1941, she returned to Hawaii where she was admitted as the first Asian female to practice law. From 1943-1976, Chan organized and oversaw the Circuit Court Small Estate and Guardianship Division. In 1948, Chan testified before the United States Congress in an effort to have certain portions of the Immigration Act of 1924 amended. She practiced as an estate and guardianship attorney. Chan died on March 1, 2002 in Kaneohe, Hawaii. == See also == * List of first women lawyers and judges in Hawaii == References == Category:Hawaii lawyers Category:American jurists of Chinese descent Category:Punahou School alumni Category:Yale Law School alumni Category:1906 births Category:2002 deaths Category:American women of Chinese descent Category:20th-century American women lawyers ",
