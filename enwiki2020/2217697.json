    "text": "Whitewood, was a territorial electoral district in the Northwest Territories of Canada from 1887 to 1905. The district was created from the former district of Broadview, prior to the 1888 general election. This district was the first to use a secret ballot. During the 1894 By-election, ballots were first used in this electoral district. The territory went to using colored pencils on paper to count ballots, except someone forgot the pencil for the Candidate William Clements at the Fairmede polling station, and one had to be sent out from the Chief electoral office in Regina. Fred Chamberlain, the local liveryman, drove his horse and carriage twenty-five miles through a raging blizzard to deliver a new pencil and arrived just before the polls opened. After the province of Saskatchewan split from the Northwest Territories in 1905, Whitewood continued to exist as a district in Saskatchewan until 1908. == Election results == === 1894 \u2013 1902 === {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! colspan=\"4\"|1902 Results ! colspan=\"2\"|1898 Results ! colspan=\"3\"|1894 Results |- ! colspan=\"2\" | Affiliation !
