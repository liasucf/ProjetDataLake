    "text": "Space Shuttle Discovery before launch of the STS-85 mission The shuttle pallet satellite was a satellite bus designed to be deployed and then retrieved for return to Earth on NASA's Space Shuttle. It carried a variety of payloads both scientific and military in nature. It was made by Messerschmitt- B\u00f6lkow-Blohm and first flew in 1983. It was carried for the first time during the STS-7 mission and called SPAS-01 carrying 10 payloads. It flew again on the STS-39 mission in 1991 called IBSS-SPAS(Infrared Background Signature Survey - Shuttle Palette Satellite) for the DOD testing various ballistic missile detection sensors. SPAS flew for the third time with the STS-51 mission in 1991 called ORFEUS-SPAS (Orbiting & Retrievable Far & Extreme UV Spectrometer - Shuttle Palette Satellite) with ultraviolet instruments. ORFEUS-SPAS was flown again on the STS-80 mission. SPAS was flown for the second to last time with the CRISTA-SPAS (Cryogenic Infrared Spectrometers & Telescopes for the Atmosphere - Shuttle Palette Satellite) payload on STS-66 in 1994 mounting several infrared sensors looking at the Earths atmosphere, and that payload flew again on STS-85 in 1997 . ==Gallery== File:ORFEUS- SPAS-2.jpg|ORFEUS-SPAS II after being deployed from Columbia on STS-80 File:STS-7_SPAS-1.jpg|The first SPAS on the RMS of Challenger during the STS-7 mission File:STS-39_SPAS-II.jpg|IBSS-SPAS after being deployed from Discoverys payload bay during the STS-39 mission File:CRISTA-SPAS-1.jpg|CRISTA-SPAS 1 on Atlantis RMS before release on the STS-66 mission ==References== Category:Satellites by type ",
