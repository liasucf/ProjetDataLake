With a height of 85.9 metres and weight of 210 tons, the \"metallic tower\" was built between 1892 and 1894. During the Exposition universelle of 1914 in Lyon it had a restaurant and an elevator capable of taking 22 people up to the summit. Although used as an observation tower until November 1, 1953, nowadays it serves as a television tower and is not accessible to the public. At 372m, it is the highest point in Lyon. ==Broadcasting stations== ===FM-radio=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !Programme !Frequency is euros !ERP |- | France Inter || 87,75 MHz || 2 kW |- | Regional || 91,05 MHz || 2 kW |- | France Culture || 94,0 MHz || 3 kW |- | France Musique || 98,0 MHz || 2 kW |} ===TV=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- style=\"background:#ccc;\" !Programme !Channel-Number !Frequency !ERP |- | M6 || 22 || 479,25 MHz || 10 kW |- | TLM || 25 || 503,25 MHz || 10 kW |- | France 5 || 28 || 527,25 MHz || 10 kW |- | France 2 || 58 || 767,25 MHz || 10 kW |- | TF1 || 61 || 791,25 MHz || 10 kW |- | France 3 || 64 || 815,25 MHz || 10 kW |} ==See also== * Fourvi\u00e8re * Lattice tower * List of towers ==External links== * * La tour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re \u00e0 Lyon Extensive documentation and building information * Skyscraperpage.com ==Gallery== File:Tour metallique de fourviere.jpg|The Tour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re at night File:Lyon_Emetteur_TV_02.jpg|Tour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8re File:Tour m\u00e9tallique de Fourvi\u00e8res.jpg|Poster advertising elevator Category:5th arrondissement of Lyon Category:Buildings and structures in Lyon Category:Towers in France Category:Transmitter sites in France ",
