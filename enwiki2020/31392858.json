He spent more than 50 years in the field of social work in Quebec. In the 1970s, he was active in assisting Vietnamese boat people refugees. In 1975, he headed an inquiry into abuses at institutions housing troubled young people, and the Batshaw Committee submitted a report that was the basis for legislation. In 1993, five anglophone institutions merged and were named the Batshaw Youth and Family Centres in his honour. He received an honorary degree from McGill University in 1998 and the National Order of Quebec in 2003,http://www.ordre-national.gouv.qc.ca/membres/membre.asp?id=169 as well as the Order of Canada.http://www.gg.ca/honour.aspx?id=9543&t;=12&ln;=Batshaw ==Early life and family== Batshaw was born in Montreal in 1915 to Russian parents who moved to Canada in 1903.
