    "text": "The Montreal Building (Portuguese: Edif\u00edcio Montreal) is an apartment building in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. It was designed by the architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907\u20132012) and executed by Carlos Lemos (1925-). The building was designed in 1950, construction began in 1951, and opened in 1954. It was one of several buildings in S\u00e3o Paulo commissioned by the Banco Nacional Imobili\u00e1rio (National Real Estate Bank) to meet the demand for dense, high-rise residential structures in the center of the city. The building was the first of Niemeyer's large-scale works in S\u00e3o Paulo; it predates the Copan, Tri\u00e2ngulo e Calif\u00f3rnia buildings. Basic units in the building sold for Cr$ 280,000 at the time of its opening. The Montreal Building sits on a narrow, irregular corner of Ipiranga and C\u00e1sper L\u00edbero avenues opposite of Pra\u00e7a Alfredo Lessa. Units in the building range from to , many in a trapezoidal floor plan. Units in the building are small and were meant to attract single occupants or small families. The entrance hall features three large panels of mosaics by Emiliano Di Cavalcanti. The pattern of horizontal fins on the north fa\u00e7ade of the building closely resembles that of the Banco do Estado de Minas Gerais, designed in the same period by Niemeyer. The brise soleil facing avenues Ipiranga and C\u00e1sper L\u00edbero were removed in a 2004 renovation. Edif\u00edcio Montreal is a listed building by the Municipal Council for the Preservation of Historical, Cultural and Environmental City of S\u00e3o Paulo (SPHAN). ==References== Category:Modernist architecture in Brazil Category:Oscar Niemeyer buildings Category:Residential buildings completed in 1954 Category:Skyscrapers in S\u00e3o Paulo Category:Residential skyscrapers in Brazil ",
