    "text": "Arthur Adamov (23 August 1908 \u2013 15 March 1970) was a playwright, one of the foremost exponents of the Theatre of the Absurd. ==Life== Adamov (originally Adamian) was born in Kislovodsk in the Terek Oblast of the Russian Empire to a wealthy Armenian family, which lost its wealth in 1917. In common with many other wealthy Russians of the time, Adamov was brought up with French as his first language, and in 1924 he moved to Paris. In Paris Adamov met surrealists and edited the surrealist journal Discontinuit\u00e9. He began to write plays after World War II, with La Parodie (1947) being his first. His work, influenced by Bertolt Brecht, is often dream-like and later works in particular have a political element. The title character of one of his best known works, Le Professeur Taranne (1953), is accused of various things (public nudity, littering, plagiarism), all of which he strenuously denies, only to have his denials turned against him into more evidence of misdemeanours. This particular play was directly influenced by a dream Adamov had. Lesser known to the public is his prose work with short stories like Fin Ao\u00fbt (in Je... Ils..., 1969). Their themes revolve around topics like masochism, which the author regarded as \"immunisation against death\". Adamov translated a number of works by German authors (Rilke, B\u00fcchner) and Russian classics (Gogol, Chekhov) into French. The Algerian war radicalised his political views and in the 1960s he became a Communist. During his later years, he began to drink and use drugs.Albee, Edward, The American Dream, Coward, 1961. Adamov's death in 1970 was due to an overdose of barbiturates.Banarjee, R. B., \"The Theatre of the Absurd,\" in Literary Criterion, Vol. 7, No. 1, 1965, pp. 59-62. == Selected plays == * L'Aveu (The Confession, 1946) * La Parodie (The Parody, 1950) * L'Invasion (The Invasion, 1950) * La Grande et la Petite Manoeuvre (The Grand and Small Manoeuvre, 1950) * Le Sens de la Marche (The Way to Go, 1953) * Tous contre tous (All against all, 1953) * Le Professeur Taranne (Professor Taranne, 1953) * Le Ping-Pong (Ping Pong, 1955) * Paolo Paoli (1957) * Le Printemps '71 (Spring '71, 1960) * La Politique des Restes (The Politics of Rubbish, 1963) * Ici et Maintenant (Here and Now, 1964) * Sainte Europe (Holy Europe, 1966) * M. le Mod\u00e9r\u00e9 (Mr. Moderate, 1968) * Off Limits (1969) * Si l'\u00e9t\u00e9 revenait (If Summer Came Again, 1970) ==References== Category:1908 births Category:1970 deaths Category:People from Kislovodsk Category:People from Terek Oblast Category:Russian Armenians Category:Soviet emigrants to France Category:Russian\u2013French translators Category:20th-century French dramatists and playwrights Category:French Armenians Category:Soviet Armenians Category:Theatre of the Absurd Category:Drug-related deaths in France ",
