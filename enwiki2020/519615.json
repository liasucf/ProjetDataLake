    "text": "The Martwa Wis\u0142a (; ; both literally \"dead Vistula\") is a river, one of the branches of the Vistula, flowing through the city of Gda\u0144sk in northern Poland. It got its name when this branch of the river became increasingly moribund. A harbor canal was constructed with the Westerplatte on one of its banks. It was constructed to flow through Danzig (Gda\u0144sk) into the Danziger Bucht, now Gda\u0144sk Bay. Its river mouth and environs double as a harbor channel for the Inner Port of the port of Gda\u0144sk. ==See also== *Baltic Sea *Battle of Westerplatte *Wis\u0142ouj\u015bcie Fortress == External links == 0Martwa Wis\u0142a Category:Rivers of Poland Category:Rivers of Pomeranian Voivodeship ",
