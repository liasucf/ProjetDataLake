    "text": "Chronicon Lusitanum The Chronicon Lusitanum or Lusitano (also Chronica Lusitana or Chronica/Chronicon Gothorum) is a chronicle of the history of Portugal from the earliest migrations of the Visigoths (which it dates to 311) through the reign of Portugal's first king, Afonso Henriques (1139\u201385). The entries in the chronicle, ordered by year and dated by the Spanish Era, get increasingly longer and the majority of the text deals with the reign of Afonso. The conventional title of the chronicle means \"Lusitanian (i.e. Portuguese) chronicle\" or \"chronicle of the Goths\". It was first given by the editor Enrique Fl\u00f3rez, who rejected the title under which it had previously been edited (Gothorum Chronica) because of its subject matter.Hanc praeferimus titulum, potius quam Gothorum Chronica, sub quo editum; quoniam de rebus in Lusitania gestis, non de Gothorum Regibus, tota illi cura est. Fl\u00f3rez also claims that the manuscript of the Chronicon had previously been utilised by Andr\u00e9 de Resende, the first archaeologist of Portugal, and , the first journalist of Portugal; it was also edited in the third volume of the Monarchia Lusitana by (1632).Chronicon Lusitanum quo olim manuscripto Resendius et Faria sunt usi: editum Tomo III Monarchiae Lusitanae. ==Excerpts== 311\\.

As his father the lord Count Henry died while this child [Afonso Henriques] was only two or three years of age, certain undignified foreigners [led by Fernando P\u00e9rez de Traba] came to the kingdom of Portugal, with the consent of his mother Queen Dona Teresa, who desired to take the place of her husband and her son in the affairs of the realm. Since such a dishonorable injury he [Afonso] could never bear (being already grown up and well-formed), he invited his friends and the more noble men of Portugal, who much preferred his rule to that of his mother or of the ignoble foreigners who wished to dispossess him, and he met them to battle in the field of S\u00e3o Mamede, which is beside the castle of Guimar\u00e3es, and they were fought and defeated by him, and they fled from his face, and he captured them. He [thus] obtained the government and the kingship of the realm of Portugal.\u00c6ra 1166. . . Siquidem mortuo patre suo Comite Domino Henrico, cum adhuc ipse puer esset duorum, aut trium annorum, quidam indigni & alienigenae vendicabant Regnum Portugallis, matre ejus Regina Donna Tarasia eis consentiente, volens fie ipsa superbe regnare loco mariti sui, amoto filio a negotio Regni. Quam injuriam valde inhonestam nullatenus ferre valens (erat enim jam grandaevus aetate, & bonae indolis) convocatis amicis suis, & nobilioribus de Portugal, qui eum multo maxime, quam matrem ejus, vel indignos & exteros natione volevant regnare super se, commisit cum eis praelium in campo Sanct Mametis, quod est prope Castellum de Vimaranes, & contriti sunt & devicti ab eo, & fugerunt a facie ejus, & comprehendit eos. Obtinuit ipse principatum & Monarchiam Regni Portugallis. ... 1162\\. On 30 November during the night of Saint Andrew the Apostle the men of the king of Portugal, Dom Afonso, led by Fern\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alves and other cavaleiros vil\u00f5es invested the city of Pace, that is, Beja at night, and bravely captured it, and the Christians possessed it in the thirty-fifth year of his [Afonso\u2019s] reign.\u00c6ra 1200.
