The larvae feed on Cotinus coggyria, Pistacia atlantica, Pistacia khinjuk, Pistacia lentiscus, Pistacia terebinthus, Pistacia vera and Rhus coriaria. They mine the leaves of their host plant. The mine consists of a full depth corridor that only widens little towards the end. Frass is found in a central line, almost filling the corridor.
