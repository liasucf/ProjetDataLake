    "text": "\"Yours If You Want It\" is a song recorded by American country music group Rascal Flatts. It was released in January 2017 as the first single from their tenth studio album, Back to Us (2017). The song was written by the late Andrew Dorff and Jonathan Singleton. ==History== Rascal Flatts bassist Jay DeMarcus noted that the song was co-written by Andrew Dorff, who died at age 40 shortly before the song was released. He told Rolling Stone that \"We've been working really hard and we're very proud of this track and what's more, the late Andrew Dorff is a writer on it, and we are so honored to be a small part of making sure his legacy lives on. We have a special angel watching over it, for sure.\" ==Music video== The music video was directed by Billy Zabka, starring Kevin Farley and Kristy Swanson, and premiered on CMT, GAC and Vevo in April 2017. Zabka previously directed Rascal Flatts' music video for \"Why Wait\". ==Critical reception== Billy Dukes of Taste of Country reviewed the song with favor, saying that \"The production of 'Yours If You Want It' is as important as LeVox\u2019s sterling vocals. Every instrument and backing vocal is razor sharp, yet there's no phony shine that often accompanies a heavily produced track. Visit Jay DeMarcus and Joe Don Rooney's simple and well-balanced backing vocals for an example.\" Matt Bjorke of Roughstock was also favorable, comparing the sound favorably to the band's earlier songs such as \"Prayin' for Daylight\" while noting the \"modern and fresh\" production. ==Commercial performance== The song has sold 88,000 copies in the United States as of June 2017. ==Charts== For the week ending August 5, 2017, the song became the group's fourteenth number one single. This is the first time since \"Here\" and \"Here Comes Goodbye\" in 2009 the group has achieved consecutive number one hits. {|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" ! Chart (2017) !
