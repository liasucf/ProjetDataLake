The kidnapping and eventual death of prime witness police constable Ravindra Patil remains a mystery, with some suspecting the involvement of organised crime. In December 2015, Khan was acquitted of all charges from this case due to lack of evidence. The Supreme Court on Tuesday 5 July 2016 admitted a plea by the Maharashtra government that challenged the acquittal of Salman Khan in this hit-and-run case by the Bombay High Court. The court refused to fast-track the case. === Relationship with Aishwarya Rai === His relationship with actress Aishwarya Rai was a well publicised topic in the Indian media. After their break-up in March 2002, Rai accused him of harassing her. She claimed that Khan had not been able to come to terms with their break-up and was hounding her; her parents lodged a complaint against him. In 2005, news outlets released what was said to be an illicit copy of a mobile phone call recorded in 2001 by the Mumbai police. It appeared to be a call in which he threatened Rai, in an effort to force her to appear at social events held by Mumbai crime figures. The call featured boasts of connections to organised crime and derogatory comments about other actors. However, the alleged tape was tested in the government's Forensic lab in Chandigarh, which concluded that it was fake. === Blackbuck hunting and Arms Act violations cases === The case involves the alleged killing of a deer when Khan and his co-stars \u2013 Saif Ali Khan, Sonali Bendre, Neelam and Tabu \u2014 were filming the movie Hum Saath-Saath Hain in the forests near Jodhpur in 1998.

Khan was released on bail on 7 April 2018, pending appeal. === Remarks about 26/11 attacks === In September 2010, Khan was reported to have claimed during an interview on a Pakistani channel that the 26/11 attacks got a lot of attention because the \"elite\" were targeted. During the interview the actor had said: \"It was the elite that was targeted this time. Five star hotels and stuff. So they panicked. Then they got up and spoke about it. My question is \"why not before?\" Attacks have happened in trains and small towns too, but no one talked about it so much.\" Khan also said that Pakistan was not to be blamed for it, and that the Indian security forces had failed. Khan's comments had drawn strong reactions from Deputy Chief Minister of Maharashtra Chagan Bhujbal, Shiv Sena, BJP and other political parties. The comments were also condemned by Ujwal Nikam, Special Prosecutor in the 26/11 trial. Khan later apologised for his comments. === Tweets on Yakub Memon === On 25 July 2015, Khan made a number of tweets from his Twitter account in support of the 1993 Bombay bombings accused Yakub Memon. Memon was scheduled to be executed, before which Khan made his tweets. Khan said that Yakub's brother, Tiger Memon should be hanged instead. He also asked the Prime Minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif to confirm \"whether the mob boss is in his country.\" The tweets sparked protests outside his house where police had to be deployed and was criticised in the social media and by his father, Salim Khan. Following these incidents, Khan withdrew his tweets and apologised. ===Sabotaging careers=== In June 2020, after actor Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide in Mumbai, Dabangg director Abhinav Singh Kashyap, brother of director Anurag Kashyap accused Salman and his brothers (Arbaaz, Sohail) and their father Salim Khan of sabotaging his career and more specifically his movie Besharam. == Accolades == Khan won numerous awards including two National Film Awards and two Filmfare Awards. == Discography == Khan has sung the following Hindi songs for Bollywood films: {|class=\"wikitable soratable\" |- !
