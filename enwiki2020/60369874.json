    "text": "The A4 motorway connects Kosovo with Skopje and continues southeast towards \u0160tip, Radovi\u0161, and Strumica, eventually reaching the border with Bulgaria near Novo Selo. The 47 km stretch from Miladinovci to \u0160tip was completed in late 2018, while the works on the Skopje - Blace (Kosovo border) section will begin in 2020. Further south-east from \u0160tip to Radovis, there is an express road under construction, which could potentially be upgraded to a motorway in the future. ==See also== * Motorways in North Macedonia ==References== Category:Roads in North Macedonia ",
