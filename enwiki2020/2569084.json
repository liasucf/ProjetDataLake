    "text": "The Zazas (also known as Kird, Kirmanc or Dimili) are a people in eastern Turkey who speak the Zaza language. Their heartland consists of Tunceli and Bing\u00f6l provinces and parts of Elaz\u0131\u011f, Erzincan and Diyarbak\u0131r provinces. Zazas generally consider themselves Kurds, and are often described as Zaza Kurds. == Demographics == The exact number of Zazas is unknown, due to the absence of recent and extensive census data. The last census on language in Turkey was held in 1965, where 150,644 people ticked Zaza as their first language and 112,701 as their second language. More recent data from 2005 suggests that the Zaza-speaking population varies from approximately 2 to 4 million. Many Zazas only speak Kurmanji Kurdish as it was believed that the Zaza language was an offshoot of Kurmanji. According to a 2019 KONDA survey, about 1.5 million people identified themselves as Zaza. Following the 1980 Turkish coup d'\u00e9tat, many intellectual minorities, including Zazas, emigrated from Turkey towards Europe, Australia and the United States. The largest part of the Zaza diaspora is in Europe, predominantly in Germany. == Ethnic consciousness == While Zazas largely consider themselves Kurds, some researches do consider Zazas as an ethnic group and treat them as such in their academic work. ===Zazas and Kurmanji-speaking Kurds=== \"Zaza Kurds in Diyarbakir (Kurdistan) Kurmanji Kurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the Ottoman Empire and later the Republic of Turkey. During the Sheikh Said rebellion in 1925, the Zaza Sheikh Said and his supporters rebelled against the newly established Turkey for its nationalist and secular ideology. Many Zazas subsequently joined the Kurdish nationalist Xoyb\u00fbn, Society for the Rise of Kurdistan and other movements where they rose to prominence. In 1937 during the Dersim rebellion, Zazas once again rebelled against the Turks. This time the rebellion was led by Seyid Riza and ended with a massacre of thousands of Kurdish and Zaza civilians, while many were internally displaced due to the conflict. Zazas also participated in the Ko\u00e7giri rebellion in 1920. Sakine Cans\u0131z, a Zaza from Tunceli was a founding member of Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), and like her many Zazas joined the rebels, including the promiment Bes\u00ea Hozat. Many Zaza politicians are also to be found in the fraternal Kurdish parties of the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and Democratic Regions Party (DBP), like Selahattin Demirta\u015f, Aysel Tu\u011fluk, Ayla Akat Ata and G\u00fcltan K\u0131\u015fanak. On the other hand, some Zazas have publicly stated they do not consider themselves Kurdish including H\u00fcseyin Ayg\u00fcn, a CHP politician from Tunceli. A scientific report from 2005 concluded that Zazas share the same genetical pattern as other 'Kurdish groups' and did not support the hypothesis of Zazas originating from Northern Iran. == Language == Zaza language with the other Iranian languages Zaza is a Northwest Iranian language, spoken in the east of modern Turkey, with approximately 2 to 3 million speakers. There is a division between Northern and Southern Zaza, most notably in phonological inventory, but Zaza as a whole forms a dialect continuum, with no recognized standard. The first written statements in the Zaza language were compiled by the linguist Peter Lerch in 1850. Two other important documents are the religious writings of Ehmed\u00ea Xasi of 1898, and of Usman Efendiyo Bab\u0131c (published in Damascus in 1933); both of these works were written in the Arabic alphabet. The state-owned TRT Kurd\u00ee airs shows in Zaza. During the 1980s, Zaza language became popular among diaspora Zazas after meager efforts which was followed by publications in Zaza in Turkey. == Religion == Around half of the Zaza population adhere to Alevism and these predominantly live around Tunceli. The other half adhere to Sunni Islam, both Hanafi and Shafi\u2018i, whereas the Shafi\u2018i followers are mostly Naqshbandi. Historically, a Christian Zaza population existed in Gerger. == Zaza nationalism == Zaza nationalism is an ideology that supports the preservation of Zaza people between Turks and Kurds in Turkey. Turkish nationalist Hasan Re\u015fit Tankut proposed in 1961 to create a corridor between Zaza-speakers and Kurmanji-speakers to hasten Turkification. In some cases in the diaspora, Zazas turned to this ideology because of the more visible differences between them and Kurmanji-speakers. Zaza nationalism was further boosted when Turkey abandoned its assimilatory policies which made some Zazas begin considering themselves as a separate ethnic group.Indigenous Peoples: An Encyclopedia of Culture, History, and Threats to . Victoria R. Williams In the diaspora, some Zazas turned to Zaza nationalism in the freer European political climate. On this, Ebubekir Pamukchu, the founder of the Zaza national movement stated: \"From that moment I became Zaza.\" Zaza nationalists fear Turkish and Kurdish influence and aim at protecting Zaza culture and language rather than seeking any kind of autonomy within Turkey.Zulf\u00fc Selcan, Grammatik der Zaza-Sprache, Nord-Dialekt (Dersim-Dialekt), Wissenschaft & Technik Verlag, Berlin, 1998, p. 23. According to researcher Ahmet Kas\u0131mo\u011flu, Zaza nationalism is a Turkish and Armenian attempt to divide Kurds. == See also == *Minorities in Turkey *N\u00fbredin Zaza ==Further reading== * * * Faruk \u0130remet, \"Zon\u00ea Ma Zazaki\" (Dilimiz Zazaca), (Our language Zaza and Zazas == Notes == == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * ",
