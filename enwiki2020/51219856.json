He founded the World Health Summit in 2009. He was Chairman of the Foundation Board of the Charit\u00e9 Foundation (2005-2015), editor of the Journal of Molecular Medicine (since 1993), Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Max Planck Institute of Colloids and Interfaces and Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology as well as Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Ethnological Museum Dahlem of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation. From 2004 to 2008, he was CEO of the Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin. Charit\u00e9 on Detlev Ganten's birthday and from 1991 to 2004 Founding Director and CEO of the Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association. MDC founding director Detlev Ganten == Academic and professional career == Ganten completed agricultural training in Elmshorn in 1959 with the agricultural assistant state examination. Following his secondary education he studied medicine in W\u00fcrzburg and Montpellier (France) from 1962 to 1964 and worked in the surgical ward of the hospital \"La Mamounia\" in Marrakesh (Morocco). From 1966 to 1968 he continued his medical studies in T\u00fcbingen, concluding them with the medical state examination and subsequent internships in T\u00fcbingen and Emden. In 1968 Ganten received his MD from the University of T\u00fcbingen followed by a research period (1969 to 1973) at the Clinical Research Institute in Montreal (Canada) affiliated with the University of Montreal. In 1970 he received his license to practice medicine and then in 1973, obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) from McGill University in Montreal. From 1973 to 1991 Ganten worked for the Pharmacological Institute of the University of Heidelberg where he also qualified as a professor in 1974. In 1975 he received a professorship in Pharmacology at the Medical Faculty of Heidelberg University. In 1978 he became specialist in Pharmacology and Clinical Pharmacology. On January 1, 1992, Ganten was appointed Founding Director of the Max Delbr\u00fcck Center for Molecular Medicine (MDC) in Berlin- Buch. His task was to transform the central institutions for cardiovascular research, cancer research and molecular biology of the Academy of Sciences of the GDR into a new national center for health research of the Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres. Around the same time (1993) he was offered the chair for Clinical Pharmacology at the Free University of Berlin. In this period he promoted clinical translational research from basic research to clinical application, intensifying the cooperation in the field of basic research at the MDC with the hospitals in Berlin-Buch, the hospitals of the Medical Faculties of the Free University in Berlin-Steglitz (Klinikum Benjamin Franklin) and Wedding (Virchow-Klinikum) and the Medical Faculty of the Humboldt University (Charit\u00e9 Campus Mitte). In 2004, the Senate of Berlin appointed Ganten CEO of the Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin. Under his direction the locations of academic medicine in East and West Berlin were united. As a result of the merger with the \"Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Benjamin Franklin\" of the Free University of Berlin, the Charit\u00e9 Berlin became a member of both universities and thus the largest university hospital in Germany. Ganten held the office of CEO of the Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin until 2008. New CEO at Charit\u00e9 The year 2005 saw the establishment of the Charit\u00e9 Foundation by donor Johanna Quandt and Ganten. Since then, Ganten has been acting Chairman of the Foundation Board. Charit\u00e9 Foundation Board of Trustees Support from the Charit\u00e9 Foundation helped to establish an increasingly closer association between the Charit\u00e9 \u2013 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin and the Max Delbr\u00fcck Center in Berlin-Buch. The formation of the \"Berlin Institute of Health (BIH)\" was founded in 2013 through an agreement of the Federal Ministry for Research and Technology and the Senate of Berlin. The BIH provides a joint structure and platform for MDC and Charit\u00e9 to strengthen their clinical research initiatives. On occasion of the 300th anniversary of the founding of the Charit\u00e9, Ganten launched the World Health Summit and continues his association as Founding President of this annual Berlin event. In 2013 Ganten was elected co-chair of the Interacademy Medical Panel (IAMP). IAMP Elections of Executive Committee 2013 - 2016 == Fields of research == Ganten's major area of research is hypertension. He discovered basic mechanisms underlying the development of hypertension and is investigating the hormonal regulation of hypertension, in particular the renin-angiotensin-aldosteron system. Further key research interests include the genomic and molecular mechanisms of evolution and evolutionary medicine, concepts for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, Public Health, Global Health and Bioethics. His scientific work won Ganten visiting professorships at the University of California in 1983, at the Coll\u00e8ge de France, Paris, in 2010 respectively. Ganten is also an editor of the Journal of Molecular Medicine (since 1993). Ganten has been president and coordinator of numerous scientific conferences, among them: Scientific Meeting of the European and International Societies of Hypertension (Heidelberg 1986, Berlin 2008); Gordon Conference (1997, Italy); and the Annual Meeting of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians (Gesellschaft Deutscher Naturforscher und \u00c4rzte, GDN\u00c4 \u2013 Berlin 1998). == Functions in scientific societies and committees == Ganten's functions in scientific societies and committees include: membership in the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences and Humanities (BBAW); the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences and Humanities, the Academy of Sciences Leopoldina; the Academia Europaea, the Polish Academy of Sciences; and the Acad\u00e9mie de Berlin. Further memberships include the Health Research Council of the German Federal Ministry for Science and Technology from 1992 to 1997 and the Science Council of the German Federal Government from 1993 to 1998. Ganten was President of the Helmholtz Association of National Research Centers (1997\u20132001); and a member of the German Ethics Council from 2001 to 2007. From 1995 to 2004 Ganten was acting Vice President of the Berlin\u2013Brandenburg Academy of Sciences (BBAW). ==Other activities== * Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Member of the Board of TrusteesBoard of Trustees Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics. * Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Member of the Board of TrusteesBoard of Trustees Max Planck Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology. * Sorbonne Paris Cit\u00e9 University, Member of the Scientific Advisory Board * Agence nationale de la recherche (ANR), Member of the Advisory Board (since 2009) * Coll\u00e8ge de France, President of the Comit\u00e9 International d\u2019Orientation Scientifique et Strat\u00e9gique (2004-2012) * Institut de la Sant\u00e9 et de Recherche M\u00e9dicale (INSERM), Member of Board of Directors (2001-2009) * Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians, President (1996\u20131998) * World Hypertension League (WHL), President (1992-1998) ==Recognition== Ganten received the Order of Merit of the State of Berlin in 1997; the Federal Cross of Merit, Germany in 2000, Detlev Ganten receives Order of Merit of the State of Berlin and in 2012, the insignia of Officer of the Legion of Honor of the French Republic Detlev Ganten receives insignia Officer of the Legion of Honor of the French Republic Ganten was appointed Dr. honoris causa by: * Wuhan University, China (1994) * Alexandru Ioan Cuza University, Romania (1995) * First Moscow State University (2004) * Coimbra, Portugal (2015) * Maastricht University, Netherlands (2015) * Charit\u00e9 - Universit\u00e4tsmedizin Berlin, Germany (2016) * Montreal University, Canada (2017) * Sapienza University of Rome, Italy (2017) * Istanbul University, Turkey (2018) Ganten has been the recipient of many international awards and prizes including the Chavez Award of the International Society of Hypertension; Sechenev Medal of the Medical Academy Moscow; Franz Gross Science Award of the German League for Combating High Blood Pressure (all in 1981 respectively); the Heilmeyer Medal of the Society for Progress in Internal Medicine (1990); the Max Planck Research Award (with Kazuo Murakami, Japan) (1991); the Okamoto Award, Japan (1991); the CIBA Award of the Council for High Blood Pressure Research of the American Heart Association (1992); and in 2013, the Humboldt Medal of the Society of German Natural Scientists and Physicians. == Books == * Ganten, D., Deichmann, T. and Spahl, T.
