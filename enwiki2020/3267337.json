    "text": "City is a Finnish free-of-charge magazine in various cities in Finland. The headquarters is in Helsinki. City is aimed for the young adult population of 18- to 35-year-olds. It has many articles about young adult culture, an up-to- date list of various happenings, and a discussion page which can be contributed to via letters, e-mail or SMS. City was founded in 1985 by the first editor-in-chief Eeropekka Rislakki and media academic Kim Weckstr\u00f6m, as its purpose to bring to Finland \"city culture\" that had been mostly missing in that country before. In 1986 the initially subscription based monthly changed format to a free monthly tabloid. The new editor-in-chief Kari Kivel\u00e4 developed the paper towards a more popular format with a combination fashion-, lifestyle- and entertainment listings content. The magazine is available in various public places in all of Finland's larger cities, including Helsinki, Tampere, Turku and Lahti. Each city has its own localised version of the magazine. City also has a web site which holds various discussion forums and an on-line dating service. ==References== ==External links== * Official site (in Finnish) Category:1985 establishments in Finland Category:Free magazines Category:Magazines established in 1985 Category:Magazines published in Helsinki Category:Youth magazines ",
