It has been described as having a \"refined and sensual\" sound, expressing love's beauty as a \"mixture of diverse senses\". Shinee member Jonghyun wrote the lyrics to the song. Member Minho stated that he was worried about the new concept since the musical style is different to what the group has done before, which explains the title.

The album also stayed in the top 10 of the Billboard World Albums Chart for three consecutive weeks after its release on May 18.

The choreography of the title song, \"Married to the Music,\" is the work of Greg S. Hwang and Tony Testa. Jeff Benjamin of Billboard describes the title track as \"a journey of different genres, opening with what initially sounds like a \"beatbox-heavy, hip-hop sound\" before flipping to a \"sexy, bouncy electronic beat on the verses until we get to a funk-inspired chorus that mixes in horn blasts, groovy guitar strums and classic boy-band harmonies\". == Critical reception == Melon's pop music critics chose Shinee's Odd as one of the best albums for the first half of 2015, praising the vocal skills of the members and stating: \"Shinee made an exemplary display of both 'pleasure of listening and joy of watching' once again.\" Odd was also selected as one of MTV IGGY's \"25 Best Albums of 2015\", praising the \"experimenting and playing with old and new sounds, resulting in a fresh and evolved album\". The title song, \"View\", got positive response, describing it as a great, laid back summer jam even though \"the song fools us into thinking it's an uptempo ballad before reaching its techno peak at the chorus.\" Jeff Benjamin of Billboard praised the title song, stating, \"Despite boasting completely different vibes, 'View' isn't that different from 'Everybody' in that both have the same repetitive chorus structures, but the latter throws piles of electronica into the chorus while 'View' keeps its instrumentation very simple. By going against what's expected, Shinee actually ends up taking more of a risk by doing less and it pays off handsomely.\" Album track \"Odd Eye\" also received praise, which is written and composed by member Jonghyun, Benjamin states the group \"return to the R&B; side of Shinee with feathery vocals, tight harmonies and member Onew's falsetto howls acting a centerpiece to this grooving opener.\" But he also criticized some of the songs of the album, like \"An Ode to You\", saying the \"unnecessary electric guitar riffs are added to the mix that soils the pure production.\" \"Black Hole\" is also criticized stating, \"it's not only the shortest song of the album, but also one of the most forgettable.\" Overall he gave the album 3.5 stars out of 5. The title song, \"View\", was also included in Billboard's \"Top 20 Best K-Pop Songs of 2015\". Odd was also nominated as one of the \"albums of glory\" by Arena Homme+ magazine. Shinee was the only idol group on the list. Kim Yunha, a music critic of Arena Homme+ writes: \"K-pop, captivating the pop genre for years, may seem like it\u2019s on its journey to find the 'real pop' in the music industry that have been defined as either ballads or dance music at a glance. If you agree on this idea, Shinee is definitely a front-runner that leads this movement. Every time, without any fears, they\u2019ve been opening doors for entirely new levels and after having reached the limit of being a human with 'Everybody' what they have arrived to is a very Shinee-ish stateless world of pop. They are still dancing and singing in a place where nobody dares to covet.\" == Track listing == Credits adapted from Shinee's official homepage. ;Notes * Minho is credited for writing the song's rap. * Key is credited for writing the song's rap. == Music program awards == {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Song ! style=\"width:200px;\"| Program ! style=\"width:150px;\"| Date |- | rowspan=\"10\"| \"View\" | Show Champion (MBC Music) | May 27, 2015 |- | rowspan=2| M!
