    "text": "Launch Services Program (LSP) is responsible for NASA oversight of launch operations and countdown management, providing added quality and mission assurance in lieu of the requirement for the launch service provider to obtain a commercial launch license. It operates under the Human Exploration and Operations (HEO) Mission Directorate of NASA. Since 1990, NASA has purchased expendable launch vehicle (ELV) launch services directly from commercial providers, whenever possible, for its scientific and applications missions. ELVs can accommodate all types of orbit inclinations and altitudes and are ideal vehicles for launching Earth-orbit and interplanetary missions. The Launch Services Program was established at Kennedy Space Center for NASA's acquisition and program management of ELV missions. A NASA/contractor team is in place to meet the mission of the Launch Services Program, which exists to provide leadership, expertise and cost-effective services in the commercial arena to satisfy Agency wide space transportation requirements and maximize the opportunity for mission success. Primary launch sites are Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) in Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB) in California. Other launch locations are NASA's Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia, Reagan Test Site at Kwajalein Atoll in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and Kodiak Launch Complex in Alaska. In 2012, the program posted electronic copies of its brochure and poster. ==Partners== ===Spacecraft customers=== *Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland *Jet Propulsion Laboratory, located at the California Institute of Technology *NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, in California's Silicon Valley *NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland *NASA Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia *NASA Marshall Space Flight Center at Redstone Arsenal in Huntsville, Alabama *Several U.S. Universities, launching small research satellites (CubeSats) *International partners *Other Government Agencies: **Missile Defense Agency (MDA) **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) **National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) ===Launch vehicle contractors (LVC)=== The Launch Services Program (LSP) is currently awarding new contracts under the NASA Launch Services (NLS) II Contract. Once a year, new launch vehicles can be on (or off) ramped onto the contract. The following vehicles are attached to the NLS II Contract. *Antares \u2013 Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) *Athena I \u2013 Lockheed Martin Space Systems *Athena II \u2013 Lockheed Martin Space Systems *Atlas V \u2013 United Launch Alliance (ULA) *Delta II \u2013 United Launch Alliance (ULA) [limited to 5 - 3 already assigned] *Falcon 1 \u2013 SpaceX *Falcon 9 \u2013 SpaceX *Pegasus XL \u2013 Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) *Taurus XL \u2013 Orbital Sciences Corporation (OSC) NASA has specific policies governing launch services. LSP Flight Design provides general information regarding the launch vehicle performance available via existing NASA contracts. This information is all available on publicly available websites. NASA uses a certification system for rockets launched by its contractors, and for validation purposes it requires the certification process to be \"instrumented to provide design verification and flight performance data\", with post-flight operations, anomaly resolution process, and a flight margin verification process, with 80% predicted design reliability at 95% confidence. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:90px;\"| Launch vehicle risk category ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:120px;\"| Category 1 (high risk) ! scope=\"col\" | Category 2 (medium risk) ! scope=\"col\" | Category 3 (low risk) |- !

This \"is a consulting service to government and commercial organizations, providing mission management, overall systems engineering and/or specific discipline expertise; e.g. mission assurance, flight design, systems safety, etc., as requested.\" This non-traditional service allows LSP to \"expand its customer base and assist these customers in maximizing their mission success by using NASA LSP's unique expertise.\" The four general categories of advisory services are: * SMART (Supplemental Mission Advisory and Risk Team) * Design and Development * Independent Verification and Validation (IV&V;) * Independent Review Teams (IRT) ===Air Force/Range=== LSP also works with the Air Force Space Command (AFSPC), via coordination by the LVCs. For launches at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station (CCAFS) and Vandenberg Air Force Base (VAFB), the 45th Space Wing and 30th Space Wing commanders, respectively, are the Launch Decision Authority. For launches from CCAFS, \"Airmen, Air Force civilians and contractors from throughout the 45th Space Wing provided vital support, including weather forecasts, launch and range operations, security, safety, medical and public affairs. The wing also provided its vast network of radar, telemetry, and communications instrumentation to facilitate a safe launch on the Eastern Range.\" Among work done by AFSPC is Mission Flight Control, which ensures public safety during launch. The weather conditions acceptable for launch vary by rocket and even the configurations of the rocket. Prior to liftoff are multiple sets of acceptable weather conditions that depend on the state of the rocket, particularly where the rocket is in the fuel loading process. ==Launch history== ==Upcoming launches== The schedule below includes only Launch Services Program (LSP) primary and advisory missions. The NASA Launch Schedule has the most up to date public schedule of all NASA launches. The NASA KSC News Releases will also have updates on LSP launches and mission accomplishments. The ELaNa Launch Schedule has the upcoming schedule of CubeSat missions, which occur on both NASA and non-NASA launches. A delayed version of the \"NASA ELV Payload Safety Missions in work\" is released via NASA's Public TechDoc; some of the dates may be obsolete. {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Scheduled Launch Date ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:350px;\"| Mission ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Vehicle ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Launch Site ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Total Launch Cost* (million) |- |2019 |- | TBD | ELaNa XX & Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS) | Virgin Galactic | Mojave, CA | $4.7 |- | TBD | Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) | Pegasus XL | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station | $56.3 |- |2020 |- | 2020 | Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-T (GOES-T) | Vehicle Unassigned (intermediate) | | |- | 2020 | Sentinel-6 | Falcon 9 Full Thrust | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4 East (VAFB SLC-4E) | $97 |- | 2020.02 | Solar Orbiter | Atlas V-411 | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 (CCAFS SLC-41) | $172.7 |- | Mid 2020 | Restore-L | Vehicle Unassigned | | |- | 2020.07 | Mars 2020 | Atlas V-541 | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 (CCAFS SLC-41) | $243 |- | 2020.12.16 | Landsat-9 | Atlas V-401 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3 East (VAFB SLC-3E) | $153.8 |- | 2020/2021 | NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NI-SAR)+ | Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV) Mark II | Satish Dhawan Space Centre | |- |Beyond 2020 |- | 2021 | James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) + | Ariane 5 ECA | Guiana Space Centre ELA-3 | |- | 2021.10 | Lucy | Atlas V-401 | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 (CCAFS SLC-41) | $148.3 |- | 2021 | Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) | Falcon 9 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4 East (VAFB SLC-4E) | $69 |- | 2021.04 | Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) | Falcon 9 | | |- | 2021.07 | Joint Polar Satellite System-2 (JPSS-2) | Atlas V-401 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3 East (VAFB SLC-3E) | $170.6 |- | 2022.04 | Surface Water Ocean Topography Mission (SWOT) | Falcon 9 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4 East (VAFB SLC-4E) | $112 |- | 2022 | Psyche | Falcon Heavy | Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39 (KSC LC-39A) |$117 |- | 2022 | Europa Clipper | Vehicle Unassigned: launch may be procured by SLS | | |- | 2022.08.18 | Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) | Vehicle Unassigned | | |- | 2023 | Europa Lander | Vehicle Unassigned: launch may be procured by SLS or LSP | | |- | mid-2020s | Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) | Vehicle Unassigned | | |- | 2024 | Interstellar Mapping and Acceleration Probe (IMAP) | Vehicle Unassigned | | |- | TBD | Time-Resolved Observations of Precipitation structure and storm Intensity with a Constellation of Smallsats (TROPICS) | Vehicle Unassigned: launch procurement method TBD | | |- | TBD | Multi-Angle Imager for Aerosols (MAIA) | Vehicle Unassigned: launch procurement method TBD | | |} {| class=\"wikitable\" |- |KEY |- | NET | No Earlier Than (Tentative) |- | NLT | No Later Than |- | (U/R) | Under Review |- | + | LSP Advisory Mission |- | * | The total cost for NASA to launch the mission includes the launch service, spacecraft processing, payload integration, tracking, data and telemetry, mission unique launch site ground support, and other launch support requirements.

Below are some examples of jobs within LSP that NASA has written articles on. *Flight Design analysts work on the intended course, or trajectory, of the rocket. *Telemetry engineers get tracking stations to cover all the mandatory portions of flight. Analysts from many disciplines review this data post-flight. *Weather Forecasters Balance Experience with Technology *The Failure Analysis and Materials Evaluation Lab assists the program by examining failures and figuring out what went wrong The Launch Services Program operates Hangar AE on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station. It is LSP's Launch Communications Center. For Florida launches, many of the primary LSP engineers on console are in Hangar AE. For launches from California and other launch sites, many of support LSP engineers are on console there. Launch vehicle contractors and spacecraft engineers will often operate out of the Hangar also. It gathers telemetry for rocket launches beyond those worked by LSP. ===Research=== Members of the Launch Services Program perform research relating to launching unmanned NASA spacecraft.Launch Services Program on NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) Research topics include (partial list): *Collision Avoidance (COLA)A Geometric Analysis to Protect Manned Assets from Newly Launched Objects - Cola Gap Analysis NASA *Upper-level Winds on Day-of-Launch;Assessing Upper-level Winds on Day-of- Launch (by NASA Applied Meteorology Unit) collaborations with groups such as: ** NASA Kennedy Space Center's Applied Meteorology Unit (AMU) **45th Space Wing *Slosh Fluid Dynamics Launch Services Program + Liquid Sloshing on NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) ====Slosh Fluid Dynamics Experiments==== SPHERES-Slosh SPHERES SLOSH hardware (photo credit: NASA) SPHERES-Slosh Experiment will be performed on the SPHERES Testbed on the International Space Station. The experiment launched on the Cygnus capsule going to the ISS via Orbital Sciences Corporation Commercial Resupply Services Orb-1 mission on an Antares on 2014.01.09.Station Crew Supports Science, Preps for Cargo Ship Capture NASA, 9 December 2013 The Cygnus arrived at the ISS on 2014.01.12 and will spend five weeks unloading the cargo. The SPHERES-Slosh investigation uses small robotic satellites on the International Space Station to examine how liquids move around inside containers in microgravity. A water bottle's contents slosh around differently in space than on Earth, but the physics of liquid motion in microgravity are not well understood, which affects computer simulations of liquid rocket fuel behavior. LSP leads a team that includes Florida Institute of Technology and Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The research is sponsored by the Game Changing Development (GCD) program (within NASA Technology Demonstration Office (TDO)'s Space Technology Mission Directorate). Schallhorn, Paul Acquisition of Long-Duration, Low-Gravity Slosh Data Utilizing Existing ISS Equipment (SPHERES) for Calibration of CFD Models of Coupled Fluid-Vehicle Behavior NASA Launch Services Program de Luis, Javier The SPHERES ISS Microgravity Testbed as a testbed for AR&D; and servicing (Presentation) NASA The experiment is a water tank with cameras and sensors that will be mounted between two SPHERES satellites inside the ISS. During testing, the SPHERES will move to purposely agitate the water and cause the fluid inside to slosh around, like it might in a rocket or spacecraft tank during flight. The data collected will be one of a kind. Three initial tests are expected to happen with the first couple months of launch. \"The current inability to accurately predict fuel and oxidizer behavior can result in unnecessary caution, requiring extra propellant to be added along with additional helium for tank pressurization. A better understanding of fluid slosh could not only decrease this uncertainty, but increase efficiency, reduce costs and allow additional payloads to be launched.\" Understanding from this experiment could help improve design/operations of rocket tanks and control systems. NASA's Brandon Marsell, co-principal investigator on the Slosh Project: \"Modern computer models try to predict how liquid moves inside a propellant tank. Now that rockets are bigger and are going farther, we need more precise data. Most of the models we have were validated under 1 g conditions on Earth. None have been validated in the surface tension-dominated microgravity environment of space.\" (via Langley Research Center article) Slosh is the first project on the ISS to use 3D printed materials for its experiment. NASA's Jacob Roth, project manager on the Slosh Project, on the first science session: \"The results from our first checkout run are proving interesting. While not too unexpected, the bubble/liquid interaction behavior appears to be exhibiting a slightly different interaction than current models predict.\" The team will be altering the tests for the second session based on the preliminary results.

These tests were to better understand the physical properties of the SPHERES spacecraft, notably the mass properties, prior adding any tanks to the system.Burke, Caley Nutation in the Spinning SPHERES Spacecraft and Fluid Slosh Massachusetts Institute of Technology, May 2010 Some of the tests also attempted to excite and then sense slosh within the SPHERES CO2 tank.

Distance learning via video conference connects students to LSP expertsBlair, Christopher \"NASA's Launch Services Program Connects With Students Around the World\" 18 October 2011 The office also coordinates activities and educational booths at events for NASA and the public.Blair, Christopher \"Launch Services Program Supports NASA Family Education Nights\" 1 August 2011Blair, Christopher \"NASA's Launch Services Program Supports Boy Scout Event\" 31 May 2011Blair, Christopher \"Launch Services Program (LSP) Supports 2012 NASA Project Management Challenge\" 22 February 2012Herridge, Linda \"NASA's Launch Services Program Helps Promote Black History Month\" 20 February 2011 The outreach is performed by both members of the LSP Educational Outreach Office and LSP experts throughout the program. The LSP Educational Outreach Office created the Rocket Science 101 Game. Students can pick a NASA mission, select the right rocket, and build a rocket to send the spacecraft into orbit. There are three different levels for varying ages and it is available for the computer and Apple/Android devices. ===CubeSats=== NASA and the Launch Services Program are partnering with several universities to launch small research satellites. These small satellites are called CubeSats. CubeSat Launch Initiative (CSLI) provides opportunities for small satellite payloads to fly on rockets planned for upcoming launches. As of February 2015, CSLI has selected 119 spacecraft since 2010. Educational Launch of Nanosatellites (ELaNa) and is a part of CSLI. ELaNa manifests the CubeSats selected by CSLI onto upcoming rocket launches. CubeSats were first included on the launch of LSP missions in 2011. ELaNa missions are not manifested exclusively on LSP missions; they have been a part of NRO/military launches and ELaNa V will be on an International Space Station resupply launch. ELaNa mission numbers are based on the order they are manifested; due to the nature of launching, the actual launch order differs from the mission numbers. In 2014, as a part of the White House Maker Initiative, CSLI announced its intention to launch 50 small satellites from 50 states within five years. As of July 2014, there were 21 \"rookie states\" that had not previously been selected by the CSLI In October 2015, NASA's LSP, with funding partnered by Earth Science Division of NASA's Science Mission Directorate, \"awarded multiple Venture Class Launch Services (VCLS) contracts to provide small satellites (SmallSats) -- also called CubeSats, microsats or nanosatellites -- access to low-Earth orbit.\" Three companies received $4\u20137 million firm fixed-price contracts. The intention of the VLCS contracts is to provide alternatives to the current rideshare-type approach for launch of small satellites. ===Launch history=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Launch Date (GMT) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Fact Sheet ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| CubeSats Deployed ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:375px;\"| Mission ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Vehicle ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Launch Site |- | 2011.03.04 | ELaNa-I | 3* | Glory *launch failure | Taurus XL | Vandenberg AFB Launch Complex 576 (VAFB LC-576) |- | 2011.10.28 | ELaNa-III | 6 | NPOESS Preparatory Project (NPP) | Delta II 7920-10 | Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 2 West (VAFB SLC-2W) |- | 2012.09.13 | ELaNa-VI | 4 | NROL-36 | Atlas V-401 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3 East (VAFB SLC-3E) |- | 2013.11.20 | ELaNa-IV, All ORS-3 payloads | 13 | Operationally Responsive Space-3 (ORS-3) | Minotaur I | Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) |- | 2013.12.06 | ELaNa-II | 4 | NROL-39 | Atlas V-501 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3 East (VAFB SLC-3E) |- | 2014.02.22 | ELaNa-V | 5 | SpaceX-3 Commercial Resupply Services flight (SpX-3/CRS-3) | Falcon 9 / Dragon | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (CCAFS SLC-40) |- | 2014.10.28 | ELaNa-VIII | 1* | Orbital-3 Commercial Resupply Services (Orb-3) *launch failure | Antares/Cygnus | Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) |- | 2015.01.31 | ELaNa-X | 3 | Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) | Delta II 7320 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 2 West (VAFB SLC-2W) |- | 2015.05.20 | ELaNa-XI | 4 | Air Force Space Command (AFSPC)-5/Ultra Lightweight Technology and Research Auxiliary Satellite (ULTRASat) | Atlas V-501 | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 (CCAFS SLC-41) |- | 2015.10.08 | ELaNa-XII | 4 | NROL-55 | Atlas V-401 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 3 East (VAFB SLC-3E) |- | 2015.11.04 | ELaNa-VII | 2* | Operationally Responsive Space-4 (ORS-4) *launch failure | Super Strypi | Pacific Missile Range Facility |- | 2015.12.06 | ELaNa-IX | 3 | Orbital-4 Commercial Resupply Services (Orb-4) | Atlas V-401/Cygnus | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 (CCAFS SLC-41) |- |2017.04.18 |ELaNa-XVII |3 |Orbital ATK-7 Commercial Resupply Services (OA-7) + |Atlas V-401/Cygnus |Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 41 (CCAFS SLC-41) |- | 2017.08.14 | ELaNa 22 | 7 | SpaceX-1 Commercial Resupply Services flight (SpX-12) | Falcon 9 | Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 40 (CCAFS SLC-40) |- | 2018.12.16 | ELaNa 19 | 10 | | Electron by Rocket Lab | Rocket Lab LC-1 |- | 2017.11.18 | ELaNa 14 | 4 | Joint Polar Satellite System-1 (JPSS-1) | Delta II 7920 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 2 West (VAFB SLC-2W) |- | 2018.05.21 | ELaNa 23 | 9 | | | |- | 2018.09.15 | ELaNa 18 | 5 | Ice, Cloud, and land Elevation Satellite 2 (ICESat-2), ELFIN | Delta II 7420 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 2 West (VAFB SLC-2W) |- | 2019.06.25 | ELaNa 15 | 3 | Space Test Program (STP)-2: ARMADILLO, LEO (CP9), StangSat | Falcon Heavy | Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A (KSC LC-39A) |} ===Future missions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Launch Date (GMT) ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:110px;\"| Fact Sheet ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:50px;\"| CubeSats Deployed ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:375px;\"| Mission ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:100px;\"| Vehicle ! scope=\"col\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Launch Site |- | NET 2019 | ELaNa XX | 12 | TBD | Virgin Galactic | Mojave, CA |- | (U/R) | ELaNa-XIII | 2 | FORMOSAT-5 | Falcon 9 | Vandenberg Air Force Base Space Launch Complex 4 East (VAFB SLC-4E) |} ===Community Involvement=== These two high school STEM teams are sponsored and mentored by NASA's Launch Services Program. ====FIRST Robotics: Team 1592 - Bionic Tigers==== FIRST Robotics Competition Team 1592 (the Bionic Tigers) is out of Cocoa High School (CHS) and Holy Trinity Episcopal Academy.

In addition to maintaining a YouTube playlist specifically for LSP on its channel, NASA's Kennedy Space Center social media accounts frequently post LSP news. NASA has compiled a page will all its flagship social media accounts across many different platforms. The spacecraft section of this page has accounts for many of the spacecraft launched by NASA LSP. NASA Public Affairs posts pictures and videos of NASA LSP spacecraft and rockets as they go through processing and launch.KSC Video and Photo Search search for \"Launch Services Program\" or by specific mission A launch blog is also stood up for each launch campaign and is always updated on launch day by Kennedy Space Center Public Affairs. Since NASA Socials were started in 2009, NASA LSP has participated in many for the launch of its missions: Juno, GRAIL, NPP, MSL, KSC 50th/MSL Landing, RBSP, MAVEN and more. NASA Socials allow social media followers to receive VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers. The participants post about their experiences with NASA, performing outreach to their networks. NASA LSP has provided speakers for these events, along with tour guides and other support. NASA Socials were formerly known as Tweetups. NASA has created many apps, some of which feature NASA LSP and its spacecraft. One popular app is Spacecraft 3D, which features several spacecraft launched by LSP. Developed by JPL, the app allows uses to take 3D tours of many JPL spacecraft using a printed piece of paper and their phone or tablet. Users can rotate and zoom in on the spacecraft, along with deploying movable parts of the spacecraft such as solar arrays, masts, and booms. By deploying and retracting these parts, a user can get a sense of how the spacecraft goes from the launch configuration on top of the rocket to operation configuration when it's collecting scientific data. ==Locations== LSP management, business office, and most engineers work in the Operations and Checkout Building at Kennedy Space Center. Engineers involved with telemetry work at Hangar AE, which is across the Banana River on Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.
