    "text": "The Java language has undergone several changes since JDK 1.0 as well as numerous additions of classes and packages to the standard library. Since J2SE 1.4, the evolution of the Java language has been governed by the Java Community Process (JCP), which uses Java Specification Requests (JSRs) to propose and specify additions and changes to the Java platform. The language is specified by the Java Language Specification (JLS); changes to the JLS are managed under JSR 901\\. In addition to the language changes, other changes have been made to the Java Class Library over the years, which has grown from a few hundred classes in JDK 1.0 to over three thousand in J2SE 5\\. Entire new APIs, such as Swing and Java2D, have been introduced, and many of the original JDK 1.0 classes and methods have been deprecated. Some programs allow conversion of Java programs from one version of the Java platform to an older one (for example Java 5.0 backported to 1.4) (see Java backporting tools). Regarding to Oracle Java distribution, version 11 is the currently supported long-term support (LTS) version (and Java 8 LTS to some degree). (\"Oracle Customers will receive Oracle Premier Support\"); Oracle released for the \"legacy\" Java 8 LTS the last free software \"public update\" in January 2019 for commercial use, while Oracle continues to release no-cost public updates for Java 8 for e.g. development and personal use up to at least December 2020. Java 10 is the previously supported rapid release version. Java 10 support ended on the same date that support for Java 11 began, in September 2018. Java 7 is no longer publicly supported, and Java 9 has stopped receiving updates since Java 9 was a short-term rapid release version that has been superseded by Java 10 and now Java 11. For Java 11, long-term support will not be provided by Oracle for the public; instead, the broader OpenJDK community, as AdoptOpenJDK or others, is expected to perform the work. Java 15 General Availability occurred on September 15, 2020, with Java 16 now in development. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:9px;\" |- ! Version ! Release date !

The first stable version, JDK 1.0.2, is called Java 1. ==JDK 1.1== Major additions in the release on February 19, 1997 included:Version 1.1 press release, Sun. * an extensive retooling of the AWT event model * inner classes added to the language * JavaBeans * JDBC * RMI * reflection which supported Introspection only, no modification at runtime was possible. (The ability to modify objects reflectively was added in J2SE 1.2, by introducing the AccessibleObject class and its subclasses such as the Field class.) * JIT (Just In Time) compiler on Microsoft Windows platforms, produced for JavaSoft by Symantec * Internationalization and Unicode support originating from TaligentTaligent prepares internationalisation technology for the big time ==J2SE 1.2== Codename Playground The release on December 8, 1998 and subsequent releases through J2SE 5.0 were rebranded retrospectively Java 2 and the version name \"J2SE\" (Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition) replaced JDK to distinguish the base platform from J2EE (Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition) and J2ME (Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition). This was a very significant release of Java as it tripled the size of the Java platform to 1520 classes in 59 packages. Major additions included:Version 1.2 press release, Sun. * `strictfp` keyword * the Swing graphical API was integrated into the core classes * Sun's JVM was equipped with a JIT compiler for the first time * Java plug-in * Java IDL, an IDL implementation for CORBA interoperability * Collections framework ==J2SE 1.3== Codename Kestrel The most notable changes in the May 8, 2000 release were:Version 1.3 press release, Sun. * HotSpot JVM included (the HotSpot JVM was first released in April 1999 for the J2SE 1.2 JVM) * RMI was modified to support optional compatibility with CORBA * Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) included in core libraries (previously available as an extension) * Java Platform Debugger Architecture (JPDA) * JavaSound * Synthetic proxy classes ==J2SE 1.4== Codename Merlin The February 6, 2002 release was the first release of the Java platform developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 59. Major changes included:Version 1.4 press release. * Language changes ** `assert` keyword (specified in JSR 41) * Library improvements ** Regular expressions modeled after Perl regular expressions ** Exception chaining allows an exception to encapsulate original lower-level exception ** Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) support ** Non-blocking I/O (Java) (named NIO) (specified in JSR 51) ** Logging API (specified in JSR 47) ** Image I/O API for reading and writing images in formats like JPEG and PNG ** Integrated XML parser and XSLT processor (JAXP) (specified in JSR 5 and JSR 63) ** Integrated security and cryptography extensions (JCE, JSSE, JAAS) ** Java Web Start included (Java Web Start was first released in March 2001 for J2SE 1.3) (specified in JSR 56) ** Preferences API (`java.util.prefs`) Public support and security updates for Java 1.4 ended in October 2008. Paid security updates for Oracle customers ended in February 2013. ==J2SE 5.0== Codename Tiger The release on September 30, 2004 was originally numbered 1.5, which is still used as the internal version number. The number was changed to \"better reflect the level of maturity, stability, scalability and security of the J2SE\". This version was developed under JSR 176. J2SE 5.0 entered its end-of- public-updates period on April 8, 2008; updates are no longer available to the public as of November 3, 2009. Updates were available to paid Oracle customers until May 2015. Tiger added a number of significant new language features:Version 1.5 press release.Version 1.5 full list of changes. * Generics: provides compile-time (static) type safety for collections and eliminates the need for most typecasts (type conversion) (specified by JSR 14) * Metadata: also called annotations; allows language constructs such as classes and methods to be tagged with additional data, which can then be processed by metadata-aware utilities (specified by JSR 175) * Autoboxing/unboxing: automatic conversions between primitive types (such as `int`) and primitive wrapper classes (such as ) (specified by JSR 201) * Enumerations: the `enum` keyword creates a typesafe, ordered list of values (such as `Day.MONDAY`, `Day.TUESDAY`, etc.); previously this could only be achieved by non-typesafe constant integers or manually constructed classes (typesafe enum pattern) (specified by JSR 201) * Varargs: the last parameter of a method can now be declared using a type name followed by three dots (e.g. `void drawtext(String... lines)`); in the calling code any number of parameters of that type can be used and they are then placed in an array to be passed to the method, or alternatively the calling code can pass an array of that type * Enhanced `for each` loop: the `for` loop syntax is extended with special syntax for iterating over each member of either an array or any , such as the standard classes (specified by JSR 201) * Improved semantics of execution for multi-threaded Java programs; the new Java memory model addresses issues of complexity, effectiveness, and performance of previous specifications * Static imports There were also the following improvements to the standard libraries: * Automatic stub generation for RMI objects * Swing: New skinnable look and feel, called synth * The concurrency utilities in package `java.util.concurrent` * Scanner class for parsing data from various input streams and buffers Java 5 is the last release of Java to officially support Microsoft Windows 98 and Windows ME, while Windows Vista was the newest version of Windows that J2SE 5 was supported on prior to Java 5 going end-of-life in October of 2009. Java 5 Update 5 (1.5.0_05) is the last release of Java to work on Windows 95 (with Internet Explorer 5.5 installed) and Windows NT 4.0. Java 5 was first available on Apple Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) and was the default version of Java installed on Apple Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard). Public support and security updates for Java 1.5 ended in November 2009. Paid security updates for Oracle customers ended in April 2015. ===Versioning change=== This version introduced a new versioning system for the Java language, although the old versioning system continued to be used for developer libraries: This correspondence continued through later releases (Java 6 = JDK 1.6, Java 7 = JDK 1.7, and so on). ===Java 5 updates=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | Table of Java 5 updates |- ! width=160 | Release ! width=100 | Release date !

Internal numbering for developers remains 1.6.0.Version 6, Java webnotes, Sun. This version was developed under JSR 270. During the development phase, new builds including enhancements and bug fixes were released approximately weekly. Beta versions were released in February and June 2006, leading up to a final release that occurred on December 11, 2006. Major changes included in this version:Version 1.6 press release.Version 1.6 full list of changes. * Support for older Win9x versions dropped; unofficially, Java 6 Update 7 was the last release of Java shown to work on these versions of Windows. This is believed to be due to the major changes in Update 10. * Scripting Language Support (JSR 223): Generic API for tight integration with scripting languages, and built-in Mozilla JavaScript Rhino integration. * Dramatic performance improvements for the core platform,Java Lobby . and Swing. * Improved Web Service support through JAX-WS (JSR 224). * JDBC 4.0 support (JSR 221). * Java Compiler API (JSR 199): an API allowing a Java program to select and invoke a Java Compiler programmatically. * Upgrade of JAXB to version 2.0: Including integration of a StAX parser. * Support for pluggable annotations (JSR 269). * Many GUI improvements, such as integration of SwingWorker in the API, table sorting and filtering, and true Swing double- buffering (eliminating the gray-area effect). * JVM improvements include: synchronization and compiler performance optimizations, new algorithms and upgrades to existing garbage collection algorithms, and application start-up performance. Java 6 can be installed to Mac OS X 10.5 (Leopard) running on 64-bit (Core 2 Duo and higher) processor machines. Java 6 is also supported by both 32-bit and 64-bit machines running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard). Java 6 reached the end of its supported life in February 2013, at which time all public updates, including security updates, were scheduled to be stopped. Oracle released two more updates to Java 6 in March and April 2013, which patched some security vulnerabilities. ===Java 6 updates=== After Java 6 release, Sun, and later Oracle, released several updates which, while not changing any public API, enhanced end-user usability or fixed bugs. {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | Table of Java 6 updates |- ! width=160 | Release ! width=100 | Release date ! Highlights |- | Java SE 6 | 2006-12-23 | This release adds many enhancements in the fields of Web services, scripting, databases, pluggable annotations, and security, as well as quality, compatibility, and stability.

Major changes for this update include: * Java Deployment Toolkit, a set of JavaScript functions to ease the deployment of applets and Java Web Start applications. * Java Kernel, a small installer including only the most commonly used JRE classes. Other packages are downloaded when needed. * Enhanced updater. * Enhanced versioning and pack200 support: server-side support is no longer required. * Java Quick Starter, to improve cold start-up time. * Improved performance of Java2D graphics primitives on Windows, using Direct3D and hardware acceleration. * A new Swing look and feel called Nimbus and based on synth. * Next-Generation Java Plug-In: applets now run in a separate process and support many features of Web Start applications. |- | Java SE 6 Update 11 || 2008-12-03 || 13 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 12 || 2008-12-12 || No security fixes; 64-bit Java plug-in (for 64-bit web browsers only); Windows Server 2008 support; performance improvements of graphics and JavaFX applications |- | Java SE 6 Update 13 || 2009-03-24 || 7 security fixes, JNDI store and retrieve Java objects in LDAP slightly modified, JMX Change (createMBeanunregisterMBean), 4 new root certificates added |- | Java SE 6 Update 14 || 2009-05-28 || HotSpot VM 14. This release includes extensive performance updates to the JIT compiler, compressed pointers for 64-bit machines, as well as support for the G1 (Garbage First) low-pause garbage collector. The `-XX:+DoEscapeAnalysis` option directs the HotSpot JIT compiler to use escape analysis to determine if local objects can be allocated on the stack instead of the heap. Some developers have noticed an issue introduced in this release which causes debuggers to miss breakpoints seemingly randomly. Sun has a corresponding bug, which is tracking the issue. The workaround applies to the Client and Server VMs. Using the `-XX:+UseParallelGC` option will prevent the failure. Another workaround is to roll back to update 13, or to upgrade to update 16. |- | Java SE 6 Update 15 || 2009-08-04 || Introduced patch-in-place functionality |- | Java SE 6 Update 16 || 2009-08-11 || Fixed the issue introduced in update 14 which caused debuggers to miss breakpoints |- | Java SE 6 Update 17 || 2009-11-04 || Security fixes; two new root certificates |- | Java SE 6 Update 18 || 2010-01-13 || No security fixes; Hotspot VM 16; support for Ubuntu 8.04 LTS Desktop Edition, SLES 11, Windows 7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.3, Firefox 3.6, VisualVM 1.2; updated Java DB; many performance improvements |- | Java SE 6 Update 19 || 2010-03-30 || Security fixes; root certificate changes: seven new, three removed, five replaced with stronger signature algorithms; interim fix for TLS renegotiation attack |- | Java SE 6 Update 20 || 2010-04-15 || 2 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 21 || 2010-07-07 || No security fixes; Hotspot VM 17; support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.4 and 5.5, Oracle Enterprise Linux 4.8, 5.4, 5.5; Google Chrome 4 support; support for Customized Loading Progress Indicators; VisualVM 1.2.2 |- | Java SE 6 Update 22 || 2010-10-12 || 29 security fixes; support |- | Java SE 6 Update 23 || 2010-12-08 || No security fixes; Hotspot VM 19; better support for right-to- left languages |- | Java SE 6 Update 24 ||2011-02-15 || 21 security fixes; updated Java DB |- | Java SE 6 Update 25 || 2011-03-21 || No security fixes; Hotspot VM 20; support for Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 4 and Chrome 10; improved BigDecimal; includes \"tiered\" compilation in the Server VM that enables it to start quickly as does the Client VM, while achieving better peak performance (this feature is enabled by specifying `-server` and `-XX:+TieredCompilation` command options) |- | Java SE 6 Update 26 || 2011-06-07 || 17 new security fixes; last version compatible with Windows Vista SP1 |- | Java SE 6 Update 27 || 2011-08-16 || No security fixes; certification for Firefox 5 |- | Java SE 6 Update 29 || 2011-10-18 || 20 security fixes, various bug fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 30 || 2011-12-12 || No security fixes; fix for SSL regression in Update 29; support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 |- | Java SE 6 Update 31 || 2012-02-14 || 14 security fixes and one bug fix; last version work reliably for Windows 2000 |- | Java SE 6 Update 32 || 2012-04-26 || No security fixes, various bug fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 33 || 2012-06-12 || 14 security fixes, improved VM configuration file loading |- | Java SE 6 Update 34 || 2012-08-14 || No security fixes, various bug fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 35 || 2012-08-30 || Contains a security-in- depth fix |- | Java SE 6 Update 37 || 2012-10-16 || 30 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 38 || 2012-12-11 || Various bug fixesJava SE Development Kit 6 Update 38 Bug Fixes, Oracle.com |- | Java SE 6 Update 39 || 2013-02-01 || 50 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 41 || 2013-02-19 || 5 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 43 || 2013-03-04 || 2 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 45 || 2013-04-16 || 42 security fixes; other changes; final public update. |- | Java SE 6 Update 51 || 2013-06-18 || Not available publicly, only available through the Java SE Support program and in Apple Update for OS X Snow Leopard, Lion & Mountain Lion; up to 40 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 65 || 2013-10-15 || Not available publicly, only available through the Java SE Support program and in Apple Update for OS X Snow Leopard, Lion & Mountain Lion; at least 11 critical security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 71 || 2014-01-14 || Not available for public download; 33 fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 75 || 2014-04-15 || Not available publicly, only available through the Java SE Support program and in Solaris 10's Recommended Patchset Cluster no. #54; 25 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 81 || 2014-07-15 || Not available publicly, only available through the Java SE Support program and in Solaris 10's Recommended Patchset Cluster; 11 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 85 || 2014-10-16 || Not available publicly, only available through the Java SE Support program and in Solaris 10's Recommended Patchset Cluster; 18 security fixes |- | Java SE 6 Update 91 || 2015-01-21 || Linux x64 and Windows i586 versions are available as the Java SE 6 Reference Implementation.

The development period was organized into thirteen milestones; on June 6, 2011, the last of the thirteen milestones was finished. On average, 8 builds (which generally included enhancements and bug fixes) were released per milestone. The feature list at the OpenJDK 7 project lists many of the changes. Additions in Java 7 include: * JVM support for dynamic languages, with the new `invokedynamic` bytecode under JSR-292, following the prototyping work currently done on the Multi Language Virtual Machine * Compressed 64-bit pointers (available in Java 6 with `-XX:+UseCompressedOops`) * These small language changes (grouped under a project named Coin): :* Strings in switch :* Automatic resource management in try-statement :* Improved type inference for generic instance creation, aka the diamond operator <> :* Simplified varargs method declaration :* Binary integer literals :* Allowing underscores in numeric literals :* Catching multiple exception types and rethrowing exceptions with improved type checking * Concurrency utilities under JSR 166 * New file I/O library (defined by JSR 203) adding support for multiple file systems, file metadata and symbolic links. The new packages are `java.nio.file`, `java.nio.file.attribute` and `java.nio.file.spi` * Timsort is used to sort collections and arrays of objects instead of merge sort * Library-level support for elliptic curve cryptography algorithms * An XRender pipeline for Java 2D, which improves handling of features specific to modern GPUs * New platform APIs for the graphics features originally implemented in version 6u10 as unsupported APIs * Enhanced library-level support for new network protocols, including SCTP and Sockets Direct Protocol * Upstream updates to XML and Unicode * Java deployment rule sets Lambda (Java's implementation of lambda functions), Jigsaw (Java's implementation of modules), and part of Coin were dropped from Java 7, and released as part of Java 8 (except for Jigsaw, which was released in Java 9). Java 7 was the default version to download on java.com from April 2012 until Java 8 was released. ===Java 7 updates=== Oracle issued public updates to the Java 7 family on a quarterly basisCritical Patch Update table shows four dates per year until April 2015 when the product reached the end of its public availability. Further updates for JDK 7, which are scheduled to continue until Jul 2022, are only made available to customers with a support contract. {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | Table of Java 7 updates |- ! width=160 | Release ! width=110 | Release date !

Work on features was organized in terms of JDK Enhancement Proposals (JEPs). * JSR 335, JEP 126: Language-level support for lambda expressions (officially, lambda expressions; unofficially, closures) under Project Lambda and default methods (virtual extension methods) which allow the addition of methods to interfaces without breaking existing implementations. There was an ongoing debate in the Java community on whether to add support for lambda expressions. Sun later declared that lambda expressions would be included in Java and asked for community input to refine the feature. Supporting lambda expressions also enables functional-style operations on streams of elements, such as MapReduce- inspired transformations on collections. Default methods allow an author of an API to add new methods to an interface without breaking the old code using it. Although it was not their primary intent, default methods also allow multiple inheritance of behavior (but not state). * JSR 223, JEP 174: Project Nashorn, a JavaScript runtime which allows developers to embed JavaScript code within applications * JSR 308, JEP 104: Annotation on Java types * Unsigned integer arithmetic * JSR 337, JEP 120: Repeating annotations * JSR 310, JEP 150: Date and time API * JEP 178: Statically-linked JNI libraries * JEP 153: Launch JavaFX applications (direct launching of JavaFX application JARs) * JEP 122: Remove the permanent generation Java 8 is not supported on Windows XP but as of JDK 8 update 25, it can still be installed and run under Windows XP. Previous updates of JDK 8 could be run under XP, but had to be installed after a forced installation by directly unzipping files from the installation executable. From October 2014, Java 8 was the default version to download (and then again the download replacing Java 9) from the official website. \"Oracle will continue to provide Public Updates and auto updates of Java SE 8, until at least the end of December 2020 for Personal Users, and January 2019 for Commercial Users\". ===Java 8 updates=== {| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible mw- collapsed\" |+ class=\"nowrap\" | Table of Java 8 updates |- ! width=170 | Release ! width=100 | Release date !

In the last days of June 2017, Java Community Process expressed nearly unanimous consensus on the proposed Module System scheme. * JSR 376: Modularization of the JDK under Project Jigsaw (Java Platform Module System) * JEP 222: JShell: The Java Shell (a Java REPL) * JEP 295: Ahead-of-time compilation * JEP 268: XML catalogs * JEP 266: More concurrency updates. It includes a Java implementation of Reactive Streams, including a new `Flow` class that included the interfaces previously provided by Reactive StreamsReactive Streams Releases First Stable Version for JVM JEP 266: More Concurrency Updates * JEP 193: Variable handles: define a standard means to invoke the equivalents of various `java.util.concurrent.atomic` and `sun.misc.Unsafe` operations * JEP 282: jlink: The Java Linker: create a tool that can assemble and optimize a set of modules and their dependencies into a custom run-time image.

The first stable release of Java 9 was on September 21, 2017. ===History=== At JavaOne 2011, Oracle discussed features they hoped to release for Java 9 in 2016. Java 9 should include better support for multi-gigabyte heaps, better native code integration, a different default garbage collector (G1, for \"shorter response times\") and a self-tuning JVM. In early 2016, the release of Java 9 was rescheduled for March 2017 and later again postponed four more months to July 2017. ===Java 9 updates=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! width=170 | Release ! width=100 | Release date !

This feature might be added to the switch-expression and the instance- of-expression. * Sealed types, a mechanism for declaring all possible subclasses of a class. Together with the record and pattern matching features this is used to implement algebraic data types. * Improved interoperability with native code, to enable Java source code to call functions and use data types from other languages, in a way that is easier and has better performance than today. * Virtual threads, a lightweight user-mode scheduled alternative to standard OS managed threads. Virtual threads are mapped to OS threads in many-to-many relationship, in contrast to many-to-one relationship from original green threads implementation in early versions of Java. ==Implementations== The officially supported Java platform, first developed at Sun and now stewarded by Oracle, is Java SE. Releases are based on the OpenJDK project, which is a free and open source project with an open development model. Other Java implementations exist, however\u2014in part due to Java's early history as proprietary software, while some implementations were created to offer some benefits over the standard implementation, often the result of some area of academic or corporate-sponsored research. Many GNU/Linux distributions include builds of OpenJDK through the IcedTea project started by Red Hat, which provides an easier build and integration environment. Visual J++ and the Microsoft Java Virtual Machine were created as incompatible implementations. After the Sun v. Microsoft lawsuit, Microsoft abandoned it and began work on the .NET platform. Other proprietary Java implementations are available, such as Azul's Zing; additionally, Azul offers certified open source OpenJDK builds under the Zulu moniker. Prior to the release of OpenJDK, while Sun's implementation was still proprietary, the GNU Classpath project was created to provide a free and open source implementation of the Java platform. Since the release of JDK 7, when OpenJDK became the official reference implementation, the original motivation for the GNU Classpath project almost completely disappeared and its last release was in 2012. The Apache Harmony project was started shortly before the release of OpenJDK. After Sun's initial source code release, the Harmony project continued, working to provide an implementation under a permissive license, in contrast to the copyleft license chosen for OpenJDK. Google later developed Android and released it under a permissive license. Android incorporated parts of the Harmony project, supplemented with Google's own Dalvik virtual machine and ART. Apache Harmony has since been retired, and Google has switched its use of Harmony components with equivalent ones from OpenJDK. Both Jikes and Jikes RVM are open source research projects that were developed by IBM. Several other implementations exist that started as proprietary software but are now open source. IBM initially developed OpenJ9 as the proprietary J9, but has since relicensed the project and donated it to the Eclipse Foundation. JRockit is a proprietary implementation that was acquired by Oracle and incorporated into subsequent OpenJDK versions. ==References== ==External links== * Official Java SE Downloads * Early history of Java * Full list of changes for J2SE 1.3 * Full list of changes for J2SE 1.4 * Full list of changes for J2SE 5.0 * Full list of changes for Java SE 6 * Mustang development site for Java SE 6 * Java SE 7 release notes * Sun Java Supported versions and EOL * Downloads archive for older version of Java Category:History of software Category:Java platform Category:Software version histories de:Java-Technologie#Versionen ",
