    "text": "Anadara ovalis, or the blood ark clam, is a clam in the family Arcidae. It can be found along the Atlantic coast of North America, ranging from Massachusetts to the West Indies and Brazil.Abbott, R.T. & Morris, P.A. A Field Guide to Shells: Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the West Indies. New York: Houghton Mifflin, 1995. 11. It resides from the low-tide line to a depth of ten feet. The blood ark clam is often noted for its appearance, for it usually can be found two-thirds covered by dark brown, fur-like periostracum. It also noted for its red blood, which is a result of it containing hemoglobin; this makes it different from the majority of mollusks and earned it its name. The size of it typically is between one and three inches. ==References== *http://www.mitchellspublications.com/guides/shells/articles/0002/ ==Sources== *https://web.archive.org/web/20120319221618/http://www.enature.com/fieldguides/detail.asp?recNum=SS0068 *http://barnegatshellfish.org/ark_clams02.htm ovalis Category:Bivalves described in 1787 ",
