    "text": "The Segovellauni (Gaulish: \"chiefs-of-victory\") were a small Gallic tribe, dwelling in the modern Dr\u00f4me d\u00e9partement during the Roman period. == Name == They are mentioned as Sengalauno\u00ec (\u03a3\u03b5\u03b3\u03b3\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c5\u03bd\u03bf\u1f76; var. \u03c3\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).Ptolemy. Ge\u014dgraphik\u1e15 Hyph\u1e17g\u0113sis, 2:10:7 A regio... Segovellaunorum is also attested by Pliny (1st c. AD).Pliny. Naturalis Historia, 3:34 The name Segovellauni ('chiefs-of-victory') stems from Gaulish sego- ('victory') attached to uellaunos ('chief, commandant'). == Geography == The territory of the Segovellauni was located between the Rh\u00f4ne and the Dr\u00f4me rivers. They were in control of a section of the Is\u00e8re river mouth, from which they held the Allobroges at bay. The Segovellauni nonetheless lived as clients of the neighbouring Cavares. After the Roman conquest of the region, they were incorporated into the civitas Valentinorum (or colonia Valentia), founded under Caesar or Augustus. A border land around Valentia (Valence) was probably detached from the territory of the Cavares and given to the smaller Segovellauni by the Romans, since Pliny (1st c. CE) described the settlement as in agro Cavarum, whereas Ptolemy (2nd c. CE) had it belonging to the Segovellauni. == References == === Bibliography === * * * * Category:Gauls Category:Tribes of pre-Roman Gaul Category:Historical Celtic peoples ",
