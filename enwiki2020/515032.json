The project was proposed by Richard Stallman in December 2000 and officially started in January 2001. It was moderated by H\u00e9ctor Facundo Arena, an Argentinian programmer and GNU activist. == History == Immediately upon its creation, GNUPedia was confronted by confusion with the similar-sounding Nupedia project led by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger, and controversy over whether this constituted a fork of the efforts to produce a free encyclopedia. In addition, Wales already owned the gnupedia.org domain name.Jimbo Wales gnupedia.org resolves to nupedia // bug-gnupedia mailing list - 21 Jan 2001 ()) The GNUPedia project changed its name to GNE (an abbreviation for \"GNE's Not an Encyclopedia\", a recursive acronym similar to that of the GNU Project) and switched to a knowledgebase. GNE was designed to avoid centralization and editors who enforced quality standards, which they viewed as possibly introducing bias. Jonathan Zittrain described GNE as a \"collective blog\" more than an encyclopedia. Stallman has since lent his support to Wikipedia. In The Wikipedia Revolution, Andrew Lih explains the reasons behind the demise of GNE: > Richard Stallman who inspired the free software and free culture movement > also proposed his own encyclopedia in 1999 and attempted to launch it in the > same year that Wikipedia took off. Called Gnupedia it coexisted confusingly > in the same space as Bomis's Nupedia, a completely separate product. Keeping > with tradition Stallman renamed his project GNE - GNE's not an encyclopedia. > But in the end Wikipedia's lead and enthusiastic community was already well > established and Richard Stallman put the GNE project into inactive status > and put his support behind Wikipedia. The GNU Project offers the following explanation about GNE: > Just as we were starting a project, GNUpedia, to develop a free > encyclopedia, the Nupedia encyclopedia project adopted the GNU Free > Documentation License and thus became a free commercial project. So we > decided to merge GNUpedia project into Nupedia. Now, the Wikipedia > encyclopedia project has adopted the philosophy of Nupedia and taken it even > further.
