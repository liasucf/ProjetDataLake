It was established and started operations in 1973. Its main base was Fairbanks International Airport. ==Acquisition Merger== In October 2009 Arctic Circle Air was acquired by the parent company of Frontier Alaska. Arctic Circle Air was merged into the Era Alaska operation. Era Alaska is the renamed operation of Frontier Alaska now that it has been blended into the operating certificate of Era Aviation. In 2011 Arctic Circle Air's certificate was obtained by Marianas Harvests in Guam to provide service throughout the island areas of Guam, with no association with Era Alaska or Frontier Alaska. == Fleet == *2 Britten-Norman BN-2Ts == Destinations == Arctic Circle Air operates services to the following domestic scheduled destinations (Ended as of November 2009). # Allakaket (AET) - Allakaket Airport # Anaktuvuk Pass (AKP) - Anaktuvuk Pass Airport # Arctic Village (ARC) - Arctic Village Airport # Bettles (BTT) - Bettles Airport # Chalkyitsik (CIK) - Chalkyitsik Airport # Eagle (EAA) - Eagle Airport # Fairbanks (FAI) - Fairbanks International Airport # Fort Yukon (FYU) - Fort Yukon Airport # Galena (GAL) - Edward G.
