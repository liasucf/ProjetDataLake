Star\u00e1 Lesn\u00e1 is located in an area traditionally known as Spi\u0161 and it is situated within the Slovak Tourism Region of the Tatras. ==History== The tourism region of the Tatras encompasses today the northern half (except for a tiny tip lying in Poland) of what used to be Scepusium or Szepes County. It was a part of the Kingdom of Hungary from the creation of the county in the second half of the 12th century to 1918 when Austria-Hungary ceased to exist and Czechoslovakia was created. This northern borderland was never really inhabited by Hungarians, but up until the last world war there was a substantial population of Carpathian Germans in Spi\u0161 or \"Zips\", where they began to arrive in the mid-12th century. Star\u00e1 Lesn\u00e1 was mentioned for the first time in 1294. The village was founded by the Berzeviczys, a family whose forefather Rutk\u00e9r of M\u00e1tray (Matrei), an isp\u00e1n, arrived to Spi\u0161 County from Tyrol in the beginning of the 13th century. The village belonged to a German language island. The German population was expelled in 1945. ==Geography== The population of Star\u00e1 Lesn\u00e1 is about 940 people. The municipality lies at an altitude of 736 metres and covers an area of 9.482 km\u00b2. In the north Star\u00e1 Lesn\u00e1 is bordered by the Town of High Tatras and the Tatra National Park.
