Because of its transience, the new phrase \"APEC blue\" also refers to something wonderful but also fleeting.

Among the 10 most polluted cities in the world, China has seven.Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China Ministry of Environmental Protection, the People' s Republic of China Retrieved 2014 In Jan 2013, only five days were not occupied by haze and fog. In Oct 2014, the air quality index in Beijing reached a peak of 470, far beyond the severe pollution level of 300; meanwhile, the situation was even more serious in the neighboring province of Hebei, whose PM2.5 particles climbed above 500 micrograms per cubic meter\u2014northern China was blanketed by the heavy air pollution, forcing the Chinese authorities to raise its pollution alert from yellow to orange, which was the second highest.Air Pollution Blankets Northern China, Reaches 'Hazardous' Levels RT Retrieved 10 Oct 2014 NOTES: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

President Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang and Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli were directly in charge of the clean-up campaign . Xi and Li issue a set of written instructions while Zhang monitor the anti-smog campaign in the fight of curbing air pollution. In addition, 434,000 cadres in Beijing and nearby provinces and municipalities, including Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Henan and inner Mongolia, were involved in the inspection work.How leaders and an army of staff turned Beijing\u2019s grey into APEC blue. South China Morning Post. Retrieved 17 March 2015 The core part of control measures laid on emission reduction. Roughly 10,000 factories in the regions surrounding Beijing were forced to suspend production during APEC, and an additional 39,000 ran on reduced schedules to largely alleviate pollution. Moreover, 60,100 industrial plants and 123,000 other ventures including construction sites and petrol stations are closely inspected.How did Beijing achieve \"APEC blue\"?. Bloomberg.

According to the data from Beijing municipal environmental monitoring center, from November 1 to 12, the density of PM2.5, PM10, SO2 and NO2 decreased by 55%, 44%, 57% and 31% in the same period last year; the concentrations of various pollutant was at the lowest level over the same period in the past 5 years.

As a result, real estate trade, marriage registration, food delivery, funerals and hospital appointment system were all influenced and disturbed during APEC. == Response == Most foreign media showed a doubtful position for \"APEC blue,\" considering it as a \"face-saving\" strategy of China\u2019s rulers and holding a suspicious view about its sustainable future. Young Professionals in Foreign Policy claimed that APEC blue \"was a piece of the illusion\", because \"President Xi Jinping used the summit partly as a show to demonstrate that China\u2019s economic development was the linchpin for the entire Asia-Pacific region\". In addition, China Current also pointed out that such cleaning sky control might induce more attention on air pollution from foreign media and complaint about air quality from netizens. Within China, Zhong Nanshan, a deputy of the National People's Congress, said that joint efforts nationwide might cut the time for tackling China\u2019s smog problem to 10 years instead of 30 years suggested by experts. == Impacts == The employees of controlled factories might lose money because they were forced to take a \"vacation\" in normal workdays. \"With orders and production halted, we\u2019re losing money,\" Liu Zhenyu, a steel mill worker in Tangshan, said. Some employees seized the opportunity to go traveling, \"The number of calls we received inquiring about short-distance overseas trips went up by 50 percent,\" according to the Beijing Mytour International Travel Service. Additionally, \"domestic travel is also in high demand\". As in the northern part of China, Beijing and its surrounding area are freezing cold at night. \"The local government turned the state heating network off during unseasonably cold weather, which made the residents enduring a cold few days. \" In order to perform the controls, the economic costs are massive, and all the more significant given recent forecasts of a slowdown for China\u2019s economy. Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) & Employment: Figures released by the National Bureau of Statistics and the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing reflected excess capacity and weak demand. It also showed an unfavorable situation in the labor market. (The manufacturing PMI slipped to 50.3 from 50.8 in October, and the employment component eased 0.2 point in November.) Industrial Production: As Credit Suisse estimated, an approximated one-quarter of China\u2019s steel has been affected, 13% of its cement and 3% of its industrial output.[20] It will also bring with heavy pollution, as the heating system springs into life, regular volumes of traffic return to the roads, and local industry seeks to make up for losses. Although \"APEC blue\" lasted for a very short time, it is really a part of accomplishment made by the government, which reflected China\u2019s high attention paid to the issue and the great efforts made to solve it. China Daily reported that APEC blue was listed as one of the top 10 ecological accomplishments of 2014. == Follow-up == On January 1, 2015, China\u2019s new Environmental Protection Law started to be put into force. On February 13, Zhai Qing, a vice minister for environmental protection, said that China needs to reduce emissions by 30 percent to 50 percent from current levels in order to achieve \"APEC blue\". On February 28, 2015 Under the Dome, an independent documentary related to China\u2019s air pollution by famous reporter Chai Jing, was released online, and received more than 100 million cumulative views within 48 hours. When China's annual Lianghui started on March 3, 2015, coping with the environmental problems was given particular attention. On March 7, China\u2019s new environmental minister Chen Jining attended his first press conference in Lianghui, and vowed stricter legal enforcement for improving pollution. == Potential solutions == Suggested policies that emerged from APEC blue include subway expansion to reduce car dependence and to ban barbecuing and straw-burning, encourage an economic transition toward clean fuels to lessen the need of coal and convert waste products into fuel by applying new technologies. In government administration, harsher supervision and enforcement of penalization should be applied. == References == Category:Air pollution in China Category:Asia- Pacific Economic Cooperation Category:2014 in the environment ",
