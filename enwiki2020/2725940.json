In 1685 he made his younger brother Anthony Ulrich co-ruler. ==Life== Reverse of a one-twelfth thaler coin of Rudolph Augustus He was born in Hitzacker, then the residence of his father Duke Augustus the Younger of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg and his second wife Princess Dorothea of Anhalt-Zerbst. His father assumed the rule in the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel, after his Welf cousin Duke Frederick Ulrich had died childless in 1634. Rudolph Augustus succeeded his father as ruling Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in 1666. More interested in his studies and hunting, he soon after appointed his politically astute younger brother Anthony Ulrich governor. In 1671 both besieged and finally occupied the city of Braunschweig, ending about 250 years of local autonomy. During his reign, Rudolph Augustus concentrated on the Baroque expansion of his ducal residence, including the Alter Weg (\"Old Way\"), a road connecting the cities of Brunswick and Wolfenb\u00fcttel. He died in 1704 at the Hedwigsburg hunting lodge. ==Marriage and issue== In 1650 Rudolph Augustus married Christine Elizabeth (1634-1681), daughter of Count Albert Frederick of Barby and M\u00fchlingen. They had two daughters that reached adulthood: * Dorothea Sophia (1653\u20131722), married Duke John Adolphus of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Pl\u00f6n * Christine Sophia (1654\u20131695), married her cousin Duke Augustus William of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg, the son of Duke Anthony Ulrich who succeeded his father as Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel in 1714. Upon the death of his first wife, Rudolph Augustus entered into a morganatic marriage with Rosine Elisabeth Menthe (1663\u20131701), which remained childless. ==Ancestry== ==References== ==External links== Category:1627 births Category:1704 deaths Category:People from Hitzacker Category:Princes of Wolfenb\u00fcttel Category:New House of Brunswick ",
