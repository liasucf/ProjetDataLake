    "text": "Wanlockhead railway station was opened on 1 October 1902 as the terminus on the Leadhills and Wanlockhead Light Railway and served the lead mining area, farms and the village of Wanlockhead. Elvanfoot railway station in South Lanarkshire was the junction for the branch and was located on the west coast main line. It remained open until 2 January 1939 for passengers and freight. When Wanlockhead station opened in 1902, a year after Leadhills station, it became the highest standard gauge adhesion station in the United Kingdom at 1413 feet, seven miles and 24 chains from Elvanfoot.Ireland, Page 17 ==History== Operated by the Caledonian Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The line had been closed and lifted before the Scottish Region of British Railways came into existence upon nationalisation in 1948. The line suffered greatly from the closure of the lead mines and passenger traffic was slight, although the station was located near to the small village of Wanlockhead. ==Infrastructure== Glengonnar Halt, terminus of the narrow gauge line. To save on costs the passenger stations at Wanlockhead had only slightly raised platforms and therefore passenger carriages had three levels of step board fitted which folded down to enable passengers to board and depart. The platform at Wanlockhead was demarcated by a wooden fence and a passing loop of 100 yards length was provided.Ireland, Page 31 A siding served a loading bank and another the goods shed. The waiting room, stationmaster's office, ticket office and men's toilet were located in a wooden lean-to building built along the long side of the goods shed.Ireland, Page 32 No signals were present, however a telephone was provided. The points were worked by ground frames in the absence of a signal box. In 1916 a new siding was installed at the north side of the line.Ireland, Page 38 ==The site today== The track had already been lifted by April 1939 and the buildings demolished.Ireland, Page 54 The Leadhills and Wanlockhead Railway narrow gauge line and station are to be extended from Glengonnar Halt towards the site of the old station and its trackbed in the near future (datum 2019).Wham, Page 180 == References == === Notes === === Sources === * * Ireland, Alastair (2011).
