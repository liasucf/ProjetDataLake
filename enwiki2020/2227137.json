Her childhood was not happy and her father died in 1792. In 1808 she married Jan Alois Sudiprav Rettig, a Czech patriot from a half-German speaking family. Under his influence she learned to speak and write correctly in the Czech language and also started to use her middle name Dobromila. Rettigov\u00e1 was active in the Czech National Revival movement, also helped to found an educational institute for girls (her main advice for the girls was to keep their husband happy no matter what). Of her 11 children only three survived into adult age. She died, aged 60, in Litomy\u0161l. Her early literary works were mostly syrupy and sentimental texts. In 1826 Rettigov\u00e1 published her legendary (in Czech circles) recipe book \"A Household Cookery Book or A Treatise on Meat and Fasting Dishes for Bohemian and Moravian Lasses\". This book became a 19th-century bestseller and for a long time remained the only cookery book written in Czech. Rettigov\u00e1 continued to improve the book with culinary experiments. Most of the recipes in her cookbook were written without access to foreign spices, and thus require adaptation to fit with modern lifestyle. The book is still being reprinted and a copy can be found in libraries of many Czech households. ==References== Category:Czech food writers Category:1785 births Category:1845 deaths Category:Czech women dramatists and playwrights Category:19th-century Czech dramatists and playwrights Category:19th-century women writers ",
