She crushes hard and crushes often, but always in secret. Because no matter how many times her twin sister, Cassie, tells her to woman up, Molly can\u2019t stomach the idea of rejection. So she\u2019s careful. Fat girls always have to be careful. Then a cute new girl enters Cassie\u2019s orbit, and for the first time ever, Molly\u2019s cynical twin is a lovesick mess. Meanwhile, Molly\u2019s totally not dying of loneliness\u2014except for the part where she is. Luckily, Cassie\u2019s new girlfriend comes with a cute hipster-boy sidekick. Will is funny and flirtatious and just might be perfect crush material. Maybe more than crush material. And if Molly can win him over, she\u2019ll get her first kiss and she\u2019ll get her twin back. There\u2019s only one problem: Molly\u2019s coworker Reid. He\u2019s an awkward Tolkien superfan with a season pass to the Ren Faire, and there\u2019s absolutely no way Molly could fall for him.
