    "text": "Leonardo Javier Ramos (born 21 August 1989) is an Argentine footballer currently playing for C.F Pachuca in Liga MX. ==Club career== ===Argentina=== Born in Merlo but raised in neighboring Marcos Paz, Ramos played his first senior football with Nueva Chicago. His best goal scoring seasons in Argentina were with Armenio while playing in the third tier, scoring 27 goals over two seasons. ===Chile=== Ramos signed for his first team abroad, San Marcos de Arica, ahead of their return season in Chile's Primera Divisi\u00f3n in 2014. He made three starts in the Apertura, scoring his first goal against Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola on 3 August, but was not involved for the club's last seven games. Ramos was more involved in the Clausura, appearing in every game, making 12 starts and scoring 7 goals, including a brace against Espa\u00f1ola. The club's 8th place finish was good enough to qualify for a 4-team playoff for the country's final continental bid. Ramos scored the equalizer in the second leg of their semi-final against Uni\u00f3n La Calera, sending the tie to penalties. Ramos scored in the victorious shootout, setting up a two-legged tie with Universidad Cat\u00f3lica. Ramos scored twice in the home leg at the Carlos Dittborn, but San Marcos ultimately fell short of their first continental appearance in a penalty shootout after the tie had finished 4\u20134 on aggregate. ===Platanias=== Ramos played one season in Europe, playing for Platanias in Greece in the 2015\u201316 season. He appeared in 25 games for the Cretan club; 12 from the start and 13 off the bench. Ramos tallied four goals as well. After the season, Ramos returned to Argentina, playing for Atlanta in the third tier. His 13 goals were fourth in the league as Atlanta finished in third, bowing out of the promotion playoffs in the quarterfinals. ===Japan=== Ramos joined Renofa Yamaguchi FC in July 2017, halfway through the club's campaign in the Japanese second tier, the J2 League. Playing under Argentinian manager Carlos Mayor, Ramos made his debut on 29 July, scoring a goal off the bench against Yokohama FC. Ramos finished his first and only season in Asia with 7 goals in 17 games, and he made the move to Mexico for the first time after the season. ===Cafetaleros de Tapachula=== Ramos joined Cafetaleros de Tapachula of Ascenso MX ahead of their Clausura campaign in 2018. Having scored twice in Copa MX, Ramos scored his first goals in the league in his second start, netting a hat trick against Celaya on 4 February. He did not score in his next four games, but four goals in four games in March helped Tapachula sneak into the play-offs in 8th position. Ramos scored six goals in the Liguilla, including three in the quarterfinals against first place Zacatecas, and the only goal of the home leg of the final against UdeG. Tapachula beat UdeG 3\u20132 over two legs in the final, winning the first title in their history. Ineligible for promotion, Tapachula did play a promotion final against Oaxaca for prize money. Ramos scored the first goal of a 5\u20131 first leg victory, and the club won the prize money from would-be relegated Lobos BUAP. ====Lobos BUAP (loan)==== Ramos joined Lobos BUAP on loan at the end of August, halfway into Apertura 2018. After a period of regaining fitness, Ramos was inserted into the squad, and scored on his debut, against Pumas UNAM on 16 September. His goal the following week against Le\u00f3n gave the club their second win of the campaign, and also made Ramos their first player with multiple goals. Ramos scored twice the following week against Morelia in a 3\u20131 victory, and he scored a goal in his next three games. His first game for Lobos without a goal was on 4 November, against Tijuana. Ramos finished with 8 goals, good for sixth, despite only playing in 9 games. Ramos began the Clausura with 4 goals in 3 games, highlights by a brace inside 10 minutes against Necaxa in a 3\u20132 defeat on 20 January. Ramos finished the season with 8 goals in 14 appearances, missing the month of March with injury. As Lobos's center- forward, Ramos scored 16 goals in 23 appearances, finishing joint-third, behind Andr\u00e9-Pierre Gignac and Julio Furch. After the season, Lobos BUAP sold their license in Liga MX to FC Ju\u00e1rez, and Ramos was forced to find a new team. ===Le\u00f3n=== Ramos joined Club Le\u00f3n, runners-up of the previous tournament, ahead of Apertura 2019, after his previous club were removed from the league. Ramos debuted for Le\u00f3n on 20 July, scoring the final goal of a 3\u20131 victory over Pachuca, having come off the bench to replace center forward Jos\u00e9 Juan Mac\u00edas. ==International career== Ramos has never been called up by Argentina at any level, but has mentioned a willingness to accept a call up from Mexico following his naturalization. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Tapachula *Ascenso MX: Clausura 2018 == References == ==External links== * Profile at BDFA * * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:Argentine footballers Category:Argentine expatriate footballers Category:Deportivo Armenio footballers Category:General Lamadrid footballers Category:Nueva Chicago footballers Category:El Porvenir footballers Category:San Marcos de Arica footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Renofa Yamaguchi FC players Category:Lobos BUAP footballers Category:Club Le\u00f3n footballers Category:Argentine Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Liga MX players Category:Expatriate footballers in Chile Category:Expatriate footballers in Mexico Category:Expatriate footballers in Japan Category:Association football forwards ",
