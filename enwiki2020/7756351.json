    "text": "The \u00c9cole Centrale de Marseille is a leading graduate school of engineering (or Grande \u00e9cole of engineering) located in Marseille, the second largest city in France. The \u00c9cole Centrale de Marseille was created in 2006 by the merging of different previous institutions and has its origins from the \u00c9cole d'ing\u00e9nieurs de Marseille founded in 1890. It is one of the Centrale Graduate Schools (Paris, Lyon, Lille, Nantes, Marseille and Beijing) and a member of the TIME (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network. == Academic profile == The Ecole Centrale de Marseille is a multidisciplinary school, where the great majority of the students have endured two or three years of intensive maths and physics training (known as prepa). The students do not have any particular major before the last year (Master's level), during which they have to choose among a few electives: * Mechanical engineering * Chemical engineering * Physics, optics and electrical engineering * Business Administration and Finance * Mathematics and computer science The students can also complete their last year in one of the other Centrale Graduate Schools or be part of an exchange program. There are three-years PhD programs available in all the aforementioned domains of research (the students are required to have completed a Master's program). === Exchange programs === Being a part of the TIME (Top Industrial Managers for Europe) network, the school has exchange program with many universities across the world, among them Technical University of Munich (Germany), Cranfield University (UK), Royal Institute of Technology (Sweden), Penn State (USA), University of S\u00e3o Paulo (Brazil), University of Waterloo (Canada), Keio University (Japan) or University of Chile (Chile). === Research === Eight research laboratories are under the joint leadership of Ecole Centrale Marseille and Aix-Marseille University : * Laboratory for Mechanics and Acoustics (LMA - Laboratoire de M\u00e9canique et d'Acoustique) * Institut Fresnel (Optics, Photonics and Signal Processing) * Institute of Research on Non Equilibrium Phenomena (IRPHE - Institut de Recherche sur les Ph\u00e9nom\u00e8nes Hors \u00c9quilibre) * Institute of Molecular Sciences of Marseille (iSm2 - Institut des sciences mol\u00e9culaires de Marseille) * Mechanics, Modelling and Clean Processes (M2P2 - M\u00e9canique Mod\u00e9lisation et Proc\u00e9d\u00e9s Propres) * Research Group in Quantitative Economics of Aix-Marseille (GREQAM - Groupe de Recherche en \u00c9conomie Quantitative) * Laboratory of Analysis, Topology, and Probability (LATP - Laboratoire d\u2019Analyse, Topologie, Probabilit\u00e9s) * Laboratory of Fundamental Computer Science (LIF - Laboratoire d\u2019Informatique Fondamentale) === Rankings === Ecole Centrale de Marseille is ranked among the top 20http://integrer.centrale-marseille.fr/centrale- marseille-dans-les-classements French Grandes Ecoles, though it doesn't appear in international rankings due to its very limited number of students (250 students for the class of 2016). == Alumni == The alumni network is made of over 14,000 graduates.https://www.centraliens-marseille.fr === Notable alumni === *Simon M\u00e9ry, co-founder in 1899 of the French motor company Turcat-M\u00e9ry *Alain Dutheil (1969), former COO at STMicroelectronics, former CEO at ST- Ericsson *Fran\u00e7ois Guibert (1978), CEO at STMicroelectronics Asia-Pacific == References == == External links == * Marseille Category:Educational institutions established in 1890 ",
