    "text": "Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste (; 21 June 1226 \u2013 7 December 1279) was Duke of Sandomierz in Lesser Poland from 1232 and High Duke of Poland from 1243 until his death, as the last male representative of the Lesser Polish branch of Piasts. ==Birth and nickname== Boles\u0142aw V was born on 21 June 1226 at Stary Korczyn,Date provided by the Rocznik kapitu\u0142y krakowskiej and Rocznik Traski. See: K. Jasi\u0144ski: Rodow\u00f3d Piast\u00f3w ma\u0142opolskich i kujawskich, Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Wroc\u0142aw 2001, p. 44. as the third child and only son of Leszek I the White by his wife Grzymis\u0142awa, a Rurikid princess of disputed parentage. Named after his great- grandfather Boles\u0142aw Wrymouth, the numeral V was assigned to him in the Poczet kr\u00f3l\u00f3w Polskich.August Bielowski: Pomniki dziejowe Polski, vol. 3, Lw\u00f3w 1878, p. 294; K. Jasi\u0144ski: Rodow\u00f3d Piast\u00f3w ma\u0142opolskich i kujawskich, Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Wroc\u0142aw 2001, p. 44. His nickname of \"Chaste\" (Latin: PudicusAccording to Aleksander Krawczuk the proper translation was \"modest\". See: Skromne jak dzieci\u0105tko in: wyborcza.pl [retrieved 11 February 2015].), appeared relatively early and was already mentioned in the Rocznik franciszka\u0144ski krakowski.Rocznik franciszka\u0144ski krakowski, p. 46: \"Lestko genuit [...] dueem Bolezlaum Pudicum\". See. K. Jasi\u0144ski: Rodow\u00f3d Piast\u00f3w ma\u0142opolskich i kujawskich, Pozna\u0144 \u2013 Wroc\u0142aw 2001, p. 44. It was given to him by his subjects because of the vows of chastity that Boles\u0142aw V and his wife Kinga of Hungary had jointly taken; for this reason, their marriage was never consummated. The marital chastity and lack of mistresses by the Prince resulted from his exceptional devotion and mortification, and was evidently influenced by his closest female relatives. ==Youth== ===Father's death=== On 24 November 1227, during the Congress of G\u0105sawa, Boles\u0142aw V's father, Leszek the White, was killed. Like his own father and paternal grandfather before him, he was orphaned at young age. After Duke Leszek's death many people claimed the custody of his only son. The nobility of Krak\u00f3w wanted the regency to be exercised by Dowager Duchess Grzymis\u0142awa, jointly with the local voivode and bishop; however, this was contrary to the treaty of mutual inheritance signed in 1217 by Leszek and W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks, under which it was agreed that in the event of the death of one of them, the other would take the government of his domains and custody of his minor children. On 6 December 1227 Casimir I of Kuyavia - who probably represented his father Konrad I of Masovia at the funeral of Leszek I - advanced his father's claims over the custody of Boles\u0142aw V and his inheritance as his closest male relative.J. Szymczak: Udzia\u0142 syn\u00f3w Konrada I Mazowieckiego w realizacji jego plan\u00f3w politycznych, \"Rocznik \u0141\u00f3dzki\" 29, 1980, p. 9. Due to the lack of response, Konrad I came to Skaryszew to negotiate with Grzymis\u0142awa and the local nobility in the first half of March 1228, with regard to assuming the guardianship of his nephew during his minority.Benedykt Zientara: Henryk Brodaty i jego czasy, ed. TRIO, Warsaw 2006, p. 292 The nobility, especially the Gryfici family, preferred the rule of W\u0142adys\u0142aw III Spindleshanks, but at that point he was in the midst of fighting with his nephew W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic and was unable to claim his rights. Konrad I then appeared in the northern part of Krak\u00f3w, but at his side were only the Top\u00f3r and Sztarza families,W. Semkowicz: R\u00f3d Awda\u0144c\u00f3w w wiekach \u015brednich, vol. 3, p. 163 and so this attempt to take the Seniorate failed. According to Kazimierz Krotowski, the absence from Lesser Poland was the cause of the Prussian invasion to Masovia.Kazimierz Krotoski: Walka o tron krakowski w roku 1228, ed. W. L. Anczyc i Sp., 1895, p. 348. ===Adoption by W\u0142adys\u0142aw Spindleshanks === On 5 May 1228, a meeting was organized in Cienia between W\u0142adys\u0142aw Spindleshanks and a delegation of Krak\u00f3w nobles, which included Bishop Iwo Odrow\u0105\u017c; voivode Marek Gryfita; Pakos\u0142aw Awdaniec the Old, voivode of Sandomierz; and M\u015bciw\u00f3j, castellan of Wi\u015blica. Under the terms of the meeting, W\u0142adys\u0142aw agreed to the adoption of Boles\u0142aw V, making him his successor over Krak\u00f3w and Greater Poland. After the meeting, W\u0142adys\u0142aw arrived in Krak\u00f3w, where Grzymis\u0142awa formally gave him the rule of the city. The dowager duchess and her son received the Duchy of Sandomierz, where she exercised the regency. Shortly afterwards W\u0142adys\u0142aw Odonic escaped from prison and the fight for Greater Poland was resumed. W\u0142adys\u0142aw Spindleshanks was forced to leave Krak\u00f3w. Then the local nobility, with the consent of Grzymis\u0142awa, called Henry the Bearded to Krak\u00f3w, but only to rule as a governor.W\u0142adys\u0142aw Spindleshanks formally retained the rights of high duke, and in 1228 Henry I the Bearded did not accept the title of Duke of Krak\u00f3w. In the summer of 1228 Konrad I of Masovia attacked Krak\u00f3w, but was defeated at the Battle of Ska\u0142a by Henry I's son, Henry the Pious. However, a year later Konrad I captured Henry the Bearded and occupied Sieradz-\u0141\u0119czyca and later Sandomierz, removing Grzymis\u0142awa from power, despite resistance from the local nobility. In 1230 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Spindleshanks, with the help of Henry I, made an unsuccessful attempt to recover his lands. W\u0142adys\u0142aw died one year later in exile in Racib\u00f3rz. W\u0142adys\u0142aw's will named Henry the Bearded heir to Krak\u00f3w and Greater Poland. In 1231, with the support of the Gryfici family, Henry obtained the rule over Sandomierz, after Grzymis\u0142awa (who feared for the future of the inheritance of her infant son) surrendered the regency. During 1231-1232 Henry fought against Konrad for Lesser Poland; by the autumn of 1232 Henry finally obtained control over Lesser Poland and Konrad could only keep Sieradz-\u0141\u0119czyca. ===Imprisonment by Konrad I of Masovia=== In 1233 Konrad I of Masovia captured Grzymis\u0142awa and her son after personally robbing and beating them, according to a bull of Pope Gregory IX. Boles\u0142aw V and his mother were imprisoned firstly in Czersk and then in Sieciech\u00f3w. The humiliations to the dowager duchess continued there, including a slap in the face by Konrad I. Henry the Bearded decided to rescue the imprisoned prince and his mother; shortly thereafter Boles\u0142aw and Grzymis\u0142awa managed to escape from the monastery of Sieciech\u00f3w with the help of Krak\u00f3w voivode Klement of Ruszcza and Miko\u0142aj Gall, who was in charge of the prisoners. Both Klement and Miko\u0142aj bribed the guards, who were busy drinking, and did not pay attention to the prisoners, who left the monastery in disguise. Jan D\u0142ugosz described the events as follows: ::When one night the guards after drink and feast forgot their duties, abandoned their posts and quietly during the night Duke Boles\u0142aw and his mother secretly left the monastery. For safety reasons, Henry the Bearded hid Boles\u0142aw and his mother in the fortress of Ska\u0142a near the valley of the Pr\u0105dnik river. Then, on behalf of her son, Grzymis\u0142awa renounced his rights over Krak\u00f3w to Henry. In 1234 a war between Henry and Konrad for Lesser Poland broke out. Thanks to Archbishop Pe\u0142ka, the Treaty of Luchani was signed in August of that year, under which Boles\u0142aw received Sandomierz and gave several castles to Henry. In June 1235, Pope Gregory IX approved the Treaty of Luchani; however, shortly afterwards Konrad invaded Sandomierz, and as a result of this invasion Boles\u0142aw lost the district of Radom. Henry the Bearded died in 1238, and his son Henry the Pious succeeded him. Like his father, he took the regency of Boles\u0142aw and his Duchy of Sandomierz. In 1239 in Wojnicz, the 13-year-old Boles\u0142aw met his bride, the 15-year-old Kinga (also known as Kunigunda), daughter of King B\u00e9la IV of Hungary. The wedding was celebrated shortly thereafter. Kinga spent her first years in Sandomierz with her mother- in-law. On 9 July of that year, a meeting also took place in Przedb\u00f3rz between Boles\u0142aw and Konrad, at which the Masovian ruler agreed to renounce his claims over Sandomierz. It was at this point that Boles\u0142aw began his personal government. ===Fall of Krak\u00f3w=== In 1241 the first Mongol invasion of Poland occurred. In January the Mongols took Lublin and Zawichost. Boles\u0142aw, with his mother and wife, fled to Hungary at the side of his older sister Salomea, wife of the Hungarian prince Coloman, leaving his lands without his leadership. On 13 February the Mongols conquered and burned Sandomierz, and on 11 March he refused to participate in the Battle of Chmielnik. One month later, on 9 April, the Battle of Legnica took place, in which the army commanded by High Duke Henry II the Pious was defeated, and the duke himself was killed. After the defeat of the Hungarian army at the Battle of the Saj\u00f3 River two days later (11 April) - where Prince Coloman was seriously injured and died shortly after - Boles\u0142aw V and his family (including Salomea, now a widow) fled to Moravia, and then eventually returned to Poland. After the death of Henry the Pious, his eldest son, Boles\u0142aw the Bald, took the title of high duke; however, he did not appear in Krak\u00f3w, where the government was exercised by Klement of Ruszcza on his behalf. Konrad I of Masovia took this opportunity, and despite the strong resistance of the knights and nobility, he finally entered Krak\u00f3w on 10 July 1241. A few months later, the fortress of Ska\u0142a, held by Klement of Ruszcza, capitulated. Despite his success, Konrad failed to gain the support of the local nobility, victims of Konrad's mercenaries (the Teutonic Order) themselves, who in 1243 appointed Boles\u0142aw the Chaste as their new ruler. On 25 May of that year the Battle of Suchodo\u0142y took place, in which the Lesser Poland and Hungarian (Sarmatian) troops, under the command of Klemens of Ruszcza, defeated the Masovian troops of Konrad. With this victory, Boles\u0142aw the Chaste regained the government over Krak\u00f3w. Now at the age of 17, he was the high duke of Poland; however, he remained under the strong influence of his mother until her death. Later that year, Konrad tried to regain the control over Krak\u00f3w and attacked Boles\u0142aw, but was again defeated. ==Adulthood== ===Struggle with Konrad=== Konrad I of Masovia until his death attempted to realize his ambition to become high duke and ruler of Krak\u00f3w. In 1246, together with his son Casimir and supported by Lithuanian and Opole troops, he attacked Lesser Poland again. In the Battle of Zarysz\u00f3w the troops of Boles\u0142aw were defeated. The duke of Krak\u00f3w lost Lel\u00f3w, but Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz managed to resist. The lack of funds for war forced Boles\u0142aw to take some properties of his wife, Kinga, which were paid only on 2 March 1257 during a meeting at Nowy Korczyn, when she received the district of Stary S\u0105cz. In the autumn of 1246 was brought the final solution to the conflict when Boles\u0142aw retook Lel\u00f3w. Konrad died on 31 August 1247, but his son Casimir continued the fight. During 1254-1255 Boles\u0142aw sought the release of Siemowit I of Masovia and his wife, Pereyaslava, who were captured by his brother Casimir. They were finally released in the spring of 1255 after lengthy negotiations. In 1258 Boles\u0142aw the Pious started a long and destructive war against Casimir and his ally \u015awi\u0119tope\u0142k (Swantopolk) II for the castellany of L\u0105d. Boles\u0142aw the Chaste joined in the Greater Poland coalition against the duke of Kuyavia. Between 29 September and 6 October 1259 Boles\u0142aw the Chaste, together with Boles\u0142aw the Pious, sacked Kujawy. A peace treaty was finally concluded on 29 November 1259. In 1260, Casimir I took over the fortress of Lel\u00f3w. On 12 December during a meeting at Przedb\u00f3rz, Boles\u0142aw the Chaste mediated the dispute between Casimir and Siemowit, which ended in a mutual treaty. ===Cooperation with Hungary=== Boles\u0142aw the Chaste and Boles\u0142aw the Pious were both allies of the Kingdom of Hungary. Their links with the Hungarians probably resulted from their family relationships, as both of their wives were daughters of King B\u00e9la IV and most of their Polish and Hungarian knights were descendants of the Sarmatian Iazyges, Siraces and Serboi. In 1245 both rulers supported the expedition of Rostislav Mikhailovich, who was the Hungarian candidate for the throne of Halych. On 17 August the Battle of Jaros\u0142aw took place, where the Polish and Hungarian troops were defeated. Finally, a peace treaty was signed at \u0141\u0119czyca. In June and July 1253 Polish- Russian forces, including the army of Boles\u0142aw the Chaste, rushed to Moravia in support of the Hungarian expedition to Vindelicia (Austria), which was under the rule of King Ottokar II of Bohemia. The war failed to achieve a settlement, despite the Polish-Russian army looting several villages. The conflict ended with a treaty; at this time, Ottokar (with the help of Bishop Pawe\u0142 of Krak\u00f3w) tried to persuade Boles\u0142aw the Chaste to join at his side. In 1260 another conflict erupted between Hungary and Bohemia, when the Hungarian prince Stephen organized a marauding expedition to the Duchy of Carinthia. From June to July 1260 Boles\u0142aw, with Leszek the Black, helped the Hungarians with troops in their fight against Bohemia. On 12 July the Battle of Kressenbrunn took place, which ended with the defeat of the Hungarian army. On 29 January 1262 during a meeting at Iwanowice, Boles\u0142aw the Chaste promised to give military support to Boles\u0142aw the Pious in his conflict with Henry the White, who was a supporter of the Kingdom of Bohemia. On 7 June a second meeting took place at Dank\u00f3w, where peace negotiations with Henry took place. At this opportunity, W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolski tried unsuccessfully to make a quadruple alliance with the Bohemian king, Boles\u0142aw the Chaste, and Boles\u0142aw the Pious. King B\u00e9la IV came into conflict with his son Stephen, which caused an civil war in Hungary. In March 1266 Boles\u0142aw and his wife Kinga arranged a meeting at Buda, at which Stephen was committed to maintain peaceful relations with his father, Ottokar II, Boles\u0142aw the Chaste, Leszek the Black, and Boles\u0142aw the Pious. In 1270 the new King Stephen V of Hungary visited Boles\u0142aw the Chaste in Krak\u00f3w, where they signed an eternal peace. In the same year, Stephen V renewed the war against Bohemia for the Babenberg inheritance, which ended in the defeat of Hungary. In 1271 Boles\u0142aw, with the help of Rurikid princes, organized an expedition to the Duchy of Wroc\u0142aw, because Henry the White was an ally of Bohemia. King Stephen V died on 6 August 1272, and after this the alliance between Boles\u0142aw the Chaste and the Kingdom of Hungary was completely broken. In 1277 Boles\u0142aw finally made a peace treaty with Bohemia at Opava. With the new king of Hungary, Ladislaus IV, a minor, Boles\u0142aw became an ally of the Kingdom of Bohemia; however, during the conflict between Ottokar and King Rudolph I of Germany, he opted for the Hungarian side. On 26 August 1278 Boles\u0142aw was present in the decisive Battle on the Marchfeld, where Ottokar was defeated and killed. ===Christianization of the Yotvingians=== One of the aims of Boles\u0142aw's foreign policy was the Christianization of the Yotvingians. During 1248-1249 he organized an expedition against them, supported by Siemowit I. However, the expedition ended in failure. Between 1256-1264 the Yotvingians invaded and plundered Lesser Poland. In the spring of 1264, Boles\u0142aw organized a retaliatory expedition against them, which ended with a victory of the Krak\u00f3w-Sandomierz troops and the death of the Yotvingian prince Komata. For the Christianization of this tribe, Boles\u0142aw created a bishopric in \u0141uk\u00f3w on the northeastern border of Lesser Poland. In this cause he counted on the support of his sister Salomea and Pope Innocent IV, who in 1254 issued a special document. In the end the mission failed. ===Second Mongol invasion=== Prince Daniel of Galicia was at the side of Boles\u0142aw as an ally of Hungary in the conflict with the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1253 after the war with Bohemia, the relation between Boles\u0142aw and Daniel was good. Daniel visited Krak\u00f3w, where he met the papal legate Opizo, who wanted to crown him. The coronation finally took place at Drohiczyn on the Bug River. Boles\u0142aw and his sister Salomea supported this event, because they wanted Daniel and his principality to acquire the Latin rite. The second Mongol invasion of Poland shattered those plans. In November 1259 the Mongols and Ruthenians invaded and destroyed Sandomierz, Lublin and Krak\u00f3w; Boles\u0142aw fled to either Hungary or Sieradz, ruled by Leszek the Black. In February 1260 the Mongols left Lesser Poland, and Boles\u0142aw then returned to his lands. At this point his relations with Daniel of Galicia improved; in 1262 they signed a treaty in Tarnawa. After Daniel's death in 1265 a Lithuanian-Russian army invaded and ravaged the Lesser Poland districts of Skaryszew, Tarczek, and Wi\u015blica. During 1265\u221266 Boles\u0142aw fought against Daniel's son Shvarn and brother Vasilko Romanovich, who helped the Lithuanians in their invasion into Lesser Poland. On 19 June 1266 Shvarn was defeated at the Battle of Wrota. The conflict ended in 1266, when Boles\u0142aw abandoned his expeditions to Yotvingia. In July 1273 the Lithuanians invaded Lublin. In retaliation, Leszek the Black organized an expedition to Yotvingia in December of that year. In 1278 the Lithuanians again invaded Lublin, and they clashed with Leszek's army at the Battle of \u0141uk\u00f3w. ===Adoption of Leszek the Black=== Because Boles\u0142aw and his wife Kinga made a vow of chastity, their marriage was childless. In 1265 Boles\u0142aw adopted Leszek the Black as his heir. In 1273 W\u0142adys\u0142aw Opolski organized a military expedition to Krak\u00f3w, because he refused to accept the adoption. On 4 June the Battle of Bogucin Ma\u0142y took place, where the army from Opole-Racib\u00f3rz was defeated. At the end of October, Boles\u0142aw made a retaliatory expedition against Opole-Racib\u00f3rz; however, the forces were limited only to destroy specific areas of the duchy. In 1274 W\u0142adys\u0142aw and Boles\u0142aw V the Chaste decided to conclude a peace, under which the Duke of Opole-Racib\u00f3rz gave up his claims over the throne of Krak\u00f3w. ===Internal policies=== Boles\u0142aw V paid particular attention to urban development. On 27 February 1253 he granted privileges to the city of Bochnia. On 5 June 1257 during a meeting at Kopernia near Pi\u0144cz\u00f3w, he granted the Magdeburg rights to the district of Krak\u00f3w, and a year later to the city of Nowy Korczyn. In 1264, the city of Skaryszew also received the rights, and in 1271 during a meeting at Krak\u00f3w, the city of J\u0119drzej\u00f3w also obtained the rights. The implementation of the German-styled law led to the rapid economic development in the principality, which experienced losses, up to 75% in population alone, due to Mongol raids. In addition, the reform in the administration of the salt mines of Bochnia and Wieliczka was noteworthy. In 1251 deposits of halite were discovered in Bochnia; previously, only brine had been found there. Boles\u0142aw V prompted the district to mine the salt, which became a source of regular income. During his reign, Boles\u0142aw took special care of the church, and above all, to the Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w. In 1245, thanks to the efforts of Boles\u0142aw's sister Salomea, a Poor Clare monastery was founded in Zawichost. On 28 August 1252 during a meeting at Ogl\u0119d\u00f3w, the Duke and his mother Grzymis\u0142awa granted an immunity privilege to the Bishopric, which guaranteed to the local clergy greater autonomy in economic and judicial matters. On 17 September 1253, thanks to the joint efforts of Boles\u0142aw and the bishop of Krak\u00f3w, Pope Innocent IV canonized Stanis\u0142aw (Stanislaus) of Szczepan\u00f3w. On 8 May 1254 celebrations were held in Krak\u00f3w to honour Saint Stanislaus, including a meeting of the Piast princes. On 18 June another meeting took place at Chroberz, where Boles\u0142aw confirmed the privileges granted to the Bishopric of Krak\u00f3w at Ogl\u0119d\u00f3w. In 1257 a synod was held in \u0141\u0119czyca, where it was established that any ruler who kidnapped a bishop would be automatically excommunicated, and his domains placed under the interdict. Between 11\u201312 June 1258 a meeting was held at Sandomierz, at which Boles\u0142aw approved further privileges for the Church in Lesser Poland. At the invitation of Boles\u0142aw V and his wife Kinga, the Franciscans came to Krak\u00f3w around 1258. ==Death== A copy of Boles\u0142aw's tombstone at the Little Market Square in Krak\u00f3w . Boles\u0142aw the Chaste died on 7 December 1279.Kalendarz katedry krakowskiej, p. 190 (under 7 December entry): \"Dux Bolezlaus Pudicus filius Lestkonis obiit\". Jan D\u0142ugosz recorded the event as follows: ::He was deeply grieved not only by his own people, but also by the neighboring nations because of the modesty and majesty that he showed. His funeral took place three days later, on 10 December.Rocznik franciszka\u0144ski krakowski, p. 50. He was buried in the Church of St. Francis of Assisi in Krak\u00f3w. There is a gravestone with the inscription: ::Anno Domini MCCLXX obiit ilustrissimus princeps et dnus, Vladislaus dictus pius dux Cracov. Kazimierz Stronczy\u0144skiKazimierz Stronczy\u0144ski: Mniemany grobowiec Boles\u0142awa Wstydliwego w Krakowie, \"Biblioteka Warszawska\" 24, 1849, p. 502. alleged that the gravestone was false, but the fact that contemporary sources established that Boles\u0142aw's body was placed in the church, does not raise any objections.Latopis hipacki, p. 880; Udzia\u0142 Rusi, p. 175, footnote 25. After the death of her husband, Kinga entered the Poor Clares convent in Stary S\u0105cz. By virtue of the previous agreement, Leszek II the Black inherited Krak\u00f3w and Sandomierz. ==Church foundations== In 1263 Boles\u0142aw founded a church dedicated to Mark the Evangelist in Krak\u00f3w (pl: Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 \u015bw. Marka w Krakowie) built in the Gothic style. == Ancestry == ==Notes== ==Bibliography== *Tomasz Biber, Anna Leszczy\u0144ska, Maciej Leszczy\u0144ski: Poczet W\u0142adc\u00f3w Polski.
