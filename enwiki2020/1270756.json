Jalebi, also known as Jilapi, zulbia, mushabak and zalabia, is an Indian and Arabic sweet snack popular all over South Asia and Middle East. It is made by deep-frying maida flour (plain flour or all-purpose flour) batter in pretzel or circular shapes, which are then soaked in sugar syrup. This dessert can be served warm or cold. They have a somewhat chewy texture with a crystallized sugary exterior coating. Citric acid or lime juice is sometimes added to the syrup, as well as rose water. Jalebi is eaten with curd or rabri (North India) along with optional other flavours such as kewra (scented water). This dish is not to be confused with similar sweets and variants like imarti and chhena jalebi. == Names == Names for the dish include South Asia: * (jalebi); * Nepali: \u091c\u0947\u0930\u0940 (jeri); * Marathi: \u091c\u093f\u0932\u092c\u0940 (jilab\u012b); * (jil\u0101pi); * (jelepi); * (jal\u0113b\u012b); * (jil\u0113bi); * (jil\u0113bi); * (jhil\u0101pi); * (jal\u0113b\u012b); * (jil\u0113bi); * (jil\u0113bi); * ; * Sinhala: \u0db4\u0dd0\u0dab\u0dd2 \u0dc0\u0dc5\u0dbd\u0dd4 (p\u00e6\u1e47i va\u1e37alu); * (jalebi); * (jalebi); West Asia * (zulbia); * (\u017a\u0259lob\u0259i); * Central Kurdish: \u0632\u06c6\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u060c \u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u06d5 (zolb\u00eeya, zilab\u00eeye); * Southern Kurdish: \u0632\u0648\u0648\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u060c \u0632\u0648\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0628\u06cc\u0644\u06cc\u0627 (z\u00fblb\u00eeya, z\u00fbl\u00eeb\u00eel\u00eeya); * Lurish: \u0632\u0644\u0647\u06cc\u0628\u06cc (zuleybi); * Azerbaijani: z\u00fclbiy\u0259 * Arabic: \u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0647 (zal\u0101biyeh) or \u0632\u0644\u0628\u064a (zalebi); * Turkish: m\u00fc\u015febbek, z\u00fclbiye North Africa * Somali: \u0645\u064f\u0634\u064e\u0628\u064e\u0643 (mushabbak); * Egyptian Arabic: \u0645\u0650\u0634\u064e\u0628\u064d\u0643 (meshabek); * Tunisian Arabic: \u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0647 (zlebia); * Harari language: \u1219\u123b\u1260\u12bd (mushabakh).

A 10th century cookbook gives several recipes for zulubiya. There are several 13th century recipes of the sweet, the most accepted being mentioned in a cookbook by Muhammad bin Hasan al-Baghdadi. It was also mentioned in a tenth century Arabic cookbook by Ibn Sayyar al-Warraq, that was later translated by Nawal Nasrallah. Ernest A Hamwi, a Syrian immigrant to the United States, is believed to have used the Persian version zalabia as an early ice cream cone. === Modern jalebi === According to Hobson- Jobson, the Indian word jalebi is derived from the Arabic word zulabiya or the Persian zolbiyaHobson-Jobson, s.v. \"JELAUBEE\", another name for luqmat al qadi.This recipe was brought to Medieval India by Persian-speaking Turkic invaders. In 15th century India, jalebi was known as Kundalika or Jalavallika. Priyamkarnrpakatha, a work by the Jain author Jinasura, composed around 1450 CE, mentions jalebi in the context of a dinner held by a rich merchant. Gunyagunabodhini, another Sanskrit work dating before 1600 CE, lists the ingredients and recipe of the dish; these are identical to the ones used to prepare the modern jalebi. The western Asian dish of Zalabia used a different batter and a syrup of honey and rose water, It was in India that the Indian jalebi got its distinct form - crispness, colour and the sticky sweetness. == Distribution == === Indian subcontinent === In the Indian subcontinent, it is known as Jalebi in Hindustani and served with sweetened condensed milk dish, rabri or eaten with kachori and vegetable curry in the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. In Bangladesh, this sweet is called Jilapi in Standard Bengali or Zilafi in some places in eastern Bangladesh such as Sylhet and Chittagong, and it is broadly consumed as an essential iftar item or as a snack. This sweet is called jeri in Nepal, a word derived from Jangiri and the Mughal Emperor Jahangir. Pani Walalu or Undu Walalu is a traditional sweet of Sri Lanka prepared by frying a type of doughnut, made by using undu flour and rice flour and soaking in kithul treacle. In the Maldives, it is known by the name \"zil\u0113bi\". === Middle East and North Africa === ==== Iran ==== It's known as zoolbia (\u0632\u0648\u0644\u0628\u06cc\u0627) in Iran, although when translated into English, the spelling has alternatives and can include zolbiya, zulbi\u0101, zulbia, zolbia, and others. In addition to being sweetened with honey and sugar, zoolbias in Iran is also flavoured with saffron or rose water. Often in Iran, zoolbia is served with Persian-style black tea alongside a similar dessert with a different \"egg\" shape, Bamiyeh. These deserts are commonly served during Nowruz (Persian New Year) and Ramadan month. ==== Middle East and North Africa ==== Zlebia or zlabia is a type of pastry eaten in parts of Northwest Africa, such as Algeria, Tunisia and Libya as well as Morocco. Natural ingredients include flour, yeast, yoghurt, and sugar or honey. This is then mixed with water and commonly two seeds of cardamom (oil for the crackling). These are found in the Levant and other Middle Eastern countries, including the Arab countries of Yemen, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Comoros. Zal\u0101biya or zalabia, zalabiya (\u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629) (Maghrebi Arabic: \u0632\u0644\u0627\u0628\u064a\u0629) are fried dough foods, including types similar to straight doughnuts. Zal\u0101biya are made from a batter composed of eggs, flour and milk, and then cooked in oil. They are made by a zalb\u0101ni. Unlike jalebi, zalabia may have a different shape, more like a free-form doughnut or a ball (but this is depending on the exact region and culture), and it may contain cinnamon, lemon, and powdered sugar. == Variations of the recipe == Zal\u0101biya mushabbaka are latticed fritters made in discs, balls and squares. They are dipped in clarified honey perfumed with rose water, musk and camphor. A recipe from a caliph's kitchen suggests milk, clarified butter, sugar and pepper to be added. Zal\u0101biya funiyya is a \"sponge cake\" version cooked in a special round pot on a trivet and cooked in a tannur.Translated by Nawal Nasrallah Annals of the caliphs' kitchens: Ibn Sayy\u0101r al-Warr\u0101q's tenth- century Baghdadi cookbook Volume 70 of Islamic history and civilization Edition illustrated 2007 . 867 pages BRILL page 413-417 They are often stick shaped.
