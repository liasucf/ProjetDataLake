It is also one of the smallest and most romantic castles. Today it is in private ownership and may not be visited.The castle in Bayern Atlas == History == The hill castle stands at a height of and may have been built around 1486 by Conz of Hirschaid. It was probably originally an allodial estate of the Lords of Hirschaid. Later, feudal sovereignty passed to the Bishopric of Bamberg. In 1525 was destroyed in the Peasants' War. It was immediately rebuilt. In 1607/1608 the Hirschaid family had to sell their barony as they were short of money. On 23 May 1608 Wolf Philipp Gro\u00df von Trockau zu T\u00fcchersfeld was enfeoffed with the castle and lordship. During the Thirty Years' War the castle appears to have been destroyed because in 1636 a modest new structure was built. It was comprehensively renovated between 1707 and 1714. A garden house was probably built at this time, which was converted in 1743 into a castle and village chapel. The Gro\u00df von Trockau family, who called themselves from 1658 zu Kohlstein und T\u00fcchersfeld, had to sell the castle in 1713 to Otto Philipp von Gutenberg. After his death, his niece, Maria Anna Gro\u00df von Trockau, inherited the castle and estate. The current structure, a residential building with attached tower, dates mainly to the 18th century. The tower was renovated in 1890. In 1961 the Gro\u00df von Trockau family sold the castle, but not its associated chapel. The castle has had several owners since then. Today the castle is protected as listed building no.
