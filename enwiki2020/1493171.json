    "text": "Dove is an American personal care brand owned by Unilever originating in the United States. Dove products are manufactured in Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, China, Egypt, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Israel, Ireland, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Pakistan, Philippines, Poland, South Africa, South Korea, Thailand, Turkey and the United States. The products are sold in more than 150 countries and are offered for both women, men, and babies. Dove's logo is a silhouette profile of the brand's namesake bird. Vincent Lamberti was granted the original patents related to the manufacturing of Dove in the 1950s, while he worked for the Lever brothers. == Product lines == Products include: antiperspirants/deodorants, body washes, beauty bars, lotions/moisturizers, hair care, or facial care products. Dove is primarily made from synthetic surfactants, vegetable oils (such as palm kernel) and salts of animal fats (tallow). In some countries, Dove is derived from tallow, and for this reason it is not considered vegan, unlike vegetable oil based soaps. Unilever launched a men's toiletries range in January 2010, branded \"Dove Men + Care\". In November 2013, Steve Bell of Macon, Georgia won the Dove Men+Care Hair \"King of the Castle Home Upgrade\" contest, receiving a home upgrade and consultation with Jonathan Scott of Property Brothers. dove I.jpg|Dove Shampoo & Conditioner File:Dove Cream.jpg|Dove Intensive Cream == Dove Campaign for Real Beauty == In September 2004, Dove began its Campaign for Real Beauty, followed by the creation of the Dove Self-Esteem Fund in 2006, by Geyner Andres Gaona and Amy. The campaign has been criticized as hypocritical in light of the highly sexualized images of women presented in the advertising of Axe, which, like Dove, is produced by Unilever. == Ad controversy == In May 2011, Dove prompted criticism and accusations of racism after publishing an advert for their body wash showing three women with different skin tones side by side in front of a \"before and after\" image of cracked and smooth skin, with a black woman below the \"before\" and a white woman below the \"after\". In October 2017, a three second video for Dove body lotion posted on their page on Facebook in the United States prompted criticism and accusations of racism. The video clip showed a black woman removing her T Shirt to reveal a white woman, who then lifts her own T Shirt to reveal an Asian woman. The full thirty second television advert version included seven women of different races and ages. The ad sparked criticism, leading Dove to remove the advert, saying it \u201cdeeply regret(ted) the offence it caused.\u201d Dove further stated that the \"video was intended to convey that Dove body wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity...\" The black woman in the advert, Lola Ogunyemi, said the advert had been misinterpreted and defended Dove.Nicola Slawson: Dove apologises for ad showing black woman turning into white one The Guardian, 8 October 2017; Maggie Astor: Dove Drops Ad After It Draws Criticism for Being Racist The New York Times; Casey Quackenbush: Dove Apologizes After Body Wash Ad Is Slammed For Being Racist Time Magazine; Jeff Wicks: Dove extends olive branch over 'racist' ad The Times, 9 October 2017; Natasha Bach: Dove Removes 'Racist' Ad That Seemed to Suggest Black Women Were Dirty Fortune; Daniel Politi: Dove Apologizes for Ad That Shows Black Woman Turning Into a White Woman Slate, 8 October 2017; Whitney Kimball: What Was Dove's Thought Process on This Racial Transformation Ad Jezebel, 8 October 2017; Biba Kang: Dove\u2019s apology for its Facebook advert is insulting to people of colour \u2013 \u2018sorry you\u2019re offended\u2019 really isn\u2019t enough.
