    "text": "James Woo (Woo Yen Jet) is a fictional secret agent appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by EC Comics writer Al Feldstein and artist Joe Maneely, the Chinese-American character first appeared in Yellow Claw #1 (October 1956) from Atlas Comics, the 1950s predecessor of Marvel. Woo has since appeared occasionally in a variety of Marvel publications. The character is played by Randall Park in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In Ant-Man and the Wasp (2018), he is an FBI agent and Scott Lang\u2019s parole officer, a role he is slated to reprise in the Disney+ series WandaVision (2020). ==Publication history== Jimmy Woo was the hero of the espionage series Yellow Claw, named for his antagonist, a \"yellow peril\" Communist mandarin. While the short-lived series named after that villain ran only four issues (October 1956 \u2013 April 1957), it featured art by Maneely, Jack Kirby, and John Severin. Kirby took over as writer-artist with issue #2\u2014inking his own pencil art there and in the following issue, representing two of the very rare occasions on which he did so. On the final issue, the inking was done by Western- and war-comics veteran Severin. Also, other artists drew the covers: Severin on #2 and #4, Bill Everett on #3. Well regarded for its relatively mature storyline and in particular for Maneely's exquisitely atmospheric art, the book nevertheless failed to find an audience. Woo and other characters from the series were brought into the Marvel universe a decade later, beginning with the \"S.H.I.E.L.D.\" story in Strange Tales #160 (Sept. 1967). Woo joins that espionage agency in Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. #2 (July 1968). Woo went on to be featured in the 1977\u20131979 Marvel series Godzilla and the 2006\u201307 Marvel series Agents of Atlas. Before the cancellation of the 1990s alternate universe Marvel imprint Razorline, as produced but unpublished titles of its various series were preparing to blend the Razorline into primary Marvel continuity, Woo as well as Nick Fury and other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents guest-starred in Wraitheart #5.
