    "text": "Lapuz is one of the seven districts of Iloilo City, in the Philippine province of Iloilo, on the island of Panay, in the Western Visayas. ==History== Port of Iloilo Lapuz was a part of the La Paz district ever since the latter was a town during the Spanish regime. It is common knowledge among the Ilonggos that the name \"Lapuz\" came from the Hiligaynon word, \"lapus\" which means \"to insert/pass through\" because of its location. After several years of being a part of La Paz, Lapuz finally gained its independence and district status on December 17, 2008 after the Sangguniang Panglungsod (City Council) of Iloilo City passed a resolution for the district to have its own police station and fire station.http://www.thenewstoday.info/2008/12/22/city.to.recognize.lapuz.as.separate.district.from.la.paz.html The two-time champion of the Dinagyang Festival, Tribu Ilonganon of Jalandoni Memorial National High School, hails from Lapuz. ==See also== *Dinagyang Festival *Iloilo City ==References== == External links == * Iloilo City Government Official Website Category:Districts of Iloilo City ",
