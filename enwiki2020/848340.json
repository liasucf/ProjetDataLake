    "text": "Cleveleys is a town on the Fylde Coast of Lancashire, England, about north of Blackpool and south of Fleetwood. It is part of the Borough of Wyre. With its neighbouring settlement of Thornton, Cleveleys was part of the former urban district of Thornton-Cleveleys and is part of the Blackpool Urban Area. ==History== At the start of the Second World War, several departments of the Ministry of Pensions, the Ministry of Education and the Board of Trade were moved to the Cleveleys area. Some were housed in the Rossall School briefly. An extensive site was developed for the Ministry of Pensions in the Norcross section of Carleton and all the government departments moved out in 1940. On 1 February 2008, the MS Riverdance ferry, while undertaking a regular sailing from Northern Ireland to Heysham under severe stormy conditions, ran aground on the beach, close to the boundary with Blackpool. ==Transport== Cleveleys is served by Blackpool Transport, who operate to Blackpool town centre, Mereside, Lytham, Bispham and Fleetwood, by Stagecoach North West, Cumfybus and Classic Bus Northwest, via the bus station. Cleveleys is on the Blackpool Tramway. The tramway runs from Starr Gate in Blackpool to Fleetwood via Bispham and Cleveleys. There are five tram stops in the area, between the stops of Rossall School (Southern Fleetwood) and Little Bispham (Northern edge of Blackpool). The nearest railway station to Cleveleys is in Poulton-le-Fylde, away. ==References== Category:Towns in Lancashire Category:Geography of the Borough of Wyre Category:The Fylde Category:Seaside resorts in Lancashire Category:Beaches of Lancashire ",
