    "text": "Katherine Hilliker (born Katharine Clark, and sometimes referred to as Kitty Prosser) was an American screenwriter and film editor known for her work on films like Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans. She was married to fellow writer- editor Harry H. Caldwell, with whom she often collaborated. == Biography == Katherine was born in Tacoma, Washington. Her father died when she was young, and she was raised by her stepfather (hence her sometimes being referred to as Katherine Prosser). She attended high school in Savannah, Georgia, before moving to San Francisco to begin a career as a journalist. While working at The Oakland Call, she met her first husband, Douglas \"Bill\" Hilliker. Hilliker was a graphic designer who was working in the fledgling motion picture industry, and after the pair married, she took an interest in the medium as well. She went to work as film critic at The New York Morning Telegraph before leaving journalism behind to work as an editor at Universal. She then moved on to work as David O. Selznick publicity chief Vivian Moses's assistant, writing publicity copy on the studio's releases. By 1916, she was writing and editing films at Select; she later worked at C.L. Chester Pictures Corporation, where she helped put together documentary-style travel shorts. While working at Chester, she met the man who would become her second husband, H.H. Caldwell. She and Clark would work on English titles for foreign releases at Samuel Goldwyn's studio. They later worked on titles at Fox (most notably on Sunrise), though their career in Hollywood came to an end with the advent of talkies. == Selected filmography == As writer: *City Girl (1930) *Christina (1929) *Black Magic (1929) *Eternal Love (1929) *The Rescue (1929) *The Awakening (1928) *No Other Woman (1928) *Four Sons (1928) *The Gateway of the Moon (1928) *Mother Machree (1927) *Sunrise (1927) *The Loves of Carmen (1927) *7th Heaven (1927) *The Country Beyond (1926) *The Boob (1926) *The Devil's Circus (1926) * Torrent (1926) *Ben-Hur (1925) *The Masked Bride (1925) *The Prairie Wife (1925) *Welcome Stranger (1924) *The Right of the Strongest (1924) *Lost and Found on a South Sea Island (1923) *The Cave Girl (1921) *Love's Penalty (1921) *What Women Love (1920) *Some More Samoa (1920) *Cynthia of the Minute (1920) *Some Speed to Surago (1920) *Cameraing Through Africa (1919) As editor: *City Girl (1930) *Christina (1929) *Lucky Star (1929) *Black Magic (1929) *The Rescue (1929) *The Awakening (1928) *Mother Machree (1927) *The Loves of Carmen (1927) *The Prairie Wife (1925) *Lost and Found on a South Sea Island (1923) *Love's Penalty (1921) == References == ==External links== * Category:1885 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Women film editors Category:American film editors Category:American women screenwriters Category:Writers from Tacoma, Washington Category:Women film pioneers Category:Screenwriters from Washington (state) Category:20th-century American women writers Category:20th-century American screenwriters ",
