He then trained to be a priest at St Patrick's College, Maynooth. While there, he became one of the earliest seminarians to receive permission to play football and played for Mayo in the final of the 1967 All-Ireland Under-21 Football Championship. He had previously played at Croke Park in three minor campaigns for the county, in 1962 (finalist, aged 16), 1963 (semi-finalist), and 1964 (semi-finalist again).

Mayo then finished as league runner-up to Kerry in 1971 and 1972. He had less than four years of playing at the elite level due to injuries. His final match as a Mayo player was against Roscommon in the 1972 Connacht Senior Football Championship. With his club Ballyhaunis, Cribbin played in the same team as his brothers Tom Short and Tony (Toto). In retirement from playing, Cribbin coached underage teams including Breaffy National School. Cribbin was ordained in 1970. He began working as Prefect of Studies at St Jarlath's College.
