Grace in 1913) before turning professional.Some sources state he was amateur champion at featherweight. He made his professional d\u00e9but on 12 November 1917 against Ben Callicott at the National Sporting Club, taking a 15-round points decision. In February 1919 he beat Ted Moore, with Moore disqualified in the sixth round for holding. In April 1919 he fought Raymond Vittet for the vacant European lightweight title, winning after Vittet was disqualified in the third round. Two months later he beat Johnny Summers to take the British lightweight title vacated by Freddie Welsh, again via the disqualification of his opponent, Summers adjudged to have been holding.\"Johnny Summers's Bad Break\", NZ Truth, 13 September 1919, p. 8. Retrieved 28 March 2015 Marriott was due to defend his British title against Llew Edwards in May 1920 but declined the fight and reportedly returned his Lonsdale Belt to the National Sporting Club. He defended his European title in May 1920, losing to Georges Papin on points in Paris, the fight having been postponed from January due to a leg injury to Marriott.
