Nevertheless, the following season Jorquera was loaned to \u00d1ublense, freshly promoted to top-tier. After a season on loan at \u00d1ublense and Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola, he returned to Colo-Colo in 2008 and with Borghi still in the bench, Jorquera settled as starter player. On 20 March 2008, he scored his first competitive goal for the club in a 2\u20130 home win over Boca Juniors for the Copa Libertadores. After being eclipsed with Macnelly Torres arrival and Borghi's departure, Jorquera wasn't considered by Marcelo Barticciotto and was loaned to O'Higgins F.C. for gain experience. Following a regular season with O'Higgins, he returned to Colo-Colo as back-up of Macnelly Torres. Nevertheless, he ended up winning the post to Torres with Diego Cagna as coach. For the 2011 season and the definitive departure of Macnelly from the club, Jorquera was an undisputed player in the Apertura and in the Copa Libertadores. On 31 August 2011, Jorquera joined Serie A side Genoa in four-year contract, after being sold in \u20ac2,6 million during May of the same year. For the 2013\u201314 season, he was loaned to Turkey\u2019s Eski\u015fehirspor, completing 4 goals in 22 appearances. After ending his spell at Turkey as well as his contract with Genoa, Jorquera joined Parma F.C. to face the 2014-15 league season. However, he only managed to score a goal in 17 appearances because in December 2014 he injured in his left foot, so that he missed the rest of the tournament. Following Parma's bankruptcy (and a successor club re-founded in Serie D), on 18 July 2015, it was confirmed that Jorquera joined Bursaspor, thereby returning to Turkey. ==International career== He has earned four caps for Chile. ==Honours== ===Club=== ;Colo-Colo * Primera Divisi\u00f3n de Chile (2): 2006 Apertura, 2006 Clausura * Copa Sudamericana: Runner-up 2006 ==Career statistics== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !colspan=\"2\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals !Apps !Goals |- |rowspan=\"5\"|Colo-Colo |2006 |10||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||2||0||12||0 |- |2008 |30||4||0||0||4||1||34||5 |- |2010 |18||6||0||0||2||0||20||6 |- |2011 |17||4||0||0||5||2||22||6 |- !Total !74!!14!!0!!0!!13!!3!!87!!17 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|\u00d1ublense (loan) |2007 |14||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||1 |- !Total !14!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!14!!1 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola (loan) |2007 |15||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||15||0 |- !Total !15!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!15!!0 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|O'Higgins (loan) |2009 |30||3||1||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||31||3 |- !Total !30!!3!!1!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!31!!3 |- |rowspan=\"3\"|Genoa |2011\u201312 |22||4||2||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||24||5 |- |2012\u201313 |13||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||13||0 |- !Total !35!!4!!2!!1!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!37!!5 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Eski\u015fehirspor (loan) |2013\u201314 |22||4||9 |2|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||31||6 |- !Total !22!!4!!9 !2!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!!31!!6 |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Parma |2014\u201315 |17||1||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||17||1 |- !Total !17!!1!!0!!0!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!17!!0 |- | rowspan=\"4\" |Bursaspor |2015\u201316 |22||2||5 |3|| colspan=\"2\" |\u2014||27||5 |- |2016\u201317 |30 |6 |5 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |35 |7 |- |2017\u201318 |12 |0 |2 |1 | colspan=\"2\" |\u2014 |14 |1 |- !Total !64!!8!!12 !5!! colspan=\"2\" |\u2014!!76!!13 |- ! colspan=\"2\" |Total !271!!35!!24!!8!!13!!3!!308!!46 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1988 births Category:Living people Category:Chilean footballers Category:Chile international footballers Category:Colo-Colo footballers Category:Uni\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola footballers Category:O'Higgins F.C. footballers Category:\u00d1ublense footballers Category:Chilean Primera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Chilean expatriate footballers Category:Chilean expatriate sportspeople in Italy Category:Genoa C.F.C. players Category:Eski\u015fehirspor footballers Category:Parma Calcio 1913 players Category:Bursaspor footballers Category:Club Deportivo Palestino footballers Category:Serie A players Category:S\u00fcper Lig players Category:Expatriate footballers in Italy Category:Expatriate footballers in Turkey Category:Chilean expatriate sportspeople in Turkey Category:Association football midfielders ",
