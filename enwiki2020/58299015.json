Her doctoral thesis, defended in 1987 and published by Rodopi in 1998, consists of a description of the Spanish fascist aesthetic system and the analysis of its progressive dissolution in postwar literary criticism. Specializing in literary theory, she has written books such as Introducci\u00f3n a la historia de las teor\u00edas literarias (1991) and Teor\u00eda de la literatura y de la interpretaci\u00f3n literaria (2008). In 1995 she began a line of research on the theater of Garc\u00eda Lorca, a subject on which she continues to work today. In 1995 her book Lenguaje y literatura was released, in which she talks with the main representatives of the linguistic turn and hermeneutic skepticism. In 2000 she presented her hypothesis on the innocence of Josef K. in The Trial, which she developed extensively in the book Kafka y la tragedia jud\u00eda (2003). The hermeneutic discussion contained in this book is continued in more recent publications such as El problema de la interpretaci\u00f3n literaria. Fuentes y bases te\u00f3ricas para una hermen\u00e9utica constructiva (2009) and Perspectivas actuales de hermen\u00e9utica literaria. Para otra \u00e9tica de la interpretaci\u00f3n (2014). In 1992 Wahn\u00f3n entered the field of Cultural and Jewish Studies with a work on the Hebrew poetics of Moses ibn Ezra, and another on the role of the Wandering Jew in One Hundred Years of Solitude.

Her most recent work in this line, from 2010, deals with the images of the Holocaust in post-war Spanish poetry. In this same period she participated in debates on anti-Zionism and antisemitism. From 2006 to 2007 she contributed to the national newspaper ABC with a series of articles on the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. In recent years she has continued to develop this critical activity in some articles on the current university model. In 2014 she published En fuga irrevocable. Un ensayo de cr\u00edtica de la cultura, which deals with textual proliferation in the cultural and university spheres. She has dedicated several articles and reviews to contemporary poets and narrators, including Iris M. Zavala, Luis Garc\u00eda Montero, Jos\u00e9 Guti\u00e9rrez, , , Gregorio Morales, Francisco D\u00edaz de Castro, Rosa Reg\u00e0s, and . ==Professional career== In 1977 Wahn\u00f3n began her studies in Hispanic Philology at the University of Granada, where she has developed most of her professional and teaching activities.
