Britain wants to retrieve that gold to help the economy and Jacky is promised a percentage of that gold and a possible pardon from the King, despite her crimes of piracy. Jacky and Jamie are given separate ships: the Dolphin and the Nancy B. Alsop. The Dolphin is commandeered by Captain Hannibal Hudson, while Jacky captains the Nancy B. Jaimy and Lieutenant Flashby are stationed on the Dolphin. Jacky is assigned to sail to the Florida Keys to the locationof the Santa Magdalena.

Jacky and Jaimy enjoy time together but must depart for a couple of weeks. While docked in Charleston, Jacky, Davy, and Tink, visit a couple of taverns where Jacky performs songs on the pennywhistle and violin. The next day, Jacky and the group run into a slave auction. Jacky is deeply angered by this kind of trade, but bids for an old slave woman named Jemimah and brings her aboard her ship. Jemimah is taken in as the ship's cook. When they get to the Keys, Jacky starts swimming immediately; her first dive is a dangerous one as she has a run-in with a moray eel. Despite Dr. Sebastian's interest in the creature, Jacky decapitates the eel. While sailing around a nearby island, Jacky prepares to dive and find the Santa Magdalena. Spurred on by Dr. Sebastian, Jacky dives into the water and finds the sunken ship. Unfortunately, a Spanish man-of-war called the San Cristobal comes across the Nancy B. and board it. The officer in charge demands who the fleet is and what's their purpose in Spanish waters. Unconvinced, the men scrounge the Nancy B., although they find no evidence to prove the crew are fakes. After Jacky emerges from the water and offends the officer in charge, the Spanish and the Nancy B. sail separately for Havana.
