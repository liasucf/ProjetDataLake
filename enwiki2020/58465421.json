The company is currently working on several games, as well as an anime in collaboration with Pierrot. ==History== alt=A 2016 photograph of Kotaro Uchikoshi. Kazutaka Kodaka, the writer of Spike Chunsoft's Danganronpa franchise, started thinking about how he wanted to create his own development company where he could do new things, following the completion of the anime television series Danganronpa 3 (2016) and the video game Danganronpa V3 (2017). He discussed it with the Danganronpa character designer and composer, Rui Komatsuzaki and Masafumi Takada, who also were interested in the idea; Takada founded the company in 2017, as he had already been involved in the launch of other companies. Kodaka also invited other people to join the company, including Kotaro Uchikoshi, the director and scenario writer for Spike Chunsoft's Zero Escape series; the Danganronpa illustrator Shimadoriru; Takumi Nakazawa, the director and co-writer of KID's Infinity series; and the Danganronpa novelist Yoichirou Koizumi. Kodaka, Takada, Komatsuzaki and Uchikoshi are the core members of the company, and Kodaka is its representative. The company's name is a wordplay on Tokyo \u2013 where they are based \u2013 and the Japanese word , thus meaning \"Too Crazy Games\". The company was announced to the public in September 2018, announcing that four projects were under development. They were later revealed to be Death Come True, World's End Club, and Tribe Nine, alongside an anime called Akudama Drive. The goal of the company, according to Kodaka, is to create new intellectual properties, and for the staff to also create their own indie game projects; he also mentioned that he would still like to go back to the Danganronpa franchise at some point in the future. ==Works== ===Video games=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" !
