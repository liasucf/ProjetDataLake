    "text": "Bloodsport is the third and final studio album by English electronic band Sneaker Pimps. It was released on 22 January 2002, through record label Tommy Boy. Despite a positive fan reception, it received a mediocre response from music critics at the time of its release, and was commercially unsuccessful, failing to chart in the band's home country of the UK. == Content == The album opener \"Kiro TV\" is named after the US television station KIRO-TV. The title of \"Loretta Young Silks\" refers to the US actress Loretta Young. === Musical style === Described as trip hop, the album had the label \"goth\" affixed to it by more than one reviewer. == Release == Bloodsport was released on 22 January 2002 on CD as well as double red vinyl, through record label Tommy Boy. It failed to chart in the band's home country of the UK, but reached number 68 in the Austrian top 75 album chart. Lead single \"Sick\" charted at 100 on the UK Singles Chart. Several Bloodsport-era songs which weren't included on the album were released elsewhere: \"Miami Counting\" appears as a B-side for the \"Loretta Young Silks\" single; the \"Sick\" single and the Japanese edition of Bloodsport contain a track called \"After Every Party I Die\", which was later re-recorded by Chris Corner's side project IAMX and released on the album The Alternative; \"O-Type\" was included as a B-side on the 12-inch vinyl single of \"Bloodsport\". An alternative version of this track has circulated online. == Reception == Despite garnering a positive response from listeners and fans on Metacritic, Bloodsport was given a generally negative reception from music critics at the time of its release. This was perhaps epitomised in Drowned in Sound's review: \"How do you criticise one of your favourite bands ever? [...] this is classic Sneaker Pimps, which is my main gripe about this album, its too classic Sneaker Pimps. All of the songs seem to be rehashes of previous releases. To put it bluntly this band should have and could have progressed. \" ==Track listing== ==Samples== * 'Kiro TV' sampled Ultravox's track: 'ROckWrok' (1977) * 'Small Town Witch' sampled Iggy Pop's track: 'Nightclubbing' (1977) * 'Loretta Young Silks' sampled Bill Withers' track: 'I Wish You Well' (1975) and Ippu-Do's track: 'Chinese Reggae' (1980) * 'The Fuel' sampled James Horner's tracks: 'Following Kirwell' and 'Irina's Chase' from the film 'Gorky Park' (1983) * 'Bloodsport' sampled Visage's track: 'Tar' (1979) * 'Blue Movie' sampled The Keynotes' track: 'Canaan's Land' (1973) * The unreleased 'Bloodsport' session track 'Polaroids' sampled Gary Numan's track: 'Metal' (1979) * 'O-Type', the b-side to 'Bloodsport' sampled both The Human League's track: 'Love Action' (1981) and Bauhaus' track: 'Three Shadows (Part Three)' (1982) ==Bloodsport on Sneaker Pimps Legacy== More information can be found on ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2002 albums Category:Sneaker Pimps albums Category:Albums produced by Jim Abbiss ",
