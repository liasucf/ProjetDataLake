    "text": "The AP Stylebook, also known by its full name The Associated Press Stylebook and Briefing on Media Law, is an English grammar style and usage guide created by American journalists working for or connected with the Associated Press. Although it is sold as a guide for reporters, it has become the leading reference for most forms of public-facing corporate communication over the last half-century. The Stylebook offers a basic reference to grammar, punctuation and principles of reporting, including many definitions and rules for usage as well as styles for capitalization, abbreviation, spelling and numerals. The first publicly available edition of the book was published in 1953. The first modern edition was published in August 1977 by Lorenz Press. Afterwards, various paperback editions were published by different publishers including, among others, Turtleback Books, Penguin's Laurel Press, Pearson's Addison-Wesley, and Hachette's Perseus Books and Basic Books. Since 1985 the AP Stylebook has been updated annually, usually in May. Modern editions are released in several formats, including paperback and flat-lying spiral-bound editions, as well as a digital e-book edition and an online subscription version. Additionally, today the AP Stylebook also provides English grammar recommendation through its presence on social media, including Twitter, Facebook, and Pinterest. From 1977 to 2005 more than two million copies of the AP Stylebook have been sold worldwide, with that number climbing to 2.5 million by 2011.The AP Stylebook as journalistic tool and sociolingustic resource // Androutsopoulos, Jannis (2014).

For instance, it includes explanations of five different chapters of bankruptcy. ;Sports Guidelines and Style Includes terminology, statistics, organization rules and guidelines commonly referenced by sports reporters, such as the correct way to spell and use basketball terminology like half-court pass, field goal and goal-tending. ;Guide to Punctuation A specific guide on how to use punctuation in journalistic materials. This section includes rules regarding hyphens, commas, parentheses and quotations. ;Briefing on Media Law An overview of legal issues and ethical expectations for those working in journalism, including the difference between slander and libel.

The first internal AP \"guide\" did not deal with English words and grammar and was more of a brochure with 24 pages of various titles and corporate structures of the Associated Press organization. It was published in 1900 under the title \"The Associated Press\". The first real stylebook-like guide dealing, to a significant extent, with English words and grammar was released in 1909, under the title: \"The Associate Press Rules Regulations and General Orders\".AP Stylebooks through the ages. cjr.org, 2018Style guide superjam. aceseditors.org, 2018The Associate Press Rules Regulations and General Orders (1909). AP Editors, 1909 By the early 1950s the publication was formalized into the AP Stylebook and became the leading professional English grammar reference by most member and non-member news bureaus throughout the world. Due to growing demand by non-member journalists and writers working in public-facing corporate communications, the AP published their first official \"stylebook\" for the general public in 1953 under the title Associated Press Style Book; the first publication focused on \"where the wire set a specific style\".AP Stylebook marks 60th anniversary with new print edition. ap.org, May 2013The history of AP \u2018s guidance on language. cjr.org, 2018abridged version: ; full version: Norm Goldstein. Common Sense Journalism blog, 2007 For nearly a quarter century it assumed its reader had a \"solid grounding in language and a good reference library\" and thus omitted any guidelines in those broader areas. In 1977, prompted by AP Executive News Editor Lou Boccardi's request for \"more of a reference work\", the organization started expanding the book and in 1977 produced a book that was different in a few fundamental regards. Firstly, The structure was changed and entries were organized in alphabetical order so that users could find what they need in a timely manner.AP Style // Heath, Robert L. (2013).

In 1982, Eileen Alt Powell, a co-editor of AP Stylebook 1980 edition, stated that: In 1989, Norm Goldstein became the AP Stylebook lead editor, a job he held until the 2007 edition. After publishing the final edition under his editorship, Goldstein commented on the future of the AP Stylebooks section on name references: After Norm Goldstein stepped down as lead editor in 2007, in bibliographical records for all subsequent editions starting from 2008 lead editors' names are usually not explicitly called out and the author is simply referred to as Associated Press or AP Editors.
