    "text": "The Battle of Yongin (\uc6a9\uc778 \uc804\ud22c) was a battle that happened during the Japanese invasions of Korea. The battle was fought from June 5-6, 1592 (Gregorian July 13-14, 1592). Yi Gwang's force of 80,000-130,000 lost to the numerically inferior Japanese garrison of 1,600-1,900. Turnbull, Stephen: Samurai Invasion. Japan's Korean War 1592\u201398 (London, 2002), Cassell & Co , p. 72 == Background == In 1592, Toyotomi Hideyoshi invaded Korea, intending to use it as a route to send his armies to conquer Ming China. His forces achieved early success against the Korean army, capturing Seoul. Attempting to reach Seoul as fast as possible, the Japanese forces bypassed Jeolla Province. The governor of Jeolla, Yi Gwang, decided to lead his forces against the Japanese in a counterattack. Turnbull, Stephen: Samurai Invasion. Japan's Korean War 1592\u201398 (London, 2002), Cassell & Co , p. 116 Yongin was a Japanese communication fortress, near Suwon. It was held by the daimyo Wakisaka Yasuharu. Yi Gwang led a force of 80,000-130,000 men against it. == Course of battle == Against Kwon Yul's warnings and advice, Yi Kwang launched an attack without making a reconnaissance. One group of the Korean army took up positions on a hill, while the other attacked the fortress itself. Wakisaka's forces counterattacked, and destroyed the Korean army through an ambush. Turnbull, Stephen: Samurai Invasion. Japan's Korean War 1592\u201398 (London, 2002), Cassell & Co , p. 72 == Result == Many of the Korean officers were captured by the Japanese in the battle. Nevertheless, Gwon Yul and Hwang Jin retreated in good order and were able to gather surviving scattered troops for the victory at the Battle of Ichi. Thus, Jeolla remained outside Japanese control for the rest of the first Japanese invasion of Korea. On the other hand, the defeat of Yongin (along with the defeat at the Imjin River) convinced King Seonjo to abandon Pyeongyang and evacuate to Uiju. Although the Korean troops would eventually retake Seoul after winning a decisive victory at Hangju in 1593, the Koreans would never field an army of 80,000~100,000 at one point for the remaining of the war. ==References== Category:Battles of the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592\u20131598) Category:1592 in Asia Category:1592 in Japan Category:Conflicts in 1592 ",
