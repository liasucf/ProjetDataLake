The Pieve di San Frediano ==History and Description== Documents from 768, note a church dedicated to St Martin at this locale, but by 812, they mention a church dedicated to San Frediano. In these early centuries, it was prominent, being the mother church to Sant'Andrea di Tempagnano, San Lorenzo di Picciorana, San Michele di Antraccoli and San Quirico di Capannori. The church was originally on the pilgrimage route to Rome, Via Francigena, and the town of Lunata had a pilgrims hostel. Little remains of the original structure. The bell-tower was built in the 12th and 13th centuries with pietra serena at the base, and brick superiorly. The windows have mullions and the top has ghibelline merlons.
