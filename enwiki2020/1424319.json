Ministerial candidates in this series of byelections were all confirmed by acclamation (so there were no actual polling dates). These byelections were: * Esquimalt - Alexander Rocke Robertson, acclaimed November 28, 1871 * New Westminster City - Henry Holbrook acclaimed November 28, 1871 * Cariboo - George Anthony Boomer Walkem acclaimed February 23, 1872 * Comox - John Ash acclaimed, January 11, 1873 * Victoria City - Robert Beaven acclaimed January 6, 1873 * New Westminster - William James Armstrong acclaimed March 21, 1873 Other byelections were also held due to deaths and other appointments; all were contested: * Cariboo - John George Barnston was elected to replace Cornelius Booth who was appointed to be Clerk of the Bench (provincial court) for the district of Kootenay on April 19, 1872 * Lillooet - William Saul was elected December 21, 1872 to replace Andrew Thomas Jamieson, who had died on October 31, 1872 *Victoria - November 26, 1874. The byelection was due to resignations February 9, 1874 of A. Bunster and Amor De Cosmos upon winning seats in the federal election January 22, 1874 (in Vancouver and Victoria federal ridings, respectively). William Archibald Robertson and William Fraser Tolmie won the vacant seats. * Lillooet - November 17, 1874. On September 26, 1874, MLAs William Saul and Thomas Basil Humphreys jointly resigned \"over a dispute between the two gentlemen as to which represents the popular feeling of the district\" (Victoria Colonist September 29, 1874). Humphreys was re-elected and William M. Brown was elected to replace William Saul in a tight three-way race. ==Composition of House at dissolution== Note: Government/Opposition status applies to candidate at time of election in 1871, not at time of dissolution in 1875. |- || |align=\"center\"|John George Barnston |align=\"center\" rowspan=3 |Cariboo || || |align=\"center\" |Comox |align=\"center\"|John Ash || |- || |align=\"center\"|Joseph Hunter || || |align=\"center\" rowspan=2|Cowichan |align=\"center\"|John Paton Booth || |- || |align=\"center\"|George Anthony Boomer Walkem || || |align=\"center\"|William Smithe || |- || |align=\"center\"|Henry Cogan |align=\"center\" rowspan=2 |Esquimalt || || |align=\"center\" rowspan=2 |Kootenay |align=\"center\"|John Andrew Mara || |- || |align=\"center\"|Alexander Rocke Robertson || || |align=\"center\"|Charles Todd || |- || |align=\"center\"|Thomas Basil Humphreys |align=\"center\" rowspan=2 |Lillooet || || |align=\"center\" |Nanaimo |align=\"center\"|John Robson || |- || |align=\"center\"|William M.
