    "text": "The 2018 New Mexico gubernatorial election took place on November 6, 2018, to elect the next Governor of New Mexico, concurrently with the election of New Mexico's Class I U.S. Senate seat, as well as other elections to the United States Senate in other states, elections to the United States House of Representatives and various local elections. Incumbent Republican Governor Susana Martinez was term-limited and could not seek reelection to a third consecutive term. Former U.S. Representative Steve Pearce was the Republican nominee and U.S. Representative Michelle Lujan Grisham was the Democratic nominee. Lujan Grisham won the election by a substantial margin, which in fact was a complete reversal of the 2014 gubernatorial results. Her win also signaled a continuation of the pattern of the partisanship of the office changing every two terms, the pattern established with Gary Johnson's first election in 1994. Furthermore, the pattern of the partisanship changing with each officeholder was continued, a pattern first started after Toney Anaya left office in 1987. ==Background== At the presidential level, New Mexico has begun to trend into a Democratic-leaning swing state. It has gone Democratic in all but one presidential election since 1992. The only break in this trend came in 2004, when George W. Bush won it by less than a point. However, in 2008, Barack Obama won the state over John McCain by 15 points and in 2012 by 10 points over Mitt Romney. In 2016, Democrat Hillary Clinton defeated Republican Donald Trump by eight points. However, in 2010, then-District Attorney of New Mexico's Third Judicial District Susana Martinez won the election, becoming the first US Latina Governor, over Lieutenant Governor Diane Denish, former running mate of two-term Democrat Bill Richardson, by approximately seven points. In 2014, Martinez was re-elected over state Attorney General Gary King by nearly 15 points. It has been described as one of the Democrats' best chances at a pickup, due to Gov. Martinez's unpopularity and because \"she's leaving behind a high unemployment rate and struggling education system.\" Phillips, Amber, \"The top 10 gubernatorial races of 2018, \"The Washington Post\", January 6, 2018 The 2018 primary election results show 116,311 votes for Democratic candidate Michelle Lujan Grisham and a total of 175,182 for all three Democratic candidates while Republican candidate/nominee Steve Pearce received 74,705; note that 23% of New Mexico's registered voters are third party or independents (280,000), who do not vote in the primary election. ==Republican primary== ===Governor=== ====Candidates==== =====Nominated===== * Steve Pearce, U.S. Representative, candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2000 and nominee for the U.S. Senate in 2008 =====Declined===== * Aubrey Dunn, Jr., New Mexico Commissioner of Public Lands and candidate for NM-02 in 2008 * John Sanchez, Lieutenant Governor and nominee for Governor of New Mexico in 2002 ==== Results ==== ===Lieutenant Governor=== ====Candidates==== =====Declared===== * Michelle Garcia Holmes, former chief of staff to Attorney General Gary King, former police detective and candidate for Mayor of Albuquerque in 2017 =====Withdrew===== * Kelly Zunie, former secretary of the New Mexico Indian Affairs Department =====Declined===== * Ted Barela, former state senator * Mark Moores, state senator * Cliff Pirtle, state senator ==== Results ==== ==Democratic primary== ===Governor=== ====Candidates==== =====Nominated===== * Michelle Lujan Grisham, U.S. Representative ====Eliminated in primary==== * Jeff Apodaca, businessman and son of former governor Jerry Apodaca * Joe Cervantes, state senator =====Declined===== * Hector Balderas, Attorney General (running for re-election) * Javier Gonzales, former Mayor of Santa Fe (running for lieutenant governor) * Martin Heinrich, U.S. Senator (running for reelection) * Tim Keller, Mayor of Albuquerque and former State Auditor * Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, U.S. Representative * Tom Udall, U.S. Senator * Alan Webber, Mayor of Santa Fe and candidate for Governor in 2014 ====Endorsements==== ====Polling==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\" |- valign=bottom !
