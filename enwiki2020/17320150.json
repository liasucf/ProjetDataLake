Garden city Tapiola was based on town planning of Meurman. Meurman resigned the Tapiola project when high houses were allowed in the area. Internationally garden cities do not include them. He wrote: Rock can be broken in short time, but you can not get it back artificially. Nature must be respected, and should be touched cautiously. By this way nature and humans can create brilliant work, that prove good national sense and civilized nature. ( \"Kallio on lyhyess\u00e4 ajassa rikki r\u00e4j\u00e4ytetty, mutta uutta ei sen tilalle voi keinotekoisesti saada. Luontoa on kunnioitettava, ja siihen on kajottava varovasti. Silloin luonto ja ihminen voivat loihtia suurenmoisia t\u00f6it\u00e4, jotka todistavat tekij\u00e4ns\u00e4 ja kansakunnan hyv\u00e4\u00e4 aistia ja korkeaa sivistystasoa.\") O.-I. Meurman Asemakaavaoppi Meurman's concept of the nuclear family and its necessary place in society was prevalent in his career. ==References== Category:1890 births Category:1994 deaths Category:People from Ilmajoki Category:People from Vaasa Province (Grand Duchy of Finland) Category:Finnish architects ",
