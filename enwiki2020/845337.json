Miller, BBC Pronouncing Dictionary of British Names (London: Oxford University Press, 1971), p. 130. ) is a village and community in the west of the city of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is home to the St Fagans National History Museum. ==History== The name of the area invokes Saint Fagan, according to William of Malmesbury a 2nd-century missionary to Wales but for whom there is no reliable historical evidence. In 1648, the Battle of St Fagans took place close by. ==Description== To the south lies the village of Michaelston-super-Ely, and to the east the suburb of Fairwater. The community includes Rhydlafar to the north. St Fagans lies on the River Ely, and previously had a railway station on the South Wales Main Line, and currently there is a level crossing. {| border=1 cellpadding=3 cellspacing=0 align=center style=\"text-align:center;\" |- |Creigiau |Pentyrch |Radyr |- |St Georges super Ely |St Fagans |Fairwater |- | |Michaelston super Ely |Ely |} The village is home to St Fagans National History Museum (formerly called the Welsh Folk Museum and the Museum of Welsh Life) which includes St Fagans Castle and gardens. St Mary's Church in the village dates from the 12th century, with an 18th century tower. St Fagans Old Rectory is another important Grade II* listed building nearby. St Fagans is home to St Fagans Cricket Club. In 2017 construction started on a new Cardiff suburb of 7,000 houses, named Plasdwr, on countryside between St Fagans, Fairwater and Radyr. ==Local government== St Fagans elects a community council of up to nine community councillors. The council is funded by a precept on local council tax bills and supports a number of local facilities and services. Elections are held every five years. ===2017 Community Council Election=== Six candidates stood for nine seats during the 2017 Cardiff Council election. All candidates were therefore elected unopposed, with three other seats filled through councillors being co-opted by members of the community council. ===2022 Community Council Election=== The next election is due to be held in May 2022. == References == == External links == * *Official St Fagans Community Council Website ILP Saint Fagans Category:Communities in Cardiff ",
