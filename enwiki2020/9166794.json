    "text": "The DURO (Durable Robust) is a series of wheeled, multi-purpose military transport vehicles produced by General Dynamics European Land Systems/MOWAG in both four and six wheel drive. It was initially developed for Switzerland by Bucher-Guyer AG in Niederweningen, Switzerland. An initial 3000 vehicles order for the Swiss Armed Forces came through in 1994. In January 2003 the production was transferred to MOWAG in Kreuzlingen. Over 4,000 DURO 4x4 and 6x6 vehicles are now in service worldwide. Main customers are Switzerland, Germany, Venezuela, and the UK. In addition to these, the vehicle is used in many other countries for special purposes. == DURO I == == DURO II == ==DURO III== A DURO IIIO of the Swiss Army The DURO III is available as a 4x4, 6x6, and an armoured 6x6 with modular shelter. ===DURO IIIP / DURO GMTF=== The DURO IIIP ( also named DURO GMTF) is a version only available in 6x6 form. It is heavily armoured and has a remote controlled machine-gun. It is used by the Danish Army as an ambulance, and by the Swiss Army in the roles of APC, NBC- Reconnaissance and ambulance in international peace support missions of Swissint.MOWAG GmbH - Products > EAGLE IV 4x4 The DURO IIIP is also used by Germany. ===YAK=== The YAK is an upgraded, ballistic and mine-protected, variant of the DURO IIIP 6x6 chassis used by the German Army. It is made by Rheinmetall MAN Military Vehicles. The German Army uses the YAK for a variety of roles. The first batch of DURO III vehicles for Germany consisted of 30 vehicles, these consisting of ambulance (12), Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) (10), military police (four) and support vehicles for the LUNA Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (four). Final deliveries were made late in 2005. Another 100 vehicles were ordered with deliveries between 2006 and 2009. The actual contract covered the supply of 100 Yak chassis and a total of 114 bodies in the following configurations: 31 \u00d7 mobile medical team; 8 \u00d7 prisoner transport; 6 \u00d7 water cannon; 23 \u00d7 command post for military police; 23 \u00d7 air base security; 2 \u00d7 military geography; 21 \u00d7 explosive ordnance disposal. Late in 2007 an order was placed by the German Army for another batch of seven Yak vehicles, six additional LUNA ground stations and a BIO reconnaissance vehicle. In 2008 RMMV delivered three armoured NBC field laboratories to the Swiss Army which are similar to the Yak. ===MOWAG Eagle IV and V=== The MOWAG Eagle IV and V were based on the DURO IIIP chassis. ==Civil use== The 4X4 and 6X6 Duro was also offered in various configurations as a fire engine: *Emergency vehicle for up to 16 firefighters *Hose laying vehicle with 2 x 1000m hoses. *Small fire engine with fire 800l tank *Liquid transporter 800l water & 100l foam. These vehicles are in use in different fire units in Switzerland, such as the fire departments of Bern, Frick, Baar. In the 1990s, consideration was given to introducing the Duro to the fire service of the former GDR as a substitute for the Robur LO. Robur and Duro have similar exterior dimensions, therefore existing fire houses required no structural alterations for new vehicles. The conversion failed due to the purchase price of Duro, which exceeded the financial strength of the fire departments. The 4x4 Duro was also offered as a commercial vehicle for communities and municipalities as dump trucks or with solid aluminum construction as service vehicles, but there were no significant sales. Also in the configuration as a civilian ambulance, there were no successes. A small number of vehicles are provided as expedition vehicles, privately owned. Converted from civilian companies or individuals as offroad campers, coach expedition and expedition vehicle based on 4x4 and 6x6 Duros. ==Operators== Map with Duro operators in blue ===Current operators=== * Polic\u00eda Boliviana * * * * * * ==See also== * AGF (Light infantry vehicle) * Armoured Multi-Purpose Vehicle (AMPV) * ATF Dingo * Boxer (Armoured Fighting Vehicle) * KMW Grizzly * LAPV Enok * Mungo ESK * Pinzgauer High Mobility All-Terrain Vehicle - a rather similar, but older, Austrian vehicle * RMMV TPz (Transportpanzer) Fuchs ==Gallery== File:MOWAG Duro IIIP f\u00fcr die Schweizer Armee.jpg|MOWAG Duro IIIP ordered by the Swiss Army File:GMTF_11Pl-2t_6x6_GL_DURO_IIIP_(11089643403).jpg|DURO IIIP / Duro GMTF Swiss Army File:Mowag_Ambulance_Front.jpg|MOWAG Duro IIIP Ambulance from the Swissint ==References== ==External links== *Duro 3 on the Homepage of the German Army *Duro IIIP brochure *Danish DURO IIIP Category:Armoured fighting vehicles of Germany Category:Armoured fighting vehicles of the post\u2013Cold War period Category:Armoured personnel carriers Category:Military trucks of Switzerland Category:Off-road vehicles Category:Post\u2013Cold War military vehicles of Germany Yak ",
