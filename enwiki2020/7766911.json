The village has a Serb ethnic majority and its population numbering 780 people (2002 census). ==Name== The name Bano\u0161tor means \"the monastery of the ban\". It was named after a monastery that was founded at this location in the 12th century. The founder of a monastery was the son of the Serbian \u017eupan Uro\u0161 I, ban Belo\u0161, who was a palatine of the Kingdom of Hungary, and who ruled over Srem from 1142 to 1163.

It was later conquered by the Romans in 1st century BC and was renamed to Bononia. Romans transformed the settlement into a military stronghold with a Roman military unit based here known as Cohors Alpinorum. The Roman legion named Herculia VI was also stationed in the town. Two religious altars were also situated near Bononia, one of them was dedicated to Jupiter and another one to Neptune. Many Serbs from this area were executed in the Jasenovac Concentration Camp (1941\u20131945) by the Fascist Croatian regime of Ustashe who sided with Nazi Germany during the Second World War. ==Historical population== *1921: 1,095 *1931: 1,784 *1948: 705 *1953: 677 *1961: 678 *1971: 733 *1981: 650 *1991: 618 *2002: 780 *2011: 737 ==Features== Bano\u0161tor is located on the edge of the Fru\u0161ka Gora Mountain Range and on the Danube River.
