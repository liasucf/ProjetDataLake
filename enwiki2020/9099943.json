It was located on the now abandoned Southern Pacific Railroad line north-northeast of Susanville, at an elevation of 5305 feet (1617 m). This town straddles U.S. Highway 395 north of Ravendale. It was the original 1900 terminus of the Nevada\u2013California\u2013Oregon Railway, before the line was extended north. A post office opened in 1908, closed in 1914, and re-opened in 1915. ==References== ==External links== * Termo- California Ghost Town Category:Unincorporated communities in California Category:Unincorporated communities in Lassen County, California ",
