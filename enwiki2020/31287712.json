It was the 33rd edition of the World Team Cup, and was part of the 250 series of the 2011 ATP World Tour. It took place at the Rochusclub in D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. After ARAG discontinued sponsorship for the event and organizers failed to find a new sponsor, the 2011 edition of the tournament was cancelled. However a new sponsor (Power Horse) was found in January 2011, and so the 2011 edition of the Cup took place between May 15\u201321. Leading the team roster, the defending champions, Argentina, also won in 2007, 2002 and 1980. They were joined by 4-time champions Sweden, Spain and United States, 3-time champions Germany (one additional title by West Germany), one-time champions Serbia (also a part of the 1990 winning team Yugoslavia), 4-time runners-up Russia and newcomers Kazakhstan. Argentina won all the matches in the Red Group reaching the final where they were joined by Germany winner of Blue Group with a 2\u20131 record. Germany won the Cup with a 2\u20131 win against Argentina, the double match being decisive where Philipp Petzschner and Philipp Kohlschreiber defeated Juan Ignacio Chela and M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez ==Points== ==Prize Money== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !width=200| Stage !width=150| Singles !width=150| Doubles 1 |-align=center !align=left| Winning Team (First Place) | \u20ac260,000 | \u20ac10,700 |-align=center !align=left| Finalist (Second Place) | \u20ac168,000 | \u20ac9,000 |-align=center !align=left| Third Place |rowspan=2| \u20ac75,000 | \u20ac6,200 |-align=center !align=left| Fourth Place | \u20ac3,500 |-align=center !align=left| Fifth Place |rowspan=2| \u20ac50,000 | \u20ac1,800 |-align=center !align=left| Sixth Place | \u20ac950 |-align=center !align=left| Seventh Place |rowspan=2| \u20ac29,000 |rowspan=2| \u2013 |-align=center !align=left| Eight Place |} * Places are decided with the Player Winning the Most Total Doubles Matches ==Players== ===Red Group=== ; *Mardy Fish (#11) *Sam Querrey (#25) *John Isner (#35) ; *Juan M\u00f3naco (#37) *Juan Ignacio Chela (#42) *M\u00e1ximo Gonz\u00e1lez (#83) ; *Andrey Golubev (#43) *Mikhail Kukushkin (#62) ; *Robin S\u00f6derling (#5) *Christian Lindell (#326) *Robert Lindstedt (#22 Doubles) *Simon Aspelin (#61 Doubles) ===Blue Group=== ; *Viktor Troicki (#15) *Janko Tipsarevi\u0107 (#33) *Nenad Zimonji\u0107 (#4 Doubles) *Du\u0161an Lajovi\u0107 (#295) ; *Florian Mayer (#28) *Philipp Kohlschreiber (#45) *Philipp Petzschner (#76) *Christopher Kas (#47 Doubles) ; *Daniel Gimeno-Traver (#46) *Marcel Granollers (#52) *Marc L\u00f3pez (#24 Doubles) ; *Mikhail Youzhny (#13) *Dmitry Tursunov (#76) *Igor Andreev (#105) *Victor Baluda (#640) ==Round robin== ===Red Group=== ====Standings==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !width=40|Pos. !width=165|Country !width=80|Points !width=80|Matches !width=80|Sets |- style=\"background:#ccffcc\" |1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 3\u20130 || 8\u20131 || 16\u20132 |- style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |2 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 2\u20131 || 4\u20135 || 10\u201311 |- style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |3 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 1\u20132 || 4\u20135 || 9\u201312 |- style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |4 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 0\u20133 || 2\u20137 || 5\u201315 |} ====Argentina vs Kazakhstan==== ====United States vs Sweden==== ====United States vs Kazakhstan==== ====Argentina vs Sweden==== ====United States vs Argentina==== ====Kazakhstan vs Sweden==== ===Blue Group=== ====Standings==== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !width=40|Pos. !width=165|Country !width=80|Points !width=80|Matches !width=80|Sets |- style=\"background:#ccffcc\" |1 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 2\u20131 || 6\u20133 || 13\u20139 |- style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |2 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | 2\u20131 || 4\u20135 || 10\u201311 |- style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |3 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 1\u20132 || 4\u20135 || 10\u201312 |- style=\"background:#ffffff;\" |4 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | 1\u20132 || 4\u20135 || 10\u201311 |} ====Serbia vs Germany==== ====Spain vs Russia==== ====Germany vs Spain==== ====Serbia vs Russia==== ====Germany vs Russia==== ====Serbia vs Spain==== ==Final== ===Germany vs Argentina=== ==See also== *2011 Davis Cup World Group *2011 Hopman Cup ==References== ==External links== * Official Website * Main Draw Power Horse ATP World Team Championship Power Horse World Team Cup Category:World Team Cup ",
