From 1927 he was a member of the Thomanerchor. After he passed the Abitur at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig followed studies at the of the Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater Leipzig: organ with Karl Straube, piano with Carl Adolf Martienssen and Robert Teichm\u00fcller as well as musical composition with Kurt Thomas, G\u00fcnter Raphael and Johann Nepomuk David. For helping his Half-Jew Teacher G\u00fcnter Raphael, after his dismissal from the university, Ortwein also had to leave. He continued his private studies. From 1937 he began a pianistic activity at German radio stations. During this time he also wrote his first compositions. From 1939 to 1945 he was called up for military service. After further activities as a pianist, he was head of the serious music department at the Leipzig radio station from 1947 to 1949. As there was a lack of entertainment compositions at the station, he began to compose in this field and took the pseudonym Conny Odd. From 1950 to 1953 he was a freelance artist. From 1953 to 1961 he was a lecturer at the Music Pedagogical Institute of the Karl-Marx- University Leipzig. In 1962 he received a lectureship for composition and instrumentation at the University of Music and Theatre Leipzig, where he became a professor in 1976. Among his students were Volker Br\u00e4utigam, Michael Heubach, Walter Thomas Heyn, Karl Ottomar Treibmann, Volkmar Leimert and Rainer Lischka. Ortwein wrote over 100 radio play scores, about 50 film scores, numerous chansons, choral songs and orchestral works. Of his light music, his \"Vergn\u00fcgliche Reisebekanntschaften eines Pianisten\" from 1951 became best known. As Conny Odd, he was the most successful operetta composer of the GDR next to Gerd Natschinski, with some works having a musical theatre character. In the DEFA film Geliebte wei\u00dfe Maus from 1964, for which he wrote the music, he also appeared as pianist of the dance orchestra.
