Nicks released the demo because she felt it was important to give the original. Nicks said the following about the song in the Enchanted liner notes in 1998:Twisted Retrieved February 9, 2019. \"When I was asked to do a song for the movie 'Twister', I had my friend Rebecca read the script. She then gave me the \"Reader's Digest\" condensed version so I could decide whether to do it or not. As she explained it to me, I realized that this really was... MY story. It was about people who had extreme jobs... like chasing tornadoes, or being in a rock band. Anyway... I really handcrafted this song for the movie. Unfortunately, if you saw the movie, you missed the song... and you certainly missed my message. So I decided to give you the original demo, recorded March 10, 1996 on a 4-track Tascam by my assistant extraordinaire, Karen Johnston. I was living in a beach house overlooking Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway, and beyond that, always... the ocean. When I decided to put this in the \"box set,\" I called Jesse Valenzuela and he put some \"vibe\" mandolin on it. I love this song. I hope this time... you will understand it.\" '' ==24 Karat Gold: Songs From The Vault== Nicks re- recorded \"Twisted\" for her 2014 album 24 Karat Gold: Songs from the Vault.Stevie Nicks' Music Retrieved February 9, 2019.
