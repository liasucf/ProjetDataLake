    "text": "Superbird-A2, known as Superbird-6 before launch, was a geostationary communications satellite ordered and operated by Space Communications Corporation (SCC) that was designed and manufactured by Hughes (now Boeing) on the HS-601 platform. It had a mixed Ku band and Ka band payload and was expected replace Superbird-A at the position at 158\u00b0East longitude. It was expected to provided television signals and business communications services throughout Japan, southern and eastern Asia, and Hawaii. While the launch was within the margins specified by the satellite manufacturer, the trajectory analysis had been inexact and the satellite suffered severe life and power degradation. It tried to use a supersynchronous transfer strategy, but Boeing had failed to take into consideration the effect of the Moon. Thus, the lowest part of the orbit dropped too fast and much propellant had to be spent on a fast transit to geosynchronous orbit. Additionally, the solar panels suffered damage from the extreme contact with the atmosphere. Given the damage to the spacecraft, it was never put into service. ==Satellite description== The spacecraft was designed and manufactured by Boeing on the BSS-601 satellite bus. It had a launch mass of , a beginning of life mass of and an end of life mass of . It was designed for a 13-year life. When stowed for launch, it measured . It had two wings with four solar panels each, that generated 4378 W at the end of its design life. When fully deployed, the solar panels spanned , with its antennas in fully extended configuration it was wide. It had a 29-cell NiH2 battery with a power charge of 200Ah. Its propulsion system was composed of a LAE with a thrust of . It also used had 12 bipropellant thrusters for station keeping and attitude control. It included enough propellant for orbit circularization and 13 years of operation. It had a dual Ku band and Ka band payload. The Ku band section had its dual gridded shaped antenna on the West side. It had twenty three transponders powered by TWTA with and output power of 85 Watts. It had a wide beam footprint that covered Japan, southern and eastern Asia, and Hawaii. It's Ka band section had a single gridded shaped antenna on the East side for the wide beam, and a Nadir shaped surface antenna for the steerable beam. It had four 100 MHz transponders powered by TWTA with and output power of 70 Watts. The wide beam covered Japan, southern and eastern Asia, and Hawaii, while the steerable beam could be focus on any zone that had line-of-sight to the satellite. ==History== Space Communications Corporation (SCC) was founded in 1985, the same year as the original companies that later formed JSAT. On September 2001 SCC ordered its third BSS-601 based spacecraft, Superbird-6. It was to use the 158\u00b0 East position and offer a Japan wide beam service in Ku band and Ka band, plus steerable Ka band spot beams. It was expected for a Fall of 2003 launch aboard an Atlas IIAS. It was decided to launch Superbird-6 into a 2,895 minutes period supersynchronous orbit with an apogee of 120,679 km, a perigee of 1,138 km and a 25.5\u00b0 inclination. This extreme perigee and a six-maneuvers circularization program would reduce the propellant expenditure to its final position in geosynchronous orbit. It was launched on April 16, 2004 by an Atlas IIAS that injected in the supersynchronous orbit specified by the satellite manufacturer, at which point it was named Superbird-A2. But the orbit analysis had failed to take into consideration the influence of the Moon at such high apogees and the perigee started to drop dangerously fast. Most of its propellant had to be spent and the solar panels suffered damage that reduced the power production. It was never commissioned into service. ==References== Category:Communications satellites in geostationary orbit Category:Satellites using the BSS-601 bus Category:Spacecraft launched in 2004 Category:Communications satellites of Japan Category:2004 in Japan ",
