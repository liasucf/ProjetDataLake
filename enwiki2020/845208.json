    "text": "Compression seal example A mechanical seal is a device that helps join systems or mechanisms together by preventing leakage (e.g. in a pumping system), containing pressure, or excluding contamination. The effectiveness of a seal is dependent on adhesion in the case of sealants and compression in the case of gaskets. A stationary seal may also be referred to as 'packing'. Seal types: *Induction sealing or cap sealing *Adhesive, sealant *Bodok seal, a specialized gas sealing washer for medical applications *Bonded seal, also known as Dowty seal or Dowty washer. A type of washer with integral gasket, widely used to provide a seal at the entry point of a screw or bolt *Bridgman seal, a piston sealing mechanism that creates a high pressure reservoir from a lower pressure source *Bung *Compression seal fitting *Diaphragm seal *Ferrofluidic seal *Gasket or Mechanical packing **Flange gasket **O-ring **O-ring boss seal **Piston ring *Glass-to-metal seal *Glass-ceramic-to-metal seals *Heat seal *Hose coupling, various types of hose couplings *Hermetic seal *Hydrostatic seal *Hydrodynamic seal *Inflatable seal Seals that inflate and deflate in three basic directions of operation: the axial direction, the radial-in direction, and the radial-out direction. Each of these inflation directions has their own set of performance parameters for measurements such as the height of inflation and the center-line bend radius that the seal can negotiate. Inflatable seals can be used for numerous applications with difficult sealing issues. *Labyrinth seal A seal which creates a tortuous path for the liquid to flow through *Lid (container) *Rotating face mechanical seal *Face seal *Plug *Radial shaft seal *Trap (plumbing) (siphon trap) *Stuffing box (mechanical packing) *Wiper seal *Dry gas seal ==See also== * Leakage (chemistry) ==References== ",
