    "text": "The International Seven Metre Class is a construction class, meaning that the boats are not identical but are all designed to meet specific measurement formula, in this case International Rule. At their heyday, Metre Classes were the most important group of international yacht racing classes, and they are still actively raced around the world. \"Seven\" in class name does not, somewhat confusingly, refer to length of the boat, but product of the formula; 7mR boats are, on average, 13 meters long. == History == The 7mR was used as an Olympic Class during the 1908 and 1920 Olympics. The International Rule was set up in 1907 to replace earlier, simpler handicap system which were often local or at best, national, and often also fairly simple, producing extreme boats which were fast but lightly constructed and impractical. The rule changes several times in history. About 200 boats were ever built. == Rule development == === 1907 Rule === thumb Used from 1907\u201331.12.1917 : 7.000 \\mbox{ metres} = \\frac{L + B + 1/3G +3d + 1/3\\sqrt{S} - F}{2} where * L = waterline length (LWL) * B = beam * G = chain girth * d = difference between girth and chain * S = sail area * F = freeboard === 1919 Rule === Used from 1920\u20131933. : 7.000 \\mbox{ metres} = \\frac{L + 0.25G +2d + \\sqrt{S} - F}{2.5} where * L = waterline length (LWL) * G = chain girth * d = difference between girth and chain * S = sail area * F = freeboard == Olympic results == {| |- | style=\"align:center;\" | 1908 London details |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Great Britain Great Britain (GBR) Charles Rivett-Carnac Norman Bingley Richard Dixon Frances Rivett-Carnac |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|The second competitor failed to make it to the start. |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competition |- | style=\"align:center;\" | 1920 Antwerp details |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Great Britain Great Britain (GBR) Cyril Wright Robert Coleman William Maddison Dorothy Wright |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|Norway Norway (NOR) Johann Faye Sten Abel Christian Dick Neils Neilsen |style=\"vertical-align:top;\"|No further competitors |} Category:Keelboats Category:Olympic sailing classes Category:Development sailing classes ",
