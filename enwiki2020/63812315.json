    "text": "Diphosphorus tetrachloride is an inorganic compound with a chemical formula P2Cl4. It is a colorless liquid that decomposes near room temperature and ignites in air. ==Production== It was first prepared in 1910 by Gauthier by the following reaction: :2 PCl3 \\+ H2 \u2192 P2Cl4 \\+ 2 HCl An improved method involves coevaporation of phosphorus trichloride and copper, as described by the following: :2 PCl3 \\+ 2 Cu \u2192 P2Cl4 \\+ 2 CuCl ==Reactions== Near room temperature, the compound degrades to give phosphorus trichloride and an ill- defined phosphorus monochloride: : P2Cl4 \u2192 PCl3 \\+ 1/n [PCl]n The compound adds to cyclohexene to give trans-C6H10-1,2-(PCl2)2. ==References== category:Phosphorus halides category:Chlorides ",
