    "text": "George Thomas Montgomery (December 30, 1847 \u2013 January 10, 1907) was the first American-born Bishop of the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles (now the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles), serving in that capacity from 1896 to 1902. ==Biography== Bishop Montgomery was born in Saint Lawrence, Kentucky. He was ordained a priest in December 1879 and became a bishop in January 1894. He assisted his predecessor (Bishop Francisco Mora y Borrell) as coadjutor of what was then referred to as the Diocese of Monterey-Los Angeles, and became the ordinary of the diocese when Mora retired in May 1896. During his term Bishop Montgomery faced significant bigotry, but he proved to be both a capable church and civic leader. Among other contributions, he demanded that government recognize the right of parents to send their children to schools of their choice. Bishop Montgomery High School in Torrance, California is named in his honor. Bishop Montgomery was a relative of Zachariah Montgomery and aviation pioneer John J. Montgomery, who both also lived in California. In September 1902 Bishop Montgomery was named coadjutor to Archbishop Patrick William Riordan of San Francisco. He led the archdiocese in caring for the victims of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Archbishop Riordan had departed San Francisco on Easter Monday before April 18, 1906, leaving Montgomery in charge of the Archdiocese. During the fire Bishop Montgomery and Monsignor Charles A. Ramm put out the fire in the bell tower of St. Mary's Cathedral at Van Ness Avenue and O' Farrell Street. The fire was stopped at Van Ness Avenue. Bishop Montgomery died unexpectedly the following January. He is buried at Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma, California. ==See also== ==References== ==External links== * Bishop Montgomery biography on the Archdiocese of LA website * Bishop Montgomery biography on the BMHS website Category:1847 births Category:1907 deaths Category:American Roman Catholic bishops Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles Category:American religious leaders Category:Roman Catholic Archdiocese of San Francisco Category:1906 San Francisco earthquake survivors Category:People from Anderson County, Kentucky Category:Catholics from California Category:Catholics from Kentucky ",
