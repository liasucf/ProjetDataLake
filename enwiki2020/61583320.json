    "text": "Aliens Predator Customizable Card Game is a three-player collectible card game (CCG) that was published in 1997. It was considered one of the more successful CCGs during the late 1990s and was Harper Prism's first foray into the CCG market. ==Publication history== Based on the Alien vs. Predator franchise created in the 1990s, Aliens Predator Customizable Card Game was published by Precedence Entertainment and Harper Prism. ==Gameplay== This is a three-player game. Each player, equipped with a game deck, takes on the role of either the Alien, the Predator or a Colonial Marine. Each role has slightly different rules which lead to different strategies. Each player plays location cards, then moves from card to card, using decoy tokens to hide real movement. When each location is searched, character and equipment cards can be played to give in-game advantages. When two players meet in the same location, combat is resolved with a six-sided die. ==Reception== In the March 1998 edition of Dragon (Issue #245), Allen Varney found the game to be \"exciting... easy to learn, flexible in its variety of scenarios, and fast playing.\" Varney concluded that it was an \"endlessly replayable, adrenaline-pumping game. Bravo!\" ==References== Category:Alien vs. Predator (franchise) games Category:Card games introduced in 1997 ",
