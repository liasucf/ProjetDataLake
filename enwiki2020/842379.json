    "text": "Diego Forl\u00e1n Corazo (; born 19 May 1979) is a Uruguayan professional football manager and former player who played as a forward. At club level, Forl\u00e1n is a two-time winner of both the Pichichi Trophy and the European Golden Shoe. With the Uruguay national team, he had huge individual success at the 2010 World Cup, finishing as joint top scorer with five goals, including the goal of the tournament, and winning the Golden Ball as the tournament's best player. Forl\u00e1n began his career in his native Uruguay as a youth player with Pe\u00f1arol and Danubio, before joining Argentine club Independiente. After rising through their youth team and after a successful four-year spell, he sealed a move to England with Manchester United in 2002. His form for United was not as successful as at Independiente, although he won the Premier League in 2002\u201303 and the FA Cup in 2003\u201304. In the summer of 2004, he moved on to Spanish side Villarreal. In his first season in Spanish football, he scored 25 league goals and won the Pichichi Trophy. After two more successful seasons with Villarreal, Forl\u00e1n joined Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, where he once again became the league's top scorer, and became the first player to win the Pichichi Trophy twice since Ronaldo in 1996\u201397 and 2003\u201304. Forl\u00e1n scored in Atl\u00e9tico's 2010 Europa League final victory against Fulham. In 2011, he joined Inter Milan of Italy before moving to Internacional in 2012. After spells in Japan with Cerezo Osaka, back in Uruguay with his boyhood club Pe\u00f1arol, in India with Mumbai City and in Hong Kong with Kitchee, Forl\u00e1n retired from professional football in August 2019. Forl\u00e1n also had a successful international career, scoring 36 times for his country between his debut in 2002 and his retirement in 2015, including six goals at FIFA World Cups. On 12 July 2011, at the 2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Argentina, which Uruguay won, Forl\u00e1n earned his 79th international cap in a match against Mexico, breaking the record held since 1986 by goalkeeper Rodolfo Rodr\u00edguez. On 20 June 2013, in a match against Nigeria at the 2013 Confederations Cup, Forl\u00e1n became the first Uruguayan to win 100 caps. Forl\u00e1n was Uruguay's all-time leading top scorer from 2011 until Luis Su\u00e1rez overtook him two years later. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Montevideo, Forl\u00e1n, son of former player and Uruguayan international Pablo Forl\u00e1n, was a tennis player in his youth. He decided to follow the occupation of his father in playing football when his sister Alejandra was involved in a horrific car accident, which killed her boyfriend and left her in intensive care for five months and handicapped thereafter. In 1995, when he was 16, Forl\u00e1n was brought to France by manager L\u00e1szl\u00f3 B\u00f6l\u00f6ni, and spent several months on trial at AS Nancy. However, the club opted against signing him, and Forl\u00e1n returned to South America. ===Independiente=== Forl\u00e1n has played for several South American clubs, including Argentine side Independiente, where he scored 37 goals in 80 league games. His goalscoring attracted the attention of European sides, and in January 2002, Independiente agreed a \u00a36.9 million deal with Middlesbrough of the Premier League; the transfer fee would be paid over 18 installments. Forl\u00e1n travelled to England expecting to negotiate with Middlesbrough, but at the last minute Manchester United gazumped the Teesside club, offering Independiente the same fee in a single payment, as well as a more lucrative salary for Forl\u00e1n. On arriving in England, the Uruguayan negotiated with United officials for four hours, then informed the press of his decision. \"Manchester United is a big club, so I've decided to go there,\" he explained. \"The thing is, they offered more money than Middlesbrough.\" He signed for United soon after. ===Manchester United=== Forl\u00e1n was signed for Manchester United by Sir Alex Ferguson for \u00a36.9 million on 22 January 2002. He made his debut on 29 January as a 76th-minute substitute for Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r in a 4\u20130 away win at Bolton Wanderers. He made his first start in 4\u20130 home victory over Tottenham Hotspur on 6 March. Forl\u00e1n made 13 Premier League and five UEFA Champions League appearances in the 2001\u201302 season but did not score. On 18 September 2002, Forl\u00e1n came on as a 56th-minute substitute for Ryan Giggs in a Champions League match versus Maccabi Haifa. He scored his first United goal as an 89th-minute penalty kick in the 5\u20132 win. His first Premier League goal was a 77th-minute equaliser in a home 1\u20131 draw against Aston Villa on 26 October. In Forl\u00e1n's next Premier League game, at home to Southampton on 2 November, he came on as a 79th-minute substitute for United's goalscorer Phil Neville with the score at 1\u20131, and scored the winner with a dipping shot over Southampton goalkeeper Antti Niemi in the 85th minute. The goal also became notable due to his goal celebration where he ripped off his jersey, but then struggled to put it back on as the game recommenced, with Forlan making a blocked tackle while shirtless. On 1 December, Forlan scored his first brace for Manchester United with goals in the 64th and 67th minute of an away 2\u20131 Premier League win at rivals Liverpool. On 17 December 2002, Forl\u00e1n scored the winning goal as United defeated Chelsea in the quarter-finals of the Football League Cup. On 18 January 2003, Forl\u00e1n scored a 90th-minute winning goal to again defeat Chelsea, this time in a Premier League match. Manchester United went on to win the Premier League title in 2002\u201303, and Forl\u00e1n scored six goals to make him the club's third best-scoring striker that season after Ruud van Nistelrooy and Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r. At the start of the 2003\u201304 season, Forl\u00e1n played seven Premier League games without scoring. This run was broken on 25 October, when he equalised the score to 1\u20131 in the 45th minute of a home match versus Fulham, a game which United lost 3\u20131. Forl\u00e1n then scored a goal in his three subsequent matches in three different competitions, starting with an extra- time goal in an away League Cup game at Leeds United which Manchester United won 3\u20132. This was followed by the opener in a 3\u20130 home Premier League victory over Portsmouth and a sixth-minute goal in a win by the same score over Rangers in the Champions League. In his next Champions League game, he scored the 85th-minute winner for United over Panathinaikos in a 1\u20130 away victory. On 6 December 2003, Forl\u00e1n scored two injury-time goals as Manchester United beat Aston Villa 4\u20130 at home in the Premier League. These were Forl\u00e1n's last Premier League goals despite him playing 10 more league games over the season. His only other Manchester United goal was in a 3\u20130 victory over Northampton Town of Division Three on 24 January 2004 in the FA Cup. Diego Forl\u00e1n did not feature at all in United's 3\u20130 victory over Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final on 22 May 2004. He started the 2004\u201305 season with Manchester United and played in a Champions League qualifier against Dinamo Bucure\u0219ti and a 3\u20131 defeat to Arsenal on 8 August in the 2004 FA Community Shield. His last match for United was their first Premier League game that season, a 1\u20130 defeat away to Chelsea on 15 August. Despite not being a success at United, United supporters still sing his name in tribute to the two goals he scored against Liverpool: \"He came from Uruguay, he made the Scousers cry\" and Forlan admits it still makes him smile. ===Villarreal=== Forl\u00e1n was strongly linked with a move to Spanish clubs Levante and Athletic Bilbao (although Athletic only permit Basque players, Forl\u00e1n is of Basque descent), but on 21 August 2004 he signed with Villarreal. Forl\u00e1n's debut for Villarreal was on 30 August 2004, starting away to rivals Valencia and scoring his club's goal in the 77th minute of a 2\u20131 defeat. His next goal came in a home 2\u20130 win over Real Zaragoza on 3 October, and was followed with an equaliser in a 1\u20131 draw at Mallorca and the final goal of a 4\u20130 win at home to Numancia. Between 12 December 2004 and 16 January 2005, Forl\u00e1n scored seven goals in five Primera Divisi\u00f3n matches, including a brace in a 3\u20130 home victory over Barcelona on 9 January. On 22 May 2005, he scored his first hat-trick for a European club with all of Villarreal's goals in a 3\u20133 away draw against eventual league champions Barcelona. A week later he scored two in a 4\u20131 victory over local rivals Levante as Villarreal ended the season in third, qualifying for the Champions League for the first time in the club's history. Forl\u00e1n won the 2004\u201305 Pichichi Trophy for most goals in La Liga, with 25. He also shared the 2005 European Golden Boot with Arsenal striker Thierry Henry. His goal rate declined in the 2005\u201306 season as Villarreal underwent several changes, yet the club reached the semi-finals of the Champions League where they were knocked out by Arsenal. In 2006\u201307, he ended the season with 19 goals in 36 league appearances. ===Atl\u00e9tico Madrid=== ====2007\u201308 season==== 262x262px Forl\u00e1n was linked with a transfer jointly with Juan Rom\u00e1n Riquelme to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in exchange for Luis Perea plus cash in June 2007. On 30 June 2007, following the departure of their captain Fernando Torres to Liverpool, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid confirmed that they had agreed to a fee of around \u20ac21 million. He returned to England in February 2008 to take part in Atl\u00e9tico's UEFA Cup clash against Bolton Wanderers (the club against whom he made his Manchester United debut), but the side lost out 1\u20130 on aggregate. In May 2008, Forl\u00e1n helped Atl\u00e9tico qualify for the Champions League for the first time in over a decade, scoring the winning goal against Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a. He ended his first season in Madrid with 23 goals and formed a potent partnership with Argentinian striker Sergio Ag\u00fcero. ====2008\u201309 season==== On 9 May 2009, Forl\u00e1n scored twice against Espanyol to help Atl\u00e9tico clinch Champions League qualification for a second successive year. Los Rojiblancos were trailing 2\u20130 at half-time and had seen Luis Perea sent off, but came back to win 3\u20132 thanks to a goal of the season contender from Forl\u00e1n, as well as a last minute winner. He also scored crucial goals in wins over Barcelona, Villarreal and Valencia. On 23 May 2009, Forl\u00e1n scored a hat-trick against Athletic Bilbao, which helped him win the La Liga Pichichi Trophy, as well as the European Golden Boot for a second time. He ended the 2008\u201309 season with a very impressive 32 goals in 33 matches. ====2009\u201310 season==== 270x270px Forl\u00e1n started the 2009\u201310 season slowly, and struggled for form as Atl\u00e9tico made their worst start to a league season since their relegation in 2000. On 24 October 2009, Forl\u00e1n scored a penalty and missed another as Atl\u00e9tico were held to a 1\u20131 draw at home against Mallorca, who had played the majority of the second half with just nine players on the field. The disappointing result and performance led to protests from Atl\u00e9tico supporters, as well as criticism for Forl\u00e1n, who was subsequently left out of the squad for the next game. Atl\u00e9tico started to improve after the arrival new manager Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores, and once again, Forl\u00e1n flourished in the second half of the season, as Atl\u00e9tico reached the finals of both the Europa League and Copa del Rey. On 14 February 2010, Forl\u00e1n scored the first goal as Atl\u00e9tico beat Barcelona 2\u20131 at the Vicente Calder\u00f3n, inflicting the eventual Champions only league defeat of the season. On 22 April 2010, Forl\u00e1n scored the only goal of the game in Atl\u00e9tico's Europa League semi-final first leg at home to Liverpool. A week later, Liverpool took the tie to extra time before taking a 2\u20131 aggregate lead. Forl\u00e1n then scored again to make it 2\u20132 on aggregate, giving Atl\u00e9tico the away goal they needed to reach the final, in which they played against Fulham at Volksparkstadion, Hamburg, on 12 May. Forl\u00e1n scored twice against Fulham in the final, in a 2\u20131 win and was awarded man of the match. He ended the season with a total of 28 goals, including six in Atl\u00e9tico's successful Europa League campaign. ====2010\u201311 season==== The 2010\u201311 season began with another trophy for Forl\u00e1n and Atl\u00e9tico, winning the UEFA Super Cup, beating Inter Milan 2\u20130 in Monaco on 27 August 2010. Again Forl\u00e1n started the season slowly, and despite finding the net three times in the opening two league games, he then went 12 matches in all competitions without a goal before finally scoring a double in a 3\u20130 win against Osasuna on 13 November. ===Inter Milan=== On 29 August 2011, it was confirmed that Diego Forl\u00e1n had joined Inter Milan as a replacement for the departing Samuel Eto'o. No financial details were announced but it is believed the 32-year-old signed an initial two-year deal. He made his debut on 11 September 2011, scoring with a high left foot shot in a 4\u20133 defeat at Sicilian club Palermo. On 4 March 2012, Forl\u00e1n scored his second goal for Inter against Catania in a 2\u20132 draw. In April, Forl\u00e1n declared his loyalty to Inter and his intention to stay when he told Sky Sports that \"I want to stay at Inter. You haven't seen the real Forl\u00e1n yet... I wouldn't want to leave Inter like this. I like challenges and I wouldn't want to leave when the team are not in a good position.\" In June, his father confirmed the belief that the striker would see out his contract with the Nerazzurri. On 5 July, however, after only scoring twice in 22 appearances, the Italian club confirmed that he had been released, terminating the final year of his contract. Forl\u00e1n has stated that his poor performance with the Nerazzuri was due to being played out of position. In addition, former Inter and Uruguay player \u00c1lvaro Recoba believed that his compatriot struggled at Inter due to the success of his predecessor Samuel Eto'o, which led Forl\u00e1n to fail to live up to expectations. ===Internacional=== On 6 July 2012, after terminating his contract with Inter, Forl\u00e1n signed a three-year deal with Brazilian club Internacional. He was also linked to Mexican teams Tigres UANL and Club Am\u00e9rica. In January 2013, Forl\u00e1n was linked with another Mexican team, the recently promoted Club Le\u00f3n. At Le\u00f3n, Forl\u00e1n had the chance to play the 2013 Copa Libertadores; Internacional, however, retained Forl\u00e1n's services for the 2013 season. On 28 July 2012, he made his debut for the Brazilian club against Vasco da Gama. Forl\u00e1n scored his first two goals for Internacional in a 4\u20131 win against Flamengo.

On 12 April, Forl\u00e1n scored two goals in the Osaka derby against local club rivals Gamba Osaka. He scored a crucial goal against Shandong Luneng on 23 April to put his team through to the knockout stage of the AFC Champions League. Cerezo Osaka were knocked out in the first round by Guangzhou Evergrande, losing 5\u20131 at home in the first leg. In spite of the disappointing home defeat, they managed to secure a 1\u20130 away win after an own goal by Liao Lisheng. However, this was not enough to overcome the 5\u20132 aggregate lead. Having been relegated in his first season to J2 League, he started off the new campaign with a goal against Tokyo Verdy drawing 1\u20131. Forl\u00e1n scored his first hat-trick against Kyoto Sanga FC on 29 April 2015, his side winning 3\u20130. ===Pe\u00f1arol=== On 10 July 2015, Forl\u00e1n signed an 18-month contract with his boyhood club Pe\u00f1arol.

He scored a hat-trick versus Kerala Blasters on 19 November. Mumbai finished first in the league table and progressed to the semi-final of the playoffs where they would face ATK. After conceding an early goal, Mumbai equalised and soon took the lead from the headers of Leo Costa and Gerson Vieira. In both cases the free kicks were taken by Forl\u00e1n. Forl\u00e1n received a red card in the second half as ATK won the match 3\u20132. ===Kitchee=== 227x227px On 4 January 2018, Forl\u00e1n joined Hong Kong Premier League club Kitchee. He made his debut for Kitchee on 14 January 2018, coming off the bench in the 88th minute in a 2\u20132 draw against Southern.

He is capable of scoring with either foot, both from inside and outside the area, and he is also an accurate set-piece and penalty kick taker. In addition to his accurate finishing, movement, and goalscoring ability, Forl\u00e1n is a skilful player, gifted with good technical ability and ball control, as well as good vision, passing ability, intelligence, and awareness on the ball; these attributes also enable him to be deployed in a more creative role, in which he can play-off of other players and drop into deeper positions to link-up the midfield with the attack, making him a capable assist provider. In addition to his footballing skills, Forl\u00e1n has also been praised for his leadership and determination throughout his career. ==Coaching career== On 20 December 2019, Forl\u00e1n was appointed as manager of his former club Pe\u00f1arol.
