He was an Arab, a member of the Dhawu Zayd, a clan of the Banu Qatada tribe. In 1879 \u2018Abd al-Muttalib was appointed Emir of Mecca for the third time and \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar was sent as a hostage to Istanbul, where he eventually settled in the \u00c7aml\u0131ca Hill district. In 1887 he was made a member of the Council of State with the rank of bala. \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar's first wife was Sabiha Han\u0131m, a Turkish woman. With her he had one daughter, \u015eerife Nimet Han\u0131m, and three sons. Their eldest son was Sharif Damat Muhammed Abd\u00fclmecid Beyefendi, educated in Britain, who married the Ottoman princess Rukiye Sultan, a daughter of \u015eehzade Mehmed Selaheddin, son of Murad V. Their second son, \u015eerif Muhiddin Targan, became a musician and married Safiye Ayla. Their third son was \u015eerif Muhammed Emin Bey. \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar's second wife was an Irishwoman, Isobel Duncan, who converted to Islam and took the name Fatima. She bore him two daughters \u015eerife S\u00fcfeyme Han\u0131m and \u015eerife Musbah Han\u0131m and one son \u015eerif Faisal Bey. \u1e24aydar was widely considered an anglophile before the war; he was also a pan-Islamist with close ties to Indian Muslims. In 1908, he was passed over for the Emirate and it was instead given to \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b, who was older but belonged to the junior Dhawu Awn clan of the Banu Qatada. \u1e24aydar, who was considered a liberal on good terms with the Committee of Union and Progress government, was infuriated. In Istanbul, he served for many years as the naqib al-ashraf, representative of the Hejazi clans. He served as Minister of Waqfs (charitable endowments) from January 1910 in the cabinet of Grand Vizier Ibrahim Hakki Pasha, but he resigned after some time and was replaced by Mustafa Hayri Bey. He also sat for a time in the Imperial Senate. In 1911 the President of the Senate Mehmed Said Pasha was appointed Grand Vizier. Vice-President of the Senate Ahmed Muhtar Pasha was appointed President and \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar was appointed Vice-President. Most of his descendants live in Turkey and took the surname Targan after the Surname Law. ==Life in Medina during World War I== There were rumours upon the Ottoman entry into the world war (1914) that \u1e24usayn ibn \u02bfAl\u012b would be replaced by \u1e24aydar, but nothing happened for two years. On 10 June 1916, \u1e24usayn openly rebelled. Within days, the Grand Vizier Said Halim Pasha had invited \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar by telegram to replace \u1e24usayn and the Minister of the Interior, Talaat Pasha, had visited him at his home to confirm the offer. According to his own account, \u1e24aydar reminded Said Halim of their families' intertwined history: \"The fall of my own family and the rise of the Aoun, to which \u1e24usayn belongs, was entirely due to Mohammed Ali. You are his grandson and I am the great- grandson of Sherif Ghalib whom he deposed. Now God has given you the opportunity to rectify and redeem the crime of your grandfather.\" In June, \u1e24aydar's agent in Jeddah, Ahmed el-Hezazi, was arrested and his house looted by orders of \u1e24usayn. On 2 July 1916, \u1e24usayn was formally dismissed as emir of Mecca and on 16 July, Sultan Mehmed V issued an irad\u00e9 appointing \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar in his place. On 19 July, \u02bfAl\u012b \u1e24aydar was seen off at the Haydarpa\u015fa railway station by the entire cabinet and the future sultan Mehmed VI. Accompanied by a ceremonial guard of 300 infantry and 25 cavalry, he took a train to Damascus, where he was welcomed by Djemal Pasha. Djemal, who distrusted him, attached Nureddin Bey to his retinue with instructions to kill \u1e24aydar if he tried to contact the British. On 29 July, \u1e24aydar's party left Damascus; it arrived in Medina, which was being held by Fakhri Pasha against the rebels, on 1 August. On 9 August, \u1e24aydar issued a proclamation in response to \u1e24usayn's earlier publicly circulated letter: > The enemy has invaded Egypt, the Sudan and India, Yemen, Ahkaf, Oman and > vicinity, and this time he made an attempt on Basra. [...] El Sherif Hessein > leagues himself with that enemy, and is now trying to place the House of > God, the Kibla of Islam, and the tomb of the prophet, under the protection > of a Christian Government, at war with the Turkish Government. and doing > what it can to subjugate all Moslem nations [...] The British translated it and published it in their intelligence bulletin, but its publication in India and Egypt was forbidden. \u1e24aydar meanwhile secured the allegiance of the tribes around Medina by bribery. After the Ottoman forces almost captured Mecca in August 1916, they settled down to a siege in Medina. In March 1917 the government ordered the troops withdrawn, but Fakhri Pasha convinced \u1e24aydar to get the order revoked. \u1e24aydar himself left Medina for Damascus that month. He continued to hold the title Emir of Mecca until the office was abolished by imperial decree in 1919. ==Notes== ==Citations== ==Sources== * * * * Category:1866 births Category:1935 deaths Category:19th- century Arabs Category:20th-century Arabs Category:Ottoman people of World War I Category:Sharifs of Mecca ",
