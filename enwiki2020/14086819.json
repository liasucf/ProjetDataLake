    "text": "Nezamysl Nezamysl was the first of the seven Bohemian mythical princes between the (also mythical) founder of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty P\u0159emysl the Ploughman and the first historical prince Bo\u0159ivoj. The names of the princes were first recorded in Cosmas chronicle and then transmitted into most historical works up into the 19th century, including Franti\u0161ek Palack\u00fd's The History of the Czech Nation in Bohemia and Moravia (1836). One theory connects the number of princes to the frescoes on the \"Ducal Rotunda\" of the Virgin Mary and St Catherine in Znojmo, Moravia, which date back to the late 11th or early 12th century. However, Ane\u017eka Merhautov\u00e1 suggested that the frescoes depict all the members of the P\u0159emyslid dynasty including the Moravian junior princes at the time when it was painted, rather than a P\u0159emyslid pedigree.Barbara Krzemie\u0144ska-Ane\u017eka Merhautov\u00e1-Du\u0161an T\u0159e\u0161t\u00edk: \"Morav\u0161t\u00ed P\u0159emyslovci ve znojemsk\u00e9 rotund\u011b\", Praha 2000. == Origin of the name == Nezamysl's name is thought to be derived from the opposite meaning to P\u0159emysl - \"not thinking\", cf. Roman \"Simplicius\". Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra thought the names of the seven princes were cryptical names of ancient Slavonic days of the week - Nezamysl being the first - Sunday when we do not think/intend to work.Z\u00e1vi\u0161 Kalandra: \"\u010cesk\u00e9 pohanstv\u00ed\", Praha 1947 Another theory says that the names were mistaken from a coherent and partly interrupted old Slavonic text.Vladim\u00edr Karbusick\u00fd: B\u00e1je, m\u00fdty, d\u011bjiny.
