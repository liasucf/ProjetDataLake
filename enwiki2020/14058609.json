    "text": "Robert Caby Robert Caby (Venette, March 25, 1905 - Paris, October 3, 1992) was a French composer and writer. Caby was engaged in writing art critics and political articles, arranging concerts, creating surrealistic drawings and dealing with rare books and paintings. He had a wide circle of friends who were important musicians and artists of the time including Erik Satie, Darius Milhaud, Pablo Picasso, Francis Poulenc, Charles Koechlin and Henri Sauguet. In the mid-1960s he spent a considerable amount of time at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale, doing research and arrangements of Erik Satie's unpublished works from sketchbooks. In cooperation with Salabert he had all of them published posthumously, leading to an awakening public interest in the composer. Caby wrote almost 900 works, songs being in majority, with lyrics mostly by famous poets such as Guillaume Apollinaire. Some of his greatest influences were Erik Satie, Emmanuel Chabrier, Claude Debussy, Ludwig van Beethoven and Franz Schubert. In 1947 Marianne Oswald performed some of his chansons in a French radio broadcast. In 1959 the first phonogram record was produced \u2014 Jacques Douai performing the song \"Belle Belle\". It was only in 2001 that a second recording appeared \u2014 Olof H\u00f6jer performing a wide selection of piano works. ==External links== *The Lied and Art Songs Texts Page created and maintained by Emily Ezust * Official homepage of Robert Caby * Robert Caby biography and recording Category:1905 births Category:1992 deaths Category:20th-century classical composers Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:20th-century French composers Category:20th- century French male musicians ",
