The Forum 2000 Foundation was founded in 1996 as a joint initiative of the Czech President V\u00e1clav Havel, Japanese philanthropist Yohei Sasakawa, and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Elie Wiesel. Mr. Havel based his idea for Forum 2000 on the principle that, \u201cit would be good if intelligent people, not only from the various ends of the earth, different continents, different cultures, from civilization's religious circles, but also from different disciplines of human knowledge could come together somewhere in calm discussion.\u201d The main objective of the Forum 2000 conferences is \u201cto identify the key issues facing civilization and to explore ways to prevent the escalation of conflicts that have religion, culture or ethnicity as their primary components.\u201dhttp://www.demas.cz/en/members-of-demas Forum 2000 aims to provide a platform to discuss these important topics openly and to enhance global dialogue. Through its activities, the Forum 2000 Foundation also intends to promote democracy in non-democratic countries and to support the civil society, respect for human rights and religious, cultural and ethnic tolerance in young democracies. http://www.forum2000.cz/ ==Forum 2000 Annual Conferences == Forum 2000 in \u017dof\u00edn Palace (2011) The annual Forum 2000 Conference, along with other events organized by the Forum 2000 Foundation, are held in Prague.
