    "text": "Hugh (13 May 1024 \u2013 28 April 1109), sometimes called Hugh the Great or Hugh of Semur, was the Abbot of Cluny from 1049 until his death. He was one of the most influential leaders of the monastic orders from the Middle Ages. ==Biography== 334x334px The son of Count Dalmas I of Semur and Aremberge of Vergy, his father wanted him to be a knight and a secular leader. At the age of fifteen, he took his monastic vows, and later became an abbot. Abbot Hugh built the third abbey church at Cluny, the largest structure in Europe for many centuries, with funds provided by Ferdinand I of Le\u00f3n. He was the driving force behind the Cluniac monastic movement during the last quarter of the 11th century, which had priories throughout Southern France and northern Spain. ==Political influence== Hugh's relationship to Ferdinand I and Alphonso VI of Le\u00f3n and Castile, including the release of Alphonso from his brother, Sancho's prison. His influence upon Pope Urban II, who had been prior at Cluny under Hugh, made Hugh one of the most powerful and influential figures of the late 11th century. As the godfather of the Holy Roman Emperor, Henry IV, he also played a role as a mediator during the conflict between Pope Gregory VII and Henry IV, though he was not successful. Additionally, he was an active diplomat to Germany and Hungary on behalf of the church. He died the 28th of April, 1109. Many of his relics were pillaged or destroyed by the Huguenots in 1575. After Clementia of Burgundy was married, she gifted Hugh the Flemish monastery of St. Bertin. This act spread the Cluniac order north of the Loire and initiated monastic reform in Flanders. His feast day is April 29. ==References== ==Sources== * * ==External links== *Catholic Encyclopedia: St. Hugh the Great Category:French abbots Category:1024 births Category:1109 deaths Category:Cluniacs Category:12th-century Christian saints Category:Medieval French saints Category:House of Damas ",
