    "text": "The Battle of Arles was fought between the Visigoths and the Western Roman Empire in 435. The Visigoths and the Romans had previously been in peace after having fought each other at Arles in 425, but in 435 the Visigothic king Theodoric I again broke the peace treaty and invaded Gaul, laying siege to Arles once more. He was however defeated and driven away by the Romans under the leadership of Flavius Aetius and his largely Hunnic army. Two years later, Theodoric was defeated at a decisive battle at Narbonne. ==Sources== * Category:435 Category:Battles involving the Roman Empire Category:Battles involving the Visigoths Arles ",
