    "text": "The gens Iteia or Itia was an obscure plebeian family at ancient Rome. No members of this gens are mentioned by ancient writers, but several are known from inscriptions. Perhaps the most illustrious of the family was Iteius Rufus, legate of Thracia during the reign of Hadrian.PIR, I. 45. ==Origin== Several inscriptions of this gens are from Casilinum in Campania, while others are from Larinum in Samnium, suggesting an Oscan origin. The nomen Iteius appears to belong to a class of gentilicia formed using the suffix ', which was typical of Oscan names.Chase, pp. 120, 121. ==Praenomina== The main praenomina of the Iteii were Quintus, Gaius, and Marcus, all of which were among the most common names throughout Roman history. Other praenomina are found in early inscriptions, including Decimus, Gnaeus, Lucius, and Publius. Of these, Decimus was relatively uncommon in the time of the Republic, but became more widespread in the imperial era. ==Members== * Lucius Itius or Iteius, a moneyer who issued denarii in 149 BC.
