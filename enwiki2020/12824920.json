Sitti also co-wrote one song, \"A Song for Penny Brown\". \"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" is incorrectly printed as the 1952 song \"When I Fall in Love\" (Edward Heyman and Victor Young) on the track listing and liner notes. ==Track listing== #\"Cross My Heart\" (Tracey Thorn, Ben Watt) - 3:33 #\"Time and Tide\" (Basia Trzetrzelewska, Danny White) - 3:59 #\"With or Without You\" (U2) - 3:58 #\"My Ever Changing Moods\" (Paul Weller) - 4:47 #\"Baby, I Love Your Way\" (Peter Frampton) - 5:33 #\"2 Become 1\" (Spice Girls, Matt Rowe, Richard Stannard) - 4:49 #\"Kung Di Rin Lang Ikaw\" (Emil Pama, Warner Music Philippines) - 4:42 #*Literal English translation of title: \"If It Wouldn't Be You\" #\"Hinahanap Hanap Kita\" (Rico Blanco) - 4:07 #*Literal English translation of title: \"Always Searching For You\" #\"Take a Bow\" (Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds, Madonna) - 4:25 #\"I Won't Stand in Your Way\" (Brian Setzer) - 4:24 #\"Smooth Operator\" (Sade Adu, Ray Saint John) - 3:17 #\"Puso'y Nagsasamba\" (Flora Joy Tiu-Suaboksan, Chito Serva\u00f1ez, Warner Music Philippines) - 3:13 #*Literal English translation of title: \"My Heart Is Dancing the Samba\" #\"If You Leave Me Now\" (Peter Cetera) - 4:03 #\"I'll Never Fall in Love Again\" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) - 2:30 #\"Ikaw Lamang\" (Jesus Jodloman, Jr., Warner Music Philippines) - 3:39 #*Literal English translation of title: \"Only You\" #\"I Need to Be in Love\" (Richard Carpenter, John Bettis, Albert Hammond) - 3:04 #\"A Song for Penny Brown\" (Sitti Navarro, Warner Music Philippines) - 3:47 #\"The Look of Love\" (Burt Bacharach, Hal David) - 3:27 ==Personnel== *Sitti Navarro - vocals *Chito Serva\u00f1ez - piano *Erskine Basilio - acoustic guitar *Steven Mora - drums *Jigs Lacap - percussion *Lakshmi Ramirez - double bass *Archie Lacorte - saxophone Category:2007 albums Category:Sitti albums Category:Warner Music Philippines albums ",
