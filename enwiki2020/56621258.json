    "text": "Jamil Hamoudi (1924\u20132003) was an Iraqi artist who became the Director of the Ministry of Culture's Fine Arts Department. He is noted for his involvement in various Iraqi and Arabic art movements including the Hurufiyya movement which bridged the gap between traditional and modern Iraqi art. ==Life and career== Hamoudi started out as a self-taught sculptor in Baghdad. He developed a naturalistic style. In 1944, he was taken on to teach drawing and art history at a school in Baghdad. At the same time he attended classes at the Baghdad College of Fine Arts. He graduated in 1945 and in 1947, took a government scholarship to go to Paris, to study at the \u00c9cole Nationale Sup\u00e9rieure des Beaux-Arts, Acad\u00e9mie Julian, and \u00c9cole du Louvre. He also Hamoudi researched the Assyrian-Babylonian art and languages.Naef, S., A la Recherche d'une Modernit\u00e9 Arabe: L'\u00e9volution des arts Plastiques en Egypte, au Liban et en Irak, Slatkine, 1996, p. 394 In 1943, he created what has been described as the first Iraqi sculpture; a figure of the 11th-century philosopher-poet, Al- Ma\u02bfarri.Beaug\u00e9, F. and Cl\u00e9ment, J-F., L'image dans le Monde Arabe,CNRS \u00c9ditions, 1995, p. 41 By 1947, he was experimenting with abstract paintings using Arabic characters, and as such was one of the early pioneers of hurufiyya art.Inati, S.C., Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics, Humanity Books, 2003, p.76 This led him on a path to discover the graphic possibilities of the letter in art.Beaug\u00e9, F. and Cl\u00e9ment, J-F., L'image dans le Monde Arabe,CNRS \u00c9ditions, 1995, p. 147 Certain art historians regard him as the \"founding father\" of the hurufiyya movement (alphabetical art movement or Letrism movement). Bocco, R., Bozarslan, H. and Sluglett, P., Writing The Modern History Of Iraq: Historiographical And Political Challenges, World Scientific, 2012, p. 478 However, other scholars have suggested that the movement began somewhat earlier with the work of the Iraqi-American artist, Madiha Omar who exhibited huryifiyya artwork in 1949 in Washington.Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017 pp 115-119 Whether he was the movement's founder, or simply helped to popularise the hurufiyya genre, there can be little doubt that he was a leading light in Iraq's modern art movement.Inati, S.C., Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics, Humanity Books, 2003, p.76 He defined his use of Arabic script in the context of rediscovering his own heritage, amid his studies of European art. He wanted to cling onto his own values and traditions as a means of avoiding being overtaken by experiences outside his own heritage. He wrote that there was nothing more sacred that the Arabic alphabet, Amirsadeghi, H., Mikdadi, S. and Shabout, N.M., New Vision: Arab Contemporary Art in the 21st Century, Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 32 saying that his art was \"a form of prayer.\"Beaug\u00e9, F. and Cl\u00e9ment, J-F., L'image dans le Monde Arabe,CNRS \u00c9ditions, 1995, p. 41 Hamoudi actively contributed to Iraqi arts culture through his membership of various art groups and societies in Iraq, and by organising exhibitions for up-coming artists, at a time when Iraq had no public galleries. In 1952, he organised an exhibition, entitled L'Ensemble \"A\" at the Institut Endoplastique in Paris.Miller, D., Lemoine, S. and Mosquera, G., Carmen Herrera: Lines of Sight, Yale University Press, 2016, p. 201 In 1971, he became a founding member of the One Dimension Group, started by his friend and colleague, artist and intellectual, Shakir Hassan Al Said. Treichl, C., Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture, Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117 In 1971 he joined the One Dimension Group when it was founded by Shakir Hassan Al Said and which sought to use art as a means of developing a sense of national identify. Jamil defined his use of Arabic script as a rediscovery of Iraqi heritage, withih the confines of European abstract art. Amirsadeghi, H., Mikdadi, S., Shabout, N.N., New Vision: Arab Contemporary Art in the 21st Century, Thames & Hudson, 2009, p. 32 Hamoudi and the art groups in which he was involved were largely responsible for bridging the gap between modernity and heritage, and establishing Iraqi modern art. Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., Iraq: The Ancient Sites and Iraqi Kurdistan, Bradt Travel Guides, 2015, p. 30 In 1973 he was appointed as Director of Fine Arts at the Ministry of Culture. ==Work== Hamoudi's early works reveal the influence of Cubism movement and later he identified himself with the surrealist movement. In time, however, he distanced himself from Surrealists, claiming: Ultimately, he developed his own style; one that referenced his Iraqi heritage, but also used modern techniques. His paintings are brightly colored and make use of geometric shapes like circles, triangles and arches, often in repeating patterns, a reference to Arabesque.Massignon, L., Opera minora: Islam, Culture et Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Islamiques, Dar-el-Maaref Liban, 1963,p. 231 For sculpture he frequently used plaster, stone, wood, metal, copper, glass, marble, Plexiglas and ceramics.d ===Publications=== * Peintures, Sculptures, Dessins de Jamil HAMOUDI un artiste de Bagdad, Paris, Librairie Voyelle, 1950 ===Select list of paintings and drawings=== * Sheytan, (The Devil), 1942, gouache on paper, 50 X 35cm * Composition Absraite, 1950, India ink and watercolor, 32 X 24cm) * Huryfieh , 1982, ink on paper, 70 X 100cm * Surat Abasa, 1982, pen on paper, 69 X 69cm * Ezkor Rabbak Eza Nasayt, (If Ever Forgetful Mention Allah), 1985 oil on canvas, 87 X 129cm (now in the collection of the Barjeel Foundation)Barjeel Foundation, Online: * A Trip to Baghdad, 1996, oil on canvas, 69.5 X 69.5cm ==See also== * Islamic art * Islamic calligraphy * List of Iraqi artists ==External link== * Jamil Hamoudia at Art Iraq - digital resource maintained by Iraqi artists which includes reproductions of works lost or damaged during the 2003 invasion, and not accessible via any other reliable public source ==References== Category:1924 births Category:2003 deaths Category:20th-century artists Category:20th-century calligraphers Category:20th-century painters Category:20th-century sculptors Category:Abstract artists Category:Abstract sculptors Category:Artist authors Category:Artists from Baghdad Category:Iraqi artists Category:Iraqi calligraphers Category:Iraqi painters Category:Iraqi sculptors Category:Iraqi expatriates in France ",
