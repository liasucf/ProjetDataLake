(UBC Library Open Collections) Ry\u016bsen-zu \u6d41\u5ba3\u56f3 is a style of woodblock print maps created by the ukiyo-e artist and popular writer Ishikawa Ry\u016bsen (or Tomonobu)(jp) in the Edo period in Japan. == History == The term Ry\u016bsen-zu refers to maps composed by Ry\u016bsen, but it is usually specifically used to mean Japanese provincial maps made by him. As an epoch-making map style, publishers reproduced or reprinted these maps over and over from the late seventeenth century to the mid-eighteenth century, until another popular map style, Sekisui-zu (a map style developed by a geographer, Nagakubo Sekisui,(jp) appeared. Whereas Sekisui pursued geographic accuracy in his maps, Ry\u016bsen created a variety of cartographic productions based on the imagination and experience of an artist and a writer. Ry\u016bsen added new contents to his maps to make attracting productions for the consumers. The features of Ry\u016bsen-zu suggest that a prototype of Ry\u016bsen-zu was kuniezu. According to the exhibition catalogue Cartography in Japan: Official Maps Past and Present, Ry\u016bsen-zu was a remodel of Keich\u014d kuniezu, published in 1605. Provincial mapmaking was initially a political project by the Tokugawa shogunate. The purpose of the map projects was to enable the government to share official information, such as the locations of domains and provinces, the names of feudal lords, and the feudal lords\u2019 annual incomes, to show off their power. The provincial maps also included big cities, major roads, stations, shipping routes, major mountains, rivers, and other geographic landmarks,Elizabeth Mary Berry states that a map is a distinctive instrument of special representation different from a landscape drawing, a photograph, a poem, or a diary. She argues that Ry\u016bsen\u2019s Nihon kaizan ch\u014drikuzu represented the imperial power in Kyoto and the shogunal power in Edo connected by the T\u014dkaid\u014d highway. Elizabeth Mary Berry, Japan in Print: Information and Nation in the Early Modern Period (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2006), 67, 100. but Ry\u016bsen-zu was not simply a provincial map. It should avoid assuming that provincial maps made by an individual artist Ry\u016bsen had the same nature as provincial maps composed by shogunal mapmakers for the style. == Style == Another prototype of Ry\u016bsen-zu is chizu by\u014dbu (jp) (Japanese or folded screens bearing a Japanese provincial map or the world map). The early Ry\u016bsen-style Japanese maps were mostly in the form of by\u014dbu instead of on a sheet of paper. From this standpoint, it makes perfect sense that, as an ukiyo-e painter, Ry\u016bsen stressed aesthetic values rather than the topographic accuracy of his maps, particularly in his early works. The maps consist mainly of three islands\u2014Honsh\u016b, Shikoku, and Ky\u016bshu\u2014shaped by unique wavy coastlines. Ry\u016bsen embedded these islands in a horizontally oblong rectangular frame as a screen panel and used color-coding to differentiate domains, sea, mountains, and other symbols in his maps. Ry\u016bsen produced a multi-color print version, a hand-tinted version, or a black and white version. Ry\u016bsen originally produced maps of Japan as artworks, but the reception of readers could change the original purpose of works. In fact, Ry\u016bsen\u2019s maps played to popular audiences and that his map productions were pastiches of the various kinds of published geographical information (e.g., the stations of major routes, shipping routes, a distance table from Edo, or a turntable of tides) that would have been available in the late seventeenth century.Ry\u016bsen-zu was also a cultural commodity illustrated political spaces.
