The most recent winners of the six continental championships appeared in the tournament, along with hosts Brazil and UEFA Euro 2012 runners-up Italy, who qualified because the Euro 2012 winners, Spain, had also won the most recent FIFA World Cup in 2010 thus securing a spot in the tournament. Host nation, Brazil successfully defended their title with a 3\u20130 win over Spain in the final. It was their fourth Confederations Cup title and third in a row, after previous wins in 1997, 2005 and 2009. According to then FIFA president Sepp Blatter, the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup was the best version of the tournament ever played.Para Joseph Blatter, Brasil organizou a melhor Copa das Confedera\u00e7\u00f5es The competition was the first national team tournament to employ goal-line technology, which was also used at the 2014 World Cup. ==Qualified teams== 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup participating teams {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !Team !Confederation !Qualification method !Date qualification secured !Participation no. |- | |CONMEBOL |Hosts |align=center|30 October 2007 |align=center|7th |- | |UEFA |2010 FIFA World Cup winners |align=center|11 July 2010 |align=center|2nd |- | |AFC |2011 AFC Asian Cup winners |align=center|29 January 2011 |align=center|5th |- | |CONCACAF |2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup winners |align=center|25 June 2011 |align=center|6th |- | |CONMEBOL |2011 Copa Am\u00e9rica winners |align=center|24 July 2011 |align=center|2nd |- | |OFC |2012 OFC Nations Cup winners |align=center|10 June 2012 |align=center|1st |- | |UEFA |UEFA Euro 2012 runners-up1 |align=center|28 June 2012 |align=center|2nd |- | |CAF |2013 Africa Cup of Nations winners |align=center|10 February 2013 |align=center|2nd |} 1 Note: Italy was awarded a spot in the competition because Spain had won both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and UEFA Euro 2012. Since both competitions award their winners a place in the FIFA Confederations Cup, the runner-up of UEFA Euro 2012 received an invitation to the tournament. ==Venues== Six stadiums were used, each in a different city. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- !Rio de Janeiro ! rowspan=\"12\" | !Bras\u00edlia |- |Est\u00e1dio do Maracan\u00e3 |Est\u00e1dio Nacional |- |Capacity: 76,804 |Capacity: 68,009 |- |200x200px |200x200px |- !Fortaleza !Belo Horizonte |- |Est\u00e1dio Castel\u00e3o |Est\u00e1dio Mineir\u00e3o |- |Capacity: 64,846 |Capacity: 62,547 |- |200x200px |200x200px |- !Salvador !Recife |- |Arena Fonte Nova |Arena Pernambuco |- |Capacity: 52,048 |Capacity: 44,248 |- |200x200px |200x200px |} ==Draw== The draw for the competition was held at the Pal\u00e1cio das Conven\u00e7\u00f5es in the Anhembi Convention Center in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil on 1 December 2012.

As the competition partially overlapped with the fourth round of the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification in Asian zone, the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) asked FIFA to consider a change of date. However, the AFC decided that the match day would only be adjusted for the AFC representative at the Confederations Cup, Japan. The official final schedule was presented in Rio de Janeiro on 30 May 2012. All times listed are Bras\u00edlia official time (UTC\u221203:00). All eight teams entered the group stage. The group winners and runners-up advanced to the semi-finals, while the bottom two teams in each group were eliminated from the tournament. The ranking of the teams in each group was determined as follows: # Points obtained in all group matches; # Goal difference in all group matches; # Number of goals scored in all group matches; If two or more teams were equal on the basis of the above three criteria, their rankings were determined as follows: # Points obtained in the group matches between the teams concerned; # Goal difference in the group matches between the teams concerned; # Number of goals scored in the group matches between the teams concerned; # Drawing of lots by the FIFA Organising Committee. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\" |- !colspan=2|Key to colours in group tables |- |bgcolor=#ccffcc style=\"width: 20px\"| |align=left|Team has qualified for the semi-finals |} ===Group A=== {| style=\"width:70%\" cellspacing=\"1\" |- !width=35%| !width=15%| ! |- |15 June 2013 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|3\u20130||' |- |16 June 2013 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|1\u20132||' |- |19 June 2013 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|2\u20130||' |- style=font-size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|4\u20133||' |- |22 June 2013 |- style=font-size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|2\u20134||' |- style=font-size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|1\u20132||' |} ===Group B=== {| style=\"width:70%\" cellspacing=\"1\" |- !width=35%| !width=15%| ! |- |16 June 2013 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|2\u20131||' |- |17 June 2013 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|1\u20136||' |- |20 June 2013 |- style=font- size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|10\u20130||' |- style=font-size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|1\u20132||' |- |23 June 2013 |- style=font-size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|0\u20133||' |- style=font-size:90% |align=right|'||align=center|8\u20130||' |} ==Knockout stage== Brazil won the competition after beating Spain 3\u20130 in the final.

It was unveiled during the draw for the competition. The ball is named \"Cafusa\" () \u2013 a syllabic abbreviation of the words \"\" (Carnival), \"\" (football) and \"samba\", aside of being homophonous with ', the Portuguese name for a zamba i.e. a woman of mixed Amerindian and black African descent. Former Brazil captain Cafu was invited to officially unveil the ball. ==Prize money== The competing national football associations received prize money from FIFA based on their representative team's final finishing position. {| class=\"wikitable\" !Competition stage !Final position !Prize money (US dollars) |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Final |Winner |$4.1m |- |Runner-up |$3.6m |- |rowspan=\"2\"|Match for third place |Third place |$3m |- |Fourth place |$2.5m |- |Group stage |Fifth to eighth place |$1.7m |} ==Goal-line technology== The 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup was the first international tournament for national teams to use goal-line technology. The IFAB officially approved the use of goal-line technology in July 2012, and it was first used in a FIFA competition for the 2012 FIFA Club World Cup in December 2012. Having trialled systems from both Hawk-Eye and GoalRef during the Club World Cup, FIFA announced on 2 April 2013 that the German technology GoalControl had been chosen as the official goal-line technology for the 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup. Its system, GoalControl-4D, uses 14 high-speed cameras located around the pitch and directed at both goals. It was used in the match for third place between Uruguay and Italy to determine the scorer of Italy's first goal. ==Protests== Protesters on the streets of Rio de Janeiro. Their sign translates to \"If the bus fare doesn't drop, Rio is going to stop!\" Prior to the opening ceremony at the Brasilia National Stadium on 15 June, demonstrations took place outside the stadium, organised by people unhappy with the amount of public money spent to enable the hosting of the FIFA World Cup. Police used tear gas and pepper spray to quell the protests. The demonstrations were part of wider unrest and rioting in Brazilian cities initially sparked by increased ticket prices on public transport, but growing to express deeper public disenchantment with the financial management of the country by its government, specially due to the high inflation. The Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff as well as FIFA president Sepp Blatter were heavily booed as they were announced to conduct their speeches at the tournament's opening. Further protests took place the following day prior to the game between Mexico and Italy in Rio de Janeiro. Blatter said that the protesters \"should not use football to make their demands heard\", and that the public expenditure on staging the tournaments was on \"items that are for the future, not just for the World Cup\". As the protests continued to intensify during the week, with a reported participation of over a million people taking to the streets in a hundred different towns and cities, reports in the Brazilian media suggested that FIFA was having to negotiate with the teams to keep them in Brazil and that the tournament could be abandoned. However, a FIFA statement on 21 June insisted that \"to date, neither FIFA nor the local organising committee have ever discussed any such possibility of cancelling the FIFA Confederations Cup\". FIFA General Secretary J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke subsequently admitted that FIFA had held a \"crisis meeting\" involving the Brazilian government regarding the completion of the tournament, but sought to distance FIFA from the wider social unrest, stating that \"the most important thing for us is to detach the World Cup or the Confederations Cup from these problems. We are not the answer to all problems and we are definitely not the reason for such a crisis. We are just part of what Brazil is doing for the next 20 years....the light FIFA is being shown in here, is the wrong one\". He also reaffirmed that the protests had not caused FIFA to consider moving the 2014 World Cup away from Brazil. Just before the final in Rio de Janeiro, a large crowd marched towards the stadium both in support of the team and in continuation over the original protests. Though largely peaceful,http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/06/20136302232802744.html there were some disturbances.http://www.aljazeera.com/news/americas/2013/07/20137162126149643.html ==References== ==External links== *FIFA Confederations Cup Brazil 2013 at FIFA.com *FIFA Technical Report 2013 2013 FIFA Confederations Cup FIFA Confederations Cup FIFA Confederations Cup Category:June 2013 sports events in South America ",
