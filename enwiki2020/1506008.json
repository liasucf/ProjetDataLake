The Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn says he reigned jointly with Conaing Bececlach, ruling the southern half of the island while Conaing ruled the north, after he killed the previous southern ruler, Conaing's brother Eochu F\u00edadmuine,R. A. Stewart Macalister (ed. & trans.), Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The Book of the Taking of Ireland Part V, Irish Texts Society, 1956, p. 257 while KeatingGeoffrey Keating, Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn 1.27 and the Four MastersAnnals of the Four Masters M4361-4368 say he deposed Conaing when he killed Eochu and ruled the whole island. He ruled for seven years, after which Conaing killed him and became High King of the whole island. The Lebor Gab\u00e1la synchronises Lugaid's reign with those of Artaxerxes I (465\u2013424 BC) and Darius II (423\u2013404) of Persia. The chronology of Keating's Foras Feasa ar \u00c9irinn dates his career to 616\u2013609 BC, that of the Annals of the Four Masters to 839\u2013832 BC. ==References== Category:Legendary High Kings of Ireland ",
