    "text": "The boat-billed flycatcher (Megarynchus pitangua) is a passerine bird. It is a large tyrant flycatcher, the only member of the monotypic genus Megarynchus. It breeds in open woodland with some tall trees from Mexico south to Bolivia and Argentina, and through to Trinidad. The nest, built by the female, is an open saucer of sticks. The typical clutch is two or three whitish eggs heavily blotched with brown. These are incubated mostly by the female for 17\u201318 days with a further 24 days to fledging. == Description == Yasuni Nat\u2019l Park - Ecuador In Costa Rica Adult boat-billed flycatchers are one of the largest species of tyrant flycatcher, measuring long and weighing .
