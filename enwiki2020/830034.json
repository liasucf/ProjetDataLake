    "text": "In mathematics, crystals are Cartesian sections of certain fibered categories. They were introduced by , who named them crystals because in some sense they are \"rigid\" and \"grow\". In particular quasicoherent crystals over the crystalline site are analogous to quasicoherent modules over a scheme. An isocrystal is a crystal up to isogeny. They are p-adic analogues of Ql-adic \u00e9tale sheaves, introduced by and (though the definition of isocrystal only appears in part II of this paper by ). Convergent isocrystals are a variation of isocrystals that work better over non-perfect fields, and overconvergent isocrystals are another variation related to overconvergent cohomology theories. A Dieudonn\u00e9 crystal is a crystal with Verschiebung and Frobenius maps. An F-crystal is a structure in semilinear algebra somewhat related to crystals. ==Crystals over the infinitesimal and crystalline sites== The infinitesimal site Inf(X/S) has as objects the infinitesimal extensions of open sets of X. If X is a scheme over S then the sheaf OX/S is defined by OX/S(T) = coordinate ring of T, where we write T as an abbreviation for an object U \u2192 T of Inf(X/S). Sheaves on this site grow in the sense that they can be extended from open sets to infinitesimal extensions of open sets. A crystal on the site Inf(X/S) is a sheaf F of OX/S modules that is rigid in the following sense: :for any map f between objects T, T\u2032 of Inf(X/S), the natural map from f*F(T) to F(T\u2032) is an isomorphism. This is similar to the definition of a quasicoherent sheaf of modules in the Zariski topology. An example of a crystal is the sheaf OX/S. Crystals on the crystalline site are defined in a similar way. ==Crystals in fibered categories== In general, if E is a fibered category over F, then a crystal is a cartesian section of the fibered category. In the special case when F is the category of infinitesimal extensions of a scheme X and E the category of quasicoherent modules over objects of F, then crystals of this fibered category are the same as crystals of the infinitesimal site. ==References== * * * * (letter to Atiyah, Oct. 14 1963) *. * * * * * Category:Algebraic geometry ",
