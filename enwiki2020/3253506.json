The students need the tag \"to use the library or cafeteria, vote in school elections, and in some cases for toilet breaks\". One student was expelled in 2012 after refusing to either wear the tag or to wear a version of it that included the barcode but not the RFID tag. Her objections were for reasons of religion, privacy, and freedom of expression; the school had also forbidden her from handing out leaflets criticizing the program. She later returned to the school following a federal judge's injunction. The school district's website was brought down in retaliation for the program. An individual claiming responsibility for the website disruption described the school district as \"pervs\" for their policy of RFID tracking children. Effective for the 2013-2014 school year, the RFID tracking program has been discontinued. Even during the controversy, the program was very limited in scope. The schools chosen have the fewest percentage of white students (Jones M.S.: 4% and John Jay H.S.: 13%). == History == The district was formed in 1949 via consolidation of several rural school districts, having a mere 823 students: *Clifton *Culebra *Helotes (including the former Los Reyes district which Helotes absorbed in 1939) *Hoffman *Leon Springs *Leon Valley (including the former Evers district which Leon Valley absorbed in 1924) *Locke Hill *Lockhart *Mackey *San Antonio Heights ==See also== *List of school districts in Texas *List of people from San Antonio ==References== ==External links== * Northside ISD Category:School districts in San Antonio Category:School districts in Bandera County, Texas Category:School districts in Bexar County, Texas Category:School districts in Medina County, Texas Category:School districts in Texas Category:1949 establishments in Texas ",
