He was known for playing Captain Peacock in Are You Being Served? and its sequel Grace & Favour (Are You Being Served? Again!) and as Herbert \"Truly\" Truelove in Last of the Summer Wine. ==Early life== Frank Thornton Ball was born in Dulwich, London, the son of Rosina Mary (n\u00e9e Thornton) and William Ernest Ball. His father was an organist at St Stephen's Church, Sydenham Hill,St. Stephen Parish Magazine, Dulwich, London where Frank learned to play the organ for a short while. Music proved too difficult for him, however, and he wanted to act from an early age. His father, who worked in a bank, wanted him to get a \"proper\" job, so he began working in insurance after leaving Alleyn's School. He soon enrolled at a small acting school, the London School of Dramatic Art, and took evening classes. After two years working at the insurance company he was invited to become a day student at the acting school and persuaded his father to finance his studies. During the Second World War, Thornton was evacuated along with the drama school, and his first job was touring with four plays in Ireland, beginning in County Tipperary. After that he served as an airman in the Royal Air Force before ending the war as an officer. From the rank of leading aircraftman he was commissioned as a pilot officer on probation (emergency) on 1 December 1944. On 1 June 1945 his commission was confirmed and he was promoted to flying officer (war substantive). He was demobilised in 1947. ==Marriage== On 5 June 1945, Thornton married actress Beryl Evans in West Wickham; the couple had a daughter, Jane. ==Career== Almost immediately after demobilisation, Thornton joined a repertory company. He appeared in the farce The Party Spirit in the West End alongside Robertson Hare and Ralph Lynn. His first credited screen role was in the film Radio Cab Murder (1954). After working on stage and in a few films during the 1950s, he became a familiar face on British television, specialising in comedy but initially starred in the TV series William Tell. He was a regular on It's a Square World, and appeared in British sitcoms such as Hancock (\"The Blood Donor\", 1961), Steptoe and Son, Sykes, The Goodies and Love Thy Neighbour.

He also appeared in at least one episode of The Navy Lark as his character from The Embassy Lark. In 1969, he starred in The Big Business Lark which ran for one season of thirteen episodes.

In 1984 he starred as Sir John Treymane in the hit London musical Me and My Girl, earning rave reviews and an Olivier Award nomination. He also guest-starred in an episode of the BBC Radio series of Dad's Army entitled \"Ten Seconds from Now\" as the BBC producer Willoughby Maxwell-Troughton, who has to coordinate the chaotic platoon as it tries to broadcast to the nation in a morale-boosting Gang Show- style extravaganza.\"The A to Z of Dad's Army\" Webber,R (Ed): London, Orion, 2000 p174 In 1980 he joined John Cleese in the BBC Television Shakespeare production of The Taming of the Shrew.
