It consists of 47 research centers in the fields ranging from social to natural sciences. ==History== With growing interest in scientific research, the government of the Dutch East Indies established (Scientific Council of the Dutch East Indies) in 1928. It operates as the country's main research organization until the Japanese occupation in 1942. The Dutch returned to Indonesia and resumed control of the council, the institute was renamed (OPIPA, Organisation for Scientific Research) in 1948. In 1956 the organization was nationalized as (MIPI, Indonesian Sciences Council). Then in 1962 the government established the (DURENAS, National Research Affairs Department), while MIPI are in charge of founding and operates various National Research Institutes. And in 1966 the government changed the status of DURENAS into Lembaga Riset Nasional (LEMRENAS) (National Research Institute). In August 1967 the government dissolved LEMRENAS and MIPI with presidential decree no. 128/1967 and established the current Indonesian Institute of Sciences. The new institute runs the operation that was previously covered by LEMRENAS and MIPI. == Research areas == LIPI has several research centers: * Science and technology development * Geotechnology * Oceanography * Limnology * Metallurgy * Biology * Biotechnology * Biomaterial * Physics * Chemistry * Informatics * Electrical engineering and mechatronics * Electronics and telecommunication * Social and cultural sciences * Economy * Population studies * Politics * Regional resources * Calibration,Instrumentation and Metrology * Quality control and testing == Public services == LIPI has launched and are responsible for several public services related to science, technology and research activities across Indonesia. * ARSIP (Scientific Data Mirroring Service) * Indonesia NTP (Network Time Protocol) * Public Cluster (open and free facility to perform distributed computing) * ISSN Online * FRP (Foreign Researcher Permit Online) * ISI (Indonesian Scientific Index) * Indonesia OSS (Indonesia Open Source Software) * Info H@KI (information on Intellectual Property Rights) * Jurnal Online (online journal management system) * KOKI (Online Calculator for Scientific and Financial Performance) * Indonesia MoW (Indonesia Memory of the World) * OPI (online professional organization and conference management system) * LIPI-IR (LIPI Institutional Repository) * SciBlog (online scientific web-log for scientific collaboration) * TESIS Online (archive and repository of theses works in Indonesia) * Uji Kalibrasi (calibration service) * LUP (Lab Uji Polimer) * LEWS (Landslide Early Warning System) == Affiliation == LIPI directly or indirectly authorizes several scientific organizations in Indonesian, as: * CODATA Indonesia * COREMAP ==Botanical Gardens== LIPI manages four botanical gardens in Indonesia, which were all developed during the Dutch colonial period: * Bogor Botanical Garden, West Java * Cibodas Botanical Garden, West Java * Purwodadi Botanical Garden, Pasuruan, East Java * Bali Botanic Garden, Bali ==Electric car== LIPI made an electric car named Marlik (abbreviation of , \"electrical marmot\") with the specifications: 40 km/h plain, 20 km/h steep, 300 kilometers run or 8 hours active with price Rp.40 million ($4,444)/unit for city car and smart car. ==English economic journal== June 2011: To increase LIPI's reputation around the world, and give Indonesian researchers more international credibility from currently ranked about 220th in the world, LIPI has launched a biannual English-language journal, Review of Indonesian Economic and Business Studies (RIEBS). ==Joint projects== Together with Japan's National Institute of Technology and Evaluation, LIPI have significantly increased Indonesia's microbial collection record from 200 to 6,500 between 2003 and 2009 and more than 1,800 microbes are believed to be new discoveries. The Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies has an office (\"KITLV-Jakarta\", set up in 1969) in Jakarta that collaborates with LIPI. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Research institutes in Indonesia Category:Science and technology in Indonesia Category:Members of the International Council for Science ",
