    "text": "The netX network controller family (based on ASICs), developed by Hilscher Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Systemautomation mbH, is a solution for implementing all proven Fieldbus and Real-Time Ethernet systems. It was the first Multi- Protocol ASIC which combines Real-Time-Ethernet and Fieldbus System in one solution. The Multiprotocol functionality is done over a flexible cpu sub system called XC. Through exchanging some microcode the XC is able to realize beside others a PROFINET IRT Switch, EtherCAT Slave, Ethernet Powerlink HUB, PROFIBUS, CAN bus, CC-Link Industrial Networks Interface. == The Hilscher netX family == {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Options are CAN, UART, SPI, I2C, GPIOs**, PIOs and SYNC Trigger. === GPIOs === The GPIOs from Hilscher are able to generate Interrupts, could count level or flags, or could be connected to a timer unit to auto generate a PWM. The Resolution of the PWM is normally 10ns. In some netX ASICS is a dedicated Motion unit with a resolution if 1ns is available. == References == == External links == * Hilscher homepage * ASICS Category: automation Category:Computer networks Category:Industrial Ethernet Category:Industrial computing Category:CAN bus ",
