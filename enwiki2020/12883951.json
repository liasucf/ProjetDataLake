    "text": "Xenocatabolism is a concept in medical bioremediation that relies upon introducing into the body microbial enzymes that break down pathogenic lysosomal, cytosolic and extracellular aggregates. The term, also called xenohydrolysis, was coined by Aubrey de Grey, building upon the work of others. de Grey posited that there are microbes that feed on substances such as amyloid, cholesterol and other related substances in places that are full of human remains, such as graveyards. This was based on the microbial infallibility hypothesis. He states that \"the biomedical approach would be to identify the genetic basis for that capacity, and to put one or two genes into ourselves, thereby enhancing our own ability to break things down, and to thereby get rid of things that we cannot naturally break down\". In order to add credibility the concept, de Grey created an experiment using soil from a graveyard and took the bacteria from it. He used lipofuscin, \"one of the major things that accumulates indigestibly in the body\" \u2013 which some of the bacteria broke down, lending credibility to the hypothesis. de Grey presented this theory on May 29, 2007, at the Googleplex Google TechTalks. ==See also== *Biogerontology ==References== ==External links== * SENS.org, Dr. de Grey's website * Jason Hope, Jason Hope's article *medical bioremediation Category:Bioremediation ",
