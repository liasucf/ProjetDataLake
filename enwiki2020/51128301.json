    "text": "Penllyn (LLR) railway station is the northern terminus of the Llanberis Lake Railway (LLR), located near Llanberis, Gwynedd, Wales. The station has no platforms and passengers are not allowed to board or alight. Most of the LLR was laid around 1970 on part of the trackbed of the closed and lifted Padarn Railway. The line opened between and on 28 May 1971, being extended northwards to Penllyn in 1972, changing Cei Llydan from a terminus to a through station. For thirty years Gilfach Ddu (LLR) was the new line's southern terminus, situated a short distance south of the site of the Padarn Railway's former workmen's station, also named Gilfach Ddu. In 2003 a wholly new extension was opened south westwards, with station as the line's new southern terminus. With this extension Gilfach Ddu (LLR) changed from a terminus to a through station. Penllyn (LLR) is situated a short distance south of the site of the former Padarn Railway workmen's station. The line and station primarily serve tourists and railway enthusiasts.The station and railway, via Llanberis.comThe station and railway, via YouTube ==References== ===Sources=== * * * ==External links== * The station and line in Llanberis Lake Railway * Edwardian 6\" map showing the future station site, overlain with modern satellite images and maps in National Library of Scotland * The station and line in Rail Map Online * Images of the station and line in Yahoo Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1972 Category:Llanberis Category:Heritage railway stations in Gwynedd Category:Railway stations built for UK heritage railways ",
