    "text": "A Tuba to Cuba is a 2018 American documentary film about the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. The leader of New Orleans' famed Preservation Hall Jazz Band seeks to fulfill his late father's dream of retracing their musical roots to the shores of Cuba in search of the indigenous music that gave birth to New Orleans jazz. A Tuba to Cuba celebrates the triumph of the human spirit expressed through the universal language of music and challenges us to resolve to build bridges, not wall. The film was directed by T. G. Herrington and Danny Clinch and narrated by Ben Jaffe whose parents founded Preservation Hall in a segregated 1961 New Orleans.

High on music and hot with the thrill of discovery\" Gary Goldstein of The Los Angeles Times: \"Just sit back and enjoy\" Michael King of The Austin Chronicle: \"Very likely to become a classic of the music documentary genre.\" Janet Pierson, SXSW Director of Film: \"Rare film about music that draws strength from and is true to both art forms\" Jake Salinas of Movie Talk with Jake Salinas: \"A Tuba to Cuba, directed by photographer Danny Clinch and T.G.
