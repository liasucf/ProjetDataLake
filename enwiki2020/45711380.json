He was chosen to replace his brother, Khalil, on 26 January 2012, after Khalil's death in a SAF airstrike in Northern Kordofan in December 2011. ==Biography== Ibrahim was born on 1 January 1955 in Altina, Darfur, in what was then the Anglo-Egyptian colony of Sudan. His father died when he was 4 years old. Largely raised by his mother, Ibrahim studied for an undergraduate degree at the University of Khartoum, before leaving Sudan at the age of 25. Ibrahim was offered a scholarship in Japan, where he spent 7 years, completing his Masters and Doctorate in economics, and becoming a fluent Japanese speaker. Ibrahim later returned to Sudan, before leaving again for Dubai in 2000 due to his opposition to the government. In Dubai he served as the Economic Advisor for JEM for 6 years, before travelling to the United Kingdom in 2006 to serve as JEM's Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Ibrahim formerly taught as a university professor, and was part of JEM's negotiating team at the failed peace talks in Abuja and Doha. == References == Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:People from North Darfur Category:People of the War in Darfur Category:University of Khartoum alumni Category:Zaghawa people ",
