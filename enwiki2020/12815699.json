    "text": "The 1911 FA Charity Shield was the fourth Charity Shield, an annual football match contested by the winners of the previous season's Football League and Southern League competitions. The match was played on 25 September 1911 between Manchester United, winners of the 1910\u201311 Football League, and Swindon Town, winners of the 1910\u201311 Southern League. Manchester United won the match 8\u20134 in front of only 10,000 fans at Stamford Bridge, London. The match remains the highest scoring match in Charity Shield history. Harold Halse scored six goals for Manchester United in this match, a record for the most goals scored by an individual in a Charity Shield match. It is also a record for the most goals scored by an individual Manchester United player in one match, a record that was not equalled for almost 60 years, until George Best in an 8\u20132 win over Northampton Town on 7 February 1970. Proceeds from the sale of tickets at this game were donated to the survivors of the RMS Titanic.Medals to be sold Salisbury Journal 20 April 2005 ==Match details== {| width=\"100%\" |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Hugh Edmonds |- |RB ||2 || Leslie Hofton |- |LB ||3 || George Stacey |- |RH ||4 || Dick Duckworth |- |CH ||5 || Charlie Roberts |- |LH ||6 || Alex Bell |- |OR ||7 || Billy Meredith |- |IR ||8 || Mickey Hamill |- |CF ||9 || Harold Halse |- |IL ||10|| Sandy Turnbull |- |OL ||11|| George Wall |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Ernest Mangnall |} |valign=\"top\"| |valign=\"top\" width=\"50%\"| {| style=\"font-size: 90%\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" align=center |colspan=\"4\"| |- !width=\"25\"| !!width=\"25\"| |- |GK ||1 || Len Skiller |- |RB ||2 || Harry Kay |- |LB ||3 || Billy Tout |- |RH ||4 || Frank Handley |- |CH ||5 || Charlie Bannister |- |LH ||6 || Billy Silto |- |OR ||7 || Bob Jefferson |- |IR ||8 || Harold Fleming |- |CF ||9 || Freddy Wheatcroft |- |IL ||10|| Archie Bown |- |OL ||11|| Sammy Lamb |- |colspan=4|Manager: |- |colspan=\"4\"| Sam Allen |} |} ==References== * * 1911 Comm Charity Shield 1911 Charity Shield 1911 Charity Shield Charity Shield ",
