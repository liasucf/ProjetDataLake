His father worked as a carpenter and other men in his family were blacksmiths, brick layers and plumbers. Lee himself has worked in agriculture picking fruit, which he considers much more difficult than voice acting. ==Career== Lee has narrated hundreds of audiobooks. \"His trademark rich, smooth voice with its hint of a growl turns the word into a seduction\", according to AudioFile. He has won numerous Audie Awards and AudioFile Earphones Awards, and he was named a Golden Voice by AudioFile in 2009. In film, he portrayed the mysterious Trevor Goodchild in Peter Chung's \u00c6on Flux. Other voice credits include Meier Link in both Vampire Hunter D: Bloodlust and Vampire Hunter D, Pavlo Zaitsev in episode 16 of Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex, Jason Wynn in HBO's Spawn animated series, and Aristotle in Reign: The Conqueror. John also had a role as a voice actor playing Cid Bunansa in the video game Final Fantasy XII. Lee was also the producer and screenwriter for the 2001 film Breathing Hard, in which he played the character John Duggan. His \u00c6on Flux co-star Denise Poirier plays his wife Carol. He has written the plays Blood and Milk, Hitler's Head, Passchendaele, Clean Souls and Frankincense. He has adapted into English Schiller's Don Carlos, Racine's Britannicus and Grabbe's Jest, Satire, Irony and Deeper Significance. Passchendaele received its first production at the New York Fringe Festival in August 2010.
