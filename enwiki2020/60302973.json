She currently plays lead on the German National Women's Curling Team skipped by her sister Daniela Jentsch. ==Career== When she was just 17, Jentsch participated in her first World Women's Curling Championship at the 2015 World Women's Curling Championship. Her team of her sister Daniela Jentsch at skip, Stella Hei\u00df at second and Pia-Lisa Sch\u00f6ll at lead beat top teams Sweden and United States before losing their last five games to finish with a record of 4\u20137. Jentsch played in her first European Curling Championships the following season at the 2015 European Curling Championships as third for the German team. The team missed the playoffs with a 4\u20135 record but did qualify their country for the 2016 World Championship. The team struggled during the week of the World Championships, finishing the round robin in tenth place with a 3\u20138 record. The next season, Jentsch would win her first World Curling Tour event, the Latvia International Challenger. At the 2016 Euros, the German team finished 4\u20135 again which was once again enough to qualify for the 2017 Worlds. At the Worlds, the team was sitting at 5\u20134 with two games left. The Germans had a chance to qualify for the playoffs. Unfortunately, they would lose their last two games to Scotland and Czech Republic, ending their chance of reaching the playoffs. That season, the German team was met with disappointment. They tried to qualify for the Olympic Games, at the 2018 Winter Olympic qualification event, but they finished with a record of 2\u20134, missing the playoffs. The next season, the team once again qualified for the Worlds after going 3\u20136 at the Euros. But like in 2016, the team struggled at the World Championship, finishing in twelfth with a 3\u20139 record. The following season, the German team would have success at the Europeans. They reached the playoffs for the first time in their careers with a 5\u20134 record. In the semifinal, they lost to the Swiss team Silvana Tirinzoni 6\u20134. In the bronze medal game though, the Germans turned things around. The team would win the game 7\u20134, winning them the Bronze Medal. It was her first medal at an international competition. Jentsch also won her second tour event this season. Two months after the Europeans, the team won the Qinghai Curling Elite. At the Worlds, her team of Daniela Jentsch, Emira Abbes and Klara-Hermine Fomm were sitting at 4\u20136 after their tenth game with two still to go. The team had another chance to clinch a playoff spot. But once again they lost their next game eliminating them from contention. The team did have a good final game though, beating eventual winners Switzerland 10\u20138 after scoring four in the last end. Team Jentsch's first event of the 2019\u201320 season was at the 2019 Cargill Curling Training Centre Icebreaker where they lost in the quarterfinals. They also had playoff appearances at the 2019 Cameron's Brewing Oakville Fall Classic and the Prestige Hotels & Resorts Curling Classic making the semifinals in both events. The German team also qualified for their first Grand Slam of Curling event, the 2019 Tour Challenge Tier 2 where they went 1\u20133, missing the playoffs. At the 2019 European Curling Championships, the team did not qualify for the playoffs like in 2018, finishing the round-robin in fifth place with a 5\u20134 record. The team was set to represent Germany at the 2020 World Women's Curling Championship before the event got cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. ==Personal life== Jentsch is employed as a soldier athlete.
