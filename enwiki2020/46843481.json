    "text": "The Georgia Swarm are a box lacrosse team in the East Division of the National Lacrosse League. They have been playing at the 13,000-seat Infinite Energy Arena in Duluth, Georgia since their 2016 season. The team was formed as the Minnesota Swarm and played at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota from 2004 until 2015. On May 22, 2015, team owner John Arlotta announced that the Xcel Energy Center, home of the Swarm, did not renew the contract for the team. Instead of negotiating for a new lease, the Swarm began looking for potential relocation sites and eventually chose the Atlanta metro area. In 2017 the Swarm won the NLL championship title against the defending Saskatchewan Rush 2-0 in a best of three series. ==Current roster== ==Head coaching history== Note: This list does not include coaches from the Minnesota Swarm. {| class=\"wikitable\" ! rowspan=\"2\" | # ! rowspan=\"2\" | Name ! rowspan=\"2\" | Term ! colspan=\"4\" | Regular Season ! colspan=\"4\" | Playoffs |- !
