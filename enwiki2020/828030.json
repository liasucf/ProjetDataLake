    "text": "The Elrington and Bosworth Professorship of Anglo-Saxon is the senior professorship in Anglo-Saxon at the University of Cambridge. The first chair was elected in 1878, when a gift endowed in 1867 by Joseph Bosworth, Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford, had increased in value sufficiently to support a stipend of \u00a3500 a year. It was named after its creator and his wife, Anne Elliot, ex-wife of Colonel Hamilton Elrington. The professor holding this chair is traditionally the head of the Department of Anglo-Saxon, Norse and Celtic, University of Cambridge. ==Elrington and Bosworth Professors== *Walter William Skeat (1878) *Hector Munro Chadwick (1912-1941) *Bruce Dickins (1946-1957) *Dorothy Whitelock (1957-1969) *Peter Alan Martin Clemoes (1969-1982) *Raymond Ian Page (1984-1991) *Michael Lapidge (1991) *Simon Douglas Keynes (1999-2019) *Rosalind Love (2019-present) == References == Category:Professorships at the University of Cambridge Category:School of Arts and Humanities, University of Cambridge Category:1878 establishments in England Anglo-Saxon, Elrington and Bosworth Professor of ",
