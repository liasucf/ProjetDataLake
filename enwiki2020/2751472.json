    "text": "The Junction Canal was a canal in the states of New York and Pennsylvania in the United States. The canal was also called the Arnot Canal, after the name of its principal stockholder, John Arnot of Elmira, New York. The canal was built and operated by a private stock company. The canal was partly open in 1854, but the entire length was not finished until 1858. The completed canal was long and had 11 locks. Then intent was to lengthen the reach of the Chemung Canal deeper into Pennsylvania in order to connect to the canal systems there. Competition with railroads led to diminished use of the canal. In 1865 the canal was severely damaged by a flood. In 1866, the stock company was authorized to change its name to the \"Junction Canal and Railroad Company,\" and work commenced in constructing a railroad on its right of way. The canal was last used in 1871, and was then abandoned. ==Points of interest== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Feature ! Coordinates !
