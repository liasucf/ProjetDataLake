The film features Vikram and Tamannaah in the leading roles, with Soori, Jangiri Madhumitha, Baburaj and R. K. Suresh among others portraying supporting roles. The film was released on 12 January 2018. It was dubbed into Hindi and Telugu with the same title. == Plot == The movie begins with Jeeva (Sketch) narrating his story. His uncle Dorai used to tow and bring back vehicles for which the monthly EMI had not been paid. However, during a fight, he loses his hand, and Sketch gets the job. Sketch does his day-to-day job perfectly. Dorai's right-hand Ravi wanted to take over the business. However, Bhaskar Settu (Boss) agrees with Sketch coming up to the position. One day at a college, Sketch tows a scooter that belonged to Manju, Ammu's friend. Another day, he happens to meet her on a bus. When some other guy tries to touch her, Sketch bats away his hand. At the same time, the bus stops quickly, causing Sketch to bump into Ammu. She mistakes this as him trying to make advances on her and yells at him. Only later does she realize that he was trying to protect her, and she falls in love with him. One day, Sketch loses a bike while bringing it back to the garage. The owner gets angry and demands two lakhs from Settu. Sketch realizes that this was a plot by Ravi to embarrass him. He faces them to get back the stolen bike and the money. This earns him back Settu's trust, so they celebrate with alcohol. In the end, Settu talks about a time when his father was insulted by \"Royapuram\" Kumar, a local goon. Settu asks Sketch to sketch a plan to steal Kumar's car. Sketch steals Kumar's car and ends up in a goose chase with police that ends with Sketch creating a rivalry with Kumar. Kumar brings a gang from another state to finish off Sketch and his team. One by one, Sketch's friends die, and Sketch is confused who the killer is. At last, it is revealed in a twist that four boys who were working along with Sketch in Settu's garage were the real killers. They killed them to take Sketch's position. Sketch forgives them and protects the boys from police by asking them to run away. The film ends with indicating Sketch is alive and with a moral: \"avoid child labour.\" ==Cast== *Vikram as Jeeva (Sketch) *Tamannaah as Amuthavalli *Soori as Maari *Baburaj as \"Royapuram\" Kumar *R.
