In 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was continued as Serbia and Montenegro. After Montenegro became an sovereign state in 2006, the United Nations member of Serbia and Montenegro was continued as the Republic of Serbia. Thus, Serbia is the successor state to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (and Serbia and Montenegro) in the United Nations. ==See also== * Breakup of Yugoslavia * Enlargement of the United Nations * List of United Nations member states * List of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1301 to 1400 (2000\u20132002) * United Nations Security Council Resolution 821 ==References== ==External links== * *Text of the Resolution at undocs.org 1326 Category:Foreign relations of Montenegro Category:Foreign relations of Serbia 1326 Category:Serbia and Montenegro 1326 Category:October 2000 events ",
