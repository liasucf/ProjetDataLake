After feeling a little better, he visits the Louvre. When he feels dizzy, he is transported to what is described as the \"space-time of [his] reveries\" by a guardian of the Louvre. The guardians are the souls of each piece of art, with the guardian he meets being of the Winged Victory of Samothrace. On his second day at the Louvre, he looks at the paintings of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. While looking at Recollection of Mortefontaine, he meets Asai Ch\u016b, who had worked on introducing Western-style art to Japan. He is then transported to an art gallery in Ueno which is exhibiting Ch\u016b's works posthumously and hears the writer Natsume S\u014dseki speaking of Ch\u016b's work. Transported into another Corot drawing, he meets Ch\u016b again and they glance upon Corot working on that drawing. On Sunday, the man travels to Auvers-sur-Oise, the final resting place of Vincent van Gogh. Going behind the church of Auvers, he meets van Gogh, who lets him visit his apartment and see his paintings. Back in the present, he visits Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny's house and finally, van Gogh's grave. A few days later, on a Tuesday when the Louvre is closed, he is transported to Paris in 1939 during the evacuation of the museum at the start of World War II. The man learns about the difficult process, which was led by Jacques Jaujard, including the transport of the Mona Lisa, The Raft of the Medusa, and the Winged Victory of Samothrace.

Hans Rollman of PopMatters said that Guardians of the Louvre \"demonstrates that contemporary manga artists can hold their own against the greatest in the pantheon of western art\", commending its artwork and atmosphere, while describing the plot as minimal. Publishers Weekly called the manga \"coolly and resplendently drawn, if rather indifferently written\". Katherine Dacey of MangaBlog was critical of the manga's \"middlebrow sensibility\" and attempt to dictate how art should be appreciated, but commended its sensual imagery. Summer Hayes of Booklist liked the use of color in the manga to \"heighten emotion, create distance, and echo artistic styles\", concluding that while the story has seams, the manga is a \"voyeuristic trip\" showing the relationship between art and life. Guardians of the Louvre was part of the selection for the (2015 Fnac Comics Prize). At \"The Best and Worst Manga of 2016\" panel of Comic-Con International, the manga was part of the list of \"Worst Manga for Anyone, Any Age\". == References == Category:2014 manga Category:Art in anime and manga Category:Comics set in Paris Category:Louvre Category:NBM Publishing titles Category:Seinen manga Category:Shogakukan manga ",
