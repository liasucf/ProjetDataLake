A Champa manuscript recounting the social culture of the Cham community of the early 18th century The Cham script is a Brahmic abugida used to write Cham, an Austronesian language spoken by some 245,000 Chams in Vietnam and Cambodia. It is written horizontally left to right, as in English. == History == The Cham script is a descendant of the Brahmi script of India.Cham. In The Unicode Standard, Version 11.0 (p. 661). Mountain View, CA: Unicode Consortium. Cham was one of the first scripts to develop from a script called the Grantha alphabet some time around 200 CE. It came to Southeast Asia as part of the expansion of Hinduism and Buddhism. Hindu stone temples of the Champa civilization contain both Sanskrit and Chamic language stone inscriptions.Thurgood, Graham. From Ancient Cham to Modern Dialects: Two Thousand Years of Language Contact and Change. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press, 1999. The earliest inscriptions in Vietnam are found in M\u1ef9 S\u01a1n, a temple complex dated to around 400 CE. The oldest inscription is written in faulty Sanskrit. After this, inscriptions alternate between Sanskrit and the Cham language of the times.Claude, Jacques. \"The Use of Sanskrit in the Khmer and Cham Inscriptions.\" In Sanskrit Outside India (Vol. 7, pp. 5-12). Leiden: Panels of the VIIth World Sanskrit Conference. 1991. Cham kings studied classical Indian texts such as the Dharma\u015b\u0101stra and inscriptions make reference to Sanskrit literature. Eventually, while the Cham and Sanskrit languages influenced one another, Cham culture assimilated Hinduism, and Chams were eventually able adequately express the Hindu religion in their own language. By the 8th century, the Cham script had outgrown Sanskrit and the Cham language was in full use. Most preserved manuscripts focus on religious rituals, epic battles and poems, and myths. Modern Chamic languages have the Southeast Asian areal features of monosyllabicity, tonality, and glottalized consonants. However, they had reached the Southeast Asia mainland disyllabic and non-tonal. The script needed to be altered to meet these changes. ==Variety== The Cham now live in two groups: the Western Cham of Cambodia and the Eastern Cham (Phan Rang Cham) of Vietnam. For the first millennium AD, the Chamic languages were a dialect chain along the Vietnam coast. The breakup of this chain into distinct languages occurred once the Vietnamese pushed south, causing most Cham to move back into the highlands while some like Phan Rang Cham became a part of the lowland society ruled by the Vietnamese. The division of Cham into Western and Phan Rang Cham immediately followed the Vietnamese overthrow of the last Cham polity. The Western Cham people are mostly MuslimTrankell & Ovesen 2004 and therefore prefer the Arabic script. The Eastern Cham are mostly Hindu and continued to use the Indic script. During French colonial times, both groups had to use the Latin alphabet. There are two varieties of the Cham script: Akhar Thrah (Eastern Cham) and Akhar Srak (Western Cham). The two are distinct enough to be encoded in separate blocks.Hosken, Martin. (2019). L2/19-217 Proposal to encode Western Cham in the UCS.Everson, M. & Cunningham, A. (2016). L2/16-198 Proposal to encode Western Cham in the SMP of the UCS. A standard ALA-LC romanization of both varieties, which is based on EFEO romanization of Cham, is available.ALA-LC Cham romanization == Usage == The script is highly valued in Cham culture, but this does not mean that many people are learning it.Bruckmayr, Philipp. (2019). The Changing Fates of the Cambodian Islamic Manuscript Tradition. Journal of Islamic Manuscripts, 10(1), 1-23. doi:10.1163/1878464X-01001001 There have been efforts to simplify the spelling and to promote learning the script, but these have met with limited success.Blood (1980a, 1980b, 2008); Brunelle (2008). Traditionally, boys learned the script around the age of twelve when they were old and strong enough to tend to the water buffalo. However, women and girls did not typically learn to read.Blood, Doris E. \"The Script as a Cohesive Factor in Cham Society\". In Notes from Indochina on ethnic minority cultures. Ed. Marilyn Gregerson. 1980 p35-44. The traditional Indic Cham script is still known and used by Vietnam's Eastern Cham but no longer by the Western Cham.Akbar Husain, Wim Swann Horizons of Spiritual Psychology 2009 - Page 28 \"The traditional Cham script, based on an Indian script, is still known and used by the Eastern Cham in Vietnam, but it has been lost by the Western Cham. The Cham language is also non-tonal. Words may contain one, two, or three syllables.\" == Structure == Similar to other abugidas, the consonants of Cham have the inherent vowel. Dependent vowel diacritics are used to modify the inherent vowel. Since Cham does not have vir\u0101ma, special characters should be used for pure consonants. This practice is similar to the chillu consonants of the Malayalam script. The Eastern Cham script. Nasal consonants are shown both unmarked and with the diacritic kai. The vowel diacritics are shown next to a circle, which indicates their position relative to any of the consonants. Most consonant letters, such as , , or , includes an inherent vowel which does not need to be written. The nasal stops, , , , and (the latter two transliterated ny and ng in the Latin alphabet) are exceptions, and have an inherent vowel (transliterated \u00e2). A diacritic called kai, which does not occur with the other consonants, is added below a nasal consonant to write the vowel. Cham words contain vowel and consonant-vowel (V and CV) syllables, apart from the last, which may also be CVC. There are a few characters for final consonants in the Cham script; other consonants merely extend a longer tail on the right side to indicate the absence of a final vowel. ===Consonants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |+ Consonant letters ! ka !! kha !! ga !! gha !! ng\u00e2 ! nga ! ca !! cha !! ja !! jha !! ny\u00e2 ! nya |- | || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! nja ! ta !! tha !! da !! dha !! n\u00e2 ! na !! nda ! pa !! ppa ! pha !! ba |- | || || || || || || || || || || || |- ! bha !! m\u00e2 ! ma !! mba ! ya !! ra !! la !! wa ! xa ! sa !! ha |- | || || || || || || || || || || |} ===Medial consonants=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Medial consonants |- ! !! -ia ! -ra !! -rua ! -la !! -lia ! -lua ! -ua |- | align=\"left\" | diacritics || || || || || || || |- | align=\"left\" | examples || kia || kra || grua || kla || klia || klua || kua |} ===Final consonants=== Cham does not employ a virama to suppress vowels. Final consonants are indicated in one of three ways: an explicit final consonant letter, a combining diacritic mark, or by . {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Final consonant letters |- ! -k !! -g !! -ng ! -c !! -t !! -n !! -p !! -y !! -r !! -l !! -x |- | || || || || || || || || || || |} {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ Final consonant diacritics |- ! !! -ng !! -m !! -h |- | align=\"left\" | diacritics || || || |- | align=\"left\" | shown with (cha) || || || |} ===Independent vowels=== Six of the initial vowels are represented with unique letters: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |+ |- ! a !! i !! u !! \u00e9 !! ai !! o |- | || || || || || |} ===Dedependent vowels=== Other initial vowels are represented by adding a diacritic to the letter (a).

A spiral () can mark the beginning of a section. Sometimes it is combined with a danda: . European punctuation marks like hypen and colon have also found their way into Cham writing. == Unicode == Cham script was added to the Unicode Standard in April, 2008 with the release of version 5.1.
