    "text": "Sunnycroft is a historic house on Locust Hill in the center of Limerick, Maine. Built in 1921-22, it is a picturesque and rambling exposition of Colonial Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. ==Description== Sunnycroft is a 2-1/2 story wood frame house, resting on a fieldstone foundation. It is located on Locust Hill, a high spot overlooking the center of Limerick, and its foundation is exposed on the east side. The southern facade has a significantly projecting gabled portico, supported by two-story fluted Doric columns. This portico has a modillioned cornice, and a fanlight window in the gable pediment. Underneath this portico, the main entry is framed by a smaller portico, which is supported by paired Doric columns (one each square and round), and topped by a balustrade with urn-topped posts. The eastern facade of the house has a porte- cochere. The building has much asymmetrical styling, including semicircular and oval windows, and a number of single-story additions that gives the building a rambling quality, and an architectural sophistication unusual in a rural setting. The house was built by Charles G. Moulton. ==References== Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Colonial Revival architecture in Maine Category:Houses completed in 1922 Category:Houses in York County, Maine Category:Limerick, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in York County, Maine ",
