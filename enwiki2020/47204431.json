In 1989, Lovewell was founded by David Sheridan Spangler in Salina, Kansas. In 1993, Lovewell launched an international cultural exchange with Sweden. In 1996, Lovewell sponsored its first bilingual musical, entitled \"Backstage Story,\" in Oskarshamn, Sweden. In 2009, Lovewell partnered with United Way of America and the Violence Prevention Office of Broward County to conduct a peace education workshop with high school students in south Florida. The high school students produced the original musical Weight of Words, which addressed students' personal experiences with \"parental abuse, harassment due to sexual orientation, nationality, religion or disability, and cyber bullying.\" In 2011, BankAtlantic sponsored five different schools for 5th grades to perform Weight of Words. In 2015, Boca Raton's \"Promise \u2014 The Alliance for Youth\" nonprofit introduced Weight of Words to four more schools in Palm Beach County. ==Notable alumni== Jacob Jeffries, Lead Singer/Pianist for the Jacob Jeffries Band Nathan Tysen, Songwriter and Performer Kait Kerrigan, Playwright, Musical Theatre Lyricist, and Novelist Chris Miller, Musical Theater Song Writer and Composer Keith Center, Lead Singer and Songwriter of The Dreamscapes Project == References == Category:Arts organizations based in the United States Category:Youth organizations based in Kansas Category:Arts organizations established in 1989 Category:Youth organizations established in 1989 Category:1989 establishments in Kansas ",
