Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean\u2013Hu\u1ebf Province The A Shau Valley (Vietnamese: thung l\u0169ng A S\u1ea7u) is a valley in Vietnam's Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf Province, west of the coastal city of Hu\u1ebf, along the border of Laos. The valley runs north and south for 40 kilometers and is a 1.5- kilometer-wide flat bottomland covered with tall elephant grass, flanked by two densely forested mountain ridges whose summits vary in elevation from 900 to 1,800 meters. A Shau Valley was one of the key entry points into South Vietnam for men and material brought along the Ho Chi Minh trail by the North Vietnamese Army and was the scene of heavy fighting during the Vietnam War. The A Shau Valley is bisected lengthwise by Route 548. The Ho Chi Minh Highway now runs along the valley floor. ==See also== *Battle of A Shau *Battle of Fire Support Base Ripcord *Battle of Hamburger Hill *Battle of Signal Hill Vietnam *Dong Ap Bia *Dong Re Lao Mountain *Operation Apache Snow *Operation Delaware *Operation Dewey Canyon *Operation Somerset Plain ==References== ==External links== Category:Valleys of Vietnam Category:Battlefields in Vietnam Category:Landforms of Th\u1eeba Thi\u00ean-Hu\u1ebf Province ",
