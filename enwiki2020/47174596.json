Ferrato began visiting the famous swingers club Plato's Retreat after landing an assignment with New York Magazine to photograph owner Larry Levenson, and was then commissioned by Japanese Playboy to photograph a prominent swinger couple known as Garth and Lisa. Ferrato immersed herself in Garth and Lisa's life, moving in with the couple at their Saddle River mansion. \"I was there for the orgies as well as the typical family moments,\" Ferrato writes in Love & Lust. \"As time passed, however, I began to realize that Garth was not the benign, devoted husband he had first appeared to be...and one night, I witnessed a horrific scene: Garth attacked Lisa and beat her mercilessly as she cowered in the master bathroom. That night changed me forever, and also altered the direction of my work for the next ten years...I was now driven to reveal the unspeakable things that were happening behind closed doors.\" \"I took the picture because without it I knew no one would ever believe it happened,\" Ferrato told Time in 2012.I Am Unbeatable: Donna Ferrato\u2019s Commitment to Abused Women For the next decade, Ferrato travelled across the country photographing domestic violence, riding in police cars, sleeping in shelters, and staying in the homes of battered women. Her work led to the publication of Living With the Enemy (Aperture Foundation, 1991), an expos\u00e9 of the hidden world of domestic violence. The New York Times wrote, \"Living with the Enemy is both harrowing and moving. With their shocking immediacy, these photographs offer the kind of urgent call to action provided by all great documentary photographs.\"New York Times review of Living With the Enemy Living With the Enemy went into four printings, and, alongside exhibitions and lectures around the world, sparked a national discussion on sexual violence and women\u2019s rights. In 2011, Ferrato launched the I Am Unbeatable campaign, which aims to expose, document, and raise awareness of domestic violence by creating an archive of stories, photographs, and video narratives.I Am UnbeatableThe New York Times Lens Blog: Helping the People Beyond the PainThe New York Times Lens Blog: Leaving Abuse Behind In 1991 Ferrato was the highest bidder at an auction to have tea with the new First Lady Hillary Clinton.

Photographer Mary Ellen Mark wrote of the portfolios, \"Donna Ferrato\u2019s powerful documentary photographs have taken us into worlds we could never imagine witnessing....you almost feel that she knows when a picture is going to happen before it happens \u2014 and then she snatches it, like a spider in waiting. This collection of images seem to come from the dreams in a diary. A poetic tribute to Donna\u2019s home, Tribeca.\" In 2011, Ferrato published the book Tribeca: 9/11/01-9/11/11, about the area in the decade after the September 11 attacks. ==Awards== *1985: W.
