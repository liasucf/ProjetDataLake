Jean-Edme studied theology until 1763 and was called to the ministry in 1763. Three years later, he was called as pastor of the Walloon church in London but his delicate health not accommodating to the climate, he returned to Geneva and was ordered to serve the church of Chancy. He married Fran\u00e7oise Doroth\u00e9e Argand (1748\u20131797), with whom he had a daughter, Marie Jos\u00e9phine Romilly (1770\u20131823). In 1770, the Council of State of Geneva granted him his resignation, \"retaining him his rank, given his distinguished talents.\" Charles Palissot de Montenoy, who knew him specifically, painted a man of gentle and regular manners, highly educated and endowed with the most amiable modesty. He left the reputation of a good preacher. His sermons were distinguished by a soft and persuasive unction rather than by a strong and male eloquence. In 1780, pastor Jean-Jacques Juventin published in Geneva a collection of his sermons in 2 vol. in-8\u00b0, putting ahead the \u00c9loge of the author. A friend of Rousseau, d'Alembert, Diderot and Voltaire, like his father Jean-Edme Romilly worked for the Encyclop\u00e9die to which he contributed the articles Tol\u00e9rance and Vertu. He also provided several articles about famous Genevois, among others Jean-Jacques Rousseau, to the M\u00e9moires de litt\u00e9rature by Palissot. He was Juliette Cavaignac's uncle. == Sources == * Eug\u00e8ne Haag, La France protestante, t. 8, Paris, Jo\u00ebl Cherbuliez, 1858, (p. 513). == External links == * Jean-Edme Romilly on Wikisource * Genealogy on Geneanet Category:Theologians from the Republic of Geneva Category:Contributors to the Encyclop\u00e9die (1751\u20131772) Category:People from Geneva Category:18th-century births Category:1779 deaths Category:18th century in Geneva ",
