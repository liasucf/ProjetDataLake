Shanker Saran, retired judge Honorable High Court of Allahabad and Late Vishwamitra, an advocate, were respectively the president and secretary of the society. This school was self-sustaining in its activities. A good number of students were admitted every year. The students were awarded two years' Diploma in Civil Engineering Course by the Board of Engineering College. In 1962, U.P. Government took over this Institute by constituting a registered society named \"Allahabad Polytechnic, Allahabad.\" The society constituted a Board of Management/Managing Committee consisting of 11 members to manage affairs of the polytechnic. The state government awarded the status of Grant in Aid to the Institute. The rules and by-laws of the society were accordingly framed and the Director of Technical Education, U.P. became ex-officio Secretary of Management Committee. Reviewing the multifarious activities and the achievements of the Institute in the country and abroad, the U.P. Government changed the name of Allahabad Polytechnic to \"Institute of Engineering and Rural Technology\" (I.E.R.T.) in 1982 and designated the post of \"director\" in place of principal. The institute was simultaneously awarded Academic Autonomy. An Autonomy Committee was constituted and Secretary Technical Education, U.P. became ex officio Chairman of the committee. The Engineering Degree Division was set in 2001 and the college started offering degree courses in engineering with affiliation from Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam Technical University, Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh. The college is very best in the country in diploma engineering programs. The institute maintains the same position. The same can be said for degree courses. ==Courses offered== All the following courses are duly recognized by Uttar Pradesh Government as well as by AICTE,http://www.aicte- india.org/downloads/List_of_Approved_Institutes_2015-2016.pdf Government of India. ===Engineering Degree Courses=== *Civil Engineering *Computer Science and Engineering *Electrical Engineering *Electronics Engineering *Industrial and Production Engineering *Instrumentation and Control Engineering *Mechanical Engineering ===Management Diploma Courses=== *Commercial Practice *Marketing Management *Materials Management ===Engineering Diploma Courses=== 1.Mechanical Engineering Specialization in 7 stream *Power Plant *Refrigeration and Air Conditioning *Tube-well *Production *Tool and plant *Automobile *Plastic Technology 2.Civil Engineering Specialization in 3 stream *Architecture and Town planning *Construction Technology *Public Health Engineering 3\\.
