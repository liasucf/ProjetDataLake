    "text": "The 2019\u201320 Premiership Cup was the 48th season of England's national rugby union cup competition and the second under the new Premiership Rugby Cup format following the disbanding of the Anglo-Welsh Cup at the end of the 2017-18 season due to the withdrawal of the Welsh Pro14 regions. Although there were no stipulations on player selection, the cup was seen by many clubs as a development competition, and games took place during the 2019 Rugby World Cup and during the Six Nations. Northampton Saints entered the competition as reigning champions, becoming the first winners of the Premiership Cup when they defeated Saracens 23 \u2013 9 in the final at Franklin's Gardens during the 2019\u201320 season. ==Competition format== The competition consisted of the twelve Premiership Rugby teams arranged in three pools of four clubs each, with each team playing three games against teams in their pool, as well as a 'derby' game against a team in another pool. The top team in each pool, plus the best overall runner up, progressed to the semi-finals, with the highest ranked teams having home advantage. The winners of the semi-finals then met in the final in March 2020, held at the home ground of the highest ranked remaining team. ==Teams and locations== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !| Club !| Director of Rugby/Head Coach !| Captain !| Kit supplier !| Stadium !| Capacity !| City/Area |- | Bath | Stuart Hooper | Matt Garvey | Canterbury | The Recreation Ground | align=center | 14,509 | Bath |- | Bristol Bears | Pat Lam | Steve Luatua | Bristol Sport | Ashton Gate | align=center | 27,000 | Bristol |- | Exeter Chiefs | Rob Baxter | Jack Yeandle | Samurai Sportswear | Sandy Park | align=center | 13,593 | Exeter |- | Gloucester | David Humphreys | Willi Heinz | Elite Pro Sports | Kingsholm Stadium | align=center | 16,115 | Gloucester |- | Harlequins | Paul Gustard Billy Millard | Chris Robshaw | Adidas | Twickenham Stoop | align=center| 14,800 | Twickenham, Greater London |- | Leicester Tigers | Geordan Murphy | Tom Youngs | Kukri | Welford Road | align=center | 25,849 | Leicester |- | London Irish | Declan Kidney | Blair Cowan Stephen Myler Dave Porecki Franco van der Merwe | BLK | Madejski Stadium | align=center | 24,162 | Reading, Berkshire |- | Northampton Saints | Chris Boyd | Dylan Hartley Alex Waller | Macron | Franklin's Gardens | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 15,200 | Northampton |- | Sale Sharks | Steve Diamond | Jono Ross | Samurai Sportswear | AJ Bell Stadium | align=center | 12,000 | Salford, Greater Manchester |- | Saracens | Mark McCall | Brad Barritt | Nike | Allianz Park | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 7,500 | Barnet, Greater London |- | Wasps | Dai Young to 11 February Lee Blackett from 11 February | | Under Armour | Ricoh Arena | align=center | 32,609 | Coventry |- | Worcester Warriors | Alan Solomons | GJ van Velze | VX-3 | Sixways Stadium | align=center | 11,499 | Worcester |} ==Pool stage== The pool stage began on 20 September 2019 and ran for four consecutive weeks.
