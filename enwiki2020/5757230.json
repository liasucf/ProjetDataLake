By 2010 the Allianz asset management division, going under the name of Allianz Global Investors by then had reached EUR 1500bn. In 2011, a decision was taken to combine most of the different investment managers into a globally integrated asset manager; from 2012 Allianz moved to what they call a \u201ctwo pillar\u201d model where Allianz Global Investors and PIMCO operate separately from each other despite common ownership.
