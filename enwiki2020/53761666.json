Ben- Azen's was titled: \"Cup Bearer\",Dr Rosalie David & Anthony E. David, A Biographical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt, p.24 meaning he was in a high position stationed next to the kings themselves despite his foreign descent that allegedly should have restricted him to menial tasks. According to an inscription asserted to him, Ben-Azen had came to Egypt from Northern Jordan, thus he's to be referred to as Canaanite in terms of ethnic background. Like many \"butlers\" (a term coined to the officials of foreign descent) in the Ramesside era, Ben Azen reflects the Asiatic tone the Royal Court had.Marc Van De Mieroop, A History of Ancient Egypt ==References== Category:Canaan Category:People of the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt ",
