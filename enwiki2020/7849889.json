IGN contributor Robert Canning, wrote, \"Even in an episode like 'The 'C' Word,' where some of the ideas fall a bit short, there were still plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to talk about. [...] In the end, the great writing outweighed the slightly bothersome contrivances to make this yet another laugh-filled episode of 30 Rock.\" He said that the pairing of Jack and Tracy \"gave us another opportunity to enjoy the pairing of the polar opposite personalities\". Canning reported that the Liz plot had \"its funny moments\", but opined that it was hard to \"get past the fact this wasn't exactly the Liz we knew\", in regards to her being a \"domineering boss that cares little about her employees.\" Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that putting Alec Baldwin and Rip Torn together \"was a genius move.\" She was complimentary towards Tina Fey, citing that it was \"another great week\" in her \"continuing portrayal of what being a hard-working gal is actually like.\" Ward enjoyed Tracy's speech, noting that it was \"priceless\", and was glad to see him having \"ample screen time ... which was a nice change of pace.\" TV Guide's Matt Mitovich wrote he enjoyed all of the episode's storyline pairings, but much enjoyed Jack and Tracy. Further in his recap, Mitovich reported that Liz's plot could have been better had the comedy show How I Met Your Mother \"not gone there with the C-word\" in an episode. Though, he said that Liz's story \"had a fitting message \u2013 that she is held to a different standard, yet shouldn't be, as a female head writer. Plus, her story gave us that winning flurry of flashbacks to times when she was a... not very nice lady.\" ==References== ==External links== * * Category:2007 American television episodes Category:30 Rock (season 1) episodes Category:Television episodes about profanity Category:Television episodes written by Tina Fey ",
