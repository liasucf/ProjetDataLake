    "text": "Lloyd George Knew My Father is a 1972 play by the British playwright William Douglas-Home. The black comedy features an elderly and eccentric aristocratic couple who learn that a bypass is to be built through their property. The wife declares her intention to commit suicide in protest, and the complications arising from this set up the rest of the play's action. The play has had various revivals and has continued to be staged into the 21st Century. The Devonshire Park Theatre staged the play in 1974. Wendy Toye directed the play in 1995 at the Watermill Theatre, which was topical because of the nearby construction of the Newbury bypass. A production was mounted by the Salisbury Studio Theatre. The King's Theatre in Edinburgh mounted a production in 2009. A version was shown on British television in 1982. ==References== Category:English plays Category:Black comedy plays Category:1972 plays Category:Scottish plays Category:Plays by William Douglas-Home ",
