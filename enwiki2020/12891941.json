Of those, five players would eventually play in the Major Leagues. The Dodgers lost their first round pick in the June draft to the San Diego Padres because they signed free agent Derrel Thomas but they gained the first round picks of the Pittsburgh Pirates (compensation for Lee Lacy) and New York Yankees (for Tommy John). With those picks they drafted two players from the University of Michigan, left-handed pitcher Steve Howe and right-handed pitcher Steve Perry. Howe was the 1980 NL Rookie of the Year, a 1981 World Series Champion and a 1982 All-Star. He played in 12 seasons and saved 328 games before a drug addiction forced him out of the game. Perry pitched six seasons in the minors, the last two with the AAA Albuquerque Dukes, and finished 28-40 with a 5.34 ERA before the Dodgers released him. This year's draft class also included pitcher Orel Hershiser from Bowling Green University, who was picked in the 17th round. He pitched 18 seasons (13 with the Dodgers), winning 204 games. He set a Major League record with a 59 consecutive scoreless inning streak in 1988 en route to winning the Cy Young Award and the World Series MVP. He was also a three-time All-Star. {| class=\"toccolours collapsible collapsed\" style=\"width:100%; background:inherit\" |- ! 1979 Draft Picks |- | ===January draft=== 1979 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB January Draft-Regular Phase {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |Robert Silicani |3B | College of San Mateo |Yes | 1979 | Rookie |- |2 |Jim Teller |OF | Sacramento City College |No Red Sox-1979 |1979\u20131982 | A |- |3 |Kyle Dunning |RHP | Linn-Benton Community College |No | | |- |4 |Joseph Siers |RHP | Palm Beach Community College |No | | |- |5 |Phillip Smith |SS | Georgia Perimeter College |No | | |- |6 |Eric Stack |RHP | Lane Community College |No | | |- |7 |James Gleissner |C | Mount San Antonio College |No Royals-1980 | 1980\u20131984 | AA |} ====January Secondary phase==== 1979 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB January Draft-Secondary Phase {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |Rick Misuraca |3B | Rose State College | Yes | 1979 | Rookie |- |2 |John Millholland |SS | Louisburg College | No Yankees-1980 | 1980\u20131981 | A |- |3 |Richard Ross |OF | San Jose City College | No | | |- |4 |Tommy Blackmon |RHP | Spartanburg Methodist College | No Indians-1980 | 19980-1984 | AA |} ===June draft=== 1979 Los Angeles Dodgers Picks in the MLB June Amateur Draft {| class=\"wikitable\" !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Round !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Name !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Position !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|School !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Signed !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Career span !style=\"background: #e3e3e3;\"|Highest level |- |1 |Steve Howe |LHP |University of Michigan |Yes |1979\u20131997 |MLB |- |1 |Steve Perry |RHP |University of Michigan |Yes |1979\u20131984 |AAA |- |2 |David Lanning |3B |University of Georgia |Yes |1979\u20131981 |AA |- |3 |Don Crow |C |Washington State University |Yes |1979\u20131982 |MLB |- |4 |Leo Mann |SS |University of Missouri |Yes |1979\u20131981 |A |- |5 |Terry Sutcliffe |RHP |University of Kansas |Yes | 1979\u20131981 |A |- |6 |Dale Holman |OF |Louisiana Tech University |Yes |1979\u20131987 |AAA |- |7 |Timothy Gloyd |SS |Pepperdine University |Yes | 1979\u20131981 | A |- |8 |Jeff Dietrich |LHP |Serramonte High School |No | | |- |9 |Felix Oroz |LHP |University of Wyoming |Yes |1979\u20131984 | AAA |- |10 |John Houston |C |John F.
