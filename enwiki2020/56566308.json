    "text": "William Aikenhead (7 May 1842 \u2013 3 April 1902) was an Australian politician, who was a member of the Tasmanian House of Assembly from 1898 until his death in office in 1902. Aikenhead was born in Launceston. His father, James Aikenhead, was the founder, editor and proprietor of The Examiner newspaper, and later became a politician on the Tasmanian Legislative Council. In 1869, James Aikenhead transferred his editorship of The Examiner to his son, where he worked for ten years.L. L. Robson, 'Aikenhead, James (1815\u20131887)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published first in hardcopy 1966, accessed online 13 February 2018. On 21 June 1898, Aikenhead stood as a candidate in a by- election for the electoral district of Devonport. He was elected, however one of the other candidates, John McCall, petitioned the Supreme Court of Tasmania that Aikenhead had engaged in bribery and \"treating by agent\"\u2014Aikenhead's representative, Archibald Phillips, had promised electors a \"go in\" if he was elected, and the night after the election plied local hotels with free beer paid for by Aikenhead. The court found against Aikenhead, and declared his election void, although they did not declare McCall elected, and instead called another by-election. Aikenhead was disqualified from running for Devonport for two years, however when the member for Latrobe, Henry Murray, resigned to contest the Devonport by-election, Aikenhead nominated for the Latrobe vacancy and was elected. Aikenhead was re-elected in the March 1900 general election, and continued to serve until his death in office on 3 April 1902. He was succeeded by Murray, who had been defeated in 1900, and returned to his old seat when elected unopposed in the by-election triggered by Aikenhead's death. ==References== ==External links== *Tasmanian Parliament profile Category:1842 births Category:1902 deaths Category:Members of the Tasmanian House of Assembly Category:Australian newspaper editors ",
