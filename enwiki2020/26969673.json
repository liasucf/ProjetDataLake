He was made II./ JG 300 Gruppenkommandeur in October 1944. Owing to his age and inexperience with modern fighters he flew most sorties as a wingman. On 28 September 1944 he claimed a B-17 over Hildesheim and a P-51 Mustang near Quedlinburg before he was shot down by P-51s and wounded, bailing out over Halberstadt.479th Fighter Group: \u2018Riddle\u2019s Raiders\u2019 (Aviation Elite Units), p. 74. Lindenberger then claimed two US B-24 four-engined bombers on 17 December 1944 during a 15th Air Force raid over Poland, (JG 300 claimed 22 B-24s downed).Luftwaffe Sturmgruppen (Aviation Elite Units), pp. 75, 106--107. He thus scored four World War II victories in total, making his lifetime tally sixteen aerial victories. ==Sources of information== ==References== * 479th Fighter Group: \u2018Riddle\u2019s Raiders\u2019 (Aviation Elite Units).
