    "text": "Horace Chandler Davis (born August 12, 1926 in Ithaca, New YorkThe Nightmare by Chan Davis: About the author) is an American-Canadian mathematician, writer, and educator. He was born in Ithaca, New York, to parents Horace B. Davis and Marian R. Davis. In 1948 he married Natalie Zemon Davis; they have three children. He was a member of the CPUSA and he was dismissed from the University of Michigan and jailed for his beliefs. He moved to Canada in 1962 and began teaching at the University of Toronto. A lecture in honour of his stand for his beliefs is now held at the university that dismissed him. ==Mathematics== In 1950 he received a doctorate in mathematics from Harvard University. His principal research investigations involve linear algebra and operator theory in Hilbert space. Furthermore, he has made contributions to numerical analysis, geometry, and algebraic logic. He is one of the eponyms of the Davis\u2013Kahan theorem and Bhatia\u2013Davis inequality (along with Rajendra Bhatia). The Davis\u2013Kahan\u2013Weinberger dilation theoremChandler Davis, W. M. Kahan, and H. F. Weinberger Norm-Preserving Dilations and Their Applications to Optimal Error Bounds, SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 19-3 (1982), pp. 445\u2013469. is one of the landmark results in the dilation theory of Hilbert space operators and has found applications in many different areas. A PhD thesis titled \"Backward Perturbation and Sensitivity Analysis of Structured Polynomial Eigenvalue Problem\" B. Adhikari, Backward Perturbation and Sensitivity Analysis of Structured Polynomial Eigenvalue Problems, Ph.D. thesis, Department of Mathematics, IIT Guwahati, Guwahati, India, 2008. is dedicated to this theorem. Davis has written around eighty research papers in mathematics. Davis was a professor in the mathematics department of University of Michigan, working alongside Wilfred Kaplan. He is currently one of the co-Editors-in- Chief of the Mathematical Intelligencer. In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society, retrieved 2012-11-10. He is part of the 2019 class of fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics. ==Fiction writing== He began his writing career in Astounding Science Fiction in 1946. From 1946 through 1962 he produced a spate of science fiction stories, mostly published there. One of the earliest, published May 1946, was The Nightmare, later the lead story in A Treasury of Science Fiction, edited by Groff Conklin; it argued for a national policy of decentralizing industry to evade nuclear attacks by terrorists. He also issued the fanzine \"Blitherings\" in the 1940s. He attended Torcon I, the 6th World Science Fiction Convention in 1948, appeared at the 2010 SFContario science fiction convention,\"Chandler Davis in Fannish Conversation\". SFContario 2010 Panel Descriptions and was Science Guest of Honor at the 2013 SFContario science fiction convention.\"Upcoming Events\". Analog Science Fiction and Fact ==Politics== Davis in 1975. Davis came from a radical family and has identified himself as a socialist and former member of the Communist Party of America.Share1163 Hedges, Chris. \"The Origin of America\u2019s Intellectual Vacuum\" Truth-Out.org November 15, 2010 \"It wasn\u2019t a cinch I would be in the Communist Party, but in fact I was, starting in 1943 and then resigning soon after on instructions from the party because I was in the military service. This was part of the coexistence of the Communist Party with Roosevelt and the military. It would not disrupt things during the war. When I got out of the Navy I rejoined the Communist Party, but that lapsed in June of 1953. I never got back in touch with them. At the time I was subpoenaed I was technically an ex-Communist, but I did not feel I had left the movement and in some sense I never did.\" Davis--along with two other professors, Mark Nickerson and Clement Markert--refused to cooperate with the House Unamerican Activities Committee and was subsequently dismissed from the University of Michigan. Davis was then sentenced to a six-month prison term where he was able to do some research. A paper from this era has the following acknowledgement: > Research supported in part by the Federal Prison System. Opinions expressed > in this paper are the author's and are not necessarily those of the Bureau > of Prisons.Page 181 in . Excerpt in Google Books. The Federal government released Davis from prison in 1960.\"Shooting Rats in a Barrel\": Did the Red-hunt Win? After his release, Davis moved to Canada, where he currently resides. In 1991, the University of Michigan Senate initiated the annual Davis, Markert, Nickerson Lecture on Academic and Intellectual Freedom. Recent speakers have included: Cass Sunstein (2008), Nadine Strossen (2007), Bill Keller (2006), Floyd Abrams (2005), and Noam Chomsky (2004). ==Notes== ==External links== *Biography at the University of Regina's Department of Mathematics & Statistics * *Davis, Markert, Nickerson Lecture Series on Academic and Intellectual Freedom * * Victim of McCarthy-Era Witch Hunt calls on U-Illinois not to Fire Critic of Israeli Policies Category:1926 births Category:Living people Category:Harvard University alumni Category:University of Toronto faculty Category:Canadian mathematicians Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society Category:Fellows of the Association for Women in Mathematics Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars Category:American science fiction writers Category:American short story writers Category:Canadian science fiction writers Category:20th-century mathematicians Category:Canadian socialists Category:American socialists Category:American male short story writers Category:American male novelists Category:University of Michigan faculty Category:20th-century short story writers Category:20th-century male writers Category:Novelists from Michigan Category:Michigan socialists Category:New York (state) socialists ",
