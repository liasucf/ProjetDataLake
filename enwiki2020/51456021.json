Syrians in Denmark arrived primarily as asylum seekers after the Syrian civil war. According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2017, there are a total 40,477 persons of Syrian origin living in Denmark. Of those individuals, 35,262 are Syria-born immigrants and 5,215 are descendants of Syria-born persons. 33,283 individuals are citizens of Syria (18,726 men, 14,557 women).

This is because many arrived via family reunification or as refugees, and such immigrants usually settle in government-owned properties. Syrians primarily inhabit the regions of Syddanmark (11,345), Midtjylland (10,837), Hovedstaden (7,349), Sj\u00e6lland (6,901), and Nordjylland (4,045), and the cities of Aarhus (1,910), Copenhagen (1,471), Odense (1,161), and Vejle (1,068). According to Statistics Denmark, as of 2016, male immigrants from Syria aged 20-59 have an annual income of just over 150,000 Danish krone before taxation. Most of that income comprises public transfers, with the remainder consisting of earned income, investment income and second income.

The crime index when adjusted for age only is 302 for traffic law (with adjustments of 315 for age and socioeconomic status, 259 for age and family education, and 274 for age and family income) and 315 for special laws (with adjustments of 297 for age and socioeconomic status, 249 age and family education, and 241 for age and family income). The average crime index among the general Danish population is set at 100 and percentage points above or below that baseline reflect greater or lesser prevalence, depending on a population's most common age group and its relative socioeconomic status. As of 2016, a total of 1,033 persons of Syrian origin were found guilty of crimes. Of these individuals, 923 were males and 110 were females, with males between the ages of 15-29 years (465 individuals) and 30-49 years (407 individuals) constituting most of the total.
