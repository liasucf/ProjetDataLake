    "text": "Wrexham County Borough () is a local government principal area centred on the town of Wrexham in northeast Wales. The county borough has a population of nearly 135,000 inhabitants. Around 63,000 of these live either within the town of Wrexham or in the surrounding conurbation of urban villages and its only urban town, Chirk. The remainder live to the south and east of the town in more rural areas, including the borough's large salient in the Ceiriog Valley. The area has strong links with coal-mining. The county borough was formed on 1 April 1996. Borough status was inherited from the town of Wrexham, granted over 150 years ago. Most of the area was previously part of the district of Wrexham Maelor \u2013 with several communities coming from Glynd\u0175r \u2013 in the county of Clwyd. The area includes a portion of the eastern half of the historic county of Denbighshire and two exclaves of historic Flintshire: English Maelor and the parish of Marford and Hoseley. ==Government== The region is governed as a unitary authority by Wrexham County Borough Council. Most offices of the council are situated within Wrexham town centre, around Llwyn Isaf and the Civic Centre around Chester Street. The headquarters of the organisation is at the Guildhall, Queens Square. ===Senedd members=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! Constituency !

The first twinning was established on 17 March 1970 between the former Kreis Iserlohn and Wrexham Rural District. Its early success ensured that, after local government reorganisation in both countries in the mid-seventies, the twinning was taken over by the new councils of M\u00e4rkischer Kreis and Wrexham Maelor Borough Council and, in 1996, by Wrexham County Borough Council. In 2001 M\u00e4rkischer Kreis entered a twinning arrangement with Racib\u00f3rz, a county in Poland, which was formerly part of Silesia, Germany. In September 2002, a delegation from Racib\u00f3rz visited Wrexham and began discussions about co-operation which led to the signing of Articles of Twinning between Wrexham and Racib\u00f3rz in March 2004. The Wrexham area has strong historical links with Poland. Following World War II, many service personnel from the Free Polish armed forces who had been injured received treatment at Penley Polish Hospital. Many of their descendants remain in the area. == Gallery == File:St Giles' Church, Wrexham (geograph 4885639 cropped).jpg|St Giles' Parish Church, Wrexham File:Under Pontcysyllte.jpg|Pontycysyllte Aqueduct - A UNESCO World Heritage Site File:Erddig Hall (14513467238).jpg|Erddig Hall, Wrexham File:Glynceiriogvillageview.jpg|thumb|Glyn Ceiriog File:Pont Rhedynfre - Holt or Farndon Bridge, Holt, Wrexham, Wales 16.jpg|Farndon-Holt Bridge, Holt File:StiwtTheatreRhosllannerchrugog.jpg|Stiwt Theatre, Rhosllannerchrugog File:Chirk Castle - Adam Tower.jpg|Chirk Castle, Chirk ==See also== *List of places in Wrexham County Borough for a list of towns and villages == External links == * Council website * *Electoral Arrangements Order 1998 \u2013 description of Wards *Wrexham Council Ward Map *Wrexham.com Website *NHS Review of substance misuse including Ward Deprivation Map and detailed population/age group figures (PDF Viewer Required) Category:Principal areas of Wales Category:County boroughs of Wales ",
