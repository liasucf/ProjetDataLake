    "text": "\"Volcano\" is a song performed by American popular music singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett. It was written by Jimmy Buffett, Keith Sykes, and Harry Dailey and released as a single (b/w \"Stranded on a Sandbar\") on MCA 41161 in November 1979. Written in a calypso/reggae style, the song was first released on his 1979 album Volcano and reached No. 66 on the Billboard Hot 100, as well as peaking at No. 43 on the Easy Listening chart. The song and album are named for the then-dormant Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat in the British West Indies where Buffett recorded the album in May 1979 at AIR Studios. The studio was destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and Soufri\u00e8re Hills erupted again in 1995. The lyrics describe the narrator's anxiety about his possible whereabouts following the impending eruption of a volcano. The bridge before the final chorus mentions a number of placenames, some important largely in the context of 1979: \"Volcano\" is one of Buffett's more popular songs with fans, and is part of \"The Big 8\" that he has played at almost all of his concerts. Recorded live versions of the song appear on Feeding Frenzy, Buffett Live: Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and the video Live by the Bay. The placenames in the final bridge are often altered in concert to reflect more recent news. The song was also re-recorded and released for Rock Band on June 3, 2008, with the last two lines listed above changed to, \"I want to be a couch potato / Just play Rock Band everyday.\" Volcano was recorded at AIR Studios in Montserrat and was played at the London benefit concert \"Music for Montserrat\", arranged by Sir George Martin to support the island after the twin disasters of hurricane Hugo and the eruptions of the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano. The lyrics were changed to fit the context. For example, the phrase \"We've got to help our friends in Montserrat\" appeared in the song. When performed at concerts, a video of the song on Rock Band is shown. ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !align=\"left\"|Chart (1979) ! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Peak position |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot 100 | style=\"text- align:center;\"|66 |- |align=\"left\"|U.S. Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|43 |- |align=\"left\"|Canadian RPM Adult Contemporary Tracks | style=\"text-align:center;\"|1 |} ==References== ==External links== *Volcano by Jimmy Buffett, Keith Sykes, and Harry Dailey * Category:1979 singles Category:Jimmy Buffett songs Category:RPM Adult Contemporary number-one singles Category:Songs written by Jimmy Buffett Category:MCA Records singles ",
