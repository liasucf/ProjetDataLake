    "text": "\"La Lorraine est fran\u00e7aise!\" Propaganda image advocating the return of Alsace- Lorraine to FranceThe Cross of Lorraine (), known as Cross of Anjou in the 16th century, is a heraldic two-barred cross, consisting of a vertical line crossed by two shorter horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are \"graded\" with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen. The Lorraine name has come to signify several cross variations, including the patriarchal cross with its bars near the top. == Design == The Cross of Lorraine consists of one vertical and two horizontal bars. In most renditions, the horizontal bars are \"graded\" with the upper bar being the shorter, though variations with the bars of equal length are also seen. == History == The Cross of Lorraine came from the Kingdom of Hungary to the Duchy of Lorraine. In Hungary, B\u00e9la III was the first monarch to use the two-barred cross as the symbol of royal power in the late 12th century. He probably adopted it from the Byzantine Empire, according to historian P\u00e1l Engel. Ren\u00e9 II, Duke of Lorraine inherited the two-barred cross as a symbol from his distant ancestors from the House of Anjou of Hungary. They inherited it as kings of Hungary from the country's first ruling dynasty, the \u00c1rp\u00e1ds. Ren\u00e9's grandfather, Ren\u00e9 the Good, who used it as his personal sigil, laid claim to four kingdoms, including Hungary. The cross was still known as the \"cross of Anjou\" in the . Ren\u00e9 II placed the symbol on his flag before the Battle of Nancy in January 1477. In the battle, Ren\u00e9 defeated the army of Charles the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, who had occupied the Duchy of Lorraine, and regained his duchy. All coins struck for Ren\u00e9 bore the symbol thereafter. The \"Free French Forces\" resistance flag and alt= == Symbol of France == The flag of Free France is a regular alt= The Cross of Lorraine is an emblem of Lorraine in eastern France. Between 1871 and 1918 (and again between 1940 and 1944), the north-eastern quarter of Lorraine (the Moselle department) was annexed to Germany, along with Alsace. During that period the Cross served as a rallying point for French ambitions to recover its lost provinces. This historical significance lent it considerable weight as a symbol of French patriotism. During World War II, Capitaine de corvette Thierry d'Argenlieu suggested the Cross of Lorraine as the symbol of the Free French Forces led by Charles de Gaulle as an answer to the Nazi swastika. In France, the Cross of Lorraine was the symbol of Free France during World War II, the liberation of France from Nazi Germany, and Gaullism and includes several variations of a two-barred cross. The Cross was displayed on the flags of Free French warships, and the fuselages of Free French aircraft. The medal of the Order of Liberation bears the Cross of Lorraine. De Gaulle himself is memorialised by a high Cross of Lorraine in his home village of Colombey-les- Deux-\u00c9glises. The Cross of Lorraine was later adopted by Gaullist political groups such as the Rally for the Republic. === New World === French Jesuit missionaries and settlers to the New World carried the Cross of Lorraine c. 1750\u20131810. The symbol was said to have helped the missionaries to convert the native peoples they encountered, because the two-armed cross resembled existing local imagery.Charlotte Gray 'The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder' Random House, 2004 == European heraldry == The coat of arms of Hungary depicts a double cross, which is often attributed to Byzantine influence as King B\u00e9la III of Hungary was raised in the Byzantine Empire in the 12th century, and it was during his rule when the double cross became a symbol of Hungary. Also the 'dual cross' is the consonant 'gy' in ancient Hungarian runic writing which reads \"egy\" (one) when it stands alone mostly, if not always, with \"God\" meaning. A golden double cross with equal bars, known as the Cross of Jagiellons, was used by Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland Jogaila since his conversion to Christianity in 1386, as a personal insignia and was introduced in the coat of arms of Lithuania. Initially, the lower bar of the cross was longer than the upper, since it originates from the Hungarian type of the double cross. It later became the symbol of Jagiellonian dynasty and is one of the national symbols of Lithuania, featured in the Order of the Cross of Vytis and the badge of the Lithuanian Air Force. The double- barred cross is one of the national symbols in Belarus, both as the Jagiellon Cross and as the Cross of St. Euphrosyne of Polatsk, an important religious artifact. The symbol is supposed to have Byzantine roots and is used by the Belarusian Greek Catholic Church as a symbol uniting Eastern-Byzantine and Western-Latin church traditions. The Belarusian Cross can be found on the traditional coat of arms of Belarus, the Pahonia. Silver double cross, on a mountain with three peaks, forms the coat of arms of the Slovak Republic. It is considered national symbol of Slovaks, and its history in present territory can be traced back to Great Moravia in 9th century.

The cross of Lorraine was previously used in the Sabre, Apollo, and Worldspan global distribution systems (GDS) as a delimiter in various input formats, however, the latest version of the graphical user interface for each system uses a different symbol: Apollo displays it as a plus sign, Worldspan as a number sign, and Sabre as a yen symbol. == Miscellaneous appearances == For its defense of France in World War I, the American 79th Infantry Division was nicknamed the \"Cross of Lorraine\" Division; its insignia is the cross. The German 79th Infantry Division of World War II used the cross of Lorraine as its insignia because its first attack was in the Lorraine region. The insignia was redesignated effective December 1, 2009, for the 79th US Army Reserve Sustainment Support Command in Los Alamitos, California. The cross is used as an emblem by the American Lung Association and related organizations through the world, and as such is familiar from their Christmas seals program. Its use was suggested in 1902 by Paris physician Gilbert Sersiron as a symbol for the \"crusade\" against tuberculosis. The cross was used in the TV show Magnum P.I. as the emblem on the ring worn by the members of Magnum's Vietnam War team who were the co-stars on the show. It was prominent in the 1st season's title sequence/intro. The Scottish indie rock band Frightened Rabbit have used it as a symbol, notably on some merchandise and their album The Winter of Mixed Drinks, before switching to a three-barred papal cross for their EP State Hospital and their consecutive album Pedestrian Verse. It is a standard pattern for horse racing colours in the UK. American rock musician Marilyn Manson released several \"cryptic\" videos that featured the Cross of Lorraine. The videos were posted to Manson's Instagram account in a series of five posts beginning on February 11, 2017. ==Gallery== File:Croix de Lorraine Colombey (2).JPG|Monument to Charles de Gaulle in Colombey-les-Deux-\u00c9glises File:P\u00e8re- Lachaise - Division 69 - Mouchotte 01.jpg|Tomb of fighter pilot Ren\u00e9 Mouchotte at P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery File:Angers cathedrale.jpg|The cross of Lorraine atop Saint Maurice Cathedral in Angers, Maine-et-Loire, France, File:Croix de Lorraine Sentier des 25 Bosses.jpg|Monument to the French Resistance, in the Forest of Three Pines, Fontainebleau, Seine-et-Marne File:Tape-rubis.jpg|The tampion of the features the Cross of Lorraine in honour of the Free French submarine .
