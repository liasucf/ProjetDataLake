    "text": "The Amazing Race 13 is the thirteenth installment of the American reality television show The Amazing Race. This season featured 11 teams of two, with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world. The 13th season was part of the fall lineup for the 2008\u201309 season. It aired Sunday nights at 8:00 p.m. ET/PT from September 28, 2008 until the season finale on December 7, 2008. Siblings Nicholas \"Nick\" and Emily \"Starr\" Spangler were the winners of this Race. Excluding the Family Edition of Season 8, \"Starr\" remains the youngest person ever to win The Amazing Race, at age 21. ==Production== ===Development and filming=== The Race's Starting Line was at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum in the neighborhood of University Park in Los Angeles. The Amazing Race 13 spanned in 23 days and visited eight different countries. This included the series' first visits to Bolivia, Cambodia, and Kazakhstan, and return visits to Brazil, New Zealand, India, and Russia, with the Finish Line in Portland, Oregon. CBS had originally planned to only air one installment of The Amazing Race (Season 12) in the 2007\u201308 season, but due to the 2007\u20132008 Writers Guild of America strike, CBS ordered a 13th installment as a replacement for programs affected by the strike. CBS greenlit the 13th installment on December 9, 2007. Race locations were scouted in January 2008 and filming took place between April and May 2008. This is the second season with a course that circumnavigated the world westward (The Amazing Race 10 was the first and would be followed by later seasons). The show also featured John Keoghan, the father of host Phil Keoghan, as the local greeter at Te Puke in Keoghan's native New Zealand. This was the first season in which an eliminated team was absent from the Finish Line, where teams normally cheer on the finalists, as Dallas Imbimbo (of Toni & Dallas) had misplaced his passport and the team's money in Russia on the penultimate leg. This had been hinted at in promotional materials aired before the Race began, where CBS revealed that one team made \"an unprecedented mistake that ultimately prohibit[ed] them from joining their fellow Racers at the Finish Line.\" In a post-race interview, Dallas revealed that the loss of the passport and money was partly caused by the changing of a microphone battery by production. The passport was eventually turned in at the U.S. Embassy in Russia, but it was still too late for Dallas and his mother to join their fellow racers at the Finish Line. Emily \"Starr\" Spangler revealed in a post-race interview that Toni and Dallas joined the other racers in Portland, Oregon at a party the night following the end of the Race. Andrew Lappitt and Daniel \"Dan\" Honig (of Andrew & Dan) stated in a post-show interview that the second U-Turn was available on Leg 9 but it was not used by any teams, thus it was not aired in the show. This was the first season in which racers did not use an available U-Turn (a Race feature introduced in the previous season). In addition, while the editing of the finale strongly suggested that Andrew & Dan were so far behind that they were simply sent directly to the Finish Line after Nick & Starr won the Race, it was later confirmed that they did finish the tasks on the leg before arriving 3rd, coming in around 20 minutes after Ken & Tina finished 2nd. ===Cast=== Applications for The Amazing Race 13 were due on November 27, 2007. Semi-finalist interviews were held in December 2007 and January 2008 and final casting interviews took place in February 2008, in Los Angeles. The cast featured a team of fraternity brothers, married hippies, southern belles, businesswomen divorcees, and a retired NFL player hoping to reconnect with his estranged wife. Winners Nick & Starr became the first team to win seven legs during a single season. Emily \"Starr\" Spangler was a Dallas Cowboys cheerleader prior to the Race, while Nicholas \"Nick\" Spangler opened on Broadway in the musical The Book of Mormon in 2010. Post-show interviews revealed that Emily \"Starr\" Spangler and Dallas Imbimbo, who competed on opposing teams, had been long-distance dating for six months, since the show completed taping. The two eventually ended their relationship due to long distance. ====Future appearances==== This cast was not represented in The Amazing Race: Unfinished Business or the second All-Stars edition. Terence Gerchberg and Andrew Lappitt later attended the public start of Season 25. ===Marketing=== CBS heavily promoted the new season, including placing advertising on the top of three hangar buildings at Los Angeles International Airport prior to the premiere. Unlike other seasons, CBS revealed a location map of where the Race would be traveling prior to the start of the season. ==Results== The following teams participated in the season, each listed along with their placements in each leg and relationships as identified by the program. Note that this table is not necessarily reflective of all content broadcast on television, owing to the inclusion or exclusion of some data. Placements are listed in finishing order: {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !rowspan=2|Team !rowspan=2|Relationship !colspan=11|Position (by leg) !rowspan=2|Roadblocks performed |- !1 !2 !3 !4 !5 !6 !7 !8 !9 !10 !11 |- !Nick & Starr |Siblings |1st |6th |6th |5th |1st |1st |1st |1st |3rd |1st |1st |Nick 5, Starr 3 |- !Ken & Tina |Separated |2nd |1st |1st |1st |3rd | |4th |3rd |2nd |3rd |2nd |Ken 4, Tina 4 |- !Andrew & Dan |Frat Boys |7th |8th |7th |6th |6th |5th |5th |4th | |2nd |3rd |Andrew 6, Dan 3 |- !Toni & Dallas |Mother/Son |6th |5th |2nd |4th |2nd |3rd |2nd |2nd |1st | | style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Toni 4, Dallas 5 |- !Terence & Sarah |Newly Dating |3rd |3rd |3rd |2nd |5th |4th |3rd | | colspan=\"3\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Terence 3, Sarah 4 |- !Kelly & Christy |Divorcees |5th |7th |8th |3rd |4th |2nd | | colspan=\"4\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Kelly 3, Christy 3 |- !Aja & Ty |Dating Long Distance |8th |4th |5th |7th | | colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Aja 2, Ty 2 |- !Marisa & Brooke |Southern Belles |10th |9th |4th | | colspan=\"7\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Marisa 2, Brooke 1 |- !Mark & Bill |Best Friends |4th |2nd | | colspan=\"8\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Mark 1, Bill 1 |- !Anthony & Stephanie |Dating |9th | | colspan=\"9\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Anthony 1, Stephanie 0 |- !Anita & Arthur |Married Beekeepers | | colspan=\"10\" style=\"background:darkgrey;\"| |Anita 0, Arthur 0 |} *A team placement indicates that the team was eliminated. *A indicates that the team won a Fast forward clue. *An team's placement indicates that the team came in last on a non-elimination leg and had to perform a Speed Bump task in the following leg. *A means the team chose to use a U-Turn; indicates the team who received it; around a leg number indicates a leg where the U-Turn was available but not used. # Mark & Bill initially arrived 8th, but were issued a 30-minute penalty for taking a taxi instead of going on foot to the Bumpy Ride Detour as the clue specifically instructed. Kelly & Christy checked-in during their penalty time, dropping Mark & Bill to last place and resulting in their elimination. # Terence & Sarah initially arrived 3rd, but were issued a 30-minute penalty for speeding. They served their penalty at the start of the next leg, therefore departing at the Pit Start 5th. # Andrew & Dan initially arrived 4th, but took a taxi to the Pit Stop instead of going on foot as stated on the clue. They were required to go back to the end of the Detour and walk back to the Pit Stop to correct the mistakes. This did not affect their placement. # Ken & Tina initially arrived 3rd, but they had missed the clue directing them to the Pit Stop, having arrived there by chance while searching for the clue. They were required to retrieve the missed clue at the end of the Detour and return to the Pit Stop. This did not affect their placement. # Toni & Dallas were initially denied their clue at the Detour starting point, as they had taken the Metro instead of a taxi, and the lady with a Shetland Pony required them to go back to the end of the Roadblock and return to the Detour starting point via taxi. Later, when all the other teams had checked-in at the Pit Stop, while Toni & Dallas were still performing the Ride the Lines Detour, Phil came to Rizhskaya Station to inform them of their elimination. ==Episode title quotes== Episode titles are often taken from quotes made by the racers. #\"Bees Are Much Calmer Than All This!\" \u2013 Anita #\"Do You Like American Candy?\" \u2013 Marisa #\"Did You Push My Sports Bra Off the Ledge?\" \u2013 Christy #\"I Wonder If They Like Blondes in New Zealand?\" \u2013 Marisa #\"Do It Like a Madman\" \u2013 Dan #\"Please Hold While I Singe My Skull\" \u2013 Christy #\"My Nose Is on Fire\" \u2013 Sarah #\"I'm Like an Angry Cow\" \u2013 Terence #\"That Is Studly\" \u2013 Andrew #\"You're Gonna Get Me Killed\" \u2013 Tina #\"You Look Like Peter Pan\" \u2013 Starr ==Prizes== The prize for each leg was awarded to the first place team for that leg.

Subsequently, eliminated teams telephoned to inform the teams at the villa of their elimination, but continued to run the Race as decoys to throw off spoilers to the final outcome of the Race. The sequestered teams met up with the decoy teams in the final destination city, to cheer the final three teams at the Finish Line. (The exception was Toni & Dallas, who were stuck in Russia after their elimination due to the loss of Dallas' passport.) CBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the Pacific Time Zone to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa. *After Leg 1, Anita & Arthur were the first team eliminated and sent to the villa. They expressed their disappointment for being eliminated so early but were also appreciative of their surroundings. *After Leg 2, Anthony & Stephanie were the second team eliminated and sent to the villa. Anita and Arthur were surprised but excited that it was them, and Anthony and Stephanie felt welcomed and less depressed over their elimination. Over a meal, they predicted that Terence & Sarah would win the Race. The two teams then enjoyed the sights and sounds of Acapulco. *After Leg 3, Mark & Bill were the third team eliminated and sent to the villa. They were glad that the two teams there were shocked and saddened to hear that they were eliminated. As they retold how they were eliminated, they found Mexican wrestling masks in their room. The six were later brought, at night, to a luchadore exhibition where Anthony and Stephanie had a lack of interest and left to roam the streets instead. *After Leg 4, Marisa & Brooke were the fourth team eliminated and sent to the villa. They were excited on how lavish the villa was. They then discussed what happened in New Zealand before they all went into town and Anthony, Stephanie, and Bill did a bungee jump. *After Leg 5, Aja & Ty were the fifth team eliminated and sent to the villa. Before they arrived, the others went to the market and prepared a celebratory lunch. The teams were surprised that it was Aja & Ty, who brought news about the Race. After the meal, Anthony did not offer to help clean, leaving Stephanie embarrassed. Meanwhile, Ty felt awkward and predicted that Andrew & Dan would be the next team eliminated. *Leg 6 was a non-elimination leg. The five eliminated teams went to the beach where they encountered a weird individual who staged a \"performance\" for the teams in the ocean. There were mixed reactions from the teams with Anita being thrilled and filled with admiration while Ty was having difficulty understanding the different lifestyle of the people in Mexico. *After Leg 7, Kelly & Christy were the sixth team eliminated. They called the villa during the early hours in Acapulco, and recalled their horrifying \"Holi Festival\" Roadblock experience and gave them an update on the Race. *After Leg 8, Terence & Sarah were the seventh team eliminated. Before their phone call, the eliminated teams went to La Quebrada to watch cliff divers. After that, they gave opinions on who would be eliminated next. Most of them thought it would be Andrew & Dan. They were all shocked when Terence & Sarah called, as several were rooting for them. *Leg 9 was a non-elimination leg. While Aja & Ty had a minor tiff with each other, Marisa & Brooke struggled to make toast. Anthony started complaining about how slow time is passing in the villa. All in all, most of the sequestered teams reveal that they are missing home and are eager to return to their normal lives. Most of them wanted to see either Toni & Dallas or Ken & Tina win the Race. *After Leg 10, Toni & Dallas were the eighth and final team to be eliminated. The first five eliminated teams packed-up to head for the finish line location. As they packed to leave the villa, each team recalled their experience with each other at the villa and expressed their excitement for returning home. *Leg 11 was the final leg of The Amazing Race 13. The five sequestered teams arrived in Portland, Oregon, where they checked into a hotel and were reunited with Terence and Sarah. Toni and Dallas then called the six teams at the hotel, breaking the news that they had been eliminated and would most likely not be joining them at the finish line due to their passport mishap. The teams then went to the finish line, where they reunited with Kelly and Christy, and some of the teams again expressed who they wanted to win. Nick & Starr express their joy and disbelief at winning the Race, while Ken & Tina express their disappointment but vow to make their marriage work. Andrew & Dan express their elation at making it to third place. ==Race summary== The route of the Race (at the time of the filming) ===Leg 1 (United States \u2192 Brazil)=== Historic Center district of Salvador, teams visited the Elevador Lacerda (left) for one side of Detour task and the Forte de S\u00e3o Marcelo (center right) for the Pit Stop.
