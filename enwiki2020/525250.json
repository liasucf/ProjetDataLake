    "text": "Robert Smigel (born February 7, 1960) is an American actor, voice actor, comedian, humorist, writer, director, producer, and puppeteer, known for his Saturday Night Live \"TV Funhouse\" cartoon shorts and as the puppeteer and voice behind Triumph the Insult Comic Dog. He also co-wrote the Hotel Transylvania films and You Don't Mess with the Zohan, both starring Adam Sandler. ==Early life== Smigel was born in New York City, to Lucia and Irwin Smigel, an aesthetic dentist, innovator and philanthropist. He is Jewish and frequently went to Jewish summer camp. He attended Cornell University, studying pre-dental, and graduated from New York University in 1983 with a degree in political science. Smigel began developing his comedic talent at The Players Workshop in Chicago, where he studied improvisation with Josephine Forsberg. Bob Odenkirk was a fellow student there. Smigel was also a member of the Chicago comedy troupe \"All You Can Eat\" in the early 1980s. ==Career== Smigel first established himself as a writer on Saturday Night Live by joining the writing staff when Lorne Michaels returned as executive producer for the 1985\u20131986 season. Smigel was hired after then-SNL producers Al Franken and Tom Davis saw Smigel in a Chicago sketch show. After the 1985\u20131986 season proved to be a disappointment with critics, in the ratings, and with Brandon Tartikoff (who was planning to have SNL canceled by the last episode of season 11 due to its sliding ratings), Michaels fired most of the cast and writers, retained the cast and writers who were standouts during the otherwise dismal season (Smigel being one of them), and hired new ones for the 1986\u20131987 season. This is when Smigel began to write more memorable sketches, including one where host William Shatner urged worshipful attendees at a Star Trek convention to \"get a life.\" Smigel rarely appeared on screen, though he was credited as a featured player in the early 1990s and played a recurring character in the Bill Swerski's Superfans sketches. While on a writers' strike from Saturday Night Live following the 1987\u201388 season, Smigel wrote for an improvisational comedy revue in Chicago with fellow SNL writers Bob Odenkirk and Conan O'Brien called Happy Happy Good Show. Smigel co-wrote Lookwell with Conan O'Brien for NBC. The pilot never went to series, but it has become a cult hit and has screened live at \"The Other Network\", a festival of un-aired TV pilots produced by Un-Cabaret, featuring live and taped intros by Smigel. Smigel later became the first head writer at Late Night with Conan O'Brien, where he created numerous successful comedy bits, including one where Smigel performed only the lips of public figures which were superimposed on photos of the actual people. (This technique was pioneered on the Clutch Cargo cartoon series as a cost-saving measure, and was known as Syncro-Vox.) In 1996, Smigel wrote and performed on the short-lived Dana Carvey Show, a primetime sketch comedy program on ABC. Despite its premature end, the show provided Smigel the opportunity to debut his first cartoon, The Ambiguously Gay Duo. Upon the show's cancellation, Smigel continued developing more cartoon ideas the following summer and would begin airing them on Saturday Night Live under the TV Funhouse banner. Smigel would later claim, \"My whole career came out of the impulse to do cartoons on The Dana Carvey Show.\"Heisler, Steve Interview \u2013 Dana Carvey and Robert Smigel The A.V. Club (June 15, 2009). Retrieved on 5-09-10. Robert Smigel performing Triumph the Insult Comic Dog Smigel's most famous creation, however, would be the foul-mouthed puppet Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who mercilessly mocks celebrities and others in the style of a Borscht Belt comedian. This character debuted on Late Night with Conan O'Brien in February 1997 and would continue to make appearances on the show, as well as others, for many years to come. Smigel continued to establish himself on Saturday Night Live by producing short animated segments under the title TV Funhouse, which usually satirizes public figures and popular culture. It spawned a TV show on Comedy Central featuring a mix of puppets, animation, and short sketches, although only eight episodes were aired (during the winter of 2000\u20132001). Smigel occasionally appears in films (usually alongside SNL veterans such as Adam Sandler). According to interviews, Smigel helped punch up the scripts for Little Nicky and The Wedding Singer. Smigel acted alongside fellow SNL writer Bob Odenkirk in Wayne's World 2 as a nerd backstage at an Aerosmith concert. His contributions were uncredited. In 2000, he voiced a sage bulldog in Little Nicky. Smigel, along with Adam Sandler and Judd Apatow, wrote the script for the film You Don't Mess with the Zohan in which Smigel played Yosi, an Israeli electronics salesman. Smigel is also one of the executive producers of the film, which is a first for him despite his frequent collaborations with Sandler. It was reported in 2006 that Smigel and Adam Sandler were working on an animated sitcom for Fox called Animals. Fox has not made any official statement regarding the show. Additionally, Smigel played a gay mailman in the Adam Sandler film I Now Pronounce You Chuck and Larry and Yari the Mechanic in the \"Mister Softee\" episode of Curb Your Enthusiasm. He voiced Ray and a parody of the Star Wars character, Emperor Palpatine, in the first episode of Robot Chicken Star Wars, as well as the monster 100 in the episode of the same name of Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Currently living in New York, he co-wrote and co-executive produced the films Hotel Transylvania (2012) and Hotel Transylvania 2 (2015), in which he voiced Marty, a fake version of Dracula, and Harry Three-Eye, respectively. In the fifth season of the FX show, Louie, Smigel received a story credit on the episode \"Cop Story\", as a similar incident as to what appears in the show actually happened to him, down to the cop crying in his apartment while Smigel went out, found the missing gun and carried it home, terrified that anyone would notice. Michael Rapaport's character wasn't based on the man Smigel knew, however, since all Smigel ever told Louis C.K. about was the gun itself. Smigel created, wrote, executive produced, and starred as Triumph the Insult Comic Dog in The Jack and Triumph Show, alongside Jack McBrayer in 2015. It was announced in January 2016 that Smigel would be starring as Triumph in Triumph's Election Special 2016 on Hulu the following February. In September 2020, after being brought on to develop the project in 2019, Fox announced that Smigel would executive produce Let's Be Real \u2014 a one-off adaptation of the French satirical series Les Guignols. ==Personal life== Smigel has a wife, Michelle, and three children. Michelle and Robert serve on the board of New York Collaborates for Autism as their eldest child has autism. They are active members of (NYCA), a non-profit organization founded in 2003 to address the needs of individuals and families who are living with autism. Smigel created the Night of too Many Stars, a biannual celebrity fundraiser to benefit autism education. He won an Emmy on the 2012 broadcast of Night of Too Many Stars for his writing. ==Recurring characters on SNL== *Carl Wollarski, from \"Bill Swerski's Superfans\" *Hank Fielding, with \"The Moron's Perspective\" on Weekend Update *One of the Hub's Gyros employees (aka the \"You like-ah the Juice?\" guys) *Avi, the \"Sabra Price is Right\" announcer *Bighead, in \"The Ambiguously Gay Duo\" cartoons ==Celebrity impressions== *Alan Dershowitz (on SNL) *Woody Allen (on SNL) *Al Sharpton (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Al Franken (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *William Ginsburg (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Don McLean (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Lorne Michaels (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Pat Robertson (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Michael Gross (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Thomas Mesereau (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Sinbad (on SNL TV Funhouse cartoon) *Bob Dole (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Gene Shalit (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Joel Siegel (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Bob Ross (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Rip Torn (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Bill Walton (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Richard Nixon (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Sam Donaldson (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Hussein of Jordan (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Quentin Tarantino (on The Dana Carvey Show) *Ringo Starr (on The Dana Carvey Show) ==Recurring characters on Late Night with Conan O'Brien== *Triumph the Insult Comic Dog *\"Clutch Cargo\" celebrity interviews (Bill Clinton, George W.
