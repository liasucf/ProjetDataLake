After graduating from Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, he became a teacher at a military school and at the Tuscan Technical Institute, where one of his pupils was Vito Volterra.https://php.math.unifi.it/archimede/matematicaitaliana/biografie/tricomi/tricomi2.html Over his career, he carried out research both in geometry and algebra. He wrote many works, among which the most prominent is probably Introduzione storica alla teoria delle funzioni ellittiche (Historical Introduction to Elliptic Function Theory), which became well known and was used worldwide. He also wrote many university textbooks. The library of the Fondazione Scienza e Tecnica in Florence has named after him its precious collection of math books and works. == References == == Bibliography == * * * * * * * * * == External links == * Digitized version of Introduzione storica alla teoria delle funzioni ellittiche (Cornell University \u2013 Historical library) * Fondazione Scienza e Tecnica di Firenze Category:1838 births Category:1924 deaths Category:People from Altamura Category:Italian mathematicians ",
