    "text": "Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 P\u00e9rez (born April 7, 1979) is a Dominican former professional baseball third baseman. Originally signed as an amateur free agent, he made his Major League Baseball (MLB) debut with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1998 at age 19. He subsequently played for the Seattle Mariners, Boston Red Sox, and Texas Rangers. He batted and threw right-handed. He became one of the most all-around accomplished players in history; he ranks 13th in defensive Wins Above Replacement and was the fourth third baseman to reach 400 home runs and 1,500 runs batted in. Beltr\u00e9 was a four-time selection for the Silver Slugger Award and MLB All-Star Game, and a five-time winner of the Rawlings Gold Glove Award. The fifth major leaguer to hit at least 100 home runs for three teams, he hit at least 20 home runs in 12 seasons, and in five, drove in at least 100 runs. He hit a major league-leading 48 home runs while playing for the Dodgers in 2004, was the team MVP of the Red Sox in 2010, and tied for the major league lead in hits in 2013 while playing for the Rangers. Sharing the record as one of four major leaguers to hit for the cycle three times, Beltr\u00e9 was the only one to hit three at the same stadium, Globe Life Park in Arlington. He was the sixth player with a three-home-run game in both the regular season and postseason, and the second with both a three-home-run game and cycle in the same week. On July 30, 2017, he became the 31st player in MLB history to reach 3,000 hits, and the first from the Dominican Republic. When he retired, Beltr\u00e9 ranked in the top ten all-time at his position in games played, assists, putouts, and double plays. He also holds the records for most hits, runs batted in, and runs scored by a third baseman. At the end of the 2018 season, Beltr\u00e9 jointly became one of the last two active MLB players to have played in the 1990s along with former Rangers teammate Bartolo Col\u00f3n. ==Professional career== ===Los Angeles Dodgers (1998\u20132004)=== Beltr\u00e9 attended Liceo M\u00e1ximo G\u00f3mez High School. While working out at Campo Las Palmas in 1994, a Los Angeles Dodgers facility \u2013 one of the first of its kind for a Major League Baseball (MLB) team in the Dominican Republic \u2013 Beltr\u00e9 was spotted by scouts Ralph Avila and Pablo Peguero. Though only 15 and weighing , Beltr\u00e9 featured a quick swing and live throwing arm. On the insistence of Avila and Peguero, the Dodgers signed him in July 1994 with a $23,000 signing bonus.Dayn Perry, \"Do Players Perform Better in Contract Years?\", Baseball Between the Numbers: Why Everything You Know About the Game is Wrong, (New York, Basic Books and Baseball Prospectus, 2005), p. 200\u201301. After being called up to the majors from the then-Dodgers' double-A affiliate San Antonio Missions, Beltr\u00e9 made his major league debut on June 24, 1998, starting at third base in the first game of an interleague series against the Anaheim Angels. At the time, he was the youngest player in the National League (NL). During his first at-bat, Beltr\u00e9 hit a two-out run batted in (RBI) double off Angels starter Chuck Finley into left field to score Paul Konerko from second base to tie the game. Beltr\u00e9 hit his first home run six days later against Texas Rangers starter Rick Helling. At the end of the 1998 season, Beltr\u00e9 finished with 13 errors at third base while batting .215 with seven home runs. At one point in the spring training prior to the start of the 1999 season, Beltr\u00e9's agent, Scott Boras, commented to him that \"he couldn't believe\" his relatively rapid ascent to the majors and handling of \"such a difficult position like third base\" at age 20. Beltr\u00e9 replied that he was 19 years old, not 20. Boras then realized that his date of birth in the Dodgers' records was incorrect and indicated the same to the team, but, that if they were to correct the mistake by compensating Beltr\u00e9 for signing him at younger than MLB's allowable age, they would no longer pursue the issue. Team personnel at Las Palmas denied Boras' assertion. As a result, Boras and Beltr\u00e9 went public. Boras convinced Commissioner of Baseball Bud Selig to investigate the Dodgers, and Major League Baseball suspended their scouting operations in the Dominican Republic for one year, as well as Avila and Peguero. Dodgers general manager Fred Claire, whom MLB did not contact during their investigation, publicly expressed surprise and that he was unaware of the incident. Selig awarded Beltr\u00e9 $48,500 in damages. Beltr\u00e9 averaged .265 and 18 home runs per season from 1999 through 2003. Of 810 total games played, he started 710 and was graded with a .948 fielding percentage. In 2004, Beltr\u00e9 had a breakout season in which he established a number of career highs, including leading MLB with 48 home runs. Other career highs included batting .334, 200 hits, 121 RBI, 104 runs scored, .629 slugging percentage, and a then-career high 32 doubles. He finished second in voting for the NL Most Valuable Player Award (MVP) and was honored with his first career Silver Slugger Award and the Babe Ruth Home Run Award.At the following webpage, scroll down to \"The Babe Ruth Homerun Award\". ===Seattle Mariners (2005\u20132009)=== At bat while playing for the Seattle Mariners The Seattle Mariners signed Beltr\u00e9 as a free agent before the 2005 season to a five-year, $64 million deal. Regressing to his pre-2004 form, he batted just .255 with 19 home runs and 87 RBI. Manager Mike Hargrove did not give up hope on Beltr\u00e9, saying, \"I think it's a season that, personally, he's disappointed in. I think it was a year that he will improve on the longer he's here and the longer he's in the American League.\" Beltr\u00e9 fielding After batting .167 through April 10, Ted Miller of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote that Beltr\u00e9 may become one of the Mariners' greatest busts. By June 5, 2006, Beltr\u00e9's batting average was slowly improving, from .109 on April 16 to .236 at that time. After hitting his first home run in April, and his second later that month, Beltr\u00e9's hitting began to improve. On July 23, 2006, against the Boston Red Sox, Beltr\u00e9 hit an inside-the-park home run, the first one ever in Safeco Field history. Though it was not a great season for Beltr\u00e9, it was statistically his best as a Mariner. He hit .276, had 26 home runs, 99 RBI, and a career high 41 doubles. He also was honored with a Fielding Bible Award for being the top MLB defensive third baseman during the year. The 2007 season was not one of Beltr\u00e9's better defensive years statistically. He tied with Brandon Inge for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, with 18, but ranked second in the league in assists, total chances, and range factor. He was charged with the lowest fielding percentage of all third basemen in the league at .958.Seattle's Suzuki and Beltre win Gold Gloves HeraldNet.comMLB Player Fielding Stats \u2013 As 1B \u2013 2011 ESPN In spite of leading third basemen in errors, Beltr\u00e9 was selected for his first Rawlings Gold Glove Award, becoming the first Mariners third baseman to win the award. On September 1, 2008, Beltr\u00e9 hit for the cycle, at the Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, becoming the fourth Mariner to do so. Arizona Diamondbacks shortstop Stephen Drew hit for the cycle that day as well, the first time two players had done so since 1920. He won his second Fielding Bible Award for his defense that year. Beltr\u00e9's decision not to wear a cup despite playing third base has been well- documented. This came back to hurt him on August 13, 2009, when he took a hard ground ball to the groin. Although he stayed in for the remainder of the 14-inning victory, he was put on the DL after suffering bleeding in one of his testicles. In his first game after returning from the DL, teammate Ken Griffey Jr. conspired with those responsible for the Safeco Field public address system to have Beltr\u00e9's at-bat intro music be the opening march from The Nutcracker Suite. Beltr\u00e9 batting for the Boston Red Sox in 2010. Beltr\u00e9 declared free agency on November 5, 2009. ===Boston Red Sox (2010)=== On January 7, 2010, Beltr\u00e9 signed a one-year, $9 million deal with the Boston Red Sox, which had a $5 million player option for 2011 with a $1 million buyout. Beltr\u00e9 led the Red Sox in batting average (.321) in 2010 and tied David Ortiz for the team lead in RBIs (102). He finished the year with 189 hits in 589 at- bats. He had 28 home runs and 84 runs scored. Beltr\u00e9 led the Majors in doubles, with 49 (also a career high). He also finished fourth in the AL in batting average, and was fifth in the AL in total bases (326) and slugging percentage (.553). He also had two stolen bases on the year, and finished ninth in the MVP voting.Hamilton wins MVP; Beltre finishes 9th ESPN On defense, he tied for the AL lead in errors by a third baseman, with 19. Beltr\u00e9 was also partially responsible for the Red Sox injuries woes that year, as he had two separate collisions with outfielders Jacoby Ellsbury and Jeremy Hermida, breaking their ribs in both instances. ===Texas Rangers (2011\u20132018)=== ====2011==== Adri\u00e1n Beltr\u00e9 with the Texas Rangers in 2011 On January 5, 2011, Beltr\u00e9 signed a five-year (2011\u201315), $80 million contract with a vesting option for $16 million for the 2016 season with the Texas Rangers. He was on the 2011 American League All-Star team. On July 22, Beltr\u00e9 strained his hamstring and was also placed on the DL. On September 4, he hit a line single to right against the Red Sox for his 2,000th career hit. On September 11, Beltr\u00e9 hit two home runs, including the 300th of his career, against the Oakland Athletics. He was named the AL Player of the Month for September. In 2011, Beltr\u00e9 batted .296 with 32 home runs, fifth in the AL. He was third in the American League in slugging percentage (.561), sixth in RBIs (105), and ninth in OPS (.892). The Fielding Bible staff estimated that he saved 17 runs on defense in 2011. On October 4, 2011, in Game 4 of the ALDS against the Tampa Bay Rays, Beltr\u00e9 became the sixth player\u2014the first in a Division Series\u2014to hit three home runs in a Major League playoff game. He added a fourth playoff home run in Game 5 of the 2011 World Series when he went down to one knee chasing an outside curve ball from Chris Carpenter. The St. Louis Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. Beltr\u00e9 finished that postseason with five home runs and nine RBI. More recognition was bestowed to Beltr\u00e9 for his defense. On November 1, 2011, he was honored with his third Gold Glove Award and first by a Ranger third baseman since Buddy Bell's six- year run from 1979\u201384. He also won his third Fielding Bible Award. On November 2, 2011 he was awarded the Silver Slugger Award. ====2012==== Once again voted to the All-Star Game on July 1, 2012, Beltr\u00e9 was named a starter. He joined teammates Josh Hamilton and Mike Napoli on the All-Star team. It was Beltr\u00e9's third All-Star Game and third in a row dating back to 2010 with the Boston Red Sox. In the August 22, 2012, game against the Baltimore Orioles, Beltr\u00e9 hit three home runs in his first three at-bats, including two in the same inning. He joined Pablo Sandoval, Albert Pujols, George Brett, Reggie Jackson and Babe Ruth as the only players to hit a three-homer game in both the regular season and the postseason. On August 24, he hit for the cycle for the second time in his career. Both of his cycles came at Rangers Ballpark. With his first coming as a member of the Mariners, it was the first time in MLB history that a player had hit for the cycle more than once at the same stadium. He joined Joe DiMaggio as the only two players in big league history to have a three-homer game and a cycle in the same week. For his efforts, Beltr\u00e9 was named the AL Player of the Week for August 20\u201326. During the seven games he hit .433 (13-for-30) with three doubles, one triple, five home runs, nine RBI and seven runs scored. He had the highest slugging percentage (1.100) in the majors, the most total bases (33), was tied for first in hits and home runs, and tied for second in RBI. After the season, more defensive accolades followed Beltr\u00e9. He won his second consecutive Fielding Bible Award and fourth overall. He was also honored with the Gold Glove Award for the season on October 30, and second Platinum Glove Award. Wilson Sporting Goods honored him as one of their Defensive Players of the Year; in that year the award was established. ====2013==== Beltr\u00e9 in August 2014 On July 8, 2013, Beltr\u00e9 was named the American League Player of the Week for July 1\u20137. He batted .478 (11-for-23) with four home runs, two doubles and five RBI in six games. He led the American League in home runs, slugging (1.087), OPS (1.607), total bases (25), and extra-base hits (six) while producing the fourth highest batting average. Beltr\u00e9 hit safely in all six games with two or more hits four times. He had the 24th multi-homer game of his career with a pair of home runs on July 4 against Seattle. Maintaining his strong hitting throughout July, Beltr\u00e9 was named the American League Player of the Month, his fourth career monthly award. He batted .369 with four doubles, nine homers, 19 RBI and 13 runs scored over 26 games. He tied for the major league lead with both Alfonso Soriano, in home runs, and Torii Hunter, in total bases (69). Beltr\u00e9 also finished among the AL leaders in slugging percentage (second, .670), hits (tied for second, 38), extra-base hits (tied for fourth, 13), RBI (tied for fifth) and batting average (sixth). He capped off the month with a walk-off home run to lead the Rangers past the Angels on July 31, the seventh walk-off home run of his career, and first with Texas. It was his third monthly award with Texas, making him one of seven players to win multiple times with the Rangers, including Josh Hamilton (four), Rafael Palmeiro, Alex Rodriguez (both with three), Iv\u00e1n Rodr\u00edguez, Juan Gonz\u00e1lez and Rub\u00e9n Sierra (two each). For the 2013 season, Beltr\u00e9 played in 161 games and totaled a .315 average, 30 homers, 92 RBI and .509 SLG. He led the American League with 199 hits and was fourth in batting average and fifth in total bases (321). He also made the top-10 in games played, slugging percentage and home runs. In the AL MVP voting, he was tied for seventh place. The Dallas-Fort Worth chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America named Beltr\u00e9 the Texas Rangers Player of the Year. ====2014==== On May 7, 2014, while facing Jorge de la Rosa of the Colorado Rockies, Beltr\u00e9 hit his 100th home run as a member of the Rangers, becoming only the fifth player in Major League history to hit 100 home runs with three teams. He joined Darrell Evans, Reggie Jackson, Alex Rodriguez, and Jim Thome. On June 24, 2014, Beltr\u00e9 singled off Drew Smyly of the Detroit Tigers for his 2,500th career hit, and the first hit of a 4-for-4 game. On September 18, Beltr\u00e9 singled off Sonny Gray in the first inning for his 2,591st hit, surpassing Vladimir Guerrero as the all-time hit leader among Dominican-born players. Beltr\u00e9 finished the 2014 season batting .324 \u2013 his highest average since 2004 \u2013 with 19 home runs and 77 RBI in 148 games. ====2015==== In February 2015, the Rangers picked up Beltr\u00e9's option, which would have become guaranteed if he had reached 586 plate appearances in the 2015 season. While playing the Cleveland Indians on May 15, 2015, Beltr\u00e9 hit his 400th home run on a sinker from Bruce Chen. He became the 52nd player in MLB history to reach that plateau, and the fourth to do so while playing at least 75 percent of his games at third base. Enduring a torn ligament in his left thumb over the last three months of the season, Beltr\u00e9 had surgery to repair it immediately after the season ended. On August 3, 2015, Beltr\u00e9 hit for the cycle with hits in each of the first, second, third, and fifth innings against the Houston Astros at Globe Life Park in Arlington in a 12\u20139 win. It was his third career cycle, second as a Ranger, and third at Globe Life, the Rangers' home park, making him the only player ever to hit three cycles in one stadium. He became the first Rangers player to hit for multiple cycles. The first player in 82 years to hit for a third cycle, he became the fourth player to do so and tied the major league record for total career cycles, joining Long John Reilly, Bob Meusel and Babe Herman. The Phi Delta Theta fraternity presented Beltr\u00e9 with the 2014 Lou Gehrig Memorial Award on September 17, 2015, making him the first Rangers player to win the award. He had contributed significantly to humanitarian acts in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex such as Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation, Texas Rangers RBI program, the I Love Baseball program, which operates in the Dominican Republic, the Baseball Tomorrow Fund, as well as the foundations established by a number of major league players. During the last week of the season, and the Rangers' run towards the AL West championship, Beltr\u00e9 batted .448 with two home runs and 13 RBI. He also went 2-4 with a home in the final game of the season to help the Rangers advance to their sixth AL West title. He finished the season with 18 home runs, 83 RBI, 163 hits, and .287 average. ====2016==== On April 15, 2016, Beltr\u00e9 and the Rangers agreed to a two-year, $36 million contract extension that would cover the 2017 and 2018 seasons. Valued at $18 million each for both seasons, the extension prevented Beltr\u00e9 from becoming a free agent at the end of the season. Displaying a drop to one knee, Beltr\u00e9 hit a home run on a curve ball from Jesse Hahn of Oakland on May 17. In a May 29 game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, Beltr\u00e9 hit a two-run home run off Juan Nicasio to give him 1,501 career RBI, making him the 54th player to reach the milestone, and the fourth third baseman. On July 2, 2016, Beltr\u00e9 became the 28th player all time to amass 10,000 career at-bats. On July 23, 2016, he became the 36th player all time to record 11,000 career plate appearances. Two days later, he hit the walk-off home run, the ninth of his career, against the Athletics in the bottom of the ninth inning for a 7\u22126 win. On August 24, 2016, Beltr\u00e9, in a game against the Cincinnati Reds, hit a go-ahead two-out double for his 2,900th career hit and led the Rangers to a 6-5 win. With this hit, Beltr\u00e9 became the 39th player in Major League history to reach the milestone. Beltr\u00e9 would once again show his signature home run knee drop after hitting a solo shot in the second inning in a game against the Houston Astros on September 13, 2016. His 30th of the season, it was the first time he reached the mark since 2013 and fifth in his career. Ten days later, his two-run home run in the eighth inning against the Athletics aided the Rangers in clinching the American League West division crown for the second year in a row and the seventh in franchise history. He also reached 100 RBI for the first time since 2012, and the fifth time in his career. He was selected as the American League Gold Glove winner at third base, the fifth of his career. ====2017==== Beltr\u00e9 began the 2017 season on the 10-day disabled list; he had injured his right leg near the end of spring training. Beltr\u00e9 made his 2017 debut on May 29 versus the Tampa Bay Rays, batting fourth. On July 4, Beltr\u00e9 hit his 600th career double, becoming the 17th player all-time to reach that milestone. On July 7, Beltr\u00e9 became the 21st player to amass 5,000 career total bases. On July 26, Beltr\u00e9 was ejected by umpire Gerry Davis; in a game against the Miami Marlins, Davis asked Beltr\u00e9, who was the next scheduled batter, to move closer to the on-deck circle. Beltr\u00e9 responded by picking up the edge of the logo that marked the on-deck circle and moving it closer to where he had been standing, which prompted Davis to eject him. Beltre collected his 3,000th hit with a double into left field against Wade Miley of the Baltimore Orioles on July 30, 2017, making him the 31st player to reach this milestone and the first Dominican born player to accomplish it. ====2018==== Prior to the start of the 2018 season, the Rangers signed Bartolo Col\u00f3n, giving them the only two active players with at least 20 seasons in the major leagues. On April 5, 2018, Beltr\u00e9 doubled in the second inning versus the Oakland Athletics to pass Rod Carew as the all-time hits leader by a Latin-American player with 3,054. Beltr\u00e9 later singled in the eighth inning to pull into a tie with former teammate Rickey Henderson for 24th on the all-time hit list. He would move past Craig Biggio 5 days later for 23rd place all-time with his 3,061st hit. On April 22, 2018, Beltr\u00e9 hit a double in the bottom of the 8th inning of a game against the Seattle Mariners to pass George Brett as the all-time leader in extra base hits by a third baseman with his 1,120th extra base hit. He has the most hits by a foreign-born player, surpassing Ichiro Suzuki by hitting a double on June 13, 2018 for hit number 3,090. On November 20, 2018, Beltr\u00e9 announced his retirement.https://twitter.com/Rangers/status/1064896479138119680 On June 8, 2019, Beltr\u00e9 had his number 29 retired by the Rangers. ===Career statistics=== In 2,933 games over 21 seasons, Beltr\u00e9 posted a .286 batting average (3,166-for-11,068) with 1,524 runs, 636 doubles, 38 triples, 477 home runs, 1,707 RBI, 121 stolen bases, 848 bases on balls, .339 on-base percentage and .480 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .960 fielding percentage. In 28 postseason games, he hit .261 (29-for-111) with 16 runs, 6 doubles, 5 home runs, 11 RBI and 4 walks. ==Playing style== Beltr\u00e9's signature home run swing included a drop to one knee when connecting with a breaking ball, particularly notable during Game 5 of the 2011 World Series in an at bat against Cardinals ace pitcher Chris Carpenter. While Beltr\u00e9 is known for his wild defense, his style is somewhat unorthodox. Master infield instructor and former Rangers manager Ron Washington, stated that the proper way to approach a ground ball to third base is to \"flow through\" the ball. After the Rangers signed Beltr\u00e9 to a five-year contract before the 2011 season, they sought to improve his skill by pairing him with Washington. He opined that Beltr\u00e9's technique is wrong because he stops before catching and then throws in spite of relying very little on the positioning of his feet. Beltr\u00e9 explains that his arm was so strong that early in his career he was making so many throwing errors, and that by planting his feet he was able to improve his accuracy to the point where he is able to pivot and release with uncanny precision from any angle without the proper foot positioning that is so critical for other third basemen. Another major league manager, Joe Maddon, compared the unique style of Beltr\u00e9's defensive play to Ozzie Smith\u2019s \"flair at shortstop,\" Stan Musial\u2019s \"coiled batting stance\" and the way Steve Carlton wrapped his left wrist before releasing a slider. Commented Maddon further on Beltr\u00e9's defense, \"There\u2019s a lot of guys that did things unique to them that weren\u2019t out of the Spalding Guide. They did things you wouldn\u2019t teach, and if somebody else tried to do it, they would not be very good.\u201d Commented Rangers bench coach Steve Buechele, \"he's not your most conventional third baseman, he does things his own way and has developed his own style over his career but there's something to be said for his hand-eye coordination and his hands. It's remarkable what he does. ... He's a super smart player, knows where to position himself.\" Beltr\u00e9 has become known for the joy and the sense of playfulness that he exhibits on the field. He has a routine with Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus on pop flies where both men put their arms up to catch the ball. During a game against the Red Sox on June 26, 2016, Sandy Le\u00f3n hit a foul ball which landed in the first row in the stands, just out of Beltr\u00e9's reach. However, instead of returning immediately to the infield, he reached very close to the ball in a motion, pretending, as if he were going to take it away from the fan who caught Le\u00f3n's foul ball. Beltr\u00e9 is also known for his dislike of anyone touching the top of his head, which teammates have done frequently, especially Elvis Andrus. Before the game where he recorded his 3,000th hit, he let his teammates touch his head. Much to his dismay, the act has turned into a game, inducing repeat offenders such as his infield partner Andrus. Beltr\u00e9 also dislikes Gatorade showers. After a game in which he hit a grand slam that provided the decisive runs in a 5\u20132 win over the Athletics on August 15, 2016, he took a broom from the groundskeepers closet and began combing an area of infield dirt. Still, Rougned Odor trotted to Beltr\u00e9 carrying a bucket filled with Gatorade, and in his attempt to drench Beltr\u00e9, missed him with the launch of the column of the liquid. Olympic gymnast and Dallas-area native Madison Kocian threw out the ceremonial first pitch in the September 3, 2016 game against the Astros and commended Beltr\u00e9. When asked of her preference between meeting singer Beyonc\u00e9 and Beltr\u00e9, Kocian chose Beltr\u00e9, as \"[he is] probably my number one because I'm a huge Rangers fan so he's always been an inspiration for me. He's dealt with a lot of injuries as well, and he's fought through them, and he's just a team player overall, so I've looked up to him for a long time.\" ==Charity and humanitarian work== Actively involved in the community, Beltr\u00e9 has contributed significantly to humanitarian acts in the Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex such as Texas Rangers Baseball Foundation, Texas Rangers RBI program, the I Love Baseball program, which operates in the Dominican Republic, and the Baseball Tomorrow Fund. Further, he has donated to Dave Valle's Esperanza International as well as foundations established by other major league players, including Robinson Chirinos, Eddie Guardado, Joakim Soria and Michael Young. ==Awards and achievements== ;Awards * All- World Baseball Classic Team (2006) * 4\u00d7 Fielding Bible Award at third base (2006, 2008, 2011, 2012) * Lou Gehrig Memorial Award (2014) * 4\u00d7 MLB All-Star (2010\u201312, 2014) * 4\u00d7 MLB Player of the Month (September 2004, September 2011, September 2012, July 2013) * 6\u00d7 MLB Player of the Week (August 27, 2000; June 27, 2004; August 26, 2012; July 7, 2013; October 4, 2015; July 30th, 2017) * 2\u00d7 Rawlings American League Platinum Glove Award (2011, 2012) * 5\u00d7 Rawlings Gold Glove Award at third base (2007, 2008, 2011, 2012, 2016) * 4\u00d7 Silver Slugger Award at third base (2004, 2010, 2011, 2014) * 4\u00d7 Texas Rangers Player of the Year (2012, 2013, 2014, 2016) * Thomas A.
