Muslims are visible in the capital, Vientiane, which has a mosque. The Muslim population is mostly engaged in trade and manage meat shops. Muslims live primarily in urban areas such as Savannakhet. A new mosque was built in Oudomxay in June 2016. == Communities == === Chinese or Chin Haw === The Chin Haw community has a long history in Laos. Originally from Yunnan (in China), they worked as merchants throughout Burma, Thailand, southwest China, and Laos. They were known to have a presence in Laos as far south as Luang Prabang and even beyond. They mainly reside in northern Laos. The Chin Haw community was considered the largest Muslim community in Laos but their numbers have been sharply declining as they migrate overseas. The recent political developments in Laos since the 1970s have been the reason for their migrations. === South Asians === Many Muslims of South Asian ancestry mainly reside in Vietiane and attend the Jamia Masjid. Most of these Muslims were originally from India, Pakistan or Afghanistan.Farouk, Omar (2008). The Re- organization of Islam in Cambodia and Laos. CIAS discussion paper No.3: Islam at the Margins: The Muslims of Indochina. The earliest South Asian Muslims in Laos were Tamils from Pondicherry who arrived via Ho Chi Minh City. === Chams === A small community of Cham Muslims from Cambodia who escaped the Khmer Rouge are also found. They use the Azhar Masjid or the Masjid Cambodia as called by the locals. === Indigenous Lao === There is a small community of native Lao converts to Islam. Many of these converts intermarry with the other Muslim communities. == Status of Islam in Laos == Laotian Muslims enjoy freedom of religion and Islam is given a legal presence according to the 1991 Constitution of the Lao People's Democratic Republic. However, the government of Laos severely restricts and controls the practice of Islam (and other religions) in the country. ==See also== * Islam by country * Jamia masjid Vientiane * Masjid Azahar \u0645\u0633\u062c\u062f ==References== Laos ",
