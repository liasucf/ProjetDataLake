    "text": "The Betano Power Station (Portuguese Central El\u00e9ctrica de Betano) is an oil power station located northeast of Betano, in the Manufahi District of East Timor. It was built to supply the South coast of East Timor with electricity, while the North coast is supplied by the Hera power station. The power station was inaugurated on August 20, 2013. It has a total output of 136 MW, supplied by eight W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 18V46 engine generators. For comparison, the capacity of the Hera power station is slightly lower at 119 MW. The power station was built by China Nuclear Industry 22nd Construction Company (CNI22). It is owned by Electricidade de Timor-Leste (EDTL), but operated by the Indonesian company Puri Akraya Engineering Ltd. In October 2017, Wartsil\u00e4 signed a new five-year contract for maintenance of the power station. As of January 2017, the station runs on light fuel oil, but heavy fuel oil and natural gas can be used as alternatives. 2017-02-24 Central El\u00e9ctrica de Betano 1.jpg | Oil tanks 2017-02-24 Central El\u00e9ctrica de Betano 3.jpg | Electrical substation 2017-02-24 Central El\u00e9ctrica de Betano 5.jpg | Interior of the power station 2017-02-24 Central El\u00e9ctrica de Betano 6.jpg | Cooling cells ==References== Category:Power stations in East Timor Category:2013 establishments in East Timor Category:Oil-fired power stations ",
