It would complement the current \u00d8resund heavy rail line. ==Background== In September 2011, the local governments in Copenhagen and the neighbouring Malm\u00f6 in Sweden announced that they were seeking European Union funding to study a potential metro line under the \u00d8resund to the neighbourhood of Malm\u00f6 Central Station, providing faster trips and additional capacity beyond that of the existing \u00d8resund Bridge. The study, for which the EU granted funding in the following December, will consider both a simple shuttle between the two stations and a continuous line integrated with the local transport networks on each side, and they anticipate a travel time of 15 minutes between the two city centers. Work on the study is expected to continue until 2020. In May 2018 the Oresundsmetro Executive was announced, formed of representatives from the two cities, industry and researchers, to explore the proposal to link Copenhagen and Malm\u00f6 via a driverless metro system, with travel time of around 20 minutes compared to 35 minutes by train. Capacity constraints are expected on the Oresund Line rail services once the Fehmarn Belt Fixed Link is completed, and the \u20ac4 billion metro proposal would ease this bottleneck. ==Proposal== The line is planned to have capacity for 36 trains per hour in each direction, a maximum speed of and be connected to the existing Copenhagen Metro system. ==See also== * \u00d8resundst\u00e5g * Johor Bahru\u2013Singapore Rapid Transit System - a similar proposed cross-border metro line between Singapore and Malaysia * Berlin U-Bahn ==References== ==External links== * Official website Category:Rapid transit in Denmark Category:Rapid transit in Sweden Category:Railway lines in Denmark Category:Railway lines in Sweden Category:International railway lines Category:Transport in Copenhagen Category:Transport in Malm\u00f6 Category:Proposed rapid transit Category:Cross- border rapid transit ",
