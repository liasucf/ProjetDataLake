The first steering committee included: Ferdinando Adornato, Antonio Baldassarre, Augusto Antonio Barbera, Rodolfo Brancoli, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, Franco Debenedetti, Diego Della Valle, Ernesto Galli della Loggia, Alfio Marchini, Mino Martinazzoli, Vittorio Merloni, Angelo Panebianco, Sergio Romano, Cesare Romiti, Giorgio Rumi and Marco Tronchetti Provera. The official organ of the foundation was the monthly \"Liberal\". In 1998 Galli della Loggia left \u00abLiberal\u00bb and the foundation, at the behest of its president Adornato, gradually approached the centre-right coalition, up to the adhesion of the same Adornato to Forza Italia. The monthly \"Liberal\" thus aimed to adapt the American Conservatism to the Italian political system, with a careful look especially at the neoconservatism and the theoconservatism, as well processing the so-called \"theoliberalism\". Adornato used the foundation as a means of establishing the \"House of Moderates\", the single party of the Italian centre-right, with the merge of Forza Italia, National Alliance and Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. However, when Berlusconi announcedin 2007 The People of Freedom, Adornato refused to join it, stating that this was not the unitary project he was working on but was rather a restyling of Forza Italia.Adornato: \u00abA Berlusconi questa volta dico no\u00bb Adornato and its Liberal Foundation thus joined the Union of the Centre, representing its conservative and liberal wing. ==References== ==External links== *Official website *Liberal Foundation Category:Political party factions in Italy Category:Think tanks based in Italy ",
