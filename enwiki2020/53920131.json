At 03:35, 15 August 1943, LST-414 was struck by a torpedo off Cani Rocks, Tunisia. Capitano Carlo Faggioni, of the Regia Aeronautica (Italian Air Force), had flown his SM.79 torpedo bomber of the 278th Squadriglia, 132nd Gruppo, from Decimomannu Airfield in Sardinia. LST-414 was later beached off Bizerta. She struck from the Navy list on 24 November 1943. == See also == * List of United States Navy LSTs == Notes == ;Citations == Bibliography == Online resources * * * * ==External links== * Category:Ships built in Baltimore Category:1942 ships Category:LST-1-class tank landing ships of the Royal Navy Category:World War II amphibious warfare vessels of the United Kingdom Category:S3-M2-K2 ships Category:Maritime incidents in August 1943 ",
