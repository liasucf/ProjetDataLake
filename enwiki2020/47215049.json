He served as lieutenant treasurer during the administration of governor Pedro Men\u00e9ndez de M\u00e1rquez (1577-1594). == Career == In 1586, during the governorship of Pedro Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez, the English privateer Francis Drake attacked and burned St. Augustine (San Agust\u00edn), the capital of Florida (La Florida), destroying many documents including records of account, so that Arg\u00fcelles had to make a new inventory of property that remained after the fire. When Governor Domingo Mart\u00ednez de Avenda\u00f1o died in 1595, the three treasury officials, treasurer Juan Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez, accountant Bartolom\u00e9 de Arg\u00fcelles and factor-overseer Alonso de las Alas, became acting co-governors of La Florida.On the death, unauthorized absence, retirement or removal of a governor, the treasury officials often jointly governed Florida until a new governor appointed by the king could take up his duties. Such joint interim governorships occurred in 1595-1597, 1612-1613, 1631-1633, and 1646-1648.() At the time of Avenda\u00f1o's death, Arg\u00fcelles was in Mexico City to retrieve the situado, the annual subsidy from the treasury of New Spain to support the presidio at St. Augustine. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez and Las Alas were reported to have quarrelled over the governance of Florida until Arg\u00fcelles returned from Mexico City.Francis & Kole: 116 Arg\u00fcelles, who had been in Florida since the 1570s and had become accountant in 1591, aspired to be governor.Arg\u00fcelles served as lieutenant of the Santa Elena garrison from 1583 to 1587. He returned to Spain in time to serve as a captain of infantry with the Spanish Armada. The ship he claimed to have served on, however, wrecked in Ireland with only one known survivor, who was executed by the English. Arg\u00fcelles soon returned to Florida, and was appointed accountant.(Francis & Kole: 115) Arg\u00fcelles sent a petition to be appointed as governor to the King shortly after Avenda\u00f1o's death. The King turned down Arg\u00fcelles's request, and appointed Gonzalo M\u00e9ndez de Cancio y Donleb\u00fan, who had never been to Florida, as governor. M\u00e9ndez arrived at St. Augustine in 1597.Bushnell 1981: 145-146Bushnell 1991: 118, 120, 122Francis & Kole: 17-18 Soon after M\u00e9ndez reached St. Augustine, he encountered resistance over a payment from the royal treasury to the new garrison priest, Father Ricardo. Arg\u00fcelles and factor-overseer Las Alas refused to make the payment, saying that there was no authorization for it. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez sided with governor M\u00e9ndez on the issue. Shortly afterwards, M\u00e9ndez charged Las Alas with embezzling funds from the royal treasury, and suspended him from office. Las Alas claimed that M\u00e9ndez and Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez had conspired against him.Francis & Kole: 36 The king had given governor M\u00e9ndez authorization to name his own lieutenant and successor, and M\u00e9ndez chose his nephew, Juan Garc\u00eda de Navia. Rather than attack governor M\u00e9ndez directly, Arg\u00fcelles conducted a letter-writing campaign against Garc\u00eda and other officials appointed by M\u00e9ndez, and against M\u00e9ndez's handling of the Guale rebellion.Francis & Kole: 116-118 Alarmed at repeated incursions into the province of Guale by French sassafras traders, who were coming and going unmolested in the harbors of the coast, Arg\u00fcelles implored Governor Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez to send Timucuan allies with Spanish troops to seize their canoes and burn their food crops, as well as to seize some of the young men and enslave them. Men\u00e9ndez M\u00e1rquez's successor, M\u00e9ndez de Can\u00e7o, employed these tactics, thus reviving M\u00e1rquez's \"war of fire and blood\" against the rebel Guale. == Notes == ==References== Category:Royal Governors of La Florida Category:16th- century births Category:Year of death unknown ",
