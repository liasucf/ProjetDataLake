    "text": "Program logo Fome Zero (, Zero Hunger) is a program of the Government of Brazil introduced by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2003, with the goal to eradicate hunger and extreme poverty in the country. ==Contents of the program== The program is co-ordinated by the Ministry of Social Development and Hunger Combat (Minist\u00e9rio do Desenvolvimento Social e Combate \u00e0 Fome) and was intended to put into action the government's strategy to guarantee the right of access to basic food. The program takes a number of forms, ranging from direct financial aid to the poorest families (with the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia card) to diverse strategies such as creating water cisterns in Brazil's semi- arid areas, creating low-cost restaurants, educating people about healthy eating habits, distributing vitamins and iron supplements, supporting subsistence family farming and giving access to microcredit. Fome Zero is thought to be the biggest initiative to date by a Brazilian government to combat hunger in the history of the country, and builds on similar assistance programs implemented by previous governments. ==Effects== The program is believed to have contributed to Brazil's recent reported improvements in its fight against poverty, according to research promoted by some universities and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). An ex ante econometric evaluation of Bolsa Escola did find significant effects on both school attendance rates and the number of children involved in child labor.SSRN-Ex-ante Evaluation of Conditional Cash Transfer Programs: The Case of Bolsa Escola by Francois Bourguignon, Francisco Ferreira, Phillippe Leite The World Bank, which created on June 2005 a Bolsa Fam\u00edlia Project\\- Bolsa Familia Project, The World Bank to assist the Brazilian government in managing the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia Program, declared that \"Although the program is relatively young, some results are already apparent, including: (...) contributions to improved education outcomes, and impacts on children\u2019s growth, food consumption, and diet quality\".Brazil\u2019s Bolsa Familia Program Celebrates Progress in Lifting Families out of Poverty, News & Broadcast, The World Bank, Brasilia, Brazil, December 19, 2005 A study by the UNDP Poverty Centre found that over 80% of the Bolsa Familia benefits went to families in poverty (making under half the minimum wage per capita), thus most of the benefits were going to the poor.International Policy Centre for Inclusive Growth (UNDP/IPC-IG) Evaluation Note BF was also claimed to have been responsible for about 20% of the drop in inequality in Brazil since 2001, which is welcome in one of the most unequal countries on the planet.untitled Research promoted by the World Bank showed a significant reduction in child labor exploitation among children benefited by the Bolsa Fam\u00edlia program.YAP, Yoon-Tien, Guilherme Sedlacek and Peter Orazem. 2001.

World Bank, Washington, DC The program has also been reported to have made a significant impact on the ability of the poorest families to eat. Children in public school receive one free meal a day\u2014two in the poorest areas\u2014and so less of their family's limited income is needed to pay for food. In a survey of Bolsa Familia recipients, 82.4% reported eating better; additionally, it was reported to increase the incomes of the poorer families by about 25%.Microsoft PowerPoint - Mutzig_CCTs in MIC_Brazil_06-26_III.b.ppt ==Criticism== In 2003, David de Ferranti,BIRD the World Bank IBRD representative for Latin America and the Caribbean, criticized the program,Governo recebe novas cr\u00edticas aos principais pontos do Fome Zero - Folha Online (March 31, 2003) due to its lack of clear focus, saying the program did not combat the country's poverty and income inequality. He also criticised the mechanisms for money donation and food gathering and distribution. Fome Zero is considered by the opposition (especially the PSDB and DEM parties) as a failure, due to what they believe is the government's inability to manage the program effectively. Murilo Zauith, a PFL federal deputy, in March 2005, said the program was faulty, citing as an example the death of several indigenous children due to malnutrition in the city of Dourados, Mato Grosso do Sul. However, Humberto Costa, the Minister of Health at the time, considered the death count average and not alarming.Murilo Zauith considera Fome Zero programa fracassado - Correio do Estado (March 11, 2005) Another criticism is that the program turned mostly in a money-transfer program, subject to corruption, and did not completely solve the problem.The Fome Zero Program \u2013 Brazil\u2019s Losing Struggle to Help the Hungry: Lula\u2019s Leadership Fading - Council on Hemispheric Affairs(July, 2005) Data from 2014-2015 showed that malnutrition is still a problem in Brazil and responsible by 4.3 deaths per 100,000 people per year, linked to the fact that 3.8% of the population (7.6 million people) still earns less than US$1 a day.Malnutrition Death Rate Per 100,000 - WORLD HEALTH RANKINGS(Who, 2014)Nutrition Landscape Information System (NLiS) - World Health Organization(March, 2017) == Sources == * Aaron Ansell, Zero Hunger: Political Culture and Antipoverty Policy in Northeast Brazil (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2014) ==See also== *Bolsa Escola *Bolsa Fam\u00edlia ==References== ==External links== * Fome Zero Official Website Category:Welfare in Brazil Category:Social security in Brazil ",
