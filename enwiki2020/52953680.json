    "text": "\"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\", (English: \"The sun rises every day\"), also known as \"Chipir\u00f3n\", is a song by Spanish alternative rock band Bongo Botrako, written by lead vocalist Uri Gin\u00e9 and featuring uncredited vocals by Spanish band La Pegatina. It was recorded by the band for their 2010 debut studio album Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol and was released as the album's first single on June 18, 2010. The song became very popular in Spain after the men's national basketball team players, including Pau Gasol, Marc Gasol and Ricky Rubio, took the habit of singing it before every game in the EuroBasket 2011 Championship, which they eventually won. In September 2011, \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" peaked at #12 on the Spain Songs chart and #2 on the iTunes Spain Songs chart. The song accumulates more than 15 million streamings on YouTube and more than 7 million streamings on Spotify, which ultimately makes it Bongo Botrako's most popular song by far. ==Inspiration== Original graffiti that inspired the song, in Granada, Spain. Uri Gin\u00e9 wrote the song in Granada, Spain, where he lived for a few months. He was inspired by a graffiti on a wall that he saw while walking around the Albayz\u00edn district. The graffiti read the optimistic phrase \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol chipir\u00f3n..!\". In Spanish, \"chipir\u00f3n\" means \"small squid\", but in this context the word was used as a funny way to refer to a person. A few days later, Gin\u00e9 woke up in the middle of the night with this phrase in his head and wrote the whole song in thirty minutes. Even though the lyrics aren't completely explicit, Gin\u00e9 once admitted that the song is mainly about sexual experiences that he had while living in Granada. ==Music video== The music video for \"Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol\" was directed by Egoi Suso. It was shot in Tarragona, Spain on May 20, 2011 and was released on June 23, 2011. In the video, frontman Uri Gin\u00e9 is shown singing the song as he walks down the street and meets his bandmates. He also passes through two bars, a hair salon and a bar's kitchen, and he finally arrives to a small square where he sings along with the whole band and a crowd of fans. Uri Gin\u00e9 wanted the music video to end in this square because he used to play his songs there very often before forming the band. Actually, another song from the same album, called \"La pla\u00e7a de la alegr\u00eda\", is about this square and some stories that took place there. The real name of the square is Pla\u00e7a Sedassos and it is located in the old town of Tarragona, Spain. ==Personnel== Credits adapted from the liner notes of Todos los d\u00edas sale el sol.
