He later made 12 appearances in the 1996 K League. Following his stint in Asia, Rankovi\u0107 joined Partizan in early 1997. He spent seven seasons with the Crno- beli, including loan spells to Chinese club Sichuan Dahe in 2002, as well as to fellow Serbian club Zemun in 2003. Subsequently, Rankovi\u0107 moved abroad to France and joined Ligue 2 side Caen. He helped them earn promotion to Ligue 1 in his first season at the club. However, as they immediately suffered relegation from the top flight, Rankovi\u0107 left the country and signed for Ukrainian club Metalurh Zaporizhya in the summer of 2005. He returned to French football six months later and joined Ligue 2 club S\u00e8te, before hanging up his boots in 2006. ==Post-playing career== After retiring from the game, Rankovi\u0107 was a member of technical staff at his former club Partizan for seven years, before joining Belarusian side Dinamo Minsk as assistant manager to Du\u0161an Uhrin Jr. ahead of the 2015 season. He was brought to the club by newly appointed director of football Vuk Ra\u0161ovi\u0107. After Ra\u0161ovi\u0107 replaced Uhrin as manager, Rankovi\u0107 remained serving as an assistant. He returned to Partizan in August 2016, becoming assistant manager to Marko Nikoli\u0107. In June 2017, Rankovi\u0107 joined Aleksandar Stanojevi\u0107 in Greece as his assistant at PAOK.
