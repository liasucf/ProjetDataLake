    "text": "Pretty Village, Pretty Flame ( / Lepa sela lepo gore, literally \"Pretty villages burn pretty\") is a 1996 Serbian film directed by Sr\u0111an Dragojevi\u0107 with a screenplay based on a book written by Vanja Buli\u0107. Set during the Bosnian War, the film tells the story of Milan, part of a small group of Serb soldiers trapped in a tunnel by a Bosniak force. Through flashbacks, the lives of the trapped soldiers in pre-war Yugoslavia are shown, particularly Milan and his Bosniak best friend Halil becoming enemies after having to pick opposing sides in the conflict. ==Summary== The plot was inspired by real-life events that took place in the opening stages of the Bosnian War, with the film's screenplay being based on an article written by Vanja Buli\u0107 for Duga magazine about the actual event. Following the success of the movie, Buli\u0107 wrote a novel named Tunel that's essentially an expanded version of his magazine article. Pretty Village, Pretty Flame features a non-linear plot line, and the scenes change between time periods from 1971 to 1999 which mostly cut back and forth in no particular order. The main time periods include the \"present\" with a hospitalized Milan, with flashbacks to both his childhood and his early adulthood in the 1980s until the war begins, and subsequent service as a soldier where he is trapped in the tunnel. ==Plot== The film opens with a fictitious newsreel, showing the opening of the Tunnel of Brotherhood and Unity by visiting President Josip Broz Tito and local dignitary D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107 on 27 June 1971. During the ribbon-cutting ceremony, President Tito accidentally cuts his thumb with the scissors. At the beginning of the Bosnian War in 1992, Milan (Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107), a Bosnian Serb, and his best friend Halil (Nikola Pejakovi\u0107), a Bosniak Muslim, live a quiet life in a small village in eastern Bosnia, playing basketball at a kafana owned by Slobo (Petar Bo\u017eovi\u0107). While Milan and Halil are taking a break, Nazim, a Bosniak neighbour of Slobo, asks him if he can look after his house while he is visiting his sister in Tuzla. Halil makes comments to Nazim about moving away rather than visiting his relatives as many of their belongings can be seen in their car and trailer, which Nazim denies. A wounded Milan is then shown in bed at a military hospital in Belgrade, where he taunts a wounded young Bosniak soldier in the neighbouring room, whom he threatens to kill if his friend in the next bed dies. In 1994 during the conflict, Milan joins the Army of Republika Srpska and is attached to a squad that includes: * Velja (Nikola Kojo): a career criminal and thief from Belgrade, who did most of his work in West Germany. During a visit home the authorities came to conscript his younger brother, a promising student. Velja pretended to be his brother, knowing full well he would have been taken to the front lines for draft- dodging, becoming a soldier in his place. * Petar \"Professor\" (Dragan Maksimovi\u0107): a Bosnian Serb school teacher from Banja Luka, he seems to have nostalgic feelings towards SFR Yugoslavia. While some of the others loot houses, he is more interested in literature and intermittently reads from a burnt diary he found in one of the villages the squad passed through. * Brzi \"Speedy\" (Zoran Cvijanovi\u0107): a heroin addict from Belgrade, the son of a Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) officer and the only one in the group who speaks English. While high on drugs one night, he walked to a highway overpass in Belgrade where the people have gathered to cheer on the troops going to war, jumping off only to land in a JNA truck headed towards the Croatian border. It is left ambiguous whether the jump was a suicide attempt. Brzi was given an ambulance truck to drive and he now sees his involvement in the war as an attempt to get himself off drugs. * Laza (Dragan Petrovi\u0107): a simple-minded and impressionable family man with old-fashioned values. Laza was so outraged by a Serbian TV news report about atrocities against Serbs that he walked to the nearest highway and hitchhiked to Belgrade to volunteer for combat. On the way there he vents his anger to the truck driver that picked him up, telling him among other things \"never again shall a German or Turk set foot here\", completely unaware that the person behind the wheel is a Turkish trucker driving through Serbia. * Vilju\u0161ka \"Fork\" (Milorad Mandi\u0107): a cheerful and jovial Chetnik sympathizer from central Serbia whose only motive for fighting was looking out for his brother-in-law Laza. He is nicknamed Fork because he carries a fork around his neck symbolizing Serbian sophistication in the 14th century, and contrasts Serbian kings to English and German kings at the time, who he says ate using their hands.. * Gvozden (Bata \u017divojinovi\u0107): the squad's captain and a professionally trained Yugoslav People's Army officer. Although fighting for the Serbian side, in his heart he still believes in Yugoslavia and its ideals. In 1980, after the death of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, Gvozden made the national news when he ran a 350-kilometer marathon alone across the country to attend Tito's funeral. * Marko (Marko Kovijani\u0107): a young man who is often foolish and desperately seeking the approval of his colleagues. He is shown to be very fond of foreign culture; he drew a graffiti of a Serb three-finger salute with the caption saying \"Srbija do Tokija\" (\"Serbia to Tokyo\") on the wall of an abandoned house in a war-torn Bosniak village, later holding a Confederate flag when leaving the Bosniak village sitting on top of an M53/59 Praga, and he always wear a headband with the Chinese character for \"dragon\" (\u9f8d) on it. Milan, disturbed with the way the war is being conducted, is frustrated by the fact that war profiteers are looting Halil's property. Milan shoots three of the profiteers out of anger after they set fire to the auto-repair shop he and Halil had built together, wounding them, and is then shocked to find Slobo is looting the property too. Later Slobo tells him that his mother has been killed by Bosniaks from Halil's squad, and Milan returns to home to find it vandalized and covered in his mother's blood. After the squad set a village on fire, they watch it burn and Velja says: \"Pretty villages are pretty when they burn. Ugly villages stay ugly, even when they burn.\" (in Serbian, Lepa sela lepo gore, a ru\u017ena sela ostaju ru\u017ena, \u010dak i kad gore.) At night Milan and his squad are encircled by Bosniak fighters, telling his surviving squad mates to run to a nearby tunnel he was scared of entering as a child, believed to be home to a drekavac. Milan, Velja, Professor, Fork, Laza, and Gvozden enter the tunnel and fight off the Bosniak fighters, however the group become trapped as they will be shot if they leave. Attempting to contact their allies, the Bosniaks taunt them using Marko's radio, who they are torturing. Shortly afterwards, Speedy crashes his truck into the tunnel, with Liza Linel (Lisa Moncure) an American reporter for CBC News who had sneaked into the back of the truck, and the two also become trapped. The squad stays inside the tunnel for a week but begin to snap: Laza is mortally wounded when trying to throw a grenade. Velja tries to leave the tunnel with the intention of dying, but is shot and the others bring him back. The Bosniaks then announce they are sending a woman to the squad \"for their enjoyment\" who is revealed to be Milan and Halil's former school teacher who has been sexually abused. As she walks towards them slowly, they decide to shoot her before she gets too close, fearing explosives have been attached to her. None of them can do it until Fork shoots her, then having had enough of the war attempts to leave the tunnel but is killed, and Velja commits suicide. Milan recognizes the voice on the radio as Halil, and the two communicate shortly before the Bosniaks attack the tunnel. Gvozden drives the truck out of the tunnel at full speed (while singing Uz Mar\u0161ala Tita) before exploding from fires lit at the entrance, killing Gvozden and the troops attacking the tunnel, allowing the others to leave. On the way out Speedy is wounded by a stray bullet and Liza is killed by shrapnel from a grenade. Milan and Halil meet outside, where Halil asks who burned down his garage while Milan asks who killed his mother - both men deny being involved before Halil is then killed by a Serb artillery strike. Milan, Professor, and Speedy escape and all three are sent to the Belgrade military hospital, where Speedy is the friend in the bed next to Milan. Speedy eventually dies, and the following night Milan tries to kill the Bosniak boy as promised, despite being unable to walk. Milan crawls into the next room, followed by an equally disabled Professor trying to stop him. As Milan goes to stab the boy with a fork, he cannot bring himself to do it, and is discovered by the nurses. An imaginary scene then shows the tunnel full of dead bodies, including Milan and Halil, being witnessed by them as children. The film closes on 21 July 1999 with a newsreel, showing the re-opening of the reconstructed tunnel under the new name, Tunnel of Peace. ==Production== Real location of tunnel where movie was shot. Plaque above entrance has movie title written in Serbian and English The funds for the movie were raised through a legal entity Cobra Film Department that was registered as a limited liability company by Nikola Kojo, Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107, Goran Bjelogrli\u0107, and Milko Josifov.Dragan Bjelogrli\u0107 ;Pressing, 23 October 1996 Most of the money came from the Serbian government's (under prime minister Mirko Marjanovi\u0107) Ministry of Culture (headed by cabinet minister Nada Peri\u0161i\u0107-Popovi\u0107) as well as from the Serbian state television RTS. Reportedly, the budget raised was US$2 million.Putting a 'Flame' to Serbia's SoulThe Los Angeles Times, 29 October 1996 The shooting of the film with working title Tunel began on 19 April 1995. Majority of the scenes were shot on location in and around Vi\u0161egrad, Republika Srpska (Serb inhabited entity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, at the time still governed by Radovan Karad\u017ei\u0107), often in places that were former battlefields. In July 1995, after 85 shooting days, the production was put on hold due to lack of funds, some 7 planned shooting days short of completion. Following a new round of fund- raising, the production resumed in mid-November 1995 and finished by early 1996. According to Dragojevi\u0107, the movie's title is paraphrased from a passage describing burning villages in the distance in Louis-Ferdinand C\u00e9line's 1932 novel Voyage au bout de la nuit, literary work that had a strong effect on Dragojevi\u0107 when he read it in his early youth.Sr\u0111an Dragojevi\u0107: \"Parada\" je film za gay neistomi\u0161ljenike;PTP.hr, December 2011 ==Release and reaction== The film won accolades for direction, acting, and brutally realistic portrayal of the war in former Yugoslavia. It was also the first Serbian film to show the Serbian side of the conflict involved in atrocities and ethnic cleansing \u2013 the title of the film is an ironic comment on the protagonists' activities in a Bosnian village. Almost 800,000 people went to see the film in cinemas across Serbia,Bjela za MONDO: Bog te...uspeli smo!;mondo.rs, 11 February 2011 which equated to approximately 8% of the country's total population. The film was selected as the Serbian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 69th Academy Awards, but was not accepted as a nominee.Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences In addition to FR Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), the only other former Yugoslav countries where the movie had an official theatrical distribution were Slovenia and Macedonia. Released in Slovenia as Lepe vasi lepo gorijo, it became a cinema hit in the country with 72,000 admission tickets sold.Aplauzi za \"Paradu\" i u Skoplju;B92, 19 December 2011 In Macedonia it also posted a good box office result with more than 50,000 admission tickets sold.Cobra Film The Venice Film Festival refused the film with its director Gillo Pontecorvo calling it \"fascist cinema\".Lepa sela... su antisrpski film ;BH Dani, 8 September 2000 Earlier that year, Berlin and Cannes film festivals also rejected the film. Writing in Sight & Sound in November 1996, British author Misha Glenny delivered a stinging attack on critics who view Pretty Village, Pretty Flame or Emir Kusturica's Underground through a simplistic, reductionist pro- or anti-Serb critical lens.Misha Glenny, \"If You Are Not For Us\", Sight & Sound, November 1996, p.12 Swedish public service TV broadcast it under the name Vackra byar (\"beautiful villages\"). Even before wider distribution in North America, the film received notices in major American newspapers such as the Los Angeles Times and the Toledo Blade that covered it from the Bosnian War angle.Serb director's movie a blood-stained elegy to death of nation;The Toledo Blade, 5 January 1997 ===Continued reaction=== The reaction to the film and its various aspects continues long after its theatrical and festival run ended. It is frequently used by various public figures as springboard for political, ethnic, and historical discussions and open issues that continue to plague the Balkans region. In early 2000s, while promoting his movie No Man's Land, Bosniak director and former soldier in the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war Danis Tanovi\u0107 called Pretty Village, Pretty Flame \"well made, but ethically problematic due to its shameful portrayal of the war in Bosnia\".Nudili scenarij svima, do Tanovi\u0107a, Jutarnji list, November 30, 2006 ==Critical reception== The film's critical reception in North America was very positive. It got plenty of press coverage following its debut showings at festivals in Montreal and Toronto. Variety's Emanuel Levy penned a glowing review calling the film \"wilder in its black humor than MASH, bolder in its vision of politics and the military than any movie Stanley Kubrick has made, and one of the most audacious antiwar statements ever committed to the bigscreen\".Pretty Village, Pretty Flame;Variety, 8 September 1996 Ken Fox of TV Guide praised Dragojevi\u0107 for \"ultimately refusing to deal in heroes and villains and never shying away from self-condemnation\" while concluding that Pretty Village, Pretty Flame is \"a bloody, uncompromising and surprisingly enthralling piece of antiwar filmmaking that pulls no punches and demands to be seen\".Pretty Village, Pretty Flame;TV Guide, 1996 In his very favourable 1997 review, American online film critic James Berardinelli labelled the film \"a powerful condemnation of war that shares several qualities with the German films Das Boot and Stalingrad\".Pretty village, Pretty Flame:1997 New York Times' Lawrence Van Gelder gave kudos to Dragojevi\u0107 for \"unleashing a powerful assault on the insanity of the war that pitted Serb against Muslim in Bosnia\" and praised the film as \"a clear, well-meaning, universal appeal to reason\".Seeing a Doomed Future After War and Hatred;The New York Times, 10 October 1997 British magazine Total Film praised the film, calling it \"one of the most electrifying anti-war movies ever made\" and further continuing: \"What this small, worthy film excels at is showing how even long friendships became perverted in the Bosnian conflict.... Small it may be, but it's powerfully and perfectly formed\".Pretty Village, Pretty Flame;Total Film, 16 January 1998 Shlomo Schwartzberg of Boxoffice magazine called some of the film's scenes \"worthy of Vonnegut at his most hallucinatory\", concluding overall that \"the film is somewhat clich\u00e9d and a little more pro-Serb than necessary, but packs a genuine punch\".Pretty Village, Pretty Flame ;Boxoffice, 16 January 1998 Gerald Peary wrote in April 1998 that Dragojevi\u0107 \"creates a crass, unsentimental, muscular guys' world on the way to his vivid condemnation of the Bosnian War\".Pretty Village, Pretty Flame;Gerald Peary, April 1998 ==Awards== \"Lepa sela lepo gore\" garnered six wins and one nomination: *Won European Jury Award at the Festival d'Angers (1997) *Won Telcipro Award at the Festival d'Angers (1997) *Won Distinguished Award of Merit at the Lauderdale International Film Festival (1996) *Won Bronze Horse at the Stockholm International Film Festival (1996) *Won International Jury Award at the S\u00e3o Paulo International Film Festival (1996) *Won Audience Award at the Thessaloniki Film Festival (1996) *Nominated for Golden Alexander at the Thessaloniki Film Festival (1996) ==See also== * List of submissions to the 69th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film * List of Serbian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film ==References== ==External links== * * Film analysis by Igor Krstic in \"The Celluloid Tinderbox\" (E-Book) Category:1996 films Category:Bosnian War films Category:Serbo-Croatian-language films Category:Serbian films Category:Serbian-language films Category:Serbian war drama films Category:1990s war drama films Category:Films set in Serbia Category:Films set in Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Films directed by Sr\u0111an Dragojevi\u0107 Category:Nonlinear narrative films Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles Category:Films about drugs Category:1996 drama films ",
