A pupil of Jules Massenet, Grand Prix de Rome in 1863, Levad\u00e9 wrote chamber music, melodies, religious music, drama and op\u00e9ras comiques. He was very successful in his time. == Life == Levad\u00e9 was born in the 9th arrondissement of Paris. At the age of 13 he entered the Conservatoire de Paris where he followed the solf\u00e8ge classes of Albert Lavignac, Charles de B\u00e9riot, Georges Mathias, and Auguste Bazille. A few years later, it is at Lavignac's that he met Erik Satie who dedicated one of his Ogives and one of his Gymnop\u00e9dies to him. But it is especially with Jules Massenet that Levad\u00e9 reached the fullness of his talent. Among his students Massenet had an impressive number of Grand Prix de Rome. In 1911, the student paid tribute to his master by writing in the Annales politiques et litt\u00e9rairesAnnales politiques et litt\u00e9raires dated 17 December 1911: After Massenet's resignation in 1896, Levad\u00e9 attended the classes of Charles Lenepveu and obtained the Grand Prix de Rome in 1899 with his cantata Callirhoe to a text by Eug\u00e8ne Ad\u00e9nis. His public debut was quite rapid. As early as 1895 he produced a Japanese pantomime: Coeur de magots, a \"sketch\" given at the \"Grand Guignol\" in 1897, and a \"salon opera\" in 1903. But his success really began with a three-acts opera: The Heretics, a lyrical tragedy on a poem by Ferdinand H\u00e9rold. In 1908, he composed the music for La Courtisane de Corinthe, to a text by Michel Carr\u00e9 and Paul Bilhaud which was staged in 1908 by Sarah Bernhardt, then Les Fian\u00e7ailles de l'ami Fritz, after Erckmann-Chatrian in 1919. Other musical adaptations of literary texts followed, such as Le Capitaine Fracasse, libretto by \u00c9mile Bergerat and Michel Carr\u00e9, lyrical comedy from Th\u00e9ophile Gautier's eponymous novel and in 1929, La Peau de chagrin, lyrical comedy in four acts after Balzac, libretto by Pierre Decourcelle and Michel Carr\u00e9, then La R\u00f4tisserie de la reine P\u00e9dauque, lyrical comedy in four acts based on the novel by Anatole France in 1934. Levad\u00e9 was also a composer of popular songs (J'ai cueilli le lys, 1912), symphonic music (Pr\u00e9lude religieux for string orchestra), lullaby for piano and violin and religious music: Pr\u00e9lude religieux for organ, Agnus Dei for choir, Psaume CXIII for solo, choir and orchestra. Levad\u00e9 died in Cabourg on 27 October 1948. == Selected works == Les H\u00e9r\u00e9tiques, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre des Ar\u00e8nes \u00e0 B\u00e9ziers * Antigone, cantata, 1893 * Clarisse Harlowe, cantata, 1895 * C\u0153ur de Magots, japanese pantomime, 1895 * M\u00e9lusine, cantata, 1896 * Hortense, couche-toi ! by Georges Courteline, Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Grand-Guignol, 1897 * Callirho\u00e9, cantata, 1899 * L\u2019amour d\u2019H\u00e9liodora, Salon Opera, 1903 * Les H\u00e9r\u00e9tiques, poem by Ferdinand H\u00e9rold, \u00e0 B\u00e9ziers,Le Petit M\u00e9ridional, 29 August 1905, \"La deuxi\u00e8me des H\u00e9r\u00e9tiques aux Ar\u00e8nes de B\u00e9ziers\" Archives municipales de B\u00e9ziers, 2 R 9: Dossier du Comit\u00e9 d'organisation. libretto by Ferdinand H\u00e9rold. 1905 * Stage music for La Courtisane de CorintheLa Courtisane de Corinthe on Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France by Michel Carr\u00e9 and Paul Bilhaud, 1908 * Les Fian\u00e7ailles de l'ami Fritz by Jean-Marc d\u2019Anthoine, 1919 * La R\u00f4tisserie de la reine P\u00e9dauque, adapted by , 1920 * Caroles de No\u00ebl, opera, 1923 * Sophie, op\u00e9ra comique after Louis Tiercelin, Georges Docquois and Alfred Aubert, 1923 * La Peau de chagrin, lyrical comedy based on Honor\u00e9 de Balzac's La Peau de chagrin by Pierre Decourcelle and Michel Carr\u00e9, 1929 * Le Capitaine Fracasse, comedy by \u00c9mile Bergerat and Michel Carr\u00e9 based on the novel of the same name by Th\u00e9ophile Gautier * Pr\u00e9lude religieux for string orchestre * Danses alsaciennes for Grand Orchestra * Feuilles d\u2019album for Grand Orchestra * Arrichino for piano * Berceuse for piano and violin * Pr\u00e9lude religieux for pipe organ * Agnus Dei for Choir * Psaume CXIII for Soli, Choir and Orchestra == References == == External links == * Category:1869 births Category:1948 deaths Category:Musicians from Paris Category:Conservatoire de Paris alumni Category:French classical composers Category:French male classical composers Category:Prix de Rome for composition ",
