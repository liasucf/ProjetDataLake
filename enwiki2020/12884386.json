In 1928, his troops set fire to the Shaolin Monastery, burning it for over 40 days, destroying 90 percent of the buildings including many manuscripts of the temple library.Gene Ching. Kungfumagazine.com, Bak Sil Lum vs. Shaolin Temple]. While leading the 39th Army Group, he planned to defect to the Japanese, but before he could do so he was kidnapped and killed by his sworn brother and subordinate Gao Shuxun, who later gained command of this unit. For his many betrayals and defections he is known as the \"Defector General\" () or as Shi Sanfan (, \"Shi who turns coat three times\").D.
