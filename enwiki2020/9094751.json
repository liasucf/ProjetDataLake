Carolina University offers both residential and online programs including dual enrollment, undergraduate, and graduate degrees. It is accredited by the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS), and is a member of the American Association of Christian Schools. ==History== In 1945, Charles Stevens and a group of North Carolina Baptist leaders founded Piedmont Bible Schools, Inc. and opened Piedmont Bible Institute. Three years later, the institute added two years of junior college. Although the academy associated with Piedmont Bible Schools, Inc. was discontinued in 1952, the Bible institute and the college continued. In 1956 Piedmont completed the accreditation requirements of the Accrediting Association of Bible Institutes and Bible Colleges (now The Association for Biblical Higher Education). Their acceptance allowed Religious Education and Theology bachelor's degrees to be awarded, starting in 1957, with the acceptance of the State Department of Education. The college added a graduate program in 1994 and joined the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools (TRACS) one year later. In 2004, Spurgeon Baptist Bible College of Mulberry, Florida merged with PIU to create Piedmont\u2019s Spurgeon School of Online Education, which allowed several undergraduate and graduate programs to be available entirely online, including a master's degree in Biblical Studies offered in Spanish. The accreditation of two international branch campuses in restricted access nations sprang from partnerships with nationals in Asia and the Middle East. In 2012, Piedmont officially changed their name from Piedmont Baptist College and Graduate School to Piedmont International University. In the mid 2010s, three institutions were merged into Piedmont. In 2015, Tennessee Temple University of Chattanooga, Tennessee, dissolved and merged with Piedmont. Southeastern Bible College of Birmingham, Alabama closed in 2017, merging with PIU later that year.

On June 24, 2020, the Piedmont International University Board of Trustees voted to change the university\u2019s name to Carolina University.
