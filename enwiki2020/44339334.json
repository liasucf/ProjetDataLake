    "text": "Rimose is an adjective used to describe a surface that is cracked or fissured.Lichen Glossary, Australian Botanic Garden The term is often used in describing crustose lichens. A rimose surface of a lichen is sometimes contrasted to the surface being areolate. Areolate is an extreme form of being rimose, where the cracks or fissures are so deep that they create island-like pieces called areoles, which look the \"islands\" of mud on the surface of a dry lake bed. Rimose and areolate are contrasted with being verrucose, or \"warty\". Verrucose surfaces have warty bumps which are distinct, but not separated by cracks. ==References== Category:Biology terminology Category:English words Category:Lichens ",
