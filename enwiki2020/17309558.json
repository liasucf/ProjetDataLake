Along with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School, it is a provider of professional ballet training in Canada. Mavis Staines has been the Artistic Director of the school since 1989. == History == ===Formation=== The National Ballet of Canada was formed in 1951 by the English ballet dancer Celia Franca, who had previously been a dancer with ballet companies in the United Kingdom. Franca immigrated to Canada in 1951 and founded the National Ballet of Canada that same year,\"The Pursuit of Perfection: A Life of Celia Franca, by Carol Bishop-Gwyn\".

The existing buildings on the site were restored and redesigned by Goldsmith Borgal & Company Ltd. Architects (GBCA). Three new buildings, dubbed Project Grand Jete, were planned and built by GBCA, along with Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB). Construction began in 2003, and in 2005, the school relocated there. The major expansion to the school was completed in 2007 at a cost of $100 million. 111 Maitland, now known as Currie Hall, became the school's dining hall. ===Notable alumni=== *Frank Augustyn *Neve Campbell *Brennan Clost *Anne Ditchburn *Martine van Hamel *Rex Harrington *Karen Kain *James Kudelka *Martine Lamy *Kevin Pugh *Mavis Staines *Veronica Tennant == Buildings == The Margaret McCain Academic Building was built for and originally housed Havergal Ladies' College from 1898 until 1932, and then housed the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's main radio and television studios in Toronto from 1945 until 1996. Included as part of the school is a heritage building \u2013 the 1856 home of Sir Oliver Mowat, the longest-serving Premier of Ontario, a Father of Confederation, and later Ontario's Lieutenant- Governor. The mansion, originally named Norfield House (used by Havergal College from 1913 to 1932, and then by the CBC), was renamed Lozinski House and now houses the school's artistic and administrative offices. The architectural firms of Goldsmith Borgal & Company Ltd. Architects (GBCA) and Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects (KPMB) integrated the original buildings with three new buildings, using contemporary construction composed of glass, steel, metal panels, and concrete blocks, which appears transparent from the street fa\u00e7ade. The three new buildings were completed in 2007: the Celia Franca Centre, a \"Bar\" building, and a six-storey \"North Tower\" building, which consists of three large studio spaces, each stacked on top of the other. The Celia Franca Centre is used for multiple purposes. Twelve dance studios of various sizes, some of which are facing Jarvis Street, function are visible to passersby.Sobchak, Peter. \"The whole pointe. \" Canadian Interiors 1 Jan 2006: 56-61.
