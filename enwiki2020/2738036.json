    "text": "A serpentine curve is a curve whose equation is of the form :x^2y+a^2y-abx=0, \\quad ab > 0. Equivalently, it has a parametric representation :x=a\\cot(t), y=b\\sin (t)\\cos(t), or functional representation :y=\\frac{abx}{x^2+a^2}. The curve has an inflection point at the origin. It has local extrema at x = \\pm a, with a maximum value of y=b/2 and a minimum value of y=-b/2. ==History== Serpentine curves were studied by L'H\u00f4pital and Huygens, and named and classified by Newton. ==Visual appearance== The serpentine curve for a = b = 1\\. ==External links== * MathWorld \u2013 Serpentine Equation * Category:Curves ",
