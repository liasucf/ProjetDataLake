Roman and Greek traders frequented the ancient Tamil country securing trade with the seafaring Tamil states of the Pandyan, Chola and Chera dynasties and establishing trading settlements which secured trade with South Asia by the Greco-Roman world since the time of the Ptolemaic dynasty a few decades before the start of the Common Era and remained long after the fall of the Western Roman Empire.Curtin 1984: 100 Major ports included Uraiyur, Korkai, Poompuhar and Kaveripattinam.

Durai Raja Singam ==Sea-trade== Container terminal at Chennai port Seashore in Tiruchendur Tamil Nadu has major seaports at Chennai, Ennore, Tuticorin and Nagapattinam. There are 11 other minor ports. Chennai Port is an artificial harbor and is India's second busiest container hub. Because of its shallow waters, Sethusamudramthe sea separating Sri Lanka from Indiapresents a hindrance to navigation through the Palk Strait. Though trade across the India-Sri Lanka divide has been active since at least the first millennium BCE, it has been limited to small boats and dinghies. Larger oceangoing vessels coming from the West have had to navigate around Sri Lanka to reach India' eastern coast. The Sethusamudram Shipping Canal Project is a proposed project to create a shipping route in the shallow straits between India and Sri Lanka which would provide a continuously navigable sea route around the Indian Peninsula. ==Fishing and aquaculture== The state has a fishermen population of 1.05 million and the coast consists of 3 major fishing harbors, 3 medium fishing harbors and 363 fish landing centers. The marine fishing output from the state contributes to 10-12 % of the total marine fish production in India and is estimated at 0.72 million tonnes. Aquaculture include shrimp, sea weed, mussel, clam and oyster farming. There have been several alleged incidents of Sri Lankan Navy personnel firing on Indian fishermen fishing in the Palk Strait, where India and Sri Lanka are only separated by 12 nautical miles.Rumley et al. 2009:166 Indian Government protests periodically against Sri Lankan navy for its alleged involvement in attacks on Indian fishermen. The incidents continue to happen and over 530 fishermen have been killed in the last 30 years. Countries affected by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake ==Weather patterns== The Bay of Bengal is responsible for the formation of some of the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclones in the world. The basin is mostly affected by tropical cyclones. According to official estimates, more than 10,000 people were killed and hundreds of thousands made homeless when a tsunami triggered by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake near the Indonesian island of Sumatra struck the southern coast of Tamil Nadu on 26 December 2004. The earthquake registered 9.1\u20139.3 Mw, and was the largest in five decades. View of marina beach from the lighthouse ==Beaches== There are numerous beaches along the coast. Marina Beach in Chennai covering a distance of , is the longest natural urban beach in the country and the world's second longest. ==Flora and fauna== The Gulf of Mannar Marine National Park is a protected area of India consisting of 21 small islands (islets) and adjacent coral reefs in the Gulf of Mannar. It lies between Thoothukudi and Dhanushkodi. It is the core area of the Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve which includes a 10 km buffer zone around the park, including the populated coastal area. The park has a high diversity of plants and animals in its marine, intertidal and near shore habitats. About 510 (23%) of the 2,200 fin fish species in Indian waters are found in the Gulf, making it the most highly diverse fish habitat in India. ==References== Category:Environment of Tamil Nadu Category:Landforms of Tamil Nadu Category:South India Category:Coasts of India ",
