He scored eight goals in 55 appearances as Stoke reached the play-offs where they lost to Gillingham although he did play in the 2000 Football League Trophy Final where Stoke beat Bristol City 2\u20131 and his performances during the season earn him the player of the year award.

O'Connor playing for Sheffield Wednesday in 2009 His form at the start of the 2006\u201307 season at Burnley was among the best of his career. However, by the start of the 2007\u201308 season he seemed to be relegated to a squad player's role. The departure of Steve Cotterill as Burnley manager brought Owen Coyle in and he immediately restored O'Connor to the starting eleven. O'Connor responded by resuming his previous good form as the team's results improved. He was offered a new contract at the end of the 2007\u201308 season but when O'Connor asked for more time to consider his options, Coyle withdrew the offer and released him. O'Connor confirmed in an interview on BBC Radio Lancashire on 23 May that he was about to start a coaching course before deciding on his future. O'Connor confirmed his move to Championship side Sheffield Wednesday on 27 June 2008 following a month of speculation surrounding the move in the press. He joined the club on a free transfer under the Bosman ruling after turning down the offer to extend his stay at Turf Moor. ==Coaching== On 10 January 2012, O'Connor signed with American third-tier side Orlando City of USL Pro.http://www.orlandocitysoccer.com/news/teamnews/index.html?article_id=626 He became a player-coach in 2013 with the team.
