    "text": "Arturo Tedeschi Arturo Tedeschi (born 24 April 1979) is an Italian architect, computational designer and writer. He's the founder and creative director of the architecture practice and design consulting A>T which promotes a new kind of algorithmic-based design. His design approach includes techniques such as Algorithms-Aided Design (AAD), CNC milling, robotic milling, 3D printing, artificial intelligence, virtual reality. > \"Algorithmic design is not simply the use of computer to design architecture > and objects. Algorithms allow designers to overcome the limitations of > traditional software reaching a level of complexity which is beyond the > human manual ability\" == Biography == Arturo Tedeschi started his career in 2004, combining professional practice in Italy with a personal research on algorithms-aided design, focusing on relationships between architecture and emerging technologies. In 2010 he published Architettura Parametrica, a technical book on computational design translated into English as Parametric Architecture with Grasshopper. In the same year he worked at Zaha Hadid Architects in London. in 2011 he founds the office A>T starting an intense activity both as a designer and consultant for leading firms and industries (architecture, furniture, fashion, footwear, automotive). Among his projects: NU:S Installation at Chiostro Del Bramante (Roma, 2012), Parametric Shoes (Roma, 2012) a project that pushed the boundaries of 3D printing applied to fashion design, The CloudBridge (2013), Ilabo Shoes with Ross Lovegrove (Milano, 2015), In-Formation with Ross Lovegrove (Koln, 2017), Needle Watch (2017), Transmission at Victoria and Albert Museum with Ross Lovegrove (London, 2017), Fessura wall system (Milano, 2017), Alcantara Corner Lounges for Audi with Lovegrove and Colombo (Milano, 2017), Oyster Chair (Milano, 2018), Iris Concept Car (2020), Passerella, a new tram for Milano (2020), HorizON suspension lamp for the Venice Glass Week 2020. In 2014 he published AAD Algorithms-Aided Design, a reference book on algorithmic modelling based on the Grasshopper platform. In 2019 he has been appointed Italian Design Ambassador for the Sydney Design festival within the Italian Design Day 2019 == Teaching == Since 2011 Arturo Tedeschi has been an invited lecturer at universities and conferences worldwide. He taught and lectured at Politecnico di Milano, Architectural Association School of Architecture in London, ISCTE- IUL Lisbon, University of Sydney, Dubai Institute of Design and Innovation, University of Edinburgh, IUAV Venezia, University of Arkansas Rome Center, Universidad Europea (Madrid). Since 2018 he explored new modes of learning and online teaching. == Writings == * 2014 AAD Algorithms-Aided Design, Parametric Strategies using Grasshopper, Edizioni Le Penseur, * 2011 Parametric Architecture with Grasshopper, Edizioni Le Penseur, * 2010 Architettura Parametrica \u2013 Introduzione a Grasshopper (II edizione italiana), Edizioni Le Penseur, * 2010 Architettura Parametrica \u2013 Introduzione a Grasshopper (I edizione italiana), Edizioni Le Penseur, == References == == External links == * Official website * Evento Oltre il BIM * Interview: Arturo Tedeschi *Intervista: Arturo Tedeschi: il BIM per reinterpretare in chiave innovativa *Iris Concept Car on Trendhunter *Recensione AAD Algorithms Aided Design di Arturo Tedeschi Category:1979 births Category:3D printing specialists Category:Living people Category:Italian designers Category:Italian architects ",
