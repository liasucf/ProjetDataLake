Gochanour is known for his work with The Rolling Stones, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Sam Cooke. ==Early life== Gochanour grew up in Moline, Illinois. Gochanour studied film and music at Black Hawk College and played in local rock bands; he also worked in and alternative record shop in Galesburg, IL and was a founding member of The Pine Street Persuaders Blues Band before moving to New York City in 1981. ==Professional Career 1981 - 1989== In New York Gochanour worked in entertainment management, overseeing concert tours for Billy Squier, Tears for Fears, Billy Idol, 10,000 Maniacs and many others. In the late 80s, he worked for Gramavision, and later TVT Records as a Controller assisting with the transition from a novelty label to a roster of indie bands including Nine Inch Nails, The Connells and later Sevendust, Aphex Twin and others. ==1990 - Current== After leaving TVT, he formed MixUp NYC, a recording and production studio. He also toured with Peter Gabriel (Secret World Live), David Bowie (Black Tie, White Noise) and worked on the pre-production of Madonna's The Girlie Show. In 1993 he began his long association with Abkco Records. His most notable works for Abkco includes films for The Rolling Stones, Alejandro Jodorowsky and Sam Cooke. Gochanour also produced and/or directed music videos, commercials and promotional films for The Animals, The Herman's Hermits, Metric, Virgin Air and others. As a sound designer, composer and musical supervisor, he has specialized in nature documentaries for Turner Broadcast, World Wildlife Organization and the Discovery Channel. He composed the soundtrack for T-Rex: New Science, New Beast (2007) for Emmy-winning director Ann Johnson-Prum. His songs have been produced and recorded by artist Ben Green, Jimi Zhivago, Percy Jones and others. ==The Rolling Stones== In 1993 Gochanour was hired as an independent contractor by Abkco Films to produce a trailer for Jean-Luc Godard's newly restored film Sympathy for the Devil. Allen Klein, former manager of The Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke and The Beatles, asked him to research and work on the unfinished, never released The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus. He and Robin Klein (long-time co-producer) were sent to London where they found missing footage of The Who in a storage vault. They spent another 2 years developing, editing and restoring the footage and soundtrack. The film premiered at the 1996 New York Film Festival. For the DVD release in 2004, Mick produced (and directed) an additional 6 hours of supplementary content, including the music video for the Fat Boy Slim remix of \u201cSympathy for the Devil\u201d. In 2008, ABKCO approached director Albert Maysles regarding the coming 40th anniversary of The Rolling Stone's legendary 1969 Madison Square Garden concerts. Mick and Ms. Klein were given access to the outtakes from the 1970 film Gimme Shelter, which included footage from the shows. The resulting film was the short documentary Get Yer Ya Ya\u2019s Out, which featured cameos by Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin and The Grateful Dead. While researching archives for the upcoming 50th anniversary of The Rolling Stones, Mick discovered several hours of unprocessed film shot by Peter Whitehead during their 1965 promotional tour. In 2012 he wrote, produced (uncredited) and directed Ireland 1965 (aka Charlie is My Darling) and also restored Mr. Whitehead's original 35-minute unreleased film. The soundtrack won a Grammy in 2014. ==Alejandro Jodorowsky== Gochanour's familiarity with the abandoned Jodorowsky film project of Genesis\u2019 The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway led to his being a champion for bringing Alejandro's early films Fando y Lis, El Topo and The Holy Mountain back into the public, which were out of circulation and under Abkco Films\u2019 control. He subsequently became co-producer of the restorations in 2002, working closely with the director. They were released in 2004. In early 2013, Alejandro invited Mick and co-producer Robin Klein to Paris where they were given an advanced screening of The Dance of Reality, which led to the acquisition of the film for Abkco. Gochanour won The American Graphics award for the design of the movie poster, which featured the on-set photography of artist Pascal Montondan. ==Sam Cooke== In 2004, Gochanour won a Grammy for his work on Sam Cooke Portrait of a Legend 1951-1964, the first film/video biography of the artist, based on the Peter Guralnick book Dream Boogie. ==Awards== * Won Grammy, along with Mary Wharton and Robin Klein, for Sam Cooke Portrait of a Legend 1951-1964 in the Best Long Form Music Video category. * American Graphics Award 2015 \u2013 The Dance of Reality \u2013 Film Poster * Music DVD Award 2005 \u2013 The Rolling Stones Rock & Roll Circus * Best Music Video 2005 Step100 \u2013 Sympathy for the Devil Remix \u2013 The Rolling Stones/Fat Boy Slim Remix \u2013 producer/director http://chicagotonight.wttw.com/2013/04/18/celebrating-50-years-rolling-stones- music GRAMMY WINNING \u201cCHARLIE\u201d IS JUST DARLING http://www.loveyouliverollingstones.com/grammy-winning-charlie-is-just-darling ==References== ==External links== * *Official website *May 30, 2007 Interview on WNYC Radio *Rolling Stone article: Sept 28, 2012: Inside the Rolling Stones' 'Charlie Is My Darling Documentary Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:American composers Category:American directors Category:Grammy Award winners Category:American producers ",
