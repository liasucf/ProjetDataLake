They reportedly owed the arena $31,000 in expenses, but came to an agreement to cover their debt with the arena taking ownership of all team's property left at the arena. The team continued the season, operated by the league, as a travel-only team and qualified for the championship game against the Mexico City Mexicah with the second place 4\u20133 record.
