Cunningham and Tillis participated in debates on September 13,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics- government/article245731475.html September 22,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/article245929000.html and October 1.https://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics- government/article246141280.html In July, Tillis claimed Cunningham had been \"silent\" on the issue of defunding the police, saying, \"I assume his silence is consent\". In reality, Cunningham had spoken publicly about the issue and written an op-ed a month earlier stating his opposition to defunding the police, advocating police reform instead. On October 3, the New York Times wrote that the race had fallen into \"utter mayhem\" within a period of a few hours after Tillis tested positive for COVID-19 and Cunningham admitted to exchanging romantic text messages with a woman who was not his wife, damaging an image that leaned heavily on his character and military service. Days later, the woman confirmed that she had a consensual physical relationship with Cunningham in 2020. The Army Reserve started an investigation into Cunningham. The husband of the woman who confirmed having an affair with Cunningham, himself an Army veteran, called on Cunningham to drop out of the Senate race. Asked repeatedly whether he had carried on other extramarital affairs, Cunningham declined to answer. Tillis' diagnosis, which came after an outbreak at a White House ceremony for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett, temporarily threw Barrett's confirmation into jeopardy, as two Republican senators had already stated their intention to vote against. ===Predictions=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" !Source !Ranking !As of |- | align=\"left\" |538 | |October 6, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Economist | |October 6, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Daily Kos | | October 6, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |DDHQ | |October 5, 2020 |- | align=left | Inside Elections | |October 1, 2020 |- | align=left | Sabato's Crystal Ball | | October 1, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |RCP | |September 27, 2020 |- | align=left | The Cook Political Report | |September 23, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Niskanen | |September 15, 2020 |- | align=\"left\" |Politico | |September 9, 2020 |} ===Endorsements=== ===Fundraising=== In the first quarter of 2020, Cunningham outraised Tillis for the first time, receiving $4.4 million compared to the $2.1 million Tillis raised.
