    "text": "Patricia Hooker (17 February 1933 \u2013 2001) was an Australian writer who worked extensively in England. She wrote for TV, radio and the stage. She wrote The Golden Road, the first play on British television that was both written by a woman and about a lesbian relationship. ==Biography== She grew up in the town of Port Lincoln in South Australia and trained as a stenographer. She began writing in her spare time and her work began appearing in amateur theatres. She worked as a secretary at the Stevedoring Commission in Sydney and also as a court reporter. Hooker was working as a shorthand typist in a city office in 1959 when she wrote the story for The Little Woman at home in the evenings. She wrote it as a stage play and it was included in a night of one-act plays at the Genesian Theatre. To help it reach a wider audience, Patricia studied a book on TV technique and decided to revise the script as a TV play. The ABC produced it in 1961 by which time she was at the ABC as a script assistant. She moved to London in 1964 and worked as a court reporter as well as writing for TV and radio. ==Select credits== *A Bird in a Gilded Cage (1957) \u2013 TV play *The Little Woman (1961) \u2013 TV play *Twilight of a Hero (1962) \u2013 radio play about King David's love for Absalom *Poet's Corner (1962) - radio writer *Concord of Sweet Sounds (1963) \u2013 TV play and adapted for radio *George (1964) - lunch hour play from short story by Anthony West *A Season in Hell (1964) \u2013 TV play \u2013 later adapted for radio *Man of Blood (1964) - play *The Winged Chariot (1967) - radio play about Socrates *The Lotus Eaters (1968) \u2013 play *Counterstrike (1969) \u2013 TV series *A Fit and Proper Person (1970) - TV play *Kate (1971-73) - TV series *Last Seen Wearing (1972) - radio play *Harriets Back in Town (1972-73) - TV series *Harriet's Back in Town (1973) \u2013 TV series *Armchair Theatre - \"The Golden Road\" (1973) - TV play *Crown Court (1973) - TV series *The Beauty of the World (1973) - radio play *Simon Fenton's Story (1973) - TV play *\"Going to St Ives\" (1973) - TV play *Six Days of Justice (1973\u201375) \u2013 TV series *The Carnforth Practice (1974) \u2013 TV series *Rooms (1975) \u2013 TV series *Angels (1976) \u2013 TV series - episode \"Off Duty\" *The Gentle Touch (1980) \u2013 \"Chance\", \"Rogue\" *Plays for Pleasure \u2013 \"The Concubine\" (1981) \u2013 Tv episode *Survival (1989) - radio play *Right Ho Jeeves (1989) - radio play *Seven Against Reeves (1989) - radio play ==References== ==External links== * *Patricia Hooker at AustLit *production of Pat Hooker's plays at AusStage *Biographical information Category:Australian women dramatists and playwrights Category:1933 births Category:2001 deaths Category:20th-century Australian dramatists and playwrights Category:Writers from South Australia Category:People from Port Lincoln, South Australia Category:20th-century Australian women writers ",
