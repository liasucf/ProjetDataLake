The video featured Gina in a giant globe being watched over by a scientist. Following the release of this single, Gina entered a lengthy High Court legal battle against Steve Rodway of Motiv8 over royalties from Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bithttp://www.musicweek.com/news/read/gina-g-ex-label-boss-hit-by- legal-bill/025911 and against a contract with Rodway's company FX Musichttp://www.musicweek.com/news/read/gina-g-ex-label-boss-hit-by-legal- bill/025911 which had tied her into a binding contract resulting in her being unable to record musichttp://esctoday.com/67300/uk-interview-with-gina-g- part-1/ except for FX Music which according to Gina, since September 1997, had failed or refused to agree on tracks to be recorded for a second album \"within a reasonable time or at all\".https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/whos- suing-whom-eurovision-star-sues-record-label-over-contract- dispute-1182295.html Whilst Gina was ultimately successful, the time out of the music industry and the inability to capitalise on the success of the Fresh! album with a follow up damaged her career and it would be another nine years until she released another single. ===Track listings=== UK: CD Maxi (WEA0143CD) #Every Time I Fall (Radio Version) (4:01) #Every Time I Fall (Todd Terry Radio Mix) (3:26) #Every Time I Fall (Todd Terry's Pop Mix) 3:25 #Every Time I Fall (Metro's Eurobeat Mix) (5:46) #Every Time I Fall (Gina's Dub (Todd Terry Mix)) (7:36) Other versions: *Every Time I Fall (Gina's Acid Dub (Todd Terry Mix)) (7:15) - from the vinyl 12\" release ==Tonight's The Night== ===Release=== Tonight's The Night was Gina's first single release in nine years following a long legal battle with her old producer that resulted in her losing her contract with Warner Music. This was not the first new track since the Fresh! album by Gina though. In 2003 she contributed two songs to the Re- born in the USA soundtrack following her appearance on the TV show of the same name, as well as recording an unreleased cover of These Boots Are Made For Walking and vocals for two tracks for an album by Soda Club. In 2004 she recorded vocals for a track entitled Heaven produced by Elemental which was released on promotional vinyl with new mixes of Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit and in 2005 recorded a song called Flashback which was entered as a potential (yet ultimately unsuccessful) entry for the UK for the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest. Both Heaven and Flashback featured on a new album Get Up And Dance released independently through Gina's website in 2005 (one of the new remixes of Ooh Aah... Just A Little Bit also featured on the album. An ultimately unreleased version of Tonight's The Night was planned to be on Get Up And Dance but replaced at the last moment by a track called Into The Night. Instead the song was released by Gina's own label Stunt Girl Music and distributed by Universal in 2006. An initial set of remixes were commissioned though most of these were not commercially released. A bonus track Undone appeared on one of the CD releases. Despite promising club play, the song reached #57 in the charts, spending just one further week in the UK Top 200. Whilst a second single was planned, this never materialized. ===Track listings=== UK: CD Maxi #Tonight's The Night (Radio Edit) (3:31) #Tonight's The Night (Point 4 Extended 12\" Remix) (6:06) #Tonight's The Night (Moto Blanco 12\") (6:59) #Tonight's The Night (Klub Kids Klub Mix) (6:47) #Tonight's The Night (Moto Blanco Radio Edit) (3:17) #Tonight's The Night (Kuta Mix 12\") (7:00) #Tonight's The Night (Moto Blanco Dub) (6:20) #Tonight's The Night (Video on CD Rom) UK: CD #Tonight's The Night (Radio Edit) (3:31) #Undone (3:37) Other versions: *Tonight's The Night (12\" Original Mix) (6:29) *Tonight's The Night (12\" Night Club Mix) (7:18) *Tonight's The Night (12\" Latino Night Mix) (7:27) *Tonight's The Night (12\" Night Club Dub) (7:26) *Tonight's The Night (7\" Club Mix Edit) (3:29) *Tonight's The Night (7\" Original Mix) (3:25) ==Next 2 You== ===Release=== Next 2 You (originally titled 'Next 2 U') was the first and only single from a planned third album. The song originally appeared on Gina's Myspace pagehttp://www.popjustice.com/forum/threads/14148-Gina-G-New-EP-Coming-Soon in 2009 along with a track called Re-Invented and two versions of a track named Friday. These tracks were originally planned to be released as an EP but this never materialized. Instead Next 2 U was tweaked and released to iTunes in June 2011 and a video later appeared on YouTube. Both of these were later taken down with a new video and remix package for the UK market released in Autumn 2011. The new version featured British rapper Vigilante and a further new track Set The Night On Fire was performed at G-A-Y. The track ultimately failed to chart and despite other material recorded for a third album, nothing more was released, marking Next 2 You as Gina's last single release. ===Track listings=== UK: Digital Download #Next 2 You (Radio Edit) (4:00) #Next 2 You (Club Junkies Remix) (7:23) #Next 2 You (Mind Electric Club Mix) (6:27) #Next 2 You (Mind Electric Dub Mix) (5:55) Other versions: *Next 2 U (Original Version) (3:22) *Next 2 You (Peewee Ferris Club Mix) (7:41) *Next 2 You (Loud Manners Radio Edit) (3:42) *Next 2 You (Loud Manners Extended Mix) (6:45) ==References== G, Gina ",
