The metsuke were charged with the special duty of detecting and investigating instances of maladministration, corruption or disaffection anywhere in Japan; and particularly amongst the populace having status below the daimy\u014d.Beasley, William G. (1955). Select Documents on Japanese Foreign Policy, 1853\u20131868, p. 326. ==Intelligence gathering== The shogunate recognized the need for some kind of internal intelligence-gathering apparatus and for some degree of covert espionage within its own ranks. It could be said that the metsuke functioned as the Shogun's intelligence agency or as internal spies, reporting to the officials in Edo on events and situations across the country.Cunningham, Don. (2004). Taiho-jutsu: Law and Order in the Age of the Samurai, p. 39. The metsuke were charged with focusing on those ranking below daimy\u014d-status; and their counterparts, the \u014dmetsuke, were responsible for supervising the activities of officials and members of the daimy\u014d (feudal lords). Although similarly engaged, the reporting protocols of the metsuke and \u014dmetsuke differed. The metsuke reported to wakadoshiyori who ranked just below the r\u014dj\u016b. The \u014dmetsuke reported directly to the four or five r\u014dj\u016b at the top of the shogunate bureaucracy. By design, the intelligence-gathering activities of the metsuke was intended to complement those of the \u014dmetsuke even though there was no official reporting relationship between the two somewhat independent groups. There were at any given time as many as twenty-four metsuke. ==Ad hoc evolution== The bureaucracy of the Tokugawa shogunate expanded on an ad hoc basis, responding to perceived needs and changing circumstances. Sometimes one or more of the metsuke or \u014dmetsuke would have been selected to address a specific or even a unique problem. For example, Arao Norimasa in the period from 1852 through 1854 was charged with special duties as kaibo-gakari-metsuke.Beasley, p. 341. The prefix kaib\u014d-gakari meaning \"in charge of maritime defense\" was used with the titles of some bakufu officials after 1845. This term was used to designate those who bore a special responsibility for overseeing coastal waters, and by implication, for dealing with matters involving foreigners. \"Kaib\u014d-gakari-metsuke\" later came to be superseded by the term gaikoku-gakari.Beasley, p. 323. These developments preceded the Gaikoku bugy\u014d system which began just prior to the negotiations which resulted in the Harris Treaty.Cullin, L.M. (2003). A History of Japan, 1582-1941, p. 185. First appointed in August 1858, the gaikoku-bugy\u014d were bakufu officials who were charged with advising the government on foreign affairs and who were tasked with conducting negotiations with foreign diplomats both in Japan and abroad. ==In popular culture== The post of metsuke was, of course, not immune to corruption; and sometimes the conduct of these officials could be affected by bribes. For example, the televised jidaigeki episodes of Abarenb\u014d Sh\u014dgun are rife with petty corruption, including a broad range of officials across the span of television seasons. Metsuke also appear as persecutors of Japanese Christians in the film Silence (2016).http://www.periodistadigital.com/guiacultural/ocio-y- cultura/2017/01/08/silencio-de-martin-scorsese-cine.shtml Metsuke are also portrayed by the game Total War: Shogun 2 as agents who try and imprison members of an enemy clan, as well as looking over settlements if needed. ==List of metsuke== * Matsudaira Chikano (1841\u20131844)Beasley, p. 335. * Ido Staohiro (1842\u20131845)Beasley, p. 332. * Arao Narimasa (1852\u20131854)Beasley, p. 331. * Nagai Naomune (1853\u20131858)Beasley, p. 338. * Iwase Tadanari (1854\u20131858)Beasley, p. 333. * Oguri Tadamasa (1859\u20131860) * Ikeda Nagaaki (1862\u20131863, 1863) * Kawada Hiroshi (1864)Beasley, p. 334. * Kurimoto Sebei (1864\u20131865) ==Notes== ==References== * Beasley, William G.
