    "text": "Gaby Rado (17 January 1955, Budapest - 30 March 2003, Sulaymaniyah, Iraq) was a British television journalist who died in Iraq during the 2003 invasion. ==Life== G\u00e1bor Andr\u00e1s Rado was born in Budapest, Hungary but emigrated with his family to Britain at the age of eight. He studied at King's College School, Wimbledon, London and Christ's College, Cambridge and began work in journalism at The Kentish Times, a local newspaper. He then joined BBC Radio Leicester working as a reporter, then moved into television news at Thames News before rejoining the BBC at Television Centre, Shepherds Bush as a producer. He moved to ITN in 1985 as a writer before transferring to ITN's Channel 4 News in 1988. He was a high-profile foreign correspondent at Channel 4 News, serving as Moscow correspondent. He worked in Bosnia during the war there, including Srebrenica, and subsequently covered the trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, work which won him two of his three Amnesty International awards. He also covered the war in Afghanistan and the status of the Uyghur in western China. Rado was working in Iraq during the war when he died. It is believed that he fell from the roof of the Abu Sanaa hotel in Sulaymaniyah, northern Iraq, into the car park below where he was found in what appeared to be an accident unconnected with any military activity. He was given first aid but was pronounced dead at the nearby hospital. Rado was the second ITN journalist to die in Iraq in the same month, with his fellow reporter, Terry Lloyd, killed after coming under fire. Gaby Rado had three children by his first wife, Carol Rado. He lost his middle son in a swimming accident in 1991. He met his second wife, Desa, whilst on assignment in Serbia. The Amnesty Media Awards now include a category in memory of Gaby Rado, which recognises a journalist who has been covering human rights issues for less than five years. ==External links== *Channel 4 Obituary *Rado Among Several Journalists Killed, Missing - IFEX Category:1955 births Category:2003 deaths Category:Accidental deaths from falls Category:Accidental deaths in Iraq Category:Alumni of Christ's College, Cambridge Category:English male journalists Category:Hungarian emigrants to England Category:People educated at King's College School, London Category:Journalists from Budapest Category:ITN newsreaders and journalists Category:Journalists killed while covering the Iraq War ",
