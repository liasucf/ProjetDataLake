He spent four years in Ibadan, Nigeria, alternating with training posts at the Royal Postgraduate Medical School with Professor Goodwin; this resulted in a number of papers on African heart diseases. On his return he switched to psychiatry, with training at the Maudsley Hospital. He worked with the late Robert Evan Kendell on schizoaffective disorders and wrote a series of papers on the nosology of the psychoses. As Senior Lecturer at the Victoria University of Manchester he developed an interest in mother\u2013infant psychiatry. After visiting professorships in Chicago and St Louis, he was appointed to the Chair of Psychiatry at the University of Birmingham. There he developed a community-based clinical service for mothers, backed by an inpatient mother and baby unit and day hospital. He had sabbaticals as Cottman Fellow in Monash University, and locum tenens consultant at the mother and baby unit in Christchurch, New Zealand. == Professional associations == He helped to found, and was the first President of, the Marc\u00e9 Society, and founded the Section on Women's Mental Health in the World Psychiatric Association.

Oxford Medical Publications, Oxford University Press. Menstrual psychosis is a medical condition that Brockinton proposed for a periodic display of psychosis with acute onset in a particular phase of the menstrual cycle. It is proposed as a form of severe mental illness, whose clinical features resemble those of the common form of postpartum psychosis; since most cases are considered to belong to the bipolar disorder spectrum, it is not a \"disease in its own right\". The literature describes nearly 200 proposed cases as of 2020. Episodes of menstrual psychosis have a sudden onset in a previously asymptomatic person, and are usually of brief duration, with full recovery. In most patients, Brockington states that menstrual psychosis is a self-limiting disorder, affecting only a small proportion of the 400 menstrual cycles in a woman\u2019s life. ==References== === Book sources === * Category:1935 births Category:Living people Category:British psychiatrists Category:Academics of the University of Birmingham Category:Place of birth missing (living people) Category:British expatriates in Nigeria Category:Academics of the University of Manchester Category:British academics Category:British expatriates in the United States ",
