    "text": "N\u00e9lson Alexandre Gomes Pereira, known simply as N\u00e9lson (, born 20 October 1975), is a Portuguese retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper. ==Club career== N\u00e9lson was born in Torres Vedras, Lisbon. He started his football career with hometown club S.C.U. Torreense, and was primarily used as a backup at Sporting CP, first to Peter Schmeichel then to Ricardo, for nearly a decade. His best output for the Lions came in the 2002\u201303 season after both had left the Est\u00e1dio Jos\u00e9 Alvalade, playing 19 Primeira Liga matches in an eventual third-place finish, 27 points behind champions FC Porto. After 2005\u201306, N\u00e9lson moved to Vit\u00f3ria FC, but due to unpaid wages \u2013 a recurring problem in the club for the past seasons prior to his arrival \u2013 he left the sadinos, being out of work for almost six months before joining another Lisbon side, C.F. Estrela da Amadora, in July 2007. Estrela would be relegated at the end of the 2008\u201309 campaign after continuing financial problems, even though it finished in mid-table, and N\u00e9lson subsequently moved to neighbours C.F. Os Belenenses. He suffered an injury in training in December 2009, and never played again as the Est\u00e1dio do Restelo side finished second from bottom and dropped down a division; aged nearly 35, he chose to retire, but returned to his main club Sporting the following year as goalkeeping coach. ==International career== N\u00e9lson was capped three times for Portugal, all in 2002, making his debut on 27 March in a 1\u20134 friendly loss to Finland in Porto; he came on as a half-time substitute and conceded the last goal. After Quim was sent home for failing a drugs test, he was picked as third-choice for that year's FIFA World Cup. ==Honours== Sporting *Primeira Liga: 1999\u20132000, 2001\u201302 *Ta\u00e7a de Portugal: 2001\u201302 ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:People from Torres Vedras Category:Portuguese footballers Category:Association football goalkeepers Category:Primeira Liga players Category:LigaPro players Category:Portuguese Second Division players Category:S.C.U.
