It was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Short. A Place in the Land considers the history of conservation stewardship in America as reflected in the property of Billings Farm, an operating dairy farm first established in 1871, and the Mount Tom, as well as through the work of George Perkins Marsh, Frederick Billings, and Laurance Rockefeller who were successive residents of the estate. The documentary is shown daily at the visitor center for the Billings Farm & Museum and the Marsh-Billings-Rockefeller National Historical Park. The National Park Service and the American Memory project of the Library of Congress served as advisers to the Woodstock Foundation in the production of the film. ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1998 films Category:1998 documentary films Category:1998 short films Category:American films Category:American independent films Category:American documentary films Category:Documentary films about agriculture in the United States Category:English-language films Category:Films directed by Charles Guggenheim Category:Nature conservation in the United States Category:Short documentary films ",
