    "text": "Uppsala Eventcenter is a planned multi-purpose indoor arena in Uppsala, Sweden. Once completed, it will become the ice hockey team Almtuna IS's home arena. It will have a capacity of 6,800 people during ice hockey games. There have been concerns that building the arena next to Gr\u00e4nby centrum might destroy the habitat of newts. The slope where the arena is planned is thought to function as an dwelling place for newts during winter and is therefore included in a consideration zone () for newts. Number of small dams have been built in the area previously to avoid the already threatened newts from disappearing from the zone. Although the arena, as its current name suggests, was intended to be used for other activities than sports, it has since been decided in August 2018 that the arena will only be designed and used for sports. ==References== Category:Indoor arenas in Sweden Category:Indoor ice hockey venues in Sweden Category:Ice hockey venues in Sweden Category:Proposed indoor arenas Category:Buildings and structures in Uppsala Category:Sport in Uppsala Category:Proposed buildings and structures in Sweden ",
