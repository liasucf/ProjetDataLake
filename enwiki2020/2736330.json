    "text": "Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi (Hebrew title: Ha-Kochavim Shel Shlomi, Shlomi's Stars) is a 2003 film written and directed by Shemi Zarhin. The story is about a 16-year-old Israeli boy, named Shlomi. Who cares for everyone in his life but himself. Shlomi lives with his jealous and pretentious mother, his soldier brother, and their elderly grandfather. Although not doing well in school, Shlomi is a gifted cook and takes care of most household chores, while all the grownups around him are busy with their childish affairs, neglect him, and ignore his dyslexia. Shlomi tries to be invisible, especially at school, until a routine math test catches the attention of Shlomi's teacher, who suspects that a unique gift lies behind that dormant facade. The school's headmaster takes Shlomi under his wing, and Shlomi blossoms. ==Main cast== *Oshri Cohen - Shlomi Bar-Dayan *Arieh Elias - Grandfather Bar-Dayan *Esti Zakheim - Ruhama Bar-Dayan, the mother *Aya Koren - Rona *Yigal Naor - Aviho, the headmaster * - Robert Bar-Dayan, the father and Ruhama's Ex-husband * - Doron Bar-Dayan, the brother *Rotem Abuhab - Ziva, the sister *Asi Cohen - Tzachi, the brother- in-law and Ziva's husband ==Soundtrack== Original Score - Jonathan Bar Giora Theme song - Od Avo Music:Jonathan Bar Giora lyrics: Nathan Alterman Performed by Chaim Uliel ==References== ==External links== * * Original Soundtrack Category:2003 films Category:2003 comedy-drama films Category:Israeli films Category:Hebrew-language films Category:Israeli comedy-drama films ",
