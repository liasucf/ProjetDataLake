Lipa was a fan of Miguel, and with her management reached out to Miguel for a studio session. They ended up writing the song in Los Angeles, as one of the last songs for Lipa's eponymous debut album. Lipa described it as \"one of the happiest\" songs from the album while also commenting on its meaning saying \"it's about that feeling you get at the beginning of a relationship and those crazy emotions and getting lost in the middle of it all.\" The song was recorded at Paramount Studios in Los Angeles, while vocals were recorded at TaP Studio / Strongroom 7 in London. \"Lost in Your Light\" is a retro dance- pop, electropop, power pop, R&B-pop;, and synth-pop song. The song is composed in time and the key of D major, with a tempo of 118 beats per minute. The verses, choruses and middle eight follow a chord progression of G\u2013G/A\u2013A\u2013A/B\u2013Bm/D\u2013D/F\u2013Em7, while the bridges follow a F\u2013Bm\u2013Em\u2013A sequence. The R&B; production includes electro rhythms, percussion-heavy techno beats, strutting grooves, a disco-tinged sway, throbbing synths, and funky drum kit flourishes. The chorus contains dreamy harmonies, punchy percussion and hazy synths. The hip hop bridge unexpectedly changes the song, with the singers nearly rapping triplet rhythms over programmed beats. Lipa and Miguel harmonize with soulful vocals, spanning from A3 to F5. Ben Hogwood of musicOMH labelled its meaning a \"mutual declaration of love\", while The Faders Olivia Craighead stated it is about \"complete infatuation\". ==Release and promotion== \"Lost in Your Light\" was released for digital download and streaming on 21 April 2017 in various countries by Warner Bros.

Maxwell Cavaseno praised Lipa's aim for the \"Laura Branigan of 21st-century dance-rock.\" Ryan Reed from Rolling Stone regarded the song as \"seductive\" and Miguel's appearance as \"passionate.\" The song was also placed at number 34 on Rolling Stones \"50 Best Songs of 2017\" list, with the publication writing that it is \"a starlit rollerskating jam about love's all-consuming joys,\" as well as saying the song \"gets its kicks from its depths-plumbing groove and the crazy-in-love vocals of its two principals.\" \"Lost in Your Light\" debuted and peaked at number 86 on the UK Singles Chart issue dated 28 April 2017.
