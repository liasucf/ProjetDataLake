The play's main character is Prospero, who is male in the original play. Taymor explained the casting decision, \"I didn't really have a male actor that excited me in mind, and yet there had been a couple of phenomenal females - Helen Mirren being one of them - who [made me think]: 'My God, does this play change? What happens if you make that role into a female role?'\" Taymor held a reading and found that the story could accommodate the change of gender without being gimmicky. In Shakespeare's play, Prospero was the Duke of Milan. In the adaptation, Prospera is the wife of the Duke. She is \"more overtly wronged\" than Prospero; when the duke dies, Prospera's brother Antonio (played by Chris Cooper) accuses her of killing him with witchcraft. Antonio makes the accusation to be rid of Prospera and claim her royal title. Taymor said, \"She had her whole life taken away from her because she was a woman.\" Prospera wants to prevent the same thing from happening to her daughter. Principal photography took place around volcanic areas of the big island of Hawaii and Lanai.(December 13, 2010), \"The Tempest\".

Entertainment Weekly. (1133):65 USA Today found that \"Mirren keeps the film on track. But incomprehensible shouting and pointless shenanigans obscure subtle moments.\"Puig, Claudia (December 10, 2010). \"Shakespeare Gets Lost in 'Tempest'\". USA Today. In a similar vein, Newsweek said \"the film's special effects, to a surprising extent, add little to the story\", and that \"next to the concise power of [Shakespeare's] language, the screen wizardry of even a resourceful director like Taymor seems like rough magic indeed\".McCarter, Jeremy (December 6, 2010), \"THE ONE...If You Need to Brush Up on Your Shakespeare\". Newsweek. 156' (23):52-53 However, The New Yorkers David Denby pointed out the film's strengths, most particularly Helen Mirren's performance as Prospera: \"Mirren has the range and power to play a woman with unprecedented control of the elements, and over men, too.\"David Denby, The New Yorker review of The Tempest . Sandra Hall in The Sydney Morning Herald is more generous toward Taymor's vision, saying, \"In the scene that explains the circumstances of mother and daughter's banishment from the dukedom of Milan, Taymor has skillfully tweaked Shakespeare's lines to take account of her new scenario\", and praising the film's visual elements.The Sydney Morning Herald review of The Tempest. === Accolades === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font- size: 95%;\" |- !
