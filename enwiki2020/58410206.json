In September 2018, he made his debut for the Denmark national team, as the regular squad withdrew following a players' union dispute. In the Danish media, he became known for his skills in Counter- Strike and his love for gardening in his spare time.https://ekstrabladet.dk/plus/sportogspil/laer-alt-om-det-nye-landshold- bartender-gymnasieelev-og-bendtners-stoerste-fan/7293470 He was also a part of the strong Johannesskolen team, who won the Danish championship for primary schools in 2011.https://ekstrabladet.dk/skolefodbold/finalen/article4085958.ece ==International career== In September 2018, the Danish Football Association and players' union were scheduled to sign a new national team agreement for the players of the Denmark national team prior to a friendly against Slovakia and their opening UEFA Nations League match against Wales. However, a contract dispute arose regarding the commercial rights of the players, resulting in a failure to sign a new agreement. Despite an offer from the squad to extend the previous deal to allow for further negotiations, the DBU instead named an entirely uncapped squad under the temporary management of coach John Jensen to avoid punishment from UEFA for cancelling the matches. The squad consisted of a mixture of players from the Danish 2nd Division and the Denmark Series (the third and fourth tier of Danish football respectively), along with futsal players from the Denmark national futsal team. On 4 September 2018, H\u00f8ybye was one of 24 players to be named in the replacement squad. The following day, he made his international debut in the friendly match against Slovakia, starting the match before coming off in the 61st minute for Adam Fogt. The match finished as a 0\u20133 away loss. ==Career statistics== ===International=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !colspan=3|Denmark |- !Year!!Apps!!Goals |- |2018||1||0 |- !Total!!1!!0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * Category:1996 births Category:Living people Category:Danish footballers Category:Denmark international footballers Category:Association football midfielders Category:Br\u00f8nsh\u00f8j BK players Category:Vanl\u00f8se IF players Category:FC Roskilde players Category:Hellerup IK players Category:Danish 1st Division players Category:Danish 2nd Division players ",
