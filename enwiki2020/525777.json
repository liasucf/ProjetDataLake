    "text": "Katherine is a town in the Northern Territory of Australia. It is situated on the Katherine River (after which it is named) below the \"Top End\", southeast of Darwin. It is the fourth largest settlement in the Territory and is known as the place where \"The outback meets the tropics\". Katherine had an urban population of approximately 6,300 at the 2016 Census. Katherine is also the closest major town to RAAF Base Tindal located 17 km southeast and provides education, health, local government services and employment opportunities for the families of Defence personnel stationed there. In the , the base had a residential population of 857, with only around 20% of the workforce engaged in employment outside of defence, the majority commuting to work in Katherine. Katherine is also the central hub of the great \"Savannah Way\" which stretches from Cairns in north QLD to Broome in the Kimberley WA.Australia's Adventure Drive Savannah Way Ltd Beginning as an outpost established with the Australian Overland Telegraph Line on the North-South transport route between Darwin and Adelaide, Katherine has grown with the development of transport and local industries including mining \u2013 particularly gold mining; a strategic military function with RAAF Base Tindal; also as a tourism gateway to the attractions of nearby Nitmiluk National Park, particularly Nitmiluk (Katherine) Gorge and its many ancient rock paintings. The region is known to experience heavy flooding during the wet season. == History == The first inhabitants of the area were Indigenous Australian tribes, specifically the Dagoman people, Jawoyn people and Wardaman people. It was important meeting place for these tribes and remains a place of convergence. Today the Walpiri People from the Victoria River District and Tanami Desert areas now have a dedicated community based at Katherine East. Explorer John McDouall Stuart passed through the area in 1862 on his successful third journey across the continent from north to south. On 4 July 1862, Stuart crossed the Katherine River (90 km upstream from the present town) and recorded in his diary: \"Came upon another large creek, having a running stream to the south of west and coming from the north of east. This I have named 'Katherine', in honour of the second daughter of pastoralist James Chambers Esq.\" There is some conjecture over Stuart's accuracy. Chambers's wife's name was Katherine but, according to most sources, his daughter's name was Catherine.Katherine Town Council: About Katherine . Retrieved on 15 December 2008 Josiah Thomas, Sir Walter Barettelot and Dr. John Gilruth of the Federal Parliamentary Party visiting Katherine Telegraph Station in 1912|thumb|right Katherine Telegraph Station was established on 22 August 1872 and the completion of the Overland Telegraph Line later in 1872, and the town began with a small permanent population on the west side of the Katherine River. Katherine benefited from the proximity to nearby gold fields including Pine Creek 90 kilometres to the north. Gold was discovered 50 kilometres to the north in 1889 at Mount Todd. The North Australia Railway was extended to Katherine with construction beginning in 1923 of the Katherine railway bridge. During construction of the railway, the town's centre was relocated to the eastern side of the river. The bridge was completed in 1926 and the first train crossed on 21 January 1926. On 15 July 1926, the town's present site was gazetted. The original post office and the Overland Telegraph station were set just above Knott's Crossing and next to the Sportsman's Arms Hotel that had quarters for the station master at the Overland Telegraph station and a single room police station. During World War II, the Australian Army set up two hospitals around Katherine, the 101st Australian General Hospital and 121st Australian General Hospital. The army also set up a Katherine Area Headquarters. On 22 March 1942, Katherine sustained its only air raid during World War II. One man was killed when a Japanese aircraft bombed the town. The river flooded the town in 1957, 1974, 1998 and a minor flood in 2006. Mining production has declined since the closure of the mine at Mount Todd (50 kilometres to the north) in 2000. Construction began on a new rail line in July 2001. On 13 September 2003, the line was finished with a continuous track from Adelaide, South Australia to Darwin. The Ghan passenger train service commenced on 4 February 2004 running several times a week and stopping on both the northbound and southbound journeys. The April 2006 floods placed parts of the town under water (including about 50 houses), caused millions of dollars of damage, and resulted in the declaration of a state of emergency on 7 April.The AgeThe Age (www.theage.com.au) However, there were no reports of the flooding causing structural damage.ABC NewsABC News (www.abc.net.au) Town residents were given warning that the river might flood on 5 April, and the town centre was underwater before noon the next day.ABC News ABC News (www.abc.net.au) The floodwaters reached a peak of nearly 19 metres at the Katherine River bridge. Dozens of homes were inundated with up to 2 m of water, with many residents having time to escape with little more than the clothes they were wearing. Over the weekend of 8\u20139 April, more than 1,100 people went to the evacuation centres in the town. The state of emergency was lifted on 9 April. In recent decades, Katherine has developed as a regional centre supporting the cattle, horticulture, agriculture and tourism industries. Located at the junction of major tourism drives, Central Arnhem Road, the Savannah Way and the Explorers Way, Katherine is an important visitor gateway for the Northern Territory. . On Australia Day in 1998 a major flood devastated the town, and the area was declared a national disaster. The flood resulted from the 300\u2013400 mm of rainwater brought by Cyclone Les that caused the already full Katherine River to peak at 20.4 metres. The floodwaters inundated the town and much of the surrounding region, requiring the evacuation of many residents. The flood covered an area of 1000 square kilometres, affected 1100 homes and cut off many roads in and out of Katherine. Three people drowned.\"Tropical Cyclone Les\", Bureau of Meteorology ==Population== According to the 2016 census of Population, there were 6,303 people in Katherine. * Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 25.4% of the population. * 66.2% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were Philippines 2.9%, New Zealand 1.8% and England 1.7%. * 64.3% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Kriol at 3.5%. * The most common response for religion was No Religion at 31.1%. == Geography and climate == === Topography === Edith Falls at the end of the wet season Katherine is located 320 km south of Darwin, and is situated on the banks of the Katherine River, which is part of the Daly River system. The upper reaches rise into the Arnhem Land escarpment and Kakadu, to the northeast. The Victoria River (The Northern Territory's largest river system) is situated 189 km south-west of Katherine along the Victoria Highway. Katherine is at the crossroads of the Outback due to its location between the Darwin region, Kakadu National Park, the Barkley Region, the Gulf of Carpentaria and the Kimberley region of Western Australia. Flora River Nature Park The topography of the region is predominantly dry tropical savanna woodlands and consists of plains, hills, rock outcrops. To the east lies Koombolgie sandstone escarpments and spectacular gorges through Nitmiluk National Park. The township itself is set among relatively flat plains along the Katherine River within the Tindall / Oolloo Aquifers, dotted with rugged Karst limestone formations, caves and jagged outcrops. Numerous mesas (flat- topped hills or \"Jump-ups\") emerge south-west of Katherine on surrounding cattle stations. === Climate === Spectacular wet season electrical storms over Katherine Gorge Katherine experiences a dry tropical savanna climate (K\u00f6ppen climate classification Aw) with distinct wet and dry seasons. Daily temperatures in the wet season typically range from 30 \u00b0C to 37 \u00b0C, reaching over 40 \u00b0C from late September to late November. Very high humidity accompanies high temperatures during the build-up period to the wet season, when the region receives spectacular electrical storms. The wet season monsoon period is a dramatic time of year, from large thunderstorms and heavy downpours to the transitions of lush greenery appearing from the parched deciduous landscapes of the dry season. Katherine experiences around 50 thunderstorm days per year, most of which occur from November to April. In the dry, the nights can get quite cool, regularly dropping to 7 \u00b0C overnight around June and July. Humidity levels are much lower from June to August and hence this has become the most popular time for visitors who wish to explore the region. Most parks and roads are accessible during the dry season, whereas the wet season often causes accessibility restrictions. Low elevation relative to surrounding areas, as well as the town's situation on the banks of a river, means that the area is prone to flooding. A flood on Australia Day in 1998 was particularly destructive. Ex-Tropical Cyclone Les produced between 300 and 400 millimetres of rainfall during a 48-hour period, causing the Katherine River to rise to 21.3 metres and claim the lives of three people. === Districts === The central business district of Katherine is set 350 metres from the banks of the Katherine River. The township services the regional centres of Pine Creek, Mataranka, Borooloola, Daly River and Timber Creek. The RAAF Tindal Base is located 17 km from Katherine and plays a significant role in the local economy. Tindal Airbase officially opened on 1 October 1988. Katherine is quite a large city by its land area, despite the low combined population of around 10,000 people. The Katherine Town Council (municipality) Zone extends from Flora River Junction in the West to Maranboy in the East and from the Fergusson River in the North to the Sturt Plateau in the South. Other shire zones in the Katherine Region are the Victoria Daly and the Roper Gulf shires. Traditional lands of the area include the Wardaman, Jawoyn and Dagoman abioriginal land trusts. The township itself is a convergence zone of these traditional lands. Wardaman country occupies areas to the west of Katherine, from Manbulloo (around Limestone Creek) to eastern parts of the Victoria River District. Jawoyn country occupies areas to the east of Katherine from Lansdowne to the southern edge of Kakadu National Park, including Nitmiluk National Park, Barunga, Beswick and south-western Arnhem Land. Dagoman country occupies areas to the south of Katherine, from Leach Lagoon, the Upper King River, the Dry River and across to the Warlock Ponds near Mataranka. === Built environment === Springvale Homestead Springvale Homestead, built in 1879, is the oldest original homestead in the Northern Territory. The homestead was originally managed by Alfred Giles, an ex-Overland Telegraph linesman. The Old Katherine Railway Station is another historic attraction that served Vestey's Meatworks during their operation in Darwin and was a major hub of transport during World War II. Another historic site is the O\u2019Keeffe Residence. Originally built as a recreation hut in 1943 for army officers during World War II, the structure serves as a good example of local construction practice, using local materials like Cypress pine and corrugated iron. The Gallon Licence Store is another historical gem of the Old Katherine Settlement, built by Bernard Murphy in 1891. Located near Knotts Crossing, it is surrounded by large Boab Trees and Bauhinia near the banks of the Katherine River. The Gallon Licence Store was also featured in the crocodile horror film Rogue. Since the establishment of Nitmiluk National Park, Katherine has developed into a tourism destination. Katherine Gorge in Nitmiluk National Park attracts large numbers of visitors each year (232,000 in 2004\u201305).Tourism NTTourism NT (www.tourismnt.com.au) == Parks and gardens == Katherine town and surrounds provide plenty of park and garden areas. Dakota Park, Giles Park, Styles Park Jurassic Cycad Gardens, Jukes Park and O\u2019Shea Park are in the town. Tourist attractions include Nitmiluk National Park and Cutta Cutta Caves Nature Park, Kintore Caves Nature Park with its populations of endangered Cycads, Low Level Nature Park, Springvale Homestead and Katherine Hot Springs. Other significant parks of the region include Elsey National Park, Gregory National Park and Giwining/Flora River Nature Park. Along Riverbank Drive on the Katherine River, Katherine Hot Springs provide swimming, shaded picnic tables and barbecue facilities set amongst monsoon forest and tall paperpark trees and ghost gums, with an abundant array of birds and wildlife. A paved pathway loops around and along the Katherine River and mountain bike trails weave on and off a paved pathway down to the river. A cafe and bike hire are situated at the Hot Springs Carpark in the dry season (May to October). Boab tree along the Katherine River Fishing for Barramundi, Tarpon (Ox-eye Herring) and Sooty Grunter, locally known as \"Black Bream\", is also popular along the Katherine River. The river hosts a diverse variety of fish species. The low level Nature Reserve the hot springs and Nitmiluk National Park are regularly checked for crocodiles and are regarded reasonably safe for swimming during the dry season months. Popular fishing spots: Donkey Camp, the Old King River Crossing, Knott's Crossing and Edith River are good fishing spots. The Flora River 90 minutes southwest of town also offers excellent barramundi fishing either by casting from the bank or by small boat. The Flora is inhabited by saltwater crocodiles year-round and swimming is not permitted. Both freshwater crocodiles (Crocodylus johnstoni) and saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus) inhabit river systems in the Katherine Region. == Government == The seat of local government for the Town of Katherine is located in Katherine. The council consists of five aldermen, a mayor, and a deputy mayor.Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory The town's current mayor is Fay Miller. At territory level, the electoral division of Katherine covers the town and its suburbs and elects one member to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Many Northern Territory Government departments have offices in Katherine with most of these housed in the Government Centre building in First Street, which allows the community to access services such as motor vehicle registration and public health clinics, family and community services and public housing. There is also a courthouse located next door which regularly hears matters before the Northern Territory Magistrates Court within the chambers. At federal level, the town, as with all parts of the Northern Territory outside Darwin, is located within the Division of Lingiari. Katherine is a solid base for the centre-right Country Liberal Party. Federal Government services including Centrelink are also accessible through offices in Katherine. == Economy == The pastoral industry, mining, defence (RAAF Tindal) and tourism contribute to the economy of Katherine. In 2003\u201304, the estimated total value of agriculture production from the Katherine Region was $75M: $52M from cattle, $16.5M from fruit and vegetables and $7M from hay and other field crops. Production from mining in the region was estimated at $201M in 2003\u201304, or 13% of NT mining and energy production. Major commodities included lead, zinc, barites, limestone and gravel.NT Government NT Government (www.nt.gov.au) In support of the pastoral and agriculture industries, the Northern Territory Department of Primary Industry and Fisheries maintains the Katherine Research Station, employing up to 40 staff in laboratories, greenhouses, coolrooms and animal- handling facilities, with open lands for cropping and grazing activities. The facility comprises of land on a site located off the Stuart Highway east of Katherine. The research conducted at the station assists local farmers to align land-management to climate and environment, and to address pests and diseases. Mangoes, including the Kensington Pride, are a major primary industry in the territory. In summer, the Katherine region is one of Australia's major mango-producing areas. The Northern Territory in general produces early-season (September\u2013November) mangoes, avoiding the potentially damaging wet season. The town's principal retail facility, the Katherine Oasis Shopping Centre of is owned by Vicinity Centres and includes a Woolworths supermarket, a Target Country store and speciality stores. == Transport == === Rail === The Ghan Katherine was originally connected to Darwin via the North Australia Railway, a narrow gauge railway which reached the town in 1926. The line fell into disuse and was closed in May 1976, after damage caused by Cyclone Tracy led to the cessation of the shipment of iron ore from the Frances Creek mine. In 2003, the line was replaced by the standard gauge line from Alice Springs to Darwin. The Ghan, run by Journey Beyond, operates on the standard gauge line between Adelaide and Darwin. It runs once a week in each direction, with some exceptions.The Ghan Timetable 2019-2020 Great Southern RailAustralian Railmaps, \"Rail map \u2013 Perth to Adelaide, Central and Northern Australia\". Accessed 12 June 2007. === Air === Katherine airport is approximately 15 km south of the town centre. Air North flies to Katherine 3 times a week from Darwin and Alice Springs. Charter flights can also be arranged. The current airport shares facilities with RAAF Base Tindal, replacing the original Katherine Airfield which operated from 1930 - 1978, which was notable as the base from which Dr Clyde Fenton established the Northern Territory Aerial Medical Service. The airport and town received an extended description in the book \"Beyond the Blue Horizon\" by Alexander Frater, written in the 1980s and describing a journey by local air services from London to Brisbane, retracing the route of the pioneer airline operations of the 1930s. === Road === Katherine is at the crossroads of the Savannah Way that runs east-west from Cairns to Broome and the Explorer's Way that runs north-south from Darwin to Adelaide through Alice Springs. Savannah Way runs along the Victoria Highway at Katherine and Explorers Way runs along Stuart Highway.
