Things get worse for her when she finds out that her manga is ranked last so her editor asks her to find things moe in the form of guys at her school. Kanna not understanding what he means wishes the guys she is with are 2D rather than in 3D, this changes when Fumio accidentally falls on her shirtless and she sees that 3D can be moe just not for a Shojo manga according to her editor. Kanna admits that she has been bullied when people find out she likes manga and cannot control herself when someone disses her manga, she figures this will be the same with Fumio, Fujio, and Shota but she ends up being wrong. Later on Kanna appears to fall for a new student Joji Yama-uchi who joins the manga class and reminds her of a character from a manga despite warnings that he looks suspicious from the other three boys. Things change however when Joji after finding out about Kanna's debut ties her up and steals her drawings at the end of the first manga. :In chapter 5 it is found out that Kanna wanted to use the pen-name Lolita Princess Bambi but her editor burst out laughing and suggested she use her real name. ; :Fumio is a guy with blonde hair and green eyes he was born mid-summer and is a Leo. Like Fujio and Shota he is into manga also like them however, he has his delusions about being a manga artist saying that he \"wants to be a manga artist so he can buy the manga and read it for work\".

The first volume was on the New York Times best seller list for a week at No. 10 from October 19\u201326, 2014. Anime News network gave the first volume a B+ rating praising Toyama's humor in the story and jokes about Otaku with great translation notes, but goes on to say that \"significant background knowledge\" is needed to understand all of the jokes used and called the artwork generic. Manga critic Katherine Dacey from Manga Bookshelf gave it a good review calling it light-hearted and \"not for everyone but for the manga obsessed\". Myrto Tselenti from Otaku USA magazine gave the series a mixed review calling it a manga about a manga. While he said that \"the shojo premise of a socially awkward female protagonist and her attractive male admirers\" was an original combo, the shojo aspect does not work so well calling the protagonists \"two dimensional clich\u00e9s\". Sakura Eries from the Fandom Post also gave the first volume of the English release a review. She calls Kanna's personality unlikeable, and while the guy characters may provide some laughs they are barely entertaining. ==References== ==External links== * Official website at Kodansha * Category:2010 manga Category:Comedy anime and manga Category:Ema T\u014dyama Category:Kodansha manga Category:Manga creation in anime and manga Category:Sh\u014djo manga Category:Slice of life anime and manga ",
