Starring by Alfonso Herrera, Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar and Itahisa Machado. == Plot == Inspired by the 1997 American drama Donnie Brasco, El Dandy tells the story of a law professor who has been hired by the Attorney General, to participate in a program of special operations, where he must infiltrate one of the most notorious drug cartels of Mexico City. Under the false name Daniel \"El Dandy\" Bracho (Alfonso Herrera), he begins the task of identifying all the members of this clandestine network. However, he quickly finds that his acute ability to police work is only comparable with the exciting sense of danger that experiences living life to the fullest. Along the way, it avails itself of the help of a criminal's petty, loyal, even corrupt, ally called El Chueco (Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar), who quickly befriends Bracho and comes dangerously close to discover his true identity. Much deeper, Bracho is involved in the mafia, more work tells him to get out, and the professor, once incorruptible, has to choose between returning to a normal life as a respectable citizen or fully embrace his criminal life. == Cast == === Main === * Dami\u00e1n Alc\u00e1zar as Juan Antonio Ram\u00edrez / El Chueco * Alfonso Herrera as Daniel \"El Dandy\" Bracho / Jos\u00e9 \"Pepe\" Monta\u00f1o * Gabriela Roel as Mar\u00eda Luisa * Itahisa Machado as Leticia Albarr\u00e1n * Aleyda Gallardo as Fidela * Danny Perea as Dr. Itzel / Noem\u00ed * Francisco Pakey as El Esquimal * F\u00e1tima Molina as Deyanira * H\u00e9ctor Holten as Procurador * Carlos Valencia as D\u00edaz * Amorita Rasgado as Amaranta * Aketza L\u00f3pez as Jorge * Elba Jim\u00e9nez as Marcela * Alejandro de Marino as Carlos Galindo / El Menonita * Jer\u00f3nimo Fern\u00e1ndez as unknown * Julia Urbini as Emilia === Recurring === * Roberto Carlo as Jacques Jr. * Alejandro Speitzer as Serch * Oliver Avenda\u00f1o as Richi D\u00edaz * Luis de Alba as Ecadio * Claudio Roca as Diego Durand * Ana Laverde as Primavera === Special participation === * Dagoberto Gama as Jos\u00e9 Luis Zamacona / El Negro * Hern\u00e1n Mendoza as La G\u00fcera * Daniel Mart\u00ednez as Filiberto Ortega * Christian Vazquez as To\u00f1o == Broadcast == The series airs worldwide on TNT Series.
