Before becoming an author, Tursten worked as a nurse and then a dentist, but was forced to leave due to illness. During her illness she worked as a translator of medical articles. == Works == === Books === * 1998 \u2014 Den krossade tangh\u00e4sten (English translation: Detective Inspector Huss, 2003) * 1999 \u2014 Nattrond (English translation: Night Rounds, 2012) * 1999 \u2014 Tatuerad torso (English translation: The Torso, 2006) * 2002 \u2014 Kallt mord * 2002 \u2014 Glasdj\u00e4vulen (English translation: The Glass Devil, 2007) * 2004 \u2014 Guldkalven (English translation: The Golden Calf, 2013) * 2005 \u2014 Eldsdansen (English translation: The Fire Dance, 2014) * 2007 \u2014 En man med litet ansikte (English translation: The Beige Man, 2015) * 2008 \u2014 Det l\u00f6mska n\u00e4tet (English translation: The Treacherous Net, 2015) * 2010 \u2014 Den som vakar i m\u00f6rkret (English translation: Who Watcheth, 2016) * 2012 \u2014 I skydd av skuggorna (English translation: Protected by the Shadows, 2017) * 2018 \u2014 (English translation: An Elderly Lady is Up to No Good: Stories, tr. Marlaine Delargy, 2018) Tursten has also written two non-Irene Huss books. === Films === Several films have been made derived from Tursten's works featuring Irene Huss, produced by Illusion Films and Yellow Bird Films. These are in Swedish with Danish and English sub-titles. Irene Huss movies are a collection of films about a fictional Swedish police officer played by Angela Kov\u00e1cs. A total of twelve 90-minute films produced between the years 2007 to 2011. All but three movies based on the books of the same name titles, written by author Helene Tursten. The last three films have been produced based instead on the books' characters and are thus independent stories. Films set in the Gothenburg area, where viewers get to follow both Irene Huss in the work as a police officer but also in her family, which are often strongly influenced by her work. The twelve films were made in two installments; a first round in which the films were released in 2007-2008 and then a second round in which the films were released in 2011. All films except the first one was released directly on DVD, while the first film went up to the cinema before it was released on DVD. The films have also been shown countless times on Kanal 5 in Sweden and ARD in Germany, as these have been some of the financiers to the movies. Johan F\u00e4lemark and Hillevi R\u00e5berg were film producers in the first season while Daniel Ahlqvist added as the third film producer in the second season. * 2007 \u2014 Irene Huss \u2014 Tatuerad Torso * 2007 \u2014 Den krossade tangh\u00e4sten * 2008 \u2014 Nattrond * 2008 \u2014 Glasdj\u00e4vulen * 2008 \u2014 Eldsdansen * 2008 \u2014 Guldkalven * 2011 \u2014 Den som vakar i m\u00f6rkret * 2011 \u2014 Det l\u00f6mska n\u00e4tet * 2011 \u2014 En man med litet ansikte * 2011 \u2014 Tystnadens cirkel * 2011 \u2014 I skydd av skuggorna * 2011 \u2014 Jagad vittne == References == ==External links== * Video introduction by Helene Tursten (in Swedish) to Irene Huss films made for Swedish TV. * (in Swedish). * Review of Detective Inspector Huss in January Magazine.
