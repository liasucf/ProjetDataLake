    "text": "Adolf \"Ad\" Rutschman (born October 30, 1931) is an American football coach, former baseball coach, and college athletics administrator. He was a head football coach for 24 seasons, head baseball coach for 13 seasons, and served as athletic director for 25 years at Linfield College. He is the first athletic director emeritus in the history of the college. He also served as head coach of football and baseball at his alma mater, Hillsboro High School. ==Early years== Rutschman was an athlete at Hillsboro High School (Hilhi Spartans) in his hometown of Hillsboro, Oregon. There he starred as a running back in the late 1940s, scoring 20 career touchdowns.Hilhi career scoring. The Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976.McKinney, Dick.

After high school, he turned down a professional contract with the NFL's Detroit Lions and made up his mind to teach and coach sports. He received his degree in physical education and began teaching at Hilhi in 1954. He was an assistant baseball coach in 1955 before becoming the head baseball coach in 1956. He became the head football coach three years after that, winning a state championship in 1966.McKinney, Dick. Spartans 1966 teams rank as two state champions. The Hillsboro Argus, October 19, 1976.

Hillsboro had four Little League teams when Rutschman began coaching at Hillsboro, but by the time he left, there were 41 teams. After 13 years at Hillsboro High school, Rutschman was approached about taking over the head football coach position at Linfield College. ==Linfield College== Rutschman was hired as the head football coach at Linfield College in 1968. During his 24 seasons as Linfield head football coach, his teams won three NAIA national championship (1982, 1984, 1986) and 15 Northwest Conference championships. One of his most memorable coached games was the 1984 national championship. Linfield trailed defending NAIA-II champion Northwestern 22-0 with just over three minutes left in the third quarter, but would come back to win 33-22. His Wildcats played in a total of 20 post-season games in 12 different seasons. He led the team to a winning season in all 24 seasons as coach, part of Linfield's current all-divisions national record streak of 62 consecutive winning seasons (as of the end of the 2017 season). After the 1991 season, Rutschman retired from coaching with a career record of 183-48-3 (.788). Rutschman also served as the head coach of the baseball program from 1971 to 1983. In his first season as the head baseball coach, he guided Linfield to the NAIA national championship. Before stepping down as head coach in 1983, he led the Wildcats to six conference championships and seven NAIA District 2 titles. Rutschman is the only college coach at any level to have won national titles in both football and baseball. He was named Division II football coach of the year three times and was honored as the state of Oregon's Slats Gill man of the year five times, more than any other individual. Rutschman was named to the NAIA Hall of Fame in 1988, the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame in 1993 and was enshrined into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1998. During his 25-year tenure as athletic director, the college's sports facilities took major leaps forward. The spacious and modern athletic complex, including two new gymnasiums, a swimming pool and multi-purpose field house, was constructed, a new baseball stadium was erected and the tennis courts were relocated and expanded. Locker rooms were renovated and a concession stand and ticket booth was built. The field house, a multi-purpose facility completed in 1995, was named in honor of Rutschman and his wife, Joan, for their 27 years of service to the college. Rutschman retired as head coach of the football team in 1991, but returned in 2001 as kickoff return coach under head coach Jay Locey. ==Legacy== Rutschman's grandson, Adley Rutschman, was a catcher for the Oregon State Beavers baseball team. Adley was the College World Series Most Outstanding Player on Oregon State's 2018 College World Series championship team and was selected by the Baltimore Orioles with the first overall pick in the 2019 Major League Baseball Draft. ==Head coaching record== ===College football=== ==References== ==External links== * Linfield profile * Category:1931 births Category:Living people Category:Linfield Wildcats athletic directors Category:Linfield Wildcats baseball coaches Category:Linfield Wildcats football coaches Category:High school baseball coaches in the United States Category:High school football coaches in Oregon Category:Hillsboro High School (Oregon) alumni Category:Linfield University alumni Category:Sportspeople from Hillsboro, Oregon Category:College Football Hall of Fame inductees Category:Sportspeople from McMinnville, Oregon ",
