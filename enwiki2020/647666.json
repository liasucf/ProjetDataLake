Work began in 500 and was completed in 523. In 1987 a brick-entrance was demolished to reveal two new figures: a four-headed, four- armed Brahma and a one headed, four armed \u015aakra devendra. ==Features== The back wall is a carved Sakyamuni, with two discliples and two bodhisattvas. The main Buddha and bodhisattvas are representative of the Northern Wei sculptural style. A lotus-flower pool decorates the floor. The ceiling is engraved with a blossoming lotus flower, 8 musical apsarases, 2 attending apsarases and tassel and drapery patterns. The front wall is covered with a large Vimalakirti relief, the Prince Sattva jataka, the Prince Sudatta jataka, an emperor/empress worshipping scene and ten deity kings. ==Nearby caves== The cave is flanked by North and South Binyang Caves. ==Images== File:Longmen- binyang-middle-cave-wideshot.jpg|Rear and north walls (2004) File:Longmen- binyang-middle-cave-south-wall.jpg|South wall (2004) Category:Chinese architectural history Category:Chinese Buddhist grottoes Category:Chinese sculpture Category:Caves of Henan Category:Tourist attractions in Henan Category:Religion in Henan ",
