    "text": "WildEarth (founded in 2006 by Emily Wallington and Graham Wallington) is a South African broadcasting company primarily based at Djuma Game Reserve, part of the Sabi Sand Game Reserve in South Africa, focusing primarily on educating people about African Wildlife. The company has been featured on news broadcasts such as CNN, The Washington Post, NBC News, Yahoo! and BBC News due to the popularity and viewship of the live drives increasing during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has restricted international travel to a from Africa. They are currently collaborating with guiding companies such as AndBeyond Who broadcast the drives from both Ngala and Phinda Reserves (starting from April 2019), Eco Training, who broadcast the drives from Karongwe between April 2019 to May 2019 (these drives were prematurely ended, however, due to a hunting incident that took place at Karongwe in 2013) and Pridelands Reserve, as well as Tswalu Game Reserve in the Kalahari and the Maasai Mara in Kenya. The first hour of the live drives are now being broadcast by the South African Broadcasting Corporation, and the full drives have been broadcast in China by China Global Television Network from 15th August-15th September 2020. On 25th August 2020, WildEarth have launched a TV channel. The channel is currently only available in South Africa on DStv, but is planned to be launched worldwide at an undetermined date. ==Live drives== Every morning and evening (Central Africa Time), Wildearth do 3-hour live drives that take place at Sabi Sands, Ngala, Phinda, Maasai Mara, Tswalu and Pridelands. These drives feature guides (referred to as \"naturalists\"), who take viewers around the area and also provide information about what is being seen, as well as a camera operator, who films the animals that are being seen during the drive. At the start is of each drive is a 45 minute \"Kids\" segment, where children can ask question via emailing WildEarth. After this segment ends, a 2-hour 45 minute segment starts, where other viewers can ask question via the live-chat. These drives have been broadcast since 2007, and some older drives have been archived by viewers. WildEarth also upload highlights from drives (such as sightings of young animals or predator kills) on their Youtube channel. == Live camera == A 24/7 live camera (Often referred to as the \"Dam Cam\" by fans of WildEarth) was set up near Vyutela Dam, Djuma Private Game Reserve in 1998. This live camera can be viewed on the Djuma Private Game Reserve Youtube Channel . The camera is remotely operated by global volunteers known as \"zoomies\", and allows viewers to observe the local fauna of the area. Highlights of individual animals (such as lions or elephants) seen on the camera can also be found on Djuma's official Youtube page. ==Animals== Animals seen on the WildEarth drives and live camera include spotted hyenas, lions, leopard, hippopotamus and elephants. Rhinoceros are not shown on the broadcasts except for in Phinda and the Maasai Mara due to threat of poaching. Some animals featured on the live drives have been named by the guides, lodges and viewers. These include the hyenas, lions and leopards. Some named animals include Ribbon, Corky, Ntima, Ndebele (members of the Djuma hyena clan, with Ribbon as the matriarch), Tingana and Thandi (leopards). These names are used to help viewers and guides indentify different animals featured on both the drives and live camera, and to also form a connection with the animals. == References == ==External links== * WildEarth (official website) Category:Broadcasting in South Africa Category:Education Category:Entertainment companies of South Africa Category:Companies of South Africa Category:Broadcasting companies ",
