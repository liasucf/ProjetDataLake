The assassination was carried out on \"Radomir Putnik\" street in downtown Skopje, where he was shot in the back. Preli\u0107 died three days later at the Military Hospital in Skopje. During the Bulgarian occupation of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia from 1941 to 1945, at the site of the assassination, there was a memorial plaque honoring Mara Buneva, which was removed by the Serbian government after the war. Since 2000, the memorial plaque has been erected and removed on several occasions. == References == Category:1883 births Category:1928 deaths Category:People from Skopje Category:Assassinated Serbian people ",
