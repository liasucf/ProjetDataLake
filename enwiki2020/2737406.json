    "text": "Yungasocereus inquisivensis is a species of cactus native to Bolivia, the sole member of its genus, Yungasocereus. It is a columnar cactus, appearing either as a tree or shrub, ranging up to 4\u20135 meters in height. The 6\u20137 cm diameter stems are dark green, with 6-10 ribs. The 1.5\u20133 cm spines are in groups of 4-12, with no differentiation into central and radial types, and range from a brownish to grayish color. The flowers are white, appearing in groups of 5-8 near the stem tips. This cactus is known only from Yungas and Inquisivi provinces of La Paz Department, where it is found at elevations of around 2000m. C\u00e1rdenas described the species in 1957 from Inquisivi, placing it in Samaipaticereus. Ritter later found the same species in Yungas, and in 1980 gave it its own genus Yungasocereus. After a period in Haageocereus, this was again separated into Yungasocereus. ==References== * Edward F.
