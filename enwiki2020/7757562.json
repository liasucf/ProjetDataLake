According to his family, Cabrera began switch hitting at three years old. In his youth, Cabrera closely followed Venezuelan shortstop Omar Vizquel's career. At 15 or 16 years old, he made a deal with his father that he would leave school and focus on baseball. If he were not signed within a year, he would return to school. At 15 years old he caught the attention of Seattle Mariners scout Emilio Carrasquel. ==Professional career== ===Cleveland Indians=== Cabrera playing for the Wisconsin Timber Rattlers in 2005 Cabrera was signed by the Seattle Mariners as an amateur free agent in 2002.
