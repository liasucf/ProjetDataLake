    "text": "\"Ni Freud Ni Tu Mam\u00e1\" (English: \"Neither Freud Nor Your Mom\") is the official first single from Belinda's second studio album Utop\u00eda. It was produced by Greg Wells and written by Greg Wells, Shelly Peiken, Belinda and Nacho Peregr\u00edn. The English version, \"If We Were\", is Belinda's most successful cross-over single to date. == Single == The song debuted on August 21, 2006, on the Mexican radio stations and became a top 5 hit single in Central and South America. The single was released on iTunes on September 19, 2006, and the track was used for the opening of the Mexican telenovela C\u00f3digo Postal in Univision Puerto Rico. The English version of the song, called \"If We Were\", was featured on the re-release of the album, known as Utop\u00eda\u00b2 and it was also released as a single on iTunes on August 28, 2007.If We Were - Single iTunes == Music video == The music video was directed by Scott Speer. The video depicts Belinda swimming in an underwater urban setting in the middle of what appears to be a storm. It has been reported that Belinda found singing in perflubron challenging. She appears to be floating in the air. She's also seen singing with her band. Near the bridge of the song, guest stars, Drew Seeley and Raven-Symon\u00e9 (Belinda's friend and The Cheetah Girls 2 co-star) can be found street-dancing around Belinda. The video was released on October 10, 2006. There is a director's cut version of \"Ni Freud Ni Tu Mam\u00e1\" and it can be viewed on YouTube. With the release of \"If We Were\" in Europe, Belinda re-shot some scenes of her singing in English and edited the original music video with the new scenes. The video became quite successful in Italy, where it peaked at number 6 on the TRL Italy Countdown. There are two edited versions of \"If We Were\", both in which can be viewed on YouTube. Both versions clip \"Ni Freud Ni Tu Mam\u00e1\", but the first uses an edited version of the song, and do not show Belinda actually singing. The second, although, clips the parts where Belinda is not singing or the words don't need to fit, and uses new scenes, recorded in English. == Track listing == These are the formats and track listings of major single releases of \"Ni Freud Ni Tu Mam\u00e1\" and \"If We Were\".
