Davis (1944), 'The pronunciations, derivations, and meanings of a selected list of star names'. Popular Astronomy, Vol. 52, p.8\u201330 is a star in the constellation of Crater. It is a cool giant star about away. ==Nomenclature== \u03b1 Crateris (Latinised to Alpha Crateris) is the star's Bayer designation. It bore the traditional name Alkes, from the Arabic \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u0633 alk\u0101s or \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0623\u0633 alka's \"the cup\". In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Aoul al Batjna (\u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0623\u0644\u0628\u062c\u0646 awwil albajna), which was translated into Latin as Prima Crateris, meaning \"the first cup\". In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalogue and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN approved the name Alkes for this star on 12 September 2016 and it is now so included in the List of IAU-approved Star Names.

It has an apparent magnitude of 4.07, and is 174 light-years from Earth. It is thought to be a horizontal branch star, meaning it is fusing helium in its core after a helium flash. Cool horizontal branch stars are often called red clump giants as they form a noticeable grouping near the hot edge of the red giant branch in the H\u2013R diagrams of clusters with near-solar metallicity. On this basis it is calculated to have a mass of , a luminosity of , and an age around two billion years. Its surface temperature is 4645 K. Or it might be a red-giant branch star, still fusing hydrogen in a shell around an insert helium core, in which case it would be slightly less massive, older, cooler, larger, and more luminous. ==References== Category:Crater (constellation) Crateris, Alpha Crateris, 07 095272 053740 Category:K-type giants Alkes 4287 Category:Durchmusterung objects Category:Horizontal-branch stars ",
