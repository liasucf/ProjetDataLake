    "text": "F\u00e9lix Ar\u00e1uz (born 1935 in Guayaquil, Ecuador) is an Ecuadorian painter. Ar\u00e1uz is among the art circles of Enrique T\u00e1bara, An\u00edbal Villac\u00eds, Jos\u00e9 Carre\u00f1o and Juan Villafuerte. In 1957, Ar\u00e1uz began studying under C\u00e9sar Andrade Faini at the School of Fine Arts. During his second year, his father died leaving Ar\u00e1uz feeling nostalgic and isolated. Ar\u00e1uz funneled his emotions into his work creating some of the most beautiful, heartfelt and dreamlike imagery to date. Both his use of color and his compositions are strong and designed to leave a lasting impression on the viewer. Ar\u00e1uz's subjects usually include surreal flower arrangements, the innocence of children, faces, 'trees of life', landscapes and abstracts - all of which are created with a personal dreamlike aesthetic. In 1967, Ar\u00e1uz married Nila Villafuerte Estrada, older sister of Juan Villafuerte. Ar\u00e1uz, Juan Villafuerte and Jos\u00e9 Carre\u00f1o had a very close friendship forged at the School of Fine Arts. In the same year, Arauz received a government scholarship to travel to the United States with the fellow master painter Gilberto Almeida a member of the VAN group, an artist collective founded by Enrique T\u00e1bara and An\u00edbal Villac\u00eds and Jaime Villa in order to study galleries and museums throughout New York, Philadelphia, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Miami. In 1970, arranged through his friend, Jaime Andrade, Ar\u00e1uz exhibited two paintings at the Pan American Union in Washington, D.C. and at Gallery Kromex in New York. Both exhibits were considered notable. In 1971, Ar\u00e1uz obtained The Great Prize of Julio National Hall in Guayaquil. In 1987, Ar\u00e1uz traveled to Basel, Switzerland to exhibit with his friend Elo\u00edsa Melo. From there, Ar\u00e1uz traveled to Brussels and exhibited with V\u00edctor Mideros. Finally, Ar\u00e1uz met up with longtime friend and colleague Jose Carre\u00f1o in Paris. Ar\u00e1uz has been a professor at the School of Fine Arts since 1966 and continues to paint in his studio in Guayaquil, Ecuador. ==Awards and medals== 1965 & 1969 Second Prize, National Hall, October, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1963 & 1972 First Prize, National Hall, October, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1968 Great prize, Gold Medal, National Hall, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1971 Great Prize, National Hall, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1975 Second Prize, National Hall, Guayaquil, Ecuador 1981 Gold Medal of Artistic Merit, granted by the illustrious Municipality of Guayaquil. 1996 Gold Brush Cultural Association. ==References== * Municipalidad de Guayaquil - www.guayaquil.gov.ec/data/salondejulio/antecedentes.htm * Salvat, Arte Contempor\u00e1neo de Ecuador.
