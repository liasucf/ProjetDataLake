    "text": "\"Sunny Sundae Smile\" is a song by the alternative rock band My Bloody Valentine. It was released as a non-album single in February 1987 on Lazy Records. Recorded at Alaska Studios in London, \"Sunny Sundae Smile\" was the band's first release on Lazy Records and the final release to feature original vocalist David Conway. Less than 2,000 copies of the 7-inch single were pressed and the 12-inch single received a limited release of 2,000 copies. Allmusic writer Nitsuh Abebe described \"Sunny Sundae Smile\" as \"pop melodies revved up by sheets and sheets of Jesus and Mary Chain-style guitar noise\" and added that \"somewhere in there, though, you can hear the beginnings of the lighter, more distinct sound that characterized Ecstasy and 'Strawberry Wine'.\" Upon its release, \"Sunny Sundae Smile\" peaked at number 6 on the UK Independent Singles Chart. ==Track listing== All songs written by David Conway and Kevin Shields. ;UK 7\" single (Lazy Records, LAZY04) #\"Sunny Sundae Smile\" \u2013 2:30 #\"Paint a Rainbow\" \u2013 2:19 ;UK 12\" single (Lazy Records, LAZY04T) #\"Sunny Sundae Smile\" \u2013 2:30 #\"Paint a Rainbow\" \u2013 2:19 #\"Kiss the Eclipse\" \u2013 2:34 #\"Sylvie's Head\" \u2013 1:54 ==Personnel== All personnel credits adapted from \"Sunny Sundae Smile\"s liner notes. ;My Bloody Valentine *David Conway \u2013 vocals *Kevin Shields \u2013 guitar, vocals *Debbie Googe \u2013 bass *Colm \u00d3 C\u00edos\u00f3ig \u2013 drums ;Technical personnel *My Bloody Valentine \u2013 production *Steve Nunn \u2013 engineering *Pete Peterson \u2013 photography ==Chart positions== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1987) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Independent Singles Chart | 6 |} ==References== ===Bibliography=== * ==External links== * Category:1987 songs Category:1987 singles Category:My Bloody Valentine (band) songs Category:Songs written by Kevin Shields ",
