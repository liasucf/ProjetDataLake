Ciku then ended up at FC MAS T\u00e1borsko, again in the Czech Republic, where he settled in well before departing in 2017. == References == == External links == * Elvist Ciku: Podhrotov\u00e1 pozice mi seed * Fotbalista MFK OKD Elvist Ciku: Na ja\u0159e budeme lep\u0161\u00ed * at Soccerway * Czech Wikipedia Page Category:1986 births Category:Living people Category:Footballers from Shkod\u00ebr Category:Association football midfielders Category:Albanian footballers Category:MFK Karvin\u00e1 players Category:GKS Katowice players Category:FC MAS T\u00e1borsko players Category:Albanian expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Albanian expatriate sportspeople in Greece Category:Expatriate footballers in Poland Category:Albanian expatriate sportspeople in Poland Category:Expatriate footballers in the Czech Republic Category:Albanian expatriate sportspeople in the Czech Republic ",
