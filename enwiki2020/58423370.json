    "text": "Kyvos is a business intelligence acceleration platform for cloud and big data platforms developed by an American privately held company named Kyvos Insights. The company, headquartered in Los Gatos, California, was founded by Praveen Kankariya, CEO of Impetus Technologies. The software provides OLAP- based multidimensional analysis on big data and cloud platforms and was launched officially in June 2015. In December the same year, the company was listed among the 10 Coolest Big Data Startups of 2015 by CRN Magazine. == Technology == The software uses OLAP technology to enable business intelligence on the cloud and big data platforms. In a report published by Forrester Research in 2016, where they evaluated several native Hadoop business intelligence (BI) platforms on 22 parameters, Kyvos was referred to as a platform that gave new life to OLAP by bringing it to Hadoop. As per the report, Kyvos enables analysis on Hadoop based on OLAP schemas, aggregations, and predefined drill-down paths. It pre-calculates aggregates at multiple levels of dimensional hierarchies to improve query response times as compared to SQL-on-Hadoop platforms. Users can analyze data through the Kyvos visualization tool or by using other BI platforms. Kyvos was originally built for Hadoop and later on added support for Cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure. Initially, it supported only MDX queries and integrated with data visualization tools such as Excel and Tableau. In 2017, Kyvos 4.0 added support for SQL connectivity extending integration to other BI tools such as Business Objects, Cognos, MicroStrategy, Power BI and Qlik. In late 2018, Version 5 of the software was built specifically for the cloud with elastic OLAP to provide a cloud native way to scale up and down for changing data workloads. With its 2020.2 release, Kyvos added support for Snowflake data warehouse. The product was also made available on Microsoft Azure marketplace and Amazon Web Services marketplace. == Major releases == * First release in June 2015. * Kyvos 2.0 released in June 2016 with support for Amazon Web Services and additional BI tools. * Kyvos 4.0 released in August 2017 with support for SQL queries, enhanced performance, and support for concurrent users. *Kyvos 5 released in November 2018 with elastic OLAP for native cloud support and data profiling features. *Kyvos 2020.2 released in May 2020 with support for Snowflake cloud data warehouse and general availability on Azure and AWS marketplace. == Awards == * In June 2018, Kyvos technology won the TDWI's Best Practices Award in the Emerging Technologies and Methods category for a customer implementation. == See also == *Comparison of OLAP servers == References == == External links == * Category:Big data companies Category:Big data products Category:Companies based in Santa Clara County, California Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Online analytical processing Category:Business intelligence companies Category:Hadoop Category:Companies based in Silicon Valley Category:Los Gatos, California Category:2015 establishments in California Category:Business services companies established in 2015 Category:American companies established in 2015 ",
