The facilitator of that group was Steve Stagon and it was his idea to create an AIDS museum, in south Florida because Broward County and Miami-Dade County are \"the epicenter of the AIDS crisis in America.\"World AIDS Museum, \"About Us\", http://www.worldaidsmuseum.org/about-us/. A non-profit corporation was set up and fundraising began. After various local exhibits in churches and the Pride Center, once they had enough funding they choose the location on 26th Street. On November 7, 2013, Magic Johnson visited the World AIDS Museum and dedicated the space, 22 years to the day he announced his HIV status. Doors officially opened to the public in May 2014. The World AIDS Museum and Educational Center has a main gallery featuring the historical timeline of the AIDS epidemic, exhibits on Stigma, and a travelling photography exhibit, The Face of HIV, which is now hung in The Urban League of Broward County's community gallery. They also do educational programs in schools and community organizations. The current Executive Director is Dr. Requel Lopes, AP. WAM is now located at the 1350 E. Sunrise Blvd., Fort Lauderdale, FL 33304 in the ArtServe Facility.
