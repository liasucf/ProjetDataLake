    "text": "Fengyang Flower Drum () is a traditional Chinese folk song, a form of Quyi, from Fengyang County, Anhui Province that was first developed during the late Ming Dynasty. Originally, it was performed by two seated female singers (usually sisters-in-law). It was typically performed in public for gratuities, as Fengyang County was prone to flooding from the Yellow River. ==History== The Fengyang Flower Drum song was associated with beggars from Fengyang County which experienced a disastrous series of flood and drought during the late Ming Dynasty, forcing residents to sing for money. It is classed as one of the speech-song () folk arts of Quyi. The form was popularized by its appearance in The Good Earth, the 1937 film adaptation of a novel by Pearl S. Buck. Chou Wen-Chung, an American emigrant from China, incorporated it into his 1949 composition Landscapes. ==References== Category:Chinese storytelling Category:Chinese folk music ",
