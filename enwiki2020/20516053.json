Imerovigli is mostly famous for its beautiful sunset, that it is called \"balcony to the Aegean\". Its houses are built amphitheatrically around the caldera and it is crossed by narrow, paved paths. Imerovigli has many lovely churches, all made in the Cycladic architectural style. They most notable are the church of Ai-Stratis, in the centre of the village, and the Monastery of Saint Nikolaos, on the way connecting Imerovigli to Fira. Another famous site of Imerovigli is Skaros, which are the remains of a Venetian Castle built in 1207 by Jacopo Barozzi, the ruler of all Cyclades islands that time. Imerovigli has only 470 permanent inhabitants. ==References== Category:Santorini Category:Populated places in Thira (regional unit) ",
