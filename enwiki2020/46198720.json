The route from SH 93 to FM 989 is internally signed as Urban Road 559 (UR 559) by TxDOT and is known locally as Richmond Road. ==Route description== FM 559 begins at an intersection with SH 93 (Summerhill Road) just northwest of downtown Texarkana. The highway runs northwest along Richmond Road, passing just west of Texarkana College. FM 559 intersects Interstate 30/US 59 near Central Mall, running through a heavily developed area of northern Texarkana before entering the Pleasant Grove area of the city. The highway intersects Farm to Market Road 2878 (just south of Texas A&M; University\u2013Texarkana) and Farm to Market Road 989 before leaving the city. FM 559 intersects Farm to Market Road 1397 in Wamba before taking a more rural course. FM 559 ends a few miles north of FM 2253, continuing as a county road. ==History== FM 559 originally ran further into Texarkana along 24th Street to US 82, with the north end in Wamba; this section was designated on July 9, 1945.
