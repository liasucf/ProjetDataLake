    "text": "The zygomaticus minor is a muscle of facial expression. It originates from zygomatic bone and continues with orbicularis oculi on the lateral face of the levator labii superioris and then inserts into the outer part of the upper lip. It draws the upper lip backward, upward, and outward and is used in smiling. Like all muscles of facial expression, it is innervated by the facial nerve (CN VII). The zygomaticus minor is sometimes referred to as the \"zygomatic head\" of the levator labii superioris muscle. ==Images== File:Zygomaticus minor muscle animation small.gif|Zygomaticus minor muscle (shown in red). ==See also== * Zygomaticus major muscle * Zygomatic bone == References == ==External links== * PTCentral Category:Muscles of the head and neck ",
