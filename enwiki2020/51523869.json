The album was re-released in March 1993 as a 2CD pack with The Black Sorrows' Better Times and peaked at number 14 on the ARIA Chart. The album was re-released in 2002 with two additional tracks from the original sessions that were not included on the first pressing, Those being \"Honest I Do\" and \"Tonight The Bottle Let Me Down\" Inside the booklet, Joe Camilleri of The Revelators said: \"I don't see this as a greatest hits recording, more an opportunity to pay homage to some of the great writers of our time.The Revelators were formed out of a desire to keep music alive. Some of these songs have been with us for some time - others we were drawn to because of their charm... and every word is true.\" == Track listing == ; CD track listing ; 2002 Re-release # \"El Salvador\" # \"Oh Darling\" # \"Do Right Woman\" # \"I've Got to Find a Way to Win Maria Back\" # \"Tupelo Honey\" # \"What Does It Take (To Win Your Love)?\" # \"Caribbean Wind\" # \"Honest I Do\" (John Scofield) - 3:05 # \"Hot Burrito #1\" # \"If I Could Be There\" # \"Louisiana Blues\" # \"Tonight the Bottle Let Me Down\" (Merle Haggard) - 3:27 # \"Walk That Line\" ==Weekly charts== Upon re-release with The Black Sorrows' Better Times, the album debuted at number 41, before peaking at number 14 on the ARIA charts in May 1993. {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1993) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ==Personnel== The Revelators are: * Joe Camilleri - vocal, saxophone, guitar * James Black - keyboard, guitar * Jeff Burstin - guitar, mandolin * Joe Creighton - bass, backing vocals * Peter Luscombe - drums, percussion ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Region ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | December 1991 | CD, Cassette | Sony Music Australia | 4692552 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | March 1993 | CD, Cassette | CBS Records | 4721492 |- ! scope=\"row\"| United Kingdom | 1993 | CD, Cassette | Demon Records | FIENDCD729 |- ! scope=\"row\"| Worldwide | 2002 | CD, Digital Download | Head Records | HEAD026 |- |} ==References== ==External links== * \"Amazing Stories\" at discogs.com Category:1991 debut albums Category:The Revelators albums Category:Albums produced by Joe Camilleri ",
