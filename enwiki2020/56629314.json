He obtained his Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree from the London Hospital in 1955. ==Career== Swallow founded clinics for children with disabilities at Dr Barnardo's Home and the London Hospital, during a period in which there was little interest in the oral health of disabled people.\"Obituary: James Neil Swallow\". by SG, British Dental Journal, Vol. 209, p. 53 (10 July 2010) He frequently made night calls to construct feeding plates for new-born children with cleft palates. Along with Geoffrey Slack and Phil Holloway, he authored Child Dental Health (1969) which for many years was a standard textbook on children's dentistry and well- remembered by dental students from his time.\"Phil Holloway\" by I. Holloway, British Dental Journal, Vol. 221, p. 696 (9 December 2016) In addition, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, he would visit the Bobaths at their centre in London for children with cerebral palsy.\"Tributes: James Neil Swallow BDS MDS\" , Rob Hale, Journal of Disability and Oral Health, Vol. 11 (2010), No. 2, pp. 51\u201352.

He moved to Cardiff in 1964, where he had been appointed as the first senior lecturer in children's dentistry at the then new Cardiff Dental School. He set up a course in paediatric dentistry and developed a dental service for children and adults with a disability. His MD thesis on the oral health of people with disability was published in 1967. Swallow carried on treating children and adults with disabilities when he became professor of paediatric dentistry at the University of Amsterdam in 1975.
