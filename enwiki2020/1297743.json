    "text": "The National Republican Movement for Democracy and Development (Mouvement r\u00e9publicain national pour la d\u00e9mocratie et le d\u00e9veloppement) was the ruling political party of Rwanda from 1975 to 1994 under President Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana. Between 1975 and 1991, when it was known as the National Revolutionary Movement for Development (, MRND), the MRND was the only legal political party in the country. It was dominated by Hutus, particularly from President Juvenal Habyarimana's home region of Northern Rwanda. The elite group of MRND party members who were known to have influence on the President and his wife are known as the akazu. Following the Rwandan genocide in 1994, the MRND was banned. ==History== The party was established by Habyarimana on 5 July 1975, exactly two years after he had ousted the first post-independence president Gr\u00e9goire Kayibanda in a coup d'\u00e9tat. Habyarimana established a totalitarian state and banned the Parmehutu party, which had been dominated by Hutus from southern Rwanda. The MRND succeeded the Parmehutu in its position of the dominant state party. A new constitution was approved in a 1978 referendum, making the country a one-party state in which every citizen was automatically considered to be a member of the MRND.Aimable Twagilimana (2007) Historical Dictionary of Rwanda, Scarecrow Press, p. 116.Constitution de la R\u00e9publique Rwandaise du 20 d\u00e9cembre 1978, Art. 7: \"Tout Rwandais est de plein droit membre du Mouvement r\u00e9volutionnaire national pour le d\u00e9veloppement.\" Presidential elections were held in 1978 with Habyarimana as the sole candidate. He was re-elected with 99% of the vote.Elections in Rwanda African Elections Database Parliamentary elections followed in 1981, with two MRND candidates contesting each of the 64 seats. Habyarimana was re-elected again in 1983 and 1988, whilst parliamentary elections were held under the same system in 1983 (with the National Assembly enlarged to 70 seats) and 1988. The party's name was changed after the legalisation of opposition parties in 1991. The youth wing of the party, the interahamwe, later developed into a militia group that played a key role in the Genocide against Tutsi. After Habyarimana's death in April 1994, hardline elements of the party were among the chief architects of the genocide; the Coalition for the Defence of the Republic (CDR), which played a significant role, was originally a hard-line faction of the MRND that became a separate party. After Rwanda was conquered by the rival Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front led by Paul Kagame, both the MRND and the CDR were driven from power and banned in July 1994.Robert E. Gribbin (2005) In the Aftermath of Genocide: The U.S. Role in Rwanda, iUniverse, p153 ==Ideology== Habyarimana was described as relatively moderate, though he (and his regime) are said to have used propaganda methods of the extreme right, ethnically discriminating against the Tutsi (albeit less extreme than their predecessors), advanced a conservative social agenda and were anti-communist. ==Structure== Habyarimana was the president of the party, and as such was the only candidate for president of the republic. However, in a minor concession to democracy, voters were presented with two MRND candidates at Legislative Assembly elections. After the RPF invasion in 1990, members of the MRND created the magazine Kangura. == Electoral history == === Presidential elections === {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !Election !Party candidate !Votes !% !Result |- |1978 | rowspan=\"3\" |Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana | |98.99% |Elected |- |1983 | |99.97% |Elected |- |1988 | |99.98% |Elected |} === Chamber of Deputies elections === {| class=wikitable style=text-align:center !Election !Party leader !Votes !% !Seats !+/\u2013 !Position !Government |- |1981 | rowspan=\"3\" |Juv\u00e9nal Habyarimana |2,100,770 |100% | | 64 | 1st | style=\"background-color:#CCFFCC\" |Sole legal party |- |1983 |2,364,592 |100% | | 6 | 1st | style=\"background-color:#CCFFCC\" |Sole legal party |- |1988 |2,701,682 |100% | | | 1st | style=\"background- color:#CCFFCC\" |Sole legal party |} == See also == *Parmehutu *Edouard Karemera *Coalition for the Defence of the Republic ==References== Category:Parties of one-party systems MRND Category:1975 establishments in Rwanda Category:Political parties established in 1975 Category:1994 disestablishments in Rwanda Category:Political parties disestablished in 1994 Category:Rwandan genocide Category:Banned far-right parties ",
