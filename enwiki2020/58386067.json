    "text": "Penny Rafferty Hamilton (born February 18, 1948) is an American retired pilot, aviation educator, writer, and photographer. She is noted for her two-year study of women in aviation, the Teaching Women to Fly Research Project, which identified barriers to women training as pilots and presented 101 strategies to increase the participation of women in aviation. She also interests children in aviation, giving talks in schools and libraries as the character \"Penny the Pilot\". She and her husband jointly hold a World Aviation Speed Record set in 1991. In addition to writing for aviation magazines, she has published books on the history of Granby, Colorado, where she has resided since 1989. She was inducted into the Colorado Aviation Hall of Fame in 2011 and the Colorado Women's Hall of Fame in 2014. ==Early life, education, and career== Penny Rafferty was born on February 18, 1948, in Pennsylvania. She earned her bachelor's degree from Columbia University, and an associate of arts degree in dental hygiene education from Temple University in 1968. She began working as a dental hygienist in a preventative dental clinic which she managed in Rhode Island, where she met her husband, a career military officer. Together they lived in different locations in the US and abroad, including Germany. Upon his retirement in 1979, they settled in Nebraska. They both attended the University of Nebraska, where she earned a master's degree in adult and continuing education and a Ph.D. in communications. She submitted her thesis on \"The Dental Hygienist: The First Half-Century, 1913 to 1963\". Hamilton worked as a professor of communications at the University of Nebraska while writing an advice column for the Sun Newspapers chain. She also hosted a radio program, and appeared weekly on television. Later she and her husband purchased a newspaper and opened a management consultancy and public relations business called Advanced Research Institute. One of their clients was the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association. ==Aviation activities== Hamilton became interested in flying after serving as a navigation and radio controller for her husband. She received her pilot's license in 1988. On October 22, 1991, the couple flew from Lincoln, Nebraska to New Orleans, Louisiana, at a speed of , completing the trip in 4 hours and 39 minutes. They set a World Aviation Speed Record for their weight class, which still stands. The record was verified by the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration A\u00e9ronautique Internationale and the National Aeronautic Association. She retired from flying in 2007. With an estimated 6 percent of licensed pilots in the US being women (in the UK the figure is less than 9 percent), Hamilton decided to promote the idea of flying to women and girls. Her first initiative was to interest children in aviation by giving talks in schools and library groups. She appears as the character \"Penny the Pilot\", dressing up in the vintage flying gear of famed woman aviator Amelia Earhart. In 2009, she received the 7 Everyday Hero Award from The Denver Channel for this initiative, and was similarly honored with the Federal Aviation Administration's Central Region Aviation Education Champion Award. Hamilton solicited a grant from the Wolf Aviation Fund to launch the Teaching Women to Fly Research Project in 2008. This two-year study queried women flight students and pilots, and male flight instructors, to identify what prevented women from pursuing flight training. Hamilton identified ten barriers to women entering the field, including: lack of money, a perceived indifference to women students on the part of flight training schools, lack of continuity as flight instructors leave their jobs and new ones take over the class, communication difficulties between women and male flight instructors, lack of female role models, unfamiliarity with mechanical systems, lack of experience with reading maps, lack of female mentorship, and lack of emotional support from friends and family. She also proposed 101 strategies to overcome these barriers, among them: \"the creation of low-interest loan programs for women in colleges and universities, web-based support communities for female pilots, and developing female friendly flight training to emphasize different learning styles and strengths\". The study led to the compilation of a textbook titled Absent Aviators: Gender Issues in Aviation (Ashgate, 2014), to which Hamilton contributed a chapter, and to a planned flight instructors communication manual. Hamilton was a co-founder of the Emily Warner Field Aviation Museum, which opened in July 2015 in the former Rocky Mountain Airways terminal in the Grand County Airport. As of 2018, she volunteers as a team leader at the museum on behalf of the Grand County Historical Association. She is also the volunteer director of the Colorado Airport History Preservation Project. ==Writing== Granby, Colorado Hamilton is a frequent contributor to aviation magazines, and has written two flight instruction manuals for women pilots.

She wrote and photographed a history of Around Granby for Arcadia Publishing's \"Images of America\" series, a local history book called Granby, Then & Now: A quick history (2005), and a book for young children, A to Z: Your Grand County History Alphabet (2017). She wrote the national aviation career and history book called \"America's Amazing Airports\" in 2019. ==Memberships== Hamilton is a member of the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association, which she has served as an Airport Support Network Volunteer since 1997.
