Home games were played on campus in Eugene at Hayward Field and at Multnomah Stadium in Portland. Under sixteenth-year head coach Len Casanova, the Ducks were 3\u20137 overall and 1\u20133 in the Athletic Association of Western Universities (AAWU, later Pacific-8 Conference, or Pac-8). Only one of the four conference teams from the state of California was on the schedule, Stanford in Portland, the sole conference victory. Oregon finished in a tie for sixth place in the AAWU, and were outscored by their opponents, 129 to 118. The team's statistical leaders included Mike Barnes with 710 passing yards, Steve Jones with 542 rushing yards, and Scott Cress with 402 receiving yards. This was the final season for Casanova as head coach and for varsity football at Hayward Field; Autzen Stadium debuted in 1967 with new head coach Jerry Frei. Casanova became athletic director and retired in 1970. ==Schedule== ==References== Oregon Category:Oregon Ducks football seasons Oregon Ducks football ",
