Mare\u0161 also travelled to Germany as part of the national team for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Mare\u0161 played for Czech 2. Liga side FC Svit Zl\u00edn before moving to Prague in 1999. He first played top-level football with Bohemians Prague in the 1999\u20132000 season, and made 58 appearances for Bohemians over two-and-a- half seasons. He signed for Sparta Prague in December 2001Profile at synotliga.cz . Retrieved 26 September 2014. after defender Vladim\u00edr Labant had left the club. Mare\u0161 sustained an ankle injury in his second match for Sparta Prague after his transfer, which caused him to be unavailable for Sparta's European Champions League game against Porto. In December 2002, Sparta rejected an approach from Russian side Zenit Saint Petersburg to sign Mare\u0161. In spite of that, Zenit's Czech manager Vlastimil Petr\u017eela, who had been manager when Mare\u0161 played for Bohemians, made Mare\u0161 his third Czech signing later the same month. ===Russia=== From 2003 to 2006, Mare\u0161 played for Zenit Saint Petersburg. He scored his first goal for that club in July 2003 in a 2\u20132 draw against Krylia Sovetov Samara. During his time in St. Petersburg, the club finished second in the 2003 Russian Premier League and reached the quarter finals of the 2005\u201306 UEFA Cup. In the 2006 season, Mare\u0161 suffered an ankle injury, causing him to miss matches in March and April. Following the arrival of Dick Advocaat as Zenit's manager the same season, Mare\u0161 played much less than before. In August 2006, Mare\u0161 agreed to a contract to play for English club Bolton Wanderers, however the deal was not completed, with his agent citing a failed medical as the reason for the breakdown. In January 2007, he left Zenit despite another year remaining on his contract. ===Return to the Czech Republic=== Mare\u0161 returned to Sparta Prague on a two-and-a-half- year contract in January 2007, going on to play two league matches for Sparta in the 2006\u201307 season but no matches in 2007\u201308. He spent the first half of the 2008\u201309 season in the Czech 2 Liga playing for Sparta's reserve team, which he captained. He transferred to Vyso\u010dina Jihlava, which played in the same league, midway through the season. Mare\u0161 spent six months in Jihlava before leaving the club at the end of the season, citing its failure to win promotion to the Czech First League as his reason for doing so. During his time in Jihlava, injuries limited him to two appearances for the club. In the summer of 2009, Mare\u0161 was one of nine players to join Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov, as the club prepared to return to the top league following their relegation. This move again reunited him with manager Vlastimil Petr\u017eela, but injuries restricted him to two appearances in the first half of the 2009\u201310 season. Later in 2010, Mare\u0161 played for FC P\u0159edn\u00ed Kopanina in the Czech Fourth Division. ==International career== Mare\u0161 first played for the Czech Republic in 2002, and later returned to the national team before a friendly match against Japan in April 2004, having played in no international matches since the February 2002 tournament in Cyprus. He played for the Czech Republic at Euro 2004, where the team reached the semi-finals. His only appearance in the tournament was in a group match against Germany among a group of players the BBC described as \"very much a Czech second string\". Mare\u0161 was part of the Czech Republic squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but did not play in the tournament. He finished his career having played ten matches for the Czech Republic between 2002 and 2006. ==Playing style== Mare\u0161 was a defender who could play as a centre-back or left-back. Following his nomination for the Czech Republic's 2006 World Cup squad, Reuters described Mare\u0161 as \"reliable backup to [Marek] Jankulovski, but less supporting in the attack\". ==Personal life== Mare\u0161' parents are called Jind\u0159i\u0161ka and Bohuslav. He has an older brother, Jan, with whom he grew up. ==Career statistics== ===International=== :Source: {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- |colspan=\"3\"|Czech Republic national team |- !Year!!!!Goals |- |2002||2||0 |- |2004||5||0 |- |2005||1||0 |- |2006||2||0 |- !Total||10||0 |} ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Living people Category:1976 births Category:Association football defenders Category:Czech footballers Category:Czech expatriate footballers Category:Czech Republic international footballers Category:Czech First League players Category:FC Fastav Zl\u00edn players Category:Bohemians 1905 players Category:AC Sparta Prague players Category:FC Vyso\u010dina Jihlava players Category:FK Viktoria \u017di\u017ekov players Category:Russian Premier League players Category:FC Zenit Saint Petersburg players Category:UEFA Euro 2004 players Category:2006 FIFA World Cup players Category:Expatriate footballers in Russia ",
