    "text": "A glidant is a substance that is added to a powder to improve its flowability. A glidant will only work at a certain range of concentrations. Above a certain concentration, the glidant will in fact function to inhibit flowability. In tablet manufacture, glidants are usually added just prior to compression. ==Examples== Examples of glidants include magnesium stearate, fumed silica (colloidal silicon dioxide), starch and talc. ==Mechanism of action== A glidant's effect is due to the counter-action of factors that cause poor flowability of powders. For instance, correcting surface irregularity, reducing interparticular friction and decreasing surface charge. The result is a decrease in the angle of repose which is an indication of an enhanced powder's flowability ==References== Category:Granularity of materials ",
