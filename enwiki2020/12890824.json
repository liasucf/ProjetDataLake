He was drafted by the Calgary Flames in the second round, 31st overall in the 1980 NHL Entry Draft. Curtale played only two games in his National Hockey League career, for the Flames in 1980\u201381 as a late season call-up from his junior hockey club, the Brantford Alexanders. He would spend the rest of his playing career in the minors, playing for the Colorado Flames for two seasons, before joining the Peoria Rivermen until his retirement in 1987. After his playing career, Curtale later served as the head coach of the Springfield Jr. Blues in the North American Hockey League (NAHL) from 1995 to 1997 and then the Windsor Spitfires of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) from 1997 to 1999.
