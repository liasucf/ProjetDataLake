The league champion then moved on to compete in the Western Canadian Junior A championship, the Western Canada Cup, in Estevan, Saskatchewan. If successful against the winners of the Alberta Junior Hockey League, Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League, Manitoba Junior Hockey League and the 2016 Western Canada Cup hosts, the Estevan Bruins, the champion and runner-up would then move on to play for the Canadian Junior Hockey League championship, the Royal Bank Cup, in Lloydmyinster, Saskatchewan ==League changes== *Wenatchee Wild joined the league from the North American Hockey League and began play in the Mainland Division. ==Standings== Note: GP = Games Played, W = Wins, L = Losses, T = Ties, OTL = Overtime Losses, Pts = Points {| cellpadding=\"0\" |- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\" | | {| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"width:650px; font-size:90%; border:1px solid gray;\" |- style=\"background:#cd8c8d;\" |colspan=\"4\"|Mainland Division |- ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Team ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Centre ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| W-L-T-OTL ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Points |- | Chilliwack Chiefs || Chilliwack, BC || 38-13-3-4 || 83 |- | Wenatchee Wild || Wenatchee, Washington, USA || 34-16-4-4 || 76 |- | Langley Rivermen || Langley Township, BC || 31-22-2-3|| 67 |- | Coquitlam Express || Coquitlam, BC || 22-29-1-6 || 51 |- | Prince George Spruce Kings || Prince George, BC|| 14-38-2-4 || 34 |- | Surrey Eagles || White Rock, BC || 7-48-2-1 || 17 |- style=\"background:#cd8c8d;\" |colspan=\"4\"|Island Division |- ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Team ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Centre ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| W-L-T-OTL ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Points |- | Nanaimo Clippers || Nanaimo, BC || 38-18-1-1 || 78 |- | Powell River Kings || Powell River, BC || 33-20-1-4 || 71 |- | Cowichan Valley Capitals || Duncan, BC || 27-25-3-3 || 60 |- | Alberni Valley Bulldogs || Port Alberni, BC ||23-27-4-4 || 54 |- | Victoria Grizzlies || Victoria, BC || 24-30-0-4 || 52 |- style=\"background:#cd8c8d;\" |colspan=\"4\"|Interior Division |- ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Team ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Centre ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| W-L-T-OTL ! style=\"background:#ddd;\"| Points |- |Penticton Vees || Penticton, BC || 50-7-1-0 || 101 |- |West Kelowna Warriors || West Kelowna, BC || 38-17-1-2 || 79 |- |Salmon Arm Silverbacks || Salmon Arm, BC || 29-20-4-5 || 67 |- |Vernon Vipers || Vernon, BC || 24-31-0-3 || 51 |- |Merritt Centennials || Merritt, BC || 23-30-1-4 || 51 |- |Trail Smoke Eaters || Trail, BC || 23-33-0-2 || 48 |} |} *Standings listed on the official league website. http://bchl.ca/team-stats ==2015\u201316 BCHL Fred Page Cup Playoffs== ===Division playoffs=== ===Semi-final Round Robin=== The 2016 semifinal simplifies the double round robin concept with the \"Three Wins To Get In\" format. The first two teams to three wins advances to the final with the first team to reach three wins getting home ice advantage, while the remaining team is eliminated. In case of a tie, the two tied teams will play a one game playoff to determine the second spot in the finals. In a three way tie, the teams will face off in a Page playoff format, starting with Chilliwack vs. West Kelowna. The loser of that game would play Nanaimo, and the winners from both games advance to the final. :{| cellpadding=\"1\" width=\"340px\" style=\"font-size: 90%; border: 1px solid gray;\" |- ! style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" width=\"25\" |Team ! style=\"background: #eeeeee;\" width=\"10\" |Wins |- | Chilliwack || 3 |- | West Kelowna || 3 |- | Nanaimo || 2 |} ===Fred Page Cup Final=== ===2016 Western Canada Cup=== The Fred Page Cup Champion West Kelowna Warriors advanced to the 2016 Western Canada Cup in Estevan, Saskatchewan where they will play for one of two spots in the 2016 Royal Bank Cup, where they finished first.
