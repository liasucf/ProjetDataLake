    "text": "Holt Junction was a railway station which served the village of Holt, Wiltshire, England between 1861 and 1966. It stood on the Wessex Main Line at its junction with the western end of the Devizes branch. == History == The Wilts, Somerset and Weymouth Railway Company opened their line southward from near Chippenham, at first only as far as Westbury, in 1848; the line passed Holt village to the southeast but there were no local stations. The company sold its line to the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1850. In 1857 the GWR completed the Devizes branch line, which met the earlier line to the east of the village. By 1861 there was a single-platform station at the junction to allow passengers to transfer between main line and branch trains. Holt Junction station opened to passengers in 1874, although the only access from the village was by footpath; in 1877 a road connection was made and a goods shed was added. In 1862 the GWR extended its Reading-Hungerford line westward via to Devizes, creating a route from London Paddington to the South West. However, usage of the Devizes line declined from 1900 after the opening of the shorter Stert-Westbury link. In 1897 the Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company (later Nestl\u00e9) converted Staverton Mill, about one mile from the station, for condensed milk production. In 1909 a large covered loading bay was built to the west of the station; this remained in use until 1934, when the factory gained a direct rail connection. From 1905 the GWR used rail motors (self- propelled carriages) to provide local services on the Chippenham-Westbury line and the Devizes branch. == Closure == The goods yard closed in 1963 and the rest of the station, along with the branch line, closed in 1966. == References == Category:Disused railway stations in Wiltshire Category:Former Great Western Railway stations Category:Railway stations in Great Britain opened in 1861 Category:Railway stations in Great Britain closed in 1966 Category:Beeching closures in England Category:1861 establishments in England ",
