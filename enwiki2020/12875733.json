He was a member of the Hayashi clan of Confucian scholars. Following in the footsteps of his father, Hayashi Razan, Gah\u014d (formerly Harukatsu) would devote a lifetime to expressing and disseminating the official neo-Confucian doctrine of the Tokugawa shogunate. Like his distinguished father, Gah\u014d's teaching and scholarly written work emphasized Neo-Confucianist virtues and order.Ponsonby-Fane, R. (1956). Kyoto: the Old Capital of Japan, 794-1869, p. 418. ==Academician== Gah\u014d became the unofficial rector of what would become Edo\u2019s Confucian Academy, the Sh\u014dhei-k\u014d (afterwards known as the Yushima Seid\u014d).Nussbaum, Louis Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric et al.. (2005). Japan Encyclopedia, p. 300. This institution stood at the apex of the country-wide educational and training system which was created and maintained by the Tokugawa shogunate. Gah\u014d's hereditary title was Daigaku-no-kami, which, in the context of the Tokugawa shogunate hierarchy, effectively translates as \"head of the state university.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 418. In the elevated context his father engendered, Gah\u014d worked on editing a chronicle of Japanese emperors compiled in conformance with his father's principles. Nihon \u014cdai Ichiran grew into a seven-volume text which was completed in 1650. Gah\u014d himself was accepted as a noteworthy scholar in that period; but the potent Sh\u014dhei-k\u014d and Hayashi family links to the work\u2019s circulation are part of the explanation for this work's 18th and 19th century popularity. Contemporary readers must have found some degree of usefulness in this summary drawn from historical records. The narrative of Nihon \u014cdai Ichiran stops around 1600, most likely in deference to the sensibilities of the Tokugawa regime. Gah\u014d's text did not continue up through his present day; rather, he terminated the chronicles just before the last pre-Tokugawa ruler. Gah\u014d modestly observed that \"in a book intended for the shogun's eyes, it is incumbent upon one to be circumspect.\"Hoffman, Michael. \"A man in the soul of Japan\", Japan Times, September 10, 2006. This book was published in the mid-17th century and it was reissued in 1803, \"perhaps because it was a necessary reference work for officials.\"Screech, Secret Memoirs of the Shoguns: Isaac Titsingh and Japan, 1779-1822. p. 65. Gah\u014d would become his father's successor as advisor to the shogun. He was, in his lifetime, the Tokugawa shogunate's chief scholar. After Razan's death, Gah\u014d finished work his father had begun, including a number of other works designed to help readers learn from Japan's history. In 1665, Gah\u014d published an anthology of historical poems (Honch\u014d Ichinin Isshu).Keene, Donald. (1999). Travelers of a Hundred Ages, p.430. In 1670, the Hayashi family's scholarly reputation was burnished when Gah\u014d published the 310 volumes of .Brownlee, John. (1999). Political Thought in Japanese Historical Writing, p. 120 Together with his brother, Hayashi Dokk\u014dsai (formerly Morikatsu), Gah\u014d compiled, edited and posthumously published selections from their father's body of writings: * Hayashi Razan bunsh\u016b (The Collected Works of Hayashi Razan), reissued in 1918 * Razan Sensei Issh\u016b (Master Razan's Poems), reissued in 1921 Gah\u014d's son, Hayashi H\u014dk\u014d (formerly Nobuatsu), would eventually inherit the position as head of the Sh\u014dhei-k\u014d or Yushima Seid\u014d, as well as the honorific Daigaku-no kami; and his progeny would continue the Hayashi traditions. In January 1858, it would be the hereditary Daigaku-no- kami descendant of Hayashi Razan and Hayashi Gah\u014d who would head the bakufu delegation which sought advice from the emperor in deciding how to deal with newly assertive foreign powers. This would have been the first time the Emperor's counsel was actively sought since the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate. The most easily identified consequence of this transitional overture would be the increased numbers of messengers which were constantly streaming back and forth between Tokyo and Kyoto during the next decade. There is no small irony in the fact that this 19th-century scholar/bureaucrat would find himself at a crucial nexus of managing political change\u2014moving arguably \"by the book\" through uncharted waters with well-settled theories as the only guide.Ponsonby-Fane, p. 324. ==Selected works== * Kan'ei shoka keizu-den (with Hayashi Razan), a genealogy of warrior families. * Honch\u014d tsugan (with Haayshi Razan), a history of Japan. * Kokushi jitsuroki. * Nihon \u014cdai ichiran. * Kan'ei keizu (1643). ==See also== * Hayashi clan (Confucian scholars) ==Notes== ==References== Flags mark the entrance to the reconstructed Yushima Seid\u014d (Tokyo). * Brownlee, John S.
