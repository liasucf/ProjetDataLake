During the 1770s, she was respected for her inventive management of her estate: regarded as an agrarian role model, it was suggested that she be given a medal of the Patriotic Society for her achievements. Among her projects was to provide her workers with instruction in spinning linen. ==References== Category:1730 births Category:1784 deaths Category:18th-century Finnish businesspeople Category:Finnish landowners Category:18th-century women landowners Category:18th-century landowners ",
