DBA Sinclair Communications. ==History== When KSXY began broadcasting operations, the station was at 95.9 MHz and was billed as SEXY 95.9 airing a Top 40 Mainstream format. After the purchase of the station by Sinclair Broadcasting in 2001, the station moniker was changed from Sexy to Hot and swapped signals with its sister station KRSH and renamed HOT 98.7.http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA83855.html After 2 years airing a rhythmic format, Hot 98.7 changed back to their original mainstream format. In July 2006, Hot 98.7 changed formats again to Top 40/Rhythmic and became Hot 98.7 \"Blazin' Hip-Hop and R&B;!\" On August 23, 2007, KSXY changed formats once more to rhythmic pop-leaning Adult Top 40 and began billing the station as \"Y 98.7\", with emphasis on 80s, 90s and current music. This format change coincides with the transfer of the station license to Commonwealth Communications which has been co-owner of the Sinclair Santa Rosa Cluster. On February 8, 2008, KSXY moved to 100.9 FM in yet another frequency swap, this time with KXTS which took over the 98.7 FM frequency. In July 2011, KSXY began shifting its direction back to Rhythmic Top 40, thus putting it in competition with KHTH after it debuted with a Mainstream Top 40 direction. Some country music was mixed into the rotation in 2015. On September 8, 2017, KSXY flipped to alternative rock as \"Modern Alternative, The 101\". The change returned the format to the market after Sinclair dropped the format on KNOB 5 months prior.Y100.9 Santa Rosa Gives Way To Alternative \u201cThe 101\u201d Radioinsight - September 12, 2017 KSXY launched a Spanish CHR format on its HD2 subchannel, branded as \"Latino 95.5\". ==Former logo== Image:WSXY.PNG ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:Napa County, California SXY Category:Radio stations established in 1996 Category:Alternative rock radio stations in the United States ",
