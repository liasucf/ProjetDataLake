Mainly a right-back and a player of great speed, he can also operate as a right winger. Having spent his early career at a string of lower-league and reserve teams, he became a regular at Almer\u00eda, helping them to promotion to La Liga, and also won the Europa League with Sevilla before signing for Barcelona in 2015 for \u20ac17 million. Three seasons later, he returned to Sevilla. Vidal won one cap for Spain, in 2015. ==Club career== ===Early years=== Born in Valls, Tarragona, Catalonia, and raised in neighbouring Puigpelat, Vidal started his career as a forward. He signed for RCD Espanyol in 2007 to further his development after having already made his senior debut with CF Reus Deportiu, but never appeared for the former's first team, finishing his only senior season with the club on loan to Panthrakikos F.C. from Greece. On 31 August 2009, Vidal moved to Segunda Divisi\u00f3n side Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona, but spent the vast majority of the season with CF Pobla de Mafumet, the farm team. He joined RCD Mallorca in the middle of 2010, being assigned to the reserves in Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B. ===Almer\u00eda=== In mid- June 2011, after suffering relegation, Vidal joined another reserve team also in that tier, UD Almer\u00eda B.El Almer\u00eda B ficha a Aleix Vidal, del Mallorca, y a Javi Manzano, del Poli Ejido (Almer\u00eda B sign Aleix Vidal, from Mallorca, and Javi Manzano, from Poli Ejido); UD Almer\u00eda, 15 June 2011 He made his debut for the Andalusians' main squad on 27 August 2011, against C\u00f3rdoba CF.

He made his competitive debut on 12 August in the 2014 UEFA Super Cup at the Cardiff City Stadium, playing 66 minutes before being substituted for fellow debutant Iago Aspas in a 0\u20132 loss to Real Madrid; he found the net on his league debut 11 days later, opening the scoring in a 1\u20131 home draw against Valencia CF. On 7 May 2015, in a game in which he featured as right back until Coke entered the field in the 58th minute \u2013 he was often used by manager Unai Emery in that position during the campaign\u2013 Vidal scored twice and also provided an assist to Kevin Gameiro, in a 3\u20130 home win against ACF Fiorentina in the semi-finals of the UEFA Europa League. He started in the final 20 days later, a 3\u20132 victory over Dnipro in Warsaw. ===Barcelona=== On 7 June 2015, Vidal signed a five-year contract with FC Barcelona, for an \u20ac18 million fee plus four in add- ons. He underwent a medical on the following day, being also officially presented. Due to an embargo placed on the club by FIFA for breaking rules on signing under-age foreign players, he was not permitted to appear in competitive games until January 2016. Vidal made his official debut for the Blaugrana on 6 January 2016, replacing Dani Alves midway through the second half of a 4\u20131 home win over former club Espanyol for the season's Copa del Rey. Subsequently, he was completely ostracised by manager Luis Enrique. On 14 January 2017, profiting from the absence of habitual starting right-back Sergi Roberto, Vidal opened his league account for Barcelona, contributing to a 5\u20130 rout of UD Las Palmas at the Camp Nou. On 11 February, in the last minutes of a 6\u20130 away win against Deportivo Alav\u00e9s, he dislocated his ankle following a challenge by Theo Hernandez, being ruled out for the rest of the campaign. ===Return to Sevilla=== On 4 August 2018, Vidal returned to Sevilla for a fee of \u20ac8.5 million plus 2 million in variables. However, he struggled to settle in the first team, being also deemed surplus to requirements by new manager Julen Lopetegui in July 2019. On 28 July 2019, Vidal was loaned out to fellow top-tier club Alav\u00e9s in a season-long deal. ==International career== Catalonia Vidal made his debut for Catalonia on 30 December 2013, playing the second half of a 4\u20131 win over Cape Verde at the Estadi Ol\u00edmpic Llu\u00eds Companys.

He made his debut in the 2\u20131 victory against the former at the Estadio Reino de Le\u00f3n, playing the entire first half before being substituted for his former Sevilla partner Vitolo. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season !colspan=\"3\"|League !colspan=\"2\"|Copa del Rey !colspan=\"2\"|Europe !colspan=\"2\"|Other !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- |Reus |2006\u201307 |rowspan=\"2\"|Tercera Divisi\u00f3n |1||0||colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |Espanyol B |2008\u201309 |2||0||colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||2||0 |- |Panthrakikos |2008\u201309 |Super League Greece |8||0||colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||8||0 |- |Pobla Mafumet |2009\u201310 |Tercera Divisi\u00f3n |31||7||colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||31||7 |- |Gimn\u00e0stic |2009\u201310 |Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |1||0||0||0||colspan=\"4\"|\u2014||1||0 |- |Mallorca B |2010\u201311 |rowspan=\"2\"|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B |35||6||colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||35||6 |- |Almer\u00eda B |2011\u201312 |1||2||colspan=\"6\"|\u2014||1||2 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Almer\u00eda |2011\u201312 |rowspan=\"2\"|Segunda Divisi\u00f3n |41||5||2||0||colspan=\"4\"|\u2014||43||5 |- |2012\u201313 |37||4||4||1||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||4Appearances in the 2012\u201313 promotion play- offs||2||45||7 |- |2013\u201314 |La Liga |38||6||4||1||colspan=\"4\"|\u2014||42||7 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !116!!15!!10!!2!!colspan=\"2\"|\u2014!!4!!2!!130!!19 |- |Sevilla |2014\u201315 |rowspan=\"4\"|La Liga |31||4||4||0||11Appearances in UEFA Europa League||2||1Appearances in UEFA Super Cup |0||47||6 |- |rowspan=\"4\"|Barcelona |2015\u201316 |9||0||5||0||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||14||0 |- |2016\u201317 |6||2||4||0||1Appearances in UEFA Champions League||0||1Appearances in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a||0||12||2 |- |2017\u201318 |15||1||5||1||4||0||1||0||25||2 |- !colspan=\"2\"|Total !30||3||14||1||5||0||2||0||51||4 |- |Sevilla |2018\u201319 |La Liga |11||0||2||0||7Appearances in UEFA Europa League||0||1Appearances in Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a||0||21||0 |- |Alav\u00e9s |2019\u201320 |rowspan=\"1\"|La Liga |24||2||0||0||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||colspan=\"2\"|\u2014||24||2 |- !colspan=\"3\"|Career total !291!!39!!29!!3!!24!!2!!7!!2!!251!!46 |} ;Notes ==Honours== ===Club=== Sevilla *UEFA Europa League: 2014\u201315 Barcelona *La Liga: 2015\u201316, 2017\u201318 *Copa del Rey: 2015\u201316, 2016\u201317, 2017\u201318 *Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a: 2016 ===Individual=== *UEFA Europa League Squad of the Season: 2014\u201315 ==References== ==External links== *FC Barcelona official profile * * * Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:People from Valls Category:Spanish footballers Category:Catalan footballers Category:Association football defenders Category:Association football wingers Category:Association football utility players Category:La Liga players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n players Category:Segunda Divisi\u00f3n B players Category:Tercera Divisi\u00f3n players Category:CF Reus Deportiu footballers Category:CF Damm players Category:RCD Espanyol B footballers Category:CF Pobla de Mafumet footballers Category:Gimn\u00e0stic de Tarragona footballers Category:RCD Mallorca B players Category:UD Almer\u00eda B players Category:UD Almer\u00eda players Category:Sevilla FC players Category:FC Barcelona players Category:Deportivo Alav\u00e9s players Category:Super League Greece players Category:Panthrakikos F.C. players Category:UEFA Europa League winning players Category:Spain international footballers Category:Catalonia international footballers Category:Spanish expatriate footballers Category:Expatriate footballers in Greece Category:Spanish expatriate sportspeople in Greece ",
