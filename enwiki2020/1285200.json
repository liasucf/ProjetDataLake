He was drafted by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 12th overall in the 1997 NFL Draft, after playing college football at Florida State. Dunn was named AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year in 1997 and earned three Pro Bowl selections in his career. After his playing career, Dunn took a minority stake in the Falcons' ownership group led by Arthur Blank. ==Early years== At Catholic High in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, Dunn played quarterback, cornerback, and running back. During his sophomore year, he helped lead Catholic High to the state 4A championship game for the first time in its history. He was an All-America honorable mention selection by USA Today as a senior. On January 7, 1993, Dunn's mother, Betty Smothers, an off-duty police officer escorting a businesswoman to a bank to make a night deposit, was ambushed and killed by two armed robbers. Dunn, two days after his 18th birthday, became the head of his family and raised his siblings. Three men were sent to prison for the murder of Smothers. The getaway driver was sentenced to twenty-five years. The two shooters, Kevan Brumfield and Henri Broadway, were sentenced to death. Broadway remains on death row but Brumfield was resentenced to life on July 20, 2016, after he was ruled mentally disabled. Dunn had met with Brumfield at the Louisiana State Penitentiary in 2007, and offered his forgiveness. ==College career== Dunn played college football at Florida State University, where he rushed for over 1,000 yards in 3 straight seasons. He graduated in 1997 with a bachelor's degree in information studies. He was a three-time All- ACC selection. Dunn's jersey, along with those of other Seminoles players such as Fred Biletnikoff, Ron Sellers, Ron Simmons, Charlie Ward, Deion Sanders, and Chris Weinke, has been retired by the university. His number (28) may still be worn by Seminole players, but his jersey will be displayed in the Moore Athletic Center at FSU. He also won a national championship in 1993 with Florida State. ===Track and field=== Warrick Dunn was also an accomplished track and field star, named as an Associated Press All-American as a member of Florida State's Men's 4x100m relay team.

HFTH recipient families are chosen through a partnership with Habitat for Humanity affiliates and WDC with complete home furnishings and down-payment assistance. As of July 2012, HFTH has assisted over 150 single parents and over 300 dependents in Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Tampa and Tallahassee. By providing families with a positive home environment, WDC believes that children can thrive educationally, socially and economically.

He currently plays for the Houston Texans. Dunn's achievements have been recognized over the years.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, Dunn challenged all NFL players, except for those who play for the New Orleans Saints, to donate at least $5,000 to the effort. The effort received over $5 million in contributions. In 2007, Dunn, along with Andre Agassi, Muhammad Ali, Lance Armstrong, Jeff Gordon, Mia Hamm, Tony Hawk, Andrea Jaeger, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Mario Lemieux, Alonzo Mourning and Cal Ripken, Jr., founded Athletes for Hope, a charitable organization that helps professional athletes, sports industry professionals and fans get involved in charitable causes.

He also received a Jefferson Award for Outstanding Athlete in Service and Philanthropy in 2011. ===Writing=== Dunn's 2008 autobiography, Running For My Life , details his mother's murder and his battles with depression throughout his life.Dunn Finds Closure After Tragedy ESPN.com, January 25, 2009 ==References== ==External links== * *The Warrick Dunn Foundation *Athletes for Hope Category:Sportspeople from Baton Rouge, Louisiana Category:Catholic High School (Baton Rouge, Louisiana) alumni Category:American football running backs Category:Florida State Seminoles football players Category:Tampa Bay Buccaneers players Category:Atlanta Falcons players Category:National Football League Offensive Rookie of the Year Award winners Category:National Conference Pro Bowl players Category:1975 births Category:Living people Category:Players of American football from Louisiana ",
