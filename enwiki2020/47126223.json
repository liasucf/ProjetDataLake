    "text": "Le sh\u00e9rif (The Sheriff) is an op\u00e9ra comique in three acts composed by Fromental Hal\u00e9vy to a libretto by Eug\u00e8ne Scribe. It was premiered by the Op\u00e9ra-Comique at the Salle de la Bourse in Paris on 2 September 1839. Based on a short story by Balzac, the opera is set in the London Docklands during the late 18th century.Letellier, Robert Ignatius (2010). Op\u00e9ra-Comique: A Sourcebook, pp. 410\u2013411. Cambridge Scholars Publishing. Blanchard, Henri (5 September 1839). \"Le Sh\u00e9rif\", pp. 353\u2013355. Revue et gazette musicale de Paris, Vol. 6, No. 45 ==Background and performance history== Scribe frequently borrowed from Balzac's collection of interlinked novels and stories, La Com\u00e9die humaine, for his plays and libretti. The basic plot of his libretto for Le sh\u00e9rif was taken from the Com\u00e9die humaine novella Ma\u00eetre Corn\u00e9lius (Master Cornelius). Balzac's Master Cornelius is Louis XI's money-lender who lives in an old mansion where his gold keeps mysteriously disappearing. Scribe transferred the setting to late 18th-century London and provided a happy ending. Cornelius became Sir James Turner, the High-Sheriff of London. Like Cornelius, he is discovered as the thief of his own property which occurs while he is sleepwalking. However, unlike Cornelius who commits suicide on learning the truth, Sheriff Turner lives to tell the tale.Lawton, Frederick (1910). Balzac, pp. 357\u2013358 XVI. G. Richards, Ltd. According to cultural historian Robert Letellier, Hal\u00e9vy's score for Le sh\u00e9rif revealed a \"powerful originality\", as had the scores for two of his previous op\u00e9ras comiques, L'\u00e9clair and Les treize. However, the score's eclecticism proved unpopular with the Parisian public. Following its premiere on 2 September 1839 with Henry Deshaynes in the title role, the opera ran for thirteen more performances at the Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l'Op\u00e9ra-Comique-Bourse but was not revived there. A brief article in The Foreign Quarterly Review reported that Le sh\u00e9rif was given in Prague in early 1841 with a Czech libretto adapted by Alois Svoboda, but it was not a success \"owing to the inefficient manner\" in which the role of Sir James Turner was sung.The Foreign Quarterly Review (April). \"Music Abroad and at Home\", p. 119. The opera's orchestral score was published by Maurice Schlesinger in 1839. The following year Stephen Heller composed his Op. 17, six caprices for piano based on an aria from Le sh\u00e9rif.Sch\u00fctz, Rudolf (1911). Stephen Heller: ein K\u00fcnstlerleben, p. 133. Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel Various fantasies based on the opera and arrangements for solo piano or violin were also published by minor composers such as Edouard Wolff, Henri Panofka, and Auguste Panseron. ==Roles== {| class=\"wikitable\" !Role !Voice type !Premiere castScribe, Eug\u00e8ne (1839).
