    "text": "Hockey Homicide is a cartoon made by Walt Disney Productions in 1945, featuring Goofy. ==Synopsis== Narrator Doodles Weaver explains the rules of ice hockey in satirical format. The narration's emphasis on good sportsmanship is countered by the violence of the players (all of them \"played\" by Goofy). Team captains Ice Box Bertino and Fearless Ferguson are rivals who brutally fight each other and incur a penalty before the game can begin, sending both of them to the penalty box; subsequently, they are constantly released from the box only to be sent back to it as they cannot help but fight each other on the ice. Eventually, confusion over many extra hockey pucks leads the players and spectators to get into a massive brawl, during which snippets from other Disney cartoons (including Pinocchio, How to Play Football, How to Play Baseball, and Victory Through Air Power) are included to emphasize the mass confusion. Meanwhile, the Loose Leafs' and the Ant Eaters' team members excitedly and intently watch the action from high in the stands while enjoying themselves, with the closing narration implying that they irritate each other's fans into fighting so the players themselves can watch instead. ==References== == External links == * Category:1945 films Category:1945 animated films Category:Disney animated short films, 1940s Category:American films Category:Goofy (Disney) short films Category:American ice hockey films Category:Sports animation Category:Films directed by Jack Kinney Category:Films produced by Walt Disney Category:Films scored by Paul Smith (film and television composer) Category:American sports comedy films Category:1940s sports comedy films Category:1945 short films Category:1940s American animated films Category:1945 comedy films ",
