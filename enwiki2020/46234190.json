    "text": "Bo\u017eo Vre\u0107o (; born 18 October 1983) is a Bosnian musician. == Childhood == Bo\u017eo Vre\u0107o, a Bosnian Serb, was born in Fo\u010da, SR Bosnia and Herzegovina, SFR Yugoslavia on October 18, 1983. His father died when he was five years old, and he grew up with his mother and two sisters. His mother was an artist and encouraged Vre\u0107o to paint and draw, as well as to learn music. He taught himself how to read and write music, as well as sing, from the Internet. As an effeminate boy, Vre\u0107o experienced many struggles growing up in his provincial home town, and was frequently bullied. == Professional career== Vre\u0107o went to Belgrade, Serbia to earn his Masters in Archeology, but realized that his true passion was sevdalinka. At age 27, he began learning how to sing from traditional recordings. He then traveled to Sarajevo. A local musician discovered Vre\u0107o singing in a cafe and invited him to perform in the band Halka, with whom he recorded his first CD. Prior to his musical career, Vre\u0107o worked as an archaeology professor. He began performing professionally with the band Halka in 2013, and gained fame within and away from the Balkans at sold out concerts and international music festivals. Vre\u0107o performed as the lead singer for Halka, recording two albums with them in 2013 and 2015, which resulted in a world tour In 2014, in between recording two albums with Halka, Vre\u0107o recorded his first solo album, Moj Sevdah, where he performed seventeen sevdalinkas in a cappella style, including two original songs. By 2015, Vre\u0107o became known and written about in the English-speaking world. In 2017, Vre\u0107o recorded his second solo album, Pandora, which included performances with Marko Louis, Indigo, Velahavie, and Merima Klju\u010do. Two songs from the album Moj Sevdah will be part of Ko\u0161tana, a play directed by Kokan Mladenovi\u0107. Vre\u0107o had a leading role in the play. The Swedish national television station will produce a documentary about Vre\u0107o, his life, and his devotion to sevdalinka. In addition to sevdalinka, Vre\u0107o enjoys jazz, blues and soul, and tries to bring their elements into his interpretation of sevdalinka. He is inspired by the musical artists Himzo Polovina, Selim Salihovi\u0107, Emina Ze\u010daj, and Nada Mamula. Vre\u0107o performs as both female and male, as he sees himself as a person of both genders. At the beginning of his career, Vre\u0107o wore men's suits, then decided to perform as what he considers his true self. It is his belief that a person who sings songs of courage should present nothing but honesty to their audience, which is one reason why more traditional audiences love him. He takes offense at those who consider him a drag performer. As a reviver of a traditional women's genre, Vre\u0107o defends the place of women in Bosnian society by singing their songs. He wears his hair long, with kohl around his eyes, and dresses in kaftans, dresses, or floating coats as he spins and sings on stage. At the same time, he is a bearded man. His performances are continually sold out in a patriarchal Balkan society, and his fans cross gender and ethnic boundaries. Vre\u0107o hopes that, through his musical performances, he can also be a voice for LGBT rights in the Balkans. == Personal life == In some interviews, Vre\u0107o has identified as gay, but he consistently states that he is both female and male and that he is a free person who will not hide his true self. When he is not performing, Vre\u0107o writes, paints, and enjoys traveling for pleasure. While he still lives in Sarajevo, he tries to go home to Fo\u010da as frequently as possible to visit his family. == Discography == ===Albums with Halka=== *Halka (2013) *O ljubavi (2014) ===Solo albums=== *Moj sevdah (2014) *Pandora (2017) *MELEK (2018) *Lacrimae (2020) == References == Category:Bosnia and Herzegovina musicians Category:Sevdalinka Category:1983 births Category:People from Fo\u010da Category:Gay musicians Category:Living people Category:Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:LGBT people from Bosnia and Herzegovina ",
