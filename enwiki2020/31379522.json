However, the 17.5 mile portion between Cohasset and Duxbury, Massachusetts, was not built until 1871 when a new company, the Duxbury and Cohasset Railroad completed the line to South Duxbury and Kingston where it connected to the old 1844 Old Colony Railroad line to Plymouth.Report of the Board of Railroad Commissioners, Feb 15, 1911, page 419 One of the early promoters and presidents of the South Shore Railroad was Caleb Stetson, a successful shoe manufacturer from Braintree.Caleb Stetson bio The 1849 section of the South Shore Railroad was acquired by the Old Colony Railroad in 1877, while the section between Cohasset and Duxbury became part of the Old Colony network in 1904. By this time, the entire Old Colony Railroad network was operated under lease agreement by the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The New Haven ceased passenger service on the South Shore Line and much of the rest of the Old Colony system in 1959. On October 31, 2007, commuter rail passenger service on the line was restored from Boston to Greenbush with the opening of the MBTA Greenbush Line. ==Nantasket Beach Railroad== 1881 timetable card.
