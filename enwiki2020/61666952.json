Johannes Stephani Bellinus (died 1617) was a Swedish prelate and vicar in Enk\u00f6ping, Sweden. Johannes Stephani Bellinus was son to Stephanus Andreae and brother to Olaus Stephani Bellinus and Christopherus Stephani Bellinus. He served as pastor in B\u00e4linge, Archdiocese of Uppsala 1572 and in Enk\u00f6ping. He participated at the Uppsala synod in 1593. Bellinus was in good standing to the kings John III och Sigismund but not the Duke Charles, who opposed his appointment altogether despite vocal advocacy by the local community. Johannes Stephani Bellinus was discharged from his office at the time that the same thing happened to his brother, bishop Olaus Stephani Bellinus. Despite attributions to high age, unapproval of Duke Charles seems to have been a major factor. Bellinus was succeeded by Ericus Olai Skepperus. Bellinus retreated to the estate that he had been given by King Sigismund, where he ended his days. He died in 1617 and was buried in the Church of Our Lady in Enk\u00f6ping, Sweden, with the inscription: ==References== ==External links== *Ihrsta Category:Year of birth unknown Category:1617 deaths Category:Signatories of the Uppsala Synod Category:Swedish priests Category:Archdiocese of Uppsala ",
