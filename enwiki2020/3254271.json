    "text": "Centre for Mathematical Sciences, Cambridge The Faculty of Mathematics at the University of Cambridge comprises the Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) and the Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP). It is housed in the Centre for Mathematical Sciences site in West Cambridge, alongside the Isaac Newton Institute. Many distinguished mathematicians have been members of the faculty. == Some current members == ===DPMMS=== *B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s *John Coates *Timothy Gowers *Peter Johnstone *Imre Leader *Gabriel Paternain ====Statistical Laboratory==== *John Aston *Geoffrey Grimmett *Frank Kelly *Ioannis Kontoyiannis *Richard Nickl *James Norris *Richard Samworth *David Spiegelhalter *Richard Weber ===DAMTP=== *John Barrow, cosmologist and writer *Gary Gibbons * Julia Gog, professor of mathematical biology * Raymond E. Goldstein *Rich Kerswell *Paul Linden *Michael Green *Peter Haynes, fluid dynamicist *John Hinch, fluid dynamicist, retired 2014 *Richard Jozsa *John Papaloizou *Malcolm Perry *David Tong, theoretical physicist *Paul Townsend *Grae Worster, editor for the Journal of Fluid Mechanics ==Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics== The Department of Pure Mathematics and Mathematical Statistics (DPMMS) was created in 1964 under the headship of Sir William Hodge. It was housed in a converted warehouse at 16 Mill Lane, adjacent to its sister department DAMTP, until its move around 2000 to the present Centre for Mathematical Sciences where it occupies Pavilions C, D, and E. ===Heads of department=== *1964\u20131969 W. V. D. Hodge *1969\u20131984 J. W. S. Cassels *1984\u20131991 D. J. H. Garling *1991\u20131997 John H. Coates *1997\u20132002 W. B. R.

It was created in 1947 with accommodation in a \"temporary hut\", and was established on 21 March 1953 within the Faculty of Mathematics. It moved in 1958 to the basement of the new Chemistry Department in Lensfield Road, and then formed part of the new Department (DPMMS) in Mill Lane on its creation in 1964. It occupies Pavilion D of the Centre for Mathematical Sciences. ====Directors of the Statistical Laboratory==== *1953\u20131956 John Wishart *1956\u20131957 Henry Daniels, Acting Director *1957\u20131960 Dennis Lindley *1960\u20131962 Morris Walker, Acting Director *1962\u20131973 David Kendall *1973\u20131987 Peter Whittle *1987\u20131991 David Williams *1991\u20131993 Frank Kelly *1994\u20132000 Geoffrey Grimmett *2000\u20132009 Richard Weber *2009\u20132017 James Norris *2017\u2013 Richard Samworth ==Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics== Department of Applied Mathematics & Theoretical Physics is based at Centre for Mathematical Sciences. The Department of Applied Mathematics and Theoretical Physics (DAMTP) was founded by George Batchelor in 1959, and for many years was situated on Silver Street, in the former office buildings of Cambridge University Press. Currently, the Department is located at the Centre for Mathematical Sciences (Cambridge). Theoretical Physics (including cosmology, relativity, and high energy physics) occupies most of Pavilion B, while Applied Mathematics (including fluid dynamics and solid mechanics) occupies most of Pavilions F, G, and H. ===Heads of department=== *1959\u20131983 George Batchelor *1983\u20131991 Keith Moffatt *1991\u20132000 David Crighton *2000\u20132005 Timothy J.
