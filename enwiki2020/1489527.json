    "text": "The Vympel R-37M (NATO reporting name: AA-X-13/AA-13 Axehead) is a Russian hypersonic air-to-air missile with very long range. The missile and its variants also had the names K-37, izdeliye 610 and R-VD (\u0420\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u0412\u044b\u0441\u043e\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0414\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438 (Raketa-Vysokoy Dalnosty), \"Very Long Range Missile\"), and the NATO codenames 'Axehead' and 'Andi'. It was developed from the R-33. It was designed to shoot down tankers, AWACS and other C4ISTAR aircraft whilst keeping the launch platform out of range of any fighters that might be protecting the target. ==History== The missile was designed in the early 1980s and first flown in 1989. Testing of the R-37 continued through the 1990s, and in 1994, a trial round scored a kill at a range of . However, the program appears to have been dropped around 1998 on grounds of cost. Work on the missile appears to have restarted in late 2006, as part of the MiG-31BM program to update the Foxhound with a new radar and ground attack capability. In 2018, the R-37M had finished its operational validation tests.https://www.vpk-news.ru/articles/52503 ===Production=== The R-37 is now in production to equip upgraded Russian MiG-31BM interceptors. Despite the early intent to integrate the weapon on the Flanker family, this has yet to be reported. ==Design== The R-37 was developed from the R-33. For compatibility with aircraft that did not have the MiG-31's sophisticated radar, the semi- active seeker was replaced with a variant of the Agat 9B-1388 active seeker; mid-body strakes enhance lift and hence range, and folding tail controls allow semi-conformal carriage on planes that are not as big as the MiG-31. According to Defence Today, the range depends on the flight profile, from for a direct shot to for a cruise glide profile. According to Jane's there are two variants, the R-37 and the R-37M; the latter has a jettisonable rocket booster that increases the range to \"300-400km\" (160-220 nm). The R-37M designation has since been used for a modernized variant of the missile, also known as RVV-BD (Raketa Vozduh-Vozduh Bolyshoy Dalnosty, English for Long-Range Air-to- Air Missile). R-37M is hypersonic and has range exceeding 300km. It will be carried by the modernized MiG-31BM interceptors and Su-35S and Su-57 multirole fighters. It is not known if the long range air-to-air missile for the Su-57, designated as Izdeliye 810, is a derivative of the R-37M. The missile can attack targets ranging in altitude between 15\u201325,000 meters. Missiles can be guided semi-actively or actively through Agat 9B-1388 system. ==Similar weapons== * AIM-54 Phoenix * AIM-152 AAAM * KS-172 * PL-21 * Long-Range Engagement Weapon * Meteor (missile) ==References== ==External links== * R-37 at airwar.ru Category:Air-to-air missiles of Russia Category:Air-to-air missiles of the Soviet Union Category:Cold War air-to-air missiles of the Soviet Union Category:Vympel NPO products ",
