    "text": "Rzeczpospolita () is a nationwide daily economic and legal newspaper in Poland. It is issued by Gremi Media SA. The paper's title may be loosely translated as \"commonwealth\" or \"republic\", a part of the traditional full name of the Polish state \u2013 Rzeczpospolita Polska. In 2016, Rzeczpospolita had a circulation of 274,000; 75% of its readers were reported to have higher education. == History == A daily newspaper with this title was issued for the first time in 1920 as a medium of the conservative Christian National Party. It was Initially owned by its founder Ignacy Jan Paderewski and after 1924 by Wojciech Korfanty, two prominent politicians of that time. The editor-in-chief Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski sought to maintain quality of the content by cooperating with a group of authors, including Adolf Nowaczy\u0144ski, Kornel Makuszy\u0144ski, and W\u0142adys\u0142aw Witwicki. The last issue of Rzeczpospolita in the Second Polish Republic appeared on the last day of 1931. During the war (1940\u20131943), an irregular paper associated with one of the Polish resistance groups \u2013 Polish People's Independence Action \u2013 was issued under the same title. In 1944 an administration dependent on the Soviet Union started activities behind the lines of the Red Army, within the territory of Poland. Initially the activity was directed only against former Nazi German forces, in order to gain the favour of Polish society. On 23 July 1944, when the war had not been over yet, the first issue of Rzeczpospolita \u2013 the newspaper of the Polish Committee of National Liberation \u2013 was published in Che\u0142m. The editor-in-chief was Jerzy Borejsza, a communist activist and journalist in the interwar years, who after the outbreak of war collaborated with the Russians before they entered Polish territory. His articles in Rzeczpospolita presented the opinions in line with the position of the Kremlin. The newspaper began strenuous endeavours as to form a positive image of the new government. The Home Army commanders and their decision to commence the Warsaw Uprising were criticised, while nationalisation and land reform were supported. After the war, Rzeczpospolita was issued by \"Czytelnik\" cooperative publishing house, whose president was Borejsza himself. He delegated the editorial duties to Pawe\u0142 Hoffman, who soon changed the title to Rzeczpospolita. Dziennik Gospodarczy, later changing it again to Rzeczpospolita. Dziennik Polityczno-Gospodarczy. In 1949, the editor- in-chief was Henryk Koroty\u0144ski, and newspaper joined the campaign against the Roman Catholic Church. In 1949, the state authorities had established another newspaper \u2013 People's Tribune () as an organ of a newly formed political party, the Polish United Workers' Party (colloquially: party). Rzeczpospolita had been issued still by nearly two years, until the beginning of 1951, when it was discontinued because coexistence of the party and government newspapers was considered at that time unfavorable for a consolidated one-party state. Part of the team joined G\u0142os Pracy, while several journalists, including Koroty\u0144ski, moved to \u017bycie Warszawy. In 1980 the state had faced a crisis, and consequently the party's overall image deteriorated significantly. This prompted the idea to relaunch a separate government newspaper. In the spring of 1981, thus during the rise of Solidarity, Edmund Osma\u0144czyk, member of parliament of the Polish People\u2019s Republic, proposed to revive Rzeczpospolita as a \"governmental medium presenting the position of the state on a daily basis\u201d. J\u00f3zef Barecki, former editor of Trybuna Ludu, a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and of the parliament, as well as a government spokesman for a year, was appointed as the editor-in-chief. The first issue of the new Rzeczpospolita appeared during the martial law, on 14 January 1982. The state, as an entity, had become officially independent from the party (even though this independence was still largely fictitious within a communist state). Thus, from 1982 onwards, Rzeczpospolita and Trybuna Ludu resumed their parallel existence as the official bulletins of the government and the party apparatus respectively. This dualism corresponded to the situation in the Soviet Union, where the government newspaper Izvestia functioned alongside the party's Pravda, and where Izvestia has steered a course strikingly similar to Rzeczpospolita in the 1990s. After the partially free elections of 4 June 1989 and after Tadeusz Mazowiecki became Prime Minister, the management of the newspaper changed as well. Rzeczpospolita was no longer a government medium and became an independent newspaper. Its new editor-in-chief was Dariusz Fikus (until 1996). The new Polish government made Rzeczpospolita legitimately independent. In February 1991, Pa\u0144stwowe Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Wydawnicze \"Rzeczpospolita\", a state publishing company, with Maciej Ceg\u0142owski as the new CEO, together with the French Robert Hersant press group, Presse Participations Europennes, established Presspublica company. Its first CEO was the then editor-in-chief of Rzeczpospolita, Dariusz Fikus. Initially, the Polish shareholder held 51% of company shares, while the French owned 49%. In 1993, Rzeczpospolita was named the Newspaper of the Year by the Pheidippides Committee. In the mid-1990s, the Polish party sold the additional 2% of shares to the French. In 1996, the Norwegian Orkla Media corporation acquired shares held by the Robert Hersant group. During the next 10 years, 51% of shares were held by the subsidiary of Orkla Press Polska, Presspublica Holding Norway, while 49% belonged to Pa\u0144stwowe Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Wydawnicze \"Rzeczpospolita\" (from 1 March 2000, to Przedsi\u0119biorstwo Wydawnicze \u201cRzeczpospolita\u201d SA). In October 2006, the shares of Orkla Press Polska were taken over by Mecom Poland Holdings SA forming part of the British Mecom Group. In October 2011 Gremi Media, owned by the Polish entrepreneur Grzegorz Hajdarowicz, purchased the shares from Mecom Poland and the shares belonging to PW Rzeczpospolita (the State Treasury), becoming a 100% shareholder of Presspublica publishing house. The publishing house changed its name to Gremi Media, after which, in January 2017, it was transformed into a joint stock company operating under the business name of Gremi Media SA. == Contents == Rzeczpospolita newspaper cover from 1945 The basic edition of Rzeczpospolita is divided into four sections: the main one, dedicated to general news; the economic one (Ekonomia i rynek), the legal one (Prawo co dnia); and the regional one (\u017bycie Region\u00f3w).
