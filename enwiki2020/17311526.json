No Southern League clubs applied to join the Football League. ==Division One== There were no new clubs in Division One this season. ==Division Two== There were also no new clubs in Division Two this season. ==Promotion-relegation test matches== At the end of the season, test matches were held between the bottom two clubs in Division One and the top two clubs in Division Two. Brentford beat Fulham 7-2 to retain their place in Division One, although Fulham were promoted anyway after Division One was expanded to 18 clubs. Brighton beat Watford 5-3 in the other match, which saw the two clubs swap divisions. ==References== == External links == *Southern League First Division Tables at RSSSF *Southern League Second Division Tables at RSSSF 1902-03 Category:1902\u201303 in English association football leagues ",
