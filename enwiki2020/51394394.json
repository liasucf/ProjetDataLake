In his overview of eastern North Pacific marine mammal assemblages, Lawrence Barnes noted that these two genera did not belong in those families and reassigned Allodelphis to Platanistidae, while removing Squalodon errabundus from Squalodon. Barnes later realized that Allodelphis was more primitive than extinct members of Platanistidae and Squalodelphinidae and placed it and \"S.\" errabundus in a separate family, Allodelphinidae. ==References== Category:Prehistoric toothed whales Category:Oligocene cetaceans Category:Miocene cetaceans Category:Rupelian first appearances Category:Langhian extinctions ",
