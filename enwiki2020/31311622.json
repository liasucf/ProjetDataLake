Red-dyed eggs distributed during birthdays and baby celebrations by the Chinese community in Singapore In Chinese culture, it is common to hold a red egg and ginger party at the baby's first-year birthday. Usually, the baby's name is announced to friends and family at this party. One might find a bowl of brightly colored cooked chicken eggs on the guests' buffet or serving tables, or the hosts might hand out the red-dyed eggs, symbolizing joy and renewed life. Nowadays, some people also will give red eggs to their friends and families to celebrate their birthday. ==Origin and folklore== Similar to Western easter eggs, in Chinese culture eggs symbolize birth or a new start; thus, it is of paramount importance for eggs to be served to guests during an important birthday (such as the first month or first year). The color red symbolizes prosperity and good fortune to the Chinese, while white or beige are considered the colors of death. == See also == * Smoked egg * Tea egg == References == Category:Chinese cuisine Category:Eggs (food) ",
