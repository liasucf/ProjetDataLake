    "text": "Jackie Hill-Perry (n\u00e9e Jackie Hill, born June 21, 1989) is an American poet, writer, and hip hop artist from St. Louis. Hill-Perry initially garnered popularity for her performances of spoken word pieces such as \"My Life as a Stud\", \"A Poem About Weed\", and \"Jig-a-Boo\" at the Passion 4 Christ Movement (P4CM). She has written for various Christian ministry organizations, such as The Resurgence and John Piper's Desiring God, on the topic of Christianity and homosexuality. She signed to the Portland, Oregon-based Christian hip hop label Humble Beast in January 2014, and released her debut album on November 4, 2014. Hill Perry believes that her identity is found not in her sexual desires, but in the Most High God whom she serves. ==Biography== === Early life (birth to 2008) === Jackie Hill-Perry was born Jackie Hill on June 21, 1989 in St. Louis. She grew up in a fatherless household, and experienced sexual abuse at the age of five. Hill attended church until she was ten. However, her encounter with sexual abuse, combined with school bullying and a lack of attention from boys contributed to her struggle with gender dysphoria. Since the age of four, Hill felt as though she should have been born a boy, and at age six she started imitating male tendencies. At age 17, she started pursuing multiple serial sexual relationships with women. Hill's second girlfriend suggested that she be a stud, a woman who takes a masculine role in a lesbian relationship (not all lesbian relationships have masculine and feminine roles). Hill explains that > I was never the 'cute chick' but when I became a stud, it seemed like every > girl wanted me. I would be in straight clubs and have girls throwing > themselves at me. For a girl that's insecure and craves to feel loved, that > was like a drug for me. Hill used drugs and indicates she suffered from pornography addiction. In October 2008, she converted to evangelical Christianity. === Conversion and current activities (2008\u2013present) === As recounted in her poem \"My Life as a Stud\", Hill states that \"one day, the Lord spoke to me. He said, 'She will be the death of you.' In that moment, the scripture for the wages of sin equal death finally clicked.\" Hill left her girlfriend, returned to church, and started writing poetry. She performed her first spoken word piece at a P4CM poetry conference in 2010, and met Preston Perry, the man who would eventually become her husband. Over time, Hill gradually lost interest in women, and Preston proposed to her in August 2013 through the spoken word poem \"The Covenant\". The couple married in March 2014, and now has two daughters. Hill- Perry attributes that change in her sexuality to God's transformation of her life. Record label Humble Beast announced on January 7, 2014 that it had signed Hill-Perry as an artist. She has appeared as a guest musician on several Christian hip hop recordings, including Because You Asked by Swoope and Instruments of Mercy by Beautiful Eulogy. Her debut album, The Art of Joy, was produced by Beautiful Eulogy and released on November 4, 2014 Hill-Perry is also a staff member of the Legacy Movement ministry. In 2016, she, alongside JGivens and John Givez, was featured on Lecrae's \"Misconceptions 3\" from the album Church Clothes 3. Jackie Hill Perry is also a part of a worldwide tour called, \"Poets in Autumn.\" This tour was started in 2015 and consists of Christian spoken word artists, Ezekiel Azonwu, Chris Webb, Joseph Solomon, Janette...IKZ, Preston Perry, and of course Jackie. They create collaborative, as well as individual pieces that address topics in the Christian faith. In 2019, Jackie Hill-Perry and her husband Preston Perry started their own podcast called, \"Thirty Minutes with the Perry's.\" They offer insight on topics concerning race, relationships, parenting, theology, and politics. ==Stance on sexual fluidity == Jackie Hill-Perry maintains a nuanced position on sexual fluidity, stating that God changed her sexual orientation although He may or may not choose to change that of others. While she now says that prayer may not change sexual orientation, she maintains that she is an ex-lesbian and that her transition to heterosexuality is among the changes that God worked in her life. On July 31, 2013, Christian hip hop radio show Wade-O Radio published an interview with Hill-Perry where she spoke out against the Macklemore song \"Same Love\". Citing 1 Corinthians 6:9-11, she stated that > The word of God itself, apart from Jackie Hill, testifies that people can > change. So if the word of God is the word of God, then we need to deal with > that and believe that it's true. I think we've made God very little if we > believe that he cannot change people. If he can make a moon, stars and a > galaxy that we have yet to fully comprehend, how can he not simply change my > desires? She further clarified that she does not believe that every gay Christian will lose gay desires, stating: > If God chooses not to change my desires, he has promised to give me his Holy > Spirit that will help me flee from them. There are people who were > alcoholics for 20 years, went through rehab and they don't drink anymore, > but sometimes they may be tested. If they see a bottle of whiskey, they're > going to want that whisky, but they have a choice. == Influences == In an interview with The Gospel Coalition, Hill-Perry cited Mali Music, Propaganda, and Ebony Moore as \"a few people who inspire me to be great at my craft.\" Theologically, she names pastor John Piper as a major influence, and even based Art of Joy on Piper's book Desiring God, where Piper explains his concept of Christian hedonism. Hill-Perry states that > Aside from the doctrines of grace, it's one concept that has really renewed > my mind when it comes to faith and sin. Now, when I look at certain sins, > it's not, 'Oh, I'm just doing this because I want to.' No, what in this sin > do you think will satisfy me that God can't? It makes my processing of my > issues a lot deeper, and it's also expanded my view of God. ==Writing== Jackie Hill-Perry has written for various Christian ministry organizations, focusing on reconciling issues of homosexuality with Christianity. Among these are her articles \"Love Letter to a Lesbian\", written for Desiring God, a ministry of John Piper, and \"A Christian Response to the Same-Sex Marriage Ruling\", for The Resurgence, a ministry of the now-defunct Mars Hill Church. Hill-Perry also released her own book, Gay Girl Good God, which was published September 3, 2018. She is also author of a Bible study for women and teen girls \"Jude: Contending for the Faith in Today's Culture.\" == Discography == === Studio albums === * The Art of Joy (2014) * Crescendo (2018) ==References== ===Citations=== ===Additional references=== *A brief TGC report on \"Jig-a-Boo\" *NPR report on formerly gay Christians *Rapzilla interview ===See also=== Spoken word Conversion therapy ==External links== * Jackie Hill-Perry's website Category:1989 births Category:Living people Category:African-American activists Category:African-American Christians Category:American female rappers Category:African-American female rappers Category:African-American poets Category:American evangelicals Category:American women activists Category:People self-identified as ex-gay Category:American Calvinist and Reformed Christians Category:Hip hop activists Category:American performers of Christian hip hop music Category:Poets from Missouri Category:Rappers from St. Louis Category:Calvinist and Reformed writers Category:African-American women writers Category:American women poets Category:21st-century American women writers Category:21st-century American poets Category:21st-century American rappers Category:21st-century American women musicians ",
