    "text": "The current British Weights and Measures Association, or BWMA, is an advocacy group established in the United Kingdom in 1995, founded by Vivian Linacre. The current body was established in 1995, but there had also been a predecessor organisation, also called the BWMA, that was established in 1904, and lapsed after the First World War. ==Aim of the BWMA== The BWMA's stated aim is to uphold the freedom to use the Imperial system and to oppose the compulsory imposition of the metric system in the UK. The BWMA's campaign parallels the evolution of the eurosceptic viewpoint of the UK's relationship with the EUBWMA \"Ministers' Metrication Conspiracy\" \\- its founder, Vivian Linacre, stood for election as a UK Independence Party candidate in 1995, the same year as he founded the BWMA - famously asking the controversial eurosceptic Enoch Powell for endorsement of his political campaign.The Telegraph: \"Nigel Farage and Enoch Powell\" By the time of the modern BWMA's founding, metrication in the United Kingdom was far advanced, having begun in 1962. British schoolchildren had been educated using only metric measures since 1974 (earlier in some places), and British industry had changed to using metric tools and equipment during the 1980s and were, in most cases, manufacturing to metric standards. ===Campaigns=== * BWMA maintain that people should be free to use the metric system if they want, but that it should not be forced upon them. and specifically, the Association campaigns for freedom for traders to serve their customers in whichever measures both parties find most convenient. * BWMA campaigns against the metrication of road signsBWMA/Transport \u2013 De-metricated signs and in 2009 published their responseYardstick: Dec 2009 to a consultation hosted by the UK's Department for Transport which discussed a proposal to require compulsory dual Metric/Imperial signs of height limits and width limits. BWMA's responded that dual-units signage should not be made compulsory, and that the legal provisions (from the 1980s) allowing voluntary dual-units signage should be repealed so that only Imperial units could be displayed. This, the BWMA claimed, was to \"avoid confusion.\" * BWMA support the Metric Martyrs \u2013 a group of traders prosecuted for their defiance of the Weights and Measures ActResults within Legislation \u2013 Statute Law Database and the Price Marking Order.Results within Legislation \u2013 Statute Law Database * BWMA gives detailed advice on how traders can circumvent regulations mandating metric weights and measures.BWMA/Business Issues \u2013 Survival Guide to Metric Law * BWMA members have published a number of books arguing for customary measures. These include The General Rule by BWMA President Vivian Linacre (Squeeze Press) and About the Size of It by Warwick Cairns. *The BWMA has published a \"rogues' gallery\" of those they label \"Metric Culprits.\" These include a long list of individuals and bodies that have advocated or supported metrication, including the Irish Minister for Transport, Martin Cullen, who metricated road signs in Republic of Ireland in 2005.BWMA/Metric Culprits ===Opposition=== *These actions contrast with the UK Metric Association (UKMA), which campaigns for compulsory Metrication in the United Kingdom for all legal and official purposes, including trade and road signs. ==Patrons and honorary members== ===Patrons=== * Gwyneth Dunwoody (1930\u20132008) * Vice-Admiral Sir Louis Le Bailly (1915\u20132010) * Sir Patrick Moore (1923\u20132012) * John Monson, 11th Baron Monson (1932\u20132011) ===Honorary members=== {| |valign=\"top\"| * Peter Alliss (b. 1931) * Clive Anderson (b. 1952) * Trevor Bailey (1923\u20132011) * Michael Barry * Christopher Booker (1937-2019) * Ian Botham (b. 1955) * Max Bygraves (b. 1922) * Beryl Cook (1926\u20132008 ) * Jilly Cooper (b. 1937) * Richard Demarco (b. 1930) * Roy Faiers * Ranulph Fiennes (b. 1944) * Edward Fox (b. 1937) * Dick Francis (1920\u20132010) * George MacDonald Fraser (1925\u20132008) * Sandy Gall (b. 1927) * Simon Heffer (b. 1960) * Peter Hitchens (b. 1951) |valign=\"top\"| * Jools Holland (b. 1958) * Richard Holmes (1946\u20132011) * Richard Ingrams (b. 1937) * James Le Fanu (b. 1950)jameslefanu.com * Candida Lycett Green (b. 1942) * Jonathan Lynn (b. 1943) * Richard Mabey (b. 1941) * Christopher Martin-Jenkins (1945\u20132013) * Robin Page (b. 1943) * Andrew Phillips, Baron Phillips of Sudbury (b. 1939) * William Poole * Tim Rice (b. 1944) * Andrew Roberts (b. 1963) * J.K.
