    "text": "\u00c7engelk\u00f6y is a neighborhood in the \u00dcsk\u00fcdar district on the Asian shore of the Bosphorus strait in Istanbul, Turkey, between the neighborhoods of Beylerbeyi and Kuleli. It is mainly a residential district. Many mansions were built there in the Ottoman period. From the 6th century, the port of \u00c7engelk\u00f6y was called Sophianai because of the palace Justin II built nearby for his consort Sophia.Eyice (1976), pages 55-56. The name \u00c7engelk\u00f6y means \"hook village\" and indeed the village is nestled around a sharp turn of the Bosphorus shoreline, but the origin of the name is uncertain. One story put forward is that the village is named after the 19th-century Ottoman admiral \u00c7engelo\u011flu Tahir Pasha, who had a waterside mansion built there (and there is a \u00c7engelo\u011flu Street in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y). Another story derives the name from the Persian word \u00e7enkar, \"crab,\" because of the abundance of seafood in the Bosphorus there.H\u00fcrel (2008), page 107. A 16th-century Ottoman document apparently refers to the place as \"\u00c7enger k\u00f6y\u00fc.\"Eyice (1976), page 56. \u00c7engelk\u00f6y is world-famous for the small cucumbers once grown there (now grown in Kand\u0131ra). Opened in 2015, the Mehmet \u00c7ak\u0131r Cultural and Sports Center, consisting of six indoor swimming pools, is the biggest sports complex on the Anatolian part of Istanbul. The Vahdettin Pavilion, also known as the \u00c7engelk\u00f6y Pavilion, an official residence of the Presidency and a state guest house, is situated on a hill in \u00c7engelk\u00f6y. ==Education== The \u00c7engelk\u00f6y Campus of Tarabya British Schools is located in this neighbourhood. ==Notes== ==References== * ; Printed sources * * * Category:Neighbourhoods of \u00dcsk\u00fcdar Category:Bosphorus ",
