    "text": "R Trianguli Australis is a yellow-white hued variable star in the southern constellation Triangulum Australe. It is near the limit of visibility to the naked eye, having a typical apparent visual magnitude of 6.73. Based upon an annual parallax shift of , it is located 2,210 light years away. R TrA is moving closer with a heliocentric radial velocity of \u221213 km/s. This is a Classical Cepheid variable with an apparent magnitude that ranges from 6.33 to 6.90 over 3.38926 days. It is a bright giant/supergiant with a nominal stellar classification of F7 Ib/II, but pulsates between spectral types F5Ib/II-G5. Depending on the method employed, the estimated mass is 5.42 or 5.66 times the mass of the Sun and it has 24.7 or 35.8 times the Sun's radius. R TrA has an infrared excess that is being emitted by circumstellar silicate dust heated to 150\u2013200 K. It is losing mass at the rate of . ==References== Category:F-type bright giants Category:Classical Cepheid variables Category:Triangulum Australe Category:Durchmusterung objects 135592 075018 Trianguli Australis, R ",
