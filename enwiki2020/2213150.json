    "text": "Arthur David \"Art\" or \"Tappy\" Larsen (April 17, 1925 \u2013 December 7, 2012) was an American No. 1 male tennis player best remembered for his victory at the U.S. Championships in 1950 and for his eccentricities. He won the \"Times\" national sports award for the outstanding tennis player of 1950. Larsen was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1969. ==Biography== Jack Kramer, tennis player and long-time promoter, stated in his 1979 autobiography that \"Larsen was fascinating to watch. He had concentrated on tennis as mental therapy after serving long stretches in the front lines during (World War II). He was called Tappy because he went around touching everything for good luck,\"Strange Habits of Highly Successful Tennis Players\" by Christopher Clarey, June 21, 2008 in The New York Times. and sometimes he would chat with an imaginary bird that sat on his shoulder. This was good theatre, but it could never have made Larsen a candidate for a professional tour.\"The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis (1979), Jack Kramer with Frank Deford, page 92 John Olliff of The Daily Telegraph ranked Larsen as World No. 3 in 1950. A member of the Olympic Club in San Francisco, he had previously attended the University of San Francisco, where he was a member of the 1949 NCAA Men's Tennis Championship team. He was 5 feet 10 inches and 150 pounds and was also known for his partying before, and during, his tournament appearances. It was frequently written that Larsen would arrive for an important match directly from an all-night party with no benefit of sleep.Watkins, Les (2010). \"What a load of racquets\", Fairfax NZ News, April 20, 2010. He was the first man to win the American amateur championships on the four court surfaces that existed at the time, grass, clay, hardcourt, and indoor. Since then, only Tony Trabert has equalled his feat. Larsen's tennis career ended abruptly in November 1956, after a motor scooter accident in Castro Valley, California. He was partially paralyzed and lost sight in one eye. He was the Number 8 ranked American amateur at the time. Larsen died on December 7, 2012 at the age of 87. ==Grand Slam finals== ===Singles (1 title, 1 runner-up)=== {| class='sortable wikitable' !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:35px\"|Year !style=\"width:200px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:150px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:170px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ccf;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win ||1950||U.S. National Championships||Grass|| Herbie Flam|| 6\u20133, 4\u20136, 5\u20137, 6\u20134, 6\u20133 |-style=\"background:#ebc2af;\" | style=\"background:#ffa07a;\"|Loss ||1954||French Championships||Clay|| Tony Trabert|| 4\u20136, 5\u20137, 1\u20136 |} ==Grand Slam tournament performance timeline== ===Singles=== {|class=wikitable style=text-align:center !Tournament !!1948 !!1949 !!1950 !!1951 !!1952 !!1953 !!1954 !!1955 !!1956!! |- | colspan=11 style=\"text-align:left;\"|Grand Slam tournaments |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef|Australian Championships | A | A | A | bgcolor=yellow|SF | A | A | A | A | A | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 1 |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef|French Championships | A | A | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | A | A | A | bgcolor=thistle|F | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 4 |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef|Wimbledon | A | A | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | bgcolor=afeeee|1R | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=#efefef| 0 / 7 |- | align=left bgcolor=#efefef|U.S. National Championships | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | bgcolor=lime|W | bgcolor=yellow|SF | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=ffebcd|QF | bgcolor=afeeee|4R | bgcolor=afeeee|3R | bgcolor=#efefef| 1 / 9 |- style=\"font-weight:bold; background:#efefef;\" | style=text-align:left|Strike Rate | 0 / 1 | 0 / 1 | 1 / 3 | 0 / 3 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 2 | 0 / 3 | 0 / 3 | 0 / 3 | |} ==References== ==Sources== * The Game, My 40 Years in Tennis (1979), Jack Kramer with Frank Deford () == External links == * * * * Category:1925 births Category:2012 deaths Category:American male tennis players Category:Sportspeople from Hayward, California Category:San Francisco Dons men's tennis players Category:International Tennis Hall of Fame inductees Category:Tennis people from California Category:Tennis players at the 1955 Pan American Games Category:United States National champions (tennis) Category:Grand Slam (tennis) champions in men's singles Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for the United States Category:Pan American Games medalists in tennis ",
