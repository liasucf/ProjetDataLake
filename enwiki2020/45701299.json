    "text": "Ovation Technologies was a software company founded in Canton, Massachusetts, in 1983 to create business productivity software for the then-emerging IBM PC and compatible market. Their intended product, also named \"Ovation\", was an integrated software suite aiming to compete against the industry leader at the time, Lotus 1-2-3. The company raised several million in capital and secured a distribution agreement with Tandy Corporation, including co-marketing with their line of Tandy 2000 computers. However, despite building impressive demonstrations, culminating with a high-profile news conference staged at Manhattan's Windows on the World restaurant, the company ultimately was unable to ship their product, and filed for bankruptcy by the end of 1984. Ovation's most enduring claim to fame may be as what is considered by many to be the industry's \"most notorious\" example of vaporware. Possibly as a knowing reference - \"Ovation\" was used as the name of a desktop publishing package for the Acorn Archimedes several years later. ==References== Category:Software companies established in 1983 Category:Software companies disestablished in 1984 Category:1983 establishments in Massachusetts Category:1984 disestablishments in Massachusetts Category:Office suites ",
