    "text": "\"Kiss Me a Lot\" is a song by English singer Morrissey. It is the eighth track on his World Peace Is None of Your Business album and was released as the fifth single off the album via digital download on 26 March 2015, through Atom Factory. Of the release, Morrissey stated: \"I humbly ask for all and any support with this download release, which, has always been waiting in the wings if not for unpleasant circumstances familiar enough not to be repeated here. Thank you to Atom Factory for making this happen, and here's to sound reason, good times, and music that matters.\" Furthermore, artwork for the download has been enhanced by Rob English at Atom Factory using a previously unseen photograph taken by Terry Richardson. On 5 April 2015, the official video for the song was announced on True-To-You, directed by Morrissey's nephew, Sam Esty Rayner. (Rayner had previously appeared as a young James Dean in his uncle's video for the song \"Suedehead\".) ==Track listing== Digital download # \"Kiss Me a Lot\" - 4:03 ==Personnel== * Morrissey \u2013 vocals Additional musicians * Boz Boorer \u2013 guitar * Jesse Tobias \u2013 guitar * Solomon Walker \u2013 bass * Matthew Walker \u2013 drums * Gustavo Manzur \u2013 keyboards Production * Joe Chiccarelli \u2013 production ==References== Category:2014 songs Category:2015 singles Category:Morrissey songs Category:Songs written by Jesse Tobias Category:Songs written by Morrissey ",
