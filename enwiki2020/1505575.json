    "text": "Quoddy Head State Park is a state park located four miles off Maine State Route 189 in Lubec, Maine on the easternmost point of land in the continental United States. On its , purchased by the state in 1962, the park features of hiking trails, extensive forests, two bogs, diverse habitat for rare plants, and the striking, red-and-white striped lighthouse tower of West Quoddy Head Light. In 1808, West Quoddy Head Light became the easternmost lighthouse in the United States. Its light and fog cannon warned mariners of Quoddy's dangerous cliffs, ledges, and Sail Rock. Among the first to use a fog bell and later a steam-powered foghorn, this lighthouse greatly reduced shipwrecks in this foggy area, even as shipping increased. In 1858, the present red-and- white tower replaced the original. Monitored and serviced by the United States Coast Guard, its light still shines through its original third-order Fresnel lens. After automation in 1988, the light station became part of adjacent Quoddy Head State Park. The tower is closed, but visitors are welcome to enjoy the lighthouse grounds and explore the visitor center and museum run by the West Quoddy Head Light Keepers Association. For a few weeks around the equinoxes, West Quoddy Head is the first location in the United States to see the sunrise. Analysis by Blanton C. Wiggin, published in the January 1972 issue of Yankee Magazine. Quoddy Head State Park is also the closest geographic point in the United States to the African continent. ==Gallery== File:Line2848 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg File:Line2823 - Flickr - NOAA Photo Library.jpg File:West Quoddy Head Light - closeup.jpg File:Quoddy Head State Park - panoramio (1).jpg ==References== ==External links== *Quoddy Head State Park Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry *Quoddy Head State Park Guide & Map Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry Category:State parks of Maine Category:Protected areas of Washington County, Maine Category:Lubec, Maine ",
