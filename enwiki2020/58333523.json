At this time, the leader of the Thervingi, Athanaric was threatening northern Greece. Having repulsed the invaders at Daphne, Emperor Valens secured a decisive victory against Athanaric at Noviodunum. In September 369, Athanaric accepted an advantageous treaty with Valens, but peace between the Goths and the Romans would turn short-lived. ==Sources== * Category:369 Category:Battles involving the Roman Empire Category:Battles involving the Goths Category:Military history of Romania ",
