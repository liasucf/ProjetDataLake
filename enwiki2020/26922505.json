S. Eliot, and F. R. Leavis tradition, as discussed in his book The English Prophets. Along with works of pure literary criticism on Chaucer, he has published much in a category he calls \u201ccriticism of language\u201d, beginning with The Survival of English, which includes comments on the language of the media, of religion, of politics. He thinks that judgement is always a refinement of a sense held in common, and in 2008 published Holding the Centre, trying to demonstrate that a number of the Arts subjects have become incoherent by losing their place in the common language. Robinson has been politically active as secretary of a constituency association of the UK Independence Party. He differs from his mentor Leavis by holding the view that judgement in literature cannot do without Christianity, and has been a trustee of the Prayer Book Society. ==Books== * Chaucer\u2019s Prosody (1971) * Chaucer and the English Tradition (1972) * The Survival of English: Essays in criticism of language (1973) * With David Sims, The Decline and Fall of Edward Heath (1974) * The New Grammarians\u2019 Funeral (1975) * Prayers for the New Babel (1983) * Richard II and Woodstock (1988)Brynmill Press. * The Establishment of Modern English Prose in the Reformation and the Enlightenment (1998) * The English Prophets: A critical defense of English criticism (2001) * With Duke Maskell, The New Idea of a University (2001) * Chaucer and the English Tradition (second, completely rewritten edition, 2004) * Who Killed the Bible (2006) * Holding the Centre (2008) * United Kingdom (2008) ==References== Category:1944 births Category:Academics of Swansea University Category:Alumni of Downing College, Cambridge Category:Living people Category:British literary critics Category:People educated at King Edward VI Grammar School, Retford ",
