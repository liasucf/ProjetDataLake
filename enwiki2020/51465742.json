He developed a method for loading of containers, in which he tried unsuccessfully to interest his then-bosses at Stena Line. In his own business, Container Safe J C Ericsson AB, later known as Consafe, he developed his own ideas and was initially successful in sea transportation. In 1987, he published a book entitled Utan omsvep: mitt berikande liv med Consafe. In the late 1970s, Consafe started to manufacture houses and service platforms for offshore businesses in co-operation with Svenska Varv. The business expanded, but went into bankruptcy in 1985. Ericsson had already, before the bankruptcy, started to invest in other businesses. He was a major shareholder in the car dealership Philipson Bil and also invested in the oil and gas industry.
