    "text": "Slobodan Praljak (; 2 January 1945 \u2013 29 November 2017) was a Bosnian Croat general who served in the Croatian Army and the Croatian Defence Council, an army of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, between 1992 and 1995. Praljak was found guilty of committing violations of the laws of war, crimes against humanity and breaches of the Geneva Conventions during the Croat\u2013Bosniak War by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in 2017. Praljak voluntarily joined the newly formed Croatian Armed Forces after the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence in 1991. Before and after the war he was an engineer, a television and theatre director, as well as a businessman. Praljak was indicted by, and voluntarily surrendered to, the ICTY in 2004. In 2013, he was convicted for war crimes against the Bosniak population during the Croat\u2013Bosniak War alongside five other Bosnian Croat officials, and was sentenced to 20 years in jail (minus the time he had already spent in detention). Upon hearing the guilty verdict upheld in November 2017, Praljak stated that he rejected the verdict of the court, and committed suicide by poisoning in the courtroom. == Early life and career == Slobodan Praljak was born on 2 January 1945 in \u010capljina, Yugoslavia. His father Mirko worked for the security agency OZNA. Praljak attended high school in \u0160iroki Brijeg with the future Croatian Defense Minister Gojko \u0160u\u0161ak. He had three university degrees. In 1970, he graduated as an electrical engineer at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering in Zagreb with a GPA of 4.5/5. In 1971, he graduated from the Zagreb Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, majoring in philosophy and sociology. In 1972, he graduated from the Zagreb Academy of Dramatic Art. At first, Praljak worked as a professor and manager of the electronics laboratory at the Nikola Tesla Vocational High School in Zagreb, then lectured on philosophy and sociology, and after 1973 was a freelance artist. Praljak was also a theatre director in theatres in Zagreb, Osijek and Mostar. He directed the television series Blesan i Tulipan [Blesan and Tulipan], television dramas Novela od Stanca and Sarga\u0161ko more [Sargasso Sea], documentaries Smrt psa (1980) [Death of a Dog], Sand\u017eak and Duhan [Tobacco] (both in 1990), and film Povratak Katarine Ko\u017eul (1989) [Return of Katarina Ko\u017eul]. == Military activity during the Croatian War of Independence and Croat\u2013Bosniak War == Praljak drew public attention in September 1991 when he voluntarily joined the newly formed Croatian Armed Forces after the outbreak of the Croatian War of Independence. He formed a unit composed of the Zagreb artists and intellectuals with whom he held positions in Sunja. After the Sarajevo Agreement, by 3 April 1992, he was made major general, received a number of responsibilities in the Ministry of Defence, and became one of the 14 members of the Croatian National Defence Council and a member of the Croatian State Commission for Relations with United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR). He was the High Representative of the Ministry of Defence, and since 13 May 1993, representative of the Ministry of Defence in the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and Croatian Defence Council (HVO). Praljak petitioned Alija Izetbegovi\u0107 to unblock Sarajevo but his propositions were rejected. From 24 July to 8 November 1993, Praljak was the Chief of Staff of the Croatian Defence Council. In spite of the Croat-Muslim conflict in the Croat\u2013Bosniak War, he sent a truck full of weapons to besieged Sarajevo to help Bosniaks. He also allowed the UNHCR's humanitarian convoy through to Mostar, which was stopped in \u010citluk. Praljak was accused of failing to prevent the armed forces from committing many crimes of which he was informed and that he could foresee, including removing and placing in detention the Muslim population of Prozor from July through August 1993, murders in Mostar municipality, the destruction of buildings in East Mostar (including the mosques and the Stari Most), attacking and wounding of members of international organisations, the destruction and looting of property in Gornji Vakuf in January 1993, Ra\u0161tani in August 1993, and Stupni Do in October 1993. During 1993, General Praljak was in charge of the Dretelj camp where Bosniak men were brutalized, starved, and some killed. Praljak was accused of ordering the destruction of Mostar's Stari Most in November 1993, an act which ICTY ruled had \"caused disproportionate damage to the Muslim civilian population\". However, ICTY agreed that the bridge was a legitimate military target. During the trial, Praljak denied the accusation because in the same month when the destruction occurred, he came into conflict with the commander of the HVO's so-called Punishment Battalion Mladen Naletili\u0107 Tuta which resulted in his resignation from the positions of HVO's Chief of Staff, one day before the destruction of the bridge. He said that the bridge was demolished by activation of the explosive charge set on the left bank of the Neretva, where the Army of Bosnia and Herzegovina was located. In addition to the responsibility and whether it was a legitimate military target, ICTY also examined whether the earlier siege by JNA and Bosnian Serb forces contributed to the bridge's collapse. Praljak retired from military service at his own request on 1 December 1995. == Postwar career == After the war, Praljak became a businessman. In 1995, Praljak co-founded a company with his brother Zoran called Oktavijan. His company initially produced films, video, and television programs and published Praljak\u2019s books. It later engaged in real estate business by managing a business complex Centar 2000 in Zagreb. Since 2005, the company is owned and managed by his stepson Nikola Babi\u0107 Praljak. In 2011 it had around 22 million kunas of revenue. Praljak was also a co-owner of Liberan, a company that has a share in Ljubu\u0161ki Tobacco Factory, and owned other shares in few other companies. In 2008, the Croatian Ministry of Culture deemed that 18 of his works about the Croatian War of Independence, Bosnian War, and relations between Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina were not books but brochures of worthless literature, and in 2013 the Ministry of Finance made an enforcement charge of 435 thousand kunas. In total, he authored 25 works. Since 2012, The Hague Tribunal's secretariat requested Praljak to recover defence costs of around EUR 2.8-3.3 million, as they estimated that he had assets and shares worth EUR 6.5 million which allowed him to fund the costs of his defence. Praljak and his lawyer refused the estimation statement because he had no property in his name even from the beginning of the trial. == ICTY indictment == Praljak was among six accused by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), in relation to the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia. On 5 April 2004, he voluntarily surrendered and was transferred to the ICTY. In his indictment it was alleged that Praljak as a senior military official commanded, directly and indirectly, the Herceg-Bosna/HVO armed forces which committed mass war crimes against Bosnian Muslim population in 8 municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina during a joint criminal enterprise between 1992 and 1994. In his role as a high- ranking official in the Ministry of Defence, he was closely involved in all aspects of not only the Herceg-Bosna/HVO military planning and operations but the actions of the Herceg-Bosna/HVO civilian police too. On 6 April, he appeared before ICTY and pleaded not guilty. He chose to defend himself without a lawyer. The indictment charged on the basis of their individual and superior criminal responsibility, but subsequently in judgment only on the basis of individual criminal responsibility. Praljak was found guilty on (taken from the UN press release 2004, 2017): The trial began on 26 April 2006. On 29 May 2013 the Trial Chamber judgement sentenced him to 20 years of imprisonment (the sentence took into account the time he had already spent in detention), and on 28 June 2013, Praljak filed an appeal. On 29 November 2017, the ICTY trial was concluded finding him guilty, and although some parts of his conviction were overturned, the judge did not reduce the initial sentence of 20 years. He was charged with crimes against \"humanity, violations of the laws or customs of war, and grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions\", also \"extensive appropriation of property not justified by military necessity\" and \"plunder of public or private property through the third category of joint criminal enterprise liability\", on which given his command responsibility he failed to act and prevent. He was acquitted of some charges related to the destruction of Stari Most. As he had already served more than two-thirds of the sentence in jail (around 13 years and several months), he would probably have been released soon. == Death == On 29 November 2017, during the pronouncement of the appeal judgment against him, Praljak addressed the judges, saying: \"Judges, Slobodan Praljak is not a war criminal. With disdain, I reject your verdict!\" He then drank what he said was poison, leading presiding judge Carmel Agius to suspend the hearings. ICTY medical staff transported Praljak to nearby HMC Hospital, where he died. The Dutch authorities declared the courtroom a crime scene and launched an investigation. His body was cremated in Zagreb in a private ceremony. === Reaction === Former ICTY judges Wolfgang Schomburg and Richard Goldstone commented that \"it is a tragedy that someone in such a situation has taken their own life\". Goldstone added: \"In a way, the victims are deprived of this deed. They did not get full justice.\" Martin Bell described Praljak as a \"theatrical character\" who \"died in a theatrical way\". Andrey Shary for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty noted that \"Praljak's samurai final act might evoke respect or sympathy\", but \"individual perceptions of honor don't always coincide with correctness\". Writing in The Daily Telegraph, journalist Harry de Quetteville opined that the defiant suicide was \"the most dramatic proof possible of a very uncomfortable reality: many in the Balkans refuse to accept that the horrific ethnic cleansing of the 1990s was wrong\". Former US Ambassador for War Crimes Issues Stephen Rapp compared Praljak's suicide by poisoning to that of another war crimes convict, Hermann G\u00f6ring, noting that in both cases the verdict nevertheless \"stands for all history in establishing the facts and in showing that the perpetrators of atrocities will be held to account\". ==== Regional reaction ==== The Croatian government offered condolences to Praljak's family and said the ICTY misrepresented its officials in the 1990s. Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovi\u0107 stated that Praljak's suicide illustrated the \"deep moral injustice towards the six Croats from Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian people\". All the party caucuses of the Croatian Parliament except the SDP and GLAS issued a joint statement declaring that ICTY's verdict did not respect the \"historical truths, facts and evidence\", and that it was \"unjust and unacceptable\", adding that Praljak symbolically warned of all the verdicts' injustice with his suicide. They expressed their condolences to the families of victims of crimes committed during the Bosnian War. Croatian president Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 expressed her condolences to Praljak's family, calling him \"a man who preferred to die rather than live as a convict for crimes he did not commit\". Miroslav Tu\u0111man stated it was a \"consequence of his moral position not to accept the verdict that has nothing to do with justice or reality\". The Bosniak member of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bakir Izetbegovi\u0107, said that Praljak was led to suicide by the joint criminal enterprise, while Croat Chairman Dragan \u010covi\u0107 stated that Praljak had sacrificed his life to prove his innocence. Serbian President Aleksandar Vu\u010di\u0107 said he would not mock Praljak's suicide but has criticized the reaction of Croatian officials, stating that it would have been unacceptable for him to praise a convicted war criminal as a hero or to denounce an ICTY verdict. The Serbian politician Vojislav \u0160e\u0161elj commented that, although he was an enemy, it was a \"heroic move worthy of respect\" and there should have been more such strong blows to the tribunal. Almost a thousand Bosnian Croats gathered in the Mostar and \u010capljina squares to light candles to pay respect to Praljak. On December 11, 2017, a commemoration for Slobodan Praljak was held in Zagreb. The event was attended by two thousand people, including Government ministers Damir Krsti\u010devi\u0107 and Tomo Medved (as private citizens), a number of MPs, mostly from the Croatian Democratic Union party, and some retired army officers that participated in the 1990s war. In the evening, a religious ceremony was also held at a Catholic church. During the same day, members of the Youth Initiative for Human Rights made a commemoration for the victims of Croatian forces urging condemnation of that period policies. President Grabar-Kitarovi\u0107 has been pressured to take away wartime decorations from Praljak and other convicted officials, but she refused to do so stating that they received it for defence against Serbian aggression, adding that \"such practice has not been implemented so far, except in the case of verdicts made by the Croatian courts\". === Investigation === A preliminary autopsy determined that Praljak had poisoned himself with potassium cyanide, which caused his heart to fail. How the poison was obtained and brought into the courtroom is to be the subject of an official investigation. Praljak's lawyer Nika Pinter suggested that he may have committed suicide because he could not accept being convicted as a war criminal and that the act had been long-planned. The cyanide that Praljak took was not listed as a prohibited substance under Dutch law. \u201cWith regards to the investigation concerning assistance in the commission of suicide, the Dutch authorities conducted a thorough investigation of how Praljak could get ahold of the cyanide. Witnesses were interviewed, video materials watched, rooms in which Praljak stayed were checked and numerous materials inspected. However, no information was found concerning the question on how Praljak came into possession of that substance,\u201d the prosecutors\u2019 report said. The report added that video surveillance recordings did not show if Praljak carried the vial of poison with him or if it was handed to him. == Personal life == Praljak married Ka\u0107u\u0161a Babi\u0107, the former wife of his close friend and poet Goran Babi\u0107. The couple had no children, but Praljak was close to his stepchildren, Nata\u0161a and Nikola, the latter adding the last name Praljak to his birth name. ==See also== *Joint criminal enterprise == References == == External links == * Personal website * Bibliography * Prli\u0107 et al.: Case information sheet at ICTY * Profile at filmski-programi.hr * Category:1945 births Category:2017 deaths Category:20th-century criminals Category:Academy of Dramatic Art, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Criminals who committed suicide Category:Croatian Defence Council Category:Croatian army officers Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina Category:Croatian military personnel who committed suicide Category:Croatian people convicted of war crimes Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina convicted of crimes against humanity Category:Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb alumni Category:Filmed suicides Category:People convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia Category:People from \u010capljina Category:People who committed suicide in prison custody Category:Suicides by cyanide poisoning Category:Suicides in the Netherlands Category:Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina convicted of war crimes Category:Croatian war crimes in the Bosnian War ",
