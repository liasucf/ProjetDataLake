It is situated twenty-eight miles (45 km) east of Metz, France and seventeen miles (27 km) southwest of Saarbr\u00fccken, Germany. ==History== The Saint-Avold area has frequently suffered invasions and since the nineteenth century has been controlled alternately by German and French authorities. The original Abbey of Saint Nabor began as an oratory for a sixth-century monastery. Gradually a complex developed after it received the relics of Saint Nabor, and the church was rebuilt in the eighteenth century, in part following Baroque style. It was designated as a basilica. During the French Revolution, the monastery and church suffered extensive damage; the cloisters were destroyed. The ancient parish church was sacrificed in exchange for keeping Saint Nabor. The abbey also suffered bombing damage during World War II, but much of the church has hence been restored. ==Lorraine American Cemetery== Lorraine American Cemetery in Saint-Avold Just north of the town is the site of Europe's largest United States' World War II military cemetery, the Lorraine American Cemetery and Memorial, with the graves of 10,489 American soldiers who died during World War II.
