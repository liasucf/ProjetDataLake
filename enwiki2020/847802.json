    "text": "Touching Evil is a British television drama serial following the exploits of a crack squad on the Organised & Serial Crime Unit, a rapid response police force that serves the entire country. The serial was produced by United Productions for Anglia Television, and screened on the ITV network in 1997. It was created by Paul Abbott. The first season consists of six 50-minute (one- hour with advertisements) episodes written by Abbott with Russell T Davies. The popularity of the serial led to two sequel serials in 1998 and 1999, although not written by Abbott or Davies. The first episode aired on 29 April 1997, and the last on 6 June 1999, after 16 episodes and 3 seasons. The serial stars Robson Green as D.I. Dave Creegan, with Nicola Walker co-starring as his colleague D.I. Susan Taylor.
