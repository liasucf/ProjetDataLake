    "text": "The Holy Family with San Giovanni by Giacinto Calandrucci, 1700 Giacinto Calandrucci (Palermo 20 April 1646 - 22 February 1707, Palermo) was an Italian painter of the Baroque period. Originally from Palermo, he moved to Rome with his fellow Palermitan painter and engraver Pietro del P\u00f2. Like many painters in Rome in his day, then entered the large and prolific studio of Carlo Maratta. He afterwards worked under Giuseppe Passeri. In the 1680s Calandrucci completed decorative frescoes of the Four Seasons in the Palazzo Lante; mythological frescoes in the gallery of the Palazzo Muti Papazzurri; the decoration of the gallery of the Palazzo Strozzi-Besso; and a ceiling fresco, and the Sacrifice of Ceres in the papal Villa Falconieri at Frascati. He also painted idyllic pastoral scenes, among them two pictures at Burghley House, Stamford, England. He also painted in Rome two works for the main altar and the Cimini Chapel in the church of Sant'Antonio dei Portoghesi, a Virgin and Child with St Anne and Saints in frescoes and canvases in San Bonaventura (before 1686), a Holy Family with St Anne and a St Anthony of Padua, both in San Paolo alla Regola (c. 1700), and frescoes in Santa Maria dell'Orto (c. 1700\u201305). In 1705 he returned to Palermo, where he began the decoration of the oratory of San Lorenzo. He also painted for the church of San Salvatore, representing The Virgin with St. Basil and other Saints. He died at Palermo. His brother Domenico and his nephew Giovanni Battista were painters of lesser renown. He left behind an abundance of drawings on topics from both historical and religious subjects to acute daily observations.(image search in Bildindex der Kunst und Architektur). ==References== * Transfiguration at the Cambridge Museum. *Artnet Grove encyclopedia abstract * Category:1646 births Category:1707 deaths Category:People from Palermo Category:17th-century Italian painters Category:Italian male painters Category:18th-century Italian painters Category:Italian Baroque painters Category:Sicilian painters Category:Pupils of Carlo Maratta ",
