    "text": "Sir John Thomas Duckworth, 1st Baronet, GCB (9 February 174831 August 1817) was an officer of the Royal Navy, serving during the Seven Years' War, the American War of Independence, the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic wars, as the Governor of Newfoundland during the War of 1812, and a member of the British House of Commons during his semi-retirement. Duckworth, a vicar's son, achieved much in a naval career that began at the age of 11. Serving with most of the great names of the Royal Navy during the later 18th and early 19th centuries, he fought almost all of Britain's enemies on the seas at one time or another, including a Dardanelles operation that would be remembered a century later during the First World War. He was in command at the Battle of San Domingo, the last great fleet action of the Napoleonic Wars.Allen, vii. ==Early life== Born in Leatherhead, Surrey, England, Duckworth was one of five sons of Sarah Johnson and the vicar Henry Duckworth A.M. of Stoke Poges, County of Buckinghamshire.p.173, Debrett The Duckworths were descended from a landed family, with Henry later being installed as Canon of Windsor. John Duckworth went to Eton College, but began his naval career in 1759 at the suggestion of Edward Boscawen, when he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman on .Whiteley Namur later became part of the fleet under Sir Edward Hawke, and Duckworth was present at the Battle of Quiberon Bay on 20 November 1759. On 5 April 1764 he joined the 50-gun at Chatham, after leaving , to serve with Admiral Hugh Palliser, then Governor of Newfoundland. He served aboard HMS Princess Royal, on which he suffered a concussion when he was hit by the head of another sailor, decapitated by a cannonball.p.209, Clarke He spent some months as an acting lieutenant, and was confirmed in the rank on 14 November 1771. He then spent three years aboard the 74-gun , the Plymouth guardship, under Captain Charles Fielding. Fielding was given command of the frigate in early 1776, and he took Duckworth with him as his first lieutenant. Duckworth married Anne Wallis in July 1776, with whom he had a son and a daughter. After some time in North America, where Duckworth became involved in a court-martial after an accident at Rhode Island on 18 January 1777 left several men dead, the Diamond was sent to join Vice-Admiral John Byron's fleet in the West Indies. Byron transferred him to his own ship, , in March 1779, and Duckworth was present aboard her at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779. Duckworth was promoted to commander ten days after this and given command of the sloop-of- war . After cruising off Martinique for a time, he was promoted to post captain on 16 June 1780 and given command of the 74-gun . He returned to the Princess Royal as flag-captain to Rear-Admiral Sir Joshua Rowley, with whom he went to Jamaica. He was briefly in command of , before moving into in February 1781, and returned to England with a trade convoy. In the years of peace before the French Revolution he was a captain of the 74-gun , lying at Plymouth. ==Revolutionary wars service== Fighting against France, Duckworth distinguished himself both in European waters and in the Caribbean. He was initially in command of the 74-gun from 1793 and served in the Channel Fleet under Admiral Lord Howe. He was in action at the Glorious First of June. Duckworth was one of few commanders specifically mentioned by Howe for their good conduct, and one of eighteen commanders honoured with the Naval Gold Medal, and the thanks of both Houses of Parliament. He was appointed to command the 74-gun in early 1794, and went out to the West Indies where he served under Rear-Admiral Sir William Parker. He was appointed commodore at Santo Domingo in August 1796. In 1798 Duckworth was in command of a small squadron of four vessels. He sailed for Minorca on 19 October 1798,p.278, Ross where he was a joint commander with Sir Charles Stuart, initially landing his 800 troops in the bay of Addaya,pp.369-370, Stephens and later landing sailors and marines from his ships, which included HMS Cormorant and , to support the Army. He was promoted to rear-admiral of the white on 14 February 1799 following Minorca's capture, and \"Minorca\" was later inscribed on his coat of arms. In June his squadron of four ships captured Courageux.p.348, Mostert In April 1800 was in command of the blockading squadron off Cadiz, and intercepted a large and rich Spanish convoy from Lima off Cadiz, consisting of two frigates (both taken as prizes) and eleven merchant vessels, with his share of the prize money estimated at \u00a375,000. In June 1800 he sailed to take up his post as the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief at Barbados and the Leeward Islands Station, succeeding Lord Hugh Seymour.p.371, Stephens Duckworth was nominated a Knight Companion of the most Honourable Military Order of the Bath in 1801 (and installed in 1803), for the capture of the islands of St. Bartholomew, St. Martin, St. Thomas, St. John and St. Croix and defeat of the Swedish and Danish forces stationed there on 20 March 1801. Lieutenant-General Thomas Trigge commanded the ground troops, which consisted of two brigades under Brigadier-Generals Fuller and Frederick Maitland, of 1,500 and 1,800 troops respectively. These included the 64th Regiment of Foot (Lieutenant-Colonel Edward Pakenham), and the 2nd and 8th West Indies Regiments, two detachments of Royal Artillery, and two companies of sailors, each of about 100 men. The ships involved, in addition to Leviathan, included , HMS Unite, , , HMS Amphitrite, , the brig , hired armed brig Fanny, schooner , and tender Alexandria. Aside from the territory and prisoners taken during the operation, Duckworth's force took two Swedish merchantmen, a Danish ship (in ballast), three small French vessels, one privateer brig (12-guns), one captured English ship, a merchant-brig, four small schooners, and a sloop.p.375, Stephens ==Service against Napoleon== ===West Indies=== From 1803 until 1804, Duckworth assumed command as the commander-in-chief of the Jamaica Station,Cundall, p. xx during which time he directed the operations which led to the surrender of General Rochambeau and the French army,cf.p.459, Nelson following the successful Blockade of Saint-Domingue. Duckworth was promoted to vice-admiral of the blue on 23 April 1804, and he was appointed a Colonel of Marines. He succeeded in capturing numerous enemy vessels and 5,512 French prisoners of war.pp.41-43, McAleer In recognition of his service, the Legislative Assembly of Jamaica presented Duckworth with a ceremonial sword and a gold scabbard, inscribed with a message of thanks.The merchants of Kingston provided a second gift, an ornamental tea kettle signifying Duckworth's defence of sugar and tea exports Both sword and kettle were subsequently gifted to the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich. Duckworth remained in Jamaica until 1805, returning to England that April aboard .pp.108-122, Lysons On his return to England again, he was called to face court-martial charges brought by Captain James Athol Wood of HMS Acasta, who claimed that Duckworth had transgressed the 18th Article of War; \"Taking goods onboard other than for the use of the vessel, except gold & etc.\" Duckworth had apparently acquired some goods, and in wishing to transport them home in person reassigned Captain Wood to another vessel on Jamaica station knowing that the vessel was soon to be taken under command by another flag officer. Consequently, Duckworth was able to take the goods to England as personal luggage, and Wood was forced to sail back as a passenger on his own ship. The court-martial was held on board in Portsmouth on 25 April 1805, but the charge was dropped on 7 June 1805. Sir John Thomas Duckworth, K.B., Papers, 1801-1807 Manuscript Group 18p.78, James; p.84, Stanier Clarke, Jones, Jones ===Atlantic=== In 1805 the Admiralty decided that Duckworth should raise his flag aboard HMS Royal George and sail to join Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson off Cadiz. However, the Plymouth Dockyards could not make Royal George ready to sail in time, and Duckworth was directed to raise his flag in HMS Superb, with Captain Richard Keats as his flag-captain. By the time of his arrival on 15 November, the Battle of Trafalgar had been fought. Duckworth was ordered to take command of the West Indies squadron involved in the blockade of Cadiz, with seven sail of the line, consisting of five 74-gun ships, the 80-gun and the 64-gun , and two frigates. Although known for a cautious character, he abandoned the blockade and sailed in search of a French squadron under Admiral Zacharie Allemand, which had been reported by a frigate off Madeira on 30 November, on his own initiative. While searching for the French, which eventually eluded him, he came across another French squadron on 25 December, consisting of six sail of the line and a frigate. This was the squadron under Contre-Admiral Jean-Baptiste Willaumez, heading for the Cape of Good Hope, and pursued by Rear-Admiral Sir Richard Strachan. Duckworth gave chase, but with his squadron scattered, decided not to risk engaging with his one ship, and gave it up. ==Return to the West Indies== Duckworth then set sail for the Leeward Islands to take on water, dispatching the 74-gun to reinforce the East Indies squadron. There, at Saint Kitts, he was joined on 21 January 1806 by the 74-gun ships and commanded by Sir Alexander Cochrane,p.308, Miller and on 1 February a brig commanded by Nathaniel Day Cochrane, which brought news of French at San Domingo.p.184, Ireland; p.105, Brenton The French had a squadron of five ships: the 120-gun Imperial, two 84-gun and two 74-gun ships and two frigates, under the command of Vice-Admiral Corentin Urbain Leiss\u00e8gues which escaped from Brestp.184, Ireland and sought to reinforce the French forces at San Domingo with about 1,000 troops.p.102, Anderson Arriving at San Domingo on 6 February 1806, Duckworth found the French squadron with its transports anchored in the Occa bay. The French commander immediately hurried to sea, forming a line of battle as they went. Duckworth gave the signal to form two columns of four and three ships of the line. ===Battle of San Domingo=== Duckworth's Action off San Domingo, 6 February 1806 by Nicholas Pocock (1808). Duckworth's flagship, the 74-gun Superb, is shown firing at the French flagship, the 120-gun Imperial. In the Battle of San Domingo, Duckworth's squadron defeated the squadron of French when > Duckworth at once made the signal to attack and \"with a portrait of Nelson > suspended from the mizzen stay of the Superb with the band playing 'God Save > the King' and 'Nelson of the Nile', bore down on the leading French ship > Alexandre of 84 guns and engaged her at close quarters. After a severe > action of two hours, two of the French ships were driven ashore and burnt > with three others captured. Only the French frigates escaped. The Fourth > Superb - Napoleonic glory Despite this, it is thought that Duckworth used his own ship cautiously, and the credit for the victory was due more to the initiative of the individual British captains. Duckworth nearly grounded his own ship as he attempted to board Imp\u00e9rial.p.309, Miller His victory over the French Admiral Leiss\u00e8gues off the coast of Hispaniola on 6 February together with Admiral Alexander Cochrane's squadron was a fatal blow to French strategy in the Caribbean region, and played a major part in Napoleon's eventual sale of Louisiana, and withdrawal from the Caribbean. It was judged sufficiently important to have the Tower of London guns fire a salute.p.382, Stephens San Domingo was added to Duckworth's coat of arms as words; a British sailor was added to the supporters of the Arms in 1814. A promotion to vice-admiral of the white in April 1806 followed,p.483, Knight; p.439, Stanier Clarke, Jones, Jones along with the presentation of a sword of honour by the House of Assembly of Jamaica, while his naval feats were acknowledged with several honours, including a sword of honour by the corporation of the City of London. A great dinner was also held in his honour as the Mansion House.p.9, Sconce On his return to England, Duckworth was granted a substantial pension of \u00a31,000 from the House of Commons, and the freedom of the city of London. Santo Domingo was the last significant fleet action of the Napoleonic Wars which, despite negative claims made about his personality, displayed Duckworth's understanding of the role of naval strategy in the overall war by securing for Britain mastery of the sea, and thus having sea-oriented mentality having placed a British fleet in the right strategic position.pp.2-3, Wegener Duckworth also displayed the willingness of accept changing tactics employed by Nelson, and maintained the superiority of British naval gunnery in battle. ===Mediterranean=== Duckworth's squadron forcing the Dardanelles Duckworth was appointed second in command of the Mediterranean Fleet in 1805p.261, Stanier Clarke, Jones, Jones primarily on consideration by the Admiralty of having a senior officer in the forthcoming operations with the Imperial Russian Navy. Sailing in the 100-gun first-rate HMS Royal George with eight ships of the line and four smaller vessels, he arrived at the island of Tenedos with orders to take possession of the Ottoman fleet at Constantinople, thus supporting Dmitry Senyavin's fleet in the Dardanelles Operation. Accompanying him were some of the ablest Royal Navy officers such as Sidney Smith, Richard Dacres and Henry Blackwood but he was in doubt of having the capability to breach the shore batteries and reach the anchored Ottoman fleet. Aware of Turkish efforts to reinforce the shore artillery, he nevertheless took no action until 11 February 1807 and spent some time in the strait waiting for a favourable wind. In the evening of the same day Blackwood's ship, accidentally caught fire while at anchor off Tenedos, and was destroyed, although her captain and most of the crew were saved and redistributed among the fleet.p. 187, Brenton Finally on 19 February at the Action at Point Pisquies (Nagara Burun), a part of the British force encountered the Ottoman fleet which engaged first. One 64-gun ship of the line, four 36-gun frigates, five 12-gun corvettes, one 8-gun brig, and a gunboat were forced ashore and burnt by the part of the British fleet. The British fleet consisted of , under Captain Thomas Harvey, , under Captain John Talbot, , under flag captain Richard Dacres, and , under Captain Arthur Kaye Legge, as well as the frigate , under Captain Richard Hussey Mowbray,p.51, Howard pp. 15\u201320,Howard under the command of Rear-Admiral Sir Sidney Smith, commanding the rear division.pp. 15\u201320,Howard They took one corvette and one gunboat, and the flags of the Turkish Vice-Admiral and Captain Pasha in the process, with adjacent fortifications destroyed by landing parties from HMS Thunderer, HMS Pomp\u00e9e, and HMS Repulse, while its 31 guns were spiked by the marines.p.189, Ireland The marines were commanded by Captain Nicholls of HMS Standard who had also boarded the Turkish ship of the line. There were eight 32 lb and 24 lb brass guns and the rest firing marble shot weighing upwards of 200 pounds.p. 23, Howard On 20 February the British squadron under Duckworth, having joined Smith with the second division of ships under command of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Louis, reached the Ottoman capital, but had to engage in fruitless negotiations with the Sultan's representatives, advised by Napoleon's ambassador S\u00e9bastiani, and with the accompanying British ambassador Charles Arbuthnot and Russian plenipotentiary Andrey Italinski, the latter being carried aboard on , under the command of Captain Thomas Bladen Capel,p.53, Howard, p.484, Knight due to the secret instructions that were issued as part of his orders for the mission,pp.3-5, Howard and therefore losing more time as the Turks played for time to complete their shore batteries in the hope of trapping the British squadron. Smith was joined a week later by Duckworth, who observed the four bays of the Dardanelles lined with five hundred cannon and one hundred mortars as his ships passed towards Constantinople. There he found the rest of the Turkish fleet of twelve ships of the line and nine frigates, all apparently ready for action in Constantinople harbour. Exasperated by Turkish intransigence, and not having a significant force to land on the shore, Duckworth decided to withdraw on 1 March after declining to take Smith's advice to bombard the Turkish Arsenal and gunpowder manufacturing works.p. 44, Howard The British fleet was subjected to shore artillery fire all the way to the open sea, and sustaining casualties and damage to ships from 26-inch calibre (650 mm) guns firing 300-800 pound marble shot.p.47, Howardp. 193, Brenton Though blamed for indecisiveness, notably by Thomas Grenville, the First Lord of the Admiralty,p.483, Knight Duckworth announced that > I must, as an officer, declare to be my decided opinion that, without the > cooperation of a body of land forces, it would be a wanton sacrifice of the > squadrons to attempt to force the passage p.114, Chatterton After his departure from Constantinople, he commanded the squadron protecting transports of the Alexandria expedition of 1807, but that was forced to withdraw after five months due to lack of supplies.p.522, Mostert Duckworth summed up this expedition, in reflection on the service of the year by commenting that > Instead of acting vigorously in either one or the other direction, our > cabinet comes to the miserable determination of sending five or six men-of- > war, without soldiers, to the Dardanelles, and 5000 soldiers, without a > fleet, to Alexandria.p.3, Higgins Soon after, he married again, on 14 May 1808 to Susannah Catherine Buller, a daughter of William Buller, the Bishop of Exeter. They had two sons together before his death, she survived him, dying on 27 April 1840.p.xxvi, Debrett ==The Channel Fleet== Duckworth's career however did not suffer greatly, and in 1808 and 1810 he went on to sail in HMS San Josef and HMS Hibernia, some of the largest first-rates in the Royal Navy, as commander of the Channel Fleet,p.311, Catesp.13, Sconce In the summer of 1809 he served on the panel of judges at the Court-martial of James, Lord Gambier which assessed whether Admiral Lord Gambier had failed to support Captain Lord Cochrane at the Battle of Basque Roads in April 1809. Gambier was controversially cleared of all charges. pp.124-125, James, Chamier ==Newfoundland and War of 1812== Probably because he was thought of as irresolute and unimaginative,p.323, Miller on 26 March 1810 Duckworth was appointed Governor of Newfoundland and Commander-in- Chief of the Newfoundland Station's three frigates and eight smaller vessels.p.18, Sconce Although this was a minor command in a remote station spanning from Davis Strait to the Gulf of St Lawrence, he also received a promotion to admiral of the blue, flying his flag aboard the 50-gun . While serving as Governor he was attacked for his arbitrary powers over the territory, and retaliated against the pamphleteer by disallowing his reappointment as surgeon of the local militia unit, the Loyal Volunteers of St John, which Duckworth renamed the St John's Volunteer Rangers, and enlarged to 500 officers and militiamen for the War of 1812 with the United States. Duckworth also took an interest in bettering relationship with the local Beothuk Indians, and sponsored Lieutenant David Buchan's expedition up the Exploits River in 1810 to explore the region of the Beothuk settlements. As the governor and station naval commander, Duckworth had to contend with American concerns over the issues of \"Free Trade and Sailor's Rights.\" His orders and instructions to captains under his command were therefore directly concerned with fishing rights of US vessels on the Grand Banks, the prohibition of United States trade with British colonials, the searching of ships under US flag for contraband, and the impressment of seamen for service on British vessels. He returned to Portsmouth on 28 November in HMS Antelope after escorting transports from Newfoundland. The Salisbury And Winchester Journal, Monday, 30 November 1812 ==Semi-retirement== On 2 December 1812, soon after arriving in Devon, Duckworth resigned as governor after being offered a parliamentary seat for New Romney on the coast of Kent. At about this time he found out that his oldest son George Henry had been killed in action while serving in the rank of a Colonelp.210, Clarke with the Duke of Wellington, during the Peninsular War. George Henry had been killed at the Battle of Albuera at the head of the 48th (Northamptonshire) Regiment of Foot. Sir John was created a baronet on 2 November 1813, adopting a motto Disciplina, fide, perseverantia (Discipline, fidelity, perseverance),p.716, Burke and in January 1815 was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Plymouth 45 miles from his home; a post considered one of semi-retirement by his successor, Lord Exmouth.p.206, Osler However, on 26 June that year it became a centre of attention due to the visit by bearing Napoleon to his final exile, with Duckworth being the last senior British officer to speak with him before his departure on board .p.30, Sconce Duckworth died at his post on the base in 1817 at 1 o'clock, after several months of illness;p.37, Sconce after a long and distinguished service with the Royal Navy. He was buried on 9 September at the church in Topsham, where he was laid to rest in the family vault, with his coffin covered with crimson velvet studded with 2,500 silvered nails to resemble a ship's planking. ==Memorials== Duckworth depicted in his last year on a commemorative medal minted by his friends. When in England for winters during his term as Governor of Newfoundland, Duckworth lived on a property called Weare House of Weare Park in Topsham, Devon. He had purchased the house in 1804 and rebuilt over several years.Exeter Memories, Countess Wear, Weare Park His property, and half of the golf course that the Exeter Golf and Country Club now occupies, was the largest US Navy Supply Depot in the south of England during the Second World War, with some later retained for use by a UK MOD Naval Store. During the Second World War one Royal Navy warship, the destroyer HMS Duckworth was named after the Admiral. In England, The Duckworth House is in Kent St, Portsmouth PO1 to be found not far from the Portsmouth Historic Dockyard complex. Duckworth Street in St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada is named in his honour. ==Notes== a. Some accounts mention only Leviathan, , and .p.37, James b. The sword was forged by Richard Teed (1756-1816) of Lancaster Court, London, and carried the inscription: Presented in 1804 by the Assembly of Jamaica to Vice Admiral Sir I.T. Duckworth in remembrance of his effectual protection afforded to the commerce and coasts of the island. By his able disinterested distribution of H.M. Naval Forces under his command & as a testimony of the high sense entertained by the Assembly of the eminent service he has thereby rendered to that country.\" c. Brenton records a story of amazingly lucky wind changes that allowed this news to be delivered to Duckworth within two days. d. The Naval Chronicle gives 9 November 1805. e. Richard Teed was responsible for the manufacture and supply of the swords presented by the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund to deserving sailors and soldiers during the Napoleonic Wars, 1803\u201314; the sword is now part of the sword collection of the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich. f. Miller (p. 311) reports \"twelve ships of the line and nine frigates\", but Howard (p. 37) gives \"twelve ships of the line, two of them three-deckers, and nine frigates filled with troops\" g. The new spelling is Wear, in Countess Wear on the outskirts of Exeter. ==References== ===Works cited=== * Allen, Joseph, Esq.
