    "text": "The Israel Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) is a fund for cancer research. The ICRF was founded in 1975 by a group of American and Canadian physicians, scientists and lay people who sought to prevent the permanent loss of Israel's most promising cancer researchers to foreign universities due to the lack of funding in Israel for newly minted Ph.D.s, post-doctoral fellows and accomplished young scientists (a phenomenon known to many as Israel's \"brain drain\"). With chapters in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Toronto, Montreal and Jerusalem, ICRF annually sponsors a rigorous grant review process conducted by an expert panel of U.S. and Canadian scientists and oncologists, and modeled on the NIH grant-making process. Awards are granted directly to the most promising and capable Israeli cancer researchers at all of the leading (more than 20) academic and biomedical research centers throughout Israel. ICRF has funded more than $63 million to-date in awards to Israeli cancer researchers via more than 2,349 fellowships, project grants, career development awards and professorships. Grants have been provided to over 20 institutions including all major hospitals, universities and cancer research projects throughout Israel. Breakthrough discoveries by ICRF-funded scientists have led to the development of: Gleevec -used in the successful treatment of chronic myelogenous leukemia; Doxil - used in the treatment of breast & ovarian cancer as well as AIDS; p53 \u2013 a key tumor suppressor; RAD 51 which identifies the likelihood of breast cancer occurring in women who carry the BRCA 2 gene and Velcade - listed in the Wall Street Journal as the top medical breakthrough of 2003 and used in the treatment of multiple myeloma. The basic research ICRF funds has led to treatments and drugs that are benefiting cancer patients worldwide. ==Awards== *ICRF directly funds individual scientists, rather than \"bricks and mortar.\" Money goes directly to research. *ICRF is \"institution-neutral.\" Its funding goes to scientists at all of Israel's top biomedical research centers. *ICRF awards are made without deduction of institutional overhead. 100% of awarded funds go to scientists in Israel. *ICRF awards are made solely on the basis of scientific merit and the ability of the individual scientist to make a significant impact in his/her field. *ICRF awards are often the first grants that young Israeli scientists receive following completion of their academic training, and have a lifelong impact on the ability of young Israeli scientists to begin their professional careers in Israel. ==See also== *Marcelle Machluf ==External links== *ICRF Website *ICRF Israel Chapter Website Category:Cancer organizations based in Israel ",
