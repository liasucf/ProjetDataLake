The 2016 Summer Paralympics were held from 7\u201318 September 2016, a total of 4,328 athletes representing 159 National Paralympic Committees took part. The Comoros team failed to show up to the Games. ==Disability classifications== Every participant at the Paralympics has their disability grouped into one of five disability categories; amputation, the condition may be congenital or sustained through injury or illness; cerebral palsy; wheelchair athletes, there is often overlap between this and other categories; visual impairment, including blindness; Les autres, any physical disability that does not fall strictly under one of the other categories, for example dwarfism or multiple sclerosis. Each Paralympic sport then has its own classifications, dependent upon the specific physical demands of competition. Events are given a code, made of numbers and letters, describing the type of event and classification of the athletes competing. Some sports, such as athletics, divide athletes by both the category and severity of their disabilities, other sports, for example swimming, group competitors from different categories together, the only separation being based on the severity of the disability. ==Swimming== ;Men {|class=wikitable style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !rowspan=2|Athlete !rowspan=2|Events !colspan=\"2\"|Heats !colspan=\"2\"|Final |- !Time !Rank !Time !Rank |-align=center |align=left|Ahamada Hassani |align=left|50 m freestyle S9 |colspan=2|Did not start |colspan=2|Did not advance |} == See also == *Comoros at the 2016 Summer Olympics == References == Category:Nations at the 2016 Summer Paralympics 2016 Paralympics ",
