    "text": "Rubaru Roshni is a 2019 Indian anthology documentary film directed by Svati Chakravarty Bhatkal. Narrated by Aamir Khan and produced by Khan and Kiran Rao, it tells three real life stories in a first-person account of both the victims and the perpetrators of violence; the murders of Lalit Maken and his wife, the murder of Mariam Vattalil and the 2008 Mumbai attacks are covered. The documentary premiered on 26 January 2019 in seven languages on all Star Network channels. It was also released on the streaming platform Hotstar and Netflix, on 20 August 2019. ==Development== Bhatkal had worked with Khan on the latter's television show Satyamev Jayate. After it was finished, she read an article about Lalit Maken's daughter and the killer of Mariam Vattalil. She said that it \"struck a chord\" and she decided to investigate. Khan quickly showed interest into producing it after hearing the idea for Bhatkal. The documentary was originally titled Where the Light Comes In, which Bhatkal had derived from a Rumi poem. Later, Khan suggested her a hindi title. Rubaru Roshni was made completely unscripted. ==Reception== Peter Griffin of The Hindu wrote: \"More than [Svati's] filmmaking skills \u2014 which are evident \u2014 what shines through is her feel for story, her empathy, her ability to probe beyond the surface, to step back from the easy slope of bathos.\" Sreehari Nair of Rediff.com said, \"Svati Chakravarty Bhatkal knows how to ask sharp questions without being hostile, and Rubaru Roshni offers a steady accumulation of perspectives when it is purely a dialogue between Bhatkal and the participants.\" Subhash K. Jha called the film \"profoudly moving\" and \"therapeutic\". Sana Farzeen from The Indian Express wrote: \"In a time when violence and hatred have become a normal affair, Rubaru Roshni makes you sit up and introspect about things around you.\" Johnson Thomas of The Free Press Journal called it a \"rare documentation of humaneness \u2013 one that elevates the experience of it to uncharted heights!\" Udita Jhunjhunwala of Firstpost observed that the film makes us \"sympathise with the victims and survivors of course, but the gut-punch comes as you get an insight into the psyche and motivations of the criminals.\" The Quint's Urmi Bhattacheryya wrote: \"What stands out about Rubaru Roshni is its depiction of raw emotional vulnerabilities \u2013 a theme that\u2019s bound to touch a nerve, almost universally.\" Joel Kurian of Republic TV noted it as \"definitely one of the most touching movies you will see in recent times.\" Manik Sharma of Arre said that it \"stands on its own, as an atypically arresting Indian film that demands much more than the platitudes of violence and revenge we are familiar as a nation with.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:Indian documentary films Category:Documentaries about historical events Category:Indian television films Category:Films based on 1984 anti-Sikh riots Category:Films based on the 2008 Mumbai attacks Category:Indian anthology films Category:2019 documentary films Category:2019 films Category:Star India ",
