The House was founded by Victor Canard and L\u00e9onie Duch\u00eane, who gave their names to the champagne house. Majestic Wines Blog Oddbins ==History== In 1860, a barrel-maker called Victor Canard met a winemaker called L\u00e9onie Duch\u00eane. They fell madly in love and got married. They both shared a great passion for wine and so they worked collaboratively to produce their own unique Champagne. Using Victor's skills in farming grapes and ageing wines in barrels and L\u00e9onie's expertise in wine-tasting and viniculture, they produced a Champagne only 8 years after they met. Leonie was able to work in the wine industry during a time when the role of women was largely consigned to household duties. Both Victor and L\u00e9onie put their surnames together to create Canard-Duch\u00eane. It is still one of the few wineries in Champagne to be family-run. During the tumultuous aftermath of the French Revolution, Canard- Duch\u00eane still managed to appeal to the citizens of France who abhorred any symbols of aristocracy. This was probably because Canard-Duch\u00eane never had large profit margins, unlike other houses such as Laurent-Perrier, and Mo\u00ebt & Chandon. It was also due to the lucky fact that Napoleon loved drinking Champagne. Indeed, it was just after the French Revolution that the art of sabrage (opening a Champagne bottle with a sword) was invented and developed. Canard-Duch\u00eane has always been well-associated with this noble yet fun art form and holds tournaments where sommeliers compete in the art of sabrage. In 1890, Victor and L\u00e9onie's son Edmond brought international fame to the Champagne House. He even penetrated the very close circle of the suppliers to the Court of Tsar Nicolas II of Russia. After Edmond secured a contract to be the official supplier of Champagne to the Romanov king, Canard-Duch\u00eane adopted the Russian Imperial coat of arms as part of its logo, the two-headed eagle. The symbol of the two-headed eagle is itself steeped in history: it is one of the oldest symbols of the duality of power of the emperor over both the state and the church, dating right back to the Byzantine period.

Subsequently, the House saw substantial growth on European markets. The takeover by the independent Champagne group Thi\u00e9not occurred in October 2003. ==Champagnes== Canard- Duch\u00eane produces a diverse range of champagnes. ===Canard-Duch\u00eane Brut Non- Vintage Champagne=== The Authentic Brut Non-Vintage epitomises the Canard- Duch\u00eane style, where freshness and intensity unite nobility and nature. It is made from a blend of 60 different Cru wines, and the blend of grapes is made up of 45% Pinot Noir, 35% Pinot Meunier and 20% Chardonnay. Reserve wines from several years make up at least 20% of the blend in order to give a consistent style year after year. Canard-Duch\u00eane Authentic Brut is characterised by its straw-yellow appearance and delicate mousse. Intense aromas of fresh fruit can be detected on the nose, typical of the Pinot grape varietals. On the palate, fruit aromas intermingle with pastry notes, a sign of excellent maturity. The Canard-Duch\u00eane Authentic Brut can be enjoyed with light foods, and particularly as an aperitif. ===Canard-Duch\u00eane Brut Non-Vintage Ros\u00e9 Champagne=== Delicate and feminine, the Canard-Duch\u00eane Authentic Ros\u00e9 reveals its distinctly elegant style. Canard-Duch\u00eane Authentic Ros\u00e9 is a blend of 50% Pinot noir, 20% Pinot Meunier and 30% Chardonnay. The reserve wines, particularly red wines crafted from Pinot Noir from the Montagne de Reims, make up at least 10% of the blend in order to give a consistent style year after year. With its delicate, pinkish hue and magnificent, pearlised ribbon, the Canard-Duch\u00eane Authentic Ros\u00e9 stands out for its intense, fresh fruit aromas of strawberries and raspberries against a backdrop of mineral notes for enhanced freshness. This ros\u00e9 is delightful as an aperitif, can be enjoyed at parties or to accompany delicately-sweet desserts. ===Grande Cuv\u00e9e Charles VII NV Champagne=== Charles VII was launched in 1968 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Canard-Duch\u00eane. The original name refers to the king who was led by Joan of Arc to be crowned in the Reims Cathedral in 1429. The Charles VII champagnes offer great finesse and a subtle elegance, the expression of the know-how of Canard-Duch\u00eane. From the very beginning, the concept of the Grande Cuv\u00e9e Charles VII has remained unchanged: a selection from among Champagne's most prestigious crus, a blend of several exceptional vintages that perpetuates the House's distinctive style: Fruity, elegant and versatile. ==Environment== Unlike most major Champagne houses which are situated near the town, Canard-Duch\u00eane is firmly established in the countryside of Ludes. They aim for harmony between the buildings, the gardens and the Montagne de Reims National Park. For the last 20 years Canard-Duch\u00eane has made a commitment to sustainable agriculture and environmentally friendly production techniques. The House recently launched an 'Authentic Green' initiative wherein they produced a Champagne made solely from organically-grown grapes. According to the Canard-Duch\u00eane website, \"No words can express Canard-Duch\u00eane's commitment to authentic organic principles better than its own hallmark 'Naturellement Noble'. 'Naturellement' contains the word 'Nature' which suggests love, respect and protection of Nature. 'Noble' conveys a feeling of greatness, generosity and responsibility\". ==Awards== Canard-Duch\u00eane wines consistently obtain awards across the board for the Champagnes they produce.
