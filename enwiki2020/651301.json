LaGuardia is named after former congressman and New York City mayor Fiorello H. LaGuardia. The college offers associate degrees in the arts, sciences, and applied sciences, as well as continuing education programs. ==History== LaGuardia Community College was founded on January 22, 1967, by a resolution of the Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, a New York State agency which was the precursor to the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York.Fitzpatrick, John. \"City University of New York\" U.S. History Encyclopedia The new college, originally designated \"Community College Number Nine\", was to be comprehensive: \"The college will be oriented to the needs and interests of the community in which it is located, providing cultural activities, special services, continuing education and skills training opportunities for community residents of all ages.\" The college's first president was Joseph Shenker, who had been Acting President of Kingsborough Community College and at age 29, the youngest community college president anywhere. In October 1970, the Board of Higher Education, breaking with CUNY\u2019s geographic naming convention, named the new college after Mayor LaGuardia, noting his \"lifelong public service to the people of the City of New York and of the United States, and his ambitious and successful leadership of good government campaigns to provide decent living conditions and guarantee democratic processes for all....\" The college was officially opened on September 22, 1971, and received its first accreditation from the Middle States Association in December 1972 when the college graduated its first class. The La Guardia and Wagner Archives was established on campus in 1982.\"About the La Guardia and Wagner Archives.\" ==Campus== On March 24, 1970, the NYC Board of Higher Education approved the former Ford Instrument Company building on Long Island City's Thomson Avenue as the location for the College. Renovations to the five-story, former factory, which had most recently been used to manufacture material for the U.S. Army in World War II, began the same year. This building would serve as the Main building of the new college\u2014renamed Shenker Hall in 2009 in honor of the College\u2019s founding president.http://webdev.laguardia.edu/livewire/98/98.pdf On September 22, 1972, the school received from the U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare, for payment of $1, a site in Astoria that had formerly been the U.S. Army Pictorial Center, with the intention of moving the college to a campus on the new site, but when the city's budget crisis hit in 1974, the site had to be sold off, as the expense of maintaining it in the interim was too high. In the years since its founding, the college has maintained its original building and has expanded into nearby buildings. The college owns and occupies the historic Sunshine Biscuits Building, or building \"C\", on their main campus which also houses the Long Island City Business Coalition. ==Academics== In the 2010-2011 school year, LaGuardia granted 2,197 degrees, of which 96% were associate degrees, and 4% were certificates.

This undergraduate enrollment made the college the third largest community college in the CUNY system, after the Borough of Manhattan Community College and Kingsborough Community College. ==Student body== LaGuardia's student body is made up of people from 160 different countries who speak 127 languages natively.

It consists of a red square with nine arrows signifying the College\u2019s inception as Community College Number Nine. The arrows come together in the center of the logo mark to represent introspection, and the negative space at the center and between each of the arrows forms a star representing infinite growth. The emanating lines convey the energy, ideas, and solutions that emerge when coming together to ask, \u201cWhat if?\u201d Before this logo, LaGuardia used a flower with five petals, symbolizing the five boroughs of New York City; and the first name of its namesake, Fiorello, which in Italian translates to \"Little Flower.\" Capitalizing on its reputation as one of the most diverse campuses in the country, the college also used an apple logo covered with various national flags. The apple was taken from the \"Big Apple\" nickname for New York City. ==References== ==Further reading== * Golway, Terry (1997).
