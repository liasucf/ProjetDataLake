    "text": "Shamal is the sixth studio album released under the name Gong and was released by Virgin Records on 13 February 1976 The album, produced by Pink Floyd drummer Nick Mason was recorded in December 1975. The album was recorded by a unique line-up referred to later as \"Shamal-Gong\". It is usually regarded as a transitional album between Daevid Allen's incarnation of the band and the Pierre Moerlen-led fusion line-up of the late 1970s. ==Reception== Reviewing the album for the website Sputnikmusic, Robert Davis said: > The greatest thing about Shamal is that it's so versatile. There are only > six tracks here, but each one seems to explore a different tone and aspect > of musical experimentation. The softer tracks such as opener \"Wingful of > Eyes\" and beautiful, elegant flute-led \"Bambooji\" are complementary to the > album's quirkier tracks, such as the almost Frank Zappa-inspired \"Cat in > Clark's Shoes\" and eccentric closing title track. Yet what really glues all > these songs together is the absence of self-indulgent musicianship and a > definite knowledge of perfect instrumental placements. == Track listing == In 2018, a 2-CD remastered edition of the album was issued by UMC containing one CD of live material recorded in 1975, and unreleased bonus tracks to the regular album. == Personnel == ===Personnel=== ;Gong * Mike Howlett \u2013 bass guitar, vocals * Didier Malherbe \u2013 tenor sax, soprano sax, flute, bansuri, gongs * Mireille Bauer \u2013 marimba, glockenspiel, xylophone, percussion, gongs * Pierre Moerlen \u2013 drums, vibraphone, tubular bells * Patrice Lemoine \u2013 organ, piano, synthesizer ;Former Gong * Steve Hillage \u2013 acoustic guitar, electric guitar (\"Bambooji\" and \"Wingful of Eyes\") * Miquette Giraudy \u2013 vocals (\"Bambooji\") ;Guest musicians * Jorge Pinchevsky \u2013 violin * Sandy Colley \u2013 vocals (\"Shamal\") ===Production=== * Nick Mason: producer * Clive Arrowsmith: artwork, photography * Phil Ault: engineer * Dave Hutchins: engineer * Ben Tavera King: engineer * Rick Curtain: engineer * Ben King: engineer ==References== Category:1975 albums Category:Gong (band) albums Category:Albums produced by Nick Mason Category:Pierre Moerlen's Gong albums Category:Progressive rock albums by British artists ",
