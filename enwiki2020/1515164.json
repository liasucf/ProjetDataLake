According to one source, while the film features footage of the exterior of the Club, the scenes inside the Club were actually filmed in a studio in the United Kingdom, where it had been recreated. The club also appeared in the 1994 Wong Kar-wai movie Chungking Express. Takeshi Kaneshiro and Brigitte Lin have drinks there before going to a hotel room. The club appears also in the book Zero Minus Ten by Raymond Benson (1997) where James Bond meets Sunni Pei (consume girl and striptease dancer), a member of the Hong Kong mafia \"The Triads\". ==References== ==External links== * Gwulo.com entry * 1973 advertisement for the Bottoms Up Club * The sign of the Bottoms Up Club in 1985 * Entrance of the Bottoms Up Club (Tsim Sha Tsui): * Inside the Bottoms Up Club (Tsim Sha Tsui) * Sign of the Bottoms Up Club (Wan Chai) * Category:Tsim Sha Tsui Category:Wan Chai Category:Tourist attractions in Hong Kong Category:1971 establishments in Hong Kong Category:Drinking establishments in Hong Kong Category:2009 disestablishments in China ",
