The British Government requisitioned her in 1940 and she was converted to an armed infantry landing ship for World War 2. Renamed first HMS Hydra, then HMS Keren, she was used to land troops for action in Madagascar, Sicily and North Africa. The British India Line refused an option to resume ownership after the war in 1946 and consequently she was purchased by the British Ministry of Transport. Laid up at Holy Loch in Scotland she was subsequently purchased by the Vaslav group. In 1949 the vessel broke moorings and was swept ashore in a heavy storm. In 1950 ownership was transferred to the Sitmar Line which re-modelled and refitted the ship in Genoa in the following year, and named the Castel Felice (\u2018Happy Castle\u2019) for her inaugural Australian voyage to Melbourne.Plowman, P.

Brian McArdle, photojournalist and editor of Walkabout (passenger 1955) his wife Marie relates: \"Last night at sea was celebrated with a party - vino flowed freely, bottoms were pinched by hitherto very dignified and authoritative officers bent on dancing the night away. Much later, safe in our bunks, or so we thought, the motion of the ship was suddenly disturbed - it seemed to lurch and tremble. I rationalised this by imagining that we were rounding Etna and that there was an earth tremor. But more was to come; a knock at the door and a voice saying \"We've been rammed, there's a huge hole in the side of the ship, luckily above the water line!\" Phew! Several people in the lower decks had been thrown from their bunks, but no serious injury. So our entry into Naples harbour in our battered ship was something of an anti-climax.\" Marie Shaw in personal correspondence to Dr James McArdle, 1999 * Bruce Beresford, Australian film director, moved to the UK in 1963.Wortham, Anne and Wortham, Christopher J (2009) Fragments; from Two Lives on Three Continents.
