The hacked data had been leaked by Guccifer 2.0 to the HelloFLA blog. === 2018 campaign === On April 25, 2018, physician Mark Freeman announced a primary challenge to Mast, focusing on his promise to \"defend the Second Amendment\" and be an \"unwavering partner\" to President Trump.

The proposed act, reported TCPalm, \"would make sugar import quotas more flexible and protect taxpayers from government-funded buyouts of surplus sugar\". Mast said he would \"probably be the only representative in the history of this district to vote against the sugar industry\". That said, Mast also accepted over $15,000 in campaign donations from the executives at Florida Crystals (sugar company) and the Fanjul family that owns the company. === Donald Trump === In June 2016, Mast said he supported Donald Trump \"unanimously and wholeheartedly\" in the 2016 presidential election.

In February 2017, he voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request ten years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session. On December 18, 2019, Mast voted against both articles of impeachment against Trump. Of the 195 Republicans who voted, all voted against both impeachment articles. === Drug policy === Mast supports the right of states to set their own marijuana laws, including the right to medical marijuana, without federal interference. === Gay rights === Mast believes it was a mistake for the US Supreme Court to get involved with the same-sex marriage issue. === Gun policy === Mast wrote an opinion piece in The New York Times in support of the Second Amendment right to bear arms, but \"it does not guarantee that every civilian can bear any and all arms.\" Mast supports a ban on assault weapons in the United States, citing his military background\u2014\"I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people being used to kill the children I swore to defend.\" Mast rejects the idea that the Second Amendment protects the rights of civilians to bear \"any and all\" arms. Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Mast announced his support for the following policies: prohibiting the sale of assault and tactical firearms without confiscating such weapons that are already owned, ensuring that all firearm purchasers undergo a background check, improving background checks, banning the sale of gun accessories that enhance the firing rate of weapons, such as bump stocks, preventing those who have been detained for mental illnesses from purchasing firearms, ensuring that those on the Terror Watch List cannot purchase firearms, and placing anyone who makes threats of violence against schools on an FBI watch list for \"a long time\". Mast also supports conducting further research on gun violence, which is currently prohibited in some ways by federal law.

On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass the American Health Care Act. === Immigration === In June 2018, commenting on the Trump administration family separation policy, Mast said: \"It is our duty as an American government to deal compassionately with any child from any nation just as it is the responsibility of foreign families seeking asylum in the U.S. to choose only legal means to enter our nation so they can avoid family disruption. I am confident this process will be improved.\" Citing his own Mexican grandparents, he said, \"The way that they got to work, the way that they assimilated to the American way of life and became a part of our system is not what we're seeing across the board.\" In June 2018, a volunteer for the Democratic Party of Martin County who was angry about the Trump administration's immigration policy, was arrested after threatening to kill Mast's children. The first trial in the case ended in a mistrial in April 2019. === International diplomacy === Mast said he would support a Republican proposal to cut U.S. funding to the United Nations. Mast was not an admirer of Obama's Middle East policy. \"ISIS is as strong as it is because of a lack of US leadership,\" he said in 2016 \"ISIS could have been defeated at the time of the Arab Spring if we had sent in special operations forces. What's being done now is too little too late. It's going to require an all-out military effort. The only way to guarantee peace is to make the enemy surrender.\" === Iran nuclear deal === Mast views Obama's Iran nuclear deal as a betrayal by the US of its own national security as well as that of Israel, Jordan, and other regional allies. \"The deal has aligned us with a Shia regime, which is just enabling extremism. This is going to make it very hard to get Sunni regimes to align with us, and Putin is now the go-to player in Syria with his alliance with Assad,\" he said in 2016. === Israel === Mast is \"a vocal supporter of Israel and Israelis\", reported The Times of Israel during his 2016 campaign. \"If anyone was lobbing rockets into the US, guys like me would be sent to kill them, and Americans would applaud us,\" he said. === Military and veterans affairs === Mast, who sits on the House Veterans Affairs Committee, was the first Member of Congress to open an office inside a federal agency. The office in question, which was opened in 2018, was inside the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs facility. In 2018 he introduced a House bill that would make it easier for other House members to do the same. But in 2019, the Department of Veterans Affairs would evict Representative Mast from the West Palm Beach office.Rep.

Mast sent the VA Secretary Robert Wilkie a letter of complaint regarding the eviction.Mast letter to Secretary Wilkie, Document Cloud, 17 Sep 2019. === Taxes and budget === In October 2017, Mast voted against the original version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 due to \"out of control\" federal spending, fear of the national debt growing, and a desire to see lower tax rates with loopholes closed. In December 2017, he voted in favor of the final version of the bill. He says the bill \"provides a lot of confidence to a lot of people\" and is \"a great moment for our country and our community\". == Honors == During his twelve years of service in the U.S. Army, he received the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Defense Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal with \"V\" for valor device. He was invited by President Barack Obama as a guest to his 2011 State of the Union Address and was seated with First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden. Mast was named one of 10 House freshmen to watch by the Washington, D.C. newspaper The Hill, out of 55 new members of the House elected in 2016. == Criticism == In August 2020, inappropriate Facebook comments made by Mast in 2009 and 2011 came to light, and the politician was moved to apologize for what he called \"disgusting and inappropriate jokes that I am embarrassed to have associated with my name today\". Mast's decade-old comments were directed to Mast's friend Rocco LeDonni, who is now Mast's political campaign manager. Mast's 2009 comment was in response to a photo of LeDonni traveling in South Africa, to which Mast said, \"im so proud of you... i hope you hook up with at least fifteen 15 year olds over there.... its legel there right.\" Later in 2011, LeDonni had publicly asked, \"Anyone have any good pick up lines for this weekend considering according to the crazy christian radio guy the world may end on sunday?\" To which Mast responded, \"How about don\u2019t turn this rape into a murder\". The posts which had stayed public for 11 years were deleted shortly after the media contacted Mast about their contents, but screen shots had been saved. The discovery brought new scrutiny on one of Mast's key initiatives: building support for rape survivors in the military. In Mast's apology, he noted, \"A decade ago when I was in the Army, and following my injury...\", but one Republican news editor has called this a \"lie\" because Mast's comment about 15-year-old girls was posted to Facebook a year before Mast was injured. On October 13, 2019, Mast posted a Twitter wish for happy birthday to the United States Navy, accompanying an apparent stock photograph of the Russian battlecruiser Pyotr Velikiy. It was quickly deleted after being mocked. == Personal life == Mast lives in Palm City, Florida, with his wife Brianna and their four children, Madalyn, Maverick, Magnum, and Major. As of a 2016 news story, he attended the evangelical Calvary Chapel. In January 2015, Mast volunteered with the Israel Defense Forces, working at a base outside Tel Aviv, packing medical kits and moving supplies. == See also == * List of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress == References == == External links == * Congressman Brian Mast official U.S. House website * Campaign website * * * * Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act |- Category:1980 births Category:21st-century American politicians Category:American amputees Category:American army personnel of the War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present) Category:American politicians of Mexican descent Category:American politicians with physical disabilities Category:Bomb disposal personnel Category:Florida Republicans Category:Harvard Extension School alumni Category:Hispanic and Latino American members of the United States Congress Category:Living people Category:American evangelicals Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Florida Category:Military personnel from Florida Category:Military personnel from Michigan Category:Politicians from Grand Rapids, Michigan Category:People from St. Lucie County, Florida Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:United States Army soldiers Category:United States Department of Homeland Security officials Category:American gun rights activists ",
