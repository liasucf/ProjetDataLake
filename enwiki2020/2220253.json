    "text": "DaDa is the eighth solo studio album by American singer Alice Cooper, released on September 28, 1983 by Warner Bros. Records. DaDa would be Cooper's last album until his sober re-emergence in 1986 with the album Constrictor. The album's theme is ambiguous, however, ongoing themes in the songs' lyrics suggest that the main character in question, Sonny, suffers from mental illness, resulting in the creation of many different personalities. The album alludes strongly to the dadaist movement. Its cover was based on a painting by surrealist artist Salvador Dal\u00ed titled Slave Market with the Disappearing Bust of Voltaire. Produced by long-time collaborator Bob Ezrin, at the time his first production with Cooper in six years, DaDa was recorded at ESP Studios in Buttonville, Ontario, Canada. DaDa peaked at No. 93 in the UK but failed to dent the US Billboard Top 200. \"I Love America\" was released as a single solely in the UK over a month after the album's release. Guitarist and co- songwriter Dick Wagner revealed in 2014 that Cooper had relapsed to drinking heavily during the recording of DaDa,\"Albums Unleashed - DaDa w/Dick Wagner (Ep. 134)\" audio interview and had suggested that the album was a contract fulfillment requirement for which Warner Bros. was not pleased and consequently made no effort to promote,Interview with Dick Wagner though Warner Bros. has never confirmed or denied this. This and other details, like the real-life cocktail waitresses that inspired \"Scarlet and Sheba\" are in his autobiography Not Only Women Bleed. Cooper reportedly has no recollection of recording DaDa, or the preceding albums Special Forces and Zipper Catches Skin, due to substance abuse. Cooper stated \"I wrote them, recorded them and toured them and I don't remember much of any of that\",Love And Poison, An Alice Cooper Interview though he toured only Special Forces.Alice Cooper Tour Archive In 1996 Cooper said that DaDa was the scariest album he ever made,Dominic, Serene; \"Hanging with Mr. Cooper\"; in Phoenix New Times; June 20, 1996 and that he never had any idea what it was about. There was no tour to promote DaDa, and none of its songs have ever been played live. DaDa was Cooper\u2019s final album for his long-time label Warner Bros., and after its release he took a three-year hiatus from the music industry. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== Credits are adapted from the DaDa liner notes. *Alice Cooper \u2013 vocals *Dick Wagner \u2013 guitar; bass guitar; backing vocals *Prakash John \u2013 bass guitar on \u201cFresh Blood\u201d *Richard Kolinka \u2013 drums ;Additional personnel *Graham Shaw \u2013 Oberheim OB-X; Roland Jupiter; backing vocals *Bob Ezrin \u2013 Fairlight CMI programming; keyboards; drums; percussion *John Anderson \u2013 drums *Karen Hendricks \u2013 backing vocals *Lisa DalBello \u2013 backing vocals ;Production *Bob Ezrin \u2013 producer; engineer *Dick Wagner \u2013 associate producer ==Influence== DaDa is cited asMugshots Biography the main inspiration behind the birth of the Italian Dark/Shock Rock band the Mugshots, the first ever European band produced by Dick Wagner, who is also featured on \"Love, Lust and Revenge\".
