    "text": "Moonbathers is the fifth studio album by the Dutch symphonic metal band Delain. It was released on 26 August 2016 worldwide. It features one guest appearance from Alissa White-Gluz (Arch Enemy, ex-The Agonist). Just like We Are the Others, this album does not feature Marco Hietala (Nightwish, Tarot). It is also the first and only studio album with Ruben Israel (Lesoir) on drums and the first studio album with Merel Bechtold (MaYaN, Purest of Pain, Karmaflow) on rhythm guitar. ==Background== According to lead singer Charlotte Wessels, the lyrics on the album have a theme of death. This was unintentional and she only realized this after reviewing the lyrics she had written. Wessels has said that the title of the album comes from the idea that \"Even in a dark place, there can also be that comfort in the dark.\" The songs \"Danse Macabre\" and \"Chrysalis (The Last Breath)\" were inspired by a film script, however she didn't specify which one.http://sonicshocks.tumblr.com/post/149071897053/interview-delain- charlotte-wessels-by-matt *\"Scandal\" is a Queen cover. * \"Turn the Lights Out\" was inspired by DC comic series \"The Sandman\" by Neil Gaiman. * \"Hands of Gold\" contains fragments of \"The Ballad of Reading Gaol\" by Oscar Wilde. * \"Suckerpunch\" and \"Turn the Lights Out\" were previously released on Lunar Prelude. == Track listing == == Personnel == ;Delain * Charlotte Wessels \u2013 lead vocals * Timo Somers \u2013 lead guitar, backing vocals * Merel Bechtold \u2013 rhythm guitar * Otto Schimmelpenninck van der Oije \u2013 bass * Martijn Westerholt \u2013 keyboards, backing vocals, orchestration, production * Ruben Israel \u2013 drums ;Additional musicians * Alissa White-Gluz (ex-The Agonist, Arch Enemy) \u2013 guest vocals on \"Hands of Gold\" * Guus Eikens \u2013 additional guitars * Hendrik Jan de Jong (Nemesea) \u2013 writing credits (3, 10) * Oliver Philipps \u2013 additional guitars, additional keyboards * Mikko P.
