Park was the first woman to ever become the deputy head of the Ministry of Education or its preceding agencies which dates back to 1948. Before becoming the Vice Minister of Education in May 2017, she was the deputy Superintendent of Seoul Office of Education from July 2016 and previously North Chungcheong Office of Education from December 2014. After passing the state exam in 1989, she dedicated her career in public service - mostly at the Ministry or its preceding agency. In 2005 she became its head of University Affairs Bureau - the youngest to assume this level at South Korean government at the age of 40.
