The founders were Hans A. Nikel and Hans Hermann. However, there is another report citing the founders as Adolf Theobald and Stephen Wolf. In September 1961 the magazine became a monthly publication. Willy Fleckhaus was Twen's art director throughout its existence. Notable photographers included Christa Peters. Twen was pitched at \"people in their twenties, from 15 to 30\", thus its name, Twen. It was read in both West and East Germany. The magazine folded with the June 1971 issue. ==References== Category:1959 establishments in West Germany Category:1971 disestablishments in West Germany Category:Defunct magazines published in Germany Category:Visual arts magazines published in Germany Category:Bi-monthly magazines published in Germany Category:German-language magazines Category:Monthly magazines published in Germany Category:Magazines established in 1959 Category:Magazines disestablished in 1971 ",
