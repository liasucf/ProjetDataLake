    "text": "A video of John Feal discussing his experiences with the World Trade Center Health Program John Feal (born November 13, 1966) is an American political activist and retired construction worker from Commack, NY, known for his advocacy on behalf of first responders to the September 11 attacks. In 2001, Feal was a demolition supervisor at Ground Zero when a falling steel beam landed on his foot. He developed gangrene, then sepsis, and eventually required partial amputation. As Feal's injury occurred just outside of a 96-hour window following the attack, he was denied compensation for the injury. The denial led to him becoming an advocate for 9/11 first responders. Feal founded the FealGood Foundation, dedicated toward lobbying members of the U.S. Congress to provide additional funding to 9/11 responders, as well as connecting responders with various resources. In 2019, Feal worked closely with comedian and fellow advocate Jon Stewart to lobby Congress for the renewal of a 9/11 victim's compensation fund. After Senators Rand Paul and Mike Lee opposed motion for unanimous consent of the renewal, Feal and Stewart appeared in a viral segment on Fox News lambasting the Senators. ==References== Category:Living people Category:1960s births Category:People associated with the September 11 attacks ",
