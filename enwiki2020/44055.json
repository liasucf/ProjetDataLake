    "text": "In mathematics and in particular measure theory, a measurable function is a function between the underlying sets of two measurable spaces that preserves the structure of the spaces: the preimage of any measurable set is measurable. This is in direct analogy to the definition that a continuous function between topological spaces preserves the topological structure: the preimage of any open set is open. In real analysis, measurable functions are used in the definition of the Lebesgue integral. In probability theory, a measurable function on a probability space is known as a random variable. ==Formal definition== Let (X,\\Sigma) and (Y,\\Tau) be measurable spaces, meaning that X and Y are sets equipped with respective \\sigma-algebras \\Sigma and \\Tau. A function f:X\\to Y is said to be measurable if for every E\\in \\Tau the pre- image of E under f is in \\Sigma; i.e. \\forall E \\in \\Tau : f^{-1}(E) := \\\\{ x\\in X |\\; f(x) \\in E \\\\} \\in \\Sigma. That is, \\sigma (f)\\subseteq\\Sigma, where \\sigma (f) is the \u03c3-algebra generated by f. If f:X\\to Y is a measurable function, we will write : f \\colon (X, \\Sigma ) \\rightarrow ( Y, \\Tau ). to emphasize the dependency on the \\sigma-algebras \\Sigma and \\Tau. ==Term usage variations== The choice of \\sigma-algebras in the definition above is sometimes implicit and left up to the context. For example, for {\\mathbb R}, {\\mathbb C}, or other topological spaces, the Borel algebra (containing all the open sets) is a common choice. Some authors define measurable functions as exclusively real-valued ones with respect to the Borel algebra. If the values of the function lie in an infinite-dimensional vector space, other non- equivalent definitions of measurability, such as weak measurability and Bochner measurability, exist. == Notable classes of measurable functions == * Random variables are by definition measurable functions defined on probability spaces. * If (X,\\Sigma) and (Y,T) are Borel spaces, a measurable function f:(X,\\Sigma)\\to(Y,T) is also called a Borel function. Continuous functions are Borel functions but not all Borel functions are continuous. However, a measurable function is nearly a continuous function; see Luzin's theorem. If a Borel function happens to be a section of some map Y\\xrightarrow{~\\pi~}X, it is called a Borel section. * A Lebesgue measurable function is a measurable function f : (\\mathbb{R}, \\mathcal{L}) \\to (\\mathbb{C}, \\mathcal{B}_\\mathbb{C}), where \\mathcal{L} is the \\sigma-algebra of Lebesgue measurable sets, and \\mathcal{B}_\\mathbb{C} is the Borel algebra on the complex numbers \\mathbb{C}. Lebesgue measurable functions are of interest in mathematical analysis because they can be integrated. In the case f:X\\to\\mathbb{R}, f is Lebesgue measurable iff \\\\{f>\\alpha\\\\}=\\\\{x\\in X:f(x)>\\alpha\\\\} is measurable for all \\alpha\\in\\mathbb{R}. This is also equivalent to any of \\\\{f\\ge\\alpha\\\\},\\\\{f<\\alpha\\\\},\\\\{f\\le\\alpha\\\\} being measurable for all \\alpha, or the preimage of any open set being measurable. Continuous functions, monotone functions, step functions, semicontinuous functions, Riemann-integrable functions, and functions of bounded variation are all Lebesgue measurable. A function f:X\\to\\mathbb{C} is measurable iff the real and imaginary parts are measurable. == Properties of measurable functions == * The sum and product of two complex-valued measurable functions are measurable. So is the quotient, so long as there is no division by zero. * If f:(X,\\Sigma_1)\\to(Y,\\Sigma_2) and g:(Y,\\Sigma_2)\\to(Z,\\Sigma_3) are measurable functions, then so is their composition g\\circ f:(X,\\Sigma_1)\\to(Z,\\Sigma_3). * If f:(X,\\Sigma_1)\\to(Y,\\Sigma_2) and g:(Y,\\Sigma_3)\\to(Z,\\Sigma_4) are measurable functions, their composition g\\circ f: X\\to Z need not be (\\Sigma_1,\\Sigma_4)-measurable unless \\Sigma_3 \\subseteq \\Sigma_2. Indeed, two Lebesgue-measurable functions may be constructed in such a way as to make their composition non-Lebesgue-measurable. * The (pointwise) supremum, infimum, limit superior, and limit inferior of a sequence (viz., countably many) of real-valued measurable functions are all measurable as well. *The pointwise limit of a sequence of measurable functions f_n: X \\to Y is measurable, where Y is a metric space (endowed with the Borel algebra). This is not true in general if Y is non-metrizable. Note that the corresponding statement for continuous functions requires stronger conditions than pointwise convergence, such as uniform convergence. ==Non-measurable functions== Real- valued functions encountered in applications tend to be measurable; however, it is not difficult to find non-measurable functions. In any measure space (X,\\Sigma) with a non-measurable set A\\subset X, A otin\\Sigma, one can construct a non-measurable indicator function: :\\mathbf{1}_A:(X,\\Sigma)\\to\\mathbb{R}, \\quad \\mathbf{1}_A(x) = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{ if } x \\in A \\\\\\ 0 & \\text{ otherwise}, \\end{cases} where \\mathbb{R} is equipped with the usual Borel algebra. This is a non-measurable function since the preimage of the measurable set \\\\{1\\\\} is the non-measurable A. As another example, any non-constant function f:X\\to\\mathbb{R} is non-measurable with respect to the trivial \\sigma-algebra \\Sigma=\\\\{\\emptyset,X\\\\}, since the preimage of any point in the range is some proper, nonempty subset of X, which is not an element of the trivial \\Sigma. ==See also== *Vector spaces of measurable functions: the L^p spaces *Measure-preserving dynamical system ==Notes== ==External links== * Measurable function at Encyclopedia of Mathematics * Borel function at Encyclopedia of Mathematics Category:Measure theory Category:Types of functions ",
