    "text": "Maria (Masha) Gordina (born January 13, 1968) is a Russian-American mathematician. She is a professor of mathematics at the University of Connecticut. Her research is at the interface between stochastic analysis, differential geometry, and functional analysis, including the study of heat kernels on infinite-dimensional groups. Gordina is the daughter of mathematician Mikhail (Misha) Gordin.Mikhail Gordin ==Education and career== Gordina earned a diploma in 1990 from Leningrad State University, and became an assistant professor at the Leningrad Electrotechnical Institute. She completed her doctorate in 1998 from Cornell University; her dissertation, Holomorphic functions and the heat kernel measure on an infinite dimensional complex orthogonal group, was supervised by Leonard Gross. Gordina held a post-doctoral appointment at McMaster University. She was awarded a National Science Foundation postdoctoral fellowship in 2000, and conducted research at the University of California, San Diego. In 2003 Gordina joined the University of Connecticut faculty. Gordina serves on the editorial boards of Forum Mathematicum Forum Mathematicum, the Electronic Journal of Probability Electronic Journal of Probability, and Electronic Communications in Probability Electronic Communications in Probability. ==Honors== Gordina was awarded a Humboldt Research fellowship in 2005 (with renewals), and the Ruth I. Michler Memorial Prize of the Association for Women in Mathematics in 2009. She was named a Simons Fellow Gordina, Simons Fellow (2016) in Mathematics and Physical Sciences. ==Selected publications== * Baudoin, Fabrice; Feng, Qi; Gordina, Maria Integration by parts and quasi-invariance for the horizontal Wiener measure on foliated compact manifolds.
