    "text": "{| |} The North American Aviation A-27 is an attack version of the North American BC-1. Ten aircraft were ordered by Thailand as NA-69 light attack aircraft. Instead of being delivered to Thailand, the aircraft were taken over in October 1940 by the United States Army Air Corps (USAAC) to keep them out of Japanese hands and redesignated A-27 under the USAAC aircraft designation system. Assigned to Nichols Field in the Philippines and used as a trainer, all A-27s were destroyed within a month during the Japanese invasion of that country during World War II. ==Operators== ; *United States Army Air Corps **4th Composite Group, Nichols Field, Luzon, Philippines ***3rd Pursuit Squadron - 1941 ***17th Pursuit Squadron - 1941 ***20th Pursuit Squadron - 1941 ; ==Specifications (A-27)== ==See also== ==References== * North American A-27 Category:World War II ground attack aircraft of the United States A-27 Category:Single-engined tractor aircraft Category:Aircraft first flown in 1938 ",
