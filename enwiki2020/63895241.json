    "text": "\"Can I\" is a song by American singer Kehlani featuring Canadian singer and rapper Tory Lanez released as track two from Kehlani's second album It Was Good Until It Wasn't. It was sent to rhythmic contemporary radio on June 3, 2020, as the album's sole single. A video dedicated to sex workers was released on July 30, in which Lanez does not appear. Kehlani announced that Lanez's verse would be omitted from the album's upcoming deluxe edition shortly after he was arrested for carrying a concealed firearm in his vehicle, an incident in which rapper Megan Thee Stallion was shot. \"Can I\" is the highest-charting song from It Was Good Until It Wasn't, peaking at number 50 on the Billboard Hot 100. It is also Kehlani's second-highest charting song, behind \"Gangsta\". ==Background== During a Twitter listening session, Kehlani said \"Can I\" is one of her favorite songs on the album, with her favorite line being \"sniper gang no bradley cooper\" a reference to Bradley Cooper's 2014 film American Sniper. Prior to its release, Lanez called it the \"nastiest song on the project\". Following Lanez's arrest for having a concealed firearm outside a party, where rapper Megan Thee Stallion was shot in her feet, fans questioned Kehlani on the inclusion of Lanez's verse going forward. Kehlani explained on July 29, 2020, in a since-deleted tweet, that since the album came out months ago, she can not remove the original, but \"can only move forward\", stating his verse would be removed and replaced on the album's deluxe edition and that he would not appear in the song's video either. The shooter was not revealed at the time, however Kehlani clarified: \"I stand with women, believe women, & i love my friends. If that's something that turns you off from me or makes you no longer support, bless you forreal you have no reason to have ever supported me in the first place.. i'm not your cup of tea\". Kehlani and Megan previously collaborated on \"Hit My Phone\" from Megan's EP Suga. Megan also performed a skit on It Was Good Until It Wasn't. ==Composition== Described as a seductive\", \"luxuriant sex jam\", \"Can I\" is a neo soul, R&B; ballad, detailing the \"typical push-pull that exists between couples\". It contains \"spurts\" of echoing guitar strings and \"bubbly creaking\", while, as noted by HotNewHipHops Rose Lilah, \"Kehlani gets her flow off, singing her lyrics stacked on top of one another, quickly ushering in the next line as she wraps up the first. Tory Lanez mimics the flow for his verse, too\". The song interpolates the chorus of Aaliyah's 2002 song \"Come Over\". Kehlani previously interpolated \"Come Over\" on her 2017 track, \"Personal\". ==Critical reception== Various critics named the track a standout from its parent album. Hannah Mylrea of NME called it \"a glowering cut\", and said it is reminiscent of \"early Drake, if only Drizzy had a penchant for neo-soul\". musicOMHs Ben Devlin called the song an \"effective collaboration\", noting its \"earworm verse that's hookier than the hook\". Exclaim!s Veracia Ankrah was less favorable, opining that it \"lacks the clever subtlety of innuendos\". ==Music video== The song's official video was released on July 30, 2020, directed by Sebastian Sdaigui and Kehlani (under her creative alias Hyphy Williams). It is Kehlani's sixth \"qurantine style\" video, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kehlani described the visual as an \"ode to sex work, honoring sex workers, uplifting their movement\". The video is similar to her previous single \"Toxic\", except the roles are reversed: Kehlani watches various sex workers, including some of her transgender friends, performing for her via live webcam. The video concludes with monologue from Kehlani's friend, writer and activist Da'Shaun Harrison talking about the difficulties faced by Black sex work. Tory Lanez does not appear in the video, although his verse does. ==Charts== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2020) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- ! scope=\"row\" | New Zealand Hot Singles (RMNZ) | 13 |- |- |- |- |- ! scope=\"row\"| US Rolling Stone Top 100 | 23 |} ==References== Category:2020 singles Category:2020 songs Category:Songs written by Kehlani Category:Kehlani songs Category:Songs written by Tory Lanez Category:Tory Lanez songs Category:Atlantic Records singles Category:Rhythm and blues songs Category:Neo soul songs Category:Ballads Category:Songs about sexuality Category:Songs written by Jazze Pha Category:Songs written by Bryan-Michael Cox Category:Songs written by Pop Wansel Category:Songs written by Johnt\u00e1 Austin ",
