    "text": "James M. Letherer (December 30, 1933 \u2013 December 18, 2001), born and died in Saginaw, Michigan, better known as Jim Letherer, was an American civil rights activist. He walked on crutches the entire 54 miles of the 1965 Selma to Montgomery march for voting rights, and in 1966 walked with Martin Luther King, Jr. in James Meredith's Mississippi March Against Fear. Letherer lost his right leg to cancer when he was ten years old. Letherer has received honors by the Selma to Montgomery Interpretive Center Museum in Alabama, which hosts a life-size statue of the amputee. He received mention and a verse in a book by Pete Seeger: Letherer was involved with a march to aid cancer research in 1984, and in 1985 he joined the 20-year reunion of the Selma to Montgomery march participants in Selma, Alabama. ==References== ==External links== * Uncle Jim Letherer Martin Luther King Selma - Montgomery March Jimmy Letherer Paul Category:1933 births Category:2001 deaths Category:American civil rights activists Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:American amputees Category:American Jews Category:Selma to Montgomery marches ",
