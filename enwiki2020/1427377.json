    "text": "Rabbi Isser Zalman Meltzer wearing a spodik A spodik (or spodekNote: spodek means \"saucer\" in Polish) is a tall, black fur hat worn by some Hasidic Jews, particularly by members of sects in 19th-century Congress Poland. The spodik and the shtreimel are most likely of Tatar or Oriental origin. ==Description== Spodiks are to be distinguished from kolpiks, and from shtreimels, which are a similar types of fur hat worn by Hasidim. Shtreimels are shorter in height, wider, and donut-shaped, while spodiks are taller, thinner in bulk, and of cylindrical shape. Kolpics and spodiks have the same shape, but the former are brown, while the latter are black. Such hats are typically worn only on special occasions, such as the Sabbath, holidays, and weddings. Spodiks used to be made from fisher tails. Nowadays they are made also from fox fur. ==Use== Ger Hasidim, being the largest Hasidic community of Polish origin, are the most famous for wearing spodiks. Virtually all married men among the Gerer Hasidim wear a spodik. Due to an edict by the Grand Rabbi of Ger designed to stop the extravagance of the hats, Gerrer Hasidim are only allowed to purchase fake fur spodiks that cost less than $600. Other groups that wear Spodiks include Alexander, Amshinov, Ashlag, Kotzk, Modzitz, Ozharov, Radzin and Sochatchov. ==See also== * Shtreimel - traditional Jewish fur hat * Kolpik - traditional Jewish fur hat * List of headgear ==References== Category:Fur Category:Hasidic clothing Category:Hats Category:Religious headgear ",
