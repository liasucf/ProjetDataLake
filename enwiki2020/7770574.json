In his first two games, Bradshaw fumbled twice on kickoff returns. He was fourth in the National Football Conference with a 26.0-yard kickoff return average when the Giants replaced him with veteran Reuben Droughns. Bradshaw returned to returning kickoffs for the November 18 game against the Detroit Lions. Injuries to teammates Brandon Jacobs and Derrick Ward, and the disappointing play of Droughns, gave Bradshaw his first regular season carries against the Minnesota Vikings. He gained 29 yards on four carries in the game. On December 23, 2007, he scored his first NFL touchdown on an 88-yard run in the fourth quarter against the Buffalo Bills. It was the third longest run in Giants history and the longest run of the 2007 season.Ahmad Bradshaw, Brandon Jacobs carry the torch from Tiki Barber He finished the game with a career-high 151 yards on 17 carries. Bradshaw was used more frequently as a change of pace back to Jacobs during the Giants 2007 playoff run. He had a great performance in the NFC Championship game in Green Bay, including a 52-yard would-be touchdown run in the fourth quarter that was negated by a holding penalty. He contributed greatly to his team's success in Super Bowl XLII against the New England Patriots, gaining 45 yards (the most of all running backs) and even recovering a fumble by quarterback Eli Manning. The Giants went on to win the Super Bowl, defeating the previously undefeated New England Patriots 17\u221214, and ending their opponent's bid for a perfect 19-0 season. ====2008==== Bradshaw averaged 6.7 yards per carry as the third running back for the Giants in 2008. He was reduced to third string running back due to a strong performance by Derrick Ward, who finished the season with more than 1,000 rushing yards. ====2009==== In 2009, Bradshaw was second string running back behind Brandon Jacobs with Derrick Ward's departure to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He rushed for a then career-high 778 yards and 7 touchdowns on the season. Bradshaw also had a career receiving long play of 55 yards. ====2010==== Bradshaw was promoted to first-string running back ahead of Brandon Jacobs in 2010, due to Jacobs's disappointing 2009 season. After a two turnover game against the Eagles in Week 9, Bradshaw was demoted to make room for Brandon Jacobs's return. Bradshaw led the league in turnovers (for running backs) for most of the 2010 season. Despite these obstacles, Bradshaw finished the season with career highs in rushing yards (1,235) and rushing touchdowns (8). ====2011==== In 2011, Bradshaw signed a four-year deal worth $18 million and $9 million guaranteed with a $5 million bonus.

The touchdown was unusual in that the Patriots permitted Bradshaw to score unopposed, to prevent the Giants from running out most of the remaining time before winning the game with a field goal. Bradshaw, aware of the Patriots' strategy, attempted to stop himself from crossing the goal line but fell backward into the end zone. The Patriots failed to score, however, and the Giants thus won 21\u221217. ====2012==== 2012. Although Bradshaw mostly played along rookie David Wilson for the starting role, he had a fairly decent season. Bradshaw only missed two games due to injuries to his knee and foot. Despite having his minutes declining because of Wilson, He played in 14 games, had 221 rushing attempts, 1,015 rushing yards, and 6 touchdowns.
