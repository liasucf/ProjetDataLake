He was considerably more critical of Adam and Joe's presenting, calling the pair \"dismal\" and their contributions \"an unmitigated disaster\". Rowland also questioned the final list \u2013 he bemoaned the lack of close-up magic tricks in favour of large illusions on stage. ==Legacy== The special was featured in a 2018 episode of the BBC One show Pointless Celebrities. One hundred members of the public had been given 100 seconds to name, from memory, as many magicians on the list as possible. The episode's finalists, Robert Lindsay and his daughter Sydney Stevenson, then had to name any magician who had not been listed by the 100 people. Paul Daniels, David Copperfield, Penn & Teller, David Blaine, Tommy Cooper, Derren Brown and The Great Soprendo were the only magicians to be named by the 100 people. ==References== ==External links== * * * *Fifty Greatest Magic Tricks at the BFI Category:2002 British television series debuts Category:2002 British television series endings Category:Channel 4 documentaries Category:English-language television shows Category:Magic tricks Category:Television series by All3Media ",
