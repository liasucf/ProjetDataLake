    "text": "Czechoslovak Trade Union Association (), abbreviated to OS\u010c, was a national trade union center, founded in 1897 in what was then the Austro-Hungarian Empire. With the break-up of the empire, the OS\u010c emerged as the major trade union force in Czechoslovakia up to the Second World War. ==Organizational history== ===Foundation=== Odborov\u00e9 sdru\u017een\u00ed \u010deskoslovansk\u00e9 ('Czechoslav Trade Union Association') was founded in Prague on January 31, 1897. The OS\u010c represented a desire on the part of Czech trade unionists to build a Czech trade union movement separate from the Viennese Imperial Trade Union Commission (the 'Vienna Commission'), the culmination of two years of complaints by Czech trade unionists that the Vienna Commission was neglecting the Czech labour movement.Kevin McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929: A Study of Their Relations with the Communist Party and the Moscow Internationals. Boulder, CO: East European Monographs, 1988; pp. 4-6. The formation of OS\u010c did not, however, represent a total break with the Vienna Commission; several OS\u010c unions retained affiliations with the Vienna Commission. The founding congress was attended by 108 delegates, representing 90 trade union organizations, who met in the metalworkers' assembly hall in Karl\u00edn. Fourteen trade union organizations not represented at the congress also supported the OS\u010c's formation. Josef Rou\u0161ar was elected its secretary. The new organization was linked to the Czechoslav Social Democratic Workers Party.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pp. 6-7. ===Competition between Prague and Vienna centres=== The OS\u010c and the Vienna Commission had a complicated and vacillating relationship for several years. In 1902, the OS\u010c accepted that the Vienna Commission would be the sole representative of the trade union movement in the Austrian Empire to the international strike fund of the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres. Aside from this concession, however, the OS\u010c demanded autonomy for the ethnic Czech trade union movement. Yet over the next three years, several OS\u010c member unions, including its strongest one, the Union of Metalworkers, joined the Vienna Commission. In 1904 Rou\u0161ar was replaced as the secretary by Josef Steiner. Under Steiner's leadership, relations with the Vienna Commission worsened. In advance of the 1905 Amsterdam congress of the International Secretariat of National Trade Union Centres, the OS\u010c sought recognition as a separate trade union centre. The congress allowed an OS\u010c representative was allowed to attend as a guest but rejected the OS\u010c's bid for recognition.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pg. 8. The tensions between OS\u010c and the Vienna Commission peaked in 1905 and 1906. The Vienna Commission argued that the Czech autonomism was a minority standpoint within the labour movement, while the OS\u010c became more vocal. The OS\u010c began a process of regaining some unions that had been lost to the Vienna Commission from 1902 to 1905. In early 1906 the Union of Shoemakers rejoined.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pp. 10-11. ===Growth of OS\u010c=== In 1909 the Union of Metalworkers rejoined OS\u010c. The following year unions organizing chemical workers, leatherworkers, miners and tailors followed suit. In 1910 Rudolf Tayerl\u00e9 succeeded Steiner. The Vienna Commission became increasingly frustrated as the OS\u010c expanded its sphere of influence. By 1911 the OS\u010c had established a considerable following in Moravia and Silesia. This development marked a definite break with the Vienna Commission. Nevertheless, the Vienna Commission unions continued to encompass the majority of ethnic Czech workers in those regions.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pp. 11-14. ===War=== The outbreak of the First World War in 1914 was a heavy blow to the organizational growth of the OS\u010c. Many union activists were drafted and sent to the battlefields. Prices of essential commodities rose, making the bargaining position of workers weaker. By the end of the year the OS\u010c had lost almost half of its membership. Several local structures were closed down and several OS\u010c publications were discontinued. Repressive measures were enacted by the government in order to forestall strikes in the strategically important mining and industrial sectors. Strikers or protesters could be punished with jail or being sent to the front.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pp. 18-19. By 1917 the tide turned. Inequalities in wage increases between ethnic German and ethnic Czech workers angered the Czech working class. In the scope of a year, the OS\u010c membership tripled, although membership levels still lagged behind the prewar level. Recruitment was particularly strong in heavy industries. The influx posed some organizational challenges for OS\u010c and coincided with a shift from craft unionism to mass industrial unionism.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pg. 20. ===Independence and the unity of the labour movement=== Between April and October 1918, OS\u010c negotiated a possible merger with the National Socialist \u010ceskoslovensk\u00e1 obec d\u011blnick\u00e1 (\u010cOD). The negotiations ended unsuccessfully because the \u010cOD insisted that unions should subordinate themselves to political parties.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pg. 35. In October 1918 the OS\u010c changed its name to Odborov\u00e9 sdru\u017een\u00ed \u010deskoslovensk\u00e9 ('Czechoslovak Trade Union Association'). Discussions between OS\u010c and Slovak Social Democratic trade unions began in December 1918. On February 2, 1919, a Regional Trade Union Council of OS\u010c was formed in Slovakia, with a secretariat in Ru\u017eomberok. Later a secretariat was set ut in Bratislava. In March 1919 OS\u010c started a Slovak-language publication, Priekopnik ('Pioneer'). By this time OS\u010c had a membership of 30 000 workers in Slovakia.McDermott, The Czech Red Unions, 1918-1929, pp. 22, 35, and 36. Also, by February 1919, the Vienna Commission union organization that were now within the boundaries of the independent Czechoslovak Republic merged into OS\u010c. Likewise OS\u010c branches in areas that were now parts of Austria had already joined Austrian unions. ==Footnotes== Category:Trade unions in Austria-Hungary Category:National trade union centers of Czechoslovakia Category:1897 establishments in Austria-Hungary Category:Trade unions established in 1897 ",
