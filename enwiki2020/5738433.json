    "text": "Emerillon (alternate names Emerilon, Emerion, Mereo, Melejo, Mereyo, Teco) is a Tupi\u2013Guarani language spoken in French Guiana on the rivers Camopi and Tampok. The Emerillon people refer to their language as Teke and it is mutually intelligible to Wayampi a language indigenous to French Guiana and Brazil. Emerillon is only used along the French Guiana borders with Surinam and Brazil. There are only four hundred Emerillon speakers in the world. Although there are a limited number of speakers, Emerillon is still taught as a first language to children. Its name derives from mere\u00f1\u00f5, a name given to members of the Emerillon tribe. They often refer to themselves as the Teko people which translates to \"human being\" in Way\u00e3pi. ==Orthography== Emerillon is spelt phonetically based on the International Phonetic Alphabet, and not according the French orthography. The spelling uses the letter \u0268 for the close central unrounded vowel between i and u. e is always pronounced \u00e9, vowels with a tilde are always nasal (\u00e3, \u1ebd, \u0129, \u00f5, \u0169), \u00f6 is like the German O umlaut, and b is prenounced mb. All letters are pronounced. ==References== ==Bibliography== * Category:Tupi\u2013Guarani languages Category:Languages of French Guiana ",
