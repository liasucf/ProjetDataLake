    "text": "Eastern Cree syllabics are a variant of Canadian Aboriginal syllabics used to write all the Cree dialects from Moosonee, Ontario to Kawawachikamach on the Quebec\u2013Labrador border in Canada that use syllabics. Cree syllabics uses different glyphs to indicate consonants, and changes the orientation of these glyphs to indicate the vowel that follows it. The basic principles of Canadian syllabic writing are outlined in the article for Canadian Aboriginal syllabics. In this article, Cree words and sounds will transcribed using the Standard Roman Orthography. ==Inventory== The primary difference between eastern and western Cree orthographies is the shape of the final consonants (consonant sounds with no following vowel). Eastern Cree dialects write finals with a superscripted a-syllabic. \u14ab\u1505\u1470\u14a1 /m\u0101sk\u014dc/ has two finals, \u1505 /s/ and \u14a1 /c/. Other differences are placing the diacritic for labialization (/w/) before rather than after the letter\u2014\u1456\u143a /t\u0101pw\u0113/ (Western Cree \u1456\u143b),\u2014and several additional series for consonants not found in Western Cree. {| class=wikitable |+ Eastern Cree syllabic character table ! rowspan=2|Initial ! colspan=\"7\" | Vowels ! rowspan=2|Final |- ! width=\"40\" | \u00ea ! width=\"40\" | i ! width=\"40\" | o ! width=\"40\" | a ! width=\"40\" | ii ! width=\"40\" | oo ! width=\"40\" | aa |- ! | \u1401 | \u1403 | \u1405 | \u140a | \u1404 | \u1406 | \u140b | |- ! p | \u142f | \u1431 | \u1433 | \u1438 | \u1432 | \u1434 | \u1439 | \u1449 |- ! t | \u144c | \u144e | \u1450 | \u1455 | \u144f | \u1451 | \u1456 | \u1466 |- ! k | \u146b | \u146d | \u146f | \u1472 | \u146e | \u1470 | \u1473 | \u1483 |- ! c | \u1489 | \u148b | \u148d | \u1490 | \u148c | \u148e | \u1491 | \u14a1 |- ! m | \u14a3 | \u14a5 | \u14a7 | \u14aa | \u14a6 | \u14a8 | \u14ab | \u14bb |- ! n | \u14c0 | \u14c2 | \u14c4 | \u14c7 | \u14c3 | \u14c5 | \u14c8 | \u14d0 |- ! s | \u14ed | \u14ef | \u14f1 | \u14f4 | \u14f0 | \u14f2 | \u14f5 | \u1505 |- ! sh | \u1510 | \u1511 | \u1513 | \u1515 | \u1512 | \u1514 | \u1516 | \u1525 |- ! y | \u1526 | \u1528 | \u152a | \u152d | \u1529 | \u152b | \u152e | \u153e (\u1424) |- ! r | \u1543 | \u1546 | \u1548 | \u154b | \u1547 | \u1549 | \u154c | \u1550 |- ! l | \u14d3 | \u14d5 | \u14d7 | \u14da | \u14d6 | \u14d8 | \u14db | \u14ea |- ! v*, f* | \u1553 | \u1555 | \u1557 | \u1559 | \u1556 | \u1558 | \u155a | \u155d |- ! th* | \u155e | \u1560 | \u1564 | \u1566 | \u1562 | \u1565 | \u1567 | \u156a |- ! w | \u140c | \u140e | \u1412 | \u1417 | \u1410 | \u1414 | \u1419 | \u1424 |- ! h | \u1426\u1401 | \u1426\u1403 | \u1426\u1405 | \u1426\u140a | \u1426\u1404 | \u1426\u1406 | \u1426\u140b | \u1426 |} * The glyphs for v ([v]) \\ f ([f]) and th ([\u00f0] and [\u03b8]) are rare and used only in words borrowed from other languages. However, the Inuktitut adaptation of Eastern Cree syllabics commonly uses the Eastern Cree v \\ f set as their v set. Other finals: * There is in Moose Cree an /sk/ final which merges into one character \u1505 /s/ and \u1483 /k/. \u140a\u14a5\u1509 /amisk/ beaver * The Moose Cree final /y/ is a ring written above the previous syllabic instead of the raised /ya/: \u140b\u18c1 /\u0101\u0161ay/ now. * East Cree has special finals for \u1484 /kw/ and \u14bd /mw/ which are raised versions of the o-syllabics. \u14a5\u1505\u144e\u1484 /mistikw/ tree. * Naskapi does not mark vowel length at all and uses two dots, either placed above or before a syllable, for a w: \u141b wa, \u1416 wo, \u1465 twa, \u1482 kwa, \u14a0 cwa (), \u14ba mwa, \u14cf nwa, \u1504 swa, \u153d ywa. Since Naskapi s- consonant clusters are all labialized, sCw-, these also have the two dots: \u150c spwa, etc. There is also a labialized final sequence, \u150a -skw, which is a raised sa-ko. == External links == *Cree syllabics at languagegeek.com Downloadable Unicode syllabics fonts and keyboard layouts for all dialects of Cree *eastcree.org Cree fonts page Fonts and keyboard layouts for East Cree *Talking syllabic chart A mapping between roman and syllabic orthographies for East Cree (audio) Category:Cree language Category:Canadian Aboriginal syllabics ",
