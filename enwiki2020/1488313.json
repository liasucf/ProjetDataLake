In February 2008 he was laureated with the Business Social Responsibility Award from the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, a nonpartisan institution created by the U.S. Congress within the Smithsonian Institution. ==Biography== Garza Lag\u00fcera was born in Monterrey as the first son of industrialist Eugenio Garza Sada and Consuelo Lag\u00fcera Zambrano. After finishing high school at Chaminade College Preparatory School in St. Louis, Missouri, he received a bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of Texas and an MBA from the Monterrey Institute of Technology, a private university founded and sponsored by his father. He began his professional life at a laboratory of T\u00e9cnica Industrial in 1947. In 1969 he was appointed to the Grupo Visa's board of directors, which he chaired starting in 1981. He also presided over the Serf\u00edn Bank during the peso devaluation of 1982 and the subsequent nationalization of all private banks. Grupo Serf\u00edn lost half its size at that time and had to be reorganized accordingly. In 1991 when the government decided to re-privatize the banking system, Eugenio Garza Lag\u00fcera bought the Bancomer Banking Group. Garza Lag\u00fcera died on 24 May 2008 in Monterrey, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, at the age of 84. ==References== Category:1926 births Category:2008 deaths Category:Mexican brewers Category:Mexican bankers Category:Businesspeople from Monterrey Category:Cockrell School of Engineering alumni Category:Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education alumni Category:Chaminade College Preparatory School (Missouri) alumni ",
