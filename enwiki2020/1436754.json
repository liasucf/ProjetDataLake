    "text": "Earth-Two (also Earth Two or Earth 2) is a setting for stories (a \"fictional universe\") appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. First appearing in The Flash #123 (1961), Earth-Two was created to explain differences between the original Golden Age and then-current Silver Age versions of characters such as the Flash, and how the current (Earth-One) versions could appear in stories alongside earlier versions of the same character concepts. Earth-Two includes DC Golden Age heroes, including the Justice Society of America, whose careers began at the dawn of World War II, concurrently with their first appearances in comics. Earth-Two, along with the four other surviving Earths of the DC Multiverse, were merged into one in the 1985 miniseries Crisis on Infinite Earths. However, following the events of Infinite Crisis, the Multiverse was reborn, although the subsequent Earth-Two was not the same as its pre-Crisis equivalent. Following the events of Flashpoint, the setting was revised once again, and was now identified as \"Earth 2\" (instead of \"Earth Two\" or \"Earth-Two\"). While it still houses a team of superheroes, its membership is younger than before. Earth 2 also has a tragic backstory, having been invaded by a horde of alien invaders from Apokolips five years prior to the reboot, ahead of Darkseid's attempted invasion of Prime Earth. In the process, this reality's Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman all died, while its Supergirl and Robin were swept through a dimensional warp to Prime Earth where they became known as Power Girl and Huntress. == Publication history == === Introduction (\"Flash of Two Worlds\") === The Flash #123 (September 1961). Art by Carmine Infantino and Murphy Anderson. Characters from DC Comics were originally suggestive of each existing in their own world, as superheroes never encountered each other. This was soon changed with alliances being formed between certain protagonists. Several publications, including All Star Comics (publishing tales of the Justice Society of America), Leading Comics (publishing tales of the Seven Soldiers of Victory) and other comic books introduced a \"shared universe\" among several characters during the 1940s. By the 1950s, as the popularity of superheroes was waning, comics shifted to horror, westerns and war. Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman were among the few DC continued to publish. Beginning in the early 1960s, the popularity of superheroes began to grow. DC introduced more modern versions of its heroes. For example, Hawkman was an alien policeman instead of a reincarnated Egyptian prince. Older versions of DC characters were assigned to an \"alternative reality\" Earth that existed within its own fictional \"universe\" and could communicate with the Earth of the current, revised versions of those characters. Alternative-reality Earths had been used in DC stories before, but were usually not referred to after that particular story. Most of these alternative Earths were usually so vastly different that no one would confuse that Earth and its history with the so- called real Earth. That would change when the existence of another reliable Earth was established in a story titled \"Flash of Two Worlds\" in which Barry Allen, the modern Flash later referred to as the Flash of Earth-One (the setting of the Silver Age stories) first travels to another Earth, accidentally vibrating at just the right speed to appear on Earth-Two, where he meets Jay Garrick, his Earth-Two counterpart. He claims Gardner Fox's dreams were tuned into Earth-Two, explaining their depiction as a fictional world in earlier Barry Allen stories. === Expanding the concept: revisiting 40s superheroes === Superman was introduced in the 1930s and was the archetype for the modern superhero, and so is depicted in stories set on Earth-Two as the first major reliable costumed superhero on that world, discounting earlier part-time heroes and \"mystery men\" such as Dr. Occult. Most of the following costumed mystery men history is based on the Earth-Two Superman's initial appearance, where these previously independent operating heroes begin to reliably interact. In order to distinguish him from the later primary version of the character, this Superman was called \"Kal-L\", using the spelling of Superman's Kryptonian name in his early appearances. He was specifically introduced as an Earth-Two character in Justice League of America #73 (1969). Most superheroes from the Golden Age later followed this trend of operating publicly, while wearing distinctive costuming and interacting in a largely shared universe. The primary characters of Superman and Batman still largely worked independent of team environments. In the 1970s, as the now annual team up between the Justice League of America and the Justice Society of America had proven popular, DC published the then present day adventures of the Justice Society in the revived All-Star Comics with issue 58, resuming the numbering from the series original run. The story continued in Adventure Comics #460- 465, which featured the death of the Earth-Two Batman. Mr and Mrs Superman, a feature in Superman Family (1974\u20131982), featured stories of the adventures of married Superman and Lois Lane of Earth-Two. These stories were set at a time in which the Superman of Earth-Two was at a similar age to the then-present-day Superman of Earth-One. In the 1980s, DC published All-Star Squadron which covered the war time history of various superheroes during World War II. Infinity, Inc., a group made up of the children and heirs of the Justice Society, was introduced in All-Star Squadron #25 (September 1983). There was an eponymous comics series starring the group,Manning \"1980s\" in Dolan, p. 207: \"Written by DC's Golden Age guru Roy Thomas and drawn by Jerry Ordway, Infinity, Inc. was released in DC's new deluxe format on bright Baxter paper.\" which ran from March 1984 through June 1988. === Abandonment: Crisis on Infinite Earths === Crisis on Infinite Earths (1985\u20131986) was an effort by DC Comics to clean up their continuity, resulting in the multiple universes combining into one. Since then, a handful of characters originating from Earth-Two have consistently remained part of the merged Earth, including Power Girl, Jay Garrick, and Alan Scott. Superman and Lois Lane from Earth-Two (along with Superboy from Earth Prime, and Alexander Luthor, Jr. from Earth- Three) were transported into a ghost-like \"paradise dimension\" tangential to the new universe. Following the end of the known Multiverse, more alternate realities were discovered. Even though Earth-Three was destroyed in the Anti- Monitor's anti-matter wave attacks, a new Crime Syndicate (called the \"Crime Syndicate of Amerika\") developed in the antimatter universe of Qward, which was very different in background and power base from the pre-Crisis Earth- Three group, though same in the number of members. After the Kingdom event, Hypertime and divergent realities were revealed, but never supposed to be accessed, as stated in the Zero Hour event. They were later revealed when a directly-parallel Flash (Walter West aka the \"Dark Flash\") entered the mainstream DC Universe and threatened to destroy it. These alternate realities are usually addressed as \"Elsewhere\" and \"Elseworld\" stories. === Reviving the Multiverse: Infinite Crisis === thumb Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent, Superboy-Prime, and Alexander Luthor returned during Infinite Crisis. Unknown to Kal-L, Luthor's plan was to resurrect the pre-Crisis Multiverse. He wanted to mix and match elements from each reality to create a \"perfect world\". The fallout of the conflict brought the short-lived return of an Earth-Two copy and the deaths of Kal-L, Lois Lane-Kent and Luthor Jr. of Earth-Two. It is unclear what happened to the aged Diana Trevor, the Earth-Two Wonder Woman, though she faded from her ghostly existence. Inexplicably, Earth-Two was the only returning world that was devoid of most people, except the Justice Society, Kal-L, and his wife Lois Kent. This world was a copy, new and recently manufactured by Alexander Luthor, Jr. of pre-Crisis Earth-Three, instead of resurrected. This copy Earth-Two was recombined with the primary Earth to form the primary DC reality termed as \"New Earth\". ====Post-52 version==== New Earth-2 from 52 Week 52, art breakdowns by Keith Giffen. At the end of the Infinite Crisis limited series, the realigned world is called \"New Earth\". In the final issue of the 52 weekly series, it is revealed that fifty-two duplicate worlds have been created and all but New Earth have been altered from the original incarnation. The post-Crisis Earth-2 made its first appearance in a single panel of 52 Week 52 where it resembled the pre-Crisis Earth-Two, where a newspaper article says that this world's Superman and Power Girl are missing. The Flashes of New Earth (Jay Garrick and Wally West) briefly glimpsed this world with Robin and Huntress in action (during their travel with the Cosmic Treadmill as shown in Justice Society (vol. 3) #11) and Monarch selected Jay Garrick of this Earth (amongst others) in a Multiversal arena tournament. Based on comments by 52 co-writer Grant Morrison, this alternate universe is not the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. This separation between the pre-Crisis Earth-Two and post-Crisis Earth-2 is formally established in Justice Society of America Annual #1 (2008), with a story titled \"Earth 2 Chapter One: Golden Age\", in which the New Earth Power Girl arrives on post- Crisis Earth-2. Thinking that she has returned home to her long destroyed pre- Crisis Earth-Two. Power Girl crash lands and unconscious, on the closest parallel of the 52 Multiverse, the post-Crisis Earth-2, which appears similar to the pre-Crisis Earth-Two. She is found by the post-Crisis Earth-2 Huntress, who thinks she is her long-missing best friend, the Power Girl native to this world. In this new reality, the Justice Society of America has merged with Infinity, Inc. and is now known as Justice Society Infinity. Initially, Power Girl believes she has returned home, until the missing post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl reappears and declares that the other Power Girl is an impostor, and has caused the disappearance of the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman. This turn of events results in the post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl and the Justice Society Infinity to go after the New Earth Power Girl. The Power Girl of New Earth recruits the post-Crisis Earth-2 Michael Holt, who is a physics professor and father and has never become a costumed hero, to help her return to her source Earth. Holt constructs a device similar to the Cosmic treadmill used by Barry Allen to open a portal to New Earth. The Power Girl of New Earth returns home, followed by the Justice Society Infinity, who kidnap her and take her back to post-Crisis Earth-2. During the confrontation, Green Lantern and Jade are initially confused when they see each other, as the post-Crisis Earth-2 Jade's father, Alan Scott, is dead, and New Earth's Jade is dead as well. The JSI interrogate Power Girl for information on the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman's whereabouts. The post-Crisis Earth-2 Power Girl assumes that the Superman the New Earth Power Girl said was dead was the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman (rather than Kal-L who was killed by Superboy-Prime) and that the New Earth Power Girl had killed him. The Justice Society of New Earth arrives to stop her torture. Starman reveals that the re-creation of the Multiverse led to the creation of a Power Girl and Superman native to this new universe, post-Crisis Earth-2 and that the post-Crisis Earth-2 Superman is still alive. The Power Girl of New Earth then returns home along with her Justice Society but with no apology from her counterpart nor from the post- Crisis Earth-2 Huntress for their actions against her. === Earth 2 in \"The New 52\" === In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, the Earth-2 concept has been revived and is covered in two series; Worlds' Finest, which focuses on the adventures of the Huntress and Power Girl on New Earth written by Paul Levitz, and Earth 2, originally written by James Robinson and then by Tom Taylor, which features the formation of the Justice Society. James Robinson, the original writer of Earth 2, describes the new Earth 2 as a complete reboot of the concept, with superheroes only just now appearing, similar to the \"young hero\" concept for the New 52 continuity, and with revamped costume designs. In Earth 2, Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, and Catwoman seemingly gave their lives in order to repel the Apokoliptan invasion, leaving behind a world with no heroes. Supergirl and Robin (Helena Wayne) end up stranded in the mainstream universe towards the end of the invasion. When the Earth-2 Solomon Grundy threatens the world, three new heroes team up to defeat him: the Flash (Jay Garrick), Hawkgirl (Kendra Saunders), and Green Lantern (Alan Scott). In later issues, Mister Terrific (Michael Holt) from the mainstream universe joins the team. Other heroes who have made appearances include Dr. Fate (Khalid Ben-Hassin), the Atom (Al Pratt, now nuclear-powered), the Sandman (Wesley Dodds), Mister Miracle, and Big Barda. Villains include Solomon Grundy, a now-villainous Terry Sloan, Wotan, Steppenwolf and what was thought to be a surviving, Darkseid- brainwashed Superman, which turned out to be a very powerful but genetically unstable Bizarro-type clone. Writer James Robinson left the series with issue #16 and Tom Taylor became the new writer at #17. Other new characters introduced as the series progresses include a female Red Tornado (with the consciousness of Lois Lane), a hyper-intelligent knowledge-assimilator known as Accountable (Jimmy Olsen), a new Batman (Thomas Wayne#Earth-2 using Miraclo), a new version of Aquawoman (Marella), and a new Superman (Val-Zod, a Kryptonian and a childhood friend of Power Girl's who had been imprisoned by Terry Sloan). Towards the end of the series, Darkseid launches a second invasion of Earth, which is depicted in both Earth 2 and the weekly series Earth 2: World's End. Another weekly series, The New 52: Futures End, depicts a possible future in which refugees from a destroyed Earth 2 come to Earth 0 and prompt society to fracture. Over the course of the series, several new characters are introduced, such as Yolanda Montez, an Avatar of the Red who is a counterpart of Alan Scott; a second Red Arrow, an Earth 2 equivalent of Oliver Queen; Ted Grant, a former boxer; and Dick Grayson, a journalist who goes on a mission to find his son after his wife Barbara Gordon is killed during the invasion. Others change alignment; Wonder Woman and Steppenwolf's daughter Fury sides with Mister Miracle and the other heroes after Big Barda reveals her loyalty to Darkseid. Huntress and Power Girl return to Earth 2 as well to take part in a mad scramble to save the Earth and then later, to save its people along with a computerized record of human culture and life on Earth created by Bruce Wayne. In Earth 2: World's End #11, it is revealed that Highfather made a deal with Darkseid that he would not interfere with Darkseid's plans for conquest so long as Darkseid only preyed upon one Earth of the Multiverse, which was Earth 2, explaining the recurrent tragedies faced by this world in comparison to others. In the end, Darkseid is successful, and the Earth is destroyed, and attempts to take Earth 2's refugees to Earth 0 are prevented by a time travelling Tim Drake in Futures End. Just as the world ends, several of the Wonders are sent to the planet Telos by Brainiac, where they confront their counterparts from various parallel worlds, both present and extinct, in the Convergence miniseries. Over the course of the series, Batman dies and Dick Grayson, inspired by his Batman counterparts from other worlds, takes up the mantle from Thomas Wayne. Ultimately, the planet Telos is terraformed into a new Earth-like planet and sent to the Earth 2 dimension as a new home for its refugees. The heroes' fraught attempts at forming a new society, rapidly augmented by Terry Sloan's technology, is depicted in the follow-on series Earth 2: Society (August 2015 \u2013 March 2017). It also debuts versions of Hourman and Mist. The final arc of the series recreates Earth 2 again making it appear similar to their universe's first Earth through use of an Amazon artifact known as Pandora's Casket by Ultra-Humanite. This Earth has had no history of Wonders with Ultra-Humanite controlling the world behind the scenes. Following Ultra-Humanite's defeat, the Wonders becomes the world's new defenders and hopes that this Earth is the Earth they can protect. At the end of Doomsday Clock #12 (2019), Doctor Manhattan reverses the actions that created the \"New 52\" universe, restoring Alan Scott and the Justice Society's original full histories as before Flashpoint, and the original Earth-Two is explained as existing in the multiverse too. == Characters == A number of characters, heroes and villains, had counterparts on both Earth-One and Two. Generally speaking, the older Earth-Two versions were phased out or incorporated into their younger, Earth-One versions following Crisis on Infinite Earths. Several others were rebooted almost entirely, with their new versions having nothing in common with the old ones. For instance, Jim Corrigan of Earth-Two was a murdered police detective who served as the human host for the Spectre, while his Earth-One counterpart was a Metropolis police officer who often assisted Daily Planet cub reporter Jimmy Olsen and superhero Black Lightning. Many characters would often travel from one Earth to the other and interact with its natives or even immigrate. For example, Larry Jordan, the first Air Wave and native of Earth-Two, traveled to Earth-One under yet-unexplained circumstances, married Helen (the second Air Wave) and raised a son, Hal (the third Air Wave). == Unique features == The history of Earth-Two is slightly different from both real world history and the history of other versions of Earth from DC Comics stories. For example, in classic Earth-Two stories, by the 1970s, Quebec is shown to be an independent nation autonomous from Canada. South Africa abolished apartheid sooner than in the real world. The fictional countries of Dukalia, Luxor, Napkan, Nastonia, Oxnalia, Thornia and others existed on the Axis side in WW2 (though most of these disappeared when the US entered the war). Unlike other DC Comics depictions of Atlantis, the Atlantean countries of Poseidonis and Tritonis were ruled by a queen, not a king (along with its inhabitants displaying surface dweller features and no capacity for underwater survival, as the Atlantis continent had been raised). In addition, masked crimefighters are introduced decades earlier than in other universes later identified within DC Comics, and these participated in such historic conflicts as World War II. Franklin Delano Roosevelt founded both the Justice Society of America and the All-Star Squadron. Other events taking place decades earlier include the destruction of Krypton and the advent of advanced technology such as interstellar transportation and time travel. Thousands of years ago, the Guardians of Earth-One's Universe expelled the vast majority of magic from their universe, sending it to Earth-Two. This resulted in a predominance of magic and a weakening of scientific laws within Earth-Two's universe. == Variants == Because Earth-Two as presented did not match up with the actual comics of DC's Golden Age, other alternative Earths were used to explain the discrepancies. Earth-Two-A (also known as Alternate Earth-Two) was where Clark Kent worked for the Daily Planet under editor Parry White in the 1940s and 1950s (on regular Earth-Two Kent worked for the Daily Star, his editor was George Taylor, and Perry White was a reporter). Earth-Two-B (aka Earth-Forty- Six) is a world referenced but not described in the Crisis On Infinite Earths: Absolute Edition. Earth-E (Earth-216) is the world where the Super-Sons adventures happened and was used to explain 1950s Batman and Superman stories that didn't fit with either Earth-One or Earth-Two history. Mark Gruenwald assigned it to the 1951\u20131960 period of those books. == In other media == === Television === * The season 3 episode \"Tempus Anyone?\" in Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, time traveler and author H.G. Wells takes the Lois Lane from Earth-One to a parallel universe Metropolis where there is a Clark Kent, but no Superman. Here, she inspires him to become the Man of Steel to that world. She also runs into familiar faces in unfamiliar roles: Jimmy Olsen is now James Olsen, owner of the Daily Planet; Perry White is running for Mayor; Clark Kent is engaged to High School sweetheart Lana Lang (who is keeping him from using his powers); she also realizes that the Lois Lane of that world died a few years earlier when she came upon her tombstone. Needless to say, by the end of the episode, Earth-Two Clark Kent embraces his destiny as Superman, but loses his identity as Clark. Earth-Two Clark later arrives in Earth-One during the season 4 episode \"Lois and Clarks\". This occurs after another encounter with Tempus that has the Earth-One Man of Tomorrow locked away in a moment of time that threatens to erase him from existence. * The Earth-Two of the Smallville series appears in Season Ten episode \"Luthor\". Resembling the Post Crisis Earth-3, this Earth-2 is a dark offshoot-universe where Clark was found and raised by Lionel Luthor instead of Martha and Jonathan Kent and helped him take control of the world by creating an alternative non costumed identity known as Ultraman. This reality works as a mirror world where the counterparts are totally different from those that exist in the Earth-1 (such as Oliver Queen not being Green Arrow but instead Lois' disgruntled fianc\u00e9e, and an angry Jonathan Kent farming his home for gold meteor rock to buy back his home). The only known way to access it is through the Kryptonian Mirror box, but Lionel escaped to Earth-1 to resume his dead counterpart's position as Luthorcorp, while Clark destroyed the box. Clark Luthor reappears in \"Kent\" where his Mirror box makes an appearance sending Clark to Earth-2, but destroyed it, seeking asylum in Earth-1 as everyone knows how to kill him and sees Tess Mercer as an ally. With the help of Emil Hamilton repairing the Earth-2 box, he and Tess used it to bring back Clark. * Another version of Earth-Two appears in the TV series set in the Arrowverse: ** Earth-Two is first featured in season 2 of The Flash, though originally as an analogue of the comic books' Earth-3. While possessing similarities to the 'Prime' Earth, this Earth-Two had several marked differences. The architecture, clothing fashions, and entertainment outlets were mixtures of contemporary 21st century and 1940s styles. Furthermore, certain areas of science and technology were far more advanced than on Earth- One. In addition, people in this Earth-Two are typically opposite in personality and circumstances compared to their Earth-One doppelgangers. For instance, Caitlin Snow on Earth-One originally didn't possess the metahuman gene and is a kind, soft-spoken person whereas her Earth-Two counterpart is an amoral criminal named Killer Frost who has ice-generating powers. Iris West Allen is not a reporter on this world; instead, she is a police detective whose father, Joe West, (a cop on Earth-One) is a nightclub singer (this aspect is similar to that depicted on the Earth shown in JLA: Earth 2). Other Earth-2 counterparts involve Barry Allen as a CSI operative, Cisco Ramon as Zoom's enforcer Reverb, Ronnie Raymond as Killer Frost's husband Deathstorm who never takes Martin Stein's advice, Robert Queen as the Hood after Oliver died in the Queen's Gambit shipwreck, Henry and Nora Allen living a happy life, Linda Park operating as Doctor Light, Leonard Snart being the Mayor of Central City, David Singh as a criminal, Quentin Lance is dead, Laurel Lance as Zoom's lieutenant Black Siren, and Dante Ramon as the supervillain Rupture. The two Earths were originally connected through a wormhole created by Eobard Thawne/\"Harrison Wells\" (the Prime Earth Reverse-Flash) in the season 1 finale; demonstrated by the appearance of the Earth-Two Flash's helmet. When the singularity is finally collapsed, the explosion opens 52 breaches throughout Central City that allow passage between the two worlds, though only by speedsters or through technological means. Doppelgangers from Earth-Two begin appearing on Earth-One after being forcibly brought by Zoom, a criminal speedster. Zoom directs metahumans such as Atom-Smasher, King Shark, Sand Demon, and other such followers into killing the Earth-One Flash or be stranded on Earth-One forever. Jay Garrick and the Harrison Wells of Earth-Two arrive separately to help Team Flash with the criminal metahumans and to defeat Zoom. ** Earth-Two of The Flash is referred to in the Supergirl crossover episode \"Worlds Finest\". As Barry is explaining the multiverse to Kara and her friends, Winn asks about a possible Earth \"where all of us are evil\". Barry replies \"Been there. It sucks\", referring to the Earth-Two he has visited (\"Welcome to Earth-2\" and \"Escape from Earth-2\"). ** In season 6 of Arrow (from which The Flash spun out of), Black Siren resurfaced and allied with criminals Cayden James and Ricardo Diaz before defecting to Green Arrow's side. In the episode \"Starling City,\" it is revealed that Moira Queen is remarried to Malcolm Merlyn, Thea Queen died from an overdose of the Vertigo drug, Tommy Merlyn operated as Dark Archer, Dinah Drake is a police sergeant who is on Tommy's side, Rene Ramirez is Malcolm Merlyn's head of security who is also on Tommy's side, Adrian Chase is now the Hood, and a variation of Bruce Wayne existed here. However, Earth-Two is destroyed as part of a lead-up to the Arrowverse's take on the DC comics event Crisis on Infinite Earths. ** In the epilogue of Crisis on Infinite Earths following the multiverse's rebirth, a new Earth-Two was created in place of the previous Earth-Two. This Earth-Two has the events of the TV series Stargirl taking place within it. === Video games === * An Earth 2 skin pack was released as downloadable content for Injustice: Gods Among Us. It included alternate skins for the Flash, Hawkgirl, and Solomon Grundy based on the appearances of Jay Garrick, Kendra Saunders and Grundy in New 52. * A pre-order skin pack for Batman: Arkham Origins video game includes two Earth 2 skins for Batman, both based on the New 52. One depicts the original Batman Bruce Wayne and the other depicting the new black-and-red Batman Thomas Wayne. == References == == External links == * * *Earth 2 at Mike's Amazing World of Comics Category:1961 in comics Category:DC Comics dimensions Category:DC Comics planets Two ",
