She was his only child. Following his death in 1543, she was taken under the care of her grandmother and moved to Istanbul. Like her cousin Ay\u015fe H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan, she was reportedly beloved by their grandfather, with whom she kept correspondence. H\u00fcma\u015fah, her cousin, and her aunt Mihrimah Sultan would all imitate the communication style ushered in by her grandmother Hurrem, whose letters to the Sultan are known for their colourfulness, charm, and smoothness. She is regarded by historian Mustafa \u00c7a\u011fatay Ulu\u00e7ay as amongst the most influential women of Suleiman's reign. It was she who, in 1563, gifted her cousin \u015eehzade Murad (future Sultan Murad III) with a concubine that would go on to be Safiye Sultan. In 1566, H\u00fcma\u015fah Sultan married Ferhad Pasha, when he was serving as the third vizier. He had previously been second Kap\u0131c\u0131ba\u015f\u0131. In 1553, he became the Agha of the Janissaries. In 1557-8, he was made the governor of Kastamonu Sanjak, and in 1564, he was made the third vizier, before he married H\u00fcma\u015fah. Their palace was located in the precincts of the Old Palace. She was widowed at his death on 6 February 1575. Six months after the death of Ferhad Pasha, H\u00fcma\u015fah married Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha. She was widowed at his death on 7 August 1580. After his death, H\u00fcma\u015fah married the governor of Shahrizor Eyalet, Mehmed Pasha, the brother of the grand vizier Damat Ibrahim Pasha. He died in August 1592. ==Burial== Upon her death, she was buried alongside her father and uncle, \u015eehzade Cihangir, in \u015eehzade Mosque. ==Issue== The princess' marriage to Ferhad Pasha produced four sons and two daughters, including: *Sultanzade Hasan Bey; *Sultanzade Mustafa Pasha; *Sultanzade Osman Bey; *Sultanzade Ibrahim Pasha; *Fatma Sultan; *Hatice Sultan; With Lala Kara Mustafa Pasha, she had one son: *Sultanzade Abd\u00fclbaki Bey; ==Annotations== ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * * * Category:Ottoman dynasty Category:1540s births Category:16th-century Ottoman royalty Category:16th-century women of the Ottoman Empire Category:People from Manisa ",
