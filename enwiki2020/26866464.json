In 1452, Bernard was elected at the request of the Bishop of Hildesheim to be his coadjutor and later became his successor when the bishop died. However, the bishop's aspiration that in selecting a Welf the bishopric would strengthen its position vis-a-vis the Welf Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel proved elusive because Bernard felt obliged to support the interests of his family first. At the request of his father, he left the bishopric in 1457 to take over the Principality of L\u00fcneburg, which he ruled jointly with his brother, Otto the Victorious, until his death on 9 Feb 1464.Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie He married Matilda of Holstein-Schauenburg, daughter of Otto II, Count of Schauenburg-Pinneberg, in 1463, but the marriage was childless. Matilda went on to be the second wife of William the Victorious, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg. == Ancestors == == See also == * Duchy of Brunswick- L\u00fcneburg * Principality of L\u00fcneburg * Prince-Bishopric of Hildesheim == References == == Sources == * Die Di\u00f6zese Hildesheim.
