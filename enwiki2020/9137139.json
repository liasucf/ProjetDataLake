The Law Union provides for an alternative bar in Ontario which seeks to counter the traditional protections afforded by the legal system to social, political and economic privilege. By demystifying legal procedures, attacking discriminatory and oppressive legislation, arguing progressive new applications of the law, and democratizing legal practice, the Law Union strives to develop collective approaches to bring about social justice. ==External links== *Law Union of Ontario *Jur-Ed Foundation ==See also== *Clayton Ruby *Paul Copeland *National Lawyers Guild Category:Ontario law Category:Organizations based in Ontario * Category:Progressivism in Canada Category:Organizations based in Toronto Category:Human rights organizations based in Canada Category:Civil rights organizations in Canada Category:Legal advocacy organizations based in Canada ",
