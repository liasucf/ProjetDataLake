    "text": "The Apidima Cave (, Spilaio Apidima) is a complex of four small caves located on the western shore of Mani Peninsula in southern Greece. A systematic investigation of the cave has yielded Neanderthal and Homo sapiens fossils from the Palaeolithic era.Apidima Cave. Accessed on 10 July 2019. One skull fossil, given the name Apidima 1, shows a mixture of modern human and primitive features and has been dated to be more than 210,000 years old, older than a Neanderthal skull (\"Apidima 2\") found at the cave, which makes Apidima 1 the oldest proof of Homo sapiens living outside Africa,Earliest modern human found outside Africa. BBC News. 10 July 2019. the second oldest being the maxilla from Misliya cave, Mount Carmel, Israel, with a maximum age of about 190,000 years ago. Apidima 1 is more than 150,000 years older than previous H. sapiens finds in Europe. ==Description== The Apidima Cave complex consists of karstic caves formed in the limestone cliffside on the west shore of the Mani Peninsula in southern Greece. Today the caves open on the face of a large sea cliff and are only accessible by boat,Signals of Evolution in the Territory of Greece. Paleoanthropological Findings. Christos Valsamis. Intensive Course in Biological Anthropology. 1st Summer School of the European Anthropological Association. 16\u201330 June 2007, Prague, Czech Republic. but during the ice ages the sea level went lower by more than , and several seashore caves around the world, today submerged or situated at the wave zone\u2014Apidima Cave belonging to the latter category\u2014rose well above the water surface and were occupied by early people. The complex consists of four small caves, designated \"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and \"D\". It was formed by erosion within the Middle Triassic to Late Eocene limestone of depth , from above sea level, in a vertical zone of depth . The development of the caves is due to the vertical strikes of the limestone, while the horizontal opening is made by the sea. ==Archaeology== ===Research programme=== The scientific research programme at Apidima began in 1978 and is being conducted by the National Archaeological Museum of Greece in collaboration with the Laboratory of Historical Geology-Palaeontology of Athens University, the Institute of Geology and Mineral Exploitation and the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. ===Findings=== Approximately 20,000 bones, bone fragments, and teeth from various fauna have been collected since 1978 from this site by Theodore Pitsios and his team. There are a few animal specimens with probable traces of butchering. The two Homo fossils were excavated from the thick and cohesive breccia above sea level. ===Homo fossils=== Researchers uncovered two significant fossils in Apidima Cave \"A\" in 1978. The two fossils are now referred to as Apidima 1 and Apidima 2. Stone tools were found in all four caves. Research published in July 2019 indicates that the Apidima 2 skull fragment (designated LAO 1/S2) has Neanderthal morphology, and using uranium-thorium dating, was found to be more than 170,000 years old. The Apidima 1 skull fossil (designated LAO 1/S1) was found to be older, dated\u2014using the same method\u2014to more than 210,000 years old, and presents a mixture of modern human and primitive features. This makes Apidima 1 the oldest evidence of Homo sapiens outside Africa,Some Apidima Skull Is Earliest Homo Sapiens Outside Africa, Say Researchers. Gemma Tarlach, Discover. July 10, 2019. more than 150,000 years older than previous H. sapiens finds in Europe. The lead researcher, Katerina Harvati, summarized, \"Our results suggest that at least two groups of people lived in the Middle Pleistocene in what is now southern Greece: an early Homo sapiens population, followed by a Neanderthal population.\" Harvati said that the team would attempt to extract ancient DNA from the fossils, but that she was not optimistic about finding any. If sufficient specimens can be obtained, a palaeoproteomic analysis of ancient proteins may also be done on the fossils. ==See also== * Early human migrations * List of human evolution fossils * Misliya cave * Prehistory of Southeastern Europe ==References== ==External links== *Apidima Cave in Mani *Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology *Human Timeline (Interactive) \u2013 Smithsonian, National Museum of Natural History (August 2016).
