    "text": "Lisa Black is a sculpture artist and jeweler based in Auckland, New Zealand. Her work often combines taxidermied animals and preserved insects with found metal and sometimes working mechanical parts, and has been described as \"Steampunk\" art, although she does not use the term herself. She self categorizes her work by adding \"Fixed\" to the titles of her pieces made to look living, and \"Departed\" to the pieces made to look deceased. The first work in the Fixed series was Fixed Fawn. Her work has been featured in Marie Claire Magazine, The New Zealand Herald, and the television show New Zealand's Next Top Model. ==Taxidermy Works== ===Fixed Series=== A series of sculptures using Taxidermied animals and metal parts from different eras. *Fixed Mammals, including Fixed Fawn, Fixed Golden Fawn, Fixed Ferret and Fixed Rat.Fixed Mammals by Lisa Black *Fixed Reptiles, including Fixed Crocodile and Fixed Turtle.Fixed Reptiles by Lisa Black *Fixed Birds, including Fixed Duckling Head and Fixed Black Bird.Fixed Birds by Lisa Black *Fixed Pheasant Wings, a taxidermy work not part of the other series.Fixed Pheasant Wings by Lisa Black ===Departed Series=== A series of sculptures using the taxidermied skulls of animals and metal parts.Departed Skulls by Lisa Black *Departed Vervet, Departed Vervet II, Departed Vervet III, Departed Vervet IV, Departed Vervet V *Departed Caracal *Departed Baboon *Departed Wildcat *Departed Ram ==Jewelry== *Gilded Butterflies necklacesGilded Butterfly Necklaces by Lisa Black ==Selected exhibitions== * 2012 'Rogue Taxidermy', La Luz de Jesus Gallery Hollywood, California * 2011 Museo Civico di Zoologia Rome, Italy * 2011 STRYCHNIN Gallery Berlin, Germany * 2011 Simon James Design, Auckland, New Zealand * 2010 Century Guild Gallery/San Diego Comic-Con International, San Diego, USA * 2009 Century Guild Gallery/San Diego Comic-Con International, San Diego, USA * 2009 'Creature Discomforts', The Suter Gallery, Nelson, New Zealand * 2008 Satellite Gallery, Auckland, New Zealand ==References== ==External links== * * YouBentMyWookie.com Interview \"Lisa Black: Finding Art In The Death of The Cute and Furry\" * Gizmodo.com * Creepy Steampunk Animals Put the \u201cErm?\u201d in Taxidermy, Wired.com Category:Steampunk Category:1982 births Category:Living people Category:20th-century New Zealand women artists Category:21st-century New Zealand women artists Category:20th-century New Zealand sculptors Category:21st-century New Zealand sculptors ",
