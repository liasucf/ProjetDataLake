    "text": "The Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente (1534\u20131709) was a land grant and colonial administration in the far southern part of the colonial Portuguese Empire in Colonial Brazil. ==History== In 1534 King John III of Portugal granted the Captaincy to Martim Afonso de Sousa, a Portuguese admiral. Sousa had founded the first two permanent Portuguese settlements in Brazil in 1532: S\u00e3o Vicente (near the present port of Santos) and Piratininga (later to become S\u00e3o Paulo). Martim Afonso received two tracts of land: * one centered on the settlement of S\u00e3o Vicente, extending along the coastline from Cananeia to Bertioga (within present-day S\u00e3o Paulo state) * the other extended from Parati to Cabo Frio (within present-day Rio de Janeiro state). Although divided into two lots - separated by the Captaincy of Santo Amaro - together these territories formed the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente. In 1681 the S\u00e3o Paulo settlement succeeded S\u00e3o Vicente as the capital of the captaincy, and the original name of the latter gradually fell into disuse. S\u00e3o Vicente became the only captaincy to flourish in southern Portuguese colony of Brazil. It ultimately gave rise to S\u00e3o Paulo state and provided the base for the Bandeiras to expand Portuguese America to the west of the Tordesilhas Line. ===Territorial evolution of the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente (1534\u20131709)=== The Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente in Southern Brazil: Image:Brazil in 1534.svg|1534 Capitanias heredit\u00e1rias - the two bottommost yellow stripes denote the Captaincy of S\u00e3o Vicente Image:Brazil (1709).svg|1709 S\u00e3o Paulo at its greatest extent, in pale yellow ==See also== * * ==References== ===Cited texts=== * Lockhart, J.(1983), Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil.
