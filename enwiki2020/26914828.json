Ireland, para. 8-11 ==Judgment== The Court held that: *there has been a breach of Article 6 para. 1 (fair trial) of the European Convention on Human Rights, by 5 votes to 2; *there has been a breach of Article 8 (private and family life), by 4 votes to 3; *it was not necessary also to examine the case under Article 14 (non-discrimination) taken in conjunction with Article 6 para. 1, by 4 votes to 3; *it was not necessary also to examine the case under Article 13 (effective remedy), by 4 votes to 3.
