    "text": "Emerald Peak is a mountain summit located in Yoho National Park, in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia, Canada. Its nearest higher peak is Mount Carnarvon, to the northwest. Both are part of the President Range which is a subset of the Waputik Mountains. Emerald Peak is visible from Emerald Lake, rising above the northwest shore. The mountain's name was officially adopted in 1924 when approved by the Geographical Names Board of Canada, in association with Emerald Lake, which in turn was named in 1900 on account of its color. __NOTOC__ ==Geology== Emerald Peak is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Cambrian period. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny. ==Climate== Based on the K\u00f6ppen climate classification, Emerald Peak is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below \u221220 \u00b0C with wind chill factors below \u221230 \u00b0C. Precipitation runoff from Emerald Peak drains into the Emerald River, which is a tributary of the Kicking Horse River. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing Emerald Peak. ==See also== *Geography of British Columbia ==References== ==External links== * Weather: Emerald Peak *Parks Canada web site: Yoho National Park *Emerald Peak climbing photos: On-Top Category:Mountains of British Columbia Category:Canadian Rockies Category:Yoho National Park ",
