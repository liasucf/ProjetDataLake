Conchology is one aspect of malacology, the study of molluscs; however, malacology is the study of molluscs as whole organisms, whereas conchology is confined to the study of their shells. It includes the study of land and freshwater mollusc shells as well as seashells and extends to the study of a gastropod's operculum. Conchology is now sometimes seen as an archaic study, because relying on only one aspect of an organism's morphology can be misleading. However, a shell often gives at least some insight into molluscan taxonomy, and historically the shell was often the only part of exotic species that was available for study. Even in current museum collections it is common for the dry material (shells) to greatly exceed the amount of material that is preserved whole in alcohol. Conchologists mainly deal with four molluscan orders: the gastropods (snails), bivalves (clams), Polyplacophora (chitons) and Scaphopoda (tusk shells). Cephalopods only have small internal shells, with the exception of the Nautiloidea. Some groups, such as the sea slug nudibranchs, have lost their shells altogether, while in others it has been replaced by a protein support structure. == Versus shell collecting == A vendor in Tanzania with a variety of large seashells for sale The terms shell collector and conchologist can be regarded as two distinct categories. Not all shell collectors are conchologists; some are primarily concerned with the aesthetic value of shells instead of their scientific study. It is also true that not all conchologists are shell collectors; this type of research only requires access to private or institutional shell collections. There is some debate in the conchological community, with some people regarding all shell collectors (regardless of motivation) as conchologists. == History == Molluscs have probably been used by primates as a food source long before humans evolved. The Asturian culture of the European Mesolithic, in modern north Spain, is one of many coastal archaeological cultures around the world characterized by the creation of very large shell-middens or waste-heaps. The extremely large Whaleback Shell Midden appears to have been created over a period of 1,000 years or more. Shell collecting, the precursor of conchology, probably goes back as far as there have been humans living near beaches. Stone Age seashell necklaces have been found, sometimes in areas far from the ocean, indicating that they were traded. Shell jewellery is found at almost all archaeological sites, including at ancient Aztec ruins, digs in ancient China, and the Indus Valley. Sea shells from Recreatione dell'occhio e della mente by Filippo Bonanni During the Renaissance people began taking interest in natural objects of beauty to put in cabinets of curiosities. Because of their attractiveness, variety, durability and ubiquity, shells became a large part of these collections. Towards the end of the 17th century, people began looking at shells with scientific interest. In 1681 the two-volume shell atlas Ricreazione dell'occhio et della mente nell'osservazione delle chiocciole was published in Rome by the Jesuit priest Filippo Bonanni (1638\u20131725). This was the first treatise entirely devoted to molluscs. Martin Lister in 1685\u20131692 published Historia Conchyliorum, which was the first comprehensive conchological text, having over 1000 engraved plates. A plate from Lister's book, showing what he calls buccinis shells George Rumpf, or Rumphius (1627\u20131702) published the first mollusc taxonomy. He suggested \"single shelled ones\" (Polyplacophora, limpets, and abalone), \"snails or whelks\" (Gastropoda), and \"two-shelled ones\" (Bivalvia). Many of Rumpf's terms were adopted by Carl Linnaeus. Rumpf continued to do important scientific work after he went blind, working by touch. The study of zoology, including conchology, was revolutionized by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus and his system of binomial nomenclature. 683 of the 4000 or so animal species he described are now considered to be molluscs, although Linnaeus placed them in several phyla at the time. The English word \"conchology\" was coined in the 1770s by the British Sephardi naturalist Emanuel Mendez da Costa, who published The Elements of Conchology: or, an Introduction to the Knowledge of Shells in London in 1776. There have been many prominent conchologists in the past two centuries. The Sowerby family were famous collectors, dealers, and illustrators. John Mawe (1764\u20131829) produced arguably the first conchology guidebook, The Voyager's Companion or Shell-Collector's Pilot as well as The Linn\u00e6an System of Conchology. Hugh Cuming (1791\u20131865) is famous for his huge collection and numerous discoveries of new species. Thomas Say wrote the fundamental work American Conchology, or Descriptions of the Shells of North America, Illustrated From Coloured Figures From Original Drawings, Executed from Nature in six volumes (1830\u20131834). R. Tucker Abbott was the most prominent conchologist of the 20th century. He authored dozens of books and was museum director of the Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum, bringing the world of seashells to the public. His most prominent works are American Seashells, Seashells of the World, and The Kingdom of the Seashell. Many of the finest collections of seashells are private. John DuPont and Jack Lightbourne are known for their extensive collections. John DuPont donated his shell collection to the Delaware Museum of Natural History in 1984. Emperor Hirohito of Japan also amassed a huge collection, and was a competent and respected amateur conchologist. == Museums == Many museums worldwide contain very large and scientifically important mollusc collections. However, in most cases these are research collections, behind the scenes of the museum, and thus not readily accessible to the general public in the same way that exhibits are. The largest assemblage of mollusc shells is housed at the Smithsonian Institution, which has c. 1 million lots representing perhaps 50,000 species. === US === * Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia * American Museum of Natural History, New York City * Bailey-Matthews Shell Museum in Sanibel Island, Florida: the only museum in the world dedicated entirely to shells. * Charleston Marine Life Center, Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in Charleston Oregon * Denver Museum of Nature & Science, Denver, Colorado: approximately 17,500 shell lots. * Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard, Massachusetts * National Museum of Natural History, Washington D.C. \u2013 The Smithsonian has c. 1 million lots, the largest worldwide === Europe === * Austria, Vienna \u2013 Naturhistorisches Museum * Belgium, Brussels \u2013 Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, one of the three largest collections * France, Paris \u2013 Mus\u00e9um national d'Histoire naturelle 900,000 lots, 5 million specimens * Germany ** Frankfurt \u2013 Naturmuseum Senckenberg, 700,000 lots (33,000 living taxa, 12,000 fossil taxa) ** Berlin \u2013 Berlin's Natural History Museum * Netherlands, Leiden \u2013 Natural History Museum, Leiden * Sweden, Stockholm \u2013 Swedish Museum of Natural History * United Kingdom ** London \u2013 Natural History Museum 8 million specimens, 60,000 type specimens ** Cardiff \u2013 National Museum Cardiff, second largest UK collection, over 2 million specimens ** Manchester \u2013 Manchester Museum, fourth largest UK collection; 166,000 lots. ** Cambridge \u2013 Cambridge University Museum of Zoology, over 100,000 lots == Organizations == Like other scientific fields, conchologists have a number of local, national, and international organizations. There are also many organizations specializing in specific subareas. * Association Fran\u00e7aise de Conchyliologie *Belgian Society for Conchology *Club Conchylia, the German/Austrian Society for Shell Collecting *Conchological Society of Great Britain and Ireland *Conchologists of Americaconchologistsofamerica.org *Conquiliologistas do Brasil *Nederlandse Malacologische Verenigingspirula.nl *Unitas Malacologica == Fake shells == Shell collectors who purchase shells from dealers may sometimes encounter shells which have been altered to represent new species or rare color varieties. It is claimed that in previous centuries, fake examples of Epitonium scalare were created out of rice paste.Abbott, R. Tucker. Seashells of the world a guide to the better-known species.

Shells have also been featured on many coins, including the Bahamian dollar (1974), the Cuban peso (1981), the Haitian gourde (1973), the Nepalese rupee (1989) and Philippine peso (1993). ==See also== *:Category:Conchologists == References == == Sources == * National Geographic Magazine, March 1969, \"The Magic Lure of Sea Shells\", Paul A.
