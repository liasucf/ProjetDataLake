    "text": "The 1960 Oakland Raiders season was the inaugural one for the franchise and for the American Football League (AFL). Head coach Eddie Erdelatz led the team to a 6\u20138 finish, third out of four teams in the Western Division. ==Offseason== The Raiders were the last of the AFL's original eight teams to be accepted into the new league. As a result of the Minnesota franchise's defection to the NFL, Oakland was awarded the eighth AFL franchise on January 30, 1960. It was not until February 9 that the team named its first head coach, Eddie Erdelatz. Erdelatz, who had most recently coached the football team at Texas A&M; University, had success as head coach of the United States Naval Academy during the 1950s. When the University of California refused to let the Raiders play home games at Memorial Stadium in Berkeley, they chose Kezar Stadium (also home to the NFL's 49ers) in San Francisco as their home field. ===1960 AFL draft=== The Raiders inherited the draft picks of the Minneapolis franchise. Among the most notable picks was center Jim Otto, who would be a fixture at the position for 15 years and was selected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1980. ==Team leaders== ;Passing Tom Flores \u2013 1,738 yds., 12 TD, 12 INT, 71.8 rating ;Rushing Tony Teresa \u2013 139 att., 608 yds., 6 TD ;Receiving Billy Lott \u2013 49 rec., 524 yds., 1 TD ==Regular season== Over the course of a fourteen-game regular season schedule, the Raiders faced each of the other seven AFL teams twice. The AFL had no playoff rounds, only a championship game between the league's two division winners, so Oakland's third-place finish was not enough to qualify. ==Season schedule== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- !style=\"\"| Week !style=\"\"| Date !style=\"\"| Opponent !style=\"\"| Result !style=\"\"| Record !style=\"\"| Venue !style=\"\"| Attendance !style=\"\"| Game Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 1 | September 11 | Houston Oilers | L 22\u201337 | 0\u20131 | Kezar Stadium | 12,703 | Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 2 | September 16 | Dallas Texans | L 16\u201334 | 0\u20132 | Kezar Stadium | 8,021 | Recap |- style=\"background:#cfc\" ! 3 | September 25 | at Houston Oilers | W 14\u201313 | 1\u20132 | Jeppesen Stadium | 12,241 | Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 4 | October 2 | at Denver Broncos | L 14\u201331 | 1\u20133 | Bears Stadium | 18,372 | Recap |- style=\"background:#cfc\" ! 5 | October 9 | at Dallas Texans | W 20\u201319 | 2\u20133 | Cotton Bowl | 21,000 | Recap |- style=\"background:#cfc\" ! 6 | October 16 | Boston Patriots | W 27\u201314 | 3\u20133 | Kezar Stadium | 11,500 | Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 7 | October 23 | at Buffalo Bills | L 9\u201338 | 3\u20134 | War Memorial Stadium | 8,876 | Recap |- style=\"background:#cfc\" ! 8 | October 28 | at New York Titans | W 28\u201327 | 4\u20134 | Polo Grounds | 10,000 | Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 9 | November 4 | at Boston Patriots | L 28\u201334 | 5\u20134 | Boston University Field | 8,446 | Recap |- style=\"background:#cfc\" ! 10 | November 13 | Buffalo Bills | W 20\u20137 | 5\u20135 | Kezar Stadium | 8,800 | Recap |- ! 11 | colspan=\"7\" align=\"center\"| Bye |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 12 | November 27 | at Los Angeles Chargers | L 28\u201352 | 5\u20136 | Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum | 15,075 | Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 13 | December 4 | Los Angeles Chargers | L 17\u201341 | 5\u20137 | Candlestick Park | 12,061 | Recap |- style=\"background:#fcc\" ! 14 | December 11 | New York Titans | L 28\u201331 | 5\u20138 | Candlestick Park | 9,037 | Recap |- style=\"background:#cfc\" ! 15 | December 17 | Denver Broncos | W 48\u201310 | 6\u20138 | Candlestick Park | 5,159 | Recap |} Note: Intra-division opponents are in bold text. ===Final standings=== ==Game summaries== ===Week 1: vs. Houston Oilers=== The Raiders' first-ever regular season game was played on September 11, 1960, at home against the Houston Oilers.
