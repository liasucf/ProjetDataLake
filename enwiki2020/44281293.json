    "text": "Orthot\u0113s onomat\u014dn is a Platonic theory that investigates the correct usage of words and names. The most common texts orthotes onomaton appears in are Plato's works Cratylus, Protagoras, and the Republic. In these, he criticizes the Sophists, namely Prodicus and Protagoras, for their misused language. Plato, Prodicus, and Protagoras stemmed from the same literary history of Ancient Greece; therefore, this issue of who is saying what correctly is innovative for the point in time that these texts were created. Plato\u2019s concern with the sophists' usage was that their words and phrases gave misleading impressions about reality and that, as highly revered intellectuals, the sophists should have utilized the most fitting descriptive words possible. He depicts these two in different lights. Prodicus\u2019 concern with orthot\u0113s onomat\u014dn appears to be a problem with correctness, with terms that are very similar in meaning and relation but have different senses. \u201cIn Protagoras, for example, Prodicus is said to distinguish between the terms \u201cimpartial\u201d and \u201cundecided\u201d; \u201cdebate\u201d and \u201cdispute\u201d; \u201cesteem\u201d and \u201cpraise\u201d; \u201cenjoyment\u201d and \u201cpleasure\u201d; and \u201cwill\u201d and \u201cdesire\u201d.[The Ancient Quarrel Between Philosophy and Poetry Revisited: Plato and the Greek Literary Tradition] Plato depicts Protagoras as using distinctions between grander meanings and word genders. \u201cProtagoras is alleged to have faulted Homer for opening the Iliad with a command when the poet thought he was uttering a prayer.\u201d[The Ancient Quarrel Between Philosophy and Poetry Revisited: Plato and the Greek Literary Tradition] Considering that the sophists were widely accepted as intellectuals of the time, Plato\u2019s criticisms of these sophists and their word usage, along with his criticisms of deific terms, were rejected.XKCD ==References== Category:Greek words and phrases Category:History of linguistics Category:Lexical semantics ",
