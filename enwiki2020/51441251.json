    "text": "The Intercontinental GT Challenge is a sports car racing series developed by the SRO Group in 2016. It consists of international endurance races for grand tourer racing cars complying with the FIA's GT3 regulations. ==Format== The series is aimed at manufacturers. Instead of fielding their own cars, manufacturers can appoint and support local teams in selected events to gain points. Four manufacturers took part in the inaugural series in 2016: Audi, Bentley, McLaren and Mercedes. The races may be stand-alone events (like the Suzuka 10 Hours or the Bathurst 12 Hour) or part of another championship (like the 24 Hours of Spa) but they are all contested by cars complying with the same technical regulations. ==Champions== The title is awarded to the manufacturer with the highest points tally. A manufacturer can enter up to four cars in any event but only receives points for its two highest placed cars. Drivers\u2019 titles are awarded in the Pro category and the Am category for drivers that a rated bronze by the FIA's ranking system. ===Manufacturers' championship=== {| class=\"wikitable\" ! Year !
