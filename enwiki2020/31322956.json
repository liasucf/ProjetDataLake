    "text": "The Mundialito de Clubes () is an international club beach soccer competition contested between top men's clubs from across the world. The tournament is loosely similar to the FIFA Club World Cup in association football, however participating teams are not regional champions, instead entering via invitation. Organised by Beach Soccer Worldwide (BSWW), the competition was founded by BSWW with Brazilian sports agency Koch Tavares in 2011.Founding The first five editions hosted in Brazil whilst the sixth saw the event hosted in Europe; the tournament should not be confused with BSWW's existing Mundialito, which takes place in Portugal for national teams. Russian side Lokomotiv Moscow are the most successful team with two titles.Moscow 2 titles ==Teams and players== In the first two editions (2011 and 2012), squads were specially assembled to represent well known association football clubs from around the world \u2013 these teams were incarnated purely to compete in this event.Representative clubs Players of many nationalities (of which they were considered the best of) were invited to play; they were then allocated to one of the clubs specifically for the purpose of the event using a draft system conducted by BSWW.Draft The draft system was then retired. In the next two editions (2013 and 2015), the clubs and their squads that competed either already exist beforehand (i.e. competed in a domestic club league in their country) or remained specially assembled purely for the competition, but now with squads materialised behind the scenes with players choosing to play for said team at their own discretion rather than via a draft. Since 2017, all competing teams have been pre-existing clubs that compete in their country's domestic league. Teams are no longer materialised specifically for this event. ==Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%; width: 100%; text- align: center;\" |- !rowspan=2 width=5%|Year !rowspan=2 width=10%|Host ! rowspan=\"2\" width=\"4%\" | Teams !width=1% rowspan=10 bgcolor=ffffff| !colspan=3|Final !width=1% rowspan=10 bgcolor=ffffff| !colspan=3|Third Place Match |- !width=15%|Winners !width=8%|Score !width=15%|Runners-up !width=15%|3rd place !width=8%|Score !width=15%|4th place |- |2011 Details | S\u00e3o Paulo |10 | Vasco da Gama |4\u20132 | Sporting CP | Flamengo |5\u20134 (a.e.t.) | Lokomotiv Moscow |- bgcolor=#D0E7FF |2012 Details | S\u00e3o Paulo |12 | Lokomotiv Moscow |6\u20134 | Flamengo | Vasco da Gama |5\u20134 | Sporting CP |- |2013 Details | Rio de Janeiro |8 | Corinthians |3\u20133 (a.e.t.) 1\u20130 (pens) | Flamengo | Vasco da Gama |3\u20131 | Botafogo |- bgcolor=#D0E7FF |2015 Details | Rio de Janeiro |8 | Barcelona |4\u20134 (a.e.t.) 3\u20132 (pens) | Vasco da Gama | Al-Ahli |4\u20134 (a.e.t.) 3\u20132 (pens) | Fluminense |- |2017 Details | S\u00e3o Paulo |8 | Lokomotiv Moscow |5\u20134 | Pars Jonoubi | Corinthians |3\u20132 | Flamengo |- bgcolor=#D0E7FF |2019 Details | Moscow |8 | Braga |7\u20136 | Catania | Flamengo |4\u20133 | Spartak Moscow |- |2020 Details | MoscowMundialito de Clubes Moscow 2020.
