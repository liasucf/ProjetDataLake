    "text": "Comrades and Strangers is the memoir of Michael Harrold, the first British person to reside in North Korea. The book was written to demystify North Korean society. ==History== Harrold, who sought a year or two of adventure after graduating from university, flew to Pyongyang, North Korea, in the spring of 1987 after accepting employment in the country's Foreign Languages Publishing House, where he assisted in the translation of President Kim Il Sung\u2019s words into English. In the book, Harrold intertwines his personal experiences living and working in the country with the recent history of Korea. In the early days, Harrold enjoyed his important status and the accompanying trappings of his work in North Korea. In addition to revising the words of President Kim Il Sung, he was given a prominent position at ceremonial events. Moreover, he was relatively well-paid. This relatively high salary allowed for a social life that was closed to all but the other foreigners in Pyongyang and a small North Korean elite. Although his interaction with North Koreans was severely restricted, he did become acquainted with some of Pyongyang\u2019s better off. Harrold spent nearly seven years in North Korea, during which time he had many unusual experiences that make fascinating reading. He also developed a relatively unique understanding of North Korean society. Eventually, circumstances led to Harrold's being forced to leave the country. As a result, he was left with a deep sense of resentment toward North Korea. Looking back on his experiences, Harrold admits his earlier na\u00efvet\u00e9, when he believed that \u201cinternational problems could best be resolved by ordinary people over a pint or two of beer (403).\u201d In the end, he was critical of North Korea; nevertheless, he refused to blame the North Korean leadership for all the problems facing the country today, arguing that international actors, namely the United States, share the responsibility. ==Release details== *Comrades and Strangers: Behind the Closed Doors of North Korea John Wiley and Sons, 2004, == References == Category:2004 non-fiction books Category:Books about North Korea Category:North Korean society ",
