    "text": "Bordesley Green is an inner-city area of Birmingham, England about two miles east of the city centre. It also contains a road of the same name. It is also a ward in the formal district of Hodge Hill. Neighbouring areas include, Alum Rock, Saltley, Small Heath and Yardley. Heartlands Hospital is located in the eastern part of Bordesley Green. The area is also served by Yardley Green Medical Centre and Omnia Practice. Kingfisher Country Park covers the River Cole recreation grounds which are partially covered by the area's boundaries. Bordesley Green has a larger Eastern European community including Romanians, Poles, and Russians settling in the area, but it is still predominantly South Asian. ==History== The name of this part of Birmingham is derived from an ancient area of demesne pasture, listed in early records dating back to 1285 as La Grene de Bordeslei. The area began to be built up in 1834, with scattered developments from Bordesley along Bordesley Green from the junction of Cattell Road and Garrison Lane as far east as Blake Lane. By 1906 urban development had spread eastwards as far as Blakesland Street and Mansell Road and included a fire station and police station, both of which survive, though the fire station no longer serves its original purpose and the police station is now a hostel for homeless people. The old fire station in Bordesley Green Many roads in Bordesley Green were built not long after the Boer War at the end of the 19th century and were named to commemorate the hundreds of soldiers from Birmingham that died in that war. Examples include Pretoria Road, named after the capital of the Boer republic of the Transvaal; Churchill Road, after Winston Churchill who fought in the Boer War, was captured but escaped; Botha Road, named after the Boer general who became the first prime minister of the Union of South Africa; and Colonial Road. Many late-Victorian and Edwardian houses remain in Bordesley Green and much of the area has physically changed little since then. ===Industrial Hub=== At the turn of the twentieth century Bordesley Green had become a district noted for industry and manufacturing. It was the home of the Wolseley Tool and Motor Car Company, which had a manufacturing plant in Bordesley from 1901 to 1920 where motor cars and machine tools were built. The National Telephone Company also stationed one of its main depots in Bordesley Green's Fordrough Lane, a plant which was to become one of the three major General Post Office (GPO) factories in Birmingham. The Fordrough Lane GPO factory specialised in manual telephony, including factory repaired telephones, \"candlestick\" \u2018phones, switchboards and associated components. The factory played a significant role in the development of the Colossus computer which was used to read encrypted German messages in World War II. In the 1960s, the HANDEL Nuclear Attack Warning equipment, known as the four minute warning was manufactured in Bordesley Green, along with equipment for regional seats of government, which were part of Britain's civil defence preparations for nuclear war. ===Blitz=== Bordesley Green was targeted during the Blitzkrieg with five raids hitting the area. The last German bomb to hit Birmingham landed on 24 April 1943 and hit Bordesley Green. The GPO factory was also hit by German bombing raids in 1940. ==Wildlife== ===Tumbling Pigeons=== In the 1920s a Bordesley Green bus driver and pigeon fancier, William Penson, noticed one of his birds perform a backflip while in flight, and through selective breeding produced the Roller and Tumbler breed of pigeon. This breed is noted for its unique acrobatics while in flight and is used in \u2018parlour rolling\u2019 contests. Today there are hundreds of Birmingham Roller clubs around the world and fiercely fought competitions to pick the birds that perform the most dramatic tumbling. ==Geology== The bedrock geology of the area consists predominantly of Sidmouth Mudstone Formation. Sedimentary Bedrock formed approximately 228 to 250 million years ago in the Triassic Period. The local environment was previously dominated by hot deserts. The types of sedimentary rocks in the Bordesley area are fluvial, lacustrine and marine in origin. They would have been detrital, deposited in lagoons or shallow seas, where a hot, arid climate would have led to the precipitation of beds of evaporites. The superficial deposits tend to be glaciofluvial in origin, Mid Pleistocene - Sand And Gravel. Superficial Deposits in area were formed up to 2 million years ago in the Quaternary Period. The Bordesley environment would have been dominated by ice age conditions. The deposits are detrital, generally coarse-grained, forming beds, channels, plains and fans associated with meltwater.http://mapapps.bgs.ac.uk/geologyofbritain/home.html?location=b9 ===Lost brook of Bordesley Green=== Early maps of the area show a brook which extended from Shaw Hill down to Bordesley Green Road, which is now mostly submerged, with the exception of a small section which emerges from a culvert in Bordesley Green. It is called Washbrook. It\u2019s starts up near garrison lane then flows through the South African Estate, on through the allotments. It is open in Ward End Park then on into the River Tame at Bromford. ==Demography== In 2001, an estimated 31,343 people were living in the ward making it the second most populous ward, behind Sparkbrook.Birmingham Economy: Population This increased to 33,937 by the time of the 2011 Population Census.

It is represented at the Birmingham City Council by three Labour councillor; Shafique Shah (Labour), Mohammed Aikhlaq (Labour) and Uzma Ahmed (Labour). Bordesley Green has adopted a Ward Support Officer. The current holder of the title is Tracey Arthurs. ==Bordesley Village== Bordesley Green has an associated village, Bordesley Village, within its ward, offering considerably better housing. The village is often referred as a separate area, and attempts are being made to separate the two to distinguish the areas. The village is also home to the City's football team, Birmingham City FC, built before the village was established from an old gypsy encampment and scrap yard. Recently, the village has seen several additions, becoming the hub of the city's new car sales, with premium firms such as Mercedes Benz, Audi & Infiniti, as well as Volkswagen & Seat and many more including motorcycle firms Heine Gericke & Triumph. The village is also served by several small shops, such as newsagents, a pharmacy and has its own dentist and doctors surgery. The village also caters for the needs of shoppers, offering a Morrisons supermarket & fuel station and Iceland, as well as fashion outlets such as JD, Bank, Topshop and other shops such as Toys R Us, Poundland, B&M; and many more national companies within walking distance of the village. The Village concept in Bordesley Green was the first \"Ideal Village\" in England, built between 1908 and 1914 by Barry Parker and Raymond Unwin. The pair eventually went on to build Welwyn Garden City in Hertfordshire. The villages were a welcome relief to English cities at the time and the homes were built to high standards. Daniels Road in Bordesley Green commemorates schoolteacher Francis Daniels. Originally from Ebley near Stroud, Daniels came to Birmingham in 1891 and soon saw the need to provide affordable social security for ordinary working people. With the Lord Mayor, Alderman William Kendrick as president and Daniels himself as general secretary, the Ideal Society was formed. By 1910 the society had moved into housing provision and commenced the building of the Ideal Village at Bordesley Green, where Finnemore Road also commemorates an early chairman of the society, William Finnemore. The first houses to be built were in Drummond Road. The village, which was designed for artisan workers, has shops, a park and a school and a much lower density of housing than the nearby terraces. St Paul's Mission, built in 1912 in Finnemore Road as a chapel of St Margaret's Ward End, was consecrated as a parish church in 1929. A new church was built c1970 in Belchers Lane behind the old, which was retained as the church hall. The church is now the centre of a community project embracing a number of different facilities and services. In 1998 children from Bordesley Green Primary School discovered the origin of a badly damaged stone fountain in the Ideal Park which commemorates the rescue by a local boy of a drowning girl. On 7 May 1907 16-year-old cycle polisher, Harold Clayfield of 11 Ronald Road, jumped into a 5m deep clay pit at the junction of Belchers Lane and Bordesley Green to save 4-year-old, Florence Jones. The girl was saved, but non-swimmer Clayfield, drowned. His memorial was paid for by public subscription. Sadly Florence herself was to die only four years later as a result of playing with burning pieces of paper at her home in Green Lane. ==Public art== The area features public art with the installation of Ondr\u00e9 Nowakowski's Sleeping Iron Giant, a large head lying on its side on a mound near the St Andrew's football ground. ==Skate park== Bordesley Green has one skate park, known locally as the Pod. It is popular with mini BMX Rocker riders. ==Bordesley Green Allotments== The historic Bordesley Green Allotments is a 25-acre site that is host to the Bordesley Green Forest garden and in 2012 was the venue for the Birmingham Annual Gardening Show which is normally held in Kings Heath Park. ==Education== ===Primary schools=== *Alston Junior and Infants Primary School *Bordesley Green Junior and Infants Primary School *Wyndcliffe Primary School ===Secondary schools=== *Bordesley Green Girls' School *Saltley Academy ===Further education=== *South and City College Birmingham \u2013 Bordesley Green Campus ==Health== * Heartlands Hospital * Yardley Green Medical Centre * Omnia Practice ==References== ==External links== *2001 Population census information: Ward profiles *Birmingham City Council: Bordesley Green Ward Category:Areas of Birmingham, West Midlands Category:Wards of Birmingham, West Midlands ",
