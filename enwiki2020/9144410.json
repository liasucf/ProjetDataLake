    "text": "Arnaud Tournant (born 5 April 1978) is a French track cyclist. He has won 14 World Championships (record of men) and won a gold, silver and a bronze at the Summer Olympics. ==Biography== Tournant was born in Roubaix, near the border with Belgium, and currently lives in Fontenay-sous-Bois. He began making his mark as an international rider whilst still in the junior ranks, winning the silver medal at the Junior Track World Championships in 1996. ===World record=== Tournant is the world record holder (at altitude) for the Kilo (1000m time trial). He first set the record in Mexico in 2000, with a time of 1:00.148. In October the following year, at the age of 23, Tournant became the first man to go under the one-minute mark, breaking his own world record with a new time of 58.875 seconds set at La Paz, Bolivia. Chris Hoy came to within 0.005 seconds of Tournant's record on his second attempt, but failed to beat it. Hoy said he could not go any faster, and had even more respect for Tournant and his talents. ===2004=== Tournant was a member of the French team sprint squad at the 2004 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, this was the sixth time they won a gold medal with Tournant. He also picked up a silver medal in the Kilo. At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Tournant won a silver medal in the kilo, and a bronze in the team sprint. Tournant refused to speak at a post-race press conference at the Olympics, until Stephane Mandard, a journalist for Le Monde newspaper, and an anti-doping campaigner, left the room. Mandard's reporting of the Cofidis doping scandal had left scars, despite the fact that Tournant had not been involved. At the press conference, Tournant held his ground and after a long pause, Mandard walked out. ===2008 and retirement=== Tournant was a member of the team sprint squad (with Gr\u00e9gory Baug\u00e9, K\u00e9vin Sireau and Micka\u00ebl Bourgain) which won a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He retired after these Olympic Games and was made a Commander of the Ordre national du M\u00e9rite on 14 November 2008. However, he will continue to be involved in cycling as he has been named as the new directeur sportif of the Cofidis track team. ==Major results== ;1996 :2nd Sprint, Track World Championships - Junior ;1997 :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;1998 :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Cali (with Laurent Gan\u00e9 & Damien Gerard) :1st Sprint, World Cup, Cali :1st Kilo, World Cup, Berlin :2nd Team Sprint, World Cup, Berlin ;1999 :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Cali (with Micka\u00ebl Bourgain & Vincent Le Quellec) :1st Sprint, World Cup, Cali :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2000 :1st Team Sprint, 2000 Summer Olympics :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships ;2001 :Kilo World record in La Paz, 58.875 :1st Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Sprint, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :3rd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2002 :2nd Kilo, UCI Track World Championships :2nd Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :2nd Team Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Monterrey (with Franck Durivaux & Arnaud Dubl\u00e9) :1st Kilo, World Cup, Monterrey :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2003 :2nd Kilo, French National Track Championships :3rd Sprint, French National Track Championships :3rd Kilo, Track World Championships :2nd Team Sprint, Track World Championships ;2004 :2nd Kilo, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :2nd Kilo, World Cup, Aguascalientes :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Aguascalientes :1st Kilo, French National Track Championships :2nd Sprint, French National Track Championships :2nd Kilo, 2004 Summer Olympics :3rd Team Sprint, 2004 Summer Olympics ;2005 :2nd Keirin, World Cup, Los Angeles :2nd Sprint, World Cup, Los Angeles :3rd Team Sprint, World Cup, Los Angeles :3rd Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :1st Team Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :1st Sprint, French National Track Championships :2nd Keirin, French National Track Championships ;2006 :3rd Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :2nd Team Sprint, World Cup, Sydney :3rd Keirin, Track World Championships :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :3rd Sprint, French National Track Championships ;2007 :3rd Masters of Sprint :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships ;2008 :1st Team Sprint, Track World Championships :2nd Team Sprint, 2008 Summer Olympics ==References== ==External links== * * * * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:French male cyclists Category:Olympic cyclists of France Category:Cyclists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Cyclists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic gold medalists for France Category:Olympic silver medalists for France Category:Olympic bronze medalists for France Category:UCI Track Cycling World Champions (men) Category:Commanders of the National Order of Merit (France) Category:Sportspeople from Roubaix Category:Olympic medalists in cycling Category:Medalists at the 2008 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2004 Summer Olympics Category:Medalists at the 2000 Summer Olympics Category:French track cyclists ",
