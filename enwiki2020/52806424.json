    "text": "William Norwood Potter (27 August 1840 \u2013 13 March 1895) was an English chess master and writer. He is primarily remembered for the quality of his chess journalism, and for his association with Wilhelm Steinitz, the first winner of a world chess championship match. == Life and career == Potter was born in London on 27 August 1840 to William and Mary Anne (Martin) Potter. He had three brothers and a sister, Mary Potter. A barristers' clerk by trade, Potter first appeared in London chess circles in 1867 and rose quickly from obscurity, winning the 1870 City of London Chess Club handicap tournament, in which he defeated Joseph Henry Blackburne and Cecil Valentine De Vere on even terms. From 1872 to 1874 the City of London Chess Club contested a two-game correspondence chess match with Vienna: the other London team members eventually dropped out, leaving Potter and Steinitz to continue the match by themselves, which they ultimately won by a score of 1.5\u20130.5. Steinitz would later point to this match as the beginning of the \"systematic analytical development of modern ideas\" in chess. In 1875 Potter lost a hard-fought match against Johannes Zukertort, scoring two wins and four losses with eight draws. In 1879 he drew a match against James Mason, both sides scoring five wins apiece with eleven draws. Potter was a chess columnist for the Westminster Papers from 1868 to 1879. From 1874 to 1876 he produced his own periodical, the City of London Chess Magazine, which featured contributions from Zukertort and Steinitz. Subsequently, he became the last chess editor at Land and Water from 1877 to 1885. He also contributed the well-reviewed article on chess in the ninth edition of Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica. After 1885 Potter retired from the London chess scene. He died in his home in Sutton on 13 March 1895. == Assessment and legacy == In Potter's obituary, the British Chess Magazine noted that though \"his record of first-class play is not a long one\", \"the quality of his best play entitles him, we think, to rank as the equal of any British-born master of his time, with the single exception of Blackburne.\" Regarding Potter, Steinitz once said: \"Put all the pieces into a hat and shake them out on to the board, and you have Potter\u2019s style exactly\"; but nevertheless acknowledged him as \"a very fine player of the modern school, as well as unquestionably the ablest analyst in England next to Zukertort.\" Emanuel Lasker claimed in his Manual of Chess that Potter \"had influenced Steinitz greatly\" but subsequent commentators have cast doubt on this assessment. For his part, Steinitz claimed that Potter \"was my pupil direct for some time.\" Potter's chess writings are praised for their mastery, liveliness and wit. The Oxford Companion to Chess records two opening variations bearing Potter's name, one in the Scotch Game (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.d4 exd4 4.Nxd4 Bc5 5. Nb3) which he introduced in the 1870s and which was revived in the 2000s by Vassily Ivanchuk and Magnus Carlsen, and one in the Compromised Defence to the Evans Gambit (1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5 4.b4 Bxb4 5.c3 Ba5 6.d4 exd4 7.0-0 dxc3 8.Qb3 Qf6 9.e5 Qg6 10.Nxc3 Nge7 11.Rd1) which he gave in his Land and Water column. The Saavedra position, one of the best- known endgame studies in chess, originates from a game of Potter's against Richard Fenton in 1875: see Saavedra position#History. == Notable games == === Potter vs. Matthews, London 1868 === {| style=\"float:right;\" |- valign=\"top\" | | | |} This frequently published miniature, which features a knight delivering checkmate from a corner of the board, was played between Potter (White) and Matthews (Black) during a \"meeting of the British Chess Association\" in 1868. :1.e4 e5 2.d4 exd4 3.Bc4 c5 4.Nf3 d6 5.0-0 Nc6 6.c3 d3 7.Re1 Bg4 8.e5!
