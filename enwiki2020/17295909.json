    "text": "The Stanley Cup at the Hockey Hall of Fame The 1994 Stanley Cup playoffs, the playoff tournament of the National Hockey League (NHL), began after the conclusion of the 1993\u201394 NHL season. The sixteen teams that qualified, eight from each conference, played best-of-seven game series for conference quarterfinals, semifinals and championships; and then the conference champions played a best-of-seven series for the Stanley Cup. The playoffs ended when the New York Rangers defeated the Vancouver Canucks in the seventh game of the 1994 Stanley Cup Finals. In total, an NHL record seven game sevens were played in this year's playoffs, two of which went to overtime. For the first time since joining the NHL, all four former WHA teams (Edmonton, Hartford, Quebec, and Winnipeg) failed to make the playoffs. Wayne Gretzky also missed the playoffs for the first time in his career. Conversely, the San Jose Sharks became the first post-1990 expansion team to make the playoffs. All series played between Central and Pacific Division teams had a 2\u20133\u20132 format to reduce travel. This remains the last time that two Canadian teams made it to the conference finals in the same year, let alone faced each other in that particular round. ==Playoff seeds== This was the first season of the NHL's new conference-oriented playoff format, emulating the NBA's seeding format in use then for the opening round. The following teams qualified for the playoffs: ===Eastern Conference=== # New York Rangers, Atlantic Division champions, Eastern Conference regular season champions, Presidents' Trophy winners \u2013 112 points # Pittsburgh Penguins, Northeast Division champions \u2013 101 points # New Jersey Devils \u2013 106 points # Boston Bruins \u2013 97 points # Montreal Canadiens \u2013 96 points # Buffalo Sabres \u2013 95 points # Washington Capitals \u2013 88 points # New York Islanders \u2013 84 points ===Western Conference=== # Detroit Red Wings, Central Division champions, Western Conference regular season champions \u2013 100 points # Calgary Flames, Pacific Division champions \u2013 97 points # Toronto Maple Leafs \u2013 98 points # Dallas Stars \u2013 97 points # St. Louis Blues \u2013 91 points # Chicago Blackhawks \u2013 87 points # Vancouver Canucks \u2013 85 points # San Jose Sharks \u2013 82 points ==Playoff bracket== ==Conference Quarterfinals== ===Eastern Conference Quarterfinals=== ====(1) New York Rangers vs. (8) New York Islanders==== The New York Rangers entered the playoffs as the Presidents' Trophy winners, the Eastern Conference regular season and Atlantic Division champions with 112 points. The Islanders qualified as the eighth seed earning 84 points during the regular season. This was the eighth playoff series between these two teams, with the Islanders winning five of the previous seven series. They last met in the 1990 Patrick Division Semifinals which the Rangers won in five games. The Islanders won the season series earning six of ten points during this year's five game regular season series. This was the last time that the Islanders got swept in a playoff series until the 2019 Second Round. ====(2) Pittsburgh Penguins vs. (7) Washington Capitals==== This was the third playoff series between these two teams, with Pittsburgh winning both previous series, and the most recent series being in the 1992 Patrick Division Semifinals which Pittsburgh won in seven games after erasing a 3-1 deficit. Until 2018, this was the only time the Capitals had defeated the Penguins in their first ten playoff matchups. ====(3) New Jersey Devils vs. (6) Buffalo Sabres==== ====(4) Boston Bruins vs. (5) Montreal Canadiens==== Game six was the final playoff game in the Montreal Forum. ===Western Conference Quarterfinals=== ====(1) Detroit Red Wings vs. (8) San Jose Sharks==== This was the first playoff series between these two teams. ====(2) Calgary Flames vs. (7) Vancouver Canucks==== ====(3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (6) Chicago Blackhawks==== This was the eighth playoff series between these two teams, with Toronto winning five of the seven previous series.

They last met in the 1991 Division Final which Minnesota won in six games. This was the first time the city of Dallas was ever represented in the Stanley Cup playoffs. Game four was the last game ever at St. Louis Arena. ==Conference Semifinals== ===Eastern Conference Semifinals=== ====(1) New York Rangers vs. (7) Washington Capitals==== This was the fourth playoff series between these two teams, with Washington winning two of the previous three series. They last met in the 1991 Division Semifinals which Washington won in six games. They would not meet in the playoffs again until 2009. ====(3) New Jersey Devils vs. (4) Boston Bruins==== This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams. They last met in the 1988 Prince of Wales Conference Final which the Bruins won in seven games. ===Western Conference Semifinals=== ====(4) Dallas Stars vs. (7) Vancouver Canucks==== ====(3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (8) San Jose Sharks==== ==Conference Finals== ===Eastern Conference Final=== ====(1) New York Rangers vs. (3) New Jersey Devils==== This was the second playoff series between these two teams, with New York winning the only previous series. They last met in the 1992 Division Semifinals, which New York won in seven games. This was the first Conference Final since 1985 not to feature either the Boston Bruins or the Montreal Canadiens. New York made their first conference finals appearance since 1986, while the Devils made their second conference finals appearance and first since 1988. The Rangers and Devils finished 1\u20132 respectively in the NHL during the regular season. Despite the two teams strong regular season records, the Rangers entered the series heavily favored as they swept the regular season six game series with the Devils. With a minute remaining in game one at Madison Square Garden New York was leading 3\u20132. However, Devils forward Claude Lemieux tied the game on a scramble in front of New York goaltender Mike Richter. The Devils went on to win the game on Stephane Richer's breakaway goal at 15:23 of the second overtime. The Rangers evened the series winning game two in a 4\u20130 shutout. The series then turned to the Meadowlands in East Rutherford, New Jersey, for games three and four. Like game one, game three went into double overtime but this time it was New York who won 3\u20132 on Stephane Matteau's goal at 6:13 of the second overtime period. The Devils won game four by a final score of 3\u20131 and evened the series at 2\u20132. The Devils took the series lead with a 4\u20131 win at Madison Square Garden in game five. Despite the fact that his team trailed in the series 3\u20132, Rangers captain Mark Messier made a highly publicized guarantee that New York would win game six. After trailing New Jersey by a score of 2\u20131 after two periods Messier himself scored a third-period hat trick to rally the Rangers to a 4\u20132 victory. Rangers coach Mike Keenan said of the guarantee, \"Mark was sending a message to his teammates that he believed together we could win. He put on an amazing performance to make sure it happened.\" Game seven played at Madison Square Garden, was a goaltending battle between New Jersey's Martin Brodeur and New York's Mike Richter. Brian Leetch gave the Rangers a 1\u20130 lead in the second period. Richter shut out the Devils for over 59 minutes before conceding a goal to Devils forward Valeri Zelepukin with just 7.7 seconds remaining in regulation. The two teams played into double overtime for the third time in the series and for the second time in the series it was Stephane Matteau who scored the game winner. Matteau scored on a wrap-around at 4:24 of the second overtime period as the Rangers won the game 2\u20131 and the series 4\u20133. ===Western Conference Final=== ====(3) Toronto Maple Leafs vs. (7) Vancouver Canucks==== This was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. Toronto returned to the conference final for a second consecutive year after losing to Los Angeles in seven games the year before. This was Vancouver's first appearance in a conference final since 1982 when they defeated Chicago in five games. This remains the last conference finals series to be played entirely in Canada. Toronto won game one at Maple Leaf Gardens on Peter Zezel's goal at 16:55 of the first overtime period. After that however, the Maple Leafs could not seem to slow down the bigger, more-powerful Canucks. Vancouver edged Toronto 4\u20133 in game two and then shutout the Maple Leafs at the Pacific Coliseum in games three and four, by scores of 4\u20130 and 2\u20130 respectively. Down three games to one and facing elimination the Maple Leafs played much better in game five. They pushed Vancouver to double overtime but it was Vancouver forward Greg Adams who beat Leafs goaltender Felix Potvin just 14 seconds into the second overtime period to give the Canucks a 4\u20133 win and a 4\u20131 series win. ==Stanley Cup Finals== This was the first and to date only playoff series between these two teams. This was Vancouver's second appearance in the Finals; in their last Finals appearance they were swept by the Islanders in . The Rangers were making their tenth appearance in the Finals and first since losing in five games to Montreal in . The Rangers last won the Stanley Cup in 1940. With the Rangers having 112 points against Vancouver's 85, the 27 point difference was the largest point differential between two teams in the Stanley Cup Finals since 1982 when 41 points separated the New York Islanders (118) and Vancouver (77). In a back and forth series that went the maximum seven games, one lengthy drought ended and another began. The Rangers won the Stanley Cup for their fourth title in franchise history, and first since , while the Canucks were the last Canadian team to play for the Stanley Cup until the Calgary Flames. This was the longest streak that Canadian teams did not qualify for the Finals from 1994\u20132004 (10 years). Prior to this the longest streak of Canadian teams missing the Finals was just three years. ==Playoff statistics== ===Skaters=== These are the top ten skaters based on points.NHL.com - Skater Stats {| style=\"padding:3px; border-spacing:0; text-align:center;\" class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- ! style=\"width:12em\" | Player ! style=\"width:12em\" | Team ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | ! data-sort-type=\"number\" style=\"width:4em\" | ! style=\"width:4em\" | |-align=center |align=left|Brian Leetch||align=left|New York Rangers|| 23 || 11 || 23 || 34 || +19 || 6 |-align=center |align=left|Pavel Bure||align=left|Vancouver Canucks || 24 || 16 || 15 || 31 || +8 || 40 |-align=center |align=left|Mark Messier||align=left|New York Rangers || 23 || 12 || 18 || 30 || +14 || 33 |-align=center |align=left|Doug Gilmour||align=left|Toronto Maple Leafs || 18 || 6 || 22 || 28 || +3 || 42 |-align=center |align=left|Trevor Linden||align=left|Vancouver Canucks || 24 || 12 || 13 || 25 || +3 || 18 |-align=center |align=left|Alexei Kovalev||align=left|New York Rangers || 23 || 9 || 12 || 21 || +5 || 18 |-align=center |align=left|Geoff Courtnall||align=left|Vancouver Canucks || 24 || 9 || 10 || 19 || +10 || 51 |-align=center |align=left|Sergei Zubov||align=left|New York Rangers|| 22 || 5 || 14 || 19 || +10 || 0 |-align=center |align=left|Claude Lemieux||align=left|New Jersey Devils || 20 || 7 || 11 || 18 || +4 || 44 |-align=center |align=left|Igor Larionov||align=left|San Jose Sharks|| 14 || 5 || 13 || 18 || -1 || 10 |} ===Goaltenders=== This is a combined table of the top five goaltenders based on goals against average and the top five goaltenders based on save percentage, with at least 420 minutes played.
