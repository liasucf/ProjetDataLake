    "text": "Christian Rex van Minnen is an American contemporary artist. He was born in Providence, RI, in 1980 and received his BA from Regis University, Denver, in 2002. ==Biography== Christian Rex van Minnen was born in 1980 in Providence, Rhode Island and grew up in Colorado. His father is a psychotherapist in Basalt, Colorado and was born in South Africa but did not have much direct contact. His uncles were fishermen and had a fish market in Charlestown, Rhode Island called Rathbones. He always doodled in high school and was introduced to painting before going to university. He is not formally trained in art but in 2002 he graduated with a BA from Regis University. He chose painting as a prime profession in 2005\u20132006. Early in his career he worked on a smaller scale of 18x24 inches. These were more personal pieces. Later, he moved into a larger scale and he had to change his technique and remove some of the complexity and try not to not to fill every square inch on the canvas. In 2006 he was a landscaper and completed a Masters in non-profit management while also working at a gallery. It was at time that he became frustrated and worked to use the internet to get around the traditional art scene. He has lived in Denver, Los Angeles, Seattle, and Carbondale, Colorado from 2007 to 2014. In 2011, he did a residency at Anderson Ranch Arts Center, Snowmass, Colorado. He lived and worked in Coyoacan Mexico City for 3 months in 2011. While there, he worked with Mexican artist Rodrigo Cifuentes. From 2014 until 2017, he lived in Brooklyn. He now lives in Santa Clara. His first solo show in Europe was at the Gallery Paulson in Copenhagen in May 2014. In November 2018, Aaron Johnson and Van Minnen had their first exhibit together in Hong Kong. Johnson and van Minnen have been long time friends. Van Minnen works almost exclusively in painting but he has also made some ceramic sculptures. Van Minnen is married to Ashley Muse and they have a son, Desmond. ==Influences== Van Minnen's favorite artist is Otto Marseus van Schrieck, a Dutch master painter, best known for his paintings of forest flora and fauna. 500px Van Minnen has studied the following artists: Nicole Duennebier, Ryan Riss, Judy Pfaff, Jenny Morgan, Barnaby Furnas, Skinner, Erik Parker, Judy Fox, Kenny Scharf, Ryan Schneider, Amir Fallah, Martin Wittfooth, Gregory Jacobsen, Sinisa Kukec, Liz Craft, Wayne White, Ryan Travis Christian, Seamus Conley, Fulvio di Piazza, Mark Dean Veca, Tomoe Gokita, Robin Williams, Barnaby Whitfield, Julie Heffernan, Nicola Verlato, David Altmejd, Robert Hardgrave, Kim Keever, Aaron Johnson, Brendan Danielsson, Wangechi Mutu, Pieter Bruegel the Elder and Pieter Aertsen. Hendrik Goltzius and the line work from Grotius can be seen in some of the tattooed skins. Influential authors have been John Steinbeck, Cormac McCarthy and the Mark Frost book, The Secret History of Twin Peaks An influence on van Minnen for the tattoos and use of the \"swelling line\", where the burin is manipulated to make lines thicker or thinner to create a tonal effect from a distance Rembrandt and the old masters have also been a major influence. Much of his color mixing and painting go back to this for technique. His colorful gummy bears go back to the Venetian school of mixing grays and colors along with complementary debt coloring. The gummy bears he paints are painted in reverse in that he paints the brightest colors first on a white oil background and then adds color on top. These gummy bears balance the heavy dark background. He enjoyed working in New York because of the environment and the competitiveness and pressure. New York to him represents ideas but he had a chance to go back to Colorado each summer for mountain biking, fishing and camping with his son. He has since gone to live in California to continue his surfing which comes through in his most recent paintings in painting tattoos of surfers on portraits. While painting he puts on audio books and podcasts in the background. What he plays depends on the state of mind of what he wants to paint. His listening tastes are very eclectic from country, to classical opera to rap. He has a playlist that shuffles Anya and Ministry. His preference in podcasts is for comedy. Van Minnen is a hard worker who doesn't wait for inspiration to paint but just shows up every day. He has a routine and works a regular work week. Film directors such as David Lynch (especially his 1990s series Twin Peaks). Werner Herzog and David Cronenberg have influenced van Minnen. But the greatest cinematic influence was the film series Alien especially Alien 2. Van Minnen saw this when he was young and the character Ellen Ripley to him represents his mother trying to save the kids from the parasites of anger, addiction and the environment. Van Minnen likes the early two movies more than the ones that came after it. One of the influences is a book he read when he was young was a nature field guide with drawings of parasites. ===Painting style=== He is interested in drawing the viewer into an attraction-repulsion feeding on the same part of the colors while the gummy bears draw the viewer in and the organs and tattoos push the viewer away. The production process involves a monochromatic underpainting while leaving the white of the canvas exposed for certain figures. While his Dutch Masters golden age paintings might try to glorify that period it is clear to him that the richness of materials in those paintings and the painting themselves represent colonial exploitation. He starts with underpaintings and then over paints with a semi transparent color, as was developed by Titian. He uses a dynamic color mixing which allows them to paint in layers and allows the light to mix with the color instead of mixing on the palette. Self-taught, he studied intensively a book called Methods and Materials of the Great Schools and Masters by Sir Charles Lock Eastlake. The underpaintings are monotypes he works on at home and then continues the over painting at his studio. This allows a quick production of monotypes where he can get a couple done per week and allows him to balance the months of painting and layers that have to go on top. In this way he can get ideas out quickly and not worry about capturing every single idea and painting at first. Van Minnen does not describe his work as macabre which would have to do with death and injury but rather about life and the absurd. His work has also been called Super-Realism because his figures and gummy bears leap off the canvas. Another series of decapitated heads on top of jelly bears project power and language. All of the figures' heads have been executed but it is not clear how or why. Van Minnen has also been compared to a modern Arcimboldo or a cross between a Natural history museum and H.R. Giger In 2014 Van Minnen added more color to his work. In 2017, while wandering Madrid Van Minnen picked up a watercolor kit and has been making a number of pieces when traveling and outside of the studio. In 2017 he started working on a series with real-world issues and social political images. He does not want to go back to previous styles and continues to innovate. ===Elements in the portraits=== The characters or people in van Minnen's portraits are not specific people but objects on which his elements are placed on top in an automatic manner. None of the elements are metaphors or symbols. His paintings are not puzzles to be decoded and broken down and analyzed. His elements repeat through his work starting from the earlier still life. *Circles with spirals and bead-like structures are used like repetitive words that lose their meaning with the repetition. *Tattoos on figures sometimes are not easy to read and they do not have a private meaning to Van Minnen. *Lack of eyes or mouths on the figures might make it easier for the viewer to look longer at the piece. *Tie-dyed colors in a portrait. ==Galleries of his art== *Gallery Poulsen, Copenhagen, Denmark *Ross + Kramer, New York City *Richard Heller Gallery, Los Angeles == Permanent collections == *Denver Art Museum *Djurhuus Collection *Colecci\u014dn Solo *Richard B.
