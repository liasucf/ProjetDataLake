    "text": "The Bold Pilgrim Cemetery is a historic cemetery in rural Conway County, Arkansas. It is a parcel, located at the western end of Bold Pilgrim Road, about southwest of Solgohachia. The cemetery is estimated to have 600 burials, the largest number of which probably occurred in the first half of the 20th century. The cemetery was founded about 1890 by an African-American community that was located on a ridge west of the cemetery. This community, founded by former slaves, declined in the 1960s, mainly for economic reasons. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2018. ==See also== *National Register of Historic Places listings in Conway County, Arkansas ==References== Category:Cemeteries on the National Register of Historic Places in Arkansas Category:Conway County, Arkansas Category:National Register of Historic Places in Conway County, Arkansas Category:1890 establishments in Arkansas ",
