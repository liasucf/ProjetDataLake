    "text": "{| |} BMP YZ series unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are Chinese UAVs developed by Beijing MicroPilot Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Flight Control System Ltd. (BMP, \u5317\u4eac\u9ea6\u514b\u666e\u7279\u65e0\u4eba\u98de\u884c\u5668\u63a7\u5236\u7cfb\u7edf\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8), a company originally formed in 2001 specifically handle the import business of autopilots produced by Canadian firm MicroPilot for UAVs. Over the decade, the company expanded its business to importing other flight control systems to China, such as those produced by Russia. In recent years, in addition to being a supplier of subsystems to other Chinese UAV manufacturers, BMP further expanded its business to developing its own brand of UAVs by integrating autopilots and flight control systems to existing airframes, but there are some BMP UAV are designed by BMP itself. As an original equipment manufacturer, BMP is also contractor to produce UAVs developed by other Chinese establishments such as universities, research institutes and other Chinese UAV manufacturers. ==YZ-6== YZ-6 is the larger cousin of the smaller LHK developed by the same company, and is also in the same twin-boom layout. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven by a pusher engine mounted at the rear end of the empennage, and the UAV has tricycle landing gear system. YZ-6 adopts modular design concept and it can be equipped with several engines by different suppliers. Specification: *Length: 6 m *Wingspan: 3.1 m *Height: 0.84 m *Fuselage width: 0.55 m *Max take-off weight: 80\u2013120 kg *Empty weight: 35 kg *Payload: 20\u201350 kg *Fuel: 30 L *Endurance: > 7 h *Max speed: 160 km/h *Cruise speed: 120 km/h *Stall speed: 70 km/h *Launch: taxiing *Take-off distance: 50\u2013100 m *Recovery: taxiing ==YZ-8== YZ-8 is a large fixed UAV of YZ series, and it\u2019s in conventional layout with high wing configuration and V-tail. Propulsion is provided by a two-blade propeller driven pusher engine mounted at the empennage. Winglets are incorporated and landing gear consists of tricycle landing carriage. YZ-8 adopts modular design concept and subsystems such as engine can be changed rapidly among different types, and fuel tanks can be added or reduced based on mission requirement. Externally, YZ-8 looks very similar to another Chinese UAV, the GAIC Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper, because both share similar layout. The most distinct visual difference between ZY=8 and Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper is that the propeller of the former only has two blades while that of the latter has three. There is a bulge on the top of the nose of YZ-8 housing communication satellite dish, which the fuselage of Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper has no such bulge. Winglets are also an important visual cue to distinguish the two UAV, for that YZ-8 has winglets but Harrier Hawk II Air Sniper does not. Specification: *Max take-off weight (kg): 220 \u2013 320 *Empty weight (kg): 115 *Wingspan (m): 8.1 *Length (m): 5 *Height (m): 1.8 *Fuel (L): 80 \u2013 140 *Typical engine: MD 550 *Max payload (kg): 50 \u2013 80 *Take-off: taxiing *Endurance (hr): > 30 *Cruise speed (km/hr): 120 *Max speed (km/hr): 170 *Ceiling (km): 6 ==See also== List of unmanned aerial vehicles of China ==References== Category:Unmanned aerial vehicles of China ",
