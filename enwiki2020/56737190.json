She currently works at the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, and have with an association with the University of Auckland. ==Academic career== After a 2003 PhD at the Swedish- language \u00c5bo Akademi University titled 'Using multi-scale spatial and temporal information to explain soft-sediment macrofaunal heterogeneity,' Hewitt joined staff at National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research, rising to principal scientist. In 2016 Hewitt was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of New Zealand. == Selected works == * Thrush, S. F., J. E. Hewitt, V. J. Cummings, P. K. Dayton, M. Cryer, S. J. Turner, G. A. Funnell, R. G.
