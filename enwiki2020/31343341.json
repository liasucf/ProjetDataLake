The institute was established in the year 1958 with the start of a first grade college in Davangere. . Before this, Children in Davangere could study only till High School. There was no college to continue their higher studies and were forced to go to larger cities like Bangalore, Mysore, etc., To address this need, Sri Dharmaratnakara Rajanahally Maddurayappa, a well known Businessman and a Philanthropist built a College which is now popularly known as DRM Science College. To manage the administrative affairs of this college and to foster the cause of education, Bapuji Educational Association was formed by him. Under his tenure as the Founder President, several colleges including Medicine, Engineering, Nursing, Commerce, etc., were built. Then ruler of state, His Highness Sri Jayachamarajendra Wadiyar noted his contributions and conferred him with title of \"Dharmaratnakara\". The city of Davangere is forever indebted to his noble contributions. Two medical colleges, two dental colleges, and an engineering college are run by this association. These colleges account for around 50 institutions. Dr.Shamanuru Shivashankarappa, MLA has been the significant personality behind the growth of the organisation.
