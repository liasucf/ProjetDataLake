    "text": "The 2007\u201308 season was the 111th season of competitive football in Scotland. ==Overview== * Gretna were competing in the Scottish Premier League for the first time, their first ever season in the top-flight, after being promoted as First Division champions the previous season. * Dunfermline Athletic competed in the First Division after being relegated from the Scottish Premier League. * Greenock Morton and Stirling Albion played in the First Division after being promoted as Second Division champions and First Division play-off winners, respectively. * Ross County were competing in the Second Division after being relegated as the First Division's bottom team and Airdrie United were relegated through the Second Division play-offs. * Berwick Rangers and Queen's Park were competing in the Second Division after being promoted from the Third Division as champions and Second Division play-offs winners, respectively. * Forfar Athletic and Stranraer played Third Division football after being relegated as the Second Division's bottom team and Second Division play-off losers, respectively. * East Stirlingshire had a suspended reduction to associate members hanging over them from the previous season. Finishing bottom of the Third Division would mean an automatic and instant reduction to associate members (and with it a potential expulsion from the league two years later at the end of the 2009\u201310 season), while finishing 9th or higher would annul any punishment. ==Notable events== ===2007=== * 1 June \u2013 The Scottish Football Association appoint former Rangers and Kilmarnock striker Gordon Smith as the new Chief Executive following the departure of David Taylor who was appointed General Secretary of UEFA. * 20 July \u2013 Irn-Bru became the new sponsor of the Scottish Football League, signing a three-year deal. * 11 October \u2013 Celtic are fined \u00a325,000 by UEFA for \"lack of organisation and improper conduct by supporters\" during their UEFA Champions League match with A.C. Milan at Celtic Park. * 17 November \u2013 The Scotland national team fail to qualify for Euro 2008 after a 2\u20131 defeat by Italy at Hampden Park eliminated them at the qualifying stage. * 25 November \u2013 St Johnstone beat Dunfermline 3\u20132 to win the Challenge Cup for the first time. * 29 December \u2013 Motherwell captain Phil O'Donnell, 35, collapsed on the pitch at Fir Park during a match against Dundee United, and died later that evening. ===2008=== * 15 March \u2013 East Fife confirm their promotion to the Second Division as Third Division champions with a 3\u20130 victory over East Stirlingshire, becoming the first team in Britain to win a league trophy in the 2007\u201308 season. * 16 March \u2013 Rangers win the Scottish League Cup by beating Dundee United 3\u20132 in a penalty shootout after a 2\u20132 draw in the final at Hampden Park. * 22 March \u2013 Scotland's Under-17s qualify for the 2008 UEFA European Under-17 Football Championship after finishing top of their Elite qualifying group. * 29 March \u2013 Gretna are relegated from the SPL after losing 2\u20130 to St Mirren at Love Street. * 29 March \u2013 Berwick Rangers are relegated from the Second Division after a 2\u20132 draw with Peterhead. * 5 April \u2013 Ross County win promotion to the First Division as Second Division champions after defeating already-relegated Berwick Rangers 4\u20130 and second place Airdrie United losing 2\u20131 to Brechin City. * 8 April \u2013 Stirling Albion are relegated from the First Division after a 1\u20130 defeat to Partick Thistle. * 12 April \u2013 First Division Queen of the South beat SPL Aberdeen 4\u20133 at Hampden Park to qualify for their first Scottish Cup final, in the highest scoring semi-final ever. * 19 April \u2013 Hamilton Academical win promotion to the Scottish Premier League as First Division champions following a 2\u20130 over Clyde. * 10 May \u2013 Clyde retain their First Division status after defeating Airdrie United 3\u20130 on aggregate in the First Division play-off final. * 10 May \u2013 Arbroath are promoted to the Second Division after a 2\u20131 aggregate win over Stranraer in the Second Division play- off final. Cowdenbeath, who were beaten by Arbroath in the semi-finals, are relegated to the Third Division. * 14 May \u2013 Rangers lose 2\u20130 to Zenit St. Petersburg in the UEFA Cup Final. * 22 May \u2013 Celtic win their third successive SPL title after defeating Dundee United 1\u20130. * 24 May \u2013 Rangers win the Scottish Cup for the 32nd time after defeating Queen of the South 3\u20132 in the Final. This was the Dumfries club's first ever Scottish Cup Final appearance in their history. * 29 May \u2013 Gretna are demoted to the Third Division after administrator David Elliot could not guarantee the Football League that the club would fulfil its fixtures next season. Consequently, First Division play- off runners-up Airdrie United are promoted to the First Division and Second Division play-off runners-up Stranraer are promoted to the Second Division. ==Transfer deals== == Managerial changes== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !

Scotland needed a win in their final group game against Italy to qualify, although a draw would have been enough if Ukraine beat France in the last group fixture. Scotland lost 2\u20131 as a result of a heavily criticised decision by Spanish referee Manuel Mejuto Gonz\u00e1lez to award Italy a free kick in stoppage time (resulting in a goal) when it was clear it should have been a free kick to Scotland. Manager Alex McLeish resigned on 27 November 2007 following the loss against Italy and became manager of Birmingham City, his assistants Roy Aitken and Andy Watson joined him at Birmingham. He was eventually replaced on 24 January 2008 by Southampton manager George Burley, he appointed Steven Pressley and former England captain Terry Butcher as his assistants. In first match in charge a 1\u20131 draw was achieved against Croatia despite the withdrawal of 7 players. ===Results=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- !width=90|Date !Venue !width=130|Opponents !ScoreScotland's score is shown first. !Competition !Scotland scorer(s) !Report |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" |22 August |Pittodrie Stadium, Aberdeen (H) | |align=center|1\u20130 |Friendly |Kris Boyd |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" |8 September |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|3\u20131 |ECQ(B) |Kris Boyd, Stephen McManus, James McFadden |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" |12 September |Parc des Princes,Stade de France unavailable due to the Rugby World Cup 2007 Paris (A) | |align=center|1\u20130 |ECQ(B) |James McFadden |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#dfd;\" |13 October |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|3\u20131 |ECQ(B) |Kenny Miller, Lee McCulloch, James McFadden |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#fdd;\" |17 October |Boris Paichadze Stadium, Tbilisi (A) | |align=center|0\u20132 |ECQ(B) | |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#fdd;\" |17 November |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|1\u20132 |ECQ(B) |Barry Ferguson |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#ffd;\" |26 March |Hampden Park, Glasgow (H) | |align=center|1\u20131 |Friendly |Kenny Miller |BBC Sport |- style=\"background:#fdd;\" |30 May |AXA Arena, Prague (A) | |align=center|1\u20133 |Friendly |David Clarkson |BBC Sport |} ==Youth and Reserve football== ==Deaths== *12 July: Forbes Johnston, 35, Falkirk and Airdrie midfielder. *31 August: Willie Cunningham, 77, St Mirren and Dunfermline defender; Dunfermline, Falkirk and St Mirren manager. *11 September: Ian Porterfield, 61, Aberdeen manager (1986\u201388). *30 November: Ian Crawford, 73, Hamilton and Hearts winger. *29 December: Phil O'Donnell, 35, Motherwell, Celtic and Scotland midfielder (died whilst playing for Motherwell). *14 January: Johnny Steele, 91, East Fife and Ayr United inside forward. *20 April: Derek McKay, 59, Dundee and Aberdeen winger. *15 May: Tommy Burns, 51, Celtic, Kilmarnock and Scotland midfielder; Kilmarnock and Celtic manager. *7 June: Jimmy Bonthrone, 78, East Fife, Dundee and Stirling Albion inside forward; East Fife and Aberdeen manager. ==References== ==External links== * Scottish Premier League official website * Scottish Football League official website * BBC Scottish Premier League portal * BBC Scottish Football League portal Category:Seasons in Scottish football zh:2007\u5e74\u81f32008\u5e74\u8607\u683c\u862d\u8db3\u7403\u8d85\u7d1a\u806f\u8cfd ",
