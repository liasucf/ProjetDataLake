    "text": "The Charmings is an American fantasy sitcom that follows Snow White and Prince Charming, awakened from a thousand-year spell, as they adjust from their familiar life in the enchanted forest to the modern ways of 20th century Los Angeles suburbs. The series originally aired from March 20, 1987 to February 11, 1988 on ABC. ==Synopsis== The opening voice-over sets up the premise: The premise of the series' plot was that fairy tale characters Snow White and Prince Charming were magically transported to a 20th-century suburb in Burbank, California. Each episode shows the Charmings trying to adapt to their new life while Lillian, the wicked stepmother, and her wise cracking Magic Mirror watch from upstairs. After the first season, Caitlin O'Heaney (who portrayed Snow White), was replaced by Carol Huston. After mild success as part of ABC's Friday night lineup, the series was moved to Thursday nights for its second season, in a head to head battle with NBC's Family Ties. Due to low ratings, the series was canceled after twenty episodes. One episode remains unaired in the US, though it was shown during the show's run in the UK. ==Characters== ;Snow White Charming: Played by Caitlin O'Heaney (1987) and Carol Huston (1987-1988). Her \"fairy tale\" motif caught the attention of a department store executive, who then sponsored a line of interior decorating products and gave her a job overseeing the designs. ;Prince Eric Charming: Played by Christopher Rich. Unskilled at anything in the modern world, he largely was a stay-at-home dad who wrote about his time in the Enchanted Kingdom. Later he learns he has a skill for handyman work and carpentry, and soon gets a job in construction. ;Thomas and Cory Charming: The two Charming children. Played by Brandon Call and Garette Ratliff Henson. Due to their spending the least time in the fairy tale world, they had been the most assimilated into 20th Century society, and they faced difficulties accepting they were from fairy tales. ;Queen Lillian White: The wicked stepmother, whose sorcery often backfired on her, but would occasionally prove useful in helping her family. Played by Judy Parfitt. ;Luther: One of the Seven Dwarfs. Played by Cork Hubbert. ;The Magic Mirror: Played by Paul Winfield. The Mirror frequently reminded Lillian that her daughter and son-in-law would come out on top and make it in this new land because unlike her, they were good hearted people who respected others. A running gag was that he would make remarks about how Snow White is the fairest and telling Lillian \"it ain't you!\" whenever she asks who is the fairest. However, it is implied he may have been joking, because at one point when Lillian has lost her powers and he must depart, he confides in her that she has always been the fairest. ;Don \"King of Carpets\" Miller and Sally Miller: The Charmings' neighbors who found their new neighbors' penchant for medieval fairy tale style odd but never figured out they were the real Prince Charming and Snow White. Even when Eric was under a truth spell and confided in Don that they were Prince Charming and Snow White, Don considered it a joke. Played by Paul Eiding and Dori Brenner. ==Episodes== {| class=wikitable style=\"text-align:center\" ! colspan=2| Season ! Episodes ! First aired !
