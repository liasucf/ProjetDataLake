The region is surrounded by trees of Deodar. The average altitude of Shimla is 2206 meters. It is 7 km from the nearby railway station. This small locality has developed since an Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) was added. The area was once out of the way of Shimla people. It has become a popular place well connected by roads. Though situated on the outskirts, the transport system, ISBT, makes the area easily reachable. == History == Tutikandi was once an untouched part of Shimla. Dense, thick forest covers much of the region. For many years it served as a garbage dump. Its location was one major reason for choosing it as a dumping site. With the expansion the dumping site was relocated. == Today == Tutikandi serves as a bypass road. Abattoir house is run by the municipal corporation of Shimla. === Sights === * Jalapu House is a traditional building of Shimla. It was constructed in the 1920s.
