    "text": "Toronto ferry Ongiara The Ongiara is a -year-old Toronto Island ferry operated by the Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division of the City of Toronto government. The ferry serves the Toronto Islands from a dock at Jack Layton Ferry Terminal in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. ==History== The only car ferry operated by the City of Toronto (all others are owned by Ports Toronto) was built in Owen Sound, Ontario by Russel Brothers and commissioned in 1963 and carries both passengers (220) and vehicles (10 cars or 8 trucks). The latter is for City-owned vehicles that need to access the island. Her namesake is believed to be from the Mohawk word Ongiara, for point of land cut into two. Ongiara was also the name of a former street on the Toronto Islands. ==Operations== The car ferry operates from the mainland ferry terminal over to Hanlan's Point and Wards Island terminals. The ferry can operate year-round as long as the inner harbour is ice free. The only time the ferry did not carry passengers was during the 2010 G20 summit.https://info.publicintelligence.net/G20_ISU_background.pdf ==Specifications== Ongiara in 2017 Details from Transport Canada {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ Specification |- | Gross Tonnage: || |- | Net Tonnage: || |- | Length: || |- | Breadth: || |- | Depth: || |- | Draught: || |- | Self- Propelled Power: || 390 hp twin diesel |- | Speed: || |} ==See also== * Ongiara (1885) * Sam McBride * Thomas Rennie * Trillium * William Inglis ==References== ==External links== Category:Ferries of Ontario Category:Water transport in Toronto ",
