    "text": "Shepherds of Good Hope is a social service organization based in Ottawa, Ontario that operates a homeless shelter, supportive housing facilities, and provides day-to-day services, such as a clothing program, grocery program, and soup kitchen. It is one of the largest homeless shelters in the city that offers services to people of all genders. The Shepherds of Good Hope welcomes people of all faiths and beliefs, and provides three main services: Support Services, Supportive Living and Shelter Services. Shepherds of Good Hope also operates a soup kitchen, and serves approximately 800 sandwiches and 600 whole meals daily to the people of Ottawa who need it most. ==History== Established in 1983, the Shepherds of Good Hope started as an emergency men's and women's shelter and grocery program out of St Brigid's in Lower Town. In 1984, a men's shelter and clothing program opened in the Guigues School, and finally, on October 1, 1985, the soup kitchen, shelter and the Clothing & Grocery programs all moved to their current location, on 233 Murray St, also in Lower Town. The building had once been host to the St-Brigid's School. The first Christmas Hamper program was established a year later, in November 1986, and still continues today providing vital food to over 1000 families for Christmas. In 1988, three new programs were created \u2013 Hope Outreach, Hope Community, and the Hope Centre. All three are targeted at providing housing, whether emergency or long term, for the clients of the Shepherds of Good Hope. In 1990, the Hope School, Hope Recovery, House of Lambs and Hope Discovery Supportive Housing were added to the resources available from the Shepherds of Good Hope (more on each below). However, two years later several programs were cut due to reorganization, including Hope School and House of Lambs. In December 1998, Sophie's hope was started as an effort to create an environment where women could feel safe and would always be accepted. Though not directly affiliated with the Shepherds of Good Hope, Sophie's Hope set up shop inside 233 Murray St. In 1999, the Hope Community and Hope Discovery joined together to create a \u201cSupportive Housing\u201d system of care, which is today one of the three main services offered through the Shepherds of Good Hope. Thirty two extra housing units were opened later in the year to accommodate people suffering from severe mental illnesses, and eighteen housing units for people who require minimal care. In May 2000, the Managed Alcohol Program was introduced, to much controversy, as the experimental program provided participants with controlled amounts of alcohol instead of promoting complete abstinence. In 2002 funding allowed the Shepherds of Good Hope to provide a housing worker for the \u201cSupportive Housing\u201d program in an attempt to help people to find and maintain housing. In 2003, the Shepherds of Good Hope celebrated its 20th anniversary, and opened up 10 new beds for the Managed Alcohol Program. In May 2004, the shelter purchased a building on St-Andrews with the Ministry of Health Funding which became a part of Supportive Living, allowing for 35 housing units to be built for clients who are diagnosed with a mental disorder, but independent enough to live on their own. A year later, Hope Community closed its doors. More recently, in 2009, after several years of searching for a place to relocate the Supportive Housing, the Shepherds of Good Hope purchased an old hotel to move its residents that could be living in Supportive Housing but are still in the shelters, in an effort to remove people from the drugs so readily available in Lower-town Ottawa. Residents are currently moving to their new Carlington Street location,Cook, Maria \u201c The Shepherds of Good Hope's move to Carlington: \u201cWe're In A Bit Of A Storm\u201d\u201d The Ottawa Citizen.

It is equipped with 57 beds and provides 3 meals a day, shower, laundry and hygiene supplies, safer injection supplies and clean clothing. Additionally, Hope Outreach has on-site psychiatric nurses, medical help, and addiction assessment and support. Hope Outreach also hosts a pilot project targeting homeless people who are unable to access services for their severe health problems due to their lifestyle. This project is an Inner City Pilot Project, and has been hugely successful. Implemented in 2001, it was running at \u201c100% capacity within 6 weeks of opening\u201d, and grew in number between 2001 and 2003. This project is also being hosted in other shelters in the Ottawa community. ====Hope Recovery==== Hope Recovery provides 21 beds, food, access to hygiene, laundry and medicine storage for women and men under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Hope Recovery accepts clients from other shelters, Police Services, Ottawa Detox and hospitals. Furthermore, clients residing at Hope Recovery are encouraged to seek help for their addictions. ====Managed Alcohol Program==== The Managed Alcohol Program is partnered with the Inner City Health Project. The idea of MAP is to reduce harm to the individual. By allowing for participants in the project to have 5 oz. of home brewed wine or 3 oz. of sherry every hour, the MAP believed that drinking in moderation would reduce binge drinking and the consumption of dangerous substances, such as mouthwash and paint thinners.Cosh, Colby \"A Most Improbable Cure\" Report / Newsmagazine (Alberta Edition), August 10, 2001, Vol. 28 Issue 19, p48 This program targets individuals who have failed other substance abuse treatment programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous, who promote total abstinence from drinking. Questionnaires were handed out to the MAP participants as well, to record and properly study their past alcohol use, daily activities and health. The program began with 12 subjects, but has increased to 22. Studies conducted at the University of Ottawa after an average of 16 months participation from subjects showed that the number of emergency department visits, police altercations and alcohol consumption all lowered for participants of the MAP. It was reported that overall hygiene and compliance with medical care also increased. Additionally, the average of drinks per day for a single subject dropped from 46 to 8. ===Supportive Housing=== The Shepherds of Good Hope run 4 Supportive Living housing units, targeted at helping clients become more independent, while still tending to their needs for support and supervision. ====Hope Living Residence==== Hope Living is a 35 unit residence for people diagnosed with severe mental disabilities. It is staffed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Hope living is made possible through the help of the following partnering agencies: Royal Ottawa Health Care Group, the Sandy Hill Community Centre, the John Howard Society, C.M.H.A., and A.C.T.T.. Clients of the Hope Living residence are encouraged to develop life skills in order to reintegrate into the community. ====St. Andrew's Residence==== This 35 unit housing centre contains both single and double occupancy units for clients diagnosed with a mental illness but who are independent enough to have a more independent lifestyle. Staff is only employed on as-needed basis, and only interested residents partake in skill training. This centre boasts a true sense of community and has many active clubs for the residents. ====Hope Living==== Sophie's Hope is a women's shelter established by Francine Pelletier. Pelletier started this shelter as a homage to a woman she had been working with in the past, who was an IV drug user that had developed AIDS and was also pregnant. Pelletier came up with the idea of this shelter when she noticed that several establishments would not allow Sophie on their premises because of her active drug use. There was a need for a safe place where women could be allowed access regardless of their condition. Sophie's Hope is not an overnight shelter, but is open from 4 pm to midnight and provides a place for women to eat, enjoy entertainment, play a game of cards, or just enjoy conversation with fellow women. Many women benefit from this program, as the opening hours keep them off the streets and away from drugs and prostitution. Although the Shepherds of Good Hope are not exclusively affiliated with Sophie's Hope, they allowed for the women's shelter to open in the main Shepherds of Good Hope building, at 233 Murray St., in 1998. Sophie's Hope has been at its own independent location since 2000. ====The Oaks==== In 2009, the Shepherds of Good Hope purchased 2 buildings in the Carlington area of Ottawa, which they have turned into housing for their clients who qualify for Supportive Housing but are still living in the downtown shelters. Formerly the Cardinal Suites Motel, the new wellness centre has been named The Oaks, and strives to help its new residents with living in their own apartments, as well as promote wellness. Controversy has surrounded this project since news broke that 55 homeless people would be moving to Carlington. 250 people presented themselves to a Carlington meeting to protest the move, as they feared that the already existing prostitution problem would be made worse by what the homeless people could be bringing to the neighbourhood \u2013 crime, drugs and alcohol. Despite this controversy, 55 people have moved into The Oaks, which has 24-hour staffing and surveillance, is a gated facility to control access to the grounds and minimize trouble that could occur. ==References== ==External links== * Category:Non-profit organizations based in Ottawa Category:Homeless shelters in Canada ",
