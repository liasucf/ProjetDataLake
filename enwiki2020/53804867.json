    "text": "Hecla is a ghost town in Laramie County in the U.S. state of Wyoming. Although not posted, what remains of the stamping and smelting facilities is located on private property. ==History== The area around Hecla was mined for copper from the 1860s to the 1960s by the Calumet and Hecla Mining Company which was a merger between the Calumet Company and the Hecla company. It became one of the major copper mining companies in the United States. At one point, Hecla was being considered as a stop for the Union Pacific Railroad, but it didn't gain enough attention and the proposal was dropped. ==Literature== In the book Hell Hole by Hunter Shea, the main character is asked by President Teddy Roosevelt to investigate a mine in Hecla. ==References== ==External Links== *Hell Hole by Hunter Shea Category:Populated places in Laramie County, Wyoming Category:Ghost towns in Wyoming ",
