    "text": "Julian \"J-Rock\" Williams (born April 5, 1990) is an American professional boxer. He held the WBA (Super), IBF, and IBO light middleweight titles from 2019 to January 2020. As of September 2019, Williams is ranked as the world\u2019s best active light middleweight by The Ring magazine and the Transnational Boxing Rankings Board, and third by BoxRec. ==Amateur career== Williams started boxing at the age of 12. He had an amateur record of 77-10. He reached number five in the rankings at national level, although never won a national tournament.https://www.ringtv.com/355411-qa-julian-williams/ Williams' trainer, Stephen Edwards, said that Williams' preparation as an amateur boxer was erratic, so began working on a more rigorous training regime as Williams turned pro.http://www.maxboxing.com/news/max-boxing-news/julian-williams-and- stephen-edwards-head-toward-the-light ==Professional career== Williams made his professional debut in May 2010, beating Antonio Chaves Fernandez technical knockout (TKO) in the first round. In April 2013, Williams became the second fighter to stop journeyman Dashon Johnson, improving his record to 12\u20130\u20131 with a third-round TKO. In his next fight, Williams won a unanimous decision (77-72, 77-72, 77-72) over former world champion Joachim Alcine. Alcine was dropped three times, but he rallied and won the final three rounds, landing significant shots on Williams. The prospect would survive and take the win.https://www.badlefthook.com/2013/6/22/4455538/malignaggi-vs-broner- results-julian-williams-vs-joachim-alcine Williams next faced fellow prospect Hugo Centeno Jr., but the fight ended in a no contest after an accidental headbutt.http://www.boxingscene.com/hugo-centeno-julian-williams-ends-no- contest--69553 On 10 December 2016, Williams challenged IBF champion Jermall Charlo. Charlo retained his title with a fifth-round stoppage of Williams. Charlo dropped Williams in the second round with a powerful jab. Williams came back and fought a clever fight, making Charlo miss, slipping punches, and landing some good counters. In round five, Charlo landed a right uppercut, dropping Williams hard. Williams got up, however Charlo went for the finish, and got it with a third knockdown after a barrage of punches ending with a left hook. After the referee stopped the fight, Williams went over to congratulate Charlo. Charlo didn't want to embrace and told Williams, \u201cI don\u2019t want your congratulations, I want your apology.\u201d The crowd, noticing the heat between the two corners, started to boo Charlo. In the post fight interview, Charlo stated Williams had disrespected him leading up to the fight. On 11 May 2019, Williams beat Jarrett Hurd by unanimous decision for the unified light middleweight championship. ==Personal life== Julian was raised in West Philadelphia and is a Muslim. ==Professional boxing record== {|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:95%\" |- ! !Result !Record !Opponent !Type !Round, time !Date !Location !Notes |- |31 |Loss |27\u20132\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jeison Rosario |TKO |5 (12), |Jan 18, 2020 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |30 |Win |27\u20131\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jarrett Hurd |UD |12 |May 11, 2019 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |29 |Win |26\u20131\u20131 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Francisco Castro |KO |2 (8), |Dec 1, 2018 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |28 |Win |25\u20131\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Nathaniel Gallimore | |12 |Apr 7, 2018 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |27 |Win |24\u20131\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Ishe Smith |UD |10 |Nov 18, 2017 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |26 |Win |23\u20131\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joshua Conley |TKO |7 (10), |Jun 30, 2017 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |25 |Loss |22\u20131\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jermall Charlo |KO |5 (12), |Dec 10, 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |- |24 |Win |22\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Marcello Matano |TKO |7 (12), |Mar 5, 2016 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |23 |Win |21\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Luciano Cuello |TKO |1 (10), |Sep 22, 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |22 |Win |20\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Arman Ovsepyan |TKO |6 (10), |Jun 13, 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |21 |Win |19\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Joey Hernandez |UD |10 |Apr 4, 2015 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |20 |Win |18\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jamar Freeman |TKO |8 (10), |Dec 20, 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |19 |Win |17\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Eliezer Gonzalez |UD |8 |Sep 11, 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |18 |Win |16\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Michael Medina |KO |8 (10), |May 24, 2014 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |17 |Win |15\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Freddy Hern\u00e1ndez |TKO |3 (10), |Mar 17, 2014 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| | |- |16 |Win |14\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Orlando Lora |TKO |3 (10), |Dec 7, 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |15 |style=\"background:#ddd;\"|NC |13\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Hugo Centeno Jr. |NC |4 (10), |Sep 12, 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| |style=\"text- align:left;\"| |- |14 |Win |13\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Joachim Alcine |UD |8 |Jun 22, 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |13 |Win |12\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Dashon Johnson |TKO |3 (6), |Apr 20, 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |12 |Win |11\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jeremiah Wiggins |TKO |7 (8), |Jan 26, 2013 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |11 |Win |10\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Jonel Tapia |TKO |7 (8), |Nov 17, 2012 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |10 |Win |9\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text- align:left;\"| Hector Rosario |UD |8 |Apr 28, 2012 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |9 |Win |8\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Eberto Medina |UD |6 |Sep 30, 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |8 |Win |7\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Raul Rodriguez |UD |6 |Jul 22, 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |7 |Draw |6\u20130\u20131 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Francisco Santana | |6 |May 13, 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |6 |Win |6\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Marteze Logan |UD |4 |Mar 19, 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |5 |Win |5\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Allan Moore |TKO |1 (4), |Jan 29, 2011 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |4 |Win |4\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Mario Evangelista | |6 |Dec 3, 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |3 |Win |3\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Wes Parkhurst |TKO |1 (4), |Nov 9, 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |2 |Win |2\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Dean Peters Jr. |TKO |1 (4), |Oct 1, 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |- |1 |Win |1\u20130 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| Antonio Chaves | |1 (4), |May 7, 2010 |style=\"text-align:left;\"| | |} ==See also== *List of light-middleweight boxing champions ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990 births Category:Living people Category:Boxers from Pennsylvania Category:African- American boxers Category:American male boxers Category:World light- middleweight boxing champions Category:World Boxing Association champions Category:International Boxing Federation champions Category:International Boxing Organization champions Category:Sportspeople from Philadelphia Category:African-American Muslims ",
