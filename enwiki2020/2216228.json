During the 2008 Beijing Olympics, she was often referred to by commentators as \"The Yellow Beast\", denoting her dominance in the sport. She uses a specially made Zhang Yining ZLC for her blade made by butterfly, and tenergy 05 for forehand and tenergy 64 for her backhand. Zhang is a graduate from Beijing Shichahai Sports School, where Li Jiawei of Singapore studied as well. Zhang was married in October 2009 and has not been present in table tennis tournaments since then. She announced her retirement from international play in 2011 and she went to the United States to study at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison and learn to better speak English. This makes her one of few players to retire whilst holding both the World and Olympic titles for singles and team event in table tennis.
