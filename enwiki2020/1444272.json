The lines and the spaces between the lines function like the wires or rods on an abacus. The place value is marked at the end. Jetons or jettons are tokens or coin-like medals produced across Europe from the 13th through the 18th centuries. They were produced as counters for use in calculation on a counting board, a lined board similar to an abacus. They also found use as a money substitute in games, similar to modern casino chips or poker chips. Thousands of different jetons exist, mostly of religious and educational designs, as well as portraits, the last of which most resemble coinage, somewhat similar to modern, non-circulation commemorative coins. The spelling \"jeton\" is from the French; the English spell it \"jetton\". ==Roman calculi== The Romans similarly used pebbles (in Latin: calculi \"little stones\", whence English calculate). Addition is straightforward, and relatively efficient algorithms for multiplication and division were known. ==Arabic numerals== As Arabic numerals and the zero came into use, \"pen reckoning\" gradually displaced \"counter casting\" as the common accounting method. Jetons for calculation were commonly used in Europe from about 1200 to 1700, and remained in occasional use into the early nineteenth century. ==Middle Ages== From the late 13th century to the end of the 14th century, purpose-made jetons were produced in England, similar in design to contemporary Edwardian pennies. Although they were made of brass they were often pierced or indented at the centre to avoid them being plated with silver and passed off as real silver coins. By the middle of the 14th century, English jetons were being produced at a larger size, similar to the groat. Throughout the 15th century, competition from France and the Low Countries ended jeton manufacture in England, but this did not last long. Nuremberg jeton masters initially started by copying counters of their European neighbours, but by the mid 16th century they gained a monopoly by mass- producing cheaper jetons for commercial use. Later \u2013 \"counter casting\" being obsolete \u2013 the production shifted to jetons for use in games and toys, sometimes copying more or less famous jetons with a political background. In the Low Countries, the respective mints in the late Middle Ages in general produced the counters for the official bookkeeping. These mostly show the effigy of the ruler within a flattering text and on the reverse the ruler's escutcheon and the name or city of the accounting office. File:Rekenaar 1553.jpg|Nuremberg, c 1553, moneychanger, \u00d8 28 mm ==16th century onwards== During the Dutch Revolt (1568\u20131609) this pattern changed and by both parties, the North in front, about 2,000 different, mostly political, jetons (Dutch: Rekenpenning) were minted depicting the victories, ideals and aims. Specifically in the last quarter of the 16th century, where \"Geuzen\" or \"beggars\" made important military contributions to the Dutch side and bookkeeping was already done without counters, the production in the North was just for propaganda. The mints and treasuries of the big estates in Central Europe used their own jetons and then had a number of them struck in gold and silver as New Year gifts for their employees who in turn commissioned jetons with their own mottoes and coats-of-arms. In the sixteenth century, the Czech Royal Treasury bought between two and three thousand pieces at the beginning of each year.

They are usually made of metal or hard plastic, and are generally called tokens in English- speaking countries. In German, the word Jeton refers specifically to casino tokens. In Polish, the word \u017ceton, pronounced similarly to French jeton, refers both to tokens used in the vending machines, phones etc., as well to those used in the casinos. The word \u0436\u0435\u0442\u043e\u043d has the same use in Russian, as does the word jeton in Romanian and \u017eetoon in Estonian. However, in Hungary the word zseton is (somewhat dated) slang for money, particularly coins. Plastic jetons are used as a form of fare payment for using the Star Ferry in Hong Kong. === Leisure use === Coloured wooden jetons of the type used in card games Apart from their monetary use in casinos, jetons are used in card games, particularly in France, but also in places like Denmark. They are traditionally made of wood of different shapes and sizes to represent different values such as 1, 5, 10, 50 or 100 points. The jetons are also stained or coloured so that each player can have his or her own colour. Nowadays, plastic jetons are a cheap alternative. Games that typically use jetons include Nain Jaune, Belote, Piquet, Ombre, Mistigri and Danish Tarok. === Other uses === In France and other countries, jeton is also a small (as a token, so to speak) amount of money paid to members of a society or a legislative chamber each time they are present in a meeting. ==References== * * * * ==See also== * Casino token * Devotional medal * Location arithmetic * Telephone token * Gettone Category:Token coins Category:Mechanical calculators Category:Game equipment Category:Gaming devices ",
