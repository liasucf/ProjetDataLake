Martins competed at the 2019 South American U20 Championships where she won gold in both the 100m and 200m events. Martins competed at the 2019 World Championships in Athletics in the 200m and the 4x100m relay events, but failed to make a final in both, as the relay team was disqualified after running what would have been a final qualifying place in the heats. Martins, alongside her relay teammates, won gold in the 4x100m relay event at the 2019 Military World games. Martins is missing her index and ring fingers on her left hand, making it harder to get into position in the starting blocks. == International Competitions == DQ = disqualified {| class=\"wikitable\" |+ !Year !Competition !Venue !Position !Event !Notes |- | rowspan=\"4\" |2017 | rowspan=\"2\" |South American U20 Championships | rowspan=\"2\" |Leonora, Guyana | bgcolor=\"gold\" |1st |100m | |- | bgcolor=\"gold\" |1st |200m | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |IAAF World U18 Championships | rowspan=\"2\" |Nairobi, Kenya |4th |100m | |- |4th |200m | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2018 | rowspan=\"2\" |IAAF World U20 Championships | rowspan=\"2\" |Tampere, Finland |6th |100m | |- |7th |200m | |- | rowspan=\"8\" |2019 | rowspan=\"4\" |South American U20 Championships | rowspan=\"4\" |Cali, Colombia | bgcolor=\"gold\" |1st |100m |11.42 |- | bgcolor=\"gold\" |1st |200m |23.53 |- | bgcolor=\"silver\" |2nd |4x100m relay | |- | bgcolor=\"gold\" |1st |4x400m relay | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2019 World Athletics Championships | rowspan=\"2\" |Doha, Qatar |38th |200m |23.56 |- |DQ |4x100m relay | |- | rowspan=\"2\" |2019 Military World Games | rowspan=\"2\" |Wuhan, China |5th (SF) |200m | |- | bgcolor=\"gold\" |1st |4x100m relay | |} == References == == External links == * Lorraine Martins at IAAF Category:2000 births Category:Living people Category:Brazilian female sprinters Category:Pan American Games medalists in athletics (track and field) Category:Pan American Games gold medalists for Brazil Category:Athletes (track and field) at the 2019 Pan American Games ",
