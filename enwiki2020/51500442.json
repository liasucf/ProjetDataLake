    "text": "The 1974 Arizona Wildcats football team represented the University of Arizona in the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) during the 1974 NCAA Division I football season. In their second season under head coach Jim Young, the Wildcats compiled a 9\u20132 record (6\u20131 against WAC opponents), finished in second place in the WAC, and outscored their opponents, 263 to 174. The team played its home games in Arizona Stadium in Tucson, Arizona. Despite a 9\u20132 record, the Wildcats were not invited to a bowl game due to not winning the WAC (BYU defeated Arizona in their head-to-head matchup to win the WAC) and at the time, under WAC rules, only the conference winner would earn a bowl bid. The team's statistical leaders included Bruce Hill with 1,814 passing yards, Jim Upchurch with 1,004 rushing yards, and Theopolis Bell with 700 receiving yards. Linebacker Mark Jacobs led the team with a school record 200 total tackles.2016 Media Guide, p. 86. ==Roster== ==Game summaries== ===Arizona State=== Arizona shut out ASU, 10\u20130, to capture their first nine-win season in school history and ended a nine-game losing streak against the Sun Devils (Arizona had last defeated ASU in 1964).
