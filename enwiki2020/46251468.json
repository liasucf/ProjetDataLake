The exterior of the edifice is > plain, and almost devoid of ornament. Its interior appearance is light, and > it will be much improved when completely painted and properly furnished. It > is exceedingly commodious, and well adapted for the purpose to which it will > be appropriated - its length is 127 feet, and its width 67 feet. There are > doors on each side of the principal entrance, which admit both into the > galleries and the body of the church. The galleries, which are erected on > each side and at the west end, are, as well as the loft nave, supported by > iron pillars; the galleries for the children of the charity schools are in > recesses on each side of the space which is intended for the organ. The > building will accommodate 2038 persons, 706 sittings being in pews, 1332 in > free seats for the use of the poor - the free seats are in the middle aisle > and on the back parts both of the galleries and the body of the church. The > vestry and robing room are at the east end, on each side of the altar; over > the altar is an appropriately designed and well executed painted window, by > Henderson of Birmingham, which cost 100l. and was raised by subscription. > The estimated expense of the structure was 10,325l. 3s. 6d. of which amount > 3,300l. was contributed by the subscription of the inhabitants, and the > remainder was found by the Parliamentary Commissioners.
