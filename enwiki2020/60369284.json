On March 7, the Spitfire parted ways with head coach Lee \"Bishop\" Beom-joon for undisclosed reasons; Bishop had led the team to a 10\u20134 record until his departure. Struggling as the season went on, the Spitfire had to bank on their earlier results to edge them over the finish line. They ended the season with a record, good for 5th place and a spot in the postseason where they faced the 4th-seeded Los Angeles Gladiators. London lost their first postseason matchup against the Gladiators on July 11 by a score of 0\u20133 in the quarterfinals. The Spitfire turned it around the next two games against the Gladiators, winning in 3\u20130 sweeps in matches two and three and advancing the team to the semifinals. London won both games against the Los Angeles Valiant in the semifinals, winning 3\u20130 in match one and 3\u20131 in match two. === Philadelphia Fusion === On September 20, 2017, Overwatch developer Activision Blizzard officially announced that Philadelphia Flyers owner Comcast Spectacor had acquired the rights to the Philadelphia-based Overwatch League franchise; later the team name was revealed as the Philadelphia Fusion. Shortly afterwards on November 3, their roster was revealed. Philadelphia's season began with a 3\u20132 victory against the Houston Outlaws. While Philadelphia did upset the undefeated New York Excelsior in Stage 1, which marked New York's first lost in the regular season, the team had, overall, an inconsistent season. Philadelphia claimed the sixth, and final, seed of the playoffs on June 15. Fusion defeated third-seeded Boston Uprising in the Quarterfinals by two matches to one. The team went on to face the top-seeded New York Excelsior in the Semifinals, a game the Fusion were considered heavy underdogs. Philadelphia dominated New York in the first match, winning three maps to zero, and took the second match by three maps to two. === Summary of results === {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%; text-align:center; width:500px; \" |+ Qualified playoffs teams |- !

DJ Khaled performed live at the Barclays Center on July 28, prior to the first match of the second day. The performance was streamed live exclusively on Twitch.

DJ Envy performed during breaks on July 28, and opened for DJ Khaled. == Match summaries == === Match one === ==== Map 1: Dorado ==== {| class=\"floatright\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:85%; border:1px solid #ddd; width:250px\" |- ! style=\"text-align:left; width:25%;\" | PHI ! style=\"width:50%;\" | Escort map ! style=\"text-align:right; width:25%;\" | LDN |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | 3 | Checkpoints | style=\"text-align:right;\" | 2 |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | 85.78 m | Distance | style=\"text-align:right;\" | 82.66 m |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | 0:00 | Time remaining | style=\"text-align:right;\" | 0:00 |} {| class=\"floatright mw-collapsible mw-collapsed\" style=\"text-align:center; font- size:85%; border:1px solid #ddd; width:250px\" |- ! style=\"width:33%;\" | ! style=\"width:33%;\" | Lineup ! style=\"width:33%;\" | |- | style=\"text- align:left;\" | EQO | Damage role | style=\"text-align:right;\" | birdring |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | Carpe | Damage role | style=\"text-align:right;\" | Profit |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | SADO | Tank role | style=\"text- align:right;\" | Gesture |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | HOTBA | Tank role | style=\"text-align:right;\" | Fury |- | style=\"text-align:left;\" | Boombox | Support role | style=\"text-align:right;\" | Bdosin |- | style=\"text- align:left;\" | neptuNo | Support role | style=\"text-align:right;\" | NUS |} The first map of the match was escort map Dorado - a map that Philadelphia had a just-under 70 percent win rate in the regular season.
