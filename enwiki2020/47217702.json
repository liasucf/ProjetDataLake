    "text": "Santino Ferrucci (born May 31, 1998 in Woodbury, Connecticut) is an American racing driver. He currently drives the No. 18 SealMaster Honda for Dale Coyne Racing with Vasser-Sullivan in the NTT IndyCar Series. Ferrucci has been a controversial figure in motorsports. In 2018, Ferrucci was fired from his Formula 2 team after accusations of intentionally wrecking his teammate and racist behavior. ==Career== ===2012\u20132013=== At 14 years old, Ferrucci made his professional debut in the SBF2000 Winter Series season, winning three out of ten races in the season, with a further three podiums. ===2013=== Ferrucci made a mid-season debut in the F2000 Championship Series, finishing 5th place in the championship. ===2014=== Ferrucci competed in five races in German Formula Three for EuroInternational, scoring 2nd in his fourth. He also completed three races in British Formula 3 for Fortec Motorsport, scoring a pole and two wins as well as the end of European Formula 3 season, again for EuroInternational. Ferrucci is the youngest winner in British Formula 3 History Reuniting with Fortec, Ferrucci participated in the Macau Grand Prix. Ferrucci finished the main race in 8th. ===2015=== At the start of the year, Ferrucci competed in the Toyota Racing Series for Giles Motorsport. Ferrucci finished the season 3rd overall, scoring his only win at Manfeild and scoring 5 other podiums. Ferrucci returned to European Formula 3, this time with M\u00fccke Motorsport, finishing 11th overall and scoring his only podium in Formula 3 at Spa. At the end of the year, Ferrucci once again raced in the Macau Grand Prix, this time finishing 6th in the main race. ===2016=== Ferrucci moved to the GP3 Series with newcomers DAMS. Ferrucci's best result was a 3rd in the sprint race at Spa-Francorchamps and ended the season 12th in the standings. ===2017=== In February 2017, DAMS retained Ferrucci for a second GP3 season. Competing in only the first three events, and scoring points in only the first two races, Ferrucci made his Formula 2 debut in Hungary and finished the remainder of the year with Trident, with ninth his best result for a race and 22nd in the season standings. ===2018=== Ferrucci, driving for Dale Coyne Racing during testing at Portland in 2018. Ferrucci remained in Formula 2 for 2018, competing alongside Arjun Maini at Trident. In June, Ferrucci made his debut in IndyCar at the Detroit Grand Prix for Dale Coyne Racing as a substitute for Pietro Fittipaldi. Ferrucci retired from his first race after colliding with Charlie Kimball on lap 56. In July, Ferrucci was banned from four F2 races (Hungary and Belgium) after making deliberate contact with his teammate Maini after the Sprint Race at Silverstone on the weekend of the British Grand Prix. He was also disqualified from the Sprint Race results at Silverstone for a separate incident when he deliberately forced Maini off the track. He was also found to have driven his car between the F2 and F1 paddock without one glove and while holding his phone, which resulted in a \u20ac6,000 fine. On July 18, Ferrucci was summarily fired by the Trident F2 team, citing behavioral issues, and non-payment of money required by contract. Trident alleged that money had been made available for the Detroit IndyCar race, whilst noting that Ferrucci had defaulted on F2 debt to them. An Italian court subsequently ordered Ferrucci to pay Trident \u20ac502,000, plus interest and legal fees, for failing to make payments. 6 days later, Trident announced that their GP3 Series driver Alessio Lorandi would be his replacement for the rest of the season. Santino contested the final two rounds of the IndyCar Series season with Dale Coyne Racing. ===2019=== Ferrucci signed with Dale Coyne Racing to contest the full 2019 NTT IndyCar Series season driving the #19 Cly-Del Honda. In his season debut at the Grand Prix of St. Petersburg, Ferrucci recorded a Top-10 finish, bringing his car home in 9th position. At the Indianapolis Grand Prix, he posted his second Top-10 finish of the IndyCar season heading into preparations for his first Indianapolis 500 effort. After qualifying 23rd for the Indy 500, Ferrucci moved through the 33 car field to finish in 7th position, earning him Rookie of the Year honors in his first ever race at the Indianapolis 500. Three races later, Ferrucci recorded his best career IndyCar finish by taking the checkered flag in 4th position at Texas Motor Speedway. === 2020 === After Ferrucci's former teammate Sebastian Bourdais's unceremonious departure from Dale Coyne Racing with Vasser-Sullivan, Santino signed with the team and moved from his #19 Cly-Del Honda to Bourdais's #18 SealMaster Honda. Due to the Covid-19 pandemic the first race of the season came in June at Texas Motor Speedway where Ferrucci finished 21st after a mechanical failure. He bested his previous year's Indianapolis 500 finish of 7th by following up with a top-5 ending up 4th at the end of the race. Ferrucci has seemed to settle into his role as team leader mentoring his rookie team mate Alex Palou who comes from the Japanese GP-3 circuit. Ferrucci is coached by the 1996 CART Champion Jimmy Vasser ===Formula 1=== Ferrucci (right) at Texas Motor Speedway in 2019 After confirmation of Ferrucci's entry into the GP3 Series, he became a test and reserve driver for the Haas F1 Team alongside Ferrari Driver Academy member and GP3 champion, Charles Leclerc. Ferrucci got his first taste of F1 machinery when he tested for Haas at Silverstone after the British Grand Prix. Haas retained Ferrucci as development driver for 2017 and 2018. ==Racing record== ===Career summary=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 90%; text-align:center\" ! Season ! Series ! Team !
