They are represented in all levels of Philippine society and are integrated politically and economically, in the private and government sector. Spanish Filipinos are present within several commerce and business sectors in the Philippines and a few sources estimate companies which comprise a significant portion of the Philippine economy are owned by Spanish Filipinos like International Container Terminal Services Inc., Manila Water, Integrated Micro-Electronics, Inc., Ayala Land, Ynchausti y Compa\u00f1ia, Ayala Corporation, Aboitiz & Company, Union Bank of the Philippines, ANSCOR, Bank of the Philippine Islands, Globe Telecom, Solaire Resort & Casino, to name but a few. ==Demographics== === Background === The term Hispanic broadly refers to the people, nations, and cultures that have a historical link to Spain. It commonly applies to countries once part of the Spanish Empire, particularly the countries of Latin America, the Philippines, Equatorial Guinea, and Spanish Sahara. The Spanish culture and Spanish language are the main traditions. === Spanish Philippines === Between 1565 and 1898, Hispanics from Latin America and Spain sailed to and from the Philippine Islands. This contributed to the assimilation of the Hispanics into everyday society. According to an 1818 study by the renowned German ethnologist F\u00ebdor Jagor entitled The Former Philippines thru Foreign Eyes, not less than one third of the inhabitants of the island of Luzon were descendants of Spaniards, mixed with varying degrees of South American, Chinese, and Indian ancestry and the vast majority of military personnel then had Latin-American origins. ==History== Spanish Philippines is the history of the Philippines from 1521 to 1898. It begins with the arrival in 1521 of European explorer Ferdinand Magellan sailing for Spain, which heralded the period when the Philippines was an overseas province of Spain, and ends with the outbreak of the Spanish\u2013American War in 1898. ===Spanish East Indies=== Cabildo Street, Intramuros, Manila, 1890s The Spanish East Indies (') were the Spanish territories in Asia-Pacific from 1565 until 1899. They comprised the Philippine Islands, Guam and the Mariana Islands, the Caroline Islands (Palau and the Federated States of Micronesia), and for some time parts of Formosa (Taiwan) and the Moluccas (Indonesia). Cebu was the first seat of government, later transferred to Manila. From 1565 to 1821 these territories, together with the Spanish West Indies, were administered through the Viceroyalty of New Spain based in Mexico City. ===Captaincy General of the Philippines=== The Captaincy General of the Philippines (; ) was an administrative district of the Spanish Empire. The Captaincy General encompassed the Spanish East Indies which included the modern country of the Philippines and various Pacific Island possessions, such as the Caroline Islands and Guam. It was founded in 1565 with the first permanent Spanish settlements. For centuries all the political and economic aspects of the Captaincy were administered in Mexico by the Viceroyalty of New Spain, while the administrative issues had to be consulted with the Spanish Crown or the Council of the Indies through the Royal Audience of Manila. However, in 1821, after Mexico became an independent nation, all control was transferred to Madrid. ==Language== La Mestisa Espa\u00f1ola (A Spanish Filipina) by Justiniano Asuncion In Asia, the Philippines, a former Spanish overseas province, was the lone sovereign nation representative of the Spanish language. Spanish was the lingua franca of the country from the beginning of Spanish rule in the late 1500s until the first half of the 20th century. It held official status for nearly half a millennium before being demoted as an optional language in 1987. However, Spanish still remained a very important language up until the mid-20th century but inauspicious circumstances resulted in its gradual decline over the decades.The National Archives (archived from the original on 2007-09-27), Houses the Spanish Collection, which consists of around 13 million manuscripts from the Spanish colonial period. Today, despite groups rallying to revive the language and make it a compulsory subject in schools, it is rarely used in everyday life or official settings and is spoken by less than 0.5% of the population. ===Philippine Spanish=== Philippine Spanish (Spanish: Espa\u00f1ol Filipino, Castellano Filipino) is a Spanish dialect and a variant of Spanish spoken in the Philippines. Philippine Spanish is very similar to Mexican Spanish, because of Mexican and Hispanic American emigration to the Spanish East Indies (Philippines) over the years. It is spoken mostly among Spanish Filipinos. ===Chavacano=== Chavacano or Chabacano is a Spanish-based creole language spoken in the Philippines. The word ' is derived from Spanish, meaning \"poor taste\", \"vulgar\", for the Chavacano language, developed in Cavite City, Ternate, Zamboanga and Ermita. It is also derived from the word chavano, coined by the Zamboangue\u00f1o people. Six different dialects have developed: Zamboangue\u00f1o in Zamboanga City, Davaoe\u00f1o Zamboangue\u00f1o / Castellano Abakay in Davao City, Ternate\u00f1o in Ternate, Cavite, Cavite\u00f1o in Cavite City, Cotabate\u00f1o in Cotabato City and Ermite\u00f1o in Ermita. Chavacano is the only Spanish-based creole in Asia. It has survived for more than 400 years, making it one of the oldest creole languages in the world. Among Philippine languages, it is the only one not an Austronesian language, but like Malayo- Polynesian languages, it uses reduplication. ==Literature== Philippine literature in Spanish () is a body of literature made by Filipino writers in the Spanish language. Today, this corpus is the third largest in the whole corpus of Philippine literature (Philippine Literature in Filipino being the first, followed by Philippine literature in English). It is slightly larger than the Philippine literature in the vernacular languages. However, because of the very few additions to it in the past 30 years, it is expected that the former will soon overtake its rank. List of some famous Spanish Philippine literature: === Doctrina Christiana === The Doctrina Christiana was an early book of Roman Catholic Catechism, written in 1593 by Fray Juan de Plasencia, and is believed to be one of the earliest books printed in the Philippines. Noli Me Tangere ===Noli Me T\u00e1ngere=== Noli Me T\u00e1ngere (Latin for Touch Me Not) is a fictional novel written by Jos\u00e9 Rizal, one of the national heroes of the Philippines, during the colonization of the country by Spain to expose the inequities of the Spanish Catholic priests and the ruling government. Originally written in Spanish, the book is more commonly published and read in the Philippines in either Filipino or English. Together with its sequel, El Filibusterismo, the reading of Noli is obligatory for high school students throughout the country. ===El Filibusterismo=== El Filibusterismo (lit. Spanish for \"The Filibustering\"The Subersive or Subversion, as in the Locs\u00edn English translation, are also possible translations.), also known by its English alternative title The Reign of Greed, is the second novel written by Philippine national hero Jos\u00e9 Rizal. It is the sequel to Noli me tangere and, like the first book, was written in Spanish. It was first published in 1891 in Ghent. The novel's dark theme departs dramatically from the previous novel's hopeful and romantic atmosphere, signifying the character Ibarra's resort to solving his country's issues through violent means, after his previous attempt at reforming the country's system have made no effect and seemed impossible with the attitudes of the Spaniards towards the Filipinos. The novel, along with its predecessor, was banned in some parts of the Philippines as a result of their portrayals of the Spanish government's abuse and corruption. These novels along with Rizal's involvement in organizations that aim to address and reform the Spanish system and its issues led to Rizal's exile to Dapitan and eventual execution. Both the novel and its predecessor, along with Rizal's last poem, are now considered Rizal's literary masterpieces. ===Mi \u00daltimo Adi\u00f3s=== Mi \u00daltimo Adi\u00f3s (English; \"My Last Farewell\") is a poem originally written in Spanish by Philippine national hero Dr. Jos\u00e9 Rizal on the eve of his execution by firing squad on 30 December 1896. The piece was one of the last notes he wrote before his death; another that he had written was found in his shoe but because the text was illegible, its contents today remain a mystery. ==Notable Spanish Filipinos== ==See also== *Latin Union *Hispanic *List of hispanophones *Flag of the Hispanic People *Hispanosphere *Panhispanism *Patria Grande *Manila galleon *Mexican settlement in the Philippines *Filipino mestizo *Filipino people of Spanish ancestry ==References== Category:Spanish Philippines Category:Hispanidad Category:Hispanic and Latino Category:European diaspora in the Philippines ",
