    "text": "Adri\u00e1n Ezequiel Cirigliano (; born 24 January 1992) is an Argentine football midfielder who plays for Zacatepec. ==Club career== Cirigliano made his first team debut for River Plate on April 11, 2010 in a 0\u20130 away draw with Atl\u00e9tico Tucum\u00e1n. At 18, he started the game against Atl\u00e9tico alongside 36-year-old Mat\u00edas Almeyda in midfield. A tough tackling midfielder who is useful on the ball, Cirigliano has been likened to a cross between Xavi and Javier Mascherano. On July 18, 2013, Cirigliano joined the newly promoted Serie A club Hellas Verona on a loan deal. On the first days of July, 2014, Cirigliano returns to River Plate coming back from his loan and attends practice. He refuses to travel to the pre-season in an attempt to negotiate a definitive transfer to Hellas Verona, which subsequently fails. Therefore, coach Marcelo Gallardo separates him from the rest of the squad. On September 10, 2014, after being pardoned by the director, Cirigliano starts practice with River Plate's reserve team in order to re-join the squad and be able to play again. On July 20, 2015, FC Dallas announced the deal has been reached to take the player on-loan from River Plate. Per league policy, terms were not revealed, though the club will be using their Target Allocation Money to help fund the loan-deal. He was released by Dallas in January 2016 and signed on loan by Club Atl\u00e9tico Tigre, resigning contract on May 2016.http://www.fcdallas.com/post/2016/01/22/fc-dallas-waives-midfielders- rolando-escobar-and-ezequiel-cirigliano On July 12, 2017, Cirigliano signed with Zacatepec. ==International career== Cirigliano played for the Argentina national under-17 football team the 2009 South American Under-17 Football Championship and the 2009 FIFA U-17 World Cup, and with the Argentina national under-20 football team the 2011 South American Youth Championship.
