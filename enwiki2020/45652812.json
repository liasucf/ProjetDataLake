    "text": "The Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey (the ACC) is an agricultural cooperative founded by producers on the basis of mutual aid to protect their economic interests and to provide their subsistence and business related needs. Established to benefit from the provisions of law number 1581 on Agricultural Credit Cooperatives and Unions, the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey is a legal entity with replaceable members and capital.https://www.turkiye.gov.tr/turkiye-tarim-kredi-kooperatifleri-birligi == History == The foundation of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey dates back to 1863. The Turkish cooperative movement was started by Midhat Pasha, governor of Ni\u0161 (a city in Serbia which was Ottoman territory at the time), with the establishment of \u201cHomeland Funds\u201d (\u201cMemleket Sand\u0131klar\u0131\u201d) in 1863 and it gained pace with the foundation of the Republic of Turkey as new laws on cooperatives were enacted. The ACC with its modern nomenclature and structure was established based on law number 2836 which was passed in 1935. The ACC\u2019s foundation was supported by the first president of the Republic of Turkey Kemal Atat\u00fcrk who was also the first member of the cooperative in Silifke \u2013 Tekir \u00c7iftli\u011fi. Due to the enforcement of law number 1581 on Agricultural Credit Cooperatives and Unions in 1972, the ACC was able to form regional unions and a central union, which set the basis for a vertical organizational structure. The ACC operated under T\u00fcrkiye Cumhuriyeti Ziraat Bankas\u0131 (Agricultural Bank of the Republic of Turkey) until May 17, 1977, when the Central Union of Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey was officially opened. Since then Ziraat Bankas\u0131 has had no managerial responsibilities towards the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey, yet it has been acting as the ACC\u2019s financing bank. Even though the ACC went under the overall responsibilities of the Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Livestock for a decade (1985\u20131995), today it is an independent farmer organization which owes its current democratic structure to the law number 5330 enacted in 2005.http://www.tarimkredi.org.tr/index.php/tr/hakkimizda/tarihcemiz.html == Organizational Structure == The Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey renders service to its 1.1 million members with 16 regional unions and 1625 cooperatives, 188 service offices and 7244 personnel.http://www.tarimkredi.org.tr/index.php/tr/kurumsal/bolge- birliklerimiz.html Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey is managed by the Board of Directors elected by its members. == Regulations == Law Number 1581 on Agricultural Credit Cooperatives and Unions. == Articles of Association == Articles of Association of the Agricultural Credit Cooperatives of Turkey. == References == Category:Agricultural cooperatives Category:Agriculture in Turkey Category:Organizations established in 1863 Category:Agricultural finance Category:Cooperatives in Turkey ",
