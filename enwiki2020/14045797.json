    "text": "In enzymology, a (\u2212)-menthol monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :(\u2212)-menthol + NADPH + H + O \\rightleftharpoons p-menthane-3,8-diol + NADP + HO The 4 substrates of this enzyme are (\u2212)-menthol, NADPH, H, and O, whereas its 3 products are p-menthane-3,8-diol, NADP, and HO. This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (\u2212)-menthol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (8-hydroxylating). This enzyme is also called l-menthol monooxygenase. ==Uses== Use of (\u2212)-menthol monooxygenase has been explored by several companies including Procter & Gamble for cleaning products.\"Cleaning compositions comprising a specific oxygenase\"|Alfons, Ivan Maurice et al.|https://patents.google.com/patent/EP1002040B2/en \"Methods for conducting assays for enzyme activity on protein microarrays\"|Zhou, Fang X.; Schweitzer, Barry| https://patents.google.com/patent/US7635572B2/en?oq=US7635572B2 \"Cleaning compositions contain a specific oxygenase\"|Barnabas, Mary et al.|https://patents.google.com/patent/DE69727704T3/en ==References== * Category:EC 1.14.13 Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes Category:Enzymes of unknown structure ",
