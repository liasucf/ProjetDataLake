His father Simon Zecanovsky settled in London, shortened the family name to Zec, and raised nine daughters and two sons. He was married for 66 years. After his wife Frances died in 2006 he took up painting, mainly with acrylic paint. In October 2012 he won The Oldie magazine's inaugural British Artists Award (OBA) for artists over the age of 60.\"The Oldie's oldie: 93-year-old wins magazine's artist award\", London Evening Standard, 17 October 2012.\"2012 OBA \u2013 Former Daily Mirror journalist wins first OBA award\" , The Oldie.\"93 year-old Donald Zec Wins Oldie British Artists Award (OBA): Oldest Entrant to The Oldie British Artists Award Declared 2012 Winner\", ArtsLife, 17 October 2012. A year later his portrait of his late paternal grandfather (entitled \"My Grandfather, the Pious Patriarch\") was presented at the Royal Academy Summer Exhibition, jointly winning the Hugh Casson Prize for Drawing.Sharon Wheaton, \"improvement at Royal Academy\", RA Summer Show, 17 June 2013, p. 20.245th Summer Exhibition Prizewinners: The Hugh Casson Drawing Prize \u2013 \"Cat. 626 Donald Zec, My Grandfather, the Pious Patriarch\". Royal Academy of Arts, Annual Report 2013, Appendix 4, p. 43. Donald Zec now lives in Holland Park, London. ==Career== Zec's career in journalism began in 1938 with a three-day trial at the Daily Mirror. Interviewed by Michael Freedland in 2009, he recalled: \"I was so embarrassingly bad that no one had the courage to tell me, so I stayed for 40 years.\"Michael Freedland \"Donald Zec: He scooped them all...\", The Jewish Chronicle, 26 March 2009. Retrieved 7 January 2015. During the war, he served in the London Irish Rifles, returning to the Daily Mirror as a crime reporter. On one occasion, he interviewed the acid-bath murderer John George Haigh in the Onslow Court Hotel. He followed this post by becoming the paper's Royal correspondent, \"which I thought was a natural progression\", he told Freedland. Later, he became a journalist writing about film. In the course of his work he interviewed and wrote about many celebrities from the entertainment industry,\"Donld Zec's Celebrity Scrapbook\", The Jewish Chronicle Online, 24 March 2009. including Humphrey Bogart, Brigitte Bardot, David Niven, Ingrid Bergman, The Beatles, and Marilyn Monroe.\"Donald Zec and Marilyn\", EverlastingStar.net, 1 February 2012. In October 1967 he won a National Press Award as Descriptive Writer of the year, the citation spoke of his \"bland outrageousness and a deadly certainty of aim\". Extending his range, he interviewed major political figures such as a former Chancellor of the Exchequer Selwyn Lloyd, the Labour Prime Minister Harold Wilson, the (then) leader of the Opposition Margaret Thatcher, Lord Mountbatten of Burma and the former Californian Governor Ronald Reagan in 1967, commenting: \"it is a whimsical if not uneasy thought that an ex-movie star of many films that escape instant recollection could one day become President of the United States of America\". In 1970 Zec was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to Journalism. The many books Donald Zec has written include biographies of the Queen Mother,\"Beautiful Snob\", Los Angeles Times, 22 July 1973. Sophia Loren, Barbra Streisand, Elizabeth Taylor and Lee Marvin.
