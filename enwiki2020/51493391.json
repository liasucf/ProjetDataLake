    "text": "His Favourite Collection is a 50 track, 4xCD greatest hits album by Australian country music artist John Williamson. The album was released in August 2016 and peaked at number 9 on the ARIA charts. The album was supported by a national tour between August and November 2016. The lead and only single from the album \"Aussie Girls\" is a tribute to Australian sports women. When asked how he selected the 50 tracks, Williamson said \"I wanted to do a compilation of love songs because I had one of those years ago but there's been a lot more love songs and better ones, so I've got that. I've always wanted to do a tropical one, so there's another CD called Willo Goes Troppo \u2013 which is all my songs about Northern Australia, which tend to have a bit of a calypso feel to it, like \"Cape York Peninsula\" and those songs. The other one is country music ballads and the other one's a sing-along.\" ==Track listing== ==Charts== ===Weekly charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- |- |} ===Year-end charts=== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2016) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Australian Artist Albums Chart | 41 |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 6 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2017) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 27 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2018) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 56 |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (2019) ! scope=\"col\"| Position |- ! scope=\"row\"| ARIA Country Albums Chart | 50 |- |} ==Release history== {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Country ! scope=\"col\"| Date ! scope=\"col\"| Format ! scope=\"col\"| Label ! scope=\"col\"| Catalogue |- ! scope=\"row\"| Australia | 19 August 2016 | | Tailfeather, Warner Music | 5419724752 |- |} ==References== Category:2016 greatest hits albums Category:Warner Music Group albums Category:John Williamson (singer) albums Category:Compilation albums by Australian artists ",
