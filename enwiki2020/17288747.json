    "text": "The Premier League Golden Glove is an annual association football award presented to the goalkeeper who has kept the most clean sheets in the Premier League. In football a team's defense or goalkeeper may be said to \"keep a clean sheet\" if they prevent their opponents from scoring any goals during an entire match. For sponsorship purposes, it has been referred to as the Barclays Golden Glove since its inception during the 2004\u201305 season until the 2015\u201316 season. Since 2017\u201318 season, it is known as the Cadbury Golden Glove. The Premier League was founded in 1992, when the clubs of the First Division left the Football League and established a new commercially independent league that negotiated its own broadcast and sponsorship agreements. Originally, the Golden Glove could only be won outright by a single player; should there have been a tie, the goalkeeper with the superior clean sheets-to-games ratio received the award. However, starting in the 2013\u201314 season, the Golden Glove is shared by goalkeepers with an equal number of clean sheets, regardless of the number of games they played. In 2005, the inaugural Premier League Golden Glove was awarded to Petr \u010cech of Chelsea. \u010cech's 24 clean sheets in a single season remains the current record. Since 2005 \u010cech and Joe Hart have won the award on the most number of occasions with 4 successes, with Cech the only goalkeeper to have won the award with two different teams (Chelsea and Arsenal). Pepe Reina was the first goalkeeper to achieve consecutive wins of the award, managing to do so in 3 consecutive seasons between 2005 and 2008. Joe Hart later repeated the achievement with Manchester City between 2010 and 2013. During the 2008\u201309 season, Edwin van der Sar surpassed \u010cech's previous record of 10 consecutive clean sheets by reaching 14. During his streak, Van der Sar went 1,311 minutes without conceding a goal. In the process, he broke both \u010cech's Premier League record (1,025 minutes), Steve Death's Football League record (1,103 minutes) and also the all-time league record in Britain (1,155 minutes) for most consecutive scoreless minutes. ==Winners== alt=Petr \u010cech playing football. {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" |+Key !scope=\"row\"|Player |Name of the player and number of times they had won the award at that point (if more than one) |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text- align:center; background:#B0C4DE\"| |Indicates multiple award winners in the same season |- !scope=\"row\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#ffb\"| |Denotes the club were Premier League champions in the same season |} {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" |+Premier League Golden Glove winners !scope=\"col\"|Season !scope=\"col\"|Player !scope=\"col\"|Nationality !scope=\"col\"|Club !scope=\"col\"|Clean sheets !scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\"|Ref(s) |- |2004\u201305 !scope=\"row\"| | !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb\"|Chelsea |style=\"text-align:center\"|24 |style=\"text- align:center\"| |- |2005\u201306 !scope=\"row\"| | |Liverpool |style=\"text- align:center\"|20 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2006\u201307 !scope=\"row\"| | |Liverpool |style=\"text-align:center\"|19 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2007\u201308 !scope=\"row\"| | |Liverpool |style=\"text-align:center\"|18 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2008\u201309 !scope=\"row\"| | !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb\"|Manchester United |style=\"text-align:center\"|21 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2009\u201310 !scope=\"row\"| | !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb\"|Chelsea |style=\"text-align:center\"|17 |style=\"text- align:center\"| |- |2010\u201311 !scope=\"row\"| | |Manchester City |style=\"text- align:center\"|18 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2011\u201312 !scope=\"row\"| | !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb\"|Manchester City |style=\"text- align:center\"|17 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2012\u201313 !scope=\"row\"| | |Manchester City |style=\"text-align:center\"|18 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\"|2013\u201314 !scope=\"row\"| | |Chelsea |style=\"text- align:center\"|16 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |bgcolor=\"#B0C4DE\"|2013\u201314 !scope=\"row\"| | |Arsenal |style=\"text-align:center\"|16 |style=\"text- align:center\"| |- |2014\u201315 !scope=\"row\"| | |Manchester City |style=\"text- align:center\"|14 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2015\u201316 !scope=\"row\"| | |Arsenal |style=\"text-align:center\"|16 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2016\u201317 !scope=\"row\"| | !scope=\"row\" style=\"background:#ffb\"|Chelsea |style=\"text- align:center\"|16 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2017\u201318 !scope=\"row\"| | |Manchester United |style=\"text-align:center\"|18 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2018\u201319 !scope=\"row\"|Alisson | |Liverpool |style=\"text-align:center\"|21 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |- |2019\u201320 !scope=\"row\"|Ederson | |Manchester City |style=\"text-align:center\"|16 |style=\"text-align:center\"| |} ==Awards won by nationality== {| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text- align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Country !scope=\"col\"|Total |- !scope=\"row\"| |4 |- !scope=\"row\"| |4 |- !scope=\"row\"| |4 |- !scope=\"row\"| |2 |- !scope=\"row\"| |1 |- !scope=\"row\"| |1 |- !scope=\"row\"| |1 |} ==Awards won by club== {| class=\"sortable wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center;\" |- !scope=\"col\"|Club !scope=\"col\"|Total |- !scope=\"row\"|Manchester City |5 |- !scope=\"row\"|Chelsea |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Liverpool |4 |- !scope=\"row\"|Arsenal |2 |- !scope=\"row\"|Manchester United |2 |- |} ==See also== *List of Premier League goalkeepers with 100 or more clean sheets ==References== Goal Golden Category:Association football player non-biographical articles ",
