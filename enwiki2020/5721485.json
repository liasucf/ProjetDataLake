It houses a tourist center at its base, a ten-story vertical tower, and a horizontal sky bridge that has panoramic views of the city of Ponce and the Caribbean Sea. Visitors can reach the skybridge via glass elevators or a staircase. Made of reinforced concrete, the cross has withstood various natural disasters, including three major hurricanes. The arms of the cross measure 70 feet. It was inaugurated in 1984.Ponce, Puerto Rico: The Pearl of the South. Sandra Scott. Central and South America. 2007. Retrieved 4 December 2009.

The cross sits at the same spot on Cerro del Vig\u00eda where early settlers once looked out for merchant ships and would-be invaders, including marauding pirates. In 1801, the settlers built a much smaller cross made of two intersecting tree trunks where an observer would constantly watch the sea and the city's port, raising different flags to either notify local merchants of incoming trade ships or alert military authorities of possible threats (a replica of this wooden cross now sits behind the current monument). Originally a hut was built accompanied by a cross from where flags were raised to signal the approach of ships as well as their port of origin. This station was run by two brothers Ricardo and Alberto Lugo, they were honored with a plaque at the base of the cross in 1984. They are descendants of Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo last conquistador of Spain.La Cruceta del Vig\u00eda / Cross Watchtower, Ponce, Puerto Rico One of the best remembered watchmen was named Luis Castro. Nearly 200 years ago, Luis would sit atop a huge wooden cross on this hill. On the lookout for ocean vessels, it was his responsibility to determine the nationality of approaching ships. If he recognized the vessel he would raise a flag, but if a ship was thought to be carrying contraband then no flag was raised and the Spanish military would investigate. The Cruceta was built in honor of Mr. Castro and all the other watchmen who so faithfully helped protect the city during its younger years. The Cerro del Vig\u00eda also served as a refugee camp for citizens during the storm of 12 September 1738, the earthquake of 10 May 1787, the tsunami of 18 November 1867, and the American invasion of 25 July 1898.La Cruceta del Vigia.

The garden is located in a 2,223 square meter ground. Its purpose is to encourage spiritual peace and harmony by the means of nature and Zen music. The garden features small lakes, rivers, bonsais, and bridges. ==References== ==Notes== ==External links== *Site dedicated to El Vigia Cross and the Serralles Castle *http://lugocrest.homestead.com/lugocrossponce.html Category:Buildings and structures in Ponce, Puerto Rico Category:Tourist attractions in Ponce, Puerto Rico Category:1984 in Puerto Rico Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1984 Category:Monumental crosses Category:1984 establishments in Puerto Rico Category:Barrio Portugu\u00e9s Urbano ",
