It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. With Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4,3,3,4,3}, it has three tesseractic honeycombs around each cell. It is dual to the order-4 24-cell honeycomb honeycomb. == Related honeycombs== It is related to the regular Euclidean 4-space tesseractic honeycomb, {4,3,3,4}. It is analogous to the paracompact cubic honeycomb honeycomb, {4,3,4,3}, in 4-dimensional hyperbolic space, square tiling honeycomb, {4,4,3}, in 3-dimensional hyperbolic space, and the order-3 apeirogonal tiling, {\u221e,3} of 2-dimensional hyperbolic space, each with hypercube honeycomb facets. == See also == * List of regular polytopes == References == *Coxeter, Regular Polytopes, 3rd. ed., Dover Publications, 1973. .
