    "text": "Barry McKenzie Holds His Own is the 1974 sequel to the 1972 Australian comedy film The Adventures of Barry McKenzie. Returning from the original film is Barry Crocker in the title role, as well as Barry Humphries in the role of Barry's aunt, Edna. Also returning in the director's chair is Bruce Beresford. The then Prime Minister of Australia, Gough Whitlam, along with his wife Margaret Whitlam, made cameo appearances as themselves. Barry Humphries contends that Barry McKenzie was an inspiration for the later film Crocodile Dundee. ==Plot== The film continues directly where The Adventures of Barry McKenzie ended with Barry McKenzie (Barry Crocker) and his aunt Edna returning home to Australia from England. During the flight two henchmen of Count Plasma (Donald Pleasence) (a Dracula-type Minister of Culture from the People's Republic of Transylvania) mistake Edna for the Queen of England and kidnap her during their brief stopover in Paris, believing that she will draw tourists to their country. It is then up to Barry, his identical twin brother the Reverend Kevin McKenzie, his Parisian expatriate Aussie friend \"Col the Frog\" (Dick Bentley) and his other expatriate mates in France and England to head a team of Australian agents to be parachuted into Transylvania and rescue Edna. Barry and Edna return home to Australia and are greeted by Gough Whitlam and his wife. Whitlam makes Edna a dame. ==Cast== *Barry Crocker as Barry McKenzie/Kevin McKenzie *Barry Humphries as Senator Douglas Manton/Edna Everage/Meyer de Lamphrey/buck-toothed Englishman *Donald Pleasence as Count Plasma *Dick Bentley as Col \"The Frog\" Lucas *Ed Devereaux as Sir Alec Ferguson *Roy Kinnear as Bishop of Paris *Don Spencer as quizmaster *Frank Windsor as police sergeant *Derek Guyler as police constable *Arthur English as cockney spiv *Desmond Tester as Marcel Escargot *John Le Mesurier as Robert Crowther *Tommy Trinder as Arthur McKenzie *Chantal Contouri as Zizi *Clive James as Paddy ==Production== Bruce Beresford wanted to make a film of The Getting of Wisdom but was unable to raise finance.
