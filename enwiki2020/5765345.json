    "text": "This is a list of the 94 woredas, or districts, in the Somali Region of Ethiopia, compiled from material on the Central Statistical Agency (CSA) website. It is unclear how many woredas actually exist in the Somali Region, since the names and number of woredas given in the CSA's documents differ between 2005 and 2007,CSA: Summary and Statistical Report of the 2007 Population and Housing Census Results (PDF file), pp. 72-74 and different mapsMap of Somali Region at UN-OCHA (PDF file)Map of Somali Region at Disaster Prevention and Preparedness Agency of Ethiopia (PDF file) show a variety of names and boundaries. The subdivisions of Somali have been changed several times, often due to local clan groups claiming their own woreda,Tobias Hagmann: Beyond Clannishness and Colonialism: Understanding political disorder in Ethiopia's Somali Region, 1991-2004 . In: Journal of Modern African Studies 43(4), 2005 (PDF), p. 12 and the boundary between the Somali and Oromia Regions is disputed, leading to ambiguity over the status of border areas. ==List of districts by zone== ===Dhawa zone== the correct pronunciation of \"Dhawa Zone\" is Dawa Zone.
