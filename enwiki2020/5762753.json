She is deeply rooted in the sean-n\u00f3s singing style of her home on Inis O\u00edrr, one of the Aran Islands. She is a graduate of Celtic Studies from Trinity College Dublin. ==Biography== Her d\u00e9but album An Raic\u00edn \u00c1lainn (pronounced An Rackeen Ah-lyn), was launched in 2002 at the Festival Interceltique in Lorient, Brittany. It was selected by Hot Press music magazine as one of the best folk albums of 2002. It was described by fRoots magazine as \"one of the most sumptuous traditional albums to have emerged for some time.\" Lasairfh\u00edona was the subject of a special documentary on the RT\u00c9 L\u00e9argas television series (directed by Moira Sweeney) in 2002. In 2003, Lasairfh\u00edona sang on Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor's DVD, Goodnight, on the track Thank You, You\u2019ve Been A Lovely Audience. Lasairfh\u00edona performed during this time in venues around Ireland, including the National Concert Hall in Dublin, Town Hall Theatre in Galway and at the Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland. Lasairfh\u00edona also took part in many television and radio programmes. Her song \"Dragonfly\", set to music by Lasairfh\u00edona and Hector Zazou was on the soundtrack for the DVD Play Magazine. This showcased the fashion collection for Fall/Winter 2004/2005 of the designers Prada, Issey Miyake, Manolo Blahnik and Jimmy Chou. In 2004 Lasairfh\u00edona's singing featured on a compilation album of the best emerging Irish music that was produced by the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in Ireland and The Music Board of Ireland to mark the Irish presidency of the European Union. Lasairfh\u00edona's second album was released early in 2006. It is called Flame of Wine, a literal translation of Lasairfh\u00edona's own name. It included newly composed songs in Irish and in English. The album is co-produced by M\u00e1ire Breatnach. The latter also provides some musical accompaniment along with musicians Mary Bergin, Johnny McDonagh, Bill Shanley and Lasairfh\u00edona's brother, MacDara. Also in 2006, Lasairfh\u00edona was nominated for a Meteor Irish Music award. ==Discography== ===Solo albums=== * 2002 \u2013 An Raic\u00edn \u00c1lainn * 2005 \u2013 Flame of Wine * 2016 \u2013 One Penny Portion ===Appearances and collaborations=== * 1998 \u2013 Lights in the Dark (Hector Zazou & Lasairfh\u00edona) * 2003 \u2013 Femmes Celtes (Various artists) * 2003 \u2013 Gaelic Ireland (Various artists) * 2004 \u2013 Rough Guide To Irish Music (Various artists) * 2006 \u2013 The Aran Lifeboat Collection (Various artists) * 2008 \u2013 Celtic Dreamland (Various artists) * 2008 \u2013 Experience Ireland (Various artists) ===DVD appearances=== * 2002 \u2013 Goodnight, Thank You.
