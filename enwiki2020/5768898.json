    "text": "Cyathea amintae is a species of tree fern native to Puerto Rico, where it grows in shaded areas and cloud forest at an altitude of 1000\u20131200 m. The erect trunk may be 1.3 m tall and approximately 5 cm in diameter. Fronds are pinnate and up to 1.6 m long. The rachis is often purplish brown and covered with scales, usually on the underside. The scales range in colour from golden brown to bicoloured (pale with darker margins). Sori occur along each side of the pinnule midvein and indusia are cup-like. In the wild, C. amintae is known to hybridise with Cyathea bryophila and Cyathea portoricensis. With C. bryophila, it forms the fertile hybrid Cyathea \u00d7 dryopteroides. The specific epithet amintae refers to Aminta Kitfield Conant. C. amintae is commonly known as Alsophila amintae due to nomenclatural problems. ==References== * Braggins, John E. & Large, Mark F. 2004. Tree Ferns.
