    "text": "Wahlisaurus is an extinct genus of leptonectid ichthyosaur. The holotype was found in the Scunthorpe Mudstone in Nottinghamshire in 1951 and described for the first time only in 2016 by Dean Lomax . The type species is Wahlisaurus massare. ==Description== Wahlisaurus is so rare that only one skeleton and a single bone have been found. The first specimen consists of a skull and an incomplete skeleton. The second specimen consists of a single coracoid. It shares features, such as a slender and long snout with other leptonectids of that time (e.g. Eurhinosaurus, Excalibosaurus, etc.). The extend of the overbite is minor than that of Eurhinosaurus. Differences can be found in Wahlisaurus` shoulder girdle. In fact both the coracoid and the contact between the coracoid and the scapula possess a foramen.'' ==Etymology== LEICT G454.1951.5 was named in honour of William Wahl and Professor Judy Massare, both specialist in mesozoic marine reptiles.'' ==References== 01 Category:Early Jurassic ichthyosaurs Category:Ichthyosaurs of Europe Category:Fossil taxa described in 2016 ",
