Now a Tell-All Documentary\", Los Angeles Times, October 18, 1996. The book was the subject of several reported lawsuits. On 1 March 1996, the woman referred to as \"Tiffany\" sued the publisher Dove Books, and its executive, Michael Viner.Josh Getlin, \"Titillating Tell-All Triggers a Tawdry Tinseltown Tiff\", Los Angeles Times, April 16, 2006. The action was dismissed by the Superior Court on October 23, 1996, but on July 15, 1999, it was reinstated and remanded for further proceedings by the California Court of Appeal (Second District). In its published opinion, the court noted that \"it appears that defense counsel violated several state wide rules of court and local rules, and that these violations resulted in unnecessary litigation and cost to plaintiff and her attorney in time and money,\" and instructed the Superior Court to consider sanctions against defendants and their attorneys.Datig v. Dove Books, 73 Cal. App. 4th 964, 983 (1999). Linda Hammond sued Viner for sexual harassment. The suit was dropped. In another case, Viner sued Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss for slander, based on statements Fleiss made on a radio talk show about Viner and authors of the book. In 2000 a jury ruled in Fleiss's favor.David Robb, \"Fleiss Cleared Of Slander In Viner's Lawsuit\", The Hollywood Reporter, August 28, 2000.
