It offers a simplified visa procedure for entrepreneurs by cutting red-tape and providing a range of tax and labour regulation benefits. To qualify for it, the entrepreneur applicant must prove the innovative character of the business idea ; and show access to \u20ac50,000 in investment capital for the business. === Lithuania === In 2017 in March Lithuania launched a Startup Visa program entrepreneurs from outside the EU to set up operations in Lithuania. . === Netherlands\"Start-up Netherlands\", Dutch Immigration and Naturalisation Service, 2017 === Startup founders are offered the startup visa - a one year residence permit for the Netherlands - if they satisfy the following criteria: * Collaboration with a reliable and experienced Netherlands-based facilitator. * The product or the service is innovative. * The start-up entrepreneur has a (step-by-step) plan in order to move from idea to business. * The start-up entrepreneur and the facilitator are both registered in the Trade Register of the Chamber of Commerce. * There are sufficient financial means (resources) to be able to reside and live in the Netherlands (minimally 13000\u20ac).\"Start-up Amsterdam\" After the course of the year, the startup entrepreneur may be granted an extended residence permit \u2013 as long as they satisfy the standard requirements for the Dutch government's self-employment scheme. === New Zealand\"Changes to Business Policies effective from 24th March 2014\" , Immigration New Zealand website, 25 March 2014 === Entrepreneurs and start-ups founders have now a new option since March 2014, the Entrepreneur Work visa.

Visa decisions are promised within 10 working days, and residence permit decisions in 20 days. === United Kingdom\"Government 'rolls out the red carpet' for entrepreneurs and investors\", UK Border Agency, March 16, 2011 === Entrepreneurs and start-ups founders are offered three visa options depending on their situation and the length of their stay. The Entrepreneur Visa, the Graduate Entrepreneur Visa and the Prospective Entrepreneur Visa. === United States of America === In the U.S., the startup visa was a proposed amendment to the U.S. immigration law to create a visa category for foreign entrepreneurs who have raised capital from qualified American investors (Startup Visa Act of 2011, as introduced on March 14, 2011). The Startup Visa Act had bi-partisan support but was not passed into law. ==== Background ==== Foreign entrepreneurs who find themselves wanting to start a company in the United States are faced with no or limited visa options.'Promising Progress for Immigrant Entrepreneurs and Start-ups,' The few visas offering residency and thus a path to citizenship applicable to entrepreneurs are visa categories such as the EB-1 visa, or the EB-5 visa, which were not designed for entrepreneurs in particular, and can only apply to an extremely limited number of entrepreneurs. Employment-based visas such as the EB-2 visa are not viable options for entrepreneurs and can be denied on the ground of the applicant owning significant stake in the sponsor company. ==== Requirements ==== The new legislation provides visas to the following groups under certain conditions:\"Bill Text 112th Congress (2011-2012) S.565.IS\", The Library of Congress # Entrepreneurs living outside the U.S.\u2014if a U.S. investor agrees to financially sponsor their entrepreneurial venture with a minimum investment of $100,000. Two years later, the startup must have created five new American jobs and either have raised over $500,000 in financing or be generating more than $500,000 in yearly revenue. # Workers on an H-1B visa, or graduates from U.S. universities in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or computer science\u2014if they have an annual income of at least $30,000 or assets of at least $60,000 and have had a U.S. investor commit investment of at least $20,000 in their venture. Two years later, the startup must have created three new American jobs and either have raised over $100,000 in financing or be generating more than $100,000 in yearly revenue. # Foreign entrepreneurs whose business has generated at least $100,000 in sales from the U.S. Two years later, the startup must have created three new American jobs and either have raised over $100,000 in financing or be generating more than $100,000 in yearly revenue. ==== Use of Existing Visa Numbers ==== The Startup Visa does not allocate any new visa numbers but draws from unused numbers out of the EB-5 visa category (investor green card) which is limited to 9,940 visas, of which only 4,191 visas were used in fiscal year 2009.Angus Loten, \"Wall Street Journal\", Kerry, Lugar Re-Start Start-Up Visa, March 15, 2011 The office of Senator Lugar stressed the following statement \"The creation of new visas is not authorized in this bill.\"Senator Lugar, Kerry-Lugar-Udall Visa Bill Will Create Jobs in America, Press Release of Senator Lugar, March 14, 2011 In perspective, the U.S. admitted 1.13 million new legal permanent residents in the US in 2009, of which, only 12.7% were admitted through a selective process or \"Employment-based\" categories.U.S. Legal Permanent Residents: 200, Department of Homeland Security, April 2010 ==== Legislative History ==== * The Startup Visa Act of 2010 was introduced in Senate on February 24, 2010, and was left to expire in the Judiciary Committee at the end of the 111th Congress with no further legislative action having been taken on it. * In a second attempt, the Startup Visa Act of 2011 was introduced in Senate on March 14, 2011. However, it was again left to expire in the Judiciary Committee at the end of the 112th Congress and not enacted. * The Startup Visa Act of 2013 has been introduced in the Senate on January 30, 2013 and is currently awaiting Committee review. It has to undergo a review with the respectives Judiciary committees and the Immigration subcommittees of the Senate and the House. According to Govtrack.us, \"The majority of bills and resolutions never make it out of committee\".\"Status\", Govtrack.us ==== The Obama Administration ==== While the Startup Visa enjoys bi-partisan support and the White House have been repeatedly voicing support to principles relating to it, the Obama Administration have not been aggressively pushing the Startup Visa Act, even through the Startup America initiative, introduced in January 2011. During a conversation hosted by The Economist on March 24, 2011, Aneesh Chopra, the United States CTO, responded the following to Vivek Wadhwa's question about the Startup Visa: \"The President has been emphatically clear, his support for high-skill immigration, but to do so as part of a broader, comprehensive immigration reform program\".\"STARTING UP AMERICA?\", The Economist, March 30, 2011 This approach has drawn criticism from some supporters of the Startup Visa who see the White House as wanting to delay the bill for an undetermined length of time in order to include it in a Comprehensive Immigration Reform broadly covering legal and illegal immigration, viewed as politically \"toxic\" for the Startup Visa Act.\"Startup Visa D.O.A., and Startup America Just a Giant Press Release?\", Vivek Wadhwa, March 30, 2011 ==== In the Media ==== Some actual immigration mishaps which the Startup Visa hopes to address have been covered in the documentary film Starting-Up In America, released on February 28, 2011.Brad Feld, \"Startup in America\", Fast Company, March 2, 2011 == Countries Without a Specific Visa for Entrepreneurs == === France === Currently France does offer a resident permit called Comp\u00e9tences et talents (Competencies and Talents) that grants visa for entrepreneurs that \"are likely to make a significant or lasting contribution, through their skills or talents, to France's economic development or to its intellectual, scientific, cultural, humanitarian or athletic prestige, and directly or indirectly, to that of their own country\". Pour la promotion de l'Immigration Professionelle: Comp\u00e9tences et Talents\" This said, it is possible and often easier for entrepreneurs that want to start a company in Europe to come under the EU Blue Card or secondment route rather than apply for a Competencies and Talents resident permit. A new Entrepreneur route was launched in May 2015: the FrenchTech Ticket. === Italy === In theory, there are two visas options available for an Entrepreneur to start a business in Italy: a groundbreaking startup visa, which is reserved for innovative business ideas (see above); and a 'standard' self-employed visa (residence permit). Migrant Entrepreneurs to Italy can also choose to enter the country via the 'standard' self-employed visa. The process requires the applicant to apply for a work permit (nulla osta) from within Italy. The applicant therefore must appoint an agent to complete the application in Italy. The minimum start up funds for this visa is a mere \u20ac4,962.36 but vary depending on the planned business, in contrast to the \u20ac50,000 investment required for the Italian Startup Visa. Nevertheless, the applicant must prove that there are no barriers of entry for their startup and in essence work closely with the Italian Chamber of Commerce in order to succeed with their application. Website of the Italian Chamber of Commerce\" === Germany === Unless a recent graduate in Germany, applicants will have to show access to \u20ac500,000 in investment funds and that the business will create at least 5 job opportunities in Germany. Cooperation with the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce is required to succeed with the application. \" === Spain === Required investment funds depends on the business plan and estimations - the Spanish authorities take decisions on a case by case basis. === Lithuania === The Startup Visa gives access to migration procedure for temporary residence permit in Lithuania. A temporary residence permit to live in the country for one year, with the possibility to extend for an additional year. 1) The startup must operate in one of the following fields: * Biotechnologies * Nanotechnologies * Information Technologies * Mechatronics * Electronics * Laser Technologies 2) Applicants must legally be at least a part owner of the newly founded firm. 3) Applicants must have enough financial resources to achieve set business goals for 1 year. EU citizens that want to open a business in Lithuania, do not need a residence permit. == How do Governments Decide which Entrepreneur to Allow in? == Most entrepreneur visas available worldwide are temporary but will eventually lead to residency if the entrepreneur proves to be successful (except Canada, which provides immediate permanent residency). As a general rule, these countries evaluate the entrepreneurial migrant application upon the economic interests the individual's business idea and project it represent for the country's economic growth. Entry requirements and the definition of success vary between countries, though it typically comes down to two key parameters: \u2022 What level must entrepreneurs and their businesses reach to qualify for entry and residency? \u2022 How quickly the above has to happen? Most countries assess the potential of an entrepreneur by considering the startup's capital (its amount and source) and the individual's profile (education or business background and/or business proposal). A graph summarising existing entrepreneur visa schemes around the world can help the read and comparison of the different schemes.Entrepreneur Visa Report, Migreat march 2014\" Migreat.com, UK Entrepreneur Visa Report, March 26th, 2014 The criteria are often modulated and flexible, making it easier for certain individuals to qualify. For example, in New Zealand, the Entrepreneur Work Visa is a three-year work visa that works in two stages (a Start-up stage and a Balance stage) to allow entrepreneurs to enable throughout time that they qualify to the visa. There is also a waive of the initial investment capital requirement for \"businesses in science, ICT, or other high value export-oriented sector, which demonstrate a high level of innovation or credible short-term high growth prospects\".http://www.immigration.govt.nz/migrant/stream/invest/entrepreneur/entrepreneurworkvisa/requirements.htm In Canada, the initial investment required is of $118k if from VCs but only of $45k if from Angels and none if the entrepreneur is accepted in by a business incubator program. Some countries also offer simplified routes for recent graduates from that country - notably Germany and the UK. In most countries, eligibility to renew entrepreneur visas or to convert to permanent residency is assessed by the number of jobs created by the startup and either the additional investment raised or the revenue created in a specific timeframe. In the UK, for example, entrepreneurs are expected to create two full-time jobs in three years to renew their visa, whereas in Singapore, to be granted a two-year visa extension entrepreneurs must create two local jobs in their first year and four in the second. Typically, the tight deadlines on reaching these goals are justified by enabling the early identification of genuine businesses. They can, however, have harmful consequences for startups by discouraging risk-taking and preventing entrepreneurs from making rational changes to their business plans that would compromise their visa statuses. It was for precisely for this reason that modifications were made to Ireland's entrepreneur visa program. These changes removed the requirement on job creation, on the basis that, for some businesses, it can take longer to get off the ground than others. == Alternatives == === Blueseed === A company called Blueseed aims to create a startup community located on a vessel moored in international waters near the coast of Silicon Valley in the United States. The promoters believe that the location would enable non-U.S. startup entrepreneurs to work on their ventures without the need for a US work visa, while living in proximity to Silicon Valley and using relatively easier to obtain business and tourism visas. This workaround has been compared to the Startup Visa as it aims to accomplish similar goals. Craig Montuori, an evangelist for the Startup Visa, writes of Blueseed that \"I can vouch for their passion on creating workarounds for jobs creating foreign entrepreneurs while waiting for Congress to create a Startup Visa as someone who has been advocating for Startup Visa for the past year.\"Blueseed on AngelList == References == == External links == * Full Text of the StartUp Visa Act of 2011 * UK Entrepreneur Visa Report: An evaluation of the UK Entrepreneur visa implementation and results Category:United States federal immigration and nationality legislation ",
