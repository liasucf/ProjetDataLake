The Act was part of a comprehensive proposal for the stabilization of domestic production and prices of beef and regulation by quota of foreign beef importation. A subsidy measure was imposed by tariff levied on foreign beef, while Australian and New Zealand producers were favoured. The Act was superseded in its entirety by the Agriculture Act 1957. ==External links== *Information about the Act on Parliament's website ==References== Category:United Kingdom Acts of Parliament 1937 ",
