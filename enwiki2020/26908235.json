    "text": "Sevillana, or, as the composer titled it Sevilla\u00f1a (Sc\u00e8ne Espagnole),Although he called it the fictitious Spanish Sevilla\u00f1a, the composer may have been aware of the correct spelling \"Sevillana\", and this is combined with a French subtitle 'Sc\u00e8ne Espagnole' (Spanish Scene). is a short piece for orchestra by the English composer Edward Elgar written in 1884 and published as his Op. 7\\. It was first published by Tuckwood, with the composer's revision of 1889 published by Ascherberg in 1895.Kennedy, p. 278 It was dedicated to W. C. Stockley, conductor of the Birmingham Festival. Elgar's violin teacher, Adolf Pollitzer showed the score to the conductor August Manns who included it in a Crystal Palace concert on 12 May 1884.Moore, pp. 103-6 This was shortly after its first performance, on 1 May, at a Worcester Philharmonic Society concert conducted by the organist of Worcester Cathedral, William Done. The piece was composed when he was a young man of 26, shortly after the break-up of his engagement to Miss Helen Weaver. ==Instrumentation== 2 flutes (second also piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 2 horns, 2 cornets, 2 trombones, bass trombone, tuba, percussions (snare drum, tambourine, bass drum, cymbals, triangle) and strings. ==Structure== Allegro moderato 3/8 g minor The work commences with a rhythmic lively 3/8 episode, characteristic of the Spanish Sevillana dance.
