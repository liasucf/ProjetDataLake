    "text": "Arion Baroque Orchestra, founded in 1981, is a Canadian baroque orchestra based in Montreal, Quebec, specializing in music of the 18th century performed on period instruments. == History == Arion Baroque Orchestra was founded in Montreal in 1981 (first under the name of Arion Ensemble). Originally, it was a quartet whose members included flautist Claire Guimond, violinist Chantal R\u00e9millard, harpsichordist Hank Knox, and viola da gamba player Betsy MacMillan. The ensemble's name comes from the Greek mythology : Arion is a musician from antiquity who avoided drowning by charming a dolphin with his singing. It is also the name of a cantata by Andr\u00e9 Campra that was played at the first concert of the group. Since the mid-1990s, the original quartet has expanded with the aim of developing into a baroque orchestra, and thus began to explore the repertoire from the 2nd half of the 18th century, most notably the music of Haydn and Mozart. Flautist Claire Guimond, was the sole artistic director of the orchestra from 1981 to 2019. During the 2019-2020 season, the artistic direction was shared with bassoonist Mathieu Lussier who will succeed her in the following 2020/2021 season. Arion Baroque Orchestra does not have a principal conductor and prefers to collaborate with invited soloists and leaders. Some of the collaborators Arion has shared the stage with over the years are sopranos Suzie LeBlanc and Karina Gauvin, recorder player Vincent Lauzer, violinists Stefano Montanari, Enrico Onofri, and Monica Huggett, cellist Jaap ter Linden, harpsichordists Christophe Rousset, Garry Cooper, and Alexander Weimann, flautist Barthold Kuijken, and clarinettist Lorenzo Coppola. Arion Baroque Orchestra toured Qu\u00e9bec, Canada, the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Japan,. and Europe. Arion has a residency at Bourgie Hall of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, where it has an annual subscription series of five programs. The orchestra also performs at other venues in Montreal, most notably through the Conseil des arts de Montr\u00e9al touring program, but also at the main music festivals across Quebec and Canada such as Domaine Forget, the Montreal Bach Festival, the Ottawa Chamberfest, and the Lam\u00e8que International Baroque Music Festival in New Brunswick. == Awards and distinctions == The orchestra received several awards and distinctions for its recordings and concerts: 9 Prix Opus, of the Conseil Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois de la Musique, 2 F\u00e9lix Awards, of ADISQ, 1 Juno Award of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, and 1 Diapason d'Or from the French music magazine Diapason. == Discography == The discography of Arion Baroque Orchestra comprises around thirty titles on four labels: early-music.com, ATMA Classique, Analekta, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. * 1985 : Leclair, Hotteterre and Guillemain \u2013 Entre Paris et Versailles * 1990 : Quantz, Graun, Couperin, etc. \u2013 Baroque chamber music with recorder, with Marion Verbruggen (recorder) * 1991 : Telemann \u2013 Paris Quartets [MVCD1040] * 1993 : Telemann, Quentin et Mondonville \u2013 Conversations en musique * 1994 : Cl\u00e9rambault, Campra and Mont\u00e9clair \u2013 Four Major French Cantatas from the 17th and 18th Centuries, with Dani\u00e8le Forget (soprano) * 1995 : Bach \u2013 The Musical Offering * 1995 : Un concert en Nouvelle-France, with Richard Duguay (tenor) * 1996 : Bach \u2013 6 Trio Sonatas, BWV 525-530 * 1997 : Telemann \u2013 Tafelmusik (first production) * 1997 : O\u2019Carolan\u2019s Harp, with Siobhan McDonnall (Celtic harp) * 1997 : Boismortier \u2013 Les Quatre Saisons, with Isabelle Desrochers (soprano), Herv\u00e9 Lamy (tenor) and Max van Egmond (baritone) * 1998 : Leclair \u2013 Concertos, with Claire Guimond (flute) and Monica Huggett (violin and direction) * 2001 : Bach \u2013 Orchestral suites, with Claire Guimond (flute), Chantal R\u00e9millard (violin), Hank Knox and Luc Beaus\u00e9jour (harpsichords), directed by Barthold Kuijken * 2001 : Bach \u2013 Suites and Concertos, directed by Jaap ter Linden * 2001 : Handel \u2013 Sacred Arias, with Daniel Taylor (countertenor), directed by Monica Huggett * 2002 : Handel \u2013 Love Duets, with Suzie LeBlanc (soprano), Daniel Taylor (countertenor) and Stephen Stubbs (lute, baroque guitar and direction) * 2003 : Vivaldi, Handel and Scarlatti \u2013 Maria, Madre di Dio, with Agn\u00e8s Mellon (soprano) and Matthew White (countertenor), directed by Monica Huggett * 2005 : Faustina Bordoni \u2013 Visages d\u2019une Prima Donna, with Kimberly Barber (mezzo soprano), Jonathan Carle (baritone), directed by Monica Huggett * 2005 : Telemann \u2013 Tutti flauti ! with Matthias Maute and Sophie Larivi\u00e8re (recorders), Claire Guimond and Mika Putterman (flutes), directed by Jaap ter Linden * 2006 : Vivaldi \u2013 Chiaroscuro with Claire Guimond (flute) and Mathieu Lussier (bassoon) * 2007 : Telemann \u2013 Les tr\u00e9sors cach\u00e9s, directed by Jaap ter Linden * 2007 : Rebel \u2013 Plaisirs champ\u00eatres, directed by Daniel Cuiller * 2008 : Corrette \u2013 Symphonies des no\u00ebl et Concertos comiques * 2009 : Haydn, La Passione \u2013 Symphonies 41, 49 et 44, directed by Gary Cooper * 2010 : CPE Bach \u2013 Symphonies and concertos, with Claire Guimond (flute) and Gary Cooper (harpsichord and direction) * 2012 : Bach \u2013 St John Passion, with Les Voix Baroques, directed by Alexander Weimann * 2012 : Handel, Vivaldi and Vinci \u2013 Prima Donna, with Karina Gauvin (soprano) and Alexander Weimann (direction) * 2014 : Hidden Treasures of Italy \u2013 Violin Concertos by Lidarti, Razetti, Montanari, Nardini and Sirmen, with Stefano Montanari (violin and direction) * 2017 : Quantz and Telemann \u2013 Rebelles Baroques, with Claire Guimond and Alexa Raine-Wright (flutes), Jean-Louis Blouin (viola) and Alexander Weimann * 2017 : Bach \u2013 Magnificat, with Johanna Winkel and Johanette Zomer (sopranos), James Laing (countertenor), Zachary Wilder (tenor), Matthew Brook (bass), directed by Alexander Weimann * 2018 : Vivaldi \u2013 Concertos for Recorder, with Vincent Lauzer (recorder), directed by Alexander Weimann * 2020 : Telemann \u2013 Concertos and Overture, with Vincent Lauzer (recorder), Mathieu Lussier (bassoon and direction) and Alexander Weimann (direction) == Notes et references == == External links == * Official website of Arion Baroque Orchestra * Official website of Orchestras Canada Category:Baroque music groups Category:Early music orchestras Category:Canadian orchestras Category:Chamber music groups Category:Musical groups from Montreal ",
