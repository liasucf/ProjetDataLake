    "text": "The Northeast Conference (NEC) Men's Basketball Player of the Year is an annual college basketball award given to the Northeast Conference's most outstanding player. The award was first given following the 1982\u201383 season, when the league was known as the ECAC Metro Conference. The most well- recognized NEC Player of the Year is Marist's Rik Smits, who won the award in 1987 and 1988. Smits went on to have a successful National Basketball Association (NBA) career for 12 seasons (1988\u20132000), all with the Indiana Pacers. In 1998, Smits was named an Eastern Conference All-Star. LIU has the most winners with eight, all of whom represented Long Island University's Brooklyn campus before the school merged the athletic programs of its Brooklyn and Post campuses in July 2019. Robert Morris, which left the NEC for the Horizon League in 2020, is in second with six. All charter members of the Northeast Conference that are still members have had at least one winner. ==Key== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- | style=\"background-color:#CFECEC;\" | \u2020 |Co- Players of the Year |- | style=\"background-color:#FFE6BD\" |* |Awarded a national Player of the Year award: Helms Foundation College Basketball Player of the Year (1904\u201305 to 1978\u201379) UPI College Basketball Player of the Year (1954\u201355 to 1995\u201396) Naismith College Player of the Year (1968\u201369 to present) John R.
