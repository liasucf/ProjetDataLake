She competed at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro where she finished 44th in the individual competition. In doing so, Billys became the first Puerto Rican eventer to compete at the Olympics since 1988. She was eligible to represent Puerto Rico in the event because her grandmother is Puerto Rican. Billys also competed at two Pan American Games (in 2011 and 2015). Her best result came in 2015 when she achieved 18th place. ==International Championship Results== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text- align:center\" |- ! colspan=\"11\" align=\"center\" | Results |- !
