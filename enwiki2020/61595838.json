It was officially opened in August 2019 by its patron Princess Benedikte. 10,000 people had visited the camp. ==History== The island became available for sale in 2010 at a price of 75 million Danish kroner. Two scout organisations, Det Danske Spejderkorps and KFUM-spejderne, bought the island in April 2015 for 20 million kroner (\u00a31.94M) with money donated by the A. P. M\u00f8ller and Nordea funds. The two Danish scout organisations intend to develop the facility, at a cost of 25 Million euros, as an adventure playground \"for the development of children and young people \" (not just scouts) \"into active, engaged and curious people who take the lead for positive social change\", with space for 400 campers. A youth summit entitled \"Young Europe Cares\" was hosted by youth activist group \"Young Europe Is Voting\"/Youth4Europe at the Ungdoms\u00f8en in May 2019. ==Previous usage== Christian IX's government constructed the fort between 1890 and 1894. The fortress remained an active military installation until 1984; in 2002 it was sold to a private investor. The fort had been used as a hotel, with 200 rooms linked by 2 miles of corridors. == References == ==External links== * * * Danish language wikipedia article Category:Campsites Category:Scouting and Guiding in Denmark Category:2019 establishments in Denmark ",
