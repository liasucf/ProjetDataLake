    "text": "Joseph Allen Frear Jr. (March 7, 1903 \u2013 January 15, 1993) was an American businessman and politician. A Democrat, he served as a United States Senator from Delaware from 1949 to 1961. ==Early life== J. Allen Frear was born on a farm near Rising Sun, in Kent County, Delaware, to Joseph Allen and Clara (n\u00e9e Lowber) Frear. His mother died in 1922, and his father subsequently married her brother's daughter. Frear was a distant relative of Robert Freer, who served as chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. One of three children, he received his early education at local public schools, and graduated from Caesar Rodney High School in 1920. Frear studied at the University of Delaware in Newark, where he received a bachelor of science degree in agriculture in 1924. Following his graduation, he became operator of three farms and president of a retail business that distributed milk, fuel, farm machinery, and fertilizer. He served as commissioner of Delaware State College in Dover (1936\u20131941) and of the Delaware Old Age Welfare Commission (1938\u20131948). Also interested in banking, he was director (1938\u20131946) and chairman of the board (1946\u20131948) of the Federal Land Bank in Baltimore, Maryland. During World War II, he served as a major in the U.S. Army from 1944 to 1946. From 1947 to 1951, he was president of Kent General Hospital in Dover. ==Political career== Frear was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1948, defeating incumbent Republican Senator C. Douglass Buck in a close race. During this term, he served in the Democratic majority in the 81st and 82nd Congresses, and the Democratic minority in the 83rd Congress. He was again elected to the U.S. Senate in 1954, defeating Republican Representative Herbert B. Warburton by a wider than expected margin. During this term, he again served with the Democratic majority in the 84th, 85th, and 86th Congresses. Frear did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1960, while not voting on the Civil Rights Act of 1957. Frear narrowly lost his bid for a third term in 1960 to Republican Governor J. Caleb Boggs. In all, he served from January 3, 1949 to January 3, 1961. After leaving the Senate he was appointed to the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1961 until 1963 and resumed his former business and banking pursuits. ==Death and legacy== Frear died at Dover and is buried in the Odd Fellows Cemetery at Camden, Delaware. The J. Allen Frear Federal Building at 300 South New Street in Dover is named in his honor. There is also an Allen Frear Elementary School in Camden. {|class=wikitable style=\"width: 94%\" style=\"text-align: center;\" align=\"center\" |-bgcolor=#cccccc !colspan=7 style=\"background: #ccccff;\" |Public Offices |- !
