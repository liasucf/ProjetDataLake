    "text": "Suleiman Mirza (; b. 28 March 1554, Nakhchivan \u2013 d. 30 October 1576) was a Safavid prince. The son of king Tahmasp I (r. 1524\u20131576) by his Circassian wife Sultan-Agha Khanum, he functioned several years as an official, serving as the governor (hakem) of Shiraz (1555\u20131557/58, under a laleh) and Mashhad (1567\u20131573, under a laleh as well). His full sister was Pari Khan Khanum, and his Circassian uncle Shamkhal Sultan \u2013 both extremely pivotal figures in Safavid affairs during the latter half of the 16th century. During the last few years of Tahmasp I's life, when a protracted competition for the throne was evident, as well as much jockeying for position by the rival factions, a number of Qizilbash chiefs decided, in 1574, to openly support Suleiman Mirza as heir apparent. When his half-brother Ismail Mirza Safavi (who succeeded as Ismail II) was eventually enthroned on 22 August 1576, the latter ordered for the systematic murder or blinding of any prince of royal blood who could become the center of a conspiracy against him. As a result, Suleiman Mirza was killed on 30 October 1576 by the order of his own half-brother. He was buried at the Shrine of Imamzadeh Hossein in Qazvin, the then royal capital. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * Category:1554 births Category:1576 deaths Category:Iranian people of Circassian descent Category:16th-century Iranian people Category:Safavid governors of Shiraz Category:Safavid governors of Mashhad Category:Safavid princes Category:People executed by the Safavid dynasty Category:Executed royalty Category:People from Nakhchivan Category:16th-century people of the Safavid Empire Category:Fratricides ",
