He was elected in 2017. ==History== The Presidency of Ecuador has been marked by periods of instability, causing the office to change presidents frequently throughout the history of the country. At least five times, the duties of the president have been charged to a provisional government or a military junta. Often, the office has been left to an interim or acting president, many of whom would go on to become president. The President who has served the most terms in office is Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Velasco Ibarra, who served five. Before president Rafael Correa, the last president to serve out his complete term in office was Sixto Dur\u00e1n Ball\u00e9n, who served from 1992 to 1996. ==List of presidents== ==Latest election== {| class=wikitable style=text-align:right !colspan=2 rowspan=2|Candidate !rowspan=2|Party !colspan=2|First round !colspan=2|Second round |- !Votes !% !Votes !% |- |style=background-color: | |align=left|Len\u00edn Moreno||align=left|PAIS Alliance||3,716,343||39.36||5,062,018||51.16 |- |style=background-color:; | |align=left|Guillermo Lasso||align=left|Creating Opportunities||2,652,403||28.09||4,833,389||48.84 |- |style=background-color:; | |align=left|Cynthia Viteri||align=left|Social Christian Party||1,540,903||16.32|| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"6\" | |- |style=background- color:#FFA500; | |align=left|Paco Moncayo||align=left|||634,033||6.71 |- |style=background-color:#FF0000; | |align=left|Abdal\u00e1 Bucaram, Jr.||align=left|Fuerza Ecuador||455,187||4.82 |- |style=background- color:#4F86F7; | |align=left|Iv\u00e1n Espinel Molina||align=left|Fuerza Compromiso Social||299,840||3.18 |- |style=background-color: | |align=left|Patricio Zuquilanda Duque||align=left|Patriotic Society Party||72,679||0.77 |- |style=background-color:#DC143C; | |align=left|Washington Pes\u00e1ntez||align=left|Movimiento Uni\u00f3n Ecuatoriana||71,107||0.75 |- |colspan=3 align=left|Invalid/blank votes||1,022,812||\u2013||740,167||\u2013 |- |colspan=3 align=left|Total||10,470,174||100||10,635,574||100 |- |colspan=3 align=left|Registered voters/turnout||12,816,698||81.63||12,816,698||82.98 |- |colspan=8 align=left|Source: CNE, CNE |} ==References== ==See also== *Ecuador *Presidents of Ecuador *Vice President of Ecuador ==External links== *Official website of the Ecuadorian government on their presidential history *Edufuturo's website on Presidents of Ecuador Ecuador Category:Presidents of Ecuador Presidents Presidents Category:1830 establishments in Ecuador ",
