He was regarded by others of his generation as a leader and a man of distinct individualism. He won a scholarship to Eton where he was known as 'cleverest boy in England', then to his father's alma mater Magdalen College, Oxford, where he obtained a first class degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics. He subsequently became a Prize Fellow of All Souls. His Finals examiner at Oxford, after giving him eight alphas, wrote: \"He wrote as though it were all beneath him; he wrote as though it were all such a waste of his time.\"\"The Fatal Englishman\" Sebastian Faulks, page 305 Wolfenden was recruited by the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) before becoming the Daily Telegraph foreign correspondent in Moscow where he indulged in his twin passions for sex and alcohol and was eventually compromised by the KGB. He struck up friendships with Guy Burgess, the British defector, and Martina Browne, the nanny employed by Ruari and Janet Chisholm, who were working for SIS and were instrumental in the defection of Oleg Penkovsky \u2014 a colonel in Soviet military intelligence \u2014 who was responsible for disabusing the Kennedy administration of the myth that the 'missile gap' was in the Soviet's favour. Wolfenden subsequently came under pressure from both SIS and the KGB while in Moscow and swapped roles with the Telegraphs Washington D.C. correspondent, where he married Martina Browne. He died aged 31 in what appeared to be suspicious circumstances in Washington D.C.. It was claimed he had fainted in the bathroom, cracked his head against the washbasin and died of a cerebral haemorrhage. It is now thought likely that he died of liver failure brought on by his excessive drinking. Wolfenden's own views survive. For instance, in a letter to Michael Parsons, an Oxford friend, from Paris, January 1961: > \"There is just no such thing as anyone\u2019s real personality. Personalities are > the product of the initial feelings or attitudes someone takes up and the > needs of the situation they find themselves in...and, for that matter, the > initial feelings themselves are the product of earlier conflicts of that > sort. There is a dialectic of personality, just as there is dialectic of > history (and it\u2019s just as unpredictable).\"Sebastian Faulks The Fatal > Englishman, page 305 A short biography of Wolfenden appears in the book The Fatal Englishman by Sebastian Faulks.Jane Gardam, The fragile Englishmen, The Guardian, 4 February 2006. Julian Mitchell's play Consenting Adults (2007), screened by BBC Four, is based on the relationship of father and son, played by Charles Dance and Sean Biggerstaff respectively.Philip French \"We saw the light, but too late for some\", The Observer, 24 June 2007 Biggerstaff won a BAFTA Scotland for Best Television Actor for his performance. == References == * The Independent on Sunday, 17 November 2006, The Spy Files: Real-life escapades, Category:1934 births Category:1965 deaths Category:Alumni of Magdalen College, Oxford Category:British male journalists Category:British spies against the Soviet Union Category:Fellows of All Souls College, Oxford Category:LGBT people from England Category:Gay men Category:People educated at Eton College Category:People from Uppingham Category:Secret Intelligence Service personnel ",
