    "text": "Benjamin Jacques Marcel Pavard (; born 28 March 1996) is a French professional footballer who plays as a defender for Bayern Munich and the France national team. Although usually deployed as a centre-back, he is also capable of playing as a right-back. He began his career at Lille in Ligue 1 and transferred to VfB Stuttgart in 2016, where he won the 2. Bundesliga in his first season. In January 2019 he agreed a move to Bayern Munich, which was completed after Stuttgart's relegation at the end of the season. In his first full season with the club, he won the Bundesliga, DFB-Pokal and Champions League as part of a treble. Pavard made his international debut for France in November 2017, and won the 2018 FIFA World Cup. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Maubeuge, Nord, near the Belgian border, Pavard first played with his hometown club in Jeumont, where former France international striker Jean-Pierre Papin also began his career. Pavard joined Lille's academy at the age of nine. He made his Ligue 1 debut on 31 January 2015 against FC Nantes, playing the full game in a 1\u20131 away draw. Pavard made 21 league appearances across two seasons for Lille, before leaving the club in 2016. ===VfB Stuttgart=== On 30 August 2016, Pavard moved to VfB Stuttgart, signing a four- year contract. He made his debut in the 2. Bundesliga on 3 October, scoring in a 4\u20130 home win over SpVgg Greuther F\u00fcrth. He played 21 games and his team ended the season as league champions. Pavard made his Bundesliga debut on 19 August in a 2\u20130 loss at Hertha BSC. He scored his first goal in the Bundesliga with a delightful back header on 29 October in a 3\u20130 win over SC Freiburg at the Mercedes-Benz Arena. He extended his contract with Stuttgart on 20 December 2017 until 30 June 2021. He was one of only four players to feature in every single second of the 2017\u201318 Bundesliga season. He played in several positions, namely right-back, centre-back, defensive midfielder and right wing, but after the appointment of Tayfun Korkut as manager in January 2018 he was exclusively a centre back; the team conceded 10 goals in their last 14 games as they went from near the relegation places to finish 7th, only just missing out on a UEFA Europa League place. In 2018\u201319, Pavard was again a regular as Stuttgart fought relegation all season, which was confirmed with defeat to 1. FC Union Berlin in a playoff. ===Bayern Munich=== On 9 January 2019, Bayern Munich confirmed Pavard would join the club for the 2019\u201320 season, signing a five-year contract lasting until 30 June 2024. He made his competitive debut on 3 August in a 2\u20130 defeat in the 2019 DFL-Supercup against Borussia Dortmund, as an 80th-minute substitute for Thiago Alc\u00e2ntara. On 31 August he scored for the first time to equalise in a 6\u20131 home win over 1. FSV Mainz 05. ==International career== On 6 November 2017, Pavard was selected by France's head coach Didier Deschamps for the friendly matches against Wales and Germany. He made his debut against the Welsh on 10 November in a 2\u20130 win at the Stade de France, replacing Christophe Jallet at half time. On 17 May 2018, he was called up to the 23-man French squad for the 2018 FIFA World Cup in Russia. On 16 June, Pavard made his World Cup debut in a 2\u20131 victory over Australia. On 30 June, Pavard scored his first international goal, a long range shot from outside the penalty area, in a 4\u20133 victory over Argentina in the World Cup's round of 16. The goal was later voted as goal of the tournament and nominated for goal of the year. He also became the first French defender to score a goal in the World Cup since Lilian Thuram scored against Croatia in the 1998 semi-final. Pavard won the World Cup, after starting all of France's games except for their last group match against Denmark. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |+ Appearances and goals by club, season and competition |- !rowspan=2|Club !rowspan=2|Season !colspan=3|League !colspan=2|Cup !colspan=2|League Cup !colspan=2|Europe !colspan=2|Other !colspan=2|Total |- !Division||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals||Apps||Goals |- |rowspan=3|Lille |2014\u201315 |rowspan=2|Ligue 1 |8||0||0||0||0||0||colspan=2|\u2014 |colspan=2|\u2014||8||0 |- |2015\u201316 |13||0||1||0||3||0||colspan=2|\u2014 |colspan=2|\u2014||17||0 |- !colspan=2|Total !21||0||1||0||3||0||0||0||0||0||25||0 |- |rowspan=4|VfB Stuttgart |2016\u201317 |2.
