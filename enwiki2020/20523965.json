    "text": "Mysteries is an album by jazz pianist Keith Jarrett recorded in two sessions in December 1975. Originally released by Impulse! in 1976, it features performances by Jarrett's 'American Quartet', which include Dewey Redman, Charlie Haden and Paul Motian along with Guilherme Franco added on percussion. The December 1975 Mysteries sessions also produced the album Shades. The album was included in the 1996 four disc Mysteries: The Impulse Years 1975-1976, a box-set which also included Shades and Jarrett's two final albums for Impulse, Byablue and Bop-Be.\"Mysteries - Impulse Years 1975-76 [Box Set\" at amazon.com] In October 2011, Shades was reissued with Mysteries in a single disc format titled Mysteries / Shades, as part of the Impulse! 2-on-1 series. ==Background: American Quartet's last sessions== As Neil Tesser details on his extensive notes found in the compilation album Mysteries: The Impulse Years 1975-1976 (which contains all the tracks recorded in that period, including alternate takes) this was the story of Jarrett's American Quartet last \"marathon recording sessions\" taking place in December 1975 and October 1976: ==Reception== The AllMusic review by Richard S. Ginell awarded the album four generous stars (out of 5), but at the same time states \"Another in Impulse's extensive series of Keith Jarrett Quintet (sic) recordings, this LP isn't one of the more coherent products of the run. It opens on a faltering note with the hopelessly diffuse and rambling Rotation, and Everything That Lives Laments doesn't really get going until a lyrical Vince Guaraldi-like statement from Jarrett sets the track in motion.\" and that \"The Coltrane-ish 15-minute title track [Mysteries] has passages of meditative beauty and others of listless torpor. For completists only.\"Ginell, R. Allmusic Review accessed September 15, 2011 On the positive camp, writing for jazz.com Ted Gioia gave the track Everything That Lives Laments a rating of 95/100 and praised it: Gioia, Ted The Dozens: Essential Keith Jarrett by Ted Gioia at Jazz.com accessed September 2020 ==Track listing== :All compositions by Keith Jarrett. # \"Rotation\" \u2013 11:03 # \"Everything That Lives Laments\" \u2013 10:04 # \"Flame\" \u2013 6:10 # \"Mysteries\" \u2013 15:22 ==Personnel== *Keith Jarrett \u2013 piano, Pakistani flute, wood drums, percussion *Dewey Redman \u2013 tenor saxophone, maracas, tambourine, Chinese musette, percussion *Charlie Haden \u2013 bass *Paul Motian \u2013 drums, percussion *Guilherme Franco \u2013 percussion ==Technical personnel == * Esmond Edwards \u2013 producer * Tony May \u2013 recording engineer * Tom Wilkes \u2013 art director * Kendun Recorders \u2013 mixing and mastering * Keith Jarrett \u2013 cover photograph == References == Category:Keith Jarrett albums Category:Impulse!
