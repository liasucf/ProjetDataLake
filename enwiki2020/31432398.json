Profile Japan Electric Association, accessed 2011-04-07 It currently has around 4,800 corporate and individual members. ==Activities== The JCA has a number of committees that set national technical guidelines (JEAGs), codes (JEACs) and standards covering areas ranging from electrical safety to the design of nuclear power stations Work Japan Electric Association, accessed 2011-04-07 some of which are regarded as optional 'independent standards of the private sectors' while others have official status as the 'standards of academic societies and associations'.Convention on Nuclear Safety; National Report of Japan for Fourth Review Meeting Government of Japan, published September 2007, accessed 2011-04-07 The JCA also acts as the main lobby group for the Japanese power companiesJapan Nuclear Energy Drive Compromised by Conflicts of Interest Bloomberg, published 2007-12-12, accessed 2011-04-11 and is active in promoting nuclear power. Among its other work, the JCA promotes education, publishes a range of books and guides, and holds lectures, seminars and cultural events. Since 1942 the ECA has published The Denki Shimbun (The Electric Daily News), founded in 1907 as the Electrical News.Important dates in the history of The Denki Shimbun The Denki Shimbun, accessed 2011-04-07 ===Nuclear power=== Through the work of its committees, the JCA prepares and publishes a number of codes and guides for the Japanese nuclear power industry, including the Rules of Quality Assurance for Safety of Nuclear Power Plants (JEAC 4111-2003) and the Guideline for Development and Design of Computerized Human-Machine Interface in the Central Control Room (JEAG 4617-2005), intended to meet the performance requirements specified under the Electricity Utilities Industry Law As of 2007, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency were engaged in the process of evaluating certain standards produced by the JEA and others for technical adequacy. There have been allegations that the JEA wields too much power in setting standards. Professor Katsuhiko Ishibashi, one of the seismologists on a Japanese government subcommittee that produced the 2006 Regulatory Guide for Reviewing Seismic Design of Nuclear Power Reactor FacilitiesRegulatory Guide for Reviewing Seismic Design of Nuclear Power Reactor Facilities Nuclear Safety Commission, published 2006-09-19, accessed 2011-04-06 claimed that the review process was 'unscientific'\"Quake shuts world's largest nuclear plant\" Nature, vol 448, 392-393, , (July 25, 2007) Retrieved March 18, 2011 and the outcome rigged to suit the interests of the JEA, which had 11 of its committee members on the 19-member government subcommittee and that among other problems the guide was 'seriously flawed' as a consequence because it underestimated the design basis earthquake ground motion.Katsuhiko Ishibashi, \"Why worry?
