    "text": "Scott Douglas Perunovich (born August 18, 1998) is an American professional ice hockey defenceman currently under contract as a prospect for the St. Louis Blues of the National Hockey League (NHL). He was drafted by the Blues in the second round, 45th overall, in the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. While playing with the University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth, Perunovich was named to the AHCA East First-Team All-American, the NCHC First All-Conference Team, All-Tournament Team, NCHC All-Rookie team, NCHC Offensive Defenseman of the Year, NCHC Rookie of the Year and Hobey Baker Award. Internationally, Perunovich has represented the United States at the 2015 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, where they finished in fifth place, and the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships, winning a bronze medal. ==Personal life== Perunovich was born to parents Jim and Susan Perunovich on August 18, 1998, in Hibbing, Minnesota. He began figure skating lessons at the age of four before eventually joining a hockey team. Although his uncle Doug Torrel played for the Bulldogs from 1988\u20131992 and was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in the 1987 NHL Entry Draft, Perunovich wished to attend the University of Minnesota due to their teams success. ==Playing career== Perunovich attended Hibbing High School from 2014 to 2017, during which he played three seasons of prep school hockey and tennis. While playing for the Hibbing High School Bluejackets Bantam A team in 2014, he was drafted by the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders of the United States Hockey League (USHL). He opted to continue to play for Hibbing High School, where he led the team to a 37\u201310\u20135 record and was named a finalist for Bantam Player Of the Year. In 2015, Perunovich committed to play Division 1 hockey for the University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs starting in the 2017\u201318 season. Team USA head coach Derek Plante, who had helped Minnesota recruit Perunovich, called him a \"very crafty, a smart hockey player.\" The 2015\u201316 season proved to be one of his best both on the ice and tennis court. As a junior, Perunovich and Jake Jolowsky won the Section 7A doubles title and qualified for the Minnesota high school boys tennis state tournament for a third consecutive season. Overall, he won 80 percent of his matches and was named the Mesabi Daily News, Hibbing Daily Tribune, and Grand Rapids Herald Review Tennis Player of the Year. In January 2016, Perunovich joined the U.S. National Under-18 Team for two games against St. Cloud State. After his senior year, Perunovich then played one season with the Cedar Rapids RoughRiders during which he struggled being away from home and recorded the worst plus- minus in the league. ===Collegiate=== Perunovich played for the University of Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldogs from 2017 to 2020, where he enrolled in the College of Liberal Arts to major in Communications. Perunovich played 42 games for the Bulldogs during the 2017\u201318 season and recorded his first collegiate goal in a 4\u20133 loss to Michigan Tech on October 7, 2017. Perunovich ended his freshman season with 36 points, tying fourth nationally among all defenseman and third for freshman. As a result of his outstanding play, Perunovich was named an AHCA East First-Team All-American, NCHC First All-Conference Team, NCHC All- Rookie team, All-Tournament Team, NCHC Offensive Defenseman of the Year, and NCHC Rookie of the Year. He was the first Minnesota\u2013Duluth Bulldog to be named Rookie of the Year and Offensive Defenseman of the Year and set a new Bulldogs record for most points by a freshman defenceman. His prolific freshman season helped the Bulldogs win the NCAA National Championship title and he was named to the NCAA Frozen Four All\u2013Tournament Team. He was also the first NCHC player to be awarded the Tim Taylor Award as men's Division I National Rookie of the Year. Perunovich with Andy Strickland (left) at the 2018 NHL Entry Draft Perunovich's strong play during his rookie season earned him a midterm ranking by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau, for an eventual final rank of 102nd overall for North American Skaters eligible for the 2018 NHL Entry Draft. When asked to compare his skating, Perunovich says he models his game after NHL defenseman Torey Krug. Bulldogs coach Scott Sandelin also often referred to him as a \"fourth forward.\" After he had been passed over in his first two years of eligibility, the St. Louis Blues drafted Perunovich in the second round of the draft on the word of their scouts, Keith Tkachuk and J Niemiec, that he was worth the chance. Perunovich returned to the Bulldogs for his sophomore season. On October 23, 2018, Perunovich was named the NCAA First Star of the Week after he recorded six points in two back-to-back games against the Maine Black Bears. On January 17, 2019, Perunovich was nominated for the Hobey Baker Award and later for the Offensive Defenseman of the Year. Perunovich helped lead the Bulldogs to the 2019 NCHC Tournament with 27 points, where they competed in the first round against the Omaha Mavericks. On March 13, Perunovich was again selected for the NCHC First All-Conference Team. Although the Bulldogs won the first game of the series against Omaha, Perunovich was forced to sit out due to injury. After returning to the ice, Perunovich helped the Bulldogs defeat St. Cloud State 3\u20132 to qualify for the NCAA Championship. He was also named the winner of NCHC Offensive Defenseman of the Year for the second consecutive season. In the first round of the 2019 NCAA Championship, Minnesota-Duluth beat Bowling Green State University 2\u20131 in overtime to advance to the second round where they faced the Quinnipiac Bobcats. On March 31, the Bulldogs qualified for the Frozen Four with Perunovich recording an assist in the 3\u20131 win over the Quinnipiac Bobcats. After beating the Providence Friars 4\u20131, Perunovich was named an AHCA East Second-Team All-American. On April 13, the Bulldogs went on to clinch another NCAA Championship title after a 3\u20130 win over the UMass Minutemen. On July 28, 2019, Perunovich committed to another year with the Bulldogs and proved once again to be an asset to the team. During his junior season, Perunovich ranked second in the National Collegiate Hockey Association (NCHA) in assists with 34 and becoming the first defenceman to lead the NCHA in scoring. After his collegiate season was suspended due to COVID-19 pandemic, Perunovich signed a contract with the St. Louis Blues allowing him to play with the team if the NHL season continues. He was later announced the winner of the 2020 Hobey Baker Award for being the top National Collegiate Athletic Association men's ice hockey player and NCHC Offensive Defenseman of the Year for the third consecutive season. Perunovich became the sixth Bulldogs player in the team's history to receive the Hobey Baker Award. ===Professional=== Following the conclusion of his junior year with the Bulldogs, Perunovich signalled the end of his collegiate career by agreeing to a two-year, entry-level contract with draft club, the St. Louis Blues, on March 28, 2020. ==International play== Perunovich has represented the United States at various international tournaments at the junior level. In 2015, he was invited to participate with Team USA at the 2015 Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament, where they finished in fifth place. In December 2017, Perunovich was selected for the United States men's national junior ice hockey team preliminary roster prior to the 2018 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships. After making the final cut, he scored one goal and two assists during the tournament to help Team USA win a bronze medal. His only goal of the tournament came during the first outdoor World Juniors game to eliminate a two-goal deficit and beat Team Canada 4\u20133. ==Career statistics== ===Regular season and playoffs=== {| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"text-align:center; width:60em\" |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" ! colspan=\"3\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Regular season ! rowspan=\"100\" bgcolor=\"#ffffff\" | ! colspan=\"5\" | Playoffs |- bgcolor=\"#e0e0e0\" !
