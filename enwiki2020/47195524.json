From 2005 to 2006, she was a guest professor for painting in the Kunsthochschule Wei\u00dfensee Berlin. After residing in New York, Istambul, and Rome in Villa Massimo, Casa Baldi Olevano Romano, she now lives and works in Berlin. 2009 she was appointed as art professor at the State Academy of Fine Arts Karlsruhe and works, since then, at the external campus Freiburg. == Artistic work == Doll's pictures often show diverse everyday objects, which structure and influence our lives in the way we are often not aware of. Cardboard cups, suitcases, electronic devices, lorries or cars are depicted in large, realistic paintings and are subjects to a detailed analysis by the means of art. The focus on a single object allows taking a distance from the automatic way of seeing it, to look at it from a different point of view and to recognize social and political contexts behind it. \"Doll's painting begins with social reality as well as with the question of images and symbols to represent the processes of this reality and their subjective assimilation.\". === Technique and material === Tatjana Doll, Ferrari F430, 2005 In her works, Tatjana Doll investigates the possibilities and the borders of painting as well as \"its potential to disclose social processes and our perception of them\". The predominantly realistic style appears even stronger due to the oversized formats. The artist often works with the same motive across a series of pictures and therefore lets the moment of accident integrate the pictorial interplay. Tatjana Doll finds the way to express the confrontation of perfection and failure, integrity and breach. The material plays a great role \u2013 the artist works with enamel, the shiny surface of which frequently gets cracks, paint puddles, and waves.
