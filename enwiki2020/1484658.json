    "text": "Us is the sixth studio album by the English singer-songwriter and musician Peter Gabriel, released on 28 September 1992 by Real World Records. Following the release of his soundtrack album Passion in 1989, Gabriel started work on new material for a new album, his first since So, which became his biggest selling release. Gabriel focused on personal themes on Us, including his divorce in the late 1980s, his subsequent relationship with actress Rosanna Arquette, and the growing distance between himself and his first daughter. Us was promoted with an early form of interactive multimedia software for Macintosh computers entitled Xplora1: Peter Gabriel's Secret World, which featured several music videos from the album. The album was a worldwide chart success, reaching No. 2 in the UK and the US and the top-ten in twelve other countries. Four singles were released: \"Digging in the Dirt\", \"Steam\", \"Blood of Eden\", and \"Kiss That Frog\", with \"Steam\" reaching No. 10 in the UK. Gabriel supported the album with his Secret World Tour in 1993 and 1994 which was documented on the Secret World Live album and same-titled concert film, both released in 1994. Us was reissued in 2002 and 2010. ==Track listing== ==Personnel== ===Musicians=== *Peter Gabriel \u2013 vocals (all tracks), keyboards (all tracks), triangle (track 1), programming (tracks 1, 2, 7\u201310), synth bass (tracks 1, 3, 7, 9, 10), percussion (tracks 2, 4, 9), valiha (track 2), horn arrangement (track 4), harmonica (track 9), Mexican flute (track 10) *Tony Levin \u2013 bass guitar (tracks 1\u20137 and 10) *David Rhodes \u2013 guitar (tracks 1, 2, 4, 5, 7\u201310), twelve-string guitar (track 3), solo guitar (track 4) *Manu Katch\u00e9 \u2013 drums (tracks 1, 6, 7), electric drums (tracks 2, 4, 5, 10), percussion (track 10) *The Babacar Faye Drummers \u2013 sabar drums (tracks 1 and 4) *Doudou N'Diaye Rose \u2013 programming (tracks 1 and 10) *David Bottrill \u2013 programming (tracks 1\u20134, 7, 10), additional programming (tracks 5 and 9), studio engineer *Chris Ormston \u2013 bagpipes (track 1) *Daniel Lanois \u2013 shaker (track 1), guitar (tracks 1, 10), additional vocals (track 1), hi-hat (track 3), vocals (track 3), horn arrangements (track 4), dobro on (tracks 8, 10) *Richard Blair \u2013 additional verse keyboards (track 1), programming (tracks 4, 5, 7, 9), additional programming (tracks 2, 3) *Levon Minassian \u2013 duduk (tracks 1, 3, 8) *Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor \u2013 vocals (tracks 1, 3) *Dmitri Pokrovsky Ensemble (Russian: \u0410\u043d\u0441\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u044c \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u044f \u041f\u043e\u043a\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e) \u2013 vocals (track 1) *Hossam Ramzy \u2013 tabla (track 2), surdo (track 7) *Daryl Johnson \u2013 drums (track 2) *William Orbit \u2013 programming (track 2), additional programming (track 5) *Bill Dillon \u2013 guitar (tracks 2, 5) *Mark Rivera \u2013 alto saxophone (tracks 4, 6) *Brian Eno \u2013 additional keyboards (track 2) *L.
