    "text": "Codlea (; ; Transylvanian Saxon dialect: Z\u00e4\u00f6eden; ) is a city in Bra\u0219ov County, Transylvania, Romania. ==History== M\u0103gura Codlei During the 13th century, the Teutonic Order built a fortress known as Schwarzburg (\"black castle\") near the \"M\u0103gura Codlei\". The castle's name was first noted in 1265 and was rebuilt for the last time in 1432 by the craftsmen's guild that worked in the town. The city of Codlea is believed to have been also founded by Germans. The fortified church in the city is the largest in the Burzenland historic region. Codlea was well known for its flowers and was called the city of flowers. ==Name== The Romanian name \"Codlea\" could be a derivation from the Latin *codella, diminutive from Latin coda \u2018edge, rearward\u2019 or it could be a derivation from the Slavic cotal (\"kettle\"), as the M\u0103gura Codlei (\"kettle hill\") looks like a kettle. In Romanian, M\u0103gura means 'big hill, mound, forest located on a high place'. The hill also provides the Hungarian name of the city Feketehegy (\"Black Hill\"). The German name's origin is unknown, but there is a theory that it was derived from Zeidler (\"beekeeper\"). ==Population== *1510: 670 *1814: 3,264 *1849: 3,764 *1890: 4,035 ** 2,680 Germans (67%) ** 1,211 Romanians (30%) ** 44 Hungarians (1%) ** 100 Jews and others (2%) *1930: 5,219 **3,111 Germans (60%) **1,916 Romanians (36%) ** 192 Hungarians (4%) *1941: 6,214 *1966: 13,075 *1977: 22,744 *1982: 23,500 *1992: 24,620 *2002: 24,286 *2011: 21,708 As of 2011, 90.2% of inhabitants were Romanians, 5.6% Roma, 2.8% Hungarians and 1% Germans.
