ABC AC combined a highly researched Adult Contemporary music mix targeted to women aged 25\u201349. Citadel Broadcasting purchased ABC Radio Networks (now Cumulus Media Networks) and the ABC owned-and-operated radio stations from The Walt Disney Company in February 2006. The Citadel acquisition has been completed and did not include Radio Disney or the ESPN Stations. Citadel merged with Cumulus Media on September 16, 2011. ==History== Starstation, as it was formerly known, was part of the original Satellite Music Network, with studios in Mokena, Illinois, outside of Chicago. After being acquired by ABC/Capital Cities, the format moved to studios in Dallas, Texas, along with many of the other SMN formats. ==Weekday hosts== *Frank Welch (also hosts Saturday 80's Show) *Richard Stevens *Mike Wade *Mary Rose *Donny Osmond (midday) ==Weekend hosts== *Milli Mills *Steve Eberhart *Sheryl Shannon *Scott Reese *Debbie Douglass *Areka Spencer ==Former hosts== *Citadel Media Networks had a mass firing on November 12, 2009.

John was concurrently employed as the local operations manager for Traffic.com in Dallas, and had worked in local Dallas- Fort Worth radio since 1979. McCarty began his radio career in his hometown of Hopkinsville, KY in 1968. *Bob Leonard was the original morning man on the format, and spent nearly 25 years with the ABC Radio Networks.
