Currently Strider does runs in many premium super steels (CTS-204P, Z-Wear, CTS-40CP, CTS-B75P, CPM-154, CPM-S110V,CPM-3V). Covert, Pat.\"Strider Knives Are Hard Corps\", American Handgunner, March\u2013April 2000 Strider fixed blade knives utilize Steel, Paracord or G-10 fiberglass for the handle material. Strider uses a proprietary heat treatment originally developed by Paul Bos of Buck Knives.Gardner, James.\"Duel of the Titans: two exceptional folders exemplify state-of-the-art\",Guns Magazine, June 2005 This resulted in knives with blades of ATS-34 or BG-42 coming back from heat treat with a very dark colored blade which would then be bead blasted a flat grey color. After masking a blade before beadblasting, Mick Strider found it resulted in a striping or camouflage effect and it has become a part of the design.Kertzman,Joe.\"Earn Your Steel Stripes\", Blade Magazine, March, 2006Covert, Pat.\"Evolving edges: Strider Knives get Better and Badder!\",American Handgunner, January\u2013February 2005 As the newest steel Strider uses, CPM S30V does not darken after heat treating, a black oxide coating is applied beforehand. ==Strider folding knives== Strider SnG folding knife After eight years of making fixed blade knives, Strider turned to making folding knives. Strider's goal was to produce a folding knife that was as strong as a fixed blade. To work toward this goal, Strider relied on the use of G10 Fiberglass handles, titanium liners thicker than what was in current use throughout the cutlery industry and an oversized pivot screw 0.19\" in diameter. The end results were two linerlocks known as the AR and GB models. Strider makes titanium handled framelock folding knives. These models utilize the handle itself as the locking mechanism and are named the SMF, SnG, PT, and RC models. ==Military models== Strider's first project as a company was to supply Naval Special Warfare Group 1 with WB and BG models in 1994.Bolke,Darryl. \"Strider Knives!\", American Handgunner Magazine, 2002 Annual Strider Knives currently makes several models specifically for units of the US Military in the Global War on Terror,Ayoob, Massad.\"One night in the War on Terror\", American Handgunner Magazine, Nov-Dec, 2005 each with its own NSN. NATO Stock Numbers are: Strider SMF (officially - Knife, Folding, Special Mission) 1095-01-531-5015, Strider DB-L (officially - Knife, Fixed, Camo) 1095-01-531-5023, the JB1 (officially - Shroud Knife) 1670-09-000-3920, and the Probe Knife 1095-01-503-7231, built for landmine detection. Strider Knives has designed a new bayonet it hopes to market to the US military. The blade is CPM S30V and it features a tang extending all the way to the latch plate for increased strength. Strider designed the bayonet for Zero Tolerance Knives, which will release it as the ZT Bayonet D9. Strider Knives has manufactured modern versions of classic military designs such as the V-42 Stiletto, the Marine Raider Stiletto, the SOG Knife, the USMC Fighting Utility Knife, and the Fairbairn-Sykes Fighting Knife. These versions have the same profile as the originals, but incorporate modern steel and materials in their designs. The SOG Knife, Marine Raider Stiletto, and V-42 Stiletto have been used to raise funds for Veteran's Groups associated with those units. ==Collaborations== Strider Knives has collaborated with the following companies: *Buck Knives for a variety of Strider developed knife designs mass- produced at a more affordable price.Markel, Paul. \"Practical Tacticals: Buck's Strider Folders\",Tactical Knives Magazine,May 2006 *SureFire Flashlights.
