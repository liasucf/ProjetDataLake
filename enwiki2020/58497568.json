The text is in English and Spanish (\"You're all on my body / S\u00e9 que quieres de m\u00ed, de m\u00ed, de m\u00ed / Baby, I'mma be honest / Estoy pensando en t\u00ed, en t\u00ed, en t\u00ed\") also see Inna \"[having] a Coca-Cola but [not wanting] no chaser\". Music critics gave positive reviews to \"No Help\" following its release. Jonathan Currinn of CelebMix called the song \"beyond catchy\", and compared it to material featured on Inna's fifth studio album Nirvana (2017). He especially found similarities in the album tracks \"My Dreams\" and \"Lights\". An editor of Star Gossip Magazine praised the track's dance nature, whilst Bradley Stern of MuuMuse called it an \"effortlessly hot, sleek club thumper\". Commercially, \"No Help\" debuted at number 73 on Romania's Airplay 100 chart for the week ending 23 September 2018, and ascended to its peak position at number 65 the next week. It also reached number 40 on the French Club 40 ranking. ==Music video== reviewer found this \"risque\" outfit in particular to resemble the singer's past \"provocative\" work. An accompanying music video for the song was uploaded onto Inna's official YouTube channel on 6 September 2018. Note: Open description for credits. It was shot in Morocco and Los Angeles by NGM Creative's Bogdan P\u01ceun, while Alexandru Mure\u015fan was hired as the director of photography and Loops Production as the producers.

During the music video, Inna wears multiple outfits while residing in a desert and a blue-toned forest. Currinn of CelebMix found that the \"risque\" white outfit resembled the singer's past \"provocative\" music videos. In the same scene, he likened her \"puffed up\" hair styling to \"that old-school pin-up look from half a century ago or so\". Inna also wears a beige outfit along with a short-hair wig and cowboy boots. Currinn praised her hair styling, while Rodica Mi\u021bu of DC News called it \"daring\". Inna further sports a \"binbag-style\" trench coat, as well as a blue sequined jumper with long sleeves. Accompanying Inna in the music video are several extras who\u2014according to Currinn\u2014\"set a slight narrative [...], suggesting that they don't quite have self-belief and they are searching for the help they need\u2014one has some binoculars. By the end, they seemed to have gained confidence in themselves\". The aforementioned editor praised the video for relating well to the song and commended the fact that Inna \"really does look good in anything\". Website Aficia's Valentin Malfroy stated that the clip mixes \"breathtaking landscapes and fatal beauty\". ==Track listing== *Digital download #\"No Help\" \u2013 3:02 == Charts == {| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" |- !
