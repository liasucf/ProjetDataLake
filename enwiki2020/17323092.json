    "text": "The 2008\u201309 Toronto Raptors season is the 14th season of the franchise in the National Basketball Association (NBA). Before the season began, six-time NBA All-Star and center Jermaine O'Neal was acquired to complement Chris Bosh in the frontcourt. 17 games into the season, head coach Sam Mitchell was fired and replaced by Jay Triano. The Raptors went into the All-Star break 13 games under .500, and O'Neal was traded to Miami for Shawn Marion. The Raptors continued to struggle, and were eliminated from the playoff race with seven games of the regular season remaining. ==Roster== ===Roster Notes=== * C Patrick O'Bryant was born and raised in the U.S., but is also a Central African citizen. ==Summary== ===Preseason=== Jermaine O'Neal, six-time NBA All-Star, was acquired from Indiana before the season began Seeking to improve its rebounding and interior defence, Toronto traded T. J. Ford, Radoslav Nesterovi\u0107, Maceo Baston, and the draft rights to Roy Hibbert to the Indiana Pacers in return for six-time NBA All-Star Jermaine O'Neal and the draft rights to Nathan Jawai.Sources: Pacers agree to O'Neal-for-Ford swap with Raptors, sports.espn.go.com, accessed 4 August 2008. With Ford gone, virtually all the point guard responsibilities rested on Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n's shoulders, who re-signed to a multi-year contract. The Raptors then signed free agents Hassan Adams, Will Solomon and Jamal Sampson, but Sampson was waived at the end of the pre-season. The Raptors also signed Roko Uki\u0107 who was drafted in the 2005 NBA draft, and lost Carlos Delfino and Primo\u017e Brezec to free agency. O'Neal's arrival, however, was dwarfed by the Elton Brand signing pulled off by division rivals Philadelphia. In a pre-season poll, more than half of the general managers predicted the acquisition of Brand to be the most significant one in the league,Schuhmann, John, \"Raptors' dynamic duo trumps Brand's Philly debut\", nba.com, 29 October 2008, accessed 31 October 2008. whereas the 30-year-old O'Neal was perceived to be past his prime.Smith, Doug, \"Hard times made Raptor O'Neal a family man\", Toronto Star, 29 October 2008. Nevertheless, the prospect of Toronto deploying two proven big men at the post with some of the league's best three-point shooters waiting at the perimeter signalled a change in game plan from the previous campaign. ===Regular season=== The Raptors in a home game against the Houston Rockets The Raptors began their campaign with a 95\u201384 road win against Philadelphia. The match featured the new All-Star acquisitions of both teams: O'Neal for the Raptors and Brand for the 76ers. Chris Bosh and O'Neal combined for 44 points and 19 rebounds in the win.Raptors at 76ers Boxscore, nba.com, 29 October 2008, accessed 4 November 2008. The team notched another victory in their second game\u2014a home fixture against the Golden State Warriors\u2014thus opening with the same 2\u20130 record as the season before. Andrea Bargnani, who had spent the summer buffing up his frame and working on his interior game, chalked up 5 rebounds and 3 blocks in the game that went into overtime.Warriors at Raptors Boxscore, nba.com, 31 October 2008, accessed 4 November 2008. The Raptors then got off to their best start in four seasons when they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the third game,Feschuk, Dave, \"Perfect Raptors stave off Bucks\", Toronto Star, 2 November 2008. with Calder\u00f3n scoring a career-high 25 points in the 91\u201387 win.Raptors at Bucks Boxscore, nba.com, 1 November 2008, accessed 4 November 2008. Meanwhile, O'Neal wasted no time in imposing his style on his new team: in the season opener at Philadelphia, he pointed to hecklers in the home crowd after making a dunk;Feschuk, Dave, \"Raptors' O'Neal silences the hecklers\", Toronto Star, 30 October 2008. in the team's second game, he blocked a dunk from Golden State's Brandan Wright and thereafter waved a finger, as though to say \"Don't come back here again.\"Grange, Michael, \"Raptors rolling after OT win\", Globe and Mail, 1 November 2008. However, the Raptors could not keep up their new game plan of solid defence and lost four of their next five games, including a blowout loss to the Atlanta Hawks and another to the Boston Celtics after relinquishing a 17-point lead.Raptors at Celtics Boxscore, nba.com, 10 November 2008, accessed 17 November 2008. While Bosh posted impressive numbers in nearly every game, his teammates were not as consistent. Toronto's depth at the point was soon put to the test when Calder\u00f3n was injured and unable to play against the rising Miami Heat. Solomon took over the reins with ease in that game and coupled with the Raptors' domination in the frontcourt led by O'Neal, Toronto secured a much needed win.Macleod, Robert, \"O'Neal leads Raptors' charge\", Globe and Mail, 16 November 2008. Moon was also dropped to the bench, with Bargnani made the starting small forward. This performance came to naught in the next game against the Orlando Magic, where although Bosh and O'Neal combined for 54 points and 28 boards, the lack of production and defence from the wing, coupled with the inability to protect possession, brought Toronto back to .500.Feschuk, Dave, \"Giveaways gut Bosh's big night\", thestar.com, 19 November 2008, accessed 20 November 2008. As though to prove a point, Bargnani and Anthony Parker combined for 44 points the next day in the win against Miami, while the tandem of Bosh and O'Neal secured 28 rebounds.Raptors at Heat Boxscore, nba.com, 19 November 2008, accessed 20 November 2008. This run was not sustained yet again, as Toronto lost a further two games on the trot: an overtime loss to New Jersey and another blowout loss to Boston, where the Raptors set a franchise record for highest field goal percentage (62%) conceded at home.Smith, Doug, \"Frustrated Bosh fumes after setback\", thestar.com, 24 November 2008, accessed 25 November 2008. That game also saw Bosh unleash a bout of angry frustration at his team as the Raptors plummeted to the bottom of the division standings. O'Neal was traded for four-time NBA All-Star Marion after the All-Star break On 3 December 2008, with the Raptors posting an 8\u20139 record 17 games into the season, Raptors' head coach Sam Mitchell was fired and replaced by longtime assistant Jay Triano on an interim basis.Mitchell Relieved Of Duties, Jay Triano Takes Over On Interim Basis, nba.com/raptors, 3 December 2008, accessed 3 December 2008. Triano\u2014the first Canadian head coach in NBA history\u2014immediately pointed to Toronto's bottom-of-the-league in fast break points as a major deficiency he wanted to overcome.Becker, Matt, \"Raptors-Jazz Preview\", nba.com, 4 December 2008, accessed 6 December 2008. However, the Raptors slipped a further three games to go 8\u201312 before it recovered with a two-game turnaround. In those two games, Triano attempted to introduce a new style of play: maximum protection of the paint.Feschuk, Dave, \"Defence derails Vinsanity\", thestar.com, 13 December 2008, accessed 14 December 2008. He also brought Kapono and Moon into the starting line-up and this seemed to work for a while before Toronto lost the next five games to go seven under .500, including a loss to the 2\u201324 Oklahoma City Thunder.Raps Drop Hard Fought Battle To Spurs, nba.com/raptors, accessed 7 January 2009. Toronto ended up 4\u201311 in December under Triano, but got off to a good start in January with wins over Houston and Orlando before going down in a crucial game against Milwaukee.Raptors Win Streak Ends At Two, nba.com/raptors, accessed 7 January 2009. January also saw Bargnani emerging as a legitimate starting center with him averaging over 21 points and 6.6 rebounds over a 16-game stretch and Uki\u0107 showing good signs of adaptation to the NBA, but all this was overshadowed by the injuries that O'Neal and Calder\u00f3n sustained and the resulting mounting losses. Given the Raptors' perpetual inability to win close games and hold on to leads, the team went on a seven-game losing streakSmith, Doug, \"Two victories this week crucial to Raptors' hopes\", thestar.com, 28 January 2009, accessed 29 January 2009. before the return of O'Neal and Calder\u00f3n saw them move to 19\u201328. Toronto then went on a six-game losing streak and dropped further down the pecking order with a 21\u201334 record going into the All-Star break. With Toronto looking to bring in a wing player and free up the salary space, O'Neal and Moon were traded to Miami for Shawn Marion and Marcus Banks on 13 February 2009.Aldridge, David, \"Raptors trade O'Neal, Moon to Heat for Marion, Banks\" , nba.com, 13 February 2009, accessed 14 February 2009. Six days later, Solomon was moved in a three-way deal, resulting in Toronto acquiring a big man in centre Patrick O'Bryant from Boston. Pops Mensah-Bonsu and Quincy Douby were also signed on 6 March and 24 March 2009 respectively. Even with the new acquisitions, Toronto continued losing games, one of which was a blowout 97\u2013127 loss to New York. Combined with a seven-game losing streak leading up to mid-March, this evaporated any hopes of making the playoffs. The only improvement came in the form of more fastbreak points and points scored in the paint, and the team even kickstarted a six-game winning streak in the last week of March, their longest winning streak in seven seasons.Chandler scores 17, Knicks beat Raptors 112-103 , nba.com, 5 April 2009, accessed 11 April 2009. The Raptors were also eliminated from playoffs contention at the same time when the streak ended, with seven games of the regular season to go. They ended the season with a three-game winning streak, an overall record of 33\u201349, and were ranked 13th in the Conference.2008\u201309 NBA season summary, basketball-reference.com, accessed 16 April 2009. ==Standings== ==Game log== ===Regular season=== |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 1 | October 29 | @ Philadelphia | | Chris Bosh (27) | Chris Bosh (11) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (7) | Wachovia Center 15,750 | 1\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 2 | October 31 | Golden State | | Chris Bosh (31) | Chris Bosh (9) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (13) | Air Canada Centre 19,800 | 2\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 3 | November 1 | @ Milwaukee | | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (25) | Chris Bosh (10) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (9) | Bradley Center 17,036 | 3\u20130 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 4 | November 5 | Detroit | | Chris Bosh (26) | Chris Bosh (13) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (8) | Air Canada Centre 18,602 | 3\u20131 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 5 | November 7 | @ Atlanta | | Chris Bosh (26) | Chris Bosh (8) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (12) | Philips Arena 18,290 | 3\u20132 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 6 | November 9 | @ Charlotte | | Chris Bosh (30) | Chris Bosh (15) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (7) | Time Warner Cable Arena 12,111 | 4\u20132 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 7 | November 10 | @ Boston | | Jermaine O'Neal (23) | Jermaine O'Neal (11) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (10) | TD Banknorth Garden 18,624 | 4\u20133 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 8 | November 12 | Philadelphia | | Chris Bosh (30) | Chris Bosh (12) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (6) | Air Canada Centre 18,093 | 4\u20134 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 9 | November 16 | Miami | | Chris Bosh (27) | Jermaine O'Neal (18) | Will Solomon (11) | Air Canada Centre 19,800 | 5\u20134 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 10 | November 18 | @ Orlando | | Chris Bosh (40) | Chris Bosh (18) | Chris Bosh, Will Solomon (4) | Amway Arena 16,353 | 5\u20135 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 11 | November 19 | @ Miami | | Andrea Bargnani (25) | Jermaine O'Neal (17) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (7) | American Airlines Arena 15,014 | 6\u20135 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 12 | November 21 | New Jersey | | Chris Bosh (42) | Andrea Bargnani (10) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (15) | Air Canada Centre 19,800 | 6\u20136 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 13 | November 23 | Boston | | Chris Bosh (24) | Andrea Bargnani (7) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (9) | Air Canada Centre 19,800 | 6\u20137 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 14 | November 26 | Charlotte | | Chris Bosh (39) | Chris Bosh (11) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (9) | Air Canada Centre 17,414 | 7\u20137 |- bgcolor=\"#bbffbb\" | 15 | November 28 | Atlanta | | Chris Bosh (30) | Chris Bosh (10) | Jos\u00e9 Calder\u00f3n (11) | Air Canada Centre 19,200 | 8\u20137 |- bgcolor=\"#ffcccc\" | 16 | November 30 | @ L.A.
