    "text": "T\u00f5stamaa Parish () was a rural municipality in southwestern Estonia. It was a part of P\u00e4rnu County. The municipality had a population of 1,572 (as of 1 January 2009) and covered an area of 261.01 km\u00b2. T\u00f5stamaa Parish covered part of the flat seashore of western P\u00e4rnu County, a low, swampy coastal area bordered by an elevated chain of sand dunes. Behind the dunes spreads a slightly wavy drumlin, where higher places have been reclaimed, but lower ones have remained swampy or meadowland and covered with scattered foliage. And, although T\u00f5stamaa should mean \"high land\", its populace have long lived not off the land, but off the sea. Several islands and islets in the Gulf of Riga, including Sorgu and Manilaid, belong to T\u00f5stamaa Parish. T\u00f5stamaa is home to the historic T\u00f5stamaa Keskkool. ==Settlements== ;Small borough: T\u00f5stamaa ;Villages: Alu - Ermistu - Kastna - Kavaru - Kiraste - K\u00f5pu - Lao - L\u00f5uka - Manija - M\u00e4nnikuste - P\u00e4rak\u00fcla - Peerni - Pootsi - Rammuka - Ranniku - Seliste - T\u00f5hela - T\u00f5lli - V\u00e4rati == Gallery == T\u00f5stamaa vallamaja 2010.JPG|T\u00f5stamaa community house T\u00f5stamaa m\u00f5is.jpg|T\u00f5stamaa manor house Manija k\u00fclakeskus.jpg|Manija village centre on Manilaid island Seliste kirik, vaade edelast.jpg|Seliste church Pootsi k6pu kirik.jpg|Pootsi-K\u00f5pu church File:Ermistu j\u00e4rv.JPG|Lake Ermistu T\u00f5stamaa kirik 01.jpg|T\u00f5stamaa church Peerni sadam.JPG|Peerni harbor ==References== ==External links== *Official website Category:Former municipalities of Estonia ",
