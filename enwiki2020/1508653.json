    "text": "Kyrie Eleison Abbey, Abbeydorney Abbeydorney Abbey, also known as Kyrie Eleison Abbey or Odorney was founded by the O Torna, chieftain of the region, in 1154 for the Cistercians from Monasteranenagh. The abbey was the daughter- house of Nenay Abbey in County Limerick, and was the only medieval Cistercian house in County Kerry. The name given by the Cistercians, Kyrie Eleison (from Greek: Lord Have Mercy) was in accordance with the order's tradition of giving names which reflected the locality - in this instance the word Kyrie (Lord) being similar to Ciarrai (County Kerry). The first abbot was Christian O Conarchy who retired to the abbey where he spent his remaining years, being buried there in 1186. A subsequent abbot was deposed in 1227 after being involved in the Conspiracy of Mellifont. The foundation was dissolved in 1537. The remains visible today include the 15th century abbey church with west tower and some of the claustral buildings. The grounds are largely occupied by gravestones and are currently in use as a cemetery. ==See also== * List of abbeys and priories in Ireland (County Kerry) * Abbeydorney ==External links== * Church Ruins: * View of Abbey Ruins: * Modern Church: Category:Cistercian monasteries in the Republic of Ireland Category:1154 establishments in Ireland Category:1537 disestablishments in Ireland Category:Religious organizations established in the 1150s Category:Buildings and structures in County Kerry Category:Religion in County Kerry Category:Ruins in the Republic of Ireland Category:Christian monasteries established in the 12th century ",
