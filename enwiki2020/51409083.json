    "text": "Kubrick is the sixth full-length studio album by electronica production duo Soulsavers released by San Quentin Recordings label. The album consists of eight instrumental compositions and is dedicated to the works of Stanley Kubrick. The album is self-produced and was recorded at a number of studios around the world. It is the duo's first solo album since 2009's Broken. ==Critical reception== At Metacritic, that assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 64, based on seven reviews, which indicates \"generally favorable reviews\". At AnyDecentMusic?, that collates critical reviews from more than 50 media sources, the album scored 6.1 points out of 10. Sam Shepherd of musicOMH wrote \"As an entirely instrumental album, Kubrick is to some degree new ground for the pair and, whilst they are certainly no strangers to the form, this is the first time they\u2019ve produced an entire album with no vocals whatsoever. This time around, the focus is on the duo\u2019s compositional acumen; no longer hidden by their fine choices of collaborators, they seize the opportunity, and positively soar.... Kubrick is an ambitious project, but one that works just perfectly as a showcase for the wonderful songwriting and compositional skills of Machin and Glover. It proves, as if it were ever in doubt, that their strength lies not in the skills of their collaborators, but in their music and ideas\". Paul Mardles of The Guardian stated \"The sixth album by production team Rich Machin and Ian Glover aspires to emulate his movies\u2019 atmosphere, its eight tracks named after Kubrick characters. Entirely instrumental, all woodwinds and strings, it is a sumptuous, often soothing set but too one-paced to be transportive\". ==Track listing== ==Personnel== *Martyn LeNoble \u2013 bass *Kevin Bales \u2013 drums *James Walbourne \u2013 guitar *Soulsavers \u2013 producing *Geoff Pesche \u2013 mastering *Daniele Luppi \u2013 orchestrating *Steve Gullick \u2013 front cover *The Hollywood Strings & Brass Ensemble \u2013 strings, horns ==References== Category:2015 albums Category:Soulsavers albums ",
