    "text": "Marcello Gandini (born 26 August 1938) is an Italian car designer, known for his work with the automotive design house Gruppo Bertone, including his designs of the Lamborghini Miura, Countach, and the Lamborghini Diablo. Gandini, along with noted Italian car designers Giorgetto Giugiaro and Leonardo Fioravanti, were all born in 1938, within months of each other. In a 2009 interview with Robert Cumberford, editor at Automobile Magazine, Gandini indicated, \"his design interests are focused on vehicle architecture, construction, assembly, and mechanisms \u2013 not appearance.\" Gandini was one of twenty-five designers nominated for Car Designer of the Century. ==Early life== The son of an orchestral conductor, Gandini, was born in Turin. In 1963, he approached Nuccio Bertone, head of the Gruppo Bertone company, for work. However, Giorgetto Giugiaro, then Bertone's chief designer, opposed him being hired. When Giugiaro left Bertone two years later, Gandini was hired, and worked for the company for fourteen years. Creator of Stile Bertone in Caprie, Gandini served as general manager of the styling house, designing show cars as well as managing the construction of prototype automobiles. Gandini designed Lamborghini's groundbreaking mid-engined Miura and extreme Countach, as well as many practical cars such as the Citro\u00ebn BX, the first-generation BMW 5 Series (E12), the Innocenti Mini, and the Renault Supercinq. He introduced the concept of scissor doors with the Alfa Romeo 33 Carabo prototype, while the Lancia Stratos sports car was another Gandini design. Gandini left Bertone in 1980, pursuing freelance automotive, industrial, and interior design. Gandini has worked in other areas, including home architecture, the design of a nightclub interior, and the body styling of the Heli-Sport CH-7 helicopter. ==Designs== Gandini car designs include: *Alfa Romeo Montreal concept and production version *Alfa Romeo 33 Carabo *Alfa Romeo 90 *Autobianchi A112 *Autobianchi A112 Runabout *Bertone Pirana *Bugatti EB 110 (prototypes) *BMW 5 Series (E12), including the concept Garmisch in 1970 *Citro\u00ebn BX *Citro\u00ebn Camargue *Cizeta-Moroder V16T *De Tomaso Bigu\u00e0 (Qvale Mangusta) *De Tomaso Pantera SI *De Tomaso Pantera 'Prossima Generazione' *Dino/Ferrari 308 GT4 *Ferrari Rainbow *Fiat 132 *Fiat X1/9 *Iso Lele *Iso Grifo 90 *Iso Grifo 96 *Jaguar Ascot *Lamborghini Bravo *Lamborghini Countach *Lamborghini P140 *Lamborghini Diablo (prototypes) *Lamborghini P147 Acosta *Lamborghini Espada *Lamborghini Jarama *Lamborghini Miura *Lamborghini Urraco *Lamborghini Marzal *Lancia Stratos Zero *Lancia Stratos *Lancia SibiloThe Lancia Sibilo Was Nuts Even By 1970s Concept Car Standards \u2013 Jalopnik *Maserati Khamsin *Maserati Ghibli II *Maserati Quattroporte II (1974\u20131978) & IV (1994\u20132001) *Maserati Shamal *Maserati Chubasco *1st and 2nd Maserati Biturbos facelift *Nissan AP-X *NSU Trapeze *Renault 5 Turbo *Renault 5 Supercinq *Renault Magnum *TaMo Racemo *Stola S81 Stratos *Stola S86 Diamante *Volvo Tundra Lamborghini Miura Sinsheim.jpg|Lamborghini Miura S Alfa Romeo Carabo Bertone (4345325783).jpg|Alfa Romeo Carabo Countach Scherentueren.jpg|Lamborghini Countach LP400 2002ti-Garmisch 2019-05-26.jpg|Garmisch, concept for BMW 1970 Maserati Khamsin.jpg|Maserati Khamsin Lancia Stratos Zero (7522598642).jpg|Lancia Stratos Zero Lancia STRATOS (8014528000).jpg|Gandini's iconic Lancia Stratos 62\u00b0 Coppa Intereuropa - Autodromo Nazionale Monza - 21-06-2015 (19230336115).jpg|Stola S81 Stratos Bmw e12 v sst.jpg|BMW 5-series (1st generation) 1993 Maserati Shamal coupe (21175976552).jpg|Maserati Shamal Citroen BX Madrid.jpg|Citroen BX Hatchback became one of the best selling Citroen models Bertone105 (27092146177).jpg|1976 Ferrari Rainbow concept at left, and Ferrari GT4 at right TaMo Racemo.jpg|TaMo Racemo by Tata Motors ==References== ==External links== *Fiat X1/9 web site * BMW Designers Marcello Gandini on the page with an overview of automotive designers working for BMW. * Marcello Gandini: Maestro of Design by Gautam Sen.
