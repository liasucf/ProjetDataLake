    "text": "GOV.UK Verify is an identity assurance system developed by the UK Government Digital Service (GDS). The system is intended to provide a single trusted login across all UK government digital services, verifying the user\u2019s identity in 15 minutes. It allows users to choose one of several companies to verify their identity to a standard level of assurance before accessing 22 central government online services. ==History== The Cabinet Office started work on the system in 2011, when it was known as the Identity Assurance Programme (IDAP). A private beta phase began in February 2014, moving into public beta on 14 October 2014. The system was declared live on 24 May 2016. In June 2018, it was announced that the responsibility for digital ID policy had moved from GDS to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. Responsibility for development and rollout of GOV.UK Verify remains with GDS. ==Certified companies== Third-party companies are responsible for carrying out identity verification within the scheme. The first five companies \u2013 known as identity providers (IdPs) \u2013 that signed up to provide the service through a tender issued by the Department of Work and Pensions were The Post Office, Verizon, Experian, Digidentity and Mydex CIC. After a further tender issued by the Cabinet Office in 2014, Barclays, GB Group, Morpho and Royal Mail became certified companies. While Mydex CIC participated in the original tender process it did not go on to become a certified GOV.UK identity provider. In 2016 Verizon was temporarily and then permanently removed from the list of certified providers. In October 2018, GDS announced that five of the seven identity providers - Barclays, Digidentity, Experian, Post Office and SecureIdentity - had signed contracts for a further 18 months. Users of Citizensafe from GB Group and Royal Mail's identity service which is based on GB Group technology would be able to continue using their GOV.UK Verify identity for twelve months but would need to set up a new account through one of the other five companies. ==Level of assurance== GOV.UK Verify certified companies must verify customers' identities to level 2 as defined by Good Practice Guide 45 published jointly by CESG and the Cabinet Office. This level of identity assurance is intended to be sufficient to support a claim in a civil court. ==List of connected services== The following 22 services are connected to GOV.UK Verify : {| class=\"wikitable sortable\" |- !

Local government services piloted as of July 2017 included applying for free bus passes and 'blue badge' disabled parking permits. ===Private sector=== From the outset, GDS had intended GOV.UK Verify use to be extended to the private sector. While work was underway in 2017, this was still not in place in October 2018 when the GDS head Kevin Cunnington announced that \"GOV.UK Verify is now mature enough for us to take it to the next stage - opening it up beyond the private sector for the private sector to take the lead\". Cunnington announced that five of the identity providers had signed contracts for a further 18 months, after which the scheme would not receive further funding from government. The development of the scheme would instead be in the hands of the private sector. ===NHS=== GOV.UK Verify was one of the options considered by the National Health Service for its citizen identity solution. The NHS since announced that it was pursuing its own app-based solution, but was looking for a way to enable people who have a GOV.UK Verify account to use it to log in to NHS systems. == International == Work is underway to enable non-UK citizens to access the service from September 2018. GOV.UK Verify is designed with interoperability with the ID schemes of other EU states as part of the eIDAS scheme. On 28 August 2018, GOV.UK Verify took its first step towards enabling UK residents to use their GOV.UK Verify account to log on to online public services in other EU countries. The scheme was 'notified' on 2 May 2019. ==Criticism== The GOV.UK Verify has not met various targets that GDS set for it: *The platform was originally due to launch in 2012, but did not do so until 2016. *The success rate in verifying individuals is 47% as of October 2018. It does not meet all the identity requirements of government departments, such as identifying intermediaries or businesses. The Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA) reviewed Verify in July 2018, noting the department's reluctance to continue funding the project, with another report requesting the GOV.UK Verify identity assurance programme should be terminated. In October 2018, Jo Platt, the Shadow Minister for the Cabinet Office, said that \u00a3130 million had been spent on developing GOV.UK Verify. ==Future development== In December 2018, GDS announced that over the next 18 months they would be working with standards bodies, identity providers and the private sector to: * Make the standards easier to follow and use * Accept more types of identity evidence * Remove barriers to reuse of digital identities across the public and private sector * Make better use of government data to help people prove who they are online * Open up the market based on a standards-based approach However there are concerns over this approach and three of the remaining identity providers - Experian, Barclays and Secure Identity - have indicated that they are withdrawing from the scheme leaving only the Post Office and Digidentity. The Post Office depends on Digidentity infrastructure to operate as an identity provider. In April 2020, funding for GOV.UK Verify was extended by 18 months due to COVID-2019. In August 2020, TechUK criticised the Government's progress since 2019 as being slow and opaque. ==See also== *Digital identity *Electronic authentication *Federated identity *Government Gateway *Identity management *National Strategy for Trusted Identities in Cyberspace (US equivalent initiative) *Open Identity Exchange *Privacy by design *Strong authentication == Further reading == * == References == ==External links== * Introducing GOV.UK Verify * Video showing how GOV.UK Verify works * GOV.UK Verify on Twitter * GOV.UK Verify blog * GOV.UK Verify performance dashboard * Identity Assurance Programme briefing paper - National Audit Office * Investigation into Verify, March 2019 - National Audit Office Category:Identity management Category:Identity management initiative Category:Federated identity Category:Identity management systems Category:Computer access control Category:Cabinet Office (United Kingdom) Category:E-government in the United Kingdom ",
