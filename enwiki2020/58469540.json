    "text": "Emma P\u00e9rez is an American author and professor, known for her work in queer Chicana feminist studies. == Biography == P\u00e9rez was born in El Campo, Texas in October 25, 1954. In 1979, she received an undergraduate degree in political science and women's studies from the University of California, Los Angeles. She obtained her master's and doctorate in history from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1982 and 1988, respectively. P\u00e9rez was a professor at the University of Texas at El Paso (1990\u20132003), where she became the Chair of the History Department. In 2003, she became a professor and the chair of the department of Ethnic Studies at the University of Colorado at Boulder and taught in their Ph.D. in Comparative Ethnic Studies.

As a scholar, she specializes in Chicana history, feminist studies, queer history, and decolonial theory. == Writing == === Literary contributions === P\u00e9rez's first literary work, Gulf Dreams, published in 1996, is a coming of age story set in a small racist Texas town. It touches on childhood sexual abuse, the legacies of colonialism, sexual repression, and same-sex desire and is considered to be one of the first Chicana lesbian novels in print.Hern\u00e1ndez, Ellie. \"Chronotope of Desire: Emma P\u00e9rez's Gulf Dreams.\" In Chicana Feminisms: A Critical Reader, edited by Patricia Zavella, Gabriela F. Arredondo, Aida Hurtado, Norma Klahn, and Olga Najera-Ramirez, 155\u201377. Duke University Press, 2003. Her second novel, published in 2009, Forgetting the Alamo, Or Blood Memory, is a historical fiction set against the backdrop of the 1836 battles of the Alamo and of San Jacinto. It is a tale of travel and adventure that narrates the story of a young cross-dressing tejana and her romance with a mixed race woman, both of whom are witnesses to the racial complexities of the southwest during this turbulent period. It is suggested that the novel \"inverts the traditional Alamo narrative\" in order to highlight the racial violence of that historic event.Zimmerman, Jutta. \"Remember the Alamo: The Persistence of Cultural Stereotypes in Literary and Filmic Representations of the Mexican American Borderlands.\" In Disrespected Neighbo(u)Rs: Cultural Stereotypes in Literature and Film, edited by Caroline Rosenthal, Laurenz Volkmann, and Uwe Zagratzki, 23\u201340. Cambridge: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2018. Forgetting the Alamo won the Christopher Isherwood Writing Grant in 2009,https://www.auntlute.com/emma-perez the National Association for Chicana/Chicano Studies Regional Book Award for fiction in 2011 and was a finalist for the Lambda Literary Awards in 2010. According to Rocky Mountain Modern Language Association \"Forgetting the Alamo, Or Blood Memory\" proposes that sexuality and gender are inextricably linked to language, culture, and race, something that has been under-theorized in many articulations of queer and feminist theory\". Her third book, Electra's Complex was nominated for the Golden Crown Literary Award. It is an erotic murder mystery set on a university campus that features the sexual adventures of a Chicana lesbian professor, her trans man best buddy, and the sexy female detective assigned to the case.Scott, Tara. \"Electras Complex by Emma P\u00e9rez: Book Review.\" The Lesbian Review (blog), April 26, 2016. https://www.thelesbianreview.com/electras-complex-emma-perez/ One critic argues that this book reclaims and re-imagines negative stereotypes about masculine women and butches, even as it appropriates and queers the womanizing behaviors associated with machista cultures for butch women.Rivera, Kendy. \"La Daika: Auto-Teor\u00eda of a Dyke(-Ish) Tijuana Border Lesbian.\" Queer Cats Journal LGBTQ Studies 1, no. 1 (n.d.): 87\u201398. === Academic contributions === The Decolonial Imaginary: Writing Chicanas into History (1999) is recognized as one of the founding influences of decolonial studies and of queer of color critiqueBlackwell, Maylei. Chicana Power!: Contested Histories of Feminism in the Chicano Movement. 1st ed. Chicana Matters Series. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2011. Esquibel, Catriona Rueda. With Her Machete in Her Hand: Reading Chicana Lesbians. Annotated edition edition. Austin: University of Texas Press, 2006. . It is credited with offering new understandings of Chicano historiography by highlighting the role of archival silences, erasures, and omissions in the production of knowledge.Quintana, Alvina E. \"The Decolonial Imaginary: Writing Chicanas into History by Emma P\u00e9rezSpeaking Chicana: Voice, Power, and Identity Edited by D. Letticia Galindo and Mar\u00eda Dolores GonzalesFeminism on the Border: Chicana Gender Politics and Literature by Sonia Sald\u00edvar\u2010Hull.\" Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society 28, no. 2 (January 1, 2003): 724\u2013000. https://doi.org/10.1086/342586 P\u00e9rez argues that the shadow of colonialism inflects how history is understood and challenges readers to construct a \"decolonial imaginary\" as a way to challenge dominant narratives of history. The book develops the idea of third space feminism by looking at different discursive events including Yucat\u00e1n's Socialist Revolution, El Partido Liberal Mexicano, and Texas social clubs. P\u00e9rez's theoretical formation is credited with connecting Chicana and women of color feminist thought to the work of Michel Foucault, Jacques Lacan, Homi Bhaba and other postcolonial theorists. Alongside Gloria Anzald\u00faa, Cherr\u00ede Moraga, Chela Sandoval, Deena Gonzalez, and Alicia Gaspar de Alba, she is considered one of the founding theorists of Chicana feminism. In 2020, Emma P\u00e9rez was inducted into the Texas Institute of Letters, a distinguished honor society founded in 1936 to celebrate Texas literature and to recognize distinctive literary achievement. == Publications == ;Books * Electra's Complex, Bella Books, May 2015. * Forgetting the Alamo, Or, Blood Memory.
