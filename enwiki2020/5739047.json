    "text": "In mathematics, a slender group is a torsion-free abelian group that is \"small\" in a sense that is made precise in the definition below. == Definition == Let ZN denote the Baer\u2013Specker group, that is, the group of all integer sequences, with termwise addition. For each n in N, let en be the sequence with n-th term equal to 1 and all other terms 0. A torsion-free abelian group G is said to be slender if every homomorphism from ZN into G maps all but finitely many of the en to the identity element. == Examples == Every free abelian group is slender. The additive group of rational numbers Q is not slender: any mapping of the en into Q extends to a homomorphism from the free subgroup generated by the en, and as Q is injective this homomorphism extends over the whole of ZN. Therefore, a slender group must be reduced. Every countable reduced torsion-free abelian group is slender, so every proper subgroup of Q is slender. == Properties == * A torsion-free abelian group is slender if and only if it is reduced and contains no copy of the Baer\u2013Specker group and no copy of the p-adic integers for any p. * Direct sums of slender groups are also slender. * Subgroups of slender groups are slender. * Every homomorphism from ZN into a slender group factors through Zn for some natural number n. == References == * . * * * Category:Properties of groups Category:Abelian group theory ",
