Chad Bowar of About.com describes the style as black metal which \u201ctook on a melodic, slightly heavy metal-ish format\u201c, with a \u201climited supply of rhythm blasting and lifeless tremolo riffing\u201d.Chad Bowar: Retro Recommendation: Rotting Christ - Thy Mighty Contract . == Reviews == Allmusic journalist Eduardo Rivadavia called Thy Mighty Contract \u201ca promising first long-player\u201d, although \u201cthe album's production may have been somewhat subpar, and its songs slightly over-reliant on furious blastbeats, but none of this mattered a lick to hardcore extreme metal fans\u201d. About.com featured the album as a Retro Recommendation and criticised the drums for being \u201ctoo loud, and given the repetitive beats played, it becomes distracting at times. However, the bass is audible, which automatically makes the record something to cherish.\u201c == References == Category:1993 albums Category:Rotting Christ albums ",
