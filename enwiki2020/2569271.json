The competition was organized by CONMEBOL, South America's football governing body, and was held between 26 June and 15 July in Venezuela, which hosted the tournament for the first time. The competition was won by Brazil (they were also the defending champions), who beat Argentina 3\u20130 in the final. Mexico took third place by beating Uruguay 3\u20131 in the third- place match. Brazil thus won the right to represent CONMEBOLThe South American champion, along with the European champion (the winner of Euro 2008), \"will no longer be obliged to take part\" in the Confederations Cup beginning with the 2009 edition FIFA.com \u2013 2005/2006 season: final worldwide matchday to be 14 May 2006. at the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup.Mexico and the United States are members of CONCACAF, the governing body of North American football (which includes Central America and the Caribbean as well). Thus, they would not be allowed to represent CONMEBOL at the Confederations Cup. Had either team won the Copa Am\u00e9rica, the best-finishing South American team would have taken the place. ==Competing nations== As with previous tournaments, all ten members of CONMEBOL participated in the competition. In order to bring the number of competing teams to twelve, CONMEBOL invited Mexico and the United States, the two highest ranking CONCACAF teams in the FIFA World Rankings. Just as in every tournament since 1993, Mexico accepted the invitation without reservation. The United States, on the other hand, rejected the invitation due to scheduling conflicts with the 2007 Major League Soccer season. CONMEBOL then proceeded to invite Costa Rica, the third highest CONCACAF team in FIFA's ranking. In the end, the United States accepted the invitation. * * * (holders) * * * * (invitee) * * * (invitee) * * (hosts) ==Venues== For this Copa Am\u00e9rica, the organizing committee decided to choose eight cities to hold the tournament. A total of 14 cities presented proposal before the committee, of which they rejected proposals from Barquisimeto, Maracay, Valencia, Valera, Portuguesa and Miranda for not meeting established requirements. The cities of Barinas, Caracas, Ciudad Guayana, Maracaibo, Matur\u00edn, M\u00e9rida, Puerto la Cruz and San Crist\u00f3bal were selected to host the tournament. Later on, the organizing committee reconsidered the candidacy of Barquisimeto, based on the proposal of a new stadium to be built for the city. With a final nine host cities, the 2007 edition broke the previous records for host cities set by the 2004 Copa Am\u00e9rica in Peru, which used seven. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! width=200 |Matur\u00edn!! width=\"200\" |Barquisimeto !! width=200 |M\u00e9rida!! width=\"200\" |Ciudad Guayana |- |Estadio Monumental de Matur\u00edn||Estadio Metropolitano de Lara ||Estadio Metropolitano de M\u00e9rida||Estadio Polideportivo Cachamay |- | Capacity: 52,000|| Capacity: 42,000 || Capacity: 42,000|| Capacity: 41,600 |- |alt=||alt= ||alt=||alt= |- !
