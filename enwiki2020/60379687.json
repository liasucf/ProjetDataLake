    "text": "Margr\u00e9tar saga is an Old Norse-Icelandic saints' saga that tells the story of St Margaret of Antioch. There are three versions of the saga based on at least two translations, and it is extant in more medieval and post-reformation copies than any other saint's legend. Its popularity appears in part to be due to the text's use in childbirth contexts, which was a uniquely Icelandic development of a popular European tradition. The date of the legend's first translation into Old-Norse Icelandic is unknown, but based on the dating of its earliest manuscripts it is taken to have occurred some time before 1300. There is no date or location for the origin for the veneration of Margaret in Iceland. However, Cormack notes that the first Icelander named Margr\u00e9t is recorded in Landn\u00e1mab\u00f3k as dying in 1216, and that images of Margaret in the diocese of H\u00f3lar pre-date the dedications to Margaret in Sk\u00e1lholt. == Bibliography == A comprehensive bibliography can be found in Wolf's The Legends of the Saints in Old Norse-Icelandic Prose. === Editions === ====Margr\u00e9tar saga I==== * Haugen, Odd Einar (1994) \u201cMargr\u00e9tar saga\u201d, in Norr\u00f8ne tekster i utval, ed.
