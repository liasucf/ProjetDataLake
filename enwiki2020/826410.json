    "text": "Free Peace Sweet is the third studio album by Dodgy. The track \"Homegrown\" was given the same name as the band's previous album. ==Release== It was released on 17 June 1996Select Magazine July 1996 through A&M.; The vinyl version has two extra songs: \"Is It Me\" and \"Grateful Moon\". The album's title is a pun on three-piece suite. Mercury was planning on releasing the album in the US in March 1997, before being pushed back to May to eventually being shelved. Dodgy's co-manager Dave Crompton commented that Mercury planned on releasing a single first but the band was against it, saying: \"We think their attitude was, 'We'll put it out and see what happens,' and we said, 'We want to have a career. We've got one in England and Europe, and we want one in the U.S. as well.'\" The band eventually parted ways with Mercury. Crompton and partner Andrew Winters were aiming to find a new label to release the album in the summer. ==Reception== Free Peace Sweet charted at number 7 in the UK. By March 1997, the album had sold 400,000 copies in the UK. The album spawned four UK top 20 singles: \"In a Room\" (No. 12), \"Good Enough\" (No. 4), \"If You're Thinking of Me\" (No. 11) and \"Found You\" (No. 19). ==Track listing== All songs written by Nigel Clark, Mathew Priest and Andy Miller. # \"Intro\" \u2013 0:47 # \"In a Room\" \u2013 4:15 # \"Trust in Time\" \u2013 2:41 # \"You've Gotta Look Up\" \u2013 5:29 # \"If You're Thinking of Me\" \u2013 5:53 # \"Good Enough\" \u2013 4:01 # \"Ain't No Longer Asking\" \u2013 6:04 # \"Found You\" \u2013 4:54 # \"One of Those Rivers\" \u2013 7:43 # \"Prey for Drinking\" \u2013 3:07 # \"Jack the Lad\" \u2013 3:40 # \"Long Life\" \u2013 4:47 # \"U.K.R.I.P.\" \u2013 5:08 # \"Homegrown\" \u2013 5:52 ==Personnel== Personnel per booklet. ;Dodgy * Nigel Clark \u2013 lead vocals, bass, acoustic guitar, electric guitar * Mathew Priest \u2013 drums, percussion, backing vocals * Andy Miller \u2013 lead guitar, slide guitar, sitar, backing vocals ;Additional musicians * Richard Payne \u2013 keyboards * Jerome de Pietro \u2013 additional programming and remixing on interludes and track 1 * Janet Ramus \u2013 additional vocals on tracks 4, 5 and 10 * Michele Douglas \u2013 additional vocals on tracks 4, 5 and 10 * The Kick Horns: ** Tim Sanders \u2013 brass on tracks 2, 6, 11 and 14 ** Neil Sidwell \u2013 brass on tracks 2, 6, 11 and 14 ** Roddy Lorimer \u2013 brass on tracks 2, 6, 11 and 14 ** Simon Clarke \u2013 brass on tracks 2, 6, 11 and 14 * Nick Ingman \u2013 string arranger on tracks 5, 9 and 12 * Tim Kent \u2013 banjo on track 9 * Teena Lyle \u2013 vibraphone on track 4 ;Production * Hugh Jones \u2013 producer, mixing * Robin Evans \u2013 engineer * Helen Woodward \u2013 mix engineer * Ian Cooper \u2013 mastering * Crispin Murray \u2013 digital editing * Chris 'Namaste' Priest \u2013 design * Derrick 'Coolio' Santini \u2013 photography ==Chart performance== {| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\" |- ! scope=\"col\"| Chart (1996) ! scope=\"col\"| Peak position |- ! scope=\"row\"| UK Albums (OCC) | 7 |} ==References== Category:1996 albums Category:Dodgy albums Category:A&M; Records albums ",
