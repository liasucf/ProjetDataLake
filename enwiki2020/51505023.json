    "text": "The Antioquia Batholith (, Ksta, Kqd, K2ba) is a cluster of plutons located in and named after Antioquia, Colombia. The plutons stretch over an area of about , and intruded and cooled in Late Cretaceous times.Iba\u00f1ez et al., 2007 Much of the batholith is weathered into a thick saprolite mantle. In some locations this saprolite reaches thicknesses of about . The development of this weathering is attributed to the humid climate and to stable conditions with limited amounts of erosion. Where the batholith-derived saprolite is eroded, inselbergs, such as El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Guatap\u00e9, crop out. Inselbergs correspond to rock masses of the batholith that resisted weathering and erosion by being less fractured.Garc\u00eda & Hermelin, 2016, pp.139-154 == Etymology == The batholith was named after Antioquia by Botero in 1942, after various authors as Boussignault in 1825, Ospina in 1911, Scheibe in 1933 and Posada in 1936 mentioned its existence.Albarrac\u00edn et al., 2011, p.100 == Geology == The batholith varies in composition between hornblende-biotite tonalite to granodiorite, with lateral variations between gabbro to granite. Common minerals are hornblende, quartz, plagioclase, K-feldspar, biotite and amphibole, with traces of epidote, chlorite and sphene. The batholith underlies the municipalities San Andr\u00e9s de Cuerquia, San Jos\u00e9 de la Monta\u00f1a,Plancha 115, 1974 in the east of San Jer\u00f3nimo, around Belmira,Plancha 130, 1983 in Don Mat\u00edas, Girardota, G\u00f3mez Plata, Entrerr\u00edos, Carolina del Pr\u00edncipe, Barbosa, Santo Domingo, and Santa Rosa de Osos.Plancha 131, 2010 Because of profound meteorization, outcrops are scarce and restricted to riverbeds,Albarrac\u00edn et al., 2011, p.101 and at El Pe\u00f1\u00f3n de Guatap\u00e9. To the northwest of the urban center of Santa Rosa de los Osos, bauxite mineralizations of the batholith are found.Albarrac\u00edn et al., 2011, p.103 === Origin === The batholith intruded the Triassic San Isidro Granulite, Ceja Gneiss and Medell\u00edn Amphibolite, schists of the Valdivia Group, and migmatites of the Ayura Montebello Group. Xenoliths of those host rocks in which the batholith intruded consist of quartz-mica schists, amphibolites and gneisses.Albarrac\u00edn et al., 2011, p.110 In certain places, the batholith is overlain by the El Vergel Beds, alluvium and other Quaternary deposits. === Tectonics === In Belmira, the R\u00edo Chico Fault places the Medell\u00edn Dunite against the Antioquia Batholith. The Ot\u00fa-Pericos Fault places the Antioquia Batholith in contact with the Jurassic Segovia Batholith. The Esp\u00edritu Santo Fault runs just north of the batholith near San Andr\u00e9s de Cuerquia. Other faults cross-cutting the batholith are:Geological map of Antioquia, 1999 * Balseadero Fault * Biscocho Fault * Caldera Fault * Miraflores Fault * Monteloro Fault * Nare Fault === Age === A 2019 summary of ages obtained for the batholith show that the batholith formed in a protracted manner from 97 to 58 million years ago (Ma), that is from the Late Cretaceous to the Paleocene. For the main part of the intrusion there is a best estimate of the age between 71 \u00b1 1.2 and 77 \u00b1 1.7 Ma, suggesting an intrusion age near the boundary of the Campanian and Maastrichtian.Albarrac\u00edn et al., 2011, p.114 == Hydrology == R\u00edo Grande Reservoir The Medell\u00edn River cross-cuts the batholith from southwest to northeast, where it flows in the Porce River. The following reservoirs are situated entirely on the batholith: * Miraflores Reservoir * Las Playas Reservoir * Guatap\u00e9 Reservoir * R\u00edo Grande Reservoir * San Lorenzo Reservoir * Troneras Reservoir == References == === Bibliography === * * * ==== Maps ==== * * * * Batholith, Antioquia Category:Batholiths of South America Category:Late Cretaceous South America Category:Cretaceous Colombia Category:Cretaceous magmatism Category:Campanian Stage Batholith, Antioquia ",
