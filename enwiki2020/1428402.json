    "text": "Felling is an eastern suburb of Gateshead, Tyne and Wear, England. The town was formed when three villages coalesced in the 19th century. Historically part of County Durham, the town was subsumed into the metropolitan borough of Gateshead in 1974. It lies on the B1426 Sunderland Road and the A184 Felling bypass, less than east of Gateshead town centre, south east of Newcastle-upon- Tyne and 10 miles north west of the City of Sunderland. In 2011, Felling had a population of 8,908. The history of Felling stretches almost eight hundred years. The original manor at Felling was granted in the 13th century and passed through several families until it was passed to the Brandling family in 1509. While Lords of the Manor, several members of this family served as Members of Parliament among other civic duties. They were also instrumental in bringing heavy industry to the area, and Felling Colliery (John Pit), one of the oldest and largest collieries in the region, was developed on their estate. The colliery was the site of two mining disasters which cost over one hundred lives, helping prompt Sir Humphry Davy and George Stephenson to develop their safety lamps (there is a monument to the workers lost in St Mary's churchyard, Heworth). Other heavy industry took root in the 18th and 19th centuries so that Felling developed from a rural scattering of villages into firstly three distinct settlements at Low and High Felling and Felling Shore, then in 1894 these amalgamated with other local villages into the town of Felling, administered by the Felling Urban District Council at Sunderland Road. The areas that Felling council were responsible for were Felling, High Felling, Windy Nook, Whitehills Estate, Leam-Lane Estate, Pelaw, Wardley, Heworth, Bill Quay and Follingsby. The council was disbanded in 1974 when Felling was wholly incorporated into the new Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead. Felling today is broadly residential save some light industry located at the bank of the River Tyne in north Felling. It is governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party. The vast majority of residents identify as white British and, in the north areas particularly, there are high levels of unemployment and deprivation. It is well served by public transport; there are several bus services through the area and Felling lies on the Tyne and Wear Metro line and there are stations at Gateshead Stadium and Felling. Felling town centre remains the principal economic area and has recently benefitted from a \u00a313.5 million regeneration project, with the demolition of the old Co- op supermarket and council building and rebuilding of the town shopping centre shopping units, which now run parallel to a new Asda superstore. The long and rich history of the area is reflected by over a dozen listed buildings, several churches and numerous public houses which are locally listed. It is served by several schools, though levels of educational qualification among residents are comparably low. Leisure provision is good, with four distinctive parks and various riverside facilities. Gateshead International Stadium lies in the area and several professional footballers hail from Felling, including former England international Chris Waddle, as does award-winning author David Almond. ==History== ===Early history=== The name of Felling is recorded as early as 1217 and, in 1920, was said to refer to a clearing where woods and trees were felled.Mawer, 1920: 83\u201384 Since there are no other places in Britain which bear this name, despite country-wide tree felling, it is much more likely to be because it lies on the eastern descent of a Fell, which rises from Team Valley in the west to Low Fell, then still rising to High Fell, before descending down to the Tyne through Felling. Ing is a place name ending which means \"the people of\". In the 13th century, the Prior of Durham enfeoffed Sir Walter de Selby a manor at Felling \"to hold by homage, fealty, knights' service, two marks rent, and suit at the prior's every fortnight\".Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 22 The estate then passed to Walter's son, Adam, whose own son forfeited the estate the manor upon his death, whereupon it was passed to Ralph de Applingden.Surtees, 1820: 85 In 1331, the manor was granted to Sir Thomas Surtees by Bishop Lewis Beaumont, who passed it to his son Alexander and whose own son, Thomas, inherited the estate in 1400 when he was only 20 weeks old. Thomas lived only 35 years, but is notable for having been High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1422.Surtees, 1820: 86 The estate continued to pass through the Surtees family until 1509, when the last surviving member of that family died. There followed a period of extensive litigation as the future of the considerable Surtees estate, which also included Low Dinsdale Manor near Darlington, was contested between the families Brandling, a staunchly Royalist and Catholic family, Blaxton and Wyclyffe.Newman, 1993: 56Surtees, 1820: 86\u201387 While several elements of the estate where divided by share, in 1509 the entire manor of Felling was granted by Deed of Partition to Robert Brandling and his heirs \"for life and to the total extinction\" of any other claims.Surtees, 1820: 87 ===The Brandling family=== Brandling duly lived at Felling with his wife Anne. He became sheriff of Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1524, was mayor of Newcastle five times and was knighted by the Duke of Somerset at Mussleburgh. When he died in 1568, the estate passed to his brother Thomas.Mackenzie, 1825: 470 In 1605, Thomas' grandson, Robert Brandling, inherited the manor. Robert Brandling was granted Newminster Abbey by King James in 1810, served as High Sheriff of Northumberland in 1617 and was in 1621 elected Member of Parliament for Morpeth.Hodgson, 1832: 414 When he died in 1636, the estate passed to his son, Sir Francis Brandling. Francis was also an MP, albeit for Northumberland, between 1824\u201325 though he abandoned Felling in favour of residence at Alnwick Abbey.Browne Willis, 1750: 192 He died in 1641 and was succeeded by Charles Brandling, a cavalry colonel who also resided at both Felling and Alnwick. Charles had two brothers. The older of which, Ralph, was killed at the Battle of Marston Moor,Burke, 1852: 136 while the second brother, Robert, also participated in the English Civil War and was captured in an otherwise successful Royalist engagement at Corbridge in February 1644 after which he switched sides and fought for the Roundheads; an action which earned him the reputation as \"a very knave\" which he carried until his death in 1669. ===Early industrialisation 1680\u20131800=== By the turn of the 18th century, Felling consisted of little more than the large Brandling estate and a small scattering of tiny farming villages.Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 However, Ralph Brandling, the incumbent of the Brandling estate at that time, had come to realise the value of the rich coal deposits on his estate and began drift mining around 1670.Namier, 1995: 113 He initially found the large coal seams under his estate difficult to extract due to their depth, and indeed it was imported coal from Newcastle-upon-Tyne which saw the development of more extensive industries in salt, glass and chemicals which began to attract workers to the area. At around 1750, a large copper-works was opened at the banks of the River Tyne; the first such works to be developed on the river.Lewis, 1848: 227Mackenzie & Ross, 1834: 24 Encouraged by these developments, Ralph Brandling's son, Charles Brandling,Charles Brandling (1733\u20131802) was another member of the family who became an MP, this time for Newcastle-upon-Tyne, in 1784. See Namier, 1995: 113\u201314 firstly commissioned more extensive mining of near-surface coal on his estate and then, encouraged by the discovery of several strata below his estate, began boring operations in 1758 to allow ultimately for deeper coal extraction.Baldwin, 1823: 502 at col.1 The result was the opening of Felling CollieryAlso known as \"Brandling Main\" in 1779, working on the High Main stratum at a depth of 125 fathoms. A brown paper mill was also opened in 1798. ===Felling mining disasters=== Felling Colliery, where two disasters in the space of eighteen months saw over a hundred men and boys killed.On 19 January 1811, the original High Main seam at Felling Colliery was closed, but by that time the colliery had grown enormously.Baldwin, 1823: 502Terminology: A colliery is a coal mine. A pit is a one shaft forming part of a colliery. The colliery was deepened to reach the Low Main seam. Two shafts were provided: John Pit and William Pit.Hodgson, 1999 The Low Main and began operation in October 1810. Disaster struck Felling Colliery on 25 May 1812 when, despite the colliery containing the most up-to- date safety measures,Baldwin, 1823: 503 at col.1 firedamp ignited and at around 11.30 am, \"one of the most tremendous explosions in the history of coal mining took place\". Two explosions rocked the colliery, the blast appearing in both pits. A cloud of coal dust and debris over a radius of a mile and a half was ejected from the colliery.Baldwin, 1823: 504 at col.2 One account recalled: > Immense quantities of dust and coal rose high into the air in an inverted > cone...In the village of Heworth, this cloud caused a darkness like that of > early twilight and covered the roads so thickly that the footsteps of > passengers were deeply imprinted in it. As soon as the explosion was heard, > wives and children of the workmen ran to the pit. Wildness and terror were > pictured in every countenance. The crowd soon collected to several hundreds, > some crying out for a husband, others for a parent or a son, and all > affected by a mixture of horror, anxiety and grief.Baldwin, 1823: 503\u201304 Following the first blast at 11:30, rescue attempts started at 12:15. At 14:00 the second blast occurred and no further rescues occurred. Some 29 men were saved, but the remaining 92 men and boys were killed. Two days later the decision was made to seal the colliery to starve the fire of oxygen. Just one year later, on 24 December 1813, a further catastrophe occurred: > About half-past one o'clock on the morning, an explosion took place in > Felling colliery, by which nine men and thirteen boys were hurried into > eternity, several others severely burnt, and all the underground horses but > one destroyed. The accident occurred at the time of calling course, or when > one set of men were relieving another. Several of the morning shift men were > standing round the mouth of the pit, waiting to go down, when the blast > occurred, and the part who had just descended met it soon after they had > reached the bottom of the shaft; these were most miserably burnt and > mangled.Richardson, 1844 The 200th anniversary of the first disaster was commemorated in Felling on 25 May 2012 by a parade from St Mary's Church at Heworth to the place of the entrance to the colliery at Mulberry Street. (Retrieved 2 August 2012) ===The Industrial Revolution=== The coal staithes at Felling Shore. An ordnance survey map of High and Low Felling in 1862In spite of the disaster, Felling continued to grow and by the time of the explosions the character of Felling had changed substantially. There now existed three distinct villages. Around two miles south east of Gateshead lay High Felling; a residential village in the township of Heworth which had attracted several Wesleyan and Methodist preachers.Whellan, 1856: 804 Slightly to the north lay Low Felling. This was a more heavily industrialised village, containing Felling colliery, a large chemical works and other manufacturers, though in 1834 it was noted that there also existed \"a few neat houses and many cottages for the colliery which, with small gardens attached, give an aspect of comfort to the village\".MacKenzie and Ross, 1834: 22 At the north and on the bank of the River Tyne, a populous manufacturing and trading village had developed known as Felling Shore, spreading across three miles of the bank of the Tyne. A Methodist church was built there in 1805. This was accompanied by several shops and four public houses frequented predominantly by seamen and workers at the adjacent quay, coal staithes and ship building works where vessels of excellent quality were built. Industry continued to flourish here; the copperworks established in the 18th century still operated and had expanded, an oil and a paper mill had also developed, along with forging works for anchors and shovels. In 1827 the Friars Goose Chemical Works was opened by Anthony Clapham. In 1834 a second large chemical works was established by Hugh Lee Pattinson, John Lee and George Burnett;\"Pattinson, Hugh Lee\". Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, 2012. it soon employed around 300 men. (Retrieved 3 August 2012) Grindstone quarries produced high quality stone and a brownware pottery under Mr. Joseph Wood had opened for business. In 1842, Brandling Station was opened at Mullbery Street in Felling on the Brandling Junction railway linking Gateshead, South Shields and Sunderland.Herapath, 1839: 402 This is one of the oldest passenger stations in the world.Tindle, 2011: 11 By around 1870, Felling had reached its industrial peak. Historian John Marius Wilson noted: > FELLING, a large village and a chapelry in Jarrow parish, Durham. The > village stands on the Northeastern railway, 1\u00bd mile SE of Gateshead; > increased recently from two hamlets to its present condition; is maintained > by factories and by mining operations; connects with Felling-Shore, a coal- > shipping place on the Tyne; and has a post-office under Gateshead, a r. > station, a church built in 1866, four dissenting chapels, and a Roman > Catholic chapel.

(Retrieved 3 > August 2012) ===1870 \u2013 present day=== The clean-up begins after the Felling derailment in 1907, which cost two lives and saw eight more seriously injured. Aerial photograph of Gateshead and Felling (1975)The industrial heights proved reasonably short-lived. By 1860, improvements to access along the River Tyne only served to highlight the better sites on the Tyne bank and so shipbuilding at Felling Shore began to decline. This decline was hastened by the limited space at Felling dock, which could not reasonably be extended and so progress enjoyed elsewhere was never matched at Felling.Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 at para. 5 At around the same time, the chemical industry began to stall as bigger and more efficient competitors overtook their Felling counterparts. The industrial decline was matched by continuous residential growth, so that by the Victorian era those industrial elements which survived were met by a large sprawl of housing from the south where High and Low Felling had effectively merged.GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.2 At 10:52 am on 26 March 1907, an express passenger train travelling from Heworth signal box derailed on the approach to Felling station.Druitt, 1907: 68 The cause was a combination of a sharp frost in the morning and unseasonal heat later in the day which saw the track expand and kink.Druitt, 1907: 70 The derailment, which saw all bar two carriages rolled over entirely, cost two passengers their lives, with eight more seriously hurt and a further 34 suffering minor injuries such as shock. The decline of heavy industry, meanwhile, continued apace. In 1932 the large chemical works at Felling Shore closed and was left derelict, leaving behind a 2 million tonne heap of spoil. Felling Colliery, the oldest and most extensive of all Felling's industry, had changed hands numerous times after the Brandlings finally sold their stake in the 1850s and ultimately closed in 1931 with the loss of 581 jobs. Fairs boat yard at Felling Shore had been sold in 1919 and became Mitchison's ship yard, but this too closed in 1964. In place of industry came housing. The high density terraced housing which had accompanied the industrial boom of the 19th century had sprawled south and was soon joined by a wave of development at the run of the 20th century.GVA, 2006: 11 at para. 2.3 The earlier housing came at Stuart Street, Temple Street and Helmsdale Avenue in the form of Tyneside flats.GVA, 2006: 13 at para. 2.9 In the inter-war years, whole derelict industrial areas were cleared and large council estates of semi-detached houses, with front and back gardens, were built at the Old Fold, Stoneygate, Brandling and Nest estates.GVA, 2006: 13 at para. 2.10 By the time that Felling ceased to be an independent town and was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead in 1974, Felling had become a \"dormitory area\" and remains so today.Hewitt (part three), 1990: 1 at para. 8 ==Economy== View along Felling Town Centre There are two principal economic areas in Felling. The first of these is at Felling Shore, where the East Gateshead Riverside Park was built in 1966 and which, combined with the Felling Shore industrial estate, today houses 241 businesses employing around 6,400 people. The second is in central Felling in the town centre area around Victoria Square. The town centre has seen massive investment over recent years, with the complete redevelopment of the main shopping centre and addition of a new Asda superstore, a Greggs bakery, Card Factory shop, Subway sandwich outlet and a local taxi business. Other amenities include a Post Office, Heron Foods store and several bookmakers, as well as 4 public houses and fast food outlets NPSD, 2006: 44\u201345 at para. 4.39NPSD, 2006: 45 at para. 4.43 The Felling Health Care Centre is the main source of General Healthcare for the town's population, and houses St Alban's medical group and Crowhall Medical Group. The GP surgery also has a small Boots pharmacy in addition to the larger Boots store in the town centre. Felling has one small dentist practice located on the B1426 main commuter road that connects Heworth to Gateshead town centre Levels of unemployment in Felling are high. Only 52.4% of the total working age population are in employment, as compared to 61.7% in the borough overall. Around 10% of residents claim Jobseeker's Allowance; this is double the Gateshead average and is the highest figure in the borough.FWF, 2012: 2 Youth unemployment levels are also very high at 14%, which compares to a borough average of 9% and is also the highest figure in Gateshead. The average income of residents is only \u00a318,000 per annum; this compares to a Gateshead average of \u00a327,000 and is the lowest figure in the borough.FWF. 2012: 3 ==Geography and topography== Felling shore, where the north of Felling meets the River Tyne Felling, at latitude 54.950\u00b0 N and longitude 1.564\u00b0 W, lies less than south and east of Gateshead town centre on a bed of carboniferous sandstone and clay, interspersed with coal measures laid down around 300 million years.Hewitt (part two), 1990: 2 It is split bilaterally by the Felling By-PassNPSD, 2006: 30 at para. 2.96 to the north and by Sunderland Road more centrally.GE06, 2008: 4 The distance from Felling to London is . The urban expansion of Gateshead makes exact overall boundaries difficult to define. Although administratively considered one area, official documentation has split Felling into three distinct neighbourhoods: North, Central and High Felling.GE01, 2008GE06, 2008GE08, 2008 Felling North is roughly comparable to the old settlement at Felling Shore, bounded to the north by the River Tyne and the south by Sunderland Road.GE01, 2008: 5 The other neighbourhoods also broadly follow their historical boundaries; the central area includes Felling town centre and the surrounding streets, while High Felling incorporates Coldwell Lane and the adjoining streets moving south towards Windy Nook.GE06, 2008: 5GE08, 2008: 5 The steep topography offers some excellent views into Newcastle-upon-Tyne, such as this from St John's Lane.Felling lies on land which is steep at the riverbank but which initially flattens at the north then begins to climb,GE01, 2008: 2 with some slope south to north centrallyGE06, 2008: 2 before consistently sloping, at times steeply, in High Felling. At the south-west corner, the land reaches a maximum height of around above sea- level.GE08, 2008: 2 Felling is now largely bordered by settlements which are part of the metropolitan borough. These are Windy Nook to the south, Deckham and the town of Gateshead to the west and Heworth and the Leam Lane Estate to the east. To the extreme north, Felling is bounded by the River Tyne, the largest river in the North East of England. This affords very good views into Newcastle upon Tyne.NSPD, 2006: 26 at para. 2.90 Land use is mixed. The land to the extreme north adjacent to the river is mostly industrial, split by the Felling By-Pass.NPSD, 2006: 29 at para. 2.97 The land south of the By-Pass towards the town centre is predominantly residential and includes the Nest, Brandling, Stoneygate and the Old Fold estates.NPSD, 2006: 29 at para. 2.98 Centrally the land is mixed between residential properties and the largely commercial use at Crowhall Lane and Victoria Square.NPSD, 2006: 44 at para. 4.38 At High Felling, land use is predominantly residential but there is around 25% green-space, including a park, cricket ground and urban open space to the south at Albion Street. ==Governance== {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 2em; width: 40%; font-size: 90%;\" cellspacing=\"3\" !colspan=\"4\"|Gateshead Council, Felling\u20132012 local electionsAuthor unknown, \"Local Elections 2012\u2013 Deckham\" , Gateshead MBC.

The council \"was the offspring of that ancient township and inherited its customs, its local government, its land and its people\", so that all of those villages combined to become the town of Felling.Hewitt (Part one), 1990: 1 In 1902, the council moved to new administrative buildings at Sunderland Road, known thereafter as Felling Town Hall.Tindle, 2011: 7 The urban council administered the Felling District until its final meeting, concluded with a rendition of the Hokey cokey, on 28 March 1974, when Felling was incorporated into the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead by the Local Government Act 1972.Manders, 1973: 26 Immediately prior the creation of the metropolitan borough, Felling was an independent town but improved housing elsewhere and better transport links have seen the area decline in stature so that, today, Felling is simply a council ward in the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead.Arkenford, 2010: 60 It is approximately in area and has a population of 8,202.FWF, 2012: 1 It is represented by three councillors.
