The Stolen Scream on a shirt ==The Stolen Scream== In February 2006, Noam took a series of self-portrait images showing himself screaming and posted them online to a photo sharing website. His screaming self-portraits gained popularity, and artists used the self-portraits as inspiration for their own art. Unbeknownst to Noam, his image was used as a symbol of civil unrest appearing on posters and graffiti in many countries such as Iran, Spain, Argentina, Egypt and Honduras. Companies also misappropriated the use of his face for financial gain, selling T-shirts, books, magazines, and other paraphernalia. This story was used by news outlets and college textbooks to exemplify the growing debate between the dissemination of intellectual property online and copyright issues. As the story gained notoriety Noam received recognition as the man behind the face of \"The Stolen Scream\". ==See also== * The Scream == Some photographs by Noam Galai == Sam Reich Speaking at AOL Build Series.png|Sam Reich Shay Doron (by Noam G).jpg|Shay Doron RananLurie1.jpg|Ranan Lurie ==References== ==External links== * Noam Galai - Official * The Stolen Scream - Blog * The Stolen Scream on Instagram Category:1984 births Category:Israeli photographers Category:Photographers from New York (state) Category:Living people Category:American portrait photographers ",
