    "text": "Pleurotus djamor, commonly known as the pink oyster mushroom, is a species of fungus in the family Pleurotaceae. It was originally named Agaricus djamor by the German-born botanist Georg Eberhard Rumphius and sanctioned under that name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821. It was known by many different names before being transferred to the genus Pleurotus by Karel Bernard Boedijn in 1959. == Properties == The flavor of the pink oyster mushroom has been described as meaty and fishy. Just like most mushrooms it is quite umami. Its texture is both meaty and chewy. When fried until crispy, it resembles bacon or even ham. However, when it is raw, it has a sour taste. The pink oyster mushroom, unsurprisingly has a pink color. When cooked, however, the color quickly fades. It has a curly cap which is 2 - 5 cm in diameter. The caps are also quite thin. The stem is very short or even non existent. The reason why it is very rare to find in supermarkets is that it has a shelf life of only about a day. Since it is only harvested from spring to fall, it is only available during that time. == Uses == Pink Flamingo oyster mushrooms are best suited for cooked applications such as saut\u00e9ing, boiling, roasting, or frying. They can be saut\u00e9ed or stir-fried with other vegetables, added to pasta dishes, sprinkled on top of pizza, added to grain bowls, saut\u00e9ed with eggs, boiled in soups, chowders, or stews, or cooked into risotto. They can also be saut\u00e9ed and mixed with cream-based white sauces for added flavor. Due to their meaty texture, these mushrooms require thorough cooking to develop their flavor and an edible consistency. Pink oyster mushrooms pair well with coriander, parsley, mint, basil, garlic, ginger, onion, sesame oil, soy sauce, bell pepper, red cabbage, broccolini, baby corn, leeks, quinoa, noodles, rice, and potatoes. ==See also== *List of Pleurotus species ==References== ==External links== * Category:Edible fungi Category:Fungi described in 1821 Category:Pleurotaceae ",
