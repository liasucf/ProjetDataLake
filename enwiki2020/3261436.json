Scouting was founded in 1914 and was among the charter members of the World Organization of the Scout Movement in 1922, while nominally independent from Britain.John S.

Other recipients include Aziz Osman Bakir in 1971, John M. Lioufis in 1978, and Gamal Khashaba in 1982. == Structure and program== Most Scout troops are associated with schools, clubs, mosques and churches. Rover units are associated with high schools and universities. Egyptian Scouts play an important role in community service. They are involved in projects of desert reclamation, work camps, blood drives, medical care and other projects. Scouts are offered vocational training and the skills needed to help develop communities. Scouts learn the importance of planting trees where firewood is scarce, building energy efficient stoves and making good use of their skills of carpentry, electricity and plumbing. The EFSGG has four central associations: * Boy Scouts * Sea Scouts * Air Scouts * Girl Guides - Gamiet Morshidat Gomhoriet Misr al Arabiah Each of these central associations has a correspondent regional association in the 26 governorates of Egypt; a coordination committee in each governorate organizes the activities and the cooperation between the associations. *The Girl Guides association has three age divisions: ** Brownies ** Girl Guides ** Rovers The Cairo International Scout Center is a lavish six-floor building next to Cairo International Stadium that welcomes all Scouts, nonScout organizations and individual guests. The home of the Arab Scout Region, it hosts both conference areas and hostel quarters. In addition, Egypt has a national Scout center, El- Seleen. The Scout Motto is Kun Musta'idan or \u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0633\u062a\u0639\u062f\u0627\u064b, translating as Be Prepared in Arabic. The noun for a single Scout is Kashaf or \u0643\u0634\u0627\u0641 in Arabic. The Scout emblem incorporates elements of each of the four central associations, as well as a lotus. ==Emblems== File:Egyptian Boy Scouts Association.png|The Egyptian Boy Scout emblem incorporates the sacred blue lotus File:Scouts Wadi el Nil (Copts and Egyptian Catholic Christians) 1930s.png|The Scouts Wadi el Nil from the 1930s for Copts and Egyptian Catholic Christians superimposed the national Scout emblem atop an ankh, the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic character that read \"life\" == International Scouting units in Egypt == German Kolonialpfadfinder visiting Cairo, 1931 In addition, there are American Boy Scouts in Cairo and Alexandria, linked to the Direct Service branch of the Boy Scouts of America, which supports units around the world.
