The Fish Market is one of the few surviving open air seafood markets on the east coast of the United States. A local landmark, the Maine Avenue Fish Market is the oldest continuously operating fish market in the United States, seventeen years older than New York City's Fulton Fish Market.New Fulton Fish Market Cooperative, \"About the Fulton Fish Market\". ==Overview== Fresh seafood is laid out for customers on one of several floating barge vendors, as it appeared in March 2006. Located on the Southwest Waterfront of Washington, D.C., just under the shadow of Interstate 395, the Maine Avenue Fish Market stands as a cultural relic popular with locals but unknown to many of the tourists who flock to the monuments and museums just five blocks north. There are over ten stores, each with a specialty. The Maine Avenue Fish Market is open each day of the week, but the largest selection of fish is on display Friday evening through Sunday. A multitude of fresh seafood is sold on floating barges that line the pier along Water Street. These barges, which rise and fall with the tide, are a tribute to an old tradition dating back to the Civil War. For years, fishmongers would navigate theirs once a week down the Potomac to the Chesapeake. There, they would purchase seafood from the watermen and head back to the Washington, DC wharf. In 1961, refrigerated trucks became more efficient to bring the catch from the Eastern Shore and the \"buy boats\" were permanently docked and later replaced by the steel barges which exist today.Islanders Stay Hooked On SW Fish Market; Good Pay Salves Life Style Concerns: [FINAL Edition] by Eugene L.

However, the Market is somewhat isolated from the Mall due to its location under the freeway, and the city has refrained from promoting it as an attraction due to uncertainty about whether it can be preserved as an outdoor floating market. ===21st Century Redevelopment=== As late as 2009, plans were underway to once again redevelop the entire length of Maine Avenue and remove the frontage road of Water Street, on which the existing waterfront buildings and wharf are located. It is unclear what will be the impact on the historic market, or whether it will be wholly preserved, but all of the associated support structures on Water Street, including the sole remaining land-based eatery, were scheduled to be razed \u201dto keep the Fish Market in safe and operable condition until the redevelopment occurs\u201d.
