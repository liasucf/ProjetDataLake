This list of tallest buildings in Mississauga refers to the tallest buildings in the City of Mississauga, Ontario, Canada. Mississauga is a city in Southern Ontario located in the Regional Municipality of Peel, and in the western part of the Greater Toronto Area. With a population of 721,599 as of the Canada 2016 Census, it is Canada's sixth-most populous municipality, and has almost doubled in population in each of the last two decades, leading to a series of massive and ongoing construction booms which continue to drastically alter the city's skyline. Mississauga is now the third most populous city on the Great Lakes, surpassing the cities proper of Detroit, Milwaukee and Cleveland over the last two decades. Developed as a suburb of Toronto, Mississauga's growth is attributed to its proximity to that city. However, Mississauga's extensive corporate and industrial employment opportunities differentiate it from suburban bedroom communities. The city has also been trying to create a distinctive image for itself over the past few years. It held an international architectural design competition in 2006 for a 56-storey, tall condominium tower, called Absolute World, that is intended to be a landmark for the city. As a major city in its own right, Mississauga has an easily identifiable skyline that, as of August 2020, has 28 buildings rising over tall with 10 more under construction. The tallest buildings in the city are the two iconic towers of Absolute World which rise and tall. By 2023, there will be 4 skyscrapers surpassing 170m. The tallest would be M3, a proposed building, which would stand at about 260 m, with 81 stories. Upon completion, it would be the tallest building outside of Toronto. ==Tallest Buildings== This list ranks buildings in Mississauga that stand at least 100 m (328 ft) tall, based on CTBUH height measurement standards. This includes spires and architectural details but does not include antenna masts. {| class= \"wikitable sortable\" width=60% !
