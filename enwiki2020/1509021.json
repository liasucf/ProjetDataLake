He studied at Aachen, Berlin, G\u00f6ttingen, and Karlsruhe. His doctoral adviser was David Hilbert. He taught at Br\u00fcnn in 1905, Aachen in 1912, and at the Technical University of Berlin in 1919. In 1927, Hamel studied the size of the key space for the Kryha encryption device. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1932 at Zurich and in 1936 at Oslo. He was the author of several important treatises on mechanics. He became a member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1938 and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences in 1953. He died in Landshut, Bavaria. ==Selected publications== * (\"On the geometries in which the straight lines are the shortest\", Hamel's doctoral dissertation on Hilbert's fourth problem.
