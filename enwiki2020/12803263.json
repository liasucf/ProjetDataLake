It was centered on what is now part of the city of Okazaki, Aichi. ==History== \u014coka Tadasuke, the famous magistrate who had served the 9th Tokugawa sh\u014dgun, Tokugawa Yoshimune, and who had successfully carried out the Ky\u014dh\u014d Reforms received an additional 4,000 koku in revenue on his promotion to s\u014dshaban in 1748. This put him over the 10,000 koku requirement to be styled as daimy\u014d, and he received the newly created fief of Nishi-\u014chira as his domain. However, he never relocated to his new territory, and resided in Edo to his death in 1757. Nishi-\u014chira Domain was not a single contiguous territory, but consisted of several widely scattered holdings: in addition to 12 villages in Nukata District, the territory consisted of 5 villages in Kamo District, 5 villages in Hoi District, 2 villages in Omi District in Mikawa, 3 villages in Ichihara District, Kazusa Province and the original 2 villages of the \u014coka clan in K\u014dza District, Sagami Province. The domain was inherited by \u014coka Tadasuke's heirs after his death, but it was not until 1748, during the tenure of his grandson, \u014coka Tadatsune, that a jin'ya fortified residence was built in Nishi-\u014chira to be the nominal capital of the domain. Due to its special relationship with the Tokugawa shogunate, the \u014coka clan was one of the few clans exempted from the sankin k\u014dtai regulations, and lived in their Edo residence full-time. The graves of all of the daimy\u014d of Nishi-\u014chira are located at the \u014coka clan temple of J\u014dken- ji in Chigasaki, Kanagawa. During the Bakumatsu period, Nishi-\u014chira remained loyal to the Tokugawa shogunate, but after the Battle of Toba\u2013Fushimi in the Boshin War, capitulated to the new Meiji government. After the abolition of the han system in July 1871, it became \u201cNishi-\u014chira Prefecture\u201d, which later became part of Aichi Prefecture. The domain had a population of 6,945 people in 1709 households per an 1869 census. It maintained its Edo residence kamiyashiki in Sakuradamon.Edo daimyo.net ==List of daimy\u014ds== * 30px \u014coka clan (fudai) 1748\u20131871 {| class=wikitable ! #||Name || Tenure || Courtesy title || Court Rank || kokudaka ||Lineage |- ||1||\u014coka Tadasuke (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u76f8)||1748\u20131751|| Echizen-no-kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku||4th son of hatamoto \u014coka Tadataka |- ||2||\u014coka Tadayoshi (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u5b9c)||1755\u20131766||Echizen-no-kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku||2nd son of Tadasuke |- ||3||\u014coka Tadatsune (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u6052)||1766\u20131784||Echizen-no-kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku||2nd son of Tadayoshi |- ||4||\u014coka Tadatomo (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u8207)||1784\u20131786||Echizen-no-kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 13,000 koku||3rd son of Ogasawara Nagamichi |- ||5||\u014coka Tadayori (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u79fb)||1786\u20131828||Echizen-no-kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku||3rd son of Tadatsune |- ||6 ||\u014coka Tadayoshi (2nd) (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u611b)||1828\u20131857|| Echizen-no- kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku||son of Tadayori |- ||7||\u014coka Tadataka (\u5927\u5ca1\u5fe0\u656c)||1857\u20131871||Echizen-no-kami (\u8d8a\u524d\u5b88)|| Lower 5th (\u5f93\u4e94\u4f4d\u4e0b)|| 10,000 koku||5th son of Tadayori |- |} ==References== * ==External links== * Nishi- \u014chira on \"Edo 300 HTML\" ==Notes== Category:Domains of Japan Category:1748 establishments in Japan Category:States and territories established in 1748 Category:1871 disestablishments in Japan Category:States and territories disestablished in 1871 Category:Mikawa Province Category:Domains of Aichi Prefecture ",
