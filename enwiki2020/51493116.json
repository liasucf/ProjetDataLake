    "text": "The Concerto, BWV 525a (alternatively: BWV deest), is a trio sonata in C major for violin, cello and basso continuo, based on material otherwise found in Johann Sebastian Bach's first Organ Sonata, BWV 525 (outer movements), and Flute Sonata in A major, BWV 1032 (middle movement). The oldest extant manuscript containing the BWV 525a arrangement, D-B Mus.ms. Bach St 345, is dated to the middle of the 18th century. Although this version of Bach's sonata movements may have originated during his lifetime in the circle around him, it seems unlikely that the composer supervised, or even ordered, the manufacture of the string trio adaptation, thus the arrangement has been listed in BWV Anh. II, that is the (Anh.) of doubtful works, in the 1998 edition of the (BWV). Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel published BWV 525a in 1965. Digital facsimiles of 18th- and 19th-century manuscript copies of the arrangement, in which the sonata is titled \"Concerto\", became available in the 21st century. ==References== ==Sources== * * * * * ==External links== * Category:Bach: spurious and doubtful works Category:Arrangements of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach Category:Trio sonatas Category:Compositions for string trio Category:Compositions in C major ",
