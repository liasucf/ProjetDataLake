    "text": "\"It Ain't the Whiskey\" is a song co-written by Greg Barnhill, Jim Daddario and Cole Deggs, and recorded by American country music singer Gary Allan. It is the third and final single from his 2013 album Set You Free. ==Content== The song is a ballad with a \"gnawing guitar solo and steel\" that takes place at an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. In it, the male narrator states that his life problems are not caused by substance abuse, but rather by a lost love. ==Critical reception== Billy Dukes of Taste of Country wrote that \"After two uplifting singles, Gary Allan has become the dark, heartbroken and wretched singer his fans have loved for over a decade. \u2018It Ain\u2019t the Whiskey\u2019 is his bread and butter, and the singer sounds better than ever on this highlight from the \u2018Set You Free\u2019 album.\" Joseph Hudak of Country Weekly rated it \"A\", saying that \"Yet for all of the intrinsic sadness of the lyrics\u2026and the hypnotic production, the song doesn\u2019t plod or bore. Rather, it captivates.\" ==Music video== The song's music video was released in December 2013. It is shot in black-and-white, and alternates between shots of Allan performing the song with his band, and shots of him portraying a character \"who has lost love\". ==Chart performance== {|class=\"wikitable sortable\" !align=\"left\"|Chart (2013) !align=\"center\"|Peak position |- |- |- |} ==References== Category:2013 songs Category:2013 singles Category:MCA Nashville Records singles Category:Gary Allan songs Category:Song recordings produced by Jay Joyce Category:Songs written by Greg Barnhill Category:Music videos directed by TK McKamy ",
