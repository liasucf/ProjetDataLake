Metal Mulisha Inc. products are sold at various retail stores and company owned stores. It also offers Metal Mulisha energy drinks under the same brand in a joint venture with Rockstar. The company currently employs about 450 people. The Metal Mulisha Monster Jam Monster truck was debuted in 2012 at Reliant Stadium in Houston, TX. ==Clothing== Formed in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, Metal Mulisha T-shirts were fashionable among youth in the 2000s. The shirts often feature existential slogans or quotes that tout the virtues of extreme sports. In 2010, the Murrieta Valley Unified School District banned Metal Mulisha clothing at its schools, due to graphics resembling Nazi symbols and iconography. Some graphics appearing on Metal Mulisha's clothing line include a skull wearing a helmet resembling one worn by German soldiers in World War II, while on the company's logo, the \"S\" in \"Mulisha\" is represented graphically by a lightning bolt that resembles the double lightning bolts insignia Runic \"\u16cb\u16cb\" of the Nazi major paramilitary organization Schutzstaffel, or SS. Rabbi Barry Ulrych, of the B\u2019nai Chaim of Murrieta synagogue, regarding the images appearing on Metal Mulisha products, stated \u201cPeople say it\u2019s just a fashion \u2014 it\u2019s more than that \u2014 it\u2019s an identity...These symbols are not as neutral as one might think. Symbols can hurt, and some symbols are intimidating...With this symbolism, they are glorifying the Nazi past. You can\u2019t go through life being ignorant of symbols.\u201d In a letter, the company countered with the statement \u201cMetal Mulisha founders and riders are devout Christians, espousing those values prized in the religious community.\" ==References== ==External links== * Category:1990s fashion Category:Clothing companies of the United States Category:Clothing companies established in 1997 Category:Companies based in Carlsbad, California Category:Privately held companies based in California Category:Sportswear brands Category:Clothing brands of the United States Category:Monster trucks Category:Freestyle motocross ",
