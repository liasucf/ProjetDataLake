Bartlett was also the first Yonex contract Professional. After retiring from his tennis career, Bartlett has involved himself in the following ventures; Bartlett headed up a program for the ATP in 1979 to introduce prize money into the qualifying events in Europe. Partnered by his wife, they organised over $100,000 in prize money by switching the qualifying events to other towns 50 km away. This has led to many ATP tournaments being formed. John Bartlett was also the SE Asian Manager and Australian director for Penn Racquet Sports. Bartlett developed and distributed his own tennis ball \"The Bartlett Tennis Ball\" before encountering political difficulties with Tennis Australia. Bartlett currently is working as tennis analyst for SEN Sports Radio Melbourne and also headed up their live commentary team for the 2011 Australian Open. ==Career finals== ===Doubles (1 win)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:20px\" class=\"unsortable\"|No. !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:150px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:140px\"|Partner !style=\"width:140px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:120px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win | 1. | 1977 | Cairo, Egypt | Clay | John Marks | Pat DuPr\u00e9 Chris Lewis | 7\u20135, 6\u20131, 6\u20133 |} ==Junior Grand Slam titles== ===Doubles: 1 === {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% |- !style=\"width:40px\"|Result !style=\"width:50px\"|Year !style=\"width:170px\"|Championship !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:170px\"|Partner !style=\"width:170px\"|Opponents !style=\"width:120px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |-style=\"background:#ffc;\" | style=\"background:#98fb98;\"|Win |1967 | Australian Open |Grass | Sven Ginman | Dave Wright Ian Fletcher | 6\u20133, 6\u20135 |} ==External links== * * Category:1948 births Category:Living people Category:Australian businesspeople Category:Australian male tennis players Category:Australian radio personalities Category:Australian tennis commentators Category:Sportspeople from Wollongong Category:Tennis people from New South Wales ",
