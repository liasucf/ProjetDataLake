Northern Illinois took the early lead on a Christian Hagan 32-yard field goal in the first quarter. However, the Eagles responded with their own field goal shortly before the end of the first quarter to tie the game at three. Following a 60-yard run by NIU quarterback Ryan Graham, Graham hit D.J. Brown on a 15-yard pass for the first touchdown of the game and put the Huskies up 10\u20133. BC kicked their second field goal of the game a few possessions later to cut the NIU lead to 10\u20136.

Starting NIU quarterback Ryan Graham missed the game with a shoulder injury and was expected to miss a few more games. The Huskies jumped to an early 7\u20130 lead on backup QB Daniel Santacaterina's pass to Spencer Tears from 29 yards out. Eastern answered with a field goal to cut the lead to 7\u20133. The Huskie defense intercepted the Panthers on their next possession and scored on a Marcus Jones four-yard run to increase the lead to 14\u20133 early in the second quarter. Following a missed field goal, the Huskies scored another touchdown on a 19-yard pass from Santacaterina to Christian Blake. The Huskies added another touchdown, following another NIU interception, on another Marcus Jones run, this one from one yard out to take a 28\u20133 lead as the rout was on.

The NIU defense played well, allowing 60 yards rushing and 187 yards overall. The NIU offense put up 230 yards passing and 269 yard rushing in the easy win over the Panthers. ===at Nebraska=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |0\u20132 |Sep 8, 1990 |Neb, 60\u201314 |} In their first road game of the season, the Huskies traveled to Lincoln, Nebraska to take on the Cornhuskers. Nebraska got the ball first and moved down the field to reach the NIU 13-yard line. Looking to take the early lead, Husker quarterback Tanner Lee threw the ball to the right, but Huskie defensive back read the play beautifully and picked off the pass, returning it 87 yards to give the Huskies an early 7\u20130 lead. After each team punted on their next two possessions, Lee was intercepted again, this time by Jawuan Johnson who returned the pick 25 yards for a touchdown and a 14\u20130 lead. The NIU defense further held the Huskers in check in the first half, holding Nebraska scoreless as they missed a field goal to end the half giving NIU the 14\u20130 lead at halftime. In the second half, neither team was able to manage anything on their first two possessions, but Nebraska was finally able to put points on the board after forcing NIU returner Jalen Embry to fumble a punt which the Huskers recovered. Two plays later, Lee scored for Nebraska, cutting the lead to 14\u20137. NIU was forced punt on their ensuing possession and the Huskers converted a 36-yard field goal with 15 seconds remaining in the third quarter. NIU's offense again managed nothing and was forced to punt. The Huskers went 63 yards on their next possession before Lee scored on a one-yard run as the Huskie dream story appeared to be over with Nebraska taking the lead 17\u201314. However, NIU answered on their next possession, going 75 yards in six plays before Jordan Huff scored from two yards out to retake the lead 21\u201317. Nebraska's next possession ended on fourth down as Mycial Allen broke up a fourth down pass from Lee. Following yet another NIU punt, Josh Corcoran intercepted Lee yet again in Nebraska territory and the Huskies were able to run out the clock clinching the 21\u201317 win. The win moved the Huskies to 2\u20131 on the season. The NIU offense only mustered 213 yards in the game, but forced three key Nebraska turnovers. Jordan Huff rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown as the NIU defense held the Cornhuskers to 384 yards of offense. The Huskies became the first team not in a Power 5 conference or major independent to win in Lincoln since Southern Miss knocked off the Cornhuskers in 2004. Northern Illinois moved to 4\u20131 against Big Ten teams under fifth-year coach Rod Carey. ===at San Diego State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |0\u20133 |Sep 17, 2016 |SDSU, 42\u201328 |} In their second straight road game, NIU traveled to the West Coast to face the Aztecs in San Diego, California. The game did not start well for the Huskies as the Aztecs returned the opening kick for a touchdown to put NIU in an early hole 7\u20130. NIU answered on their first possession as Daniel Santacaterina hit Christian Blake for a 34-yard touchdown to tie the game. Special teams would let the Huskies down as the Huskies fumbled on the ensuing punt by the Aztecs which set them up at the NIU 33 for 33-yard touchdown run as SDSU regained the lead 14\u20137. Santacaterina answered again for the Huskies, hitting Christian Blake for 10-yard touchdown pass. However, in the second quarter, Santacaterina would make a mistake throwing a pick-six to SDSU's Tariq Thompson which again gave the Aztecs the lead at 21\u201314. The Aztecs would add another touchdown via a touchdown pass and a field goal near the end of the first half to take a commanding 31\u201314 lead. NIU, however, was not ready to give in. Santacaterina hit Spencer Tears on an 81-yard touchdown pass on the second play of the third quarter to bring the Huskies within 10 at 31\u201321. Following a 50-yard pass to set up the Huskies at the Aztec 10, Marcus Childers ran the ball in to close the lead to 31\u201328. A SDSU field goal in the first minute of the fourth quarter pushed the lead to six as the Huskies looked to defeat the No. 19-ranked Aztecs. The NIU offense could not garner another point as they turned the ball over on three of their last four possession (two interceptions and one turnover on downs) as the Huskies fell 34\u201328. The loss dropped the Huskies to 2\u20132 on the season as they got read for MAC play. ===Kent State=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |20\u20133 |Nov 25, 2016 |NIU, 31\u201321 |} NIU returned home to open MAC play against the Golden Flashes at Huskie Stadium.

The NIU defense held the Flashes to 131 total yards as the majority of the game was played in a rain storm. Shawun Lurry, Jawuan Johnson, and Bobby Jones IV intercepted passes in the game for the Huskies as they forced four Kent State turnovers. Childers threw for 114 yards while rushing for 65 in the easy 24\u20133 win over Kent State. The win was NIU's 21st in the last 22 games against MAC Eastern Division teams.

With less than 10 minutes remaining in the game, Buffalo moved to midfield, but had their ensuing pass intercepted by Jawuan Johnson. An NIU field goal attempt was no good and the Bulls were forced to punt with just over four minutes remaining in the game. The NIU offense took over and was able to run out the clock, giving the Huskies a 14\u201313 win. The win moved NIU to 4\u20132 on the season and 2\u20130 in MAC play. ===at Bowling Green=== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- align=\"center\" |- align=\"center\" |9\u201311 |Nov 1, 2016 |NIU, 45\u201320 |} The Huskies again went on the road, this time to Ohio to face Bowling Green in their third MAC game of the season.

The NIU defense held the Eagles to another field goal attempt, this time good, to return the Eagle lead to seven at 17\u201310. Neither team's offense could manage anything further in the third quarter, but after a bad punt set EMU up at the NIU 45-yard line early in the fourth quarter, the Eagles extend the lead on an Isaac Holder 45-yard touchdown pass.
