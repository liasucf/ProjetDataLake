XHEPR-FM's transmitter is located south of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in the Sierra Presidio mountain range. ==History== Planeta 99.1 logo used from 2015-2018 and in June and early July 2019 XHEPR's concession was awarded to Javier Moreno Valle, a Mexican businessman and founder of Mexico City television station XHTVM-TV, on September 30, 1994. In 2000, Moreno Valle, facing difficulty with a dispute over the Mexico City station, sold the station to Radio Integral, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo ACIR), which had already been operating the station as grupera \"La Comadre\". That year, in partnership with US company Clear Channel Communications, which at the time owned 40% of ACIR, XHEPR became \"99.1 The Bandit\", playing classic rock in English. It later became classic hits-formatted \"The Eagle 99.1\". Eventually, ACIR sold XHEPR to Grupo Radiorama (with operation handled by Grupo Radio M\u00e9xico), though the concession remained in the name of Radio Integral until late 2015. The station was initially known as \"Pancho 99.1\" under GRM management, later changing its name to \"Radio Centro 99.1\". In 2015, XHEPR took on the Planeta Spanish CHR format from 103.5 as part of a reorganization of GRM stations in Ju\u00e1rez. On May 8, 2018, GRM and Radiorama swapped the frequencies of their pop stations in Ju\u00e1rez, with Planeta moving from 99.1 to XHIM-FM 105.1 and @FM moving from 105.1 to 99.1. On May 8, 2019, XHEPR flipped to grupera, branded as \"Madre 99.1\". On June 15, Madre moved to 105.1 and Planeta returned to the 99.1 frequency. Within a month, however, XHEPR dropped Planeta and became Est\u00e9reo Vida. That format lasted less than a year, as the station flipped to Studio 99.1, mirroring the 1980s- and 1990s-focused classic hits format installed on XHFI-FM in Chihuahua, on July 1, 2020. ==References== Category:Radio stations in Chihuahua Category:Radio stations established in 1994 Category:Mass media in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez Category:1994 establishments in Mexico ",
