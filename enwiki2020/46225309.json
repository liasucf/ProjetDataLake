Mainly a central defender , he can also play as a left back or left winger. Tarek has also been capped for the Egyptian national team. ==Club career== ===Early career=== Born in Los Angeles, California, Tarek moved to Egypt at early age, settling in Asyut. After being coached by a German manager at Asyut Cement, he joined ENPPI Club in 2009, aged 17; at that time he was mainly used as a striker. In May 2010 Tarek moved to Europe, joining German side FC Magdeburg. Initially on a trial basis, he was subsequently offered a contract and was assigned to the under-19 squad. In the 2011 summer Tarek joined SC Freiburg, being assigned to the reserves in Regionalliga. He scored the first in a 6\u20130 victory over Serbian side OFK Beograd in the 2011 Lev Yashin Cup final, also featuring regularly during the campaign; he was also converted initially to a left winger and later to a left back in the process. On 3 May 2012 Tarek signed for another reserve team, VfL Wolfsburg II. Despite extending his contract with the club roughly a year later, he moved to HNK Hajduk Split in August on a trial basis, and after nothing came of it, he returned to the United States in September and played 82 minutes in a 4\u20131 MLS Reserve League win for Chivas USA Reserves against Portland Timbers Reserves. ===El Gouna=== After an unsuccessful trial with German side FC Bayern Munich, Tarek signed with El Gouna in January 2014. He made his debut for the club on 9 January, playing the full 90 minutes in a 0\u20131 home loss against Smouha. Tarek played 15 games in his first season, as his side finished fifth. He was also an undisputed starter in his second, before the league was put on hiatus due to political issues. In November 2014, Tarek underwent a trial with Swiss Super League side FC Luzern. He was also linked to fellow league team Al Ahly SC, but nothing came of it. ===Betis=== On 6 July 2015 Tarek signed a four-year deal with Real Betis, newly promoted to La Liga, for an undisclosed fee. On 13 June 2016 Real Betis announced the termination of Amro Tarek\u2019s contract by mutual consent. ===Columbus Crew SC=== On 2 February 2016, Betis announced that Tarek had joined Columbus Crew of Major League Soccer on loan until June 2016 with the option to extend the loan until December 2016. Tarek struggled for playing time with Columbus, and was released by the club on May 5, 2016 after just a single substitute appearance. ===ENPPI=== On 15 June 2016, just two days after his contract termination with Real Betis, Tarek returned to Egypt and signed a four-year deal with Ismaily. However, the deal was terminated a month later before his registration was submitted, with Tarek joined fellow Egyptian Premier League side ENPPI. After one season with ENPPI, Tarek terminated his deal. ===Wadi Delga=== In August 2017, after originally reaching an agreement to join Smouha SC, he signed with Wadi Degla SC for free instead. ===Orlando City=== In February 2018 Tarek made his second loan move to MLS, this time joining Orlando City. He made his first start in the season opener versus D.C. United and scored his first goal for the club in a 3\u20133 draw against New England Revolution. ===New York Red Bulls=== On 11 December 2018, it was announced that Tarek had been traded to New York Red Bulls in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2019 MLS SuperDraft. On 2 March 2019, Tarek made his official debut with the club, appearing as a starter in a 1-1 draw with Columbus Crew on the opening day of the season. On 4 May 2019, Tarek opened the scoring for New York in a 3-2 victory over LA Galaxy. At the conclusion of the 2019 season he was named as the team's Newcomer of the Year. ==International career== Tarek was eligible for both the United States and Egypt. Having earned one cap for Egypt's Under-20 team, he was later monitored by the United States under-23s ahead of potential qualification for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On March 28, 2017, he made his Egypt debut, coming on as a substitute in a 3\u20130 friendly win over Togo. In May 2018 he was named in Egypt\u2019s preliminary squad for the 2018 World Cup in Russia but didn't make the final 23-man roster. It took 19 months for Tarek to gain his second cap and first international start, lining up against Swaziland in a 2019 Africa Cup of Nations qualifier. ==Career statistics== ===Club=== :As of 7 July 2019. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\" |- !rowspan=\"2\"|Club !rowspan=\"2\"|Season ! colspan=\"3\" |League !colspan=\"2\"|Cup !colspan=\"2\"|Continental !colspan=\"2\"|Total |- !Division !Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals!!Apps!!Goals |- | valign=\"center\" |1.
