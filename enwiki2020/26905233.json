Then, the Army Chorus A Capella Team performed the national anthem, and, in a dedication to the troops, Adam Sandler and Kevin James sang the command, \"Gentlemen, start your engines!\", in a wacky and musical manner, which has since been cited as one of the best and most memorable commands in NASCAR history.

He also stated, \"We never stop working, regardless of whether we\u2019ve got a nine-10ths- of-a-second lead or a nine-second lead.\" Kasey Kahne, who finished second, said, \"I hung with him for about three laps running in his kind of dirty air. I was right there. Then he just slowly crept away. It felt good. We were close. That\u2019s a huge improvement. I was pretty happy.\" \"We had a similar [fuel] issue at the start of the Pocono race last year where we broke a fuel cable,\" Hamlin said after the race. \"I thought maybe that\u2019s what we did. When I went to take off [after his stop], it immediately shut off. While it was \"a downer, I was pretty confident we weren\u2019t going to have it again. Because Mike [Ford, crew chief] never really gave me an alarm we were going to be stretching it on fuel.\" In the subsequent press conference, Hamlin's crew chief said, \"Towards the end of last season, where I said the best is yet to come, I strongly felt that way because towards the end of last season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. He comes back, obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that.\" The race left Kevin Harvick leading the Driver's Championship with 2,169 points. Kyle Busch, who finished twentieth, was second on 2,147, twenty-five points ahead of Hamlin in second and ninety- six ahead of Kurt Busch in third. Matt Kenseth was fifth with 2,019 points. Chevrolet maintained their lead in the Manufacturers' Championship with 103 points. Toyota placed second with 97 points, and Dodge followed with 65 points, now even with Ford. 4.3 million people watched the race on television. The race took two hours, thirty-three minutes and twenty-eight seconds to complete, and the margin of victory was 1.246 seconds. ==Race results== {| class=\"sortable wikitable\" border=\"1\" |- !
