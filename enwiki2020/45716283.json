    "text": "The Church of Divine Mercy is a Catholic church in Singapore. It is located at 19 Pasir Ris Street 72. ==History== Then Archbishop, Nicholas Chia announced sometime in 2003 that a site was allocated to build a new church for the Catholics in Pasir Ris-Loyang. Church of the Holy Trinity in Tampines was already bursting at its seams. The land given was only 3000 sqm but the community was very happy. At the ground breaking ceremony on 10 February 2007, the ceremony was graced by Archbishop, Nicholas Chia. The first mass was celebrated at Hai Sing Catholic School on 18 April 2009 with the Church community, even though the Church building was not ready. The mass at Hai Sing was simple, yet dignified. The Church then opened its doors on 12 December 2010. Father Piotr Prusakiewicz from Poland brought with him the relic of Saint Faustina, the patron saint of Divine Mercy. For three nights, Fr. Piotr led the congregation through devotions to the Divine Mercy and Mass to prepare the community for the Dedication and Blessing of CDM. The highlight was the Dedication and Blessing of the Church on 9 January 2010. Mass was celebrated by His Grace, Nicholas Chia. ==Priests== *Fr Johnson Fernandez (Parish Priest) *Fr Terence Kesavan == References == *Divine Mercy 'About Us' http://www.divinemercy.sg/aboutus/parish_office.html ==External links== *http://www.divinemercy.sg/ Category:21st-century Roman Catholic church buildings Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary Category:Churches in Singapore Category:Landmarks in Singapore Category:National monuments of Singapore Category:Buildings and structures in Hougang Category:Roman Catholic churches completed in 2010 Category:Divine Mercy ",
