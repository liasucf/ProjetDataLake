    "text": "Sindh National Front (S.N.F.) was a political party active in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. It was led by Mumtaz Bhutto, the cousin of Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, ex-Prime Minister of Pakistan, who was hanged by President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq. In 2017, the party merged with Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. The main objective of the party was a 'confederation' where each of the four provinces of Pakistan (Sindh, Punjab, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan) are semi- independent. The party had stated that it desires to bring about the same kind of autonomy federating units have in the United States, Canada, India, Australia, and the cantons in Switzerland. However, none of the aforementioned countries are de facto confederations. Sindh National Front believed that the 'provincial autonomy' which presently exists in Pakistan, provided in accordance with the Government of India Act of 1935, was actually meant for the provinces of colonial India and not for the provinces of a free and independent Pakistan. But after that in 1940 (Lahore resolution) was the main theme of Independent Pakistan. The party states that the Lahore Resolution is totally in favour of a Confederation, although varying interpretations exist such as the belief that Pakistan was originally believed to come into existence as three or more regions that would not have bordered each other and therefore would have to be autonomous for good governance. However, that did not happened later. ==References== ==External links== * SNF Category:Political parties in Pakistan Category:1989 establishments in Pakistan ",
