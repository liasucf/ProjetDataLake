    "text": "\"The Blackfly Song\" is a song by Wade Hemsworth, written in 1949, about being tormented by black flies while working in the wilds of Northern Ontario. It is an enduring classic of Canadian folk music, covered by a variety of other artists. A new version of the song (with accompanying vocals by Kate & Anna McGarrigle) which had a completely different tempo than the original, was made into an animated short film entitled Blackfly by Christopher Hinton and the National Film Board in 1991, and was nominated for Best Animated Short Film at the 64th Academy Awards in 1992. ==Plot and musical elements of the song== Although Hemsworth had stated he wrote the song while in Labrador, the song talks about the experiences he had while accompanying a Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario crew surveying the Little Abitibi River to the determine the feasibility of erecting a dam, the Abitibi Canyon Generating Station. He also mentioned \"I wasn't with Black Toby \u2026 that was another expedition. I was writing a song; I wasn't writing literature.\" It has been described as a \"breakneck romp\", characterized by a lively pace, though the first and last verses are reflective and slower. In addition, the verses for the most part hold an upbeat key, coming into contact with the abrasive chorus. Hemsworth provided a folksy tone and Canadian raising, and added some unique touches. To illustrate resentment for the flies, he places heavy emphasis on \"black\" in the words \"black fly\", but arguably the most distinct part of the song is where the word \"Ontario\" is stretched to \"On-terr-eye-oh-eye-oh\" (a pronunciation also used at times by other artists, such as Alan Mills and Stan Rogers). ===Selection from the song=== First Verse > 'Twas early in the spring when I decided to go > To work up in the woods in North Ontario > And the unemployment office said they'd send me through > To the Little Abitibi with the survey crew > Chorus > And the black flies, the little black flies > Always the black fly no matter where you go > I'll die with the black fly a-pickin' my bones > In North Ontar-eye-o-eye-o, In North Ontar-eye-o ==References== ==External links== *Download Link for the Black Fly Song *The Canadian Encyclopedia article *The official short film at the NFB site *Page from the site of former Abitibi Canyon residents, with RealAudio file of locals singing the song Category:1949 songs Category:Wade Hemsworth songs Category:Culture of Ontario Category:Culture of Northern Ontario Category:Songs about animals Category:Canadian comedy songs Category:Songs about Canada ",
