    "text": "Tarzan and the Lion Man is a novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the seventeenth in his series of twenty-four books about the title character Tarzan. The novel was originally serialized in the magazine Liberty from November 1933 through January 1934. It satirizes Hollywood's treatment of the Tarzan character and even spoofs Burroughs' own work. It was written at a time when Johnny Weissmuller was becoming a movie star by playing Tarzan as an illiterate character, to Burroughs' open displeasure. ==Plot summary== Tarzan and his lion companion Jad-bal-ja discover a mad scientist with a city of talking gorillas. To create additional havoc, a Hollywood film crew sets out to shoot a Tarzan movie in Africa and brings along an actor who is an exact double of the apeman, but is his opposite in courage and determination. Later, as John Clayton, Tarzan visits Hollywood to find himself in a screen test for a role in a Tarzan movie. He is deemed unsuitable for the lead role because he is \"not the type.\" ==Comic adaptations== The book has been adapted into comic form by Gold Key Comics in Tarzan no. 206, dated February 1972, with a script by Gaylord DuBois and art by Paul Norris, and later by DC Comics in Tarzan nos. 231-234, dated July 1974-January 1975, adapted by Joe Kubert. ==Sources== * * ==External links== * ERBzine.com Illustrated Bibliography entry for Edgar Rice Burroughs' Tarzan and the Lion Man *Edgar Rice Burroughs Summary Project page for Tarzan and the Lion Man *Text of the novel at Project Gutenberg Australia Category:1934 American novels Category:1934 fantasy novels Category:Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs Category:Novels first published in serial form Category:Works originally published in Liberty (general interest magazine) Category:Books about lions ",
