Since then the countries have fought three wars against each other. Since the first international cricket match between the two countries in 1952, political or diplomatic tensions frequently influenced their cricket relations, including the suspension of cricket tours. Once it became clear that the two teams would play each other in the 2nd semi-final of the ICC Cricket World Cup in 2011 a great deal of hype was generated; the match was even equated to war. ==Match== The match was played on 30March 2011 at the Punjab Cricket Association Stadium, Mohali in India. There were fears that rain would curtail or postpone the match until the Meteorological Department issued assurances that the period of the match would be rain-free. The Indian captain won the toss and elected to bat first. India made 260 runs in their 50 overs, losing 9 wickets. Sachin Tendulkar top scored with 85 runs and was declared the man of the match. Pakistan on the other hand, though getting off to a good start failed to maintain consistency and were restricted to just 231 runs while being bowled out in 49.5 overs. India won the match and confirmed their place in the 2011 Cricket World Cup Final. {| class=\"wikitable sortable |+ |- ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | ! scope=\"col\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Date | 30 March 2011 | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Day | Wednesday | style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | DayNight | Yes | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Time | 14:30 | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Venue | Punjab Cricket Association Stadium | style=\"text-align:center;\" |Mohali, Chandigarh |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Team 1 | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 260/9 (50) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Runs | Sachin Tendulkar | style=\"text-align:center;\"| 85 (115) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Wickets | Wahab Riaz | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 5/46 (10) |- | style=\"text- align:center;\" | Team 2 | | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 231 all out (49.5) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Runs |Misbha_ul_Haq | style=\"text- align:center;\" | 56 (76) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Wickets | Ashish Nehra | style=\"text-align:center;\" | 2_33 (10) |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Result | India Won by 29 Runs | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Umpire 1 | Ian Gould | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Umpire 2 | Simon Taufel | style=\"text- align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | TV Umpire | Billy Bowden | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Fourth Umpire | Rod Tucker | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |- | style=\"text-align:center;\" | Match Referee | Ranjan Madugalle | style=\"text-align:center;\" | |} Governments in almost all the states and provinces of both nations declared official holidays on 30March in view of this match.
