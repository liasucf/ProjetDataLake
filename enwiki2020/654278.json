    "text": "The Matterhorn, a classic example of a pyramidal peak. A pyramidal peak, sometimes called a glacial horn in extreme cases, is an angular, sharply pointed mountain peak which results from the cirque erosion due to multiple glaciers diverging from a central point. Pyramidal peaks are often examples of nunataks. ==Formation== Cross-section of cirque erosion over time Glaciers, typically forming in drainages on the sides of a mountain, develop bowl-shaped basins called cirques (sometimes called \u2018corries\u2019 - from Scottish Gaelic _coire_ [k\u02b0\u0259\u027e\u0259] (a bowl) - or s). Cirque glaciers have rotational sliding that abrades the floor of the basin more than walls and that causes the bowl shape to form. As cirques are formed by glaciation in an alpine environment, the headwall and ridges between parallel glaciers called ar\u00eates become more steep and defined. This occurs due to freeze/thaw and mass wasting beneath the ice surface. It is widely held that a common cause for headwall steepening and extension headward is the crevasses known as bergschrund that occur between the moving ice and the headwall. Plucking and shattering can be seen here by those exploring the crevasses. A cirque is exposed when the glacier that created it recedes. alt= When three or more of these cirques converge on a central point, they create a pyramid-shaped peak with steep walls. These horns are a common shape for mountain tops in highly glaciated areas. The number of faces of a horn depends on the number of cirques involved in the formation of the peak: three to four is most common. Horns with more than four faces include the Weissmies and the M\u00f6nch. A peak with four symmetrical faces is called a Matterhorn (after The Matterhorn). The peak of a glacial horn will often outlast the ar\u00eates on its flanks. As the rock around it erodes, the horn gains in prominence. Eventually, a glacial horn will have near vertical faces on all sides. In the Alps, \"horn\" is also the name of very exposed peaks with slope inclinations of 45-60\u00b0 (e.g. Kitzb\u00fcheler Horn). ==Examples== Muratov peak, Pirin Mountain, Bulgaria Kutelo and Vihren viewed from Koncheto, Pirin Mountain, Bulgaria *Artesonraju in \u00c1ncash, Peru *Cradle Mountain in Tasmania, Australia *Crowsnest Mountain in Alberta, Canada *Cuillin in Skye, Scotland *Fitz Roy in Patagonia, South America *Errigal in Donegal, Ireland *Grand Teton in Grand Teton National Park, Wyoming, United States *The Horn in Victoria, Australia *K2 in China and Pakistan *Kamenitsa, Pirin Mountain, Bulgaria * Ketil in Greenland * Kinnerly Peak in Glacier National Park, Montana, United States *The Kitzsteinhorn in Salzburg, Austria *The Matterhorn in Italy and Switzerland *Momin Dvor, Pirin Mountain, Bulgaria * Mount Aspiring/Tititea in Otago, New Zealand * Mount Assiniboine in British Columbia, Canada * Mount Thielsen in Oregon, United States *Mount Wilbur in Glacier National Park, Montana, United States *Nevado Las Agujas in Los R\u00edos, Chile *Pilot Peak in Wyoming, United States * Puy Mary in Cantal, France *The Pyramid in Antarctica *Pyramiden in Greenland *Reynolds Mountain in Glacier National Park, Montana, United States *Shivling in Uttarakhand, India *Stob Dearg in Glen Coe, Scotland *Store Skagast\u00f8lstind in Sogn og Fjordane, Norway *The Storr in Skye, Scotland *Snowdon in Snowdonia, Wales *Vihren, Pirin Mountain, Bulgaria *Belalakaya, Greater Caucasus, Russia ==See also== *Glacial landforms ==References== == Bibliography == * == External links == * Category:Mountains Category:Glacial erosion landforms ",
