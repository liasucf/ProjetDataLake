    "text": "The Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation expresses the dielectric constant (relative permittivity, \u03b5r) of a material in terms of the atomic polarizability, \u03b1, of the material's constituent atoms and/or molecules, or a homogeneous mixture thereof. It is named after Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti and Rudolf Clausius. It is equivalent to the Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation. It may be expressed as: :\\frac{\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{r} - 1}{\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{r} + 2} = \\frac{N \\alpha}{3\\varepsilon_0} where *\\varepsilon_r = \\epsilon/\\epsilon_0 is the dielectric constant of the material *\\varepsilon_0 is the permittivity of free space *N is the number density of the molecules (number per cubic meter), and *\\alpha is the molecular polarizability in SI-units (C\u00b7m2/V). In the case that the material consists of a mixture of two or more species, the right hand side of the above equation would consist of the sum of the molecular polarizability contribution from each species, indexed by i in the following form: :\\frac{\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{r} - 1}{\\varepsilon_\\mathrm{r} + 2} = \\sum_i \\frac{N_i \\alpha_i}{3\\varepsilon_0} In the CGS system of units the Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation is typically rewritten to show the molecular polarizability volume \\alpha' = \\alpha/(4\\pi\\varepsilon_0) which has units of volume (m3). Confusion may arise from the practice of using the shorter name \"molecular polarizability\" for both \\alpha and \\alpha' within literature intended for the respective unit system. ==Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation== The Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation is similar to the Clausius\u2013Mossotti relation, except that it relates the refractive index (rather than the dielectric constant) of a substance to its polarizability. The Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation is named after the Danish mathematician and scientist Ludvig Lorenz, who published it in 1869, and the Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz, who discovered it independently in 1878. The most general form of the Lorentz\u2013Lorenz equation is (in CGS units) : \\frac{n^2 - 1}{n^2 + 2} = \\frac{4 \\pi}{3} N \\alpha_\\mathrm{m} where n is the refractive index, N is the number of molecules per unit volume, and \\alpha_\\mathrm{m} is the mean polarizability. This equation is approximately valid for homogeneous solids as well as liquids and gases. When the square of the refractive index is n^2 \\approx 1 , as it is for many gases, the equation reduces to: : n^2 - 1 \\approx 4 \\pi N \\alpha_\\mathrm{m} or simply : n - 1 \\approx 2 \\pi N \\alpha_\\mathrm{m} This applies to gases at ordinary pressures. The refractive index n of the gas can then be expressed in terms of the molar refractivity A as: : n \\approx \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{3 A p}{R T}} where p is the pressure of the gas, R is the universal gas constant, and T is the (absolute) temperature, which together determine the number density N. Accordingly N = N_\\mathrm{A} \\cdot c holds, with c the molar concentration. If one replaces n with the complex refractive index m=n+ik, with the absorption index k, it follows that: : m \\approx1+ c\\frac{N_\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\alpha }{2\\varepsilon _{0}} Therefore the imaginary part, the absorption index, is proportional to the molar concentration : k \\approx c\\frac{N_\\mathrm{A} \\cdot \\alpha }{2\\varepsilon _{0}} and, therefore, to the absorbance. Accordingly, Beer's law can be derived from the Lorentz-Lorenz relation. The change of the real refractive index in diluted solutions is therefore also approximately linearly depending on the molar concentration. ==References== ==Bibliography== * * * * * Lorenz, Ludvig, \"Experimentale og theoretiske Undersogelser over Legemernes Brydningsforhold\", Vidensk Slsk.
