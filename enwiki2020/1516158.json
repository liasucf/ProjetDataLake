It operates scheduled domestic, international services and is an Indonesian associate carrier of Malaysian low-fare airline AirAsia. Its main base is Soekarno-Hatta International Airport in Jakarta. Until July 2010, Indonesia Air Asia, along with many Indonesian airlines, was banned from flying to the EU due to safety concerns. However, the ban was lifted in July 2010. Indonesia AirAsia is listed in category 1 by the Indonesian Civil Aviation Authority for airline safety quality.:: Directorate General Of Civil Aviation :: == History == === As Awair === The airline was established as Awair (Air Wagon International) in 1999 by Abdurrahman Wahid, chairman of the Nahdlatul Ulama. It is the largest Muslim organisation in Indonesia. He had a 40% stake in the airline which he relinquished after being elected president of Indonesia in late October 1999. It started operations on 22 June 2000 with Airbus A300, A310 and A320 aircraft, but all flights were suspended in March 2002. Awair restarted operating domestically within Indonesia as an associate of AirAsia in January 2005. === As Indonesia AirAsia === On 1 December 2005, Awair changed its name to Indonesia AirAsia in line with the other AirAsia branded airlines in the region. AirAsia Berhad has a 49% share in the airline with Fersindo Nusaperkasa owning 51%. Indonesia's laws disallow majority foreign ownership on domestic civil aviation operations.

A buy out of Batavia Air was announced on 26 July 2012. It was to be in two stages with AirAsia to buy 76.95% shares form Metro Batavia in a partnership with Fersindo Nusaperkasa (Indonesia AirAsia). By 2013, AirAsia was to acquire the remaining 23.05% held by other shareholders. The acquisition of Batavia Air by AirAsia Berhad and Fersindo created some controversy with Indonesian regulators at the time. By 11 October 2012 the deal between AirAsia Berhad, Fersindo Nusaperkasa (Indonesia AirAsia) and PT Metro Batavia had reversed. When the cancellation of the planned takeover between Batavia and AirAsia was announced on 11 October 2012 a joint statement was issued announcing a plan to proceed with an alliance encompassing ground handling, distribution and inventory systems in Indonesia. The statement also announced a plan to deliver operational alliances between Batavia and the Air Asia group. Batavia and Indonesia Air Asia announced a plan to form a separate joint venture to provide a regional pilot training centre in Indonesia. No details were provided on that new alliance when it was announced in early October 2012. == Corporate affairs == The airline's head office is in Tangerang, adjacent to Soekarno-Hatta International Airport.\"AirAsia Indonesia Resmikan Kantor Pusat Baru\" ().
