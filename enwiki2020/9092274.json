    "text": "Drammen Kommunale Trikk (DKT) (lit: Drammen Municipal Tram) was a Norwegian company that operated the Drammen trolleybus and bus system between July 1, 1947 and 1981, though the trolleybus system was closed in 1967. The company was started by the Drammen City Council when the licence of the former operator of the trolleybuses, A/S Trikken, went out of date. The company operated both the trolleybuses and diesel buses of Drammen until 1981, when the company was merged to create a common operating company for Drammen, Lier and Nedre Eiker. The new company was named Drammen og Omegn Busslinjer, and was sold to Nettbuss in 1999. ==References== Category:Defunct bus companies of Norway Category:Trolleybus transport in Norway Category:Companies formerly owned by municipalities of Norway Category:Transport companies established in 1947 Category:Transport companies disestablished in 1981 Category:Norwegian companies established in 1947 Category:1981 disestablishments in Norway Category:Companies based in Drammen ",
