Australia v. England at Melbourne Cricket Ground. Afterwards recognised as the first-ever Test Match. Australia won by 45 runs with Charles Bannerman scoring 165*: the first Test century. William Midwinter, with 5-78 in England\u2019s first innings, was the first bowler to take five wickets in a Test innings. 31 March - 4 April. Australia v. England: Second Test, also at MCG. England won by 4 wickets. 27 July - 28 July. Gloucestershire beats an \"unrepresentative\" (Wisden) England team by five wickets. Since 1877 only Yorkshire in 1905 and 1935 has equalled this feat. 10 & 12 November. South Australia v. Tasmania at Adelaide was the earliest first class match played by South Australia. They won by an innings and 13 runs, their team including George Giffen. ==Notes== An unofficial seasonal title sometimes proclaimed by consensus of media and historians prior to December 1889 when the official County Championship was constituted. Although there are ante-dated claims prior to 1873, when residence qualifications were introduced, it is only since that ruling that any quasi-official status can be ascribed. ==References== ==Annual reviews== * John Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketer\u2019s Companion (Green Lilly), Lillywhite, 1878 * James Lillywhite\u2019s Cricketers\u2019 Annual (Red Lilly), Lillywhite, 1878 * John Wisden's Cricketers' Almanack 1878 ==External links== * CricketArchive - season summaries Category:1877 in English cricket Category:English cricket seasons from 1864 to 1889 ",
