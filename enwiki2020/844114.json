The state elected a 60-member state legislative assembly on 6 January 1952. The Congress Party won 26 seats and the Akali Dal won 19 seats. On 22 April 1952, Gian Singh Rarewala again became Chief Minister, this time an elected one. He led a coalition government, called the \"United Front\", formed by the Akali Dal and various independents. On 5 March 1953 his government was dismissed and President's rule was imposed on the state. In the mid-term poll that followed, the Congress party secured a majority and Raghbir Singh became Chief Minister on 8 March 1954. Upon his death, Brish Bhan became the Chief Minister on 12 January 1955 and remained in office as last incumbent. === Subdivisions === Initially, in 1948, the state was divided into the following eight districts: # Patiala district # Barnala district # Bhatinda district # Fatehgarh district # Sangrur district # Kapurthala district # Mohindergarh district # Kohistan district In 1953, the number of districts was reduced from eight to five.
