    "text": "Aqualung Live (2005) is a live album by Jethro Tull, a live performance of Aqualung before an audience of 40 invited guests at XM Studios in Washington, D.C.. The album was given away to ticket holders on almost all US concerts in October and November 2005. Royalties from the European release go to various charities for the homeless. The US release was on 7 March 2006. However, some copies had been sold prior to this in music stores, most likely due to concertgoers selling their copies. ==Track listing== All songs written by Ian Anderson # \"Aqualung\" \u2013 7:56 # \"Cross-Eyed Mary\" \u2013 4:34 # \"Cheap Day Return\" \u2013 1:21 # \"Mother Goose\" \u2013 5:39 # \"Wond'ring Aloud\" \u2013 2:00 # \"Up to Me\" \u2013 3:35 # \"My God\" \u2013 8:27 # \"Hymn 43\" \u2013 4:22 # \"Slipstream\" \u2013 0:59 # \"Locomotive Breath\" \u2013 5:19 # \"Wind-Up\" \u2013 6:40 # Riffs \u2013 Another Monkey \u2013 1:27 # Recording the Original \u2013 2:05 # Choosing My Words with Care \u2013 1:17 # Hummmmmm 43 \u2013 0:35 # A Different Kettle of Very Different Fish \u2013 1:02 # But is It Any Good? \u2013 1:42 ==Notes== *Tracks 12\u201317 are the band speaking to the audience between songs and are labelled on the CD's back insert as \"Patter, banter and bunkum\". ==Credits== * Ian Anderson \u2013 flute, vocals, acoustic guitar * Martin Barre \u2013 electric guitar * Andrew Giddings \u2013 piano, organ, keyboards * Jonathan Noyce \u2013 bass guitar * Doane Perry \u2013 drums, percussion ==Release details== * 2005, UK, RandM Records RAMCD0015, Release date 19 September 2005, CD, 2010 EMI ==See also== * Aqualung (1971) ==References== ==External links== * Prog-Nose review Aqualung Live Aqualung Live ",
