He graduated in 1816, and went on to lead a studious but secluded life in his native Kilkenny, developing eccentricities which suggested to many that he was insane. He died on 7 January 1863, after a painful illness, at his house at St. Canice's Steps. His brother Samuel Hale Bibby, was a surgeon in Green Street, Grosvenor Square, London, and shared his literary taste, but was considered to be more conventional. ==Works== Bibby published two dramatic poems in blank verse, Gerald of Kildare (1854), and its sequel, Silken Thomas, or Saint Mary's Abbey (1859). ==See also== * Sale of books at Sotheby's *Obituary and family history dating back to John Bibby, Portreeve of Irishtown in 1691 ==Notes== ;Attribution Category:1799 births Category:1863 deaths Category:People educated at Kilkenny College Category:Alumni of Trinity College Dublin Category:Irish male poets Category:19th-century Irish poets Category:19th-century male writers ",
