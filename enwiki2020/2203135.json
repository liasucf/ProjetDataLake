Prince George of Greece, the judge for the event, determined that Jensen had lifted the 111.5 kilograms in better style than Elliot, awarded the Dane the gold medal. In the second event, the one handed, Jensen's 57 kilograms were not close to Elliot's 71 kilograms and thus Jensen took second place in that event. {| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%\" |- !Athlete !Event !Weight !Rank |- |rowspan=2|Viggo Jensen |One hand lift |align=\"center\"|57.0 |align=\"center\"| |- |Two hand lift |align=\"center\"|111.5 |align=\"center\"| |} ==References== * (Digitally available at ) * (Excerpt available at ) * Category:Nations at the 1896 Summer Olympics 1896 Olympics ",
