    "text": "J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r (1 April 1918 \u2013 1 June 1979) was a Hungarian-born Slovak film writer and director of Jewish heritage. As a filmmaker, he worked in Czechoslovakia, the United States, and Canada. Most of his films were directed in tandem with Elmar Klos. The two became best known for their Oscar-winning The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965). As a professor at FAMU (Film and TV School of the Academy of Performing Arts) in Prague, Kad\u00e1r trained most of the directors who spawned the Czechoslovak New Wave in the 1960s. After moving to the United States, he became professor of film direction at the American Film Institute in Beverly Hills. His personal life as well as his films encompassed and spanned a range of cultures: Jewish, Slovak, Hungarian, Czech, and American. ==Early years== Kad\u00e1r was born in Budapest, Austria-Hungary. Later his family moved to Ro\u017e\u0148ava, in the newly created Czechoslovakia, where he grew up. Kad\u00e1r took up the law in Bratislava after high school, but soon transferred to the first Department of Film in Czechoslovakia (probably the third such department in Europe) at the School of Industrial Arts in BratislavaMartin Votruba, \"Historical and Cultural Background of Slovak Filmmaking.\" in 1938, where he took classes with Slovak film's notable director Karel Plicka until the department was closed in 1939. Kad\u00e1r's home town, called Rozsny\u00f3 in Hungarian, became part of Hungary again in 1938. With the application of anti-Jewish laws, K\u00e1d\u00e1r was detained in a labor camp. He later said that it was for the first time in his life that he acted as a Jew: He refused conversion and served in a work unit with a yellow armband rather than a white one which was the privilege of those baptized.Barbara Pearce Johnson, et al. Dialogue on Film: Kadar Study Guide (1979).<\\--ISSN/ISBN needed--> His parents and sister were murdered in the death camp at Auschwitz. ==Film director== ===Overview=== Kad\u00e1r began his directing career in Bratislava, Slovakia after World War II with the documentary Life Is Rising from the Ruins (Na trosk\u00e1ch vyrast\u00e1 \u017eivot, 1945). After several documentaries expressive of the views of the Communist Party, which he joined, Kad\u00e1r moved to Prague in 1947 and returned to Bratislava temporarily in order to make Kathy (Katka, 1950), his first feature film. Beginning in 1952, he co-directed all his Czechoslovak films with Elmar Klos solely in Prague except their Czech\u2212Slovak projects Death Is Called Engelchen (, , 1963), The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965), and Adrift (, , , 1969) shot with Slovak, Hungarian, and Czech actors on location at Rusovce, Slovakia. Kad\u00e1r returned to finish the latter one from the United States, where he immigrated in November 1968.Kevin Thomas, \"Film-maker Finds Freedom.\" The Los Angeles Times, 9 October 1971. It was his last work with Klos. He then resumed his career in the U.S. and Canada working in both films and television. He was also a popular professor of film directing at the American Film Institute's Center for Advanced Film Studies. ===1950s=== While touting the obligatory Marxist-Leninist doctrine and adhering to Socialist- Realist filmmaking, J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r and Elmar Klos first bounced between comedy and hard-core propaganda. Kad\u00e1r's first feature film Kathy (Katka, 1950)Jelena Pa\u0161t\u00e9kov\u00e1, \"The Context of Slovak Filmmaking during the Imposition of Communism (1948\u20131955).\" made before he teamed up with Klos was little different in this respect from their subsequent joint work. Their choice of themes began to change with the first, mild relaxation of communism in Czechoslovakia after Soviet leader Khrushchev's secret speech in 1956. Kad\u00e1r and Klos's first film during this minor thaw, Three Wishes (T\u0159i p\u0159\u00e1n\u00ed, 1958), a cagey satire on aspects of everyday life, outraged the authorities and was shelved until the more relaxed conditions in 1963.Peter Hames, \"J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r and Elmar Klos\", The Czechoslovak New Wave (1985).<\\--ISSN/ISBN needed--> The studios suspended both directors for two years.V\u00e1clav Macek, J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r. Forthcoming. Quoted in \"Di\u0161tanc (1959\u20131962)\", Film.sk, 7 August 2007. Their Communist Party membership protected them from a worse fate, however, and Kad\u00e1r was able to find a refuge in semi-propagandist, technically avant-garde work for the early Czechoslovak multi-screen shows at the Laterna magika (Magic Lantern) project.\"History\", Laterna magika; accessed 23 July 2018. ===1960s=== The first feature film J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r and Elmar Klos were able to make in five years showed a decided return to classical black-and-white film-making with barely a trace of Kad\u00e1r's more experimental work at the Laterna magika. A gradual relaxation of communist control in Czechoslovakia, whose first signs came from Slovakia, enabled the Bratislava journalist and writer Ladislav M\u0148a\u010dko to publish his novel Death Is Called Engelchen (Smr\u0165 sa vol\u00e1 Engelchen, 1959)English translation by George Theiner, 1961. and Kad\u00e1r and Klos to reach for it from Prague after their suspension was over. The novel and their film Death is Called Engelchen (, , 1963) spotlighted a new take on the massive pro-democratic Slovak revolt of 1944 that previously had been portrayed only as invariably glorious. It showed some of its aspects that brought about human tragedy. The film was entered into the 3rd Moscow International Film Festival where it won a Golden Prize. The directors' next film, Accused aka Defendant (Ob\u017ealovan\u00fd, 1964), rehashed the propagandist structures of the earlier Socialist-Realist filmmaking, but turned them around by replacing the content mandated in the 1950s with committed social criticism that was quickly becoming one of the hallmarks of Slovak cinema and Czech cinema of the 1960s. All of these experiences and influences intersected to bring Kad\u00e1r and Klos their enduring success with The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965),Steven Banovac, \"J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r and Elmar Klos: The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze) 1965, kinokultura.com; accessed 23 July 2018. a compassionate and tormenting depiction of the dead-end street faced by many in Central Europe during the deportations of the Jews to German concentration camps during World War II.J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r, \"Not the Six Million but the One\", criterion.com; accessed 23 July 2018. The film received several awards, including a foreign-language Oscar. Slovak and Czech film academics and critics still consider it the best film in the history of Slovak cinema.Projekt 100. Kad\u00e1r and Klos's work on their next project based on the Hungarian novel Something Is Drifting on the Water (Valamit visz a v\u00edz, 1928) by Lajos Zilahy, and, effectively, a remake of the Hungarian film with the English international title Something Is in the Water (Valamit visz a v\u00edz, dir. Guszt\u00e1v Ol\u00e1h and Lajos Zilahy, 1943) was interrupted by the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968. Kad\u00e1r and his family quickly resettled in the United States, and although he returned briefly to help finish the film released as Adrift (, , 1969), his involvement was limited by comparison to his previous work with Klos. That was also the last time that the two directors met. ===1970s=== J\u00e1n Kad\u00e1r's first film after immigration to the United States and his first solo feature film since 1950 was The Angel Levine (1970), a substantially modified version of Bernard Malamud's short story Angel Levine (1958). He later directed Lies My Father Told Me in Canada. ==Filmography== * Life Is Rising from the Ruins (Na trosk\u00e1ch vyrast\u00e1 \u017eivot, 1945) * They Are Personally Responsible for Crimes against Humanity (S\u00fa osobne zodpovedn\u00ed za zlo\u010diny proti \u013eudskosti, 1946) * They Are Personally Responsible for a Betrayal of the National Uprising (S\u00fa osobne zodpovedn\u00ed za zradu na n\u00e1rodnom povstan\u00ed, 1946) * Katka (1950) * The Hijacking; aka Kidnapped (\u00danos, 1952) * Music from Mars (Hudba z Marsu, 1954) * House at the Terminus (Tam na kone\u010dn\u00e9, 1957) * Three Wishes (T\u0159i p\u0159\u00e1n\u00ed, 1958) * Death Is Called Engelchen (, , 1963) * Accused (Ob\u017ealovan\u00fd, also known as Defendant, 1964) * The Shop on Main Street (Obchod na korze, 1965) * Adrift (, , , 1969) * The Angel Levine (1970) * Lies My Father Told Me (1976) * The Case against Milligan (1976) * Freedom Road (1979) == References == https://uedata.amazon.com/Interview- director-Kadar-making-Father- ebook/dp/B07R7HPBX6/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Jan+Kadar&qid;=1585697787&s;=digital- text&sr;=1-1 Category:1918 births Category:1979 deaths Category:Hungarian film directors Category:Czechoslovak film directors Category:Czechoslovak emigrants to the United States Category:Hungarian Jews Category:American people of Hungarian-Jewish descent Category:People from Budapest Category:Directors of Best Foreign Language Film Academy Award winners ",
