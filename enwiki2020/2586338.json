    "text": "The Lewis S. Rosenstiel Award for Distinguished Work in Basic Medical Research is awarded by Brandeis University. It was established in 1971 \"as an expression of the conviction that educational institutions have an important role to play in the encouragement and development of basic science as it applies to medicine\". Medals are presented annually at Brandeis University on the basis of recommendations of a panel of scientists selected by the Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center. Awards are given to scientists for recent discoveries of \"particular originality\" and \"importance to basic medical research\". A $30,000 prize and a medallion accompanies each award. Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center The Rosenstiel Basic Medical Sciences Research Center, named after Lewis Solon Rosenstiel, was established in 1968, carrying out research in basic medical science. == Recipients == Source: Brandeis University *2019 David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian, for their remarkable contributions to our understanding of the sensations of temperature, pain and touch *2018 Stephen C.
