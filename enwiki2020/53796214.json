    "text": "Daughters of Reykjav\u00edk () is an all-female Icelandic hip-hop band from Reykjavik formed in 2013. ==History== Reykjav\u00edkurd\u00e6tur was created in 2013 by Bl\u00e6r J\u00f3hannsd\u00f3ttir and Kolfinna Nikul\u00e1sd\u00f3ttir. After connecting with other women who were interested in rapping, they began hosting recurring public female rap nights in Reykjav\u00edk. From there the band started to form as an open clan but has since developed into what it is today: A nine piece band, with eight performers on stage at a time. Five of the current members have been in the band since it was formed in 2013. In 2017 the Daughters were asked to put up a show at the Reykjav\u00edk City Theatre. It could be anything they wanted. With the diverse background of the girls they came up with \u201cRVKDTR THE SHOW\u201d a performance where they expressed their experience of being a 20-something woman in Iceland. It debuted in May 2017 and got good reviews. In October 2019, the band rebranded themselves as \"Daughters of Reykjav\u00edk\", the English translation of Reykjav\u00edkurd\u00e6tur.https://www.instagram.com/p/B4Gl4bRABaq/ The band launched a crowdfunding campaign in late 2013 in order to record and launch their first album, RVK DTR. In 2019 the Daughters won the MME awards (EBBA awards) at the Eurosonic festival along with Rosalia and Bishop Briggs. The band is represented by ATC live and ATC management. Daughters of Reykjav\u00edk will release their new album, Soft Spot, in April 2020. ==Style == The texts of Daughters of Reykjav\u00edk refer to different themes of life in Iceland, especially pertaining to Icelandic women. During an interview in 2016, the group spoke about the contribution that their songs can have in politics, partying, body shaming, gender inequality, the empowerment of women, and overcoming broken hearts. They recorded most of their songs in Icelandic but also recorded some songs in English. They wrote the song \"Drusla\" (\"Slut\") for the 2014 Icelandic slut walk. ==Discography== {| class=\"wikitable\" |- ! Year !! Titel !!
