One day, Davey Morrison \u2013 the three pets' master and the son of a government scientist \u2013 is kidnapped by a group of underground adversaries. His parents receive a ransom note demanding secret missile plans in exchange for Davey. In desperation, the Morrison family hires Detective Sharpe, a bumbling police detective who quickly gets nowhere with the case.
