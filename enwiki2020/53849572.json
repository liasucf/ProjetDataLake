He turned professional in 1997 and made several main draw appearances at ATP Tour tournaments. Most notably he had a first-round win over world number 23 Jonas Bj\u00f6rkman at St. P\u00f6lten in 1997. At the same tournament the following year he narrowly lost to Thomas Muster, 5\u20137 in the final set. Muster was also his doubles partner at ATP Tour tournaments in Stuttgart and Kitzb\u00fchel. His only Challenger title came in 2000 at the Oberstaufen Cup, where he defeated Radomir Vasek in the final. He was unable to defend his title in 2001 but did have a win over David Ferrer. At the 2001 French Open he made it to the final round of qualifying, beating James Blake en route. ===Davis Cup=== The first of his two Davis Cup appearances for Austria was an away tie to Croatia in 2001. He played in the reverse singles, a dead rubber that he lost to Mario An\u010di\u0107 in a final set tie- break. His second Davis Cup match came in 2002, when Austria hosted Israel in Tyrol. He partnered Alexander Peya in the doubles, which they lost in five sets to Jonathan Erlich and Andy Ram. In 2012 he was appointed Austria's Davis Cup captain and in his first year took the team to the World Group quarter- finals, for the first time since 1995. The Austrians were relegated in 2013 and after their 2014 campaign, in which they were unable to return to the World Group, Trimmel was replaced by Stefan Koubek. He also captained the Austria Fed Cup team in the 2014 season. ==Challenger titles== ===Singles: (1)=== {|class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=font-size:97% !style=\"width:20px\" class=\"unsortable\"|No. !style=\"width:40px\"|Year !style=\"width:220px\"|Tournament !style=\"width:50px\"|Surface !style=\"width:200px\"|Opponent !style=\"width:160px\" class=\"unsortable\"|Score |- |1. |2000 |Oberstaufen, Germany |Clay | Radom\u00edr Va\u0161ek |6\u20134, 6\u20131 |} ==See also== *List of Austria Davis Cup team representatives ==References== ==External links== * * * Category:1978 births Category:Living people Category:Austrian male tennis players Category:Austrian tennis coaches Category:Sportspeople from Vienna ",
