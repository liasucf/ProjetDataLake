    "text": "The Zilog Z16C01 SCC was introduced in the early 1980s and provided the ability to do both standard UART style serial communications along with the HDLC protocol for a reasonable price. It was a descendant of the earlier Zilog SIO, and its main enhancement was the inclusion of a built-in baud rate generator. It was part of the Zilog Z8000 chip set. ==External links== * Zilog.com Classic Microcontrollers - Z16C01 * Zilog.com - Z16C01/Z16C02 Product Specification Category:Microcontrollers ",
